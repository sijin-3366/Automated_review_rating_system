4.0,It was super cute!
4.0,"Fitted by otherwise fits fine. The buttons aren't the best quality and they feel like they're hanging on for dear life, but it's a nice change from the typical casual black top."
4.0,"The top is great, the bottoms are pretty snug on my booty but overall I love it!"
4.0,I’m 5’4” 125lbs. Got the medium and it was way to big. But i will keep it and use it for pj top.
4.0,Nice. Keeps excellent time. Lots of admirers.
4.0,I like that it is real lapis lazuli.
4.0,"Great socks! Not too thick or thin, good support. Would buy another pair for sure."
4.0,Bridesmaids worn once for our Boho wedding this past weekend. Beautiful dress. Very comfortable.
4.0,Is good quality but the XL is little tight in belly
4.0,Comfy little casual dress. Looks cute with jean jacket too
4.0,"A little snug, but looks good!"
4.0,"Pretty cute! The fits is great, but there is definitely a few awkward irregularities. All in all, a great deal for $12! I am 5’2” 125lbs, very muscular, long waisted with big thighs and booty. I bought the medium and it was a perfect fit."
4.0,"First to be honest i dont know this watch,looks very well made,elegant,spare bands but in the descripition reads swiss automatic and in the product especifications SEAGULL 3600k thats chinese movement......they made very good movements but in this watch is chinese quality movement."
4.0,Perfect gift for my mother's birthday. Great price. Shipped pretty fast.
4.0,"This bra is beautiful and it does a great job of holding up my very large breasts - in balconette style. I bought a 36DDD at first and returned for a 36G, which fits much better in the cup. The band fits as expected leaning towards small, the cup is larger than expected. I have natural and fairly full breasts, but the area where the cup meets the shoulder strap has a little gap on the larger size, and I get a slight double-boob on the smaller size. If you have an emptier (deflated?) upper breast, this bra may not work for you.<br />The color is a lovely sort of lilac bluish/purple. There are no matching panties, sadly, so I bought a dark nude lace tanga style panty, and it looks really cute.<br />The main great thing is that my boobs look amazing in the bra, but the main bad thing is that from the first wearing, I felt the wire digging slightly into my left underarm area. The wire does shift inside its casing, which I think of as a flaw, but it did help me to adjust the wire a little, up into the seam where there is more padding. That said, the structure of the bra, wires and strap around ribs, with seams, etc., is pretty substantial. You feel like you're strapped into something heavy duty, but it looks so pretty that the sensation doesn't match the display, lol.  Another weird thing, that others mentioned in reviews, is a squeaking or what I would describe more of as a creaking noise in the structure. I am pretty sure this is the wire shifting around in the casing. It is not very noticeable, like wearing a squeaky shoe or anything, but it is a little odd to hear from time to time. If you have sensory issues, this may not be the bra for you, for all of the reasons above.  -  Otherwise, if you have a large rack and would like to put them up on display occasionally - I recommend this bra!  **Keep in mind that the price is great on this bra and returns are listed as available, but they don't tell you in advance that there is a $5.95 shipping/restock fee (to HerRoom) to return it. I ended up keeping the smaller one as well, hoping to find someone to pass it on to."
4.0,"I like these sleeves. I only wish they came in other colors than these intense high contrast ones. Like green, brown, gray, rust."
4.0,Looks very nice! They sent me another one as the first one didn't work after checking the battery.
4.0,"So I followed everyone's advice and sized up a size. I usually fit a medium, sometimes a small. I got a large per the advice given and I was disappointed. Do not follow the advice! Get your right size! The large was way too big. Fortunately I only need it for the avengers movie to dress up as scarlet witch and then I can return it for the right size because I do like the coat. The only other problem I have is that the lapels won't lay down, they keep popping up, but that's not too hard to fix. The quality is very nice for what I paid"
4.0,"These pants were not exactly what I was expecting when I  ordered them but I was still really happy with them. They are made of very spandex like material but are still really soft and comfortable. Something I really liked about these that I am not really sure is even suppose to be a feature, is that you can wear them with the band folded over or you can wear them where the band is not folded over and go higher up your waist. I like this option when I am working out cause in my mind it helps holding in my tummy area. If you are in between sizes I would recommend going smaller only because they are really good at stretching so if you think you can go smaller, do it. You will not have problem with these being see through, which was a plus for me. I only gave it four stars because I was expected it to have a little more of a cotton material. Also they were actually kinda long on me and I am 5'6."
4.0,This was a nice full boa. There was some shedding but not enough to make it a problem. We used it a lot for photo booth shots.
4.0,"After wearing this throughout the majority of the day, I'm very happy with how this turned out. I needed to order a Yusuke cosplay within a week's time, and I ended up ordering this. I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. I'd never worn a jumpsuit before but this was really comfortable. The suit itself is comfy and fit well, the gloves are comfy as well, the sash is super easy since its Velcro. The tail itself is the lowest part. So far, the ribbon around it has come undone twice and the pole inside of it split it open so I took it out and I need to sew it up. Be careful with the tail. It also comes with armlets, but to be honest, I'm not entirely sure why. Maybe for help with boots? This set does NOT come with boots, but I just bought a pair of white go go boots from a local Halloween shop. Overall, this is very solid and if you want to cosplay Yusuke on a budget or don't have much time I would absolutely recommend this."
4.0,"overall good tights not to thick, but just a little on the thin side great for summer morning runs."
4.0,It’s nice... but it’s pretty small... I was hoping it would be bigger. Kinda looks like a toy...
4.0,"Arrived early in perfect condition. Very sturdy. Only downside for me personally is how specifically the red pins are more dull and less vibrant as shown. Other than that, good for people who enjoy collecting pins!"
4.0,I purchased these gloves for myself. I was pleased with the quality and fit. I ware them all the time wile winter driving.
4.0,"The pants are accurate size, shirt is way smaller. I had to give it to a friend but it is very comfy"
4.0,"Unlike other watches i own, this one is both good function and form.  The time is easy to read at a quick glance.  The only negative is the watche's thickness.  Awkward when wearing long-sleeve shirts."
4.0,"Sweet little necklace for those of us who wear multiple fine chains. I would give it 5 stars if it came in 18&#34; or 20&#34; length, but that was easily solved when I bought gold chain extenders. Very nice, unexpected quality for the price!"
4.0,So great I bought another one in a diff color
4.0,"I purchased despite the bad reviews, when I first put it on, it did fog up.  I realized that there was a thin plastic film on the plastic that needed to be peeled off, once it was removed, no fogging.  I felt it was far enough away from my face and it did not touch my nose.  Not a bad product,  I just can’t stand having my mouth completely covered.  This give protection without feeling like you suffocating."
4.0,The pajama fits well. Robe a tad to small for my bust size.
4.0,"Wish the frames were just a little bigger. Still cute, so I will keep them."
4.0,A nice size that holds just what is needed.
4.0,the earrings seem of sturdy design. Cute color choices. The only thing that was different than the stock photos is that they made the beads appear smaller and more intricate. This isn't a huge deal but not as detailed as the pair I bought on the res in Montana. For the price though they are pretty and seem og good quality. There weren't a lot of photos for these earrings so I added some to show size.
4.0,I love this anket  Cant wait to wear all summer  So elegant  and delicate looking.  Good value for money.
4.0,THERE WAS ONLY ONE IN THE BOX AND I WAS THINKING THAT THERE WAS TWO<br />I am a soldier in Kuwait at the monument and well going home soon so it was realy good to have lights here. it gets dark at 5 pm....so need them on my bike...<br />but I didn't put it on my bike I made a jack-o-lantern out a plastic muscle building containers. I used the blue light for the inside of it...look at picture thank for sending the light so fast
4.0,"very good, fabric and style looks exactly like the picture and you cant beat the price, love!!"
4.0,"Decent quality and arrived as expected, nice dress for $30. Tight on sleeve and in bust area. A large is perfect for a 10/12 unless you are a solid D cup or larger- then it will NOT fit."
4.0,"This sweater is gorgeous and warm; however, it runs SUPER SMALL, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I normally wear a size 10 or Medium, but the large size in all PattyBoutik sweaters are VERY snug."
4.0,Love the shirts … did not give five stars only because sizing was difficult.  Usually order small finally ended up with large!!
4.0,"This product worked well but came unsnapped during the wash. While it worked, I wish it were a little sturdier."
4.0,"I have looked far and wide for a robe that is both functional AND comfortable, a much more difficult task than I ever imagined. Functional robes that absorb moisture when I'm just out of the shower tend to be heavy and bulky, especially around the neck and shoulders. Comfy robes are usually just for looks and comfort and not made for absorbency at all. I hit the jackpot with this one, though! It's soft and velvety on the outside with a high quality terry cotton lining. There is no bunching around my neck and the length hits just below my knees. Warm and cozy without being overwhelming. I love this robe now at the height of Mississippi summer but can see that I will love it in January just as well. My review is 4 stars rather than 5 only because I wish the span of the robe had a few more inches for use over winter Pjs. All in all this is a solid buy and the best robe I've found! Highly recommended!"
4.0,"The shirt looks great, and I get a lot of compliments. I would give it five stars if the material was just a little thicker and more comfortable."
4.0,Perfect! Did the job.
4.0,"I haven’t worn this yet, or washed it. I want to exchange it’s size actually. Ordered a medium and it’s too big. But the cut is very cute, and it has pockets !"
4.0,A little porous but nice fit and design. I wear it over a medical mask 😷.
4.0,A little tight in my kiddos feet but after a few wears they loosened up!
4.0,"I'm not giving this 4 stars for how I truly feel about it, but how I feel about it compared to the price. For my body, it doesn't fit well at all. I'm 5'9, but small on top, so I ordered a small. It's still huge on top, but only midshin length in front. I think the length actually is cute, but I can't wear it without my bra showing on the sides and all kinds of extra fabric gathering around my pits. That being said, it still worth the price because it's comfy and cute with a jacket or sweater to cover the poorly cut top."
4.0,"I was afraid that the bracelts would be too big, and they were, except for the black and white pearl ones. But the other ones I used parts from to make another bracelt that fits so it worked out well."
4.0,"So cute! I'' 5-7&#34; and 135, bought a small and it was a little smaller than I'd expected, probably would get a medium if I did it again."
4.0,My daughter loved it because it’s so soft and the little animals are so cute. She even wants to wear them to go out. The only issue is that the bottom is a little hard so it’s not the most comfortable and it makes a lot of noise when she walks but that’s insignificant.
4.0,"I like these simple belts to finish an outfit, I got them in every color, but they do stretch out pretty easily, so these are great for an accent, not so much to hold tight."
4.0,runs a bit small while still being elastic. Very pretty costume jewelry!
4.0,"Beautiful,!"
4.0,"Everything about the item was ok so far. My husband still has to try them, though. I'm smaller than him a bit, I tried them on and they fit somewhat a little snug. ESPECIALLY in the thigh and butt areas."
4.0,Bought the belly ring as I had the same one from Hot Topic and lost the ball. It looks absolutely amazing and is great quality! My only issue was that the ball had a tiny sliver of metal hanging out that cut and scraped me but other than that I love it and the free gift!
4.0,Ball Does not really stay pumped up but we have a pump so its not too much of an issue
4.0,"Very nice shirt.<br /><br />Because it's thick, there is no give in the material. None. So can end up tight on the arms. The body is fine.<br /><br />Shrinks a little after wash. So next time I'd go with a size up from my normal form fitting size.<br /><br />Otherwise, great. Definitely not a knock-off."
4.0,I wear these around the house to keep from slipping on hardwood floors. Good value for the price and wasn and wear.
4.0,"The stitching is very intricate and lovely. The heel is a nice height. The strap has a couple of positions for the button, so there's a good fit. I wouldn't do a lot of walking in them since they're fabric and they're heels, but  for a lazy day or short jaunts they're beautiful."
4.0,"The rose gold and regular gold are wonderful, but the white gold irritates my wife's ears, other than that good for the price."
4.0,I love the charm it is beautiful although it didn't fit my Pandora bracelet. I'm going to find a way to get it on.
4.0,its nice thank you using like bag and overnight bag
4.0,This mask came neatly packaged and folded as one piece face mask. The material is lightweight and easily fits over a variety of sizes of heads. My husband and I both had no problem with it fitting well over the designated area. This mask is comfortable and easy to breathe through unlike scarfs or thick neck gators. The material is adequate against wind and mild cold temperatures but doesn't not hold up against extreme temperatures. It is a wonderful commodity for warehouse work or protection against dust and wind. I was discounted this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
4.0,"Very pretty compass necklace. Gold plating is nice and even, not too thin either. I really liked it but I wasn’t able to remove the pendant from the chain and put it onto another, it is not removable. I purchased this to put on a specific chain my husband gave me for Mother’s Day but that was not possible bc the pendant connector ring is too tiny to fit over either end of the clasp to be taken off the chain (or put on another, without a special tool and possibly ruining the pendant). It’s very pretty and I like it quite a lot but unusable in this case. I’m returning it but I’d have DEFINITELY kept it had the pendant been interchangeable."
4.0,Absolutely love this. I ordered an XL and my only complaint is it's a bit tight through the shoulders.  I'm going to order this again in a different color but I'll order a 2X this time.
4.0,"No doubt this wallet is well made and functional.  I'm only returning it for two reasons and all personal preference.  1) the leather is rougher than I expected or want.  I prefer the smoother grain leather.  2) it's a bit wider than expected.  still slim, but more wide than another money clip wallet that I already own.  If these things don't bother you and you're looking for a solidly built wallet, go for it."
4.0,Nice product for the $.  Have to improvise using your own holders/pillows if over 7 1/2 inch wrist.  And no larger face watches.  (Can't fit 2 side x side)
4.0,Granddaughter birthday party.
4.0,"I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. The discount I received in no way affects my honest opinion of this product.<br />I love this dress! My first impression is that the material is much thicker and heavier than I was expecting, but that's a good thing! The colors (I bought red trimmed in black piping) are very vibrant and cheerful. I tried it on and it fits perfectly! I'm normally a size 4, but I have a hard time finding dresses that fit properly in the bust without being obscene as I am a 30F bra size. This dress definitely fits the bill! There is a little bit of stretch in the fabric so I'm not squished and the sweetheart neckline doesn't plunge and show off a ton of cleavage. It's perfect! The dress did arrive pretty wrinkled, but that is to be expected. A quick tumble in the dryer fixed it right up! A minor qualm is that the black piping along the neck line isn't quite even, but it's not really noticeable, so no big deal. The washing instructions do say hand wash, which is another negative. Outside of that, this dress couldn't be more perfect!"
4.0,"I received it today and it looks great but it's a little small. Even though I ordered the largest size they had. I am Asian and I would fit better if it was a 4 or 5X. The chest area is a little small My bra size is 34C.  I can only ware sleeveless tops and leave it unbuttoned.  Unlike the models shown, I actually have breasts, so the jacket does not close nicely.  Other than that, the cut and metrical is nice and has a clean look to it.  It is great for spring or just when you need a light jacket."
4.0,Gift....had to send back but it was corrcted.
4.0,"I really love the cute design of the 2 cats sitting next to each other. Looking at it directly looks beautiful and the size and shape is nice. But it is much thicker and heavier than I was expecting and the quality of the crystal and polishing was disappointing.<br /><br />There were chips or surface defects on much of the surface, which for $35 isn't horrible since you really only see them from an angle, but I wouldn't want to gift something like that to someone because they would probably see that same defects and be disappointed. So if I was planning on it being a gift I would definitely order ahead of time and inspect it to make sure what arrives isn't going to disappoint.<br /><br />The coloring also comes from the underside of the crystal and not the crystal itself so it is all about the viewing angle. But the viewing angle is pretty wide and the reason why I wanted the pendant was because of the cat design and the silver work was very nicely done and adorable."
4.0,"I love the shoes and have gotten lots of complements, but they are a little big and I have a wide foot."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter's 8th birthday. I really like this skirt.  Really pretty colour. However the stitching is really poor quality. I will take it to my seamstress to have it reenforced to make it more durable. Over all my daughter loves it. Great buy for the price.
4.0,"I like the bracelet- fits well- slips on easily. However, not sure about the ‘metal’, looks like it is tarnishing."
4.0,"Nice quality for the price,  my son love them."
4.0,"Gorgeous, but difficult to get in my cartilage piercing. Had to put in backwards in order to close the hoop. Needless to say, I won't be taking it out for a while after the struggle I had. But now that it is in. I do really love it, and my ear isn't throbbing like it was with the stud I was wearing before. Definitely hypo-allergenic."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:10e6de73e43d2dccef69df52dc2845b0]] The rings move freely in both directions like a gyroscope. However, it does not spin but twisting the dials in the outside like Hermoine does in the movie. Great as a necklace for my 6yr old daughter! Probably too gaudy/large as everyday wear for myself, but my 41yr old self likes daintier pieces 😂"
4.0,"I love this FRYE phone case!! The only reason I gave it a 4 star ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️Is the slot you put the phone in is too small with just a thin case on phone. If you don’t have a case on your iPhone then it fits perfectly. Most of us have cases on our phones. So, I just use that phone slot for my  receipts and lay my phone in the middle of case. But, you have to be careful it doesn’t fall out from bottom when you unzip. It is very handy when you just want to make a quick run and have your drivers license and bank card alone with phone in this cute leather phone case. Maybe they will revise it and make the phone slot fit with or without a case. Over all I love it!"
4.0,"Great deal, grandmother loved it also wlvery pretty just wishing there were more to choose from."
4.0,It's just what I needed for my checks...would have given 5 🌟 if it had the plastic cover for duplicate checks and a little bit thicker like: but its great for the price....color was slightly darker than pictured but it's ok.
4.0,"A little shinier than expected, but good for the price."
4.0,"Nice big hoody, baggy where it should be and hugs where it should . Happy with size and price."
4.0,This sweater is really warm and soft and cute and I like the zipper/button combo. It's bulky in a good way. The only thing I don't like about it is that the loose weave of the sweater is not very durable. I snagged it twice just while trying it on the first time. And the yarn pulls out REALLY far if you snag it.
4.0,Looks very cute on and is true to size.
4.0,"I love how the top accommodates a larger bust. It has a light padding to hide your headlights and doesn’t have loose inserts, so no pieces bunching up or getting lost. The top feels secure so I don’t have to worry about falling out or shifting. The bottoms are a tad too small for me but overall, this is a great suit! I’ve got several suits from this brand, I highly recommend it."
4.0,Excellent price and prompt delivery. 36&#34; belt size. Yet buckle can become separated from belt too easily.
4.0,These work well and look good. The only negative is they are bulky behind the ear. They don't hug the ear like most glasses. These aren't bent to go around the ear.
4.0,Can’t keep it on the shoulders. The French is too heavy so it makes it far it should be a tie on it so it wouldn’t alleviate that problem. It’s really cute
4.0,"Super cute. Fit my 38"" 3 year old well, but did have to tie the pants at the waistline - easy to do with a hair tie.  She loved it.  Only thing is it really is a one time wear as some of the decorations started to fall apart.  Great for Halloween."
4.0,"It keeps my head warm at nught, whuch us what I wanted/"
4.0,Seems well built but not sure how long this thing will last as the clasp is made of cheap plastic that is barely held together. I can see it eroding over time and not being able to close securely over time.
4.0,"As a plus size woman, this is definitely a Chinese size clothing chart and I would highly recommend this for petite women, teenagers, and younger children. Now let's talk about the clothing:  The material of the shirt is very transparent and very lightweight is which great because you can layer it over a tank and leggings without looking too bulky. This would be an awesome shirt for the spring and summer since the materials for the shirt is very sheer.  The length of the arms when it pertains to the shirt is more of a 3/4 sleeve instead of a long sleeve unless you are a very petite woman. I am 5'7 so they stopped at the 3/4 length instead of all the way to the wrist. This is an oversized pull over so the long will be longer than the back and the front right above your waist line. I had to give this shirt to my niece to wear because as a plus size woman, it did not fit me but it fit her perfect but she is a teenager and has a smaller body build than mine. Now if you are like me, I do not like shirts to be close to her bust area since she is still a child and this is perfect for her because it is very loose around the bust area.  When you wash this shirt, I would definitely hand wash it and hang it up to dry because if you dry it, it might shrink even more. Overall, I like the shirt on her but unfortunately, if you are not petite, a teenager or a small child, you might not be able to fit this shirt.  If I  could have fitted the shirt, I would have definitely ordered more but I will be ordering more for my niece who loves the shirt. I received this item at a free/deeply discounted rate in exchange for nieces's honest opinion regarding this article of clothing!"
4.0,"I saw this item in a Macy's which made me interested in the item in the first place. I loved how petite it was and that it had two sections. I also appreciated how it had card slots already in the purse. But even though I got a fabulous deal on this item, and it came all wrapped, I returned it in the end. The reason why was because it could not hold my phone (Google Pixel 2XL) easily. It would fit but it would be a struggle to grab my phone and place it into the bag. Another problem was when you open the sides, I saw one side was cracked already. I know that this may come with wear, but it already had a crack in the glaze. I used to have a Michael kors handbag that I really enjoyed using, but three months after use it already had multiple cracks in the glaze, and I couldn't use the bag anymore because the cracks bother me too much.  Overallrable chic purse, I would recommend it for someone who is a minimalist or doesn't carry much like for date nights."
4.0,Really nice.  I like it! Fits nicely and looks good.
4.0,"Sunglasses work well. They are a little difficult to attach to the glasses but once they are attached, they work well."
4.0,"Well the shirt was fine except I was hoping for a little longer,,it's kinda ,"" boxy"" by picture it seemed different. But I'm not dissatisfied, material seems good ."
4.0,"followed the size guide and reviews, it fit perfectly. the dress is super well made and comfortable! I want to buy in every color!"
4.0,"I ordered this dress as I am always looking for new dresses for work.  This one seemed great for summer so I was very excited to receive it.  I am 5’5”, weigh about 125lbs and wear a 32D bra size.  I ordered a small and it is big on me especially in the top.  I can still wear it especially if I layer a sweater overtop as it hides the fact that it looks big in the chest.  The material is thicker, almost like thin denim.  The color and print are very nice.  Overall I like the dress I just wish that it fit better.<br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,four stars since it is very long
4.0,"They are very soft and comfy. They fit as expected but are a little long, but I'm also somewhat on the short side."
4.0,A little large but works since my son is still growing. Daughter wanted to dress as Flynn Rider and this was perfect for the cosplay!
4.0,Used for my son's birthday. He's 5 and it fit perfect. Gems fell off pretty quick but otherwise no complaints.
4.0,I love the look and feel of these masks but beware... They are so thick that people have a hard time understanding my words
4.0,It could be hard to put on but held &#34;the girls&#34; in place with high impact activities
4.0,Very nice colors until you get them a little dirty then they fade a little
4.0,"I'm 5'9"".  Would have liked it longer."
4.0,I would have given these a five-star but they came with no backs otherwise they're beautiful very satisfied
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty, and I look forward to wearing them. There was a minor issue with the item, and the seller took care of it with terrific customer service. I recommend purchasing from The Ultimate Collection."
4.0,Perfect for my intended use to pack items and clothes for a day trip or ride on the boat.  More zippered pockets than I expected which is a bonus. I hate digging for a small item that falls to the bottom. Love the color and distressed denim look.
4.0,FAIRLY GOOD. A BIT COMPLICATED GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE LENGTHY DOCUMENTATION...BUT SLOWLY ....
4.0,Nice for the $
4.0,"Got the black combo in the small size for a Halloween costume. Holy crap is it freakin cuuuuute! Surprisingly great quality for the price, fit pretty much like I figured it would. Honest my only “complaints” are 1) the corset is a tad too long for my body lol. I’m 5’1” and the dang thing sits almost right under my armpits! I pull it down a little but I’ve got a big butt so that pushes it back up. But hey, it is what it is. 2) it’s definitely a 2 man job getting this on. The eye hooks are something to get used to for sure and it took us a sec to figure out how to tighten properly. 3) This is super minor but I wish the skirt came packaged flat bc mine was crumpled up in the bag. It took me a little time to iron it out to where it would sit correctly.<br /><br />My complaints are extremely minor and I was able to fix or alter anything with ease and very little effort.<br /><br />Also it shipped/delivered a few days earlier than expected!!!"
4.0,loved the item but the waist didn't fit right for me
4.0,"I’m 5’3” and weigh 167 with my weight pretty evenly distributed. I ordered a large and with the elastic in the back they fit but would look & feel better if I were 5lbs lighter; so they’re kinda borderline. However, the picture shows these slacks as cropped length but on this 5’3” gal they fit as regular length slacks that don’t need to be hemmed. That works fine for me, but if you’re short & looking for a cropped pant be ready to do some hemming. The high waist is super cute & the brown & black pattern is perfect for fall!"
4.0,"Though there are three sizes to choose from when ordering, the Amazon description says there's only one size, and judging from the reviews, that seems to be the case. A woman size 8-1/2 who got size L says they fit her great and she thinks they'd be OK for down to size 7, which is about a men's 5-1/2. On the other end, a man with size-12-1/2 feet who also got size L says they're just a little small for him. A man who was expecting the size XL to fit men's size 9-11 says they seem to run small. The size L fit my men's 9-1/2-shoe-size feet very well.<br /><br />Taking all that into account, the Amazon description's claim that the one size fits men's shoe-size 6-12 and women's 7-13 seems to be about right, though they may be a little loose at the small end and tight at the large end of that range.<br /><br />They're snug on my not-very-thick ankles, so they stay up well. They may feel tight on more ample ankles.<br /><br />They claim to have 24% stretch fabric (Spandex and elastic). They're stretchy, but not more than other socks I have that only claim 1/10th that much.<br /><br />The style I received was called ""Light Gray"" when I ordered it, but it's actually the Camo Gray, with muted blue and red along with the gray. The blue and especially the red are fresher looking than in the Amazon photo. Not sure I'd wear these on the Fourth of July because of the gray, but they might be more suitable for September 11th.<br /><br />The colors aren't printed on, they're from different colors of thread. The threads have loose ends inside at the edges of the color patches. They're soft and spread out so I don't notice them while wearing.<br /><br />The toe seams are completely flat and imperceptible except at each end, where there's a small hard bump. Very comfortable that way.<br /><br />Ristake is a recent brand, from 2016, owned by Pei Yongping, which appears to be based in China."
4.0,"Love the hat and the neck warmer.  The neck warmer stays up...doesn’t slide down if you bring it up to keep your face warm.  My only complaint is that it washes so so, even in cold water it did shrink a little.  The hat is super warm and is perfect for cold winter hiking.  I might order this again in a different color but I’ll was it by hand in the future."
4.0,"It us exactly as described, just a lot larger than I was expecting, but I have added to the liner inside and it fits perfectly now. it is definitely &#34;Upturn Curled&#34; I am going to try to reshape the brim so as not so much upturn curl, but I am not worried, this had seems to be indestructible!"
4.0,nice look<br />fits as expected<br />feels good on feet all day long<br /><br />(probably not if I was standing all day long but works well with my desk job)
4.0,Designed part at the end of the thin back chain is missing ..apart from that this is a good piece. Little heavy. Gave it as a gift.
4.0,I love this watch band.  I only wish the clock face was a little bigger.
4.0,does the job however i have a butt so its a little tight around the lining edges since it isn't just fabric
4.0,"Fit well, felt comfortable, nice colors, matched perfectly my uniforms"
4.0,"Great pants! The shirt was smaller than expected, but I would go down a size on the pants. I returned the large for a medium."
4.0,Weird shape for my skinny build but still decent quality dress. True red. Love the simple scallop detail on the hemline
4.0,Good fit. Very attractive even on a slightly overweight older gal :)
4.0,"The way this watch was photographed I didn't see the circle of crystals surrounding the dial (they are really bright). Purchased this for my son. The flashing lights are amazing and multi-colored (and they don't blink constantly). The quality of the watch is fine, but it is clearly for a female even though masculine in style. For the price it was a great deal and the proprietor is most anxious to please the customer. Would have given a 5 star review for quality and customer service had it not been for that detail. A very handsome and useful watch otherwise. I probably didn't read the details in my haste to purchase it at a bargain price. Would be an excellent purchase for a girl/woman who likes to bike/walk/run after dusk. I'd use it myself but my son likes to play with the flashing light feature."
4.0,"We bought 3 of these (40x3=120pcs) for our reception at our wedding and they were a HUGE hit!  As soon as the DJ's put them out on the table, they DISAPPEARED!  Kids and adults alike really loved dancing with these and they turned out great in pictures!!!!"
4.0,"This purse (I use it for a purse) is nice. I needed something smaller than the huge messenger bag that I usually carry. I wanted something dressier and this fits the bill. I only gave it four stars because the zippers are so tiny. that's the only problem with it. It feels great, smells fine, and it's made well. The straps are just the right size. I should have bought two because if anything happens to it I'm going to want another."
4.0,"Looks like a Movado watch, keeps decent time, came more quickly than Amazon estimated.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the band.  It's OK but a bit fake looking (imitation leather).  Easily worth 4 stars for the money though."
4.0,I like the size of the earrings.
4.0,"They work great!  The color isn't exactly as advertised but I still like it.  I ordered the kids hot pink and purple as gifts as well and those were true to color.  But the matching teal ones are a little less vibrant and yellowish.  (even in daylight, not just my warm lighting in the house)  But I do recommend this brand. :)"
4.0,"Was just what I wanted , very comfortable."
4.0,"The gloves are exactly the type I like, but their measuring system is off. I went a size large than they recommend and they are too small."
4.0,"Bought these as gifts for my daughters friends. They loved them, seemed to shed a bit before they were washed. Good value for the price."
4.0,I usually ware medium.  I order both small and medium.  Medium was a bit to big but still look nice and the small fits like a glove.  Fabric is thin but not see thru.  Over all I am satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"I love all the pockets, not the material i was expecting.. obviously I must have not read too thoroughly but it is a nice material for just being able to wipe off but very casual purse."
4.0,Not real thick fabric very light but not see through
4.0,"I have naturally cold hands. My hands get uncomfortable when I'm drinking a beer outdoors in a chilly room. So I always wear gloves. These gloves do a decent job of keeping my hands from being exposed to cold air, but when it got pretty cold out, my hands didn't necessarily feel ""warm"". They work well enough, though."
4.0,"Very light and comfortable jacket. The hood is a bit tigh on my head, but I have thick hair :P I love that the zipper goes up almost to my nose when zipping all the way with the hood on, makes it warm and comfy. Oh.. great price for the good quality!"
4.0,Had to trim stay strings and some of the sewing isn’t the straightest but I’ve gotta day it’s still the best mask I’ve worn so far because it’s so breathable and light.
4.0,Nice shirt. Comfortable.
4.0,"The design looks great.  The shirt runs large, bought the shirt for my son.  He’s 9 and usually wears a 12 in boys. Got him a large and wish i would have went with a medium"
4.0,I like that it's big and sturdy for my ears. Not sure If this really is 925 sterling silver. I couldn't find any marking. It's a nice faux mother-of-pearl finish.
4.0,The socks is good but they are very small in size for my legs....However I have very big legs....
4.0,I got it for my mom and she love it
4.0,Unfortunately the print was upside down on the bodice :(
4.0,Slightly smaller than expected<br /> Not enough to send it back.
4.0,Me salieron muy grandes y la mayoría de los zapatos que hago son para bebés recién nacidos.. pero son muy buenos lo que hago es que las pico por la mitad y las hago más pequeñas
4.0,The shirt was great quality what I didn’t like was the low neck line....
4.0,"This is an OEM replacement for the band that came on my Casio Illuminator G-Shock wristwatch. The original band lasted over ten years (with several replacements of the strap retainer band as they wore out over the years). It is comfortable, reasonably durable and fool-proof.<br /><br />Removing the old band and installing the new one could have been easier had instructions been included. Fortunately, they are readily available on the internet, including in Amazon reviews. Including new mounting pins would have been nice too."
4.0,It is a cute little dress and I wore it twice this summer to casual outings.
4.0,it was a bit squashed in the package
4.0,"The dress is very pretty, and for $20? You can't beat it. It's a cute look for when you're on a budget! The only thing wrong with it, is the sizing. I bought my daughter a size 8 when she usually wears a size 6 or 7 shirt, and it is super tight! She was able to get it zipped up, but I'm scared it might rip. She only needs it one day, so for the price and the quality, it was worth the buy."
4.0,"This ring is beautiful. I would recommend this item. The price is right, with a good quality product. Our granddaughter will enjoy for few years."
4.0,"This dress is a good deal for the money.  I wasn't anticipating the quality to be as high as it is.  The top is a thick, stretchy material.  The color is a really nice plum.  The attached skirt's fabric is kind of weird, but no unbearable.  The top of the fabric is brushed with almost a flannel-like texture, but the fabric is stiff and heavy, almost curtain like.  It definitely wasn't what I expected, but it's not really that big of a deal and it does give the skirt some shape. There is no stretch to the skirt fabric.<br />I'm 5'10&#34; and the skirt hits me at my knees.  My waist is 32&#34;, bust 40&#34; (hips on this are free). I ordered a Large and it fits perfectly, so I would say if you're between sizes, to size down and not up.  It would be nice if this had pockets, but alas.  It's hard for me to find cute long-sleeved dresses to wear to work, but I like this enough that I'm going to purchase the other color variant."
4.0,I have bought at least 4 times ..they are nice colors but break 1 to 3 months...this last one broke in 3 days so pissed me off.
4.0,Not Water durable
4.0,Sleeves were a little snug on arms
4.0,fast delivery and fit is ok will keep your leg warm
4.0,"The bangles were beautiful, with nice weight to them but I wear a size 7.5 - 8. Couldn't get them over my hand.  I gave them to my daughter, she loves them."
4.0,"Like everything about this little housecoat.  Just right.  Fits perfect, looks good, nice and soft and light weight but still keeps the chill off. and you can't beat the price.  I have purchased two so far."
4.0,"These cufflinks are quite nice, but I find them to be too big, to the point that it makes the shirts a bit tight on the cuff."
4.0,Bought these pj’s as a gift.  They were a received and the new Mom said she through they were adorable.  I have bought these for my own grandkids plus adults and we loved them!
4.0,"Order a size or two larger and you are good to go. This shirt/jacket/dress is so cute, it did not disappoint. Looks just like the picture and the denim is good quality. The only drawback is that there are no holes for the button up areas so you will need to cut your own holes... but for the price, who cares!!!"
4.0,"I loved the look, the style, and the color! The was just one problem, it was way too big for my fiance. The face is really think and stuck out. It just ended up being too bulky. :/<br />Wish it could've worked out, beautiful watch.<br /><br />4 Stars because the gift box came pretty banged up."
4.0,Got a size M im 4’11 in height and this dress fit me slightly short. Cute and simple for summer
4.0,A little smaller than I would have liked but cute!
4.0,These are my 11-year-old daughter's favorite socks. She received them for a Christmas present and they've held up surprisingly well. The entire set is washed every single week and they've shown no tears or elastic fraying.
4.0,"I really like how this belt fits, just don't think I'd use it with a tucked in shirt/top."
4.0,I was impressed with quality construction.  It is very durable and stylish.  The overall quality and performance exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend this lighter for cigarillo smokers.  It would be excellent for cigarette smokers as well.
4.0,"Cute, but back fits odd.  Loose on the back near the neck.  The rest is great."
4.0,The chain is the cheapest chain you can imagine but the ornament is very nice.  I bought the white and black and for the price??? Great
4.0,"Got this for my wife.  She loves it, good quality and fit accept for the pant length was a little long for her medium size.  Had them altered.."
4.0,Go a half size up! Gotta return these due to the zipper taking up too much room in the back of the shoe
4.0,As is with Affliction items the graphics are unbeatably awesome. Shirt material is kind of thin. Will be a victim of belly holes.  Good for a wear or 2. I buy for the design.
4.0,"A little short for me , but stylish, not bad material, I think MakeMeChic has not bad produqts, but pricies sometimes are not adequate, its amazons problem in a whole."
4.0,Very heavy duty. Protects from water well. The only things I don't like is that it's too long and heavy. It drags the floor. I'm 5'2. And it's so heavy on my neck I have to raise the neck strap so my head isn't forced downward.
4.0,"This is dazzling, especially in bright sunlight.  Due to its weight, you need to pin it to some sort of heavy fabric.  It does indeed come with extra crystals, but only the extremely tiny ones- nothing larger than 2 mm."
4.0,Love this bracelet fits really nice have received multiple complaints on it. Very pleased.
4.0,Looks nice. Very warm and soft
4.0,"Too small and hot material for me, free so I gave it away"
4.0,"I ordered this suit for my boyfriend and it fit pretty good size XXXL  he is 6'1 and weighs 225 lbs. We we're worried it wouldn't fit because it's slim fit but, it fit him great. The only minor problem was the pants were too long but no big deal he can get them altered. I actually ordered this same suit from a different buyer in a XXL and the suit was cheap looking and super small. So, i suggest go a size up cause this suit runs very small but overall suit is great very good quality."
4.0,Wish it didn't have pins but it is so cute!!
4.0,The glue wore off.
4.0,"Very cute and sturdy hat, but too small too fit over my big hair most of the time!<br />I still squeeze it on, but wish I could find this style in a larger band size."
4.0,"I’m 5ft tall. I like my nightgowns 14-16 for comfort. This nightgown is very comfy but very long. When wearing them, the gown completely covers my feet. I can walk comfortably but can be tricky on stairs.<br /><br />If you’re taller than 5ft, you’ll be fine"
4.0,The rings look cheaper than the photos suggest BUT they were still a good buy and I would buy again.
4.0,"Super cute, but the fit is very large."
4.0,a bit on the large end
4.0,Love! So cute and great price!
4.0,"When I first got it I found it it was rather tight despite being in the size that I always wear. Taking an idea from another review where someone said that they stretched the hat while wet, I wet hat and then let it dry on my head. After that it was a perfect fit. However, I still do wish I could size it to be tighter on super windy days. It is fairly portable though."
4.0,"I have a large noggin, about 62cm or 24 5/8&#34; around. These fit, but only barely. Hasn't come off during play yet, but it's got about 1cm of velcro holding it on. Other than that, I love them."
4.0,"For reference I am 5'4"", 105 lbs. This was a well-made and warm sweater. The color was spot on. I ordered an xs, and it fit me more like a sweater dress. The classic tight fit was the same. The opening in the front was a tad bit wider than I would have liked, and it came down to about the halfway point from my rear to my knees. It was quite a bit longer on me than it was on the model in the picture. That is the reason I gave it 4 stars. I wanted to love it. I was hoping it would look the same as it does on the model. Most Pattyboutik tops do, but this one was larger."
4.0,"It's beautiful, and comfy, but too big,feels a bit sloppy, but still do able."
4.0,"So as with most yoga pants in this price range the quality is not amazong but also not bad.  I would say these will last a solid year with a couple uses a week.  That's pretty standard for these pants.  I have become for of an expert on yoga pants than I ever thought with my wife and daughters that means I have ordered more yoga pants than I thought I ever would.  I can say that these are a good example of decent quality and I don't think you'll be dissapointed with them.  A solid 4 star buy from me...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,"Product is exactly as pictured, well made. I wear size 8/10 and bought 2XL. Fit perfectly. My only complaint is that it is a bit short: 24.5 in long"
4.0,I have got these three times cuz they are cheap and i lose shades once a week
4.0,"The white’s more of a very pale spring green. I also didn’t realize there was an embroidered logo on the socks until I got them (the thread is whiter than the socks.) Otherwise, these are a very comfy, soft, warm pair of socks!"
4.0,Bought these for my husband and he didn't seem to mind them at first but now he's complaining about the fit in the back. I don't think the leg elastic has much long term hold... So I guess if you are flat in the back or don't mind not having full coverage these will still work for you(so long as you don't mind a bit of ride up). Either way I think they look quite nice.
4.0,I liked the bag itself..Its a perfect size to add items inside. I thought it was bigger but its a good size.. My brother enjoyed it!
4.0,They’re kinda like a knock off version of the characters but you get what you pay for
4.0,I though it'd be a little bigger bUT it fits snugly. Not a bad thing just a little small for me and my super thick hair.
4.0,This TYR Anti-Fog spray keeps the lenses on my Nest Pro goggles clear and I am swimming upwards of 2 miles per workout.
4.0,Is nice and a nice color
4.0,"Awesome sunglasses. Great fit. Dark lenses. Perfect size, not too big or small. The only reason I will take a star away is they don't have the Zoo York logo on the side like in the picture. Not a huge deal."
4.0,"Disclaimer: I received this outfit free through Amazon Vine in return for my unbiased review. I like the colors of this outfit, along with the gray stripe in the front of the top, with the 2 gray stripes on the arms. I think it's cute.<br /><br />I ordered a larger size than I normally wear because I want to be relaxed around the house. The elastic waist does not squeeze too tightly, which I really like. Sometimes, when the elastic on the waist is too tight, I change to a different set of pants. Especially if I wear them to bed.<br /><br />Next, the leg elastics are also comfortable; and I don't even notice them when I wear the pants. This feature adds to their comfort. I've worn some before that were not comfortable, but these are very relaxed fit.<br /><br />As for length, I usually wear short or petite pants, however; pant length is quite fine because of the elastic bands at the bottoms. They gather at my ankles, and they do not drag on the floor because of the elastic.<br /><br />I think a person with longer legs, or a taller person, would fit well in these pants, as well as a shorter person.<br /><br />It catches a lot of cat hair, but that could be my problem since I should dust more around the house!<br /><br />This is not sweatsuit material, so you might want to layer the top with a t-shirt underneath in cooler weather.<br /><br />I recommend this outfit!"
4.0,"Pretty, feminine, lightweight, in a nice stonewashed denim color.  Color is true to the pictures online."
4.0,"Good quality, excellent fit.  It is warm, but not thick.  Great for our walks when we need to often cover our mouths and noses.  Wouldn’t use in place of a mask in a store or when visiting others during Covid, but as a way to have coverage when passing others on the street it is very convenient to just pull up.  Great that it keeps neck warm at same time."
4.0,"I really like it, the color is great. It is a bit larger than I usually would purchase, but it is okay. It has wonderful pockets on the inside and actually enough room to put extra things in and keep my hands free. Which is a good thing these days."
4.0,But it still fits nice..
4.0,"This is lightweight, stretchy, doesn't hurt my head, covers my ears. My head is 23 inches. I wish it could be a bit more baggy then it is. Fits like a normal beanie rather then a baggy one. I'll wear this on warmer days cause its not thick. For the price couldn't go wrong.  Shipping didn't take too long,  got here within 2 weeks."
4.0,"Overall, i really do like the suit. However, it does not have the slits in the side, the way they exist in the bathing suit on the model."
4.0,"Very light material, hoping for more fitted. But okay for price."
4.0,"I liked this dress, it’s a little on the cheaper side in manufacturing but the price is right and I can wear this to work."
4.0,It was absolutely ❤️ and fit except the leopard at the bottom made it too song so my baby couldn't walk. She is very small. Other than that it is worth it.
4.0,Cool shirt but runs small.  I bought a adult small and it’s MAYBE a youth large or extra large.  Good thing I have a couple of kids.  Gave shirt to younger kid and will probably order another in a larger size for older.
4.0,Color slightly different from pic
4.0,Awesome slides I wear them a lot they are comfortable and go with many outfits
4.0,Nice sock. Comfortable.  But ran a little big in size.
4.0,Comes in a really nice packaging/tube. Takes some getting used to applying the liquid but holds the lashes pretty well.
4.0,Just opened the package and I pair has a run in it. Other than that they're nice underwear. Frustrated 😨 only gave3 stars because of the run.
4.0,What kind of material is this? My daughter loved it but there is no tag showing what it's made of.
4.0,"It’s the right size, which is always appreciated, but the material catches a LOT of lint. The print job is also unusually blurry. I doubt many people will care much about that. Favorite part is either the colors or the print on the back."
4.0,Nice drape and weight
4.0,"Perfecto para embarazo. A fresco, no es trasparente, elástico.<br />Buena compra y buen precio"
4.0,I bought a medium- but it is extremely tight. But the shirt is well made.
4.0,but my kid still loves it. Paired it with a blue hoodie and sweats with yellow knit gloves for an easy Huggy Wuggy costume.
4.0,Fit was great but color was quite a bit more red instead of maroon like I had hoped.
4.0,Very pretty top.  I get lots of compliments every time I wear it.
4.0,"Really liked the shoe and the color. Just wish the sole was a little more flexible feels a little hard , may have to be broken in. But good house shoe overall."
4.0,The color is nice. Not as thick as I thought it would be but I really like it. Perfect for California weather. I ordered M
4.0,The straps are a little twisted when I wear it but I think it's because it's a little too big on me. I am 5'8&#34; and 135 lbs and I usually like to wear a size large for the length but maybe the medium would fit better.  It's good quality and overall a nice shirt. I like it I would like it in white too.
4.0,comes undone a lot but I still have it.
4.0,"I am 5'7, 260lb, & normally wear a size 2XL (18-20). I ordered a 3x and it still clings to my body but not as much as a 2x would. I like my curves so I will be keeping it but definitely size up 2 sizes if you prefer it to be loose!!"
4.0,"Very cute. Slightly smaller than I expected, but I have a pretty large head. A little on the flimsy side, but light on the face and low cost so it makes sense."
4.0,Very pretty and exactly the right length for me.  I have a short neck.
4.0,Very pretty ring and comfortable too.
4.0,runs a bit big. a little low cut and the support would be low to moderate. wish the straps were adjustable. I m a 36 c and medium worked best.
4.0,"honestly at first I was really disappointed because when it came it was one of those hats that have a flat rim. which looks silly and like a kids hat. but I bended the rim and now it looks a lot better. Also the words are a little to big and 3D looking, it looks different then the picture they show you. but it fit great, it was slightly to big but it wont fall off. perfect for going to the range or daily use."
4.0,"Really like this, took a while to get here."
4.0,"These bras are so easy to unclasp and reclasp while nursing. The bra pad folds completely down for full breast exposure if needed. But will also hold upright when not clasped. The padding gives added support, while still feeling like a comfortable sports bra. The shoulder straps are a little small, but I've found they stretch over time. One strap did snap at the seam when I first put it on, but easy to fix. I also have to use the back clasp extenders to feel more comfortable."
4.0,Cute. But they are huge.
4.0,Love the organic plugs mu ear dont have a bad odor when I wear them like with the stainless steal
4.0,Little one loves her tutu! It's very full and well made.
4.0,"While I do love this keychain, it loses a star because the screw to the horseshoe shaped key ring has already fallen out causing my keyless remote to fall off my keychain. If I would have been in a public place, this could have been a very bad situation! Instead, I had just parked my truck and shut my door when my truck alerted me to my remote being left in the vehicle. That's when I looked down at my hand and realized my remote was no longer on my keychain. Definitely lost a star for that!<br /><br />There needs to be some way to keep that screw from falling out, causing keys to fall off the ring. There should also be a few spare screws included with the keychain, for these types of situations. Other than that, this is a very pretty keychain with just the right amount of sparkles and bling to make a woman's heart happy. 😊"
4.0,Small that I expected but nice
4.0,Great transition piece into fall in the mid Atlantic.
4.0,"The shirt is super cute and good quality. It's a little small, but I'm still wearing it. I feels like junior sizing."
4.0,Nice quality pendant but tiny and dainty.
4.0,Good shirts.
4.0,Went with XXL after XL was too small ...It was still snug...wear an XL in every other shirt.<br />Customer service did contact me to remedy the problem.
4.0,Purchased for my grandsons for Christmas.  They loved them.
4.0,Looks great.  Wanted something to make the Fitbit Alta look a little more like jewelry and this does.  Easy to attach.  It is long and I had to remove 4 links.  I have an average size wrist and it did come with a tool to remove links.  Searched for a video on  youtube on how to do this and had it done within 15 mins.  Would purchase again.
4.0,"This dress was a bit big on me around the waist. That was the only thing I disliked. I got an XL and i shouldve went with like a medium maybe. Other than that, it's gold metallic and is a good length, it's comfortable too!"
4.0,"Advertised as expandable, however does not expand. Besides the false advertisement good set of suitcases."
4.0,"I really love these water shoes. They are super flexible and comfy and super cute! The quality is really great also! I just wish they would have stayed on my little guys feet a bit better. When he was sitting or being held they were totally fine, but for crawling they slipped off pretty easily. I will definitely keep using them, and I think they will work great for when he is actually walking!"
4.0,like it a lot but i like the older version much better
4.0,"These seem a little thin, but they do have a terry lining.  They run small.  The XXL that I purchased are more like a large, but they will be ok.  I think it's a good value for the money."
4.0,"I love these yoga pants.  The only complaint is that I had pills on them after washing.  I discovered they need to be turned inside out when washing and do not put them in the dryer, instead let them air dry."
4.0,"At least with this watch I could reset for my time easily. It's thin, light-weight, not as rugged as I was looking for but it serves it's purpose without randomly going off like the last one I bought."
4.0,"LOVE the hat!  But, this one was slightly ""bent"" in the shipping.  I believe we can continue to work with it to remove the crease on the edge of the cap (where the main portion meets the mesh)."
4.0,Peso 107 lbs<br /> En vivo se ve color rojo pero en la foto se ve color burgundy<br />Muy lindo y comodo
4.0,They are comfortable even though they were smaller than expected going by the size.
4.0,"Stay away-horrible quality.<br />These tights seemed like a deal but too good to be true. Horrible quality, holes pulls and runs after 1- 3 wears. Wish I could have returned them as a complete waste of money and lasted about 3 dance classes tops before had to be thrown away."
4.0,Larger size than expected.
4.0,Pretty good all in all. It's exactly as you see it.
4.0,I ordered this on a lightning deal. It's very soft. I ordered xxl because it was said to run small. I normally fit into a large top. I'm a short 160 lbs. It's  made in China. I was looking to buy American made but got sucked into the deals of the day. 😜
4.0,The shirt is exactly as advertised: good quality (but not great) and cheap. Exactly what I was looking for. Do not expect the quality of a $50 hoodie from this but expect to be satisfied.
4.0,"The ear piece started sliding out of the metal after a few months of light use (keep them in my car).  For the price, not surprised.  Nothing a little super glue didn’t fix. Have received compliments on them from dates and coworkers."
4.0,"These tops are one of my go to’s now, only complaint is that the bottom of the top isn’t form fitting on me. might just be me though."
4.0,"Absolutely love love love these leggings! I got them in the xs and they perfectly fit my petite 5ft frame. Workout leggings are usually too long on me and scrunch up at the ankles, but I don’t have that problem with this brand! The material is so comfy to workout in and I love the level of compression. The only down side is that the lighter colors are NOT squat proof. I had no problem with the grey charcoal. But the dark pink/pink ombré and the steel blue did not pass the squat test. Will be ordering the darker colors from now on"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:41a1bebbd28d35f219e3f7f9afaf6717]] Needed these mask for a Mardi head theme event and they were nice but one broke very easily so delicacy is needed. Nice buy. Using them again soon
4.0,"Top fit really well but, the bottoms fit a size small. I wish I would have ordered a size larger"
4.0,Beautiful and very well made.  A great deal for the money.  I love them because you can wear them with anything and everything.
4.0,Bought about 2 weeks ago an wore for the first time today due to new job. Put them on an not even 5mins later clamp to adjust length broke. Very disappointed with the product.<br /><br />Update.<br />Talked with customer service ( wade ) excellent chat an got everything fixed. Great company to work with.
4.0,"This is a very thin ""sweatshirt"", I'm going to have to swear another sweater under it to keep warm. It is large enough that I can wear another bulky hoodie under it, and I'm not a skinny person. :) The color is nice, though."
4.0,The price was a joke... so I thought that you receive what you have paid for. But the earrings are fairly good. The gold was rose gold as I needed so... I am very happy with them.
4.0,High Quality. Very nice. Late delivery.
4.0,These plugs are great.<br />I highly recommend them to anyone.<br />They fit perfectly and now I outsized them but they were good.
4.0,ok but was expensive
4.0,Very cute. I was looking to show a bralette that had more detail near the shoulders. I didn’t keep it because it was a little<br />Short on my stomach. Had it been just a tad longer I would have kept it any ways. The back is adorable. The material is smooth and breathable. Great for summer. :).
4.0,"My old leather gloves were wearing out after years of use, so I got these.  They are lighter weight (constructed more like a woman's glove) but they fit well and are good for driving.  They look dressier than the old gloves.  They are warm enough while running errands in winter, but probably not for a long walk on a cold winter day.  They would not suitable for shoveling snow, but I have other, heavy duty gloves for that.  After wearing these gloves for a couple months, I am satisfied with them, and hope they will stand up to a few years of use."
4.0,This type of watch band is comfortable and easy to use.
4.0,Came on time. Pack of 4. Looks like a cut sleeve.
4.0,"it fits perfectly, nut material feels very cheap"
4.0,"Very cute swimsuit and very flattering.  I am larger on the bottom than the top, so the top is a bit large, but I can make it work with some inserts."
4.0,"Fine for me..... but a man with a big neck, it would be tight."
4.0,Color fades a bit with 1st wash.
4.0,"can't wait for the larger size, larger size came in and very comfortable. Just recommend ordering at least a half size up"
4.0,"The glasses are very lightweight and the blue tint is nice, but I believe that they said somewhat crooked. And not on the temple arms but rather it seemed that the actual frame around the lenses was connected to the bridge slightly askew. It may have just been the sunglasses I received, so I didn't want to give too bad of a review because otherwise they are pretty good for the price."
4.0,Fairly thin. I have 48&#34; waist. Just fits
4.0,"Cute dress, but I will need to wear with leggings as it is a little short for me."
4.0,Nice quality sock.  Would get the Large for a size 9.5
4.0,They're very cute but fits my boyfriend too snug and fits my small wrist to big. Wish there was size options but overall nice.
4.0,For as expected. A nice top. Should band is very tight but it fits.
4.0,"This jacket is very warm and very cozy, but it does run a bit small. I'm usually a L/XL but I bought a XXL based on the other review and I'm glad I did. It fits but is a little close and doesn't leave me with a lot of room for layers. The buttons look a little cheap, but it has a nice silhouette, and is comfortable and inexpensive."
4.0,Worth the price and the quantity. I finally am able to wear short sleeves and haven't got any burns. After few washings the lighter colors ended of looking like a rag though.
4.0,"I love these for wearing when hiking or cycling, but they would be perfect if they had a nose wire to keep glasses from fogging up, and to prevent spread of virus."
4.0,It is a beautiful dress! I felt it ran somewhat small but I could still wear it.
4.0,"This is a good find for th price! Heavy weight stretch jersey Fabric so it’s good for colder weather. The pockets are great and the dress is well made. I am always a size 8 in dresses 34dd and I ordered a medium which fits well. The arms aren’t too snug or the chest so I’m happy with the size, it seems to run true to size. The neck line is a bit higher than it looks in the pictures and the length on me (5’4”) is true maxi length. It was way too much stripes for this neckline and all the way maxi length so I hemmed it to knee length and it’s a great dress now! I will post both pics how it is delivered and after I cut it. The price is great and worth the effort of hemming it."
4.0,"Love love love this shirt! It fit a little smaller than I expected. The picture depicts a loose fit. No. It fits but it’s not loose. I bought my normal size. Other than that, I LOVE IT. Super cute, soft, thick, warm!"
4.0,"I had this wallet for roughly a week or so and its been great.  Needs some breaking in but it's minimal size forces you to limit what you put into it.  That's a good thing.  There is, however, so glue residue in certain pockets which is causing some of the cars to stick into their spaces.  It's also leaving a sticky residue on the cards once they're pulled out.  Other than that, its great."
4.0,I'm giving this 4 stars because they seem to just compress at the top of the sock. I do believe it helped on a recent 12 hr flight.
4.0,"It fit as expected.  It's tight in a body-hugging way but not too tight.  I love the length of the dress and it was surprisingly soft and not sheer, thank goodness."
4.0,I love this sweater. Super cozy. Because of the material - it’s very very warm. Too warm for most SoCal winter days but perfect for sitting in the stands for 7pm little league games. Fits oversized which I love. Bought a L my normal size.
4.0,Immediate difference!
4.0,The fit is spot on and the buttons easy to use. The only reason I don't give five stars is because there is no belt clip. I haven't dropped it yet to see how well it holds up but I'm sure it will handle a drop.
4.0,"Dress is a good quality, much better than I expected for the price.  It is a nice material, and not too thin.  Does run a little small, I am normally a womens 14 and the XXL was a little snug in chest area.  I bought three dresses and love them all."
4.0,Fabric is pretty and it's made pretty good for the price - but it is not the sheer look that's so popular.  Returned.
4.0,Great pair of sunglasses! They have a great fit and don't look cheap at all.
4.0,Like how it easily adjust to the correct size.  The extra belt loop is hard to keep track of.
4.0,The Material wasn't what I was expecting but the dress had a good fit to it.
4.0,"Love the fit and feel of this shirt. It’s not as vibrant as I hoped so I deducted a star, but I don’t think it was meant to be bright. Either way, it’s a nice shirt and I’ll probably order the other colors a different time.<br /><br />For sizing information for me: 178 lbs, 5’4”, 38DD.... Short torso, so shirt is lengthy on me as I hoped it would be. I’m not sure how long it would be for someone with a longer torso, but it comfortably flows right around/slightly below the belt line."
4.0,"It was bigger then expected, but I purchased 5. One for me and 1 for each of my 4 daughters."
4.0,Not plush or cushiony but they are comfortable and they did help reduce my pronation. They were especially helpful when standing a long time/walking a lot.
4.0,Great necklace to dress up any outfit.
4.0,"These earring are gorgeous and exactly as pictured and went wonderfully with my dress. I took away a star because they were so heavy on my ear lobes I felt them pulling/stretching on my pierced holes. I still wore them, but couldn’t wear them for long periods."
4.0,The material is very light and thin! Definitely needs something under it.
4.0,I really love this hat. It is perfect for the spring and summer and goes well with many of my outfits. Although I am a woman I feel it's not out of place with the floral design. I find it really comfortable and sometimes forget I have it on.
4.0,"The only reason I gave the dress 4 stars is because it runs a little big and I'm pregnant. I prefer form fitting dresses that accentuate the waist, though. I would recommend you order a size smaller if you prefer a tighter fit. If you prefer comfy loose, then order your size."
4.0,"This cut of this dress is flattering. The fabric is stretchy and comfortable. There isn't any lining, so you can feel some of the seams, which is not the best case scenario. I will be wearing a slip with it. The colors are bright and pretty. I would recommend."
4.0,Did not like much aybe because of the color I choose olive green.
4.0,"About a size too small. I like to wear XL for a little more room, ordered this in a 2XL. 2XL fits like an XL. Also the pics here are airbrushed and good detail..the hoodie, not so much. So if you are looking for something fun to wear, go for it. Remember, its a hoodie, not a costume."
4.0,Great for the price .
4.0,little tight for me
4.0,The ties arrived as promised in good condition. Because these ties are for an event they don't have to be of high quality. They will serve their purpose.
4.0,I just bought a spinning but but seat is so hard it was painful to ride it.. I wear the padded shorts and bought a padded seat and I can spin for 40 minutes without too much discomfort!! So glad I bought them
4.0,"Nice fit, light and comfortable love the zipper pockets."
4.0,Very professional looking.
4.0,They are very pretty just a bit smaller than I expected.
4.0,"It is a nice product but the top is too small.,  It would be better if they offered separate sizes for tops and bottoms.  Otherwise, it is cute and got here on time."
4.0,"Exactly as it looks. Ordered a large,got a large buuuut it fits like medium."
4.0,Great price and comfortable. Very effective at blocking out sun glare on water!
4.0,Love these glasses.  Just wish they were a bit darker.
4.0,Great little purse that fits all my essentials... I gave it four stars because the zipper was not completely sewn and I had to finish sewing to myself.
4.0,So i ordered a xl cause i read it runs small but they sent me a large instead..it does fit but i think afther one wash it will shrink so i hope it doesn't..but it was just like the photo..just remenber you get what you pay for...
4.0,"these sweatpants are men's, but i got them for myself to wear around the house. they're made with a type of cotton material that is super comfortable. the cuffs at the bottom aren't the elastic kind that drive me nuts, they're just more fabric that fits around your ankles so they're easy to wear around your ankles or your calves as capri like pants. they have a drawstring that easily tightens or loosens the pants. the fabric is made well; they're not fringing or ripping in any way. the fabric is thick enough to keep you warm without being too thick to make you sweat. they keep your body at the perfect temperature. great for lounging and again, soooo comfortable. this was a great find and i got them for free!"
4.0,nice hat proud to wear it
4.0,"I followed the chart size and while the fit is good everywhere else, the bust is a no-go...I'm not a huge gal but this is simply too tight for anyone who is not fairly small in the bust. Otherwise a tidy, neat looking little dress that is versatile and good looking."
4.0,the hat needed be a bit longer... cause when some one rolls up the bottom.. the Never forget is not there any more and that's the funniest thing about the hat.
4.0,"This is a very sweet little watch, and is definitely worth the low price. My one remark is that the band seems unusually short. I have small wrists, and I have to use the 4th out of 7 holes to buckle it comfortably. I usually use the smallest or next to smallest option on watches. This would likely not fit someone with large wrists because the band is not long enough. Otherwise I love the rose gold color with the grey band. Plus the silver face makes it able to be warn with silver jewelry."
4.0,I was satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Lots of compliments on the swimsuit! The bottom fits perfectly, but the top cops are on the large side and my chest is not."
4.0,"At this price, the quality of the shoes is good. Only cons is that the size runs too small. My daughter wears size 10, I ordered 11 at first, after reading some reviews. But it turns out that size 11 is a little tight (it may be stretched after used, but it may not fit her couple months later). So I returned and ordered 11.5, which is perfect size for her. Good thing is that it is free return."
4.0,Bought one black and one white.  They have become a winter staple under dresses and blouses .  I just wish it was a little longer.  And it makes me feel cute.
4.0,Beautifully made. I am very excited to give it as a gift.
4.0,"Really cute!' would be great with leggings. But the waist is really high, like empire,so that's why I am returning them. But otherwise they are cute."
4.0,"Got this for a present and it looks really good, the only thing is that it is a little tight for the ID, but other than that it was a great purchase!"
4.0,HAS A TON OF ROOM. Bigger than I expected for my small purse.
4.0,Bought these for Christmas for my kids. Love the colors. They are a little big for small heads but they enjoy wearing them.
4.0,Very nice looking. The back pin protector seems to fall off quite often.
4.0,"I've only used this apron a few times since it arrived. So far, I really like it. Helps to keep my clothes from getting ruined when I'm in the kitchen. The only drawback is the fact that you have to put it over your head to put it on. Other then that, it's a good buy, especially for the price. I'm 5'7 and the ties rest right at my waist."
4.0,"Great for what it really is, a simple cloth mask that fits around neck, a little tight though and I have a 17” neck.  Does not provide protection if you’re looking for something to wear during pandemic.  Easily fails flame test.  Otherwise okay if just needing to mask your face."
4.0,"Somewhat small, very cute though! Perfect valentines gift!"
4.0,"This is much smaller than I expected, however it is a great little dressing slip."
4.0,"I will make your feet super hot.  So be prepared to switch footwear for the day and probably a change of socks if you are prone to sweaty feet.  I don't have sweaty feet but I have found I need to change socks because it makes my feet that hot if I where it in doors as well as outdoors for the day.<br /><br />Also, this is a wide fitting bootie.  You might need to double up in socks if you don't have a pudgy foot."
4.0,This is my favorite piece of jewelry!  High quality and I have received more compliments on this necklace than any other jewelry I have ever worn.
4.0,"The colors are exactly as pictured above! Super soft, breathable fabric that feels good on my skin! Fits great, I’m 5 feet 6 inches, 175 lbs, 38B and typically a M/L in bottoms and tops! I bought a large and they fit wonderful!"
4.0,Purchased as a gift. They loved it and it fit great. Very soft material. Takes a while to arrive from shipping location.
4.0,Big  and comfortable
4.0,The tail seems thin but otherwise great. Will fit a kid perfectly.
4.0,"Really comfy, wide band so no bra bulge. It looked very small taking it out of the package but it stretches nicely."
4.0,These are cute. More fragile than expected. Will have to be extra careful
4.0,I think I will like it but I can't find a way to close it......can anyone help with that???  Afraid I will break it if I pull as hard as it seems I have to ...
4.0,Robe is a good value for money. I do like less of a neckline for the summer.
4.0,"The is a well constructed wrap.  The seam are strong and I believe it will be durable over time.  My only critique is that it has not stretch or give in the fabric that makes using this for not only ""fashion"" but practically to lay down Black natural hair."
4.0,I bought a medium be I usually am... Should've bought a large.. The sizes on here run small. Over all it's a good product
4.0,Very cute for a St Patty’s Day wedding. It is very small and delicate. Dropped a star because of the color. It is very obvious that it is fake.
4.0,The metal part is great but would be better if on a leather band than a “vegan” one.
4.0,I love these and they are very comfortable but also because they are a bit baggy on me so I'm gonna keep these for when I want a comfy day and order a size smaller and see if it gives the look I was hoping for
4.0,"Nice fit, I liked that it was somewhat large around the stomach area but it was a little tight in the chest. So if you're big chested maybe go up a size. I'm 150 lbs, 5'8, and a 36C/D"
4.0,Loved this dress! My only critique is that if you have small boobs it can be a bit loose around the bust/ neck line. I put some fashion tape on it and it solved the problem easily!
4.0,Bought a size 4 for my 13 year old niece for her cotillion. Nice dress but fit a little to snug . she wears between a 2 and 4. aside from that very nice
4.0,I like the shape but very light weight
4.0,These glasses certainly stand out with their walnut wood temples. They provide excellent protection from the sun's UV rays and are especially comfortable while driving for long periods of time.
4.0,Enhances my gifts
4.0,I will not be able to dry it...touch small and hubby who normally wears a large so I'd recommend going one size up.
4.0,Good value compared to other running shorts. LOVE the zip pocket in the back
4.0,"Fit was as expected. However, the crouch was too high so the front looked a tad off. I’m 5’8 maybe for someone shorter."
4.0,Very nice n soft
4.0,Works great for carrying a phone when you have no pockets. The clear screen is nice also so that I can look and touch screen through it without having to get the phone out. It would be better if the phone part was a little more snug and the over flap gave just a little more room so that I can snap it closed when I carry my  battery charger in it without a problem.
4.0,"I like this glasses, they are affordable, simple and unique in its own way. And I feel like every colour will look good on anyone"
4.0,"I like this, but beware when you wash it...or even just wearing it, the fringe comes off easily.  Other than that, it is a lovely cover up..."
4.0,I brought it for a gift and she loves it & it looks great on her!!
4.0,Good fabric and sewing. Washed 1 time and the handkerchief was soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Loved it over leggings,  especially in the plus size. Buy this type of top often for a plus sized person"
4.0,"I am more familiar with unisex & plus sizes, so it was probably my mistake. I usually wear an XL in unisex sizes, so I ordered a size up, XXL. It is not a tight fit, but it has less ease and is shorter than most of my sweatshirts."
4.0,"I am a 10/12 Misses normally. This product looked nice, but ran extremely small. The fit seemed more appropriate for junior sizing."
4.0,Very attractive..my hubby wears a medium but when he put this on it was too big.  It said skinny...but it’s not skinny..
4.0,XL fits size 36 to 38. I'm size 36 and they fit perfect.
4.0,"This was a beautiful dress, looked just like the picture, and was a very breathable fabric. The only issue is the arm size. My arms aren’t too large but this fit really tight around them."
4.0,"It’s too see through for my taste. Length is great! Fabric is too much spandex, was hoping for maybe a double layer. Color is nice! It’s just slightly too flimsy for my workout needs. They’re more for wearing with a longer T-Shirt to take a walk/stroll."
4.0,I am 5'4&#34; and I weigh 150lbs This designed fit my body shape very well.
4.0,"I purchased the dark grey dress in size medium.  For reference I am 5'5, 138 pounds, with a hip measurement of about 38-40 inches.  The color was more of a blue-grey.  It's a lovely color, just not what I was looking for.  The material is soft and stretchy.  I am returning only to get a different color and size large.  I don't like clothing to be too tight on my stomach (it has a bit of fluff that I like to conceal).  The way it sits on the body is nice, just a little too tight for comfort in my opinion.  It was not too short."
4.0,"The material is less ""light and flowy"" than I expected. It's sort of like a premium t-shirt material. It's cute and really is very flattering in front if you have a belly. I have a flat butt and no hips, so maybe should just stay away from bodycon altogether, because I don't care for how straight it looks."
4.0,"I got this and it looks a little cheap but i still like it. It is long and i wouldn't recommend this to people with a very large head, because it does not UN-lach and it barley fits on my head."
4.0,"Super comfy, didn't ride up while working out,  doesn't limit movement, really like this line."
4.0,Great deal! Looks like you think it would.
4.0,"it is ok, a little stiffer than the picture"
4.0,"A little hard to put on because the shoe doesn't flex much.  Once on, quite comfortable.  the fabric is scratchy on the edges so you may get a heel blister if not protected ( i used a band aid).  Overall a great shoe--I love the way it looks.  I haven't been able to wear heels in years (bunions) but this shoe actually works for me!"
4.0,"Nice heavy chain, good deal for the price"
4.0,These are made of a really soft material. I love the color as well! It's hard to find a really great red in pj's. I bought the same size but these are smaller. Buy a little bigger to be comfortable.
4.0,It is just a tiny tiny bit too small. Like maybe half a size. It may just be the fit of it though.
4.0,"The crystal looks very nice but they earrings themselves are bigger than I wanted. Also, turned out that I can totally wear stainless steel or any other silver-looking metals but “fake gold” looks terrrible on me. Return.<br />I didn’t expect it to be gold, of course.<br />Otherwise they are beautiful."
4.0,The fabric and color is beautiful.  It fit great but was too tight arpund my rib cage. This was an XL and I wear a size 14-16.  Other than that it is a well made dress
4.0,Got these after my Daughter told me my old sunglasses looked awful on me...She likes these.
4.0,"Purchased as a gift for a 7 year old.  I really liked it, but, thought it was a little too grown up looking for 7 year old...so I gifted to a 12 year old, instead and she loved it!!"
4.0,These insoles are pretty comfortable but they definitely run small and they are not supportive enough for my plantar fasciitis. The smell coming out of the box is a little strong and there were little specks that I had to wipe off on the product but nothing that affects the overall quality. I felt like they are a bit narrow and compared to some of the other bigger brands It's almost as good.
4.0,Looks good and great deal.
4.0,Nothing can come good in this price .. god gifts for everyone
4.0,The shirt was exactly what we expected
4.0,It’s somewhat what i expected.. the fabric is decent. The downfall is that it fit me a bit big unbuttoned. It’s missing a button on one of the wrist next to the zipper with two small holes.
4.0,Looks good.  The black coating wears off quickly though.  Also the clasp doesn't always close properly and takes some playing with to get it good and hooked.  Not bad for the price though and still beats the heck out of the plastic thing it originally came with.
4.0,The fit is great and it is super comfy. I wish though that the print was a little darker to be seen easily.
4.0,"This is my favorite style of robe that I've tried over the past few years. I have a similar kimono style robe with a lovely brocade print, but I really like having this option of a solid black robe. I don't wear robes every single day, but when I have to run to the bathroom at night and kids are up, or guests are staying with us, or I just want an extra layer, this is nice.<br /><br />What I like:<br />-Fabric: This satin type fabric feels lovely! It also slides across cotton sheets really well- bonus.<br />-Fit: The robe is loose and flowing and fits really comfortably. It comes with a sash for cinching it in around your waist.<br />-Design: Inner tie! I love the inner tie on this robe. I've experienced robe sashes coming undone because of the slippery fabric before, but this robe has an inner tie so even if the sash comes off, the robe doesn't fall open. The robe also has pockets, which are handy although I'm not sure what I'd need to put in them (rubbers!?)...<br />-Appearances: My husband thinks me wearing this is a signal to head to the bedroom and lock the door. It's safe to say he thinks it looks really great, and I like that it's comfortable. Both of us are happy!<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />-Tiny little loose threads on the inside of the robe. It looks like the inner seams on the sides haven't been finished/serged, so I'm guessing if it's washed, more threads will come loose.<br /><br />Overall this robe works great for me; I really like having the kimono style robe in a nice solid color. It fits well, looks nice, feels good, and is a convenient cover up.<br />{Sample provided for review}"
4.0,"Definitely a great little bag and the price was fair although I truly question the authenticity. For another $25 or $30 I think if I had to do it again I would just purchase an authentic VB. Although it comes with the label, tag, and such, I noticed a few differences from those I have purchased from authorized VB retailers. Not to mention the interior is not that which was advertised. I received a rose pattern. Incidentally I now realize the rose pattern and the one advertised are not shown in any authentic VB outlets or retailers. Still serves it’s purpose and to the average person, a quick glance would not give away that it is a knock off. Bag easily holds several items and the back slip pocket accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max without issue."
4.0,"I wish the nose part was a tad more comfortable, but it’s great value for the money!"
4.0,"This necklace is really cute! It is easy to put on and goes with any outfit. My only complaint is it already began to tarnish. Nothing major, but just thought it would’ve lasted a little bit longer without tarnishing. I still love it though!"
4.0,Femenine and comfortable
4.0,"Works excellently, only issue is its hard to change ISO or Dial in your F stop while wearing the strap."
4.0,I have a small narrow almond face. I was nervous that I'd look like a bug. But they looks great. Nod to Jackie O.
4.0,"Nice fabric, bottom of blouse seemed fuller in picture then as received. But still a nice addition to my closet."
4.0,The outfit was beautiful but delivered late
4.0,"Very comfortable shirt.  It is a nice option for casual wear, goes well with many types of bottoms.  The material seems to be sturdy and washes well.  I would buy this shirt again.  The package came on time and was just as expected."
4.0,Just like the photo. True to size. When I got it in the mail it was very stiff but just threw it in the wash and it was fine. Wear a white or nude bra.
4.0,"It's always a little challenging ordering clothing online since we can't try the item on. I wear a size 6 dress so I went with the XL. I was happy with it save that it definitely suits women with a larger bust size than I have (I'm a C cup). It's very soft and very comfortable but with a ruched style that's great for those of us with a softer tummy, it does a great job of disguising mine.<br /><br />My suggestion is that if you're smaller of bust you order a size down for a snugger fit through the chest. Otherwise it's a cute top that pairs well with jeans for day or dresses up with a pencil skirt for evening.<br /><br />Note: I received a complimentary product for review.

4.0,Love this dress! Can wear at work or a night out!
4.0,This was a pretty bracelet but the picture of the violin in on the charm is just too small.
4.0,This meet my expectations and fit well.
4.0,I liked how this romper fit. Great for the summer. Good material but I think you have to iron it before wearing it.
4.0,Perfect necklace for my runner granddaughter - the sterling silver runner is a bit smaller than I had envisioned.
4.0,I like the bag but it’s heavy so when you pack it it’s even heavier.  So FYi. If you don’t lift weights and don’t like carrying heavy things then this isn’t for you. Unless you let your “man” or your butler carry it for you.
4.0,The art is ok For the price It’s a little loose tho If you cut it right it can look cool Big fan of zero ha
4.0,Great for the price. Quick drying
4.0,my husband enjoys wearing these whimsical socks. they fit as expected and colors are vibrant.
4.0,Can wear with various outfit to accent your look
4.0,Nice fabric and pretty but very very long.  I purchased a large and had to get it altered - 4.5 inches removed from the bottom.
4.0,"Decent plastic for the price, a tad bit small... Should probably say it's child sized. Hehe"
4.0,"I already have a brown Scala from Amazon and a tan hat from Golden Gate Hat Company. I wanted a forest green hat. The photo used on the Amazon ad is the color I wanted. The hat I received was basically brown with a slight green tone when it's in the sunshine. The Woolrich hat looked a tad off center. The middle of the brim didn't quite line-up with the front center part of the crown. The other minor issue is the hat isn't made in the USA, it's made in China.  Otherwise, it is a nice and good looking hat."
4.0,"I really think this is so cute, but it's too small for my iPhone.  I emailed the seller for an exchange, but they said not to send it back as postage would cost more to send it back to China.  They told me they would give me 20% off another cover that fit.  I reordered thru Amazon again, so I'm not sure how they can tell that my order is the one that should be 20% off.  It's not expensive, so I'm not going to worry about it."
4.0,Accurate website description.
4.0,It cleans leather well but doesn't work on mesh that has been dirty.
4.0,easy to use!
4.0,"Bought for my dad , he lives that they’re easy to get on and off , he said they are comfortable"
4.0,"Very pleased with these pants overall, but they run a little large. After laundering the first time, I was very disappointed about how wrinkled they were. I normally never iron!"
4.0,"This is a really nice looking, soft dress.  The material is like a heavy t-shirt, the material is very forgiving - has some stretch to it.  The dress can be dressed down or dressed up for work.  Normally, I would love this dress and the style, but unfortunately, I've put on a few pounds since working from home this year and the dress just makes me look pregnant.  Not the dress's fault. :)"
4.0,I like the heel chains.  Brought two different designs.
4.0,(32DDD 4’10 130) the top fit nicely but the shorts are kinda small. Very comfortable fabric and looks like the picture. Headband needed to be bent as it was very straight and didn’t curve to the forehead. Overall pretty pleased
4.0,"Good, solid wallet. Gets scratched pretty easily. But really good build. I love it and I’m sure I will keep this wallet for as long as I can. It’s perfectly crafted to fit about 14 cards. It is a tight fit of course but perfect for fast movements"
4.0,"It has good weight to it. The ring will turn your finger green, so put clear nail polish on it and keep it away from water."
4.0,"Great wallet and holds all my cards, cash, and documents I carry around with me. It has eleven card slots and one see thru ID card slot. There are two paper money compartments which comes in handy when I’m traveling carrying Euros and dollars. My only minor complaint is that the wallet is about one and one eighth inches thick fully loaded, but that is my fault. Also it is a little clumsy taking out bills with the extra flap. But, hey, I wanted that extra flap. So, there are some trade offs. For me it is a keeper. Very well made. In a previous life I did some leather work."
4.0,Great house shoes but definitely runs small. My size 11s fit more like 10s. Trying to break in but may have to exchange for larger size
4.0,"My son is a catcher and he uses this to cool down between innings. Works well, but after less than 2 weeks of use, 1 broke"
4.0,"Jeans are fantastic. But the material in the pockets feel very cheap. Otherwise, I love them"
4.0,"So so so pretty.  I purchased this lace belt for my daughter to wear with her farmhouse rustic wedding dress.  It is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!  The lace belt is 4&#34; in width and the wide part of the belt is 28&#34; long.  The ties add an additional 60&#34; to the length (each of them is 30&#34;).  The one thing I didn't like as quite as much is that the ties are just cut, not finished at the ends. so over time they may unravel....but a little clear nail polish would fix that.  The other leather belt is a total of 88&#34; long.  It is not pure white, but more of an off white/ecru color.  It has a texture to it and the ties are made similarly to the lace belt.  All in all, I am so happy with this purchase and I'm sure my daughter will want to purchase it in more colors to wear with her medieval costumes and western wear as well. The second photo of the lace belt is with it placed on a piece of white paper.  It is a soft white."
4.0,"The dress fits great, it’s not see through and looks beautiful however the sleeves were too small for my arms. I ended up cutting off the sleeves and it still looks great. For reference I’m 190 pounds and got the XL."
4.0,"Great product.  It is not measured for my face as it keeps slipping down my nose.  A good buy.  It should come with a glasses case offer though, not just in a box."
4.0,Nice item great price. The gold tone part on buckle a looks little cheap
4.0,"Kinda itchy compared to others, but quite supportive."
4.0,"I ordered a few of these dresses for my 13 year old daughter.  She typically wears size XS or Small in women's and a 14 in girls.  This dress was too big for her so the pockets hit at a place that made her tiny hips look huge.  The stitching and material seems to be higher quality than many of the cheaper dresses we've purchased on Amazon.  I only wish they made an XS because I bet that would have been a much better fit.  While the pockets are functional, I can't imagine they'd make anyone (okay, maybe a supermodel) look good.  The red color was a bit off - a cross between orange and red.  If you're the kind of person (like me) who only looks good in blue-reds, then this red isn't for you!  The long sleeve dresses didn't work at all for her - just too much material in the wrong places and really displaced pockets."
4.0,"Pretty, feminine, but ran small, particularly across the chest. Looked a little cheap, but not a bad dress at all. 5’7/ 173lbs & 38C chest"
4.0,"The material is great quality is good. The only reason I took a star is the 6in inseam, I prefer the 9in but can not find them any more in charged cotton. These ride up my leg."
4.0,"Loved the color, a little small in the pouch, cock and balls are a little snug but i love how they look in it.  Its not uncomfortable, material feels great.  Definitely want to hand wash them not machine wash, the threads began to unravel but i was able to fix that.  I loved the colors.  If your ordering go with the next size up."
4.0,Package arrived as expected and boys liked the ties.
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings. Great color, definitely sparkle, comfortable. But just be forewarned, they are VERY small. Maybe I didn't read through the descriptions and reviews enough, but I wasn't expecting them to be so small. Regardless, they look nice, but if you're looking for something more noticeable, I'd go with a bigger  size."
4.0,"good product, but smaller than I originally thought. If I had ordered a size up, might have fit much better. otherwise, quality socks."
4.0,Cute and comfy especially for the price! My feet move around but too much in them right now but I’m hoping once they break in I will get that nice comfy sandal feel.  They are surprisingly comfortable already though.
4.0,"As I thought, I don't like the purple or green one. The black is kinda sparkly but still overall kind of dull looking. The clear looking one is great and has multiple colors throughout. I bought this for the white one, and I'm wearing them now. Really comfortable. Easy to get in and out since the flair isn't huge. I wish they sold the two white ones and the blue one as a three pack for cheaper. It's almost a waste to have the ones I don't like. I don't think they are real stone. I could be wrong. I haven't owned any plugs I know we're for sure stone and not faux. But they look the part for a cheap price and are comfy and light."
4.0,Light weight but not flexible enough. When tightened it pushes your glasses forward down your nose with any kind of head movement.
4.0,"It is such a cute little bag, I love it. My only 'disappointment' was that it didn't come with shoulder straps, but no biggie!"
4.0,Material feels good and the socks fit well.  The printing on it is also very good.
4.0,very nice hat perfect fit
4.0,"Good quality and shipped fast. Sizing was the only reason for four, rather than five, stars. Smaller than traditional sizing."
4.0,"We purchased this for a daughter to use as a costume for Alice in Wonderland. This is a very cute dress the cut is great, except for chest area. The seam fits awkwardly if you are busty and we ended up with some weird puckering in the waist area when we tried shifting things. It works on another daughter with a bit different build (and smaller chest). The color is vibrant and fabric is great too. The lace collar is a fantastic detail."
4.0,Colors are not has vibrant..the red is very dark but they are ok..
4.0,"I purchased these on August 31st and got them by Sept 13, which was pretty decent. Now I was really excited to get these however I'm disappointed because they're too tight to wear all day.  Now I always thought I had smaller arms, but even I was struggling to wear these. I can pull them just above my elbow but then the top of the fabric squeezes around my arm too tightly and I have to roll them down. I really wished they were a bit more loose because aside from that one issue, these are good sleeves. The fabric has thickness, so whether you're wearing the white one or black, there's no extreme see thru happening. You also get a nice silhouette effect. The quality is nice, but it seems to be only wearable if you have skinny or smaller arms. I'll be on the search for looser ones now.<br /><br />Pros: Nice material, great  thickness and coverage, no weird smell.<br />Cons: Can be too tight for bigger arms"
4.0,"Beautiful however, I give 4 stars because the color is way off!!! This set is SUPER BLUE...NOT TEAL at all!!! In fact, it could be considered some sort of weird blue teal but certainly NOT like the photo....I'll still wear it tho"
4.0,good stuff... works.
4.0,It’s ok for the money
4.0,Very cute top and the color is beautiful. It is a tad thin and the fabric is sheer. I will need to wear a tank top under for sure. Good product for the price.
4.0,"Loved the suit but was way too big in the bust and way too small in the hip/butt. I guess I'm the opposite of the suit pattern, I need smaller in the bust and larger in the hips!"
4.0,I really like the sweater. It’s definitely not 100% cashmere but other than that really nice sweater.
4.0,Nice oversized shirt for the price
4.0,This dress fit great. I used the sized chart and took into account the previous reviews that often mention it running large.  It is exactly as pictured and seems to be a good quality for the price.  I was worried it would be too long since I'm only 5'4 but it falls right to my knees.
4.0,Lo pedí blanco y vino rosado
4.0,"Nice feel, soft and stretchy but not too tight. Animal embellishments are cute. Socks had a strong chemical odor out of the package, but odor dissipated after washing."
4.0,"Bust run's small. I got an XXL and it fit very nicely around my waste hips and shoulders and the length was great, it was exceptionally small through the bust. Otherwise this was a lovely dress. It was not made of fabric I particularly think of as formal/fancy so it's claim to being a &#34;christmas&#34; dress is off but it's a really nice everyday sort of dress. Well made but very tight through the bust."
4.0,Nice well made basic sweater but the v neck is much smaller than shown and does not lend itself to being worn off the shoulder.
4.0,"Look great come with a nice cloth micro fiver cleaning cloth to get off the smudges, or clean them a lot better. Plus they are polarized wore them outside and driving and can really tell a difference,  even come with a nice zip up hard case was really surprised how durable they are what they come with for how cheap they are, highly recommend them.  Can pic out diff.  color lenses as well."
4.0,"A little pricey for the thinness of the material, but still a great shirt. One of my favorites. Would've bought multiples if it were a bit less expensive."
4.0,Cute and fun dress for such a great price.<br />The fabric isn’t the softest but for the price I wasn’t expecting Luxury. Great dress and qualify for the price.
4.0,"very nice belt. fancy packaging.  nice, lined box!  It's much bigger than what my daughter needs though.  i'm not sure why it's so long, but it comes with instructions for shortening and a tool to punch new holes.  i'll return though because i'll have to cut in half to use!"
4.0,I really like this cloth a lot! I bought it specifically to polish a silver flute that I have. The cloth worked beautifully! My flute was severely tarnished and now it just shines.
4.0,"Not quite what I thought it was going to be, but my daughter liked it"
4.0,Wish the inner and outer edge were rounded slightly. Other wise good.
4.0,"Be prepared for a hem close to your neck, if you are someone who is used to v-cut or low cuts. There is a zipper in the back. It is not very comfortable, and it looks exactly like the picture advertised. Currently using it under loose tank tops to pull looks together."
4.0,Bigger than I expected although made my luggage visible.
4.0,Nice quick dry material. Hubby loved them accept there were 2 holes in a pocket. He wore them all day and said he kept losing his keys. I wrote to seller and they immediately refunded. Would’ve loved an exchange but hey that worked. Wear size 34 bought medium and they fit good
4.0,"5'3"", 190lbs, size 12-14 or Large/XL and bought and XL. I love this blouse and the color. The material is not the best but still love it 😁"
4.0,"After 5 purchases of this jacket, there is a bit of a story that goes along with it and I'll try to keep it short. Original purchase for my husband was wonderful... the jacket was as described and fit perfectly, hence a second purchase for me! Perfect fit and happy. Then, a couple of months later my husband's was stolen by a hospital worker along with his new shoes and new trousers. Purchased a replacement jacket which had to be sent back for an exchange due to the extremely twisted lining in one of the sleeves. The replacement came but the sleeves were now too tight for him (this one was the OLIVE color). Ordered another which was as perfect as the original purchase and kept the one with the skinny sleeves for me (and my skinny arms) as a backup, just in case... So 4 STARS out of 5: one off for the hassles due to bad quality control and what would have been a 5 for the great quality of the jacket as a whole when you get a good one!"
4.0,Had trouble getting the right order but when i do they are great!
4.0,Use more for accessory/looks. Not so much for function.
4.0,"I really like this Cuff, the weight of it can be a bit daunting though."
4.0,Bigger then expected from image shown
4.0,armpit odor still lingers after washing shirt.. i would recommend soaking a bit first. but my son likes the style and fit of shirts.
4.0,"Is this meant for women? I mean, even if it is I have incredibly skinny wrists for a guy and this thing is really tight on me. I wish it was a little longer but I think I'm gonna keep it because it seems like it will loosen up just enough to be enjoyable to wear as the python/stingray is super firm at first. Really great looking piece!"
4.0,"For the price, this is a great watch. The band is a bit cheaply made so it wears off fast, but still looks pretty good, if you take care of it, I.E. don't wear it everyday, it will last just fine. The face is huge! So if you have a small wrist, I would look for something else. If you like a larger watch face like myself, then it's perfect! I jokingly call this my &#34;Grand Central Station Watch&#34;"
4.0,"Delivered on time. Very pretty earrings, but a bit tiny. Was expecting larger hoops. But nice for casual wear. Made out of light plastic , not metal."
4.0,Esta cómoda
4.0,Small enough to be portable and large enough maybe for a Mac.  Wish there was an outside drink pocket.  Enough storage compartments to stow things out of the way/out of sight.
4.0,"Crystal looks great, but does not hang straight"
4.0,"Purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. She was happy to get it, not sure just yet, how she likes the fit. I think it is a neat idea!"
4.0,"These are really comfortable, but the foam sole wears thin so quickly. I wish it had better padding!"
4.0,Thsee are great!! They don't bother my ears at all they are super cute and look amazing. They are of good quality. They are a great deal !!!I have gotten many compliments.
4.0,"I was trying to get a decent summer shirt and this one looked nice so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Upon receiving the button up shirt, I thought the quality of it was pretty decent. I actually really liked the shirt but the problem was that it was a pretty big for the size that I ordered. After washing it, it did shrink a little bit but not enough to feel comfortable wearing it.<br /><br />I hope this review gives you some insight and allows you to make an educated purchasing decision."
4.0,These are super cute. Bought them for a girls weekend gave one to each friend. The theory is to make a wish and wear them till it breaks and your wish will come true. It's just a cute thought full idea.
4.0,They fit and feel great! I would totally recommend them. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because the white is super see through
4.0,"The bodice and skirt were surprisingly good quality (hence the price tag). The accessories were much lower quality but they still added a lot to the costume.  And I appreciated that it was a complete costume so I did not need to buy anything else to look the part. Unfortunately, it was too tight in the waist, so I returned it. A bigger size would have been too big at the top for me. If you have a curvier figure it may fit better."
4.0,Very nice budget conscious charm bracelet!
4.0,"Fit well, love the color; however, did not give as much support as I would have liked."
4.0,"I picked this old school watch up right before a military deployment. I wanted something cheap, that I don't care what happens to it. This fits the bill.<br />Pro Cheap, lightweight, has a stop watch and alarm<br />Con: the backlight is kind of crap and it only has 1 time zone.<br /><br />Worth the buy if you don't care about the style (or like the retro) and you need something to just tell the time."
4.0,Large!! I didn't expect this but beautiful
4.0,"So far I love this wallet. It is actually thinner than my previousnwalletnand it forced me to get rid of a bunch of junk that I haven't usedninnyearsnand was just taking up space in my old wallet.<br /><br />Some people complained about the latch being subject to failure, but I think that if you squeeze the wallet prior to opening or closing the latch you will relieve the pressure so you are not exerting quite as much force when opening and closing the latch therefore you can extend it's life."
4.0,"These are so sweet, they fit my 2 1/2mth perfectly, the yarn leaves some stretching room, hoping to get through the winter with them!"
4.0,Much larger then expected but very beautiful.
4.0,It looks just like the previous one I ordered and that is amazing. I had to replace my daughter's favourite dress since she ripped her old one. I ordered a size up since she loves it so much. True to size and guaranteed to make your little one happy.
4.0,"These slippers are true to size and super comfortable. The memory foam sole feels delicious on my feet. Truly my only complaint with these is they look very masculine, like I’m wearing my husbands slippers. Otherwise, I highly recommend these."
4.0,"Comfortable, but after 2 months the sole separated from the heel. Still wearable. Not quite that perfect shoe I was hoping for my plantar fasciitis and heel spurs."
4.0,It's A Good Buy
4.0,I absolutely love this dress!! I received so many compliments on my dress and the feel was GREAT.
4.0,"This dress fit much better than I expected (this is the first dress I ever bought on Amazon). I got the large size and it fit great, but it was too long for me (I'm short though, so...). Aside from that, every other thing about the dress was great."
4.0,I love owls and wanted a watch so this was perfect.  I was very pleased when I received it.  It was even better in person than in the picture.
4.0,This is a nice swimsuit top.  It's true to size and it doesn't move around or threaten any boob flashing while you're in the ocean.  What more could you ask for.
4.0,Came w holes in pockets
4.0,"It’s interesting how this necklace transformed when I put it on — it went from a clunky, garish looking jumble of beads to a very attractive, funky set of turquoise and brass beads and chains. I was really amazed, because I was ready to chuck it, but it looks fantastic on my black sweater dress. If you hesitate to order it due to the reviews, give it a chance — it’s actually a nice statement necklace that brightens dull winter colors."
4.0,"Sometimes the clasp will come undone, but it can easily be fixed. It's metal, so the weight just feels real"
4.0,Very pretty. I'm scared they may break easily though.
4.0,"STINK! They smell like glue/paint VERY strongly. My granddaughter likes them and they fit well. They are VERY cheap made. Think dollar general or family dollar store shoes. Not Worth the high price. Im glad she likes them, but not something I will order again."
4.0,One of the aprons was dirty when it arrived.  Fortunately it washed out. The seem to be good quality and proportions.
4.0,"Longer than pictured. Very busy pattern but I love turquoise. Great fabric, actually linen and cotton."
4.0,Great gift for an attorney.
4.0,"This is a great product. Skirts seem to be true to size for our girls. I have not read the instructions for care, but I am not sure they will hold up for long-term wear because of the delicate material; especially the stitching at the hem. I could be wrong though. Altogether, these skirts are amazing for a special outing or occasion such as our baby shower."
4.0,A bit tight. I have several support socks. These seem extra tight.
4.0,"Only had it for a week so far, but it's a dainty piece that when worn alone is subtle and pretty."
4.0,Beautiful dress. fabric is thick. the dress is just a bit too long and runs big.
4.0,Great costumer service. The kimono is pretty love the color! One of it has a little tear in the armpit and a little thread sticking out but no biggy it's easy fix. If you order this go one size up than your usual hence it runs a little small. I can't wait to give it to my bridesmaids.
4.0,"I like these slides but I don’t love them.  They have a nice supportive arch for my flat feet and are true to size.  They are made of good quality and appears to have a long wear time.  However, they’re not as comfortable as I would have liked them to be.  Don’t get me wrong they’re comfortable enough for everyday errands but I wouldn’t wear them to a theme park or for any extended walking."
4.0,"I love my poncho. I bought it when I had a cast on my arm but now that I'm whole again, it's still my go-to, snuggly, warm layer both indoors and out. It fits well, looks good and garners compliments when I'm out for an evening walk."
4.0,"Nice and thick, goes well up the wrist to keep snow from getting inside the glove, but waaayy to big. Got the size they said was for 9-10 yr old boy and they would easily fit a teenager."
4.0,"Good shoes. Seem true to size. Rigid sole, good power transfer.  Comfortable, nice toe box."
4.0,"I'm a racquetball player and needed a new pair of court shoes to replace my 7 year old Ektalons.  Saw these Jazba's and thought I'd give them a try even though I never heard of the brand before.<br /><br />My opinions after having them one week and wearing them on the court once so far:<br /><br />Pros - Good-looking shoes.  Well-cushioned.  Pretty accurate fit.  Well-priced.<br /><br />Cons - None so far.<br /><br />Only time will tell how well these will hold up.  If they last even half as long as the Ektalons did, then they will merit 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/1/20:. After approx 3 months, I really like these shoes.  Good traction.  Super comfortable.  They look great.  Still too early by my standards to change rating to 5 stars, but they continue to impress me."
4.0,My son wanted these he is 12 and he wears them all the time
4.0,These shoes run on the large size so beware.
4.0,The teddy is gorgeous but I'm a very large gal and the size of it was grossly misrepresented in the description.
4.0,I ordered the dress hoping to get THE one in the photo... THE DRESS I RECEIVED IS NOT THE SAME DRESS IN THE PHOTO!!! Pretty annoying but I'm not gonna try and return it to China... ugh.
4.0,"Item arrived on time, came with a bracelet and a gift bag which was more than I expected. Quality of material not as great as I'd hoped but it's still nice."
4.0,"Has heavier fabric than I was expecting which is nice, I like the cut of the shirt although the sleeves hit short of my wrists. I just push them up and it works. True to U.S. sizing. Got several compliments on it today, but honestly I just like it and it seems fun to me."
4.0,"I got these shorts for doing yoga. I'm 5'9"" and 130 pounds, and a small fits great. The shorts fit closely while giving a good range of motion, and the tapered legs will preserve your modesty when your legs are up in the air. They wick sweat well, which is really important to me. I wish they were just a bit longer. They hit 3-4 inches above the knee on me. The pockets are a little small. The overall quality seems okay, but the elastic has shown signs of curling up within the waistband after washing. I was able to straighten it out, and it seems okay now. I ended up switching to some rock-climbing knickers by Ucraft that have turned out to be great for yoga while giving me the length I prefer."
4.0,I found them to have a large opening. I had to take a tuck in the back. Then they have worked great. Comfortable to wear. Weather is still cool here. Glad I brought them.
4.0,"Great deal!  One of the straps was cut too long,  but nothing a little sewing can't fix."
4.0,I wore then when fishing and out in the sun.  They really seemed to help
4.0,"The bag was cute and bigger than expected, but I did return it because it was missing the arm handle."
4.0,I like this product a lot and so does my mom. I ordered it for her birthday and I got it the next day.
4.0,"Very nice.  I wanted some middle finger rings, so I looked for bulky.  I also wanted something other than Rose/Gold/Silver and this fit the bill.  It's a great casual look for jeans and daily wear.  Comfortable, very pretty and seems well constructed."
4.0,Nice sweatshirt. Wish it was a little longer.
4.0,"I liked the earrings, but they arrived packaged and one was knotted. It took 20 minutes to take the Knott out, to be careful not to break it."
4.0,"These box briefs are soft and comfortable. I like the fabric, but I wish that the legs were longer. I cannot complain about the length since these boxer briefs are exactly as pictured in the advertisement. These boxer briefs are roomy; if you want them tighter, I suggest going down the size. I’ve only washed them one time so far, so I’m not sure how durable they will be. After they’ve gone through eight or nine washes, I will write more about them. These boxer briefs were economical."
4.0,Love the colors. It was too big.<br />2XL would have been fine. Most 2XL are too small for me.
4.0,"As advertised, wish it was a bit smaller for holding the money; but good for what it is."
4.0,"These slippers are super cute, very comfortable, and warm. True to size and would order again. Only 4 stars because they are noisy when walking. I feel like it will go away after the are worn a bit."
4.0,"the large knob is easy to accidently knock, but also easy to use.  The wood is beautiful and the watch is well made for a cheap watch.  If you want a easy to read at a glance watch that won't cost a lot, and looks nice as well, this is for you"
4.0,"I got these for some Frye boots that rubbed my feet raw and I think they work well. They do not come up as high on the leg as it looks in the picture, but it mostly covers the problem areas of my foot. I did still get a blister after walking about 7 miles in them, but without them I would not have even made it half a mile. Overall, I would purchase more of these."
4.0,Very cute.  I like it.
4.0,"The fabric feels very high quality and strong construction. I live the Snake skin pattern. I am 5'3&#34;, and these come within a couple inches of my ankles, so they are more short pants than capris, and they are not as stretchy as some of my other yoga pants so they are almost too small. More motivation to workout, I guess. If you are on the fence about a size, maybe try a size up."
4.0,"Great gift for the guitarist in your life. The ink or pre-treatment smell was a but strong, but not too bad once it off-gassed. The fit and quality are both good too."
4.0,Product look good worth spend .
4.0,"This dress was great, love the material, love the cut, it was sexy and hid my problem areas. Only thing is I bought it for a work party and it revealed TOO much of me for a work thing. I returned it,  Otherwise it’s beautiful, PS- you may need static guard on hand."
4.0,This bag is my daily bag for running around and getting things done. It does not look fancy or high fashion but it looks clean and goes with anything casual.<br />It's an adjustment that it does not zip from the top but from the side instead and the opening is also on the side against your body.<br />This can make getting items in/out a bit clumsy but not a huge deal.<br />The capacity of the bag is not as big as I expected but it also makes me carry less therefore making my bag lighter. I live in NYC so this is a plus with walking and taking public transit.<br />This bag cannot be machine washed or dried due to the fake leather accents but overall this is a nice functional bag for daily use.
4.0,"Cute, very small. I actually took the pendent off and put it on another chain that I never take off."
4.0,"The o-rings come off easy, but it’s not a problem for me. They’re exactly as described, and a good size. Exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,Didn’t get all the hardware that was advertised
4.0,"Took a bit of time to get acclimated in their application. When I get it right, it's perfect."
4.0,Purchased this watch on a lightning deal and it was far cheaper than even quartz homages of the famous Swiss Railway face.  I actually prefer the the relative cleaness of this dial and the 6 o'clock date window to other options that cost more.<br /><br />The face is pure black and white with no lume; the hands are true black and the seconds hand is red with a luminous dot.  The case seems good with a satin finish and the strap was of decent quality for the price.  The listed dimensions of the strap and lug width was 2 cm but I discovered it was actually 22mm.<br /><br />So far the movement seems to keep decent time and gains about 10 seconds a day.  It is hand winding and hacking but the crown is a tad small and the clicks pulling it out are indistinct; it can be tough to wind or adjust.  The winding feels a little coarse and toy-like and have had to insert re-pull the crown a few times to get it to start or stop as needed.<br /><br />Overall if it keeps running I'll be very happy.  I actually prefer this homage with the 6oclock date to the real offerings.  Definitely a brand I will watch for in the future.
4.0,My girls loved this! Quality is ok. Not see through but not thick either. Sizing is accurate.
4.0,"Me quedó muy bien, era lo que esperaba.<br />Aunque para los puños, preferiría que no sean botones plasticos, sino igual a los botones de nudo en el pecho, lo mismo para las mangas altas."
4.0,"I love how soft the shirts are. I was hoping they were a little longer, but it’s not too short."
4.0,"Very cute. Would buy again.  One bead is kind of misaligned after wearing continuously for a weekend, but it was still attached well and was easily smoothed out. Perfect size and good secure closing mechanism. Might have to buy this in more colors.  Recommend!"
4.0,"On the waist was too tight, my wife ordered a L size thinking it might be smaller. She had to get a friend to put an elastic band to make it work. (by the way my wife wears either S or M at the most). Other than that she likes it, it beautiful."
4.0,"Love the style, how it fits comfortably and the purpose of them obviously. The only negative is the glare if it wasn't for that a 5 star item."
4.0,Pretty & white (fresh & clean looking) although it tends to shed.  I choose not to wear it with anything black because it leaves lint.
4.0,"great summer socks that work. not your typical sock, kind of feel like stockings which is a surprise at first. if you are used to wearing thick socks these will probably make your shoes feel too big."
4.0,"The color are very bright and my son loved it. however, the  material is very thin. I hope it will not get splitted."
4.0,"It was a good band, I just hated the watch"
4.0,"Fit great, looks great.  Some of the print beads up if rubbed too much.  Great as leggings."
4.0,"Very pretty, lightweight design. They do want to fall off if overly, um, let’s say “stimulated” in that area. Not at all uncomfortable to wear, for me at least. The set I received seem well made and sturdy. Would purchase other colors/styles. They accidentally got delivered to a random neighbor, so hopefully they didn’t open the package before returning it to the mailbox! Lol! The package/envelope was fairly discreet, and I think it said something about jewelry on the label."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 130lb. The 2-6 size fit perfectly. Not tight, not loose, the perfect length and overall a comfortable dress for the Speakeasy party we attended. I knocked a star off because I wish the design went all the way around. Instead the back is solid black fabric. And it was a tiny bit loose around the arm pit."
4.0,"Not quite super enough for Samsung Galaxy phones. Not &#34;tall&#34; enough in the pocket area but after spending AU$30 at boot maker to have more elastic and leather added invisibly to the tab, the wallet is now perfect!"
4.0,It's a little thin but it looks so good. One thing that you don't notice in the pictures is that gray is like a reflective holographic.
4.0,Super soft and comfy dress. More as a dress around the house or swimwear cover than going out dress. Flowy and soft<br /><br />I ordered a small based on other items I have purchased in the past and although they seem to run a little larger than I prefer ( could just be the maxi syle) this particular style tends to run a little large.<br /><br />If you are looking for something comfortable and loose this could be a perfect option.
4.0,"A tad baggy,  but very comfortable.  Handy pockets."
4.0,"It really does have a metal change, it lights up, has sound, has the time (and you can set the time), and you can hear David Tennant's voice on it. Again, this is perfect for any Doctor Who fan."
4.0,"I bought this specifically for a Ryanair flight, as their baggage sizing is a little different than most airlines.  As it turned out, they didn't even look at my bag and I could have used my standard carryon bag.  That being said, I did lug it around for a month in Turkey, Greece, and some islands in the Mediterranean.  There were 7 flights, two long bus rides, and a few ferries.  It held up pretty well considering the beating it took, but some of the seams are showing signs they may not make it through another trip with the same amount of wear.  It didn't even cost $25, so I wasn't expecting this to be a lifelong traveling companion.  The wheels work just fine, no issues there.  The handle was a little loose and it started making me crazy because I wasn't traveling with a screwdriver and it's a bit of an odd request, so I just constantly picked at it with my fingernail waiting to board buses and planes.  All it took was a half a turn with a screwdriver when I got home, so I made it out to be a bigger deal than it was.  The lock that comes with it is a real joke.  It's like something you get out of a $.25 gumball machine.  Plan on getting a TSA lock if you feel the need to lock it.  The conversion of the bag into a backpack came in REALLY handy several times.  I had so much weight in the bag at one point, I nearly toppled over wearing it, but the bag took it like a champ.  Overall, it's worth it, especially for a Ryanair flight where dimensions of the bags can be point of contention.  No, it's not something you'll never have to purchase again, but it can really take some wear and the price is fantastic."
4.0,Love the material. Color was as I expected and the length was not to long. I want to order this dress in all colors.
4.0,The shirt is cute. The red is brighter than the picture shows.
4.0,I am happy overall with these capris. They are a little baggy behind the knee. But they do fit well in the waist. Im 5'1 145 pounds and I got a size 11.
4.0,"I just received the anklets today (bought the gold and silver one). They're so cute and sturdy, but I had to take away one star because the chain that goes around the toe part on one of the anklets was broken away from the clasp. However, it was an easy fix. I also read on some other reviews that it was for a larger foot and doesn't lay flat, but it fit my size 8 foot fine as I just adjusted the chain around the ankle to fit more snug. These are going to be perfect for my upcoming trip.  I would recommend. Thank you."
4.0,"I am going to enjoy wearing this around, it goes well with a pair of high waisted jeans and some sneakers. Fit well, didnt need to order a size up, and the pocket fit my phone! overall very good product."
4.0,this bag is great BUT i wish the top zipper started on top not the side of the bag  The way the zipper is makes it easy for items to fall out of the bag when it is unzipped
4.0,"A little large, but gorgeous nonetheless"
4.0,"The smallest of these is very small, as small as a pony tail holder..  They appear much larger on the models’ arms than they actually are.  Since they stretch they will fit most wrists and may stretch with wear."
4.0,very stretchy fabric - which makes it very comfortable. I got 3 &#34;like your dress&#34; comments the first day I wore it!
4.0,Nice dress just fit a little too small.
4.0,"Love this dress especially for the price! It is a bit sheer so I’ll need to wear white or nude underwear. Was also a little loose in the armpits but it will do the job! I got a 6/8 and I’m 5’7, 135 lbs"
4.0,"Little bit thinner than the oakley lenses it replaced, not as purplish as i would of liked and they only give you privacy in direct sunlight if your in shade or where sun dosnt directly hit your face you can see your eyes clear as day but besides all that they went in my frames hassle-free."
4.0,"I really like this bag. I bought it for a costume because it had a loop on back you can slide a belt through. I now use it as a purse to put in my backpack when I go places so i have something smaller to carry after I stash my backpack. Fits my iphone 6s, charger/cord, wallet, battery and headphones with a bit of room left over.<br /><br />The only reason it, has 4 instead of 5 stars is I wish the strap was a little longer and the magnetic closure on the front was a bit stronger."
4.0,"This dress was a total hit! I got several complements on it. I ordered a size (8/10), and overall it fit perfectly. I’m naturally smaller on top so I had to add a little padding. But no big deal. It was a great find at an incredible price."
4.0,Just a bit small for me...
4.0,These work great but I wish they were of better quality. I would be willing to pay a little more for better materials and quality.
4.0,I thought the shirt was going to be more orange... It's more of a light orange color.
4.0,Shipment took a month for me to receive it. The color is not what was advertised. It's tan and and green and pink inside. I thought it would be pink all over with green. Still a very beautiful and spacious wallet!! :)
4.0,"It was so soft !! They also included a cute hair tie which was sweet but yeah,, the shorts didn't fit me ;w; and the top is a bit tight even though I got the biggest size. Other than that really happy with it."
4.0,"For a dress bought from Amazon, I have to say I was pretty impressed! The dress is very nice, and after a dry clean/steam down, it looked very good. The lace that comes with the dress to tighten the back isn't very high quality, but it did the job, so I was satisfied (hence the 4 stars instead of 5)"
4.0,Very pretty my 8 yr old niece loves💞 it you can't do better then JoJo Siwa and unicorns🎠.You are paying for the JoJo Siwa name brand Amazon sells packs of 4 to 6 bows🎀for the same price range if it's for someone who just likes bows🎀 or is not name brand conscious. But at 8 she knows 🎤🎀🎠
4.0,"I chose not to keep these sun glasses because they were a little tight above my ears (but my head is on the larger side). They are 13.5 mm across from hinge to hinge. I really liked the look- especially the color of red/black. They arrived with a little scratch on them (see picture). They don't feel super sturdy, but that doesn't mean they would break easily."
4.0,"Definitely order a size up if you are curvy and have a chest. Very cute swim suit, but I'm glad I ordered a size up as was suggested in another review."
4.0,"Swiss quartz movement and made in Germany,.  If you  are ok with quartz movements, you should be VERY pleased with this watch. I am especially happy with the Big Date feature.  And the Super-NumaLova for night vision is the best I have ever seen.  The alarm is a cool feature too.  I deducted a star because of the silicon strap with the white stripe that came  with it.  In my opinion, the silicon with the stripes is cheap looking and hurts the overall appearance of this very classy watch.  The good news... I visited the manufacturers website and found and ordered a beautiful leather strap (23mm lug) with black accents and now with that strap replacing the silicon, I am wearing a very handsome high end quartz timepiece.  Highly recommended."
4.0,The only con is that it is too big
4.0,Very comfortable and very well priced!!! Looks like I have boots on 👍 good purchase
4.0,"This shirt flares out in the underarm area as though fitted for a muscular person who has done way too many lat pull downs! I needed to bring to tailor. Then was fine.<br />Sturdy fabric, nice and long in torso length."
4.0,I really do like these underwear. They feel like you are wearing nothing and they never once bugged me. The only problem is that a pad has a hard time staying in cause these underwear is softer fabric
4.0,"I liked that I could carry this with me when I don’t want to have a bag or wallet on me. Felt like a female wallet type thing however after using it for a few days (repeatedly) one of the hinges had came off and it was all in pieces.  I processed a return but tried to fix it, and I did. Looking at the design. I doesn’t look like the pin is placed in a very secure way.... I placed the pin back into the hinge and it felt secure. A little piece of the pin is sticking out but it doesn’t bother me. Not so far at least."
4.0,"For being a cheap, automatic watch that was made in China, it isn't too bad. I use it as my 'beater' watch for when I'm at work. It's somewhat stylish, it works with many outfits. It's not the best at telling time, though. It usually jumps a couple minutes ahead by the end of the week. It also likes to cycle through the months rather quickly, and I can't figure out how to set the day. Nevertheless, I never really pay attention to the date feature anyway, just the time, and as long as it keeps doing that, I'll still wear it."
4.0,I wore them through November & December very light weight but they are rather big. I got atleast 1 compliment every day wearing them. Many saying they love them and how festive they are. Definitely worth the price.
4.0,These are cute. They seem cheap only in the fact that they are stamped and not engraved. I searched all over for something like this that was engraved and could not find anything. We will see how long these hold up.
4.0,"Cute! Large, and a little heavy but not too heavy. They are see through green, not teal.<br />Other than that, I like them! Worn many times!"
4.0,Good quality.. for the price..<br />Has a slight smell to it.. im.sure it will air out over time. I love the style. It's very boho chic 💜
4.0,Runs a little smaller
4.0,"I like the colo, hope it help me with cold weather, so its not hear as yet the snow?, but I am prepared"
4.0,These are super cute. Comfortable on the face and work great!
4.0,Pretty cheaply made but my 7 year old son loves them.
4.0,OVERALL NICE PURSE. NICE SIZE AND FEEL BUT THE PINK INSIDE KINDA CAN BE SEEN ON EDGES.
4.0,"I like the lite structure, but at the same time, the fabric allows air flow."
4.0,"Perfect length, love the style I would like the clasp to be larger, some masks have wider bands"
4.0,Very comfortable & doesn't wrinkle
4.0,"The waist fits tight and the length is long, as other reviewers mentioned. Still not bad."
4.0,"For the price I was pleased with the product. I deducted a star because it is pretty large for a bracelet so I feel like it would slip off if I am not careful and the quality isn't the highest, but it was only $7 or so plus shipping. I have only worn it a couple times so hopefully it will hold up."
4.0,Nice suit. Like it better than my speedo that cost 3 times as much.
4.0,I love the look of this watch band but I find that it’s kinda uncomfortable. It’s thicker and less flexible than the Apple silicone watch band. It kinda hurts my wrist. Good for during the day but It’s been too uncomfortable to sleep with
4.0,Comfortable but falls on the larger side. I'm generally a medium and ordered a medium. Sleeves were a bit larger than expected. Still a great design though!
4.0,The socks are extremely cute and comfortable. My only problem is one of the socks is missing the ears :( Give me back the ears please. I will sew them on myself &#60;/3
4.0,"One review mentioned it was very similar to just do it.  I am used to wearing that brand size medium and finding I need to go up a size to a large.  Hope it won't be too big.  The width was the same as a medium in this other brand, but the straps were shorter.  Materials and construction seem decent.<br /><br />UPDATE: I went up a size and now it's a bit too big.  I'll keep it though because it seems decent quality and supportive enough.  Sizes are just weird and not what I'm used to with my normal brand."
4.0,"Good wallet! I used to have a similar one that was all black and it finally wore out after a few years.  I opted for this one thinking it'd look great, and thought it does, I prefer an all black one compared to the leather and grey.  Functionally, it's perfect."
4.0,"I use them on my trash route and they are great! Very comfortable, but not entirely waterproof. They do a better job than most gloves at keeping out water, but aren’t perfect. They also have gotten some rips in the fingers after using them for a couple months, would like the material to be a little more durable on the palm side of the hand."
4.0,The sleeves are more like 3/4 and it is very snug. I'd recommend ordering up a size. Very nice material though!
4.0,"Looks to be good quality, we just received it. It runs small though it was meant to be for me preteen and it did not fit even with it on the loosest snap."
4.0,"The shirt is pretty, but a little thin and smaller than true to size. I normally wear a medium in Expess Portofino shirts; which generally run smaller. I got a large in this shirt. It's fitted around the bust and arms. So if you wear a medium, get a large. The print is pretty and can be worn with jeans or dressed up for business casual."
4.0,"A good band. It isn't quite as good of quality as the actual Samsung brand, and I did have it fall off once when the clips were not in correctly. But I haven't had a problem since."
4.0,I think the earrings look beautiful but to give as a gift I think for the money a gift box or pouch would have been nice
4.0,"I love it. Fits me. [[ASIN:B01AD3IZR8 ZXZY Women's Lightweight Soft White Hooded Pullover Tops,White,Medium]]"
4.0,"These are super super soft. The sequin detail is fun and very on trend though the sequins are hard to flip on a couple of the designs, especially on the edges. My other complaint is that the waist runs large and the drawstring on the waist is not functional, it's decorative. I wish it was functional because the waist really needs to be cinched tighter. Other than the large waist, they do run true to size. The pink I more of a mauve than a true pink."
4.0,"I like that I don’t have to worry about my 2 year old slipping and falling while running in the house because of how awesome the grips are on the bottom of the sock<br />But with that great grip, comes the struggle of putting her foot in any shoe because of it getting stuck on the fabric of the shoe"
4.0,"I ended up returning it, only because the color was off from what I was looking for.  Tried it on and fit well."
4.0,My son loves this shirt. My only complaint is the stitching around the bottom came loose immediately. We decided to keep the shirt anyway.
4.0,They a little bit larger and bigger than the chart presentation but very little. Fair quality for the money
4.0,Seems small for adult hands. Seems like a kids watch but nice.
4.0,Graphics are brighter than pictured. Good basic shirt. Easy to dress up and down.
4.0,"Con...Ruffles are too big. But after I iron them out, it'll be just fine, I hope. Nice and soft. Should look very good with my nice Denim Jeans."
4.0,Seams are slightly tight and clip is plastic so it could possibly break after a lot of wear but overall I am extremely happy with the suit! Such a pretty fabric!
4.0,"I love this keychain, its wonderful and beautiful, it still has all its color after a long time. One thing though is that the little pieces that cross do comet from time to time but they are not that hard to put back into place. The keychain is sturdy god knows I've dropped mine many times and nothing is wrong, it holds a lot of weight. They keychain is small though, when I purchased mine I thought it would go around my wrist I was very mistaken, most it goes around is 3 fingers. but the keychain is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone."
4.0,"The reason I am giving this ring 4 stars is because I haven't had this for a long time.  My piercing had been barren for more than 6 months, so we'll have to see how this turns out in the long run.  It is cute, though."
4.0,Guess the one size is the way to go. I'm 5 7&#34; and 140 and I tend to get muffin top with most of the other brands. If they last I'll give 5 stars
4.0,Great bag!  perfect summer size!
4.0,I love this dress and wear it every week. I’m 5’9 and it hits at the knee which is a major plus. I marked 4 stars as while it’s been in heavy rotation the dress probably won’t last 6 more months. It’s already starting to look a bit worn. Definitely repurchase though as it fits well and feels great
4.0,I use them to identify my luggage at airports. No problems with losing them.
4.0,"This worked great for my sons’s crazy hat day, and now we have another for next year too!"
4.0,I loved the style but it was to small. I bought a larger size but it was still to small.
4.0,"A few little flaws, but otherwise very nice!"
4.0,"Its totally different from what I normally wear in the summer, but I like it."
4.0,These earrings are a beautiful shade of emerald green and the price can't be beat! Arrived early. Very satisfied with this purchase and merchant.
4.0,"In person these look more silvery than gold, but I liked them enough to keep them."
4.0,It's too long for a petite torso with a skirt.
4.0,"Somewhat tight around face, but love the design"
4.0,"Love the color and style. A little big but not sure if I would go smaller. For the price, the material is much better than I thought. Got lots of compliments"
4.0,"Pretty good. Thin material, zipper is not the best, but it works. It looks good on"
4.0,The color is a little less vibrant than pictured but that's to be expected. Fits well. Tunic length is nice over the rump and the lace detail is pretty.
4.0,I just spent time in Colorado and I wore this skirt almost every day.  It really keeps you warm. This wrap is a little lighter weight than the other I own.  I also bought a medium instead of a small by accident.  The difference in the size doesn't really make any difference in the fit.  I love these wraps so much.
4.0,I am very  satisfied with the fit and how quickly it releases moisture.
4.0,"The material itself is very light, soft and comfy; however, the white band going around the legs is extremely restrictive. When you're moving around at night, the shorts creep up like all shorts when you're sleeping and it starts to cut off the circulation, which wakes you up. I've tried several times to sleep in these, but it's become painful."
4.0,"I absolutely love the color, love the style and love the ruffly sleeves!!  However, the sizes run small and I am returning for the next size up.Darn-wanted to wear next week....While I initially got this product as a discount to review it, I am returning it and have to pay full price for the replacement-so you know I like it!!"
4.0,It completed the outfit and my niece loved it!!!
4.0,Haven't used it out & about yet but i was impressed by the quality. Folds up nicely!
4.0,Beautiful leggings but for my 5'2 140 figure it was a boy snug.
4.0,"Works as advertised. However, not really obvious how the top end of the extra security strap attaches to the strap."
4.0,"This shirt is really nice! I love the plaid perfect for fall and winter. It fits really nicely and is made of a lightweight material that you can wear in warmer weather. I like the style of this shirt, I like how the ruffles are layered on the sleeves and around the bottom. I can easily move my shoulders and it's easy to button in the back."
4.0,"It's very compact and holds 11 of my cards, (8) inside (3) under clip takes a while to get use to.  Searching for a specific card is the challenge.  I shouldn't have to remove cards to find one, I hope there are upgrades in the near future."
4.0,Very Flattering and good material!!!
4.0,Like the bracelet but it is not navy it is definitely teal
4.0,The key chain arrived quickly and was looked exactly as the picture.  I've had no problems with it and I've  been using it for awhile.
4.0,"My son loves these slippers.  They are cute and comfy, but the rubber grips have been peeling off.  I thought it is a good value for the price."
4.0,the fit is very nice. Could have been a little longer and the material is a bit warm and itchy
4.0,These are super cute! the cuff is a little hard to wear for long periods of time it begins to rub with the way it fits but over all I love these and wear them a lot!
4.0,"Nice material, just not worth the price"
4.0,"Good socks, thin as stated, with good fit. Hopefully they last."
4.0,"Beautiful fabric. It's not Ankara, but it looks like it. It's quite versatile and you can wear it many ways. It can be a bit problematic for those with big boobs and a stomach though. Otherwise, it's all good."
4.0,I want to give this 5 Stars but I have 2 small nitpicks about the band. First one being that its difficult to get the magnetic through the metal loop because its metal and the magnetic sticks to it. The magnetic is strong and holds the watch in place perfectly so It's a small price to pay for this gorgeous looking mesh that complements my galaxy watch very well. Second thing that I didnt notice til the weather cooled down is that the band snags on my sleeves while putting on jackets and sweaters. Obviously this wasnt an issue during Summer. Just something to consider if you live where it's cool more often than not.
4.0,"Way way to small and I got the biggest they had.  I'm a average to small guy.  5'7&#34; tall and about 175 lbs.  If I loose a little wieght by next summer it'll  be great!  Can't wear it till I do, but I do love it.  Looks good!"
4.0,"This bag is pretty much perfect for what I need it for, just a simple day purse that is thick enough to carry heavy loads but also lightweight fabric.<br />So in that regard: its a good bag, its lined and has a little sleeve/pocket on the inside which is a nice touch.<br />However, the print (the little whales and trees and such) is printed upside down!! :( Which isn't all that big of a deal, but not what I expected. I still like the bag, and plan to keep it - but I hope the manufacture will fix this issue."
4.0,"Very nice band. The only drawback for me is that I have a small wrist and the length of the band is just a bit too long. The ""tail"" doesn't stay within the loop and sticks out, catching on things. Other than that, it is very nice quality and appearance."
4.0,Feel cheap but it works
4.0,Very nice and it even feels quite sturdy considering the price. Love it!
4.0,Too big - returning.  Cute if it fit.  looks - good but too big
4.0,Kind of flimsy and the print isn't as strong as the picture shows . Not easy to collapse either .
4.0,"I really like my bag. Some of the threading was a little loose around the drawstring, which will likely need to be reinforced. Otherwise, a great product to save wasting plastic bags!!"
4.0,"Good quality, have held up good so far. Comfortable fit, nice fabric."
4.0,"It’s a decent helmet. It looks great. The terry cloth inside is actually great. I hunk it was meant to add to the vintage feel of the helmet. However, I found that my head never got itchy in this helmet. Never! I went through Cambodia and Vietnam for a month and never had a problem. I think it is ridiculously overpriced. Visor that comes with it is massive, ugly, and I could not find alternative colors. I bought a three snap visor meant for the gringo and it solved all my problems. The helmet is also heavy compared to the gringo. All this and I wish I bought the gringo."
4.0,"I'm giving this product 4 stars because it's built very well and is a solid product. With that said, I was blown away with how big and heavy it is. I am use to the thinner, smaller oil vile that you can buy at Deseret Book for a few dollars. When I took it out of the package I was shocked at how heavy it was. I put it on my keychain, and took it right back off and put back on my old one. Very quality product, personally I just can't do the size and weight but if you are okay with that then this product is awesome."
4.0,So beautiful! It isnt as long as other mantra necklaces but still great!
4.0,"I love this gown, it fit great, the colors are still bright after several washings, and the dino pattern was perfect.  The material is soft and stitching is great but I wish it was a little thicker. That being said I am very happy with the purchase."
4.0,They are cute on but wide for my face.My face isn't that narrow.
4.0,I really like these alot. But the little screws don't stay tight on the glasses all the time.
4.0,I love the dress I am 5’4 weight 165 and it fit me fine even had a little room still left.. The only issue is that the green dress isn’t the color in the picture. In person it’s more of a lime green
4.0,"Very cute and soft material but ran a big snug. I wear it, but next time I’d order a size up"
4.0,Great. Inexpensive. High quality. Great gift for poker buddies.
4.0,This was very cute the only thing I didn't like was the decal on shirt is a thick decal. But very cute will be wearing alot this summer
4.0,Beautiful dress but it was too wide in the hip area.
4.0,"I was looking for a cartilage earring that was not a stud. I came across this one & some of the reviews made me cautious.<br />When it arrived, I immediately tried to put it in. My ears are small but i had alot of trouble getting it in. I had to take pliers and pull the two balls apart in order for it to fit comfortable. Once the swelling was down, it fit great! I love it so much that i wear it all the time!"
4.0,"Nice soft shirt, runs a little big"
4.0,I would maybe a half size or size up.
4.0,The ears width is pretty small so it looks a bit funny on an adult head.  That said with my noggin the band still stayed in place.  The sequin work is super cute too!
4.0,"Good quality material. Fits a bit small especially around the shoulders, but the size guide is more or less accurate it still fits in the chest and torso. Overall a good shirt."
4.0,Very cute.  Chain longer than I expected.  I probably just didn't read the length info.
4.0,"I love dresses with pockets so this dress was perfect! I am 5'6"" and 120 pounds and I ordered a small. Looks great with a belt."
4.0,"First one didn't work, had to return and get another."
4.0,Is a thin and a bit stiff material but look nice. I order it in a XL but is more like a medium (which is my regular size).
4.0,"These are very slippery! I have curly and easily broken hair, so I've been trying to find only polished wood, silk, or satin hair accessories. I have worn these scarves in my hair several different ways now to see how they worked out and each time I was happy to see I could carefully slip them out of my hair and not find bunches of my torn hair caught up in their material. I'm also pleased with the patterns that I ended up with as vibrant and holiday-funnish. Finally, the way the scarves came packaged was awesome! They come shrink wrapped or vacuum wrapped (in my first picture) to safe space in shipping and they didn't hold onto any wrinkles when unpacked or anything.<br /><br />Headband - these are jut a tiny bit short for a headband. I technically have a small head, can wear the smaller headsets that other people think are too tight. I was able to tie the scarf in a headband, but only in a double knot as there's not enough length for a bow and you still end up with very short tips as ""bunny ears"". I had no problem with it falling out of my hair as a headband during the day, and it slid easily out and also unknotted nicely without struggle so hairs caught in the knot didn't get pulled out.<br /><br />Ponytail Holder - This was the one area I was most disappointed in. Because they are slippery, naturally you can't get them tight enough to hold up a higher ponytail, not without damaging your hair. That's not really their fault, it's a sort of sacrifice you make with curly delicate hair, do you want to have tight ponytails or do you want to have hair? hehe. They were a nice length though with enough scarf left over to wave along with my hair and show them off which I liked.<br /><br />Braid Holder - Does very well as a braid holder, you can wrap it around several times and it will hold the ends just fine, with plenty of leftover to hang loose below your braids for flair.<br /><br />Weaved into Braids - I loved wearing these this way. They hold their flat shape good so that you can hold them flat against your braid section and it will weave so that the entire pattern shows on the scarf if you do it right. And my hair is about 3 feet long, I was able to tie a circle around my hair at the nape of my neck, weave in the scarfs with the braid, and have enough at the ends to tie it off with about 3-4 inches left over to flutter."
4.0,It keeps slowly loosening.  Other than that I love the way it looks.
4.0,"Being the first ratchet belt I've owned, it took awhile to get use to the mechanism for loosing the belt. It is a nicer fit than the one with holes. The only draw back and the reason for four stars instead of five is it isn't 100% leather."
4.0,Fit Perfectly...i'm 160 lbs and the medium fit perfectly a little big on the arms but its nothing too extreme. Definitely worth the buy!
4.0,Great quality for the cost
4.0,"These bibs are well made and serve their intended purpose.  They do not have a plastic coating on one side, but are thick enough that most all spills are caught by the terry cloth.  It would be great if these had a snap closure at the neck instead of velcro.  Even when the velcro is connected together, it will come undone in the washer and catch on the terry cloth causing it to pill. We removed the velcro and replaced with large sew-on snaps which work great.  The size of the bib is more than adequate to cover the user's clothing, but not so big that it gets caught by the users arms when eating."
4.0,Wrong size but they would probably be cute if they were right
4.0,Excellent thickness and stitching. Size was just a hair off. I would buy again.
4.0,Exactly as pictured but too big. Go down a size from your trie size
4.0,"The shorts are well made and the color is exactly as in the picture.  My only problem is that the size for the age that I bought for is too large.  I cannot imagine a child of that age range being as wide in the waist as the shorts are. Even with the draw string, they are too big."
4.0,Most of the gems have fallen off
4.0,Added these to my plain nude pumps for a wedding. They definitely took the shoes up a notch. So pretty! I definitely need more colors.
4.0,"For the price, I'm glad I got these. I'm generally happy with them. Way better than sleeping in a regular nursing bra since I don't need support. If you have a long torso like I do, you may find the straps are almost too short (and of course not adjustable). I wish the straps were not quite so wide, and I could do with regular elastic instead of the &#34;lace&#34; stuff. But it isn't noticeably scratchy when I wear them. I wash them on normal settings for colors, and hang to dry, and they haven't shrunken, become scratchy, or pilled. I like having the option to put inserts or nursing pads in these."
4.0,"Nice quality and very durable. Only a bit larger that I thought it would be, but nothing I can't live with."
4.0,"I own one, and bought a few for gifts.  Thin, lots of card room, feels great, looks great....  for the price, stop thinking and just scoop one up!  Youll be glad you did!"
4.0,This is a really cool ring.  I like it.  I have gotten a number of compliments.  It is kinda big so it will get noticed.
4.0,"Working in a warehouse, I just wanted some cheap panties that wouldn't ride up under my uniform.  All but 1 of the panties fit me.  The 1 that didn't was noticeably smaller than the rest of them when I tried it on. Other than that, the panties are ok. They don't really ride up and make me uncomfortable so that's a plus."
4.0,They seem pretty cute and my dad loved them.
4.0,Cute and flattering! Great for the price
4.0,Great fantasy football draft board!  Very large and easy to read. The preprinted stickers were perfect and the fact that they include a marker and blank stickers is great!  Highly recommend his product for your fantasy football draft party!
4.0,"Cute shorts. Just see through! So if you buy white, I have some thing to wear under it"
4.0,"I love this. Very comfortable. The top is a bit sheer, so I like to wear a tank top under it. Other than that, it's great."
4.0,The material was like jersey. I thought it would be more cottony. Also the washing instructions recommend dry cleaning. If that’s the case I’m not happy. But the dress is very nice. Love the color and fit.
4.0,A bit big can’t someone make these 4 woman but the shirt was a nice additiom
4.0,"It's too big for me (I'm 5'1&#34; and ordered a small) but otherwise it's very nice (good quality but has a chemical smell). Customer service was pretty good, too--I asked about mailing it back and they told me I could keep this and get something else instead."
4.0,"I'm a little on the taller side and it's a little short, but it works. Quality is excellent!"
4.0,10 fits like a 9
4.0,Arrived quickly. Son likes it.
4.0,"The dress looks great and is flattering. There is clear plastic elastic sewn into the waist of the dress that is very annoying. I am going to hand sew a strip of fabric over it so I can wear it without going nuts. The elastic is probably needed because the fabric is so soft and thin, but it would be better if it was fabric elastic."
4.0,"I love these pants and they work great but just note that they are very long. I typically like a little longer pant but these are far longer than average. If you have long legs then you are set! I am 5'4'' and 150, got size 30 and they fit perfect."
4.0,Great replica. Fits well and strong magnet. Paint chipped slightly (really insignificant) and attachment point to watch became slightly loose but I did &#34;wear it hard&#34;.
4.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; and weigh about 120 lbs. I typically wear a US size 2 or a juniors medium in similar styles at retailers like Forever21. I ordered the Women's Off the Shoulder Crochet Lace Patchwork Casual Dress by SheIn in a large based off of their provided measurements from the seller. I wear a 36C bra and opted for the large based on the dimensions in the chest. The large fits well. The neckline is elastic and comfortable to wear below my shoulders like the model shows. It is tight enough to stay put without riding up or being too loose that it falls down. The body is loose as shown, but has a waist line just below the chest and opens to the skirt. The dress is on the shorter side, hitting mid- to upper thigh, great for date night or drinks with the girls. This dress is a great piece to throw in your suitcase for vacations. It is lightweight and comfortable during the summer months.<br /><br />The material is a cotton blend. It is lightweight and great for summer nights. The hems and seams are all well constructed and smooth against the body. The lace detailing along the edges is well made. This dress is easy to clean and care for. It washes on cold with like colors and dries on a normal setting. The material does not wrinkle too easily, great for wearing all day long or packing in your suitcase.<br /><br />The Women's Off the Shoulder Crochet Lace Patchwork Casual Dress by SheIn is great for spring and summer. It was the perfect dress to pack on my car ribbon vacation for my wedding anniversary, my husband loved it. It's cute and sexy without trying too hard. If you are ordering this for yourself or as a gift, keep in mind that this is not true to US sizes and pay attention to the sellers size chart. I recommend ordering a size larger than usual. Luckily, this item is Prime eligible and offers hassle free returns if your sizing is not correct. At $20, it is competitively priced. Similar styles retail for $30+ dollars at brick and mortar stores.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
4.0,Love the dress!! Only problem I had was the lacenon the back ddnt lay as flat as I would have liked but otherwise! Very cute ! Satisfied!
4.0,"I bought a large and it fits good, I just wish it was a bit longer. I run in between sizes and thought sizing up would give me more of a relaxed fit top. It does not have a designated front or back so the hem is the same on both sides. The listing looks as though it would be a bit longer in the back. It’s still a great long tee for lounging around in with a pair of leggings."
4.0,These work!
4.0,"Only problem with this suit is the crossover on the front sometimes means the lining is exposed - other than that it's a really cute, flattering and modest suit!"
4.0,"Really cute top. Arrived a few before they stated. Got it on a super good deal. Usually wear a large, so I got a xxl, and was a bit snug in the chest. So buy up a few sizes."
4.0,"Comfy, what I wanted."
4.0,"If you’re looking for a low cost LBJ style hat, this is probably your best shot. It’s definitely not a fine fur felt, but it is all wool felt and very stiff. The brim doesn’t snap down as well as the real thing if you wear it that way (I don’t), but if you steam this hat it’s easily trained. I got a nice gentle curve in mine in about a minute with a teapot.<br /><br />The inside band is fabric. There is no liner.<br /><br />I gambled since no size was listed, knowing I could return it. I was sent a Medium, which surprisingly fit my size 7 ½ head. There is an adjustment strap inside to fit a bit snugger, as well as fit tape included in the packaging.<br /><br />The hat was shipped in a box with protective sleeve and spacers inside."
4.0,"Good product, fits great. Good quality at a great price"
4.0,Showed up sooner than I expected. Just like in the picture but silver.
4.0,But kept me warm enough
4.0,I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and it is really nice.  It's exactly what I expected and she really likes it.
4.0,Really cute and hasn’t turned green yet. Star deducted for size. Thought they would be smaller
4.0,I love these! They aren't heavy and I can choose the length and they don't move. Simple and lovely.
4.0,"i like the product it is very, and i mean very cheap for these 9 elastic chokers i started wearing one and never took it off, Although it is slightly smaller than expected it fits me and is loved!"
4.0,Very sad that this dress did not work out for me - but nice quality and very pretty!
4.0,"liked the ring but the sizing ran small, I ordered a 5 ,it gauged at 4 1/2, ring looks great but its small"
4.0,I really like the fit and the fact they don't fall down after being on my feet all day.
4.0,Perfect fit. But gets too hot real fast on the back of the neck. Wish the back was ventilated.
4.0,"The material is very thin but they are waterproof. I sat with my butt in the snow for 20 minutes and did not get a wet bum. I do recommend layering up though. I wore two pairs of leggings underneath and it was sufficient enough to keep me warm in 18 degree weather. The waist is elastic in the back. First I ordered a size medium and they fit a little loose so I returned and got small. It’s a tighter fit which I like but because of the mandatory layering underneath, it’s a bit restricting after a few hours. I should have kept the medium. I’m 5’4, 135 lbs."
4.0,Attractive protection
4.0,very effective
4.0,"Very comfortable sweater.  The knit is thinner, almost like a thermal knit, but it's warm enough to keep me comfortable and it's not itchy.  Not quite as long as I had hoped, just a little past my hips, so I wont be wearing it out with leggings any time soon, but I had read that from the reviews so it wasn't a complete surprise.  Bought it mainly to wear with my pyjama bottoms when the weather is chilly and it will do quite nicely for that.  The material stretches a bit, but it's not clingy, which I really like, too many thinner sweaters out there that end up looking like spandex on a curvier girl, even when you buy the correct size.  Overall, a solid purchase and will be picking up some more since the weather is starting to change.  Normally have to buy a 3x in thin sweaters because they don't hang right on me, but the 2x works in this one."
4.0,"This is precious! The bottoms are a little too big, but other than that it’s perfect!"
4.0,Shirt was better than expected more detail in the font on the front.  Where it says Perfect 10 there is ten spelled out in Perfect and 10 in every letter and number. Colors pop out. No mention of Tye Dillinger’s name which I like.<br />Fit as expected. Perfect fit for me not too big or small. Material is the heavier cotton so 1 star off for that. Nit the most comfortable to wear but not uncomfortable. Like a pair of jeans needs to be broken in.<br />Yes I recommend this shirt.
4.0,Poor quality of the stones
4.0,"I picked this cute t-shirt up for my nature loving daughter, it could really either be a leaf or a feather. I love the graphic, but the fabric could be better. It is labeled as 70% cotton 30% spandex, but it feels like it should be the other way around. More spandex that cotton. It has a sheen and a silky drape to it more common with synthetic fabrics than a cotton garment. It also is clingy, so if you are busty or have any lumps bumps or rolls, stay away! My daughter is 13 and at that point where kids clothes are too small but women's clothing is kinda big, this is long on her and a bit broad in the shoulders, so she has plenty of room to grow. To protect the graphic I washed this inside out in cold water and hung it to dry. It did not shrink and there was no color fading and the graphic did not crack or peel. All in all, my daughter is happy, she loves the color green. This was the perfect shirt to wear to school on Earth Day!"
4.0,Product ok love it used for school
4.0,I gave it a four star instead of a five star because the clothing had quite pew of strings on it hanging but overall it is so pretty I got the burgundy one or red wine whatever and let me tell you I got so many compliments on it and I looked exactly like the picture if you  have big chest like me I am a triple D a large looks really nice but your boobs will not be covered
4.0,"Cute earrings, not too heavy, but the surface of the pink bit melted when I blow dried my hair. It’s not a big deal, and didn’t effect the look honestly. Just don’t expose them to heat or they may melt a little and ruin the smooth texture. I’ve worn them often since buying and they haven’t turned my ears green, and the color of the metal hasn’t changed any/worn down."
4.0,The only sock i can find that fits my extra wide size 12 feet. Other &#34;wide&#34; socks i can't even put on my toes. I wish they had a no show version. These are more durable and comfortable than the long versions. Beggars can't be choosers I guess.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Exactly what I was looking for. I'm 5'4&#34; weigh 170lbs and this dress only down fall was it was too big for me. Really long too. If you're a short person you might have a hard time having it fit right. I'm wearing high heels and I still am tripping on the dress lol.<br />Gotta return for a medium.
4.0,"Shrunk in the dryer, but i will buy again"
4.0,Buy your normal size.  I sized up based on reviews.  Usually wear 14-16 - purchased 2X.  Only needed XL.  Okay for work.  Wore under a loose sweater
4.0,I love the material. Its just a little too big in the breast area which is odd because my breasts are big. However I love how the bottom fits.<br />I ordered an large in the grey.
4.0,"I wanted a little extra something for my undead/skeleton costume, I saw this and I got excited<br />When it got here it looked a little strange, the stitches are a bit thick and its likely that if you leave it on all day it'll be uncomfortable and may cause irritation<br />It does have a good size range and paired with a costume it looks good"
4.0,"It does its job, it's but too big but that's fine. The cover seems a tad flimsy it's just a removable plastic and the paper is too small. All that being said the big panda itself let's you know it's your bag."
4.0,"They ended up being too large for me, but a perfect fit for my partner."
4.0,I would recommend getting one size up. However they broke on
4.0,I love this dress! Especially the thick material they used..Lots of compliments 😍 Thanks
4.0,Perfect little black dress.
4.0,They jeans are super soft & very comfortable.  The ONLY drawback is that I'm a petite lady & these jeans are to long (had to get Alterations)& the &#34;boot cut&#34; was more like bell bottoms....wide leg. But I do love the fit otherwise.
4.0,I love the turkey earrings.
4.0,Feet are feeling better then they have in years
4.0,I like the shirt and the way it fits. Im glad I got a large instead of a medium. The only thing I didn't like was the colors were very light but in all fairness one review I read stated just that. I wore it to the gym and it was very comfortable.
4.0,"I really like these earrings.  However i dont reccomend them for a dath piercing.  Thats what i ordered them for and im currently wearing them. My issue with them is with the part of the earring that enters your ear. 1st its curved in a way that makes it very very difficult to get in your ear. 2nd once you get it in, if you get it in, it comes out very easily. I have them as closed as i can get them but they still come out.  For example,  if i accidentally hit my ear with my hand while drying my hair they come out. Or even while sleeping.  Dont get me wrong, they are super cute and are good quality earrings. I just wanted to point out some issues that may arise if you are using them for a dath piercing as i am."
4.0,"beautiful watch, band is comfortable and nice on."
4.0,True to size. Decent fabric. Would order again.
4.0,Great t one of the best I have ever had would love to have multiples in every color
4.0,"Cute dress, but it was a bit of an awkward fit. The chest was too big while the waist and below fit great. I wish there was a pin or clasp at the end of the v neck too. Overall, cute, but too awkward. for reference, I’m 5’5, 150 pounds and I ordered a medium."
4.0,It fits my feet very well. much better than any other flip flops at this price. looks stylish too... So far working as expected.
4.0,Came within shipping dates and looks just like the picture. I just wish it was a bit longer.
4.0,"These fit correctly. The soles were a little thinner than I expected. I have plantar fasciitis and was worried that they would hurt my feet, especially my right one.  I wore all day on Friday at work and no problems. I sit at a desk most of the day so I don't know how they would be walking in them all day."
4.0,GO COWBOYS!!!
4.0,"I got this purse for a wedding that was coming up. First, it was a lot bigger than I had expected - I definitely did not read the dimensions prior to buying which was my bad - but you will definitely be able to fit a lot in there! My only complaint was that the glitter rubs off a little when it is rubbing up against clothing - I wore a black dress and it was slightly noticeable. It does look great though for nicer occasions - I got some great compliments!"
4.0,"These are cute belly rings, but I thought they were gonna be bigger and softer rubber. The balls are small and the rubber is kind of hard.  I have one that I purchased at Walmart that has a larger ball, and the soft mushy rubber, and more spiky.  Anyways, they will work, just keep in mind the rubber end is smaller than the picture looks, and the rubber is a harder rubber.  These shipped directly from China, so if you have one you bought here in the US, don't think they will be like the US one.  But a good price for 10 of them. I just personally prefer the larger softer rubber spiky ball.  I would recommend."
4.0,Help out on an oyster farm.  Wore while scrapping barnacles from cages...gloves held up & were comfortable.  I received cuts from previous gloves....these were just great with no cuts.  Will order again.
4.0,"I love everything about this shirt and how adorable it looks on.  It does fit somewhat small so I purchased one size larger - even with it being one size larger, it still fits my son snugly (as it's supposed to style-wise). LOOOOVE it.  If only they made a matching one in an adult size, I'd get one for my husband, too ;-)"
4.0,Like the shades
4.0,good product.didnt slip
4.0,Very cute nose ring and easy to put in your nose but it’s very small.
4.0,"Wish it came in different lengths, but after trimming it works well (though it doesn't look as clean)."
4.0,"I purchased this pin to use the ribbon pin for an award (medal) I wanted to change from a necklace to a pin. The ribbon is slightly smaller than I thought it would be, but will work well enough until the pin I need becomes available again. Definitely worth what I paid for it."
4.0,Great for &#34;pandora&#34; type bracelets.  Used as a Christmas gift. They were exactly as pictured and good quality.
4.0,"I really like the bracelet, but it's hard to get on by myself because it's somewhat stiff."
4.0,Super cute.  I kept one and gave one to a friend.
4.0,"5’9 185  it fit snug , just slides down a litte so I got a bigger size. Love the color and the feel . I got dad breast the jacket was tight on arms and breast area."
4.0,Cute plain dress. Ordered according to size chart and was way to big. It was well made.
4.0,these shoes are very comfortable
4.0,These trunks fit as expected and meet my husband’s expectations.
4.0,They were nice but the neclace keep spelling of the string that goes around your neck but beyond that it was good
4.0,"Comfortable and helps feet not have pain at end ofnlong days.<br />Don't stayup, have to pull up at times."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b9c4935a3446fe75906ce5a5c9385c61]] So pretty , only thing pockets in the back are not sew correctly :/"
4.0,"Cute design.  It does stretch out quite a bit on my calves, probably wouldn't on a tinier person :) not really ""compression"" socks to me but will be fun to wear sometimes for work."
4.0,"Very comfortable and seem like they will be pretty warm,it's only °17 here in Minnesota so that's not really a fair test for gloves that are rated for -°30 but in °17 degree weather my hands are toasty warm."
4.0,I've had them for a few months and they haven't broken
4.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves it and wears it all the time.  Hers is the knit one with fringe, reversible purple and black.  It is very versatile."
4.0,"Nice sweater, but I had to replace the buttons. They're not yellowish tan as shown.  They're a horrible plastic peach color that really clashes with the green."
4.0,This dress is very elegant. It is designed beautifully. The fabric material is very soft and flows well.
4.0,The leaf is so pretty! The chain is a little thick and I wish it were longer like in the picture but overall it is a pretty necklace at a great price.
4.0,"This definitely runs small. I wear an XL (sometimes a large) in cardigans and I had to buy the 3x in this. It’s auper tight on the arms so if you carry ANY weight in your arms, then you’ll want to size up at least one, possibly two sizes. It’s stretchy but not that stretchy. I’ve washed and dried it and it didn’t seem to shrink any which is good. It’s a pretty color just wish it was a tad more cozy and roomy rather than skin tight."
4.0,"Wasn't sure what to make of these boots  upon receipt as they appeared to be made of a leather substitute.  After two months of wear, they are still in good shape and are still comfortable .I've been working on my farm as well as doing construction, so they are not being ""babied"", yet I wear them daily.  I will definitely buy another pair when these {finally} wear out."
4.0,"I was worried when I first saw it. I've had terrible trouble with subpar velcro over the years. I was thrilled that I could barely get it on by myself. It stayed exactly where I placed it and the bottles didn't get in the way. But the bottles make me worry too. My girlfriend said she thought one of the bottles was slipping out, but it never fell. I'll update this when I'm out in the sun with it. I wonder how sweat will affect anything."
4.0,"This dress is so cute! When I saw that it's a mini dress/looked at the sizing chart I decided to order in a medium just to play it safe, but a small definitely would have been ok!"
4.0,"The material is not a soft tee shirt material, it’s very firm and tight. If you get the right size you will love it, but too small and it is rather tight."
4.0,I love the fabric and fit of this tunic.  HOWEVER...I was expecting burgundy.  It's not burgundy.  It's red.  It's a pretty red!  But it's red :)
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but the most beautiful thing is, stitching. I customized its measurements and they did take it in consideration. I gave 4* only because bottom is not fully patiala salwar it’s kind of semi. Otherwise it is nice dress and jacket is super cute, duptta is very soft. I gave measurements according to us size so kurti is bit tight for me but it had extra layer of stitch. So, i removed it and fits good now.<br />Thank you"
4.0,"Required compression sock and have a hard time due to leg width.  Measured per size guide and these fit great!  They stayed up at the top due to wide band.  Also, loved the open toe, as during the day, previous compression socks would shift pushing up on toes."
4.0,Really nice gift for husband who doesn't wear much jewelry.
4.0,"Is  a little large but super soft and comfy, not sure how durable it is though."
4.0,I love the slippers they're very very comfortable they seem to be made very well but the sizes run small so if you order I would order bigger then your original size. But I do like to where I am even though they are tight on my foot.
4.0,"I’m no sneaker head or anything but it worked for my ZX 8000 LEGO shoes. They’re clean, pristine and I’m definitely happy with the product. My only issue is with the brush. It seems to lose bristles a bit quick."
4.0,"I would recommend going up a size unless you want form fitting overalls. These are not true to size. Otherwise, they look like the picture. I'm returning mine and going up one size."
4.0,A bit plain by itself but layered and with a long necklace this shirt looks great.
4.0,"This is a replacement of the one I owned previously. So this one is just great as you see I wanted one again after I ruined my previous one. How did I ruin it?  By prolonged soaking it in Woolite.  The black leaked out to the white.  I think the problem was in &#34;prolonged soaking.' If I had removed it shortly, it probably wouldn't happen.  Just my opinion, not a guarantee. Hope you enjoy it.  I did.  Even bought one for daughter. Great for mild winter."
4.0,Bought these to replace my ray ban glass lenses that cracked. Fits perfectly they are plastic so significantly lighter than the original. They are polarized works well.
4.0,Bought this (in white) as part of a Frozone costume. I think it's made for kids. (Really tight on my face.)
4.0,"Looks great,feel a difference"
4.0,Simple; inexpensive. Just what a needed. Only dislike is weak backlight.
4.0,"This was, I thought, a god Father's day gift and found out he doesn't use it. Says it's too bulky with all the stuff he puts in compared to the wallet he's had for about 10 yrs."
4.0,"My husband really loves this. The crest is stitched and I’ve seen other hats where it’s just ironed on and comes loose easily. I wish that the size adjustment was a little easier to hold the size, but overall, a great purchase."
4.0,Loved the item seller no comunication
4.0,This was a gift for someone so im not sure.
4.0,Great dress very comfortable.  Received many complements
4.0,PICTURE MAKES IT LOOK MORE CREW THAN IT IS-BUT THEY FIT SO GOOD- I'D ORDER AGAIN
4.0,"This is such a great idea.  My husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out.  I like the designs of these so it is not as embarrassing to pull out if you are out to eat.  This is super long, and I would prefer it to be a little shorter but that is ok.  It is also a little tight around my neck, but works."
4.0,"They are very long for the size, but my husband doesn't care, because CAPTAIN AMERICA."
4.0,I loved it. I just wish the jumper had loop holes for the belt. The material was comfy but not stretchy. Im 5&#34;7 130lbs and the medium fit me good. I jus wish the pant leg was a little bit longer. I would recommend
4.0,"People stop me on the street and say, &#34;Hey, that's an awesome belt you have on!&#34;.  They then ask where I bought it and I tell them.  They can't believe their ears that I received such a great deal on such an awesome fashion piece!  I'm styling now and making friends along the way.  Who knows, maybe someday soon I will find a hot model and move out of my parent's basement to live with her.  That alone will make my acne clear up!"
4.0,"Got a large and the top fit pretty well. It does have quite a lot of fabric at the bottom of the dress, so be aware it may feel a little tent like. The red was really pretty though.<br /><br />It was perfect for a summer tailgate in 95 degree heat!"
4.0,Just right for my niece...
4.0,"A little on the cheap on the quality side and should be half the price, but it will do."
4.0,"Very pink, not maroon at all"
4.0,Great value and fast shipping.
4.0,like em... lost em they was good fit just dont know where i put em guess i order some more
4.0,Look like the pic but have not wead5it yet but it's ok
4.0,Awesome handbag. Better than what I expected
4.0,I'm not sure if I have weirdly positioned ears or if these are just tight but they didn't seem to fit me right. I have let others try these and they were fine but I find that I struggle to find anything that fits right. They work well for the little bit that I need to wear a mask with my job and out while shopping. The wash easily and keep people off my back about wearing a mask so I'm happy.
4.0,fit's excellent never thought I could look good in a thong bottom Large fits great for me being a plus size girl (no I'm really just a chunky healthy weight)
4.0,"It is beautiful.....however, it is a bit large (the ring and bracelet will both need to be altered to wear it)."
4.0,"These ear cuffs are just beautiful! I've already received multiple compliments on them. They are quite heavy which indicates the quality level and they're also  very sparkly, which I love! They fit perfectly around my ear; snug, but not too tight. You're gonna love these!"
4.0,It stretches a lot! The slack doesn't really look good in my opinion
4.0,Pretty at look and soft at touch
4.0,"I bought this shirt in 2 other colors because I love them so much. Love the super soft material. It draps over my body nicely of which helps hide the extra baby weight I put on when I had baby #4. This particular one is actually a darker gray than advertised and almost looks like the black and white one I bought. It also runs slightly bigger than the all black one I bought. Nevertheless, I still like it very much. I love the black one but the striped ones I bought I like very much."
4.0,The nose rings arrived on time! However the tragus nose ring that I was excited about had one of the small jewels out.
4.0,"Nice and comfortable top. I ordered a medium, but could have easily gone with a small. The sleeves are a little long, but I'm short (5'1""), and so are my arms. The material does look sort of like a thermal shirt, but I like that. If you order this, you might want to size down. Other than that, it is a comfortable, everyday top! I think you would like it."
4.0,These are lovely except one thing. They have very tiny butterfly clutches on the back. They aren't substantial enough to allow the earring to sit straight on the ear. They droop forward. I had to buy different backs with stabilizers to keep them straight.
4.0,Super Cute for the price. Bought to wear over my bathing. I would have given five stars but the red one bled on the white one so it’s more of a light pink. But I’m keeping it anyway
4.0,This top runs small.. I got a large which would normally be plenty big enough for me I'm 5'5&#34; 145..but it was just more snug then I like. It didn't look bad..just wasn't comfortable. I didn't feel like getting an XL... I was worried that it might gap in some places..Super cute colors...I had to return it.
4.0,The material is absolutely amazing. Great product for the money. Does shrink a little after washing. But still so very soft
4.0,"I’ve only had these for two days*<br /><br />I think these are pretty good for the price.  You get three basic, but necessary colors and they hold up well.  I wore mine the first day around the house, cleaning and such.  It held up fine.  I only readjusted it maybe three or four times throughout the day.  Which is near nothing in comparison to other bandeau bras like VS...<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is that some have tags and others are tagless.  It’s a little annoying because I have to cut it.  And also my white one had a thread loose already, but it’s fine otherwise."
4.0,Holds my money as advertised.
4.0,"These shoes are holding up well so far, comfortable to wear and fit nicely. Most of the gems have fallen off. We've had them a couple of months. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,I love these soooooo much. Just the nose protector ripped right off
4.0,Runs small in the length of the arms
4.0,Good descent product. Arrived quick.
4.0,"Everything was good...ordering, shipping,etc. Size was jus a little off compared to others Vans of the same size."
4.0,"It seems like a nice set but I should have checked the measurements more closely. The top fit well, maybe a little roomy even, but the waist band felt a bit snug for my 29” waist and I knew that would bother me so I returned the set. I am 5’5” and 115 lbs with a straight build and normally fit size small and that’s what I ordered."
4.0,"This is a great bag! I've used it for everything from the beach and pool, to keeping it in my car to store back-up baby and toddler supplies. So easy to clean and convenient to carry.<br /><br />My only complaint is that one of the straps keeps coming unscrewed super easily, which is kind of a pain. I don't know if it's the mechanism of the screw or the design of the strap!"
4.0,My daughter loves this watch band
4.0,"This Cool-Shop premium classic metal frame sun glasses look very classy and stylish.  There are 9 different color combinations to pick from and I opt for the black one as it goes with what I wear most.  With the approaching of summer, I just cannot wait to showcase it.  It comes with a very cute hard cover sun glasses case that zips around.  The case contains also a soft cloth that is for protecting and cleaning the sun glasses.  It is so light weight and have very comfortable nose piece.  I love how wide the lenses are and the polarized function is great.  The frame is very thin and light but is very sturdy feeling.<br />While I do love how stylish the sun glasses case is, it does emit a pretty strong smell.  I let it air out for a few days and it was resolved.<br />I was chosen to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"Great value for the price.  The boots served me well this winter.  I coach and watch hockey and used them during snow blowing my driveway in a northern climate.  They were warm enough.  They needed some support though, so I bought some cheap inserts to make them comfortable enough to wear.  You will need something to cushion your feet."
4.0,Nice little card case
4.0,Beautiful I'm 5'3&#34; somewhat long but ok with heels or wedge shoe
4.0,My legs didn't hurt after working 12hours today  and the socks didn't roll down ❤️
4.0,"I bought this watch as an everyday / business casual accessory, it has exceeded my expectations; my only drawback with this item is that the buttons became discolored.  But in fairness this may be due to body chemistry and not product quality."
4.0,Looked exactly as advertized but the material caused some irritation. I have sensitive skin so this will not be the case for everyone!
4.0,"As my fellow big-headed brothers and sisters know, finding a fitted cap is a big challenge, but you'll be happy to know this cap fits like a glove, er, fitted cap. I'm kicking myself because I didn't read the description and missed the part about it being 100% acrylic. It's a very sturdy, well-made cap, but I can't wear it for too long because it makes my head so sweaty; I mean dripping wet! This cap does not breathe AT ALL! Great hat, terrible choice of material."
4.0,They are fine just a little loose on my head.
4.0,Its Beautiful!
4.0,"I'm 6' tall and weigh ~165 lbs. In size medium, the top of the onesie fit perfectly. I wish I the legs were a little bit longer and the fit was a little wider in the hips and thighs. It is comfortable."
4.0,"Yeah its a nice piece of costume bling that unfortunately i will never get to wear, why? 'Cause i ordered it without paying any attention to the length of the bracelet so by default i was sent the absurdly short 7 inch size. Amazon and the companies that sell goods on it really like people like me who just find it a major hassle to return merchandise (unless its a very expensive item). However for a lower priced bauble such as this I am not willing to go through the process of repacking, taking it to the post office, yada, yada, yada, so i suck it up and next time vow to be more careful and read the entire web page before i hit the yellow but it button. the item came in handy nonetheless as I used to it to give as a late xmas gift to my sister when I saw her for NYE. she claimed to like it, it fit her just right. As I mentioned before it seems to be good item nice heft to it and nice luster. Lets just hope the plating won't start to flake off anytime soon. If you're a regular sized guy you will need at least an 8 if not 9 inch long bracelet, but keep in mind they are not sizable. I give it a thumbs up for the reasonable price and the seemingly good quality of the product."
4.0,Overall large fit. The neckline is very wide and as a result the shirt shifts around during exercise.
4.0,"They were very comfortable and warm, and the nonslip feature makes them perfect for hardwood floors.  but I am somewhat confused because it said three pairs, but I only received one pair.  Was this a misprint?"
4.0,"The actual charm is the size of a dime and it is very cute! My daughter loved it and planned on putting this on her charm bracelet, but it is just a little large for her and gets in the way. The quality of this charm is just as pictured so I was very pleased."
4.0,"These glasses are pretty fun, I have to admit! My kids love me to wear them lol! The only downfalls to me are that the nose pieces get caught in my hair when I put them on my head so I have to put them in my purse when we go in anywhere or I don't want them on for whatever reason. Might not be a big deal to everyone! And they come with a cute leather case for easy storage!"
4.0,Runs a little small but its a nice long vest.
4.0,"I had to buy an XXL to fit my stomach. As a result, my shoulders and chest are not receiving the benefit of the shirt. Too loose in those areas. I've only worn it once in the week that it's been here."
4.0,This dress would have gotten 5 stars had the dress been made in U.S. not Asian sizes. Bought as a gift for gf and had to return for a larger size. A buyer should go at least 1 size up. She did look hot in it though.
4.0,"got this for my brother as his first casual rosary. Great look and weight to it, discouraged to find out though that after 2 weeks the black paint is already coming off : ("
4.0,"The collars need re-shaping. It is often uncomfortable due to the collars bending inwards. Except this, it is comfortable and pleasant to wear during hot weather."
4.0,Pretty but hard to read
4.0,Fit my little sister smaller than what it should’ve
4.0,"EXCEPT FOR THE SIZING ISSUE...WAY SMALL , IT IS A GREAT QUALITY SHIRT AND VERY PRETTY.  WISH IT FIT ME"
4.0,"it fits loose, which I like. I just wish the bottom portion had a little curve to it or some shape to it. it's just all straight with no curve to it. overall, very comfortable and I like that you can place the safety pins however you please.!"
4.0,Finally a Brand that conforms to............ US Men's Sizing and 40+ UV protection. Wicking and cooling performance is adequate for humid weather when there is some amount of a breeze. Comparable in performance to my Tommie Copper Compression recovery shirts at a much better price.<br /> Aero Tech may become my preferred products.
4.0,"Recently, I purchased this watch. It fits well and has been working fine. An alarm can be set and a signal for every hour."
4.0,"Very comfortable and sexy.Would have got five stars but legs ride up to much. I am 6 feet tall. Maybe strap under arch, like the old ski pants days. Have black and grey xxl . My waist 33."
4.0,This dress came so quickly and fit great!
4.0,"It's very pretty, not lightweight. Looks just like pictured. The only downside and the reason I took one star away is because the hole is so small it was very hard to get the ashes in there."
4.0,Thought they were going to be a tight fit for my size but actually seem to work well. Length is long before the I like baggy
4.0,Cute and very light
4.0,"I bought the bra for my 11 year old daughter.  And it fit great. And she said it was very comfortable.  That being said, she is a child and has barely started growing breasts...this bra doesn't look like it would support someone with chest size much larger than A or B. This is a great little bra for our needs!! Will probably be getting more!"
4.0,Great product will shrink quick wash alone
4.0,"It's beautiful veil for the price. The comb did come off, and I believe it was glued the wrong way anyways. But I sewed it myself... no biggie. It was fast delivery too! Thanks!"
4.0,Beautiful! !!
4.0,"I like that the uppers fit my foot like a glove.  I wished I had chosen gray as I think the features of the shoe would show better in gray (as shown on the website photo).  The thing I don't like about the shoes is that it doesn't have arch support.  So after wearing them for a couple of hours my feet starting to get tired.  But overall, I think the shoe is worth the $50 bucks I paid for them.<br />I need to add one other fact.  I found them too warm for summer (as the uppers go pass my ankles) and too cold for winter (the material across the top is a type of mesh that lets in cold air).  So far me, the best time to wear is in the Spring and Fall."
4.0,Nice tie clips recomend.....
4.0,"The material is a bit rough, not very silky, and very sheer but it will get the job done for what I need it for."
4.0,Pretty much exactly what you'd expect. The balls are extremely tight to remove and install. Which is a plus but makes it tough to put in.
4.0,"Shoe Size: 9-10 depending on the shoe.<br />I previously ordered this same product through another carrier and was surprised to find that these 2nd ones I ordered fit a bit snugger than the first.  I ordered a variety pack previously that was nude, black, & leopard print.  This time I ordered both a 3 pack of just black, & a 3 pack of nude.  Since they are a little tight on me, they start to hurt a little at the end of the day if wear them both to work and throughout the evening.  Not enough I stop wearing them though.  And unfortunately because they are tight, my toenail can start to create a little hole.  I would assume these would be ideal for a size 7-8, but they still work. The fabric feels great on, but with a shoe that's internal material is also slick, it can be a little difficult to walk if the shoe isn't a snug fit.  It's really only a problem with one pair of shoes I have and so I wear a different cotton set I have with those shoes.  After a few washes the little plastic grips on the bottom can start to come off.  Overall I like them better than any others I have found.  They're easy to adjust on most shoes so you don't see them.  Or the nude blend in ok."
4.0,"I like the design, but wanted to put prescription lenses in. No can do.  Also feel a little...would like a little more substance...."
4.0,IMPRESSED! These are a great buy for a cheap practical shoe for a growing child. They look very nice for being off brand and my son said they are very comfy almost feel like slippers. They do not have much a grip on the sole so def. not for playing any sports or running but good for just an every day school or play shoe!
4.0,"So cute, but beware, they run super big!  I was going to exchange for a smaller size, but at the rate my little guy is growing, he should fit into them in no time!  He loves playing with they, and they are made out of super soft, squishy material.  Very cute!"
4.0,fits alil small but still like them
4.0,"*UPDATE* 3/25/19<br />I returned, & a new necklace was sent out the same day this return was initiated. The new one did not have the defective twist. It laid as a “bib” necklace beautifully. I wore it to my daughter’s school auction, & I kid you not, received no less than 20 compliments on it over the evening.<br />The only BUT... is that the fastening loop is still inoperable. I just used a 2” extender & looped it through to make it work.<br /><br />**********<br />I so much wanted this necklace to work. The colors are beautiful. I was going to wear with a royal blue dress for a monochromatic color party. But good grief, as the other reviewer said, there is no physical way to “latch” this closure. I think the bead is meant to go thru the loop, but that’s not gonna happen.<br />Also, it’s assembled twisted. There is no way it will lay flat as in the photos. It gets locked up on itself. I will be returning."
4.0,"This is a cute little romper. Usually Amazon clothing tends to run a bit small, so when I looked at the sizing, I assumed a size down. But, I do think the specs it noted with the small being about a size 4-6 are accurate. My daughter is 4'11"" and 90 lbs and usually wears between a 00-2 depending on the outfit. This outfit was really large on her. The arms are a bit more open and hang more than I would like. It has a tie in the back. I think the thing I wasn't expecting is that it was a one piece instead of shorts and a top. The only tag on it says it is 100% polyester. It does feel like it is a stretchy polyester material. It is soft and it is a really cute outfit. I would recommend."
4.0,"Jewelry look beautiful. Ring could’ve had a little more bandwidth. Other than that, I like the jewelry."
4.0,Fit as expected very warm yet light... I’m on the go all the time so they are perfect for me.
4.0,Found that this sweater ran somewhat narrow. Would of preferred sleeves a little wider were if you had a top underneath would not be soo tight. Otherwise sweater was great.
4.0,It fit but was a bit tight on my arms (muscular).  I can still wear it!
4.0,"The inside of the jacket is almost like a windbreaker material, which wasn't something I had expected, but actually made wearing the jacket for long amounts of time more comfortable. I did have to starch the collar to get it to stay up, but otherwise it was perfect for my outfit."
4.0,Love it fits like a glove for the curvy
4.0,"Should've read the dimensions. I did not realize that it was as big as it is. Don't get me wrong, I still love it and wear it everyday. It's sturdy and a nice piece. I replaced the chain, simply because I like tucking my pieces in my shirt. I just can't think it would be cuter if it was a little smaller."
4.0,"The material is super comfy, but the legs are incredibly short and the band is very low-rising, which made the overall fit pretty uncomfortable. Customer service is incredible though, and they helped me get them swapped out for a different product that fit me better."
4.0,"Git it, it works,"
4.0,Very beautiful but the chain was very thin as soon as you put it on an hour later the chain broke sorry
4.0,Love the top. Fit is what I wanted. I have ordered before in another color but this time I ordered the turquoise and the color was a grey-blue. Love the top & the color was acceptable so I will keep it. But it was definitely Not the Color pictured.
4.0,I love the material. The shirt fits nice and the only complaint would be the cold shoulder arms are too big. Wish they were shorter but everything else about this shirt is nice.
4.0,This is a nice looking band. I bought this because I like the look of brown leather but didn't want any stitching or unfinished leather edges. It fulfilled what I was looking for but I was hoping for slightly softer leather. The leather has a vinyl-y feel to it and I fear that it won't age very well. I find the sport band to be slightly more comfortable but prefer the look of this band. I switched out the silver strap lugs with gray ones that I bought separately.
4.0,"It seems to be a good quality product, but I will have to return it due to the sizing.  Thanks!"
4.0,I am now the favorite &#34;hippie&#34; Aunt. :-)
4.0,my little girl likes it
4.0,It's a cute shirt but it's a little short. It sits right at the waist line.
4.0,"Love the way it fits!!! Perfect for me!! (5'5,150 athletic build). It is sheer so be aware of that! Can't wait to wear it this summer!!!"
4.0,"Before ordering, I read that this item runs true to size; however, I ordered my size, and it was a bit snug. The quality of the dirndl is great, but the apron and top could be made with a better fabric considering the price of the items; the fabric is that rough sort of fabric typical of cheaper items.  Overall, I wasn't disappointed, but I should have gone with the size I wear in formal gowns, which is a size up from my usual size."
4.0,"Downside, gets dirty super fast. Upside, it’s economical."
4.0,"The material is SO SOFT, but the v-neck is too wide-set, so my boobs fall out in the night, which is uncomfortable. I'll definitely keep wearing the boxers, but I think I'll have to do away with the cami."
4.0,"These are well-sized for the western body.  I have 2 pairs of the black and one of the gray.<br />The light gray on the black pairs is a little off-putting, but I eventually plan of getting around to dying the waistband and cuffs black.  The black on gray is a much better look."
4.0,"The size, thickness, looks are all great, but I had to leave it in the garage for several days to air out.  Whatever chemicals are used (I am guessing to color it) are strong.  Once it aired out, the smell was fine."
4.0,Love this dress. I’m usually a 2x but they didn’t have my size so I ordered the 3x and it fit perfectly.
4.0,This sweater is perfect.  It can be dressed down for a more casual look or dressed up for something more classy.  It is super comfortable.  It is a heavier knit so if you're looking for something light this is not the sweater for you.
4.0,It is very tiny but still very sparkly and has not broken apart yet !! Love the color
4.0,The only downside is the neck bothers me a bit
4.0,"I have tons of skimpy bathing suits, but I needed something for taking my son to family swim night and other family type outings. If you're busty this might be a little small on the top area if you get your regular size. There's really no way to adjust the top.  So, while there's an option to wear it without the tank, I wear it with the tank on. But with all that said, I absolutely love the way it looks on me."
4.0,"I like this, it's super cute and very comfortable once in. Getting it in was the hassle. It might have just been me, but it seemed way more difficult than the others I've put in, and bending it back to normal shape was weird. But it's in now and I like it."
4.0,"This is comfortable, just wish it adjusted smaller than it does. I guess I have small head for adult woman. I don't regret buying it though. It'll work well enough."
4.0,"I bought this sweater in December 2021. I wore it twice and washed it on gentle once.<br /><br />The third time I went to put on the sweater, the entire right arm seam pulled out completely.<br /><br />This was a waste of money. Cheaply made. There’s not even a label inside to indicate which is the front or back. Avoid this one at all costs."
4.0,"I loved the color, the quality of the t-shirt. I had ordered XL’s for gifts. The XL’s fit more like ladies mediums. That was disappointing."
4.0,"The actual colors are a little darker and more muted than they appear on the picture, but it adds a nice ""antique-y"" quality. The weight is nice and solid, too."
4.0,"This product is pretty straight forward.  It is a replica Earth patch that all SG team members wear.  Being stationed on a military air station, I wear flight-suits often.  They are very similar to the kind SG teams wear on the show.  Each unit has their own unit patch that attaches to the shoulders of the flight suit via Velcro.<br /><br />When I first received this patch in the mail I was a little taken aback by it's size.  It seemed substantially larger than the average unit patch's I've seen.  I was starting to think that it was a cheap knockoff, with poor attention done to military uniform items.  However, after watching a couple episodes more closely, they were indeed the same size that the show displays.  Just to be clear, they aren't cheaply made.  The detail of the thread is very well done.<br /><br />The only thing I will count against this item, is that it would have been great for the Velcro back to be already sown on the patch.  Not that I would ever wear it on my own flight suit, but hey - gotta look authentic."
4.0,"This is a pretty normal shirt. I like the quick-dry fabric, it fits well (not too loose, nor does it hug curves where you don't want it to), and it's long enough to cover most of your butt. It's on the plain side and not a favorite shirt, but absolutely does everything I need it to for a day in a kayak or running on trails"
4.0,"Beautiful color, made well. The dress fit everywhere but the chest area. I am normally a 1xl and I wear a 38D. I ordered a 2xl and it fits nicely everywhere but my chest, it is definitely a bit snug. It is nice quality material though, seems durable."
4.0,"This is a beautiful fascinator but be warned, it comes from China and took a while to arrive. As it was, I didn't have it for the event which I'd ordered it for, but that was my fault for not registering the expected delivery time when I purchased it. Oh well, I'll have it for next time!!"
4.0,"Super comfy, large pockets. Just make sure to wash according to directions before wearing or the black might transfer."
4.0,"These pants are very soft and comfortable! They are a little shorter than I would like for them to be. I am 5'6&#34; and they just barely come to my ankles. Perfect for working out in, but I probably won't wear them out much."
4.0,"Great compression socks, helps me a lot when out walking and running, my legs feel lighter and can go further."
4.0,very nice and cheap !
4.0,"Worth the money, but pretty cheap looking."
4.0,"I will know more about it next week, it is a gift but I really like the bracelet (very pretty)"
4.0,"Cute, but a little heavy so I'm constantly adjusting them."
4.0,Runs larger then I expected but I love the dress.
4.0,This works pretty well if this is the type of thing you are looking for. It can be a pain to adjust the speaker inside the hat but wasn't that bad.
4.0,super cushy in all the right spots...fit as expected
4.0,Several links that are easy to remove for sizing
4.0,I am impressed with the band but I have no watch to wear with. Ordered my Series 2 Iwatch but won't receive until Nov.
4.0,Gorgeous color and quality made pj's. I ordered up a size because I don't like fitted clothing while I'm lounging/sleeping. I'm a 36DD and the xl top was too tight. Bottom fit as expected.
4.0,"sleeves are a little tight, nice color"
4.0,Cute professional black top. It does run a bit short and I'm a short gal at 5'2&#34;. Would pair nicely with high waisted pants or leggings.
4.0,Only complaint is how easily it wrinkles
4.0,"True to size in this case.  Comfortable I'm told, and looks pretty good.<br /><br />Material is a bit thin bit this is on the less expensive side and has held fine up so far."
4.0,These CCVON Mens Moccasin Slippers are faux leather. They fit well and are comfortable. I like them well enough and the come in handy.
4.0,It's a great statement piece to have! I love it!
4.0,"I've gotten several compliments for this shirt, and overall love the purchase. It washes well, and the buttons are very durable. The only downside is that the shirt is slightly transparent and not wearable in a work related environment without an under shirt. Luckily it looks great with a white t-shirt!"
4.0,"Nice and full. I didn’t like that you could see part of the underseam on top where the part began, but I used a black sharpie on it. Looks nice."
4.0,"Had it for 3+ weeks now and it seems to do a good job.  The belt buckle hasn't failed me in any way.  What I don't like is how they designed the tail end.  It's a fairly wide belt and they capped the end with a squared plate.  I'm a big guy, and more often than I like the metal cap protecting the end is poking in to me to the point I have to adjust the whole thing.<br />If they had tappered the end and capped that, it would've been fine."
4.0,purchase for my college son. It was sturdy and not bulky
4.0,"I bought it as a gift. It is very cute. I replaced that chain on it, though. The chain was kinda cheap."
4.0,"Very cute, Fits for little girls."
4.0,"Looks nice, but stopped working after less than a week of me owning it.<br /><br />Customer service was really good. I got a new watch and this one is working perfectly. It gives me the look I want for the fraction of the price of more expensive brand names."
4.0,"I'm so happy I found these gloves! The colors are really vibrant and they look cool. Great for riding, doesn't make my hands sweaty. I followed the size chart and ordered a medium and they fit perfect. Only downside is that the touchscreen part does not work at all. I have to take off the glove to use my fitbit screen. But I definitely plan on purchasing more in different patterns despite the touchscreen issue!"
4.0,"I would say these fit more into the tights category than in the leggings category. They are a bit thin, so they will work fine for wearing under a dress or skirt, but I wouldn't wear them as pants."
4.0,Brought these as a Father’s Day gift for my dad. He loved them because they were light with a relaxed fit. He’s had one workout so far and still loves them.
4.0,I bought this watch for my 90 yr old mom & my brother who is slightly blind. My brother said it stop working. I bought in Oct. I’m sending back and getting another one.
4.0,"Good set for the price. Comfortable, doesn’t make me sweat. The top is pretty loose. I’m 5’4” and ordered a Medium. But for sleep it’s a good size for me since I like sleeping with a loose fit"
4.0,Size up one size for better fit.
4.0,"Solid product, but can be a challenge if you have long/full eyebrows."
4.0,Love this mask!!! Half way through my party the ribbon broke so I had to re tie it but other than that great
4.0,"Decent socks, but aren't the highest quality. The plastic tags did leave small holes. They still work, and I did like that the rubber stoppers on the bottom for safety for early walkers. She falls less on our hardwood with these vs non rubber stopper socks."
4.0,Super cute pajama duo!  I like that there are cats on the pajamas and they are very cute for my little girl.  They fit how I expected them too and they haven't shown any wear even though they have been through the wash twice.  The only reason I would give them a four-star rating is because of the price.  For an item that only gets used for a month or two $30 is pretty expensive.  Otherwise I am very happy with the product!
4.0,We really like it!
4.0,Love the way this dress feels and the fit was great but... you can see through it. I’m thinking of trying to exchange for another color. I got the animal print dress. I normally just get black but I wanted something different.
4.0,"The pants are a bit hard to pull on,  but once on they look grand."
4.0,Perfect for yoga.  Stays put.
4.0,Very cute and true to size. The teal fabric faded after washing.
4.0,Dress is a little short for my taste.
4.0,I was sick of carrying two bags to work and now this holds my water bottle plus my wallet and other essentials without being heavy or bulky! I also love the colors.
4.0,The item was delivered in good time as a prime member.  The earrings are gorgeous and have very good weight to them. For the wife from daughter on Mother's Day and she will love them. I think they were a little pricy and the box looks good but made a little cheap.  All in all I feel it was good purchase.
4.0,Very nice it's kind of heavy nice chain and bracelet for the price
4.0,Very cute.  Runs a bit small.  Order a size up
4.0,"These are nice quality glasses for the price, my one issue is I have a pretty small head for a guy and these things are massive on my face"
4.0,"I need to protect myself from the sun due to an illness.<br />This shirt offers just that . Light weight ,long sleeves,<br />flexible, and a collar this shirt has it all ."
4.0,Good quality! But it’s way to big. I followed the size chart and it said I was an XL..I am clearly not an XL it’s HUGE. I will be returning for a smaller size. But! The quality is pretty nice! Average Amazon cosplay!
4.0,"We tested 3 belts by this manufacturer and this was the only one that came with a beveled edge.  It does give a more finished, slightly dressier look to the belt but the downside is that you cannot cut the free end if you need to shorten the belt.  My husband has a 34"" waist and this belt required extra holes to be drilled leaving quite a long end beyond the buckle.  As will all the belts in this line, the buckle is attached with some contrast thread stitching rather than rivets.  It looks pretty tacky and could be a point of weakness over time.  At least it appears to be made of a solid piece of leather rather than the bonded or vinyl junk so common these days."
4.0,"Super cute!  Ridiculously undersized. Price was so fair, we'll keep it anyway.  Arrived late but customer service was super fast to respond and very helpful!"
4.0,Very vibrant and the feathers are awesome!  I was afraid they would be damaged in shipping but NOPE they came perfect.<br />The strap is not adjustable like the tied ones. It seemed tight as the night went on which is the only read I gave a 4. But I was very satisfied and would suggest this mask.
4.0,Way cute my baby girl loves them!
4.0,"This is a very thin/lightweight scarf. Though it is 20 inches wide, you will certainly want to fold it at least in half if not in thirds. But, of course with cashmere, it is super soft. Nice navy blue color. At the current price of ninety bucks this scarf it’s at least twice the price it should be, but overall I like it."
4.0,"THIS IS BEAUTIFUL I'M SERIOUS...BUT the motor DOES run out so be careful about just leaving it blown up constantly, it does burn out. I have had 2."
4.0,"The rating is fitting for the product<br /><br />I would recommend this product for teenagers, young adults and even anyone that you like such items."
4.0,Good fabric. Runs a tad big.
4.0,"Works pretty good, really like the clarity brown polarized lenses have over black verison.  Also fits a alot better than the Kirkland aviators for those of you who have tried those, these have more areas that are easy to adjust for a better fit.<br />I've been mostly using these for driving and for use in my helmet when riding on my bike.  Also holds up pretty decent on the few times I've worn them on my running routes."
4.0,Super cute. I got a medium even though I'm 5' and 120# thinking these would be closer to Asian sizes. Glad I went up a size but did pay $20 to have it hemmed and taken in the bust area a little bit. Definitely meant for someone that has a short torso. Good material. Not see through. Can't wait to wear this on my summer vacations!
4.0,This is a cute hat that would make a great stocking stuffer.  It is best for younger kids - probably 8 years and younger - given the small nature of the hat and the overall youthful design.  I gave one to a young girl who loves pink and she got a kick out of it.  It is a practical product for those who live in colder regions.  I would recommend.
4.0,"These little charms are absolutely ""charming"". And I mean it pun intended. . These are cute you can use a 6,000 glue and glue them onto your homemade cards for extra embellishments you can put them in your jewelry make and you can do all sorts of things with them they're absolutely cute specially all the little animals. Glue them into art journaling pages it's absolutely a great idea to have them around for all sorts of Glue the men to art journaling pages it's absolutely a great idea to have them around for all sorts of crafts. They're so cute and pretty."
4.0,A little big for a petite person like me but with great with the right outfit!
4.0,"My daughter loves these bracelets, and for good reason they are pretty cute. The charms are not very durable, she has managed to chip a few unfortunately, luckily she does not seem to care and continues to wear them."
4.0,"Very pretty for the price. Not a $300 ring, but you will get compliments and not be embarrassed to wear it."
4.0,"I ordered this T- shirt for my wife for her Mother's day celebration and she says she really likes the gold lettering used to print on the front of the shirt, though she doesn't know if the gold letters would be durable. Though she likes that the shirt fits her as expected and it looks great on her. She does like neck the crewneck design and styling. She says that she likes that the T- shirt is comfortable to wear, soft, smooth and gentle on her skin. She says this shirt is really cute and she likes that it matches with most of her pants, jeans, chinos and shorts, and shoes and she has been wearing it often. I'm glad I got it for her. She likes that they are made of 100% cotton materials, and the shirt seems to be durable, and she says the price point is pretty reasonable and I would recommend it."
4.0,The fit is not that great. go one size bigger.
4.0,I used it for my Apple Watch series 3 and fits perfectly! I like the style and the floral design! It’s exactly what I expected! I’m excited to wear it for spring
4.0,Was a gift to my wife and she loves.
4.0,"Fits well, material is basic cotton. Could use a lil stretch."
4.0,These were really nice but I opted to return them because it was easier for me to use the clip-ons on my regular glasses.
4.0,"Nice quality and super flattering, it was just a bit too short for work, so I returned since I was looking for work dresses. I was pleasantly surprised by this thought and would recommend if you aren’t worried about it being a little on the short side."
4.0,Fit: True to Size but hangs loosely so size down if you want it to be hug your curves and fit snugly.<br /><br />Style: This is a really interesting piece. I paired it with a belt and it looked pretty cute.<br /><br />Quality: Good quality.
4.0,I love this! Exactly as pictured! Looks great with almost anything!
4.0,I first tried this on and noticed the tightness around the chest area. Very snug but I prefer tight over loose but everyone has their personal preference. The bottoms are VERY cheeky and may cause a wedgie if too much pressure. There are adjustable string straps though. I am 115 lbs and 5'10 wearing a small. I would go a size up JUST because the bottoms are a tad too revealing for my liking and the top could be a little but more loose near the armpits.
4.0,I wish I got a size bigger because I wear orthotics so the shoe is tighter but I love the style and shiny-ness of them. I love that the rainbow colors come through. I get many compliments on them also.
4.0,The item is made well and fits as expected. I would recommend this product
4.0,"Received the dress a day early, which was a plus.  The dress fits good.  I'm 5 ft a pudgy midsection but the dress does conceal that a bit. I ordered it in a large.  The only negative that I have about this dress is that it's made in that flimsy material.  Looks kinda cheap but with the right accessories,  it can be dressed up a bit."
4.0,"Great value for some inexpensive workout gear. I have a 31"" waist and got a medium and feel like i should have gone a size down to get a tighter fit; something to keep in mind if you are looking at these. Curious to see how they survive multiple washes. If you are looking for the dark red in the image as well, you should look elsewhere; the color is more of a fire engine red, not what i was expected."
4.0,"beautiful material, very soft and given the price a real deal however too short for a beach cover up and too long for a top (for me anyway)"
4.0,Looks very nice!!
4.0,It's a good skirt for the price. Very professional looking.
4.0,They are prettier in person BUT the hooks are flimsy.
4.0,I love this dress! I ended up wearing it and as shirt just because it was a little colder outside than expected. The underarm area is kind of itchy but nothin terrible. I would purchase again! I am a size 14-16 5'4 236 pounds and I ordered a 2x! Fit perfectly
4.0,"Comfortable, warm and not too puffy"
4.0,"It’s comfy but it’s a longer skirt, and a little weird because the front it completely flat then the back has many ruffles. But there is a think waist band if that’s what your looking for."
4.0,I liked the quality for the price but my computer was too big
4.0,This purchase was a repacement for my old VB Heather lanyard. The price is really great since it's cheaper than when I originally purchased my old one from the store. It's really great to be able to order VB products through Amazon since they closed the only VB store in CA a couple of months ago.
4.0,"Comfortable and versatile.  I dressed it up for work, and wore it walking about on vacation."
4.0,Pretty good and lightweight. It's pretty tight in the arms.
4.0,"It's not my favorite chain. The finish is kind of darker and duller than my other chains. I'll still use it, but only with very casual type pendants."
4.0,"Ring runs big, so I would order a size down. Other than that it's well built and very beautiful."
4.0,"I found that The fit is as expected for me. I always seem to vary between an xs and small and the small here was perfect.<br />My only complaint is that I am a bit on the taller side, and I found that trying to wear this as a dress was not going to work. It is tight fitting without being too much on the slutty side, but it really rides up like crazy. I threw on jeans and wore this like a shirt and that seemed to be the perfect combination!"
4.0,"I have a large head, so this is a tight fit but works."
4.0,Love them well made fitted but comfortable
4.0,I got these for a family member who likes the large frame sunglasses. They enjoy them. They are a bit loose on their head and can slip off if you move the wrong way but they work good
4.0,These are nice slacks and would fit good but the waist is inches smaller than the chart says it will be
4.0,"I like these lanyards, they look nice and are great to use with face masks.  They make wearing face masks much more convenient.  One of the clasps broke off when I was manipulating it to attach it to my mask straps.  I think they are a little fragile, but if you attach them and leave them on without messing with them,  they work just fine."
4.0,Wish it was a little bigger...just means I should carry less.
4.0,"The glasses are good. They are not as dark as I thought to protect from the sun as well, but they do help a bit. The lens is also a bit bigger than expected.<br /><br />Good for the price."
4.0,Nice casual dress. I'm 5'2 and 115 a small was a little loose but I still really like it.
4.0,This is great for the 4th of July!
4.0,Wish the fabric was a bit better quality but I didn't pay that much for it so you get what you paid for!
4.0,These boots are actually very nice. I'm 5'5 and wear a size 10. They came up a little past my knees. They were comfortable for a while. I was walking on road and rocky sidewalks and that made them a bit uncomfortable. They aren't too wide so I believe that added to it. One other reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars is that they do slide down. I have bigger thighs so that could be a reason they don't stay up. Other than that they are very cute and I loved them.
4.0,Love these sunglasses. Had them for a week now and the polarization & tint is enough to prevent you having to squint on the brightest of days and they feel very well made. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is they seem a bit wide or at least they could have been curved a bit more so they didn't look flat when worn.
4.0,"My daughter loves this but, the material is like a polyester, very thin and it runs very small. Got the large, it was too small, got the XL, still not any bigger. So be careful."
4.0,Ordered a size up like many reviews stated.  I feel they're just a little bit long.  They're cute...nothing special
4.0,"My husband loved this dress on me and I received many compliments. My only real complaint is that it was MUCH longer than shown in the photo.  I am 5'6"" and even with heels it was too long in the front, just above my ankles. No way could I wear flats or even lower heels without tripping on it in the back. Also, the chiffon in the front of the bodice was a little too sheer for me so I had to add a layer of the same color chiffon so I didn't have my cleavage showing. Pretty dress though, and I plan to wear it again for Christmas. I thought it was well made for the price."
4.0,They look huge!  I ordered an 11 because I read they run small. My husband wears a 10. I can't wait for him to get home and try them on. I'll review again to give the verdict of size. Then later a verdict of experience. Thanks!
4.0,muy bien oscurece un poco el cuero y ablanda el cuero
4.0,Very loose  fit.  It will require a belt and some ironing.  and also a slip since it is somewhat see through.
4.0,"I have a family member who is a full time caregiver for someone.  They have been using aprons to put on their elderly person they take care of but they tend to be a bit large and this person sometimes is a bit overwhelmed with them.  We decided to try out this bib.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a pretty straightforward bib.  It has a gorgeous print of a blood moon over the water with a reflection on it.  It is lined with a light blue lining.  Both fabrics appear to be synthetic, perhaps polyester.<br /><br />CLOSURE<br />The closure of this bib is velcro.  It does cover from shoulder to shoulder.  When wearing with the closure shut, it stays put and does not shift wildly.<br /><br />CRUMB CATCHER<br />The bottom of the bib snaps up to form a pouch to catch crumbs.  It does not work too great, as it tends to fold flat on itself as the wearer moves around.<br /><br />NO LABELS<br />One thing I am not happy with is that this does not have any labels on it which list fabric content or washing instructions.<br /><br />STURDY<br />This does tend to fold down a little bit on the shoulders as the person wearing it moves around, but it still stays put pretty well.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />This washes well with warm water by hand, and dries pretty quickly due to the lightweight fabric.  My family member does not put it in the washing machine, but prefers hand washing.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this is pretty, the crumb catcher is not always in the right position to work due to the flimsy way it sets up.  There is no fabric content or washing label on this, but it performs reasonably well.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I wish this was a bit more stable in the crumb catcher area (gussets would make the crumb catcher stay open better) and that it had washing instructions on it, but all in all, it is a decent bib and works well enough.  The design is pretty too.  The elderly person wearing this liked the colors."
4.0,I should have gotten a larger size
4.0,"it's really comfortable to wear on the inner aspect.  however, for the outer aspect, cz are set lower than the metal, it's not flushed. i can feel the edges w other adjacent fingers.  quality of cz is awesome. best 0.99 ever.  i am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"A great shirt for digimon fans. However, the only critique here and why I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 was that it is a bit smaller in the torso than expected. So if you are a bit more on the upper end of the XL shirt sizes and debating getting a 2XL, I would recommend the 2XL."
4.0,All the reviews are perfect. Runs rather small & is more of a sweatshirt material/weight but it is great.
4.0,Classy look and nice material.  Fit is very form fitting and not for someone with a woman’s curves.  Returning.
4.0,"The color is a nice shade of pink, the spring seems sturdy, and it serves its purpose as a mostly-decorative, lightweight carabiner."
4.0,These jeans are very comfortable and very loose. I've had 3 back surgeries and any kind of tightness on my waist twice as many problems. They were great for you a year and the elastic has given way in the waist. Otherwise they were great and very very comfortable
4.0,"Arrived on time, and is very cute... beautiful colors.Had to send back because medium was a bit too big for me. It's always so hard to tell, as items vary and are always so different. Will try the small."
4.0,Arrived super fast and the perfect size ive been hunting but upon opening several balls are missing and not included.
4.0,"Good construction, very nice touch, easy to identify the deslgn. these are real levels.<br />A perfect gift for the DIY guy or Builder who likes to dress,  These cufflinks look good, both<br />on dress and semi dress french cuff shirts."
4.0,"Nothing too special, but great bang-for-buck.  The deployment clasp could be nicer, but it will absolutely suffice.<br /><br />Long term, I am curious to know if water will damage the clasp, since I plan on using this strap when in the water."
4.0,"I usually have problems finding a swimsuit to fit the way I like, and I had my worried about this one just like any other. The bottoms fit great but the top is too big! I'm a busty woman and usually need a size bigger in the top than bottoms. After reading the other reviews I decided to up the size based on my bust measurements. Upping the size wasn't a complete bust because the bottoms would have been too tight then; even if the top did fit right.<br /><br />So if you're like me and usually have to buy two different sizes for the perfect fit; I urge you to not buy this swimsuit."
4.0,medium
4.0,Our grand daughter loved them.
4.0,Easy to attach to bracelet
4.0,Super cute bathing suit! Fits as expected.<br /><br />&#60;&#60;::T::&#62;&#62;*&#60;&#60;::H::&#62;&#62;*&#60;&#60;::A::&#62;&#62;*&#60;&#60;::N::&#62;&#62;*&#60;&#60;::K::&#62;&#62;*&#60;&#60;::S::&#62;&#62;<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,This is a nice mask. It is clear plastic with lace covering it. It looks classy and fun. I wore this to a masquerade ball. The only thing I didn't like about it is the glitter- it gets messy.
4.0,I usually wear a medium so that's what I got and they fit. I really love that they don't slide down or shift while waking and the pockets are great. I like the soft lining in these and they make them warmer indoors but definitely not warmer outdoors. The outside portion of the fabric has a sort of neoprene feel to it but they're not windproof. Maybe as a base layer.
4.0,Cute dress - the only reason I’m only leaving 4 stars is because it’s quite thin. I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing it as a sundress. But it’s a great swimsuit coverup!
4.0,Great she loves them
4.0,Cant beat Dooney & Bourke and for the price it was more than worth it. A little bigger than I thought but I love it. A definite purchase for anyone loving the brand.
4.0,I must have a very small head.  It was somewhat loose on me.  As described.  Fast delivery. Comfy and not too heavy.
4.0,"Lovely pants but unfortunately even with heels too long. If you have thick thighs, size up. I am 5'2 145lbs, athletic curvy. I have short legs, these are at least 3 inches too long on me."
4.0,They are beautiful and of good quality.  The backs get lose after wearing them for a day.  I lost one because the backs slid off.  I really love them other than that.  I hate I lost them after the second wear.  Buy some additional backs to secure them better.
4.0,They are beautiful and I always get compliments.  This is my third pair -- I have two others in different colors.  Excellent price.
4.0,"Very nice black leather gloves, just what I was looking for.  The black lined leather gloves with the stitching on each finger are so yesteryear.  they just don't work with a nice motorcycle jacket and the snap at the wrist is a plus. The little bit of detailing actually adds to the overall look.  These are not your Grandpa's Sunday church gloves.  They have some attitude about them Also, in a pinch, they would look appropriate if you pulled them on before knocking some clown out."
4.0,"The shoes themselves are fine. They look good and seem lightweight yet sturdy. However, although we ordered a size 10 because our son's feet are growing and a new pair will be needed soon, we received a 10.5. Believe it or not, that added 1/2 size makes them too big for him to wear. Because it's a good deal, we're keeping them, but we still need size 10, which is no longer available."
4.0,"They are more 1/2 size than they look like in the photos,  but they are very satisfactory for the price.  Despite some reviews, the nose pieces seem very secure and the earpieces are sufficiently &#34;tight&#34;. No complaints here."
4.0,No as soft as I thought but everything else was good.
4.0,"i’d have preferred the Masonic emblem (Square, Compasses & G) to have been silver, as advertised, but they were gold: you might like it better? it’s a higher quality quilted item than similar ones sold elsewhere. PS: flap is only decorative, of course"
4.0,"These shorts are great looking and thet fit very well on me. A lot of shorts have very wide mouths on the legs and are very baggy; but not THESE shorts. They are not baggy and don't swing around while you're running but they are not too tight either. The waist is very comfortable, elastic and comes with adjustable laces. I love the fact that these have deep pockets. I don't have to worry about my phone or wallet falling off which can happen in some shorts with very small pockets.<br /><br />The only minor drawback in this was that, for summer running, its doesn't have a cooling effect i expected it to have because of the mesh lining. There is fabric underneath the mesh so the air doesn't pass in as much. But its not a big problem and there are no issues wearing it at any other times. It stretches well and you feel.very comfortable. The design is great and the black color look is very solid.<br /><br />All in all, i would recommend these for multiple purposes whether it be running or non-athletic use."
4.0,keeps my ears and head warm
4.0,I ordered a size larger than than the sizing chart suggested. I shouldn't have. The size down would have fit better.  The color was nice and rich. The fabric was heavy and sturdy.  Many jackets this style are made of thin tee fabric. This isn't. The fabric felt very high quality.
4.0,Wanted to like this but the frames are bigger than expected. It didn't work well on my face but i am sure it will look great on someone else. The frames feel sturdy and the design on it is beautiful.
4.0,"I like this headband and wear it from time to time if I can't find a ponytail holder. But: I have a pretty small head for an adult, and this was tight on me until I'd worn it a couple of times. It is still snug, but it fits now, and is more useful than it was before I intentionally dampened and stretched it."
4.0,"Like the product, works great, have bought a second one."
4.0,Seems to be pretty well made plan to use when I am plowing snow on my quad i live in Northern michigan of course we dress in many layers very cold here in the winter i will update in January or February
4.0,this dress is so nice! Very modest but nice and modern at the same time. I really needed something to wear for a church function and this worked....would order again in other colors if I had the opportunity
4.0,Shamballa Black Laced Wings Bracelet Paved in High Quality White CZ Stones and Matching CZ Bead Balls..loved it and my daughter who is allergic to metals can wear it.
4.0,really nice my fault for incorrect size
4.0,Great looking locket
4.0,The buckles came pretty quick. Installed them on my motorcycle  backpack for quick release and they work great. Only have had them on a month so I can't say how they will last just yet bit I am very happy with these buckles. I highly recommend these.
4.0,To heavy for my ears and my little girls ears. But very pretty.
4.0,This dress was for a special occasion. It fit well and was very comfortable.
4.0,It was a costume.  It is a body suit that zips up and the cover the zipper with the ruffles. The jacket is attached. So it is all one piece.  My son is 6’2” 230 lbs and the 2xl was HUGE on him!!!<br />I have to see up the sides of the jackets and that made it better.. I pressed it and it looked good.
4.0,"The pockets are a bit far back, but not so bad that they are unusable. As the listing says, these are &#34;Asian&#34; sizes. I think they should say they are more like child sized. I am Asian, and normal sized for my Asian nationality, and I usually wear a medium jacket. I had to get an x-large for it to fit, and even then I could have gotten another size up. At 5'4&#34; and 115lbs, the jacket fit perfectly in x-large, but not loose enough to wear anything but a shirt under it. We live in the south so the lightweight jacket was perfect for most uses here. I gave it 4 stars even though it runs very small because I expected that, I took one star off because it isn't for cold weather, but it does look nice on."
4.0,"Very cute, a bit long on me Im 5'3, but nothing you can't fix."
4.0,I ordered the XXXL for size 14.  Definately too large.  Great for women with large chests.  I love it and will reorder in the XXL or XL
4.0,I love the color of the band but find this nearly impossible to replace the bands as they are such a tight fit.
4.0,"I love these so much, they're so cute, the colors match, they fit just right in my ear. I don't like that they seem small compared to my other plugs, but overall a good purchase. Especially when starting a collection."
4.0,Depends on how swollen my feet are when I wear them. If my feet are more swollen.  They fit better when less swollen fit looser. I do like I can use my custom orthotics in them as I have several foot conditions.
4.0,Finally an Amazon sweater that isnt Huge. Nice fit! I tried reverse...dont like it. Like black in front. Sleeve length appropriate length. I am 5.2 and 125 pounds.
4.0,Bought for my wife and she is very happy with them.
4.0,I love product overall but hate that putting keys in pocket causes puncture holes. If it was not for that then it be a product that would beas perfect as you can get.
4.0,They are good quality and my daughter loves them.  They are adjustable backs for tightness.
4.0,"This fits well and is neither too snug nor baggy. I appreciate that the zipper makes it easy to put on and remove without fuss during a day of kayaking. I was slightly disappointed to find that the ""blue and black"" style isn't quite as slimming as most other things with black sides, but it's still cute regardless"
4.0,Love that I can find stylish clothes in my size.
4.0,The fit is okay. The dress is beautiful! However the picture is misleading. There is not gold in the black one. It is back and silver!
4.0,Smaller than I expected but they are good for the price.
4.0,arrived as expected fits well and seams secure.
4.0,Fit well…it is somewhat sheer.
4.0,"These were a Christmas gift, and I was not sure since I had had some bad luck with an earlier Tipi Toe order (they were too small around the ankle). But these are nice and stretchy and are a fun gift for someone who likes wild socks. No they are not the highest quality, but the thinness makes them great for dress shoes and the cost means that even if they last a year, they are a ton less expensive than the high end socks that wear out right away. Definitely would buy these again. Just avoid the ones with patterns knitted in. Those are the ones that do not stretch."
4.0,"I am normally a 16w all day long, I ordered one size larger (18) as suggested and the dress fits but very snuggly, especially around the top. The pleats in the skirt don’t lay down quite right because it is cut a little small. I am thinking of wearing a petty coat with it so it will look ok. I am satisfied with the dress and will keep it, but beware if you are curvy you may want to go two sizes up. Otherwise, the dress is stunning, the fabric feels wonderful and high end and the dress is lined (unexpected but pleasant surprise!). I will order another one of these dresses for sure, but I will size it up two sizes!"
4.0,Bigger than I thought ... Pretty ... Comes with a chain
4.0,Nice shirt. Started to bead up after first wash though.
4.0,"I really liked the shirt and the quality of the cotton material, is really soft! Very trendy!"
4.0,"A cute top, perfect for the ugly sweater that I needed it for.  A little snug.  The arms are a tighter that I would like."
4.0,"Great basic black suede ankle boot. Consider buying half size down, especially if you don’t wear socks or wear very thin socks."
4.0,"Cute top, fits true to size,."
4.0,Exactly like the picture.... the top is a little big for me but a few darts in the shoulders and it'll be perfect. Could have done without the zipper
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. I wish I came a size smaller and had underboob support.
4.0,I was very sceptical of buying a hat for my girlfriend for winter. she has some what small head for a 25 yr old. i call her jellybean because of it. and this hat fit her perfectly. not too tight and not so big shes drowning in it. she said its very warm. winter just hit today so we will see how it fairs our mn/ wi winter temps that get down to -40 or less with wind chill.  very good product!
4.0,"I wish I could give this product five stars. The hat itself is beautiful, good quality, and comfortable. The packaging is another story. It was squished inside the box causing the hat to wrinkle. I am very happy with the product, but very disappointed in the packaging."
4.0,As with all bras they are not in a universal fit. I ended up donating them to a homeless shelter. A bit off in cup size which caused oozing boobs into my arm pits
4.0,"Ever since my father had skin cancer on his head, I try to wear a hat.  I was in the market for a new one this year and I noticed this one with the neck flap and thought that would be a good way to protect the back of my neck.  I have used it couple times and am very happy with it, I was afraid the flap would be too hot, but it hasn’t been and it is detachable if you don’t want it.  I really like the wider brim on this for a little more protection.  The only negative is that it runs a little small so it is tight currently, but I have a feeling it will stretch a little and then be fine after a few wearing.  I would recommend this to someone in the market for new hat to work around the yard or other outdoor activities."
4.0,It was a gift so I thought it was pretty
4.0,"A little short, but very comfortable. I wear it as a beach cover."
4.0,"This swim suit is very nice, it just runs very small. I would say two sizes too small. I was going to return it but the shipping back would cost more than it was to purchase this item."
4.0,"Perfect for what I needed it for. Love that you can fold it down, so it does not take up much space."
4.0,"It’s my understanding that men wear belts 1 size larger than their pants size, so this 32” belt should have fit my 30” waist guy.<br />But it didn’t really - only on the last hole & squeezed for the 2nd to last hole.<br />I’m used to slash sizing (30/32 or 32/34) for men’s belts, so this one is different.<br />It’s a really nice light oak brown color with a heavy quality aged-looking silver buckle which looks great with all denim, so if you can get the sizing right, you’ll like it!"
4.0,Have had it for 4 years or so and worked great....it just died...but had begun leaking gas from the input nipple for past few months.  I did drop it a couple times but it worked great..... I found it fairly durable....just stopped recently.
4.0,I usually order a small but got this in a medium. It’s the perfect size if wanting it to fit loosely
4.0,"Last time I relied on my bust measurement, clothes were too tight. So I went up a size and it fits just fine. Of course, I put it on over my caftan so when I wear it, I will have even more room. I don't like skin tight clothing. I like to be loose and comfortable. This top is just that. The only downside is the care: Hand Wash / Machine Wash Cold Gentle Cycle. Hang Or Line Dry. Guess I will hang this up after the cold gentle cycle."
4.0,"Runs small, fits really tight, I gave it to a friend"
4.0,"These are super cute but run a little small in size. My little girl is 7 years old and usually wears a US size 13 shoe. Her foot is about 7 & 1/2 inches long. My mom purchased some to give for Christmas and I had to reorder my daughters so I decided to order the size 1 thinking it would be a fit a little longer. I was wrong, they fit, but she don't have a lot of extra room for growing like I was hoping for."
4.0,"More and more I am trying to show pride for who I am, and this was another one of those small steps. The pin itself is beautiful, however the back pin is a little dicey to work with. I have a feeling this isn't going to be going anywhere anytime soon. And with pride month coming up... Well, I want to have something I feel comfortable with."
4.0,"It's cute, and I'll definitely be wearing it. I like that it has an adjustable chain. The only thing I would change is that the chain be a little more adjustable so as to fit smaller ankles because it is a tad on the too loose side for me, even on the tightest ring."
4.0,"Nice colors,nice material.Nice pattern."
4.0,Cards do not fit in the slots if you use the rfd sleeves.  Other then that it.
4.0,Fits perfectly my daughter looks beautiful
4.0,It was cute and very good quality but i had to return it because it was to big. I normally order a size up but you may need to order a size down. Im an xl and should've ordered a large. Its very roomy so you may can get a way with ordering 2 sizes down depending on how you want it to fit
4.0,Beautiful comfy dress!!
4.0,"I love it, is a very romantic blouse."
4.0,"I thought I ordered white, but received multiply colors. That's fine. I like them."
4.0,"Very nice, could be a tiny bit longer, but since I'm short it works."
4.0,Doesn't slip out that easily and works pretty well under my shoes.
4.0,I am wearing M but I like to wear loose fit.
4.0,Tried it on and it fits great.
4.0,"Comfortable, but looked more like men’s socks with colors a little more dull than expected."
4.0,At first I was worried that these were knockoffs but after a bit of research and wearing them I am more than convinced they are genuine. I wish the company would have sent the original case rather than their own labeled Jersey case. But otherwise a quality product
4.0,I only have one complaint - there were no &#34;care&#34; instructions on the garment.
4.0,"Pretty crappy but pretty cool, you get what you get with this kind of price"
4.0,"Got the black /black today. Very cute, easily worn with the right outfit. Got a second pair free, a free form pale citrine. Useful, cute ,and well worth $1.99 + shipping."
4.0,"Really comfy and fit ME well, I'm a women's size 9. they seemed really small for men's socks. but they're perfect for women! wash well, soft and breathe well.<br /><br />I let my husband wear them, and he liked them a lot. He put them on and was like &#34;Wow, these are SO SOFT and my feet are cool and I feel like I'm not even wearing socks!!&#34; Part of that is probably because he hasn't had new socks since I got him a pack for Christmas in college because all his other pairs had holes in them and felt like sandpaper. He has massive feet too, and they seemed to stretch well enough to fit him."
4.0,"I use these biker shorts for my rebound workouts and for riding my bike. The shorts stay in place during both activities and don't ride up. My S20 Ultra fits in the side pocket and doesn't fall out during bike rides.<br /><br />Overall, these biker shorts are comfortable and they wash/dry in normal cycles."
4.0,Love it as night wear
4.0,"Received product within 24 hours… Appears to be good quality, fits well. I am curious to see how this product holds up over time in the gym…"
4.0,"I loved these pants. The color was rich, the material was soft and they fit perfectly. That is, until they got to my feet. They hung over my shoes. I wear a size 10 regular. I am 5’2”, 136 lbs. petite build. I did not order a 10 petite because I was afraid that they would be too tight. It was a size conundrum. I was so sorry that they did not fit me properly."
4.0,"I really like the material and the design very much. It is really comfy and easy on the skin of my toddler. It has elastic band on the pants and 5 buttons on the shirt, very easy and simple to put on toddlers.<br /><br />I machine wash it and have not found any faults with it so far, love how it looks on my toddler so far. After wash, it gets really soft and i can tell it doesnt irritate my toddler's skin at all.<br /><br />It came in a nicely wrapped package and has the words SKATE USA printed with no spelling errors.<br /><br />Although i did receive this item in  exchange for an honest  and unbiased review, all opinions are of my own and Im happy with it!"
4.0,"I really love this hat... it’s color, fabric, style and ability to provide coverage all around due to its wide brim and extended flap that goes along half the hat.  It is truly a great product.... will be easy to pack and easy to dry if it ever gets wet.  It is lightweight, looks nice, and does its job to protect my skin from the sun better than any other hat I currently own.  (My neck used to always get super red and burnt just from walking my dog outside daily.  Not anymore.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was sent bent in half along the brim and, because of that, there is a crease that I can’t get rid of that not only takes away a bit from its beauty but it takes away somewhat from the strength of the brim in that location too (the brim feels more soft and broken there).  After washing and drying it, that crease has become less noticeable but is not completely gone.  However, I encountered the same problem when I purchased this hat in the tan again and black colors at a separate time because I really do love this hat and wanted to get a set for my parents.  The 2nd tan one was shipped straight and not with the brim bent in half, thank goodness.  But, because the black one was not sent with the same courtesy, I returned it because the crease in the middle of the black brim looked worse than with my original hat.  I do hope this seller will stop sending any more of these hats folded in half like that because it does ruin the hat for people.  Even if larger envelopes are needed to ship these without bending the hats, the cost to use the larger envelopes should be well worth having to deal with returns from disappointed customers.<br /><br />Again... I love these hats!  Just need them to be sent without bending the rim in half."
4.0,"Great value, stylish, functional."
4.0,"I like them very much, they are what l definitely wanted."
4.0,"The bag has a great material and it feels sturdy, not flimsy at all. I appreciate the fact that you can choose to be very secure about your belonging by using the smaller inside pouch that also has its own separate zipper.<br /><br />The only major flaw for me is the main zipper of the bag. It clearly slipped through the cracks during QC because it doesn't zip up all the way through. It ends abruptly, leaving a noticeable gap on one side and a very long extra zipper length on the other.<br /><br />Will still use the bag for sure. It still remains stylish and functionl. The space inside can definitely hold an iPad plus a host of other things."
4.0,Cute but color is much lighter than the picture and this was a gift so that's disappointing. Didn't mind waiting so long but wish it was true to the darker pink in the picture.
4.0,"Toe box could be a little wider, otherwise loving the great groundfeel and flexible sole. I literally skip around in these, they feel so good. Great price for a flat while I shop for the ultimate minimal flats!"
4.0,"The skirt is beautiful, just wish it was made to the height of the person"
4.0,I purchased 3 colors.  All mediums.  But one long.  34 length.  The Navy fit the best. But I think it’s bc they put elastic in the waste band.  Easier to get over hips.  The black and gray were both harder to pull on bc the waste was rigid.  No give.  Once they’re on they fit great.  Though. I did notice the black is a little tighter all over than the navy.  Even though they are technically the same size.<br />The 34 length I ordered bc the black seemed a tad short at 32.  However the navy is fine at 32.  Personally. I think a 33 would be better for me. But i can always have the 34s shortened a bit.  Overall.  Worth the $$.
4.0,Christmas gift that was liked very much
4.0,I ordered this for me but it was actually too big so I gave it to my sister that was here visiting. Fit nicely on her
4.0,It’s a little awkward with the tying and ruching but I kept it.
4.0,"Very sparkly, look like picture...Just wish it was a little larger. I like brooches that make a statement.."
4.0,"This is not as heavy as the blue dog design.  It is also not as long.  This is closer to a mid calf length.  Prefer the heavier fabric, but the colors are great"
4.0,"Too large to wear on it's own (as a medium, what!) but will probably be OK as the last outer layer this year in the snow."
4.0,"Nice enough skirt, but not true pink. Going more toward coral/pink."
4.0,"Handsome, as advertised"
4.0,Really liked these but they were too small.
4.0,"I just received my handbag and I am very satisfied with it. I was impressed with the packaging and the look of the bag. My only issue with the handbag is the inside lining and compartments. I am not happy with feel of the fabric it's looks and sounds like a very thin plastic almost kind of paper feel. When 2 opened it the inside sounds crunchy. I also wish the inside pockets were a little deeper/ bigger.<br />Overall it really is a nice bag and I  recommend it if you you want to spice up your look, not to mention that the price was great as well."
4.0,I wish the frame wasn't as shiny.
4.0,"I think this is an excellent shirt. I like the color and the trim and the overall layout. The material looks good and feels good. The collar works well with the overall look. I'm quite pleased. However, it is a little slim fitting. Freely admitted, I have a gut, but extra-large shirts normally fit fine (and yes, I checked against other shirts to be sure of this). This one is a little slim cut. It doesn't say that in the description, but I would take it into account when you order it. If you yourself are not slim, maybe one size up is needed."
4.0,You can barely see the pugs unless you spread the scarf open. It is warm and stylish anyways. Next time I will buy one with little pugs on it so I can see them better.
4.0,Could have had more pockets. Other than that it's good.
4.0,I like the license plate and the red color is very sharp. However the plate material is thinner than I would prefer and I'll probably use a more solid plate as a backer since my vehicle doesn't have a license plate bracket on the front to prevent it from bending. I would also suggest a clear cover to protect the printed image.
4.0,Great product.  Easy to attach to glasses and fit my nerdy glasses perfectly.  I can slide them on and off without removing my glasses and then they flip up easily as needed.  Great for driving.  My only complaint is that they seem to slightly distort my prescription lenses.  Not enough to be a big deal but they do seem to slightly alter the crispness of my prescription.  Otherwise they are great for the price and I would buy more if I needed them.
4.0,"I really like the back of this bathing suit. More than the front.<br />I want to post a picture of the back but honestly, it's too risque for me the post on Amazon. Hahaha. That being said, this one piece is revealing. I'm not in love with the front.<br />I'm usually a medium in the US and I was in the swimsuit as well, which has an accuratee measuring guide on the description.<br />Overall, it's cute ... VERY SOFT and revealing in the front and the back.<br />The straps are long and I'm 5'0.<br />See photo for what it looks like on me."
4.0,"This is a cute blouse but it’s short it seemd like a crop top, it might have been that I have large boobs."
4.0,"It's a beautiful and good quality cardigan. However, it's more suitable for fall or spring than winter"
4.0,"Fast delivery and my mom really liked it, but I have a feeling it’s going to wear out quick because the material printed on the shirt. The print feels really thick and I’m scared it’s going to crack after a few times in the dryer."
4.0,Easy step by step instructions to shrink you desired picture to print to fit in the charm. Attachment to the pin broke off after 10 minutes of carrying my bouquet. I was able to use thread to reattach it but that was tedious
4.0,"Unfortunately returning them, they are too large and don't look good on me. Love the fabric though!"
4.0,Now i know i have to get it a size bigger. For relax fit around the belly. Hahaha 2xl for there size 3xl would probably been better
4.0,These are what I expected with the exception of the metal piece. For my toddler they are a bit large but work well and keep on the mittens well.
4.0,I really have enjoyed this wallet - Bellroy has figured out one of man's age old problems. This wallet has literally decreased a pain in the rear. Great design and high quality!
4.0,Bottom is a little sheer but great item! Flattering fit
4.0,Really really really love This hoodie. It looks absolutely amazing. Just INCREDIBLY ANNOYED that I ordered it 2 weeks ago fully price and now it's on sale for half off.....
4.0,"Excellent price and excellent watch, only issue is the night light doent shine evenly. My son loves the watch and wears it daily. It replaced his other watch the day he tried it on."
4.0,"Cute, I got a medium but should have gone with a small"
4.0,"they are the most beautiful earrings i've ever owned. their is just one problem, the earring with the cat hangs backwards. You can't see how pretty it is without constantly trying to turn them, but they won't stay. the other one is perfect.I'm so disappointed because I love them so much. What should I do to fix it? is the seller going to make this right? This is not my fault but the defect of seller I don't want to try bend it and then break. Isn't the customer suppose to receive quality merchandise"
4.0,"Very cute. It seems well made. I wish it were a little bigger, but it fits my wallet and iPhone 7 just fine. Perfect for running around without kids."
4.0,This necklace is fun for fall.  The turkey is quite colorful with a lot of purple colors.  It isn’t very large but it looks good.
4.0,"not quite the girth needed for my dome. probably me not them. nice hat, good quality."
4.0,The proportion of this dress would be good for pregnant women or ladies who are larger in the middle.  Color was gorgeous. Fabric very soft.
4.0,Slightly see through
4.0,"I loved the color and fabric feel in this sweater.  I am normally an XL, but this was way bigger than I expected.  Hoping a large is a better fit."
4.0,I bought this and the orange Wrangler hat. Nicely made hats however the tags state youth on them. They’re big on both my 2 year old and my 5 year old. I’ll keep them to grow on to but they’re definitely not toddler size.
4.0,"Two months shy of a year this band broke on me. I loved this band while it worked, I just wished it had lasted longer."
4.0,"I like these gloves a lot there's 2 things that are bad with this product. 1: It's made of wool so it is definitely going to start wearing and tearing in 3 days maybe even 1. 2: With the amount of times you would need to unbutton to get the rest of the glove, by the end of Winter just maybe. Other than that I enjoy wearing these around the house especially since my hands always get cold when I'm at my PC. I recommend getting this product if you're willing to deal with main 2 bad things."
4.0,This is a well made tank top and I'd like to order more!
4.0,In summer I can't roam in jeans pant. I always perfer shorts and this short is perfect for me. Soft cloth and big pockets. And u don't need any belt. It gives u easy way to carry your work. I feel it will last longer though I am continuingly wearing it since I get delivered. I am eagerly  looking for other shorts also from this brand.
4.0,Fits a little tighter than a normal medium but not too bad. Love NXT and Johnny same face
4.0,"Fit very well for my Vision grill, but it clearly has screw holes to hold the vent to the grill so it doesn’t move. (The original had spring loaded clips on the inside that kept it snug.) This means that the vent will move a bit when you open and close it, particularly when cold. Solution is straight forward, go to hardware store for screws to hold it to the side. However, requires trip to hardware store..."
4.0,"Material is like thin jeans, fairly heavy. This is good and bad, because it doesn't flow. The top part is boxy and wont look right, at least not on me. the front doesn't move with my movement, hard to explain. it's stiff. Maybe just not my style. Really not for anyone that isn't skinny...(I am 5.5 170lbs)"
4.0,"I liked the quality of the glasses. I do wish the lenses filtered out a bit more of the light than they do during daytime use. Night time driving is great. I principally bought these to use while riding my Harley and for that they work much better than what I had. The glasses come with both a hard case and soft bag and vleaning cloth. The hard case was frankly exceptional as I thought it would be just a plain case, it’s not. Very well made and I like the cover on it. The case truly protects the glasses very well."
4.0,The rose gold color isn't really 'rose' gold- more like a less- yellow yellow gold
4.0,"I love the geometric shape of these, and they feel sturdy. The 925 mark shows on the outside of the hoop. I do have a lot of trouble putting them into my ears. The thicker and curved post with not much room to work with is a struggle for my ears with their mall store piercings. It helps to use a little ointment to ease the way. They won’t be something I can grab on my way out the door"
4.0,"Arrived with multiple hanging loose strings, but ultimately did the job I got it for. Great for after pool time for my kids."
4.0,"Product is little too long, but I can live with it..."
4.0,"Seems like a decent nightgown; good material weight, not too thin (or see-through). I have narrow shoulders and the straps would fall down, so that's why I returned it. Size XXL fit similar to a 2X or size 20."
4.0,"Nice value, but it fits a large lady's wrist. I had to gift it to someone other than who I intended it for. She liked it though."
4.0,"I'm a 6'0&#34; 140lb guy, and I wear medium everything. However, I was urged by other reviewers to order a size up, and I'm glad I did. The large fits me as well as a medium would.<br /><br />The jacket's waist is technically too short and is a little over an inch above my waist, but I learned that that is how some bomber jackets fit, so no complaints. For people looking for a heavy winter coat, that is also something this jacket is not, but also something it is not supposed to be. This jacket is like a stylish windbreaker, pretty much, but style is the only reason I ordered it, and it does that well.<br /><br />In my opinion, having to order a size up just so it will fit like a normal jacket is not a good thing, but the jacket is still quality, so I will only take off 1 star. This is a good product, one I do not regret buying, and one that I already use everyday."
4.0,Nice think material and I like the color. Not as soft after a couple of washes but still a great sweater.
4.0,Knocking off one star because the plastic lining around the toe was misshaped.
4.0,"I got this pajama set over this past holiday season for something warm and durable to wear to bed. Safe to say that I was so happy with this purchase, and am definitely going to buy some more in different colors. It's true to size, and if anything, just a tad bit bigger which is perfect for a matching pajama set. I love the collar and the sleeves on it, and the material is just so soft. The one thing I would say, is that it wrinkles a bit easy outside the wash, so I have to wear it in a couple times or iron it to smooth it out, because the cotton and material is just so soft. The color is true to pictures, and it's definitely a step up from my usual satin tanks or slip ons, especially now that the weather is cooler. It's nice and keeps you warm, but definitely breathable enough to sleep through the night with and feel comfortable. I would recommend this for sure, and say it's definitely worth the price."
4.0,Warm and soft. Runs a bit large. I have to fold the sleeves back about 6&#34;.
4.0,"Update<br />After being sad for couple of days, not just because it broke, but because I actually like it, it's perfect!, so, I reached out to the seller since it was already passed the return date, the seller was so nice and professional, they were apologetic and requested for a picture of the broken one and sent me a brand new one. I still gave 4 star because I want to test the durability of the new one. I'll update after 90 days.<br /><br />It's beautiful..I loved it, just like I want it to be, then it broke less than a month..waste of money"
4.0,Color didn't last not what I expected. Didn't look like it does in photo
4.0,As an equestrian it’s really hard to find cheap clothes to ride in. I needed a good collared shirt for an upcoming job interview with a rider so this is what I got. It’s comfy and thin but the sleeves are a little short and the airports make it a little hard to move it’s very nice quality but SIZE UP!
4.0,Earrings are cute but the piece that goes thru ear is extra long.
4.0,"It was good quality, but a little smaller than the other green dress I ordered (Fensace) so I went with the Fensace instead."
4.0,Wasn’t floor length like the picture shows
4.0,A little smaller that I would have liked but still very comfortable
4.0,"Nice leather belt,it looks nice, just got it so can't say much about durability,but every  otherthing looks ok."
4.0,It very cute . The color was a much more blue than I thought but I love the bracelet.
4.0,Works great with my glasses!
4.0,"I like the colors of the shirt, and it fit well.<br /><br />I just wish the sleeves were more loose, instead of tight-fitting around the wrist, because the tight fit, especially when wearing a watch, causes wear more quickly.<br /><br />The buttons are also difficult to button."
4.0,I don't like the way the bodice closes. The zipper hangs funny if it's partially open.
4.0,Good but different mean Chinese words
4.0,Quality vs Price ... they are okay I guess but I ordered 18 black boxes and the packaging says black. I received 18 red boxes!!
4.0,"I absolutely loved these slippers except that they were huge!  I wear an 8 in every style of shoe.  I never size up or down, I'm a true 8, but these slippers sized 8-9 were HUGE!!<br />At the time, the pink slippers weren't available in the next smaller size, so I had to buy a different style called Giona.  I think I would have been a bit happier with these, because the material is so soft, but I couldn't wait.  I will be buying a pair of these in size 6.5-7.5 as soon as the others wear out."
4.0,Nice and warm - easy to get on! BUT they have to be hand-washed - definitely a bit of a draw-back for a busy lady!
4.0,Love this dress but was loose in all places. Definitely size down if you want a fitted sleek look
4.0,Overall its a nice dress for the price.  Quality is as expected for the price. Would recommended.
4.0,"It's really cute and just as pictured in person. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it's a printed fabric and shows white through anywhere there's any stretch. This doesn't really bother me much, but it's something to keep in mind if you are busty."
4.0,its really cute but must be made for women with tiny hips...is a struggled to get on...top is perfect
4.0,It's comfortable and stylish. It feels like good leather.
4.0,"This is a great top! It is perfect for wearing with jeans. The material is a  bit clingy, but  that keeps it from being baggy, and if you wear a silky camisole under it, it will keep the clinging issue at bay. This is cut a bit shorter than other Allegra K tops, but for wearing with jeans vrs leggings, it is perfect. The color is a beautiful warm peach. The cowl neck is a loose fitting turtle neck.....just like the photo. Wash on gentle cycle in cold water and hang to dry. The material demands that a cami be worn underneath since its a bit see through. I would buy again :-)!"
4.0,Nice bag but to small for what I needed.
4.0,too small around for a covering robe
4.0,"It runs short in the front but otherwise, I like this blouse because of the print. I get compliments every time I wear it. I ordered a large because I am a 32DD but only 5'2 and it fits. However, I wear a high waisted skirt or pants because when I raise my arms, it can/does show the belly button. The print is well done but the blouse material is not breathable/natural."
4.0,"When this gets old and tired.. I Would have no issue replacing it, with the same.. if it is available.."
4.0,"i have hips ...it wouldn't pass the hip and the rip decided to rip wide open even more. i guess i will take it to a tailor to sew it for me . FYI if anyone has a hip since am black for for XL.<br />I like the product, but it doesn't fit me as i thought."
4.0,I got this dress for my daughter she likes it and says it fits properly the fabric is soft
4.0,"good fit, just as it appears in listing<br />not a fan of the exposed metal on the tab/flap, but magnet seems to hold it in place well"
4.0,"Color is exactly how it looks in photo, fabric is a little thinner that it looks, all in all nice scarf."
4.0,"Liked this shirt a lot, probably best to buy a size up though (as I did), but definitely not disappointed with the product."
4.0,"Smaller then I wanted, but the earrings were of nice quality."
4.0,This mask was purchased for my daughter for halloween. She was a zebra. It was stunning and completed her costume wonderfully. She received many compliments on her entire outfit.
4.0,"Overall a great costume. The fit was great and quality wonderful.Really looks like you were burnt like freddie kruger ,with holes and soot all over it.Only complaint was it is a bit too short on me,but that was to be expected as I am 5'8"", so it's hard to find costumes that are long enough. Nothing a pair of black skinny Jean's or leggings couldnt fix though. :) would buy again for sure."
4.0,Wow what a pretty skirt!! I thought it would be perfect! When I opened it I knew right away it would be too small. It was a smooth tight fit and a little bit shorter than I expected. I purchased the large and should have purchased x-large. I don't think the length would have mattered much in the larger size. I usually wear a size large in all my bottoms. I would have exchanged but it was too short for me. I'm 5'8'. It was really nice though.
4.0,"At first I didn’t realize this would double as a carrying strap AND a strap to use during practice! I really like that it is multifunctional. It took a little bit to figure out how to rig it up as a carrying strap, but if you use the rings as shown in the pic and just loop part of the strap through the other end, it’s super easy. It doesn’t stay tight against the mat like other carrying straps, so that’s why I gave 4 stars, but still pretty great because you can use it in practice too. Win-win.<br /><br />I was confused about the colors; there are 3 options shown and I chose “purple” but received the blue one with the orange flowers. I realized that’s the actual one shown when you have “purple” selected, so just be careful about your selection. The blue and orange flowers grew on me so it’s not the end of the world."
4.0,"Love it. Comfortable, but a little rough around the eyes. It barely fits my giant head, but it fits."
4.0,"The shoes run a little small so order a half size up, but I love the shoes overall. They fit great and are very stylish."
4.0,Center  Jewel a little loose.  Still a beautiful piece !
4.0,"These are very cute and super soft! Definitely better than expected. I am, however, a little disappointed because they look larger than I thought they would be. Luckily they are stretchy enough and loosening the braided part helps to fit my 2wk old daughter's head better. I think they'll be more fitting when she's a few months older."
4.0,"Very nice watch! The band isn't great quality, but that can be replaced if someone really wants a different band. The watch however is much bigger than I anticipated, so not quite the feminine look I was going for. Will be returning and the search for a lovely, yet sporty, feminine red watch continues......"
4.0,Watch is super well made and beautiful - as pictured. It's a bit more large and clunky than it appeared though. I have small wrists and it looked a bit ridiculous on me. But it fits my husband quite a lot better. He loves it. Style works on any gender just a bit thick and wide for tiny arms.
4.0,I never that I would like something like this but I have to say it’s my go now.  It’s warm and soft also washes up great.  I’m somewhat of a new mom and keep my hair pulled back most of the time so on the days my hairs a mess this can make me feel cute again.
4.0,"great for around the house, my grandson loves them"
4.0,It’s cute. Pretty much exactly what is advertised. Works for me
4.0,"Very small! But absolutely beautiful, they look just like the picture"
4.0,These pants are terrific now that the weather has cooled. Heavy weight they are soft and comfortable. The elastic waist does not bite or bind and the pockets are appreciated. The ankles have elastic which keeps out some of the cold.They launder nicely. Perfect indoors or out they have become my dog walking favorites.
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. True to size. Examine it carefully mine had a small hole in it. I didn't want to pay to send it back so I stitched it up.
4.0,"If you hate ironing, don't purchase these."
4.0,Soft feel and fit was good with a little extra move around when I play golf.
4.0,They worked perfectly with the band.
4.0,"I thought I was going to get a deep blue, but this is more of a purple. (I put black pants and a navy dress in the pic to show.) it looks great on, very thin but not see-through in this color. I’m an athletic, 36B, 150lbs and the Large worked."
4.0,"Gorgeous dress, I love it!!"
4.0,"I had fun with this.Everybody loved it.The crown was hard to deal with but I made it work.<br />The heart that is standing up behind her head in this picture, did not stand up.I was able to make that work also.<br />It is still well worth buying."
4.0,The fit is good and the material comfortable to wear.  The product seems to be of good quality.
4.0,A little small but it is beautiful loved it
4.0,"Oddly I have this one spot on me that just stays so cold... and that is the back of my neck where it grows into my shoulders. I needed something that would cover and warm that area. The reason I really love this item is it's also loose on my throat in front. I can't stand anything tight around my throat like a turtleneck dicky. I dropped one star simply because I like a little tighter knit weave. But, all in all, it's still warm. I'm going to measure it, and knit some myself.  I can also pull it up over my head as a hood, and there is still plenty of material to stay bunched up on the back of my neck to keep it warm. Simple tube design, but it works!  I also like the way the yarn color graduate from light to dark. Very attractive."
4.0,"My son is only 4.5 and a size 5 is snug on him, plus short in the torso. Order it big!"
4.0,"I purchased in both a large/xlarge. I'm keeping the xlarge, but wish they would make them in larger sizez."
4.0,too small. want to order again a bigger size. Asian sizes...too small
4.0,"These leggings are super cute although, they are thin so be forwarned that they won't be great for winter."
4.0,Esta bonita pero queda grande soy s y párese L
4.0,"This is a very well made and formed product. Unfortunately, these shoulder pads are much too bulky for my needs. And, I have been unable to get customer service to respond so that I may return them. But again, great workmanship."
4.0,Pendant hole was particularly small. I had to work around that. But the elephant is adorable and they made an excellent gift for some friends of mine.
4.0,"This brand runs long.<br />I am 5 foot 5 inches.<br />I would need to be 5'10"" or taller for them to work properly.<br />Waste of money 💰"
4.0,Unusually tight for even average breasts. I liked the look enough to sew the button that wouldn't stay closed. I even bought a size larger with the same problem. The wrinkles from packaging don't come out
4.0,"Fits as expected, runs smaller so went a size up"
4.0,"It's very pretty worth the price, I ordered a 2xl for my mom. It runs a bit small but still was good to wear."
4.0,"Very cute shirt, and very comfortable.  However the color isn't close.  I ordered red, and by the picture thought it might be more of a heather red.  It was actually a dark maroon, or dark red/brown.  It wasn't an ugly color, but not what I was needing.  Otherwise I liked the shirt.  In case you can't tell, the lace is only in the front, and doesn't go all the way around."
4.0,Fit good only sleeve little long forme
4.0,I received the jaspers very fast and and I like them. These eartly red gems brought my attention<br />Thank you very much<br />Eugene C
4.0,"Update: less than a year, the zipper has jammed.<br /><br />I debated this purchase for weeks, and I was not disappointed. It's very warm and heavy, and has a generous fit. I got a large (I'm 5'5"" medium build) because I hate sleeves and hats that aren't long or deep enough. It covers me well, reaches to my knees, and protects me from the cold winter wind. I love the pockets. I use the snaps as well as the zipper because of reviews saying the zipper may not last."
4.0,"It is a little stiff and long. It makes it difficulty to wear if there is a lot left over on the side and since it is bulky, it looks weird when you try to tuck the hanging part under the rest of the belt."
4.0,"I normally buy large or XL jackets, after reading the reviews, I went with a 2XL and it fits great."
4.0,Super cute little headband. Not too tight. I get headaches a lot from too tight headbands but the soft ones seem to work well. Arrived on time. would buy again if needed. Looks great with hair hanging or in ponytail.
4.0,"it is hard to get this hat to lay right and cam with bits of other thread colors in it, overall cute though"
4.0,The size runs a little smaller but the ring looks beautiful. I love it.
4.0,"THIS. SHIRT. IS. GORGEOUS! It looks and fits like an incredibly well-made shirt.<br />The fabric is not completely smooth, as if unadulterated cotton were used in the production.  I am 5'5&#34;, 118 lbs, and generally wear a small, but the XSmall fit beautifully!"
4.0,"Great product.  Very nicely made and washes nicely.  Will be purchasing more.  The sizing seemed a little large but I always hang-dry this item so that could account for the somewhat large sizing.  Very comfortable too!!  The seller of this item was very kind and helpful, eager to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase--nice people to deal with."
4.0,"Nice stretchy material and seems to be good quality, but it was too small so I had to return it."
4.0,The mask are very comfortable to wear!
4.0,A little thinner than it looks and not as plush as we'd hoped but overall it's good for the price
4.0,"These pants fit fine but they were a little “shiny” for work. It almost has a faux leather look to it. It you need a cute dress pant for going out, this is a great choice. I was looking for office pants so ended up returning."
4.0,Quality product overall but it slips a little more than my other Bison belt.
4.0,very loose and comfy
4.0,The quality to be honest isn't that great if you are expecting to use it for long-term purposes but it is perfect for my Halloween costume!<br />affordable price and good enough quality!<br />and it was delivered very fast !
4.0,"Liked these the moment I saw them.  But I had to return them, because they made me look way too fat."
4.0,"It would be better without engraved text on the face ring. As for quality paint from inside is out in the bottom text, or was not correctly painted. Ideally i would remove the text or at least dont fill it with paint. Other than that the watch i stunning.<br /><br />Would be better if slightly thiner. Band is amazing very oryginal"
4.0,They seemed too short. I got them for my 12 year old and she looks like she’s wearing high waters. I told her to roll them... I got a small thinking it’d be perfect for her.🙁
4.0,"I like the blue color, the style, and cut, of the light over lay and the strechy material. Its winter, but sometimes we get some warm days and this is perfect.<br />Thought it was too thin, not for use as lightweight overcoat, but more for comfort, style, and fashion under a thin sleeveless shirt. Bought it for my sister, she is size extra large, but I  ordered 3x to allow extra room for clothing and coverage.  She absolutely loves it. Will order another one for my other sister and maybe one for me!"
4.0,"A little big but very comfortable,  i love rhe color it doesnt wrinkle that easy either."
4.0,These are fun geometric earrings. The gold is a little brighter than pictured. Not too heavy
4.0,"I haven't worn mine, however there is nothing wrong with it (it's cute, not see through) I just need to make some alterations. I'm 5'1&#34; and it is a bit longer than I usually wear (comes below the knee in front, making me look dumpy)...so if you are tall, it will be perfect. It also runs a bit large. I'm a typical medium and I'll have to take up a bit under the arms to make it fit better. For the money, it will be the perfect St. Paddy's Day dress."
4.0,"First off, these shoes are BEAUTIFUL! I actually bought them in glitter gold as my wedding shoes! After reading through review after review, I decided my best bet was to order half a size up than my regular size. I realize now that I should have stuck with my normal size because the pair I received def are more true to size so now they are too big! I could send them back for my size but I am going to try to make these work with some inserts. The glitter gold is just so pretty I don't want to let my mitts off of them long enough to go through an exchange hahah :) They aren't the most comfortable shoes but I definitely should be able to wear them throughout my ceremony and maybe for a little while at the reception before I swap them out for a more comfortable pair. For the record, I don't think any heels are comfortable but sometimes beauty is painful, so other gals might not find them as uncomfy as me."
4.0,verrrrry pretty shirt/dress for a toddler. the lace work is pretty well done as well on the collar.
4.0,I purchase this belt for my husband.  He is happy with it and is good quality leather. The only issue needed to make extra holes in it.
4.0,Everything fits very nicely in it and it does look good. I haven't started using every day yet but I will.
4.0,Run a little small but otherwise look great!
4.0,I have generally thick thighs so I actually expected these to be a bit small but they fit perfectly! only issue is they're not as opaque as I hoped
4.0,I had Wore this for Valentine’s Day a date with my boyfriend him and I love it but it was a bit short and a lil loose at the top but I’m tiny so that’s expected.
4.0,These are cute dainty necklaces. Made to be worn together.  One gold bar and one beveled gold circle. Adjustable length. You can also wear each of them alone. The same brand also sells each design alone
4.0,"Nice fit and comfortable.  I ordered a large 34ddd, waist 28, hips 39.  Belt is really long."
4.0,"Fits great and feels good on, very soft"
4.0,"The slits on the side of this dress are quite high. I was trying to wear shaping undergarments underneath and the slits went above my knee and hit mid thigh on both sides, revealing what was underneath. I'm only 5'5 so I didn't feel that it was because I was too tall. The dress is really comfortable and the cutouts are a nice feature, however, I was not able to wear it out comfortably."
4.0,I really like the size and look of this casual bag. I would've given 5 stars if there were larger interior zippered compartments. I would buy it again. It is very cute.
4.0,Nice quality but very clingy
4.0,Nice large bag for all sorts of things. Arms durable and fashionable at a reasonable price.  Like the versatility of the shoulder strap and handles.  Lots of pockets too!  Great bag for organizing items.
4.0,"My helmet came with both chin-strap and drawstring support. It’s a snug fit, until you get it on your head, then it fits like it’s been molded to you. Caution, as some parts of it are sharp (like the mouth and chin opening, and the nasal. For the price, an excellent Corinthian helmet."
4.0,Do wish they were bigger however
4.0,"I absolutely loved this dress. I wore it on my wedding day and felt stunning. My only issue were the straps on the sleeve, after a while they kept coming down. I wish they were a little more snug, but other than that I have no complaints."
4.0,"I love these glasses, however, this is more for people with smaller faces. In the picture it looks big enough but in person they are actually smaller.<br />I wish the glasses had a wider width and bigger lens.<br />The glasses look exactly as it does in the photo."
4.0,"I love the black framed shades. I’m not a fan of the tint on the other shades, so I plan on gifting them over the holiday."
4.0,"Beautiful piece,  very seductive, very sexy.  It runs a tad bit on the small side but overall I'm still pleased and Plan to purchase more."
4.0,"Product good, shipping took way longer than I was told when purchased, came from China."
4.0,cool hat and design but it feels like a stickers quality
4.0,"Got this for a show outfit and they worked great. Lightweight, good length."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful I just got confused on the Size, so I bought Large size instead of M."
4.0,Good fit. Perfect for the beach
4.0,The led lights worked great for my board and everyone elses board thanks again for the lights I enjoy them
4.0,all in all a nice sweatshirt.  I would have liked it a little longer
4.0,"this dress was soft and comfortable, but I returned it because I did not find it flattering on me. My trouble spot is my tummy area and I felt like it accentuated this rather than masked it. the dress fit as expected (I felt the M fit me better I ordered both M and L just to see) FYI I am 5'4&#34; 140lbs."
4.0,"After one wear and wash, the blue fabric in one spot by my left knee became a lighter blue - as if it faded."
4.0,Great little lunch bag! Easy clean up and it’s cute.
4.0,"Doesn’t wash well, definitely feels super cheap but it looks cute"
4.0,"I like them, they are cute, but I bought a size XL based on the other comments made and I wished I had just gotten a large. I will order another pair in large next time."
4.0,I like it for myself but I don't think it's delicate enough for women
4.0,"These are pretty good, especially for the price and with a slightly higher than average % merino wool. However, the band at the top is a bit too tight for me and the synthetic material can be a bit too hot. They are kind of medium thickness. The knit seems durable so far..."
4.0,"It looks cute on me and I like the high waist part, somehow hiding my fat waist 233333. But it runs large. I usually wear large or 10-12 for tshirt/shirt/tank/one-piece dress and 8 for pant. I bought a large first and it runs super big. Then I changed to a medium and it's still a little big but not that bad. And since I don't have time to place another order before Ieft for my vacation, I just took the mid one."
4.0,"I love this dress its adorable, fit true to size"
4.0,These are well made and stay put and inexpensive but my only problem is that the finish looks pretty cheap. And they ARE cheap LOL but it would be really nice if they weren't quite so shiny and tacky looking. So four stars instead of five.
4.0,a little to thick
4.0,Very comfy….but way too big!
4.0,"This is an amazing romper- so cute!! It’s hard for me to find rompers that fit- usually they are too short in the torso but this was perfect. I also like that the bust line is adjustable.  The only thing that isn’t perfect is the fabric.  It’s ok, but definitely a cheap polyester.  Other than that this is great!"
4.0,"These earrings are cute and colorful. The pair I received didn’t have as much contrast between the blue and the black veins as the photos on the listing. So mostly blue, not as much black detail.  Still, cute and light weight."
4.0,I am a large and I ordered a large but it was too tight in the chest. I’m going to exchange it for an XL and hopefully that one will fit better.
4.0,"It is good for the price. I got a size medium. I am 5'3 and between 110-115lbs. I am relatively busty at a 32D. This suit is not supportive of &#34;the girls&#34; though. I feel like it is slightly big on me and wonder how it will hold up when wet. I would exchange for a size small, but the torso would be too short. I really appreciated reading all the comments and seeing the photos. I would post a photo, but people would only focus on my horrid body acne, just being honest, instead of the cute suit. I will be looking for an open cover up to help conceal it and hopefully feel confident when I wear it with that. It is a very cute style and not too overkill on the sex appeal, making it appropriate, but not too dorky. The price is great and it arrived quickly!"
4.0,"The plastic gag was a little uncomfortable, but we did enjoy this very much. Also, one of the cuffs kept detaching. Overall, I do like it, but it's not for the couples who are into rough play."
4.0,Look just as pictured. A little long and slip off the top of my ear if not careful. But super cute
4.0,I wasn’t expecting this dress to look as nice as it does! It fits snug on top (in a good way) and then skims the lumpy bumpy parts and hangs beautifully! My only complaint is figuring out how to put it on lol! I think I got it mostly right-it does look really nice. A good dress to pack for Hawaii as it can just be rolled up and not have to be ironed...yay for that!
4.0,"These are fantastic... if you have a smaller bust. I had high hopes for these and if they had fit my bust they would have been perfection. They fit everywhere else but when I put them on, since they have no give, they pulled at the arm pit area. If you wore it with a jacket it wouldn’t be noticeable but without, it flattens the boobs and not in a good way. My search for the perfect silky top for large Tatas continues."
4.0,"I got this suit for $13 and it was worth it to me. The only problem I have is the straps fall down on the sides, it’s like they’re sewn too far out but it may work better if you have broader shoulders. The bottoms are perfect. Even though it doesn’t fit perfectly, I am keeping and it was worth $13 to me!"
4.0,"Depending on your preference, I like my caps nice and tight on top. This cap is kinda big on top but it looks great."
4.0,"Good socks, they fit nice. The material could’ve been a little tougher but they work well"
4.0,These are soft and warm but they pill terribly.
4.0,Tight at the waist. Should be labeled one size smaller.
4.0,I'm a fit but I need a hat with a large brim for running in the sun.  This will be perfect. Only complaint is it does fit tight.
4.0,It won't stay on my fingers every time I move my hand one will fall off
4.0,"Loved the pattern, but runs a liite bit on the tight size"
4.0,"I like the way this dress looks the color is just as it appears on line, vibrant in person  and it is a well made garment but unfortunately I am returning it. I bought one similar from another seller but it fit to snug across my bust and they did not have it in the size I needed so I found this one. This dress is some what different and did not match the description exactly; the sleeves are not 3/4 but come to the wrist, the bodice is short so when the sash is worn and tied to the side it is right under the bust and the bow is right under the armpit. I think this would work on a petite frame, I wish it would have worked for me because it really is a well made garment and very pretty otherwise."
4.0,"Very cute! Very thin and a bit short, even for a short girl. Doesn't really cover the booty even. Still adorable. On ya. On the floor. On a hook. Lavender shade is great."
4.0,Product looks great But SMELLS fishy. Must be in the dye or tule or something. But it looks nice fits as expected and color is good!
4.0,It would have been more comfortable if it were a little bigger.
4.0,Nice warm bottoms and breathable top for great sleep comfort.
4.0,"I wear a size 12, 5’6 190 pounds and got the XL. The fit was pretty much perfect. The only complaint was the chest area was a little tight, but I do wear a 36G, so there lies the issue lol. Recommend! I got SO many compliments on this dress ♥️"
4.0,great size and perfect for concerts
4.0,This dress is beautiful but even a size small was too big for me. I purchased for my baby shower but did not like how loose it fit me from the top so I ended up purchasing a different dress.
4.0,I am 5'3 and 140 lbs and the size small fit me just right. Not too small and enough to cover me. It fits above the ankles. Purple color is nice.
4.0,"THIS PURSE IS PERFECT FOR EVERYDAY, I CAN PUT MY WATER AND AN APPLE IN THE ONE SIDE AND CARRY MY USUAL STUFF ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT MATCHES WITH EVERYTHING IN MY CLOSET, CAUSE IT IS CANVAS AND RUSTIC LOOKING!!"
4.0,Liked but not lightweight as I had imagined.
4.0,"Not too big but was bigger than excepted. Still fit, looks good! Makes a good outfit with any shirt"
4.0,"I'm a small. so thats what I ordered; a bit small, but I wear it and I love it! Next time I'll go medium."
4.0,Clean crisp look. Was looking for simplicity  and sytle. This watch delivered. Good value for the money.
4.0,"Overall it's a pretty nice top considering the price. I did read the reviews before buying and noticed people saying how short the top was. I'm 5'7, 145lbs with small boobs. I ordered a L. The top stops a little bit under my boobs. A tad too short but overall happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Nice belt, good quality material. Just note that the buckle does set off the metal detector."
4.0,Issa li tight where I have to force my head through ugh but good quality just a tad bit small
4.0,"As pictured, easy to put on, nice that bit stretches but not too much"
4.0,"Love this dress! It fits great, but of course with the price it is pretty thin. Especially up top."
4.0,It's helping just a bit hard to put on. Would buy again
4.0,Nice scarf very good gift
4.0,Quality materials and works well.  Nice compact design.  Would buy again.
4.0,"Fit was larger than expected, but this tunic top is very warm, soft and comfortable and perfect for Winter evenings snuggled up in front of the fire.  Washes well."
4.0,Appearances are great. A little loose on the face
4.0,Cute style but fabric has a strange feel. Not bad for the price.
4.0,"very nice, slim  billfold."
4.0,"Cute hat I ordered for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  It's basic, but it's as expected for the price.  She loves it"
4.0,"Love this, I do not know how it will hold up."
4.0,"Very nice piece of jewelry, the person I got it for decided against it."
4.0,"Very cute, doesn't stretch"
4.0,Ok so I did end up returning mine for the simple fact it was huge the picture made it look like a small charm at end but wasn't
4.0,i use it for every day use.looks good but should of gotten one size larger
4.0,They do the job at cancelling the noise a bit. Just look a little too big on your head compared to other brands.
4.0,Very cute and flattering. Fits as expected. I didn't realize the fabric was stretchy and was expecting a little more of a tailored fabric but it is still nice.
4.0,"What I expected for the price. Look a bit cheap. Are pretty heavy, but like I said worth the price."
4.0,"If the cups were a little roomier this would be great. I'm a 36 C cup, but they barely hold me."
4.0,"Nice for a &#34;do it yourself&#34; mp3 player, but I wanted to use it for a project to play recorded voice. The problem was that it auto loops the track of it's a single file.<br />No instructions at all so take your time."
4.0,Perfect except I did not receive the charging cord. I borrowed a cord from another gift to see if they work well. They do. You can choose the color or colors you want. My 4 year old went bonkers over them he just loves them!
4.0,"Super cute and light weight. Long and flattering. Only critique is while it does have many buttons to adjust up or down, I had to move the buttons for a more realistic fit. Otherwise I love it"
4.0,had to get the legs taken up but i still like the jeans alot
4.0,Order a larger size that you think you need. Still short in length.
4.0,It’s very good fabric but it was a bit tight for my son. He will wear it anyway but wish it was a bit bigger.
4.0,I like the style  didn't  like the material that much  they should put lining underneath the material it's too thin  forr them not to do that  also the size runs small. I normally.wear 12 or 14 I have curvy hips I order xlarge  it was too  small  so I had reorder a xxlarge  it was a little  too big up the bus part  I still  keep  it I love the style
4.0,"Super cute but pulls in the back when you sit. You have to lift it up in the back in order for the neck to not like choke you . Also you have to keep adjusting the collar so that it's not pulling more in one direction. But overall, I like it a lot"
4.0,I love this necklace. I’ve worn it consistently since I bought it! It hasn’t tarnished yet and I’m disappointed I can’t buy another for back up
4.0,Nice top and a really great price. It seemed to stretch when I washed it on gentle in cold water and line dried. I may toss it in the dryer next time.
4.0,"I LOVE the ponytail hole, but the hat is a little tall for my preference. Fits like a trucker cap and I prefer a lower profile. I'll still wear it though!"
4.0,Pockets are a decent size. The material is thick yet cooling for this summer heat. It was a nice dress to wear to work and the cut on my chest was easy to adjust so that it wasn’t revealing too much.
4.0,Great necklace for all occasions. The sheen is a bit dull but I still like it a lot. Goes great with a low cut blouse. Also quick delivery.
4.0,Like the shirt a lot. the rips on the shirt gives  it the rock look. my only feedback ladies is order up. I order a large because I wanted a bit oversized but its more equal to a small/ medium but still a good shirt and well made.
4.0,good fit and water proof from the top down
4.0,"After 40 years with the same old hand me down & threadbare pin cushion I finally got a new one! This one is larger than the old traditional one I have been using, so holds many more pins & needles, which I love! However, I am still getting used to the larger size, and the fabric does not seem quite as snugly wrapped as I would like, but these are minor things."
4.0,"Bought this & loved it, Very pretty.  never wear them to sleep or shower I thought the stretch was great and it seemed to wear Beautifully 6 weeks I was in Michaels and it split, beads everywhere! Based on the quality (which seemed very good) I think it was just one of those things! I’d give it a try"
4.0,I was looking for a long tunic to wear with leggings but didn't wanna pay a lot of money because I work with kids and it will just be dirty at days end. This feels amazing! Super soft and comfy. It is shorter then I thought it would be but still covers by bottom. I bought three more!
4.0,These fit good but only problem is I walk around lot at work and they slide down my legs
4.0,Great quality but scratched very easily
4.0,Such a cute suit but was too small.
4.0,It’s too small I had to return  Dress color look so pretty
4.0,"The small hands don't really do anything, the day dial has 39 days, and the band is really cheap, but I think this watch looks really good and keeps time well. Be ready to reset everything each day you decide to wear it because the wind only lasts about 6 hours after I've taken it off."
4.0,I really like the light-weight material. The pouch is accentuated. They just run a bit large. My waist is 35” and large is a bit too big. I should have bought medium.
4.0,"My 3.5 yr old thinks they are cool. They are soft and cute. They do run very small. My son wears a 10 and the 11/12 fit with not much room to grow. They don't seem to be as slip resistant as some other slippers we've had, but they'll do."
4.0,"Colors are great but ran a bit small for my granddaughter, age 5."
4.0,"I am a 36C bust size and I read many reviews of this gorgeous top and many people say to order a size up so I ordered a large instead of my regular medium and it was huge. I tried to make it work by tying it tightly in the back but it just wasn’t happening. So I have returned it and I will probably reorder it in a medium because other than the sizing problem, the top was really pretty and overall well made."
4.0,Good in quality and size. I bought it for my son.
4.0,"Pros - green color is fantastic, which is what I bought it for. The bag has a lot of structure and the handles seem to move very easily.<br /><br />Cons - It was advertised as having 2 pockets on one side, but they don't appear in my bag, which is rather inconsistent and deceptive. Also, the strap it came with looks like it was thrown together last minute but I won't be using that. The handles seem to be a little twisted too but I can't figure it out.<br /><br />Overall, good for the price but I wish there was consistency in telling customers exactly what they are going to get. Unfortunately I will be posting proof of the lack of side pockets on the inside of the bag."
4.0,"They're a little on the heavy side, but I use them on my silky blouses 👚.  They do great and make me look slimmer! You just hang blouse on a hanger, turn it around to the back, attach the clips where your waist would be by grabbing some of the fabric on both sides and clipping, so that middle of clip ends up in center of your back, but sitting even with your waist. Keep trying on your top and readjusting clips till it finally looks right."
4.0,"It is a bit see thru, so wear something neutral underneath,  but I love the fabric pattern and it's very lightweight. Easy access for feeding the baby."
4.0,MY BRIDESMAIDS LOVED THE COLOR- IT FITS A BIT LARGER THAN EXPECTED
4.0,"These turned out to be more like sweatpants than the leggings I was hoping for, but the material is thick and soft and they can still be worn as leggings with the right outfit.<br />They have not been worn yet, nor have I washed them,  so I’m not certain how the color and fabric will hold up."
4.0,"It feels and looks great. It's holding up well in daily use so far.<br />I've received a few compliments about how nice it looks. Weird that people are checking out my wallet, but that's part of going with something a little different.<br /><br />Cards can be a little fussy to put back into the sleeves during the first weeks, but now its fine."
4.0,"I was interested to see this suit since the majority of the reviews seemed to be fake but I was pleasantly surprised. Please note that the bottom is, in fact, hot pink, and not red, as specified. It is as pink as it looks in the picture. The suit was a little large on me, which is why I returned it, but it was a cute suit. I ordered a small and the straps were a little long and the bottom ran kind of high. For sizing purposes, this would be considered a high-rise swim bottom-- it went up near my belly button, which wasn't the style I was looking for. I typically wear a 0-2, am 5'0&#34;, and weigh 110 lbs. An extra small would have worked but it only came in a small."
4.0,Keri he rici
4.0,"Love the pattern of this dress, and it’s very thin so feel comfortable to wearing it. But somehow it’s a little bit too big to me. Try to put it in the dryer to shrink it, but looks like it doesn’t work!"
4.0,This is a nice gift for mother.  Good size.  Message easy to read.  Hopefully it will wear well.
4.0,"I didn't realize that the Venom mask has to be attached to the Spider-Man mask to work for the voice. That's fine, but I wish they could be worn separately as well."
4.0,It wasn't true to size yet it was made very well!  I gave it to my daughter!
4.0,"If you need a big ol' batch of wool blend socks that aren't too bulky, these are perfect! They come in a big plastic bag (with stilted English instructions reminding you not to throw the bag into the ocean) but they're nicely individually wrapped with little brown paper labels -- I wrapped a couple up for a friend as a gift, and they felt nice even individually.<br /><br />The socks are of solid quality -- I like the scalloped edges at the tops. They're only crew socks though, and they're only about half wool, so these aren't for SUPER cold days. But for most of us, these will do just fine, and they don't feel too bulky or scratchy on your feet.<br /><br />Mostly, that value is great!!!"
4.0,Cheaply made but cute look.
4.0,I stare at computer screens all day. Wore these once and was impressed with how much they helped. Received lots of compliments on the style too!
4.0,I wear a size medium.... I ordered this in a XL. It fit perfect!! Just had to order bigger!
4.0,"I've been wearing this necklace for a few weeks and been happy with this purchase.  I knew that I would not be happy with the length, but it was very easy to remove a section of links to shorten the length.  I don't typically take off necklaces, and this one holds up well for everyday use (not impacted from showering and daily wear)."
4.0,"Instead of the “rubber mini sole leather Mary Jane moccasins” that I ordered, I received the “soft sole ballet flat bow moccasins”. They’re very nice, just not what I ordered.<br />Super soft leather. Great stretch. Easy to get on my daughters foot. Stay on well. Seems pretty true to size.<br />Even though they’re not exactly what I wanted for my daughters Christmas photo outfit, they’re pretty cute so we will probably end up keeping them."
4.0,I needed something more durable than the kind of eyeglass cases they sell in the drugstore and discount stores. This fits the bill. It's hard plastic so the glasses can be protected. The black color is universally appealing to all users.
4.0,"I love the heart shape and quality of the stone in this earring.  It's very flattering when worn in my cartilage piercing.  Just one downside...it's quite a bit bulkier than it appears online.  Could be my fault, as perhaps I didn't read the description carefully enough.  All in all, I would recommend this earring, but not if you're going for a daintier more delicate look.  I'll buy an additional earring - hopefully with the same quality, but smaller, just for a softer look.  Great quality, great seller - just make sure it's the size you want."
4.0,"I got this as a gift in the color black. Looks just like the picture and it's a very nice and light sweater. I've been looking for more long sweaters like this, so I might buy myself more! I'm usually an xs to a s in tops."
4.0,"4 stars because they are super thick - they hold moisture so really hot to work out in. BUT, they don’t roll down, you can’t see through them and they slim your tummy area. Care instructions say to lay flat to dry - follow those instructions! Accidentally dried them and they shrink a bit - thankfully losing weight so it didn’t affect the overall fit."
4.0,"pretty good, runs a little large but meant to be worn over gear so if you're not wearing anything under it get a size smaller<br />Also I've had this for just over two months with almost daily wear and its holding up pretty well aside from the seam tape on the waist of the jacket. Liner is nice with a thermal component on the inside and when it gets too hot the under arm ventilation zippers are a plus.<br />Overall great purchase minus the tape on the waist starting to come undone."
4.0,"These are super stylish and I've received a ton of compliments since I've been wearing then around town. However, the frames are pretty heavy, and  it's hard to wear them all day comfortably."
4.0,would have given it a five star....but did not get the color i ordered....... i received the orange instead of pink one ......very dissappointed....and i usually wear large and ordered XL because it says ......it runs small...... but its too big...should off ordered my normal size which is large....top part very stretchy.....other than that the dress is beautiful...so ladies go with your normal size
4.0,Fits very well and very comfortable material for  fall or spring wear
4.0,Needed a cheetah dress for my daughters bday and  the quality was good and size was confusing because I was in the middle of small and medium.<br />For my height I wanted to make sure dress wasn’t to high away from my knees. I choose medium because of length and making sure dress wasn’t too small if I purchased the small size. I think I could of gone with small because the medium felt snag a little but overall looked nice and comfortable while looking and feeling fabulous lol!<br />Recommend future purchases just make sure to get right size to get an overall best look.
4.0,Very cute and durable. Thins out a little around the hole that you commonly use but doesn't seem like it will tear
4.0,Very cute.  Form fitting hugs my hips and thighs but still comfortable due to the stretch.  Snug fit on this size 16W/ 18W (pear shape) frame but still wearable with a longer top. If you wear a womens plus size 20W or over you will need a larger size.
4.0,"Legging material feels great, leggings fit good but may run a bit small"
4.0,"It is very stiff - as in not very easy to open or to put your hand inside of. The material is stiff and hard. It is a nice purse, I love the color and it looks just like the picture. I did have an issue when I received it - it had scuff marks on the back and on the front flap part. I ended up using a rag to scrub the scuffs off. Luckily that worked, otherwise I would've returned it. Thought it was strange that they would ship an item that has obvious marks on it?<br /><br />Update - 12/7/2016 : Just wanted to update.. I have had this purse for maybe a month at most and yesterday the shoulder strap broke. Snapped right off of the gold ring on the side so I can no longer use the shoulder strap. Luckily, it has the handle but still.. didn't even last a month before breaking."
4.0,"This is not a brand that I was familiar with, so because the price was so affordable, I was a bit worried.  HOWEVER, the shirt fits well, is well made, and overall good quality.  True to size.  Don't be afraid to give it a try!"
4.0,"Adorable dress, but I ordered an XL and received a dress that has an L tag sewn in even though the bag it came in has an XL sticker. It is much too small for me."
4.0,It fits Sooo great on me that I had 4 people ask for it. I was feeling like a Million Bucks!
4.0,Really cute but the top was too small and gave unnecessary cleavage. I was worried about a wardrobe malfunction.
4.0,Washes and wears well
4.0,These eyeglass straps really work great.  They are comfortable and they adjust snug to the back of your head so there is no hanging strap.  They work great for yardwork around low hanging branches.  In the past I have lost glasses with low branches lifting my eyeglasses off without my even knowing it.  At least I shouldn't be losing any my eyeglasses.  Would have given it 5 stars but one of the straps (in a package of 3) is extremely difficult to adjust as the adjustable slides are too tight to move.
4.0,Ordered for my budget wedding. Simple and cheap without looking super cheap. I was happy with my result.
4.0,Bought for Halloween Decor and look great
4.0,"The shirt was overall really great.  It had a nice design, but on the front and back it had one little design that didn't match the rest.  I probably would not have noticed this myself, but the first time we went golfing another guy pointed out to my husband and it kind of ruined the whole shirt for him.  I love the color and it looked great on him!"
4.0,A bit larger in size than expected based on the picture so it is not a &#34;low profile&#34; or tight head fit as per the picture but its still a really nice hat for the price and looks & feels like real suede... recommended!
4.0,Very comforting and a great cushion.
4.0,Pretty excited about my industrial jewelry!
4.0,"Have to fit pads in the shoulders every time I wear it, though."
4.0,"Fits and looks great, the quality is so so."
4.0,I was disappointed and not disappointed. my only complaint was that it was small I'm normally a large. it runs small. i will be returning with a sad heart but will order another because it is still super cute and the returning is no trouble.
4.0,"Cute not as fitted as I thought it’s a bit baggy but overall a nice hoodie.  The strings to the hoodie are extremely long and the zipper is just decorative.  I would buy another one but probably go a size down, I ordered an XL."
4.0,"The bag is very nice, I love all of Patricia Nash's collection.. But this is too big!! It's a beach bag!! So disappointed, it was my bday gift to myself.."
4.0,I like the color and the shape I love to use different necklaces.
4.0,"The material of this shirt is very soft and still looks new after I washed it several times. I am 5'7 so I was worried that this shirt would be short on me but its not at all. I ordered the med size and it fits me great, I like the length of the long sleeves and the lenght of the shirt itself. I like the collar on this shirt because it can be a dressed up with heals or dressed down with flip flops. Overall I am happy with this shirt and I would buy this brand again in the future.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I found this product for a special price for testing purposes."
4.0,"Good fit and excellent feel. I do however feel the seams when I walk, but no irritation.  I definitely think I have a new underwear."
4.0,"pretty good,"
4.0,"I work security and am outside quite often, theses gloves are great in colder weather. It is a bit difficult to write with but none the less a great product."
4.0,They're pretty good except straps seem too wide set.
4.0,it was ok for the price I suggest watching a youtube video for the directions and it was hurting my tongue when I scraped up against it.
4.0,Pretty fabric.  Feminine and lightweight.
4.0,"I had originally given this product 3stars because of the small fit.  The company contacted me and offered a replacement as well as input to improve their products.  I am so impressed with the kindness and openness to critique that I am changing my rating.  The product is adorable and I'm looking forward to being more comfortable in a larger size.<br /><br />I am 5'2&#34; and 140lb with some post-abdominal surgery swelling.  I'm a size 8 (sometimes 10) and 34D<br />After reading some reviews I got an XL which are a tight fit!<br />The top is good for lounging (it's literally held on with one tie in the back), but it does have padding to prevent see-thru on the white fabric, and the ruffle is super cute.<br />The bottoms can be worn above the bellybutton or scrunched down a little to rest right at the bellybutton.  The ruching is a nice detail and the fabric is quality.<br />The color is vibrant, the style is cute and the price is right!"
4.0,"Nice watch, seems to function well enough. Came with a dead battery.  A 2 pack costed about as much as the watch."
4.0,It's no that great of material. It is good for an Audrey costume. Pretty long so I would suggest heals. Ordered a large and I need a medium. If you have a small chest and bigger hips I would get a medium. There was a lot of room in the chest area.
4.0,A little large but after I washed it the size was perfect
4.0,"These shoes are not perfect, but I love them anyway! As you can see by my pics, they are loose & floppy on bare feet. Perfect in length, any  smaller my toes would be uncomfortable. I bought these for work shoes, to have been able to wear with capri pants or a skirt would have been nice- but without socks they are way to floppy. The strap is as tight as it will go & it's still loose with socks on- I can step in & out of them without ever messing with the strap (which I like). Even with socks they slide up & down on my heel- feels like a flip flop (I wear flip flops all year anyway, so I'm used to that feeling) but it's not something that wears blisters or rubs raw. Other than having to wear socks with them I LOVE them. Plenty of wiggle room for my toes, light arch support, no &#34;break in period&#34; (my last pair of leather work shoes KILLED my feet until I broke them in). I am on my feet all day, these are comfortable enough to wear to work then out in the evening (looks good with jeans). They are a sturdy thick shoe. Leather is stapled to the sole, not glued (my old shoes, that took so long to break in, after they finally got comfortable the glue started letting go from the sole....grrrrr ). I do feel like they clop clop clop when I walk. But they seem to be well made, I believe these shoes will last a long time. VERY pleased with them!"
4.0,"This is a multi purpose hooded cape and can be used for parties, costumes and more. I used if for a Barriss Offee costume and it turned out great. It is very soft, velvety and has some stretch to it. It was very comfortable to wear but was a bit too long for me. I kept tripping over it and had to hold it up while walking. Also, it ties around the neck and have notice the tie was starting to come apart.  Other than that good quality hooded cape for the price."
4.0,"I bought these a size too small.  The first time I wore them I became uncomfortable and had to remove them immediately.  I attempted to try them on again and was surprised that they fit the way I expected them to. I don't think I &#34;strecthed them out&#34; but they do fit comfortably and I can use them as intended.<br />Update : After washing they fit as I expected them to. I can wear them comfortably, but they really are difficult to remove."
4.0,"Nice looking watch, low profile too. Genuine leather bands are decent. Main issue is that the connection from the leather bands to the actual watch seems a bit fragile."
4.0,"Love the print but it's def. A man style cut shirt if that makes sense,  I know the description says unisex but pic looks more like a women's tshirt"
4.0,Super cute dress. I’m 5’8 and I got a small. It’s a little short and the arms aren’t as long as they look in the picture. It’s also kind of difficult to lace up but i put tape over the ends of the strings and it was much easier.
4.0,"Great sweatshirt-  not super heavy duty but for the $9.99 I paid,  definitely worth the money."
4.0,Very cute but top too big and length too short
4.0,"Nice material, we'll constructed...a bit boxy(square) in shape but for the price it is a very reasonable value."
4.0,The robe is perfect for a lightweight robe.  Colors are vibrant and the fit is fine.  The reason I did not give 5 stars is because there was NO inside tie as I had read that it did.
4.0,"They're different.  Not huge, not tiny, and very - black.  I wear them often."
4.0,"I Loved This JumpSuit I got so many compliments ❤️I am 5’5 180lbs I ordered a Large,I was amazed at the quality it is cotton and great material ❤️💯"
4.0,Great little watch but sad to note not water ‘proof’ but only ‘resistant’<br />Not prepared to wet it to test but hasn’t had issue yet with rain
4.0,The outside package calls these underwear. That is what they look like. The material and design are more that of boyshort underwear than yoga shorts. They are super stretchy and comfy though. I would not wear these in public. They are very thin. I am using them under short dresses or for exercising at home. I think the description is a little misleading.
4.0,"I ordered these slippers in large for my husband.  When they arrived, the tag said they were women's slippers, although I did not see that online when I was ordering them.  He is disappointed that they didn't fit, but I've decided to keep them for myself.  I normally wear size 6.5 in women's and the large fits perfectly.  Although advertised for adults, I would say these are probably more suitable for children.  I rated them 4 stars cuz they are super cute and comfy."
4.0,Colors are bright and the jersey fits well.
4.0,Very Nice for Costume Jewelry
4.0,"Nice print, fabric is good, but it's way too large for me.  I'm a size 8.  Delivered on time."
4.0,I'm 5'1 36DDD very curvy I ordered XL and I love the fact it hits the floor. I wear heels daily and it's perfect for me. The dress is as described and meets expected standards for the price. The tapered sleep portion is slightly unforgiving.  This dress will serve its purpose can be worn at work or an outdoor event. Heels in these photos are 4&#34; If I order again I believe a Medium would work.
4.0,"Cute, comfortable, great color. I'm 5'4"" and bought the small- it would've looked better on me if I were a couple of inches taller. Still nice and I'll wear it again."
4.0,Cute for a themed guest room or man’s cave
4.0,My 3 YO girl loves them. She’s like a raven. She’s attracted to anything that sparkles.
4.0,It didn't fit the glasses I bought this for. Maybe the next pair.
4.0,It looks just like the picture. The balls are alittle smaller than my other ones so it take practice to get them on right.
4.0,"Amazing how much these bags hold.  Packed 5 pair pants (1 pair BLUE jeans as well) 8 blouses (2 SWEATERS), The usual underclothes and still had 2 bags that were not used. The zippers don't look sturdy but time will tell."
4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars because these pants definitely run large. I'm 5'3, 115 ibs and I usually wear a small. After reading the reviews and looking at the sizing chart, I ordered an XS. They fit length wise, but they are too big around the waist. It's nothing a belt can't help with, but I definitely recommend going up to 2 sizes smaller if you have a small waist."
4.0,Love it...looks just like picture...I shower with it... has weight to it...wish chain was thicker ...
4.0,it is very nice but to big for want I wanted it for.  Will use it for craft shows were a purse gets in the way
4.0,"The look is nice. However, the sleeves are very long and The fabric is a poliaster, so not very good for a hot day."
4.0,Wonderful loft! Very nice durable material. The pockets are shallow&the snap closures are not attached very securely. Overall an excellent value for warmth with style.
4.0,I purchased the 6mm for my daughter and they were larger than expected. Also the rose gold are orange in color. Other than that it was a good purchase I paid 6.70 for them.
4.0,Not too bad. Helmet or child are not included. :)
4.0,Super cute dress. Just wish the dress material was a little thicker as you can partially see the diaper through the material.
4.0,Really like the style but it they are way too long.
4.0,"I'm 5'6 120lbs and ordered a small. It fits me well, hits a little above mid thigh which is what I was expecting. Looks just like the picture, only negative I have is it smells pretty weird out of the packaging."
4.0,Very good value and great price. Would order these again.
4.0,I love these shirts. I've ordered 3 now. They're very comfortable. I normally wear a size small so that's what I bought and they aren't as fitted as I would like but it's not really a big deal. I still love these shirts and plan on buying more in different colors! I'm 5'1 and 126 pounds.
4.0,"Love the print but I am a size 10, and this was wide on the sides. My chest measurement is roughly a 38 but there was an inch at each side for peek-a-boo bra. Would buy in smaller size though"
4.0,"Very cute top for going out! I did not expect it to be as see-thru, though, so beware... material is very thin"
4.0,These are some bad puppies right here. Fit better than expected. Nice material.
4.0,Good replacements at reasonable price. Havent had long so can't speak to long term durability
4.0,"Bought this for my cousin as a Christmas present and she loved it, the quality was good, the quality of the “diamonds” Was decent"
4.0,"So I put it on and it wasn't flattering for me. I am almost 5 feet tall and about 110 pounds. My daughter wanted to try it on, she is a about 5 feet 2, and 125 pounds, she loved it, and it did look super cute on her! So all in all I'm happy with it! I got the size small."
4.0,"It works well. It was just what I needed. So far it is holding up just fine. It really is too soon to know just how long it will last, that is why I gave it only 3 stars for durability."
4.0,"I ORDERED THESE FOR HALLOWEEN AND PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS A MOUSE BUT THEY WORKED FOR THE EVENT, THEY ARE DEFINITELY MORE ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD THAN ON THE SIDE LIKE MONKEY EARS NORMALLY ARE"
4.0,"Very nice,  larger than expected. I brought the charm for my neice,  I told her the charm itself was fine but the ring it was attached to had a gap and needed a more secure attachment. After numerous please can I wear it,  I will be careful.<br /><br />Long story short, she lost the charm in 1 day. I am reluctantly replacing it, but will take it to a jeweler to have a more secure link put on so we do not lose the new charm.<br /><br />Over all it's a good charm,  decent price,  ships really fast. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because it needs a better more secure link for attachment, or you too could risk losing your charm."
4.0,"I like it, It's just a little big."
4.0,"These are thin, but stay in place and very comfortable.  Definitely long enough, I am 5'8"""
4.0,"Nice, just as expected."
4.0,Some what's small so size up it with shrink little but such a cute shirt!! Love it my sons was xl and it was perfect forgot so girls may run smaller
4.0,Perfect. Stylish and not too short.
4.0,"I ordered my first pair following the guidelines of euro sizes equal to American sizes, the shoes were off by a size and half. Sent a email to company recommended size which I followed and the shoe is a little roomy, which is good because I can choose to wear or not wear socks. Wore them for the first time to spin class and my feet felt a lot better. So, currently no issues, except finding the correct size."
4.0,It’s great! My fiancé says it’s a good fit but it gets a bit warm. The material is thick.
4.0,I haven't tried this on a windy day but in 30 degree weather you feel pretty good. It's best if its used as a mid layer under a coat or lighter jacket. When wearing it inside it can be pretty hot. It runs big in my opinion the sleeves are really long for me and loose. I have to cuff the sleeves a bit but they're so wide it's still a bit loose. Other then that it's a great hoodie overall.
4.0,Jersey knit material. Looks better with a slip on. This dress is very feminine.
4.0,Nice suit. Very flattering. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is because the colors are darker than the picture and there were very limited patterns available in my size.
4.0,"Very nice material, just a little bit thicker than expected."
4.0,"This one seems pretty well made and at this price is a good 4 Star buy...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,My first time using this hair. Bought it for crochet but ending up doing box braids. Loved the length and texture but it did not dip well and the color didn’t seem right. It was good quality hair just not for me...
4.0,"I wear them everyday. They do not last long, maybe about a month. Especially under my heals."
4.0,Love the shirt. Just wished it came in a Women’s tee instead of just a man’s shirt. Also wish there were more styles such as a sweatshirt etc.<br />But over all I really like it.
4.0,Okay watch.
4.0,Lovely dress...
4.0,"This has been great to have with me at my office, particularly while the A/C was blasting.  BUT, it does shed fuzzies a BUNCH, so it got all over my skirt and top. Had to use a sticky lint brush to get it off."
4.0,The strap across the toe and top part of my foot was too wide and at first I had a hard time keeping the shoes on - I wish I could have adjusted the straps and that would have been fine. But as far as comfort on my support very good.
4.0,"Super cute, but order at least a 1/2 size up."
4.0,"the coin fit well, and it looks great"
4.0,Solved d purpose
4.0,Very nice very comfortable I even go shopping with them ! Amazing Pajamas
4.0,"They’re very comfortable, a bit hard to get on due to the compression, but they’re fine once u get into them.  I have really bad feet issues so they’re also tough for me to get them between my toes, but after that, I’m fine. I normally can’t wear anything at all between my toes and have been very happy to find these and be comfortable, I’m kind of amazed. I can even walk in them, unlike a lot of other reviewers that had a problem with the lump of fabric underneath but again I’m surprised it hasn’t bothered me at all.  Also, other reviews said they needed “a break in time”, or basically ease their way into wearing a long time. I had no problem. What I do have a problem with is sleeping all night in them, I don’t know why that is, but every nite I end up in pain and off they come.  It could just be MY FEET or , which I’m going to try, the fact that I have them on all day too, so I’m trying to go without them on today and see what happens when I put them on tonite.<br />Unfortunately for me, I’ve had no luck in finding any aids for for feet issues that actually help all day and night, but most don’t even help hours never mind full days or nites.<br />That’s it.<br />Bottom Line- I like them😉"
4.0,It's beautiful but it's pricy
4.0,"Fits well, overall nice design material looks legitimate. I'm excited to wear it"
4.0,Could be a bit heavier
4.0,"It's a fine casual dress for errands, the pool, etc,. I wish it were a little longer and the same length all the way around, but all in all, a fun little dress!"
4.0,this is adorable but a little tight around his neck
4.0,"If using these for exercise, buy a size larger than you need. It may be baggy on first wear but will shrink over time. Had to go back & buy next size up. Hubby uses them for exercise & the smaller size just didn't give enough room for comfort after a time."
4.0,This is the first pair of cuff links I have bought in years. So far I'm very pleased with the craftsmanship. They appear to be well made.
4.0,Nice looking handbag and the perfect size for me.
4.0,Good shoes but I can see signs of wear at the tip of the toes as its canvas rubber. I think it will go for a year.
4.0,"Is a nice looking bag, only issue is stitching already coming out of inside pockets."
4.0,A little see through but I really like them.
4.0,I used it to take Maternity photos. It is very delicate though and it tore on one of the shoulder straps. I also had it hemmed; I'm 5'2 and even in heels it was too long.
4.0,"Awesome jacket and I love it! It's just a little too large and I bought the smallest one, but I'm actually a really short guy at 5&#34;6 and 120 lbs. I do recommend this jacket"
4.0,"I love the way these look, I like how they aren't super dark while protecting my eyes and the fit is just right.  Except... I went for a walk and while turning a corner the sun was then positioned behind me and reflected off of the inside of the glasses and was blinding.  That's the one flaw."
4.0,They actually fit perfect! I just hate the high waist so I sent them back!<br />They don’t feel like denim but they look like it. They’re like those jeggings<br />Would have been cute with a lower waist! They’re in style I’m not! I don’t like mom jeans I’m not Barack Obama
4.0,"I got 3 of these to wear during chemo. They are lightweight and comfortable. Perfect for chemo head.  They do start a little tight, and need to be worn a few times to break them in, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars."
4.0,Runs small. Long shipping.
4.0,"Great deal, great fit, nice and cool for summer. Just a little disappointed that the bust threading unravels after only one wash.... still wearable but after the unravel it no longer has the cinching at the bust so they go from dress to nighty. :("
4.0,"They included the tools to remove links, yet it was already tight. Had my wrist been thicker, I would have needed to buy two."
4.0,Bought these as a Christmas present for my granddaughter. She loves them. The customer service was great!!!!
4.0,Nice Iwatch band
4.0,"It’s a good buy, quality not amazing but decent enough, looks nice and packaging/delivery was good."
4.0,I really like these. They are holding up well.
4.0,"This dress fit great! The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it says Cotton. This dress is pure spandex bathing suit material. I really wanted a cotton dress, however I'm not disappointed."
4.0,Nice fit but does not wick moisture well.
4.0,Sweet! I would like to see more selection of these. Even for adults
4.0,Cool design!
4.0,"First let me say it is getting 4 stars due to how great the material of the jacket itself it, it will be warm enough to wear for my northern winter with a shirt underneath. So that is the pro to the jacket. Now for the cons that are easily dealt with!: I am 5'6 and very small up top so it is very large in the top section, I even ordered a small, but if you are a B cup with extra padding or a C cup this will fit perfect. Now for the second, the sleeves are short. For me that is great because my shirts underneath that I will be wearing with this jacket are bell sleeves, so thats fine for me. Now the BIGGEST CON! The buttons are god awful and hard to button up as it is this very thin tiny small holed piece of elastic to go around the ugliest buttons ever that look like they have one stitch holding them on! Easy fix if your handy with a needle and thread. I'm replacing the buttons with something totally different. All in all, a little tweaking for me, it's a 4 star jacket. Oh quick note also, as someone else said, if you tie the ribbons tight the tails won't lay properly."
4.0,great value for the money but it was quite small
4.0,I like it a lot. It’s not really what I expected but I’m happy with it.
4.0,"I have a lot of trouble getting compression socks on my legs.  These are a cute design and are well made.  The company  has an excellent product.  I simply can't wear compression socks at this stage in my swollen legs.  Am undergoing treatment for this, and hope to be able to use these socks in the future."
4.0,"I should've paid more attention to the sizing, because it is a big larger than I had hoped it would be, but still fits in my relatively small purse. It is large enough that I can fit my Samsung Galaxy S5 Sport (in its case) inside of the zipped compartment. (Useful for me, as a concert-goer!!) As one of the other reviewers commented, it does have a slight smell to it, plastick-y and dye like, for the colors of the wallet, I assume. If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be the choice for you, but if not, you should be fine. I've had the wallet for a couple weeks and can't smell it unless I pretty much press my nose against it, but when it came out of the bag I could immediately smell it. Not a huge deal.<br /><br />In the snapped area, there is a spot for your license or ID, with 5 other slots. However, these slots do not have bottoms so whatever you put in may or may not slide all the way down. The final slot has a ribbon like thing in it, the use of which I am not sure. On the same side, there are also two pockets length-wise. On the other side, there is another ""pocket"", along with six slots for cards. The zipped compartment has four ""pockets"". There is a splitter in the middle for the two more roomy pockets, with two snug pockets on each side."
4.0,too small for me.  i gave it to my niece
4.0,can't wait to wear it in the summer time
4.0,"Ordered a 3T pair for my 2.5 year old son,  who wears 3T in pretty much everything. They are very warm and comfortable, but are huge. My 4.5 year old daughter is wearing them. Ordered 2T pair and they are still way too large."
4.0,The wand was well made and arrived quickly. A bit pricey though.<br /><br />I am adding some useless words here to meet the review word count required.
4.0,Beautiful.  A little snug on my wrist but is well worth the price.
4.0,"quality seems to be good, they just run a little small."
4.0,The bag is very beautiful and very well done.Color is completely  the same with photo. But  I wanted a medium-sized bag and it is too big for me.<br />More looks like on  travel bag. But anyway I like it!
4.0,Is a gift. Good Value.
4.0,This sleep cap is very comfortable. Sati lining keeps my hair in place. I would recommend this product.
4.0,Super cute. Lots of compliments
4.0,"I was really hoping this dress would work for me.  However, I found that it ran very small.  I purchased a large, but I think this would be more like a large in the junior department.  I ended up giving it to my daughter who is 5ft 2in and weighs 115 lbs.  It looks really cute on her."
4.0,"Ugh I reallyy want to like these but they’re too large and I can feel them already sliding down. I wish the waistline had more compression! I am 5’10” & 150lbs, ordered a small. I’m going to try and order an xs but I have a feeling the fabric might stretch funny in my quads. They’re nice material though and no camel toe!"
4.0,"Got a small thinking it was going to be big on me, but to have the look like the picture. Love the quality!"
4.0,"This set is silky and sexy. The pants are awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because the top has a weird fit. It fits OK, until the chest area. The pit holes are HUGE so you might be more exposed than you would like from the side, if you know what I mean, ladies. Other than that, awesomely cute!!"
4.0,kept me warm
4.0,I was a bit weary about ordering this because i wasn't sure how it would fit or how it work after making wudhu.  They surprisingly work very well and I am glad I ordered them.
4.0,"As another review stated, this item is not for a petite person. I had to adjust waist band as tight as possible and it still fell to the nether world ! Luckily I have a trusty sewing machine so could make necessary adjustments. Otherwise is great travel fanny pack!<br />Bea"
4.0,Soft material very comfy. Very see through have to wear something underneath.
4.0,Fits as expected and kept me cool.
4.0,A little heavier than expected but great quality. Zips up the front & is very roomy.
4.0,Well my girlfriend loved the rings. The only thing that I didn't notice when I ordered them was that the earrings were Sterling silver and she really can't we're it but overall she loved it and that's what matters. Thanks so much
4.0,"Nice cheap price, and lovely feathers, BUT the picture clearly shows gold earring hooks, and they came with silver."
4.0,"Got this as a gift, so have to see how my friend likes it. It came as ordered and looks awesome :)"
4.0,"Very comfortable, more comfortable than my $1,500 prescription sunglasses. Not “goofy” looking. Not really for sun protection but more for night driving. They’re moderately helpful. The sunglass version does a better job of their intended purpose."
4.0,I’m 5’0. I bought this dress (size: small) to wear with high top pink converse but it’s too big for the look I was going for. It will just be a sleeping dress now.
4.0,"I think these are great and I own many of them for various uses.  My only complaint is the way they list the URL on smaller labels.  It is broken up into two parts, one above the other.  Most people simply wont figure that out and frankly, there is no need to do this.  I have contacted the company and they do acknowledge the problem and say they will be working on a fix.<br /><br />I have yet to loose something with one of these tags so I don't know how well it will work.  Of course, they are only as good as the honesty of the people who find your item.  But if you do get Lucy enough to have an honest person locate your items, at least they have a way to find you."
4.0,Great for me - I prefer these instead of a hat!
4.0,"loved the top, the bottom was a little tight for my liking"
4.0,"I really like these but I wish they were a size smaller. The first wear was perfect but after I washed them, they seem to have stretched out a bit which makes them not stay on as well. Make sure you get a good size"
4.0,"The color is not like the picture, but I still like the purse. Lots of room!"
4.0,"Adorble, we bought matching outfits for 2 little sister. Only problem, the print cheaply done on shirt. I would order from this seller again."
4.0,"Nice sweater; nice fabric ... but ... I got the extra large (wear a medium) and it's a little tight, especially the sleeves."
4.0,"So thin you will want wear something under or over it. Might as well be naked, however, they feel so good you feel like you are naked. lol"
4.0,"It's cute, but it compressed my chest in a size medium. It was an iffy size choice for me, and I have noticed that sizing can vary widely between brands so I thought I might be safe with a size medium since I have other Due East sports bras and the size small came so close. For reference I am 5'3"", 116 lbs and have a 36DD bust size. It's challenging to find a good quality sports bra that fits all of me. The wideband fit well and I was able to get it on over my head. I usually treat sports bras like shapewear and step into it and pull it up for the easiest access. The pads were overkill on me and I removed them immediately. If you have a smaller bust, the padding is very thick and will increase the appearance of your bustline by a cup size. They remind me of push up bra pads.  I've been delighted with just about all my Due East apparel and have several pieces from their line. The quality is superb and the styles are cutting edge, but his one just wasn't a good fit."
4.0,"Please know that you will prob love these boots AND you’ll receive lots of compliments on them. . . But, the first pair I bought about 3 years ago—and they were lined. These are not, so they’re not as sturdy, nor as warm. Nevertheless they look good."
4.0,"Nice looking bag, a little on the heavier side. Internal compartments and size well suited for a small mirrorless camera"
4.0,"I’m glad I bought them, it’s warm my feet and soft too. Highly recommended"
4.0,"different material, wife did not have one like it yet. looks good, she likes it."
4.0,"These are definitely for bigger (fatter) feet. The length and width are fine but the strap is pretty loose. They'll last the summer, at least!"
4.0,"Good quality shoe. No support in the back heel though.  Thats the style though.  I like she shoe, but next time i will look for more support in the back."
4.0,Its more beautiful in person. I do recommend it.
4.0,"I bought this larger than what I thought would fit my daughter and it fits perfectly!  In otherwords, She's usually M or L and I bought XL to be sure.  Looks great and can't beat the price!"
4.0,So I really really like this uniform. I the problem isn’t with the product it’s self it’s that I have a big butt. The quality is really good and feels like a real cheer uniform but if you have a big but it might be too short in the back. I ended up returning it because I couldn’t wear it to work because it was so short. Besides that it’s perfect.
4.0,Gets the job done but really cheap material.
4.0,"Shirt is very nice, good quality and a lovely print. I normally wear a med/lg in tops. I ordered the medium and it is a bit big. Will be adorable with leggings still."
4.0,"The glove is more comfortable than the other model Grip Boost has. The tackyness in the fingers wears off, as expected but sooner perhaps than I thought. Still solid glove for the price."
4.0,"They were a little snug at first, but seem to adjust to my feet with use. I wear them for Zumba class, and for any errands I do after. Otherwise I wear them strictly for the class."
4.0,This was super cool. My husband loved it. But he could barely get it on. He is 6'2 and 245 pounds and it was a struggle. Lights are really cool and worked. But back it goes. Wish they had an XXL.  :(
4.0,Nice add on accessory to this kind of jewelry.
4.0,"I'd have chosen a different fabric, but they are as described and my daughter loves them. Cushy bottoms and true fit."
4.0,Cute toy
4.0,This is super cute. It looks and fits me exactly like the picture. I’m short though. So the length hits that awkward area 3/4 of the way down my calves. I’m going to get it hemmed with no problem because the slit in the back is still high enough that I can take 3-4 inches off and it’s still there. I can’t wait til I can get out of the house to wear it!!
4.0,I like the way they look. Can’t wait to show them to my husband. Easy to put on. Arrived early than expected. Thank you! They do come off real easily. Gotta anchor them tight!! Lol
4.0,"It’s super comfortable, wish it did better tucking belly"
4.0,"Nice design and fits well. Some of the material is stringing off on the straps. Not a bad fix, but that's why I cannot give a full 5 stars."
4.0,I love the design and how it looks however it’s impossible to sleep on whatever side the barbell is in which causes discomfort.
4.0,"Love wearing this swimsuit cover, just wish there was more variety in colors for this exact style"
4.0,I like it - the color is great . The fit is okay but the overall look is just what I expected.
4.0,Good for the money. Cheap.
4.0,Came in a dark purple not the lighter purple/ blue I expected but I still like it
4.0,Love it. However instructions are weak. Should be simpler  As it it is a very easy process Had to go<br />on line which shouldn’t  have to do if written instructions were easier Only complaint
4.0,"So soft and comfortable, a little large at the top but most people may like that.  Good deal."
4.0,"The bottoms of this suit fit as expected and are super comfy. For 11$, I'm super impressed! The top is really tiny, but I plan on finding a top elsewhere to match with the bottoms. I'm 5'1 140lb and the Large fits well (bottoms only). The top looked like a size small!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d76413ba52fdb594b9267b100bb6edf6]] Please reference my video review which should be attached to this written one for more specifics on how this item works and a visual representation of me looking the item over and reviewing it.  I also have a comparison to another similar style wallet from the same company but different wallet version within the video.<br /><br />Several Positive Features:<br />1) Great packaging materials with product and contact information if any issues (owner gives you his contact email in case of any problem)<br />2) The color options and styles of wallets to choose from is nice from this company (good variety)<br />3) Magnetic cash holder works great (I have put in 5-8 bills no problem with folder over once on the cash)<br />4) The pocket holder can hold credit cards and anything slightly larger (some minimalist wallets can only fit exact size credit cards)<br />5) Pocket expands outward so it is flexible to an extend on how much you want within the wallet<br />6) My preference is for the other style with exterior pockets, money clip, and an interior pouch but this one is likely more minimalist and slick<br /><br />Other Narrative/Discussion:<br />This is my second wallet from this company.  The first one was the leather brown version with 3 exterior pockets on one side, 2 on the other side with money clip, and an internet side pocket that expands like this one you can put items within as well.  I definitely prefer that one to this for the primary reason you can put your most accessed cards on the outside for easy removal and use.  This wallet is great as well however as it is even more minimalist and likely provides better RFID protection although both types make that claim.  In this one the cards are more fully covered but a little bit.  On both the magnet cash clip works great.  I have had no issues with using in my pockets and I am someone used to a large wallet.  Both wallets can likely hold 7-10 cards and cash if needed.  I have minimum 8-10 worth of cards being held in my leather one.  That expands it out but only slightly with no issue when i carry mine.<br /><br />The main negative as I say in the video is with unpacking of the product it smells with a strange scent for some reason likely due to being boxed up but that goes away with use.  I have been using my leather one for about a year now and the scent is not there anymore.  I believe with a little use it goes away.<br /><br />I would recommend the product without reservation."
4.0,"I really enjoy these compression socks with the single exception that the little white dots you see on the outside are actually large-ish knots of thread on the inside of the socks. Consequently? When you take the socks off you are left with significant indentations on your legs and feet where the knots are located in the socks. There is no medical problem with this that I know of but it does look ridiculous when you see your polka dotted legs and feet when the socks are off. Otherwise, the socks have the perfect amount of compression and are long enough that they come up to the knee without having to pull and tug them like a mad person. The heel and toe areas are separately stitched which makes for a better fit. The material is very strong and sturdy but not uncomfortable. I would buy these again but in a different pattern so there would be no knots inside. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for compression socks to try these."
4.0,"Only complaint is that the sleeves are a bit too tight. Otherwise, fits very true to size."
4.0,"It was a great style but it just fit a little too snug. It ""fit"" but I prefer my shirts a little more loose fit."
4.0,It looks nice and fits nice.
4.0,"I definitely wasn't expecting this to be as large as it is,  beautiful but heavy and large . You will Definitely need a strong chain to hold its weight."
4.0,"Fell in love with this dress as soon as I saw it. It's super pretty and fun. It has two straps you can tie in the back to accentuate your waist. It is pretty short on me if I bend over, in the back, and I'm short myself 5' so I'm not sure how it'll look on taller people. The pockets are big and useful. Doesn't hug on the belly which I love. I paired with nude booties trying them on but black would be good as well! Definitely recommend."
4.0,"I like the pockets-they are the right size and for the first time in a long time, I can find my keys etc. without dumping everything out of the purse. I carry this purse everyday to the office and am pleased with this purchase. My only complaint is that the shoulder strap is a little thin. I am not concerned that it will break, but up close it looks a bit less expensive than the rest of the bag."
4.0,I'd been searching for an ankle length skirt for ages and everything was too short. I finally landed on this. It's long and flowy and comfortable! The only thing I don't like is that you have to buy a 3 pack. I wish they sold them individually or sold a 3 pack of all black skirts.
4.0,"The hat is straw & VERY floppy. I have to figure how to make the brim a little flatter. The shades are very cheap & the label on the lens is in Chinese, so I have no idea what it says. The lenses are flat with no curvature so they distort images. Well, you get what you pay for!"
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but super cute!"
4.0,Shirt looks great. It's just as described and pictured. Very cool. She loves it.
4.0,I like these bras for daily wear but not necessarily for any type of heavy exercise. The padding is nice to prevent anything from showing but the material holds in sweat (hence no physical activity). I found them a tad on the large/ loose size around the band.
4.0,"Nice material, soft, cool design. Please make them with and without zippers though."
4.0,"I am pleased with the quality of the fabric and overall construction. It fits well and feels comfortable. I would recommend this, cheers!"
4.0,"very nice, material wrinkles easily but once you hang dry it and low heat press its fine"
4.0,"These are super cute, but also super narrow.. have to choose my socks wisely.  Also no venting, nothing like hot summer feet.."
4.0,I like all this dress fit on me
4.0,It’s a little tide as a large. But I love it.
4.0,The pajamas fit perfectly and are sized correctly.
4.0,As expected. Pocket has a rip after week of wearing. Thin.
4.0,Very cute outfit. I had to return and order next size up.
4.0,Love this belt so far haven't had any problems. Order  another one in brown.
4.0,"I was excited to purchase this dress but was a bit disappointed when I got it. So here are my pros and cons of this dress:<br />Pros:<br />- Cotton-like material which is perfect for the summer months<br />- Pockets<br /><br />Cons:<br />- A tad bit on the thin side as you have to wear the right underwear or onlookers can see through it<br />- Didn't fit like it does on the model. It did not have the flair at the end that I wanted, It was more of a roomy straight dress.<br />- Length - I'm 5'5&#34; and based on the reviews It wouldn't be sweeping the floor but it is (not in an unbearable way, just needs a tad trimming<br /><br />Overall, It fits and can be worn as a summer dress but didn't live up to my expectations based on description and reviews."
4.0,It's a pretty top. I was thinking it would be a little longer and bigger. I should have ordered a size up from what I usually wear.
4.0,"Had a function to attend and was going to wear a black dress with lace alongside the upper chest/shoulder/back body area and 3/4-sleeve length.  Neither a white bra or tan/brown (trying to match skin color) were going to work as you could easily see the bra straps through the lace which quite ruined the effect of the lovely lace design.  Could not find these in stores and, or course, discovered them on this site.  These worked wonderfully with one interesting note: if you get in the right light they seem to 'shine' in a shimmering way and in a strange way it added to the lace design which was both a surprise and delight to see.  *Watch what size you order, it does make all the difference and make sure your existing bra has outlets for the clips on both areas.  For the 18mm width the bra strap fully open measured 16"" from clip-to-clip.  For us fuller figure gals this just made it for me.  Soft and comfortable. Would recommend."
4.0,Perfect size hat for my daughter (3 years old).
4.0,"I love these earrings! I bought a pair for myself and also one for my girlfriend. They're beautiful, and can be worn with any outfit. They are aon the heavy side, so remember to take them off before bedtime."
4.0,"Love love love this bracelet. However, it's a snug fit.  It leaves marks.  I've been wrapping it around something larger than my wrist to stretch it out a bit."
4.0,Great fabric and design but runs small; my husband is 16/16.5 and we ordered L and it seems like a 15 .... so orders size up so it gives a little room.
4.0,"A little thin and big, but otherwise as expected."
4.0,"Lovely necklaces.  There was an issue with delivery and it took some time to resolve, but in the end the seller came through."
4.0,"The quality looked great, but it was way too large even though I ordered the size I always wear. I wish I had time to try a smaller size, but I needed this for a trip."
4.0,"I have only had the watch about a week. I really enjoy the way it looks, and it keeps time well when it's wound. I didn't notice until I got it that the hands glow in the dark, which is a nice touch. The weight for the automatic winder is not the best, so it does require some manual winding every other day or so, but I didn't expect much for this price.<br /><br />The band isn't too bad, links were a bit of a pain to put back, but I imagine this is normal with these types of bands. My only complaint is that I (apparently) have very small wrists, and only four links are removable... so it's a bit too big. That said, it looks to be removable, so I can probably replace it later.<br /><br />For the price though, I really have no complaints. It looks cool, and keeps time so far. We'll see how long it lasts."
4.0,"I really like these leggings and they are good quality for the price. My only two negatives are that they stretch when you wear them so the color is not as vibrant as it is in the photo; also the material is fairly slick, so it is difficult to do certain yoga poses in them (e.g. tree pose). Other than that, I'd definitely recommend them"
4.0,"Love this suit! I'm small with no shape but wanted a suit that allowed me to be modest but feel pretty at the same time. This does that! Only reason i have it 4 Stuart's is because the startups sit awkward. I'm having a seamstress remove them and place them closer to the armpit. Has good support and chest shape. May not be the best for someone with a very large chest though. I'm 5' 5.5&#34; and 110lbs. She fabric is quality. I would buy this suit again, even with the strap issue."
4.0,I have to make an hole in order for it to fit my daughter
4.0,"The shirt is great but the size chart is wrong.  Medium on the size chart is 10-12 so I ordered a M.  But the actual shirt is a M, size 8.  So I had to return the M and order a size L."
4.0,"Usually a small, but could've gone down to an extra small due to extra fabric around the waist and crotch.  Nice material.  Squat proof.  5'4&#34; for reference."
4.0,Doesn't like less than 5-10 bills
4.0,Jewel fell out easily... Disappointed. However they were really beautiful upon appearance.
4.0,"Lovely and fun! It is a bit roomy, though I got the xsmall, but it will fit a sweater under it when it's colder and that's nice!<br />I will be spraying it with a lot of Scotch Guard to give it a bit of water resistance."
4.0,"Loved this jersey, the stitched on patches as a commemoration for KOBE was beautiful, but it’s not stretchy like the Mamba jersey, so order a size up"
4.0,"This seller produces nothing but quality products.  However I wish that the sleeves were a bit longer,  as I've realized that the shirt gets wider as it increases in size.  Hoping to buy my 3rd shirt from them."
4.0,Fit is close..just a little on the smaller side. Quality is better than expected!
4.0,material is good
4.0,Good fit to my hands.. Need to try if it is warm enough during the winters.
4.0,Nice dress! Very satisfied.
4.0,i loved the dress it feels very soft and the fabric is of high quality . Works great for work and  the weekend.
4.0,"So I had an interesting experience with this piece. It is SUPER cute and well structured.  However, I ordered a medium and they sent me a large. I'm 5'5&#34;, about 145lbs, and have a relatively short torso (I sew, my measurements are about 3/4 an inch less than typical in torso length), had I actually gotten this in a medium there is absolutely NO chance it would have fit! That being said, I marked it as too small. If you have a long torso, I would not all at suggest this to you!"
4.0,Was expecting an athletic fit since most size small slim fits are tight on me and shows my muscularity. Will work never the less.
4.0,Nice hat doesn't look or feel cheap.
4.0,for the workimg person
4.0,"These are very nice sunglasses. They arrived quickly and came packaged in a drawstring cloth bag . They fit very well, my head is narrow but they stay on very well and don't slip down my face at all. These sunglasses look like they are much more expensive than they really are. They also feel sturdy and durable. The color of the lenses is also nice, I ordered the black pair and the color of the lenses changes between purple and gray depending on the light and angle. I would definitely recommend this product"
4.0,This wallet is super cute. Was a little bigger than I expected. Shipment was right on time !
4.0,[[VIDEOID:d6f98c1e476b5d91c302c29cb6585968]] Great deal for the price not cheap feeling
4.0,Looks great but haven't worn it yet as it is too big and nothing to make adjustment or instructions...
4.0,I LOVE my rain wraps- Perfect for travel. Folds up tiny and fits over whatever you're wearing. High price is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars
4.0,"This skirt is absolutely gorgeous and nice quality, however it was much longer than expected. I’m 5’9” and it was down to my ankles, I was expecting it to fit more like the picture. I normally wear a medium and I got a small."
4.0,it was not what I expected. I thought it opened wider than it does.
4.0,"For the price, these were great! I have 2 holes in my lobes and a tragus piercing- I've used all the sizes and love the fact that they don't turn my ears green or cause a lot of &#34;gunk&#34;, even after wearing for a week straight."
4.0,I like the Rich color and material
4.0,I really like the picture. Did not realize how large I would look in this dress and it is kind of thin see through material.  Good quality though. Someday I will gain enough courage to wear it.
4.0,This is very good and planning to buy the Gold one too.<br />But the locking should be made more secured because sometime it open up by itself.<br />Apart from this the product is very good.
4.0,"If you are short, this may not be for you. I would usually just hem the bottom but because of the pattern it would have looked SO weird for me to trim off the bottom. I would've loved it...if I were taller.  Not for short girls!"
4.0,"I ordered a large and it fit as expected. I am 160 pounds and 5'8.5"" tall. The length of the skirt went about to my knee. the pattern is very pretty and the dress actually looks like a two piece outfit composed of a shirt and dress. The top of the dress is a thicker material than the skirt bottom. It is not see through though. The dress is very professional looking and would work great for work attire."
4.0,"This looks like a nice necklace and earring set; however the necklace arrived broken. The string was broken/cut at the very middle of the necklace. Two of the pieces had come off. I tried tying the loose ends together, which worked temporarily, but then it broke in another part of the necklace string. Apparently, the string is very poor quality.<br /><br />Update: I requested a replacement for the damaged necklace. It arrived promptly, but the replacement necklace was also broken. I requested a refund from the seller and was assured my money would be refunded, along with an assurance that the producer of the necklace would be notified of the poor quality. I'm changing my rating to 4, only because of the seller's prompt and courteous customer service. That was very much appreciated."
4.0,"Nice simple dress, little to no ironing needed"
4.0,Great for either day or evening wear
4.0,"I like it, nice fit."
4.0,Very nice band. Hard to put on but at least they provide the tools.
4.0,"Much wider than expected, but theyre great for working in weeds and pokey plants. They are rather thick and heavy, I'm sure hot in the summer. Having said that i can tear out weeds quickly and not worry about injuring my arms. I put a hair tie around to keep them up cuz they are so wide, but i am happy with my purchase because they fill a need and will help weed quicker."
4.0,LOVE THE RINGS EXCEPT THE ONE THAT HAS WRITTEN IN SCRIPT WISH THAT COULD FIT IN A SMALLER FINGER BUT OH WELL THAT'S WHY I HAVE MY THUMB THANKS THEY LOOK CUTE.
4.0,"These are cute and dainty. They fit perfectly for my cartilage and rook piercings. There was one that was a little difficult to open, but I gave it a good pull and bent it a little to better fit in the opening. This was a bit annoying, but it wouldn't sway me from purchasing again. I've taken several showers without taking them out, and they have not tarnished or lost their pretty rose gold color."
4.0,"These are very soft and comfy. Good for summer PJs as they are VERY thin. I had to wear a base layer under them to stay warm. 4 out of 5 because for some reason I felt like the bottoms just fit a little odd around thigh and buttocks. I’m fairly thin and in-shape and the fit still felt off for me. Otherwise, nice jammies :)"
4.0,This insert is a little bigger then the one that came with my wallet so its better then that one.nice that there are two so i have a extra.
4.0,"Cheap quality band feels like it might break off with a little tug. But for what it’s worth, you can’t beat the looks of it."
4.0,My granddaughter loves these socks. Appeared to be sturdy and they fit well.
4.0,"Its ok, doesnt exactly fit like Oakley's &#34;Asian fit&#34; type but its usable."
4.0,They look so pretty.
4.0,"This would have been five stars but for the fact that the shoe is just tooooooo snug. I am a size 12 and usually they fit well and sometimes even have room. Even allowing for the shearling to tamp down a bit with wear, these slippers hurt. I’m keeping them because I needed a warm slipper."
4.0,"It's very comfortable dress, and very simple for any type of occasion."
4.0,Very pretty but I would suggest packaging them a little different so they don't break. Very happy with the rest
4.0,"Too small in calf, could not zip up. Gave to a friend who is very skinny. (I wear a juniors size 11-13 for reference ). The boots are cute , my friend says she gets a lot of compliments on them."
4.0,This shirt is meant to be flowy. I ordered a 16 because I figured it would be cut small. I usually wear a 14 and this shirt is definitely loose but not too big. My only complaint is that the sleeves are not as long as I hoped. I like my long sleeve shirts to cove over my hands a little (like in the picture of this item) but they barely come to my wrists.
4.0,"I ordered a XL size after reading all reviews, but it was a little bit bigger than expected. I had to take it for a fix in the chest (very deep V) and I liked it better.<br />The material is fresh and light and the color is absolute tu beautiful. The termination detail are not the best, some threads are unfinished in some places but nothing terrible.<br />It’s very flattering for hourglass shape."
4.0,"Fit great, but was a little long (i'm 5'4) ordered an XL because I have larger hips. The sequins come off very easily, but for the price it's worth it. Wore this in New Years and it was a huge hit! :)"
4.0,Brought two good quality
4.0,Great jacket it's very thin tho but good to have if it's just windy I'm not sure about rain wise but keeps me cool during the day and it's very light weight so all In all it's a great buy for me no complaints from me.
4.0,"Black scarf has thicker lining sewn inside the very thin skull print fabric.  Edges are raw, which looks cool,  but will probably fray over time. When i opened the scarf it was sealed inside two plastic bags. It smelled like mildew so badly that i had to handwash with soap twice in order to get rid of the odor.  Not sure what that was about but after washing and throwing in the dryer the smell is gone. Not bad quality for the price."
4.0,I like this bracelet a lot but I recently noticed that one of the zirconia fell off.  I still wear it but it bothers me that it is missing a piece.  But it is really pretty.  If the stone hadn't fallen out I would rate it a five.
4.0,The cowhide is soft and more flexible than many of the betts I see in department and big box stores. I hate stiff belts. It was also reasonably priced. The stitching around the leather belt  loop could have been more secure. That part seems a little cheesy and is why I didn't give it five stars..
4.0,"I like the coverage of the top, even if it's a little tight to pull on.  I don't wear the bottoms, because they're a little skimpy."
4.0,"Well made, just actually a tad too bit for me. It would cost more to return it than what I paid, hence the loss of a star. I'll probably order a size down and sell the big one"
4.0,Considero que la calidad del producto es muy buen para el precio pagado.
4.0,"I sized up on this product and it was too big. I would honestly need to size down a size or two to fit. The leg area is very lose fitting, though it does have a built in panty line. Just wasn’t wanting a lose fitting swim short. The material was nice and had pockets. Would re order in a size smaller."
4.0,"I don't actually mind these rings, they seem like decent quality and made well BUT I bought them to be used as a nose ring and WOW they are so thick they will definitely not go through my nose piercing. They work well in my ear, but if you are looking at putting it through your nostril, I would look for something thinner."
4.0,"My feet say Ahhhh, when I put these shoes on 😊"
4.0,If you have bigger hips and butt than most guys order a size up.
4.0,Great price and great style.
4.0,"Very soft, comfy pajamas! The bottoms are long, but overall the set fits well. I would buy them again!"
4.0,"These are lovely, well-made ties, if these are the colors you want. I like them. These ties are a little less soft and flexible than the nicest ties my husband has, so, without the price, it is hard to rate them. But in comparison with other ties, I would give them 4 stars. I like them. They are well made, but I prefer to get my husband ties that are a little softer as they tie and hang a little better."
4.0,These sunglasses are great!<br />They are lightweight but the lenses are dark which I love (not all sunglasses are dark enough for me). My only complaint is that they did not come with the cleaning cloth as described.
4.0,I really love these I just wish they came in different prints and colors. I do like the color stitching. I think they are a little to snug. So size up. I do have wide palms so it's possible it's just my wide hands.
4.0,"These are really cute, a little bigger than I realized but still nice. Not too heavy, I do like them a lot. I got several compliments!"
4.0,The top falls off but the back serves its purpose
4.0,"I like this watch band a lot. It's very unique! The only complain I have - it should have one more whole to make this band smaller. As of now, the smallest I can get is still a bit too loose. I still wear it because it's pretty but the HR readings are inaccurate."
4.0,REALLY NICE JEANS BUT THE CHEMICAL SMELL IS HORRIBLE-WASHED THEM 2 TIMES AND THE SMELL IS STILL THERE.
4.0,It's what you'd expect
4.0,Works very well. I do wish there was some type of labeling because I cannot tell what size by looking at them. Also they were all loose in a plastic bag.
4.0,"Love these pants, although just a little to long for me even in capris."
4.0,They are cute. Hubby was suprised.
4.0,My daughter's feet are a bit wide and straps don't seem to fit quite right.
4.0,It would be a 10/10 but it's hard to open the necklace to put it on other wise its a good necklace.
4.0,It’s a cute and quality made Christmas shirt. My daughter and I really enjoyed them
4.0,Kind of small place
4.0,"They're bags, they're fine."
4.0,"The clasp broke, but it was easy to fix,  it looks very good for the price."
4.0,"Since I had always wanted a ""mad scientist"" lab when I was a girl and never got one, my husband purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and I to do together.  Overall, it's been fun.  Everything but water has been included which is a plus.  The ""lab"" comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways.  I like this component because it helps children with problem solving, creativity and motor skills.  The kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker.  It's really taught my son to learn how to measure.  However, the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards, which my son would not be able to figure out without my help.  The steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch.  On the other hand, the ""experiments"" or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments.  They also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors, flavors.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the ""experiments"" actually tasted for a toy kit.  On the other hand, if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the ""recipie"" cards.  Overall, this was a great gift because it got my son and I to spend some fun time together!"
4.0,They are a bit think for my liking but they don't ride down like others. Good socks for the value
4.0,"Loved this dress! Wore it to a wedding.  I am 5'2  about 145 ish and 38dd and I wasn't sure what size would fit me.  Got the medium and fit awesome!<br /><br />Will say tho it kind of wrinkles easy.  Sat down in the car and I had some wrinkles.<br />It's the good stretchy material<br />Didn't wear a bra with it just put some bra liner things from my motherhood bra,  was fine for me."
4.0,So far so good. My daughter loves them.
4.0,Just enough hat!
4.0,Absolutely love the way this dress fits.  I am 5'1&#34; and 190lbs and ordered a XL.  The length is perfect and just looks wonderful on me.  The only thing I'm not fond of is how see thru the white part is.
4.0,I would prefer a higher back so that the slippers do not tend to fall off.<br />The pain relief is very moderate as the pain has moved from my heel to the bottom of my foot.  They are comfortable though.
4.0,"I didn’t buy these for style, I bought these for device use and watching TV. They work as well as others I have purchased. I bought these because they are for smaller faces, they work well in that respect."
4.0,This top is made of great flowy fabric and the draping is beautiful. I think it runs a little large.
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): These earrings are different from anything I own. They are very fun and interesting.  The color is a deep, beautiful blueish green.  The little faux diamonds are a nice contrast.  The design is overall lovely.  The earrings are lightweight and comfortable."
4.0,This fits my 13 pound 4 month old well with room to grow which I like. The material is soft and warm. The patterns and colors I received are exactly what I saw in the picture(pictures could vary) so I got what I expected to. I like the convenience of leg warmers because it makes diaper changing (especially on the go) faster and easier. We get many compliments on these. I would imagine that they will come in handy when my little guy starts to crawl as well.
4.0,Grandma loved it
4.0,These are comfortable. If the padding was a tad more cushiony they would be spot on. For spin class they are perfect. A great deal. Beautiful color! I ordered the purple and they are vibrant! Fast shipping.  They also sent me a little bike key chain. Which is a sweet little bonus.
4.0,"For plus size women, it comes over shoulders and had room in bust area. Also shirt comes over waist.  Really  impressed."
4.0,"These are nicer than I'd dared to hope. The white part is thin like Playtex gloves. But the blue is thicker, reinforced material. It feels good on the hands. They fit well, sizing is right on. I just don't know if they'll stand the test of time given the thinness of the white material.<br />As for the white and keeping it clean...I washed up after baking. There was quite a bit of black smears and other gunk on these gloves. I just washed like I was washing my hands, gloves on, using soap and water. They came out snow white again, nothing left."
4.0,"They are good for long runs; they reduce the incidence of blisters.  Also, they last for a long time.  I have a few pairs that are more than 4 years."
4.0,These look smaller than I expected. But I have to say it was deceiving because when I put them on they weren't snug. I would have preferred a little looser but the fit wasn't bad.  The material was surprisingly nice and comfortable. I didn't give 5 stars because they weren't a true extra large. I would  still recommend them
4.0,They are exactly what I was looking for!!
4.0,"I can usually wear between small and medium tops, and this small was definitely a small. It also runs shorter than the photo makes it seem. I plan on wearing it with overalls though, and am currently wearing it under a T-shirt. I don’t like how high the bottom hem comes up on the side seams. If I bought it again I’d get a medium.<br />It’s not as transparent as I expected (so hard to know with white shirts, especially online). Still going to show a colored/patterned bra, fyi."
4.0,Kids loved them.  Some did not work.
4.0,"This worked very good with my catrina Dia de los Muertos outfit, only thing is they don’t have a lot of stretch and at first feels a little tight on the fingers but then you get used to them."
4.0,Kid loves them! Fit as expected
4.0,"The padding to the dress was a bit thick.  We did have to take in the sides, but the waist was perfect.<br />Nice dress for the price.<br />The sparkles were not glitter so that was a plus."
4.0,nice look for nice cozy weather
4.0,I love the top! Fits great and is super cute! The skirt is a little longer than expected but still very cute.
4.0,Nice to wear at work and after work. rated 4 because one of the button was already lose.
4.0,"This katana is perfect for cosplay and even just to mess around with! But the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because you HAVE to be careful putting it back in the scabbard, sins the scabbard is wooden it can get caught on the blade and the paint will chip. But other than that it is very nice, no wobbling of the blade, just a good katana for cosplay.😊"
4.0,It fit my GA100-1A1 but with a whole lot of effort. Took the best part of an hour.
4.0,"I really like these earrings, I love the variety but I think the studs are a bit tiny. Nevertheless, I don't regret my order."
4.0,The dress is significantly longer than it is on the model. This would be a perfect work dress - I was just going for more of a party dress.
4.0,Very nice material. High waisted which is how I like them
4.0,Lighter weight but nice. Glad I bought.
4.0,"I have a thing for skulls and skeletons and have some nice jewelry in that theme so figured this little skeleton bear would be a fun addition.  I thought it would be a smaller bear, but that's okay - it's still cute and it is now attached to my keychain."
4.0,"Simple, lovely ring to wear everyday so that I don't get gunk in or scratches on my good ring. Exactly what I wanted."
4.0,Comfortable and seem to be holding up fairly well. I Like the boa tightening system but noticed the cable is not run thru the first eyeloop on one side of one of my shoes. Doesn't seem to bother it much though and it came from the factory that way since the eyeloop is not broken and there is no way to put it back in. Every once in awhile I will hit the Boa button on something and it loosen my shoe.
4.0,This dress fit perfectly and is very cute.
4.0,"Love this style of top but it is more form fitting. The pockets are right at hip level, so they can make you look slightly wider."
4.0,"Very nice dress, fabric was just the right weight."
4.0,"I got this for my ten-year-old and it's adorable. It fits true to size for a snug fitting sweater. Ours only has one bunny, not two. Also the pockets are fake which is a bummer. But it is nice and soft to the touch and my daughter loves it! I'm planning to handwash it because it feels like it might not hold up super well in the washing machine."
4.0,Nice and long. Wish they were made with beads.
4.0,Front Puffs out a tiny bit but wife still likes them.
4.0,Works well keeps good time.
4.0,"This is extremely comfortable and the little rhinestone on the neckline is a cute touch. Living in Texas, it's perfect to keep me cool on hot days since the fabric is breathable, but it's not too thin so it's easy to see through."
4.0,"I love that I can fit this on my wrist like a bracelet when I'm walking away from or toward my car, or carrying items and need an extra hand.  Cute styles although my tassel fell off fairly quickly and easily.  No worries though, I may like it better without the hanging tassel!"
4.0,cute shoes for my little one. they fit true to size and lasted until he grew out of them. Would purchase again
4.0,"This was good dress overall. I wish I had ordered size bigger, but it does fit good and the fabric isn't too thin."
4.0,I put them on and they were super comfortable. I love the look and the high waist.
4.0,Decent for the price. Nice packaging. Nice case.
4.0,The material is just a bit lesser quality than what I had hoped for. Over all a very nice shirt.
4.0,"I would have liked a wider belt,<br />but it works fine."
4.0,I've bought similar hoops from several different companies and these are my favorite. They are easy to put in and close which is not the case for the other brands. They look beautiful. The only issue is a few of them arrived bent out of shape.
4.0,It is not a long sleeved shirt. It is a short sleeved shirt. Cute though. Got it for my nephew. Almost returned it because we thought it was long sleeved but my sister didn’t mind.
4.0,A little flimsy and takes some shaping because it holds the packing folds.
4.0,Good clip. Very solid and after a few weeks shows no sign of the clip failing. Gunmetal paint chipping after a few weeks but the metal underneath is a decent color too so I may just sand it off sometimes if I feel like it.
4.0,Love the feel of the material of this fabric. Wears well
4.0,Great everyday purse😊
4.0,VERY NICE BUT SMALL ISN'T MY SIZE. 5'1 132LB SHOUL'VE WENT WITH A MD.
4.0,Size 10 was smaller than expected.  Nice shoe though
4.0,"I like the padding on the bottom, but the elastic is not as snug as I would like."
4.0,Very cute. Fits nicely.
4.0,"I like these. I have to wear compression socks and they're either overpriced or the color choices are bland. These allow me to color coordinate my summer outfits, and great value."
4.0,Nice fabric good fit
4.0,"I bought this pants to help me when i am snowboarding (learning). I felt so many times and got really hurt so i thought this pants would help protect me but it's very bulky and tight .. i wear size 8 and it was pretty tight.<br />Since is the end of the season now , i will buy a large size next year. But I will also need to buy a new snowboard pants because the one i have it will be very tight wit this padded pant.<br />If you are looking for something to protect your body this should be a good choice.. not sure how comfortable it is when snowboarding though?"
4.0,I like this hat......... somewhat large for me.  But this is just my preference!!!
4.0,soft decent pair
4.0,"not that comfortable, but very cute, it attracts a lot of hair in general, but after all pretty cute"
4.0,I have smaller boobs and the chest part fits a little weird but I love the way the rest fits on my body.
4.0,"I was nervous when reading reviews. I saw a lot of pictures where the seem is in the front and it looked really off with the dots. Mine has the seem but happened to line up pretty good so it doesn't really stand out. I feel like if you have a really large chest it could be tight fitting but mine fit just right! I'm 5'7"" 185lbs and I went with the large. It is super cute!"
4.0,Really pretty. Not made for a women who is bigger in the waist though.
4.0,"Pretty. The band is a bit hard, but overall it's good!"
4.0,"Cute dress! I'm 5'5&#34;, 175 lbs, size 10 in pants and dresses, 36C, and size medium or large in shirts.  I ordered the large but will be exchanging for the medium as the large wasn't quite fitted enough for me. It looked like I was wearing a mumu nightgown, which is not what I was going for with this look. The length was just a bit long, so I'm hoping it will be perfect on the medium. Colors were great. I was a little unhappy with the stitching though. The sections seem to pucker a bit, but you can't notice too much since the dress is flowy."
4.0,"Wish they were UV 400,  GOOD  BUY!!"
4.0,Classy and stylish clutch. It went perfect with my after five dress.
4.0,"had one of these in the early 90's..the plain, regular one..got the gold one as an adult...just wish the backlight was stronger and the gold color wouldn't chip off so easily. but it's a watch i wear when running errands so i'm not too worried."
4.0,They are cute but I got sent the wrong color
4.0,"Another great dress, good quality, came a little late on deliver, not when I was expected.  Dress is beautiful, when I probed it suit tight, I have big hips, but I will keap it because is dark wearing with a spandex give a help.  Dress is beautiful"
4.0,Very nice sporty watch
4.0,"This dress has a great Summer feel to it but the material might not be for everyone. The fabric has sort of a shower curtain sheen and feel… which doesn’t bother me… but isn’t as breathable as cotton. It has no stretch. I’m 5’ 8” and it hits me about an inch above the knees. I work in an all female office, and being on COVID restrictions, no one else is allowed in so I can wear it to work. The V neck isn’t revealing. Colors are nice and the dress washed up nicely."
4.0,"This looked much better than I expected considering the price. It’s very cute, and looks just like the picture. However, the ring must contain some nickel. I have an itchy patch on my neck after wearing it for a few hours. If you don’t have a nickel allergy, I think it’s worth it though!"
4.0,"I'm so glad I sized up because I wanted it more loose and flowy, otherwise my normal size might have been too small. The large actually fit perfectly, even a little snug in the shoulders (and I don't have big shoulders) because when I raise my arms the dress lifts too.<br /><br />Mostly I'm disappointed that the ""Wine Red"" color looks maroon or burgundy in the seller photos and it's definitely a completely different color, much lighter and with orange tones. I'd call it more like a brick red color.<br /><br />I took pics in natural daylight so you can see what the color looks like. It's still a pretty color, just not what I was expecting and hoping for.<br /><br />The dress is not lined, but in this color it doesn't seem like it's see through. The v-neck doesn't have a snap to hold it closed, but the way it fit me I don't need it. If you're more flat chested or if the size is too big for you, you may want to wear a camisole underneath.<br /><br />The sash is just the same material, but it's flimsy and even if you wrap it unfolded so it covers the elastic, it will move around and fold by itself. I wish it had a lining inside so it stays nice and wide, but you can always wear a belt instead.<br /><br />I'll update this review with a try-on pic when I get it done, but in the meantime I hope you find my pics helpful (especially if you're considering this color). 😊"
4.0,"The bottoms of this suit fit perfectly but the top was a no for me. It’s not their fault, definitely mine because I have a really small back and obnoxiously large breast. Lol."
4.0,Everything that is being said bout these XL Vise specs is pretty much spot on accurate..Cept for the Comments that said that they don't get scratched..There is no such plastic type material on earth that is that resilient .. I'm in the iron workers world by trade and everyone that has these that I work with we all need replacement lenses.. Please make this as convenient as possible for us and get those replacement lenses on prime so we can just handle it all right here. Thank you!
4.0,"Color and design is beautiful. Small in the back does not fully cover bum. Jewels delicate, a few have fallen off."
4.0,"First of all, the material feels JUST like my lululemon zip up. If you're looking for a dupe for the iconic lulu zip jacket, this is it! Second, the sizing is a bit off. I wish that there had been a guide saying to size up. I love compression, but it's almost too tight around the arms, making it uncomfortable for all say wear. Lastly, it is suuuuper cute. It reaches down enough in the back, and I found it doesn't slide up! That is a win for me! If you're thinking about this, buy it! Just know it is like a second skin in your normal size. :)"
4.0,the pocket square are fantastic. wonderful colors
4.0,Bracelet is just like picture.  The cords were too bulky for my personal taste but the charm is perfect.  Happy with purchase
4.0,These are for our little flower girls and are so cute!
4.0,"Item is as described. I would say though that the adult size might be slightly tight for those with bigger head circumference than 21"""
4.0,They are comfy and stylish .. I am loving them.
4.0,"Sooo I took a chance and purchased these Heart Shaped Stones with no reviews hoping and praying the were legit! Appon arrival the package was soooo well wrapped with care to ensure they were delivered safely and they sure were, these stones are AMAZING! Once I Sage them they are going to be the newest addition to my lovely Crystal collection. I adore them sooo much! Take a chance and buy these gems! I DEFF recommend em!! 🤩<br />Can't wait to buy all these sets 💜"
4.0,"I normally wear a 30"" waist in Levis.  The 30"" waist on these was more like a 32"" so I got a 28"" and even they seem a tad larger than 30"" Levis.  Other than that, it's wonderful having jeans that fit my trim waist well but don't squeeze my thighs like saran wrap.  They're also quite comfy and look nice.  I recommend buying 2"" less than your normal waist size."
4.0,"I want more of a ""slouchy"" appearance... I will purchase another in the near future..<br />The quality of what I received is quite good and won't go to waste whatsoever😊👋"
4.0,"Only had this a few month and the coating the covers the key chain where the imprint is, is coming off. Would be better without the silver covering at all and just imprint on the metal."
4.0,"I was hesitant at first when i bought this gloves.  I used scissors and knife to cut it first and no damage was done.  I used this cut resistant glove to cut onions even tried cutting my hands while wearing them and it does not go through.  I gave it a 4 star because it's not a snug fit and it's loose on the fingertips.  I kept cutting the ends of the gloves when i was cutting the onions.  It had a slight smell to it, I washed it and the smell diminished.  Overall, good gloves, I want try using them when pulling weeds."
4.0,"The quality is great, although it's a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be. I haven't taken it out since I got it."
4.0,Happy with the size and shipped in a timely manor
4.0,"Overall not a waste of money they are being used. Just don't expect a comparison to name brand quality when you're purchasing this type of item for this price ;-) Worth the $30, can't beat the price. Not sure I think they are worthy of repurchasing... My son seems to be fine with them says they are light, which they most definitely are as you can pretty much see right through the &#34;mesh-like&#34; material. They are great to wear over compression pants etc. The sides are sort of an awkward look to me they lay very funny the way the stitching is, just my perspective. I definitely think they should be washed prior to wear they will shrink an inch or two easy. As you can see in my photos."
4.0,"Beautiful dress but it was SO LONG and I had to get it hemmed to the point where there was almost no white left. Also, there were small but noticeable runs in the fabric which my seamstress covered up by pinning the dress to fold over and hide them. Still, for a $70+ dress it should not have had runs at all. It's also impossible to get this dress on by yourself as it has a lace up back and the hips are a bit narrow, so you can't let it drop, you've gotta pull it over your head and struggle to find the exit while it makes your hair stand up from static."
4.0,"This is a nice-looking smartwatch, that doesn't look like a smartwatch.<br /><br />This one doesn't have the kind of sophisticated display that you'd get with something like an apple or an android watch. It functions more like a fitbit, where it is a supplement to the phone rather than something that could partially replace a phone. It tracks activity and sleep, and it also can be used to let you know who has sent you a message. You can also control some music apps, which is great for jogging or walking.<br /><br />While the battery only lasts 6 months with regular use, that is a lot better than some smartwatches where you literally have to charge them every night. I had one that I stopped using because I had to charge it overnight and even then the batteries would only last about 10-12 hours, so that it would stop working before I went to bed."
4.0,Good everyday belt.
4.0,I like the look and feel of the shirt. The body fit well but the sleeves were just to long for my husband's comfort. If the sleeves had worked he would have really been happy with the shirt. We had to return it.
4.0,I am very happy with these cute little pink heart shaped earrings. I bought them for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves them. I purchased these because I had already ordered me a cubic zircona/silver pair exactly like these and i love them.<br />I would definitely purchase from this company again.
4.0,Makes things brighter and clearer. Just would be nice to have a nose guard for stability. Would consider purchasing again.
4.0,Very good sound. Speaker is not able to be switched from it’s left side mount. Hat runs a bit small. Warm
4.0,They look huge when I pulled them out of the bag but they came in a bit shorter with more flair than on the model which is ok but not really the look I was going for.  Good fabric and they wash well.
4.0,Glamour and Easy
4.0,Good product Just wish they had Medium available
4.0,kind of gappy at top and tight in the bum. Still a very cute swimsuit.
4.0,Great material cute tank top but only thing is the arm holes could have been bigger.
4.0,"It works as it is supposed to, so I can recommend it."
4.0,"--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--<br /><br />This product is cute but it is smocked in the back. I found it uncomfortable to sit in - which I will be doing a lot at the event I ordered the dress for. It is kind of sheer on the front, too. Look at the pics to see what I mean. It's super cute! It's just not what I was expecting.<br /><br />This product runs true to size. I ordered a medium and it fits well. I am usually a small but when a product is tighter fitting, I opt for a medium because I am curvy. I am 5 foot 6 inches and 140 lbs.<br /><br />--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--"
4.0,"I really like this bra except for one thing: the seam in the cups comes straight up and puckers at the nipple. It definitely makes that part stand out. For the price, it's about the quality expected. If I'd paid more than $50, I would have probably returned it for that reason.<br /><br />44G fits perfectly, cups lay on breasts, gore lays flat. It fits projected pendulous breasts well without setting them up on a shelf like the Sculptress Chi Chi. The color is described as 'gray', but it's definitely more of a light beige ""nude""."
4.0,"This is a great deal for the price! I ordered the white floral one and it's gorgeous. I absolutely love all the colors in this kimono! I also love that the front of the hem is low, the sides are high, and the back is slightly lower than the front. I think it gives the garment a very floaty look.<br /><br />The fit was ok. That's really the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I got a small based on the sizing chart recommendation, but I'm not too thrilled with how it fits. Everything is fine except the back- it's uncomfortably tight whenever I stretch my arms out. An inch or 2 more of fabric in the back would really improve this kimono. I would recommend ordering a size up from what you may usually wear.<br /><br />Some reviews mentioned the fabric around the neck is scratchy, but I would disagree. While there is a thick (and rather stiff) hem around the front of the kimono, I did not find it to be uncomfortable at all, and I think it's just something that needs to be broken in.<br /><br />I would certainly purchase this again.... Just probably in a bigger size... Great buy!"
4.0,I am 5'4'' and still is a little short. I wanted to wear heals with it so I am going with something different. It is good quality though.
4.0,Goes great with strapless bra when wearing a strapless dress.
4.0,Love the jacket EXCEPT that the zipper is on the left side instead of the right.  I guess if you’re left handed it’s perfect for you.
4.0,"I purchased this dress because I like the style but it was a little shorter than I expected. However the color, material and fit was great. It arrived as expected and in good condition."
4.0,"My wife has a lot of hair so standard sized hats generally don't do the trick; this one did, much to her delight."
4.0,its bigger than I thought and a cheaper material than I'd imagine but it is beautiful and still means a lot for me
4.0,"The socks fit well and were about the quality I expected for the price. However, the description is a bit misleading. I didn't get five pairs in random colors. I got five pairs of one random color. At least they weren't all pink, but white with black wasn't even one of the pictured options. The seller did send them quickly and I received them almost a month before I expected to."
4.0,2 year old granddaughter loves to play dressup
4.0,Loved it and the opportunity to wear it for my birthday month of August!!!
4.0,Very cool mask! It bends easily which is good if you need to form it more to your face but does make it more fragile. I wasn't a fan of the rhinestones above the eyes so I popped them out and it looked even cooler! I wore this to see Phantom of the Opera.
4.0,"The pendant is pretty and my 12 year old son (who loves wolves) was ecstatic to receive this. The chain was useless. It broke while putting it around my son's neck. We tried to fix it and it broke in another spot. We finally switched out the chain and he wore it for awhile on that. So, so cheap but considering it was only a dollar and my sons delight with receiving it, I'd recommend it. However, if I'd known how cheap it was...I would have bought a few backups."
4.0,Very easy to replce and seems sturdier then original band.
4.0,"This jumpsuit is really nice. Good material. I ordered a small. I have a really small waist, but I have hips and butt. The bottom was fine, but the waist was really big,and when I put the belt on, it was so much gathered material. And I thought about taking it to the cleaners to have it taken in, but it would be too much to have it taken in. It would be more than the cost of the jumpsuit."
4.0,I purchased this item and it is a great product. No cons.
4.0,There nice but they easily slide side ways
4.0,"The drawstring is perfect for keeping the hat on under even the windiest of conditions.  The full brim gives full protection from the sun, including the back of the neck.  I like the flat collapsible hat for packing too, and if caught in a shower, the hat dries quickly!"
4.0,"Nice Anklet Chain. Beautiful craftsmen ship, and for a great price."
4.0,It came and looked just as expected. I love how you can adjust it to fit your head.
4.0,"I am a big fan of the Stones so of course I liked it, it does fit a little small."
4.0,Wish it was taller
4.0,I've never used a polishing cloth and couldn't imagine they would work very well.  But this one changed my mind.  It works and without a lot of rubbing.  I used it on small pieces of  silver and brass.  I gave it four stars only because I have nothing to compare it to. I've always used creams and liquids to clean silver and brass.
4.0,I ordered a size small but they were more baggy in the waist than I expected them to be. My waist is a 24/0. If they had an xs I would’ve gotten those but they were overall a good fit and cute
4.0,Super comfortable material. Feels soft on my skin.
4.0,"Very cute and decently constructed. I'm about a 1x/2x and ordered a size up because these things tend to run small, but I should have stuck with my regular size. If anything it seems to run a little large.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the straps and buckles on the skirt aren't functional at all. The only thing holding it up is a small bit of velcro. Trying it on for the first time, any kind of movement would make it slide right off my hips but with a little improvisation of cinching it tight and tying the straps into a bow worked quite well."
4.0,To remind my son to drive safe.
4.0,"I bought these glasses hoping they would help with my migraines.  It's a bit too soon to know for sure,  but I do like them."
4.0,"This lanyard/wallet is what I expected. I use it as an ID and FOB holder for work. I did have to change the lanyard part because it was too short and hung too far up on my chest. The zipper pouch is not completely closed off, so things can slip out of the pouch. Other than that, the wallet works well for what I use it for. I would recommend this to others."
4.0,I am pleased with the quality of these bags.  I embroider on them.  I wash cotton items before I do the embroidery.  They shrink 1 - 2 inches when washed but that is to be expected with cotton canvas. The only small issue I encountered was some serging on the edges that needed to be restitched.
4.0,"This Orchid Row Women's Fancy Multi-Colored Infinity Scarf and Beanie Set is well made, and pretty cute. The infinity scarf is convenient because it's just knit in a big circle, and can comfortably go around your neck twice, or even three times if you want a giant turtleneck-like look. The colors are off white and mixed black/blue, and the pom pom, made of faux fur is black. The fabric is 100% polyester and feels softly puffy. The only minor criticism I have, that may not apply to all, is that the rim of the hat can't be folded over due to it being fairly narrow, so this is a bit puffy w extra space at the top of my head."
4.0,"I wanted a classicly styled dive watch (although I admit I don't dive) and decided to add this Casio to my collection. For me, the timless black bezel/black dial on stainless band is the only way to fly. I've had it for two weeks and so far I am very impressed. First, the good:`<br /><br />At 43mm across (minus the crown) this watch is perfectly sized on my 6.5"" wrist, and has a beefy, masculine look.  The screw down crown and caseback are nice touches. I don't personally like to get my watches wet if I can avoid it, but its nice to know the 200m water resistance is there. The coin edge unidirectional bezel rotates smoothly. The red-tipped second hand hits extremely close to the markers. The date and time are both very easy to set. The bezel is nice and glossy and the face has an interesting shimmer to it depending on how the light hits it. Its a subtle effect but a welcome one. I really like the Marlin logo near the 6:00 position. Finally, the watch keeps excellent time.<br /><br />And now the rest:<br /><br />The watch is very substantial and has a hefty feel which I don't mind that much, but this may annoy some buyers. The lume is practically non-existant. It glows dimly, for a few minutes and then its gone. There is no LED or EL backlight. The bracelet, while not terrible, is made of folded links instead of solid. I may change out to a leather band for variety.<br /><br />I bought this watch to have a quality piece with the looks of a Submariner or Seamaster at a fraction of the price, and it delivers, esp at less than $60. Highly recommended."
4.0,"Loved it but sizes run small, I got the XL, I'm a size 12 it was still too small."
4.0,"Not exactly the color you see on the picture. However, the product is good"
4.0,Great for someone petite like me 5'3&#34;. Wish the quality was a bit better.
4.0,These are actually my favorite earring. I will say though that it took me about 45 mins to get all 6 in my ears at first time after that I love them they look cute.
4.0,I like the emerald color but was hoping itd be a bit longer like shown on the model
4.0,"Looking forward to wearing this dress, will have to take it in on the sides."
4.0,Perfect for a cat lover! My friend was so excited to show off her love of cats! Looks to be worth way more than the price too!
4.0,"For the money I paid, it's a decent product."
4.0,The surplice wrap stays put and doesn't gap.  Very attractive print and overall comfy shirt.
4.0,Great only used  2 times so far!' When I really get to use it I know it will be awesome !
4.0,Very pretty. I wish I had ordered 2 because the length was too short to make a necklace.
4.0,nice looks good good snap
4.0,This top is really cute. It fits as expected. I love the color also. I recommend this cute top. It also hides my muffin top!! Which is a plus!
4.0,Item fit correctly<br />Easy to get on and off<br />Very satisified
4.0,great product and idea.
4.0,I purchased this for a 70's theme dance and the waistcoat runs small it seems but I needed it to finish 'my 70's look'.
4.0,Beautiful ❤️.
4.0,"The do look a little cheap, they are kind of polyester/shiny looking. But they will work for what I need"
4.0,"I was nervous to buy because there not many reviews but this product was exactly what it said! I got everything, and it works."
4.0,nice fit and fun to wear
4.0,I bought it for my 8 1/2 year old when he plays basketball. Wristbands are fine but I wish the headband was as wide as the wristbands. It’s only 1.5 inches wide. Gets even more narrow as you stretch it.<br />This info should have been included in the description.
4.0,"Fantastic wallet! I get so many compliments on this. It is incredibly difficult to remove my driver's license from the slot if it's pushed all the way inso I always keep it poking out for easy access. Also, some of the credit card holders are really tight and you cannot put regular sized cards there. Overall, LOVE this wallet even with these few flaws."
4.0,"Super cute and as pictured! 126lb, 34A, 29,36 and I ordered a large. Fabric doesn't really breathe and fits a little close in the arms, just fyi"
4.0,love this shirt but it's a little small. I'm 5'2 and weight 157. I should have gotten xl
4.0,My daughter loves the earrings.
4.0,"The buckles works ok, I would of gave a five star if the female side of buckle had two slots for adjustments."
4.0,"they fit well, and good for 15$. But the quality is not worth more money"
4.0,"Beautiful sweater.  Just like the photo. But its way too big. If you have slender children, size down. I ordered the medium 7-8, for my 7 year old. And she could have easily worn the size small 5-6."
4.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband who has a bone spur on one foot. He loved the look of it, especially the diversity to wear indoors or outdoors.  He hasn't utilized the additional inserts that came with it, satisfied with gel pad inserted. Since he's just starting to wear them,  not even a week yet, he's hesitant to give it 5 stars just yet. But he's  happy with them enough that he may want a 2nd pair for Father's Day,  lol!"
4.0,Very pretty dress. I received many compliments on it. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 160. The medium fit perfectly. The only problem with this dress is the zipper. It kept getting stuck. I can see it breaking after a few more uses.
4.0,"I wish it came in a larger size.  After washing in cold water on delicate and hanging to dry, it is a bit snug in the bust.  It is very soft and I need the buttons after shoulder surgery.  Even though it is snug, the buttons stay closed."
4.0,"Do yourself a favor and buy them, because you really will be surprised on how comfortable they are, money well spent I would say."
4.0,Great material. Sizes are weird. I wear 8-10 which is usually a medium. I ordered an XL and it fits fine
4.0,"These heels will turn heads for sure & are as pictured. However, just make sure that you size up a half size or whole size. I purchased my normal size (9).  They run just a little small and my toes were exactly at the top of the heel. I'm that girl who constantly wears heels. So as far as comfort I wore them to an event and my feet only hurt a little. I believe it's because I should've sized up. I received multiple compliments on them and they all wanted to know where they could purchase."
4.0,"Sexy dress, got it as a gift from my husband.  Will be stitching just some small spots along the lower breast area so that it will look just like in the picture above."
4.0,It's a really cute skirt. The material is a little thin so plan to wear underwear that will suit that. Not at all see through though which is a huge plus. I bought a medium and it is a tad large on me but that's not the skirt's fault. I'm a fairly thin individual and should have known to buy a small. Because of the material it does stretch out a tiny bit throughout the day which is not a big deal if you buy the correct size.
4.0,This dress was tight on my arms and breast.
4.0,"Dan's wife here. These socks are holding up pretty good so far. They do have a little compression to them, and sometimes my feet get a little too warm by days end. Since it's been 100 degree weather here, I may like that come winter. I do like the little tab at the back, which keeps them from sliding down into my shoes during the day. I like the pop of color on these socks, and I like to match them to my outfit. I'd buy them again."
4.0,"Great fabric, great fit! I will order from this company again. I ordered for a fam member. After reading reviews, I ordered 2 sizes larger than she normally wears, and it fits nicely. Order up a size."
4.0,"A bit smaller than I was expecting, but still comfy and pretty.  I've been machine washing and drying them on delicate setting with no problems."
4.0,A little thinner than I thought it was but a lovely ear cuff.
4.0,Very fast shipping! Ordered it Tuesday and received it today at 8am eastern time! I'm not wild about the metal rim and how it bends/creases. It looks weird but for the price you can't beat it! It will serve it's purpose to keep the sun off my face on vacation next week. I must have a small head cuz it fit my head well almost kinda larger then expected. I'm fine with the purchase.
4.0,"I really like these jeans. that being said, they are little shorter in length than what it appears in the pic.  Still a solid pair of jean."
4.0,"Fits a little bit too loose, material is not yhe best but its okay otherwise."
4.0,"I’m 5’11”, 46” chest, 210lbs: yep, a bit overweight. XL jacket fits perfectly.<br />Note: no zipper for connecting to pants."
4.0,Elastic band at waist is loose and prone to twist and move. Otherwise a great skirt for the price.
4.0,This sterling silver ring has been rhodium plated to keep the silver from tarnishing. The simulate stones stand out and the S curve sets those stones off. Very nice ring.
4.0,"I bought the medium bag cover for use with a Kelty Redwing 50 backpack. [[ASIN:B009R6B3NQ Kelty Redwing 50 Backpack - Forest Green]] I commute on a motorcycle, and in addition to keeping my laptop and other electronics (phone, VR goggles, controllers, etc) inside, I also have a change of clothes, shoes and other gear. Most of the time it's no issue, and I think the Kelty pack will hold up fine on it's own, but I wanted a little extra protection. This bag fits very well on the 50L version of the Redwing, and still has a bit of room to flex for when I strap an occasional item to the bag, externally, and snugs down well with the elastic draw string. I have clipped the drawstring to the grab handle at the top of the bag, in the event that wind knocks the cover loose on the freeway, but with the elastic strap that snaps in the middle and the fairly heavy-duty elastic draw string, I'm not too worried. I also elected to go with the orange/reflective, to improve my visibility at night. (The black Redwing pack didn't do me any favors in the visibility department, and this offsets that deficit nicely.) Time will tell how well it holds up to exposure to wind and rain, but there are no major seams I worry about, and the construction seems solid, especially for the price."
4.0,"I really like these bands, they're really comfortable, easy to put on. They're feel really soft, and could totally see myself wearing them to bed.<br /><br />However, I'm not a huge fan of the pins,  they're removable and not set, which seems like it'll be really easy to lose them, it nearly went flying while putting on the band. Which if you rarely change them isn't really going to be an issue, but I change mine all the time."
4.0,"They function,  and look good!"
4.0,I bought two pairs of these - one for me and one for my daughter.  These are very comfortable and help to keep our eyes from being tired.
4.0,good value.  better than expected.
4.0,Nice shirt for the price. Looks good.
4.0,Run a little bit small
4.0,Beautiful and dainty .. delivery took forever though.
4.0,"It's definitely cute, I just wish it was a little bit more fitted. I bought the size medium, 33-26-36 are my measurements. I'm just shy of being 5'3&#34; and weigh 125-127 lbs depending on the day. I have an athletic build, and have more junk in the trunk then I do fat on my chest. I am short, so the dress drags the ground, and I step on it when I walk. I have to tie it if I wanna wear it, or I'll trip and fall lol. This is my main issue with maxi dresses, and why I don't own any. Maxi dresses definitely fit taller women better."
4.0,"I have not wore them yet, but I tried them on, I like it, can't wait for weather to get warmer to wear it!"
4.0,"It seemed of fairly nice quality, but the style didn't suit my body type. The way the front draped down from my bust, it made it look as though I had a huge belly."
4.0,Chain was very petite. Very thin chain. My stepdaughter wanted this chain to replace one that had broke.
4.0,They're not too thick & they're not too thin.
4.0,"I wasn't really expecting much since these were rather inexpensive.  I love sunglasses, but I'm not willing to pay a lot since I tend to scratch mine or break them easily.  For the price of these, I'd figure I'd try them out.  At first, I wasn't really sure if I liked them after trying them on, but after wearing them for a bit, I really do like these.  I love the style and they seem pretty durable for the price point."
4.0,It did not fit properly for my head. I gave it away as a gift and the woman loves this hat.
4.0,This dress fit great. You could dress it up or wear to the beach.
4.0,"This piece isn't totally glamourous or anything, but it's nice nonetheless and the chain is actually quite sturdy. I bought it for a gift and it is definitely loved! I would say that it looks very close to the picture (at least with my display), so if you're expecting something shinier I think you'll be disappointed. The pendant is a little more copper than brass toned, and it only &#34;shines&#34; in the light."
4.0,"This is beautiful, the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it's HEAVY"
4.0,"Feb. 10,2017<br />So here is an update. After my last review I was contacted and told that I would be sent a second pair of better quality.  It took some time to receive it but it was worth the wait. The quality of the pants were 100xs better. The material is way thicker and even softer. I see myself purchasing a couple more pairs.<br /><br />These pants are very comfortable, but I can't wear them outside. They are super transparent and very thin. I was very disappointed."
4.0,The sweater is very cute but I didn't give it 5 stars because it's possible the most uncomfortable material ever. It's so scratchy.
4.0,Looks exactly like in the picture. I bought this for my mum since her skin is sensitive to the sun and she wanted something to lounge in the pool NOT as a COVID protection tool. The only flaw is that the nose piece is uncomfortable but I just used padded bandages to wrap it
4.0,They look exactly as pictured.  I bought two sets and I’d definitely buy again. Such a great gift idea!
4.0,it fits a little too snug until it stretched out a bit.  but its very breathable.
4.0,Really cute. Nice quality and fits true to size.<br />I got a Medium
4.0,"It is a little tight, but I think with time it will stretch and will be perfect!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:872a6ec615b867337a87a2c775577159]] Se conecta mediante el Bluetooth, muy bonito y todo, lo que no me gusta es que no toma la presión de forma automática, y tampoco cada hora, sino que hay que hacerlo manualmente. Las notificaciones si puedes leer y si avisa cuando una persona llama. Una correa extra. Cada vez yo quiera tomar la presión tengo que ir a la app y poner medición manualmente, eso no me gustó. 😣"
4.0,"Exactly as described, good quality and really cute"
4.0,Like the clarity and the convenience of the cases to store when not in use. As far as durability will have to wait. Otherwise happy with purchase.
4.0,"Size a little larger than expected from sample photo, but reasonable quality and style for the price."
4.0,They’re comfy and they fit my niece just right
4.0,"I have found that although these are beautiful in design and looks, they are also a bit heavy for me."
4.0,this skort is fantastic if you order a size up. you can kind of see the shorts in the front but still very cute.
4.0,My granddaughter really liked this bracelet; I hope it will hold up to her liveliness.
4.0,"Very cute charm, great fit for bracelet."
4.0,"I ordered this t-shirt in the blue tie-dye color. I am about 5’6” and usually wear an XL in shirts. I did order this shirt in a 2XL and I’m glad I did. It would have been too clingy for me to feel comfortable wearing it in public. It’s long enough that it covers my waistline and pretty much covers my butt so I considered it a good length. It drapes nicely. It is slightly on the thin side, thin enough that it would likely be see through if it was white. The biggest reason for the four stars is that the color is a little inaccurate. The blue is quite a bit brighter in person. Enough so that I probably won’t wear it in public. If you like bright colors then you’ll probably like this. Anyway, I don’t dislike it enough to bother with sending it back so I’ll keep it and try again with another color/design"
4.0,Good buy. Fits as expected. &#60; 5'6&#34; - 137 lbs  ordered a medium&#62;.
4.0,Love the look of these septum rings. They easily flip back into the nostrils so you can hide your piercing from judgmental people.  The only downside is that they lose the rose gold color and end up looking a bit brassy. They’re still shiny though.
4.0,"Very good quality, however the ponytail/bun hole is a bit small for my super thick hair. But overall very nice hat!"
4.0,My desk was missing parts
4.0,"These socks are great for road trips for me! I recently did a road trip, as soon as I received then I couldnt wait to give my honest opinion on these from my road trip. I put these socks on and did not have swelling ankles, amazing!"
4.0,"Good product all around. A little difficult to put on my watch, it was very snug to the lugs and just barely fit. The outsides are not perfectly smooth, but I only noticed that when I first started wearing it. It occasionally catches an arm hair, but I expected that."
4.0,"I really love this swimsuit! The material is very nice. My only issue is that it's a bit big for me in the top. I would usually wear a small or medium, but based on reviews I ordered a large. If I got less than a large I wouldn't of been able to fit into the bottoms, but because I got a large I don't really fit into the top. All in all it's a great suit, it's not too noticeable that it's too big on top. I love it!"
4.0,"This suit is well made and has a flattering design. The  material is high quality and all the seams are serged and well secured. As far as quality goes, there is nothing to complain about. However, the description states that this suit has an underwire, and it does NOT have an underwire. It has soft cups.<br />The fit is not going to work for everyone. When I purchased this suit, there was a size guide that is now gone. I bought the size based on the measurements provided, but it was much too large. The size guide also specified a bra cup size to go with each size that is also now gone from the listing. The cup sizes seem to be pretty generous for the size of the suit. I think this suit would be best for ladies who are busty for their size, and when in doubt, go with a smaller size over a larger.<br />I received a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,I'm usually a size small or medium but I had to order a large. It is really sexy but simple so I'm happy with my purchase!
4.0,"Great for extra, back up mittens"
4.0,"Still was a nice necklace, but the pendant was much larger than I had anticipated.  Works best with a longer chain."
4.0,Nice fitting shorts and I like the little pocket just big enough for a key or card.
4.0,Good quality  dress
4.0,I am happy with my purchase.  I received lots of compliments on this dress.  I plan to get another one in a different color.
4.0,"Cute dress! However, it does run small. Not much give to the material either. I originally purchased a small, which I usually do in most clothing, but had to exchange for a medium.  Even the medium seems just a tad snug in the waist area, so keep that in mind. Fti it zips up in the back."
4.0,Great work pants black size pants fit to size.
4.0,This is a nice bag.<br />I love the style and it is so soft.
4.0,Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the bottoms were a little shorter than I expected. Love it. It fits well and is same quality I would get at a store
4.0,I bought these for a fun way to sneak a little bit of color into my appearance on Zoom meetings. They aren’t very sparkly (the stones are just glass) but the gold-tone hoops are substantial enough to be noticed.
4.0,"These are attractively-packaged earrings with nice ""curb appeal.""  Marketed as ""rose gold"" and also ""copper"" it is unknown what they are actually made out of but if you're looking for an inexpensive pair of earrings that appear to be more expensive than they are, this might work for daily wear.  I wore them for several days and will mention that the curved post is a bit of an issue to place into the piercing, so if you have sensitive ears, you might consider a straight post instead.  Also, I will mention (from their website) they claim ""JUMOO is an independent American brand.""  The website, however, includes some of the worst English, which directly calls that into question.  Bottom line:  if you don't care about the true origin of materials or the actual material content, they are fine for the cost."
4.0,"It's just as described, went up 2 sizes and it fits fine, pretty color, airy crochet style will look nice over a maxi dress for a wedding."
4.0,"And because it runs big, the cat ears flop at the back of your head and can’t be seen unless you fold up the bottom of the hat, but I don’t care for how that looks.<br />O well. I’m still taking it on vacation because it’s warm and I can make it work."
4.0,"For the price you are really just paying for the look, don’t expect it to stay charged"
4.0,"I ordered the small ones, and they fit well-being proportionate to the size of my face!<br /><br />I literally have NO nose bridge to speak of, and they will slide down my face sometimes, resulting in me pushing them back up, but that's the only complaint I have! Otherwise, these glasses are a very good deal for the price!"
4.0,It's worth the amount paid for it. Not really a standout watch.
4.0,Love the colors and got many compliments on them. They are a little loose in my ear and did chip when one fell out.
4.0,"Good color, liked the American flag logo, looks like it's well built and a great value for the money."
4.0,This snap back hat fit as expected
4.0,"So cute and looks like it's going to fit my little one perfectly. I'm saving it for Christmas. It's completely her style, which is difficult to find for a 5 year old girl that is chic and is not into ruffles."
4.0,Great for a getaway to Tahoe! Minus one-star because after several hours in the snow I did notice a bit of wetness coming through. All in all I would purchase again for recreational and novice skiing use.
4.0,"Very nice, great reminder to grow through what u go through.  God will show you how to grow through it."
4.0,These earrings are very cute but much smaller than expected. Quality seems good. Wished they were in a gift box.
4.0,I'm 5'4 215lb &usually wear 16/18 &mostly 2XL depending on the brand...I'm giving it 4stars only because it states that its t-shirt but its thicker &much heavier than just your basic longsleeve cotton t-shirt. It even cinches in at the bottom like sweatshirts do. But I still love it! I have small waistline but naturally big hips &thighs &babies brought on the gut so its slightly a little tighter around my lower stomach than I wanted but maybe that'll motivate to get rid of it! Over all-a good buy!
4.0,"These fit very well. I was a little worried about how they'd fit and if they would rip, but they didn't rip and fit quiet well. I got them for a costume and they fit very well with them. My only complaint was how difficult it was to get them up without worrying about ripping them. I would definitely buy more of these."
4.0,"Perfect size and great quality for the price. I love this key and I wear it frequently. The chain is cheap and doesn't suit the key very well, but I just switched chains on another necklace and now I'm thrilled."
4.0,it was for a gift
4.0,I really like it ! It fit ok
4.0,"I purchased a large I’m a normal size 12 it fit as to be expected.  Covers just below the waist line. Sometimes in a large the sleeves are tight, not accounting for heavier arms- this fit comfortably not tight. It is not as soft as I thought it would be- however it’s perfect for  office a/c temp. It’s not bright - more like a washed out tone. Looks great with jeans or capris.  The multi colored  gives me a chance to change the look of it depending on the solid tee I wear under it.  For the dollar amount I would say it’s a fair value, I don’t know how it will hold up after a washing.  I would suggest hand wash cycle - I don’t  use a dryer for the majority of items like this.  I prefer to lay flat to dry.  I just received it and wore it only 1 time so it’s not yet ready for laundering  I’m glad I purchased it. Nice addition to my spring/summer light weight sweaters."
4.0,"Looks way better on the model, but still comfy.  I think it runs a bit larger."
4.0,"Solved my cold feet problem when riding my fat bike.  My only gripe with these is the toes on one of them keeps popping up and off the shoe for some reason.  Not impossible to fix, just stop and pull it back over, but it is a thing."
4.0,Product fine
4.0,Worked as advertised and arrived as ordered.
4.0,I love the shorts but the elastic keeps folding over every time I put them on.  If the elastic could stay in place they would be perfect.
4.0,"I'm a 38D, I ordered 2XL & it was too small. Plus, it doesn't offer much support, though I wanted them for sleeping, I didn't care for them. I ended up returning them to Amazon."
4.0,I almost kept but it was for an occasion and found them a little darker than expected and since I don’t wear jewelry this piece didn’t work out for me.  If I was a jewelry person would have kept them.
4.0,"The colors were exactly as advertised. I personally think they run big in size. I normally wear a large but using they’re size chart I thought I would need an XL. This wasn’t the case. Otherwise, it was a great choice."
4.0,"Sure is cute. I couldn't wear the one I received because it was too small. In this case, small means small. I ended up giving it to my 15 year old gkid and it fits her perfectly. The pockets are toward the front not the side but the gap is minimal. There is also a gap at the arm pit, but is minimal as well. Stitching is good, use gentle wash and low dry. Smart looking and pretty! I recommend it. Also, the back is stretchy to give you a great fit."
4.0,"the actula color was a purple /lavender in my opinion.  I had 2 pairs of these in the black which i love, in the past i had to watch for the screws coming loose . actually had the eyegall place strip one of the screws so that pair didnt last long.  not to say it was the glasses themselves..  this seller was good to work with on returning these for the color was wrong."
4.0,"Good Cufflinks. They weigh more than expected and look nice. I bought them for my brother for Christmas. They appear to be made well. Can't speak to their durability yet, but they are nice looking."
4.0,"Long overdue in giving the seller credit. I have had mostly good luck with these belts. One came apart sooner than it should, but I didn’t care for it properly. I just like them, they work, and I had one that came with a damaged buckle, then the replacement came damaged (from shipping I’m sure). “Abe” gave me great, attentive customer care, and I’ll be buying their belts as long as I’m able to. Gave four stars because they aren’t the greatest quality, but I’ll give them five stars for value and six stars for customer service."
4.0,"These are very cute, but apparently they appeared much bigger in the photo.  lol!  I'm sure the size was listed somewhere and I missed it.  These are about half an inch big.  All in all, good quality and they will be perfect for jewelry or zipper pulls, etc.  I just wish they'd been a bit bigger.  Items arrived packaged well and at the beginning of the shipping window.  I would order from Housweety again."
4.0,"I am 5’2 and 125 lbs. I ordered a small. It was overall a good fit but I wish the elastic in the waist was a bit tighter. Overall, it’s a beautiful dress and is made well."
4.0,Very comfortable Shoe.
4.0,I like this bag. The size is perfect. I’m using in my car. It seems that the locking glovebox is a thing of the past for Ford Motor Co.. I now can lock my wallet and other valuables  in my bag and am sure they will be there when I return to my car. Very happy with it. Thank you.
4.0,"I like the case a lot, very unique. Make sure you read the title carefully, i thought it was a case that went all the way around... its a clip on. But im loveing it so far, fots great!"
4.0,"Seems to be a good quality. I am 5'2&#34;. Had a baby 4 months ago and 135 right now. So extra fluff. Ordered a medium, the torso was longer than I needed, little too big, but small would be too tight. Had some really hard and odd shaped breast pads. I took them out because they looked very odd. If you have smaller breasts this might not work for you, cups are larger in my opinion. It was cute and a lot of tummy, thigh, butt.....coverage. Does look like a little sun dress though."
4.0,"Thin profile, cool '80s styling.  I had a similar model about 35 years ago which lasted for many years.  I wish the light was brighter but I can live with it.  Simple functions, good, pragmatic, retro-style watch at a great price - nothing fancy."
4.0,"Very good,  one tools was broken had to fix it but not bad for the price."
4.0,"Don't know about the longevity, but the material is great and they feel awesome."
4.0,"The string I received did not have the guru tassle bead as pictured, just a continuous string. One of the beads has a very faint etching on it, so maybe that was supposed to be the guru bead, but you have to really look for it. Would not be able to tell if you were sitting with eyes closed, moving along the string, but otherwise it is a nice looking mala I can wear around my wrist for when I need a grounding aid and a short sit.<br />For the price, very nice."
4.0,"These are light and comfortable and keep my feet warm. The color is nice, I like it."
4.0,Good quality but a little small than my other sweatshirts of different brand and the same size.
4.0,"Very functional and seems durable. A little fat, but the upside is it has lots of sleeves for cards and a zippered section for bills."
4.0,"I have a tiny neck, so the chockers have a gape between them and my neck. So they tend to turn around so that the back chain thing is in front and the ball that is supposed to be in front is in the back. That sucks but again I have a very small neck. I just wish there was a smaller range for those with little necks and maybe for those with bigger ones"
4.0,Not a closet main feature. But a nice solid piece to have. Cant go wrong with it.
4.0,"Very warm. It's not an overcoat where I could wear many layers underneath, but it is so warm that it has to be a very cool day to use it. It is nice looking and dressy enough to wear to a nice dinner with my wife. She thinks it looks good. I'm 5'11 220 and ordered a large."
4.0,I am very happy.
4.0,"At this point in life I certainly ""should not"" be buying dresses with skulls all over them, but I simply cannot help myself.  They're adorable!  And so is this dress, it accentuates the curves I want to be noticed, and hides those I don't.  It really is a miracle cut, and when it finally dies, I've got to make a pattern from the remains. Or maybe buy a few as a backup.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars were it made of something like cotton or rayon knit, which I find cooler to wear.  But these days they've done some miraculous thing to polyester and it doesn't feel like I'm wrapping myself in saran wrap whenever I wear it.  Sure, I still get sweatier than if I were wearing, say, linen - but it's not a walking sauna in a frock like it used to be. And they can keep up this trend, I'm actually starting to (gasp) like polyester.<br /><br />Anyway, fiber tangent aside, I freaking love this dress!  The print is fresh even after machine laundering, the cut is great for our warmer weather, and when it gets cold it can be worn with leggings and a sweater."
4.0,"I got this before I went to study abroad and love it. It is actually genuine leather. I ordered the black and it looks very classy. The embossed USA symbol on the front is clear yet subtle. My only complaint would be that when your actual passport is in the sleeve on the inside, it doesn't fold over completely (like a book). There is a bit of a gap. This does work great as a quick wallet too, especially in between all of those security lines!"
4.0,"good band for the price, I can tell it will not last a long time though."
4.0,My daughter and I wore matching shirts for a race.  We received tons of compliments!
4.0,I am infamous for trying new tights. Be careful with these they snag easily. If you’re careful you can get more then I will wear out if them. Also they don’t stretch as much as I personally like. I have think thighs and hips so I need that extra pull. Overall these are ok.
4.0,Seems nicely made...should last.
4.0,"The cosmetic bag is larger than I expected, but I'm sure all of the pockets will come in handy on my next trip."
4.0,Love these cups. Gave 4 stars due to my opinion that they are overpriced.
4.0,Very nice blouse. Material is very soft. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a bit too small.
4.0,2X fit me fine but the 3X is amazing. Need more of these in 3XL
4.0,"I like these keychains.  They are unique for wrist band keychains.  The Macrame is soft and each key chain is ""braided"" differently.  The keychain without the tassel uses a traditional ""braiding"" while the one with the tassel uses traditional Macrame ""braiding"".  Both are very functional and I loved the different color choices.  I would recommend these keychains."
4.0,Nice product. As expected. 1 of the glasses had a piece unglued but easily fixed
4.0,Wear alot. Not dry wicking
4.0,"Great quality, but the size med was a little large for my child"
4.0,"I ordered this dress in the white, maroon and black so that I could see which one looked best.  This dress is short waisted - meaning that the waist line hits just below the bust for anyone (like me) who is long waisted.)  I ordered the S and M (I am a 6-8; 34D) and found the S to be too tight under the arms in the bust.  It is a heavy fabric, and I wish the waist dropped a bit more.  That said, it is a very pretty dress for the money.  The white is a bit immature, the black looks elegant and the maroon looks like a day dress.  Because of the cream underlay, it is not for anyone who is not slim because it accentuates the figure and in addition, makes the bust look larger."
4.0,The watch is lovely and well made.  The band appears quality- my problem is it is hard to read because the hands are light metal color and for me (old person) blend in too easily.  I’m sure it’s good for others just a consideration if you are looking for easy to read
4.0,"Much better quality compare to other brands, belt is thicker and workmanship is superior.."
4.0,I do not know yet because I bought this coat for my daughter in another country🖐
4.0,"Out fit runs a liitle big.  Looks like pic. It is on the thin side but you can dress it up or down. The colors are vibrant. I am 5'5 and 178lbs and I ordered a medium. The pants are fitted but not tight and the jacket fits perfectly. I'm a 36c, and usually wear a size 7 or 9 in jr. pants and 8/10 in women's depending on the cut."
4.0,"Love the style of this dress & got many compliments on it! If I had a criticism, it would be that the fabric was not the cotton feel/look expected."
4.0,I received the item in perfect condition.  Plenty of room for my two cowboy hats.  This item isn't high quality by any means...but if you are looking for storage for your hats this is perfect.  It will sit on the top shelf of my closet and keep my hats clean and safe.  I for sure would not travel with it on a plane unless I was certain I could keep it with me.
4.0,"Granddaughter loved it!  She is 11, so I ordered an adult small.  She is tall and skinny.  Probably could have ordered x-small, but she has plenty of room to grow into it, as well as being able to wear it over other shirts."
4.0,Love it but a little too big.
4.0,"Nice chain, love the two lengths."
4.0,"Nice simple design. Great over leggings or skinny jeans, and paired with boots. The fabric is soft and it drapes well. It's been washed and dried, still looks great."
4.0,Really love this shirt but it runs really small. I am normally a small and ordered a small and it is skin tight. After I return it I may order a size bigger.
4.0,I ordered this product to add an easy way to attach a lanyard to a drone controller. It functions very well in the use I purchased it for. it would also be very useful to hold a small amount of keys. The ease of use in putting them on or taking them off would be very welcome in comparison to the old school type of key ring. My only issue was several unexplained delays in receiving the item after shipping. Once the delivery arrived I was pleased with the ring. Perhaps a bit pricey for two rings but the cost of ease of use and convenience I suppose. They did include as a bonus two small traditional type rings. Perhaps for attaching a fob of some type.
4.0,"Nice, light and stylish. Reasonably good lenses. I pick them for the unusual style of frame. Happy with my choice"
4.0,It's still a little too big for my liking
4.0,"Cheapy fabric but ok for summer time. Simple dress you can wear just daily bases it will look nicer for slim people not so flattering for my body type I'm 5""2ft , 133lbs. I could just to Macy's get good quality dress on clearance for the same amount I paid for this."
4.0,Waist fits well. Baggy fit. Great for lounging.
4.0,Good items but if it have a box then it will be perfect for gifts.
4.0,"Can text and make calls with out taking them off , specially when it’s too cold ,but not warm enough for very cold weather . Great texture and looks very nice ♥️"
4.0,good quality. good fit. I would recommend this to others.
4.0,My 16 year old granddaughter circled this in a catalog many months ago but I was thrilled to find it on amazon.com. exactly as described and very gentle reminder for shy teenager.
4.0,It has pretty colors but the material is very thin.
4.0,"The dress is very nice, fits a tad too big but mostly true to size. My only issue was that the neck area is a little too loose on me."
4.0,"Loved the feel of this dress! The lace is not the itchy, rough kind but a soft and stretchy kind.  I could have probably gone with one size smaller if it were not for my bigger arms.  I'm short (4'11&#34;) and this dress is short too. I loved it with little tennis shoes like one photo showed.  Even though it is all lace overlay, it is so incredibly comfortable that I'm keeping it!  Wish it came in other colors as I would have liked a dark blue because this looks like a casual wedding dress.  Love it! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it is a bit see-through. I wear white shorts under it and I could see the waist line since they were white and my back is tan. Still wearing though as it isn't too see-through. Loved the feel and comfy fit!"
4.0,"Very cute top which I will be wearing still but ended up being a bit shorter than I expected, I love the cut off the shoulders & will still be rocking this top!"
4.0,good price- would love if it was an inch or two shorter. I'm 5' 3&#34; and comes below the knee.
4.0,Very nice bracelet for the price.
4.0,Beautiful blouse nice soft material. Too big I order M as 4 size and I ended up given it to my mom whom is xxl and it fit. Not returning since my mom loved it. But I am diss appointed because I am 4-6 in size and it was huge.
4.0,"So far I have liked this necklace and it has not tarnished at all! It's nice for the price. Personally I would splurge a little more because the finish does look a little cheap and the chain does roll up around itself a bit, but this works well for tweens who are looking to learn to accessorize without spending a whole lot."
4.0,I bought these for my 11 year old daughter for a fun accessory. They were a bit big for her face but she seemed to like them. I will say that for the price the quality was what I was expecting. They aren't RayBan and didn't cost as much so I am happy. She will probably lose them in a week anyway.
4.0,"I love these leggings but the material, while really soft, does not hide anything! They will show everything."
4.0,"Seems good quality, image is printed well. Fit as expected for my husband who is 6' and 230lbs with a long torso. We ordered the xl, though he usually wears a 2xl to get the right length."
4.0,Keeps my daughter's littler 3 year old fingers nice an toasty in the snow. The liner can shift causing difficulty putting them back on for the 30th time in an afternoon. They are long as well which can make fitting them under a coat sleeve diff9if you want to seal snow out.
4.0,"The top is not as supportive as I wanted. I wear a 46D Bra and this top may be a little large for me. I have not adjusted the straps although they are adjustable. I dont like the padded cups and lack of support under the bosom area but this could be because the top is a bit to big. Might be good for less endowed women but not for D's. The length is good the quality seems to be good as well.the shorts are VERY short, shorter than pictured."
4.0,"Love this top, fits well."
4.0,It was a gift for my wife but unfortunately it was a size too big
4.0,"love the product but the little red tag in the corner can be felt when the wallet is in your pocket, especially a back pocket. If that was removed, it would be perfect."
4.0,"This is a really good quality and beautiful dress for special occasions. i ordered size 0, I can easily say that dress fits perfectly on me however two inches of the top of the zipper did not close. So i had to return it. It is more beautiful than the pictures."
4.0,Have only used for a few days so far appears to be well made and holds a lot of cards. Cash satisfies the product but the hole in the wallet is the unnecessary in this product i guess.Overall i like the card holding capacity of this wallet. Cash can also be kept easily.
4.0,They are super cute BUT i thought this was for kids so i bought it but no they are so large. So unfortunately will have to return it. As i said they are cute cut not for kids.
4.0,"This handbag is made from some of the softest leather I've ever seen.  Also, the sheen on the leather and the dark metal buckles add to the bag's beauty.  My only caveat is that I didn't pay attention to the styling, because it's obvious, given the meticulously crafted handles, that the bag is designed more to be a carried like a briefcase, rather than slung over your chest as a cross body bag.  I've been trying to wear it cross body for the past few weeks, and the handles (especially when I sit down) keep getting in the way.  Even so, I've decided to keep it."
4.0,"So far so good. Purchased these for our grandson to start the school year off. I haven't actually seen them lit, but they say he loves them."
4.0,It's a little tough but she loves it.
4.0,"These hiking pants and comfortable, water resistent, protect against the wind, and have 4 zippered compartments. They're great for hiking or long walks. They have a belt incorporated in them, providing more leeway for sizing.<br />These aren't fashionable urban pants but they do serve their specific purpose well. I plan to use them walking and trekking once the Covid 19 shutdown is over."
4.0,"Material is soft and thin, somewhat cheap but hasn't broken on me yet. Looks good, fits fairly well. Came in as it appears in the photo."
4.0,I like these because of their simplicity & that I can wear them with almost anything. The footbed was thinner than I expected for a Ryka shoe(barely thicker than Sketchers memory foam).
4.0,"I'm not quite sure of the fit on these. They seem a little &#34;short&#34; yet when I taught my yoga classes they stayed on pretty well. I had expected them to slip. So, maybe they are exactly the fit that they are designed for, but my expectations were for a larger sock.<br />What I really like about them is that they are not bulky, allowing my toes to move easily. They are perfect for keeping me safe on a slippery floor."
4.0,"This dress is really nice I bought it to wear to a work event. It's really long though lol I'm 5ft  8 1/4"" and I got an Xtra-large I think I could have gotten away with a large I'm on the curvy side so didn't want to risk it. The dress is really long I even got a 4"" heel and it's still running on the ground. I have to be careful not to trip. Shipping was fast. For the price I got this dress if you're on a budget and need something nice get it.<br /><br />I will update with a pic later."
4.0,"Didn't fit quite as expected. Also didn't look as good as in the picture. However, they did serve their purpose for keeping me warm."
4.0,"I love the dress it flares really nicely at the knees. (I'm 5'7'') the v neck isn't too deep, and the rushing at the midwaist makes it look really relaxed but at the same time classic. The color I picked was the deep wine red. It came very nicely packaged in a plastic bag, I would buy this brand again."
4.0,"I am 5'2"" and this gown hits me about 3"" above the ankle, so it is on the short side. The sleeve length is just above my wrist bone.  I bought this gown because I prefer a lighter weight flannel with elastic wristbands and no pockets.  Wish it was longer and came in a plaid or solid pattern, but I would buy again because of the comfort."
4.0,looks great !!!
4.0,"Love this, get alot of compliments on it at parties"
4.0,The fabric is a little stiff but it still looks great on and I love the pockets! It fits perfect I am 5'6&#34; normally a size 6 so this fit perfect. If you are larger on top you should get a larger size.
4.0,I liked how it looked and fit. I just don't like the black zipper but it is not very small.
4.0,They're a pretty good size for most thin ties.
4.0,Super cute and super soft but runs sooooo large!
4.0,"These are perfectly adequate socks for soccer players - plenty of length to cover shin guards, enough compression so they don't slide down during a game (thanks to 3 separate areas of banding) and the size L is just about right for an 11/12 year old player with a size 7 or 8 soccer boot. The material is smooth and a good weight, it seems to be nylon but there's no information provided. There's a feature over the calf where the material appears to be mesh, apparently for some ventilation. The socks smell as bad as any others after a game - unavoidable! - but washed up nicely without shrinkage."
4.0,"This was a very good value. However, the polish is more of a cream so you will not get the bright shine that a kiwi type product would achieve. Great starter kit."
4.0,I hat masks touching my face. This makes mask wearing a little bit more bearable. We life in a humid area so this does collect moisture at times. I just use mole skin to line it with and it makes it easier to wear.
4.0,"Overall I like the product. If you are a heavy sleeper like me, there is a chance you would take it off in your sleep. For the most part, it would help me wake up no problem."
4.0,I love these the only problem with them is that the band on top is a little too tight and starts to burn my calf towards the end of my 12 hour shift.
4.0,Not very sexy but dang it they're so comfy.
4.0,La blusa hermosa de buen material pero la falda es más básica aunque se ve linda
4.0,"THIS TOP IS SOFT AND SUPER CUTE? LOOKS GOOD WITH BLACK, WHITE AND DENIM"
4.0,Great Hat To Have. Came fast as expected. Just as good as buying from hat store. Fairly price for being a XL hat vs. L or M or S Size hat. Hat is flexible durable and fits comfy looks good on “us/me” can get wet and hot or cold per hats instructions. Not a inexpensive hat nor expensive hat but it is one of those hats that will be around and for comfy for years to come. Would recommend plus purchase off line A+ Hat !
4.0,My son looks good on them.
4.0,I bought the small. Sleeve length was fine as was the fit across the torso. The back reached to just below my rear end. Falls and drapes nicely. Is soft to the touch and is well made.
4.0,This is a very pretty dress the bottom is a little heavy (not lightweight) it runs a little large I am 5’3 and where a size 4P I bought a medium (4-6) it was a little big a 4 inches to long. I had it altered.
4.0,"This dress suited my needs well - I'm tall and it was long enough to wear with just tights. Material was thick enough to not be see-through. It is a clingy material, but the dress is plenty loose/flowy. I actually belted it around the waist to give a little more shape"
4.0,"I wish I could buy one of these tins, separately, or multiple ones of the one tin."
4.0,I somehow read it wrong and thought this was sweater material...I thought it's fuzzy. But it fits sooooo nicely. It's a tiny bit shorter than I'm comfortable with but it does cover all the important areas and it's very flattering.
4.0,"I like it, works great for hata yoga"
4.0,"I'm 5'10"", 125-130lbs, 32C/34B, athletic/slim build and got this in size small. It was definitely long enough (past my knees - it might be too long on someone shorter), but the elastic waist hit around the lowest part of my ribs instead of my waist. There isn't really any structure to the top/boob part, so unless you fill out the entire chest area, the top will likely be too loose. For the price, I was happy with the fabric (a lightweight polyester) and print. I have a long torso, so if you're tall but have a shorter torso/longer legs, this might still work for you. Definitely would have kept it if it fit my body type. BTW, straps aren't adjustable and buttons are sewn on."
4.0,"Good quality. Nice fabric, but a bit small for the size."
4.0,Welcome to Dusty's Lingerie Reviews. These reviews are from a males perspective. Size Large/7<br /><br />Pretty standard panties. They fit as expected. Material is fairly soft and has some stretch but not overly stretchy. I like the little bow. Striped patterns are always fun. Thick edges will give panty lines. Not my favorite from a male perspective they fit a bit to tight.
4.0,"Very good.  I use them to temporally store the sweaty clothes everyday after work out. No odors.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL - it is not waterproof, do not wash it or rub it.  It has a inner coating which is water resistant to do the job.  While if you rub the bag, the coating layer could be easily damaged."
4.0,"Great fit, kept me dry the entire time while skiing (and falling multiple times in the snow), and they were surprisingly comfortable. Good purchase!"
4.0,"The fit and style were good but the added trim at neckline and near sleeves cheapened the look. All in all, I am happy to have a cool summer dress that didn’t cost a fortune."
4.0,Like the comfort but should have a bit shorter on the length but overall pleased
4.0,"Decent quality for $50 (that's on the cheap end for cosplays) but as many others have stated, the pants are huge.<br /><br />I started out by buying an XXL based on their size chart (mostly because of the hip measurements). It says that the hip measurements are 38-40 inches but that is in fact the waistband measurement of the pants. I then accidentally bought a XL instead of a L. As a side note, the XXL and the XL I received both had button closures on the pants; the L did not. For all pants, there are no actual pockets.<br /><br />My measurements are 30"" waist and 40"" hip and the L pants were still a bit big on me. As a sew-er it was an easy fix by sewing elastic into the waistband and sewing on my own pants hook and eye closure. Those who cannot sew are probably okay with just using a belt if need be.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this product based on the bust measurements. My bust is 36"" and the jacket and dress shirt are not tight at all and fit pretty nicely. The sleeves are a little long but it's better than them being short.<br /><br />The color of the uniform was darker than I was expecting but it's not awful.<br /><br />One last note based on an older review; If you receive a dress shirt with pink marks by the buttons/button holes, that's made with marking pencils for button placement and wash right out. If the marks appear anywhere else then that's a problem."
4.0,Fashionable and easy to carry those few necessities
4.0,I'm in love with every piece of jewelry from this set. Very nice quality. They'll last a long time and they look really good
4.0,It's a really cute design. It's a bit heavy but that's not a bad thing. It's a large piece so you'd expect the weight. The chain is not high quality but better than expected. I like it.
4.0,"Like anything, the fit will depend on the person, but I find this runs small. I am anywhere from an XXS to a Small (usually number sizes 00, 0, or 2, sometimes 4 in bottoms). I am 5'5"", 110 lb. I ordered a Small and it is very short on me, although I am pretty long-waisted (why I went with the largest size I usually wear). Yet the arms are short and loose; they do not fit snugly like a leotard should. So, if you are short or have larger arms, this would probably fit you, but the fit is weird on me. It is fairly sheer in the nude color, but I planned to layer it so it would be ok. I don't think I would wear it alone because it is so sheer."
4.0,This is a nice scarf but mine came with a more bolder print then the one displayed in picture.
4.0,"5'8&#34; 140lbs & I purchased a size Large in black & size XL in gold because I read it runs small. (Normally I'd buy size medium). The Large fits well but the XL is loose on me. If you want the dress to be tight against the skin, purchase ONE size up from your usual. If you want a more loose fitting dress, purchase TWO sizes up from your usual. I am returning the XL but keeping the L. The dress obviously isn't the highest quality when you look closely, but since you usually can't/don't wear sequins dresses all the time, the price & quality are just right for what it is. The sequins don't fall off as they are sewn onto the fabric the dress is made of (not glued like some cheaper fabrics). I reordered the gold in size large because I think this is a great dress!"
4.0,"Man I love these.  Never have I felt so much like a 1960's band groupie as I do with the glasses.  They are not super high quality, if you sit on them, they are done for sure.  The arms are a bit flimsy and would be easy to break.  That said, I don't care, because they look so awesome.  The heart frames actually really flatter my face shape, and these were the only pair I could find that weren't pink or purple, or generally looked like they were meant for a 10 year old.  They may not be bullet proof, but they are so affordable, if mine ever break, I will absolutely buy a new pair."
4.0,"This shirt is very flattering on hourglass figures. The seams seem to be sewn well. The fabric is a lightweight rayon type material, which would make it great for work outfits in the summer."
4.0,I do understand that we have a pandemic and people like to up the price a little bit but I guess the price was fair and we use it because of the pandemic at least it protects us somewhat from the other people if they have the virus.
4.0,"I really like the hat but the colour is different, not that bright and vibrant, more dirty purple..."
4.0,"It's a nice fit. Material is soft and washes well. It's great for cooler nights. Bottoms fall a bit below knees. My biggest complaint is they added a very big scratchy tag about the third of way from bottom of top. It's up high enough that it touches skin. I tried to cut it out, but made a small hole. I just don't know why it needs so many tags. There are also tags in the back."
4.0,Just a tad bit larger than I expected. I plan to order a second pair and I'll reorder them in a SM
4.0,Red is not as in the picture. It's actually bright red like Santa's outfit. But the dress fits good and enhances the shape. I usually wear a large but ordered XL and it fits and not big. The material is soft and stretchy and would need some ironing.
4.0,"For the price, it exceeded my expectations.The purse will be a great companion when I plan to be on my feet for a while, easy on the back."
4.0,needs more stitching in the crotch
4.0,"I really loved this dress! However, it was too big and I had to return it. I'm planning on reordering but at least one size down. Loved the pockets!"
4.0,"I have  a Cpap machine and the headgear was breaking my hair, so one of the women I work with said to get a night cap, This cap is easy to put on even with long hair. It stays on all night and it very silky. I wish it would of come in more colors, but since I only sleep in it it works. the damage to my hair is healing."
4.0,Martha loves it.
4.0,Not cheap looking
4.0,Wrong size …. If you are big get bigger size
4.0,"LOVE this flannel. Long enough to cover bottom, so you can wear with leggings or skinny jeans. Fitted look, so it's not sloppy looking like most flannel shirts. Would have given 5 stars, but the arms are small. And seem to be the same size on all sized shirts. I ordered a 1, which is what I normally wear. the arm was snug. I decided to exchange for a12. The 12 fit the same way. I kept the 12 and ordered a 14!  Same issue. I'll deal with a snug fitting arm since the rest fits awesome and is a really cute shirt."
4.0,"This is a nice light fabric that I hope will be easier to wear in warmer weather. This is the second dress I’ve purchased from the company, and I ordered the same size as before. This one seems to have a much tighter neckline, which is annoying, but I think I’ve been able to stretch it out a bit.  Also, I ordered the black and burgundy colors, and the burgundy seems to be much more red than I expected. Still, not so bright that I don’t like it. Keeping it because I’m otherwise happy."
4.0,"Measurements 44/36/49 230lbs. Big girl gang...gang gang. I'm not an expert on fabric but this feels like that rayon synthetic fabric, not polyester. It's super cute! Is it worth $40, tho?...Eh. I got the XL but I think a XXL would have fit better. But I wanted a more female bankai look, so i can make this work. The best part is the closure in the front. The velcro is hidden so when you close it, it looks just like the anime! not bulky at all or any tying needed. But that means it can come loose easier. I might sew a snap button for extra support but if you're not busty the velcro should work. It is tight for my wide linebacker back unfortunately. I can't hug myself comfortably. But I could lose about 5lbs and it should fit right LOL"
4.0,"I don't know why amazon is asking about shoes, when they are sunglasses. They look and fit great, but they are made of that cheap plastic; the same as glasses from the Dollar Tree. That doesn't stop me from wearing them, I simply put them in a glass case when I take them off. The green lens makes these glasses look more expensive."
4.0,I LIKE THEM
4.0,"Well made with nice, soft fabric. Gown is a little below knee with pretty trim at hem and sleeves. Think it runs on the smaller side. Bought a size 3 but might need a 4... we'll see."
4.0,"This is such a cute little dress for the price. Fits as expected & the colors are really vivid. I'm 5'7&#34;, 125 lbs, and ordered a small."
4.0,Very pleased w this bangle.  Seems well made. Well priced. Masculine look.<br />Latch seems to hold well. I've lost another w the same design.  We'll see.  Time will tell whether it stays on and remains good looking.
4.0,Poco elásticas
4.0,My wife likes the four wheels and the look of it. I don't like the amount of interior space lost to the extendable handle. The dimensions are perfect to carry-on.
4.0,for the wife and she loved them
4.0,My 11 year old loves it thanks
4.0,I've received several compliments about these lapel flowers.
4.0,"I got it for my wife and it is pretty good.<br />Usually most such dresses, the fit turns out not as expected, but it was just as good as the images in the listing.<br />The material is pretty good and it looks stunning."
4.0,My granddaughter  ask for it so I buy it she love it  so I send the package to her house  very  happy
4.0,"I normally wear a medium. In this I should have ordered a small,but I was worried about it being to clinging. The waist is what is too large. This tunic isn't long enough to be considered a dress on me. I'm 5'7.5&#34; a 150lbs. Waist is a 31&#34;. Hopefully this will help others when ordering."
4.0,"They are very elegant, but the gold color is not as vibrant as the image shows."
4.0,"Very lovely with my outfit,  it's for one time use but it's very lovely"
4.0,The bag is really fantastic in the locker itself. It's a bit bulkier than I'd like it to be when I'm biking and unfortunately a laptop doesn't fit anywhere in it (despite that bulk) so I still have to carry my messenger bag for work. It's really a great idea but I'd love space for a laptop somewhere. Minor quibble though.
4.0,a bit smaller than expected but otherwise good
4.0,"I got this dress in black for a funeral. It's beautiful, but the belt was missing the embellishment. Still my daughter loved it."
4.0,"This shirt is very classy, the material is not thick soo its good to wear on hot days and still look elegant... the only problem i had my arm fit a bit snug because i naturally have bigger arms but i am pleased i want to order 2 more.."
4.0,A little long. But fun to wear
4.0,"Fits well. The Michael Jordan is covered when you wear it though, no fault to the seller, just a poor design. If the Michael Jordan was centered it'd be more ideal but it works just fine"
4.0,"I use the lights for walking at night. They seem to last pretty long. I do notice on cold nights they seem to dim faster. Overall you can't beat the price, and im very happy with them."
4.0,"I was kinda iffy on this dress, as I am with a lot of stuff on amazon, but it actually turned out to be a very beautiful dress. I usually wear a small so I ordered a small, fit perfectly. Only thing is, the dress is super see thru, I had to wear a nude slip underneath. Other than that 👍🏽👍🏽"
4.0,Very pretty dress just to small i wish thy made 3x i would buy every dress good fabric nicely made
4.0,"I love this dress. However, I will be having it altered. Not due to design but due to my size and shape. I ordered a small and could use the skirt part brought in. Don't want to risk exchanging for an x-small and it be too small. I am 5'2&#34; 120lbs"
4.0,These are really stretchy and soft but they don’t offer very much support. The straps are adjustable so you can customize the fit but they are set far apart in the back and tend to slip off my shoulders even when the straps are made as tight as they can be adjusted.
4.0,"I was really happy with this dress, I bought 2 off Amazon for a wedding in case I didn’t like this one. It’s definitely a thicker material and would be better for fall or winter. The fit was flattering and I would recommend!"
4.0,Looks great and good quality but does shrink so be careful.
4.0,"I am a little disappointed with the fact that this is a cheap chain made belt. I was hoping it would be a more durable, heavier type of chain. Wears well but it is smaller than described. Okay with it over all."
4.0,Color is true to pic. Runs a bit small but does fit as size chart suggests. Is made of good quality.
4.0,looks good time will tell how it holds up
4.0,"I like the comfy fabric, weight, & color but runs a small & a bit short. I ordered XS and S would have been better. Im 5'2"" 105 lb. Would buy again in a S if they offered a scoop or v-neck."
4.0,"The kimono is very pretty, soft and silky. It is shown to be ankle length , but it truth it’s just below knee length."
4.0,Nice but ready hard to.zip up yourself.....<br />I couldn't zip up at all ...waist is too small it wont fit .
4.0,Well made and nice material for sleepwear not going out as I thought it was
4.0,This is a cute jacket and fits a tad big but ok. The 2t fit is much better than another rain jacket I ordered that was huge. He’s only worn it once so I can’t address durability.
4.0,I really should have gotten a large to be able to wrap myself comepletely in it. Very nice quality on the linen!!
4.0,I got red poop too! Very funny but I wish the poop was brown. I think this is either a female dog or the pup needs a colonoscopy bad! Ha Ha Ha!
4.0,"This is really cute, pretty and classy. My wife’s only complaint is it is a little hard to put on. So far, she’s had me do it every time. She said it is comfortable though and definitely dresses up your Apple Watch."
4.0,Pretty but not what I expected fits good
4.0,"It is a thin, basic dress but still cute. It is definitely a 4T size. Would be too big if you need 3T. Had to order it twice, though. The first time the bag was labeled 3T/4T but the dress inside was a 8/10T size. No biggie, though. Amazon makes exchanges quicker. Though, there is a second posting on Amazon for non-Prime shipping where this dress is $6 cheaper."
4.0,"Pro's<br />Looks classy.  Nobody realizes I'm wearing a fitness tracker (Steel HR) until I mention it is one.  It looks just like a regular watch.<br /><br />So far, it has been holding up to abuses by desks, chairs, etc and does not looked scratched up as some Stainless Steel or Titanium bands do.<br /><br />Easy install.  Hardest part was deciding which direction I wanted the clasp to close.<br /><br />Cons<br />I think it fits a little on the large side.  I pegged my wrist size right around 7&#34; and had to remove all but one removable-link.  The clasp would wrap awkwardly too far around the size of your wrist if you removed all of the available links.<br /><br />The clasp can be be improved.  If you just push it shut, it's likely that it will very quickly open up on you. The trick is to squeeze the releases as you are closing it to make sure it latches securely.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />It hasn't been an issue yet, but I always fear the metal band or clasp is going to scratch up the HR sensor surface when I'm not wearing the watch.  Again, it hasn't been an issue yet, but it plays out in my mind often.<br /><br />It might be cool to have the top link on each side of the band to be made of silicon or something stretchy.  Sometimes (weather/hydration/activity/etc) my wrist seems to be a little thicker than other times.  It would be nice to have the band remain snug (for the HR) but also be able to relieve some of pressure from those variations.  Not sure how well it would be implemented, but seems like an interesting concept."
4.0,"i got so many compliments on the bag! My only issue is that the middle zipper part keeps breaking, easily fixed but still."
4.0,I bought several of these for christmas present and everyone really liked them.  There's a dozen different versions to fit different personalities and it's a good price.
4.0,"Love this dress. fits great, true to size. great for the value."
4.0,"It's cute but as bright as the picture makes it to be.  Unless you're being interrogated and have a flashlight pointed directly at you, the necklace will never be as bright and easy to see as it's pictured.  The flower seems to look a little more closed in real life.  People will have to get right in front of you to see enough detail to know it's orchid-ish.<br /><br />The chain itself is fine, has a few different length selections.<br /><br />That being said, it's still cute and j did get it at a discounted price so I'm a happy camper."
4.0,Polishing cloth did a good job in making all my sterling jewelry sparkle & shine again cloths are much better than any dips or paste
4.0,"Seems to be good (but very lightweight) quality, it fits well. I only took a star off because the back is mesh instead of the reflective material. I added a photo since the listing doesn’t have pictures of the back. For the price I don’t think you’d get any better."
4.0,My son loves it. It's a little smaller the I thought. The ashes were hard to get in. Even with the funnel that was provided.
4.0,"Fits my industrial piercing and is easy to insert and remove, but the tip and &#34;feathers&#34; are too large. They don't look delicate or subtle."
4.0,Vest is very small. Pants we’re a good fit.
4.0,This is very cute and as expected but it runs small for sure and you can’t wear a bra bc you’ll see it in the back
4.0,Fast shipping arrived as described.
4.0,"I love the shorts, however, I ordered the XL and they are to big. I then ordered the L and they are way to small. They are the size of a med, I think this is a mistake on the label? I am 150 lbs, 5'4. I do love the shorts and style."
4.0,"I’m 5’3” 125lb. 32DD, ordered an XS and it fits like a glove! Perfect!!  The sipper its a little tricky but it can be worked with."
4.0,She really like this product
4.0,"Quality is nice, but slightly larger than it should be. I wear L size usually, but should change it into M size which fits nice."
4.0,"The only thing I don’t like is if you wear it too long, your finger turns green"
4.0,LOOKS REALLY NICE IN THE PICS - BUT WHEN YOU SEE IT UP CLOSE - ITS CHEAPLY MADE. THE ENDS ARE NOT HEMMED THEY ARE JUST SEWED WITH OVERLOCK STITCHING...  I WORE IT FOR A CUBAN THEMED PARTY SO IT DID THE JOB.
4.0,"the hoodie is soft and warm, perfect for those chilly mornings on the job site.<br />i would have gave 5 stars but the zipper is backward. it din't say this was a woman's<br />but other than the zipper it is great ."
4.0,"Pretty color, but the lace top was a lighter shade than the bottom.<br />Really need to have the perfect figure to wear it well."
4.0,I love the look in the photo unfortunately it does not fit that way on me. The buttons are for decoration and the shirt is not attached passed the 2nd button. On me it would gap open - not a look I care for so I put a couple of stitches in so it would not gap open and wear a tank underneath so my stomach doesn't show and now it's a nice look. :-)
4.0,Fit great but not the style I was looking for so returned it.
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable. I'm 135 lbs and 5'4.5"" and ordered a Medium based on reviews of similar items so the length worked well with flat shoes. Heels may have been too short. The sleek material does show underwear lines well. The elastic waist may be uncomfortable if you order too small a size. Waist could have used a matching cloth belt but I wore a copper belt with army green jumpsuit and looked great."
4.0,The design of these pants is lovely but they do run 2-2.5 sizes smaller than the label indicates.
4.0,"I bought the red one.  Nice light weight .  I really liked it.  You need to size up one to two sizes.  I'm shaped like a upside down pair.  So I believed  one size would just fit but if I wanted more loose two sizes up as I'm top heavy 40G.  I kept the jacket , liked it to much to send it back.  Probably give it to one of my daughters."
4.0,They are what they say they are. Think Ozzy Ozbourne sunglasses when you're looking at size.
4.0,"They fit and function fine, but mine came with two super blurry prints, both Scorpion. Maybe it's the stickler in me, but it's weird that three are crisp and detailed prints, but the other two aren't."
4.0,I returned this bc my poochy belly didn’t not look good in it-  if you have a flat stomach this will be perfect on you!
4.0,"Received my shorts today. I am 5’3” 186lbs (currently) and between a size 12/14 in bottoms. I ordered a size 12 after reading reviews saying that the shorts are stretchy and run big... the ones I ordered are NOT stretchy, but I would say they fit try to size based on their size chart. I was able to get them on, but my tummy looked like a busted can of biscuits. No worries though, I am continuing to lose weight after having Gastric Bypass surgery (only 6 months out) and believe I should be able to wear them comfortably after I lose at least another 10lbs... I hope lol. They are super cute though, and do have great thigh room."
4.0,Great material just runs really small.  SIze 1to 2 sizes up.
4.0,"These Footed Dance Tights are incredible and honestly, I do not want to take them off! In-fact, when I put these on – the princess in me wants to spin around and dance until my legs fall off! I really-really love them that much!<br /><br />I’m 5’6, and I weigh 130lbs - I ordered a M/L and they fit me like a second skin.<br /><br />The fabric is soft, my legs feel like silk and honestly – I could wear them all day long! The fabric is breathable, and the material seems to absorb sweat after a hard workout. They stay in place, and after multiple washings (hot or cold) the size hasn’t changed yet! Another wonderful thing; No elastic markings around the waist after wearing for long hours."
4.0,Very beautiful! My daughter wore this outfit for thanksgiving and it was a big hit! We got a lot of compliments. And the price is very affordable.
4.0,"I love this dress, except for the bottom, it looks really dumb and poorly made. But if you ignore that it's a great dress."
4.0,"Beautiful, elegant piece. Not sure how supportive these would be for ladies with larger bra sizes but it works for me. Very comfortable."
4.0,"My son is a huge john cena fan and he loves this, the shirt is a little big but he didn't seem to mind much and wears the hat and wristbands all the time"
4.0,OK for a daily work belt  But you can't wear this out for the evening if you're wearing brown shoes because it's so ORANGE.
4.0,No me agradó que son muy grandes pero son super cómodos
4.0,"These leggings are very comfortable (probably the most comfy I own) and feel very nice to the touch. However, do not be fooled. They are definitely see through and are very thin. They are about the consistency of tights. So if you are going to purchase make sure you have a long top to cover your bum. I am 5'5"" and around 180lb and a large fits very well."
4.0,"Really love the dress, material, and fit.  It definitely has a weird pleat in the front and back, but I'm hoping once I get it ironed and all it may fall better."
4.0,Pretty cool<br />I didn't know what to expect
4.0,Big enough to see quickly comfortable
4.0,These are lovely! Not the correct earring wires included or would give 5 stars. Sent silver colored and earrings are gold and green.
4.0,Its a good purchase I do which it came with extra ends.
4.0,"This is a fairly nice sweat shirt type of pullover, the sleeves seem short however. The sleeves are at the top of my wrist bone, about 2 inches from my wrist."
4.0,Very pretty and easy to change.
4.0,"This bra does fit comfortably, and the straps doesn't dig on my shoulders. But until they make larger cup sizes, I must return this bra. Not only did they make my boobs smaller, they made them look pointy and awkward. Do NOT buy if you have a large chest!"
4.0,"Wish it had a sturdy bottom to stand on its on, otherwise it is as pictured and described."
4.0,"Moosberry Reusable Cotton Face Masks (Adult (M)) - Pack of Two Blue Gingham. These masks, masks which we know we  should all be wearing in these fraught Covid19 days, are made of two layers of premium quality tightly knit 100% cotton. Their ties are adjustable, for a more comfortable  closer fit; they can be made into ear loops for quick on/off or shorter wear. Furthermore, the masks are contoured for  snug, more comfortable fit. They have side pocket for a replaceable filter ( not included). Labels are tacked on lightly and can be removed if desired. The masks are made with care in India ,a country where the population has familiarity in working with cotton. They are machine washable; should be washed before every use.  Adult (M) size: Width: 7.75 "". Height - 5.5"". These fabric masks are meant for general purpose only: for  reasons of hygiene, they are final sale.<br /><br />I like these because they can  tie at the back, rather than behind the ears. Because like many other older people, I must wear hearing aids, which are very pricey little items, and don’t mix well with anything else behind the ears.  And if you are also wearing glasses or sunglasses, forget it, that’s a coupla grand’s worth of gadgets falling right there. These tie-in-back masks are a better way. And they're attractive, while reasonably priced."
4.0,They slightly limit peripheral vision but not enough to be problematic
4.0,"I originally order this dress in the XL (perfect size for me 16w), I tried to change the size to XXL after rethinking other reviews, I am actually glad my attempt yo change the size failed, XL was a great fit. The sleeves are somewhat tight, but they work. A<br />A love the dress, the length is good, the skirt is very full but not over done. The colors are so what muted but rich."
4.0,Well made. Thin but not see through. The middle around my ribs was too tight so I had to return. The arms weren’t tight but the middle being too tight but it hard to move my arms.
4.0,It looks good i like it but its not the same color as the pic its same feature only different color... I got mine purple... I wanted a pink my favorite color.... But its okay it works!!!!
4.0,These rings seem to be good quality so far though they were smaller than I expected.
4.0,Nice undershirt outside of it being slightly larger than I would have liked. I will go a size smaller if I order these again.
4.0,Stylish flair coupled with great workmanship. Pleased with this product.
4.0,Very nice! Christmas present so we will see what she thinks.
4.0,Nice front pocket wallet.
4.0,Good material for the weather with a beautiful design.<br />I recommend
4.0,My 18 year old grandson loves tie bars. He is serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Mexico. His birthday is in February and I bought this for him. I am pleased with my purchase.
4.0,I love the designs and the quality of this products.  I will definitely recommend this face masks!
4.0,"I like the look very much, the only glitch is that they are a bit heavy, and they snagged my lacy part of the dress."
4.0,"Cute! but they are slightly pink, I had to return them because I was hoping for more of a nude and when they came in they were a very pale pink which did not go with the flower girl dress that was already picked out."
4.0,It does the job and it is lightweight.  My kids do not complain when wearing this mask and that's a good sign.  Other masks fall off their face or doesn't provide good coverage.
4.0,Love the strap. Good leather.
4.0,It was huge !!! My daughter was drowning in this leotard .... I had to return it . !!!!!! Get a smaller size
4.0,"Dress is beautiful but not for my body type.<br /><br />I'm 5'2, 155 lbs"
4.0,The colors are nowhere near as vibrant as the pics. Just regular primary color type.
4.0,"its definitely smaller than your regular size, i normally do a 16/18 or XL and im only 5ft the xl is tight but with jeans i worked it out, the 2xl slightly snug but cute, this time i did a 3x just so im more comfortable. i absolutely love it and own 4 of them. i have worn it with jeans, gymshoes and was able to dress it up with heals. you just have to know what works. if the 3x fits well, i plan o  wearing and dressing it up for my sons 8th grade graduation. ill make sure i post images."
4.0,I bought these for my son while he mows the lawn.  He likes them.  They keep things nice and quiet.
4.0,Bought these because I like the look. I switch 'em everyday depending on my outfit. A nice touch to my style. Offers a way to be creative.
4.0,"I liked this shirt a lot. It was subtle enough to wear to work without looking like I was wearing a costume, but it still got the point across."
4.0,"I think these are pretty great to have if you are an unorganized person as myself. I just wish I had more and smaller ones to keep the smaller things like socks and underwear organized. I love that I can fold and roll my items up and they fit just great! It helped me out a lot on this last trip, one was used for my sons clothes and I used the others for mine, it made it so much easier to access items after the bags were all packed. The cubes make it so you can put it in and out without causing a mess. I would recommend to those who don't already have a packing system down to a T!"
4.0,I read reviews that said this runs narrow and I wear a narrow. That works for me.
4.0,Size ran smaller then a extra large should. Nice loiking jacket though.
4.0,Elegant and good finished.
4.0,"If you're looking for feminine that captures curves without looking immodest, you've found the right choice. This dress has comfy material that hugs my body without being tight, and has good knee length. Collar is cute. Deep brick red color as advertised. Holds well after wash.. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because I haven't worn it more than trying it on to know the full feel."
4.0,Nice bra for the price will buy again
4.0,"They look good and I was pleased with them, until the first time I dropped them at the end of the first week I had them, and they broke. I'm not sure what they meant by &#34;shatterproof&#34; but they did not survive a normal drop from 5 ft to concrete."
4.0,"The hat definitely did what I needed it to however, the way the hat adjust is cheap & I have a small head so it fits wired on my head. I had a bunch made for my transfer day for my doctor's & nurses so they did what I needed them to do. Oh and they arrived before the date posted... which is a big plus for me."
4.0,This bad is really big and has held up well for the past few months that we have had it.  And it's really cute!
4.0,Broken on delivery
4.0,"Very pretty. But, very sheer. Definitely need to wear a tank under it."
4.0,"The blue and black frames seemed to have the blue light protection in them, though it's at most 60%. I really couldn't see any difference at in with the lenses in the clear frame"
4.0,"I bought this swim suit for my 6 yo daughter, I was expecting the skirt to be a bit longer. I was hoping it would touch her knees but it stops mid thigh. Other than that I love the colors, exactly as described and shown. One thing I disliked was that they strings on the sides were super long and would often become untied, my daughter ended up losing them daily quickly. By the way my daughter weighs 45 lbs and is a bit shorter and slimmer than most kids her age"
4.0,LOVE THE EARRINGS!!
4.0,Looks good and fits her really well. Is a little short. But she is pretty tall and long legged. The one down side is after she wore it several times some of the stitching started to come apart. So she just sewed it back to getter. Over all it's a good cheap dress for half a dozen to a dozen outings.
4.0,For the money they fit good and seem fine.
4.0,Came with a little scrtch
4.0,"I’m 5’7”, 170, and a 10/12 and the large fit well."
4.0,I love the style of these boots. They fit perfectly (I got size 7). My only issue is the in sole is hard. I went shopping and was on my feet for about 1½ hour and my feet were hurting (particularly the ball of my feet). Definitely need to buy an in sole cushion/support.
4.0,"This was such a comfortable shirt! Wore it to Universal and I was comfortable all day. I’m usually a medium in tops but went up to a large because I wanted a loose fit. It was just what I wanted. I will say that the a on “that” looks strange but it wasn’t super noticeable until I saw someone comment that. Doesn’t matter to me too much either way. Still gonna wear it, lol."
4.0,"Love this, very flattering just runs a little small and for us tall people ( I am 5.8) it is a little shorter then I would like."
4.0,Very pleased with this swimsuit for the price it was well worth it!
4.0,"Love this so much! Ordered up a size to XL based on reviews. I'm 5'5&#34; 170ish w/ long torso. Fit is perfect. Nice and long so no low back exposure when I lift my arms. Fabric is soft and stretchy and not too clingy if you get right size. This review is for the Navy. I liked it so much I got the black, but unfortunately that one seems cut slightly but annoyingly shorter. I still like it but the fit isn't as great. I may still get more colors, which is such a 'my mom' thing to do, but I really like the weight and comfort. Nice wide cowl that doesn't flop too low and show off the goods."
4.0,They fit me well and look good.  Had some problems with one of the back pockets or this would be 5 stars.
4.0,"This is a nice ring. Has a sort of heavy feel to it that I like, and looks a bit menacing, but not overwhelmingly so. Something that sucks a little is that the skulls aren't very visibly skulls"
4.0,I like the shirt! It's a little tight across the shoulders but otherwise great.
4.0,"Comfortable, loose fitting dress. More shaping on top depending on individual bra sizes and flows freely the rest of the way down through the skirt. Selected the purple and it is not see-through colorwise plus the extra fabric folds help conceal figure flaws."
4.0,Like but we have to see if they last good while
4.0,"I really like this shirt. It colors are bright, and it fits well."
4.0,"The product was great and having read the specs, I knew it was smaller than most adult beanies. I bought this for my almost 3-year old son (who has a huge head) for a Snoopy costume. It fit him great after flipping up the beanie an inch or so. THIS HAT WOULD BE TOO SMALL FOR A MAN, OR WOMEN WITH NORMAL HEAD SIZE. It really is a kid's hat I think, and should be labeled such."
4.0,They were def a lot smaller than I thought… like a lot smaller- it was abt the size of a penny. But super cute!!!
4.0,My loves it very much and started wearing it right away. It feels durable and looks well made
4.0,I liked this hat and mittens. My only criticism is the under the chin flap. It's a little cumbersome and irritated my three year old.
4.0,This is a beautiful bracelet! I wear it all the time and get lots of compliments on it! I rated it 4 stars because it sometimes twists but other than that it's really pretty on!
4.0,"Very comfortable shirt, nice fit.  The sleeve color was not what I expected.  They were a much lighter beige instead of a gold color."
4.0,its smal but is beutifull
4.0,Love it flattering
4.0,"Beautiful dress!  The color was rich and a decent quality.  I wasn’t a huge fan of the sleeves though,(personal preference)  Other than that it was a great dress for a great price."
4.0,"These bags are fine - a bit smaller than I had expected, but based on the price, it makes sense. They probably are best suited to load donated goods or for small shopping visits. Their durability is yet to be tested. If you are looking for a bag like this to use daily for yourself, you may want to seek one more or thick. I commend the vendor for encouraging these as good for donations."
4.0,"I ordered a Medium and it ended up being too big. Chest and Back was perfect size but way too big and long in bottom half of tank. I love the product and will end up ordering another set in Size small, nonetheless."
4.0,The quality is amazing! I have two other dresses and wear them in MN! They keep me warm and looking right in the office.
4.0,I only wore it for about 5 minutes but it’s cute and covers my ears. Hopefully it stays that way
4.0,Bought for my daughter. She loves the fit!
4.0,Nice necklace! Arrived quickly. Only reason it didn't get five stars is that it's too long for me. Will have to give it away and make someone else very happy.
4.0,"My son is obsessed with Minecraft so he was very excited to receive this mask. The colors and graphics are very bright and crispy clear. The material is soft and comfortable on my son’s face but a bit thinner than I would’ve liked, but I’m assuming that’s because it’s meant to be used with a filter. It’s a little big on my 4 year old and covers a lot of his face but at least the loops are adjustable so it helps give him a more secure fit. I would say it’s more suitable for older or bigger kids. Overall, it is a really fun quality mask and would recommend this to anyone with a kiddo or even a teen who is a Minecraft fan."
4.0,"I think this top is great! Mine looks like the pic and the color is spot on. I’ve bought it in three colors and they’re all wonderful. It runs BIG! I ordered a small and I still have to tie it tight as I can get it. Looks great, is very forgiving to the midsection and breathes well in this hot, humid Floridian weather. For sizing help, I am 5’8”, 163lbs, 34DD bra, 40” hips. I would say if you’re much smaller than this, you might want to pass. It would be a tent for you. It’s also long-torso friendly."
4.0,"This is a well made bangle, which looks very pretty but I wish it came in multiple sizes. The diameter of this bangle is more than 60mm. That means it is more like a large or XL size in bangles. I needed a small or an XS. This looked like it would fall off my wrist if I let my arm hang down. So even though I liked it I had to return it. This product is good value for money. It lost a star because of its lack of options in sizes."
4.0,The fast response was impressive. I must have misunderstood the packaging because I thought I was ordering 4 blue items not four  different patterned items I received. Other than that I am mostly satisfied.
4.0,Just as pictured and comfortable. Great for the wood worker in my life
4.0,Fast shipping. Nice quality.
4.0,"I got these as a gift for my wife and she thinks that they are great, but the elastic on the back of the heel starts rubbing after about an hour.<br />BOB"
4.0,Realistic looking. Soreness the day after wearing but it goes away. Not as painful as the real thing for sure.
4.0,"I love these yoga pants, they are so comfortable and pass the squat test and are not see through. My only dislike is that they are a little long so they bunch at the end. I am 5'4 and got a M. My normal pant size is 6/8. I got the purple leggings and they are such a pretty color. Definitely excited to use these in my yoga classes!"
4.0,Comfortable crop tops. Good cotton quality. True to color fabrics. Great for the gym. It’s like weightless on you. Very sharp looking. I want more in other colors.
4.0,Nice cuffs. I bought two.  My only issue they kept catching on everything. So be warned of that. Other than hey they were perfect.
4.0,"Tried on, then washed.  It shrank, but it fits just right now.  However, the trim on the cuffs is not equal, the left side is larger than the right (did not notice before washing).  Not enough to make me return it , but enough to dock a star.<br />Very comfortable..not as soft as VCS Portuguese flannel but also not wrinkled after washing...(shouldn't have to iron a robe.)<br />Overall very please for the price super comfortable, has sufficient fabric on the lower half without upper half having too much and great pockets"
4.0,Really cute gift idea
4.0,"Overall worth the price. The material is strange, it's not silky, it's not cotton. It's got a soft burlap feel imo. The head hole is small. Other than that the print is perfect and no rips or tares. It's definitely cut for boys but girls can still wear without issue. It doesn't have much stretch or give to it at all. I ordered larger than normal and it fits well."
4.0,"Compared to a ""turtle"" fleece this is very thin.<br />Surprisingly warm though.<br />I was looking for something to wear around my head when a hat was too warm and it's perfect for me.<br />Would have given 5 stars but they say it's reversible and yet there is a huge tag on the black side."
4.0,"Everyone always tells you to order a size bigger for these chinese products, this is not the time to listen. I ordered a small, which turned out to be a size 4, and it was too big. I usually wear a 4 with brands like H&M and American Eagle, but this coat was definitely too big on me. Overall good quality and beautiful coat, would order again."
4.0,No dislikes really liked a little necklace I think it be perfect for my granddaughter for Christmas very pretty
4.0,Zipper is hard to close when putting on I can zip it of but can't zip it on. I just slipped the short on
4.0,Beautiful/ expect see through ladies
4.0,"Good quality, excellent packaging. excellent gift box, and very good price. Just one concern which is the luster is not good for AAA quality, I was expecting more, otherwise, it would deserve the 5 stars."
4.0,Squat proof and no visible sweat marks!
4.0,"Pros: good construction, variety of colors available, lightweight, flattering cut<br />Cons: not tag-less, collar a bit too wide<br /><br />As I need to replace older base-layer shirts, I'll definitely check the price on these first."
4.0,"Socks came on time and in good condition. With that being said, if you have a wider foot like me, these socks might be too tight for you.<br />They scrunch your toes together and it’s a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Also, if you have large calves ( mine are 19”) you won’t be able to pull these over them. They are well made socks though, and they are thin too, so if your used to your shoes fitting tight with regular socks then these will seem loose.<br />I intend to wear these socks, but only for short periods of time. I do recommend these socks IF your feet and calves are of normal size though."
4.0,They look exactly like the photo. I bought them as a gift for my daughter. The occasion hasn't arrived yet so they haven't been used. They look and feel great. If anything changes after she uses them I will post an update
4.0,"This is super cool.  Only gave it a 4 star because the construction of it makes it a little flimsy, but it really does look like the Grimm key and that makes it a wonderful collectible for the price."
4.0,I love the shirt it fits ok for a large but it's too close on me if you don't like your shirt fits too close on you get 1 size up it has a cuff sleeve I uncuff my sleeve with the scissors the large that I bought am just going to sleep in it or wear it around the house I ordered another size in XL I love the shirt so I didn't want to send it back
4.0,"I purchased this set for my rook piercing on one ear and my daith piercing on the other. I like that they have a hinge because they are way easier for me to change them out without help (I usually have to go to a piercing shop to have them do it with other styles of jewelry). I’ve been using the larger one in my daith, and it feels a tad too large but still looks nice. I use the middle size one for my rook. My issue is the middle one gets caught on pillows/blankets at night. The first time it happened it yanked it out of my ear. It’s been about a month now and I just got used to them so it doesn’t happen as often. Otherwise, it’s a great set for ear cartilage piercings!"
4.0,"If you are a dork, or a stud, or anything in between. Super fun, super cool, a must have for next to nothing. Get these shades. They offer other colors too..."
4.0,"Bag is nice and light, just as expected."
4.0,I like the look and the fit otherwise but it does run a bit on the small size. It looks nice.
4.0,Not too fond of the earrings; wearing them together looks too predictable.... I wore it with a crisp white button down shirt with the collar opened and some blue jeans! It was a great addition to the outfit!
4.0,Its cute and looks better than pics. Haven’t used it yet.. will upload a pic once I do.
4.0,Thank you for having a belt with options to tighten as &#60; 1 inch.  My husband's back no longer hurts from his belt...and his pants stay up!
4.0,Thank you exactly as described now for details on putting the scarf in the loops correctly would be helpful!<br /><br />I love it
4.0,Very pretty. My Granddaughter loves it.
4.0,"First off -- the pictures of the wallet for sale vary depending on color choice - what you see with a color selected is what you are getting. So while all colors are listed as applying to the same wallet, the various pictures show differences that seem to apply.  If one feature, such as a zipped pocket, matters to you, buy only a color which shows it.<br /><br />Second - any wallet could be  described as a 'front-pocket' wallet if the owner chooses to carry it there,  but to me, a front-pocket wallet means one sized and shaped to fit that space. This model is a regular wallet. Put it in your front pocket if you want but size-wise this wallet is slightly larger than a regular one you likely carry already in your rear pocket.<br /><br />That all said - for the price, this is a nice wallet with ample room. The slots are wide so cards slide in easily but not loosely. There are two picture pockets, one a flip out, for ID and license cards which I find useful. An earlier review indicated the plastic covers were opaque, which the company then claimed to have addressed, but mine were opaque still, and would require removal of card to anyone checking (but then, at airports etc I have to always remove the card anyway). Bills easily fit with room to spare, so you can see this is not a compact design but a roomy one. There are a couple of SD card slots too, which I suppose could be useful but I've never carried them in my wallet.<br /><br />The finished product is a little rough to my eyes, the fold does not have the two edges lining up perfectly but the leather is soft and comfortable to handle. How it wears is yet to be determined but so far, so good."
4.0,"my son loves this shirt!! seems to run a little bit, really long"
4.0,nice watch  not super bright however
4.0,"Very snug fit, and keep my husband warm!"
4.0,Color was a little off but not bad.
4.0,Fabric is really soft
4.0,"LOVE this dress! I was a bit nervous buying this dress but I’m glad I did. I got orange/red color and it’s very nice and flowy. It fits true to size and wasn’t see thru. It is made a little cheep as the threads/stitching popping in many places and I don’t unbutton it for fear I might lose buttons if I do it too often, hence I put it on and take it off over my head.<br />Overall, no regrets! I’d get it in a different color if I could make up my mind which one! Lol"
4.0,It was given as a Christmas present to a needy child.
4.0,"Cute shorts. I’ve recently gained a little weight and wanted shorts to wear to a concert, but didn’t want typical itty-bitty coochie cutters. (I’m not 22 Lol) These fit cute. I ordered a size up because I didn’t want them to be too tight. They fit great. Short, but not obscene. I’m wearing them w/ fishnets, a long top, and a pair of booties. But if I were more comfortable with my thighs I totally could wear these on any given day. Nice fit, cute design."
4.0,Beautiful dress... fit like a glove
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f0dd030ce6da9bf53ca7e1c53c3dab3b]] It similar to the picture but, not as glamorous. It fit me well when I sized up 2 sizes and it was still tight on my arms, which is my problem area. I had to adjust that. Doesn't come with a hoop skirt. The dress delivered in time with care. Otherwise I'm happy with it."
4.0,"So thick that it makes it difficult to use the “touch screen compatible” feature of the finger tips. I live in Minnesota and these only keep my fingers warm to about 15-20° (above 0) for roughly 25 minutes. A little disappointed they don’t live up to their claims of keeping you warm to -30°, but they are still better than some other gloves I’ve owned. Especially good for the price."
4.0,"Super shoe and speed of delivery. Red accents looked a little more magenta in person. My son didn't care, so we happily kept them."
4.0,"I use for bicycling daily.  At this price, I bought several pair so I can rotate in the wash.  They seem to machine wash fine.  Center fingers have handy little pockets on the palm side to aid removal.  Padding is not as thick as gloves costing 3x more, but cushioning is adequate.  Overall a great value."
4.0,dress fits more like a medium than a small. cute dress.
4.0,"Great product and price, will buy again."
4.0,"Cute, but runs tiny! Size up."
4.0,Slim fit. I like them.
4.0,I love this wrap!  It looks great with my black bathing suit!  I have gotten so many complements about this wrap.
4.0,A little smaller than I would like but it was on time and I like it
4.0,"They fit great and was long enough, Thank you"
4.0,Loved the dress. The top was just a little too big and loose for me.
4.0,"I bought mine in white, for night gown and in white its slightly sheer"
4.0,"Great PJs! Being 5'10"" they do come above my ankle but they are super comfy and relaxed fit.draw string on waist and cute :)"
4.0,"I did not give this brand a five-star rating as it was difficult to get on at first After washing, it became more manageable. Ther overall quality is very good and has held up under numerous use. The compression I order was a bit much but okay for interim use with regular socks."
4.0,I purchased these for a second piercing that I have in my ears and I wanted it to be small and not too ostentatious. Perfect I've had lots of compliments. The look is perfect the quality is above expectations for the price.
4.0,"Very light weight, which is a plus. Great length, with a little movement."
4.0,"The fit is true to size but the color is very bright, not heather as shown in the picture"
4.0,This dress is the bomb. Can't wait to wear it somewhere!
4.0,Love the bracelet. Be careful if you have smaller wrists like I do. I have it on the smallest link and it still slips off my wrist.
4.0,The earrings are good quality for the price but are way bigger than I had anticipated.
4.0,"You get what you pay for. I bought this for a school play. From the audience, the hat looked just fine. Of course, it's a 10.00 hat. Up close, that fact is obvious. Worth the money for our purpose."
4.0,Ordered the 3x praying all my boobs fit. I normally wear a (3x-22-44) I purchased this to wear as a beach cover up. It's a bit thick but I think it will work.
4.0,"Utility, color"
4.0,Very good quality and fit...
4.0,"These pajama pants run large, and long! I ordered 14/16 and I think they came in men’s small. But they are good quality, comfort and colors match great."
4.0,Really nice fit and perfect workout top for cold winter days
4.0,"Run's small. Very cute, the price was far for the quality, the important thing was receiving it in a day, perfect."
4.0,This dress was perfect for my fiesta party! I received many compliments on dress. The material is thin so be careful when ironing. I am 5'4 150#s and the fit is perfect!
4.0,Adorable and I love the color silver gray
4.0,"It is a great short sleeve top, but way too big. I cut it down to size. Otherwise, it is fun to wear with asymmetrical hem. Launders well."
4.0,"it came earlier than i was told. I ordered it for a protective mask.I like the idea of an inside pocket for filter which most "" Gaitor"" bandanas dont have. The color is a really nice olive green. Great fabric. Its just was just too big for me to be snug and not slide down. Perfect for my husband. He loves it so its a keeper."
4.0,"I was a tad bit disappointed that this ring only came in a little sealed baggie, but I had a ring box from a ring I ordered for myself lol. The ring is beautiful, but there was some black gunk on it when it arrived. I managed to scratch most of it off, but some stayed on the &#34;Mom&#34; part. I chose this Mom ring over one with cubic zirconia because its simplicity makes it beautiful. I know my mom will love this!"
4.0,"Very cute, but they are a little long. I have smaller ears I guess. I’ll just trim them a bit. Other than that i like all of them."
4.0,"These slippers are adorable (and comfortable according to my 3yr old), however the pink fur inside sheds.  If worn without socks, my daughter's feet get fur all over them.  I did not wash them before she wore them though, so maybe that would help.?  There was a cute little reindeer journal included in the package which was a nice surprise."
4.0,"The belts work great for my finicky kids. The only problem is they are not nearly as big as implied in the description. They are actually only about 22 inches at max. They have some elasticity to them so they can stretch out, but that's not really going to be comfortable for the kids."
4.0,"I was worried the color would be a bit off, but the band matched the watch perfectly. I had totake out a few links. They sent a tool to help take the links out."
4.0,"4 pieces were not usable because they were a company logo and some random team. Another 6 were not usable because of uneven coloring or casting flaws. If I use this type of charm again, I may look for other options."
4.0,"Adorable! Looks great on, my daughter loved it the moment she opened the package. Only downside is that the interior skirt of the tutu is really short and I can see her diaper hang out of the skirts coverage. The tutu is precious but I’ll need to buy her some Lycra shorts or bloomers to wear underneath"
4.0,I love this dress. It's nice to wear and looks great! I only gave 4 stars because sizing seems to run a little small. I'm 5&#34;10 and 140 lbs and I ordered an XL and it hits me just at the knee. Definitely getting another!
4.0,"The tail is very fluffy and the ears are good, but smaller than I thought they would be, I am not sure that they show up well."
4.0,Great base covers!
4.0,"My wife normally wears an XL, so we went with XXL to make sure it would fit. However, it was still a bit too tight in the chest. My wife is a D to DD. So if you are a large breasted woman, you may want to steer clear. She can technically close the buttons, but they will pop open if she moves in the slightest. Otherwise, she loves it. I just wish it fit her a little better."
4.0,My daughter hung her favorite ball cap from a hot lightbulb and melted the plastic snap back.  Bought these to replace.  Instructions say you can see or hot glue.  I cannot imagine hot glue holding up.  I have a basic sewing machine and struggled to sew through the thickness of the plastic and multiple layers of fabric.  If I had to do it again I wouldve taken it to a shoe repair or alterations shop.  Their machine would’ve made quick work of it.
4.0,a gift for a loved one.  he really liked it.
4.0,"These do work well however I work 12 hour shifts. After maybe 8 hours they start to hurt at the top, right below the knee. I usually have to go push them down. Maybe I'm just weird."
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted, and expected.  It is slouchy, and soft, and the color is just as it was depicted.<br />I do want other potential buyers to be aware that there are beads and the ends of the laces, on each end of this bag, and they do clink and clap together when you're walking.  My co-workers joke about the noise I make when I walk by.  But, if this wouldn't bother you, this is a great purse."
4.0,Nice great gift for women/girls
4.0,"Arrived quickly,  Good quality"
4.0,It fits true to size I wear large tight fitted shirts so I bought a large and perfect fit! The material is soft silky on the inside so it is comfortable! Flares out a little but not too much I'm excited to wear this as a bridesmaid at my besties wedding!!
4.0,"4 stars because it's adorable and a great price.  But definitely size up! My son is 4 months old and we got the 6-9 month (size 80) and it won't fit him for long! Very snug, especially if you use cloth diapers!"
4.0,I used these while installing a water heater and had to do quite a bit of soldering including adding a brass shut off valve which took quite a bit of heat to solder.  I could feel the warmth through the gloves but the job was still manageable. Recommended.
4.0,I ordered a medium but it fit like a large. After having alterations done it fits perfect.
4.0,Love the sweater but the sleeves were short even after going up a size. Super comfy!
4.0,"These goggles worked fine, especially for the price. If you push on them toward your face when they are are it creates suction to keep them in place. I did too much once and it was uncomfortable so it doesn’t need a lot. Clear but dip them in the pool first to prevent fogging. I recommend."
4.0,A little vthin but on they're not see through.
4.0,My son thinks they are cool he just doesn’t like the ear loops and they are a bit big for his ears. I love them bc they had the pocket filters which makes me feel better considering gaiters aren’t the best protection.
4.0,"A little thin, but I love it! So comfy!"
4.0,The thigh/butt area is tight while the waistline has inches of extra space. This jean was not designed for ladies with an hourglass or triangle figure but should be quite flattering and stylish for other body types
4.0,"Runs a tad small. Also, it is sheer for the most part, and the slit is pretty high-cut, this is definitely more of a beach cover-up than going out, though I think some one with the right style could pull it off with shorts  or even heels at at beach resort. Very comfy. Make sure to wash according to directions. I chose to air-dry mine."
4.0,Size seems to run a little smaller..
4.0,Gives great coverage for extra long braids. My only gripe is that the bad is a little too thick & will stress your hair line.
4.0,"Very nice shirt, material is thick with a stretchy feel. I purchased a small (wear a small) and it fits but I could have sized up. When I washed I air dried."
4.0,"Mask came in a relatively quick manner. It looks decently made with my only gripe about the quality being that one of the antennas has an unusual blob of adhesive at its base. The mask is unexpectedly big, but not too comically large in proportion to my body. By itself, it's a little hard to see out of the eye slits, but I've countered this by wearing a beanie underneath the mask, adding more support inside.<br /><br />As another review here suggests, I intend to use this in a Hotline Miami-themed cosplay. The eerily realistic features of the mask plays well to my intentions for my costume. I highly recommend this to any Hotline Miami fan out there, or if anyone needs a subtly creepy mask in general."
4.0,"This necklace was very nice for the price, but it is very small and the engravings are difficult to see."
4.0,"Runs small size up, super cute and comfortable"
4.0,"The burgundy is more like a rust, but it’s a very nice, warm and comfortable sweater."
4.0,Great quality much more attractive in person. It's also quite large. Docked a star for no key for small pocket on front which makes it completely unusable :-/
4.0,👍 for work
4.0,"This is a beautiful purse but was, unfortunately, much too big for me. Would love it if it were smaller. Check the measurements before ordering."
4.0,"I love the color and quality! I also like l that it is leather and not rubber so that it breathes better. It is a standard watch band width which is fine, but I prefer a slightly thinner band because I have a bad thumb and the wider band seems to put pressure on this area. But overall I am very pleased with the watch band. Thank you!"
4.0,Worked really well but runs small. Bought a xl and it fits like a medium
4.0,4 stars
4.0,"Fits well - but if you have thick, large diameter lens, the clips may be too small. My prescription is for minor correction so the clips are okay."
4.0,"I ordered these and they are fine.  They fit good, but the material is a little thin.  Guess that's okay for the summertime."
4.0,"Beautiful, but the fit is a bit on the small side. The fabric is very stretchy though-- like swimsuit spandex-- so it was fine on my curvy hips, though a lot clingier than expected."
4.0,very comfy .it says fashion so i  wear it just for dress. I like them for the price. IF you want pro boots pay the price
4.0,"I purchased these pants because they appeared similar to my favourite pair of pants that are starting to show wear. They pretty much ticked off all check boxes: long pants (past my ankle but not too long that I would have to roll them up), and just a perfect fit around my hip. These pants, however, fall short on the fact that it does not match its Amazon pictures.<br /><br />The pants I got were flare pants. I would've blamed it on the fact that I am skinny, but then it wouldn't have made any sense since there was just *that* much space between my leg and the pants. I was honestly kind of surprised. I ended up rechecking the pictures and, in my opinion, the pants in the pictures look like skinny pants. If not skinny, then at least ""normal"", non flare, pants. Perhaps I got some weird stock, but I wasn't too impressed with what I had received.<br /><br />Everything else was great though, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. It fit perfect around my waist, the length was just as described, and the sizes listed matched. My only gripe, again, was the unexpected flare bottoms."
4.0,great beach bag.  on the large side so great for towels and everything else.
4.0,Cute socks! My son loves interesting socks and he LOVED these!
4.0,Nice dress for the money and comfortable
4.0,Comfortable and well made sweatshirt.
4.0,Perfect for the pouring rain
4.0,"At the time I bought this yoga pant, I wore 18W in pants, so I bought XXL size. It was tight fitting and long in length, coming up to my mid belly. When I did yoga I found the portion that covers my belly would roll off and frequently I would have to pull up my pants. Even with this problem, it still was effective of soaking up sweat and made working out easier with the extra flexibility. I was able to loose 30 pounds with these pants! You should buy with caution that it's a tight fitting pant."
4.0,"Very comfortable, fit great. Only issue is, due to the material they are made of, they are hot, which is probably great up north but not in Texas🤪"
4.0,I really like it no complaints.
4.0,"I really like this dress, but it does run pretty small.  I&#34;m 5ft, 130lbs.  The length is perfect for me--just above the knee.  I'll be sending this back for a larger size."
4.0,The legging is cute but the color blue is grey.<br />The only thing bad.
4.0,"Very vibrant colors, form fitting, lovely design! Unfortunately it fit tighter than I'd like. Ordered a large accord to size chart but reordered a xxl as I want it to flow more at bottom. I'm 5.6 usually a 10/12 depending on brand. LG prob would wk for someone with smaller waist. Maybe 26-28"
4.0,"165lb, 5’6”, I ordered a medium based on the customer reviews rather than the sizing chart and it fit wonderfully. I originally ordered one in a light pink and a lilac and those turned out to be quite sheer.<br /><br />The fabric is quite rough/itchy and each one ordered has a slight imperfection around where the zipper is sewn, a small snag or a gathering, but it is minimal and I’ve decided to keep the dress. It is form flattering on a pear shape and the neckline is appropriate for a regular bra.<br /><br />All in all, excellent quality for the price."
4.0,The 2 XL is what I wear but this top runs a little on the small size. I would have returned it but this is the largest size. It's a beautiful top so I kept it and just dealt with it being a little tight
4.0,Happy with what I got. It was packaged well. Perfect size for my tiny ears.
4.0,The size of These slippers run a bit small otherwise they are great slippers. My 8 year old daughter loves them
4.0,I have received a lot of compliments on how cute these shoes were. Great product to slip on infant for when you aren't having them walk outside
4.0,Great bag for travelling.  Looks just like the picture.
4.0,Comfy cotton hoody. Good price.
4.0,I like the color and style. The fit is a little to be desired.
4.0,"Muy lindo, pero lo único es q la pulsera es muy pequeña..."
4.0,"exactly like the picture, very thin but not see through material. highly recommend just runs slightly big. I’m 34DD and a medium was slightly too big."
4.0,Love the dress!!! Fits perfectly and would highly recommend. The only bad thing is if you have small boobs expect there to be extra fabric on the chest. The heart neckline was higher than I would have liked it to be.
4.0,"I have started wearing these under my mittens or gloves when I walk my dogs. I have to pull off my mitten to pick up after the dog and these keep my hand warm while allowing my fingers free to fuss with a bag. My only problem is that the thumb hole is too small for my large hands and pinches. I had to cut it and restitch it for my comfort. Otherwise they are very soft, warm and comfortable. Update -  these are holding up very well to hard usage and I have bought several additional orders for friends.  Those with slender hands they fit perfectly.  One of them said the slight pressure from them makes her arthritis feel better and she wears them 24/7."
4.0,The gloves developed a small rip in them as soon as I tried them on.
4.0,"I like this a lot! The circles were not stretched out, they are pretty clear. The color of the gold is not as bright as it could be, it's more bronze-ish. It's still pretty though and matches all my gold accessories!"
4.0,"I hope till end of September my son  feet will stay same size, because this shoes runs 1 size smaller"
4.0,legs are a little long
4.0,"My wife liked the first Bewell wood watch I got her, she wanted another one with a darker look."
4.0,This dress can either be dressed up or dressed down. The material is great. I always dress it up with a blazer.
4.0,Soft and comfortable to wear looks very nice with a nice pair of jeans. Has a good amount of stretch to it also. I ordered that my regular size and it did fit perfectly. Not sure what type of material is used more than likely a mixture of cotton and polyester but it doesn't maintain too much body heat at all especially during the summer time. The material is very breathable.
4.0,Ordered Small/Medium and got Medium. They were too big for wifey.
4.0,They were pretty but much smaller than I expected.
4.0,Fits my small face and my husband's larger one and prevents our glasses from fogging up from warn.  The carbon filters included will help during fire season.
4.0,"I received these gloves for Christmas and they are truly great; they are surprisingly warm and do work on touch screens. I still use these gloves, but I have noticed that they become highly sensitive to touch screen usage after a few months. The wool keeps hands warm, but makes the outside of the glove very fuzzy and can be picked up by my phone's touch screen. It can be bothersome when trying to unlock my screen to have the wool flyaways be picked up instead of my actual touch path.. Everything else about these gloves are worth the buy."
4.0,Robe great value for price. Slippers worthless I threw them away.
4.0,The color is different. This is olive. I got a lime green one.
4.0,Nice purse. Could use more pockets inside and out.
4.0,I generally buy my dresses a few sizes larger because I like really over-sized dresses.  This dress fits almost snug. Would have liked it a little more over-sized.  Not a bad dress.  Comfortable fit and soft material. Not bad for the price.
4.0,This is the only 23mm nato for my Luminox so that is great they make a 23mm. The retaining strap had two buckles for some reason and I cut one off. I like it better with one. It has plenty of adjustment and would fin any one.
4.0,"These shirts seem to run a bit large. I normally wear a small/medium and ordered a small, but it's still quite roomy on me. If you're looking for a more snug fit, I would recommend going a size down. The material is good quality, although the shirt does feel a bit stiff on the first wear. I like to roll up the sleeves, although there is no cuff on these shirts. The sleeves are a tad tight, but not as much as other button-down shirts I've worn. Overall, a well-made shirt that can be dressed up or down."
4.0,Somewhat small in the crouch area
4.0,"adjusting it in a little bit of a pain in the ass, but after figuring out that the clamp underneath kept catching on the fabric of the suspenders, it works  better."
4.0,These are small about the size of a quarter but nicely made sturdy
4.0,"I'm a 32 C and I ordered 2 (incase a friend needs to borrow one) I got a small and an medium. The small one fits better for me than the medium. The medium one felt more like a sports bra than an binder, I just wish the small was a litter more smaller so it makes my chest completely flat but the small works good"
4.0,Very nice hat that I bought for my wife. Only drawback is that it is tight on her head.
4.0,"This garment was well packaged and arrived on time both times I ordered.  I am 5 feet tall with a 33 inch waist.  I do not waist train or have any experience with any kind of body contouring. Mid-thirties added a bit of chub around the middle so, I was really excited to try this whole craze out.  The size chart instructed me to order a 3X.  I was sent a 4X (my mistake).  I tried it on and it was so huge I returned and re-ordered a 2X. Two sizes smaller thinking that this would be sufficient, I was even worried that I made another mistake.  I read that I should take my time and wear the vest on the widest hooks and for as long as I could stand. I was prepared to suffer, I wore it for the first time today thinking I would feel like hell.  After 20 mins on the widest setting I quickly moved it over the narrowest.  I just took it off after 11 hours of barbecuing and hosting a party.  I wore a tank underneath and it was wet with sweat.  Other than that, I didn't feel very restricted all day.  It was surprisingly comfortable.  The corset is a comfortable length. I did some exercises at the end of my day in the trainer to avoid muscle atrophy as many reviewers suggest.  I wish that I had gotten an even smaller size.  Though I enjoyed the posture support and I was able to comfortably go about my day, I really wanted the opportunity to train to a narrower size.  I will definitely use this garment to weight train, it is well made and looks like it will stand the test of a hard workout.  If I could undo the hours I already wore the trainer, Id definitely return for a smaller size."
4.0,I love the new bag! It's light and fit my tablet and other essential items.
4.0,Fits much smaller than expected but still worked.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for! I can wear them, but I have small wrists. They are more for children than adults and not sure if it's mentioned anywhere about the size."
4.0,I honestly love this pant  It's just that my waist is not large making it large a little. But I love the design and style.
4.0,Everything was great it arrived on time no complaints will definitely order from this site again
4.0,"This is a beautiful ensemble but the top fits me perfectly and the bottom is HUGE. Going to go get it altered, but it's still a bit odd"
4.0,"Kinda tight bracelet, but it's ok"
4.0,Fits great!  Customizable in case you want to make it bigger/larger.  Took a bit of tinkering to understand how to take out the pins and adjust the band but I'm pleasantly surprised at how good this item is!<br /><br />After almost a year the link connecting the assembly to the square holding the blaze broke.  I ordered a new one but I received a different tool to remove the pins and either I lost one of the parts or it didn't come in the package.  The square tool is the best one to fix the length.
4.0,This is just as expected.  Thanks!
4.0,The front zipper is hard to Unzip when the bag is full. Good size and quality material.
4.0,These colors are magnificent together making this a beautiful piece. Received tons of compliments when I wore it. Would have given it a 5 but some of the acrylic pieces in mine where scratched.
4.0,Only got 4 stars because the elastic in the waistline gets all twisted up in the washer
4.0,Fit as expected. Only downside is toes are scuffed up within a few wears. Not quite as durable as I hoped but my daughter loves them.
4.0,"it is a good sun glass for the money & looks and feel expensive  ,well worth"
4.0,"Good every day belt ,I use it for work days. Had it for about 3-4 months seems to hold pretty good."
4.0,"The wallet is perfect for what it is. My only issue is that I ordered red, but it is definitely hot pink."
4.0,"Fit was great, style good, wish it was softer but overall liked it!"
4.0,"I love the corset and jacket! Initially I ordered a large, which is my typical size, and it was way too small. I ended up having to order a 2XL and it fits for the most part. However, my bust is a bit too small for the 2XL. Even so, it's still super cute."
4.0,I ordered these a size larger than usual and they fit perfectly.
4.0,"I fell in love with this jumpsuit when first seeing it...I knew I had to have it to wear to one of my college homecoming events!  So, I ended up purchasing and I was very happy that I did.  The quality you receive for the price cannot be beat.  You can certainly add this piece to your closet as one that will last a long time.  I love the wide legs also.  This is a piece that can be dressed up or down.  My only two complaints are that you cannot adjust the straps and they fall off the shoulders quite a bit when wearing.  It was a bit of a hassle having to pull them back up when dancing all night.  Also, PLEASE NOTE that this jumpsuit runs small.  I usually wear a 6/medium and ordered the 8/Large based on prior customer reviews, and the bottom half fit perfectly.  Other than that, I would recommend."
4.0,Nice product for the price and high quality. I am very satisfied with my earrings.
4.0,"These run a bit short compared to major brand socks.  I like them, but just a little short for my Mens size 10 feet."
4.0,Good looking but not practical
4.0,Can’t beat the price! Slightly sheer when hit with backlighting but it’s a Summer dress... it’s not meant to be super thick and structured. I love how light weight it is! I took it on vacation and I was able to wear it to the pool over my suit and to a nice dinner. It dresses up or down really well.
4.0,"This shirt runs small, as does everything from this seller. Surely order a size up if you want a more relaxed fit. Had to double knot the strings as they kept coming out of the holes and weren't holding in my chest."
4.0,Great quality but unless you are very very big you will have to restring them as the entire bracelet is very large on a normal wrist.
4.0,The boots are great. They are vuilt pretty sturdily and are strong enough to survive a couple pallets falling on them. Pretty waterproof too. Though if your out in the cold for long periods of time i would get some thick wool socks as well cause the insulation is decent but could be better.
4.0,Very cute for a father of 2 on Father's Day :)
4.0,"I like the boots but the first pair, one size smaller as recommended, were way too small, my feet were cramping.  I then ordered my regular size and they were way too big.  So I order a half size smaller, hopefully those will work - they have not yet arrived."
4.0,very small ((
4.0,"These are excellent, however they tend to ride down. I still love them though and will continue to wear them. I'm 5' 7 and 150 lbs, so us curvy ladies can rock these!!"
4.0,"Love this sweater, wear it all the time"
4.0,"Price was right. Arrived next day. Item was as described, fit well.  Now need to use it..that's why only 4 stars."
4.0,This was a little large for me around the middle area and crotch--I had to wear a belt and eventually got it altered.
4.0,"Bought this with a coupon code, so did not pay full price.  Had been curious about a magnetic belt, so figured why not.  All in all, its a solid belt, magnet works great, easy to fasten and unfasten once I got the hang of it.  Looks pretty sharp, and the materials are durable.<br /><br />Down sides were that the belt seems to slip out of adjustment a lot (although that could be perception) and it's just a wee bit too big for the belt loops on the shorts I wear it, so moving it between pants is kind of a pain, especially since the actual buckle tends to get snagged on the loops, making it pretty tedious.  So, perhaps if the belt were a little narrower, it would be perfect.<br /><br />Still, it's a decent belt, and it will likely last for a very long time, so...hey, 4 stars!"
4.0,"Except for the fit around the ankle, everything is good."
4.0,"The material was very nice and pretty, I loved the asymmetrical skirt but damn is it short! I'm not afraid to show a bit of leg (and some butt on occasion) but that short part is shooort. Still cute though, still love it."
4.0,"I have a big bust 38DD, and the large fit me just fine. I felt comfortable and most importantly I felt good in it. I was glad I got it."
4.0,"Too tall for me,  fits over ears. Well made and heavier than I expected."
4.0,It arrived VERY promptly. The quality  was great. Unfortunately I had to return it because the waist was too high. I order a lot from the internet and have never had this problem so it tells me that this manufacturer measures short in the waist for their dresses and so that's why I gave it a four out of five stars. I had to return it because I couldn't &#34;fudge&#34; on how high above my waist that it was. If you are short waisted then I would recommend this dress because the quality and prompt deliver were impressive.
4.0,"These pants are super adorable and comfortable. They do fit snuggly around thighs, so if you're looking for a loose pant you might want to keep looking. Otherwise they're pretty perfect. I'm giving it a four star review because I ordered the navy floral joggers, but received the navy floral palazzo pants instead. I'm still going to keep them because yeah, totes comfy and cute, just kind of really wanted the joggers."
4.0,Nice shirt. Great color and fit. One button was chipped but easy to sew on the extra button that came with it in place.
4.0,I LOVE the cord and stones on this necklace. I’m wearing it right now and it’s an excellent fidget when I’m bored in class. I’d definitely buy this again! :)
4.0,Runs a bit short.
4.0,Nice cotton high waisted. There's not many cotton options for the high waisted format.<br />140 lb = get XL :)
4.0,"The product has worked well so far.  Only time will tell about how it works down the road after some wear.  It is smart looking, attractive, and keeps key clutter out of site both in and out of your pocket.  This also helps keep your keys from damaging something else in your pocket and keep the keys going in and out of your pants pocket smoothly.<br />No more struggling with your keys."
4.0,"I love the color, just needed to order a size larger."
4.0,The swimsuit looked like the photo and the bottoms fit as expected the top was a little small.
4.0,I found this product off tiktok and it really does the job! Makes my neck feel better while I watch TV from just lying down normally in bed. The lens and mirror did pop out on one of the eyes though after a couple weeks of using them. They do click back in however so it's an easy fix.
4.0,"This hoodie is great! Its thick enough to be warm in cooler weather and looks great. We ordered XL and it actually fits as a medium,  as it is Asian sized, so keep in mind when ordering to order a couple sizes over your normal size. All in all a great jacket!"
4.0,"I really like the look of this belt, but I do not think it is actually leather like it is advertised. I've been wearing it for a few weeks and it has started to peel a small amount at the edges of the strap. This is very minor, though, so hopefully it is still able to last for a while.<br /><br />Update 4/22/17:<br />I haven't noticed much more peeling on the belt, so that is good. One thing I have noticed is that the uncut end of the belt seems a bit too long. What I mean is that when the belt is set on the first or second notch in the ratchet locking system, it's fine, but tightening it passed that causes the uncut end to extend farther than I'd like it to along my waist. This wouldn't be an issue if I wore the belt with only one pair of pants, but because I like to wear the belt with different pants made of different materials with different thicknesses, I need the belt set to a slightly different length for some pants.If I cut the belt for the thicker pants, the uncut end is too long for the thinner pants, but if I cut the belt for the thinner pants, it won't fit the thicker pants. This issue could be easily amended if the ratchet locking system was closer to the uncut end of the belt. At the first locking point, the uncut end of the belt extends about 4.5 inches passed the buckle. Personally, this is about the most I'd want the uncut end to extend passed the buckle, meaning the remaining 20+ locking points are useless. I think that shifting the locking system an inch or two closer to the uncut end of the belt would really improve its versatility.<br />Unfortunately for me, I tried to make a compromise between the two pairs of pants I like to wear this belt with by cutting it at a length that was just long enough for the thicker jeans but short enough that the uncut end wouldn't extend too far on the thinner pants. It didn't work like I hoped it would. The belt just barely works for the jeans, but I don't think the constant strain that it's under while I'm wearing it is the best thing for the belt. Also, the uncut end is still a little too long for the thinner pants. I'd buy a second one just so I could have one of the correct length for each of the pairs of pants, but I'm not sure how worth it that purchase would be. Like I said before, there have been some peeling issues with the paint/rubber/whatever coating on the belt, so I'm not sure how long the belt will last. I don't want to buy a second belt if it's going to end up having a short lifespan. Regardless, it is a very nice looking belt and I often get compliments on it when I wear it. Just be careful when cutting it, especially if considering wearing it with multiple pairs of pants."
4.0,These are cute and cheap but the middle section between the eyes snapped in half within a few weeks. Go ahead and buy them but carry them in a hard case if you're not wearing them.
4.0,"Just used this on the September LSAT and a couple practice tests leading up to it, and I was really glad I had it. It was really helpful and gave me one less thing to worry about when working through games and RC. The band let me kind of prop it up, which was another time saver since I didn't have to turn my wrist to look at it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because you have to manually turn the dial back between sections. It wasn't difficult or anything, just a slight inconvenience but it didn't cause any real problems during the test. Also, since it doesn't have an hour hand, you can't use it as a real watch, which might have been cool."
4.0,"Love the colors, good quality, and east to unscrew balls for application. On con is the bar is pretty thick it took me almost ten minutes  to insert  and i used lubricant!"
4.0,A little too tight on my hubby’s face.
4.0,"As a groomer, smaller works better on those small dogs. Their stiffer as well; again this can be a plus as I have to starch & iron larger Bandanas befor use. They come in vivid, eye catching patterns. Just depends on your needs."
4.0,"I love the color and fabric of this shirt. I was worried it would run a little small, but it fit great! I think this can be worn with jeans or dressed up for a more business casual look. I love that this comes in so many different colors from your basic colors to fun and vibrant colors.  My husband loves all of these and we have several different colors.  We have had no issues with washing them or them holding up.<br /><br />There is no price listed at this time on Amazon, but the tag on the shirt does say over $100.  I would not pay over $100 for a shirt, but otherwise these are perfect."
4.0,"The shirt is very soft. The sleeves are not too long. The length of the shirt is flattering. The cut is a little large. I'm a size 6, ordered a medium and the shirt fit too big. This is a great shirt with leggings or tight jeans. The shirt drapes very nicely and the quality is great. The crisscross in the front adds a detail that makes it feel dressier than a plain black shirt.<br />This is NOT junior sizing!!!"
4.0,Made walking and house work much easier.<br />I'm  77 years old  and they help.
4.0,"Love the size and style.  HOWEVER!!! They were shipped in a plastic envelope inside a paper envelope.  The posts were bent when I received them.  Also, would order again if they had yellow or rose gold color.  But please change how they are shipped!"
4.0,Cute outfits but very small in size. Ordered for my granddaughter who wears a 6x but I ordered a 10 -12 & it was still too small.. just fit her.
4.0,"I had to return these because they run small they were tight on her, upside they are very cute and she did like the colors and patterns."
4.0,do not like the ties stitched to back.  good construction
4.0,The color is perfect. My granddaughter just started wearing 18 months clothes so we went with the 18-24 months. She only got into the body part. Runs big. She will be. Blue to fit it next year.
4.0,"Really like this hat. For Costa, the bill seems a little wide. Still looks nice."
4.0,"I was very happy with the suit itself. The accessories I wasn't as pleased with as they weren't very well made but it wasn't too hard to find replacement gloves/tactical belts, etc, which you can also find on amazon. As far as fit goes I am 5'4&#34; and 120lbs and the small fits me well. I've worn it 2-3 times and it's held up pretty well; I did get a small rip along the seam on the side of my my waist although it was a fairly easy fix to stitch up.<br /><br />The current price amazon has for the small ($85) I consider to be quite good, I paid a lot more for mine back when this was a newer item."
4.0,"worked great for recent trip, nice sun protection and breathable"
4.0,Great fit! Nice and flowy. The material is quality and came as pictured. They are long so keep that in mind. All in all very happy with the purchase.
4.0,"A hole ripped though one while putting it on, but they were super cheap so it was worth the price. Their super cheapness made it easy to shorten one for my 4 year old by ripping the bottom 6 inches off while waiting in line at Disney World."
4.0,"I love this ring. It is super cute and looks great on. However, it is very thin and weak and it bends and gets mis-shapen very easiy. I have a feeling that it will not be very long before the ring breaks, making it not necessarily worth what I paid for it. In the meantime though, the ring does look great, which is why I gave it a good review."
4.0,"Super cute, sturdy hasn’t tarnished yet! It’s been a few weeks and I’ve worn it on vaca and swimming."
4.0,"very nice, posts were a bit long for my wife."
4.0,"For the money, it's a bargain. Fits me great. It's not the highest quality shirt, but I like it for a current fashion piece at a reasonable price."
4.0,"Was really trying to find a youth sized sunglasses that were cool. Definitely too small on my 8yo who adult glasses are still way big for, kind of an ok size on my 6yo but just barely. These were marketed as youth sunglasses and really should be small children or toddler. I consider youth to be school aged like elementary and middle school. Other than wishing they were slightly bigger they are a great quality and very cool according to my kids"
4.0,"Good price, decent quality. Great for the price!"
4.0,Awesome pullovers for the price! Husband loves them $12 comfy warm and stylish
4.0,Very cute and I think the two hairclips will help it stay in place.  Only problem is that one of the &#34;pearls&#34; had fallen off while still in the packaging.  I will need to get a friend with a hot glue gun to glue it back.
4.0,"Fine quality, but the posts are very short. I returned them. They pinched my earlobes."
4.0,"It's okay, but it doesn't suck much in. I bought it to wear under dresses so my thighs don't rub together. But it has these REALLY thin support &#34;bars&#34; at the top that don't do anything except show through tighter dresses. It also doesn't suck in any belly. So, compression-wise, it's low on the scale of Good. Overall, it didn't shape my tummy at all, but it did stop the chafing."
4.0,Really cute gift for our raccoon lover.  Nicely made.
4.0,"After reading the reviews and seeing 60% at the time reported that the sizes run small, I ordered mine two sizes larger than I would have than if I were to shop at Wal-Mart or Target. While it fits, the top is a bit more snug than I like and the skirt needs to be taken in. I'm a little on the heavier side but I'm reluctant to buy this again for my friend who is thicker than I am. I went for the XXLarge and I was going to get the 3XLarge for her until I tried mine on. I may just see how much of mine fits her and debate getting the 3XLarge to alter the top. The skirt might fit her a bit better because she is hippy-er than I am and I have some pretty wide hips. If con sizes are labeled as:<br /><br />Half a pole<br />Pole<br />Could have tried harder to lose those last few pounds...<br />Maybe she's sick and on a steroid medication for it...<br />Maybe it's a thyroid problem...<br />Did she eat her friend?<br />Did she eat her friends?<br />DAYUM<br />Did she eat Japan<br /><br />or<br /><br />...she had to have made that herself or have someone make it...<br /><br />I would be on the lower end of the ""Maybe she's sick and on a steroid medication"" end just after the ""Could have tried harder to lose those last few pounds"" part of the spectrum. The shoulders on the top are boxy and there's not enough fabric inbetween the shoulder blades which restricts my arm movements. This sucks because I am going to a convention in March as Ayano and I was planning on going in character...this will make it harder to...take care of...my rivals in love. Loliez. All in all, it's a great costume, the material is great and not that cheap nylon crap and it looks authentic. The white part of the top is a bit shiny looking in the light but if you look from farther away it's not as bad. When it's on you and you see it, it's shiny. When you take it off and put it on your bed, it's not as shiny. For me, I'm usually a Large in most North American stores that keep up with their sizes so when I ordered my XXLarge, I wasn't so sure it would work out. Now that I have it and have tried it on, I'm very satisfied with my purchase but other people might want to try another seller. All that's left for me to do is to get a wig, a leg holster for a fake knife with it's own fake knife, and a bag to hold my  second fake knife<br />(Because duh! All the smart yandere girls have a back up!), scissors, and love note! Oh! I also love that the tie is it's own piece! It's not attached to the uniform or a clip on! It's adds to that authentic feel! There is also a part on the collar that can unbutton. It's made to look like a camisole but you can unbutton it if you don't like it or if the costume has a V-neck collar. I don't mind it but there is no where to put the collar once you unbutton the one side. The other side is stitched so you'd have to unstitch the one side and add another button yourself so it removes completely. You might also want add a few more buttons if you do that so  it stays in place. There was a zipper on the one side of the top that could be used to add more fabric and that's why I think I can alter a 3XLarge if I get one for my larger friend...I blame her big heart. She's 63% heart and 37% rest of the human body."
4.0,I loved the material but it runs small. The sleeves didn’t fit right around my wrist. Make sure you size up from your original size.
4.0,I love the colors love how many there were for the price BUT doesn’t look like will fit newborn..
4.0,Okay for a cheap costume
4.0,"Not really compression tops, but very comfortable & breathable fabric. Great value for the price."
4.0,"gave as gift,no feedback yet.I like it a lot!!"
4.0,Just got them because  LADY GAGA wore them on her Bad romance Video. Still they are  confortable and well made.  Frame is a tad on the big side  but  it is not a big issue. Best feature is the Case that  allows for the shades to go ANYWHERE  and be stored ANYWHERE without breaking!
4.0,Great dress to wear if you are breastfeeding! Fit nice!
4.0,It's slightly different than I imagined from the posted image but It is still a gorgeous tie.
4.0,"•Love the pattern, true to the picture<br />•the bottoms were a bit cheeky and didnt quite come up to my belly button as most high waisted bottoms do<br />•the top straps are removable ONLY in the back so you can criss-cross them I'd you want to. I'm a little too tall/long to do that.<br />•I'm a c cup so the top was a perfect fit for me, but of you have a fuller cup size this may not fit as expected.<br />Overall it's a tiny bit snug and the bottoms are not as high waisted as I expected but I'm tall and have a mom apron, so if you like your bathing suits to be snug then get your normal but if like having a little more give then order 1 size up."
4.0,"Like it!  A neat, fun and different piece to wear with casual wear. You can' t beat it for the cost. Neat to wear with racerback tees for summer and fall,"
4.0,"I almost always wear size 6. These feel a little big on my feet. I recommend getting a half size down. Unfortunately size 6 was the smallest they had.<br />Overall they are comfortable and cute. I have a weirdly shaped left foot so it is pressing down on my 4th toe, and rubs on my Achilles. However after 3rd time wearing, they gotten better. Overall I recommend getting these!"
4.0,Not authentic but still looks great. Hopefully it holds up like a champ.
4.0,"Not as long as I expected. Would be great for toddlers, but not for &#34;big kids.&#34;"
4.0,I thought this was the perfect summer bag but it has done nothing but frustrate me. There is always one strap falling off my shoulder and I hate that. Didn’t keep the tags or I’d send it back.
4.0,I'm a size 8 and the fit of these pre-washed were perfect. Once you've washed them they are slightly tighter.  BUT they are super cute. You can't see the animal's face if you wear them with tennis shoes though.
4.0,Very Cute. It was a “trinket” gift.
4.0,"Difficult to open and close, but thats not always a bad thing. Make sure you have good fingernails or a guitar pick to get it off the bracelet. I used pliers to initally open them."
4.0,Definitely a very nice shirt but a little thinner than I was expecting but a great summer time shirt. It is actually made by alpinestars which I am impressed by. I dislike when you get a shirt that is not actually made by the company it's just a label. This is truly an Alpinestar shirt! My only complaint would be that it is just a little short for a large in length..
4.0,Great shirt. The sleeves could be a bit longer for the 3XLT size. Very comfortable. Wash and dry nicely. Will order more.
4.0,It seems to be made of real sterling silver and she really loves it
4.0,"They’re good quality, but my baby is terrified of the color difference in what she sees! 😂"
4.0,Top pairs well with leggings and can be dressed up or down. The material is soft and the fit is loose and flowing. Overall a nice shirt.
4.0,There was nothing exceptional.  Receive what I ordered and was satisfied with the price.
4.0,"I'm 5'8, about 165lbs., and a 34C, and I usually wear a medium, but I ordered a large based upon the sizing listed. I ordered the blue and the large fits well. It looks like it costs more than I paid and this top is so cute. I love the halter neck and that it ties on the side, and the deep cut under the arms. I was worried it would look cheap, but I am so happy I purchased it!"
4.0,I got so many compliments on this cover up. It fit me well and I am a size 6. The only down side of this purchase is the embroidery on the bottom is coming apart and I have worn it twice without washing it. :(
4.0,These shoes run a little small and a little narrow. I'd go with one size larger for wider feet.
4.0,"The pendant looks comparatively cheap to the photo, but all in all I got what I paid for and I love it. This was a gift for my grandma and she adores it as well. It was purchased with the matching Christmas tree ornament, which is the same quality."
4.0,I love this necklace it looks fantastic the only thing that was wrong was the color but other than that it looks great.
4.0,"These are good pants—comfortable and tough.  I ordered 36x30 because that’s what I have in another pair of Mountain Khakis.  As the photo shows, the paper label on the new pants also says 36x30, but the cloth tag sewn into them says 38x30.  I don’t kno which one is right, but they fit so I’ll keep them."
4.0,"Overall a very nice watch.  I thought it would self-wind often enough so that I would not have to wind it every morning, but that has not been the case.  But it has a big face that can be easily read, and has a watchband that is sturdy enough so that it can easily be latched and strapped on my wrist with one hand.  I would definitely buy another one in the future."
4.0,I use these as work shoes. They get beat up but they hold together pretty good.
4.0,"This bracelet is fantastic! I love how light and simple it is! The only complaint I have is the clasp. I would like the product more if it was easier to put on. Maybe using an elastic band would be better?  Or maybe use the same material, but have it more like the slider/knot clasp?  Still a great product. I love it!"
4.0,"This was really good for the price, It has a extra bow and has a really nice texture. though its hard to untie it if you double not it but other then that its a great cosplay. :D"
4.0,"Nice material and style. Unfortunately it was to small for my daughter, but that was my fault!<br />Aase"
4.0,"Love the fit im not curvy and some fits just look square or to round in the hips for me. I purchased a small im 5'3, 125 lbs. The material is a heavy t-shirt type. Very nice summer dress."
4.0,"I read past reviews, and ordered an XL. I'm normally a medium (I'm 5'6&#34;, 135 lbs, 36C chest), but the XL fits well. The fabric is stretchy and comfortable - and I think I would even have been okay with a L. The suit does have 3 little decorative buttons on each side towards the bottom, and one of mine was loose. Nothing a little thread a needle wouldn't fix though. For the price, this suit is really cute and comfortable."
4.0,The band is the slim fit and quarky style I was looking for.  There is slide to adjust the strap that is uncomfortable if in the wrong position on my wrist but otherwise I'm happy with this purchase.
4.0,"Nice well put together earrings, worth the money, longer than i thought they would be but thats ok. they look cool and have held up well so far. Buy them!"
4.0,looks good except the post of the earrings could be better
4.0,They are not one size fit all
4.0,"Received this product very quickly. It looks very nice. I have not had a chance to start using it, but it looks perfect for when I travel. Happy so far"
4.0,"These are not as nice as the $20 pair of sunglasses I had for three years before they broke, but I got ten pairs for the price of one, so if you are always losing/breaking sunglasses, this is the deal for you.  I'll probably keep them in the plastic bags they came in when I'm not wearing them so the lenses don't get scratched."
4.0,Es muy cómodo y bonito y biene exactamente como esta en la foto y si es como yo lo esperaba
4.0,"Fabric is not as nice as it is in the photos, but I still like the top."
4.0,They're made too small and so far one pair had a hole in them.<br /><br />Update: the company made it right with the socks I ordered that were too small and damaged. They are very kind and willing to work with their customers.
4.0,Dress was amazing for Sunday service
4.0,It's very comfortable and soft to the touch.  My son loves it although I consider it will look better a tiny bit tighter.
4.0,Material good quality for the price....fits well...Ordered a Large because I am a Med/Lg.  Material stretches
4.0,I love these.  They look awesome and make me look amazing
4.0,Fits TTS. Great purple color.
4.0,I ordered this red necklace to help my root chakra.  I don’t think it did much unfortunately.  Quality was on the thin cheap side.  Color was nice.
4.0,"True to size, but leather looks a bit cheap.  I like that it has the ratchet and it looks like it can be adjusted smaller by adding holes to the belt without having the strap hang in front of the belt.<br /><br />I am a long time Amazon shopper and depend on reviews to help make decisions.  I did get this item at a discount in exchange for leaving a review, but my opinions are genuine."
4.0,"Super cute and well made. However, there is literally no stretch to it and it fits rather snug. I ordered a L/XL and it's more like a M/L"
4.0,"Very dark gray, denim-like texture but wool blend material. Interior is fleece padded. back headband, top button, and peak are contrasting black plastic leather. Fixed brim. Wider than a 6-panel Ivy to accommodate fold-out earmuffs, but still has the silhouette of any Ivy (Gatsby style makes me look like that meme of a rabbit wearing a pancake on its head). Wore it in light rain to take the dog for a walk, it dried without shrinking or distortion. Wore it on a cold day, it keeps your ears under a blanket warmed by the top of your head, but I will probably still need my Thinsulate-lined Patrol Cap for very cold weather."
4.0,"A little looser would make the medium perfect.  I plan to keep them, but would have been happier with a bit more room for better comfort.  The large would be too big, and the medium is very a close fit."
4.0,Super cute. You will want to sew the buttons on again because they aren't sewn on well.
4.0,BUT purchased a kids rather than adult
4.0,"Bought these for running, they are perfect"
4.0,It’s a pretty mustard. I’m 44 bust size. I checked the size chart and got the L. Unfortunately the sleeves were way too tight for me. The bust fit fine. I had to return.
4.0,"Nice looking watch. Quality isn't the greatest, but its a good wooden watch for the price. I've seen others that are far more expensive and are about equal in quality so for the price it's great. I've had a lot of complements on it so its been worth the money."
4.0,They work and the way they fit the glasses.
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised that these are slightly decent quality. I got them to spruce up photo shots I'm taking if nail art I'm doing. These are just right for the job.
4.0,Good fabric. Love the pockets. Have purchased several sets
4.0,worked great for snorkeling
4.0,i bought this watch for my fiancee and he wears it every day! he had to shave his wrist hair since the bands were catching on them though. also the guidelines are NOT in English and very hard to understand anyways. He had to look up a video on youtube to figure out how to shorten the band and program the watch.
4.0,"Great product at a great price, size chart was spot on"
4.0,Beautiful but unstructured compared to othe more pricy MK bags. 2 pockets and a lot of open space so I fixed that with a lightweight purse organizer.
4.0,I ended up with a couple of 3T shirts when I ordered 4T but didn’t notice until I was folding laundry this morning. My fault for not checking before tossing them in the washer! It’s a good thing my son is between sizes!
4.0,They do not come with filters.
4.0,"Very nice earrings and very large. I knew they would be large, but didn't expect quite so much. Still very nice and light weight. The picture shows more of a silver color, but they are actually more pewter in color."
4.0,"These are well made...they're a slimmer fit, however, they have a bit of stretch to them so they fit like they're supposed to. Hopefully nothing happens to the fit in the wash, but so far...i'm happy with this purchase."
4.0,My boyfriend absolutely loves these pants. Now they did lose a star on one simple technicality...... They forgot to cut a button hole! I had to laugh the sewing around the hole was there just no cut... I just took my fabric knife and sliced through. The pants them selves are a very nice heavy Jean. They seem sewn well and durable. The chains are removable so if you don't like them you can leave them off. The belt is a bit cheap and just for decoration but all in all these are very nice pants.<br />I recieved this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion
4.0,"I liked the mirror finish. Easy to clip on and off. However, the lenses were taller than I had hoped for, but I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Had the wrong color delivered. Also the earring was bigger than anticipated and didn’t work where I wanted it. Nice product, just didn’t work for me."
4.0,Comfortable.  Good quality.
4.0,Beautiful earing and the shade of color is great
4.0,Great color but wish it had more ravens on it
4.0,It’s cute & cheerful & on my key ring now ✔️
4.0,"Great shirt with nice stretch to it. Everyone says they run small so I got a large. I am wishing I ordered a small or medium instead because the large is a little loose on me. Ladies if you are petite very slim like me, i am 5'8 140 lbs then order your normal size. I suppose my somewhat large nyc shirt will shrink in the wash though. Anyways, nice slim fit v neck."
4.0,Sooo cute! Only con would be you can't wear with boots andl dress look. They won't stay up on bare legs. But its still cute to wear over jeans  so im not complaining.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8311fb6512688fd80a8d5bd711d85c78]] This is my first pair of Aetrex. I decided to try them since I've suffered from plantar fascitis in the past, so need good arch support in my sandals, but wanted something a little dressier than some other supportive brands that tend to be a little bulkier.<br /><br />The good: The footbed is extremely comfortable and supportive, a real dream and one of the best I've tried, worth every dollar. The sole is light-weight textured rubber, non-slip and quiet when walking, really nice. The back of the ankle strap is elasticized, which helps with fit and comfort, and the ankle strap is adjustable. The look is very feminine, dressy enough for skirts and cute with jeans. I love the soft, neutral two-tone &#34;blush&#34; color, the reason why I got them, to have something neutral that would &#34;blend in&#34; rather than stand out.<br /><br />What I'm not so hot about: I didn't notice in the description that the decoration on the vertical strap on top of the foot includes RHINESTONES. Very sparkly rhinestones. The decoration is a strip of 18 tiny beaded chevrons, each with a small rhinestone in the center. The sparkliness is not visible in the product picture, which is why I mention it as I was surprised when I pulled them out of the box.<br /><br />Now, if you have shapely legs and pretty feet you want to draw attention to, or just like sparkly things, you will LOVE these sandals. They really are very pretty. But they are sparkly in a way that makes them less neutral, so it's something to be aware of. I've added a video so you can see what I'm talking about. It's why I deducted one star from the review, not a flaw in the sandal so much as a flaw in the description and the way the sandal is pictured.<br /><br />But if you like the look and like sparkles, and want something super-comfortable, go ahead and give them a try!"
4.0,Shorter than I expected it to be.  Fabric is not as thick as I expected. Has a nice drape and good style elements.  Laundered nicely.
4.0,I will excited  when swim suit  arrived. So far stitching looks great. Tried on legs a little tight. Plan on losing a little more weight. In all I like.
4.0,This watch band is just great.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the band is about 1/2 inch too short for my large wrists.  Wish they made some for those of us that are bigger.
4.0,"these are very cheap looking but for the price, its ok with me because they make cool gifts"
4.0,Doesn't look as loose as shown in the pic
4.0,"Nice, wrinkle free fabric, right out of the package. Loved the feel of the fabric and the way it moves and drapes. Only slight complaint is the amount of lining fabric inside the collar/lapels. It makes the front of the dress - specifically the boob area - look a bit bulkier than I'd like. Aside from that, a great dress for the price."
4.0,My child loves these. They are very light and easy for her to put on. The design isn't perfect but you can't beat the price
4.0,"This hat is really cute, but large. I thought it would fit my 3 year old grandson, but it covers his eyes. 😮 I kept it because he loves Coco."
4.0,"The gloves are ok for gardening but its  difficult to feel through them. A lot of on and off for planting seeds, but ok for larger planting."
4.0,"My neck size is quite big (17.5 inches), so while this was MUCH more comfortable than most neck gaiters, it still was not as big as I hoped.  Another half inch would have such a difference.  Still, it's an option if, like me, you can't make the standard gaiter work at all."
4.0,A little bigger then expected.  Love the color!
4.0,pretty true to size but the material is pretty hot and the neck comes up a lot more then id like. no tummy control at all. The color is no where near the picture. so it wont go with the outfit i planned to wear it with
4.0,"Buen material,buen empacado 👌🏾"
4.0,"This is a pretty good mask. We had a masquerade themed event, and everyone loved it."
4.0,"These googles are perfect for clear sunny days. Tint, huge infinity style multi colored lens looks awesome. Super wide peripheral vision is a game changer. Would not recommend for days with any kind of snow or rain as the water on the lense will either freeze or melt and then causes blue and orange colored distorted vision. Might try another lens for wet conditions. Great spring season or bluebird google. Also includes high end hard case for storage that more expensive brands don’t even offer. I’ll buy more. Highly recommend and can’t beat the price."
4.0,My granddaughter is going to love it for graduation
4.0,I'm usually a 32DD but other reviews said it runs small and to buy a size bigger so I bought a 34DD. Now I regret it. I wish I would off just bought a 32DD in the first places
4.0,"Just to let you know, the ruffles on the shoulder are not actually apart from the dress, and while this is a very cute and generally well fitting skirt, I did have to go through some alterations to the strap length from my height (5'2''). Taller people, I'd say 5'4&#34; and up would have an issue, but its just a little thing I had to do to make it work for me."
4.0,Cute but its a little thin not as thick or warm as it looks
4.0,"These are great material wise but I ordered a size too big. No panty lines even if I wear spandex shorts. I would reorder a different style since these have worked so well!<br /><br />EDIT: After a few months, these have held up really well. Still recommend! If you're on the edge, do it. They retain softness and shape despite my workout routine and lifestyle!"
4.0,"i liek the look of this cap and the satin is very soft. the only trouble is getting your hair into it. if you have big hair or curly hair with curls you want to protect, this is probably not the bonnet for you. the opening is quite small, even with the elastic opened all the way, you can't get it around your head to envelop your curls. you'd have to tuck them in which would defeat the purpose of maintaining them as it would smush the curls and style just trying to get them in there. i found i had to pull the bonnet down over my head completely like a ski mask to be able to get my hair in all in one go. which is obviously, not ideal. and then the bonnet has come off a few times in bed which means it's too small to manage curls and also not all that secure.<br /><br />this beanie/bonnet is good for style, and wearing like as a protective fashion statement if you don't mind some hair sticking out, but if you plan to sleep with this on to protect curls, this ain't it, bestie.<br /><br />get something with a wider opening."
4.0,"I really like these slippers. They look nice, are comfortable enough and the hard bottom has grip - which is great for tile floors. The only reason I took off a star is the memory foam interior breaks down after a couple days of wear. The slippers are still nice, but definitely not as cushioned as when they are right out of the box. When I got memory foam slippers, I had hoped this feature would last a bit longer. But for the price, they really are great slippers."
4.0,All the silicon bands irritate my wrist and leave me with red rashes. Fortunately I found this product! I absolutely love it. It is easy to adjust and is so comfortable that sometimes I forget I have it on. :) I would definitely recommend this if you have an odd sized wrist with in between sizing of normal watch bands.
4.0,Looks just like the photos!! Fits great and I love how it looks on me. Follow me on Instagram @synovia_owens
4.0,Really good size shoes fit perfectly
4.0,"The 100% wool red fez is great. Almost everything you would come to expect from a fez, good construction from quality materials. Great for finishing off a costume or for everyday use. My only issue with this hat is the tassel, it seems to be a small piece of rolled wool tucked through a hole in the top of the hat with no fastening of any kind. This could be a choking hazard to young children. Other then that, this is a fantastic hat for young adults to adults.<br /><br />*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own."
4.0,"For the price, this isn’t bad. Considering other replicas push the $400-$1000 mark sometimes, this is solid for what you pay for. The title is heavy, which is a nice plus."
4.0,I bought these to wear around the house with slippers during the cold months. They are very warm and comfortable but they don't come up high enough on the leg. The top of the sock barely comes above the ankle which is okay for around the house wear but I don't think they are well suited to wear outside. I think the product information should state that they are &#34;ankle socks&#34;.
4.0,"Very cute top, but a little larger than expected around stomach area. Im 5'6&#34; and weigh 160. I wouldnt size down though because it would be too small in bust area. Im a 36C. This is perfect if you like it a little extra flowy. Great length, perfect with a cardigan."
4.0,washes well. fits a bit large but comfortable. was exactly what i was hoping to get  the brushed fabric on the inside is great;
4.0,"This is my favorite scarf ever. It hangs nicely and I get lots of compliments. It’s my goal to own every color (except the tri-colors, of which I am not a fan). I have several colors so far, but I ended up sending back the following: Camel and apple green seemed like washed out and ashy colors and were not as vibrant as in the pictures. Camel was more of a lightish grey-brown, almost like a khaki but a tinge grayer. Cinnamon turned out to be the perfect light brown/camel color for me, but still did not look quite like the picture. The burgundy is also more like a slightly darker red than the actual red scarf and not quite burgundy. The dark brown/coffee colored one is actually a dark maroon but I kept it anyway. I definitely will order more, though. This is the only winter infinity scarf I’ve found that I really like. Only a few more colors left to go!"
4.0,"I've never owned a rash guard so I thought I'd give this a try. I'm taking a vacation at the beach so, I wanted something with more coverage but that was also cute. This fits the bill. I ordered a 3X and I'm happy with the fit. It can be worn with swim shorts or a regular bathing suit bottom. It's stylish and has a built in bra. You will have to adjust the girls as needed to work with the built in bra."
4.0,Overall I like it and it's very warm. My only complaint would be that it doesn't slouch as much with my hair up in a bun
4.0,these were very easy to put on and light. I think my daughter really enjoys wearing them.
4.0,"Hard to find these! They are great, so much better then pull ups being they are real undies. They do have a little bit of an akward fit- but still worthwhile."
4.0,"I would say I cannot wait to wear this to hand out candy, but I don't think we're doing that this year.<br /><br />Still a nice mask and it seems like it is decently made for short term wear (protests perhaps?)<br /><br />It is good enough that I'd buy it again or in multiple colors if I needed to."
4.0,"Friend's daughter wanted work out clothes for her birthday.  She was happy, although confused on how to put it on...!  We assured her that Mom would help her."
4.0,This maroon top is a bit more pinkish - otherwise I would have given it 5 stars but the color does not look like the picture at all.  Otherwise it is a high-low top and is still cute.
4.0,"The arm ends of my sport sunglasses are padded, so it was difficult to slide the strap onto them.  I have yet to test them in battle, but if they hold, I would highly recommend them."
4.0,This was great value for the money my daughter spent. The ears are not extremely thick but will hold up for many wears. And let us not forget the fun and laughs we all got by wearing them in public.
4.0,"I bought this copper fabric mask over others because it has more layers than most brands, plus the cotton liner is more comfortable on the skin.  Works as designed, but 2 flaws: it doesn't cover the face like it shows, not even close unless you have a tiny head (it sits on the tip of the nose and still only covers right at the bottom of the chin). 2nd flaw is that the elastic straps are pretty tight, I has to let them stretch out around a box for a few days for them to loosen up.  Otherwise is a top-notch mask."
4.0,My son likes the light weight and fit for Athletics. I noticed that they are thin.
4.0,"These feel so good, look so smooth, and I am the only one in my area who has a pair. My only issue is that it will tilt off balance every now and again.  But even that won't stop me from giving it a 5 star rating.<br /><br />10.27.17 Update:  The glasses are still nice however I can't take this glass serious due to lack of protection fromm angles.  Also these glass are still tilting off balance more often than normal.  So I updated my review from 5 to 4 stars."
4.0,"I love how it looks, but it's very difficult to keep on your ear."
4.0,"Not bad, dries out if left in freezer too long, but it does work. Kept the kids thinking it was cooler than it was."
4.0,Little wide BUT quite comfortable only wear them for my spin classes so I really honestly cannot comment on their arch support!!
4.0,And that's the whole point isn't it?  She is petite and it fit as described.  She had no complaints about the fit or comfort.
4.0,Really like this top.  Thick material but not overwhelmingly warm.  Nice fit.
4.0,Smaller than expected but still very adorable. Material seems a little thin. Still satisfied with the purchase but we will see how well it holds up for my 4th grader.
4.0,Great QUALITY. Fabric is soft and stretchy. Runs a little big. The only reason why its not 5 stars is because the neckline is larger than a normal short. I still highly reccomen it though.
4.0,I am 5'3&#34; and wear a size 8 dress.  The medium fit well.  The elastic on the arms can be little tight but that is what holds the dress on the shoulders so cannot be helped.  The sleeves are too long on me but you can tuck in extra fabric in the black sleeve area to adjust it.  It is short - a little lower than mid thigh so I wear shorts under this dress. The lining is nice and the dress is definitely not see through.  Would recommend.
4.0,"Loved the fit and singles adjustable strap. However, broke/snapped at nose bridge and lens connection"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ea12ba37c1990e5fecfb70a05bce5abd]] Used on my IPhone Watch. Love a the colors and comfortable on all day.
4.0,Definitely good quality for the price
4.0,"Love these, got them on time thank you"
4.0,The person I got the gift for wishes they were thicker.
4.0,"In this part of the country the temperature gets into the 20's and 30's so you don't need a rabbit fur ushanka to keep your head warm. This 'Trapper Hat' is perfect for keeping your head and ears warm and you can't beat the price at $10. The only complaint I'd have is that the bill gets in the way and it would likely not fit someone who wears a hat over size 7-1/2 (US size, of course). It fits me fine (although pretty snug) but I wish it had a snap to hold the bill up when you want it out of the way. I ended up sewing it up since it was in the way more times than not. It also has no way to hold up the ear flaps if you want them up, either - but I still gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because - it didn't cost that much :)."
4.0,I’ve bought several tops from Lollo Vita and they all run huge except this one. I would say this runs true to US sizing. Typically I’m a US XL and usually order M/L in this brand. This sweater in a large was pulling at the bottom buttons. Hopefully An xl will fit perfectly because it is beautiful in person.
4.0,The slide ins fit as expected and are good quality.
4.0,The fresh water pearl is beautiful.  The chain is thin and should be thicker to avoid tangling.
4.0,Nice shirt but material is very thin. Runs kind of big. Much wider than how it looks in the pictures
4.0,"Cute dress, runs a bit tight in the chest. Order 1 size up"
4.0,The dress is an amazing fit!  Looks amazing on me.  The pockets on this dress are out if this world! The only thing is after a few months of washing only delicate cycle and hanging to dry the material is beginning to pill.  Unlike any of my other style dresses from this company
4.0,I like the top but the bottoms aren't my favorites. Fortunately I have several black swimsuit bottoms and you can't beat the price of swimsuits on Amazon!
4.0,"It is beautiful and I can tell is original but is a little smaller than expected, anyway Im glad with this purchase."
4.0,"Showed up with one arm not attached, or at least not attached correctly because it fell off as I picked them up. Snapped it back in place and they seem fine.<br /><br />Nice, light, polarized glasses. Good value."
4.0,This is a beautiful necklace and pendant. I absolutely love the look of the necklace I'm just not sure its strong enough to last very long. The design of it is pretty though. The pendant is really pretty. The moon as a wonderful look to it. The colors are very vibrant. Looks great against my skin. My daughter saw this and fell in love with it. She's already taken it from me. I can see needing to replace the necklace at some point but the pendant is sturdy and I think it will last a long time. I would purchase this product just for the pendant! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"Love the color, pockets, sleeve length, neckline & overall fit. Took a star off though because I’m 5’4 & even wearing high heels it still needs hemmed. Would be perfect for taller women."
4.0,I really like this . I bought a size up but wouldn't have had to . I think if I would have gotten my regular size the arms might have been too tight. As is the arms are snug and look fitted. The body of the dress is very flowy . The fabric is nice weight and not cheap feeling . The seams are well made. I wore it with leggings but it is a good length and I could wear it with out them and not feel exposed.
4.0,"Good fabric and comfortable fit. Themes are a bit childish, but turning them certain ways lets the bright colors show."
4.0,Soft & very comfortable
4.0,This polka dot shirt is sooo cute! It’s a little big but works out for me. The material is good and the shirt is overall really comfy. I am 5”6 and about 130 pounds.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:483a3b30c6f490378bacb9693f2660e0]]
4.0,"It's beautiful and nicely sewn, I just took off a star because it was in no way a large.  I'm almost 5'5"" and under 140lbs and it was skin tight.  I took out the darts, which made it better, but I haven't tried to iron out those creases yet.  If that works, I'll be able to wear it."
4.0,"I love them, but they were a little heavier then expected. They don't bother my ears being a little heavier but may to some. I would buy them again."
4.0,Lives up to the look of the discretion and the looks through the lens are clear and average. Although they run a little snugg if you have a bigger head like me.
4.0,Same input as previously stated.
4.0,My wife likes these sun glasses for the beach. She was surprised the lenses were shaped so large giving her a Janis Joplin look.  I don’t like the size on her but the construction is sturdy.
4.0,"Love the light blue color. The lace is pretty. It's a nice top. But, I'd usually wear a small/med and I wish I could get an XL."
4.0,"The socks were fine. A little thinner than I expected, but had a lot of stretch, and tightened up a bit after washing, but still fit fine."
4.0,"Fit perfectly. I'm 5'4&#34; and very curvy. It fit perfectly. Got a ton of compliments. Only complain is that the skirt does ride up a little while walking.  Otherwise, great purchase😍🤗"
4.0,A little tight on shoulders and wrap is not even. But fabric is great quality.
4.0,pretty large on my wife's head but has reduced her headaches from her work computer alot.
4.0,Purchased these for my step father who loves these type of gifts. Wears them often and loves showing them off to friends. Great gift buy!
4.0,Cutest bag for the pool or the beach. Just wish it was slightly bigger.
4.0,"Its color saturation is gorgeous. I like the shape, length and overall style. It does have that stick to your fat aspect that I don't like."
4.0,"the knit rips and tears easily. Came with some loose threads upon arrival but overalll a cute top, it is comfortable and casual."
4.0,"Almost perfect fit. It's a little tight around the arms, but I only notice it because the fabric is a little coarse. I think it'll be fine after I wash it. I ordered SM and I'm a 34A, 27 in waist (but I typically wear size 26 in pants; 27 is too large somehow), 5'6&#34; and 115-120 pounds. I wore it with a petticoat and it looked great! A cheap dress but fits well, and a well-fitting dress is hard to find, so I say it's a good value."
4.0,Compared to some of the clothes on Amazon these shorts are pretty high quality and hold up quite well with repeated use.
4.0,"Product arrived slightly ahead of scheduled delivery (++) and I had it by the weekend to try on. So comfy! I have dressed it up with jewelry and sweater for work, wore it around the house as lounge wear, put it with leggings for my errand wear. Can you say versatile?<br /><br />I also ordered the illusion layered dress, but haven't worn in yet, but expectations are high! 😊"
4.0,very good product.  Material is good.  Fits as it looks in this picture
4.0,I sent this back. The color was lighter than what I was looking for. The quality seemed good.
4.0,This is lightweight roomy and pretty
4.0,"Really cute and fits small waists.  Seems pretty stretchy, so can fit a range of sizes.  The color was exactly as I had expected from the pictures."
4.0,Product is nice and fits well. Needs to be washed before wearing and tones fade a bit but got many compliments
4.0,This product seems to work pretty well. It was a little smaller than expected and the substance is white but goes on somewhat clear. It takes a little time to apply and you must make sure that get every spot otherwise it won't be protected. I used this on Birkenstocks and it does change the way the sole feels and makes your feet stick to them for lack of a better word. I do think that this product will make my Birkenstocks last longer and then do seem more water resistant. If I knew that my Birkenstocks were never going to be wet I definitely wouldn't buy this product.
4.0,"This swimsuit is so so cute and covered my butt. Most one pieces either gave me wedgies or looked like it belonged to an old lady, but this one is just perfect."
4.0,"On paper they looked great. In real life, not as great"
4.0,Decent luggage for the price.
4.0,They are well made sunglasses. They are unfortunately too big for my face in my opinion.
4.0,"The way this works, it can leave a little but of an odd gap between the top and bottom that might bug some as it did me. I kept wanting to get it to close tighter, but it can't."
4.0,"This dress was great. It was a good material, but was a little thin; slip shorts solved that problem. I haven’t washed it Year, so don’t know how it will hold up, but was a great purchase for at least wearing it once."
4.0,This is a gift for my granddaughter{one she picked out} so I won't know how she likes it until Christmas.
4.0,"I LOVE this dress, i’m 5’2” 120 lbs. I purchased a small and it was perfect.<br />I bought it for my daughters baptism and I was so happy that I did. However, while wearing it I noticed pretty quickly that it stuck to itself and would ruffle up quite easy. I wanted to wear something under the dress just Incase of any mishaps, but again the material stuck to the tights I was wearing under it as well.<br />Beautiful dress and great quality for the price. It’s also the perfect amount of stretch and just the right amount of comfort. If the material were just a little different, I’d have given it a 5 star. ⭐️"
4.0,"Cute top! I don’t think the bottoms color matches the top very well, so I wear some high waisted bottoms of my own. I am 5’7, 155 pounds, 36DDD. Overall, very cute."
4.0,She loved the color and feel
4.0,Great pants!!
4.0,Great sunglasses.  Would have given them 5 stars if they were polarized.
4.0,HUGE but still cute.
4.0,"good item , and same demmintion after wash it"
4.0,Looks good to me but the real test is coming soon.
4.0,"Love the colors, super easy to change bands.  More comfortable then the plastic wrist band that comes with the galaxy watch."
4.0,"Light, durable, with a strong spring.  It would be perfect,  if it was a least 4 times larger."
4.0,"I like this sweater, the fabric feels more like wool instead of synthetic, but it is much darker than the picture shows.  It's far more tan bits with paler bits, like heather style knits than white (almond) JSYK."
4.0,Fit as expected and arrives quickly. Cute for summer.
4.0,"Bought for my dad, and he likes them.  Provides a good combination of range of motion and compression."
4.0,"Bracelet is beautiful and exactly what I wanted, however, the box it comes in leaves a lot to be desired. They tape the box closed and then when you pull the tape off, however gently, it rips the paper off the box and looks terrible. In addition, the egg carton style foam inside does not display the bracelet well at all. I just ended up buying another box to gift it in. Glad the bracelet didn't disappoint."
4.0,Product fits as expected. Very cute design and looks very well on boys. Just the color fades with repeated uses.
4.0,fits pretty good not perfect
4.0,"I just wanted to weigh in because I had a different experience than some of the other reviewers.<br />The shipping was super fast- arrived in 3 days.<br />The size was just fine and I don't have particularly small hands. The come up over my elbow by about an inch.<br />The quality is fine for a costume, a little thin but not noticeably.<br />Overall I am very happy for the price I paid."
4.0,It's what it said and what I expected.  Size is good
4.0,Decent set for a decent price. O rings are a little loose for the size though
4.0,"I love Kid Nation’s clothes. These are made very well. They are so thick, cuddly, and easy to care for. I really like these colors. They are really vibrant and they didn't bleed or shrink up when they were machine washed. The only flaw with these is they run small. I ordered the kids size 10 and these are more like a size 5-6 so I gave them to my l’il girl instead of my boy. I am glad that these are made with more cotton than polyester. I'm not sure what the price is on these but I probably wouldn't pay more than $20.00 for them. I would have given them all five stars if the size hadn't run small so they are really nice sweatshirts."
4.0,I luv this bag
4.0,Really enjoy my CoCo mask! Very comfortable to wear!!!
4.0,Very beautiful an must say well made only thing Ordered this for my granddaughter birthday turning 6 for whom I buy clothes for on a regular she’s my girl I could believe how little this skirt was ordered size 6/7 the shirt doable but that skirt no way a seven anything maybe size 4 will be retuning she ain’t getting in that with Vaseline
4.0,"I'm usually an L, sized up to XL based on measurement guides, which fit alright. There was also a weird fold along the seam line on both sides, not sure if it's an isolated issue and/or will go away after a wash.<br />I'm returning it as it is not very flattering, but I guess it could be a body type thing."
4.0,Fits perfectly on my Pebble watch.  Will see how it holds up but for now it looks good and fits good so you can't go wrong with this one.  Should be easier to clean than the leather one that came with the watch.
4.0,I’m 5’7 or 5’8 and 116lbs and a 32B and usually a size 2 in pants. I bought a size large and it fits surprisingly well for having  long torso. It is a bit more rose gold but I absolutely love it!
4.0,"My first pair of mala beads and I quite like them! They smell peaceful, are pretty, and you can move them along a bit on the string, which is nice for remembering where you are in meditation."
4.0,"This is a really cute top and I received it really quickly, but the triangles for your breasts are way too large if you don't have a big chest.  I am a 34B and it didn't look flattering at all-the triangles were so large that they looked silly on me.  It's a really really cute top though - just don't get it if you aren't blessed in the chest area.  I'm giving it to a friend with larger breasts lol.  Very cute though."
4.0,Feathers and price
4.0,I like them...
4.0,"They did clank, with each step.  I  applied a  small drop of super glue on two sides of the gem. No problem."
4.0,The band is super soft. The purple is a little lighter than the original watch face but it still looks good. I didnt like the black part the holds the excess. I wish it was white or purple like the band.
4.0,Glasses were great but the grey colored shown in the picture didn't come in the box
4.0,This is an absolutely lovely dress. The quality of the fabric is high and  the print is beautiful. It's the perfect spring/summer dress. I'm only giving it a 4 star because it does run small. I wear between a M or L and I ordered an XL and it fits like a Medium. Other than that it's gorgeous!
4.0,"Came in organized bags, size was perfect, and it seems like good quality."
4.0,Very small. But still really cute and stylish.
4.0,"This are great just not the color implied in the image. They are blue to ink blue not white to blue. But other than that they feel great, sturdy, durable. Great product."
4.0,"Little odd fitting, but still looks amazing!"
4.0,Was very thick and pretty. However it was itchy. Only needed it for Halloween so would definitely recommend to people who only want to wear it for a short time.
4.0,My son wears a size 5 shoe and has chunky feet.  I bought size 5-6.5 and they fit him just right.  They don't have a lot of stretch so I highly doubt that this size would fit a size 6.5 toddler unless they have very thin feet.  He's a fairly new walker and he gets around just fine in these.
4.0,Love the color of the case and protects the phone pretty well.
4.0,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL SHOE.  I STARTED WEARING IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO.  I AM A WOMAN WITH VERY FLAT FEET, AND I CAN WALK AROUND ALL DAY WITH THIS SHOE WITH VERY LITTLE PROBLEM.  I WISH I COULD FIND A SIMILAR DRESS SHOE THAT WOULD DO THE SAME FOR ME OR EVEN CLOSE.  THIS IS TRULY A GREAT WALKING SHOE FOR ME."
4.0,Very pretty one pair was too tight but the other pairs fit perfectly
4.0,Not soft leather but should wear well.
4.0,"Adorable shoes, my daughter loves them... so much that after about 60 days of use the Velcro is detaching from the steams. I will still buy them again... 4 year olds are rough on shoes"
4.0,I like the bag and it is very well made.  This bag will last for years.
4.0,"Small fit. I got the large but fits more like s medium, but usually women's fit tees will do that. Short in the sleeve. Maroon is fitting for the character! I love this for errands and laundry day, it's my inside joke!"
4.0,Umbrella met expectations
4.0,I am 5’2” and 100 lbs. I got a size small and it is a little loose around my waist. It is knee length. The neck line is a tiny bit low but it looks good with a tank top under it. The lace top is very pretty with a little shine to it and the skirt is nice and flowy with more of a matte finish. The color is a maroon red. It’s a beautiful dress for a great price.
4.0,Haven't travelled with it yet but super soft and roomy.
4.0,P good
4.0,"This necklace is lovely, but the solitaire does tend to tip forward. I would like it much better if the bottom thickness was greater than the top so that it didn’t tend to point downward. The chain is perfect for it, and I love that the pendant is heavy enough that the catch doesn’t move on my neck — it stays at my nape."
4.0,Beautiful skirt! Material is better than I thought! However I would go up a size...
4.0,"They hold my socks up quite well. I do have one complaint however, the little plastic teeth, in the clamps, have snagging bits on them from when they were cast.  I filed the little bits off and now the garters are perfect."
4.0,I am giving this item 4 stars because the length of the bar is too long for my ear and I can't seem to unscrew the back if the arrow. The point is easily unscrew-able and at times it become very loose. It looks really cool in the picture and it looks the same in person.  So that's a plus. I would recommend it to anyone who  has a large ear and doesn't plan to mix and march their earrings.
4.0,"It doesn't quite look like the picture, I'm guessing it was a high flash camera shot.  The buckle is smaller than I was hoping since it has words on it and all but.... fits my belt nicely and I wear it with pride!"
4.0,"My bad I ordered XL I'm 38inches chest measure,  the dress is pretty, the color fades after a wash, doesn't shrink or anything, I even use the drier trying to make it smaller, but nope... It doesn't shrink. So my fault I should order a size smaller."
4.0,"It's totally cute, looks as pictured. The problem is that it was too large around the waist for me. I'm pretty narrow though that region. If it had run smaller, I would've kept it for sure."
4.0,Any Shining fan will dig it!!
4.0,My son wanted this sweater very badly so i bought it despite the reviews. Its not the highest quality but all the seams are intact and he loves it. It definitely runs small. I ordered an XXL for a 14 yr old and it fit perfect.
4.0,I'm wearing this with my cover band to dress up for gigs.  Hard to beat for the relatively low cost
4.0,Cute but be careful!!! Made in china could be lead!!! Would wash hands after handling and keep away from mouth!!! Chain seems ok!!!
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my nephew. He loved it and was so excited for it. It fot him a little big as I expected it to but that was an easy fix due to the adjustable back.
4.0,Very well made and very cheap
4.0,"I'm always nervous buying clothes online (especially since I'm 6ft tall) but this dress was so cute, I had to buy it. Luckily it fits like a dream! The only downside is that the top is a little see-through so I have to wear something under it. Love the dress though!"
4.0,I like the flare of these blouses
4.0,"I really like the pants but the thigh area was way too small. Also, it had a chemical smell, and it was somewhat stiff. It's good material but it doesn't stretch.  It will look great on a straight legged person, but for a curvy girl like me I will need a size up."
4.0,works really well -I use this for my swim goggles and I finally can see the end of the pool
4.0,"I bought this to use as a therapy bag for work. I have a much bigger bag on wheels that I use but I needed something smaller when the big Mamma Jamma wasn't warranted. This bag is super. It takes a beating and can hold a surprising amount weight and materials. If something gets spilled on it- it wipes right off. I don't like how the opening to the bag is smaller, would be perfect if it was more of a rectangle shape vs fishbowl shape but it's cheap and functional. Added bonus that the handles are wider and don't cut into the shoulder."
4.0,when I received this it looks like it would be a printed t-shirt but its polyester and it does stretch I personally don't like the material but all my friends do and have borrowed it. The price is awesome and it held up to the laundry. All good
4.0,"I liked it, but it was too small.  We ordered another one in the next size and was a little big but otherwise they are nice shirts.  My husbands been losing weight and started wearing large but we had to get xlarge."
4.0,"Some of them do not close correctly. I fixed them with a pair if pliers. They are comfortable to wear, feel substantial with out being heavy. The hoops are just the right size, not too big or small"
4.0,"Very nice ring, true to size."
4.0,"What I like about these glasses the most is the quality, they are very well constructed and don't feel cheap in my hand or when I am wearing them. This is my favorite style, and are a nice balance between masculine and feminine. These are kind of retro but cool at the same time, in any event, I like them a lot. They are a little small on my face, but fit my girlfriend perfectly. I have a feeling that I won't have them for long and they will end up in her sunglass stash."
4.0,This is a fun set. I wear it on date night with a little dress or to work with a suit.
4.0,"I feel like these boots look more like men's boots on me. I get many compliments. Hubby has the same boots but in blue, and they look much better on him! Fuzzy inside, and very comfortable."
4.0,"Full elastic waist jogging shorts made of 93% Polyester and 7% spandex.<br /><br />Super lightweight, very comfortable. Perfect for jogging because they have a reflective stripes on the side.<br /><br />What’s really unique about these shorts is the zippered pocket on the back.<br /><br />Perfect shorts for jogging and working out."
4.0,My husband is happy with this summer shirt and I think it looks great on him.
4.0,This is a cute accessory to have my only complaint is the super thin chain but you get what you pay for.
4.0,Too tight but I still wear it. Also a little see-through.
4.0,"I'm usually a medium so that's what I ordered. It's a bit loose especially around the arm pit but I decided to keep it anyway. The fabric is soft and beautiful. It's a well made dress. I'm 5 ft and 130 lbs. if you're my size, I suggest ordering a small."
4.0,"This is a great coat, my daughter loved it when she tried it on, but we had to return it because it runs very small. She is 11, currently wears a size 10 and is gradually moving to a 12 so I ordered the Medium listed as a 10/12 and we could barely zip it up. It was super fitted with just a T-shirt underneath. We ordered the large and hopefully that fits better."
4.0,I like the sunglasses strap. They are a little too short but can still use them. Good price
4.0,smaller than i thought
4.0,"I bought  a brown and a black belt and the black belt uses the same brown leather trim as the brown belt.  I bought these braided belt because all the leather belts that I tried the last couple of years showed fold/stress next to the belt hole that I was using after a few weeks even the ones sold under Levi, Dockers and Dickie brands  I used to able to find leather belts that lasted 5 to 10 years.  Since you can decide how tight or loose you want a braid belt can be used, the fit is always perfect and braided belt will not show folds or other age marks like leather belts.  I wear a 31 inch pants and the &#34;small&#34; work well even your waist is a couple inch small or bigger than that."
4.0,"Nice socks, good fit"
4.0,"5.7'  157#  L/XL  good fit,  but the open crotch is too large ....goes done my thighs almost 5"".  Guess I should be happy I can ""go"" without wetting the garment or taking it off!"
4.0,It's a little tighter than I'd like but it did the job.
4.0,I lost it before I even had the chance to wear it. It was beautiful but I had to order a different set unfortunately.
4.0,"The arms are a bit long on this, but I am pleasantly surprised how much I like it!  I look forward to cooler weather so I can wear it.  The color will be great for Fall weather!"
4.0,I really liked this cover up. I will be buying more in the future....!
4.0,Great boots. My granddaughter loves it.
4.0,Love the set however the earring posts are not secure or fasten tightly to remain on the ear if bumped slightly. The other pieces are nice.
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter, she is making little coin bags and wanted to put these on the end of the zippers. They worked out just great."
4.0,Stormy Kromer makes great products and I like the Jac shirt but I think it was over priced for the weight of it. I still kept it and like wearing it but I think a $99 price tag is more reasonable.
4.0,"I read that this blouse ran small and I’m sure it does. I normally wear a size 8, which is normally considered a medium, so I went up to a size 10. When it arrived, the size said simply x-large. It’s a little large, but a smaller size may not fit. Other than that, I love it.  Odd note is the blouse came in a plain cellophane wrapping. No brand name and I found the size on an inside seam."
4.0,"Way to small. I ordered it a size up and still couldn't get it over my shoulders. Returned it. Updating my review to be more specific. The dress itself was very nice; my spouse really like it, too. Initially I gave it one star due to the fit but realize that the rating should reflect the product a little better. It definitely was way too small. There was no tag inside the dress to verify I received the right size; I feel like the wrong size was sent but not sure. The company did reach out to me and were so very kind and considerate. They went out of their way to see what they could do to correct the issue. Unfortunately the event I originally bought the dress for had already passed."
4.0,"These are the best bras I have had in a long time. They fit well and compliment me in my clothes.  They are sturdy, comfortable and hold me up well.  I did have to order 38DD when usually wear 36DD but I was not disappointed.  I will be buying more of these bras very soon."
4.0,What I mean by somewhat small is That they were a bit short didn’t quite reach the top of my leg but very good quality
4.0,"I wanted these tank tops for summer instead of the t-shirt version of this. It's very nice material and complements both me and my friend's figures. It fits just a tad snug, but considering I take a medium in Junior and this was a junior size I got a med. anyway. If you want it loose fitting I recommend going up one size. I like my shirts snug so this was perfect. I'm only giving this four stars because, for some reason there are two dim white lines on both sides of the shirts near the armpits. I thought for a second it was my deodorant when I tried it on, but it couldn't be because it was on both shirts. It looks almost like a light elastic line. You can't really notice it unless you're looking for it or staring at it, I don't know if it's part of the fabric or what, but it's okay. My friend and I will definitely be wearing these together when we go places."
4.0,Christmas present for my daughter
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:290ced88432647f69589c413b1287558]] For the price this dress is super cool! Lol<br />I like the interesting waistline detail, though you can see in my video it could use to be taken in some in that area. I am usually a true S and I would say this dress is probably best suited to my body when I gain a little and end up in the S-M range.<br />Soft double-lined linen-y fabric that might be minorly see through in lighter colors, but black is all good.<br />The elasticated tie at the collar is the only thing I don’t love, it’s just there. For the price I got it, I say jump on your princess dress girl!"
4.0,"They seem to slip off my visor when removing my sunglasses, ood for the price though!"
4.0,Thinner then expected. More like a jegging material then jeans
4.0,Great little shirt for the price
4.0,OK but looks like a bandaid!
4.0,"After reading an article on TheWireCutter about packing cubes, I tried some. Rather than digging through a packed suitcase for socks or T-shirts, I know that I can easily find the cube that has those items and get right to it. I honestly would rather stay home than travel for a two week trip and have all my clothes stuffed into a bag without cubes.<br /><br />These Bagvio cubes are nice. They look nice and are well made. The zippers are top notch quality. The stitching is good and should last. The fabric is lightweight - which is a mixed quality - they don't add much weight to your luggage, but they also flop around a bit and might not last for many many trips.<br /><br />The larger Bagvio cube has a partial mesh window so you can see what is inside. The smaller cube is solid, so no clue what it contains. I prefer packing cubes that easily show what is inside."
4.0,"At first it looks too small but expands to fit just fine. True to size, good fabric and comfortable."
4.0,We bought these as an accessory for a school play and it worked out nicely. :)
4.0,Looks just as picture. Fits as expected.
4.0,Very pretty and comfortable dress.  Shoot i had a coke bottle shape in this dress!  I was pleased with the length but I had issues with the chest cutout.  It didn't sit below my breast so I sewed it up a bit so my friends wouldn't pop out through it.  I ordered a XL but I could have ordered a large due to the stretch in the dress.  1 am 5'8 and 200 pds.
4.0,Love it - just wish the longer strap was just a bit longer but it works very well to have hands free when shopping and not having to dig your phone out of your pursue when it starts to ring.
4.0,runs big order a size down.
4.0,Este artículo supera a todos los anteriores que he adquirido. Permanentemente me hace recordar que debo tener una buena postura.
4.0,"This pretty is well made for the price. The size runs pretty small, particularly in the arms. It’s wearable, but I won’t be hugging anyone unless a want to rip the back."
4.0,Also bought a set for my mother and my daughter. They were bigger than I expected and look nice.
4.0,Nice quality. Lace is beautiful. Just runs a little small.
4.0,"The shirt itself is very look. I think it would look cute with a blazer or cardigan, but it's very long. I am short (5'0 ft) and short waisted. This nearly covers my butt. It's a tad bigger than I thought it would be. Check the size chart."
4.0,Cute earrings.  I couldn't tell if they were see through when I ordered but they are and it creates a really cool effect.  They're not too big or too small for dangle earrings.  I'd buy again.
4.0,"It has a weird fit, maybe my head is just too small for it I don't know. It's cute and warm tho! Fast shipping :)"
4.0,"This just arrived (overnight without paying extra!) and I love the color, print and extremely soft material but it's cut much too small. It's a sheath, essentially, and somewhat clingy and stretchy. So, while it does fit, it's unforgiving of curves and bulges. I normally wear a large (5'6.5"" and 170 lbs) so ordered an extra large hoping it would be roomy but it's close fitting instead. I want roominess in a sleep shirt/nightgown so am hoping this will stretch as it's worn since I don't feel like the hassle of returning it."
4.0,"Dress is asked described, nice material not too thin. I'm 5'3 with hips& thighs but it definitely accentuates your shape."
4.0,I had to return because it runs small but once I got the right size it is really a warm and comfy sweatshirt.
4.0,Very cute. Easy to hang. Holds a lot with no problem
4.0,"Wore dress on vacation. Nice, cool, loose and perfect for the occasion. Shoulder straps could be a little shorter. Unable to adjust to a comfortable spot but wearable."
4.0,"Great item for the price. If you scratch, break or lose a pair, just grab the next pair."
4.0,"Very cute. Slightly too small for my wayfairer type prescription glasses though - it closes, but no room for a glasses wipe as well."
4.0,"Great summer bathrobe, much too light weight for winter so order for warmer climate or save for summer."
4.0,Very cute dress but I gave it a 4 star because it doesn’t fit that great around my boob area since I have big boobs. I still love it though and will put it in great us for this fall season.
4.0,Impressed with its performance considering the price so cheap!
4.0,4 stars because lense edges a lil chipped from being cut to shape..<br />Took over a month to deliver via China
4.0,"This is a cheap leather. Be careful of zippers.. can not fit as much into as I wanted, but all in all I like it. Was looking for something bigger. I am using it tho.. lots of cc space. zipper area for coins. Has everything except phone directory space.. or planner space.<br />Good value."
4.0,Bought these after a recommendation and they really are so comfortable and fairly supportive. I love that the pads aren’t removable but that also means needing extra time to dry after washing. Personally I won’t wear with a fitted shirt because I feel like I need more support but those days are rare especially in colder weather
4.0,For weekends
4.0,"I’m tall, so it’s just a little short on me. Other than that great."
4.0,"It is what it says it is and does what it says it does, but it seems to be a bit overpriced for what it is and what it does."
4.0,Un poco ajustado
4.0,"I ordered a size medium. I am 5'5 and weigh 135 lbs, it fit perfectly. The fabric is a bit thin but there is a white lining that covers your underwear and the white lining doesn't show through the outfit, so it's okay.  The waist kinda sits funny so I had to put a belt to cover it. Maybe if it was a large it would drape better. The only problem that I had was with the shipping. Apparently the package was lost and I was asked if I wanted a refund which I received, but somehow the package was delivered anyway, AFTER I bought another outfit from another seller. That part was a bit frustrating. Pic is attached."
4.0,"This is what I was looking for. This is a cute cardigan that is soft, thin, and comfortable to wear. I am 5'2&#34;, and it reaches to a little under my butt. I can comfortably slide the sleeves to cover all but my fingertips. My only problem with this cardigan is that the holes for the buttons to be put through seem quite delicate, and there are a few loose strings here and there. I will make sure to be careful while buttoning and simply cut off the loose strings. Thanks!"
4.0,"Looks a little awkward on my head, but it looks pretty cool....."
4.0,"This item is perfect in size and cost. The material breaths and keeps the compression around my thighs comfortable. Not to tight, exactly what I wanted."
4.0,"So far I like the tallit.  I haven't had a chance to use it but right off the bat the fabric doesn't seem as soft as I would like it to be.  It is large enough, which is great, and it is what I expected.  When mine came in the mail I know before I use it I will need to lightly iron it to get rid of fold seams.  The bag that hold it is really nice! I almost think more effort and thought went into the bag than did the actual tallit!  The bag is soft with a really nice interior lining.  The messianic seal on the bag is embroidered.  I with the seals on the tallit were embroidered as well.  Instead they are a shinny fabric.  The nicest part about the tallit that I really like is the crown on top.  The inscription is beautifully done, but again I with it were embroidered.  For the price this is a great tool for anyone's prayer life and I look forward to using it!  There are places they could improve but that is the same with anything.  $20 bucks and this is a good value for your dollar."
4.0,Decent product. Would buy again.
4.0,"This is really cute, soft, and what we were expecting.  I can't tell you now how long it will last or if it will pill because it's a gift. Overall happy with purchase. I only gave four stars because if the slight odor it gives off."
4.0,It reach my expectations
4.0,A nice addition to my wife's peace sign collection
4.0,I love it! Fits perfectly love the silk.
4.0,Love these shoelaces!
4.0,They are alittle small but that's the way you want them for mountainbiking they'll feel right for a day but after one ride they'll feel great!
4.0,"Quality of material is good, however the shirt is a tad bit too big around the chest and the sleeves are a little short."
4.0,Fit as expected but is extremely high waisted so you cant wear tight shirts otherwise it looks semi weird.
4.0,"Comfortable, not too tight and not too loose. Wore them right out of the package (literally) on two 7.5 hour flights and my legs were incredibly comfortable. Well worth the investment!"
4.0,"I love the band.  The color and quality is very nice.  After wearing it for the first time it became more flexible.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the buckle.  The extra loop on the top part of the buckle needs to be cut off.  It sticks up and gets caught on things.  Other than the buckle, I really like it."
4.0,"Nice, but I didn’t like the color or length on me.<br />Would like great on a taller and dark toned skin lady 🤗 I am only 5’  and pale skinned😉"
4.0,"Nice dress. I used it as a costume for a musical and it worked just fine for that. Fit is as expected, and the material is a bit more stretchy than you would think."
4.0,"Cute short. They run small, if your daughter is curvy at all they won’t fit ."
4.0,The shoes are feel great except they ride a bit to high and rub on my ankle.
4.0,The top was a bit to big and the bottoms fit just right. I'm 5'4 160lbs 36D in chest size and I ordered a XL.
4.0,very nice and the quality is made very good
4.0,keeps you toasty
4.0,"Very pretty shirt, pretty small for a large. I would say it's about an american small, maybe a medium."
4.0,I wish I'd read the reviews before I ordered this. It's a great top and really inexpensive but you need to choose a size one to two sizes higher than you usually take.
4.0,Would like them to be a bit less heavy<br />Falls down on face
4.0,"I was really surprised to feel how soft the material is and like other reviews I found the dress to be clingy. I would like to see the sleeve length a bit longer and I did not like the skinny belt but,  I am impressed with the overall  quality for the price. I ordered a medium and it's a perfect fit, I am 5 '5&#34; and 140, I have an hourglass shape and this dress accents  it quite nicely. I ordered grey, red, and blue...the grey is made of a somewhat heavier material and is about 2&#34; shorter than the red and blue. I will order in other colors too. The shipping took a very long time but, I recommend this dress without hesitation."
4.0,I bought these for my sister for her Birthday.  She loved them!
4.0,And nice looking too! I usually wear a medium but this jacket is generous so I could wear a small comfortably… Really cute for fall transition!!
4.0,Beautiful and stunning necklace. Everything was in tack with no missing pieces.
4.0,"Texture 5/5<br />Style 5/5<br />Sizing is perfect for someone with small breasts tbh<br />I'm a 32DDD so it fits but I have to wear my tightest sports bra to flatten myself down so that the sweatshirt fits like it sort of should. I also bought a large and am only 5' 3"" and the sleeves are a bit short too like they roll up and rest on my forearms. So it's weird lol however it's super cute and hopefully once I lose a bit of weight the biddies will shrink and the sweater will be more comfy. Hope this helps!"
4.0,"I really love this umbrella but I'm concerned about the crank. It is VERY hard to crank and several reviewers reported that theirs had broken. Hoping for the best.  Otherwise it's a great umbrella and we have enjoyed it, especially the lights."
4.0,"I like these, I don't LOVE them, but I ""like"" them..... they are pretty and just the right size.  I gave them 4 stars because the way they fashioned the moonstone into a teardrop like shape, it honestly looks more like a large piece of white or clear plastic!  You can't tell that it's moonstone simply because of how it is fashioned on the piece.  They are ok otherwise.  They are hook backs, so you need a plastic holder to keep from losing them.  I couldn't have known how the moonstone would look in person, so  this is no one's fault.  I'll keep them, possibly wear, or give as a gift."
4.0,I bought this for my friend and his boyfriend. I would give it a 5 star if it would have been just a little bit bigger. But all in all this gift exceeded what I expected for the price i bought it for. If your looking to buy a gift for yourself or a gay guy friend who's is secretive about his sexuality this a great way to be proud of being gay without it being super out there.
4.0,"The bag of horse charms is pleasantly surprising. Even with accessories, like horse shoes, there were plenty of well defined and solid figures of horses and matching doubles. All in all, it is a good purchase"
4.0,Shoes extremely comfortable size on point very comfortable to walk and did the boardwalk in Atlantic City Approximately five hours and no pain but five hours was all I got before they separated I would really love a perfectly functional pair but we’ll see what his review does because I can get back on here LOL everybody wonderful day I don’t know but still you shine especially not the shoes
4.0,Cute tank! Runs a bit small though.  Usually wear a medium and it fits more like a small.
4.0,The bottoms didn't close tight enough to avoid running up. Otherwise just fine.
4.0,They’re amazing 😉 but it they Don’t have the Nike smoosh
4.0,"I read others reviews that this runs a bit small so I ordered a 2x to be on the safe side, fits like a large would"
4.0,On the fence about this sweater . Great colors and quality seems good. Fit is a bit weird. I’m usually a medium but got XL bc I wanted more tunic length but it’s not that big. Pretty boxy and the sleeves are an odd length.. not really 3/4 . It held up well after wash and is nice and soft so I kept it .
4.0,"Pretty, good quality chain. I wish the clasp was stronger but it is average for chains I have seen in jewelry departments in stores."
4.0,"Super cute, thick material, and comfortable. I thought this size was a 5in inseam but feel more like a 2”. I still love them! Pockets are my favorite! Grab these you won’t regret it."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Size seems a bit off, but it fits nicely."
4.0,Bought it for a Halloween costume. Worked well
4.0,"It's nicely constructed and attractive. I can imagine myself in 1890's London carrying a sterling silver case to hold my calling cards! Of course, it's not sterling silver, but it is nice. The only problem is on the inside. You push the button and the case springs open. Each side can hold a number of cards and they're held in place by a non-removable elastic strap. However, the metal edges are rolled inward. They're not sharp or dangerous, but you can't simply slide a card out. I often have to get a fingernail underneath the top card and pry it out. But, like other things, sometimes you have to put up with small annoyances to look cool."
4.0,We used them for our children as mask holders. They held up great and we washed them often.
4.0,I love the outfit and it made me feel sexy and the  material is very soft and stretchy and got  A lot of compliments
4.0,Easy to use and seems to protect well while I am working in the yard and and walking the dog. Does keep perspiration inside which affected the climbing function - giving me lots of flights! I cut a small notch over the sensor and it has worked correctly since then. Might be an easy design fix.
4.0,"Great $6 gift to myself. It is a little loose. Would rather have a clip, instead of putting a long silver piece through a circle."
4.0,Its a very nice purse but the strap is too short to put up on your shoulder and the purse itself is heavy before putting anything in it. But it's well made and very sharp
4.0,I really love the top and I'm going to keep that but the other reviews said it were aren't really big so I ordered a few sizes up and it's way too big..I would just recommend ordering one size up
4.0,"Very nice rashie, but the sleeves run a little tight. My forearm split the stitching about 2 weeks into the purchase"
4.0,"nice looking, seem to stretch out a bit and stay that way"
4.0,"It’s much bigger than I thought it would be, but I still like it"
4.0,Went on a cruise and flew across the country and these held up. Got banged up a bit but just exterior scratches. Maybe more visible depending on c Lot you get but so far I would recommend these
4.0,I wish I would have ordered a size bigger.
4.0,"This shirt is beautiful.  Look carefully at the measurements before you order.  The fabric has no stretch so take that into consideration,  I ordered the largest size..getting it on and off is a challenge but it fits  once its on."
4.0,"In pink,  I didn't like it. The pink is a salmon color and it was extremely wrinkled and the fabric seemed different from the one I ordered in grey. I LOVED THE GREY ONE....the pink no so much.  I'm only rating this item a 4 because of the inconsistency in the fabric."
4.0,"Nice shoes, good quality.  Keeps feet nice & warm.  My 7-year old daughter loves them!"
4.0,Length and fit is great. It's just the waist band that doesn't have alot of stretch.
4.0,perfect fit and durable
4.0,I bought this as a gift for a bridal shower. The bride loves camo and loved it.  The quality was excellent.  The shipping was fast they shipped it within hours of ordering  (I selected standard shipping.) Overall a great product.
4.0,Love the color of this purse.  My only complaint would be the opening is kind of small.
4.0,"This light pink dress is so adorable, our daughter is about 30 inches tall and it fit her length very well. It was slightly see through, we put a white diaper cover under it and it looked really good. The light pink color is a true light pink in the tulle but the see though material under that has a slight peach pink color to it."
4.0,"Sizing was a tad bigger than “normal” (whatever “normal” is these days! Lol) but not so much that I’m returning them. I’m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars for the color. The ad picture clearly shows a light pink/mauve, but the shoes I got are definitely your regular mauve coloring - which I’m okay with, but it’s quite noticeable. Otherwise, they’re cute, comfy to wear and I would recommend."
4.0,"This is my second corset purchase from this company. I'm very happy with both purchases.This time I went for the lace. I wanted to have  a little more sex appeal. My hubby is a sucker for lace. What a great bonus.<br />The Women's Lace Trimmed Elastic Mesh Fabric Corset, fit as expected. This time around I went for a size larger than the previous one. This one fits like a glove. The lace design is very intricate and is only right on the front side of the corset. I was kind of hoping that the lace would have covered a little more area. It has a large wide panel in the front with three rows of hooks that you can make adjustments as needed, either from gaining or loosing weight, even water retention can make a difference. I'm thankful to be able to make these types of adjustments as my weight tends to fluctuate between 5 to 10 lbs here and there. With holiday time coming this is going to come in handy, I'll be able to wear what I want with out the worry and hassle of struggling with the buttons on my pants.<br />This product was either given to me for free or I purchased it at an extremely discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,They're nice! I have a small adult woman's head and they fit fine. A little bit tight. They also fit my 5yr old autistic son well too. We have had the baby banz for years now and they were super tight-especially in the beginning. I think they've finally broke in but these are slightly looser which I think is a good thing. They seem like they'll hold up well. You can still hear through them as you can all others. But it's extremely helpful when going places that are very stimulating and for fireworks. I also like the bright colors.
4.0,They fit fine and I always get tons of looks (pun intended) and comments. Don't wear these if you don't want to stand out in the crowd!
4.0,"This is a very good watch, little hard to work inthe beginning, now that I have it all down , its very useful,  very strong.  One con alarm can be louder  that all i have so thank"
4.0,Small fits like a medium. Otherwise it was a nice dress. Very elegant. Perhaps a clip to the back of the neck would be better for easier removal.
4.0,Very good will buy again
4.0,"I absolutely love the way this shirt looks when I wear it, but the reason I docked a star was because you MUST buy the next size up if you are wanting the top to fit similar to the featured product picture. Luckily I had read some previous reviews before purchasing and did buy the next size up and I could not be happier. Overall I am very pleased with the look, material, price, and crisp white color. It was exactly what I was looking for!"
4.0,Great leggings for the price. Very stretchy and confortable.
4.0,Very cool glasses for fun! They look like the original Gazelle glasses from the 80-90's! I wore them to a 90's themed party.  Got tons of compliments.
4.0,"It  looks nice, but it's smaller than I was expecting  I was able to use my hands to gently force the rings open a bit more so it would fit my ring finger,but I'm afraid of breaking it. A neat item but definitely not for every-day wear."
4.0,"I went into this order knowing what was going to happen.<br /><br />These are definitely just a thin mesh layer of polyester.  Therefore, they are soft, light and simple.  The pockets are on the small side.<br /><br />So, measurements - 5'4&#34;, between 29 and 30&#34; below the waist/above the hips.  I bought a medium. These just fit me.  Just. Next pair, I'm going a size larger.  I want them a tad baggier.<br /><br />When standing, these do not hit my knee.  They also cannot be put in the dryer.  But I am partial to trousers and shorts with side stripes so I'm liking these.  Going to buy another pair."
4.0,"The skirt is so cute ! & the fabric is really good quality. I ordered a small but it fit a little too bit on my waist but regardless the length was absolutely perfect. Although, I did not like how the skirt sticks to my legs like creating some time of friction."
4.0,Warm and comfortable! Would buy again.
4.0,Christmas gift and he loved it
4.0,Fits well and is a great dress. Material is soft and silky feeling. Pattern is beautiful and true to picture.
4.0,"Eh. Not the compression I was wanting. But my arms feel pretty cool. And my arms do tan really easily so even when I'm outside doing my workout or doing yard work my arms will always get darker. So I naturally have a farmers tan. The compression is also nice because it can help muscle soreness. But, if it was a SLIGHTLY bit more compressive (if that's even a word) I would be happier."
4.0,I like these gloves. They are warm and comfortable.
4.0,"Great value. Good quality. Delicate packaging.<br />It’s not a huge shoulder bag but a cute size big enough to put in all my personal stuff and a book. It also fits a few diapers and baby wipes and a small sippy cup, so it also works as my petite diaper bag(without bottles)<br />Love the green color. Might get another one, purple maybe. A perfect bag for what I was looking for."
4.0,"Not amazing, not bad though"
4.0,great light weight!
4.0,Perfect replacement check valve but priced too high. Arrived quickly.
4.0,Normal stuff
4.0,"made well, but as I said way to large on the bottom."
4.0,Great looking socks but a little tight to get on but very comfortable once they are on
4.0,My daughter loved it. It didn't fit me.
4.0,Luv it!! I've bought 4!!
4.0,"This dress fit very nicely when I was standing, but when I sat down the material around the chest would not stay in place and I was constantly readjusting to avoid flashing all in view. That aside, great pattern and the material is breathable for hot weather."
4.0,nice enough glasses good at night. just recently realized that they are polarized. took a computer monitor for me to see it but they have a light polarization. do cut glare some in the early morning and while pretty big not over-whelming.
4.0,it was just like you see it. already got lots of comments......Thanks
4.0,Great scent and does pour out quickly so that you use too much at once.
4.0,Slightly different colors however beautiful and I told everyone where I receive my necklace from when I receive comments about it.
4.0,Love them. Quite fabulous.
4.0,Quite pretty! No problems with the length and sizing. Very flowy and lots of room for draping effect. Only problem with the cut is that the armpits are a tiny bit low and bra shows a little-- I got mine in black and a black bra easily camouflages. Very easily wrinkles.
4.0,Fit perfect everywhere but the bust. A little to snug which then made shoulder area sit funny.
4.0,Great fitment. Optical quality seems lower than original polarized lenses. Will update after some use.
4.0,"Substantial case, pretty aesthetically.  Arrived as promised"
4.0,I liked this dress I got three of then in different prints.
4.0,I tried this on my 5 year old in the north face store. I am glad i did. She is quite small but the size small fit her well. I ordered the kokomo green and it is much darker than the picture. I am disappointed in the color being so dark but it's still a great beanie and will keep her head warm. Lined with fleece and looks cute.
4.0,"We have a wood stove and 30 acres of land. My husband cuts and hauls a lot of firewood. He is always on the hunt for quality work gloves. Out if the bag, these seemed great. However, the stitching of the palm liners started coming loose from the thumb after the first use. It hasn't happened more, but definitely only 4 stars. Maybe 3 if they continue to fail."
4.0,Arrived folded in fourths. Still have the crease lines showing but otherwise a very nice hat. I use it often.
4.0,This is a nice piece to have and the price is so low.  It's just like it's pictured.
4.0,Cute! Very light material. Fits right
4.0,"The material is stretchy yet stiff.  (I wear a size 4/6).  I ordered a size up - medium, initially.  The dress is longer than I prefer - below the knee; almost mid calf (I'm 5'6"").  The dress fit well in the chest and waist (a little loose in waist, but I typically have to alter all clothing in the waist);  fit rather tightly in hips/glutes area & the zipper bunches up & doesn't  lie flat, so I ordered another dress, different color in a large - the dress was too big overall, so I took it to be altered and the zipper issue was the same - bunched and caused dress to pucker in back - it's not a size issue - its the stitching.  I've not worn either even though I've had them altered (to re-do the zipper would have to restructure the dress, so I'd wear them in a pinch, but don't think I'd order this particular one again)."
4.0,Nice sized keychain. I can put on my wrist when out shopping. Nice design.
4.0,"The locket is cute, but the clasp to hold it to the chain is poorly constructed making it easy to detach and the locket is nearly impossible for the average fingernail to open."
4.0,The pink was not the same as the picture but overall it was a great fit.
4.0,"Nice bag, a little smaller than expected"
4.0,"I have thick wide feet with high arches so finding a sandal that fits and doesn't kill my feet after wearing them for more than 30 mintutes is next to impossible. These are fantastic! They are plenty wide enough and the foam material, while strong, is also stretchy enough to accommodate my thicker feet. The arch support is so nice! I have ridiculously high arches and to find a sandal with ANY arch support is rare let alone one with this much! They are light but thick-soled enough not to feel every rock you step on unlike many other shoes of similar material. I would recommend these to anyone with foot problems looking for a lightweight sandal for the summer. So comfy and light and easy to clean!"
4.0,"Fits great my son loved it, however it faded after a few months."
4.0,"Love the chain of the bag, it is the perfect length. The inside will hold all your basic necessities and it doesnt look bulky. Love the gold tones, it making look expensive. From afar the leather also looks real as well"
4.0,"I like this blouse a lot.  The color that I chose, Pink, arrived the shade that it was in the pictures.  It has kind of a high neck, except then there's a narrow V.  So it's kind of unique looking.  It fit well.  I normally wear size 6-8, and I got this in a Medium.  The body isn't sheer--I wore a teal bra under it for the pictures and it was NOT see through at all.  The arms are sheer but with little polka dots.  Very cute.  The sleeves are a bit weird, they end like 2 inches above the wrist so it sorta looks like they are too short, lol.  On me, at least.<br /><br />This looks great with jeans and also for the office.  Definitely 4 big stars!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, would have expected slightly more cushion in a memory foam slipper."
4.0,I wore these light sensitivity glasses for about an hour while using my cell phone. I generally keep my screen's light on low. I dialed it up a bit to test these out. They definitely evened out the glare from the screen. The lightweight frame made them comfortable to wear. The tint is a cute pinkish purple in person.
4.0,This slide is very small compared to other slides I have ordered.  IT is cute but smaller than I expected.  I should have paid more attention to the description.
4.0,"Excellent fit, thin to wear in the summer yet complements continuously! Good one"
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this one. I ordered a large, the halter top has an adjustable neck but not back so I didn’t think it would fit but it did fairly well. The bottom is a higher rise which I just find more flattering on my shape. I’ll be wearing this one"
4.0,"This is a really nice necklace for the price (&#60; 30$). It has a good weight and color and looks really nice on, coming down to rest an inch or two below my collarbones.  The clasp feels cheaply made, but it's large and look pretty secure.  I don't think I realized how large 16mm diameter really was until I got this, and I feel like I could wear something smaller and get the same impact.  With the larger pearls, this is definitely a statement necklace."
4.0,Good buy. Don't feel cheap but the rubber grips for the arms are slowly sliding off. Worth the purchase compared to most expensive sunglasses out there
4.0,Great quality very nice. But runs a size small
4.0,"From the very first time I wore it, it felt very nice against my skin. As a 6' guy, I would've wished the size to be slightly bigger but it is perfect for everyday use."
4.0,My friend gave this to my gf as a gift.  It is an<br />adorable and cute earring for Christmas time! Match different clothing easily. Looks amazing on pictures. I am happy with the product.
4.0,"The pants fit fine but they are not low rise on me.  I am very short in the torso, so it comes closer to being at my waist vs riding on the hips.....just keep this in mind when ordering if you are short in the torso.  I normally wear a 6 so based on the site info that the pants run small, I ordered a 7 and it fit just fine.  The length comes right to the top of the foot which is where I prefer it.  I plan on ordering another brand to try and get something that rides lower on me.........I think by looking at the pictures more carefully, you can see in the pics if the pants are especially low riding or average low riding.  I could tell by looking at the Wax pics they might not be low enough based on my body shape, so overall they fit pretty much like I expected based on the pics."
4.0,These shoes work very well for the price. My daughters dance 5 days a week and they have held up pretty well.  They say they are very comfortable but like most dance shoes do run small I would order at least 1 to 2 sizes bigger than you need.
4.0,"What irritates me is getting stuff that fits just right... until you wash it! I even hung it dry, but it still shrunk. Why don't the clothing makers pre-shrink their materials?!?! It's not terrible but enough to annoy me"
4.0,"I use this as a prop in photo shoots. It is exactly what it is advertised to be, and it arrived on time."
4.0,It is a little more yellow-y than it shows in the photos but I still like it
4.0,Promt delivery. Not quite as soft as I would have hoped but still comfortable.  Snaps are easy for older person to handle.
4.0,"5 stars for construction. If you have wide shoulders this is not for you though. I can get it on, but there is no range of motion across the shoulders."
4.0,I bought this for my aunt for Christmas who loves horses. The necklace is pretty good quality; the chain is woven but it seems pretty sturdy and it's very long. The emblem is large and very nice; my aunt loved it. The only thing that would make it better is if the chain was made of a nicer material.
4.0,"First off, it was not for me— just not flattering on my body but I won’t let that affect the review.<br /><br />Pros: cute summer dress, very colorful<br />Thick fabric<br /><br />Cons: a bit see-through on the bottom which is why it loses a star. The fabric is kind of reminiscent of a Halloween costume so I’m not sure how long it would hold up"
4.0,pretty cool and fit nicely
4.0,I love them they are cute and comfortable and they were to me within 3 days of ordering. Only thing I've had a problem with is they run a little small!
4.0,"They are a little sheer , but they fit really good."
4.0,Ordered a small and they are baggy on me. For reference I’m 5’2 and 100lbs
4.0,"It's very shiny and pretty but definitely feels cheaper to the touch than other jewelry. However, the clasp works well, and makes a great MOH gift."
4.0,"Very warm, but the fabric and design are are stiff, so when I sit I to read or paint I have to unzip. But I still like it. Wear it a lot. Plenty of pockets."
4.0,Love the product I wear it a lot more than most snap backs
4.0,The length was too long for extra small. 52 inches would have been better.
4.0,"I use it for fishing to get the sun off my face and still be able to breath. Fit slightly large but it might just be me, the hat provides plenty of face and neck shade without making your head sweat. Thinking about getting another one soon."
4.0,"I love the dress overall! Only bad thing is i’m short, so the sleeves were a LITTLE long even when i pulled the sleeve all the way to my armpit. But that wont stop the show. Cant wait to wear this dress out!!! Fits perfect. I got an XL so it wouldn’t be toooo tight."
4.0,works as intended
4.0,I have very small wrists and this watch band is huge!!  It’s cute and I wish it came in a smaller size. I will be returning it.
4.0,"just a bit tight, but I like that snug fit. The material is different but I still wear it."
4.0,So cute.  The filter pocket is easy to use.  Does the job.
4.0,"These long sleeve shirts are very lightweight and thin.  Not so great in the cold and meant more for slightly warmer weather.  I found some use for them in that 50-65 range, especially when active or paired with a light jacket.  In colder temps, I find it way too thin to be practical except maybe as a light base layer.  I wore it snowboarding in 35-40 degree temps under a fleece, but its not my first choice.  It is, however, very well ventilated, breathable, fast drying, and fairly comfortable.  A great choice for running or hiking on warm spring/fall days for example.  Thumb loops a plus."
4.0,Looks okay and fits a little odd. I have big boobs so maybe I ordered a size too large. The quality is meh but it's cute under a white tee shirt.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with these shirts' quality and looks. The only issue is to watch out for size conversion. I wear small but to be on the safe side I ordered XL which according to their chart corresponds to Medium US size. I am so glad I went to XL instead of L. I have to mention though, I do not like tight fits and prefer relaxed fit, so it worked out perfectly. The shirts are well made and beautiful. Price is unbeatable."
4.0,"These are cute. A little wider than expected but can't complain, especially for the price!"
4.0,I bought it as a gift for my husband. He really liked the look and the color of the blue.
4.0,"They are okay. Tighter than I expected for a Large, really slim fitting for socks."
4.0,"These are very cute socks, and soft. May have to buy more for Christmas gifts."
4.0,Like it. 1 star short because it did not squeeze in to cling to my wrist
4.0,Very nice . Fits pretty good but a little busty by the chest.
4.0,When I first put it on I thought the design was too mature for me. I planned to remove two of the rows to narrow it down a bit. Then as I tried to decide which 2 rows to remove it was difficult to make a decision because there were details about each row that I liked. One day I wore an outfit that matched perfectly so I wore it and it grew on me. I really liked it and appreciated the workmanship. It fits great and stretches well to fit on my wrist.<br />My only critique is some of the tied off ends could have been cut lower so they don’t show. I’m very pleased.
4.0,Its not bad it actually looks cool
4.0,Beautiful dress. Looks very high end and expensive
4.0,Fits a little snug but very comfortable.
4.0,"The look of this style is kind of clumsy and bulky. Also, the straps adjustable by Velcro. Sort of an old lady feel. But!! These are so, so comfortable. I actually purchased three pairs just because they are so comfortable. I have such trouble finding a shoe that I can wear all day. My feet are happy so it’s worth trading style for comfort."
4.0,It's actually more than I expected.  Very strong looks like 925. It's very small tho.  I have a tiny wrist .
4.0,I liked the dress but runs small
4.0,cute product and fit well!
4.0,"Although I really liked this cardigan, it was more for spring or fall weather because the fabric was fairly thick. If you're looking for a light summer cardigan, keep looking."
4.0,I get so much compliment whenever I wear this brooch.  I love it.<br /><br />Diane S
4.0,"It looks nice, but a bit small. The necklace is 14.5 inches when laid flat, but the beads take about half an inch off the length when worn. My neck is 14 inches around and it's really snug even on the last loop. It'll be ok after I break it in and stretch it out a little.  If your neck is 11.5-13.5 inches around, then this will fit you really nicely.<br /><br />It's a good looking necklace and it's sturdy enough to wear every day. All in all, I like it."
4.0,Although it's quite short the shirt is pretty warm. If it's over 85 degrees it's too hot to wear it because of the turtle neck.
4.0,"While this is a great idea, they are a little big for a woman's nose.  I did order the woman's version."
4.0,"I was surprised to find that these were not made of the usual sweatpants fabric. There’s no fleecy interior. Instead it’s a thick polyester knit. However, the colors are vibrant, the pattern is oh-so-very-80’s, and the pants fit comfortably. AND they perfectly match my hoodie from Totally 80’s Pizzeria and Museum! This is now my go-to Saturday morning cartoon loungewear for the winter."
4.0,Very soft! Very big! Be very careful choosing your size?
4.0,What I needed  only complaint made in China
4.0,Fit perfect. Should have read first that they are hand wash only. The BEBE came off after washing
4.0,"Badass as expected, it also got here early just wished I could've found it bigger if I could have then it would've received 5 stars."
4.0,"This cardigan is fairly cozy. The yarns are thick and I like the speckle and texture added by the multicolored thread in the white. It has an acrylic feeling I don’t associate with higher quality material, and the fit is on the boxier side of things. But for its price, it’s still a useful weekend staple to throw on for a casual day."
4.0,"The size is just right, good pockets for organization and I always get compliments on the beauty of this custom bag."
4.0,It’s a very cute dress. Length is not too short for 5’3” like me. It is very snug if you have hips. I should have gotten the XL instead of L.
4.0,"This is a solid strap, it's made well. I just don't like that the storage pocket moves and I spend a lot of time readjusting it while in use. I'll keep it as a backup but I bought a different one that straps underneath the arm and is stationary, which I prefer much more."
4.0,"Sweatpants were nice,  but the string around waist was missing."
4.0,These were worn for one of our high school actresses in Arsenic and Old lace and they looked great on her.
4.0,"Very simple, effective, and clever design.  Easy to clean, well constructed and worth the price."
4.0,"I read through the reviews and lots of people commented that it fits a little snug, so I went with a size up and it fit perfect! My daughter is 3.5 years old and typically wears a 3T/4T and I bought her a 4T/5T and its just right. the pants would have probably fit her in the smaller size but the hoodie would have been to small.  This outfit is adorable and the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is because the headband is WAY to small. When I say ""WAY"" I mean it could probably fit on my 8 week old niece's head."
4.0,They werent the ones I got before when I ordered them I couldn't see threw the lenses when I got them the first time and the second time I got them I could see threw them!!
4.0,I love these glasses for a 4th of July type event! I have convinced myself that it is not disrespectful but it still needs a little work.
4.0,Very cute and my daughter loved it but 2 bells fell off within a week or so of having them unfortunately but they where easy to just glue back on!
4.0,Would give 5 stars but very difficult to attach balls. Are comfortable and look nice.
4.0,got this because my boyfriend attends BGSU and we wanted matching t shirts. not my favorite but it will do!
4.0,Absolutely LOVE this watch. And Wristology!
4.0,This necklace is so pretty! It looks exactly like the picture shown including the length. It took about three weeks to recieve but was worth the wait and my daughter has already borrowed it!
4.0,It might be my size of face but I'm a grown man & this mask is too small it barely fits & eventually feels too tight.
4.0,I love these socks.  They feel great! The one thing I don't like about them is that I can't bleach them because of the polo logo!
4.0,"This is a very cute and flattering dress. Small fit well and was modest length - I’m 5’3”, 120. But the material the top is made out of is so itchy! I wish I could keep it but there’s no way I’ll ever last wearing something so uncomfortable on my skin."
4.0,"This choker is adorable! My son bought it for my daughter for Christmas. I was afraid it would fall apart at the price point, but it is surprisingly high quality! The price point was fantastic and allowed my 6 year old to buy it with his money for his sister, while still getting something that will last! Perfect for any Harry Potter fan! (One thong to note, it is a big longer than choker size on my 9 year old, but she still loves it!)"
4.0,"A little bigger than expected but super comfy and cute. For around the house, bigger is no big deal, but I thought I’d mention it just in case."
4.0,"Definitely doesn’t fit how it does in the picture, but still ties and still cute just not as loose"
4.0,I would order two sizes up if you wear plus size but cute dress
4.0,"This hat doesn't fit like the hat in the picture,  but I still like it. Color is what I expected it to be."
4.0,No box but all I really wanted was the pendent. Very happy with this purchase
4.0,"Very comfortable bras with moderate support (good for lounging around house, probably not appropriate for a fancy dinner). I followed the sizing chart and bought two - one in nude and one in black. The sizing was definitely different between the two. The black was smaller and fit me better, whereas the nude is a bit too big. That being said, I ended up keeping both and wear both regularly.<br /><br />Cups are removable and bra is machine washable."
4.0,ordered a large but it was small still like it tho
4.0,"This wallet fits great in my EMT uniform pants, my only issue is that the zipper gets stuck everytime I use it which slows down the process of getting cash and change out in a hurry. Other than that, it’s great!"
4.0,"The pic is a lighter, prettier, color than what I received."
4.0,Its very stretch so great for plus size wen but the seller didn't send the exact pattern or color.so that a bummer
4.0,"Loved the outfit, just wish an exlarge was available, but it’s more beautiful in person"
4.0,"I love this necklace. I thought it was just the pendant but it came with a chain too. I have been wearing it for about a month now and unfortunately, the shiny silver coating is starting to wear off the necklace and the pendant (but only on the back where it rubs on my neck.) I’m going to transfer the pendant to a sterling silver chain and it’ll be just fine."
4.0,I got them for my mom and she absolutely loves them. She wears them every chance she gets definitely buying again
4.0,Broke quickly but I just bought another chain.
4.0,"This sweater fit a little smaller than expected, some parts of the stitching on the sleeves are kind of wonky. The material is slightly itchy. I also tried this on to take pictures and it automatically left black fuzzies on my arms.<br /><br />It’s still cute for the fall/winter! I’ll style with a vest."
4.0,Is nice dress but not flattered
4.0,It’s good quality and same as described
4.0,Love these! I got them for my kids and my self. They fit them pretty great! The skeleton leg and foot goes with their legs right on! Not so much for myself but my legs are thicker.
4.0,I ordered these for myself but it looks like my 2 year old grand daughter will be receiving them. These are super tiny. If you look at the photos you can see they are not as big as my nail. So if your looking for something a little more glam these are not the ones. Nice for a single wear or a small ear lobe.
4.0,Great dress. Order your regular size as armholes are large and drapey. Very cute dress. Great length.
4.0,These are thin joggers.  They are VERY soft on the outside!  Pockets are deep enough so I don't worry about sitting down and losing stuff from the pockets.  They are smaller than a size large...not by alot...but are smaller.  The drawstring works comfortably...The joggers are stitched well.  They are very comfortable!
4.0,It was pretty but the material wasn’t what I expected. I returned them.
4.0,"This fit lovely and the fabric is nice so it feels great on. I expected the dress to be floor length as picture and although it wasn't I still love it. I am 5ft 8in and the dress falls at my ankles. I would recommend, good value for the price."
4.0,"Very good quality. Fits a little small. I'm 6' tall with a 44R chest, and this Large sweater is quite snug. For those around 6' with a slim build, this might fit just right, but if I could do it again I'd get the XL and take it to my tailor."
4.0,"I actually use these sleeves when rocking my baby to sleep.  My baby's head is always warm and will start to sweat.  Using these sleeves, I can comfortably rock him to sleep and not worry about his head getting sweaty and sticky."
4.0,"Lovely necklaces!<br /><br />Finish is high-quality and beautifully polished; the chain patterns are great...very versatile and impressive!<br /><br />I only wish that they could be separated, and worn individually. I'd also like to be able to put various charms on them, according to my attire for the day and the occasion...<br />but since they're attached at the clasp and ring, they are a single unit.<br /><br />Won't stop me from wearing and enjoying them, tho!<br />As a jeweler myself...adding clasps and rings won't be an issue for me ;)<br /><br />Thank you for a lovely product! Nice addition to my collection."
4.0,Fit was as expected but color has a tint of yellow in it (looks a bit lemony).  Can't wear it under white tops as it shows through as pale yellow but other than that it is a very comfortable bra.  I would like to find a white one!
4.0,Need for wedding
4.0,"While my partner thinks the bra is comfortable enough to wear for a few hours, she says the way it applies pressure to the lower part of the bust would eventually become uncomfortable. And there's nothing loose about the fit of this (which is good for a running bra), but as a result it does have the same effect as a push-up bra. So my takeaway is that there's a reason they're showing a smaller-chested model (likely wearing a larger size) in the product photos. Needless to say, the sizing runs a bit small, so you could likely size up for the sake of comfort.<br /><br />The price here is fair, and it will certainly be used by my partner. The stitching is also (as they claim) quite nice. But if you're looking primarily for comfort, this isn't for you."
4.0,Dislike the dark lenses! But I love the big frame.
4.0,Looks cute as in the box .. awaiting a birthday girl to open him ... looks well made -$
4.0,I am giving this as a gift for a July birthday so I do not know what the recipient thinks yet - but other than being very tiny I like it!
4.0,I didn't expect but this set is very beautiful... nd exeeds expectations by far for the price paid
4.0,"Dress fits well and the pleating in the front center is flattering. The dress can be worn to or out for cocktails. Soft, comfortable fabric."
4.0,"Ok quality, very cute! You get what you paid for"
4.0,Fabric could be better quality but the fit and shape is great and very flattering.
4.0,"I really love the top, although the brown is lighter than I expected (not as dark as the model pics, but not as faded as the last pic). I have a really hard time finding swimsuit tops that fit me well and I'm comfortable in, but this one has to be my favorite. The straps can be criss-crossed in the back or straight, and they're adjustable. It provides enough support without feeling too small/tight. For size comparison, I normally wear a size 14/XL in regular clothes but ordered 16/XXL because I always have to size up for swimsuits. I'm very pleased with the fit.<br /><br />The bottoms are ok, but I don't care much for how they look on me. The side ties are cute, but they draw extra attention to my hips which is totally unflattering for my shape. I'll probably wear the top with a black swim skirt more often than with these bottoms. Still, they're comfortable to swim in so I'm sure they'll get some use."
4.0,"This product works well! I wore my glasses to the grocery store and had a tiny bit of fogging but only around the very edges. Not enough that it would make me feel anxious like when the fog takes up my entire lenses. This product eases my stress and anxiety when I'm in public and lose my vision to foggy glasses! And now I can finally wear whatever mask I want, not just the ones that help reduce fog on their own."
4.0,A nice shoe. A bit tight in the toes but should stretch a little with wear due to flexible material. Slips a bit on the left heel but works ok with regular athletic socks.
4.0,Fit good and was easy to wear. Grandkids loved it for our Halloween party.
4.0,"I wear a 36D this bra must have been a 32C it was so small I really wish it would have been a true size because I think it would have been a great sports bra, It might been really good for the A,B,C's if you are that i would get it a try."
4.0,Was smaller than I thought
4.0,Not the right fit but very cute. Defiantly for cold weather I’d be sweating in this material otherwise.
4.0,One size does not fit all. I'm a 14-16 and while I can't fully wrap myself up it still drapes to the side comfortably. So it really depends what intention you buy this with if you're plus size.
4.0,"Attractive top for casual work days. This top is very flattering on , it is very comfortable and stretches with me so there is no pulling when I’m lifting or bending. I have washed it several times and it has always looked great ."
4.0,"Design is good & easy to read, the band is just the right length & width.<br />Easy to put on & take off"
4.0,"Looks just like the picture. It is well made and looks great on me.<br />Hope it holds up well considering the price paid for a gold-tone, not actual gold necklace. Time will tell."
4.0,I liked the speed of delivery. I liked the feel of the material. It's just comfy.
4.0,"Exactly as described, and as other's have said it is very chunky/big so be warned if you have a small face. The only down side is that they do not feel very durable."
4.0,"I'm 5'10 148 pounds and somewhat squishy around my tummy but this fits pretty much how I expected it to. It looks extremely small when taken out of the package. The material is thin but not terrible. It's slit it higher up than expected but then again i'm an amazon woman and things always looked dwarfed on me. The length is pretty good, not too short and not too long. I doubt this will last more than a couple washes though without lossing threading and getting thinner. Over all this is pretty cute! I bought the black but I'm also going to purchase the white. I wear it with yoga shorts because F trying to cover up panty lines with this skirt, it's just too thin and small for that.<br /><br />Im very happy with the purchase regardless, this is cute and makes me feel like I can kick some ass with the high legs slits.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my unbiased honest reviews. In no way does the discount affect my views of this product or my ratings of this product."
4.0,"I like the colors of the band, it seems to stay on during the day and night, would purchase other bands if available."
4.0,I love this purse!!! Perfect size and color.
4.0,"My 10yo is approx 58"" tall and the reaper's gown was too long. I had to fold and tape up about 6-7 inches so it wouldn't drag as he walked. Otherwise, it was a great costume. Received lots of compliments and laughs. Definitely need another person to help get into the costume. He had to get a little bendy in order to get his upper body in the right part, but nothing difficult. The neckband was a bit tight (zipper and velcro strap), but it needs to be snug in order to keep the air in. Fan worked great, less than a minute to fully inflate. We just clipped the fan controller box to his waistband instead of the inside pocket of the costume. He had no problems walking around the neighborhood for an hour. Material is the slippery plastic-like vinyl you would expect of most Halloween costumes. Average quality. He tried it on when it was first delivered, to make sure everything worked. Then we put it away until Halloween. No chances of it getting messed up before. Would buy again."
4.0,"Protectif is a great durable wallet that takes up almost no space at all in your pocket. Holds a ton of items such as photos, credit cards, business cards, money and so much more. This leather product is made with quality and has a beautiful finish. There are so many compartments for you to carry everything you need without having to worry about a bulky item. Comes in a semi-glossy box, very luxurious looking! Has paper inside to help with shipping which is great for if you are gifting this to a friend or family member. I will say this I wish instead of tape to secure the box they would have used a string or something a little more easier on the eyes. That is a personal preference though, but is something worth mentioning in case this is a gift item. It does not affect the performance of the item at all. This states that it is a RFID blocking wallet and in this day and age, extra security measures are a blessing. My husband always carries his credit cards in RFID blocking sleeves which after awhile they tend to look horrible and rip and tear. Having the wallet take away all that is so much more helpful and a lot easier to deal with. Everything you need right here in one wallet!<br /><br />I received mine at a discounted price, however that in no way affects my review"
4.0,The band itself is beautiful! The link removal is a but tricky. The poker it comes with isn't quiet long enough so I had to grab some pliers to get the pin out. And the pins are kinda bendy if you dont hit it right but they're easy to put back in either way.<br /><br />The color matches my fossil venture perfect! I absolutely love it.
4.0,"Nice look...my daughter didnt keep it on her heaed for too long, but it looked cute with her outfit"
4.0,Fun once in a while.
4.0,these fit awesome. when you was you need fabric softer which i did not do. they make great hanging around the house pants
4.0,"Super cute, stylish of course. But dang I wish they were darker tinted. But I still love them."
4.0,"This is a one size item and it is kind of loose for me around the waist. I am a medium (size 6 dress and 34C). The fabric is nice and stretchy and I'll probably keep them just to wear around the house, but rather thin, so if you were going to use them to work out, you would probably need to wear another sports bra underneath. Even as I was just getting them to wear out, you can def see nips through the fabric if it is cold!"
4.0,"It came with a little hole in the fabric at the collar (I didn't have time to fix it), but the material was pretty good, it was super long and I'm 5'7"" ish. But overall worth it for the price and a fun outfit!"
4.0,Fit my 15 year old as expected
4.0,It looks very beautiful! However it doesn't stay in place when I wear it. It twists and turns while it is on my neck. I have to keep adjusting it. But it is a beautiful piece. I would have returned it if I hadn't crossed the return date.
4.0,"The Quality is lovely. The price was great.  However, it was very small.  All of my tops are a 2X, I ordered a 3X and it fits more like a 1X. But the service and quality were great."
4.0,"This is a pretty standard text in many great physics programs. My professor specifically selected with book for my grad level course because top universities use it. However, i found it less approachable than it is comprehensive. More approachable than Jackson by a long shot without Jackson's attitude. But, I find it much less thorough than a text like Jackson, Sakurai, or even Shankar. This textbook felt sort of like a survey of statistical mechanics for those who already know much of it and have the math skills to fill in a lot of gaps. I do not recommend this book for someone trying to learn it for the first time. It offers a dialogue on the vast uses and subjects in statistical mechanics rather than mathenaticsl proofs or formulations of the fundamental theories. I like it for the conversations about statistical mechanics and the number of equations in it across many fields inside of stat mech."
4.0,Very nice casual tank top and shorts set. Classic style. Looks reasonably well. made  lovely color and  comfortable
4.0,Lovely color good fit definitely size up!
4.0,really nice dress see through on top part need some type of nipple coverage and color is more orange than watermelon
4.0,Love it money well spent
4.0,"Nice fit, comfortable, cute."
4.0,I LOVE THIS STYLE AND FIT BUT ITS ALL ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL PREFFERENCE
4.0,"I’m almost 5’7 & weigh about 255. I have a bit of a belly (4 kids worth lol) but this one piece is still sexy. It’s comfortable, has stretch to it & is warm. I have big boobs so the zipper part doesn’t quite come all the way up on me, but that worked for my date lol. It’s more casual than dressy though so if it’s for date night purposes, make sure it’s a casual kind of date."
4.0,They sparkle and look very nice. The designs are unique and attractive. The chains and clasp are good.
4.0,Sizes are weird hard to find the correct size had to return product several times
4.0,"They run a little small, but they're very nice boxers! Good quality material!"
4.0,"This bracelet is so neat! I get a lot of compliments on it and it's just so unique. My only complaint is that it's not of the best quality, so I have had to put it back together a couple of times already."
4.0,Great but the lining shows a little
4.0,Cute for my teenager
4.0,"This belt looks great from afar. It bends pretty easily, though, which is why I chose a 4 instead of a 5. It needs to be a little flexible, sure, but it was way too easy to bend to me. Otherwise, a nice purchase."
4.0,"Love the shorts, great quality, heavy material, lots of pockets but hate the snap instead of a button waistband.  I think they run a bit small too."
4.0,"Lots of options and great for the amount of money spent. Only reason for 4 stars is that the way it's packaged because the necklaces have a bended dent in the middle where they folded it, so it takes time to get rid of that. Its only with a few of them But other than that it's great!"
4.0,Fits nicely through the shoulders but somewhat tight around waist where I carry most of my weight.  Otherwise nice shirt.
4.0,Great prduct
4.0,"Happy with purchase, comfy, cozy warm & good quality 👍🏻"
4.0,"Loved the softness of fabric.  Good quality. Loved the fit. Im 5""3' 170lbs ordered a large.  Not too tight fitting.  Very flattering."
4.0,It fits a 32lb foldable bike just fine.  The service is exceptional.  Bought two - one bag handle broke and was replaced by the supplier ASAP.  Bags are not heavy duty -  good for storage and occasional use.
4.0,"I ordered this apron with my logo on it for food demos and it came out great. I have not washed it yet so don't know how it will come out, but so far the apron is what I expected from the description and delivered on time."
4.0,they are made well and have good feel  if u have a large head these will not be good for u<br />overall good quality for the price well made
4.0,"Pretty dress, thicker fabric than expected (higher quality that expected, I guess I should say.) It fit well and I was very happy with it. It definitely makes sitting down a little awkward due to the button placement and how the dress folds, creating a few noticable gaps. Otherwise, really good buy!"
4.0,The shoe looks cool but the quality isn't so great. The roller sometimes get stuck. My kids really wanted them and there are fun. They change colors or you can set them to different mode by pressing the button.
4.0,"Very cute, quality is fair for price."
4.0,there okay not very good to wear allday they look so cute and made very nice but i would buy schols for more comfort other than that they are very nice!
4.0,"Son loved his red shoes, but the red on the soles wears off easily. Good play shoes for school."
4.0,Cute and unique product.
4.0,"My wife loved her earrings.  When I first saw them they were not the exact same shape, but I guess that's normal when you get real pearls.  They are beautiful and the price is excellent."
4.0,"I would have really liked it, but it was very tight. I am normally a small and it was tight. I'm fairly chesty, 32DD, and that part looked amazing, but it was very tight in the shoulders and around the waist. Order a size up."
4.0,"Love this bracelet. It makes a big statement for a small price. The only complaint is what other reviewers have said. It does run a little small. Another half inch would be nice. It fits, but due to this, it will probably break sooner than I would like."
4.0,got this as a christmas gift. She thought it was cute.  &#34;glass&#34; was a bit foggy and the dandelion was a bit difficult to see.
4.0,Very pretty dress. Does run a little small though. I had to order a xxl and I usually wear a large.
4.0,"Easy to put on, easy to wear and keeps the water out and makes going underwater fun."
4.0,Like the top much more than the bottoms. Still very thin. For the price I expected something a little thicker.
4.0,Dropped them & lens popped out.  Contacted vendor & they sent me another pair free!
4.0,Bought L/XL but fits more like M/L. Love it anyways!
4.0,It very pretty and stretchy. Had tobe careful not to detach a metal loop when opening the package. It's great because it doesn't snag my hair when I take it off. (mind you my hair is thick and curly and long). Love it
4.0,I like it but I thought it was going to be blue and its white. I didn't see a spot to choose a color so I was expecting blue but I'll keep the white.
4.0,This watch was basic. There’s not much to say about it. Watch was too small for my wrist so I ended up returning.
4.0,"These underscrubs are so cute. I love the colors and they're very soft and slinky. I got an XL and normally wear a L in underscrubs and they fit my body/stomach perfectly. I didn't think there could be any issues with them EXCEPT I work as a nurse in the NICU so we have to roll our sleeves up to our elbows and I found out just how small the wrist holes are on these shirts. They squeezed my forearms after an hour or so to the point that my arms were actually turning a little blue and were getting puffy. I tried to tug at the wrist seams a little but they are very well made so they wouldn't budge. Sadly, I think I'm going to have to return these since they are almost unusable for me. If you don't really need to roll your sleeves up or are pretty tiny then these shirts will have no problems for you. Disappointed."
4.0,the gem was beautiful. the chain was okay. the metal chain discolored my skin eventually.
4.0,"Fits grreat, does not come with replacemrnt screws if you need it"
4.0,Seems as if these cheap products are getting better. They did the job and did not get fogged up like some others!
4.0,Unique looking shoe and fits well.
4.0,"Like all chain link jewelry, time will tell as to when the true metal is exposed.  This part of manufacturing as yet to be over-come.  We shall see . . ."
4.0,"Bought this for my gf. She is 5ft 6in, about 160lbs. Has a bit of a stress belly. She wore leggings underneath and a slimming top underneath to help with shape. Fit her nicely. Dress went down to her knees. She was happy with it"
4.0,The strap adjusters make noise when moving around. It doesn’t affect function or comfort just slightly annoying.
4.0,"Gorgeous summer dress. Flowy, light, breathable jersey dress. Great quality. The color is beautiful and exactly as pictured. The neckline and waist detail are well done and very flattering.The length is perfect for me, I'm 5'8&#34; and the material wrinkles VERY easily. I dont think the pockets would be very flattering for someone with bigger hips or butt."
4.0,These are a tad bit small and are very french-cut. I prefer more coverage. I would order up a size.
4.0,I ordered this watch in gold. I had one before but I had dropped it accidentally and the face<br />of the watch shattered. All the rivets were gold just like the picture. When I got this one the<br />rivets are copper colored. I don't know why the difference.
4.0,The top is a little sheer but overall was a nice fit and works well for dress or casual.
4.0,"It’s good enough for a teen, she loves it."
4.0,"Exactly as described, fast shipping."
4.0,"Was hoping for more of a yellow/gold hoodie like the picture looks and since the color listed is Vegas Gold. Looks more of a tan in person. Disappointed but I am sure my nephew will be ok with it. Otherwise, the quality seems fine."
4.0,Tight in armpits
4.0,They were screw on not clip on<br /> Returned
4.0,"The Shock Doctor soft headgear was highly recommended by the flag football league for my grandson.  Not only is the comfort and ease to take on and off appealing, but the headgear looks great.  The safety it provides for these young athletes is well worth the cost of the product."
4.0,"Very nice piece of costume jewelry. One of the larger crystals came with a big scratch, however no one else scrutinized the piece like I did. It did the job as an accessory for an evening wedding guest."
4.0,"It's a large watch but, thats what I was looking for.  It stopped on me one time...not sure why but, it hasn't done it since then.  I always loved Seiko...hope this lasts as long as my other one did."
4.0,"I thought it would be a little bit bigger, and I thought it would have some sparkle to it...but it's okay for what it is - I can always add to it."
4.0,"Nice idea, easy enough to use, kinda like head phones, bit they keep your head and ears worm in the winter"
4.0,These work as intended. Nothing fancy but worth the price.
4.0,I like this. Very comfortable. The material is good. I just got them & wash then they became out of dryer in good shape. It fit perfectly for me.  I got size L and fit nice. I am 165lb size L was perfect fit.
4.0,Nice but just didnt work out for the dress
4.0,it was a christmas gift and was timely shipped and well received.  That is about all I have to say.
4.0,"Very cute chef hat and apron set for my son. He put it on right away after he opened it and was very excited! Love that the apron is adjustable to fit  little ones. The hat was still a bit big (my son is 4 but has a smaller head), but he is still able to wear it. The material is a bit thin, but overall a cute set for little kids!"
4.0,"It's a pretty, well-made nightgown.  The fabric of this nightgown is heavy and tent-like but not scratchy.  It was 7 inches too long until it was washed and dried -- fits fine now!"
4.0,This Blender is very powerful<br />Allow to charge Overnight upon receiving<br /> All  4 green lights on blender is achieved<br />Be careful when opening the top to aovid. Spillage<br /> You might forget and open the wrong side
4.0,Really really cute. I purchased the little lamb top and both my daughter and I can't wait until it cools down so she can wear it. My daughter is a young 6 but she is tall so I purchased the 7T. I expected it to be larger but it will fit for now. It does worry me that she might get it dirty but I figured that based on pictures.
4.0,"A little flimsier than I expected, but still a perfect wait for summer time. Love it. Just mark off one star because the material is very thin."
4.0,This is a beautiful dress. If you are “hippy”’this dress is going to show your curves.
4.0,Looks better in real life than online. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. My 2 year old loves them. The bow part does fall out of the slot on the headband, which sometimes is a little annoying, but I actually like that feature because as she grows if she wants to just wear the headband without the bow she can. Seem well made and fit her large head (will even fit my head). Might be too big for younger than 2 years, but worth trying. Overall can't go wrong for the price."
4.0,"Love the jacket, but it does run a little small. I am quite petite so I did not return, but if I could do it over I think I would have gone with a medium. I like jackets with the cuffed sleeves when I am working so they don't get it the way and will stay pushed up when I need them to. The material is a little stiffer than I would like - hopefully will break in with wear. Overall a nice jacket for the price."
4.0,the slit is a little higher than expected but they are exactly what i wanted
4.0,Fits as expected and is adorable on my daughter.
4.0,"Very cute! They fit me fine, they have a decent amount of stretch to them. I wear a US Women's Size 10. If my foot was much longer they would be too small."
4.0,Very soft. I’m 5’2 and they are not to long.
4.0,I wish these were cotton. Overall This is a very good buy and I would recommend this to others
4.0,"This fits really nice. I was a little worried and the sleeves are a bit tighter but once I have everything in place it works out pretty good and stays. It hits me right above the knee(and I’m 5’4”), so I’d say it’s a good length. It’s really nice that it hides my middle where I’m most concerned about concealing, but I can get away without a bra or a simple strapless. Definitely a great dress for any size!"
4.0,Great dress (bought it for Ren Fest). May have to buy a few more eventually!
4.0,"Overall, they run big and long.  I'm 5'4&#34; and they hit me just above the ankle.  Waist hits above belly button.  Nevertheless, very comfy - and a size smaller would prob be too small.  Great lightweight fabric."
4.0,"I like the styling, but returned them for a different color."
4.0,Ok Clothes R iffy online = I ordered size = XL US and XXL EUR (apparently) but I wear size M to L in America usually.  I am 6ft 190lbs 34/36inch waist.  Would not go smaller.  Comfort is very nice.  Stitching wish was same color as fabric another words Black top = black stitching and blue top = blue stitching so I like grey personally bcuz stitching is same as grey fabric/top.
4.0,Very nice watch but the glass fell out and the hand broke off after wearing for about 3 weeks.
4.0,"Wish the chain was a little longer, but very nice quality."
4.0,The suit is very flattering just be sure to order a size larger than you normally wear as it runs small.
4.0,A bit smaller than the size it says it is.
4.0,"This is a cute swimsuit, but not the most comfortable. If you have a larger chest you might find yourself disappointed in the support. I found the only way to get any support was to tie the top super tight (it goes under the bustline and around the back pulling the ladies together end up the tighter you pull it), which then makes the suit less than flattering if you aren't stick thin. Everything fit well otherwise, the tie accent is super cute and then bottoms fit perfectly. It's made of good material, put together nicely, and seems like it will hold up well to wear and washing."
4.0,"Very comfy and fit is wonderful. Just a little too long for me as I am 5'3"" but it does not fall below my ankles as it gathers at my ankles."
4.0,"I ordered black, but these are blue!"
4.0,These gaiter masks are an ideal weight and a great value.  Easy to keep track of---loss is not really an issue.  Better than most other kinds of masks.
4.0,I was so excited to wear this swim suit. I'm always leery about ordering clothes on line and with good reason.<br /><br />Fit: Extremely small. I ordered a large and it fit as a small.<br /><br />Feel: basic swimwear fabric. Soft and smooth.<br /><br />The suit is made well other than the fact the sizing is way off. The bra is very supportive and does have underwire. The bottoms are highwaisted.<br /><br />I wanted to badly to be able to wear this but it's definitely not happening 😩<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount. My reviews are based on quality and performance and are never manipulated or altered in any way.
4.0,The material is better than expected. Sleeves and pants are a little long. The costume looks good.
4.0,"They seem to be accurate quality to price, however, the size ran extremely small. We couldn’t get my sons feet into the shoes, we are exchanging for a size up."
4.0,"A little flimsy, but besides that good shades"
4.0,"Over $200 really? why so expensive? we can get this on footlocker or finishline for $180... this is just overpricing. thanks a lot. Nice shoes though. looks like a TANK but its a flyknit, meaning its very light when you wear them."
4.0,"I would have liked it a bit larger, but this lenght size was the only one available to ship all the way to Mexico, it will look great with the Mama Claus dress I bought. Thank you!"
4.0,"This is such a cute and comfy outfit.  My daughter likes it a lot.  The cloud is a fluffy appliqué.  The colors are very pretty.  The clothes from this brand, the sets like this in particular fade easily.  I recommend washing on a gentle cycle and allowing it to air dry.  Overall a very good buy!"
4.0,The only thing I have to look out about is that it is heavy and when it flows off my chest with activities it comes very close to hitting and scratching my glasses...lol
4.0,"Somewhat large, but with a little adjustment using a piece of sponge as a spacer it fits well."
4.0,"The hat is thick and warm. It's a little shorter than I expected, so doesn't pull down quite as low as I wanted."
4.0,The earrings I received look different than the image online. The triangles are not as thick as the picture portrays and the backing is a clasp. They are fun to wear and I do like them. I just wish I received the product portrayed.
4.0,Large is slightly tight-fitting for me. Next time I should probably get X-Large. Thanks.
4.0,Little more insulation and it is GREAT!
4.0,"I liked the color variety.  They absorb well.  They are initially a bit too tight for my taste, so I end up stretching them too loosen them up a bit."
4.0,The purse is cute and the latch works smoothly. However the color is much darker than shown on the picture. I have the same purse in brown color and this purse is pretty much same color as that one I own.
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, the metal is a bit this and bends a bit easier than anticipated, but overall nice."
4.0,These hoops are a great size for everyday wearing. They are medium sized in thickness; will not bend on their own but are lighter (which is lovely) and thinner than most. The part that goes into your ear is extra long which is perfect for it insures that the earring stem will not pull out for any reason. Gorgeous packaging that I will reuse *smile*. This purchase is well worth the money spent; the quality would justify a higher price point. Not to give any ideas to Amazon...
4.0,"I like the top.  It fits well.  There's a spot of dye on the front that's not supposed to be there.  It looks like dirt, but it's in the fabric.  I think it bothers me more than anyone else.  Very cute and comfortable.  The bottoms are too scimpy.  I threw them out and bought something that had better coverage and was more comfortable"
4.0,"The green on the scarf is more black than green, nonetheless I do like this scarf."
4.0,Loved it but it was for work but too much chest
4.0,Had to return for extra large
4.0,Great and fun socks
4.0,I'm 5'5 weight 125 pounds and got a small size. Fits OK but a little big in the back where the skirt starts. It's classy and pretty
4.0,"Dress is nice. Fit was what you would expect. However, I wanted it practically floor length for my daughter. For a floor length fit I would suggest one size bigger."
4.0,"The stitching on the waist unraveled after the first wash on one of the tops. Otherwise, the shirts fit as expected and the colors are as pictured."
4.0,"Outfit is so cute. A little big but going to have it altered on the sides. It’s too cute to send back. Also,Outfit was missing brown circular belt buckle. Bummed bc it looks cute with the outfit online."
4.0,"Good product, however the clasp is too small to fit most necklace chains."
4.0,"I'd have to say this backpack was definitely worth the purchase<br /><br />Although it looks small in person (and microscopic on most of the images here), it's much larger than it looks.  I was a little bit nervous about it's size when I bought it, mainly because I hadn't seen anybody specify what size laptops could fit inside.  However, it easily fits my 15"" MacBook Pro with enough room for about two or three thick textbooks.  It could probably fit a 17"" laptop as well, though the fabric might be a little bit stretch, so I would advise away from this if you have one until someone else confirms it can.<br /><br />Outside of school, this bag is good for things like biking or day-trips, especially since most guys I know wouldn't like to carry around a purse.  And it has a pocket on the side which fits my Rubik's cube perfectly.  The backpack also has a pocket for an MP3 player, but I don't use it, because I tend to use athletic headphones, and there's barely enough room for my iPod Touch.  The pocket is also located fairly high up, making it look somewhat awkward, whereas running the jack under your shirt is much easier.<br /><br />The only trouble I've found with this bag, is the strap.  It's too short to get across my body without unstrapping it, although when I'm leaving it on for longer periods of time, I'm glad it's not any longer. It does have four different lengths, but I'm heavy enough that I can only use the two longest ones comfortably, and it's difficult to use the longest one.  In addition, it becomes increasingly difficult to put on when you begin moving.  However, the strap is surprisingly comfortable to hold when moving a short distance (which in my case, is usually between classes at school), so unless I need to carry something else with it, I tend to choose that.  The handle at the top is also a pretty good solution.  Alternatively, I will occasionally leave it strapped, and hang it over my other shoulder without having it across my chest, though it's less comfortable, and less stable."
4.0,Seems tough and should do the job.  A bit snug and need to try and stretch them a little.
4.0,Runs very big if you wear a large to xl...a medium may still be a bit big. Otherwise it's a nice shirt to wear with leggings.
4.0,Loved everything about them. Colors. Material. Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"I’m size 5 and these are too large. I wish socks brands will stop doing ‘one size fits all’ solutions and start making a more diverse sizing.<br />It will be fair to say that all size 5-9 socks are large for me and they all pop up over my low shoes just like these do. The socks are good quality, they are thick and sporty and don’t fall off despite the sizing issue."
4.0,Really like theses a lot for my &#34;go to&#34; work out pants. They are just the right amount of thickness to wear you won't be too hot but you also don't have to worry about showing your under or anything in them. Comfy and great price
4.0,We had to send it back because a large was really too big for my Dad.  We reordered a medium and are anxious for it to arrive.  It looks like an awesome idea for a belt!
4.0,"I got them in the silver color which did not look amazing but for the price, you cant beat it"
4.0,"Love the earings , but they were put in a bad not attach to a cars and were all tangled up !!!"
4.0,This is a nice key pad. Wish it had zipper at both ends. Still not big enough for the fat plastic computerized Honda key. I don't know what is. That is why I gave it 4 stars. Whether it is 5 star quality only time and use will tell. Seems to be though.
4.0,"Lovely set of headbands.  These are quite pretty, the colors are bright, happy and perky.  The eyelet laced flowers are feminine and frankly, almost irresistable!  Darling product."
4.0,"These gloves are actually even prettier in person. To me, the pic makes them look like the embellishment is little silver studs, but it is actually small, faceted jewels that really glitter, especially in the sun. The only negative thing I can say (and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5) is that a few of the jewels have small bits of dried glue surrounding them.  It's not noticeable though unless looking close.  Overall, very happy with purchase!"
4.0,Can't beat the price and the quality that we received on this purchase.  This product meets our needs...
4.0,It was a nice ring but they are running a little bit to big. I order a size 9 but could have worn a size 8.<br />Had to send it back.
4.0,"Does not stretch, zipper a bit janky."
4.0,It's very thin and light but it looks nice.
4.0,"Great for working out/lifting weights. The neckline is not too deeply cut, and the bottom hemline is long enough- but not too long."
4.0,Fits great my only problem when I tried it on one of the hooks came off after taking it off
4.0,The outfit is cute but it is thin and runs small.  I am 5’1  145lb. I usually wear a Medium and sometimes small. I ordered a large based on the chart and reviews. The large fit me a little smaller than a Medium usually fit me but the Waist was a little bigger. The material is thin. I got these for an 80’s/90s party and it will do. I would have preferred thicker fabric like the ones I use to by in the 90s lol
4.0,"Working in the ER, I walk about 7 miles a shift according to my step tracker. Another nurse suggested I try compression socks. I purchased these for the good reviews. I liked them, they work. At the end of a 12 hour shift my legs and feet were swollen free. I especially like the extra room for the toes, unlike stockings or pantyhose. My lack of a 5 star review is, the design is embroidered with in the sock so it left dents all throughout my calves. Not sure if its a complete bad thing but If I wanted I could have colored in the designs on my legs. Needles to say I will be purchasing more."
4.0,"I have read a lot of scrappy reviews for these shirts and I just have to say, go for it.  The chains that come with are for support around your neck and to hold the top around your waste line.  I'm a dumb guy and figured this out for my wife.  Anyone who says this is a rip off due to not being assembled doesn't understand a free sized item has to be able to fit all sizes..Or possibly there're just super lazy or slow. Only reason for four stars is you have to actually connect the shirt a couple rows of Links in, on each side so it's stronger."
4.0,"Default writing utensil although it works, lacks durability.  I recommend order 3 pack of laser pointer green, red and purple (actually blue) for around $10.  The green and red will not work for writing but the purple (blue) laser pointer works excellently.  If you view picture of laser pointer you will see blue label on actual picture not purple."
4.0,"My nephew loved the PJ's and they seemed comfy, but they just looked a little small on him, he's a little 10 year old and the 10/12 looked a little small but it worked for him."
4.0,I like these as they do not leave much of a ting aroundmy leg.  More lose like diabetic sock.  I use them in winter alone.  No slipper.  They are thick.  But they domt go up far on amkle.
4.0,"true to size, lightweight t-shirt like fabric.  out of the pkg I thought 'this is going to make me look a mile wide', but when I put it on I was amazed.  cute and very slimming. would buy more colors at this price, but sadly these tops seem to have disappeared..."
4.0,Pretty good for the price but we ordered two different ones and I actually like the Best Choice Products 20&#34; Hardshell Spinner Expandable Carry On Luggage Travel Bag which is slightly larger and expandable although it's handle is an inch shorter.
4.0,Very soft material and comfortable. Love them. Only thing is the waste doesnt hold up much. Pretty loose fit. Not a tight material for working out in. Bedtime its perfect for
4.0,"Cute little bag,"
4.0,"These are some of the cutest studs I own. They actually do look like little disco balls. They're basically metal balls encrusted with rhinestones. The set consists of three pairs of earrings in varying colors: silver, yellow gold, and rose gold. The two different gold-toned pairs look very similar, and aren't that easy to distinguish from one another unless I look really closely.<br /><br />They look really cute in my ears. They're also lightweight and very comfortable to wear. They're not heavy at all. They catch and reflect light beautifully. I've gotten a couple compliments on them, and I feel they're a nice little touch of glitz and glamour.<br /><br />My only problem with them is that there are a couple that aren't attached very well to the posts. I like their uniqueness, and want to keep them, so I used a toothpick to reinforce them with a little glue.<br /><br />Overall, though, they have a nice design and lend an elegant touch.<br /><br />I received these earrings free to evaluate in exchange for my honest review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely mine and based on my own personal experience wearing these earrings."
4.0,I like the way it fit. The gathering in front is not too high so covers stomach area nicely. Long in back covering your behind. Very thin material...would have liked a bit thicker that’s why gave it a 4.
4.0,Attractive shirt.
4.0,seem to tight should have a size bigger good quality just a little small
4.0,"The top part fits but I’ll have to get it adjusted because its a bit loose below my breast I’ll adjust the length too, I’m 5’61/2 ,195lbs and I purchased the Xl, please note the Lg would’ve been too small for my boob area I wear 38ddd in a vs bra. Hope this helps. I would purchase in the black too but I’ll see how it looks after the adjustment"
4.0,"I'm quite happy with this belt and how it looks, but be warned that the &#34;one size&#34; is quite small! I am a size 4-6 and it is not uncomfortable, but it is a bit snug. Perhaps it will stretch with use."
4.0,"it's a very nice suit for the price, my husband love it !"
4.0,"I love it! I’m 5’3 and weigh 137 pounds. I bought a medium, and it fits perfectly. The material is really nice, and it’s SUPER comfortable. However, the sewing could use some work. The fabric around my wrist is all bunched up. (Shown in picture) Besides the sewing, I love this product."
4.0,"Ordered this dress in a large although I'm typically in a medium in dresses and it actually fits really well. I was afraid it would be far too long, but really the only ""large"" part about this dress is the torso. Luckily, it has a tight-cinched waist that I am able to hike up to my natural waist and just scrunch up the extra material under my boobs. It fits perfectly length-wise that way, and the extra ruching around the middle doesn't look bad at all. The material is very nice and thick, a bit heavy but not uncomfortable. Still flowy and will keep cool in warm weather. Neither the elastic at the top nor around the waist are too tight or uncomfortable. The dress is roomy and has pockets! Overall, super and comfortable dress, washes well and fits perfectly . Quality has exceeded my expectations!"
4.0,Two thumbs up!!! Loved the earrings. It gives you personality. 😊
4.0,Perfect for jewelry making....tiny shards...no turquoise or Tigers Eye but clear quartz and citrine instead
4.0,Great socks but kinda expensive.
4.0,Love the jacket. I really thought it would be a little bigger since I ordered large. Fits like a medium
4.0,Se ve bien 👍
4.0,"Really pretty, just what I want. The problem is when they came is they were SUPER tangled. It took a couple minutes to untangle them. So I just keep them separate and they are fine."
4.0,"People were correct about the admiration/inquiries you get from people who have never seen a bamboo watch.  The face is not too big to wear as a daily, but be careful as the entire watch is susceptible to any kind of moisture.  Just wearing it around on a hot Florida day and sweating the dye in the band turned a ring around my wrist orange."
4.0,Cute but no stretch to the material. Ordered my normal size and it fits.
4.0,I really like the colors of these but they are smaller and less sturdy than what I thought they would be.
4.0,the earrings were beautiful the size was misleading
4.0,"I didn't realize that this dress had pearls trimming the collar. This was a pleasant surprise; however, I think a different material should have been used. It's difficult to iron the cotton collar and not burn the pearl accents.  That's my only issue with the dress.  I received many compliments and this was a great price for this dress. The delivery was only about 2 days too. Love it!"
4.0,They are very comfortable!  Love the non binding waistband. I think they are true to size.
4.0,"Cute repro of a retro style, just a little less than generous on amount of fabric used, and this coverage would be more suitable for smaller sizes."
4.0,Wow! has the swelling been down since wearing the socks.  Don't dry them in the dryer.
4.0,Not terrific quality but not bad either. Great fit. Looked good on and received multiple compliments.
4.0,You can tell they're cheap but I like them still will make great bridesmaids necklaces.
4.0,Nice hat but is a little big for a female.
4.0,"Very cute, fits nice. Not too heavy. Give a nice vintage look. Belt is a bit long but can be fixed."
4.0,"It runs kind of small and I should have ordered a men's size, but I do like it. I am 5'9&#34; and 175lbs. It fits pretty snug."
4.0,She likes them and wears them
4.0,Sleeves are too long! Hands completely hidden lol otherwise it’s a nice shirt and I think the color isn’t a good fit for me. Kind of washed me out. I would have been better off getting a different color… The material is soft and you can unbutton or button all the buttons.<br />My stats:<br />5’3.5<br />205 lb<br />44 bust<br />37 waist<br />47 hip<br /><br />I hope this helps make your decision easier ☺️
4.0,Solo me los puse 1 ver . El gancho se le salió el mismo dias y la perdí 😭😭😭 pero la verdad es muy bonito pero pequeño
4.0,I love this dress! It is soft and very comfortable. True to size.
4.0,It runs a bit big but it's not really an issue.
4.0,"I like them aside from very little protection around the eyes. I had to send mine back for exchange because one pair, the bifocal lens was crooked."
4.0,hoped face would be bigger but like it
4.0,"Great bargain....made well..fits loose,but not too much so.colors are vibrant but one thing for me..looked like green in the pic on my computer and it is blue.next time I am going for a bright color...maybe red or yellow.I have several  & get compliments on all📢"
4.0,they fit fine and they come to the top of my foot. They are perfect for traveling on the plane rather than wearing sweat pants when going through customs etc. Nice and light I used them instead jeans for my evening wear on a motorcycle trip. They took up half the space in the cramped bag and always looked great when we walked to dinner
4.0,"The only reason that I did not give this purse five stars is because it is actually medium-sized and not quite as large as I would consider a large handbag to be.  The website does give the measurements as 10 inches by 11 inches--and that is quite accurate.  Other than that, the high-quality printed leather purse is really attractive.  Although it is a bit pricey, I am justifying my purchase with the fact that there is a matching wallet."
4.0,looks nice. i gave this as a Christmas present.
4.0,"the fabric is strange, but it fits and doesnt feel super cheap. Which is different. Love the pockets, and is pretty."
4.0,"Works great for sweat, does slip up a bit. It has slipped off twice out of 4 times being used while jogging and weight training. I have a big head but they fit comfortably so would buy again."
4.0,The suit is cute and fits well. My toddler loves her super hero suit. My reservation of giving the suit 5 stars is that the suit isn’t lined inside like other swimsuits. The fabric is very thin without the lining and is more like a set of wonderoos than a swimsuit.
4.0,"This is a very nice quality and it shows, buying another one"
4.0,"Very nice, serviceable reading glasses in surprisingly sturdy cases, at an excellent price."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, about 190lbs, size 10, 34DD. Product arrived really quickly. I was really surprised how cute it is and the quality seems awesome. Haven't gotten the white part wet yet so I don't know how see through it will be. The side boob area is pretty small so I took out the padding and it worked better. The shelf bra is also short. The tires area seems a little long but I also don't tie the heck area very tight (bothers my neck). Super cute though I highly recommend for the price."
4.0,Really nice for the price. It is a nice size pendant to wear with solid color blouses. It has a good weight to it making it feel of good quality. I have only wore it twice but it has become one of my favorite jewelry items.
4.0,These served the purpose and my husband and I was the talk of the party .
4.0,I really like the look of these captives they seem to be very nice quality. However the dimples in the balls for the ring to set in are quite shallow and small making these extremely difficult to put in. Putting them in my ears was in fact impossible and for the time being I have had to give up on getting them.
4.0,"Love this case, except for the fact that it is just a bit off of being lined up properly. Otherwise it’s a great case for a great price. I’ve had it for a few months or so and it’s still working great."
4.0,"really cute... great service  there are days I don't want to wear a lot of bracelets.  it looks like jewelry, rather than tracking equipment........."
4.0,"Wish the material was a bit thicker, but it would be great for work."
4.0,Shoe runs too wide for my narrow feet. Love the arch support. Wish there was a narrower version.
4.0,I like the stretch in the material
4.0,Coat just fit and hat and gloves huge for my 6 years old daughter who loves pokemon so was perfect gift. She is in size 10 and ordered 8 to 10 and just fits.
4.0,I liked the bracelets very much. they fit well and did not fall off my wrist. I like that I can wear different types of bangles with them.I would recommend them to anyone.
4.0,"A decent looking gold bracelet. Good weight to it (being steel linked). The clasp seem solid, and it should last. It will fit an average wrist."
4.0,Not a stretchy is I expected and they're a bit smaller than expected but they do the job
4.0,"Have this in one print so ordered in another because I love it so much. Only complaint about the one just delivered is that the adjustment straps are opposite.  Like the aren’t equal. One adjusts on the front side, one adjusts the opposite direction.  That still wasn’t enough to make me want to return or exchange it.  The fabric is really lightweight and comfortable. The cut is very flattering.  It’s the perfect spring/summer dress and even though I have two now, I’ll probably order it in at least one more print. I love it that much."
4.0,Item very nice quality but runs about a size to two sizes small
4.0,Nice shirt runs a little large.
4.0,Poor quality material but great comfort
4.0,"So like others have said the strap is a little cheap and flimsy, but it is still functional. Bag was bigger than I was expecting and kind of a light tan. I have plenty of room to store my wallet, makeup, journal, phone, keys and glasses in it. It is very well organized but I would say from a practicality point of view the main compartment is kind of a hassle to open and close. Beneath that flap though is a really cool magnetically closed compartment which is amazing. I did not have an issue with smell or glue like others have reported. All seems look good as well. Overall really nice looking, and might be a good daily driver."
4.0,$6.00 toy for my grand-daughter.  Cute and inexpensive.
4.0,"We haven't used the hat much yet, but it's pretty adorable and I think we will be very happy with it."
4.0,"Love these slippers, my daughter and i both have them but they run small so order big."
4.0,"It is good product, but the color on the chain stayed silver. I got a replacement"
4.0,"No dressy, great for sporty!"
4.0,Nice color and material but not as long as it looked in the picture.
4.0,"from what I read in the comments I ordered my daughter a larger size, since many people were saying it runs small, and it too big. It’s too big even for myself. It’s a light jacket. Thin material. It is nice and soft."
4.0,"Great fit! The zipper pocket fit my samsung plus size phone, which is great! They did cover my knees..."
4.0,"Great compression tops. Use to trail run, fit snug and makes running experience better, especially with bladder pack over shirt"
4.0,"I should write a review the day that I recieved the package but now I have the time to open it and be happy with the stuff that I bought. I got it on time, very secure the bag with all the things in their on packages, love it,the price good,but the only thing is that I didn't get the ring, I would have give it a 5 stars"
4.0,They’re cute but much smaller than I expected
4.0,cute cardigan and a little darker then picture but thats ok with me ( i ordered the grey with strips). I ordered the 2x not exact size runs a bit small in arms \ shoulders. not stretchy or loose.
4.0,"the top half of the shirt is a little short, and I myself don't have a long torso. other wise the shirt fits great!"
4.0,Usually I wear size 4. Size small of this skirt is too big for me. The skirt itself is very pretty and well made. I wish they had x-small.
4.0,"I do really like this dress, but I liked this dress more in the picture.The only other thing I can say is that I ordered this dress too large. I should have ordered a medium and I would have liked the fit a lot better."
4.0,size bigger than expected best for special occasions only overall very nice necklace
4.0,"I'm 132 lbs, 5' 5"" and usually M. Nonetheless this item is a bit loose, so I guess it runs big. However I like the fabric and the design it's really cool. Totally recommend and give my personal measurements for reference"
4.0,"socks are really cute but they get holes in the toes after a few washes. That being said, just as good as what you would get at a Fred Meyer here. really good value"
4.0,I have the dark purple one... I thought it was black so that kinda ruined my outfit. But the length and fit of the dress were great! Also it was pretty thick material so I didn’t have to worry about my  skivvies showing 🤣 but one of the sleeves was tighter than the other and was hurting me so I had to cut my dress ( which ruined it) so I could wear it all day
4.0,A little cheap feeling but nice overall.
4.0,Bought these for my kid and he loved them at first but now has not worn them for a couple of months and says that they hurt his feet.
4.0,I really found this skirt to be beautiful but it just was too big on me since I am petite.
4.0,"My husband bought me these as a gift. The pearls are a good quality, they have a high luster and are real. They also have a good weight to them. There are variations in the shape of each pearl, but they aren't really noticeable unless you're looking for them. I would say, for the price, this is a nice set.<br /><br />I gave this item 4 stars for two reasons: the packaging they came in left a lot to be desired. Yes I know these are not $1,000 pearls, but they came shipped in a plastic baggie with no protection whatsoever. A small cloth baggie would have been nice.<br /><br />Secondly, the title of the posting says they are 7mm, when really they are only 6mm (it says so in the description if you read carefully). 1mm is a big difference with pearls. I don't feel like they were too small, the necklace just should have been advertised as 6mm and not 7mm.<br /><br />Overall this was a good purchase. These are a good set of beginner pearls."
4.0,"This is not a great shirt if you are a pear shaped woman, which I am. The fabric is super soft and the color is beautiful. But, if your hips are wider than your shoulders it will bunch up all around your tummy and hips. The neckline is nice, though."
4.0,Loved it! There's a hair clip attached that I need to figure out how to safely remove but otherwise perfect for newborn photography
4.0,I would repurchase this item
4.0,Nice and bright. Hard to miss. Have used once and seem very durable
4.0,Great glasses but had to return as they didn't look good on my Boyfriend.
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, will probably order more colors"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8566d22dcb583429eef9929835bbeb96]] This shirt is really cute and a crowd favorite. I’m a D cup and didn’t wear any tape or bra while wearing this shirt. I sized up and it’s still a bit tight. There’s not much of a stretch to the material, but overall I do like it."
4.0,"My son bought this for my wife for Christmas. While it's not really her style, it is nice.<br /><br />presentation wise was more disappointing. Its not in a pretty box or anything so you kind of have to dress it up some.<br /><br />Pro's - price was right for my 11 year old to give to his mom and she can wear it when he is around.<br /><br />Con's - packing was weak. A simple box display would have been nice to make it a little more special to open."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable but one of the pins was extremely difficult to slide and insert into my watch. My other pin was fairly easy though so here's hoping that is not the quality of all of their bands as I definitely want more colors!
4.0,This hat is perfect for running. It is lightweight and blocks UV the way it is advertised. It cleans off easily just take a rag and soap to it. It is also fun for wearing casually. It adjusts very easily as well to fit all.
4.0,"I like this dress but I wish there was more structure if that makes any sense. The fabric is just really flimsy and feels borderline cheap. Comfortable indeed, but a dress like this needs a different type of fabric (in my opinion). It almost feels like a thick jersey knit because of the stretchiness.  Because of this it will definitely show any lumps and bumps. You'll need some sort of Spanx  too smooth things over if you're self conscious like myself."
4.0,"I was amazed at how comfortable and flexible these boots are. I'm a size 9.5 exactly. I usually get size 10 for comfort. I ordered a size 10 which is a 41. I normally wear between a size 42/43. I loved these boots so much I went ahead and ordered a size 11. I'm sure it'll be a perfect fit. I just needed a bit more room around my toes. If you're a 9.5-10, I recommend ordering a size 11, which is 42. The size 11 is nothing like the US size 11. Getting a size bigger is wise. They run one size small."
4.0,Its nice that it comes with 2 straps better as a little purse. A little too big for a regular cell phone to hang from a purse
4.0,I love this bag!  It's a perfect size and shape with just the right number of pockets.  The only thing I'm hesitant about is how long it will hold up since I use it as an everday bag.  But the price is reasonable enough that I can just buy another one when this one wears out.
4.0,As expected from true spec pants but I was unhappy that they had a zipper fly they don't typically last as long as the button-up fly
4.0,Great quality. Runs small..order one size up.
4.0,I love this shirt.  You don’t run into CRAMPS merch every day!  It runs very small for an XL and even as I find myself at a relatively svelte 190ish ... it rides up like I’m a young Gwen Stefani.  Just order a size up from whatever you feel comfortable in.
4.0,"Nice soft material, cute ruffle accent. In my opinion, it runs at least one size small. I would order up."
4.0,"Nicely made, darker than pictured."
4.0,Great long sleeve shirt and lightweight. The arms are a little short though. I got a medium and wished they were larger.
4.0,I bought these for my grand daughter but they were too small. I returned them and ordered the next size larger. Hopefully these will fit.
4.0,These are my faves look better in person
4.0,"This is a rugged apron. It has a lot of surface area that protects me from getting wet when I grind cabochons.  In comparison to other aprons, it is on the heavy side.  It comes with two straps that you tie on the apron to make the waist strap and neck strap. Since the straps are made from thin material, the weight of the apron causes the neck strap to be uncomfortable.  To solve this, I cut a shoulder pad off a carry bag and added it to the neck strap.  This solved the comfort issue.  I would recommend the manufacturer add a pad for the neck strap.  I would give it 5 stars if not for the neck strap."
4.0,"The material is very comfortable & the color matches exact to the photo online. Only dislike is that it runs about 2 sizes smaller than typical, especially in the arms."
4.0,"The Filgate Card and Cash Sleeve is a minimalist wallet that works well for folks who want a small footprint or need to be discreet.<br /><br />The Filgate wallet is a very simple design – a piece of full-grain leather folded and stitched on two sides to create a pouch. The leather does not seem like it is high-quality but good quality nevertheless – and the stitching is clean.<br /><br />The slim design makes it ideal for a front pocket wallet which is what I use when traveling overseas. The trick for the minimalistic approach to work and for the wallet to be discreet is not to overload it. I find that my ID card, two credit/debit cards and about three bills are ideal capacity of this wallet. This allows for the cards/cash to be removed and inserted with ease. The cash bills need to be tri-folded and since they are shorter than the height of the wallet, you will need to pull the cards out to access the cash. You don’t want to be fumbling with your wallet in public in a not-so-reputable country or location.<br /><br />The wallet does have a notch at the bottom to make it easier to push the cards out. With a little practice, you can push out just the card you want. As with any leather wallet, expect scratches, a little stretching and exterior coloring to darken.<br /><br />Recommended – Great at a sub 10 buck price."
4.0,Love this dress! So comfy and cute. The price is amazing. LOVE!!!! Its a bit more coral in person.
4.0,I like them but some were extremely hard to put on.
4.0,"This is a very lovely, but very delicate necklace. As other reviewers have stated, the chain isn't the best, and likely will not hold up to daily wear for very long. I purchased this to complete a costume for a masquerade themed wedding, and it was perfect. Ordered it on Oct 3, and it arrived the morning of the wedding on Oct 10. The galaxy dangle has a good weight to it, and is a completely encapsulated unit; the color is vivid and image is crisp. The moon bit is slightly lighter, but not unpleasantly so. Would recommend as a costume piece as is, or as a daily wearer with a more durable chain. Price is on point, regardless of its minor shortcomings."
4.0,"Nice quality and cute design.  Exactly like in the picture just a bit short in length.  Overall, this top is great to wear with anything."
4.0,The t-shirt is not slim fit
4.0,Pretty earrings.  The three color choices are great.
4.0,"I sent it back because I didn't realize it was a roomy swing dress and not fitted. The colors and design were great, but it would have been so much better and flattering if it was fitted. Good for those that want to hide a belly or pregnant."
4.0,Ajusta bien buena relación precio calidad
4.0,"I ordered a size up, due to the reviews that said it fit a little tight, but I should have ordered my actual size because it's a little loose. Overall, I love it and it's very cute"
4.0,"The bag is very cute and well made. You can fit a few small items in there, I just wish the straps were a little bit longer, I didn't realize it said ""kid 2way crossbody bag"" in the title. That's my bad, When you have the straps at the maximum length, it stops at my stomach but it may vary depending on how tall you are. (I'm 5'7 btw)<br /><br />Do I think it's worth the price? Not really. At the time I only paid 39 dollars but now it cost 70 dollars, I know the price is probably going to go up and down. (I know a while back it was 50 dollars but then it dropped back to 39 again) Unless you're a sanrio collector, I don't think you should pay 70 dollars for this bag, I'd wait for a price drop."
4.0,So I got this for my daughter's hood. I wanted to sew on some trim. It was longer than I needed. The material was nice and soft. Once my daughter got her hands on it she fell in love with it and didn't want to take it off. Then my other daughter got a hold of it. Lets just say I ended up buying another one. They are 10 and 8 and it fit then just right. I gave it only 4 stars because it is pretty thin. But for the price it is well worth it.
4.0,"Got as a gift for my girlfriend. Little short, and a little thin, but looked nice."
4.0,"They are thinner than the originals but look good, easy to install"
4.0,"It's a comfy shirt. Stretchy material. It's pink like in the picture, most definitely not red like the description says."
4.0,"I like, but not love this dress. It is very comfortable and stretchy, so it's easy to get on. I have broad shoulders, narrow hips, and a small bust, and this dress is cute enough to keep, but not amazing for my type of curves. The pockets are on the front and I think it would look better if they were on the sides. I am wearing a strapless bra in my pictures. This will be a good, casual summer dress."
4.0,Really pretty but a little small when it is hooked.  I wear it open so it isn't too tight and still like it but wish it was a tad looser.
4.0,Although it's a really nice dress the color shade was more of a bright pink than the color shown. Material is thick and has little to no stretch so be sure to size up if you don't want a close fit
4.0,for my father
4.0,"Fits well, 2 tone color as seen in photo but definitely NOT slouchy and my head is not big. Must be slouchy on a baby head!<br />I like it though and will keep it."
4.0,"A little snug for my large male hands, but I could wear them.  Chose to save them for my wife."
4.0,This is a really cute outfit that looks exactly like the more expensive version. It arrived super fast and the color and style were as described. I ordered a medium in both pieces. The top feels a little small and I’m not very big on top. The waist band of the leggings really nip in my waist in a very figure flattering way. The cost was good. The array of colors good. I’m not sure how these will hold up but I’m happy with this purchase and cost per wear
4.0,They're awesome perfect for my 10 month old. Some colors don't match the bow perfectly but it's not very noticeable. I'm happy to have so many choices.
4.0,"The MIP display of this watch is good enough that you will unlikely pick up any other Casio negative display without a MIP display. Having said that, it’s still slightly illegible from certain angle. The metallic blacked out bezel shines under light and looks muted otherwise. It overall gives a premium and stealthy feel to the watch. The one thing that’s really cheap with the build is the buckle—it’s flimsy plastic! Every time you pick the watch you can’t help but feel the cheapness of the plastic-ky sound the buckle makes.<br />Coming to the features, I’m not a smartwatch person and I don’t use the Bluetooth function (you have an airplane mode). Online reviews say it’s smartwatch capabilities are just gimmicky. The step counter cannot be turned off. I tried using it and there is a difference of 2000 steps between the values recorded by my iPhone and this watch. I suspect the watch is not accurate enough (but you can still use it as a reference to make sure you hit the same minimum number of steps each day). Another feature which I did not see mentioned anywhere is the display automatically turns off if left stationery for prolonged time. When you pick it up, the display comes on again. This saves battery but I personally don’t like this smartwatch style feature. One thing I like with regular watches is being able to look at the time from far and this watch has a clear enough display that allows that but it is ironically turned off (like when I wake up and don’t want to see my phone immediately). The basic time display is so good and neatly organized with nothing but the time and date. You can also have a screen where the local time and a second time zone is displayed simultaneously—an especially convenient feature if you are living abroad. The stopwatch counts only in increments of one seconds, not a deal breaker. I don’t use the tide or moon phase features and I don’t think serious surfers would rely on this watch either. In reality, for most people, those features are about as useful as the average Rolex owner needing a 1000 ft waterproof rating. Good to have but unlikely to find use of it.<br /><br />To summarize, a really well built and killer-looking watch with a brilliant display. Buy it expecting just this. Everything else are just gimmicks. Casio could dump these gimmicky features and give this watch something else Casios are good at—like solar charging and Triple Sensors. Keeps the price same but ups the value practically.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this watch through Casio’s website. If you do the same, be warned there is no way to cancel your order once you hit place order. You can only return, which is not free."
4.0,a bit to heavy before putting stuff in it.
4.0,"Sizes run small, so order size larger."
4.0,"I got these skirt/shorts for the wife. She likes stretchy type material like this to wear. They're very nice quality, and look great on her. She is happy with them, and commented on how she likes the pleats on the back side. They're well made, good material, no defects. I can definitely recommend these."
4.0,For $10 they were worth the price.<br /> But I have another pair for 1999 that are awful<br /> Bought with the same company.
4.0,"Great pants I own them in both black and gray (the gray is a bit more like sidewalk concrete so a bit beigey). Awesome light weight material but not sheer, and easy to wash delicate/cold and hang dry. Can also be worn without the belt and not look funny which I love. They run a bit small; think juniors sizing. I usually wear a medium bottom sometimes large, as I have bigger hips. I have a 29&#34; waist, 42&#34; hip and ordered a large and the waist isn't too tight or loose. The hip/bum area is a bit tighter than in the picture but I prefer that. So if you want a loser fit go up two sizes. I'm 5&#34;10 and they sat right at my ankles like they do in the picture. All in all the two pairs I've ordered have become staples and I would order again."
4.0,"It fits good overall but when walking around with it on, the upper chest area tends to give a peak at the nipples or have constant &#34;nip slips.&#34; Maybe if that area was wider then I would wear this clothing item more."
4.0,This purse is great for travel however it is a bit stiff and difficult to put items inside. The outside zippered pocket is small and again the purse has little  give.
4.0,"Like how they look, but wood is a little rough."
4.0,I love the variety in these and they're truly beautiful. BUT I wish I ordered a size up because all of them fall out of my ear except for the marble looking pair. I've already lost two different ones. Just order up a size if you get these.
4.0,"Great price and much higher quality than I expected! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they seem a little on the small side for a size 7. They still fit, I'm just used to a little looser fit than these are."
4.0,"The quality of the material is wonderful! The design is super cute as well. One thing that I really like about these headbands is that they stay on. The packaging is also so cute, though that as nothing to do with the quality but rather the experience."
4.0,This top is short but very cute!! The material is a bit heavy - a knit but not see through or cheap. Looks cute w shorts - I have a pair of shorts w red pockets so it’s perfect see pic (excuse the mix match but I was just trying it on)
4.0,Used it to replace a Corum band. Worked with some mods.
4.0,"Good fit, soft not cheap fabric. Minus one star because the straps are a little cheap and a little scratchy. But for this price I ordered them again in different colors. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,The charms could have been a little better placed & larger
4.0,"I love that I can change my fit bit bands to match my outfits. Only issue is that the white band was missing the metal clasp. But for the money for these 9 bands, I'm not complaining."
4.0,Love it!! It’s just super itchy<br />Ps. Bought it for a maternity photo shoot but doesn’t fit 😂 or just gives you the biggest wegy<br />Bought bigger size than usual too
4.0,"Good comms with the vendor when the item was delayed for a long time, but the sweater itself is not really sweater material. It's more of a thicker t-shirt type of knit rather than actual warm sweater material. XL is actually more like a L which I planned for but it should be known these run a size smaller. This would be a good hoodie for warmer weather 60F-70F. Nice metal crimps on the drawstrings, quality print on the graphic, and nice tight cuffs on the sleeves. Overall I am satisfied but feel like this could be $10 less for what it is. However, despite the fact that the artwork doesn't appear to be a licensed piece of artwork there could be licensing fees incurred by the vendor from the studio that made FlCl, so maybe it is appropriately priced. I'm just used to a higher quality material at this price point."
4.0,Nice for fall. Soft & comfortable.
4.0,Happy with the  product .  :)
4.0,"Love it, super cute...just a little on the big side."
4.0,Boyfriend found them helpful but said just like catchers shorts work well!
4.0,I love the dress but the top is cut somewhat small.
4.0,Smaller than what I expected. Good for light scarfs.
4.0,They are very pretty but the design is coming off and i have to glue it back.
4.0,I love shawls.
4.0,Needs a tag. The only way to tell what’s front or back is to put it on and feel it out. Otherwise it’s a nice shirt
4.0,"I went a size up because of the reviews I had read. It's a little big, but it fits okay. I like this shirt and the quality is good. Overall I'm happy with my purchase"
4.0,I like it but it is a little big on me.
4.0,Very cute and sturdy! The purple is more of a magenta than a royal purple as it looks in the photo. They fit my toddler better than the adult sunglasses she keeps trying to steal.
4.0,It's really pretty and the color is just perfect. I get many compliments on this piece and some assume it's expensive. The clasp could use some improvement as it randomly comes undone. But I tend to check on it frequently when wearing it. Other than that this is a great piece to add to your collection...
4.0,Snug fit! Need a XL.
4.0,"Love the size and amount of &#34;stuff&#34; it holds. I ordered the brown leather and it's a bit more orange than I was anticipating. I wish there were more color options, I would definitely get another one."
4.0,"Overall, this is a cute dress.  It can be worn casually or dressed up depending on what you need."
4.0,"Perfect for any “friends” fan! Sturdier than I expected, not flimsy or lightweight."
4.0,Super cute great size great for the beach. Got for my chalk couture ink
4.0,just asdescribed
4.0,Nice color and comfortable. Size small was perfect and can add a loose belt.
4.0,Breathable and comfortable. You can dress this up or just wear it to relax looking cute while doing so.
4.0,Nice top to run around and do errands.
4.0,"I am a hockey dad.  These gloves keep my hands warm in the ice rink.  The finger tips are a little wide, so sometimes my finger will hit the wrong letter when typing on my phone keyboard, but the warmth is worth correcting the mistakes."
4.0,"Fast delivery. Xmas gift for my husband with two other hawaiian shirts.  This one was lighter material, rayon maybe.  It fit fine and he likes it."
4.0,"As far as comfort goes this gets 5 stars, but size wise it does run a little bit bigger than I expected."
4.0,I love them 😍 super cute
4.0,"Fit great, will be perfect with my dress wool overcoat"
4.0,"The gloves didn't fit me as they were too small and I bought a large, but I decided to keep them and give it as a gift to someone with smaller hands. The seller allowed me to keep the gloves and gave me partial payment back."
4.0,Easy to put in love them.
4.0,Soft and cute. Exactly as pictured. Kind of thin but still good! This is long if you are wanting to wear it with leggings.
4.0,"I really like these shorts, but they seem to run a bit larger than some other Nike clothing. After wearing these a couple of times, I wish I had bought a size smaller."
4.0,Perfectly look and fit.  Combination of fleece and leather.Priced high. Just not sure how long will they  last - some doubts  about quality of soles.
4.0,Fit perfectly wish it was more low cut but it’s very cheeky and flattering
4.0,Looked nice. Felt and Fit Good.
4.0,This was too small but it’s ok for swim team for my son. The white string can be on the way when swimming though
4.0,"This looked pretty big so I bought an XS. I generally wear a small, but every time I've bought loose looking lingerie, it's been too big. I'm 5'5&#34;, 110 lbs. The XS fit well in the top (A cup), but was too small in the bottom (fit like a bathing suit which was weird for the open crotch).<br /><br />But! It's gorgeous, so OH WELL."
4.0,"The material is kinda different. Not sure if the lint look of the material is intended but you can’t pick it off…..I’ve tried. Regardless, they’re a great price and cute and I didn’t purchase them to wear any place except home. These sweats are cute and fit great so I’m happy with this purchase."
4.0,Il is great. I would recommend this purchase!
4.0,"Really liked the cell phone crossbody bag.  High quality and details made this bag what I was looking for. Unfortunately,<br />the zipper was 2 inches longer so I chose to return the bag."
4.0,It's cute but loose. I was kinda hoping it would fit better around my chest. I got a large with being 5'3 165lbs and 36 C. Sounds like a good idea to go to a large since people said it shunk when washed but I would say if my partner don't like the look probably will order a size down personally. Overall I love the dress just not the fit.
4.0,Had to order a replacement because 1st lock had locked itself in shipping
4.0,Glasses really good and would have given top rating if the clip was larger. Just barely fit on my glasses making it hard to put them into place.
4.0,"smaller then I thought , but they are nice"
4.0,I needed lots of slots for my 27 credit cards.  This is just perfect in the way it securely zips close. The pockets on the side are very useful as well.
4.0,"Great fit for my needs, and at a good price. A much nicer looks than the elderly sunglasses found in the stores."
4.0,Its cute but should have gone up a size.  It's a stretchy material which I didn't expect because I specifically asked for cotton shirts in the search. It's a cute style tho.
4.0,"I have been looking for a terrific sweat wicking shirt for my kiddo.  This shirt is very effective at wocking away his sweat and keeping him cool while playing ball.  It ran a tad smaller than i was expecting but it fits really good and these are supposed to fit like a glove.  So I would order it true to their actual size.  The material is vey nice quality and he says it feels comfortable.  Care is easy but I don't dry it, I just hung to dry.<br />It also does a great job of staying put and not inching up when he is playing which is wonderful You don't weant to be messing with your clothes during a game!<br />I received a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Nice cap it was to small needed a larger size.
4.0,"Nice slippers, but my son is a size 12.5 and these did not fit his foot. They were too small. I'll have to send them back."
4.0,Shirt is cute. Doesn’t have the “faded” look like in the listing photo. Thought the material would be a little bit more sheer. Has a bit of the tight stretch  material so it’s a little tighter than I’d like.<br />If I was 15 pounds smaller it would fit great 👍
4.0,"These are very beautiful glasses, what I do not like about them is that they are small for sunglasses. I like my sunglasses to be larger than<br />my regular prescription glasses. My intent was to have my prescription put in these so I would have a pair of prescription sunglasses. I am still going to keep them and have a second pair of prescription glasses that are really beautiful for dressy evening wear."
4.0,"Loved the dress, I get a lot of compliments on it. My only complaint is that in the arm pit area the dress is a little loose. But I also don’t have a really big chest to fill it so that could be why. Otherwise I really like it"
4.0,"Nice fit- more fitted than it appears in the picture but not tight- just enough to give shape. The neck is higher than I anticipated but it looks nice with a long necklace. Comfortable. Fabric is a little funny feeling, but not bad."
4.0,"Love the sweater, however I would order a size down. Will be ordering one more color in a smaller size."
4.0,I LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CAR RUNNING AND USE HOUSE KEYS AT THE SAME....
4.0,"I bought these because my ears started to get irritated and infected from the o rings in my previous taper set, i LITERALLY just opened them and put them in, i was at a 4g(or so i thought) when i bought these, but the 4g (5mm) spirals felt a little loose so i went up to a 2g (6mm), right ear went in without any luberication, however my left required lots of it and had a decent amount of resistance so these are definitely sized correctly, my only cons for these is they feel pretty cheap(they are very light weight though) and i never received a 10g set of tapers(not the end of the world as that size is MUCH too small)"
4.0,This is as described. Very thin material. you will have to wear something under this. I bum around the house with it and plan to wear it on the dock.
4.0,Very cute and girly details. One negative is that a few letters were incorrect on the words on the chest: SPACE RANCER instead of SPACE RANGER and LIGHTYLIE instead of LIGHTYEAR (you can see this in one of the detail images). I was able to use a sharpie to add in lines to change the letters to the correct ones and it looked pretty good except the last letter in Lightyear.
4.0,"The dress is very cute.  Nice pattern.  I’m 5’3”, wear a size 10 pants and have a large D size bust.  I bought the large. The dress came past my knees, so I had it hemmed up.  I’m in my 30s and feel it’s a too low cut for the office, but my bust is large so it’s very noticeable.  A pin or stitch to keep it in place will work.  The reason for 4 stars is because the material is a bit thin. It may show through in bright sunlight, which is something I’ll need to consider when wearing.  Overall, Im happy with this dress though!"
4.0,Looked cuter online.
4.0,I received many compliments on the dress. The fit was perfect for me.
4.0,nice patterns of the jacket kind of snug on the arms.
4.0,"I really love this onesie. I have spent a few nights (sometimes days) wearing it.<br />The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is that the sizing is inconsistent. I purchased a &#34;large&#34; because of the previous reviews, which was the right decision. The problem with the sizing is that the legs and the arms fit pretty well, not snug and not too loose but the crotch area hangs very low (the bodice part is way too long). So if you are skinny and tall, this onesie is for you. But if you are vertically challenged with extra meat on your bones, I wouldn't suggest buying this onesie.<br />P.S. the flap is fully functional!!!"
4.0,"Fit well, maybe a little thinner material  than expected."
4.0,"This was just what he was looking for.  Good, Comfortable fit.  Medium weight with good stitching.  I would consider buying more"
4.0,Just right for the project I’m useing them for
4.0,"These are comfy, SUPER long (love it) and thick material. Good buy."
4.0,I love it except for the buttons on it.
4.0,I'm not a cowboy & not trying to be one but needed a country hat. This turned out to be perfect. It fits well & is crazy comfortable.
4.0,"Fabric is somewhat thin, but not too thin that you need a slip. Also runs a little small. I am tall and big chested and had to size up."
4.0,Ear rings are very light weight Beautiful design rose gold. The only issue was that I wanted them Silver. I don't use or know anyone whom uses rose gold.<br />I would definitely recommend this item.
4.0,"I picked up this wallet when it came out.  I have been getting sick of the bulk of my clutch wallet (I am a lady).  Not only is it something I have to hand carry or carry in my purse, it has a habit of warping my cards and accumulates a lot of bulk.<br /><br />I have only had the wallet for a day, but so far so good.  The first few times I put my cards in, the frame was pretty tight and I was worried that I would always have to take out cards one at a time to get the one I want.  After a few times pushing the cards in and out, the frame is a bit looser and I can push out multiple cards at once.  Even as the frame has loosened, it still holds the cards tightly enough to keep everything in.  I have flipped the money clip around to make it easier to slip cash into the clip without the whole clip pushing out."
4.0,"Love the stripes, but the material making you warm, but that's what you get for that price I guess, but all with all nice blouse."
4.0,"These are a bit chunky, but cute! I thought from the picture they'd be a bit smaller and more delicate, but they still look nice."
4.0,This is a cute dress.  Very casual with the sash tying in the back.  I had to reorder in a larger size as it runs a little small.  the second dress fit great.  Good buy for the money.
4.0,Strap isn't exactly quality but it's usually a step up from whatever cheap watch you just bought. I bought this to replace the strap on some $20 watch I bought.
4.0,Very soft. Fit is mostly as expected but the v-neck sits higher than I expected.
4.0,This is a really cool pair of earrings if you are into the industrial/steampunk look.  I got a lot of compliments on these.  I would not recommend sleeping in them as they are pretty much actual screws and the backs are very sharp and will stab the side of your neck.
4.0,It looks good but it changes the colors to Red around me afte awhile it's somehow hurt my eyes
4.0,"good size bag for work.  not too big, not too small.  I have this bag for 1 week and I like it so far."
4.0,Love the purse but I hate the droopy third inside pocket.
4.0,"I love it, very vintage and affordable. The chain is long too and that is a plus for me. Not a bad piece of jewelry for the price."
4.0,Help me see better during night
4.0,"for a little girl, they were kinda of larger than expected but over all good quality"
4.0,"The fit is comfortable and loose. The material is thin (I prefer a thicker one), but a good fall season weight."
4.0,The shoes look good and seem like a good value. But they were huge. We ordered size 4 for my son who was about to move to 5s and these things were way too big on him. We had to stuff paper towels in the toes so he could wear them. Buy a size smaller and you should be ok.
4.0,"Love the fit, only downside was the material, lots of blemishes and strings. Cut the strings but there are lines where they were and the dye didn't cover but still like the dress! Depends on where you are wearing it, mine was for cruise/beach side so it worked fine"
4.0,Looks even better than the picture! Great for the price.
4.0,Ran a little big - didn't fit my baby til she was about 1 (she's a baby size 3) But they are super cute and the no-skid works great. Love them.
4.0,"I purchased this for Halloween parties.<br />The shoulder straps could not stay on my shoulders to save my life, most likely due to some error on my end but no instructions were provided on how to put on the costume and it does come with a few pieces so it would help to have instructions for slow people like me.<br />Velcro would have been ideal to use on this costume to help it hold.<br />Pants were very thing and very short so it came up under my hips at a weird spot."
4.0,I love the way they look on me. The old school vibe it's so on point. I have a fat face but it's still sexy on me. Try them they're to cute!
4.0,"The hat is just right, fits excellent, giving the perfect shade."
4.0,"Nice belt, but a bit on the large size"
4.0,Material was not too thin. Had pockets. Comfortable.
4.0,as shown in picture but top is a bit squarish instead of round curving. but very solid and good for price.
4.0,Cute socis!
4.0,"Pants are great, but color description is not right, the pants are not gray , they’re navy blue, I don’t care about the color so I’m keeping them but they should be more specific about the color description."
4.0,The color and material are gorgeous. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I thought it was a sweater and the material is very thin. Excellent price and the packaging is really nice.
4.0,"The top was great- the hakama front belt straps were kinda small for me- I’m 6’4” and over 200 lbs and I could barely get them to wrap around my waist twice, not leaving enough to tie a proper knot. The height was perfect though!"
4.0,"Good look and good fit. This does fit a little large, so ordering your actual size will work."
4.0,"The print was muddy and overlapped.  Considering the hello kitty print was the whole reason I bought it, this was disappointing.  It was too large for me to wear as a mask, it kept slipping, but I am smaller than average so it would be a good size for most.  The pocket for a filter was just an annoyance and would slide and fold up during use, altho this may not happen for an average sized person.<br />Edited to add that the seller contacted me to try to make right the blurry print  and sent me another set.  The sellers do seem to be sincere and helpful, so I added one more star for excellent customer service.  The new ones they sent me do appear to be a bit more snug and a higher print quality.  All in all,  I would order from them again, but not this particular item."
4.0,What a great product. Good quality and price is fair
4.0,Nice quality but too thick for my neck.
4.0,"A wee bit tighter than I'd like them to be, but they stay put much better than all my other headbands. I like that it's a pack with several colors in it so I can color coordinate with what I'm wearing, if I want."
4.0,"Good price for what it is, fast delivery."
4.0,"I love the dress itself but unfortunately it’s just too large at the chest. It fits great at my waist and such, but the chest area is just too big for me. It’s still cute regardless. For reference, I am 5’5, around 150 pounds and I ordered a medium"
4.0,"True to size. Someone made a review saying they were ""muddy looking"". the pair that i got was not, they are very bright and colorful. The only thing is, they aren't even close to the same stone pattern"
4.0,Good value for money. Would’ve liked a different color for the second choice.
4.0,"I like this dress. Four other women ordered the same one for our bridesmaid dresses. The material feels sturdy, and not at all cheap. There are a few different ways to tie this dress, which is a definite plus. There is a zipper on the side to aid with the application of the dress, though I found it was not needed. It is very nice, and would be something to wear to a formal or semi-formal occasion. My only con to this product is that the two seams on the bust are... Odd. They make nipples look constantly erect. Just a warning."
4.0,"I thought this earring is a little bit longer. this is nice but the only thing that I don't like is, it is short not really a danggling earring. Pretty stone."
4.0,"I am a 40 D chest and 140 lbs and ordered a size up. I originally ordered an XL which I exchanged for a L which is a perfect fit. The material is very stretchy and very accommodating.  The taper in the waist is very flattering. This is shirt is clingy without being tight of uncomfortable.  Fits perfect on the hips and stays in place that you are not having to constantly adjust. the key hole make this just sexy enough without being to sexy for the workplace in a business casual environment but fun and comfortable to wear anytime. Material is breathable and is well made and holds up well after multiple washing. I pair with leggings to get that smooth look that I dont get when wearing jeans with this top because of the belt. Hoala clothing is a go to brand for me.  I see many of the same styles in different brands, but I know I am getting great quality and fit from this brand.  Will be buying in other colors<br /><br />If my review helped you, please click the helpful button. Or comment if I can answer any other questions &#60;3"
4.0,"These took a couple weeks to arrive and I wasn't sure what I was going to expect.<br />Luckily, these were better than I had expected and anticipated.<br />They come in a simple plastic bag with bubble wrap around them, but they are very pretty.<br />No giftable box here: just ready to wear straight out of the bag.<br />The picture really doesn't do them justice.  They have a nice weight to them and they are consistent throughout the design front and back.<br />The clasp is where I took off one point: it was a bit too loose but a simple bend of the clasp down 1mm made them catch on the loop perfectly.<br />I was afraid that they were going to fall out, if the clasp didn't keep the ear wire tightly, but the adjustment made them completely tight.<br />The color of these is very pretty and not glaringly 'bright' or 'cheap' looking, like some less expensive jewelry items.  These are metal and the laser etched surfaces are intricate and delicate.<br />These didn't catch my hair at all and had a nice weight so that they hung evenly.<br />Very pretty.  Just wish they didn't take so long to arrive and in such 'blah' packaging.<br />If this was helpful, please click 'yes' below. Thanks"
4.0,This is a great product and looking cap my only concern is the velcro material on the back.
4.0,"Good quality, satisfied"
4.0,Great quality but way to big. Order at least 1 size smaller than you really want!
4.0,"Overall, we were pleased with the appearance and quality of these boots. Comfortable and very cute on. Our only comment would be that you need to buy a half size or more above your normal shoe size."
4.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift, the art and everything is immaculate. It also got him very well. He's 5'8 and 120 pounds, so I got him a large bc of his broad shoulders and it fit so well."
4.0,"Very cute jacket! I usually wear a Large or XLarge, but I had to order a XXL. This jacket runs small!"
4.0,good deal for a big pack of chones.
4.0,Would like it bigger
4.0,It's no big deal just that this is not a stack of a bracelet it's one bracelet. I really like it. I gave it to my sister-in-law and she loves it. I just thought that it was stackable.
4.0,The shirt is super comfy but it does wrinkle easily.
4.0,"Looks real, but will hurt alot and may cause irritation of the skin if worn for long periods of time."
4.0,I purchased a large based on the size chart included with the product images and I have a 38&#34; bust. I wear a 32/34DD and weigh about 145 at 5'6&#34;. This is a nice soft jersey type fabric and I am happy with it. I will be able to sleep comfortably in it I believe. I was expecting something a little less body con though and more of a relaxed fit and this is not it.  I am happy with my purchase and will keep it. I think sizing up one more would not work either as the arm holes would then be too loose.
4.0,This was a gift to my son he loves it.
4.0,"I bought these same earrings about 15 years ago and they are one of my favorites.  I love the weight, size, size of the wires, and color.  I still wear the original pair often, but the silver has turned dark and won't lighten.  The new  earrings are exactly the same except the wires are significantly thinner and I question whether they will last 15 years (thus only 4 stars).  You can turn cartwheels and the latch stays securely closed.  Or hang upside down from trees."
4.0,These are fabulous. I just applied them about 5 days ago..I still have some intact very well. It must depend on the location of they are applied. The more oily the skin seems to depend on the lasting of the tatoo. They look pretty much perfect still on ankles and feet. Good on arms..faster fading in wrists chest and back. They r totally worth it I've gotten so many compliments and they r so fun! Look fab too and come off which I like 👍
4.0,A bit smaller than expected but the person I bought it for loved her birthday gift... I think its nice way to start off if you now getting into ear cuffs
4.0,"The sunglasses are actually quite big, which can be a minus for some. While wearing them your eyes are fully visible which is just something you should be aware of before ordering.<br /><br />Aside from that, these sunglasses are pretty neat. They protect your eyes from UV radiation, but they do not dim your vision in any way. Instead, everything just turns a shade of red which is awesome. For the first few days I wore these shades indoors at times just to experience the world through a different color lens."
4.0,I sent theses back when I sent the other3 pair just like them. And AmazonStoreCard has charge me for them . Said they didn’t get them.!!!!!
4.0,I really like this shirt but it runs a little small compared to other shirts I have purchased that are the same size. It is a little more fitted than I expected and has some stretch to it. I recommend sizing up if you want a looser fitting tee.
4.0,I ordered 2 sizes bigger than normal just in case. it's extra baggy BUT perfect for lounging and being comfortable.
4.0,"Yes it's  soft, looks warm and comfy but I ordered a large according the sz chart and it's way off. It's huge.<br />A Christmas gift for mom so now I will need to exchange it after Christmas leaving her without a gown for who knows how long because there are none in stock.<br /><br />Not good, not good at all!"
4.0,"received a larger replacement pair from the manufacturer because first pair didn't fit, and now they fit PERFECTLY! Very comfortable! Love them!"
4.0,I got the black and white one.  It is beautiful!  I can dress it up or wear it casual.  I like the quality of the material and the silhouette it creates.  It is super comfortable.
4.0,My kids love it. They filled it up with there Pokémon cards and use them to trade with there friends!!
4.0,Not the fabric I expected at all from an Adidas product. It was harsh not silly soft like most my hubby wears.
4.0,Love it needed to be longer not as long as it shows in this picture
4.0,These are cute but came badly creased from the packaging. One of the leg garters broke the second day wearing them so be careful. They’re fragile.
4.0,"Good quality, but run small. I bought a men's 12 for my husband, I wear a woman's 11 or men's 9.5 and the size 12 just fit me. Hope this helps with sizing for y'all."
4.0,The collars were intended for the use with sweater s and wool clothes to make a more elegant appearance. I am European size medium. The collars however are somewhat small - i.e. they leave empty space between. It doesn't help tighten their laces even to the maximum.
4.0,The functions were tough to figure out to start and the hands are hard to see.
4.0,I have several different pairs of glasses from Amazon and have bee please with all of them.
4.0,"Like it very much, but runs a little small"
4.0,"Nice blouse and very soft and comfortable, however as a petite woman (4'11&#34;) the sleeves were entirely too long which made them bunch up, so the cut work on the sleeves wasn't attractive. The whole effect of the sleeves is why I purchased this blouse, and if they can't stand out, the whole idea is lost. Sadly, had to return, but if you have longer arms, this would be a good choice. Overall the blouse I received was nicely made."
4.0,"Decent necklace, very pretty. Size as described. Clasp is a bit loose and I had to fix it in order to wear it withoit falling off, but was a simple fix."
4.0,"These are super cute and pretty good quality. Out of 30, I threw away 4 because they looked sloppy and 1 of them had lint in the white center but the rest were great!"
4.0,"This is a nice band for my FitBit Charge 2. At first I wasn't sure about it but I have come to like it. It has a LOT of holes for many, many options of size adjustment, which is very nice. I like that it has two little bands to hold the extra band length. Those little bands  have little knobs beneath them to stick into the holes, thus holding them in place. This may make no sense without seeing it but just know it is nice. At first I didn't like it so much because my shirt sleeve kept sticking to it because it is a bit rubbery / silicon-y feeling. But now that it is more used it does not do that anymore. It is easy to wash but quick to get dirty and pick up lint, dirt and such. Because it has so many holes and crevices I will not wear it during the summer when I am more likely to work out side. It is comfortable except when I do a lot of exercise and it gets tight, then it gets itchy. Over all I like it well enough."
4.0,"Really pretty but the post is to big to fit in my ears. If they fit, I would wear them everyday."
4.0,"The sizing was a little off, but I love the design - I little snug but it will work"
4.0,"My phone, wallet, headphones, and watch is red so naturally when looking for a bag I wanted something that was a darker red with black.<br /><br />A lot of these smaller bags are marked as ""unisex"" but clearly are made for women. What makes this bag different is that it is larger than what you see in the pictures. In person it has a very ""Sporty"" look and is great for carrying my Galaxy Tab S7 11 inch tablet, a can of soda, my glasses case, portable battery charger, and my GoPro.<br /><br />I typically keep it in the car but having all my things in one place is always nice and this bag seems like it will hold up well over time.<br /><br />I am writing this review 3 months after my initial purchase and I'm satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the zipper in the front of the bag is hard to open and close but not a deal breaker."
4.0,fits a bit small but very cute and washes nicely
4.0,This was pretty small for a 3X. It’s an Asian 3X which is more like an American XL. 😒
4.0,I likey!
4.0,I like it it's exactly as the picture showen fit me perfect
4.0,These sock are fine. The lack of 5 Stars is they are very thin material so they may not hold up. 😬
4.0,It was the wrong size
4.0,"Cute shirt, fit pretty well, just a tad small."
4.0,A little shorter than j would have liked but too cute to return.
4.0,I replaced the exact same bag because after 2 years the zipper broke.
4.0,Very cool bracelet I wish there was more like it. Quality seems good but for the price I can’t argue. 👍👍
4.0,"I just received this piece in the mail. At first I was taken aback by the fact that it is HUGE - it is about 4 1/2 inches from the highest point (tips of wings) to the bottom - but after wearing it around for a while, I realized how really gracefully it hangs down. Really well-designed in that regard. It is heavy. At first I felt that I was never going to be in a space where I could pull off or feel comfortable wearing such a large dramatic amulet and was thinking of returning it, but now I I'm going to keep it as it is truly unique and I'll wait until something happens that would warrant wearing such an attention-attracting piece.  It's hypnotic."
4.0,"Nicely made shirt. I would maybe buy a size, because the shirt did shrink up"
4.0,They looked great but had to keep them a little low cause they couldn’t cover my butt properly otherwise  😂
4.0,"It's good. While it looks a little darker in quartz than anticipated, it still looks very well-designed. If you are wondering how different it will look in actual person then there is that. Instead of looking milky white or transparent, you see more of the little black specks. Still a nice ring.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing the quartz in the ring is a little heavy. Nothing crazy but it does weigh a little."
4.0,Just a little small. I'm between a size small and medium. 5'3&#34; 140lbs and I ordered a large and bit for perfect. I love this top! The only downside is that the elastic is so tight comma I am constantly pulling the slaves down but that's how most shirts like this are made and less you pay a lot of money for one.. this top is a great top for the price
4.0,"So adorable and kept my little one warm (with other layers, of course) in ~30°F weather. Excellent for layering, fit well, very cute, and thin enough to be safe in the carseat. My only qualm is the button holes are slightly small and have to stretch to accommodate buttons and the fabric is not very elastic, so I forsee it getting worn out quickly. Do yourself a favor and put on feet first."
4.0,"Some I can't use, like the weed, mushrooms and such"
4.0,"It works.  Not sure it's actually leather and it's such a tight fit that I had to struggle to get the fob into the case, but it works.  The lock/unlock images on the back of the case don't exactly line up with those on the fob and you have to hunt around for the buttons on the fob."
4.0,"I didn't get a chance to check the sound or battery out because I bought this as a gift for my niece and nephew, but I was surprised at how heavy the material was!  It doesn't seem cheaply made at all! I hope they love it!  Thanks!"
4.0,Nice glasses. The tortoise frame has more lighter brown than I expected. Would not have bought them had I realized it. I have other tortoise sunglasses and my prescription ones are tortoise and I much prefer the richer tones in those. I suggest you enlarge the photo before you purchase sunglasses.
4.0,Great shirt. Have already received lots of compliments.
4.0,I like the dress and got compliments on it. Need at least 3 inch wedges to wear with it. I’m 5’2”.
4.0,"They were really soft and stretchy. I would recommend getting a size smaller. I usually buy larges but this kept riding down as I was walking.  It hasnt pilled up inbetween my thighs, but I've only worn them about 3 times. But they are holding up and are high waisted."
4.0,Looks great. Comfortable as well. Lots of compliments.
4.0,My son wears them and has no complaints at this time. Seem well made.
4.0,From the picture the necklaces wasn't the size I was expecting but still pretty nice
4.0,"I use it with a zip-tie to hold my black electrical tape.  As if hangs from my tool belt, I pull it up in front of me.  Pull off some tape, and then just ""let go""."
4.0,"I haven't worn them yet but they are cute. Very light,"
4.0,I will be ordering me of the 2 packs by this company. The quality at the price was very good. Was very unsure of what size to order. My daughter is that in between size where she still wears 8 in some things and 10 in others and bathing suits have been an issue. She has a size 10 bikini that the bottom is very baggy in and a size 8 1 piece that is too short. So i knew ordering on line was a risk. But being out of season and needing a proper fitting suit for a trip i took a chance and ordered the 10 thinking worse case she could wear it next summer. Well the fit turned out to be perfect-for right now and i honestly dont think they will fit come summer. So the actual sizing is a little small but not drastic. Will order a size larger next time. But im still very satisfied with the purchase. Suits are modest and cute for her age.
4.0,Not as described as compression. Returned. Needed true compression.
4.0,"It is a single piece of fabric with the heat crystals on it. Smells a little bit, but I'll try washing it and hope it will be ok. Generally I am hearing the material on a mask should be doubled, and, while this is flashy, it is a single."
4.0,"They were a tad small but they worked out. My son is a solid medium and his shirt was a little snug, same with his fianc&eacute; but again, they worked out."
4.0,This shirt is cute on. It is very thin material. U have to wear something underneath it. It fits good! I like it
4.0,Very cute I love it but it is too low cut in the chest area
4.0,"5'3, 135lbs, jeans size 27<br />I ordered the Med/Camo and they fit fine, could have gone with a small for sure. They are more of a sweatpant material vs. the rayon look they appear to be in the pictures. The camo is definitely gray with black tie for the waist. Cute & casual."
4.0,Great dress! material not as thick as I thought but very soft and comfortable. Wore it for communion Sunday.  I’m 5.8 and 205lbs. I ordered a 2x and it fits perfectly! Hope this review helps someone who’s trying to decide what size to order ☺️
4.0,"for the price, it's pretty damned great- my only wish is that it were wider with a slot to hold pipe cleaners instead of a rolling-paper holder."
4.0,This product is cute and very flattering! I’m 5’11 and this isn’t too short in the torso! Its a bit lower cut for me in the front so i just but a safety pin where it would be held together more so i don’t flash anyone. the skort tie in the front is a great choice to add a more feminine touch!
4.0,This dress is beautiful but I decided to return it because I found something else to wear. I’m 5’7” and wear sizes 8/10 jeans. There was a good amount of stretch to this dress and it was made with great quality. If you plan on dancing the night away in this you might be hot because this is thick heavy material. The color is just like what you see on the computer. I first purchased a large but that was too small so I got an XL and it fit
4.0,"The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that is is scratchy, have to wear a layered shirt under it."
4.0,I like the look and fit of these. Theyre great for summer. But they are see-through. Not a huge issue tho. The price was great.
4.0,"This is a nice handbag, but I found it too small for all of my stuff that I use for work.  The bag is stylish, and in great condition.  I use it for special outings, but it does not work for me for everyday use."
4.0,Perfect for making earrings and bracelets.
4.0,Band appears to be of good quality material. Fits the 22mm watch I needed it for. I like it better than the original leather band that the watch came with. I would say this band is a bit on the large size. I don't have small wrists but I am wearing it on the third from the smallest hole and can tighten it to the second. Total length with the watch is 10 3/4&#34; long. It is 9&#34; without the watch.
4.0,More durable than I expected for the price.  Even if they break at this point I would buy the same ones to replace them based on the wear and tear they have gotten in my kids use of them.
4.0,I like this but I had to return it. Only one side would snap into place. I do plan to reorder.
4.0,Cute! The fit is spot on. The sleeves and legs are a great length (I am 5'6 and 190lb - XL) I am ordering in a 2nd color!
4.0,"Mask is comfortable to wear & well-made, but it only came with 3 liners instead of 6 as advertised..very misleading!"
4.0,These are stunning. I love the color and detail. I didn’t pay attention to how large they are so I have to send them back. Too big to make earrings . ☹️
4.0,All the old problems about wearing a dickey are solved in this design. I wish the fabric had been a higher quality cotton instead of the lighter weight soft manmade fabric that looks a bit cheap
4.0,The striped material on top is sown so that the line is uneven and that was a dealbreaker for me. It makes it look messed up. Also the hoodie strings are literally the length of the shirt for some reason. Fit is as expected and near tunic length.
4.0,My  son like it.
4.0,would have like the skirt part to have some stretch to it. Wearing it to casual dinner on a cruise
4.0,"Super cute! I liked how it came with interchangeable pieces. I will say it did hurt my nose. I couldn’t wear it for long periods of time. I think maybe a few hours. Also I couldn’t seem to place it right it looked off center. Although I do love it, I just was curious what it would look like my nose was s"
4.0,"Despite being too small, it is looks awesome and is a great gift for any Pokemon fan."
4.0,They seem like good glasses I usually wear this strength but they seem too strong!
4.0,I got an xxl. I usually wear a size 10/12 in pants. They are WAY too big but I ordered them as PJ pants so I'm happy with them.<br />Only downside is they are a little see thru. If I wear nude or white undies it's no problem but anything else you'll for sure see
4.0,"If you buy these, but it small ... they need to fit tight to really look good.<br />Great product ... need to order it smaller so it fits tighter."
4.0,I like these will break out your skin if you have sensitive skin like me. I have to very careful about the type of jewelry that I wear if it is not Stainless Steel or Gold I will break out. Good buy wish they were bigger. On the picture they look much bigger than they really are. I should have read the size more carefully. I do really like these.
4.0,"I really really like this dress! It fits very well. I love, love ,love the stretch that it gives. Hits the waist just right and just right for the price."
4.0,"Love the slimming effect. Nice quality especially for the price! But, it runs very small, so I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits great."
4.0,"Nice basic hat.  Fits as expected.  Wool and reasonably sturdy but I won't be handing it down to my son.  Crushable and recovers, so a good hat for travelers."
4.0,Very cute and edgy.
4.0,Cute but very heavy
4.0,Love this night gown. It’s a bit bigger than expected. So soft. I would order again but a bit smaller
4.0,Beautiful! Buttery soft! I love it.  ~Jen
4.0,It was nice but alittle small.
4.0,"What you see is not what you get! Although color says beige1 picture looks more yellow, however it is a nice beige color. I fallowed what others have posted and sized up when I ordered, it fits wonderfully & is light enough that you can wear year round."
4.0,This is a beautiful necklace but I just wish it would have come with a longer chain then it did.
4.0,"Fits very nicely.<br />Excited to use it on our trip to St Thomas, USVI"
4.0,At first it was a bit confusing to put on and didnt know what was the front or back. Good thing I didnt get a small. It's stretchy well fit nice green color. I like it ALOT. #Flawless Felt sexy can't wait to wear on my honeymoon or date with my fiancee 💗😊
4.0,"I'm about 150 pounds, 5'7&#34; the Tag says US size 10. It fits very well. The material is a little heavier than I thought it would be. But overall very satisfied."
4.0,I bought it as a gift and she loves it my only complaint is it's not very pink
4.0,I am very pleased with this tank top. It's light weight and comfortable. It didn't shrink when washed and dryed.
4.0,Today fur felt fedoras are typically made exclusively from rabbit fur. In the heyday of the fedora they were usually made from a blend of furs. The higher quality hats would have a higher beaver content. Some were made entirely of beaver as this Stetson top of the line fedora is. The attempt is noble and for a modern fedora the felt is top notch. It’s not the quality of the hats of the past but economics of our era including the fact that the fedora is a niche item has made the cost of producing that level of fur felt impossible.<br />This is a beautiful hat. The drawbacks are the same for most modern fedoras. The crown is too low in relation to the brim. This hat is listed as having a 2 1/2” brim. It is actually  2 5/8”. It is a raw edge so I may take mine to a quality hat dealer that can trim it down to 2 3/8” which should improve the overall look. The construction is top notch and the trolly cord gives it a special panache. The weight isn’t as light as I hoped for but it isn’t heavy and the felt as a very nice luxurious hand to it.  The sweatband is supple and of the best quality. Taken care of this hat will still be beautiful many decades from now.
4.0,Orange needs to be a little darker. Overall love shirt
4.0,Looks like great material but cannot figure out how to clasp it in the center... Afraid to break the plastic pieces. Will be disappointed if I can't wear it.
4.0,With two broken arms I ordered them too large and they are easy to get off and on 😬
4.0,"I sincerely like this dress. The style, the color and the shape are great. My only issue is that if I choose to use the pockets, the dress loses its shape and the sides stick out. I have other dresses with pockets that don't do that.  I think if the pockets were placed a little lower, this issue could be resolved.<br />It's still a lovely dress."
4.0,Nice watch fits great
4.0,"I got this through the Vine program, but I do think it's worth the sticker price. I love the quality, and it sits very nicely on the neck. I think the length is perfect; it can alternate between a choker and a longer collarbone piece depending on how far you place the clasp. My only problem is that it does at times seem a bit yellow; I've worn it in a few Zoom meetings and I can see how yellow it looks on camera. In person it's a bit less noticeable i think."
4.0,"The bands fit perfectly with the Timex Weekender. However, I wish I had the choice to pick 4 bands, but still a great deal, compared to others"
4.0,"I just received my Pavlok2 and I’m hoping it works out. I’ve been oversleeping due to a health issue that’s been draining my energy. Now that I’m on medication for it, I want to get my sleep schedule back on track. I’ll update my review as I progress with kicking my habit.<br />I love the app, and the guide in the app for using the product and effectively kicking the habit. I wish there was a more thorough guide on what all the flashing lights and vibrations mean.<br />—————————<br />3/20/2021 update:<br /><br />The product works! I’ve been able to get up early again despite my fatigue issues. The app is fun to use and has many features. You’ll run into a few bugs here and there. For example, a feature that was supposed to activate when I brought my hand to my face didn’t work and only activated when my hand was down by my hip lol. Firmware updates also cause the product to unpair when you try to update it, but it will eventually work after many many tries. And the product may randomly unpair on you, which I found out one morning when it kept zapping me after scanning my QR code to stop the alarm.<br />If you have sensitive skin though, this may not be a good product for you. The metallic portions of the watch caused my skin to blister and left wounds after a few days of use. I even tried only wearing it at night, but woke up with new blisters. Hopefully they can invent a product that either doesn’t use the same metal, or only exposes the required metallic components when needed for the shock stimulus. I’ll likely reach out to the company to see what could be done and will update later."
4.0,"Beautiful,  exactly what i wanted. Would have given five stars, but they're not quite as long as the photos make them appear. They are not shiny gold,  but more of a matte finish. The arrows each have a different hue, and oint of miner assists more green than the other when day side by side,  but when I'm wearing them they look like they match really well. That's what i wanted,  but worth mentioning.  My ears are a little sensitive and i was worried Abbott the weight,  but really they're not bulky and heavy at all!"
4.0,I like this hat but I can't wear it because it is too small for my head :) It will probably fit my daughter when she is 4-5 years old.
4.0,The color is perfect; the material is a bit flimsy; the belt is floppy.
4.0,Nice material but is too small.
4.0,"I've tried on the socks and worn them awhile. It was not difficult to put the on. They are tighter than normal socks but they are comfortable. I purchased them because I am developing varicose veins. We travel by plane a few times a year and sitting for an extended period exacerbates the problem. Compression socks recommended. I have tried other compression socks, which are more difficult to put on and are uncomfortable.  These socks are bright colored with stripes. What fun!"
4.0,This is very cute snd true to size !
4.0,"It’s not a super warm material, it’s thick enough that it kept my sons head warm on Halloween"
4.0,love it but want bigger side
4.0,Very sporty and durable watch. Everything on it works just as advertised. I wear it to work and beat it up a lot and it takes it well.<br />The only thing I would change is the size - it's not adjustable and I have a small wrist. But I still love it and wear it everyday so obviously not a huge problem.
4.0,Just what my son wanted. He wears them to cover his natural teeth because he lost a couple. Looks good too!
4.0,The bar was so pretty ... didn't realize how frail the chain was
4.0,"For the price (i paid $90), these are good and work fine.  However, be advised that as the description indirectly mentions, the camera is only 3 megapixels.  So, objects in the distance will be unclear.  It records for a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes until becoming full and automatically shutting off.  It does that by creating .AVI files in 20 minute intervals with the last one being 15 minutes. Loud noises (such as crowds cheering) overload the microphone and sound about 1/3 static on the replay.  Other people can't really see the camera or that you're recording.  Lenses are polarized to reduce glare."
4.0,Was tarnished when it arrived. Had to get it cleaned before I could use it.
4.0,"The shirt is well made, brilliant colors, BUT it is not the measurements they referred to in the description. For the small size I purchased, the length is 1"" shorter and the chest is nearly 2"" shorter. 🙄"
4.0,"I LOVE the bottoms! They're tiny in the back and the top is super cute too but way too big in the wraparound part. I'm 5'1&#34; and about 114 lbs. 34C & the cup part fits fine, just not the rest of it."
4.0,"Yes!!!!  Titanium steel works for my sensitive ears!!!  Just a couple of things, the cut on the tail of the fish is crooked, and I personally found it weird that the post on the fish is at the tail......which I can now see in the picture.....<br />These earring are super super cute.  I have worn them in bed and in shower.  Beware, the earrings have sharp sharp corners, lots of poking action, changed out the backing for a silicone back, the fish hurts more than the cat. Why wear them to bed? cause I wanted to test my ears sensitivity and this was the only way.  But now that I've worn them for a week, I will not being wearing them in bed or the shower anymore (the fish always got caught on my loofah and towel).  If it wasn't for slight crooked tail, then this would have been perfect 5 stars.  But for the overall cost of the unit, not even mad about that."
4.0,A bit tight around the upper arm. I only wish is that it was a bit longer. Thankfully I know my way around a sewing machine so I'll just use the belt that came with it to make it a bit longer.
4.0,These headbands are cute and comfy all in one.<br />I work out in the heat a lot and I wanted something that was going to keep he sweat and hair out of my face and eyes. I found these to be a great solution and they look great as well. The fabric on the inside of the headband is soft and very absorbent.<br />The stitching around the product is perfect I didn't have one stitch that was cooked or out of place so that means that there is less of a chance that it will unravel and then I will have to fix it. I hat buying something that I have to fix I was so relieved when I seen that all the stitches in this was perfect.<br />The only thing that I don't like is that I would prefer for the headband would be elastic then being a velcro just because my hair gets stuck in the  velcro no problem to solve that you just make sure the the headband fits your head sized and just push it over the hair instead of closing it on your hair.<br />These are fashionable and they work very well for what they are intended for (I think that you could even use them as ear muffs in the winter time if you wanted to just because the fabric is so soft on the inside.<br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. The written review is based off of my own experience with this product.
4.0,Pretty decent.
4.0,"It seems like a nice jacket, it fits well, I like the thumb holes, zipper pockets, and the way the hood fits. Unfortunately the ""dark green"" color isn't at all what's pictured. In the product photos it looks like a deep teal. In some customer pictures it looked different, lighter, but I had assumed that was the lighting. In person it looks just like the customer photos, it's more like a medium-mint green color. I'm super disappointed because I loved the dark color that I expected but this lighter color is really not my style. So unfortunately I'll be returning it."
4.0,"One of the straps came out after about 6 wearings, but I was able to stick it back together. Another white strap got dirty looking fast.<br />But it was affordable and the charms have special meanings to me."
4.0,The jacket is perfect!!
4.0,"I love this anklet. Very pretty and have gotten a lot of compliments on it. However, it tends to snag on socks, and I have to be very careful with putting on socks or taking them off. Best for summer wear with sandals. Hangs low on the ankle, 2 settings on length, which is nice. Can rub on the inside of your boot if you're not used to wearing anklets."
4.0,"This is much longer than I expected- check the size. But it's of fine quality, looks neat, semi-helpful for opening letters and such. Slightly awkward to go into some pockets."
4.0,Cute jeggings. Have had them for a while now. I wear them at least once a week. They are very comfortable. Very dark wash! Looks great with anything!
4.0,"They  don't really come in all the cute colors as shown in the image. I didn't really like most of them, but they are good quality though c: that's for sure."
4.0,Nice design.  Bottoms sit low with moderate coverage.  Bikini looks great.
4.0,Too small. Need 10.5 next size up. Need to exchange.
4.0,The purse is big and I can put everything I need in there. I love this purse and recommend this purse.
4.0,It felt a little big on my neck. but looks perfect. Causes no irritation. but smells strongly of leather upon arrival.
4.0,This bracelet is everything I was hoping it would be it fits perfect and looks just like the photo I'm very happy with it
4.0,"I really like this blouse it can be used for dressy or causal outings, just be warned that the material is polyester and a little on the heavy side."
4.0,It's beautifully made but the legs are a little small if it's plus size most women have full legs 😃
4.0,"I haven't tried it on yet, but I know it will fit me.  It's more of a purple color, than blue.  The material is not as thick as I expected it to be, but I will wear a tank top under it and it will be fine."
4.0,Bought a large so it would be roomy and its  snug so small side of a medium.
4.0,"I wish they would show a picture of the chain on someones hand to show you some scale, cause just going by a 2mm doesnt really tell you much if you don't have a ruler near by. But yes beautiful good quality necklace."
4.0,The dress fits as described I am a 34C ordered a small as suggested and it fits great! The purple is a nice shade and the fabric is thick enough to hide imperfections :)
4.0,"Nice for the price. 5'2&#34; 130 lbs. 34B. Fit just fine, no holes, no complaints. Rose Pink was just as pictured, just as bright."
4.0,"No instructions.<br />You need to remove the &#34;little plastic piece&#34;<br />behind the stem to make the watch work.<br />Otherwise, just fine."
4.0,Charms are perfect size with good detail to them. Did not receive as much variety as pictured though.
4.0,"Better than I expected!!! I purchased it for the rewards cards that I have. But I decided to use it as my regular wallet, nice material and enough room to my stuff."
4.0,Muy bonito y satisfactorio
4.0,"I love the look and the way it feels. Work, out for drinks, very universal top."
4.0,Well made. Fit as expected.  Haven't washed it yet but hopefully it will hold up.
4.0,"It is cute, but it is too short for me.  I am 5'6&#34; and it fits like a standard top, not a tunic."
4.0,"Very nice I like them, they cuff the ear, loved that part of it"
4.0,"These run small, otherwise it was very nice"
4.0,I love my bag. It's very functional and all that I  need.  However I did notice a few loose strings upon receiving. Now there are even more loose strings.  Overall it's a great bag but a little enforcement may need to happen.
4.0,This bracelet will never be mistaken for high end jewelry but it IS a fun little splash of color and glam for your wrist.  It opens to fit all sizes of arms and my little niece even wore it on her ankle for dress up.  It can be worn day or night and is just a fun piece to add to any outfit.
4.0,"Bought for my friend and she loves it, &#34;beautiful and fit well.&#34;"
4.0,"Very sexy. Sheer in the sunlight, so be sure to only wear out after dark."
4.0,"I bought this to replace my purse, and it's working pretty well so far. I can carry just what I need to work and to run errands, but if I need a bigger bag I can just toss this in.<br /><br />The green color is not as bright as I expected--slightly more of an olive green. Sizewise, my Galaxy S7 Edge fits well into the left bottom inside pocket. I had hoped to be able to keep credit cards in the other pockets, but the slots are too big, so the cards fall out when you open it. I'm using the outside pocket for this purpose now which is handier anyway. I may find a small card holder to slip in there.<br /><br />It could use a couple of loops for pens, and an outside strap across the spine to make it easier to hold/carry. I'd also love it if it had a double zipper so I don't have to unzip all the way around. (Admittedly, these are all first-world problems.)<br /><br />The drawstring bag is only a bonus if you don't plan on using the wallet very often. Otherwise, it's a pretty useless little bag made out of the same material as those reusable shopping bags."
4.0,"Good quality material.  I like my tops loose to lounge around it, so purchased a size up and it fits great.  Gave one to my mom as well as we enjoyed Hallmark and Lifetime Christmas movies after Thanksgiving!"
4.0,"Love the product, as these can be used for multiple needs.  We have used these for Dogtag ring on the collar, the hanging of a Lucille bat, and many more!  Thanks for the great product!"
4.0,The sunglasses look just like the picture. Wish they hung a bit lower on the eyes
4.0,These are ok. They are thin enough to not feel them inside the shoe but also thin where it can still allow creases to happen. I also felt like they wiggled a bit while wearing them. Super flexible and will fit any type of sneaker.
4.0,This mens army green shawl cardigan for my review is slightly darker than advertised. It does fit well and a good sleeve length. The design is manly and does look good. I do like how it looks. A good gift for cold weather.
4.0,My daughter loves her personalized sport headband.
4.0,"Giving four stars because it’s really well-made and flattering, but DEFINITELY runs small.<br />I wear a small, ordered a medium, and will be ordering a large now, though I’m considering an XL.<br />My husband wants me to keep the medium. 😂"
4.0,"My father is a large man with large wrists (350+lbs large). So, I was concerned the band would be too small. On the contrary, it's too large. An easy fix for links to be removed; but, couldn't believe how big this watch is. Check measurements when ordering! I should have paid more attention.<br /><br />4 stars because the face plate does look plastic behind the glass and that could have been avoided by not having the little tabs visible on the inside. Otherwise, great watch for the price."
4.0,"Appears to be good quality. It's a little on the short side though. Fabric is strong and stretchy but a little translucent, so unless you want someone to see your tan lines you might need to wear an under shirt which I think kind of defeats the propose haha."
4.0,"I am 6'7 and the sleeve length is always the main concern for me when purchasing shirts.  I tried on the product and the sleeves were perfect 36 inch length from mid back to wrist/26.5 from tip of shoulder to wrist bone.  Quality was pretty good and shirt is warm.  Length of shirt was short and not what  expected.  It felt a bit small on my back, but I have a broad back.  I have another product from coofandy and I must say their products run small.  Overall Its a nice flannel shirt and the material feels comfortable."
4.0,Not sure about durability yet but it feels a bit stiff.  I suspect that it will show wear spots if one tends to wear belts tight.
4.0,"I was skeptical about this Echt dupe, but I love it!! Super cute on, (I’ll post a pic when I’m headed to the gym) the fit is perfect, I ordered a Large  Bc of the size chart but I’m glad I did! The leggings are surprisingly pretty comprehensive, so it’s good for that tummy control. Bra even is decent I usually prefer a M but the large fit fine.<br /><br />I am 5’0ft but I’m pretty curvy so the sizing chart was spot on. So I suggest following the sizing chart & if your inbetween a size, I suggest following your waist size if you want tummy control. Bc the leg parts a gods & stretchy enough!<br /><br />Only complaint I have is be mindful of the underwear you wear under it, Bc if it’s too bright it’ll show during the squat test. But I normally wear no show type of thongs so just go dark or dark/neutral tones & you’ll be safe! All in all great purchase! Will be buying again from seller!"
4.0,"Thinker than expected,  and adjustable makes them easy to use."
4.0,"Good design and comfortable, excellent material for the practice of exercise"
4.0,"I bought these hoping for something lighter than typical work gloves or rubber gloves, but stronger than disposable surgical gloves, and most importantly, a good fit so I can use my fingers instead of bludgeoning things with floppy cloth (which is what work gloves do when they're too big).<br /><br />Well, they're exactly that. They run a little bit small; I couldn't get my hands into the small size, but my wife likes them, and I bought a medium sized pair which fits perfectly. Still, these are really good at being a multiple-use, form-fitting glove that is as accurate as surgical gloves while being more durable.<br /><br />My one gripe is that the area where my fingernails are is unreinforced, so I'm pretty sure that the first part to wear through is going to be right there. I plan to do a little bit of reinforcing of that area myself to prevent that from happening."
4.0,Great product and fast shipping. The tie part stayed well all night. It looks great and very well made. I think it might be more for a female than a man though but it still worked great!
4.0,"Like the previous reviewer said, it is a bit lightweight, but I do prefer the lower profile of this thinner leather. It will fit a NATO, with some effort. YMMV"
4.0,It is the cutest outfit. The only thing... the crown was a little to tight on my daughters head.
4.0,It is exactly what I was looking for.<br />Very nice and well made.<br />I would recommend this to anyone. Seriously
4.0,Very nice1
4.0,Pretty bra. Well made for the price.
4.0,A must have when giving an AA or NA medallion as a gift.
4.0,The top was ok but I did not like the fit and the material on my body type! Ok top but not for me
4.0,These are great for my son.  He's starting to get into more clubs at school and a pair of nice boots with khaki pants look great.
4.0,"Look good for the price. I'm a man with large hands and forearms so I had to cut the gold part as it would not let me get the sleeve on, glued some elastic where I cut it and slipped it on with the elastic on the bottom side of my wrist."
4.0,Nice product for the price. They work quite well and are very pretty.
4.0,"It looks nice, but not my style"
4.0,It's super cute and extremely stretchy. The material is nice and I really like it.
4.0,"I liked the fit. It was comfortable. However, I expected the design to be on the side as shown in pic. Because that seam is in the back, I'll have to wear design in front and that's ok. Wanted another, but I'd prefer if design was on the sides."
4.0,"Great quality. Nice color. Very comfortable. I bought size 5-6, but the legging came in size 4 on the tag, it was weird- I was going to return it , but it fit good"
4.0,"Get lots of compliments on these, but I just wish they have the two nose holders so they wouldn't keep sliding down the sides of my nose. I'm constantly having to push them up."
4.0,Plastic needs to be a little bit thinner so that cellphone can easily be operated
4.0,"These help with night driving, and cut down glare from on coming head lights.  They don't make a huge difference in vision, but do help with on-coming traffic lights and any problem you might have with vision and seeing rings around the head lights, that bother your eyes during night driving."
4.0,The style will have to grow on me but it's cool overall..
4.0,"Case is fine, i'd prefer the cleaning cloth be mono-color but it does match the case."
4.0,"These shoes came quickly, packaged well,  they're a bit narrow, well structured, I will be wearing these for work. I am a registered nurse and on my feet for a long time."
4.0,"I have to returned because didn't fit me, (bust feel empty either it was too large or because I am small 5,3), but the dress is very pretty"
4.0,"Absolutely love the cute design! Its a tight fit, so order one size up.  I'm a size small, but got a medium.  It is also flirty and short at the bottom. Can't wait to wear this when it gets warmer!"
4.0,The color is nice also the fabric is quiet flowy not constricting I got a medium and I think maybe I could get away with a small . There is still room it's not as form fitting as it is in the picture also the leg/ankle isn't that tight
4.0,"These are good.  Unfortunately have a small knick in one lens in my vision.  Really annoying, but not enough to return. Wish they were darker.  Beware that company is giving free sunglasses in exchange for 5 star reviews."
4.0,"The boot fit a little narrow, but I was told Ugg boots will stretch over time because you don't wear socks. The boot is very comfortable. I usually get 9 in boots but I got a 8.5 just because the leather will stretch. They are cute & a keeper!"
4.0,"I'm 5'11"" about 150 lbs and typically order a medium in every brand. However I ordered this jacket in a Medium and it was way too big. Sleeve and jacket length were fine but it was too wide. I understand it's supposed to fit a little larger for layering, but this definitely needs to be a little more slim."
4.0,Really really wide without adjustments.
4.0,"Great Fit, Great Price!"
4.0,"I bought these pants to keep warm at home when you want to snuggle.  They are just a bit large, but that helps with snuggle power.  I'll buy another pair."
4.0,"So having now ordered more yoga pants than I every thought I would for my wife and daughters I can say these seem to be accurately sized and the builld quality is good enough that they should last about a year of couple times a week use.  If you like this style I think you will be pleased with these overall.  A solid 4 star buy and I would recommend them if you are looking for this type.<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,"A little too big for my 8 years girl, While the design is good."
4.0,"Considering that I size a 7M , I always have problems finding a hat that fits my head, this one does. it looks nice and is well made."
4.0,Medium fits like a small
4.0,"I really like the belts, they appear to be well made and the colors are nice. But in ordering, be sure  about the size because I ordered the XL and they were way to large. I had to returned them  and the charge to send them back by USP was $6.80! This company does not have paid return. So be careful in ordering."
4.0,This jumpsuit is comfortable and really cute. I am 5' 8&#34; 220 lbs and I  ordered an XL. It wasn't too short like a lot of other jumpsuits and rompers that barely come to my ankles. I didn't know when ordering that the straps cross in the back so be sure you have a racerback or strapless bra when ordering.
4.0,"Liked product, just wished sleeves were longer, skin exposed to sun. I'm sun sensitive."
4.0,These shoes look really nice for kids shoes and the inside had a nice soft cushioned sole. My daughter loves them. She carries they around and can put them on herself (she’s 2.5)
4.0,Very nice watch for the Snoopy fan.  It is a little hard to read.  You have to put together the band which is not a link type band but and expandable band.  Instruction did not come with the watch but they did send directions when requested (actually I figured it out on my own).
4.0,I guess it for right if you like your shirts tight. It kept rolling up my sides where the buttons are. I usually wear an xlarge but went up in size to a xxl and it was still tight. Not flowy like it shows. But the print and materials used were great quality as well as the sewing in it. Which is why it got 4/5 stars. If it fit better it would have gotten all 5 stars.
4.0,I like it but not as much as I thought I would.
4.0,It is a cute cut and it holds it shape after washing. The material is soft.
4.0,Very comfy! I received several compliments the first time I wore it.
4.0,Look the same as they are in the picture. One bracelet has a bad latch
4.0,"Great bright blue color, fits as expected. Good for running, no chafing under arms, soft material, no itching. Easy to hand wash while traveling, dries over night. Does not retain body odor. Only reason for 4 stars is when wet, this shirt has a very strong animal like smell, how I'd imagine a sheep would smell? Not super bad, but not pleasant either."
4.0,"My daughter, who is 7 and wears a 13.5/1 shoe, loves these boots. They are lined, which is great for cooler weather. However, she is swimming in them! We needed them immediately, so we just packed thick socks for her to wear with them outside, but I would have otherwise sent back for a smaller size (we ordered a 1.) Quality seems good and would order from this company again."
4.0,I needed something I could wear with jeans or wear onboard a flight that wouldn't look obscenely wrinkled on the other end.  This blazer from Eddie Bauer fits the bill.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:315593b63e651e3749eede4d522f63ce]] This shirt is So cute. Very lightweight for working out, but cute enough to wear out also. I love the material and the back, I got  many compliments on the back, I like wearing a cute strappy bralette or sports bra with it. I bought an extra large and it for me more like a large, with the back mostly staying open not draping closed, and it is shorter in the front then i would have guessed, but that could all be fixed if I bought a size larger, so definitely recommend buying a size up."
4.0,"They are much more pink than in the picture, but otherwise nice quality print and very comfortable."
4.0,"It's a nice costume. Fast shipping; I ordered on a Friday and received it on the following Wednesday.  I purchased this from Amazon seller Costumeree.<br /><br />The emblem on the center of the drape part of the skirt and on the boot covers, I'd say isn't as vibrant of a gold color as it is in the listing photo (perhaps due to lighting in the pic), but I'm fine with that and the costume otherwise looks like it's pictured.  The packaging was a nice touch, once outside of the shipping pack the costume is contained in a clear plastic (front) and fabric (back) hybrid garment bag on a hanger, with the same photo from the listing placed inside a clear pocket on the front.  This will help when putting on the costume since there doesn't appear to be instructions on how to wear the boot covers or how to tie them.<br /><br />The gauntlets (arm wraps) are quite large; I don't know whose size forearm they designed them for, because they are so big on my arms that they don't stay up on their own like on the model in the picture, and it's not like I have unusually skinny arms; they're average size.  However, I have easily altered them to make them tighter and they now stay up on my arms.  It doesn't show it on the photo, but there are thumb holes in gauntlets so that it lays over your hand a little better.  The &#34;leggings&#34; aren't really leggings, it's more like tights or stockings, so be careful if you bend over in the costume because it might expose you.  I'll be swapping mine for real leggings when I wear it.  The mask has a small circle of velcro on the straps to hold it together, although it's a little too big and isn't adjustable, so I'll have to alter that too.<br /><br />Overall it's a good costume.  It's not the best fabric quality and there are some stray threads you'll need to cut off on the gauntlets, but I think for all of the pieces that you get with this costume, it's a good price.  Since receiving it, I've only tried it on and made some easy alterations to the gauntlets, but it should serve me well when I attend a costume party in a couple of weeks."
4.0,very cute.  Went well with the cheong saam dress that we purchased.
4.0,"My son uses this to time the games when he referees for soccer.  It fits nice and he has small wrists.  Didn't like the directions.  I don't think they were in english.  We did figure it out though.  It's a watch.  The timer works fine on it once you figure out how to set it.  It has held up in the rain, etc. Good product for the price."
4.0,Perfect beach coverup! I love it and the little garment bag was a nice addition especially since items like this sit without being used between trips. I have already photographed 3 models in this for my studio and plan on ordering another for myself. It's a little more transparent then I would like but it's still too gorgeous not to love it
4.0,"Fits as expected, breathable material and looked great!"
4.0,"Good fit overall, I have not tested it sweat factor yet"
4.0,I go to the gym and due to genetics I have huge calves these are great and does not feel like I’m suffocating them. Only thing that’s a negative is that I couldn’t find one that was on the shorter side for length. Im 5’6
4.0,"They horns arrived today, but unfortunately one horn was snapped off. They shipped in a bag, which doesn’t seem like it would offer any protection for such a breakable piece."
4.0,Grandson loves it!!!
4.0,so far comfy and really like the look
4.0,"Kind of big for my teeny head but I love it! Soft fabric, easy to adjust, look great (if large!) and everyone is jealous of me and my cool hat. The backing for the embroidery makes the front of the cap bulge out a bit, so that is why it is so big on my head."
4.0,Really completed my outfit. I liked it
4.0,"I loved this dress, it had good detail and was good quality. I ordered and xl based off the reviews but it ended up being too large. I think a L would have worked. I am 5'7&#34; and I am 175. I gave the dress away instead of dealing with a return."
4.0,"Great glasses colors are vibrant but the only issue is that the lens could have been darker tinted. I bought a pair of these a year ago and they really block bright sun along with UV rays. The price of the 3 pack was very reasonable and they all came packed separately in the packaging. All in all a great pair of glasses, but I'll still keep my old ones for the really bright days."
4.0,I needed a hard case for my glasses as I broke the last pair in a soft case....I wear contacts most of the time so I figured I'd be able to carry a spare set of contacts as well as my glasses in this case....
4.0,Cute but kinda falls off shoulders and looks weird at the breast.
4.0,"I got The white one and it’s super cute but very see through. I’m 6’2” and 175, usually an 8/10 bottom and medium top. I got The large and it fits great. Plenty of room to not be tight yet still fitted. My only complaint is the see throughness of it."
4.0,He’s like the picture
4.0,For the price they are reasonably well made.  The order arrived in a timely manner.  The only real issue was that they had obviously been stored for some time and had a lingering musky aroma requiring they be aired out before use.  Not a big deal.
4.0,Inner lining is great!
4.0,This dress was actually much nicer than I thought it would be. I bought it as a costume for a 1920s party but was impressed that it doesn't look &#34;costume-y&#34;. It could pass as a real dress. I debated what size to get since I'd say I'm a 6-8. I went with the medium and am glad I did. It's a little roomy up top but I think the small might have been too tight through the hips.Takes a while to be delivered (from China). The underslip is a little short but the bottom of the fringe hits just below my knees (I'm 5'5).
4.0,"Great quality, just too small for the sizing. I would probably recommend going up a size for US customers (shirt shipped from UK)"
4.0,It would be nice if the skull was Stainless steel too.
4.0,"There are a lot of women's shoes in the world that seem to believe that we do not have all five toes, and these shoes are not one of those. My toes are FREE and in love with these shoes!!! They are cute, and comfortable, and so far holding up beautifully.<br />My only critique is that these are definitely larger than size eight, which is what I ordered. My feet slide around just enough that my feet hurt if I wear them for on days where I walk a lot, which is honestly most days for me. I am going to try and find a sole insert to see if that will ameliorate the effects caused by the sliding."
4.0,It’s super cute I used it like lingerie you can also use it as a costume the only thing  I didn’t like is that from the breast are it runs small I am a 38 D and it feels a little tight but overall super cute !
4.0,"I went by the measurements provided and it was an ok fit.  Ultimately not having buttons to close it really bothered me.  Maybe a zipper to partially close would have made me feel more comfortable in it.<br />It's a classic cut and other than the chest area well sewn, I would consider it again with a zipper or some dart pockets to bring the waist in a bit. It would go well dressed up or down and I could see so many uses for it, just not for this girl. You get what you pay for so don't expect a more expensive looking jacket, think big box retailer quality versus specialty or department store.  Still a good buy if you need to build up a work wardrobe quickly and rather inexpensively."
4.0,Perfect for my husband to wear to work instead of his actual wedding band.
4.0,"The shirts are comfortable, but they're cut extra small. I usually wear a medium-large. I ordered a two X just to be safe since I don't order offline much, and they fit like a medium-large."
4.0,This shirt fits great even though the sleeves are a bit wider than I had expected. It is a great shirt though and very comfortable. I normally wear a size medium or large in most shirts but wanted a bigger shirt and this was great! I wear it quite a bit since I got it and I love it.
4.0,Arms are a little tight but overall great trendy piece to wear to work!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, just a bit large"
4.0,Good quality but these are heavy and a little<br />Bigger than I expected.
4.0,"Takes a little bit to get adjusted to, and makes your feet, really hot.  Comfy, though!"
4.0,Great value in a cheap watch.It keeps good time....so far (One month!)
4.0,My toddler is just starting to get into 3T clothes. She is fairly thin but long. I got the ALINTU Toddler Sweater in 2# Blue Cat.<br /><br />The sweater fits big on her as I would expect but it's not super long. It is fairly wide though so this would fit well on fuller kids. I expect she will fill it in eventually but will probably be too short by the time it fits her better.<br /><br />The pattern is super cute. It's a light blue color with very faint small white polkadots. The cat is fairly big and the stitching around it is done very nicely. I was also surprised to see the cats hands move! My toddler got a kick out of that.<br /><br />The material is on the thinner side so this would be better suited for slightly chilly days but not heavy enough for winter.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice sweater for the price. If it was longer and thicker it would be 5 stars for sure!
4.0,My daughter loves them but they do have fuzzies after I wash them.
4.0,"I like the way it fits.  Perfect.  Can be worn to dressy or casual occasions.  I haven't worn it yet, but have tried it on.  Planning to wear it soon."
4.0,very very pretty pendant  took a star for the flimsy cheap looking chain  will be getting another chain tp wear with it
4.0,The person doesn't like wearing a wrist watch so he really loves it as a pinky ring. Glad I got this.
4.0,"Sturdy materials and good quality construction.  Haven't worn them in snow yet. I usually wear a size 7 & 1/2, went up to an 8 for thick socks and glad I did because they would've been too tight otherwise. There's plenty of room in the calves to tuck pant legs in, which is nice. The zippers are surprisingly smooth too. My only complaint is that the fur seems a bit cheap and will probably not hold up for very long. Also, I'm nervous that they might not be warm enough for the typical Minnesota January weather (specifically those subzero days), but we'll see... Given the fact that these boots only cost about $60 though, I'd say they're overall a good value."
4.0,It was a little too big but I still love it.
4.0,Great quality for price. My 6 year old loves them. Just order up a size. The size 1 is identical to his 13's.
4.0,Construction was better than expected.  I ordered one size larger after reading reviews that was perfect. Great value looks nice.
4.0,It’s super good quality but it’s way too small for me. I’m 5”11 and I weigh about 200 and the shirt only reaches my waist and the pants don’t go to my ankles. It sucks because it’s such good quality. It’s so soft and well made. I wish I could fit in it
4.0,Since I'm star wars fan especially having great interest in the jedi. I just fell in love with this pocket watch that has their Jedi order symbol.<br />This pocket watch is very cool. Comes with a chain that you can wear around your neck. I use it for work. So far I had two compliments in it.
4.0,For the cost these turned out great!
4.0,"Definitely made big. I ordered a small and I'm 115lbs and it's not as fitting as I'd like. It's still cute though. Material is cheap and thin but for $5, you get what you pay for. I still think it's a good purchase."
4.0,Love the style but the sides are too short for me.. I am 59 years old..not age appropriate
4.0,"These are all really cute and fit pretty well. The only reason I left 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to go tighten all the razor clasps, other than that they are a good purchase"
4.0,"The description states that the belt will fit from size 28 to 44. I have no doubt on the 28 but the 44 might be a bit snug. At a size 42, I found the belt to fit perfect but think it would be close to it’s limit at 44.<br /><br />The belt is very comfortable once in place. The closure or buckle is easy to fasten and the belt doesn’t creep open like some of this style do.<br /><br />The only down side I have found is putting it through loops. One side of the buckle is just a bit too large to fit easily through the loops. If I don’t remember to thread it all the way around on the smaller side, I have to struggle though half of the belt loops with the larger end.<br /><br />Overall, a really nice belt that is more comfortable to wear than the traditional leather belt."
4.0,It fits comfortably. True to size. Nice floral pattern and soft fabric.
4.0,It's very nice but runs small. My daughter wears 8-10 and we had to return size 10 and exchange it for 12.  Amazon was great though so happy overall.
4.0,"I had bought a Fourth Doctor scarf a long time ago and have since misplaced it. It was knitted by hand and was very long and thick. I loved that scarf and decided it was time to replace it as I have no idea where it is.<br /><br />The latest scarf was sent to me in a plastic bag ready for sale at a collector's store. It is very long at 17 feet and is quite colorful. I do like it very much, however it is not hand knitted and a bit thin. My original scarf is heavy while this scarf is lighter than expected. At the prices being charged, I was expecting a bit more heavy duty.<br /><br />The scarf is quite warm and does the job when it comes to the cold. It also looks great as well. Maybe there is a better heavy duty scarf out there for me in the future. For now, this one will do nicely."
4.0,The product is good. I was just a little upset because I didn’t get some charms pictured. Basically snowflakes were shown in every picture and I didn’t receive any.
4.0,"Nice screen print and it fits well but the shirt is a little scratchy. It's the cheaper nylon blend. If you are looking for a soft favorite, this isn't it."
4.0,I wear a 7 & 7/8 hat and these caps still fit great.. looks & feels good 👍
4.0,Not for Minnesota winters... Hands were cold for temperatures less then 20 F in less than 30 minutes (though the North Face label says &#34;very cold&#34;). The ETIP works just fine. The only gloves i found with touch screen compatibility and for temperatures down to 20 F.
4.0,"These are compression, so I expected them to be a little tight but they were super tight.  Love wearing them under my other workout shirts though."
4.0,it looked more red online.  it is bright purple
4.0,It's a belt. Hardware seems cheap but it'll do.
4.0,Ideal for price.
4.0,"Very nice, though not as nice as the micro modal ones."
4.0,"This is very cute, I got it for its light weight material and it is super soft. It fits my son great and has room for his cloth diapers. The only down side is the only snaps/opening is on the shoulder. So you kinda have to put it on like a pair of pants or coveralls, which could make diaper changes interesting. Very cute though!"
4.0,"I wore this yesterday for the first time, paired it with a thin gold belt and sandals. It was adorable. I had no less than three people comment on the dress and how great it looked. Win! The purple color is rich and true to the picture. I am a size 10, ordered a Large because I wanted it to be loose/roomy. It's perfect. I'd say the only downside is the pockets - cute idea, but make the hip area wider than necessary."
4.0,"I love the shape of these glasses. The fitment is perfect and all the joints are tight. My only issue is with the tint. The pink is so light that you can barely tell it's pink. I was hoping for a much darker pink tint.  I would not call them &#34;Sun glasses&#34; just because of that. Price was right and shipping was pretty fast. If you want a pair of slightly tinted glasses to accent your outfit, these glasses are perfect."
4.0,"Light, comfortable but a little too stiff..."
4.0,Cute little dress for the summer. It's not the best quality but it can be dressed up or down.
4.0,Super cute necklace that can be worn with a tee shirt or a little black dress
4.0,Love the color. Very comfortable. Zipper makes for easy on off. Would buy again
4.0,A nice change from the look of normal wayfarers.
4.0,Fits well as not as much stitching with pattern.
4.0,scratched really easily!! it is very comfortable and i love the design.
4.0,"Decent shower shoes, the fit was just right, and they seem durable enough, they dry pretty fast, but some water does get trapped in the crevices which takes a lot longer to dry up, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Overall pretty great shower shoes and would definitely recommend if you don't want anything too flashy, and don't mind things getting a tad bit wet"
4.0,Very pretty. Well worth the money
4.0,It's actually way bigger than what you see here or probably I have small fingers. Regardless I found the size big but otherwise it's pretty 🦋
4.0,"-Comfortable<br />-Easy to take on and off<br />-Etchings are pretty deep, so no concern of wearing off with long term use<br />-Recommend purchasing smaller than your actual ring size,  Enso rings tend to stretch out/loosen with extended wear<br /><br />Overall a solid purchase for an HP fan, but overpriced for a casual fan."
4.0,"good quality and works great for the price compare to some other brands. I had it for over 6 months now, and the leather is still looking good , compare to some other belts I've bought."
4.0,"The bracelet is meant to be given as a gift. The box it comes in says “Best Wishes” and there is an inspirational message on a slip of paper inside. I probably wouldn’t give this as a gift, except maybe to a child.<br /><br />It is made from what appears to be a piece of wire rope that has its ends capped off. It feels very light and cheaply made. However, it doesn’t look bad at all. The opening is small enough to keep it secure. The bracelet is flexible and easy to put on. It also comes with a microfiber cloth to keep it polished.<br /><br />As I said, it could make a nice gift for a child, but it is also not a bad accessory for a teen or adult. This bracelet looks okay on its own, but would do well in a stack of other jewelry on your wrist.<br /><br />YES—I recommend this product. The quality matches the price. The product photos show exactly what you’re ordering."
4.0,NICE BUT IS A LITTLE SMALL.
4.0,"Valentines day gift. She loved it, and I didn't have to break the bank."
4.0,"I received this seat bag as a gift. I'm able to fit the following items inside the bag: 700x28 tube, two 25 gram threaded CO2s, one inflator, two tire levers and a car key fob. Seems well constructed but only time will tell how durable it is."
4.0,"The skirt is a touch tight, its also longer then I anticipated. However its very pretty."
4.0,Very nice material love the length. Also loved the flowing sleeves. Ordered XL I am 5’7 around 170lbs. The only thing that I did not favor was the stitching around the bust area. I felt that it should’ve been under the bust and the way It layed on my body it was on the bust- see final picture.
4.0,"I really like this dress. The material is a little slick and doesn’t breathe as much as I’d like, but it’s overall very comfy and I’ve gotten a bunch of compliments."
4.0,This top is super cute! It come quite a bit bigger than expected. I got a size medium but I could have gotten a small. I’m 4’11 135 lbs and busty. It’s pretty baggy on me but I think I can shrink it. Definitely go a size down from your normal.
4.0,This shirt is very nice and great for any occasion.<br /><br />The shirt itself is is made of great material; not too heavy and not to light. I believe that this shirt is not really meant to be tucked in. It honestly looks better without being tucked in. The shirt fits a little bit more tighter than expected. If you are going to order this shirt I definitely recommend getting the next size up fi you want a good fit that is not too tight and not too loose.<br /><br />I also would say this is a shirt you would wear with a suit. It is very fashionable but in my opinion not a suit shirt. Great for work in the yard or elsewhere but definitely not for a suit.<br /><br />Great product overall just fits a bit tighter than expected. I will be looking into other shirt like this I just have to remember to get the next size up.
4.0,Cute and a nice fit!
4.0,"Bought the for the boyfriend and he really likes them.  They have a funny plastic smell when you first get them, but that wears off after while.  He says they are slip proof and fit well on his size 10 feet."
4.0,"Such a fun PJ set! I love leopard, so the nights I wear this, I love throwing on my leopard slippers too so I’m leopard from head to toe. The bottoms are about half a size too big for me, but I love the big comfy feel."
4.0,Cool idea!
4.0,Pretty but somewhat large.
4.0,"I got the blue, black and grey pack. They all seem to fit about the same. I’m currently losing weight, and am at about 134 (semi-athletic build). Got a small. Pretty form-fitting (a touch loose on me, not super super tight). Nice long sleeves. The one thing I don’t love about these tops are the seams. This blue one in particular, looks a little more bold than I like, and the sewn seams are really thick, and kind of look like interweaving railroad tracks lol… and kind of resembles a super conservative long sleeve swim top. And the shoulder seams are a bit broad for me (I don’t have dainty/narrow shoulders either… yet the seams are about a cm or two too wide for my taste). I’ll keep them because I like them more than I don’t, but that was my initial hesitation. It’s on the thinner side, stretchy dry-wick type material. If it’s cold outside, definitely need another layer."
4.0,"I really love this dress. I sized up but should’ve sized down. I am a size 10/12 and did an XL based off of reviews. Going to try a large. That being said I am only a B cup, if I had a larger chest the XL may have been ok."
4.0,Love the look if these pants but they run smaller than expected
4.0,I was expecting it to be bead sized....the lava beads that come with it are bigger than a mini marshmallow. I most likely either read the dimensions wrong or just assumed it would be smaller bead sized. It a good quality it was just two big for what i needed it for.
4.0,like it but would like a place for the register.
4.0,They are engraved...barely. I thought the engraving would be the muted color thats shown and the engraving is bright white. Not what I wanted but I guess they're alright.
4.0,"Great value getting solid-looking tie clips at this price. The blue and black ones look very good. The silver one is a bit misleading since it isn't &#34;normal&#34; silver - it has a &#34;scratched&#34; look to it, which you can probably see if you zoom in on the Amazon-listing picture. The scratches make the silver one look a little cheaper so I'm not sure why they just didn't stick to a normal glossy silver version. Good items overall though."
4.0,Wearing it to MegaCon!!
4.0,Very classic shape that fit a large face. Second pair I've bought over the years. The glasses I received were a dark brown tortoise shell with dark brown lenses. Not the color advertised or wanted but will keep because they are great glasses.
4.0,gift for my partner who loves spider man :) they have it on their car keys and love it!
4.0,"These are great glasses! I ordered the black and red and they sent me the all black ones, but it’s a minor detail and I still like them. They seem to be pretty sturdy and well made. I like that they came with a bag to keep them in, which will help prevent scratches when I store them in my purse!"
4.0,"Sort of sheer but not completely see through, cute and adjustable length"
4.0,"Very nice quality dress. I ordered the hazel blue and it is a super color! For reference, I’m 5’2”, 122-123lbs., 36B, 29” waist and 39” hips and ordered a small. I’m petite. I wear a US small (4-6) and that is what I ordered. It was extremely small on me — had inches open to squeeze to button it!!! I looked to see if there was a tag to see the material content to check for spandex and there wasn’t a tag?? This dress has no stretch to it. When laying flat here are the following measurements:<br />Armpit to Armpit – 16” (32”)<br />Waist – 14” (28”)<br />Hips – 15 1/2” (31”)<br />Length – 32” on the side; 30” in the center.<br />Remember you have to times by 2 to allow for both front and the back.<br />I will be re-ordering in a size large and will report back ladies.<br /><br />I re-ordered in a size Large and it was extremely large in the mid-section and returned it.<br /><br />I re-ordered it again in a Medium and it was still snug on me. I really wanted this dress to work on me and sadly I had to return it.<br /><br />I had to return all 3 of them. In my opinion, this dress would have worked if it  had spandex in it for movement and allow to stretch to fit properly for a women’s hour glass figure shaped body. I think they designed this for how they think that most American’s have “big bellies” and I’m not shaped like that. This dress was shaped like a maternity dress when I tried it on.<br /><br />It was very pretty, but designed oddly."
4.0,It runs smaller than what the description says. I’m a size 5 women and I could barely fit my shoes into the boot covers. Otherwise...great buy!  I’d buy another pair but maybe bigger size.
4.0,"The positives is that it is very small, perfect for traveling, and fits 1 card on every page. Only 1 negative and it is the fact that if you turn the binder slightly to the side, some cards may fall out. Otherwise, great binder."
4.0,For what it's worth the watch was surprisingly clear. I love the alarm. thanks
4.0,"I really love the color of these leggings with the maroon red.  These are very stretchy which I like.  They seem to run true to size as I wear a 2x in all of my leggings and these fit great.  I had to play with them a little to get them on as they did bunch behind my knees, but with some adjusting they were fine.  They are high waisted and stay in place when I am working out."
4.0,"The mediums I ordered show size 34-36 on the packaging, had me a little worried because I'm a 32. They fit fine, so that is no problem. I really like these a lot so far. My only issue is that I ordered 2 packs of them so that I could get a variation of all the colors (or most of them), but when I received the packages they were identical colors. I know it says I'd get a pair of black ones in each pack, but all the other colors I received were exactly the same in each pack. BTW, the orange in the picture is much lighter than it actually is, these orange pairs are fully orange, no hint of yellow whatsoever. I would order another pack of these if I knew I could get the purple and the red, but I don't want to risk getting the same exact colors again."
4.0,"I appear to be the only one aware of them. Somehow, this just doesn't fit the same as every product photo I've seen. The arms feel skinny and the pockets are a little odd. I can't put my finger on why. I will say that I've gotten positive comments for it and it is perfect for fall weather. In the future, I'd probably go up a size or two and a lighter color, so it feels more like a poncho than a snug sweat shirt that reaches my knees, and so the contours that make it obvious as a coat and not a weird shirt can be seen."
4.0,This meat cleaver is actually what we needed for my husbands Halloween costume. It looks so real!
4.0,Arrived on time. The earrings are very nice for the money. They have a little weight to them not cheap feeling like I was expecting. Would recommend.
4.0,"Good product, it’s also sturdy"
4.0,A good quality bag. I find the side pockets a bit small but otherwise I am pleased with it
4.0,Shrank more than I anticipated they would and now are very small.
4.0,The hats are made of slightly cheap material and the lights are SO intense that you can't really keep them on while wearing them. Otherwise great for the price and perfect for holiday parties.
4.0,"I bought this for a friend of mine and it is very nice, however, it's a bit chunkier in the photos and a little on the slim size in person, however, she loves it! ;)"
4.0,The fabric is soft and flowy but it's very thin.  Kinda see through so it is only good as a swim cover up.
4.0,"Love the pattern and fit of this dress! Great lightweight dress for summer but can be worn into the colder seasons. The removable tie waist is a nice addition and makes this dress versatile in terms of styling. Great dress for work, too! I just wish the material was softer - feels a little scratchy, kind of like rough linen."
4.0,"Buena calidad, pero le doy 4 estrellas porque deberian de dar opciones al comprar y los colores y tallas mas especificas."
4.0,"Fits comfortably. As described. I am a satisfied buyer.<br />I am 5'4, 185 lbs. These are extremely comfortable and are great for office attire. I bought these is various colors because they are worth the price.<br />Wish I’d opted for the XXL"
4.0,"Great dress, fits great, material nice. Belt loops on dress were sewed on kind of weird"
4.0,"Arrived a week early, picture is accurate,  fits well and can be adjusted. I am in love already! As it's cheap I don't see why it would matter if it doesn't last forever. I'd buy it again."
4.0,Good for winter snow days.
4.0,"Long enough to cover butt, no built in bra, not see through. Not the highest quality but great deal and totally works under other tops / over leggings. The bottom hem flares out a bit. Could be the sizing. I usually get size L or XL so I ordered an XL because it said juniors sizing. Probably could have gotten the L for a more fitted look, but the XL isn't loose either. For reference 5'6&#34; 160lbs"
4.0,I love it very good quality  just make sure to get one size bugger than your size
4.0,Runs a little  small. Looks great on
4.0,After surgery I needed a sports bra with support. This fit the bill!
4.0,Dress is definitely pretty but xs is actually more like small size :( had to return it
4.0,Order down two sizes if you want them tight I got one size down and they are still big they fit and are comfortable but definitely not tummy control
4.0,"Good purse, sturdy.  A little over-priced for what you get but overall no complaints."
4.0,The product is what I expected to be apart from the hoody part where it doesn’t really have its resistance so whenever you bend down the hoody will be either side of the shoulders not being able to flip back unless you manage it with your hands.
4.0,Me encanto el producto quedo como se esperaba
4.0,Cute! Think material but that's what I was looking for as a spring time sweatshirt.
4.0,I loved this product it’s just very light weight but I love that about it
4.0,Came as described. Material is pretty thin. Will need tank top underneath. Otherwise love it. Will wear it to work with dress slacks. Can also wear it casually with shorts.
4.0,Not exactly “compression” shirts. More like snug tank tops.
4.0,"It's a big big; typically I wear a size large in shirts (32D cup) but when I received my shirt it's a little big. I'm still going to use it, I decided to just pin the extra material. Altogether it is still a very cute shirt :)"
4.0,I needed a shirt at the last minute for a golf tournament. It was perfect. I loved the color and light weight material. Perfect for weather in Arizona.
4.0,"I wear a size large and this ran a little small for me. My legs and hips fit in fine but my inner thigh were literally suffocating.For these type of pants it needs to be a little loose but fitted for it to look nice, it was too tight for me to move around and is not comfortable. The quality however feels nice just the size ran too small and is not stretchy"
4.0,I hate spending tons of money on shoes every few months... these won’t last long but at this age they don’t really need to last too long. For me these are a great extra set for leaving in his school bag or with grandma.
4.0,love very comfortable and has pockets.
4.0,Havnt worn it yet but it is made of great material. I propose that I will be getting tons of wear  for many years out of this coat.
4.0,"I ordered these along with pineapple pasties and the pineapple pasties I recieved were great! However, I tried to contact amazon about this order.. I recieved an empty packet with the right side cut open. Essentially I recieved an empty packet, bubble wrap, and a very large cardboard box to recycle. No pizza pasties!  I just wanna hubba hubba with some pizza pizza.. but now I can't."
4.0,"The stones are a little big and go around the side a tad more than is comfortable, but a good ring nonetheless."
4.0,Very happy with this. Based on previous reviews I did order 1size up and it fits great.
4.0,"Love these earrings. Be gentle with them posts will bend a bit if ur not careful with them, but they do bend back into place.  I got tons of compliments on them"
4.0,"Bought this thinking it was a tunic dress but when I tried it on, the sides are a bit shorter, so they are best to wear with leggings. They look good with a pair of leggings under it even a pair of crop leggings. It is comfortable and flowy and a little loose. Might get another one in a different color."
4.0,For my emergency  sunglasses!
4.0,This dress is  very flattering and comfortable and fits perfectly.
4.0,to small but it still fit
4.0,They really help with my driving at night and all the super bright head lights.
4.0,Top Was A Bit Small & Nonsupportive So I Had To Fix It Up Some But The Bottoms Fit Excellent
4.0,Soft but way too big.
4.0,"My son loves his sandals. However, It would have been nice if the sizes were in numbers and not letters. I ordered a medium hoping it would have some extra room for growth. However, it's an exact fit, so I know it won't last long."
4.0,"Got the 1ct stones. They look true to size, don't know what people are talking about when they say they are small. Look high quality , only you will know they were cheap. Only reason they only get 4 stars is because the backs aren't screw ons.i will probably lose them one day because of it. 1ct is perfect for a guy, not gaudy but still noticeable."
4.0,"I bought these to try a nose ring before doing the real thing. they're a larger circumference and bigger gauge than i would do if i were to go under the needle for real because they are meant to be used as false rings for a number of areas including the septum, but it looks just like the picture so i knew it was going to be that way when i ordered them. what i like is the spring loaded closure. i'm not concerned that the ring will fall out over the course of the day.  two notes on common complaints i read about these rings in other reviews:<br /><br />hurt to take out: they actually dont. if you pull straight down, yeah it hurts. but if you push the side inside your nose and pull the outside, almost like you're removing a fishing hook or sewing with a needle, the spring will be pushed further down and you can remove the ring without pain.<br /><br />hurts to leave on: it may just be me, but i don't find it hurts to leave it in all day. if you don't stop playing with it and moving it, then yes it will hurt. leave it alone and you'll be fine."
4.0,"Dress is incredibly cute. A little big but my daughter is on the low end of the 6-9 month age/size range. Would get 5 stars, but the ribbon was unraveling after the first wash."
4.0,"This cover-up is so cute! Very nice and flowy ~~ airy fabric.<br />Would be perfect for a light sun cover up for a hot day at the beach or the lake.<br />Looks super sweet with a cute tank top, a pair of jeans, and sandals to dress it up!<br />The colors are beautiful and the fit is nice and relaxed.<br />The material is a 100% polyester (chiffon) ~~<br />Easy to launder, but I plan to wash mine inside a zippered mesh laundry bag and hang dry."
4.0,"I recently purchased this hat for a trip to the mountains. I received it in a timely manner and the hat was as I expected. After trying it on, I realize this hat is really for a younger age group. I'm 58. It is of nice quality and is truly adorable (and reversable) but I probably won't wear it. My fault. Definitely worth purchasing though."
4.0,When the product came it did not include everything in the description it just came in a box and inside a soft cloth bag that can be use to wipe and clean the lenses. But otherwise the glasses are indeed lightweight and polarized. Lets see hoiw long it last.
4.0,The person I bought it for loved it. Was a great fit and good quality!!!
4.0,"I like everything about this dress, except the small armholes. I could feel the armholes were tight, but when taking the dress off at the end of the day, my mar pits felt scratchy and a little raw. But it does look cute on."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, but it does not glow in the dark"
4.0,"It’s not too heavy, soft but I wear a medium and ordered a small and it’s still a bit large. If you like a loose fit I would still order down a size.<br />Very cute though."
4.0,"So far it’s a great comfy dress. Just drapey enough, but not too loose. A tad too long for me. I’m 5’4 160 and got a medium."
4.0,Runs small and one sleeve is bigger than the other
4.0,Backs are smaller than expected but the ear post nuts are great
4.0,Ok ring
4.0,"Nice, good price."
4.0,"This dress is fun and comfortable, breezy and not see through.  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is that the green is a bit misleading. The dress I have on-hand is more of an olive, army kind of green not like the picture."
4.0,Packaged nicely. Leather quality seems good.<br />Has rather strong smell that I am hoping will go away.  The fit is good.
4.0,They're great I found them for less and purchase them from the store but my son is 5 and the are his new favorite glasses so I bought them as backups since he already scratched his other ones
4.0,Very happy with the delivery time and the quality
4.0,"Very cute.  Soft material.  A little thick, I would not wear this on a hot day.  More like a fall t-shirt.  Graffic is adorable."
4.0,Fits well  Which I was not expecting after the reviews I read. All the other reviews said it was too short but it does pass my butt  (But I'm only 4'11&#34;)
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; so the top part of this dress doesn't come down quite as far as I would like but boy does this dress accentuate curves in all the right ways! I got ALOT of compliments today,  well worth the cost."
4.0,I ordered a larger size as a plus sized lady you never know if it is going to fit or not.  Well this one did and it is a little big but that is ok with me as I like a little room in my clothes.  You will need to wash this shirt on delicate and may have to press the lace sleeves a bit.
4.0,"I really like this blouse.  It fits as expected, fabric details are good, just wear a cami as it is completely see through."
4.0,Hoodie fits him well. He likes how soft the inside is.
4.0,Fits true to size. Looks nice and we were surprised to find it has pockets! She's only worn it once so we'll see how well it holds up. We are both pleased so far.
4.0,"I know you want a Schitt's Creek tshirt, and I totally get that, so here it is.<br /><br />Love the show, love the shirt<br /><br />The shirt fits well, and is soft."
4.0,It was small but a beautiful shirt
4.0,"I've worn these pants twice now and am very pleased.  The first was a winter hike and the pants were warm and comfortable.  The second was a day of cross country skiing and the main reason why I was looking for pants like this.  I had full range of motion and stayed dry and warm without overheating.  My 2 minor gripes about the pants: 1 - they are a touch on the short side for me.  I'm 6'1&#34;, 160 lb and normally wear a 32/34 in pants.  The medium fit great except that they are a touch short.  2 - the liner in the pockets is very thin.  Some object in the pocket (digital camera, cell phone screen) will feel very cold against the skin.  Otherwise, great pants and value!"
4.0,"They're pretty awesome.  Light, comfy, and fits as expected.  They could be an inch longer so they don't pull up when I move my legs certain ways.  I got them for lounging around the house and eventually wearing on airplanes.  The fabric is very thin--as expected.  What I didn't expect was for them to be a bit see-through.  I ordered the black with paisley and would probably need to wear a layer under these to go out in public."
4.0,"Not great quality, but the price was right for a one-time novelty use."
4.0,Super cool design. Only complaint is the material could be better quality for the price
4.0,"There is so much to love about this outfit. The legging/pants are the best quality I've ever seen, stretch but with a drawstring. The top is very lightweight and will be great in the heat. I like the longer back, the colors are nice. The hook and eye closures are difficult and the thread &#34;eyes&#34; may become a problem. The lace came with a 2&#34; rip which I hand repaired and there was a 4&#34; section that wasn't attached, to the dress at all, again I repaired. This is why I took off a star. You should not have to repair new garments. I color set it in vinegar and salt before washing. While I like it a lot, it is not worth the price."
4.0,"I love this, but it is small fit, and not very stretchy so it’s difficult to pull over my hips, but once it’s on it’s beautiful."
4.0,"One came with a hole in the foot, and they are shorter than expected (I'm 5'7&#34; but fit an XS, these come JUST above my knees, and move down). For the price- I can't complain too much"
4.0,"These are okay, just wish they were actually tapered at the waist like the photos suggest. They are more of a tight fit in the chest, shoulders and arms but not so much around the waist."
4.0,Fits great! Love the fact that it's bright white.
4.0,It's cute an spandex so it fit good.
4.0,"Good, basic headbands.  Definitely worth a wash first before you use them, since there are a lot of little &#34;fuzzies&#34; that come off if you wear them right away.  Nice an comfortable, and very absorbent.  I don't expect them to last forever, they're definitely not super high quality, but for the price I think it's totally worth it."
4.0,"This is very good for winter, windy days. The fleece is soft and thick. It did have a plastic smell to it when I got it, but washing it got that out. I air dried, and it retained its shape, no issues there. I do wish the hood was just a bit looser, as it fits quite tight to the head. Of course, I do have a lot of hair, so that can be a factor. But, I think that's something the designers should have thought about - women wear this, and some of us have lots of hair. Otherwise, it's quite lovely."
4.0,Very cute scrub cap! Not itchy and easily washes. Small padding on the forehead helps keep it more comfortable and prevents sweat from sitting on your forehead during long cases.
4.0,I love the look n feel but after a few months they stretch out. I hv had to un stitch them and pull more thru n redo. And I need to do it again bc I hv it as tight as it will go and it's getting loose again
4.0,Bought a small  for my 16 year old who weighs about 96 lbs with a 32 chest sizes and it fit big.  It's a nice dress well made.  If they had an extra small we would have kept it.
4.0,"My third sunglasses I got this summer. It came in a simple plastic zip bag. There are a fabric sack for storage as well as sunglasses wipe that came with it. The sunglasses itself is in standard black which goes with pretty every outfit. The quality is okay. Not like designer quality but not night market quality either. The overall construction of the sunglasses is sturdy. The lenses are oversized, which is the main reason why I like it. I'm quite satisfied with it and will definitely recommend it.<br />I purchased this product at a discounted price, the opinion is entirely mine. As an Amazon customer, I rely on customer reviews to make my purchasing decision. So I hope this review will help you to do the same."
4.0,These masks are not cotton but they are a very soft material. They are silky. They fit my small face well. The ear pieces are adjustable but they are pretty short so most people wont need to use that feature. My college aged son wore one and it fit his face well but the adjustable band sat right on his ear and he said it was a bit uncomfortable. Ill def wear them though because its usually hard for me to find masks small enough for me.
4.0,It’s perfect but it’s entirely too tight around my neck. So I gave it 4 stars Bc of the fit.
4.0,The fit was great very comfortable.
4.0,"The scarf is great! the only complaint is the weird smell. I too am hoping it wears away, the only downside of the purchase."
4.0,"This is a 100% cotton play dress, made in India. It is beautifully designed with a high neck and flaring skirt. I ordered a size 4 for my child who is 3 years old, 38 lbs. She is petite and even with some shrinkage, it’s still a bit big on her; particularly the arm holes as they gap open when she stands, and when she sits, the shoulders raise up. After washing as instructed, it’s completely wrinkled, and not very soft or stretchy, but I expected that from 100% cotton. I’m not the type of mom who irons, lol, so this will be a play dress, just as intended. My daughter liked the flaring skirt, as she started twirling when I put it on her. She has many allergies, and sensory processing disorder, so I am glad this fabric is pure cotton. She seems to love it! And I think this high quality dress will last a long time!"
4.0,"A bit too disstressed for my taste, but the fit was good"
4.0,I think  my granddaughter  is going to love it  cant wait to give it to her for Christmas
4.0,"Really pretty, but top heavy. Makes it hard to look through purse and handle it. When you sit it down the heaviness of the purse gives it a smashed look."
4.0,Fabric is smooth and silky but I am having to hem it as usage will begin raveling. Heming this fabric is difficult as most scarves are.
4.0,"The dress is gorgeous and the material is nice. The pattern and style are exactly what I was looking for and you can't beat the price. However, the size I ordered was too small for me around the breast area and sadly this company doesn't offer dresses of this style in any larger size. Which is a major bummer because I think this would have been a very flattering dress for girls with a larger bust to wear. The top doesn't reveal cleavage, which makes it perfect for a number of events and purposes. Though it was too small, it was fitted nicely down to my natural waist where it flared out. The skirt wasn't very full so if you want a bigger skirt then you need to wear something under it. My only real complaint about the dress itself is that the buttons didn't seem to be attached really well and if I kept the dress I would want to sew them on a little better."
4.0,"Love, but there is no tummy control and I wish they had pockets."
4.0,Seems to be working well.  Finish is acceptable.
4.0,I got a large and i normally fit in a medium. I needed an XL it make it fit right.
4.0,Length is not as it says. I’m 5’8 and it’s above my ankles  would fit a 5’5 person better
4.0,"This is a lovely shoe, lovely color....fits a tiny bit snug n you might want to add more support if needed."
4.0,"I love the green color, super lightweight. A little confusing to set up but I read the instructions. The backlight is trash though. Doesn’t light up the whole face. But overall but pretty good"
4.0,"I love the high waist. However, when squatting they are see-through."
4.0,I love this swimsuit. I initially ordered a medium and the bottoms were so tiny. So I tried a large and it fits much better! The top is adjustable so it fit fine also. I'm only giving it 4 stars since I had to get a large. Normally I fit in medium bottoms. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 135 32D I Wear size 27 in jeans and pants
4.0,Slightly smaller than anticipated but still wearable.
4.0,Purchased as a gift for someone. Their dream watch<br />Beautiful<br />Durable<br />Recommend.
4.0,"Pretty happy with my new onesie! It's not a thick fleece. I'm wearing it now, and it's perfect as I get ready to start my work at home Friday and am delaying turning the heater on in my 62-degree house. The fit is a bit interesting. At 5'2&#34;, 148 lbs, small turned out to be the right size. What's weird is that the legs are too long, but the arms are perfect. My limbs are proportionate. If anything, my arms are a bit short for my height and my legs a bit long. The feet are ginormous. I can almost gather the excess fabric and tie a knot. Love that it has pockets. This is a good onesie for wintertime in a mild climate with a bit of chill. Great for around the house, but too much for sleeping."
4.0,It does run a bit small
4.0,Its a bit too soft and falls down so needs adjustment but they look really nice
4.0,Fit comfortably and and looked great on
4.0,Really fitted. I wear 10/12 women’s and the Large fits all around and I’m not even curvy. The band sticks well so I’d suggest to size up if you want to move freely. Nike tends to run small IMO.
4.0,got it on time and its just like the picture. not as thin as I had thought it would be and the sleeves are a little too short but that's a common problem for me since im oober tall. but over all a really cute shirt. cant wait to wear it :)
4.0,"very cute, thinner than expected but still cute"
4.0,"Nice color, too big"
4.0,very comfortable cloth
4.0,So comfy but way larger than I expected. Unfortunately I can't wear them & I'm too lazy to send them back. But I'll find them a good home.
4.0,"I haven’t worn this yet, but I did try it on. I got a medium which is my usual size, and it fits as expected. It’s not too tight. In fact, it’s a little bit roomier than I expected, but I’d rather have that than something too tight. The material felt good, not itchy at all. Looking forward to wearing this."
4.0,Cute but sizing was not accurate.  Ran really small
4.0,Clasp didn't fit the necklace
4.0,The fabric is like a soft tubular material but I Did not like it for this color. it made the dress look shiny and so was unflattering in curvy areas...
4.0,"I wanted to love these. They are definitely super soft and comfy. Cute color and look. Love the pockets in the pants too. But I have two issues:<br />1. The pants are too long. I’m 5’6” and I ordered a medium and they are too long. Lots of extra length.<br />2. And also the waistband is ridiculously tight. Even if you wear it high waisted it’s just too tight. I liked the look and feel of the PJs so I opened the seam in the back and clipped the elastic in the waist then re-sewed it in, giving me more of a larger waistband. A lot of work but now they’re tolerable."
4.0,"A fair item at a fair price -- no complaints.  When you just have to have a green costume cape, this would be a solid choice."
4.0,Really liked this but would recommend coating it in clear nail polish as the finish will rub off & the copper underneath turn green with regular wear. But good for the price. I did however change the cord as I found the one it came with to be too stiff.
4.0,Fitting is really good. I would definitely recommend to buy this jumpsuit❤️
4.0,Too big but good customer service
4.0,"These socks are advertised as ""thick snow skiing socks."" While they are a decent pair of knee high ski socks, they aren't thick or very warm (unless you are doing outdoor sports in them) The description is a bit misleading. They do provide good compression all over the calf but there's isn't compression in the arch for support like some higher end ski socks have. They're are breathable which does make them ideal to ski with. However I had to take off stars because the description is very misleading with saying they are ""thick"" and ""warm."" Someone looking just for warm winter socks is going to be disappointed. However for winter sports like skiing these are good. They are your typical ski socks. They're made of merino wool which is what nearly all the best ski socks are made of because they keep your feet warm when your body generates heat but also allow moisture to wick out. Remember when your skiing you have insulated boots and pants on so the socks don't need to be really thick and heavy. If your looking for ski socks that don't cost a fortune these are a good option. If you want just warm winter socks to hang around in these are not them."
4.0,"This is a super cute dress! The size fits me well although I'm just 5.7 the waist seems a pinch high but I tend to be long waisted with some items so that may be the reason.  I love the stretchy, textured fabric and it looks like it would hold up well.  The tear drop cutouts on the front are not too revealing and I appreciate the well thought design because it is repeated on the pockets (as a top stitch detail not cut out).  Yes, the belt is ridiculously long.  One reviewer said it could easily be cut but to me seems impossible without ruining the finished edge.  I can almost wrap it around twice and fasten as another reviewer mentioned but not quite.  Although would be a more finished look, there are no loops or any indication that it comes with a belt so I may go without it or try one of my own. I purchased it to celebrate International Dot Day at my school from Peter H Reynolds book. We are all wearing dots or circles.  I think it will be a hit!  The dress arrived timely and was packaged well."
4.0,Simple watch for work and other activities where one would need to know the time every 5 minutes
4.0,"Needed new turf cleats for softball.<br />Comfortable fit, usually wear a 10.5 (US) but ordered 11. Fits perfect. The molded cleats provide great balance for standing in the batter’s box and grip the turf and grass outfield well. Holds up well in wet conditions. Not a heavy cleat but also not flimsy - was what I was looking for as far a weight and durability."
4.0,"I bought this watch and as cute as it is (because i do love it)i've only worn it about 8 times and the gold is starting to come off on the sides, so i don't think i can wear it much longer.. i guess i got what you paid for!"
4.0,had to return mine because they are SKINNY jeans ! I wished they would of fit
4.0,They are a little bigger then anticipated and a little on the heavier side.  I do love buffalo check so they are in the earring rotation.
4.0,"Good sunglasses, fit is a little snug, hopefully will loosen up over time.  Reduces glare, but<br />not that great a night driving.  Purchased for my husband, but didn't like them.  Said not comfortable to wear and didn't like the yellow lens.  I kept them for myself."
4.0,"I recived my watch today and fell in love right away. The band is strong and well made. The face is just the right size so it is easy to see the hands. I love that it is so stylish.  I recieved alot of complements on it at work today. I am a nurse by day and my fellow nurses like it so much they want to order one for themselves. In our occupation it is important to have the right watch. I also love that it comes in other colors. I will be ordering another one in a different color for when I go out. The band is just the right size so it does't spin on your wrist. Love, love, love the product.<br /><br />I purchased the product in exchange for my honest opinion. Really happy with my purchase."
4.0,my masks came pretty early. i thought they were going to be white but when i opened the package it was actually black. it’s okay tho. good and comfortable to wear!
4.0,Good quality soft fabric. Not see through at all. Very high waisted. I usually wear a medium and these mediums keep slipping down
4.0,Pretty cool bands.
4.0,"Works great. I love this design. Some of the sewing on some of the pockets have come undone, but I might have too many things in the wallet. Everything still stays in just right.<br />At first things stick to the glue of the wallet, but it seems to have loosened up and work smoothly."
4.0,"This top is so  cute I gave it  4 stars just for the cute styling. I haven't washed yet. I m 5'1 139 I wear a medium, I bought a medium fits perfect it's not tight. It does have a slight odor.  I'm buying another color for sure"
4.0,"I love the large size of this visor.  It has the widest brim I could possibly find, which is exactly what I wanted.  I also love that it's foldable for easy packing during travel.  The only change I would make, if I could, is to have some bones or stays (sort of like an old school corset) to stiffen the brim because it tends to blow up very easily in any kind of noticeable breeze.  Having a few firm ribs to reinforce the brim would still allow for it to be folded and prevent the brim from blowing up."
4.0,This is a very good laptop/briefcase type of bag.  I am an IT Specialist and can carry extra cords and some tools so I can leave main tools in car unless really needed.  I Only have one issue shown in a picture and the shoulder strap is missing a clip.  I will edit and give a 5 star when this is replaced.
4.0,"This is a nice leather wallet.  It is in no way a slim wallet or minimalist wallet.  Just an average run-of-the-mill genuine leather wallet.  The one feature it has that I don't normally see is that it has two ID windows.  This is great for my Driver's License and VA ID.<br /><br />In addition to the 2 ID's in my wallet, I also have 10 cards.  8 that fit comfortably in the slots, comfortably and not jammed in, and two more in the pocket behind the credit card slots.  Cash fits nicely in the billfold area, not too shallow and not too deep.<br /><br />This wallet won't make anyone envious, but if you are looking for a good sturdy wallet, this a great go to."
4.0,I like the purse the material quality could have been better.
4.0,Well made. Quality. Nice case. A little big though.
4.0,"Love this dress! Super versatile and great with blazers and cardigans for work. Green color is beautiful. I carry all my weight in the tummy so hard to find things that don't make me look pregnant, but the waist hours at just the right spot. Only wish is that the fabric would be more structured, as it's a bit flimsy and wrinkles easily."
4.0,I gave it away. Didn't fit
4.0,The pants fitted perfectly.
4.0,I think it is a good size and super cute.
4.0,"Good little duffle fits in my smart any direction, prefer the other style I bought as it's side pockets expand for more room. Great for a weekend bag"
4.0,"Runs in small sizes, I ordered a Medium and it fits like a Small. But it is comfortable not too tigh."
4.0,"I received this dress today. Great quality as usual from Fair Indigo except, it smelled like perfume. I'm not even sure that I can wash it out. This is the first time that this has happened. Not sure why it smells so strong of perfume. Still love the company but a little disappointed. I did get a great price on this dress though."
4.0,"This sweater is nicely made and drapes well. The knit is nice and soft. The medium is a large medium, so be aware of that if ordering. Overall a very nice sweater."
4.0,Good product. Good quality at a good price.
4.0,Large but as expected.  Very comfortable!
4.0,"I love these so much I bought them in almost every color. I will say that the green pair does not look like the normal pretty green.. it almost looks like a yucky yellow/green so I will send those back. Otherwise I am in love. I do normally wear a medium and had to size up because mediums were tight and short on me (5’8, 140 lbs)."
4.0,Loses shape after washing.
4.0,Hermosa me encantó quiero comprar otra pero una talla más grande
4.0,Leather could be a polished more but it does have a lot of room for cards and fits nice but at first seems and looks cheap but a good leather polish will make it look nice and simple the Sims card holder isn't as handy
4.0,Great sandal!!  Very comfy and pillow like walking!!  A bit on the small size but not bad at all.
4.0,Does not become brittle such as the original plastic band. However it's on the small side for my wrist.
4.0,"Chose a size XL, wear a 38B, or XL shirt and it fit snug, but comfortable.  It is very well made &#34;except&#34; for the straps.  They are too thin and after a month of use, they seem to cut into my shoulders.  It washed up nice, with no change is size or did the nice lace loose it's nice look. If not for the straps being so thin this would be a really nice, functional, bra."
4.0,the shorts are a bit see through
4.0,I have been using these as my cycling glasses and they have been great so far - all the compliments are a definite plus. The sticker placement did leave a mark despite trying to be quite careful which made them feel less new from the first time I wore them - but great value and style.
4.0,"They are very comfortable, but would recommend getting the next size up from what you usually get. I read the review before i bought them and found out they run a little small. So instead of buying a medium i bought a large, and that worked perfect for me. They are smooth and I prefer these over cotton any day."
4.0,"I do like the duty pink color I chose, and the material is quite soft and pleasant in texture. The only slight complaint is that the waist is stiff, for lack of a better word. It fits me well, but the waist cinches tightly against my skin. It's not that the waist is wrong in size--I just think perhaps it could have had more elasticity. But it's a good knock-around and do errands type of lounge pants, and it washes and wears well. I do appreciate loungewear that doesn't require special washing instructions. This looks built to last, and they are not unflattering, although they don't flatter, either. I guess I would call them a neutral fit, aesthetically speaking. I doubt I'd get another pair, but these are definitely decent."
4.0,Larga
4.0,This dress is really lovely. True to size and is worth the price. I bought a large but was a little too big for me.
4.0,So cute!!! Great quality! My 4yr old loves it for gymnastics
4.0,"I love the pattern of these socks but I wear a size 14 and size XL is just a little too tight on my feet. I bought two pairs in this colorway and they both fit the same.  14 is not much bigger than 12 so if you have a large foot of any kind, word of warning. The strange thing is that I have a third pair of these socks in the Blue striped colorway with green lightening bolt and those fit perfectly. They feel more stretchy than this B&W with pink. Maybe the colors have something to do with it. Either way, love the pattern  and the fun stuff SockGuy is doing."
4.0,A little happy g but unlike it.
4.0,Correct gage
4.0,"I love this jacket but I wore in it sort-of heavy rain and the rain soaked right through the jacket. Other than that, it's a light jacket that is good if you have an umbrella and is super cute as well."
4.0,"They are exactly like the picture, they are a Christmas present for my granddaughter the and I know she will love them."
4.0,I’m not a huge fan of the fabric but the fit is very good and the dress is pretty.
4.0,a little too long but fit comfortable with a good level of compression
4.0,"Cute sweater. Ordered size 6, she takes size 4 almost too small.  Ordered size 4 for girl who takes size 3 it's plenty roomy. I didn't mix the sizes because they went to 2 different cities. Need more consistency with US sizes."
4.0,I am fluffy around the tummy so it is a little snug but looks great.
4.0,"I am 5'5, 225 lbs, 38b with belly and large backside. I normally wear a 16 or xl in shirts. I got this in a 2xl according to the reviews but I did it on purpose. I am wearing this to a wedding next weekend and wanted the dress to be on the looser side. The 2xl was exactly what I wanted even though I could have easily fit the XL. There is a hidden zipper in the back but I did not even bother with it. I slipped the dress over my head and was already happy. There is a very thin lining underneath and I could see my tan colored bra. I will need to buy a black tube dress or something to wear under for more coverage. Good thing I sized up then. Other than that, I love the dress, the little bit of stretch does help and for length it is right below my knee which is fine since I have darker knees anyway. All I have to do is slap on my heels and some jewelry and done. I am looking forward to wearing this dress for my niece's wedding now."
4.0,The large Runs a little large even for 36DD
4.0,Good gloves for the price. Quality at the thumb area a little off.
4.0,Boots were really nice however seemed to be larger than size we ordered
4.0,"I like these pants a lot but after i wear them for about 30 minutes, they become too baggy."
4.0,"Got these for my boyfriend and he loves them, however we returned them the first time because it is advertised as the bone/tan color and we received black. The second time we ordered them they were still black so we just kept them. He was really looking forward to the bone color."
4.0,"First clip shoes I've purchased.  Overall, they are very comfortable.  The only issues I have are when walking, the metal clips on the bottom sometimes will grind the ground (cement, asphalt, etc.) and I'm afraid they'll wear down the operation of the clip eventually.  The other issue (and it's MINOR) is the look.  I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but they look kinda dorky, however, I've heard this is a trend across most bike shoes.  The velcro holds great and they ARE comfortable when riding (so much so that I don't really even notice I'm wearing them).  When walking, they are stiff (not TOO stiff) which is good for pedaling but kinda weird for walking.  Anyway, for a first-time purchase of clip shoes, I'm happy!"
4.0,The function is great.  My issue is that my hands are small and sometimes have difficulty holding items due to the size of the glove.
4.0,"These are lovely clip earrings, even comfortable, I returned them though,  because I’m still looking for larger (2 1/2 cm at the back) dome earrings. Anyone looking for very small earrings  would love these ones"
4.0,"Love this.<br /><br />Such an easy dress to throw on, for any occasion."
4.0,Only a little too big but its because im 4'10 :). but im 135lbs so i needed the extra room for my big bootie lol
4.0,"Very nice straps, look great fit well."
4.0,I love the skirt! It looks just like the picture. Only downside was the length. I’m 5’3” and had to take 10 inches off to get the length in the picture.
4.0,One of the pieces fell off but they work good. I like them alot
4.0,"Great sweater vest. Nice weight and feel to the material. Didn't work for us because the hubs is tall/long waisted. That's reason only 4 stars..  otherwise, a really nice piece of versatile clothing."
4.0,"Great for a party or two, not really going to hold up to months or years of abuse. Not a bad deal."
4.0,"I am 5'7 so i sized up from my normal size to make sure the length was a little longer. It is a little see through but should be fine with nude color underneath. Overall, super happy with it! can't wait to wear it in italy and the summer time!!"
4.0,This is a very nice bracelet! I love how it comes packaged in a drawstring bag. The look and feel is nice! The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is sometimes when you first clasp it the one side comes undone and you have to clasp it again. I AM concerned this will wear out in the future but for now it remains closed after the second time.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"Great Product! Got this for my nieces for Christmas, just took almost a month to ship to me!"
4.0,"Purchased for gift, recipient very pleased."
4.0,"I mean, its a short crop top that is meant to show a gratuitous amount of glorious, heavenly underboob flesh.  Its amazing, its a heavenly sight to behold.  I could have done without the ""No Bra Club"" on the shirt, and instead just blank, but the wife looks awesome in it and, you know, underboob.  How can it be bad?"
4.0,Good quality tough material should last.
4.0,"Overall pretty solid purchase. Bought them as a gift for my sister's bachelorette party. Everyone said they loved them; they've held up for the last few months with limited to no issues.<br /><br />Great buy if you're looking for a quick set of stylish glasses that aren't cheap and flimsy like the giveaways you get at street festivals. These are a bit thicker and more heavy duty, so definitely recommended."
4.0,Really like this dress. The color bright blue is so pretty. I ordered both L and XL and they were too small. I wear a 16W in most jeans and slacks and Large in tops. Reordered next 2 larger sizes and hoping one of them will fit. Want to wear to a September wedding and Christmas party. Returning was easy and my refund was fast and in full no return charges added.
4.0,"I walk to work everyday & have tried dozens of gloves that claim to be warm enough for the bitter winter cold & wind. They're either functional but let fingers freeze or they're too bulky to even use your hands so you end up taking them off anyway. These lean toward the latter but not to the point that I can't do ANYTHING with them on. Can I use my phone? No. Can I rummage through my bag & get something out? Yes. I ordered the small & they're still an inch longer than my fingertips. I do have small hands but their small is more like a big medium. That does make it a little harder to maneuver in but still possible to an extent. They are warm. Not the warmest but enough. It was 17° this morning & windy & though my fingers weren't toasty they weren't frozen like they get in lots of other gloves. The exterior material definitely kept the wind out. The inside is definitely not sherpa though. It's similar to a polyester filled pillow. Soft-ish but sherpa is what was stated, why I bought them, & would make them warmer. Will I repurchase these? Nope. Will I use the pair I have? Daily. Would I recommend them? Sure, if you're in the market for gloves to be worn in 20°+ weather with kind of a soft interior that are 1.5 sizes bigger & don't want to use your phone"
4.0,It makes a nice costume. But it's definitely not a legit dress.
4.0,Love this! I did loose one rhinestone the first day I wore it but other than that its a great buy!
4.0,A great set for a 14 year old boy at homecoming.
4.0,"I like sunglasses, good quality, feels good to wear, I can’t give a 5 stars because frame is metal kind of heavy and I feel pressure on my nose, can’t wear sunglasses  all the time. Price is good can’t complain"
4.0,"my husband likes form fitting and i disagree but he still noticed and liked the dress..thats a pretty dress honey...<br />like another review stated, there is definitely an odd gapping of fabric near the chest area, i actually ordered because i thought this would assist in accommodation of my over abundant bosoms that usually dont fit in fitted materials,36 DDD, but although the XL fit, the gapping is due to the straps being too close together. the front is an exact match to the back...a cheap manufacturing shortcut. fortunately i can alter this easily.<br /><br />im 5'4&#34; 175 lbs and id buy more if it were as flowy as it looks on that adorable petite model.  it doesnt sweep the floor but the length isnt all '90s highwater either"
4.0,Really fun shoe for my 3yo son. He's had them about a week and LOVES them. The only downside is they don't stay charged very long (have to charge them just about every night). Also some of the lights have stopped working... I don't know how long these shoes will last but they are very cool. Hopefully the manufacturer can continue to improve the product.
4.0,Not a lot of upkeep.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. It is like jogging suit materials. Which I love. Nice and thick. I ordered a medium. I'm 155 lbs.. 5'3&quot;
4.0,The item was 2 sizes to small.
4.0,"Purchased this one on ebay, which is why it's not verified purchase.. I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and it's surprisingly comfortable, not tight at all. I have a bit of a tummy and it's quite forgiving in that area the way it drapes over. My only concern is the zipper feels cheap so I don't know how it'll hold up. But for the price I paid, it's a good value and I'm looking forward to using it for cosplay later this year."
4.0,Too small.  My error.  Will return and order the right size.
4.0,Keeps feet warm stylish
4.0,Nice and Warm! Ordered a 31 measurements are 28&#34; and 38&#34;. It's slightly loose around hip area.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3850268ad67efee2a5def01e7eae5619]] It feels super cheap and had to replace the ring on the pin with a split ring key ring, but other than that its great! My 5 year old nephew loves it and starts disco dancing or flossing everytime someone tosses the boogie bomb. The price is a bit high for the quality, but hey, it was an xmas gift."
4.0,"Really pretty. Great packaging. It has a flat back side so it’ll prevent from getting caught into things, but definitely doesn’t look expensive.<br />It took longer to receive than prime shipping."
4.0,"Fit really good, didn't hold up with really hard hiking as well as I'd hoped. Zippers in the pockets busted."
4.0,I expected this to come a little below my 85 lbs daughter's breast but it hits right in the middle. I ended up having to put a vest over it it's too wide on the sides but easy to adjust. Just not as pictured.
4.0,Keep my glasses on my face.
4.0,5’6 125lb<br />Fits as expected
4.0,"Perfect sized bag for travel or every day use. I too noticed a harsh chemical smell when I first opened the package, but it did dissipate considerably after a few days."
4.0,Great band and very comfortable. Had to take it to the jewelry store to adjust the band cause it was too big. Otherwise than that it’s good and matches the watch great. Thanks.
4.0,This is a great dress however the sleeves are too small for me and dig into my arm.
4.0,"I read the other reviews, and boy am I glad I did. I am usually between a size 10 and 12 and I ordered the 2XL. Fits perfect!"
4.0,"Cute but way too long, even for a maxi, for me. I got the smallest and I’m 5’2”. Am having it tailored."
4.0,"I really had to give some thought in how to rate this top. If you order your regular size then the top might be a bit more form-fitting than you see on the model. It's one that I personally won't wear unless I have some type of compression cami or spanx underneath it. At my regular size it clings to every nook and cranny it can find. For me, this top isn't flattering at all. It does have a nice feel to it and you can tell it's a good quality top, however, I don't (yet) have the body to pull this one off. Don't get me wrong, I wear quite a lot of fitted tops, this one just doesn't hit in the right spots. So like I said, I had a hard time rating it; it doesn't work for me, but it could definitely be a great top for someone else. I'd recommend sizing up if you want it to fit like it is on that model in the picture, otherwise it'll probably be more fitted than you like, too."
4.0,Very nice sneaker. My son loves these sneakers. Gave 4 instead of 5 only because fit a bit smaller than expected.
4.0,A bit warm in the summer but definitely a must for walking on hard floors if you have PF.<br />The look like Man Uggs which are really not to my liking but they are good for the house
4.0,"After what seemed like an eternity, I finally was able to get this thing on (No way I was asking my BF for help) I do actually feel much slimmer in my mid section! It's all nice and tucked in. Its helping me sit straight up and its very smooth.<br /><br />2 complaints though:<br />1. I by no means have a long torso- let's be honest, I'm short and squishy. This cincher is just too short! Another inch and we'd be golden. Now I just have this awkward biscuit can pudge sticking out. Not cute.<br />2. I am large breasted. In squeezing everything nice and tight, this cincher gives my boobs a major lift. Now most people would be like &#34;this is awesome, Victoria Secret lift for 1/3 the price.&#34; But personally, the less attention I can draw to the girls the better!<br /><br />All things aside, I do think it is worth a try, especially for the price and quality compared to other waist cinchers I have seen. But do yourself a favor and follow their sizing chart!"
4.0,"I like how solid these feel, good quality for 7 bucks."
4.0,It is a nice blouse.  The colors aren’t what I thought but perhaps that was really my error.
4.0,"My daughter needed something for under her field hockey kilt. She can fit a MD/LG depending on cut. These shorts serve their purpose. I could have sized down to a small for a sniffer fit, bc they were a bit loose on the thighs so they ride up a little. Other than that no complains. She loves wearing them even just around the house."
4.0,Nice. Color great. Looks good just a little snug
4.0,"So far so good,  it would've been a 5 but it was a lil big.  I shouldn't of listened to the other reviews about the fit,  they said it ran snug and I ordered a XXL.  I thought the sizes were right on,  if I would've ordered an XL it would've fit perfect. Also the zipper being on the left side is wierd but not a big deal."
4.0,they fit my wife
4.0,I've had them a couple weeks. Within the fist week a link broke and gets caught on my cloths. Kinda irritating but I'm not exactly easy on things. Feel and work awesome
4.0,"These are comfy except I wish the waist band had a little stretch to it. it gaps a little when I tie the drawstring. They do look good, tho. I am 5-10 and 150 lbs (proportional) and the 4-6 tall worked perfectly. If they weren't so expensive for what they are, I'd order another pair."
4.0,Good as expected thank you!
4.0,Took awhile until received but good looking cap that fits my bubble head.
4.0,Maybe I don't know what aquamarine is supposed to look like but I was expecting a bluer gemstone. I don't have any other aquamarine jewelry but this appealed to me because it's my son's birthstone.<br /> some angles you can see a hint of light blue otherwise it just looks like a clear diamond type gem. The setting is pretty high but it might add to the comfort of the ring.<br />Other than that it's so beautiful and I am very glad I made this purchase!
4.0,Expected better material for the price.
4.0,Easy fit to Fitbit.
4.0,Slightly see-through but very comfy and perfect for work or play. Fits just right.
4.0,"These look amazing. I love the color and the shape of thw glasses. I wish they were polarized but knew they weren't when I bought them.  They just don't block the sun as much as I had hoped. The purple lenses are gorgeous though. They have a great style. They come with a hard case, soft case and cleaning cloth."
4.0,"Would have given this 5 stars, but the lining is not done as well as it could be.  The look and quality of the outside is great, but the lining is just loose and makes it difficult to just reach in and find what I need, if it's not right on top.  Would be great if it was more structured inside!"
4.0,When I received the pedals and shoes I did not find the clips and requested a return authorization.  While repacking  the shoes I found the plastic bag with the clips.  My other complaint was that the pedals did not operate smoothly or rotate easily.  Since I was anxious to try this system out I adjusted the tension on the pedals and now they are silky smooth.  I did my first ride and now am very happy with everything.
4.0,"This was purchased, then returned because it wasn't going to work for what we were going for.<br /><br />It seems to be of medium quality, but it's at a low price point.  This is great if you want to wear it once or twice as part of a costume, I just wouldn't recommend it for warmth/long lasting durability - it was shedding a bit and left black fur on anything it touched.<br /><br />I'd buy a similar product from the manufacturer again, because you get what you pay for (and it's decent to good at that)<br /><br />Pros: Cheap and looks cool<br />Cons: Sheds a bit"
4.0,"Fabric is not as ""heavy"" as my last umbrella, but I'm happy with it."
4.0,nice very pretty and good price the picture doesn't do it justice
4.0,"I like the band. Looks good, feels good but not quick release. I must have mixed up and ordered a different one than I meant to. I like to change up and I'm not coordinated enough to use this one."
4.0,"I am pear shaped and this dress does an amazing job of hiding my hips and slimming me down. It has a nice weight to it and is totally opaque. it's very soft and comfy on the skin.<br />It does shows every line (bra strap) and bump so I wear one of my seamless sports bras underneath. It is long but not too long, I am 5'5 and it touches the floor but not much more. The sleeves however are way too long and at some point I will get around to having them shortened.<br />That's the only improvement I would really suggest - either make the sleeves shorter or make the lower sleeve tighter so it doesn't fall down.<br />Overall very satisfied and can't stop wearing this. Had many compliments too!"
4.0,"Another skirt that the price was right, the picture looked good, fit was good, BUT when it arrived we were surprised to find out the fabric was shiny.  Shiny just LOOKS cheap to me.  I love a good price, but don't want the fabric to look cheap.  I bought it for my daughter and she decided to keep it.  I actually bought it for her because she had pinned it on a Pinterest board we share, so I think her heart was for it, even when it showed up with shiny fabric.  She would probably give it 5 stars, but I gave it 4 because I wish the fabric didn't look so cheap."
4.0,"Beautiful, well made and delicate chain."
4.0,"I ordered this shirt to wear since I have two boys.  I selected small upon ordering, and assumed that I would be sent a small shirt.  When it arrived, it was a medium.  I was unable to return it due to needing to wear it within the next few days for my one year old's birthday party.  Although it is a bit large, the shirt is soft and comfy.  The screen printing shows up well.  Overall, I would order again. Great quality for the price!"
4.0,Great for Halloween. One or twice usage. Just for trying deteriorates in sewing.<br /><br />Looks cool for the Holidays
4.0,I like this necklace and earrings set for the price they are good.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8c7782055d540bc5ac28b9420468ee7]] This sweater is great if you live somewhere that gets cold. I love when my shirts are snug but I kind of like this with some leggings. I'm 5'5"" and this is almost tunic length. I don't know how well it'll hold up in the wash but great quality for the price. Also it's mustard yellow not sunshine yellow."
4.0,Super cute necklaces.
4.0,"Pretty outfit, runs a little on the snug side, definitely size up."
4.0,"I'd give this product a 5 star review had it been the dimensions it advertised. I bought this SPECIFICALLY for the 35&#34; width because that's what I needed for my keyboard drawer. The item that arrived was only 30&#34; which basically renders this useless for my use.<br /><br />The build quality of this mat is incredible though. I've bought Razor and Perixx and both were nice but this new mat is REALLY thick and the stitching is solid. I also like that it's a solid black without logos.<br /><br />EDIT: The company contacted me and corrected the posting which now reports the correct sizing of 30&#34;. This particular company is nice to work with, they respond very timely and made it right by me. I would definitely work with this company again and if you're looking for a 30&#34; wide mat this mat is a GREAT choice!"
4.0,I will be returning this. It fits weird.
4.0,I get many compliments on the bag.  The middle &#34;compartment&#34; is a waste and gets in the way.  The bag should just be one big open compartment.  It has a very nice look and a good feel.  Fits nicely on your arm (I do not use the shoulder strap) and works well with any outfit/occasion.
4.0,"I looooove this bag, the details are wow😍.The only thing is, I was expected to be bigger."
4.0,Love it so warm
4.0,The dress is very cute but the fabric is thin and it runs small.
4.0,"I wanted to love this swimsuit but the fit is just a little odd. I am 5'4, 120 pounds and I ordered a medium because it translates to a US 4 to 6. The trouble isn’t that the top isn’t as shown, it’s that the material is so thin that the fabric doesn’t drape the way it looks in the ad. The cups and the off the shoulder portion of the top are nice but where it criss-crosses over the front it just looks awkward and isn’t thick enough to hang beautifully like it does in the ad. I think it may be better off tying the extra fabric in a bow as opposed to behind the back, it just looks off. The bottom looks exactly as shown and fits well. The idea of this swimsuit is very cute and I didn't want to rate it too low because it *is* constructed as shown in the ad, it just doesn't lay on my body in a nice way."
4.0,It's a decent bag.. I bought it for the logo and colors to match. It is a smaller sized though.
4.0,This sweater is soft and warm. Fits just right
4.0,It was slightly larger than expected but love the material
4.0,My wedding ring was always turning on my finger with the setting turned down.  This inexpensive ring adjuster definitely solved that problem.  Professionally done ring adjusters are well over $100.
4.0,Hat fits well but is not great quality for the price. Overall it is a decent hat but could be better.
4.0,Gave to my brother for Xmas he loved it
4.0,Love it ... but the inside smells awful 🤢
4.0,Fit as expected except the length is a bit short.  They did not reach my ankles as shown in the picture.  I am only 5' 4&#34;.
4.0,Just what I need to fix some very worn heels. The multiple sizes is great!
4.0,"The quality of the product is nice, but it was big for me. I wear size US 12 and I ordered Large."
4.0,Beautiful and delicate necklace. The box is cute and makes it easy to gift. Great value for a lovely piece of jewelry.
4.0,They feel good but fit a bit tighter then expected.
4.0,Slightly see through but suppper cute!
4.0,"I liked that it was a 3-pack. They’re a little less rigid than I imagined and sometimes the zipper gets sticky and tricky. Still, for the cost, I’d buy them again."
4.0,It says that this bag is leather but I don't think that it is. On the other hand it is a good size and I carry it on rainy days so I don't get water stains on my leather bags.
4.0,Brother loves this beanie
4.0,"I was hesitant to purchase this product.  However, when I received the product, I was pleasantly surprise.  All of the charms were wrapped preventing them from getting scratch.  I would recommend this give to anyone who is looking for a way to commemorate this year's class of 2020 graduate.  While many of the graduates didn't get to celebrate graduation in the traditional way, gifts like this Charm Bracelet can make it special."
4.0,Very sparkly!  Good quality!
4.0,Like.  On the smaller side which I personally love.
4.0,"The top is a not too loose, but not bad. A bit short, I am 5'2 and it is above my knee, almost mid thigh"
4.0,neat shirt
4.0,It fits and works well for my purpose. I would recommend. Its good quality.
4.0,Bigger then I thought. I wear them all the time. Love them!
4.0,Like to change very much
4.0,Very nice for boat shoes.
4.0,"It is a nice jewery box, however it isn't exactly what I asked for. I wanted a SOFT travel case. Can use this one for other purposes though."
4.0,fits a little large. comes vacuum sealed so its a little matted upon arrival. one that did not come vacuum sealed looks better
4.0,"This shirt fits better than I expected.  Super love it!  Very bright colors,  not cheaply made."
4.0,These are for older children. 4 and up I'd say.
4.0,"The colors are cute, the stay nice in wash. But few of them have a seam on the side of  the toe part that sticks out and presses on the side of my foot and makes a tad uncomfortable."
4.0,"Small is too small, medium is a little large for me."
4.0,Run big.
4.0,Loved the color and fit of this dress. The only issue I had was that it was very long on me since I’m short. I’m only 5’1” so the dress comes down about mid calf. I’m just going to get it hemmed to knee length and it’ll be perfect.
4.0,"Very cute, on trend shirt with a cute tie in the front and slight V-neck. Really like it! Only downside is that I am tall and it does appear to be a bit short"
4.0,"I love the color and design, but I got these in the exact same size as a pair of Pumas I have, and these are slightly too small. The back of my heel rubs, but that happened before I broke my other Pumas in a bit too. Overall super comfy and cute"
4.0,"Nice quality with lots of pockets. Good shoulder strap. A tiny bit short if you're  used to reaching into your bag without taking it off your shoulder, but I'm sure I will adapt. It does have a fairly offensive smell when you fist unpackage it, however it goes away with a couple days of airing out."
4.0,Love this swimsuit!!! I'm 5'5 and 185lbs. I got a large and it fits amazing! I normally wear a size 9/10 Jean's and large shirt. Definitely going to be buying another one!!!
4.0,I didn't particularly like the stones on the pendant. I intend to give this as a gift.
4.0,Shoe was nice and fit comfortable but she only wore it one time and it started peeling
4.0,"Very Elegant, came neatly wrapped in a case."
4.0,"This is so short, and I’m only 5’4”. It has to be worn with leggings but the sizing is peculiar. Good around the chest, baggy everywhere else. Struggling to make this work."
4.0,"Great at wicking away sweat. Keeps me nice and dry all night. The band on the shorts is a bit snug, go a size up. I love them, will be ordering more."
4.0,I love this! Just wish I would have gotten a larger though
4.0,"I got this for a musical I was in, and wore it every day for a week. It held up well. My only complaint is that there were a few times I felt that the seams were about to rip when I tied it, but they didn't, so I'm happy. Would buy again."
4.0,"these are of very nice quality, though are a little small for my face"
4.0,color and material is very nice...it is a little baggier on me than I expected.  For the price it is a cute shirt.
4.0,"Really love the skirt but runs small I'm normally a medium sometime small , I did buy medium but too small even if I used it at my waist"
4.0,"This product is a little on the small size, but has an almost completely open back so it gives it a lot of room. It's very slimming and sexy! Love it! It definitely wouldn't be complimentary for a person with a belly though. The way the lace is in front and the 2 seams up the front don't allow for any excess baggage. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I really like the way they feel,very comfortable"
4.0,"Ran a little small, but good color, and good quality materials!"
4.0,I especially LOVE the black and white plaid band- the others can get a little irritating on my wrist after a long period of wearing them as they are not smooth on the inside of the band. They are cute and fit perfectly.
4.0,I am very happy with the Hat and Scarf quality. This the best we could get for the price offered.<br />Its very warm and our son feel cosy and comfortable. Definitely recommend this product.
4.0,"Amazing, love them."
4.0,I like the way it covers my mouth and nose and I'm able to breathe better while wearing it. I use it for every day need
4.0,"Great fit, well hidden any imperfections,  nice colors. You will feel good wearing this suit!<br />Bottoms are full fitting. Not a favorite, but I have other bottoms that will work."
4.0,It's a nice dress for the money.
4.0,Runs a little small for winter layering. Lots of pockets which is really nice.
4.0,"Gift for my son, he liked it very much!"
4.0,"Quality of fabric not as good as some t-shirts, sleeves are skimpy Otherwise, picture is great!"
4.0,Cute dress - great color - nice feel BUT for me I was uncomfortable with the waist seem location.  Not at the waist and not an empire waist.  For someone else this dress may be perfect - just not for me.  So cute and soft though - wish it would have worked.
4.0,"Cute dress.  The stitching is not great, but given the price, what can you expect.  It looks really cute on through."
4.0,"Very nice, good quality, good size for jewelry too, but just didn't work for what I needed it for (a card protector for poker)."
4.0,So feminine. The material is thick and a little different but it works.
4.0,Nice colorful pattern and comfortable to wear.
4.0,They came quickly and were as described except that the bag of bronze/gold ones had some random letters so that made me a few shoes short. Not a big deal because I needed more silver for my project and worth the price. Shipped fast too.
4.0,"I really like this top, but it was not the right shade for what I needed (I was matching it to a coral-colored dress to wear underneath, and it was more salmon-orange-ish than coral). It fit me perfectly; I am 5' 3&#34; and weigh 105 lbs. The lace is a nice quality lace, and I preferred this to the the top I ultimately chose, as far as style goes. Just wish the color was less orange."
4.0,"I like it, but after awhile the silver wore off and now it smells like metal with a copper tone on the end."
4.0,"Purchased as a gift. They were exactly what she wanted and I was willing to pay for it to come from a US company. Only complaint is that it wasn't easy to get them to light up. It took just the right touch, but once that was done they are just as described."
4.0,It next to the zip it’s a hole in the seam but other then that I love the jacket.
4.0,"Stays closed and protected, fits well in pants pocket.  Seem pretty durable, and lens clarity is great for inexpensive readers.  Not extremely comfortable, but they are for emergency situations, so acceptable level of comfort.  Very satisfied, and would recommend."
4.0,"THE MATERIAL  WAS A LITTLE THINNER THAN I EXPECTED BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT FITS PERFECT & ITS CUTE ON!"
4.0,"I thought it was a necklace! Since the chances are slim that I'd wear this as a headpiece, it's good to know that it can still double as a necklace. It's definitely more along the lines of costume jewelry, but you could easily wear it with the right outfit. Its nice, but I don't love it."
4.0,These glasses will elevate the look of even the simplest outfit. They are well made and chic.
4.0,Great deal and average shipping time. Only complaint is that there is not one matching pair in the whole bunch.
4.0,Normally a large had to get a 2xl. How embarrassing
4.0,Did fit a bit tight but looks just like display and good material
4.0,I love the colors and the silk look but the inside is like a cheese cloth kinda material that make my face sweat a little under the mask.
4.0,Seems like a very nice band. The only negative I have is that the buckle is unnecessarily large.
4.0,"So pretty, I wish it fit. Beautiful, great quality fabric, but the elastic at waist is too snug. Had to return."
4.0,"Good quality bracelet, highly recommended!"
4.0,Gorgeous dress! But the elastic on the waist was extremely small.. I contemplated sending it back but my daughter loved it so much so I took it to a seamstress to add more elastic and it fit perfect! She Got a lot of compliments @ the wedding!
4.0,"The vest is great, the bottles not so much.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Light, adjustable, great fit. Does not chafe!!! I wore it for 15 miles in super hot weather with high humidity over a tank top, nothing chafed which is a big feat since I'm very prone to chafing in these conditions. The adjustable fit in back is very comfortable. Good amount of storage, zippered stretchy pockets are great.<br />Cons:<br />The bottles aren't great. They fall down as they empty and you end up having to dig them out to be able to drink out of them. Even trying to tighten them around the neck of the bottle, they still fall. Not very comfortable to drink out of either. I couldn't get one adjusted right and the hard part of the rim ended up leaving a bruised spot on my chest. I remember one reviewer saying she used Salomon bottles for this vest and I may try that, or simply use the bladder for the back - which you have to buy separately.<br /><br />Smaller women beware!!! I'm 5'9&#34; and skinny, but I have a bigger frame. I have the small/extra small and when the bottles are empty I had to have it tightened all the way, I think this size would not be small enough for a smaller woman."
4.0,Bold colors are pretty against the black. Nice fit. The only issue I had was the smell. After removing from packing it has a strong odor. (Maybe the dye) Had to pack for next day so didn’t wash and after wearing it it still had smell. Other than smell it’s great!
4.0,"Cute design, great fit!"
4.0,The goggles work very well in keeping the water out of my eyes.  I think I'm going to enjoy having them.
4.0,"I thought they were really cool, saw them and got them for a friend. However, I neglected to pay attention to the gauge of the stud. It's 18 I think, and she has 20 gauge in her ears so they wouldn't fit without a little stretching. She doesn't want to stretch so I guess I'll be trying to give them away. Cool product and neat design though!"
4.0,"decent socks they lasted longer then the last set of hanes i bought ,so they are pretty good"
4.0,"Gave it a 4-star because it is a very pretty top. Well constructed. Quality textile. Unfortunately it did not fit me quite right and I had to return it. A bit too snug around the hips and the top wrap portion was a bit too open. I’m 5’7”, 185lb, 40 C/D and normally wear size 12 or L/XL depending on the cut of the item. I normally have hovered around 155-165 lbs. My curves are distributed a bit differently at185lbs and I’m still trying figure out how to dress them. :-)"
4.0,This is a nice mix of colors for craft jewelry projects.<br />A good gift for a crafter or for yourself.
4.0,My daughter loves these shoes. They fit great and hold up really well. I would give these 5 stars but they are labeled as boy shoes. So...
4.0,"These were very nicely stitched, seemingly well-made for the price (haven’t washed and dried yet, I’m hoping they hold up through a gentle cycle or in a garment bag as they are satin). They fit TTS with even some wiggle room! Only complaint is that they weren’t double lined, so they were a bit see through in the booty, I just put nylons on to hide the panty lines better and it was completely fine!"
4.0,"Great sweater for the price.  The arms are a bit itchy.  I had to wear a tshirt underneath, but otherwise very pretty and flattering"
4.0,Fun hat for my grandson and he really enjoyed it. It was great for Thanksgiving pictures
4.0,Worth the money bought 3 of them
4.0,These are cute and go in easy if you get the hang of it
4.0,"Super cute addition to my purse. I love the look oversized charms give and this one is perfect. 4 stars because I did have to trim the hair around the nose and eyes because you couldn’t see them at all. On top of that, it sheds quite a bit so keep that in mind."
4.0,having a little problem with them on a 3 yr old. but they are nice ssfety glasses
4.0,It works as described. The only reason for detracting is that it feels flimsy. However so far its been doing its job (I like in Ithaca New York...)
4.0,It’s cute and fits great for me. I got size L. Bottoms are a little cheeky/small but not too bad.
4.0,Does look good on but it pulls a little at the neck. But I like it
4.0,Just what i needed! Fits as expected!
4.0,As expected. Cheap cotton wrinkles easy.
4.0,"Very cute shoe, but runs a full size too large"
4.0,"I liked it, used to dress up or church."
4.0,I use the tie for wedding perfect colors !!!
4.0,Very cute. My daughter loves it
4.0,"I don't know if this is really leather, but I like the band.  It works okay for me.  Nice strong magnet.  I have not had it too long so I have no idea how it will where, but for $19 it allows me to purchase more bands to change the look of the watch as I desire."
4.0,Nice looking watch and fun.
4.0,"Very nice, comfortable fabric. I am short and it is too long on me. I will use the fabric I cut off the length to make a tie belt. This dress actually needs a tie belt to make it look more finished."
4.0,Cute shirts. Size and quality were just what I expected. My husband and I wear these on our monthly date night.
4.0,"I really like these shoes, they fit like expected and look good. I give only 4 stars because the traction was not as tacky as I think they should be. (my child slid around on the wood floor when first trying them on). They have improved in traction after being worn and roughed up"
4.0,Don't like I had to put the pins in. Super small an drop easy. Band is cute though
4.0,Nice material but too big and a small would be too tight. Had to return.
4.0,I really wanted to love these pair of mirrored aviators from WearMe Pro but it has a scratch on the lens when I received it. I was really disappointed because it didn't come in a hard case to protect the aviators. I can still wear them as the scratch doesn't affect how I see through the lenses. I like the color because it's very stylish and the ear hinge is adjustable so it fits snugly on my face. The metal of the frames is well made. It's very lightweight and should be great for everyday use. These mirrored aviators are just so fragile and has to be cleaned constantly to avoid finger marks. I like that the color of the lenses transitions from red to yellow depending on the way you move with them or how the light hits them. It's very trendy but I don't think they're gonna last that long. I have to disclose that I received this product at a promotional discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,Beautiful dress.  But.. .i bought a medium for my daughter & it fit me. I'm a plus size 18 dress. With a 42DD bust
4.0,fits good a lot more high waisted than expected
4.0,"My son got this for his girl friend.  It was as pictured, but did not have the &#34;kiss me&#34; stamp on the back as shown in the photo when the order was placed."
4.0,"I love it because it doesn't have a tail, so it kind of looks like a bonobo ape. But it was missing a couple stones, so doesn't get 5 stars,"
4.0,Bought these as a gift for my mother.  She loves them and said they are nice because they aren't too tight on her legs.
4.0,"Haven't used them yet, but look like they'll work as described."
4.0,"Wife wore this as a maternity dress for her baby shower. She is normally a medium, so she bought a medium, it fit her well (she was 35 weeks pregnant). The dress was stretchy, and worked for maternity dress. It was a great find for the price (in person I must say, the material looks a little cheap, but once its on it was lovely). She got a lot of compliments on it, but she said that it needed a lining/spanx and used one of her own. The best part she said was the price and the fact that it was delivered in 2 days with PRIME, she couldn't find a similar spring/pink dress in stores for her shower (honoring baby girl) in the middle of January, so this was a lifesaver."
4.0,I really enjoy the &#34;look&#34; of these glasses. I wish they were a bit bigger but way worth it for the price!
4.0,"So comfy and soft , stretchy, but it looks kinda stained idk how to explain it. I love it tho n will wear it a ton"
4.0,"These work pretty good for my 6 year old, but be careful not to tight the rubber piece that attaches to you glassestoo much because it wi break easy. Cute colors and options though. It does it's job for what you pay.Super fast shipping."
4.0,It's a but smaller than I expected but it's good enough.
4.0,Nice for by the pool
4.0,Great work belt!  Stretches enough that keeps your pants on and not binding around the waist.
4.0,"The crotch is a bit low, so they pull up really high, over your belly button, but I like the length on the legs."
4.0,Bought as gift for young boy. Loved them!
4.0,"Runs small.  Didn't notice this was Asian sizes, they need to convert to US sizes.  Dress was cute."
4.0,cute got them for my granddaughter
4.0,"Super comfy, and closest target underwear dupe. Only problem, a few of them came already messed up, but worth it for the price."
4.0,Fulfilled purpose.
4.0,Super cute but use your own chain. The chain that comes with it is fairly weak/fragile.
4.0,These were fun for a little while but quit working after a month.
4.0,"I bought them as a gift, but I wish I could have them myself."
4.0,I also have the color one and I like them both
4.0,I love the pattern material!
4.0,"Got this in red and I love it, elegant and comfortable."
4.0,"These shades appear to be of good quality.  They are very attractive looking also.  It's too bad they are on the small size as far as fit goes.  As a woman, they are a bit too narrow to fit my head.  I would definitely not recommend them for a man, unless he has a small head.  They have very little ""give"" as far as the hinge goes.  They would probably give me a headache if I wore them an hour or more."
4.0,"I love how they look on me; got many complements. Only two issues, one, they are very heavy and hang low on my earlobe. Also, since they are heavy and they pin that goes in the ear is long, they pinch. I was unable to wear them all day."
4.0,I gave this product 4 stars because I felt that they were extremely tiny.... the prongs take over the pearl and you can barely see the pearl. The earring is very long and hangs way past the ear lobe. The seller is great though but these particular earrings were way too tiny for my 9 month old girl. (15 lbs)
4.0,My dog has been wearing this a couple of weeks.  She gets compliments all the time.
4.0,It’s  cool and comfortable.
4.0,They were just bigger than I expected them to be.
4.0,Prompt delivery. Fit as expected. The dress is of good quality- I would order from them again.
4.0,Brought for my cousin for her honeymoon:) loved that it came on time and it’s my cousin’s favorite color! I don’t know if she knows what to do with it but I’m sure she figured it out! Must buy!
4.0,Pretty color!
4.0,Quick delivery. Seems to deafen sound. True test when I mow. Will test out soon.
4.0,I read the reviews so I knew to order up a size and it fit perfectly without the hassle of a return
4.0,"Good wicking dry shirt, even under short sleeve"
4.0,As advertised.  Nice and slim.  Cards are tight but as it's leather they're starting to loosen.  This is a good solid product for the cost and would recommend it to those who want something slim and carries 4-5 cards and money.  Great for travel as well....
4.0,Beautiful back.
4.0,"My daughter loves all things Percy Jackson! She was very excited to get this necklace for her birthday, but it does like to fall apart at the clasp."
4.0,It is great and sturdy.<br />Thanks!
4.0,"After reading reviews I figured the blouse would be small so I ordered a size up, still the arms were slightly tight.  With that said...I really like this top, you can play it up or down with jewelry and it is slimming because of the length.  Going to order another soon.  Washes great on cold and hang to dry or use low setting on dryer.  A little see thru, (I got black) but nothing even a 60 year old would find offensive however if I wore it to church I'd wear a tank under it."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the fit and of this! I typically wear an 8/10 in women's dresses and this &#34;one size&#34; dress fit perfectly. It's a little flowy, but not oversized on me! I am 5'4&#34; and it hits mid-thigh, so the reviews that this is not a great fit for taller women is definitely true. My only issue with this cover-up is that you really need to handwash it and not put in the washer. I threw mine in the washer and the tassels were extremely tangled when I pulled it out. Maybe I should have known that before throwing it in the washer, but just a head's up to anyone else buying this!"
4.0,"Love it, even though it runs a little large."
4.0,"These seem to be well made and the fit is good. The description states there is padding in the palm, but there is only faux leather reinforcement. I have not used them yet, but I expect to get good service from them."
4.0,"It's a nice materia and a good fit. Athought I don't like that the zipper ends right under my arm pit. That bothers me a little, I'm usually a size 10 in dresses, sometimes an 8. This dress fits a bit tight on the top part, I guess I was expecting it to be a bit stretchier? I do like the style, very classic/classy look."
4.0,I love the purse. I gave it 4 stars because this purse is more heavier than I expected.
4.0,"Hardly ever order shoes/boots online because they never fit when they arrive... these surprised me! They FIT! The fur lining is warm and keeps my feet toasty, good length up the calf and they do seem waterproof as claimed ( not tested the theory yet ). My only &#34; complaints &#34; are 1. They are really stiff in the top of the foot.. doesn't give very much when your foot naturally flexes as you walk ( hopefully this is just due to them being new ) and 2. The laces are WAY too long.. I wouldn't recommend these for deep snow as it will get all packed in the laces and make a mess when you take them off but otherwise, these are a great boot for general use outdoors in wet/muddy/light snowy conditions! I can't wait to put them to good use this winter!"
4.0,"Very pretty, but too small.  Had to return it."
4.0,Very nice.good quality
4.0,"The watches looks good and hopefully would also last long. The only issue is that it does not come is cases, so it's not a good gift option."
4.0,good hat for the price .. I just had 2 skin cancers removed from my face so the coverage is great..
4.0,Wish they came in different colors.  They do work great and keeps me from putting the glasses on my head.
4.0,Like a lot but a little small when wrapped tight enough for a bracelet.
4.0,"Nice dress. You can wear on a date, at church, or at work. Dress is stretchy & fit snug to your body. I believe all body types would look good in the this dress. I would recommend wearing dark under garments or a slip bc material is thin & you can see through it."
4.0,"HUGE. Kind of cumbersome when I'm walking my dogs, but otherwise keeps you very dry. I have tested it out in the wind for fear I may fly away due to size. lol."
4.0,Good quality. These were large for me. You might include size in your description in the furture.
4.0,"I have only wore it once.<br />I love the bracelet, the necklace chain could be a little more sturdy- I wouldn't recommend daily wear."
4.0,I don't like how the back of the beanie sticks up.
4.0,I was looking for some hats that would keep my head and ears warm without being so warm as to cause sweating. I was happy to find a set that weren't all the same color.
4.0,If you want the baggy look order a size up
4.0,"This is a good Blazer for $20 although, it gets annoying when you take it on and off because of the material on the inside. Wish it came with no wrinkles. For $20 you can't go wrong"
4.0,"I love this dress! Is very flowy and light, the only inconvenience is that the fabric is very thin and I decided to wear blue biker shorts underneath. I got the white and blue print and after wearing it a handful of times still looks the same, I wash it on the handwash cycle on the washer machine. I still recommend the dress because its super pretty and perfect for the over 100 degrees weather we have in the desert but beware of how thin this fabric is you might want to wear it with something underneath or might be your perfect swimsuit cover up for your swimsuit at the beach, and walking around the beach city."
4.0,I love the design of this.  It's easy to access my cards.  The only downfall is sometimes the zipper sticks.
4.0,"Material is thin, but I got lots of compliments. No one could believe it cost $10."
4.0,I purchased this simply because it was made of coral. As for this was a 35yr wedding anniversary gift.  Very hard to find jewelry made from coral. She actually likes it very much!
4.0,These jeans are good for the price
4.0,To use when dressed up and wearing black shoes.
4.0,A bit too small even though I ordered a size bigger like recommended
4.0,Great for outside workers. Great breathable quality.
4.0,"COLOR IS GOOD, COMFORTABE AND TRUE TO SIZE. I AM A MED AND THATS WHAT I ORDERED."
4.0,The cinnamon color is beautiful and it feels  super soft. Giving it as a gift so hopefully she’s pleased.
4.0,It would have been better a little wider but we were a hit for the costume contest!
4.0,This dress is beautiful and will be perfect for the wedding I’m attending next month. I can’t give it 5 stars for two reasons. One it fits a little large. I’m 5”9 and 135lb pounds. I typically wear a size 4 in dresses but usually have to get them taken in in the chest as I have a smaller bust but curvier mid section and thighs. However this dress fits perfectly in the chest but is a bit large in the waist. I found that pairing a lace belt or a corset belt fixes that problem but I would have liked to order a size down if I knew that was the case. My second issues with it is the material isn’t exactly what pictured. I ordered the 3/4 length sleeve option that looks to have a more satin type bottom as opposed to an all lace bottom. However it’s actually like a little bit rough material not soft and satin looking like it does in the picture. Other than that this dress is wonderful and i will definitely be able to get a few uses from it.
4.0,I were a (M) but because of surgery I bought a (L) it is somewhat small for a (L)
4.0,it felt very soft to my skin
4.0,great size and price
4.0,The mask slips a bit
4.0,Wish it had more organize pockets but it’s made well and the price is great
4.0,"White stitched cotton gloves are what was advertised and that is what you get.  Well made and individually packaged.  The gloves tend to run a little small,so I would be carefull about size.  I normally can get by with a medium because of the stretch, but these are tight.  You may want to size up."
4.0,They look really nice and does not look cheap but they were too big for the hole in my nose. I couldn't get it through. I wish it had like a little point or something to help it glide into my nose.
4.0,It's a good-looking wallet. it's advertised as a gift and comes in a gift box so I got it as a gift for a good friend. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that when he opened the box there was a cardboard with the price in large numbers. That was embarrassing - prices should not be included in gift packaging.
4.0,Ran large in the Hip area. Reordered a smaller size. Cute dress.
4.0,Really the only thing I didn’t care for was the color. Next time will Lean to a blue background or a deep coffee brown.
4.0,"Pros: Heavy cotton material, keeps you dry, does no ride up the leg during the day, waist band stays where you put it.<br />Cons: No support, not real breathable in warmer weather<br /><br />  These underwear have more of a cotton feel instead of a silky or satin feel. The fabric is thicker and warmer than other styles of boxer/briefs. I was surprised they stayed in place all day, despite my climbing in and out of a truck and doing other physical activities that involve bending over and squatting down. The material has moisture wicking ability. Despite being in warmer weather with a high level of activity, I stayed fairly dry. My biggest complaint is that there is no support for the boys. These feel like traditional boxers that are snug to the legs."
4.0,Really comfortable! Fits as expected.
4.0,Fits true to size. Fabric is lightweight. Perfect for late spring early summer
4.0,"Updated!<br />The seller contacted me and sent me a new bra. I must say, the second time around was much better! The material is nicer and it's got a great grey lining. Fits awesome and survived the wash!<br /><br />I recommend this product because of the awesome costumer service. 4 stars because the pads still popped out which is kind of annoying but, easily fixed"
4.0,"Really cute shirt but beware, it’s a junior cut and a very small fit. I recommend ordering a size larger."
4.0,I liked it but it was big in some places but small in the armpit
4.0,"These are pretty small so double check which size you need. I agree with the other reviews about the quality of the handles. They seem sturdy enough for light use! However they will work well for what I need them for - personalized totes for kids, pretend play, and gift bags. Worked well with Cricut"
4.0,Nice item. Fast shipping.
4.0,Fits great! Sizes fun as they should.
4.0,"A little big. Minor alterations needed. I will be removing padding. All in all, I Love the swimsuit."
4.0,"Comfortable and casual fashionable shorts.  They can be worn with a variety of shirt tops or ""Ts"". They are made of a breathable material so they're comfortable to wear for an extended time even on a hot day."
4.0,"Nice for the price. Slinky feeling with side pockets. Just what I was looking for.<br /><br />A style idea would be pockets on the front, either side rather than side pockets."
4.0,"The dress was really nice but it was a little short for the event I was attending. However, OUGES was able to work with me to find me a longer one which is just as nice as this dress. This dress also, fits you in all the right places, a good investment dress."
4.0,"It's a gorgeous watch. A really eye catcher. Big, but no heavy. Manual movement; so no batteries. I almost bought at my local mall, but the tag price was $375.00. While checking the reviews in Amazon, I was surprise to see the price at $198.00. No brainer; so I took a leap of faith. I only hope that it will give me a good and lasting service. Too soon to know yet. But if nay negative issues arises  I'll posted them immediately."
4.0,"Item fits snug but I guess for 3-7 year olds its better snug than loose.  After 2 weeks, the temple rubber padding fell off.  One was lost and the other keeps on falling off.  I've ordered other pairs and had no problem.  I am sending back for full refund and have order another pair."
4.0,"The coat is very comfortable to wear, however, it does come down to mid calf on me.  The only thing that I do not like is the dual zipper.  On a coat that long it is difficult to zip up without catching the fabric."
4.0,The material is soft and smooth to the touch and feels great on the skin. I like the color and the style. This is perfect for spring/autumn weather. It is stretchy and comfortable - good for active out door life style. Recommended.
4.0,Exactly as described my daughter said.  It was super inexpensive and shipping was too so the two combined don't get much better than that.  My daughter wanted it for a specific thing so it fulfilled its need.
4.0,IT WAS OK AS ESPECTED
4.0,Nice looking. I had to tighten screw holding arm on one pair after only a few uses.  Have worn all but red pair and all are holding together after 6 weeks of use.
4.0,I ordered a medium. I'm typically a small but I'm nearly 5'11 and I was concerned about length. It fits well. It's soft and comfortable.
4.0,"These glasses are very sturdy and the color was as expected and vibrant. It comes with a cloth case to put the glasses in which is great to keep the glasses clean, scratch and dust free."
4.0,"I'm not a 100% sold on these. I have very sensitive ears. While comfortable, my ears are a little sore after a couple of days use. On a positive note, they are a perfect size. The different colors are nice too. Will keep an open mind. Can't say that I recommend these, but everyone is different."
4.0,"This is a very pretty skirt . It's flowy and can be casual or dressy. The only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is cuz it's wayyyy too long for me , maybe it's because I'm short but it drags the ground if I don't hold it up . I'm gonna have someone hem it up for me a few inches . Other than that it's wonderful and I'll be ordering more 😁"
4.0,"This jacket is pretty good.  I was looking for something lighter, but this will work in the chillier mornings.  A good jacket for the price."
4.0,It a little flimsy and very wide. I have a huge head and it was even too big on me.
4.0,"This is a simple, retro, affordable dress.  The small floral design on a dark background is what I’m seeing around campus – easy, straightforward and understated.  The informal look of the 50’s is very visible with the young co-eds of today.  This dress is machine washable and easy to care for. A winner."
4.0,Good quality bifocal sunglasses. However; Glasses are larger than I expected. I ordered grey and white bifocal glasses to match my bicycle and helmet  but received grey and yellow instead. Very disappointed!
4.0,"Great packaging, looks durable and like decent quality for the price."
4.0,"Cute top! I usually wear a small, ordered a large instead to allow a &#34;flowing&#34; fit. Fits well! Arrived much sooner than expected!"
4.0,"Lo único que me debería mejorar es que las botas vienen sin soporte de talón, el material es ligero y de  mediana resistencia, definitivamente no es “Heavy Duty”. Pero por el costo para trabajo ligero y cómodo, están bien."
4.0,"Fits my note 8 great,cards slots are tight your cards will not fall out."
4.0,I had to go one size up but it fits great now
4.0,nice bag my gf like this
4.0,the tale was a little longer than expect but the it was so cute and worked out great on my daughter
4.0,It was a gift & my daughter really likes it
4.0,pretty good & very thin
4.0,These fit both glasses I wear regularly. The tint is pretty light but does a good job from all sun angles for driving.
4.0,I like the material. It is hard to wear a strapless bra with this or bandeau as it will likely show unless I constantly pull my top up-or maybe I should have bought a smaller size (i bought a medium) other than that I like it. Cute summer top
4.0,"I was so excited about this dress. And there is a lot to like about it. I would say the color is more of a deep red and not quite burgundy. It is sexy without being overt by hugging curves but showing mininal skin. The detail at the top is my favorite and it is amazing and the bottom half is essentially like a pencil skirt. The dress material isn't too thin and is a little forgiving but it clings to every curve along the way. I usually wear a size 12 and 38D and this dress fit the top well but I just was uncomfortable with the bottom half being so tight, but that might just be me and my body issues! Break out the good spanks! I love the little slit in the back and think this dress can be a great one for someone confident and looking to be noticed!"
4.0,"Although perfect and super cute in all other areas, these are super large for my tiny head. I obviously did not read the fine print before buying. Wish they were a bit smaller and I'd give them 5 stars for sure. Also, they came in very nice packaging."
4.0,"Not bad. One pocket was sewn shut an accident I think. I was able to remove the stitching and it will likely need resewn. Runs small, normally I would buy an XL, I purchased XXL. Was Snug over my hips."
4.0,"This infinity bracelet is very nice. It's a simple design, not too fussy, and adjustable. I will wear it every day, as it goes with everything."
4.0,"I'm 6'1, 195lbs and I bought a medium. It's not a very heavy coat, however, it looks great and fits well. The color is a deep army green. I couldn't locate a tag detailing the composition but I'm still pretty satisfied with it!"
4.0,"Loved it but had to return it , the large fake crown thing protruding so far out that it was crushing into the back of my hand."
4.0,"So don't be expecting great quality or anything like that. But it serves the purpose that I bought it for. My only complaint is that their quality control was a little lax, because it had a crease in it when I took it out the box. And the box itself wasn't dented!  Fortunately, I used some weighted items to reform it to a satisfactory condition."
4.0,So comfortable I could  sleep in it!  Love it!
4.0,"Sent  to my niece for birthday present, haven't heard from her yet"
4.0,Love you're look and design.  Had issues getting it to fit with my car key. The ring is too thick.  With some filing I made it work.
4.0,"It’s a little bit bigger than I thought and the backside of it doesn’t mirror the front, the back is smooth but curves up like a bowl on the edges. With that said it is a nice pendant that I honestly don’t plan on taking off very much."
4.0,Very comfortable and great looking
4.0,"These are pretty good sunglasses, comfortable, good at eliminating glare. I bought them to have some reading glasses to use in sunny environments. I normally use glasses with a progressive lens, so going to a sunglasses/bifocal is a bit of a difficult transition .  However I still think they are a good value."
4.0,These are the classics and work perfectly fine. I went whitewater rafting with them and they held up great but didn't feel too bulky or intrusive. I recommend that you give them a try.
4.0,Unique pattern makes this product worth it.  Gives my son something to wear other than a solid color shirt.  Fabric is a bit thin though.
4.0,I like this bag. I just got it yesterday... It's well-made and is perfect for daily use.
4.0,"This shirt fit exactly as expected--I usually wear a small (38"" chest) and this one fit perfect.<br /><br />I have several Asian Mandarin collars on other shirts that I really like. This one is a little different, and feels a bit more like a polo with a popped collar than the others. I prefer the others, but this one fits great so I still enjoy it from time to time. The sleeves are short, which I like, since I normally roll them up one or two times. In hindsight I wish I didn't buy the orange trim version, since it was harder to match colors in a way that looked good with the shorts I have. But it looks good with jeans."
4.0,"Big until washed, then fit is decent"
4.0,"This is a very good pack with lots of room for your gear on a days hunt.The only thing I didn't care for was the way the sternum strap was attached,so I modified it to my likings."
4.0,material thinner than I expected
4.0,I enjoyed the style and quality.<br />The sizing runs a little small.<br />It became a gift to a friend with a smaller frame.<br />He enjoys the shirt very much.
4.0,"These nose rings are the first change for me since my piercing, so keep that in mind with my review. I paid $80 for the post I got my nose pierced with because I wanted to have a back on it. I couldn't believe that most places pierced with no backs so you had to hold your nose ring in showering, coughing etc, or it would blow out! These nose rings are a great value because they do have a flat head on the end so it won't be falling out, so that is a bonus! They are not cheaply made at all. I have the silver one in now and will wear the black with my Harley gear this summer. I do think these are little thicker than the post I had in and a little bigger than I thought they would be, but I have nothing to compare that to as I went from a stud to these rings. I have very sensitive skin so was afraid they would bother me and I haven't had an issue with them at all, yeah! If that changes I will update my review and let you know, but I think it would have happened by now. Great value and quality.<br />Product was supplied at a discount to use for the purpose of this review.<br />This is also, the reason there may not be a &#34;Verified Purchase&#34; on this review.<br />I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.<br />I am not affiliated with the seller or company and make no promises of a good rating while reviewing the product.

4.0,It is ok not so striking as it looks in the picture. In the picture the black and gold stand out but in real look it is damper.
4.0,Very cute summer dress for the price. If you need extra room at the top go up a size. I normally wear a LG on top but am reordering an XL.
4.0,Love the suit once I got it on. But it takes two to get it on.
4.0,"very cute, arrived promptly"
4.0,looked like it had a few scratches on it
4.0,"The idea is great. I would have been happier if the layout of the grid was more standardized and not so willy-nilly. It does work well for holding cables, adapters, etc. However, if you're trying to make a line of adapters fit along one row & all line up, it just doesn't quite work so well. Neat idea that could have been executed better."
4.0,"Very pretty, came in a nice package, love the rose 🌹🌹💐"
4.0,"Love the colors, quality, and fit."
4.0,Love it..SATISFIED customer
4.0,Love this sweater. A  great crowd pleaser.
4.0,I love them they are so comfortable. The only thing is there's  a little more material because I'm not that busty but is not an issue.
4.0,I like it but it is a lot smaller than I expected.
4.0,"It was lost and never recovered in the care of US Post Office which claimed it was delivered. I ordered  another piece of jewelry (same company,) with a different image which did get delivered and it is well made, very colorful, about the size of a quarter and comes with a nice bead chain neck piece."
4.0,"I use this product at work. I wash my hands often, thus using a traditional wristwatch tears up my wrist. This is high quality, and convenient at times when a clock is not around. It does not distract me though like referring to my phone does. Thanks."
4.0,Nice looking belt that goes with my boyfriend's LSU belt buckle perfectly!!
4.0,"Cute top for the price paid.  The XL size sleeves come down to about mid-upper arm so for those of you who are hoping to cover your upper arms, an XL will do that but other sizes may or may  not. I ordered the pink, which though pretty, is slightly lighter than the brighter pink shown."
4.0,Love the sweater but it seems the buttons can easily rip off if not careful.
4.0,I really like this jacket. I wish I would've gotten it sooner before I spent money on another jacket. It fits me  good .<br />The collar is a little too high for my neck. I'm going to tuck it under lol. For under 20 bucks this jacket was a steal.
4.0,Good quality however i ordered age 6-8 kids and they are HUGE. I wear a size 8 womans and they fit me.
4.0,Came as exactly shown.
4.0,"The waterproofing is very questionable, above the rubber part of the boot I used waterproofing spray because when it got wet enough I could feel my sock getting a little wet, but for the $20 I paid these are worth it"
4.0,"This item arrived as expected and I found these socks to be adorable. I love the lacy tops and they have a great no skid bottom so when you wear them with shoes, your don't slip inside. I like that, and it's probably the best feature. These are a tad snug, but they work well and I would get another set"
4.0,"good product, nice color, but a little wide"
4.0,"Very fast delivery from China,  less than 10 days. I bough zebra blouse size S for my daughter, it it a little tight in the shoulders if she moves arms in different directions, but fits OK, and she loves the look. Unfortunately there are some minor problems with sewing, the collar is a little bit uneven, and I am not sure the blouse will last long. But it was a bargain for the price."
4.0,Loved that sweats had pockets and the decorative design (flower) 😊  These sweats were for a little girl size 5T
4.0,I got so many compliments on this dress- it is beautiful. My only concern is that I wear a DD bra and those guys need to be strapped in securely so I needed to wear a shirt underneath to keep them in line and looking good in the dress. I wish the slit was not so wide in the front- more of a peak a boo look than a Hey look at me look- but still love it!!!
4.0,A little more see through then expected. But fit nice. Time to see how they hold up
4.0,"I bought this scarf and received it today. Shipping was fast, and the scarf is large and of good quality. It's a little thin, but it looks nice! It had a bit of a funky smell but it's nothing a good wash won't cure! I recommend this product!"
4.0,great rubber soles
4.0,"Part of the strap came apart after one day, I repaired it with some crazy glue and it's held up.  Nice bracelet, though my son thinks it's a little more girlie with the bling!"
4.0,"i loved the top but the shorts were kind of tight, it’s also because i have thick thighs but it shouldn’t be a problem for those who have skinner legs"
4.0,"These are FUN and are made fairly well.  They were a good, inexpensive price, so I got 2 sets of 10 items each.<br />I enjoy sharing them with others.  I was given some with snowflakes on them, which were also FUN, but more expensive."
4.0,Cute cat earrings!
4.0,"I'm normally a medium in bottoms, but this one is a little large and higher waisted than I thought it would be. Still good quality, just larger than expected."
4.0,"Waist and liner fit fine, but the legs are too long. Yes, I know it is the style, but a 6'4&#34; guy looks weird with shorts that hang below the knee!"
4.0,"Nice fit, great design"
4.0,"Rough cotton like material... however they do not cause discomfort at all. They feel great on and seem like they will last for a while. Be cautious of the size, if you're a twig these will fit great. However someone like me, 5ft and 115 pounds, which is considered heathy, had a hard time with the elastic being too tight on the thighs. To fix that I just stuck the sock over a large object to stretch them out. They fit perfect ever since then! Good item, great price."
4.0,"My husband loves his Timex watch that takes this type of band. He has to wear a watch in his job, but periodically gets it caught on something while working. The stretch band expands and saves his hand or arm from being injured. Unfortunately, sometimes it gets caught and stretches too much to the point the links separate, so we have to replace it. The watch is about 8 years old and I have probably replaced a band 4 times. He broke a band a couple weeks ago. I looked everywhere for a replacement. There are a lot of bands that have the straight end, but very few with the curved end. These are Speidel, which are a good quality band (I am replaying the ""Twist-o-Flex"" ditty from the old commercial in my head right now. ""Put Speidel on your wrist...Twist-Flex""...).  I think they leave a very slight gap between the top/bottom of the watch face and where the band connects...which the original did not have...but I noticed that this makes it much easier to set the watch band pins in place. These bands did not come with extra pins in the package. Which is the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating. I ordered 2 bands and they arrived within 3 days. The price sticker on the package from the manufacturer says $18..so I feel that these are a bargain."
4.0,Glad to get item to replace unit of wife's that shrunk.
4.0,Way. Too long for a woman's petite size.
4.0,This coat is very cute and it fits as I expected. I do prefer the coat to have more of a waistline so I added a matching belt that gives me the look I desire. This coat is also very warm. Nice coat!
4.0,Me gusta la tela suave pero el ajuste de la nariz sigue siendo el detalle en muchos cubrebocas a la larga se quiebra y hace incomodo el cubrebocas
4.0,"It’s a decent dress shirt. It’s thin, so bank on wearing an undershirt with it. The stitching has a few loose ends that needed to be snipped."
4.0,"the price for these was great and i am experimenting with new styles in my art so i decided to buy them. i love them so much and the eye screws being attached already was a lot of help for me.<br />unfortunately, several of them have been painted off center or smudged with a strange color. i think i have figured out an elegant solution to this problem however, so i will still be able to use all of them."
4.0,The dress was fine I just didn't like the sleeve slits.
4.0,"Short on me, have to wear leggings, but fits and looks nice"
4.0,"So far, to seem to be a good surgical cap.. material is a bit thin, let see when washed.."
4.0,Hmmm... it makes me look like I have back fat in some poses/ and all the girls in yoga class too. Unless you're anorexic. Lol. I'm a size 4 and I think it's just the placement of the straps. I'm definitely going to keep it bc I do fluctuate in size throughout the year.
4.0,Girls dress
4.0,Love this dress perfect for they LBD I've always wanted ...this black dress is so versatile and functional can be worn day or night all seasons. It's nice sturdy fabric without being heavy has a lining and fits like a glove.
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend, who is going to use this as a work bag. According to the sizes- we thought it would be a nice sized bag. It came, which was very fast shipping. However, the bag is much smaller. It will still work- but hardly big enough to carry a small lunch bag, maybe one or two books.<br />Never the less- it is made very well. Just on the smaller side."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:72cf1348ab173f68f88edee4169b4e33]] I ordered 2 of these personalized bracelets and absolutely love them. Shipped faster than I expected. Definitely will order from them again!!
4.0,Looks good.  Feels good. Comfortable.
4.0,It fit just right yet I wanted it roomy so it’s good to order a size up your normal size but the fabric is awesome the color is not  WHITE it’s actually on the more cream color
4.0,"We ordered the size 9/10 and it was a little small in the length.  Thank goodness it stretched.  My daughter is 8, weighs about 64 lbs and in the 95% in height for her age.  We wore it for a Christmas dance recital."
4.0,"I would have given it 5 stars, however, the neckline is not as pictured. It is right up against the neck. Still, good quality, comfortable, fits good."
4.0,It's really cute. I wish that the emblem was rhinestone instead of sequence.
4.0,It was nice but I thought it said this is my hallmark Christmas movie watching shirt my eyes read it wrong.
4.0,"Nice sound, feels fine on head.  Do wish you could move the speakers a bit for better fit over the ears."
4.0,My daughter loved her outfit!!! Too cute!
4.0,"Took months to receive, but it's really pretty in person"
4.0,Lab coat worked well for my daughter's play
4.0,"These fit as expected and are comfortable, my wife likes them."
4.0,I was so excited to get this it fit my vision perfectly I opened it up and it had a nice feel to the material. I put it on and the first thing I noticed was that the top was way to tight. I am a size 38-40 D ish and I couldnt hardly breath or move once it was zipped completely. I also ordered an xl. It looked great though!
4.0,"Heavier than I anticipated, but it's because they are thick enough not to dent or bend easily. There's a lot of play with one of the clasps, but it still latches securely. I've sweat on them quite a few times but with a plain water rinse and dry with a towel, they haven't tarnished and retained their shine."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. It's stretchy so if you're in between sizes, size down. I'm 5'2 and wear about an 18 usually. I got an xl and it hits at the bottom of my knee but I could have got a large if I wanted a little more snug fit.  The color was a little off it was more of a brighter red than I was expecting. But it's a nice dress over all"
4.0,"Nice glasses, not the greatest quality, but that reflects in the price. Also, I did receive it with a small nic in the frame."
4.0,Super material. Great pockets. Washed nicely.......but......SO high waisted.  If that is not a big deal for you order these.
4.0,"A bit bigger than I thought/seemed in photo (maybe thumbnail size not pinky nail size), but so pretty.  They do not look cheap.  I do wear stronger backings so they don't fall out/catch in my hair.  Get compliments all the time."
4.0,Great fitting swimsuit. But slightly disappointed with the coloring. The top is peach and the bottoms are pink.
4.0,Shoe is cute but I thought it was a comete buckle closure rather than buckle on top and Velcro to actually close the strap.  Velcro gets dirty and does not last a long for my daughter.  Jist got the shoes and will have to see how these straps holds up.
4.0,Didn't fit.  It was too big
4.0,Fast shipping but not high quality at all
4.0,"For the price, It's Great. The only complaint I had, was it came only packaged in the thin cardboard sleeve and a tight plastic bag where the box was enclosed. In its travels, one of the 9 colors was broken. Not bad considering the lack of protection. The eye shadow did have a slight &#34;cheap&#34; makeup smell at first, but than again, I believe I paid less than $4 for 9 colors... not bad. It stays on all night. I like the color options and the glitter is a nice touch without being too much."
4.0,Nice product. Received it very quickly
4.0,"It isn't a miracle worker, but still cleans very well. Will most likely buy a refill when the time comes."
4.0,"Inexpensive, and they work well.  Nice alternative to masks.  Deducted one star because I can already feel them stretching out.  But at less than $3 each, it's a great deal, even if they don't last."
4.0,"Hard to get on, but do think they relieve the aching. Wore while flying vs Rx sock, since they are even harder to get on. Not as strong as the Rx one, but helped."
4.0,My husband loves a classic fedora style hat and wears several. He likes this one for riding horses with me. It stays on and the brim is wide enough to give him some face shade.
4.0,Bought these for my sister. She loves them so much and matches them to her outfits
4.0,"It was a little entangled when it arrived & took a few minutes with magnification to figure out how to untangle and center the stone. A lot darker than photo, but you can still see the patterns."
4.0,"From the pix, this coat ends above the knee.  And that is what I wanted.  But it is actually extends some 6 to 8 inches below the knee on my 5'9"" frame (mid-calf).  I'll have to try the medium size to see how that fits.  Also worth knowing is that the color is a much darker brown than shown in the photo.  The material seems to be a heavy wool felt. The embroidery is nice.  I'll update after getting the medium.<br /><br />Update, 8 March:  I rec'd a msg from Mythrojan that the 6'2"" and 240 lbs model in the photo is wearing a large.  They did not indicate that there is any difference in length between the Medium and the Large. As a result, I did not order the Medium since I want a coat that ends above the knee.<br /><br />This IS a nice coat.  The seams are good and the material is good.  It is fairly heavy and definitely suitable for cool weather.  Not something you want to wear in summer though.  Just be aware that if you want a coat that ends above the knee, you need to look elsewhere unless you're quite tall."
4.0,"I'm glad I bought a size up, I usually wear large. It fit's nice and it's flattering. I might sew the dress shut I'm afraid it won't stay bottomed throughout a night out but other than that super soft and fairly warm."
4.0,"I love this dress, received lots of compliments, but I should have ordered a size down."
4.0,Fabulous dupe! A little snug in the bust and I’m not a busty lady. I’m generally a small 4-6 and 5’1”. The small fit as expected. Received so many compliments!
4.0,the material is nice
4.0,i should have gotten the large x large is to big but i will still wear it over my swim suit
4.0,About the quality you would expect for the price.
4.0,It was a gift for my mom she loved it even my dad loved it
4.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding.  I really like it but I wore white under garments and by the end of the night, they became pink under garments.  Wash in vinegar before wearing.  The neckline is also not as boat necked as the picture shows but still a good purchase."
4.0,im 6 feet tall and about 155 pounds I got the large and the shorts part fit so well I love it but when I put the top on it kind of makes a camel toe but that could just be because I have a longer torso. over all I really love it! but would of gotten a size up
4.0,It’s okay for a costume party. I feel a little rediculous wearing it otherwise.
4.0,"This does run a bit small so if you want it to be a bit baggy, you'll need to size up. Overall it is a very nice sweater. Be sure to wash it with either tap or cold water and lay flat to dry. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit smaller than I would of liked."
4.0,"It's a cute shirt. I tried to go for a baggy look, so I bought a size up but should have went up two."
4.0,"Suaves, cómodos y buen color, tiene un corte slim<br />Pedi una talla M y llegó L y me gusto, quizás la talla M hubiera sido muy ajustado para mi gusto<br />Lo malo es que no tiene bolsillos traseros"
4.0,"everything about this watch will knock you off your feet with its  beauty and looks. unfortunately, the instructions, the instructions to set the watch are somewhat confusing, not enough info."
4.0,"I loved the dress, the fabric was of good quality but it runs big.  I order the small size, I am 5'4 and 120lbs, but the top of the dress was really big.  Really sad they don't have the x-small size available."
4.0,"This was a nice find and with nice design, very comfy and stylish now I can wear it on a date with my hubby. Only bad side is a little long but I can fold it. Enjoy guys."
4.0,"Purchased for my baby shower. Not in love with the top part of it, but it'll do."
4.0,nice but too thin
4.0,I returned these socks because they were not thick enough for me.  I would now reconsider.  The color is vibrant and fun.
4.0,These look absolutely gorgeous and I LOVE the look of them but I have bad feet so I know I'll need to put an insert in if I plan on wearing them all day ;)
4.0,"Excellent product but the packing was taped to the rubber &#34;its not its very soft and tears&#34;, handle and some damage occurred when it was removed.  Didn't return it but see its a problem to be aware of."
4.0,Pretty Snug but warm and good colors.
4.0,They are really really really heavy but cute!
4.0,"I received the blue/teal color and really like it. The color pairs well with a lot of my current workout apparel. I wore this the other day over my workout tank top and it looked so cute. I love the tie in front and the style it adds. I usually wear a size xsmall and received this in a size small. It was a bit bigger on my, as it has a looser fit. Wearing it with tight workout leggings balanced this look. The shirt is very comfortable, and seems well made."
4.0,I ordered them a size too big . And they where a little too big . Besides that they are great .
4.0,"I wear a 26 and the 3X is just fine. The cloth is a little on the thin side, which is good for warm climates. It is very fragrant, almost vinegary, so somewhat off-putting when you open the package. Definitely gentle washing and lay flat drying, with the material being delicate."
4.0,Well made but a little big.
4.0,"I like these shirt stays since they do not pull out leg hairs and are comfortable to wear for an entire shift.  The clips are strong and sturdy and grab the shirt and sock way better than one of the push through loop style clips (vanguard).<br />One set lasts me 9 months or so, and the only reason I need to change them out is that over time, as the clips on the bottom are exposed to perspiration, they begin to tarnish and transfer a rust-like stain to your skin."
4.0,This bracelet has a 3 layered pattern that covers your entirely wrist nicely.<br />The pattern is stylish and looks great my hand.<br />It is quite light to wear.<br />I would definitely recommend it.
4.0,"The colors, style and texture are great! The only issue are that they are extra long for my toddler. What works is that I washed and they shrunk."
4.0,Great product just too small
4.0,"I have replaced a lot of my leggings with these. I’m 6ft, and find that they are perfect length on me! The fabric is nice and soft, but also compressive/thick enough to hide cellulite (darker colors hide it best). I’m so have a little bit on an issue with camel toe, but that might vary from person to person. I do find that I also have trouble getting the BO smell out of the ones I work out in, but I’m going to test some new detergents on them. Overall I love these leggings and other then some miner drawbacks, would recommend them!"
4.0,I ordered 2 of the bracelets.<br />I give 5 stars for one of them because everything was what I expected.<br />I give 3 stars for the other because the cross was slanted.<br />4 stars is the average of the 2 above.
4.0,Cute collection.
4.0,"One would think it's difficult to actually LOVE a walllet - it's kind of a necessity more than a desired object you might love.  This wallet, however, is the greatest thing since sliced bread (or Betty White, since she actually came first).  Super easy to tuck away regardless of what your wearing.  No big bulky wallet to tote anymore.  It's fire hose material so its gonna last forever - and I'm REALLY ok with that.  Great job Recycled Firefighter! This is a home run for sure!!!"
4.0,"I’m using this jacket for backpacking. It’s awesome—so light and warm and fits very well. I love the color. We’ll see how the fabric holds up but so far, it’s great!"
4.0,could be a pinch larger
4.0,Not great... not bad. Very servicable
4.0,"followed other reviews, im a 14 - 16 and it fit nicely.  good quality"
4.0,"Cute PJ's! The material is very soft.. The fit was nice, until I washed it. It stretched a little and the shirt is a little see thru. I have the navy blue. Overall I like it."
4.0,Bought for Halloween costume (Rosalina from Mario franchise). Were very heavy so I wouldn’t advise prolonged wear but were nice for costume jewelry.
4.0,"It is comfy, fits well and warm<br />Good quality"
4.0,I think it is super cute. I haven't wore it yet bc I just received it. I just hope that it doesn't break or fall off the first time I wear it.🙂
4.0,this is a good product.  there is absolutely no maintenance involved.  it's also well made and is a solid product.
4.0,This dress fits well but was too short to pass as office wear for me.
4.0,"Cute hats, thought it would be a little better quality"
4.0,Cute but fits a little weird. Slit goes up too high and the top part fits odd.
4.0,"works great for my watch it just little big , i wish i could make it more  for the adjustment. I just have small wrist that's all. but work great so far."
4.0,Material is like a bathing suit. But beautiful
4.0,"Good price, good all around."
4.0,"6ft 200lbs muscular build, I wear my regular T-Shirts in Medium for a snug but not super tight fit.  USA M fit me as intended, like a tight compression shirt.  If you don't want a compression shirt and just want this as a dry fit athletic shirt, I would suggestion ordering one size up from your normal T-Shirt size.  I like the way this material feels and how the lines of the shirt look but I had to go with 4/5 stars because the white shirt started fraying at the neck seem after the 2nd wash (the blue and Black seem to be holding up better).  For the price, I am happy with my purchase and may buy more."
4.0,We gave one to a friend; they work well.  Good price for the pair.  I would recommend for normal use.
4.0,Fits great but it does shrink.
4.0,"Very pretty!  I really like these earrings, and I know I'll wear them A LOT.  (Slightly smaller than expected, but very dainty !!!)"
4.0,"The color didn't quite match up to the purse my dad bought her, but considering the price and the fact that it was bought online, it was pretty close. Now my mom has a much more organized way to keep her personal cards and IDs."
4.0,Really good cheap glasses. They conform to the shape of your head and thus aren't crooked
4.0,The swimwear is very lovly but the bra itself is cut very small. I bought the medium and the bra fits like a small. I bought a piece of fabric and enlarged the bra.Apart from that the fabric is very nice.
4.0,I had it for a bit before I had to return it because it was too small and it was very well made and it sucks I had to get rid of it
4.0,"Bought these for my 7 year old to wear under her dresses at school, they are a little big but have shrunk a little bit in the wash, she wears them though and has some room to grow, so it’s better than being too small I guess!"
4.0,Nice but a little warm to use during summer
4.0,Tee was a gift for my sister and she lives it!
4.0,"Cute, soft!"
4.0,These boots are pretty good they provide really nice protection. The only issue is on the left but for some reason the tongue kind of sticks out funny but they still function well. When I say it sticks out funny it kind of bulges out about halfway up and looks kind of weird
4.0,I bought from Zaful when they first started and haaaated it. Everyone is swearing by it so I thought I’d try again. Out of 3 bathing suits I bought this is the only one the fit. Size L. I’m 5’ 8” 172lbs 34C
4.0,"I love it. It is super cute, but really snall. I usually wear xs and u got a snall and it's too small. Sent back for a med. Keeping fingers crossed ."
4.0,"My son likes to play outside rain or shine and plays hard at his daycare. The amount of tread, wear and tear he does these shoes lasted a good bit and still look great even being washed twice."
4.0,"Bought an Xlarge for 1 daughter and it did bot fit. She gave it to her twin who wears a medium and it fits her with some room over but not a lot. She loves it, so it will get use but it runs small so remember that when ordering"
4.0,"Light weight, perfect for spring and summer wear"
4.0,Great quick way to get dressed and feel comfortable even in the heat.
4.0,Shorter than pictured. Quality is good
4.0,"It really is a beautiful dress with the soft lace and true wine color. However, there are loose threads and random bits of elastic sticking out, but this is easy to cut out. I am typically a size 4-6 (athletic built), but ordered a size medium because it was the only one available at the time. I would strongly recommend ordering based on the size chart provided. I still plan on keeping the medium for days I prefer a looser fit, and because it really is just that beautiful!"
4.0,I love this but the fasten hooks are not good.
4.0,Have only wore the pair once thus far.  They fit well and help with the circulation in my legs. Feel thicker than others that I have worn in the past and have yet to wear these in warmer weather.  I hope they breathe well and will find out in the spring.
4.0,Item as pictured. Fast shipping.
4.0,"Awesome fit..it served its one night purpose, and I looked Fabulous in it..."
4.0,"My niece love it , but was a very long time for delivery , day say in 3 days then change to 5 days and finally get there 7 days after , everyday I get a notification sorry your package is not going to be delivery today , I was so mad. But that was the only problem"
4.0,"A little large in the cup, but I need the extra help.  It is very comfortable, and the straps don't slip off my shoulders like my other bra's. I am careful how I wash them though, seems like the outer cover may loosen some. Other than that, they really are my favorite bra."
4.0,hermoso collar
4.0,I knew going into this I would have to have extenders because I have a big neck.  But I didn't think I would need it for almost all of them. I do love that all the necklaces and they are all very cute. But make sure you know the size of your neck before you buy them. Otherwise you're going to be looking for some extra chain to make them fit.
4.0,"Very nice, love the design but I wish it was a better material."
4.0,This dress is so classy and very elegant. I wore it work a few times and received so many compliments!
4.0,Product looks good and arrived in a timely manner
4.0,They are great gloves and very durable. The Price is right too!  They fit true to size for me and I would buy again.
4.0,Works well.. You won't be disappointed for sure.
4.0,I have small wrist so it’s loose on me but it is SOOO CUTE!!
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable. I should have ordered a size small, they are true to size. A little bit short, but very cute and I will be purchasing more! The high waist is a plus."
4.0,"I love this product, but it's not long enough"
4.0,This is so extra but that’s exactly what I was looking for. Love the cool and very comfortable.
4.0,"bigger than expected looks great,, ,wished it would been a little smaller. good color. nice necklace too. gets lots of complements wearing it. love the retro style"
4.0,These earrings are great!  The only thing I'd change is the back post.
4.0,I love it.  I'm 5'4 135 lbs and ordered a medium. I didn't want my butt hanging out. Small would have fit better in chest. Great buy for price.
4.0,Ok they tear easy though. They ate super cute ill give thwm that!
4.0,This charm is beautiful.  Very shiny.  Looks like it costs more than it does. The reason I didn't give 5 star is the size.  It's tiny.  I almost returned it but then I thought it was so pretty.  It goes well with the cross I am wearing so I decided to keep it.
4.0,"I was a little apprehensive about buying clothes online, but the reviews were right! I love this shirt. It looks like it came from J Crew, and it's a really light material-perfect for summer!"
4.0,Not super supportive but cute under a v neck.
4.0,"I received mine about 2 weeks ago so my experience is limited thus far. I had a 1.5 inch diameter tube from my older round umbrella which was just too large and impractical(round doesn't shade well in a small rectangular space) for my small Townhouse deck. This tube fit with a little space to spare. This shape and size are perfect so far. The umbrella is very light. These are both upsides and downsides. It is easy to pull out of the pole and bring inside when bad weather is coming and rather than purchase a cover to protect the color, I just take it down and bring it inside each day when I am done with it. The downside of the light weight is that it easily moves around in a breeze. I am still thinking about how best to anchor it. In general it is a nice umbrella. It covers a good area is flexible in both height and angle and is easily movable. The flex at the top is also nice but provides a ""sail"" for the wind to catch and move it around. My experience so far tells me it is worth the money and I decent umbrella."
4.0,I love this dress except that it is too short waisted.  I didn't keep it
4.0,"My son wanted these shoes so badly and we are not disappointed.  Are they the best shoes you will ever buy for your kids-no, they are not real leather, but they are holding up really well for the money.  The lights are great, the kids love them.  I would definitely buy these again for my son.  They are fun, good quality and arrived earlier than noted."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e8af423ee63145c850739d5f8f6fd660]] I love the faux pearl band. I wear a size M/L band, and it is tight, but should be bearable for a couple of hours. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not five stars"
4.0,Very nice but runs a but big. I usually wear a small and it fit like a large.
4.0,"Dress was nice, shipping took longer than expected. It's a little snug in the chest but otherwise perfect"
4.0,Nice size and great color
4.0,I like the wallet the the zipper keeps coming apart.
4.0,"This dress is just adorable, got it in 2 days, went off the reviews and ordered a (M 8-10) which typically would've fit, exchanging the dress for a small. Im 5'7 weight 145 & wear a 34DD with plenty of curves, the dress is made of a slick feeling material, with a built in padded bra.<br />Pleased with look and feel, just a little loose where the shoulders need to sit."
4.0,Looks good....the band fit well but the box also included a tool for tightening in the event it was too small or too large.....the perfect fit lasted for just a day before it loosed up and now wants to move up the arm from the wrist. I'll probably just live with it; I'll see.
4.0,"I got complimented by many for the dress but it was too loose. I'm 27 inch in waist and 5'2, usually purchase dresses of 6 or 8 in size. I ordered an 8 for this dress and it fit me nicely in the bosom but fr on waist down, it was loose and slightly long which did not flatter my lower limbs."
4.0,Great top for the price!
4.0,I absolutely love this skirt. It is very flowy just as in the picture. The only drawback is it is not very well made at the waistband. It bunches together weirdly and does not really lay smoothly. It is not majorly noticeable but it does take away from the skirt
4.0,Classy in a bulky way. Excellent basic instructions in English.  Down side: digital calendar is very hard to see.  They should ditch the whole digital watch side and make this an analog watch instead.
4.0,Looking for Afrocentric dress that could be worn on different occasions
4.0,"Runs a little small, it's a little tighter than I wanted. I wear it to workout, so I don't have to wear my diamond ring."
4.0,I was hoping it was going to be slightly longer like in the picture.  It is thick and stretchy material.  Wears nice just not what I was hoping for.
4.0,Cute jacket runs a little small
4.0,Maxi material so it shows every bump and crease underneath. A bit thinner than I was expecting. Looks good with a thin belt.
4.0,I LOVE this dress!  I'm 5'9 and about 150lbs.  It fits great except it's PRETTY short.  I will probably wear this in the hot summer months with boy shorts under it...I also will NOT be bending over to pick anything up.
4.0,"This sweater is comfortably warm. It is a little snug, so pulling it over my head is somewhat cumbersome and the sleeves are perhaps a couple inches short of what I would have preferred. My only other complaint is the pockets tend to invert due to the way they are sewn. Still, it is very stylish and slimming. I would probably buy this again, only in a large."
4.0,"Cute-enough basic crop top that's easy to pair with lots of things. Would absolutely recommend wearing a strapless bra, though. The fabric is a bit thin (though not see-through in black). Comfortable. I ordered a Large (I usually wear a M or L) and it was comfortable (maybe a little loose). Overall, cute and a good basic. But definitely requires something under."
4.0,"Be aware that the zipper is not covered, but exposed.  Aside from that, nice and warm hoodie."
4.0,Love the outfit!! It's very comfortable and vibrant colors! The only issue I have is that it's not as lightweight as I thought it would be.
4.0,"I Love this dress!!!!! I'm 5'8&#34;/180Ibs/36DD and I ordered a size 10. I got this dress for a wedding, so I got one size larger than I thought I'd need so I wouldn't have too much cleavage visible. I definitely could have gotten a size 8 and I would have loved the fit more cause its loose on my waist. But again, too much cleavage would have been showing. Super excited to wear this to a spring wedding!!"
4.0,"Normally I wear size 12, had to reorder a 14. The bottom of the 12 fit great but, the top is what runs small. Material does stretch and stays that way, therefore the bottom is a bit larger than I would prefer.  Luv the pattern and style!"
4.0,photo didn't show up well
4.0,The material is a bit on the thinner side but it is a good shirt. I am have a larger bust 5'7&#34; 180lbs and it fits me perfectly with an XL.
4.0,"Product came exactly as described. I love that it's a little smaller than the max size that *can* go in an overhead bin on a plane... it makes me feel like I might be able to find room where a larger carry-on would struggle. I didn't have any problems with the bag tipping over when stopped holding it, as the front legs suspend the bag at a good autonomous angle.<br /><br />The fabric seems really flimsy, especially at the top where the blue handle with a metal center is. I'm a little worried about that handle breaking, but the suitcase survived it's first two-week trip, so we'll see. (1 year later and 10+ airplanes later, the handle is holding strong. Every time I pick it up, the fabric seems to hold strong but does stretch a bit. For the price, I find this acceptable. I added a star to my original 3-star rating since this handle has held up so well.)<br /><br />The bright blue fabric (an older addition, color no longer available 1 year later) of the bag also seems to be a magnet for black oil. Twice I had to plane-side check my bag while flying on a smaller jet, and each time the bag came back with a weird black greasy spot that I am assuming is from the plane. I personally don't care about aesthetics all that much, but it's something other buyers should be aware of.<br /><br />Finally, after using this bag many times over the past year, I really like it. I would recommend it to friends. I like that it's brightly colors, I can find it in baggage claim easily when forced to check it plane-side. The one caveat that I've noticed is that my model does not have a handle on the bottom for insertion into the overhead bin. I pack pretty light, so I'm able to manage with the top and side handle... but it seems intuitive to grab at the bottom, and I really wish they had a handle there. For this reason, I've rated it 4/5 rather that 5/5.<br /><br />Edit 8/13/2018 - suitcase still going strong. seems a magnet for dirt, but I don't care."
4.0,Love the color variety. However a few pair of socks pilled after one wash.
4.0,Ok still could use
4.0,"This was a great purchase. I love the length and the fit. I'm 5'6, 130, so I ordered a small. The sleeves are the perfect length and I like how the sweater fits over my hips. Plan to order this sweater in multiple colors."
4.0,This is really comfy and cute. A little big but still really cute
4.0,soo handy
4.0,"Very good for the cheap price, I keep them in my car for driving. They scratched rather easily but I don't keep them in a case and it's not too noticeable."
4.0,"I love how these socks look. It's hard to find older kids socks that have the cute shoe design, they are mostly made for babies. I am marking down one star for sizing. The description says 0-3 years old. If you bought this for a baby you would be extremely disappointed. I put this up next to my son's Carter's socks that are from 2-4 years and these are a hair bigger than those. My son is 22 months and wears a size 7 shoes for reference. These fit him perfectly right now. They are cute and I love the non-skid bottoms. If the listing gets updated with appropriate sizing I will definitely increase this to a 5 star product because they are legit good socks. I was sent these to test and review, that has no bearing on my rating or review of them, this is my honest opinion."
4.0,I liked the concept for this however the plastic did start tearing fast.
4.0,"At first, thought this dress was a bit see through at the legs. But after wearing in the sun it was totally fine. I am pregnant, so was hoping for side rouching, but there is none it’s just clean seam. Overall it’s a great staple and goes with a lot. I bought the navy."
4.0,"Very good fit and flattering. The lace isn't the best floral, almost looks like 70's style."
4.0,Looks great! Cheaper quality but great value. It serves its purpose.
4.0,"Fits well but I wish it was stretchy. Other than that, it looks good and build quality seems good, so far."
4.0,"I have an authentic Hermes belt and when I compared the two, I had a very hard time finding a difference in them. Good quality"
4.0,Nice design/pattern.  Only problem is one of the edges curls and won't flatten out.
4.0,Love it more than I thought I would. It does run small and is a little tighter on my arms than I would've preferred but still a bit I'll use over and over.
4.0,Bought for a adult.
4.0,"UPDATE: THE pockets, zipper breaks but my son is very rough with  his shorts and zipper, he wears them all the time, he loves the fact that they have pockets. I have fixed the broken zipper and he still wears them. even though they break I would still get more.<br /><br />My son loves these shorts... He is 11 yrs old and I got him a size large. fits him perfect, he is very picky on how things fit and he loves these...  He even told me to get rid of all his other shorts and buy only this kind. I am definitely buying more today! :) I totally recommend these shorts. I will take a picture of my son and post it  here if i can later."
4.0,"We were overall happy with this affordable birthday dress! Colors are very vibrant, fitting is a bit loose. We wished to order a smaller size but it doesn't exactly work like that😂."
4.0,"This necklace is very cute. The chain is sturdy and the diamond is glittery. My problem is that it is a lot smaller in person than it looks in the advertisement. Additionally, the clip is so tiny and slippery that it is extremly challanging to put on or take of by myself. Besides this, it is a good find."
4.0,"The bar with inscription is classy and beautiful. The charm is crowded and brings the overall quality down. I wish they gave you choices. I bought a different Texas charm, a simple silver one with a heart cut out to replace the one they sent. It made the finished piece look sleek, classy and polished. Great product for the price!"
4.0,"Color looked a little different than in the photograph (lighter). Packaging made the coat crumbled, requiring drycleaning beore use. Fit was perfect."
4.0,"My son loves the shoes, and they are definitely very cool. I gave them a 4 because they are a little small..my son is still in a size 7 toddler, but the smallest size they had available was 8.5 toddler, so, I just went ahead and got them. I tried them on him, and they fit with about a half inch between his toes and the tip of the shoe. I would recommend sizing up."
4.0,These are nice except they are pretty large. I cut them and make smaller sizes with silver findings. I dislike the gold one. They look fake and tacky to me.  The ones with the little balls on the ties are too long and was going in my food. Cut those to fit the size of my hand when putting them on
4.0,kind of small but good quality
4.0,"Exactly as advertised, good material."
4.0,Cute and flowy but looks a little big around the hips because of pocket placements
4.0,"Very cute and bold. The only thing that's not so great is that they are pretty cheaply made, which is understable for $13. It's always fun to go with the fad"
4.0,Look exactly like the pictures color and all. Fit just right and was really surprised.
4.0,I liked it but the cap in the middle was about triple the size.  I measured accordingly and ordered a large however it seemed to open for my b/c cup.
4.0,comfortable and no wires! The front zipper was great for after surgery since it was hard to raise my arm.
4.0,"Would be 5 stars if they had belt loops, but I still like them. I have a 28.5"" waist, ordered the size 9 (just in case they shrink). Fit is perfect, material is stretchy, soft, and sturdy, and length is all the way to top of my foot (I'm 5'3""). I didn't realize the bottoms weren't hemmed, I guess they are meant to fray a bit as I've seen with some other jeans."
4.0,Order 2 sizes bigger than pants size was what it took for right size.
4.0,Nice blouse but runs small. May want to reconsider if you have large bustline.
4.0,"If you look at this set up close, you can see that's it's very cheaply made, but from a distance, especially for costumes, it looks really good. The set includes a bracelet and ring as well as the necklace, earrings, and bindi, so it's a very good deal."
4.0,"I absolutely adore this little card holder! The slots are extra awesome to hold checks or a little cash! Just remember it's going to be difficult to pull the cards out of these slots since the cards are held in there well! Get a little piece of tape on the end of the card or something similar that way you have easier access. If you've ever worked retail and watched guests struggle for 10 minutes to get their ID or Credit Card out, then you understand... ha."
4.0,They strap on to your shoes nice and did the job well. One nut did come loose and fell into the epoxy but outside of that the job is done.
4.0,I'm usually a small but I got Medium because I read the measuring guide<br />Colors are not at all dull but not bright where it wouldn't be taken as everyday wear.
4.0,This dress is not too thin and has good hold.  You cannot wear a bra with this cut as the sides are low and the neck straps will not hide your bra.
4.0,Granddaughter liked this cute keepsake. She’s worn it already.
4.0,"Thin material, I would go up a size. Very cute."
4.0,"It's really nice but you have to buy 2-3 sizes up your size, I buy 3XL and I'm somewhat between M-L and it fits me. Good fabric and it's everything I expected."
4.0,"The suite is really cute and made well, but is a bit too big especially in the chest area. I ordered a large and I'm 5'7&#34; and 155 lbs with chest of 34C. However, it's hard to say maybe a medium would've been too small. Ordering online is hard."
4.0,Super cute bracelet!  Love it!
4.0,A bit flimsy.  I wish they were thicker
4.0,"Very well made but the fit is a little ""off"" It doesn't have enough stretch in the abdomen area. It does make you sweat! I would advise to place under clothing instead of top for more support.<br /><br />No factory smell and packaged nicely."
4.0,They are what I wanted tho I noticed one gem was a bit bigger than the others wish all of them were that big. It hasn't fallen out yet and I've had it in for a week or so. Very happy with it staying in as I've had problems with other ones I bought at spencers falling out and loosing the little gems. Glad I bought the set since I have to change the plastic back from time to time anyway. Overall happy with my purchase.
4.0,Really good-looking!
4.0,Great for a cheap pair of sun glasses! Mine are a little blurry and hard to see out of though!
4.0,"The backpack is beautiful, well made and has many zippered pockets to stuff things. My i-Pad, telephone and tons of other things fit<br />into this compact pack. The reason I am returning it is because the straps are wider and heavy. The pack would be light weight with a<br />lighter strap. I'm sure this will be perfect for most people but I'm a little older and it made the pack heavier and not comfortable."
4.0,Great quality shoe shine brushes at a reasonable price that is shipped and arrives in a very formal package which was nice.  Very low bristle loss after repeated uses on shoes.  Highly recommend.
4.0,"This necklace is gorgeous. It did arrive broken though.. the O-ring had come loose and the large part at the bottom was just hanging there.. it was an easy fix, but still annoying. Be advised, they don't seem to put a great deal of care into the way they package this item. With that being said, I won't ever order from this seller again because of the haphazard way it is packaged. Luckily the necklaces beauty makes up for the crap packaging...  I wore this to an event for Rupauls Drag Convention in LA, it was a comedy show. I attended a meet and greet afterwards and every single queen I took a photo with commented on how gorgeous my necklace was. I wore it with a very simple.. almost matronly little black dress (I wanted to be comfy..LOL)  But the necklace made me look so very glamorous, exactly as I'd hoped it would. It was the only piece of jewelry I wore and wanted it to be the centerpiece of my outfit.. and it was.  My advice, wear minimal other jewelry with it.. if any at all. This is a beautiful and bold piece. It will do the talking.<br /><br />Oh, also, let it be known.. I am a bigger girl (size 12-14) and am VERY top heavy (38G) so I typically go for bolder jewelry when I wear it because I am not overwhelmed by chunky pieces and my bosoms typically eat most tamer pieces. This piece is phenomenal if you have a larger bosom that normally dwarfs other jewelry. This is an amazing piece. very pretty.."
4.0,The fabric was a little itchy but I'm sure a wash it would have been better.
4.0,son loves!
4.0,"They are pretty but very bulky at the front, making them fit smaller, as your foot cant get all the way in"
4.0,Love them! They are so soft. Small vertical runs in them up on the thigh area but that's fine by me.
4.0,The Chucks are a little too big.
4.0,"I have a beautiful Coach leather messenger bag which is generous in size and well-crafted, but it is heavier than this bag and therefore not as comfortable to wear all day long when travelling.  I appreciate the lighter weight of this bag which is still roomy enough for an tablet computer, a camera and travel books.  I hope it will be useful for our upcoming trip of three weeks to Italy."
4.0,Shirt is soft and nice. Needs ironing. Necklace is very cheap and looks like plastic. I won't be wearing it.
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter, it is just as advertised, nice piece for a teenager. I would buy it again."
4.0,It’s a very pretty band. Unfortunately I couldn’t get it to fit my wrist comfortably. It’s either too tight or too loose. But that’s just my wrist.
4.0,"Great product, it's just what I hoped it would be. Thanks!!"
4.0,The glasses certainly modified the nigh glare from oncoming headlights. It does not eliminate all glare but did provide me we good results. I will use them for all night driving.
4.0,This vest is lightweight but toasty warm. The zippers run smoothly and there is a snap placket. There are zippers on the sides at the bottom portion which make for comfortable sitting. It is about knee length. The arm holes are wide so you can easily and comfortably wear it over bulky shirts and sweaters. The wine red is beautiful.  The hood does not have a drawstring but stays up. Nice for chilly days.
4.0,So adorable. A little on the nig size but my daughter will grow into and can maybe use it for 2 years:)
4.0,Fits more like a fitted shirt. Not much shoulder room.
4.0,A little bigger than I thought but beautiful
4.0,great product......well received....excellent material.
4.0,Ok. A little small. Tight in the legs but I have big thighs.
4.0,"It is a really cute top. Read the material, it is mostly polyester. Fits comfortably loose, arms fit shorter."
4.0,"Classy watch with a nice wood finish great buy for the price, I would highly recommend it"
4.0,Nice dress. I bought for my daughter. The only problem was that she had too much behind her. This made the dress higher in the back than front.
4.0,"I am busty (32DDD) and I think the top fits great! (It has a lot of stretch - smaller busts will also look great). I thought I would hate the pads - but they are small, and do not leave any funny lines. Overall I am very happy. I bought this top to wear on a trip so that I have more sun coverage, but I want to be able to body surf and play in the waves. This top I think will be perfect. I jumped around, did cartwheels, and the top kept me in place and covered the whole time. Fingers crossed the same holds true in the waves.<br />I do wish it was a little longer, I have a short torso so it is ok - but on a longer torso, it will be short."
4.0,"Nice item, matches the pictures online"
4.0,"It's, alright. Great gloves warms, yet I wish it would be a little tighter, on the hands. The material is excellent, I wish it would be a little tight surface..."
4.0,Gotta love a variety pack!
4.0,I have a lot of Saxx underwear and these are just really tight. I expected tighter but not constricting.
4.0,"I am channeling my inner 60's flower child (yrs, I'm one of THOSE... minus the long, flowing gray hair and a few teeth.  You other refugees from the 60's know what I m speaking of...).  It runs a bit small but I am enjoying having one again.  The company is a pleasure to deal with, too.  They will make sure you are happy with your purchase."
4.0,"Little long, will hem Otherwise PERFECT"
4.0,This strap looks good  and does the job at a nice low price. good deal
4.0,It's a bit big but it's totally beautiful!
4.0,Great for my intended use.
4.0,Fits beautiful.  Got lots of compliments.  Thank you.
4.0,A nice lacy look! Happy with roomy fit!
4.0,"Great accessory for phone was access, could be easier to take off and put on."
4.0,Good belt but a little stiff.
4.0,"Gives the Fitbit a nice elegant look. Easy enough to adjust and remove links. Despite  the overall good review, I had 2 issues with this band.<br /><br />1) I suppose it's a &#34;known&#34; issue for the band to get stuck on the Fitbit. It even came with a link to a YouTube video showing how to remedy that. Do yourself a favor, watch the video so you know ahead of time what the issue is.<br /><br />2) The tool used to adjust and remove links was bent or not completely straight. This added a slight inconvenience to the process."
4.0,The chain Its too short but it is good it has good quality
4.0,"Very nice and well constructed bra made from soft fabric. I wanted a no-fuss bra to wear around the house, but one that had good support and this fit the bill. I'm a 34D; the medium fits well, though there is some bulging at the top. A large would not have been supportive enough though. It has to do more with the lower cut in the front than anything else.<br />The pads help to give a bit of separation, but they are removable. I took them out to gain some more room, especially since the pads are a bit on the thicker side. Even so, since the bra is made from a double layer of fabrics you don't see much if it's cold out. ;-)"
4.0,This dress fit runs very small. I usually wear an XL so that's what I ordered but this I couldn't even fit it over my head. This dress would probably fit a size 10.<br />The seller was great though. They gave me a full refund.
4.0,I loved the fit. Very comfortable and flattering. I have worn them to the gym numerous times and haven't had any issues with sheerness.  Very comparable to name brand store but at a fraction of the cost. Will definitely buy again.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6f33ae474e6f93bab5a14efa84387ab6]] I bought this oyster band to replace the stock bracelet on my Seiko 5 SNXS79.  It looks really good (brushed on the outside, polished on the inside).  It is thinner than I thought it would be (thinner than the stock bracelet I was replacing on the Seiko), but it is definitely a step up. The end links are hollow but the other links are solid (not folded like on the stock Seiko bracelet). The clasp is stamped. Overall, I think it pairs really well with the Seiko SNXS79 and makes it look more expensive than it really is. It is important to note that the end links actually fit the case (there’s been other videos on YouTube where people have tried other bracelets from other manufacturers and have not been able to fit the end links with this case).  Not this one. It fits well. I’m giving it 4 out of 5 because it rattles just a tad."
4.0,"Need dark sunglasses for North Carolina sun and these work well, sometimes too dark in car interior to see seat control, othe wise very satisfactory so far."
4.0,Larger than shown but very good quality
4.0,"Haven't worn them too often and only had for a short amount of time, but they seem pretty great. Like the posts and closure, even if it's a little difficult for me to latch some days. Nice hoops without small backings that easily fall."
4.0,Loved the light weight but sturdy material! Super cute design.  It fit great as well!
4.0,"This top fits as expected. I usually wear a med and like my clothes fitted but not tight, this is slightly loose so if you like you clothes tight I'd say go down a size. Beware that the material will spotlight imperfections, I just wear a spanks tank to smooth everything out."
4.0,They don't slip that parts great they keep your cool it's also great they could just be a little longer so they can go below your gloves and not leave three intches ofskin for sunburn
4.0,"Nice bag, but the only downside are the zippered sections on the front.  I find that they really do not want to open, the zipper sticks and doesn't want to open.  When I persisted and got one side open, I found you really couldn't put anything in there anyway - it's too tight.  As decoration, it adds to the look of the bag, but I was hoping for a usable outside pocket."
4.0,This was a gift and she expressed that she really liked it.  I was very happy with the purchase.
4.0,"They are as dark as described. You can barely see indoors. The frame is a bit cheap and weak. The sunglasses are rather large, so those of you with small faces may want to skip over this."
4.0,Cute rash guard. Runs a little small.
4.0,"I liked the design, colors and fit, I didn't care for the shiny paint of the design. I gave it away."
4.0,"Beautiful color. Received lots of compliments when I wore it. Would have rated it 5 stars except that it was very, very wrinkled when it arrived."
4.0,"These worked great for keeping masks from getting lost. They held up for our week vacation and were comfortable for the kids. I have young toddlers though, and had to have the animal on the smallest setting so the rest of the elastic hung down their back. We could’ve done with half the length and had the same comfort. Overall, we were happy with them!"
4.0,These were comfortable sandals and provided great support. I would buy them again!
4.0,I really liked this sweater but the sleeves were too long on me! I did return it.
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress! The fabric is comfortable and it fits beautifully. Only issue is that the top is a little loose. I had to use a safety pin in order to keep my bra from showing... I'm at 32 C, 125lbs. Might be better suited for women who are smaller in the chest area? Either way, I plan on buying more because it's perfect with the pin (:"
4.0,Really cute for a fit young lady. Goid quality for the price.
4.0,The shirt is cute and stylish. Material is as expected. Do order a size or 2 up though.
4.0,"These are a little more off-white than I was expecting, but they are very sturdy and look like they will hold up for a long time. Fun costume jewelry!"
4.0,QUALITY MATERIAL.  WELL MADE.  JUST DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WHITE TIE.  MORE LIKE A CREAM COLOR.  WOULD HAVE LIKED BRIGHT WHITE TO CONTRAST WITH THE BLACK HOODIE.  DO LIKE IT THOUGH.
4.0,This kurta is really nice and can be worn to work or just casually. The arms are a little tight fitting but other than that I like it a lot.
4.0,Beautiful belt! Be aware that the bow is a brighter white than the elastic. :)
4.0,"I like that it's lightweight and air can circulate through it. If you're looking for style, this may not be the hat for you. If you're looking for a hat that keeps the sun off you while outside, it does that."
4.0,Cute design and decent fabric but sized for a elephant head.  I cut and re-sewed to fit. They are priced lower for a reason.  Still worth $4.
4.0,"For the price, I assumed these would be much thinner or snag. a few months and they are still going strong. Provided, I use them more as thick sock extenders and not true cold weather protection."
4.0,"I can wear either the medium or the large, and in future will always choose large, so there's room for some shrinkage with washing & drying. Great socks, just a bit too pricey for what they are!"
4.0,This is a great decorative piece to spice up your wardrobe! I got plenty of compliments when I wore it!
4.0,These are very warm socks. They keep your lower legs as well as your feet warm. They stayed up without a problem for the most part. I didn't get them wet at all so I don't know if they really do keep your feet drier than other socks or not. I do know that they are exceptionally warm and seem to be very well made. Soft and comfortable are probably the two words that describe them best followed closely by something relating to how they don't fall down.<br />Very good socks!
4.0,"This is a beautiful blouse.  The black is very figure flattering.  I ordered a large which is a size up from my “normal” size in standard brands because I have a 38D chest and I didn’t want this to hug.  It flows perfectly.  The sleeves look a little bit different in person than they do in the photo (at least I thought so.) It’s not a bad thing for me but they are very poofy.  They are ruched and stick out.  The fabric is also exactly as pictured, it’s that textured chiffon like fabric.  It’s lightweight but it is a tiny bit scratchy.  Overall, I am please with this top and can’t wait to wear it out!"
4.0,"Great running pants.  Tight fit and tight waist, but I like them."
4.0,I selected the wrong size.
4.0,Love how it it so interchangable.
4.0,"Extremely fast shipping. Earrings were a little bigger than expected, but still pretty. Not too heavy, but a nice weight to them, they didn't quite touch my collar bone."
4.0,"I loved this dress!! I am a 36D and it just showed too much cleavage for me, especially for work. It is a beautiful, fun dress however."
4.0,They shrunk a size after washing. I would order a size larger next time.
4.0,"The pendant is cute, but not as shiny as I would have liked. But I like the pendant because it is different then anything else out there."
4.0,"Fit and support, concern that the shoe will outlast the laces. Wish a 2nd pair of the matching colored laces were included for the price."
4.0,This necklace arrived well packaged and is large and sturdy enough for frequent wear.  I am very happy with the detail and the sie of it.  The cord is adjustable so you can make it longer or shorter depending on your needs.  I would definitely buy more.
4.0,It's a little baggie under the arms but it's generally good quality for the price point. Ask me again next year.
4.0,These sell separately in the stores for a lot more. This are perfect for kids! The battery lasts a long time too!
4.0,Great product bad seller
4.0,So cute.  I get tons of compliments.  Stitching on one of the straps has just given way but I've had to shoes for months and think they've held up pretty well considering the price
4.0,Really cute just way to big for a newborn.
4.0,"My son is 9 years old, 53&#34; tall and weighs 67 pounds. I decided to buy a Large since most of the reviews said the product was to small for their kids and they were right. The only problem I have with this Jacket is the sleeves must have been made for a monkey or my sons arms are extremely short.<br />The sleeves on this Jacket hang down 7&#34; farther than the bottom of the Jacket so we have to roll them up a few times, other than that it fit perfectly around his body and he was able to zip the hood all the way up.<br />I would suggest you get one of your child's OLD jackets out and see how much longer they are than the Jacket. Because most of my sons old Jackets are only a few inches longer (like the one they have in the picture), NOT 7&#34; or 8&#34; longer."
4.0,"Really great shoes. They fit well, feel really good, and I'm sure they will keep my feet toasty warm when it cold enough to wear them. And they are cute !"
4.0,Looks really nice. Quality isn't bad. I would recommend.
4.0,"I like the smallness of it especially in long driving trips. But because of the size I’m not able to carry all my health cards, and some other items I probably don’t need."
4.0,They are too big but he will grow into them
4.0,"This is awesome. I was surprised that it is a lot bigger than it looks in the picture. I thought it would be really small. It can hold a lot of stuff. It smells like it is real leather. The only thing was that the strap broke when I tried to fasten it. Still, I can still use it, and it is worth the price."
4.0,"Warm and comfy, can't tell much about any product in them but I use lotion with them"
4.0,Goggles are very nice. Will definitely be of use for swimming giving me the ability to see much better. Lightweight and comfortable on your face. Only downfall is they are supposed to be anti fog but moisture still seems to gather on the lenses.
4.0,Not worth  $30 but i do love it
4.0,I like it but small size is like medium size. I ordered small but got medium size shirt which is unexpectable.
4.0,This product was as pictures.  It's nice.  I would like to have it on a little longer chain.
4.0,ordered size 8 but this is a child's sized ring. very cute & well made though.
4.0,Order a size up. Slim fitting in the limbs while some areas of the torso fit normally. Very cute and comfortable for me.
4.0,It was small and because of that I broke the zipper but they wear good gloves.
4.0,G8 item and G8 service
4.0,"Love this band! Only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is that the color is a little different than the picture. It's a warmer brown, I like it, it just wasn't what I was expecting."
4.0,Brighter pink than I thought but do cute
4.0,It's not the very best quality but for the price it is excellent. Unlike the other reviewer who ordered yellow mine came exactly the mustard color that was pictured. For the price this sweater was an excellent purchase.
4.0,"I like the look of it, the color grey works very well, the size is perfect for my needs. I use it as a tote and put my very small cross strap purse inside of it when I need to carry bulky items with me. I read the reviews and saw that it was on the flimsy side and it is. If it's full this isn't so much of a problem but keep that in mind."
4.0,Pretty.  One earring has acrylic insert is not set straight.  Will try to fix.
4.0,"Amazing top! Fits great, and very flattering on! The off the shoulders look is sexy, but still classy! Highly recommend. I will be purchasing another one in a different color!"
4.0,"These compression socks were surprisingly comfortable.  I have had other ones and they were not as comfortable.  I have trouble with my ankles swelling if I am on my feet all day.  These socks helped keep my ankles from swelling and after wearing them for several hours they were still comfortable.  They are not the most fashionable but comfort is more important to me.  They were easy to put on which I have had trouble putting some other ones on.  Overall, these are very good quality compression socks."
4.0,This clutch looks exactly as I thought it would. Perfect for a wedding or any summer event.
4.0,I love the concept of this wallet but it feels very cheaply made. I don't forsee it lasting very long for me.
4.0,"It's a cute shirt and I'm likely keeping it. But, if your bra has any kind of seams or wiring or anything, it will show through very badly. I wore a tanktop under the shirt and still had the issue with the bras. I had to wear a square type of sports bra in order to make it show less of the lines through the shirt."
4.0,Wish it was longer.
4.0,Great pair of earrings for the price.
4.0,"Beautiful and well made, but the smallest size was still too big for me. I am 5'5 and 115 lbs"
4.0,bought 2 for earrings..but way WAY larger and too heavy for that..makes a wonderful necklace as intended and a fun keyring for the guys..
4.0,Fits as expected I've gotten quite a few compliments..only off thing was the color  was more of an orange than red..other than that another good purchase..
4.0,"Wish it had a coin purse slot in it, but it still holds a lot of cards. Bit tight so far, hope it'll stretch some, but so far I like it ok."
4.0,"Bought this dress in navy and wore to a wedding. Paired it with oatmeal colored sweater and nude shoes. I ordered an xl and it fit perfectly. I’m 5’2 and it was perfect tea length, right below knee. I’m pretty busty but the top was a little loose. I placed a safety pin and it was fine. It’s pretty lightweight but not see through or anything. Overall would def consider buying more colors for other occasions"
4.0,"Feel good, nice and soft and breathable but not impressed with the waist band. Not a lot of hug on the band, maybe it’s just me though. Still a great set regardless."
4.0,"Not as ""easy on easy off"" as I was hoping for, but the compression amount is definitely worth it once you have them on. They've helped me out a lot with the pains I get from working on my feet so much."
4.0,"Well made object, just a bit big for me.  Will make a nice gift."
4.0,I bought 3 different prints of this case for gifts. All arrived fast & in perfect condition. The case (top & bottom) is wrapped in soft material. The case is for regular size glasses/sunglasses- it would not work for the oversized sunglasses.
4.0,Good shoulder pads.  Comfortable to wear.  Just the right size - not too big like some are.  They stay in place well.
4.0,Love the keychain but part of it came off early on and unless you have a tiny screw you are unable to fix it.
4.0,"I bought this for work because my clothes lack pockets for the tools I use. I ordered an extra large since that is my usual size, but the vest is rather baggy around the waist and hips, so I probably would have been better with a large. Still, I’m a fan of the vest. It doesn’t trap heat which is great because my job is very physical and I sweat. It has loads of pockets! I’ve lost things temporarily as I try to figure out which pocket they ended up in 😬 The only thing is I wish they used something other than Velcro to close the smaller pockets; the corners of the Velcro patches tend to scratch up my forearms or snag on material."
4.0,"sleeves a bit long for my short arms but love the color, extremely soft fabric"
4.0,These are a little small which I found better for the bottom of your ear as they can be too tight in the cartilage.  The ball for the backing is a little small and can be frustrating but I like them and find the frustration worth it.
4.0,"I really like this dress! I'm just under 5'5"" and about 185lbs and I ordered a large. It's a very flattering dress. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because there are a couple threads under the bust that started raveling already. Other than that I love it!"
4.0,"Ok, sooooo the Shefit is a bit awkward to figure out the first time, but once I learned that I need to use the hooks first, and THEN the zipper, it was easy to get into. I LURVE the wide adjustable band! It doesn't roll even though I'm squishy on the sides (even my best sports bras and my longline bras with boning roll on the band b/c, well, I'm squishy and that's just life). OOH! ALSO!! IT CAME WITH A LINGERIE BAG!!<br /><br />2 criticisms so far are that the shefit has removable pads (which is a PITA come laundry time), and the buckles on the straps tend to pinch when I reach forward. I think that will become less of a problem as I become less squishy on my upper chest, but I the water rower is not as comfy as it could be. The girls are most certainly in jail tho. No bounce at all, LOL"
4.0,Cute fit and shape but see through on breasts
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet but I do need an extender for it as it was too short, but beautiful none the less."
4.0,It’s a little tight but fits nice.
4.0,"Nice dress for the price. It looks like the picture. I’m 5’7 and about 200 pounds. I wear a size 16/18, and I ordered the XL. It fits well. Only quibble is that the skirt is slightly shorter in the back, but I have a big butt so that’s undoubtedly why. It’s not obscenely short, but I can’t bend over far in it. In back it stops about an inch above where my knees bend. In front it grazes the middle of my kneecap."
4.0,"If you're a little bit long in the torso, these ties work pretty well, and there's a pretty good selection of styles.  They are a little wide and I'd like to see long thinner ties, but this one was still pretty nice."
4.0,"Got many compliments, although a little on the tight side.good quality ."
4.0,"I love this shirt! It is handwashable only, which is kind of inconvenient.  I have noticed the underarms stretch and sag as the day goes on, revealing my bra so i have to wear a t shirt underneath."
4.0,"Light and sexy,  comfortable and provides moderate coverage without being a heavy lined cup"
4.0,"I'm really nuts over how attractive this tie.  The colors all work so wonderfully together.  I only gave 4 stars because the lapel pin was made out of a coordinating color, and not the actual tie fabric, so it lacked the red and purple. I look forward to wearing it!"
4.0,"Everything fitted nicely, it’s true to size and with me being tall the pants still almost dragged. I got a lot of compliments."
4.0,I received my earrings today and the were the right color. I was a little disappointed because the part that hangs is very thin. I expected them to be thicker. The picture is deceiving. I do like them however. Not too bold or showy. Got them in time and the price was right. Thank you.
4.0,"Perfect color and fit! Came with a belt but the buttons popped off as soon as I tried to put it on. My only issue is the thin zipper that it comes with, it's a little tough to zip up alone."
4.0,"Lo cómodo y elegante del traje, lo utilicé para el matrimonio de mi hija"
4.0,"some of the feathers broke when I started using it, but aside from that it's okay. It does bend a bit in the plstic bones on it. Wish it was a stronger bamboo but all in all it's great."
4.0,I love the print but expected it to be wider in the thigh area.
4.0,My son really loved it. The print was very tiny though as I expected it to be for a lot of words but it was a great gift.
4.0,Fabric is soft but fits somewhat large.  I purchased a size 8 and they are a little too big for my son.
4.0,Elequeen earrings are very thin but I do love them.
4.0,I should have returned it..my hips wouldnt fit..i order a m...
4.0,"Overall I was pleased with this shirt. The color was beautifully vivid, and it looks very neat. I was a little disappointed that the fabric felt somewhat stiff right out of the bag, from the description I had thought it would be much softer. It did feel better after washing though. I don't know all his information but the recipient usually wears a large."
4.0,I'm 6ft tall and these sit up just above my knees.
4.0,"These are good quality underwear but way too big. I gave them to my mom and she really likes the fit. I purchased a size 8, which is my pant size and they are huge. For reference, I am 5’7 and 148lbs. Next time, I will order a size 6."
4.0,"I love this! But it does run smaller than expected. Although it fits fine, it’s more of a L than XL. Still adorable and I won’t be returning because it’s just perfect 👌🏼"
4.0,"Kinda itchy at first till you wash a handful of times. Not sure the filter does much. But the bands tighten and loosen which is a plus. Honestly in the pandemic world, it’s good enough."
4.0,Could use a bit more cushion. Good arch support.
4.0,"Cute hat, but back velcro straps get stuck in my hair. Maybe my head is too small 🤷‍♀️"
4.0,Good quality. Not too short in length. Material is thick. Has stretch. Color is vibrant and exactly as pictured.
4.0,"It's a beautiful ring. Exactly as pictured. However, I ordered a size 7 (which I received) but it was a half size too small. I checked it with a micrometer and it was a 6.5. So be aware the rings might run small by a half size. Also, the spinner is so smooth, it's hard to tell if the ring is actually spinning."
4.0,Se devolvio
4.0,"I wanted something with guitars on it instead of the plain camp or solid color. The material is nice and it’s fine quality, however it’s way too thick to breathe in being made of a fleece type material. It’s more for winter than all around. I’ll just have to pull it out when the digits sink into singles."
4.0,These are holding up well so far this summer. My son does lots of climbing and running in them and wears them daily.
4.0,"Great product, just a wee bit tight up top"
4.0,Very sturdy and great colors!
4.0,There are a bunch of 'budget' priced shorts out there and it was a stab in the dark choosing these but I was pleasantly surprised on how good they were. In the end I ordered four pairs and one of them had a sewing fault on the inside liner. I contacted Amazon and in two days I had a replacement.<br />Personally I like light weight shorts that are flexible and these fit the bill. Fit is accurate and so far I believe I have made the right choice. Would highly recommend.
4.0,"It is exactly as it is advertised. The belt is rather big so if you are below a men's 38 in the waist you will have to get the belt adjusted. I live in Philly and took it to a shoe repair shop and they charged me five bucks to shorten the belt and re-sow the seam. The three front pockets are not big enough to hold your average smartphone (iPhone with no case maybe) but I am using this in the desert so I wanted a pocket that zipped and the zipper pouch is plenty big enough to fit any smartphone. The front pockets fit a pack of cigarettes perfect. They hold my keys, my lighter, a small pocket knife, and smokes just fine. Their are plenty of rings and buckles to hook carabiners on to carry other stuff. The leather is nice and soft, it seems well made. I am taking it for 8 days in the desert so I will let you know how it holds up."
4.0,Great grandson thought they looked good on mom
4.0,"It is an okay dress, the material is kinda of heavy to feel but not when you put it on, it's strange. I will wear it to the market or shopping but not to go out for the night.  Thanks"
4.0,Its to see time
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty, but when i opened the package, I was a little disappointed at how small they were.  The description says 1.3&#34;, and my thought was that it measured from the top of the earring to bottom.  But the measurement starts at the top of the hook to the bottom.  They are also small in width.  So, yep, small.<br /><br />However, they are still very pretty, so i've decided to keep them.  I'll just have to wear them when my hair is up."
4.0,"I should have looked closer, from the photo they look like cheeckies but these are &#34;granny panties&#34;. That being said, I don't hate them."
4.0,Purchased these to replace the lenses on my Costa Motu glasses.  They fit just fine and weren't too difficult to install.  Love the blue lens look.  Minus one star for the very slight distortion.  Not enough to give me a headache but enough to notice.
4.0,Really cute but returned it. I guess I didn't read the description that it really is a shawl. From the pic it looked more like a jacket and that's what I really wanted.
4.0,"They don't look as pretty in person but they're not that bad. I love the design, size and quality. The price is great too."
4.0,"very nice quality material.  good fit, but just a tad short on sides"
4.0,"Awesome necklace, though the chain wasn't as long as I expected, or long enough to be called long in my opinion."
4.0,"Product was actually a bit longer than I expected it to be. I have a hard time finding tunic-like shirts to wear because they are usually too short for me and fit very awkwardly, but this shirt covers more like a real short dress. Great for leggings. Material is much thinner than appears in the pictures, however."
4.0,Matched well with navy blue pants.  I took off one star as it did not flare at the hips as shown. Was more straight line.  Should have bought size larger for hips but would then be too large in shoulders.
4.0,Contours to your feet
4.0,"Great quality, sturdy material. It was really cute, but I ordered it too small and then had to rerun anyway because the bride chose a different dress for the bridesmaids. Would order again though in a bigger size and maybe a different color."
4.0,wife thinks it's great
4.0,"These are really comfortable, lightweight, and look great! The fit seems to size. I wear a 7.5 or 8 and got these in an 8. The only issue I have is that they are pretty wide in the toe area for me, which is why I rated them 4 stars instead of 5. I would say I have a medium to medium-wide foot so was surprised at how loose these are in the toe box. Still, they are comfy and look really cute on. I had my sister try them out - she's 8 or 8.5 size and they fit her perfectly. I guess if they had half sizes I'd be better off with a 7.5."
4.0,"Love Amanda Jeans. Great fit . Boot cut a little wider than I thought , but very nice!"
4.0,Very floaty and feminine
4.0,Nice quality wallet. My 12 year old loved it.
4.0,"Good if you want to store a few books. Doesn't have many pockets or stretch but it'll get you from A to B. I wish the magnets to keep it closed were stronger but it still a great bag, I use it every day. If you like simplicity, this is for you :)"
4.0,I purchased a large after reading comments to size up. Fits well but I wish it was a tiny bit longer. Sleeves are long which is great but body is a little wider and shorter than I’d hoped for. Super comfy though.
4.0,"This ring is more square than round. The gold on it is the darker fake gold color. I’m sure it’ll rub off soon, and it’ll look like tarnished metal. But I don’t wear it in water at all, to help keep it looking nice longer. The fit is easy enough to adjust to the finger."
4.0,"Nice wolf design, looks great on my ears."
4.0,"Overall I'm really happy with this dress - seems well made. It's not overly tight, so fits appropriately based on their sizing chart - it doesn't have any real stretch so definitely wouldn't size down on it. It was super staticky/clingy when I first got it out of the package, but a wash or two made it less so, so overall I don't think that'd be a long term problem."
4.0,Amazing pendant cheap chain
4.0,Very comfortable. but the size runs a bit larger. I still kept them though.
4.0,"Quality is what you would expect from any Timberland boot, but the toe box is narrower than any other Timberland boot I've ever owned.  I don't wear these as much as I would like because they're just a tad narrow in front, making for a long day on the feet.  They look great, they just don't fit perfectly like the rest of my Timberland footwear in the same size.  For that reason, I'm a bit disappointed in this purchase."
4.0,Beautiful necklace - I just wish the tassel was longer
4.0,"I'm 5'8"" - 150 lbs - size 6 in womens clothing.  These pants were very cropped & the top was way too short & wide in the size M that I ordered.  If the top was even just a few inches longer - it would have made a huge difference, but being short & wide allows for too much air up & under the top.  Otherwise, the material is thick & soft like a baby blanket, which is exactly what I wanted.  I returned these pjs, but could see how others might like them."
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, but did hug the curves.  Would probably be something I would lounge around in rather than something I would wear out.  But loved the color and the feel of the fabric."
4.0,"... the face of the watch is surprisingly small.  I wish the description included a picture of it next to something else (e.g., a quarter) for reference.  The watch is more appropriately sized for a child or lady.<br /><br />Other than that, the watch arrived quickly, works well and does everything I need it to do!"
4.0,"Great quality, case does get scatched easily"
4.0,The color are very contrasting and beautiful. The design is pretty and exactly as pictured. Came with a nice box so you can order it for a gift purposes as well
4.0,It looks cool...something that you can actually use to scare people around. The chainsaw sound is a downer through.
4.0,"FIt true to size, just used the chart! Very soft and warm. Perfect for every day lounge in fall or winter weather. Love the pockets and feel of them, fleece inside feels great. Not the same material quality as some larger name brands but a set I'll wear frequently."
4.0,Fits well and looks good. I'm 5 ' 120lbs. Bought a medium. The skirt is just under my knee but I guess it is work appropriate. Satisifed overall. I would buy again.
4.0,"Nice cardigan but a bit smaller than I like, I just don't dry it."
4.0,These reusable bags are working great for us so far. The mesh is nice and thick and I like that there are several different sizes too. I originally thought these were zippered bags as opposed to drawstring but other than that they have worked well for storing produce etc.
4.0,"The charm has a very good weight to it, which I like. The silver on the back had a few spots, but nothing some jewelery cleaner solution can't take care of. The chain, howerver, was too thick for my liking. I changed the chain and now I am very happy with it. Very good product overall."
4.0,Great packaging. I ordered and use it for training in martial arts as under armor and the seams are thin but I was able to reinforce the sewing for longer use. I still bought several because it is not transparent and good for the price since I am putting hard work in them.
4.0,"Good fleese, not going to be able to wear in all suggested methods bc it's too thick.  Does seem like a warm hat"
4.0,"I love this bathing suit!  We are going on vacation in a month, so I ordered this suit.  It is adorable!  It is made of very good quality fabric, and is well made.  The only problem I had was it was a little too big.  I ordered it to the size chart measurements, and when it got to me, the torso was long, therefore the bust was a little too high.  So I returned it and ordered the other size. I can't wait to debut this suit."
4.0,Bright and beautiful! Many compliments
4.0,Very cute wish it was a little lomger
4.0,"I ordered the same dress in the same size, but 2 different colors - black and navy.  The black dress fits true to size.  The navy dress was too short and had to be returned.  But the dress is comfortable and wears well."
4.0,"After a 3 days without using the watch , you have to set time and date.<br />I’m giving a four star ⭐️ because I have receive 2 compliments."
4.0,These clip and flip sun glasses are very good for the price. My only drawback is I cant use them to shoot as the brace in the middle of the glasses gets in my way shooting. Not the glasses fault.
4.0,"They're great for the price, but 2 came w/ aberrations where the stickers were."
4.0,Super cute but hurt ears
4.0,"It was a gift for a friend who loves to cook.  She was so happy and the quality was great, but you need to be a small person to wear this."
4.0,it's sooooo soft and cute. i got the same color and the same size i ordered. i would recommend it to my friends : )
4.0,"Loved the style of this bag; the color as well.  It appeared to be larger online than in person.  If it had only been a little bigger to accommodate all my stuff, I would have given this 5 stars.  Still wonderful tho!"
4.0,"Love this bathing suit. I don’t really feel confident in the normal low cut bathing suits that I have but I feel extremely confident in this one. The only complaint would be the sticker in the bathing suit bottoms. When I peeled it off there was residue left behind. I washed it three times to try and get it off before I googled a how to. After trying nail polish remover and vinegar, I sprayed Pam cooking spray on it, rubbed it in, and  immediately scrubbed dish soap and hot water on it. Surprisingly it worked!"
4.0,"Love the bracelet, but wish they had smaller sizes."
4.0,"Not bad. The material is okay - comfortable, soft, not too itchy but not amazingly snuggly either.<br />Size-wise, it is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but covers the neck up well enough.<br /><br />What the heck, this is primarily a novelty item that also happens to be a somewhat decent scarf. I'm a Hufflepuff! And my neck is (kinda) comfortable and warm."
4.0,I love this dress. Snagged it for a great price. But had to return it. Too big in the top. bummer. It is a gorgeous dress.
4.0,I received the replacement band and it's working perfectly. Thanks for the quick shipping of the new band it was here in 2 days!
4.0,Loved the length of the bathing suit cover up!
4.0,Gave it a 4 because I had to give it away. It was so large it fell off 10 seconds after I put it on. I do have small wrist but this was at least 8 “ too small for an anklet. At least the other grandmother could wear it.
4.0,"Nice hat. Replaced one snatched off my head at the beach, by a wave. Love the portability. Love the coverage."
4.0,They fit only because I ordered them a size bigger.
4.0,Haven't worn this one too much as I prefer a different band.  It is a little tight even after loosening
4.0,"The wire for the battery was a nuisance but other than that, they were fun to have and use for a concert.  Very light on your face too."
4.0,"The dress fit just as expected, but the pockets do stick out a little bit and make it look like you have wide hips, with hips like mine I don't wear it open but as soon as I get it warn in I'm sure the pockets will not be as noticeable."
4.0,Great material and true to size.
4.0,"Hello I'm Edgar , the product is very good I would recommend because it helps me focus and be more concentrated"
4.0,Looks and feels a little cheaply. Wish there was a little more support in the chest area. I wear a 16/18 and the 20 fits me a little snug but not bad. I'm 5'2 with a longer torso and it fits me length wise. The little skirt thing covers a little of my thighs. It would be nice it it was a little longer. If it holds up I'd buy it again.
4.0,"The lilac color is gorgeous and true to picture!! The lace is lovely. The dress is modest, hitting a couple of inches above the knee and has full coverage on the chest. Please note the dress does not have much stretch. I would pay close attention to the size chart and order your actual size. For reference I am a 32 bust, 27 waist, and 37 hips. The material is thick, worrying about panty/bra lines isn't an issue. That is a huge plus! I love the look of the lace on my skin in the back. The lace itself almost has a faint shimmer to it. It's a beautiful, quality dress.<br /><br />I do have a couple complaints.There was a defect in my lace. It looked like it had snagged on something in production- see image. It wasn't terribly noticeable. Also the zipper does not glide as smoothly as I would like- I hope that will not be an issue in the long run.<br /><br />Overall I consider it a great buy. It would make a fantastic bridesmaid dress for those on a budget. It would also be a lovely option for events. I consider it a versatile dress. Next time I wear it, I think I will toss on a belt to give my waist more definition.<br /><br />I received this item for free or discounted in exchange for my time testing and reviewing it. I give honest feedback, positive and negative, regardless of any kind of discount."
4.0,Good but band is a little short for me
4.0,"These are cute,  the material is a little weird. They do run a little small though.  I wear 9/10 pants and got a large. Could have been more comfortable in a xl. Hopefully they'll be a little softer when I wash them."
4.0,"Wife likes them and was them all of the time.  Since we got more than one color, she coordinates them to her outfit.  We got a multiple of them since she's always leaving them places, so now she spends less time searching for her sun glasses... :)"
4.0,"Super cute, but runs a bit large and no real support for your boobs"
4.0,"These are adorable.  Not sure how well they will hold up, but for this price if you were them for one occasion you are ahead of the game!  Comes in a few other colors also - I got these, the white and the black."
4.0,Super cute! My only objection is that it runs slightly large. Usually I have found that mudpie runs small.... thankfully I didn't size up!
4.0,Love the style. The sizing was larger than the normal 14D Puma.  I have several Puma styles and this one is a bit larger.  Love it overall.  Just need to wear a couple pair of thick socks.
4.0,"This is a really pretty loose dress. If you want it to look like the photo you'll need to wear it with the belt. Without the belt it kinda looks like a nightgown to me.  I'm not a fan of the fabric, its a woven polyester but still has a bit of a stiff hand and I worry it will be super uncomfortable in hot humid Midwest summer.  The fit was a bit small on me, it's not loose but ""fits"". It has a High/Low hemline which is cute but  I am 5'11"" and there is NO WAY anyone over 5'9"" could wear this as a dress. On me, it is just above my crotch in the front and barely covers my bottom in the back. Its a tunic top on me.<br /><br />Overall if you are smaller and shorter this is adorable!"
4.0,Fabric and weight were exactly what i was hoping for. Spent many hours in thrift shops and sporting goods stores looking for one... If you're going for the authentic smuggler look save yourself time and frustration and just buy this one.
4.0,"Really cute sneakers, seems well made  but run small! Definitely size up, my daughter is a size 13/1 so I got a 1 and they were too tight, my younger daughter who is a size 11/12 ended up getting them instead and they fit her perfect with some wiggle room!"
4.0,good value for the quality. You get exactly what you paid for. And the shipping was in a timely fashion as well
4.0,"This sweater seems well made.  It is warm, the stitching looks good, and the fit is good although it seemed to run a little small for size.  I like the pockets.  They are very easy to find without looking for them, yet they do not hang open and snag on anything you walk close to.  The pattern is Realtree camouflage, and looks nicely done.  If I order another, I will order a size larger.  Like I said, it seems to run small for size, and being it is made from cotton there will probably be some shrinkage when laundered.  Overall, it's well made and worth the asking price."
4.0,"Decent fit, however the waist band rolls which is not the most comfortable. The material is nice, but a little thick. Over all a well made pair of capris for exercising in."
4.0,"Nice and soft. Cute graphic. Like the color. Seems to be a quality shirt! Have washed it a number of times and see no pilling, no shrinking or stretching. It's a great tee shirt!"
4.0,"Diseño excelente, lo que no me gusto fue un olor a plástico que se queda en tu muñeca."
4.0,"Girlfriend says they're hot, and she loves them, that's what counts!"
4.0,"I've been looking for winter footwear around the house. I don't like wearing shoes, slippers even. I've been wearing heavy socks but they always seem to be made out of material, even if not wool that make my legs itch. These are so great. Soft soled and so warm and comfy. My foot size is 12-13 depending on what shoes I'm wearing and a large fits just fine."
4.0,Good for gardening
4.0,"I was concerned after reading reviews that said the robe was too long. At 5'5&#34; the XL robe I ordered hits me at mid-calf just as the description says (though not as pictured, alas). I hoped and was happy to learn the zipper on the robe is a two way separating zipper, especially since the robe comes down below the knee. The fleece is soft and warm."
4.0,"Loved it even though it fits tight which i didn't have any issue with. If i went a size up, it would be too big. It complimented my body very well. Went to an all white masquerade party and i received several compliments about it. Loved it."
4.0,"These are great for using a laptop or reading a book in bed.  I am able to lie flat on my back with my laptop on my chest and watch movies or browse the web.  Works good for reading too.  Before I got these I had issues with a pinched nerve in my neck due to so much laptop use with my head propped up with pillows.<br /><br />These glasses are a great value, good product for the price.  They fit over my prescription glasses without issue.  They do weigh a lot, due to the glass prism, but this is unavoidable in this type of product.  I added some stick-on foam nose pads from the drug store for comfort.<br /><br />The field of view is somewhat limited, but works fine for reading or a small laptop screen.  They're not adjustable, so the spacing of the lenses won't be perfect for everyone.  It can cause some eyestrain when used for more than an hour of so.  This isn't a high end product, but it's the best model I've found in this price range.  There is a fully adjustable model that goes for around $100 if you need it."
4.0,Works good so far. Previous bands have fallen apart or caused rash on my wife's wrist.
4.0,"Beautiful! Somewhat see_through. I'm normally a 10/12 and went with the xxL...even that was a bit snug, but it will work! Wish it didnt have a black band, though."
4.0,"I ordered a 7/12-8 1/2.  They shipped a 9-10 likely because they run a bit small.<br />Thus is a well made slipper, very comfy.<br />I would recommend these slippers."
4.0,"Cute shirt but be aware it’s very fitted, would have ordered up if it was available."
4.0,"Was about 5” too long but fits great! I’m 5’4”, ordered a medium, would get small next time for length."
4.0,It hurts the bridge of my nose when wearing it for extended periods. Would recommend putting foam over where the nose is and it looks best w layers of mesh fabric to make it better for a costume. It looked amazing with it!
4.0,"The comfort and easy to breathe mask, made this mask great."
4.0,"Giorgi.Nice and good, mild on neck and beutiful"
4.0,Didn't seem like 30x but magnification is good enough and is surprisingly well made considering the price. Would buy again!
4.0,They are a gift. I hope the person likes them.
4.0,"Warm and cute, some fading so the stars look more gray than white now."
4.0,I ordered the Khaki one in XL and was just as pictured. I love it!! Hides the rolls and perfect for this chilly weather.
4.0,Again another PIECE that is for keeps! Price is unbelievably great!
4.0,The wallet does not have a place for your drivers license. You have to use one of the slots for credit cards..
4.0,Much smaller than expected. About as big as 1st Gen iPad
4.0,Great Quality product . The only complaint it is a bit on the lower rise fit .
4.0,"The gloves came with a Macy's tag, not quite sure what to make of this.<br />The gloves themselves are very good, except for the touchscreen feature which was not one of my reasoning for purchase"
4.0,"Quality, style & price are great!!<br /><br />The one I received (7.8&#34;) was smaller than I expected. The 8&#34; was not listed when I ordered it, which would have been perfect.  The 8.5&#34; listed would have been too loose."
4.0,it's very nice! form fitting and long enough to be able to wear to work
4.0,"Super cute! I'm a solid 7.5, and it fit true to size, though the toe box is reallly wide--much wider than I personally need. Comfortable and didn't need to be broken in."
4.0,"I've got to say I've been pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these sandals are...it did take a bit of &#34;breaking in&#34; but no big deal.  The quality is certainly good, too!"
4.0,"This bathing suit was a bit small in the backside region, not too much to be uncomfortable or exposing, but I agree with the other reviews that it is more than I usual show. The rest of the suit is of good quality although I did remove the pads as it made the lacing sit oddly.<br /><br />Color is as expected and the suit looks good!"
4.0,"Material was great, cut was too long and extra pocket w/ zipper was.... awkward."
4.0,Love the top.  Thought the bottoms were going to be a little darker but overall very cute suite
4.0,"Did the job. Looks nice for the price. Glad I got it to wear with my dress to a wedding. Fits well. (I am a size 12/14, and I wore around my natural waist.)"
4.0,I bought this for my son.  Once he washes and drys it I think it will fit like a dream.  He likes it!  I finally have him in something other than a Carhartt Sweatshirt!.  This is huge.
4.0,It's cute. The only thing is that I've already lost a rhinestone and I've only had it for 2 weeks.
4.0,"Cute, classy and well made but a bit too heavy for me, I find it uncomfortable but I don't like heavy neck jewelry"
4.0,I bought this bag because I like the style of having the chess board in on the outside held by the loop. The loop is a little tight and the bag that holds the chess pieces is a little big however it adequately holds everything and is portable.
4.0,"I recently received my jacket.  It takes a while because these products ship from China.  I followed the chart for sizing, but the jacket was still a little small for me.  I ordered the XXL, and it looks closer to be about a US Large (Maybe a small XL).  When I contacted the company about the issue, they were very generous, timely, and considerate.  I was able to give the jacket to a younger/smaller sibling, and he loves it.  The materials are high quality, and the jacket looks durable.  For the price this is a good value.  Do keep in mind though that these products are more of a slim fit and wide (or bulky) people like me will probably not fit too well in them."
4.0,smaller than I expected but my son loved it so I'm good!
4.0,These are really nice and squat proof but they are tighter in the waist than expected so I would maybe size up
4.0,"Decent material. Really like the color pattern.  This is intended as a long sleeve work shirt for protection when grinding or using metal brushes in a drill, so oversized was desired.  Sleeves are long, really really long, so just rolled them up some. Work shirt so appearance is not important."
4.0,I bough for another use but it was too small for that. Even as a coin purse it is too small. I couldn't fit my hand in it so I would have to dump the coins out every time.
4.0,My little nephew loved this wallet.  Surprisenly enough he still has it.  He alsways watches his Papa and his uncle pull out their wallets so he wanted one of his own.  He loves all things Thomas the Train.
4.0,Would’ve liked it to fit more fitted on the arms but overall good work out top!
4.0,Great fit however the band does slip from time to time when running
4.0,Usually wear a 12...ordered XL and too small. Will give to my daughter.  Seems to be well made. bummed that it is too small.
4.0,My lady likes them BUT need larger wholes in order to add a real chain :(
4.0,"I asked my husband to help me evaluate this ""Bonn 1949"" Men's Stainless Steel Watch. He was pleasantly surprised by how nice this watch turned out to be, especially because it currently sells for well below $50 on Amazon. When he first lifted the lid off the watch box, he was struck by how attractive the watch dial was. We received the watch in the Silver-Blue option (also comes in Black, Black Red, Black-Blue, Black-Gold, and Gold-Black) and the blue dial was especially eye-catching. The dial gives off a stunning sunburst effect when light moves across the surface. The color contrast between the blue and the stainless steel case and bracelet gives the watch a pleasingly stark and modern look. My husband also noted how well balanced the dial looks with the small seconds subdial positioned directly above the 6 o'clock position. The inclusion of a handy calendar date window does not negatively impact the symmetry of the dial. In terms of functionality, this watch has performed and kept time well. My husband really liked that the small seconds hand lands squarely on each marker as it moves around the subdial.<br /><br />The watch is also solidly constructed. All the stainless steel gives it a nice heft without being too heavy. My husband said it wears comfortably and looks terrific on the wrist. The bracelet has a push button fold-over clasp, and opens and closes smoothly. The clasp also has 3 microadjustment positions to help with the sizing. The only negative my husband found was that the watch did not come with a bracelet adjustment tool. He happened to have his own, so he was able to resize the bracelet to fit his wrist. But other purchasers should be advised that without the correct tools, the watch will have to be brought into a watch shop or jewelry store for resizing. All in all though, he considered this a 4.5 star review for this attractive, well-working men's watch."
4.0,"I suggest ordering a size up, I’m a 36C and it was pretty tight I’m the chest area. It was also a bit short in the front but overall it was super cute"
4.0,Does the job. Get complements
4.0,"Beautiful color, exactly as shown in picture for the purple. I love the sweater. I just wish it was made of thicker material to actual be worth more than just layering it over other layers. As it is it's more about fashion than function."
4.0,Cute top. It runs a little small but not bad.
4.0,"Overall the fit was good.  But the chest can sneak open so a pin or a bra that may help.  I like how it looked, but material was a little weird.  All that was good.  What was insane was how wrinkle it was when it came.  I hate ironing.  I tried to steam, I tried to leave in shower.  I even tried getting a little wet.  I had to iron..grrrr.  However I think it just needed the initial iron doesn’t seem to get those everyday wrinkles.  So maybe was a packaging issue."
4.0,"Great looking and fitting hat, matches a lot of my golf shirts."
4.0,"Value for money and not to mention, they are very comfortable."
4.0,"I bought a Rolex Explorer at the Saigon PX in 1969 for $146, and wore it every day for twenty five years.  It served me well and is still a prized possession.<br />After 25 years it had taken a lot of rough use it was showing it.  I took it to an uncle in 1994 who worked for a Rolex dealer.  He completely refreshed it, even better than new.  Since then it had been stored in a safety deposit box, rarely being used.  The value of life has fallen well below the value of a Rolex.  I miss it, but don't want to endanger my life or the watch itself by wearing it these days.<br />The BENYAR watch isn't a Rolex, but for $43 its close enough for me.  I can wear it knowing that the Explorer is safe, in the safe.<br />My only comments are that it is about 25% larger than the Rolex, overall and the bezel is a bit too wide , relative to the diameter of the dial.  The face, case and band are beautiful.  No, not bad at all for $43."
4.0,Nice canvas bag. Fits nice on my shoulder. Only issue I have is straps are stiff
4.0,"Only complaint is the glasses themselves stick out quite a bit on the sides (an inch or so on either side of my son's (normal sized) head. Maybe part of the look but I personally don't love it. He doesn't seem to care though. And the mirror part is just a single strip in the middle, and I was expecting the bottom portion to be that way also from the picture, but I think that was more on me for not looking closely enough. Overall, son loves them and is happy. =)"
4.0,"I needed court shoes for squash, racquetball and pickle ball and was attracted by the price of these shoes. The reviews were also encouraging. It’s early days but I’m pleased with the purchase and service. The fit is fine; good support and grip. I can’t comment on longevity yet, only a few days in, but overall I’m very pleased."
4.0,I really like it but I hate that you can't mix and match the sizes. If you have a big behind you'll probably need a large. Unless you like a plummers crack.
4.0,"The band took forever to ship, like a solid month, and when it arrived, it was the wrong size, 18mm instead of 20mm.  I filed a claim with Amazon and within 24 hours the company got back to me and said &#34;well, it would cost more in return shipping than the item is worth, how about we just refund you the full price of the band instead&#34;, and so that's what they did.  So, I now have a free watch band I can't use :P<br /><br />That said, the band itself (if it could fit) is fantastic! There's no sharp edges, it's super flexible, the band size is very finely adjustable, requiring no specialized tools (just a small flathead screwdriver). I really like that the excess band length is tucked in underneath, rather than flopping outside or held on by some clip.  I also like that the clasp cannot be triggered by side buttons, but instead requires a very specific pull up motion that's not going to happen unintentionally."
4.0,"Very comfortable and attractive. A little light weight. looks good, fits well, functions perfectly."
4.0,"We loved this necklace, it was a great gift. Just be aware that after only wearing about a month one of the links broke."
4.0,These are nice shirts. Quality is ok. Could be a little better. Still for the price its a nice shirt. Definitely keeps you cool. Worth it.
4.0,A little too long but like them
4.0,I love this costume so much but the zipper is so hard to zip on the skirt and the earrings were missing. It’s also not stretchy. Had to return.
4.0,"These were really cool goggles. I have since returned them as the nose bridge is too small for me making it very uncomfortible. There is no way to adjust the peice either, making it very frustrating. I bought some speedo vanquish 2.0 and they come with multiple nose peices. What was really nice about this pair of goggle was the suction around the eyes was comfortible and the strap around the head looked pretty cool. I got the mirrored silver with I was really happy with the craftsmanship on them. They looked like a really cool pair of goggles. Another really nice feature that I probably wont get with the speedo pair was the carrying case. It helps protect the goggles from scratching and makes it really easy to carry and find in a bag. The carrying case also comes with a loophole on one side if you want to strap it to something. I really wosh the nose bridge was adjustable, but if you dont have a large bridge (my glasses bridge size is 18mm) then these will be great for you. Id like to also note these were better priced than the goggles I found at Dick's Sporting Goods. Then again, the ones at Dick's were the same goggles I ended up purchasing here on amazon because they have an adjustable bridge. Happy swimming!"
4.0,A little hot or I would have given 5 stars.
4.0,pockets are a little small for a full size cell phone like note 8
4.0,"This dress fits relatively well, but it was not as loose on the bottom as I expected it to be. The skirt is a little clingy in the back. Also, the ruching on the top makes you look like you are pregnant, even if you are not. It's okay, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
4.0,This arrived on time and as promised.  very pretty - really like them.  Unfortunately I had gotten them to try the different metal as my ears get infected with most metals and these didn't work but they are great otherwise.
4.0,Fits as expected. Love the high slit on the sides. I’m shorter so this isn’t so long that I’m tripping over it. Can’t wait to wear this in the summer time!
4.0,Love the color. But they pinch my nose. Good for the price
4.0,Pretty decent gloves.  The palm padding is pretty bulky but flexes well and doesnt bunch up too bad.  I use these for weight lifting and they work pretty good for that.  They are a bit snug but not too difficult to put on.  Taking them off after sweating is a challange.  They do breath pretty wel but got kinda gross after a hard workout.  I will try them out on a bike as soon as the weather dries up enough for riding.  I expect the same results.  I do like the velcro closure and these dont have any wierd smell or funny feeling material.  These seem well made and they should hold up pretty well to the typical abuse they will be receiving
4.0,"Sleeves are a little short which is somewhat disappointing, and the fit is more snug that pictured, but I feel like the next size would be too big. Very cute print though and fits well enough to keep and wear."
4.0,I did good but after a while it started to smell (and i also washed it regularly so it wouldn’t stink didn’t work) but still good
4.0,"Not really a brown tone, more of a light pink undertone in color. Square is an unique shape to the sunglasses, but, fits well with my rounder face. These are UVA protected which is nice. These are of an average quality, but, are nice for a sunglass rotation to your wardrobe. Overall a very fun pair!"
4.0,Really cute little pin. I gave it to a friend who loves shoes.  Nice quality and cheap price. Looks just like the picture!
4.0,Very nice suit!
4.0,A little big for my 5 year old for baseball but will work. He loves feeling like a &#34;pro&#34; in them.
4.0,"Very nice quality dress, better in person.  Fit too small."
4.0,"We like to have a pair of slip-ons so my so. Can easily put his shoes on.  These were nice and comfortable.  The white part scrapes on over time, so be aware of that."
4.0,They are quite heavy.
4.0,My daughter loves the top. Fits well
4.0,I would of liked the material to have been a little more heavier.
4.0,"Good look and feel. I downed it to a 4 star because the material, although very comfortable, always leaves some material on my skin that I need to shower off. I have washed these at least 10 times by now."
4.0,"The feathers are delicate and some fall off with use, but it is beautiful and comfortable.  Made for a beautiful mask for a costume ball."
4.0,As soon as i got the package i opened it... i was dissapointed because i did not get the color i ordered which was a coral color.<br />i got a color they call Mauve (Mauve-waist line).  i love the shorts i don't love the color i got but its ok.
4.0,Got it to fit in during our company's  &#34;Luau Day&#34;. Comfortable.
4.0,"I love the cut, the lace is soft, and it fits very well. I'm 5'3, around 160 lbs and purchased a medium (I believe). There is no stretch, so listen to the guidelines they give you.<br />The only thing I would have liked is a stretchier fabric, or maybe one that is a little thicker. It's very stiff right now, but after a wash, it may be my new favorite dress."
4.0,"This is very comfortable. It is not, however, a turtleneck. Not even a mock turtle. It is somewhere between a crew neck and a mock turtle. It is so breathable that I have worn mine even in summer. I have had compliments on its appearance. It fits me well enough, although it is not as loose as I had intended. I am likely to order more (already have 2 of them)."
4.0,Runs a bit small but the ring is cute.
4.0,Seems to be made well and cute but ran small
4.0,"This watch is just what I wanted a sleak, comfortable, and accurate time piece. I originalyl had an issue with my first purchase and the vendor immediately corrected the problem with no hesitation."
4.0,They work.  A little small for my glasses so gave them to my wife.
4.0,"I absolutely love it,  it seems very sturdy and it looks exactly like the image. It runs very good, the only thing that I would maybe change is to make the band a little longer, I have pretty small wrists and it still barely fit. Other than that its really just great!"
4.0,"I love this dress, I look for every excuse to wear it. It is comfortable and cute. A tad bit long but no other issues."
4.0,The Ukrainian trident insignia is not quite as clear on the item as it is in the picture. But it works as a tie-clip and I have no complaints about the price.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d4197a7e7b691b7649405a23299028bb]] Beautiful dress, short battery life. My daughter got so many compliments at a family wedding event. She only had the lights on for a total of 2hrs when the battery life shut down so that was a bummer but I'll replace them for the next event and see how it goes. Not sure how I'll wash it to get it clean the wiring looks pretty delicate and there's no way to remove it, maybe a one time use kinda deal😕"
4.0,"Good value for the price. These are truly seamless, nylon, and very stretchy. I bought these for my daughter who is very thin, they fit her great, but seem like they would stretch to fit even me. I can't attest to that, though. The fit stays true throughout the day. The colors are bright and don't seem to fade with washing. A good product, as advertised. She's very happy with them and wants more colors. I do like that there is such a variety available of colors and prints."
4.0,Very nice dress. Fits well. It's great for a party or a dinner or any formal occasion. The lace is soft and comfortable.
4.0,my son love it. His favorite shoes
4.0,Beautiful skirt! The fabric was not quite what I expected but I was not too disappointed as I had read previous reviews prior to my purchase. Wore it to a graduation and received many compliments. Overall I was very pleased!
4.0,SEXY AS HELL!! THE FABRIC IS A BIT SCRATCHY. AND RUNS BIG.
4.0,"Like the coat but I need a 2X, since everything is made in China everything is smaller, I sent it back but I will reorder the coat and get a bigger size"
4.0,"The dress is very pretty , it's fits quite well"
4.0,"Very pretty but a bit smaller than I expected. Great if you have allergies, I've been wearing them for about a week now with no irritation. All in all very cute."
4.0,"I usually wear M but It runs a bit bigger so I exchanged to the S size. Their customer service is excellent, responded to my concern very quick and  were happy to send me another one right the way. The material is a bit loose so pick a size smaller than you normally wear. Does the job well and feel comfortable while I'm doing yoga or Zumba."
4.0,"The mask is beautifully made, and the quality is obvious.  Unfortunately it is a tad smaller than I thought.  Maybe I have a big face, but it felt a little tight.  It's definitely wearable, but would have preferred a little larger.  Hence -1 star just for that.  Otherwise would be 5-star."
4.0,"I was looking for a nice wide, leather belt and this was a great solution. It just ran small and so I had to return it."
4.0,"Seem to be good quality, but they are way too large for my 2.5 yo"
4.0,Thank you! It is just what I wanted and for a good price.
4.0,"Good for the price. So many options. So cute. Cheaply made obviously. Did not irritate my ears or my daughter's.<br /><br />Through the few months the metal has not worn out but I do not expect the ""gold plating"" to last long"
4.0,"Bra is nice, loved the style, but runs really small.  I'm a 34dd and I ordered an xl, but it was extremely snug"
4.0,"Fits well, nice color, lightweight so a little<br />See thru"
4.0,Love it but the pin part bends super easily
4.0,Size appropriate. Lining  inside a  little thin. But OK.
4.0,"I bought this hat a couple of years ago for my husband who has Land Cruisers and loves them.  They are the only vintage 4-wheel drive trucks that he likes.  The hat has been worn so much that he finally broke the back  fastening.  I had to search a lot to find this hat again.  I finally found it and it showed (2) available, so I ordered both.  It was on a big sale which made it even better.  I didn't know when I ordered that they would have to ship from China. They came fairly quickly.  The hat is the same hat, but the insignia is a little different, and more of a ""pasted"" look.  Overall, I am happy to have found this hat!"
4.0,Works great but had to wash them due to plastic smell.
4.0,Pants are high waist fit. True to size. Material is very comfortable.<br />I’d purchase again in different colors.
4.0,"Comfy shoes, a little bigger than I expected. I also thought the front would cover more of the top of my feet. They look better with flair type pants as opposed to straight leg- unless, of course, you want your socks to show."
4.0,The sleeve part is a little tight but overall it fits quite nice. Fun summer top. Definitely worth it for the cheap price.
4.0,Was not as large as it appeared on line but useable.
4.0,This bag is darling.  The zippers seem a little weak and a little sticky.  I'm worried they won't hold up.
4.0,"Delivery took about a week longer than I expected, but the product was well packaged, and is of good quality. Will test the product this weekend when I go hiking.  I am interested to see how strong the belt loop snaps will be.  I will update the post after my hiking trip."
4.0,Very nice chain and overall value...but the lion head pendant is a little too big for the chain.
4.0,The metal part of the keychain quickly discolored.
4.0,"nice quality, great feel !!"
4.0,"I am a sucker for backpacks and messengers. I've been on the hunt for the holy grail for years. I was looking for something a little classier than my leather Kenneth Cole backpack, but I was not willing to sink a lot of money into an expensive laptop briefcase. This fit the bill for the price. Nice looking, artificial leather. Time will tell if it holds up. If I like the style and function, I might invest in a true leather one. Out of the box, it is very stiff. I hope that it flexes up a bit over time. Otherwise, it's a good price and a nice aesthetic."
4.0,I like the product but they don't want to hook into the mask and stay secure
4.0,"Cute necklace, for the price. I have a hard time keeping it turned right side over, but it's cute."
4.0,"It's a little bit less flexible than I would have preferred, but it  has a nice &#34;steam-punk&#34; looks and seems to be made well enough for the price."
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because it came on time and it’s cute but now for me. I am busty and it didn’t look well on me. It is also a little see through.
4.0,"Love this design, its like a tattoo I have.  Just ordered the one made of sterling silver."
4.0,"I love the flare in this skirt and the fit, however the waist did run somewhat large. I will have to take it in before wearing."
4.0,"I love this dress it is so very sexy! Looks amazingly on!  The only thing I'm  it overly pleased about no matter which bra I put on it shows somewhere on the dress.  And when I go braless the front is definitely see through showing the outline of my nipple and my nipple.  So I have to wear pasties.  I am however very well endowed, and I can't buy cute little bras they don't come in 36 K! I wear a size 12 and got the L fit like a glove.  First photo is without a bra and underwear second is with a bra which you just see and leggings."
4.0,I'm 5ft 5in and about 135lbs - these fit PERFECTLY! Great for under dresses~
4.0,"Definitely worth the money! Had to stitch a seem due to it loosening up, but that’s really the only negative thing to say! Super stretchy and very comfortable! I wear a size 12-14 and I’m 5,5. I would advise a petticoat as well to get the full effect! Bought one from the same company..also if you do, make sure it’s tea length as well."
4.0,Very Pretty earring.  I gave 4 stars only because I wish it had a bit more gold.  But they are for a homecoming and they are classy and we are pleased
4.0,"I always purchase In Season screw back earrings for my daughter. These are great, just like the rest."
4.0,Good fit but a bit long.
4.0,They seem good  I haven't used they yet I'm sure they will be fine
4.0,Too big but we know they will be ready to wear in a little bit. Always love these shoes!!
4.0,"Good quality material and is actually a sweatshirt, not thin cotton. Downfall is that it runs small and is short, I usually order a size up in sweatshirt because I like them baggier so I ordered a large in this (usually a M) but it still falls just at my hips and fits snugger like a M would. Color is beautiful (got the plum) but wish I would've gotten an XL now. For reference I'm 5'7, 175lbs and a C cup."
4.0,I have like 20 money clips.  This stay in my pocket most often..
4.0,T-shirt is of very good quality and my subject line is the main reason to submit this review to compliment the company on resolving an error made when my order shipped.
4.0,I like these but should have gone down in a size. Would have liked them even more if I had ordered a medium.
4.0,"For the lesser price, these are just as good as Robeez. My little guy is small for his age. Finding shoes that are not too big (long) can be a challenge. These are great and fit him perfectly in length, but the only reason to not give them 5 stars is that the ankle elastic is a little tight. They left indentations and turned it a little red. I sew, so I think I can very easily cut out the elastic and put in a new piece that is longer. However, if your baby has chubby ankles, just know that they may be tight."
4.0,"I ordered this knowfashionstyle jumper because of it's trendy design. I love the wide leg and draping that creates the illusion of a dress while still wearing pants.<br />The deep green is elegant. The material is nice and even offers a stretch. However, it runs small.<br />I'm a typical 14/16 or XL but ordered an XXL to be safe and still couldn't get it zipped over my 38D chest. The bottom fit my legs but felt tight around my mid section. Even with shapewear I couldn't make it work."
4.0,"Mask are fine nice selection of colors, but they are a little tight fitting for an adult face better fit for a child or pre teen."
4.0,"Per other's recommendations, I ordered a 3X, though I usually fall around a medium.  It was a bit big, but shrank with gentle handwashing.  Looks great.  I really like it!  Just order a couple of sizes larger than normal for it to fit like a tunic."
4.0,"I love these earrings, but they are sooooo big!  Very awkward to wear them."
4.0,"The fabric is very stretchy. That being said, it appears to be printed on white fabric and when it does stretch, rather than seeing saturated color, you see the white background. That is my biggest thing against the dress - areas that are larger (chest/butt) have that whitening effect. I ordered another in a size up to see if it will solve the problem. I'm 5'8/116lb and the the first dress was a small and hit right at the knees. I'm still waiting to receive the medium to see if that solves the problem."
4.0,"Broke with in first week, but felt great and looked awesome."
4.0,"Pros: my husband said it is comfortable, fit well (my husband is 6'5"", and it seems it would fit pretty much any height).<br />Con: kind of bulky for walking around or driving.<br />Got a lot of compliments and laughs, fun costume!"
4.0,"The plastic bridge for the nose is a tiny bit bulky and keeps the glasses a bit too far forward for my taste. The side blinders should really be clear dark plastic or something similar, they completely block your peripheral view, they are great for the beach but not for driving because of this. A little reengineering and these glasses would be amazing..."
4.0,I love these! My only complaint is you can feel the traction dots through the sock. So it feels like you are stepping on bumps.  I even sleep in these because they are so comfy!
4.0,"I am 5'7&#34; 160 lbs, 36D. I purchased size large. The waist hit higher on me that the model, right below my bust and the neck came up a little higher. Also the chest was approaching snug, though not uncomfortable. I did wear a lined bra. Decent quality, especially for the price. I did notice the material on the bottom snagged easily (on my engagement ring in particularly). Light weight and comfortable. So so &#34;attractive&#34; fit for me due to the too high waist, felt it made me look wide/boxy. I would purchase from this seller again. I wore this to a casual outdoor wedding and may not wear again. So the cheap price made this worthwhile."
4.0,Cannot beat the price for three ties. As a teacher I wear ties everyday. I do not want to spend big bucks on ties.  These were a great deal!
4.0,Perfect for carrying my caps around the wasteland.
4.0,The gown is really cute. Looks well made
4.0,a little tight but stretching it out will be okay
4.0,"Really good but bigger than expected.<br />I bought them for a 5 year old, my 9 year old is wearing them."
4.0,Amazing jacket! -a star cause it came with a stain on it. Amazon was willing to give me a new one but i got the stain out so it's all good!
4.0,Works well...only a little leaking around the eyes. But I have a larger than normal head. XXL
4.0,"These leather gloves are extremely comfortable. They are as pictured— soft on the outside and more sturdy on the outside. It also has an adjustable part at the base of the gloves. They do run a tad larger than expected, though, so buy your size or a size down— that would be my recommendation."
4.0,"It's a one-size fit's all type so it's a little big.  However, it's a 'flowy' type item and I will be able to use it anyway"
4.0,"Pros:<br />- Pretty pink color<br />- Good chain length<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Comes in a pouch, not gift box<br />- Ours came with a small scratch<br /><br />Overall: When my wife opened it, she literally said ""Ooh, it's pretty!""  She was unimpressed by the small scratch on it, but it's barely noticeable.  The gold circle on it is rather small, but it's simple."
4.0,Super cute! (Just not crazy about the elastic around the sleeves)
4.0,"It's a cute dress, but it's a cheap material. I wouldn't wear it to work or anywhere extravagant. Going to use it for a beach dress/swim suit cover up."
4.0,cute and my son and husband still wear it proudly!
4.0,Its somewhat small but then again its hard to decide what I wear when it comes in Chinese sizes.
4.0,These are probably going to last a long time. They are comfortable- even for my flat feet.
4.0,"cover up is beautiful and better than expected.  Got many compliments on it on my recent vacation. Only problem I had it's a little bigger than I expected,  Not a problem though, it has a adjustable waist so I made it work. Was delivered sooner than expected and I would buy from again."
4.0,The Estalon Work Gloves are rugged and functional.  I ordered size Medium but these fit more like a size Large.
4.0,Now this is a funny pendant!!! It looks nice but I;m not wearing it. NO.
4.0,Very pretty! Can’t wait to wear in Aruba!
4.0,The underarm cut is a bit deep but the picture accurately showed that...great with heels. Love it.
4.0,Comfy on wrist colors very nice
4.0,Gifted to a friend. Have not seen it in person
4.0,"This apron looks very feminine and I get a lot of compliments on it. My only grievance is that because I'm a massage therapist, sometimes clients' hair will get stuck around a button when I'm leaning forward from the front of the table to massage their lower backs. I'm 5'5&#34; and 115 lbs, ordered a small, and it's just a little bit big on me."
4.0,Gave this to my 12 yo niece who liked the length and light weight.
4.0,Its okay. Looks its price
4.0,"Love this top, but straps are a bit long."
4.0,Very sexy shirt dress. Buttons are fake. The elastic on the shoulders is tight. Looks amazing!
4.0,"While the capris are soft and fit as expected, the full-length leggings are a bit tight and the fabric seems a bit more...plastic-like. However, for the price, I think it was a decent buy!"
4.0,"Fits like a large not xx large, thinner than I liked."
4.0,"These are very good for the price , 3 different lenses and a good case. FYI the frame color is more like a matte teal color that a gray"
4.0,I like that the bag appears durable and water resistant.  It holds i's shape well and allows for the laptop to be protected.  Wish it was a little more expandable but all and all can hold a good bit of additional items to the PC.  Has worked well for fitting under the airplane seat during travel.
4.0,"Wore this as my grad dress. I really love it and the design. I think the material is fine, but the only issue I had was adjusting the straps. When trying to adjust them, the whole string fell apart and I had to figure out how to tie it back myself. It’s also pretty low for me, but that’s nothing with some fabric tape"
4.0,It took a long time to get it.  But my wife liked it she's happy I'm happy
4.0,"Absolutely adorable addition to baby girls growing shoe collection. My only issue with these is that there is absolutely no traction on the bottom of the soles and I'm buying shoes for my baby that is just learning to walk. This will, undoubtedly, cause some spills. Otherwise, adorable, the fit is slightly big (size 5 for my 13m old) which is good in this case, as I was looking for shoes for this summer."
4.0,"I purchased these as a gift for someone who likes Celtic designs and jewelry.  They look really nice.  The silver has that slightly greyed down look which makes them look almost pewter like, which I personally like.  They are a little smaller than I thought they would be, which is why I gave them 4 stars.  But, they are very nice looking."
4.0,It's a headband.  'nuff said.  It does it's job.
4.0,Love this rung..very pretty.
4.0,"According to the chart, I am a medium, which is what I ordered.<br />It fit well on my waist, but the armpit area sticks out a little even though it fits well on my bust. Also, the fabric is very thin so it's a bit see-through.<br />That being said, I was pleased with how soft and comfortable it is. And who doesn't love a dress with pockets!?"
4.0,This product would’ve gotten 5 stars instead of 4 but I’ve had two pair of pants rip in the zipper area (which I had to fix) and 2 separate pairs has lost their original button. But it is still a great pair of work pants!
4.0,"Really liked the blouse, but exposed way too much cleavage for me. I wear a 38DD and the top fit around my ribcage nicely but the top left very little to the imagination. The length of the top was a little shorter than I prefer but went down past the top of my pants. I returned as I was wanting this top for work and it just showed too much."
4.0,"The description is the same that product that's arrived, I like it!"
4.0,Cute shirt that me and my friend bought to dress up as referees for a Super Bowl party. Looked pretty cute though admittedly they are not the best quality around. Awesome for the price though and worked for what we needed them for.
4.0,I’m not too positive that I got the right size. They’re all so beautiful though. The ones on the right are my old 14mm. The left is the new. I honestly can’t tell.
4.0,Big enough but not oversized or heavy.  Love the subtle neutral leopard pattern.
4.0,The dress fit perfectly. It hugged all the right spots. I am giving it 4 stars b/c the seam down the back was not put together very well. Thankfully I can sew and was able to ran a heavier stitch down the back.
4.0,Surprisingly warm/hot- they don't breathe considering how thin they are.  The colors are REALLY bright.
4.0,Nice fit. The fabric felt a bit stiff and scratchy at first but was fine after being washed.
4.0,It's more like a wrap than a shirt.
4.0,Wanted more of a half top look.. Lil long n front
4.0,very pleased.  good variety of beads and looks great on.  would have preferred black leather but like the brown too.
4.0,Easy to adjust nice fitting only notice it's starting to tarnish a little on the wrist.
4.0,Needs some velcro for the shoulders
4.0,"I would've given 5 stars.<br />I was expecting to receive the exact dress as featured but received another dress (the exact style but on different color) of another dress I ordered.<br />overall, I like the summer dress, fit as expected and comfortable."
4.0,"I ordered a medium but had to alter it a bit at the skirt, it kind of flops down. Taking it in actually made the skirt look more high on my body like the characters do in the series. The tiara is terrible however, presses way to hard on my head and doesn't bend to fit your head. Everything else was great"
4.0,18 inch chain with 2 inch extender and looks great
4.0,"Beautiful & for the price it's worth it.  First one I wore broke in 2 days. But for the price, it was worth the purchase."
4.0,Does the job the girls don't escape:) but is a bit on the small size but not so much to be unusable
4.0,came on time and is very good for the price.. Fit slightly big so if your child is small built you should buy one size down.. Other than that good material and looks like picture would recommend
4.0,This is a nice purse but it's a little too small for me to use.
4.0,GREAT value for a variety of pocket squares. There are some my husband doens't prefer but he wears most of them. I think it's a great value for what you get. NICE NICE quality.
4.0,I like it. Although the color I picked was displayed as the picture I got mine in blue
4.0,"I love that this sweatshirt not only fits well and has a packet but has a pressed in pattern on the material. This allows you to say a solid color but look even better! :) I do wish the sleeves were lined as they can be a little itchy in some cases. However, I did buy another color and would totally buy again."
4.0,Very cute but too tight. Doesn’t fit that the other dresses from this vendor. I sent it back.
4.0,"Bought for my husband, nice shirt, good fit"
4.0,"It is a comfortable jacket that washes well. It has a nice hood, and is decently warm. All in all, a very good basic hooded jacket for casual daily wear."
4.0,The white is see thru.
4.0,"Nice little pendant. Perfect size with just the right amount of sparkle in two of E.B.'s favourite colours (pinkender & yeller). Some people see it as a molecule, while others instantly say honeycomb. It's totally trixie and anything but trite, so that's why we like. :-)"
4.0,Loved this vest.  It was a little small around the hip area but a medium material and perfect for the summer!  I love it!
4.0,Definitely a cheaper material than the original ones that came with my belt (I lost all of them) but they do the job just fine.
4.0,They're light on the ear.  And pretty.
4.0,Received as described and very quickly
4.0,"this runs slightly big but it's very cute. I love the French bulldog. It is not flexible either. I bought this for my right ring finger which is a 6 but I can only really wear it on my thumb. it looks fine on my thumb though. I have to say, it's not the most comfortable ring, its just really hard, but its worth wearing for a few hours to an event."
4.0,"they look cool, although at the edge of large for my smaller face.  i like them and so does my husband, so tha'ts always good.  nh"
4.0,"This is my third purchase of this Red Celtic Thor necklace. I brought one for myself, one for my man and now a new one also for my man who lost the first one. Necklace looks regal and packs a mighty energy source to it. Great for those in love with Thor Hammers"
4.0,"When I first purchased these shorts I almost sent them back. They appeared to have a strange unflattering fit. After looking at the shorts I realized that it is the mesh lining that was causing the fit to be a mess! I removed the mesh lining and the shorts looked phenomenal. The fabric did bleed a bit when sunscreen was applied to my legs! Overall, great purchase!"
4.0,Very cute my daughter loved them!
4.0,They are roomy in the back and with a few washes they will be finr
4.0,Great quality - runs a size large ( hence 4 stars)
4.0,"I like it very much, I’m usually wearing it under a loose Tshirt, its very comfort but because of the material made of it don’t get smelly super fast"
4.0,The tank was printed well on quality material. The only downside here was the the print did not glow as brightly as desired in a black light. Would recommend though!
4.0,Good purchase - slightly larger than I wanted but wear well and look attractive and not cheesy
4.0,"I love the necklace, though it is quite a bit shorter on me than pictures."
4.0,My wife purchased both this one and the black one. The black fit perfectly but this one ran smaller.
4.0,They were exactly wanted and arrived in very good time.
4.0,"i like the color of the watch the two things i dont like is, the clasp that closes the watch snags alot..  The other thing is its sometimes hard to see the watch because of the glare...  maybe if it had a darker background it wouldnt be so hard...  Other than that, its cute and pretty."
4.0,decent shorts for the price. i would buy more.
4.0,Beautiful dress and material. Too big and too long
4.0,The ring seems to stretch out since it’s so thin. Would have ordered a wider band had I know. Very comfortable ring.
4.0,Looks so much better on and is perfect for a corporate look with a blazer or a beautiful dress for an outdoor function. Dress it up with pumps or a more casual look with a wedge. I love it!
4.0,"I just put these on. Pretty decent quality. Feels good on my calves. I ordered large, feel a little large in the foot. I generally wear 10.5 US Men's size shoes. Wish I would have known the size chart before ordering.<br /><br />According to the tag, sizing is as follows:<br />Small Men's 6, Women's 4-7<br />Med Men's 7-11, Women's 8-13<br />Large Men's 12-15+, Women's 14-15+<br /><br />I would want to try Medium next time for my 10.5 feet."
4.0,I really like these. The print is cute. The stiching is kind of strange around the waist so I will be covering  that part up with a shirt that the only downside.
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress. I would say it runs a little long though. I ordered this for my youngest daughter but it fit better on my oldest, it was still a little long on her though even with heels. It's really cute though, we like it."
4.0,"Very nice robe, fits very well and super cool style and design. I wish it had a double ended zipper then I’d love it even more. I like the color but it is not exactly as depicted. There is no purple in the robe as shown in the photos. Overall, I really love this robe-lightweight, super cozy and comfortable and quite fashiony. Love the pockets and their styling. I’ll be purchasing one for my mom as well soon."
4.0,My wife loves this Dirndl.  She would wear it everyday if it weren't for the need to be dry-cleaned.
4.0,The earrings have a beautiful sparkle that can't be capture in pictures and they come in adorable macaroon cases. The back of the crystal is coated in a silvery paint instead of being translucent throughout but it's not very noticeable. The earrings juts out and tends to snag my hair. The back seems to slip a bit so I have to check it every once in a while throughout the day to push them back in so the earring doesn't fall out. I've lost one earring already because of this. I've had no problems with it irritating my ears or oxidizing as of yet.
4.0,Very soft and true to size. My daughter absolutely loved this robe and the matching one for her doll
4.0,Wallet Is a little too bulky for my liking.
4.0,These are very cute they fit my piercing snug which I actually like but if you have a thicker piercing I would not suggest buying these.
4.0,I was worried about ordering novelty socks online - I thought they might be a cheap material but these are a nice quality & not thin at all. My husband wears a size 10 & they fit him just fine.
4.0,Husband loves these for travel.
4.0,beautiful and very shiny
4.0,Love the kimono.
4.0,Great headband... for better results I would personally double up before workouts
4.0,"I think I will be ordering more colors :)<br />My first pleated skirt and I am loving it to the core. Its a perfect office wear, party wear, casual wear. Its little bit over the knees, depends where you tuck it.<br /><br />Getting so many compliments alreaaaddyyy"
4.0,Great boot for the price. No complaints here
4.0,Just received them and it's exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"I love the style of this dress and the fit is nearly perfect. Im 5 ft, 108 lbs, ordered a size small. The color is as shown in the picture. My only dislike is that the collar kind of stood up and poked me in the face."
4.0,I live the material and the color. I should have gone up a size but it’s real sexy!
4.0,I own a lot of Subaru products and needed a winter hat. I bought this hat since I thought it would fit with my car. Though the front STI part is very well done. I dislike the Subaru logo that you can see in the picture. Its not a solid yellow or bright yellow that makes it look good. It kind of looks like the same color that you would get after leaving papers sit in water for a long period of time. That type of yellow is what youll get. Other than that I think its a great hat and comfortable.
4.0,People don't believe it's real because of the size. I loved it. My wife thought it too big to wear in the streets
4.0,I like the fact that it is easy to use and comfy.
4.0,"They only &#34;fit as expected&#34; because I expected them to be small and from reading the reviews, I ordered way way larger than what I normally wear! I usually fit a Medium underwear, (6-8 size jeans) but I ordered an XXL in these and they fit perfect. They are really soft and comfortable. I like the colors and so far I am happy with them. They come up in the front just enough to hide the Csection scar. Probably want to keep them out of the dryer as much as you can as the cotton liner and folded edges will prob start pulling apart over time. Happy so far."
4.0,Great bright orange color. Ruffle LSU’s nicely. Fabric a little on the thin side but nice
4.0,I love Bob Marley as the man and the music legend so I enjoy wearing his memorabilia. The shirt feels and looks great on.
4.0,"These pants are super comfortable but I had to deduct one star because they are most definitely NOT capris on my 5'4&quot; frame. I'm usually a medium in US sizes so I ordered an XL since they were coming from CHINA.  Especially with something stretchy like this I'd rather some wiggle room, that being said they do sag when I walk.  The pants are thin enough to see through if you hold them up to the light but as long as you have dark underwear on, that shouldn't be a problem in Yoga class.  I actually really liked the thinness when working out b/c it keeps me cool.<br /><br />I did receive these Yoga Capris Pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I myself read reviews and take them into account when making purchases so I never filter or hyperinflate my feedback. I will continue to update this feedback if my experience with these Yoga Capris Pants significantly, I learn any new tips/tricks, or have anything else significant to add to the conversation. Thank you!"
4.0,Wife likes it. Not sheer at all.
4.0,Great vans but it's actually a lighter tone grey.
4.0,"Yes, it is very dainty.  I think my 5 year old granddaughter will love it."
4.0,"Frye boots always take a little bit to break in, and these are no exception. They're attractive for sure, but aren't the most comfortable Fryes I own. They rub against my foot after walking in them for longer stretches of time. However, they are super sexy and I love the straps."
4.0,"I like this suit even more in person than I thought I would. The high neck is great, the bottoms fit well (not too cheeky) and the fabric is nice. I used the size chart; I am typically a medium top and size 8 pants and the fit is good."
4.0,Actually fit really well. Only complaint if I had to was little excess glue on the sole to shoe line.
4.0,Gave it one less star because the blue one has softer material.
4.0,Works reasonably well for hot yoga… The collar doesn’t get caught up on your chin if you’re doing for head to knee type exercises
4.0,I ordered these while on deployment. I can't believe they made it through the rough terrain and wet days and snow.
4.0,"A little small, but great quality!"
4.0,I have this as a Christmas present. Color was same as picture. Very soft. The fit is a little tight. Just get one size bigger and you like this item
4.0,"This outfit was really cute and it's true to size. Im 5'3 and weight 116 lbs, the small fit perfect! Cotton material like"
4.0,Product seems to be built well
4.0,Small!!!  Size up!
4.0,I like the shape of it. I use it as an undetshirt. Very stylish.
4.0,"I bought a bigger size so I could get it prime and send it back if I hated it. It was very nicely made, but it was NOT the one in the picture"
4.0,"Nice earrings but on the small size, looked bigger in the picture."
4.0,I just received the shirt so haven’t worn it yet but it looks really nice. If it holds up good after wash and wear I plan to order in different color.  Large fits me perfectly. I’m 5’7” and 144.
4.0,Holds up well to washing. Great for a sweaty qorkout.
4.0,This is exactly what I was looking for. Fits as described. Adustments almost the entire length of the belt. The metal rings popped off of the adjustment location used after a week of wear under labor working conditions. Still holding the adjustment without the metal rings though. Overall good deal for the price. I purchased a second belt for non work wear. Shipping was slow without prime.
4.0,Darling dress.
4.0,Works great after 2 hours of bending and shaping.It's not as easy as some people said it is but it worked and looks great.Would recommend.
4.0,"The fit and the color is perfect. The fabric is light and breathable, it won't wear you down or make you feel too hot and uncomfortable. The sweater is true size and the quality of the material is good. The only thing I did not like is that it is prone to shrink in the dryer, so definitely follow the wash instructions on the tag or air dry. Otherwise, this is a great sweater and perfect for work or semi-casual events."
4.0,"Very large fit, and the fabric was weird. Tag says it was cotton and linen, but it felt like a thin rayon. Haven’t tried to wash it yet."
4.0,"I bought these for my little girl, they fit her well. She absolutely loved the color and the sparkles. The sparkles are a little hard to clean but overall these were a good buy for us!"
4.0,I purchased this for my big sunglasses and they do fit. Very practical and definitely worth the few bucks.
4.0,This item is cute but way too large for my face. It’s so big that I have to push it down out of my eyes constantly. I think it was meant for a large man.
4.0,"I like that these are super lightweight. The silver is shiny, which makes them look nice. They were bigger than I imagined, but not terribly big."
4.0,"This swimsuit looks like the picture, is pretty good quality for the price you're paying, but was too lose on me. I am 5'3"", 100 lbs, pretty flat chested, and I bought a small. Both the top and the bottoms (but more so the top) just fit kind of lose. I could have made it work or made minor adjustments but it wasn't really worth it to me for the price. The bottoms were were pretty cheeky but i like that look, and the top was cute too. If you're a little bit bigger than me i'm sure you'll love this suit."
4.0,I thought this shirt was cotton but it isn't. Graphics on shirt looks exactly as expected. I love it!
4.0,"Cute hoodie. Not exactly a t-shirt, but certainly not a sweatshirt. The camo part comes with a fadded look to it. Hard to tell that in the pictures. I'd say true to size. I'm 5'6"" and 160 -165 lbs and the large fit good without being snug in the mid section. I was even wearing a tank top underneath it. The overall length and sleeve length is good. Washed and dried on delicate with no issues. Would be willing to buy more clothing from this brand again."
4.0,Very very form fitting.  I should have gotten 1-2 sizes bigger. Well made.
4.0,"Compre estos guantes para usarlos en el trabajo ya que constantemente tengo que entrar a un cooler y me mantienen las manos calientes, los recomiendo"
4.0,We gave this to our one month old and he has loved it ever since. I've never seen a baby take to anything like this before. It quiets him so quickly. My older ones love to use it for imaginative play when the baby isn't using it. Only negative thing is that it had a hole in it a month after we got it. It tears pretty easily. I'm not interested in paying $15 for a product that keeps ripping within a few months of playing with. At least we know it's loved on!
4.0,Its pretty and fits well.  The pockets are a fantastic addition.  It is not flattering.  My wife thinks she looks like a rectangle when she wears it.  She says it is comfortable and true to size.
4.0,"My review is for the Color: Orange<br /><br />I really wanted to love these! Unfortunately, they are too small for my face. In my opinion, these are better suited for petite women or teens, tweens, and kids. They look super cute on my 4-year-old and 11-year-old.<br /><br />The earpieces only open up to 3 inches naturally but can open up to 4.5 inches. The width between the earpieces isn't enough to fit my head without feeling uncomfortable. My temples are 5 inches apart so if your head is like mine, these won't fit.<br /><br />Each lens is about 2 inches wide and the total width of these sunglasses are only about 4.5 inches. The metal frame is delicate. You wouldn't want to throw these in your purse loosely. The lenses do attract fingerprints and smudges but that is typical of mirrored lenses. While that might be a concern for some, it doesn't bother me. It's very easy to clean.<br /><br />Ratings (Out of five stars):<br />Material Quality: ★★★★<br />Comfort: ★★★<br />UV Protection: ★★★★★<br />Style: ★★★★<br />Value: ★★★★★<br /><br />Overall rating: 21 out of 25 stars / 4.2 Star Average<br /><br />📌SUMMARY: Overall, these were too small for me. I felt like the product listing could more accurately market these towards petite women or teens, tweens, and kids. They look super cute on my 4-year-old and 11-year-old.<br /><br />Photo Notes: My camera has a hard time picking up the sunset orange. These look more orange and less golden than my photos show. The product listing photos are more accurate.<br />__________________________________________________________<br /><br />I received this product complimentary from SojoS for quality testing purposes.

4.0,"I searched for ""Made in the USA"" and this product showed up.  I like them and they work well.  However, when I opened the package I saw they were made in Vietnam."
4.0,Love the socks but they are a little tight
4.0,"I love being able to support the Hotspurs, with active gear.  The hat is reversible, which is nice.  My only complaint, is the hat seems to slide up, even when stationary while wearing it, so I find myself adjusting it often, otherwise, I would give it 5 starts."
4.0,"This necklace is really cute. A little bigger and heavier than I expected, but I'm not real good at reading product descriptions when I like what I see!"
4.0,Gloves are good quality for price. I would say they only fit a small to medium hand size. They are great for cooking/cleaning or minor medical needs. Would definitely order again.
4.0,Don't know yet how it'll hold up but it seems sturdy and my son says it looks cool.
4.0,shipped on time and very good
4.0,"This shirt is very cute on my little guy. Its a little longer in the waist, but it fits just fine. Holds up well in the wash."
4.0,"Beautiful beach hat! I was really happy with the vivid colors of the hat and the quality of the materials. I love how the hat is not floppy like most beach hats - but has some sort of firmness to it so it's not such a weird floppy thing hanging off your head. I have the blue colored one and it's just super cute! It's super stylish and provides great sun protection.<br />Fair disclaimer: I received this item either at a discount or no cost with no further obligation. I didn't promise to provide a review and only committed that if I did, it would be my genuine evaluation."
4.0,It has a decent hold on the girls which is what I needed most. The fit is not as &#34;round&#34; as I need & it does hold the girls down rather than up like I would prefer. There is NO padding which somehow I missed that point before purchase. But it holds when I run and is easier to get on and off than most sports bras.
4.0,I use them under thin other pants and shorts.<br /><br />I don’t understand the thick wide band though.<br /><br />A bit tight.
4.0,The fit is pretty snug
4.0,Not bad at all as I start collecting the 3 or 4 &#34;star&#34; quality watches that I wear when I travel into different countries. I'm also have  some fine watches but I just wear them here in the U.S. for safety reason.
4.0,"I don't particularly like the feel of this dress, but it's cute and fits nicely.  I am 5'7' and had to wear it with a pencil skirt, because it's too short for me; but I knew that when I bought it.  It's a great Christmas outfit!"
4.0,Bought this for my sister and she loved it
4.0,Didn’t meet the squat test - could see through. Other than that they fit and felt great!
4.0,"its so comfty! and its very long, almost like a short dress on me, but it looks good like that"
4.0,Cute little number my little one wire it for her first birthday Only thing the arm holes are awkwardly large and the ruffles stand straight up I washed it twice to soften and then ironed but overall cute!
4.0,"They look great and are durable but the piece that sits on the nose feels a little weird to me. I still like the glasses though, i use them for baseball."
4.0,"Hopefully, the Lazy Gnome can take the place of The Elf on the Shelf and the older Grandson can read the story to the younger one."
4.0,"Thin, breathable material. Fits just as it looks so keep in mind it may cling to larger areas as you move around. Definitely happy to have it in my wardrobe"
4.0,Love material and feel. It is on the small side. Next time I will order large size.
4.0,They were sheer yet were pretty with design. I can<br />Wear snug shoes yet wear pretty Sox’s without<br />Being too tight
4.0,"Great pants. Very polished looking. No one would know they were pull on stretchy pants. Sturdy material. Comfortable for sure! Have not washed them yet, so we will see how they hold up. I have a feeling that they will do just fine."
4.0,Colors are bright and pretty. Front dips a lot but still is wearable.
4.0,It was perfect and looked great.  Material was just great
4.0,Satisfied. Product is affordable.
4.0,Like it! But would like it fits me better!
4.0,Fit was great on my 1 year old. Very soft material. Highly recommend for warm weather environments.
4.0,"Shirt is a little see through, if you wear a normal (white/tan) bra you should be fine. Looks cute and I can pull it off in a professional environment too."
4.0,"Cute little skirt. Bought this for my daughter to wear to her troll themed party. It was a hit and it looked great (pair of short tights underneath of course). Word of caution though, either hand wash or wash on delicate, because the ribbon will fray if you don't, and it won't be as cute as it was initially (see pictures)."
4.0,Wash well wears well
4.0,"Pros: Slim, minimalist. but still able to hold a lot. I have about the equivalent of about 20 cards in my wallet.<br /><br />Cons: it has trouble with a lot of cards, especially in the hidden pocket, the wallet is a little difficult to maneuver when open. The &#34;Hidden flap&#34; that covers the second cash pocket can get stuck if you have a lot of stuff in the wallet. I have about the equivalent of about 20 cards"
4.0,"I love this dress for the price! It looks just like it does online. It's comfortable and fits well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the material is SO thing that you can easily see through it, which is par for course with cheaper garments."
4.0,Great fit & suitable for cold!
4.0,"Overall it's a nice product - using them as take-away gifts, but transferring the charms to a wine charm ring instread of using the necklace.  Good thing too - ordered 12, 11 are identical, the 12th was packaged differently, had the charms sealed individually in plastic, and the chain was a different style and a 16' instead of a 20"".  The charms are all identical.<br /><br />So, for my application, it was fine, but if ordering in a quantity, be aware there might be a difference in the chain"
4.0,I really enjoy this bag. It is made fairly well and the strap in the perfect length. The only complaint I I would have is that the zipper part had come untied and I almost lost one of the beads. I ended up just tying it back together and have had no problems with i since. It was definitely worth the money I spent on it.
4.0,Very useful for travel time PASSPORT/Cards protection
4.0,"Ive been using these glasses for about 6 years. I buy them at wallgreens and get 2 for 1 there.<br />They feel great and and are all metal. Once you get used to taking on and off due to the spring loaded ""arms?"" that let them fold flat. Drove me nuts till i figured them out. Now not noticeable. But they are not durable.<br />I go through 4 or 5 pair a year.<br />Thats just the price to pay for the only glasses that hit all the marks. Give here, loose there, this is the best compromise for the price. But really get them local and find a 2 for 1 sale. They have Allways been 2 for 1 as long as i can remember. Thats what got me to buy them in the first place. Hear that Foster Grant? Lets have that deal here on Amazon."
4.0,"I bought a pair of one of the composite toe boots. Once I tried them on, the only issue for me was the composite toe. It was angled in a way that made for a very uncomfortable fit. I was going to return them, but asked my sister to try them instead; they fit her well, so now they're hers."
4.0,Fun travel dress.
4.0,"Nice watch....looks good,  .....a little big for my husband wrist .......once we take the links out it will be to wear...."
4.0,"It’s honestly really cute. I do like the style of the bag. Love the color and of course love that it’s hello kitty. I know it’s a kids bag but it is a bit smaller than what I expected. It’s big enough for almost all of the things I used to carry in my previous bag. The things that don’t fit are my portable battery, and my phone fits but it I have to struggle just s tiny bit. Don’t have to force it in but I do have to give it a bit more attention than I’m used to. Most of my other bags I’m able to just drop it in the bag. Not this one. That’s my reason for 4 stars. I don’t think I’ll return it. I’ll probably update after a month use if I do decide to keep it. Looks durable."
4.0,"This dress is very cute and is just what I expected from the photo. The two things I was a little disappointed in are that it runs small (a size 5-6 fits my very petite 5 year old but won't for long; she is 32lbs and not sure how tall), and that it wrinkles terribly in the laundry. I tried pulling it out of the dryer quickly like I do with many other wrinkle prone clothes, but especially the ruffled sleeves were very bad anyway. I think I'll iron it well and try not to wash it unless very necessary. If you don't mind ironing, then size up and buy this because it's adorable!"
4.0,"Very light weight, doesn’t really hurt."
4.0,"The underwear is mid-cut and I like it. The additional shirt tuck piece was weird at first, but it holds in my polo and dress shirt tails in place as advertised.<br /><br />Just wish it came in other colors."
4.0,Nice cap but the elastic hurts my ears.
4.0,"Serves its purpose, good value for price.  Hasn't gotten much use, but arrived in perfect condition.  Will update if anything goes wrong."
4.0,It was easy to adjust the size on this belt.  I like that it is reversible - giving me both a black and a brown option.  The material seems to be good quality.
4.0,Good fit and classy looking hat.
4.0,"Nice Cap, but took to long to arrive."
4.0,Not sure how sheerness and warmth factor into the rating but definitely easy to use. I used it on my glasses and my father’s. It makes a big difference. It does seem like you have to apply it quite often but works as intended.
4.0,Nice hat and folds up. My problem is it says 1 size fits all. Not true this hat fits to tight for my head.
4.0,"First off the watch looks very nice and is comfortable on the wrist. Comparing it to images of a real Rolex Pepsi GMT I'd say they did a very good job of copying it. If it said Rolex on it, it would be pretty convincing to someone who's a Rolex novice. Probably the most noticeable difference is that it has a metal bezel that lacks the depth of the Rolex ceramic bezel.<br /><br />It loses about 30 seconds a day which is below par compared to some other similarly priced Chinese mechanical watches I own. Also, the cyclops lens is a bit off center - just enough to be annoying.<br /><br />The bezel rotates fairly easily but I wouldn't call it smooth. The detents on the bezel are kinda mushy which for this watch is actually a good thing. I say that because the bezel is slightly misaligned with the dial but if you rotate it past the detent and line it up with the dial, it won't drop back into the detent when you let go.<br /><br />I'm actually pretty happy with the watch considering the price I paid. It's one of the lowest priced GMT clones available right now and I really enjoy wearing it! Would I buy it again knowing what I know now? Honestly I'd probably spend an extra 20 or 30 dollars on a clone that has a ceramic bezel and hope for the best in the quality department."
4.0,"Very cute. The all come in a small packet and so if giving them as a gift, find a group of little plastic bags or a small display piece of cardboard, etc.  You'll enjoy them."
4.0,You can tell they're birds but they're definitely more &#34;bird-ish&#34; in the image. Overall though it's good quality and for the price I can't complain.
4.0,Order size just larger of what you normally wear. Great feel. I use mine for scubs diving and spear fishing
4.0,Size should take into account that the lining is 2+ inches thick.  I M between xlarge and 2x but count is a tight fit.
4.0,"These are gorgeous, and such a good deal for the price."
4.0,I would recommend going up one size.
4.0,"The product itself is great, good quality and good details, it's not a big cat nor a little one, perfect for wearing on your ear. One detail you have to be aware of is that it may not fit your ear right our of the package, I am trying to pull it/bend it by myself but I find it could break I would take it to the jewerly so they can help me out. If you are considering purchasing this item that is what you have to be aware of, other than that it's a great quality product."
4.0,"I ordered a set for my granddaughter and when it arrived one of the rosebuds on the necklace was loose and unraveling, this required stitching on my part.  Before realizing this, I had already ordered two more sets for two granddaughters out-of-state, hope they arrive in better condition.  Most importantly, I am happy to report that all three granddaughters were thrilled with their jewerly sets."
4.0,This product was just right for the occasion. I wouldn’t recommend for everyday use bc it fades easily.
4.0,Pretty. Daughter in law liked it
4.0,Beautiful suit. I wished it had more support in the front.
4.0,Cleavage cut is off-center from the fabric pattern. Word of warning to those of you with OCD.
4.0,The hole for the arms is really tight. I'll need to stretch it or get altered. Otherwise good fit and flattering.
4.0,My girls love these socks!
4.0,"Nice, enjoy wearing them.!!!"
4.0,They’re ok...
4.0,"Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because it was too small for my purpose.  Excellent quality, luscious feel to the leather.  Returned only due to size."
4.0,My daughter loves these sneakers because of the Paw Patrol characters and they fit her well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because she sometimes has a hard time getting the shoes on because of the elastic across the front.  It keeps it snug on the foot so it doesn't come off but also makes it a little hard to get on.
4.0,its nice but the arms are alittle tight
4.0,Came with 2 tiny sratches and kinda tilted to the right. Nothing major.
4.0,cute set! pants are a little too short for me but still very cute.
4.0,"I bought these after I got my tongue pierced and I didn't realize they were going to be a random mix.  Its okay though because I really like most of the ones I got.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because some of the tongue rings were unable to unscrew and were stuck.  I also don't like how small the bottom ball is.  I generally like it a little bigger.  But overall, great product and I will probably buy again to see what else I get in the future."
4.0,Nice dress but... black color got white hues just after one wash... the fabric is synthetic and it feels sticky. Overall it is a nice dress for the money.. I did not return it but i would not buy it again. It hits me just below knees and it's my preferred length so i kept it.
4.0,I really like the cut and color of this top. The breathability of the fabric makes it ideal for runs in the Texas heat. The fabric does snag easily so I won’t be wearing it for outside chores.
4.0,Nice looking cuff links.  Will work well with any French cuffs.  Look great with a tux.
4.0,"Super cute, but way big."
4.0,Fits perfectly n is sturdy material
4.0,Wish is was a bit longer
4.0,Nice Color! But becareful putting it on when you receive it bcus of the Sharp Edges.<br />  Just Bebd the Edged down.
4.0,"Cute, good quality, size L a little small for me -- I don't like a tight fit. I normally wear size 12."
4.0,"Very comfy pant. But the supper area needs to be covered because the zipper flap doesn’t connect, it looks open. Very casual pant. Overall good color and feel. Poor detail."
4.0,These sunglasses are very nice. The description was right on and the medium is true to size. They will be perfect for our full summer in Florida at the beaches.
4.0,"I used the company's chart to select my size and the dress fits well.  It's a little big, but I was between sizes and would rather order too big and get it taken in than too small.  It's a really pretty dress -- my husband's favorite.  I bought it to wear to a wedding, and I feel it's a little casual for that, but it is perfect for summer cookouts."
4.0,"Very pretty and lightweight, great for summer. Perfect length for me (5’0”)."
4.0,Have a little big
4.0,great pair of stocking if under 6' tall
4.0,for inexpensive jewelry it’s holding up really well. i wear daily and none of its green yet!
4.0,Fits as expected when using their size conversion chart.
4.0,"Beautiful watch, Can't wait to give to my daughter on Christmas!!!"
4.0,The holes for the buttons are slightly too small. I have to force the buttons through. I feel like eventually the button will fall off with how I have to force the button thriugh. But other than that I like the shorts very much.
4.0,"beautiful watch, and Nice watch for the price!"
4.0,"It’s a very pretty mask, but it kinda comes a little bit disfigured. Still got compliments tho."
4.0,Love the color and fit! I got a lot of compliments on this one. Thank you!
4.0,"My 6 year old granddaughter loved them. But they were a little big, even though I purchased her usual size. They are very cute and I would buy them again just adjusting for the size."
4.0,I really like this dress. The color is nice and I love that this dress hugs your curves. The only dislike is the length. Due to me only being 5'2 the dress came under my feet. I had to wear with really high shoes.
4.0,Lovely dress just order a size up
4.0,"I purchased this skort to be worn with one of my bathing suits as well as my workout tops. It's really cute. The flare on the skirt makes it look extremely flattering. The only reason I took away a star is because it's a darker color than what appears online, and I wish it was a little lighter. I would definitely buy more colors of this style."
4.0,"love the lace details. Its a flirtatious and fun without being too revealing. Love that the navy color can match any outfit, with jeans or  leggings. I envision myself wearing this for work or going out!"
4.0,I felt like this ran small.
4.0,"Really pretty, simple, don't expect &#34;Guess&#34; quality but it is not far from &#34;Gap&#34; quality iykwim.<br /><br />It was a bit big, but our baby is short for her age so it was kind of expected."
4.0,I knew going in that clothing listed by this vendor are not US sizes. To fix this minor issue because they don't tell you where these come from just order one size bigger than your normal. Shirt is built very well and warm.
4.0,"The legs roll up and they're a bit tight, typically I wear size 7 I was looking for something to wear to bed and during the day, they look enough like shorts that I can walk to the bathroom at night but are comfy to sleep in"
4.0,Very cheap material. Fits me way bigger than the size chart says it should.
4.0,I love it ...thanks
4.0,Runs small. Soft smooth material. Had to return.
4.0,"I bought this to replace the one I had lost that was given to me by a dear friend of mine. it isn't exactly the same but it'll  do, however, the chain broke before I could even take it out of the packaging. was fixable though."
4.0,"I’m 5’8” 205 pounds and got an XL. They’re perfect. I have a tummy so I was happy the high waist fit. It is snug.<br /><br />These are light and flowy, the fit is very flattering. I got a black pair and I wear a t-shirt and knot it in front to accentuate my waist and it’s really cute. (I have an inverted triangle shape)<br /><br />I docked 1 star because they’re thin, basically sheer in the right light. I have black shape-wear shorts I wear so I’m ok with it."
4.0,They are polarized and work great.  A good price for polarized shades and they fit perfectly and look good on.
4.0,Thin and light weight. Bought for 12yr old son and they didn't fit him they were smaller than expected but fit his 8yr old brother so not a total loss.
4.0,"I am 5 foot 5, weigh 170, have a 33 inch waist, and a 47 inch hip. These pants are so tight on my thighs, yet absolutely huge on my waistline.  I tried 8 pairs of hiking pants, and the only pair what was decent for a curvy girl turned out to be the ""Rdruko Women's Outdoor Water-Resistant Quick Drying Lightweight Cargo Pants(Blue, US XL)""<br />I hope this info helps someone else with a really curvy body!"
4.0,"So the mask is a bit ""crunchy"" while you're wearing it.... while you're talking, the mask moves and there's crunchy noises.  Looks sharp though, but if you're going to be talking... this isn't your  mask.  There isn't as much ""free"" space in the front as some masks have."
4.0,Love the shorts. Great fit. Top too large but liked bottom so much that keeping anyway. Plan to just take a few tucks around the top to adjust. If top fit as well as bottom would give a five.
4.0,"The dress is made with a comfortable cotton material, needs ironing though. I'm between size 8-10. Large was too big; I returned it. Medium fits well above the top but the waist fits a little too snug. Luckily the material is a little elastic and I should be able to wear it, just not to a big dinner party. On the other hand, it may get me to eat less. I like it."
4.0,Very good quality. Not very true to size but I just ordered a size down from my measurements
4.0,Very nice.  Husband is very happy with these
4.0,resuelve
4.0,"Se siente muy suave y protege bien del frío. Peso 131 libras y aunque me queda el size M, una pulgada más grande hubiese sido mejor."
4.0,"Arrived quickly. It is a dainty bracelet; the leaf is covered with sparkly little crystal chips and feels relatively solid. The chain is quite thin and dainty. It might not stand up to constant or everyday wear; but, it is pretty and had enough room to allow me to slip it over my somewhat chubby hand and even required tightening on my wrist (@ 7.5&#34;). If the chain holds up through my vacation, I may even give that 5th star."
4.0,Perfect for my cosplay outfit
4.0,The hat I got is really nice and I love it. The quality is great. The only thing I didn't like about the hat was how they didn't trim the seam good enough on the front of the hat so because of that there was a bump from where the seams met. I was able to sold this but folding back the forhead band and cutting the seam myself. Now the hate fits like a glove and is comfortable. I will definitely buy again.
4.0,"Cute dress, I used it for my save a dates! Only thing is it is shear, so be prepared to wear a slip underneath with it. Adding a belt gives you more form otherwise it fits loosely, perfect for a swim suit cover as well."
4.0,These workout type shirts run small. I'm a size 8/10 and needed an xl/XXL. Great shirts though.
4.0,I was afraid it would be too small but I ordered XL or 16-18 and it fit me just right.  Love the POCKETS!
4.0,I really liked the dress. The fit of the dress  was relaxing for my evening Gala that I attended.
4.0,"It fits well in the right place, but there are spots at the top that aren't as tight as I'd like them to be, which is minor. There are also areas where the straps are attached at the top that have left red marks on my skin, but that just might be because I've got sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall it's super cute and I wore it under one of my over sized sweaters and felt cute so it's a great buy in my opinion.<br /><br />TL;DR: holds up what needs holding, is a bit rough on skin, but a good buy overall."
4.0,Strap is comfortable and soft compared to other straps.  I gave it 4 star only because it doesn't fit like my other nato. Its a tiny bit loose for my wrist but not to loose for the watch to dangle. An extra hole would be great
4.0,"Nothing major wrong, cant expect much for sub 40 bucks. However, the -30F in the title is misleading imo.<br /><br />These work if youre on a bicycle or for snowball fight activities in the winter, yes. For moped and motorcycle riding in the winter, your best bet is heated gloves."
4.0,"They are high quality, but they are a bit smaller than expected. I don’t know if my 4 year old will be able to get them on by herself. She loves them though"
4.0,GreAt flash for a Halloween party!
4.0,Wish it came in an xs. The small fits more like a medium.
4.0,"These are nice shorts and good quality.  They are a bit on the expensive side, however."
4.0,"muy bonito, algo caro pero bonito"
4.0,"It is warmth, but not look as good as the photo."
4.0,Super cute tiny purse for a young girl who doesn’t to carry much. Great for holding just a few small things. The pocket on the back is not big enough for a cell phone.
4.0,"This dress is absolutely perfect. Its not too heavy but it's not too light that a gust of wind will blow the skirt portion up. The downfall is the chest area. I have a noticeably large chest but this dress' chest area was TOO big on me. When I wear it, it leaves me with a deep, deep, DEEP V neck style top. And that isn't my style so I pin it closed."
4.0,I usually wear a small so thats what i ordered and its a bit to small. I could have gotten a medium. But i can still wear it so its not big deal. Its very cute and super soft. I love the color. Its kind of a purpley blue color and very pretty.
4.0,Nice socks. Fit fairly well.
4.0,Would enjoy a more fitted waist.
4.0,"I got this lanyard for an upcoming cruise.  I don't like keeping up with my magic spending card and decided to join the masses and wear a lanyard.  But I don't like the branded ones available on the ships and I didn't want a heavy/jewelry-type lanyard.  This seemed like a good fit.<br /><br />The lanyard comes with a hook that can (hopefully) hook right into the card.  If that won't work, there are a few more options.  There are two key rings and a mini-cable with a fine key ring....just in case the card has a smaller type connection point.  There is also an attachment to put in your phone case but I don't think I would trust my phone case and the attachment to hold that, not to mention that I don't want the weight of my phone on the lanyard.  The only thing I really don't like about the lanyard is that the metal parts are gold.  It would have been nice to have silver as an option but I will make it work.  It's a lanyard..."
4.0,"It fits me just about perfectly; as expected for skirt, but top was tight along the shoulders which made it hard to take off considering the material. Material for the top and skirt are fine, scarf was pretty poor in material. Also came with the socks shown which I didn't know."
4.0,"this is relaxed and comfortable. a little warm for me but it is getting into summer. at first i thought the hole for the ponytail was kinda big but when i put my hair up in a bun and could still wear the cap, i was very pleased. feels durable and easily adjustable and it is also cute!"
4.0,Shiny in green sunlight and purple if you look out a sunny window indoors. A touch tight for wide faces. Slow shipping but cool.
4.0,It was what I was looking for and I like the little pocket on the back.
4.0,"The pieces are absolutely beautiful! The only thing that dropped my rating from a 5 to a 4 is that one of the turquoise jewels from the feather set popped off as I was trying to put it on, and I don’t believe it was a result of me being rough with trying to get it on. So it was a little disappointing that I didn’t even get to wear them out even once in their original condition. I still wear them, as I don’t think it’s really that noticeable unless I were to point it out.<br /><br />The spade and feather pieces do have some weight to them — enough for them to hang forward a little as the day goes on. One of the tunnels from the spade piece even came out my first time wearing it. I didn’t notice until I looked at myself in the mirror at the end of the day.  Because of this, I find that I’m very conscious about checking my ears every now and then to make sure they’re still in place.<br /><br />Overall I think this purchase was well worth the money that I paid!"
4.0,"I needed a pair of water-proof, comfortable, insulated boots to just slip in without soaks to walk my dog in the winter morning around neighborhood. These boots fit my needs exactly. They have passed the tests of rain and sleet, no snow yet. Very happy with them. The only reason I rate 4 stars is the sole are a little thin that I wouldn't wear them for hiking or on rough surfaces. Also, they are not the most fashionable footwear but it's personal taste and they look fine for a dude walking dog.<br /><br />The bottom line is they are perfect for what I need and I am really happy with them."
4.0,"Pretty fabric and great comfy fit. The fabric just doesn’t breathe, way too hot for summer. I’ll really like it in the fall with a Jean jacket"
4.0,very pretty...but smaller than expected.
4.0,"Great glasses. My one complaint is that it's incredibly easy to see my own eyes / face in the lenses, which is a bit distracting. They're pretty large, so block almost the entire field of vision."
4.0,Fun gift. Chain being a little longer would’ve made it perfect otherwise it is enjoyed by my 11 year old
4.0,"It's a little baggy in the back, but it fits nicely.  I wear it by itself and sometimes with a cute cardigan and heels.  Very versatile for every occasion!"
4.0,This is a very nice quality bra. Feels very comfortable without the wires but still supportive. Satin smooth with a little bit of padding but it’s not bulky. I like a little padding and like that it looks natural and hides what it needs to. Is great under thin tops and t shirts. I think it runs true to size and has a little stretch so it’s flexible for sizing up or down if you want to.
4.0,Lightweight and very comfy. They are very high waisted which I think helps ensure a good fit. The drawstring is SO long but otherwise I love them
4.0,"Cute bows and not bad for the price.  Several of the colors are a little strange and don't really match much.  They were a little different than the pictures but nothing major.  Overall, good purchase."
4.0,Got both the blue and wine red medium. Wine red fit much better.  Blue was bit more snug around waist and a lot shorter in length.  Blue is def a booty short that u probably won't want to wear outside the house.  Wine red was a tad longer in the back n covered my cheeks more. Might be able to pull those off at the gym.. still a little sexy tho. I love the red. Bummed blue didnt fit the same.
4.0,"These gloves were exactly what I was looking for, at a great price. The only problem was the box arrived damaged (though shipping packaging was intact) - one side of the box was ripped off, and the gloves were exposed and coming out. I'm not sure if any gloves were lost. Some cardboard and tape fixed the problem, and I reinforced all other sides because it is rather flimsy. Now it's much more sturdy."
4.0,My daughter loves them but they are on the small side. I ordered a size up and I'm glad I did. They fit great.
4.0,I really do love it I will have to order some more like it.
4.0,I normally wear an xl. I ordered a XXL because I wanted it to be big and comfy and baggy. It was still really tight! Slim fit for sure!
4.0,"I live in Minnesota and walk daily so I was looking for some warm undergarments for cold days outside.  I received my order quickly and I really like the thickness of the leggings for warmth under slacks. However, I don’t like that they are hard to pull on since I have arthritis in my hands. I wish there was an option to order a larger size with more give, this would help when trying to pull them up my legs. I’m 5’6” and 140#. I’d like to order another pair because these have a really good thickness but I won’t only because of how hard it is for my hands to grip and pull them up. Perhaps someone less tall than me won’t have this issue."
4.0,"Nice material, well made"
4.0,"I have enjoyed these sports bras. Ordered 2 packs. Use while my chest port has been accessed and doesn’t rub across port/access. Also able to wear when chest port access is being changed unlike most bras. Very supporting and cool to wear. I have had for over 6 months and still wearing. Only a couple stings have pulled out. As well, inserts are starting to loose stitching. But I have been very rough with these bras. Will buy more!"
4.0,"It’s very comfortable, but not what I expected. I thought that it was a little bigger. I like it though."
4.0,"This dress can definitely be dressed up or down. Keep in mind its a sweater knit material so more on the casual side, but so many ways to class it up. The fit is more on the Juniors size scale. I'm normally a womens medium and ordered a large which fits well. If I ordered a medium, the material would stretch too thin and reveal undergarments. Length-wise it just about hits the floor on my 5'4"" frame, but the front is a couple inches shorter than the back. So the back hits the floor while the front stops at the top of my feet, so thats a cute detail.<br /><br />I definitely recommend putting this on before hair and makeup since its a bit of a squeeze to get into the neck hole."
4.0,There is no adjusting to these rings You cannot move around.They are very pretty though
4.0,"Value and Thickness are ""easy"" five-stars; while ""sturdiness"" falls just a little short.<br /><br />6"" long and 3.5"" at widest point, the metal hook appears to be stainless.  The machined bolts appear to be both secure and of high quality.  The attached rope is about 3x as thick as 550 paracord.  ""Deployment"" of ""centerpiece"" to create a ""3D"" grappler is swift and easy.  LIKELY FAILURE POINT is the rubber band used to secure ""crosspiece"" to create 3D grapple:<br />a.  Only one (1) not four (4) bands were included in my package<br />b.  The band is not created of a material which can withstand hard usage--it will be the ""first thing to fail"".<br /><br />I bought this to use to raise a ""slim jim"" 2M radio antenna about 30' about the ground.  The weight of the grapple is just about perfect for that purpose.  However, I substituted 550 paracord to have 50' of lighter, yet still sturdy, line which could sail over a tree limb and fall onto the other side.  I plan to replace the supplied  ""rubber band"" with a thick wire which will provide a more secure connection between the two pieces.  [Or, I could use paracord to really wrap up the two pieces; as shown in one picture.]<br /><br />I have a beautifully machined ""Pocket Grapplyng Hook"" I bought from County Comm, with similar dimensions, but it costs me $50 shipped.  This budget unit is a bargain; just don't trust a single little rubber band."
4.0,"Great bag.  Durable material.  I  bought it because of it's size; I needed an oversized bag for summer camp.  Unfortunately, it is so big that sending it home UPS was a small fortune.... When full it was also over 50 pounds and would exceed the limit for airlines as well"
4.0,"I got this T today and it was really well made, great fabric, but I had to return😕.  I wear a large, bought an XL, but it was snug."
4.0,"A little baggy for joggers, I think they run slightly large. Good quality though. Warm and comfy."
4.0,Very pretty pattern. Fits nice on my daughter.
4.0,These earrings are cute and well cut to see the sparkle. However it is very short and gets hidden by longer hair. Unfortunately since it cannot be seen I will be returning it. This would be perfect for a little girl who just got her ears pieced.
4.0,This jacket is exactly what I was looking for style and fit wise. I just wish the material was a bit thicker. I have yet to wear it in the rain.
4.0,"Muy suave por dentro pero viene pequeño y corto. Normalmente uso una S y pedí una talla M y me quedó justo, bien ajustado al cuerpo y a mitad de pantorrilla. Muy muy corto."
4.0,"its comfortable i ordered size medium, it more ran as a small, but its not too small to where i cant get it on, its snug, like am being hugged, the zipper is scary cuz im afraid of zippjng my skin in it so i may have to start wear ik ng a tank top under it, i will post when/IF i start seeing results in the hour glass figure. :) id say its a pretty good product though for sure!!:)"
4.0,Good quality but fits two sizes smaller than stated.
4.0,Very cute light weight sweater.
4.0,"Nice size, works we'll cross body, not big and bulky like a back pack like some others."
4.0,"The enhancer I received had none of the bright colors of an abalone shell.  Under the quartz the only visable shade is grey.  That being said, the enhancer is pretty and the silver work is well done."
4.0,👍🏾 Long loose fitting dress pattern very tribal
4.0,I’m definitely going back for more
4.0,"These are adorable shoes and a nice color red - not too bright. They seem to run a little large, as my daughter wears a 7.5 or an 8, and the 7.5 are still a bit big."
4.0,"Fits well and does the job! I think it may have faded a bit after a month’s use, but it still fits well. Great for swimming laps!"
4.0,"I appreciate this style of nightshirt year round, for the cool, breathable fabric and roomy fit.  They are not pretty, sexy, or exciting -- they're purely for comfortable sleep.  That works for me, and I like them."
4.0,Loved these but returned them because they were too small.  Says fits 13-4.  My daughter is a size 3 and they were nowhere near fitting her.
4.0,Nice but a little tight.
4.0,There really warm for the winter.
4.0,Runs a bit large but overall cute I do not expect it to hold up long though
4.0,As described but run big.  Love these.
4.0,Besides being a little small this is a great T-shirt quality of the materials high-end stitching is perfect look as great a great T-shirt I just can't beat it.
4.0,"Wasn't the material I expected, I was thinking more of a t-shirt type material turns out it's like 99% STRETCHY nylon type material. However, I was not disappointed when I wore it. Very cute & longer like I like them. Just a different type of material then what I would have purchased in-store. But I do like it!"
4.0,Very cute! Slightly heavy but not bad! The color was a little more translucent at certain spots but overall super cute. I wore them for graduation. Worth it
4.0,"These aren't the most comfortable of masks, but let's come back to that.<br />I like the variety of colors that are included, and I favor the white and ivory versions out of the four. They all use the same kind of elastic strap, and they all use the same padding, so the only decision to make on which to wear depends on color-coordinating with your outfit.<br /><br />Some reviewers have called out the padding, but my features seem to line up comfortably. I find that the inner dimensions of the features don't quite conform to my own, so I feel the weight on my nose, and less so on my cheeks. This may not be a big deal for you, and I intend to throw some heat on one of them as a test to see if I can reshape and improve the curvature a little. I'll check back in with results.<br /><br />Overall, these do the job, and for the MSRP this purchase is an easy one to make."
4.0,somewhat bigger than I expected but kept it anyway
4.0,"Costume was great. The pants did not stay up well, so I wore high rise leggings under them and rolled them over the top to help. I would recommend finding different pants."
4.0,Cute but runs on the small side. I washed them and not sure they will work.
4.0,"I bought this because I needed a dress to wear to my wedding shower.  The original dress I had ordered for it won't be here until after the fact so I needed something fast.  I was hoping for something feminine and classic.  The dress arrived and is pretty just not what I wanted.  The color on the cream is more putty colored.  and does not flatter my skin tone.  It would  be beautiful on a darker skin tone.  The dress fit okay, slightly tight in the arms and around the back.  I normally wear a 18 woman's, but I have put on a few pound over the past few months, if I was my normal size it would look great on.  I am a Hourglass to slight pear shape as my rump is about 2 in bigger than my bust. The length is very nice I am only 5'4&#34;and I would say it came just past my knees.  I will be returning this as I won't wear it.  If it was a different color I would probably keep it."
4.0,I love this outfit. It is so perfect for work. My only complaint is that the size of the blazer is smaller than the dress. So the dress fits a little big. But the upper arms on the blazer are small. I have to wear a different blazer with this. Or I may buy the next size up just for the blazer.
4.0,Love the color and the fit! Order came early and I was super happy with it.
4.0,by far my favorite choker cute for the summer
4.0,"Little smaller than size chart, but they quickly exchanged. Good customer service, 2 thumbs up"
4.0,"I'm 5'3"" & typically a size 12-14 in dresses (currently 36DD in chest). I ordered a large & find the dress to be quite comfortable.<br />If I had my druthers, it'd be a smidge shorter (by about 1-2""), but wearing wedge sandals takes care of that. And even though it's longer than I would prefer, it doesn't look frumpy or make me feel like I'm being swallowed by material, like some other maxi dresses can.<br />The material is better than I expected too. I'm not sure what it is...most likely a cotton/poly blend (definitely not 100% cotton)...but it's thicker than other dresses I've ordered. Not see-through at all. No bra/panty lines either.<br />I definitely recommend this dress.<br /><br />I bought this dress in the ""grey"" as well. Same great fit, but I was disappointed in the color. The ""grey"" looks more like a heathered blue than the grey in the picture. I kept it (again, super comfortable & flattering), but just not the color I expected."
4.0,Looks good. Great for the changeable snaps for the different holiday seasons.
4.0,I made brackets with these wave charms
4.0,Very comfortable for sensitive head
4.0,I was very fearful that this wouldn't fit however it went better than expected. The bottom area fit fine however the top was a little bit small but we found a work around.
4.0,A+ thanks
4.0,It is a very nice and classic style. It is soft and comfortable even if the quality of the fabric is the best
4.0,"These socks were too thick for my sneakers and too tight around the calf- left pretty deep marks.<br />Felt pretty heavy duty, I'm sure they will be good for some people."
4.0,"These slippers are sooooo cute & cuddly, but the sizing description is totally wrong.  My daughter is a 7, so I ordered a UK 6 which they say is the same as a US 8, but these were way to small-- looked like they were a regular old US 6.  I re-ordered the UK 8, and those are perfect."
4.0,Impressed with this dress especially since it’s $20! I usually wear large and ordered an xl. Color wasn’t as green as it advertised but still pretty.
4.0,I love this top but I was a little disappointed in the color.  I ordered wine but it's red.  I'll keep it and wear it and love it though.
4.0,"I like these, they are comfortable and very stretchy, but they do not go all the way up to my knees. I am 5'9&#34; tall."
4.0,"Wore it as a part of the costume for a dance recital. Worked out great unfortunately one got bent in the mail, probably because it's not packaged in a box.  Fortunately it  all worked out fine with a few hairpins. All in all look great"
4.0,"I didn't realize you have to tie the shoelaces, which would be difficult for my 4 year old. From the photos, it looks like there is no need to tie them. Maybe I can find a way to tie it snug enough for my daughter to take her boots on and off at preschool. She likes the boots, seem very warm. She will wear these come november in New England!"
4.0,Yes the girl I sent this too really like it.
4.0,"These run super small. To be fair they are compression pants so I should have known. But they still fit and I was able to wear them to work out and they passed the “squat test”. They also tightened all the right places so it ended up looking awesome, kind of like a push up bra for your booty, but if I bought them again I may get one size up to be more comfortable"
4.0,"This item was somewhat small only because I do not like too much of a fitted clothing. However, I love the dress and the price was right for the type of fabric."
4.0,"Love the nightgowns but they shrink almost 2 inches when washed and dried.  Luckily that’s why I got the long ones.  But be careful of length when buying, won’t stay the same."
4.0,I loved the sweater
4.0,"I wanted an extra small but had to opt for the extra large since that's the only size that had prime shipping, also on assuming that this is in Asian sizes. The sweater does look as pictured and I couldn't find a tag inside of it to see what the material really was, so I will assume that it is 100% polyester as stated in the listing.<br /><br />I would probably consider the sizing to be smaller than US sizes. I was hoping the size I selected would be smaller but it's maybe a medium/large in junior sizes. This is a sweater as stated, with a fleeced interior so it's best when worn in the colder months. The sleeves crumple up when worn since the sweater is too big on me, tucking the front into my pants makes it look a little better but still, sleeves and sweater are too big and it doesn't look flattering on me. I might just cut a few inches below the print to turn this into a crop top sweater.<br /><br />The sweater looks to be well sewn and the quality of the cat and wording on the front of the sweater seem to be of okay quality. I keep touching it and testing it to see if it would peel but time will only tell once I run this through the wash."
4.0,decent muffs at a good price
4.0,Love the wallet but view window ripped in the corner the 1st week
4.0,It was perfect for me! Additional card holders and a place for cash. I didn’t have to tote my large purse around on vacation
4.0,"Love the design of this satchel, outside is casually elegant.  Leather accents are just a little distressed to give it a casual air.  Inside is very functional with good size pockets to keep everything organized. Plenty of room to slip in a 14 or 15-inch laptop along with paperwork.  The only disappointment is that the outer bottom is not trimmed with leather (minus a star), only with the canvas material which I fear will not holdup over time as well as easily become discolored."
4.0,"I purchased the product 4 years ago, and it just broke today. This backpack never once tore or had a zipper mishap. when I originally received this item in the mail, I was a little let down because of the size, but I realized that it would be perfect for me. Bigger is not ALWAYS better!<br />I strongly recommended this product."
4.0,"Pretty pattern, and being long I like having shirts that don't expose my midriff constantly, particularly when I'm rounder in the middle than I like. Less one star because I prefer cotton, but that's my only gripe."
4.0,"Ordered my normal dress size and it fit nicely. Like others have stated, the light colors are sheer. You will see EVERYTHING. Should you wish to wear one of the lighter colors in bright light and decide to go without underwear, make sure you do not have a patch of dark pubic hair because it will be visible! If you want it to be less sheer I'd suggest going up one size but keep in mind that it will not be as tight if you do so.<br /><br />The turtleneck portion is a bit weird. I do not recommend folding it down, just let it flop on it's own.<br />Rating 4 out of 5 because the shoulder seams are not completely straight. I doubt many will focus there but it's still a flaw to me.<br /><br />My measurements (in inches): 40-31-42."
4.0,Nice variety. Just wish there was a hot pink and army green..... and Wish the holes were bigger for ventilation.
4.0,You will need a slip...
4.0,"I love everything about this purse. It has ample room for cards, ID, money change and phone. My only complaint is that I can't use the touch screen on my phone. Maybe the plastic is too thick. But it is well made and I can hear my phone, see the screen then decide if I want to answer."
4.0,This band is very comfortable to wear. I really like that the end of the band is folded in so it doesn’t catch on things and fall off. Not a fan of having to remove the actual body of the watch to charge. I feel like this is going to be a lot of wear on the band.
4.0,"thin, but they were cheap and I only needed to wear them once."
4.0,"I got this in both the blue and purple versions, and I really  like them both. This blue one has lots of green and yellow flashes in the stones. It's a lightweight necklace, even though it's quite large.  It has a lobsterclaw clasp, and the earrings are french wires.  This necklace is fun to wear, looks great with jeans and a sweater, and gets lots of attention.  It's probably a bit much in most workplaces, but if your workplace is a bit funky, it might be acceptable.  The stones have an opalescent quality, and refract and play with light in interesting ways.  This would be a great gift for a teenager who likes jewelry, a girlfriend who likes funky, and the price makes it a great 'just because' gift.  This will get you noticed, but if you like showy jewelry, this is for you."
4.0,Fits perfectly and the material is good quality. Very satisfied.
4.0,VERY cute necklace but some of the pieces have fallen off.
4.0,"I am a busty girl and it was a bit snug, but love fabric"
4.0,"Super cute, huge tote bag! Back Zipper came broken and color is not white, is more ivory/cream."
4.0,Lovely earrings. They were just too heavy. I could feel my earlobes stretching.
4.0,It is nice but surprisingly very polyester. Still ok to wear in summer but I wanted it to be more cotton like.
4.0,"This suit is not at pictured! The quality is good but in my opinion it runs small. I wear a med and I ordered an XL and I could barely get it on and when I tried to zip it the zipper split. I have an hourglass figure and average size breast 34BC, I want to keep it but It doesn't fit well I will be returning. If you are petit you may have better success with this one. I'm tall 5'9 and it does not pull up all the way."
4.0,"Thin material, but that is fine for a Hawaiian shirt. I like it a lot."
4.0,"These are, essentially, exactly what they're shown as. They're ok.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Varied. There are a lot of different necklaces, which is cool. Unless you plan on gifting these or using them as favors though, I can't imagine what you'd do with 12 black chokers, all slightly different.<br />-Materials. What helps make these varied is the different materials. There are corded ones, chained ones, lace ones, velvety ones, and one of those henna-esque plastic ones like we all wore in the 90s.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cheaply made. I don't see these lasting long, but at the price they're at, i wouldn't expect them to.<br />-The clasps! Oh my goodness, they are so cheap that it's difficult to open and close these lobster clasps.<br /><br />Tied: Price. This is both a pro and a con for me. When you break it down, these come to $1 each. I wouldn't pay more than that, but I doubt you'd find them for less. The thing is, paying $12 (current price point) seems excessive, given the quality. But in this case, you're paying for quantity, not quality."
4.0,The only complaint I have is that I wish it covered my butt other than that it's really cute on.
4.0,These cling to the body and I am not a fan of clinging tops. Like the colors
4.0,"This is a &#34;one size fits all&#34; dress. The uniqueness of the fabric, (not cotton) the colors and the design caught my daughter's attention. It is very Bohemian as stated in the description. It fits her mid thigh - she's about 5'5&#34; tall and wears a size 7/8. She loves the ballooning of the sleeves and how they hang off her shoulders.  It's a different style and that's the catch:  it's different than what everyone else wears. This is not meant for plus size ladies, tweens or children - it's more like a misses medium.  My daughter is a 32B and the top fits her fine. We were overall pleased with this dress. I did receive a discount for my honest review. I hope I was somewhat helpful."
4.0,"Super cute, but the sleeves seem to run really small compared to the body of the dress. I still love it and will drop a few pounds and wear anyways."
4.0,Looks good and feels very comfortable
4.0,Nice hat.  Fits good. Came on time.  No complaints.
4.0,"The corset is beautiful, not cheap looking at all. However, all the buttons and chains fell off in the first day and had to be reattached. But it was easy and looked good as new when I was finished."
4.0,Very light reminds me of a nightgown..used as a beach cover-up
4.0,Very cute but tough on my feet if I have to wear them for more than a few hours. Size ran a little snug.
4.0,"Comfortable and as expected, I don't find the back straps to be uncomfortable, as noted by other reviewers."
4.0,"Great everyday socks,"
4.0,"Nice sweatshirt. But runs small, get a size up"
4.0,Very elegant! I loved it
4.0,The only a detailI didn't  like it also It was the motive for my return.<br />ThAe frontal holes  were way to big.So any natural or fasr moviment cuold expose your underwear.<br />This 2 huges frontal holes make the dress looks like is falling apart y his front line was losted.
4.0,"I wanted to love this soooo much. But the wire kept poking my chest in the middle so I returned it. It was really flattering though and super cute. Maybe it’s just my body shape and other people wouldn’t notice the wire. I think it depends on how your chest aligns with the fitting of the top. Not for me, but really cute!"
4.0,"Prior to receiving this item, I was trying to decide where I could place it in an unobtrusive place. However, it looks so good, I put it in a prominent place. So far, it has performed well. Since I've had it less than 2 weeks, I cannot vouch for it's durability. However, it is much quieter than I expected."
4.0,Somewhat fits small but the ruffle at the bottom helps
4.0,my husband loces everything steelers. need I say more
4.0,The price was right on the quality is good but they just didn't fit my needs
4.0,It is fine for a few uses.
4.0,"Super cute dress! It is soft and comfortable. I'm 5'4"" and it fits right at the knees; I thought it would fall below my knees so I bought two of these dresses. In any event, I still like them and I will probably end up wearing them in the house after a while.<br />But cute dress. Oh and for reference I'm around 140lbs so I bought large instead of medium just cause I wanted more room."
4.0,"When I first took this dress out of the package, I thought...hummm....looks like pajamas.  So it stayed on the hangar for about a week.  Then I finally decided to try it on and I'm glad that I did.  It was comfortable, stylish and looked like the image on Amazon.  I purchased black, but I might order again in another color.  I ordered a sized XL even though I'm a size 8 because I didn't want it to be too snug.  LX is a good fit.  L may have worked too."
4.0,"I wear a medium average. A bit snug. It is very long but very pretty and very comfortable. Overall, would buy again."
4.0,"This pendant is a really nice one, actually maybe a little big but at the same time it does make a statement. Very good details and being made of Stainless Steel it will be very durable. I used a piece of 3/8'' nylon rope as the neckless part, after I figured out the length I heated both ends and melted them together. I then took some heavy nylon fishing line and ran it through both ends tying them together then using more wrapping around the melted ends. After the rope was bound together good I turned it to where the tied part was in the center of the pendant, hides the tied part and looks super !!!! comes with two chains that are nothing less than a total joke. You'll be waiting three weeks or more for it to arrive because it ships direct from China. it's an awesome piece and I an very happy with it, If they had one half this size I'd order one of them too !!!!!!"
4.0,"These are super cute, lightweight and the colors are SUPER vibrant. The metal also doesn't get super stinky or tarnished quickly the way other cheap jewelry does.<br />However, I do have a few where the tassels are starting to fall out after a couple wears. Obviously, these are not an investment piece, so I wasn't expecting them to last for 100 years, so I'm not too upset about it."
4.0,"Very cute outfit but if expected to gift as a baby shower, expect the package to get to you in several weeks."
4.0,This is my engagement ring and my fiancé did such a great job choose it! I love it so much can't wait to get married  soon to is incredible man.
4.0,"All 3 shirts in the pack fit true to size and are true compression shirts. I thought they would be too big,  but they fit well and are very comfortable. I'm also glad that there isn't a brand symbol on the front of the shirt. With them being long sleeved,  the sleeves are too long but very lightweight."
4.0,"This is super cute but the band untied almost immediately but instead of returning, tried to fix the best I could."
4.0,"I didn't know how the dress would fit, and I didn't have time to find a back-up. I was nervous, but my man loved it and wanted it. It figures he would be right about it being the perfect dress. The neck part was larger than I needed, but some safety pins worked it out, and they also held the dress down to my bra so everything stayed where it needed to. The whole night people stopped what they were doing to let me know how much they loved my dress. I felt great in it even though I don't wear dresses and don't ever feel comfortable in them. It was such a great choice!! It took a few safety pins, but it all worked out beautifully!"
4.0,"Fits good, T-shirt a little thicker thank I would like.<br />I’m 5’3” 155lbs order XL it was little big on me but wearable, washed it and it did shrink a little making it perfect.<br />I usually wear large so to a looser fit do order a size up."
4.0,The fabric was of lesser quality than I expected. But generally “cute” summer pants.
4.0,"I like the dress and quality,way too big, don t buy larger size."
4.0,"I received these Created Pink Sapphire pear earrings in a timely manner.  They look deep purple in the picture, but they are a medium pink.  Faceted and there is no solid backing which I really like because the light shines through.  They are approx. 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inch long.  Picture makes the stones seem real big.  They aren't small but not overly big either.  They are comfortable to wear and very pretty and go well with my pink/fuschia clothes.  Glad I got them and even happier that I had a gift card to buy them with!"
4.0,Could be a little more comfy or soft but it’s good!
4.0,"Hmm. Definitely not what I was expecting, but not really *bad*? The material is mostly polyester and it feels almost like a blouse - I definitely wouldn't call it a ""sweatshirt."" Looks exactly as pictured: high collar, cute flowers, and a good color scheme with some subdued brown and light blue. The waist is pretty tight, too, so if you're into that then go for it. Material is thick without being heavy and it's got a lot of stretch. I'm returning it but I do think someone else would really enjoy it."
4.0,"I gave this product a 4 star and not a 5 because the material seems to be a bit on the low end, but overall it's a good sport bra. IT IS NOT FOR RUNNING! Unfortunately, I had to return my product because I read the title description and it said running, but it's not for high impact, the most it could be is a low impact sports bra. At least for me. I got a large and it fit as expected, I am a 34C, 4ft 11' and 135 lb.<br />I would definitely buy this bra if I'd needed a low-impact one, and I love the fact that it came with two it's not very clear,but it it does come with two. The colors of each sports bra are gray and black."
4.0,I thought at first it didn’t come with a mask but it is just a soft mask that gets folded up. The jump suit ran a little small on me.
4.0,"I like the comfort and fit, but online it doesn't show that one of them is snakeskin print. Probably would have gone with a different set had I been able to see the full design."
4.0,So pretty & fashionable! It looks just as i expected!
4.0,"Good for the price. Not great quality, but cute for a holiday outfit."
4.0,"I bought this style from another vendor and was expecting the same fit but the small I bought from this one is a small/medium. It fit a little larger than what I was expecting but not too big. The fabric is so soft and light. I get compliments when I wear them. They are also a little longer than expected. I am 130 5'4"" athletic build, the length goes mid thigh. I got the mustard color to change this up from my usual pallet of colors and it goes nicely with most colors I usually wear. The only down side I have found is a pulling and piling of the inner fabric. It makes tiny balls at the hem at the bottom of the leg and a little inside touching the leg."
4.0,i love the shirt and of course the words on it ha ha. the only bad thing i have to say is that i wish i sized up it is very small cut but I intend yo make it work . Just make sure you size up especially if you are top heavy or even have a C-cup or higher.
4.0,"Fits good, nice lightning"
4.0,"Pretty dress, just too small in the chest area for me."
4.0,"I purchased a 4T and it was just a tad small on my 4 year old daughter, who typically wears 4T.  The top fit fine, but the bottoms didn't cover her bottom as well as I expected.  She suit itself is well made and my daughter loves it.  I do wish that the top covered the belly, but not that big of a deal."
4.0,Love the dress but the pockets on these dresses could have been left out due to them making the dress bulge on the sides.
4.0,its a great little wallet so far.
4.0,"This asymmetrical denim shirk has a lot going on.  Though it’s cut-off at the bottom, it’s been sewn, so there should not be too much additional fraying.  Of course is all depends upon how / where you measure it.  . but. .  .from top-to-bottom in the front on the “short” side, it’s 23”.  The fabric is 99% cotton and 1% spandex.  There is very little stretch.  It has a very “traditional” denim feel, so it’s not super soft.  Make sure you note the “gape” in the back.  There are two front pockets and two back pockets.  There is a button fly, and yes, you have to unbutton to take this skirt off/on.  Made in Vietnam."
4.0,I loved them!!! Perfect fit. Not too high not too low. Somewhere in between junior and granny panties lol.. very nice cut abd fit overall. I need a new pack now. With diffrent colors.
4.0,"This shirt is lovely-the colors are just beautiful-but, I ordered a medium and it was too big-will be reordering in a small!<br />The material is buttery soft-overall this is a beautiful shirt!"
4.0,It is very pretty. Nice color!
4.0,I bought this as an accessory to a peacock Halloween costume. I bought some extra feathers to glue on there with a glue gun and it worked perfectly! It was a nice base. I bought a package of 50 more feathers to make it look like mine. The straps were also loose enough to flip down just incase I didn't want my tail up. It caught wind very easily so sometimes it went down all by itself. It was definitely the best piece of my costume.
4.0,"I am very pleased with this tightner.  It works well. It fits my bra perfectly and that may be the key to it working well.  My bra band is a 30 and choices are limited. For years I've tried to sew or glue more hooks on my bras but it always broke due to the tension. I put this on my sports bra. Lunaire style 1111. I got the 3/4 three hook one. I was concerned it would break while I was wearing it at the gym but I've worn it twice now with no problem. I really do think the key is making sure your bra and hooks work really well together.  The metal never bothers my back. For the first time I didn't have back pain or shoulder pain because I had a tight band on my bra. It is so hard for me to find a good fitting bra. I  have tried hundreds.  I'm different cup sizes in different brands,Usely around an G but my band size rarely changes. Even though I have found a few regular bras I like, I never really found a sports bra besides Lunaire. It's so nice to have found this tightner that is almost lined up perfectly with my bra band hooks so I can keep wearing  it. Instead of taking the tightner off to put it on another bra, I will just get another tightner. I don't want to bother it once it's on - not sure of it's durability."
4.0,Its a nice size to fit in small gym lockers. It looks small but holds a lot.
4.0,"These are very pretty gold-plated turquoise earrings. They are lightweight and fit my ear well. They curve inward and extend past my ear lobe. They stay in place. When looking straight in the mirror, I don't always notice the earrings. It's only when I turn my head to the side that they stand out. The post is sturdy. I can see myself wearing these earrings for all different occasions. I would even feel comfortable wearing them to work."
4.0,Color is great!! Fits true to size. Great price. Arrived in 2 days with regular shipping
4.0,Fits well; links are a little loose and am waiting to see how secure they are.
4.0,"Simple stringer. I wanted this for these muggy days when i had to throw a shirt on to go to the store. Fits loosely and os comfortable. Ordered a large, tag says xl.<br /><br />Im 6' 195lbs."
4.0,Cuts into thighs and creates ugly bulges but offers great compression.
4.0,"This is a nice button up long sleeve. It is a looser fitting shirt, so I'd recommend to size down for a more fitted look. The fabric is very soft and not too thin at all. I wouldn't call it a dress shirt, but it can definitely be worn for a more casual look."
4.0,Nice hat at a great price. True to Amazon’s photo and description. A little tighter than I would like but wearable and warm. The Pom Pom is a very very soft and nice fake fur. All in all quite pleased.
4.0,"The look is great, the style is great, I have bigger hips/thighs and a smaller waist so was a little hesitant but it worked out.  I'm sure I won't get too many wearings out of these but the price was right for that."
4.0,I wore these as I got married barefoot on the beach in Maui! They were so pretty and made a beautiful noise as I walked. I felt like a gypsy! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the toe loop on one of them broke about halfway through the night (I was barefoot the entire time). Overall I loved them and they were the perfect touch to my dream wedding!
4.0,I LOVE this dress! It is a bit looser than I thought it would be.  The fabric is super soft and the length is just perfect.  I have gotten compliments already.
4.0,The color was darker than shown in photo. Was too large also but maybe I should have ordered a smaller size. Cute fit. It's longer than I anticipated also. Just above the knee and I'm 5'10.  Ordered an XL but should have gotten a L. Material is okay. Overall good buy for the price.
4.0,It's a great dress.  Very comfortable and love the material.  I'm short and bottom heavy.  Probably not the best style for my body type.
4.0,Fits like a normal hat and as expected. Bought this to keep my face out of the sun and works fine.
4.0,Thg he only problem I had was the hat when dry was so light that a gust of wind would blow it off my head.
4.0,Gorgeous tol runs a little big
4.0,I JUST HAD SHOULDER SURGERY. I'M NORMALLY A 2X BUT WANTED 3X FOR MY RECOVERY. THESE ARE A FULL 3X.<br />GOOD QUALITY SHIRT
4.0,We purchased this prescription pad as a graduation gift.  It was what we expected. No problems with the order.  Delivery was prompt and the item was packed nicely.
4.0,"I like the color of the top and the fabric but the shirt doesn't wow me enough to order a second one, even though there are a variety of colors."
4.0,"I purchased this backpack for a diaper bag.  We are very active and minimal type parents.  I only take what I need (juice, water, diapers and wipes)  This backpack is able to hold everything I need (including a 32 ounce juice bottle) and more.  There are plenty of pockets to put small items in like spoons and band aids, in the large pocket, theres a  pocket that I can keep the diapers separate from everything else.  On the outside, theres a mesh pocket for a bottle for easy access.  I like the chest clip and adjustable straps too that are adequately padded.  The color is on point too (i ordered pink) The backpack isnt super water proof as I got stuck in a monsoon at Hershey park in July and the water accumulated at the bottom of the pack.  Since I dont keep diapers there, it was no big deal.  The bag dried out very quick.  I dont recommend washing it in a washing machine, it slightly compromised the lining but that also was no big deal.  Between the water accumulation and the washing machine incident is why I gave it a 4 star review.  But, when this bag is demolished, I will replace it with another because I love it this much!"
4.0,Showed too much sideways. Returned
4.0,Came as described.  I am a size nine and they fit but barely so I would recommend size up. Other than that cute shoe.
4.0,"These are super comfortable but run small in the waist.  I wear a size 12 and had to order a medium, which is still a little large on me."
4.0,it's a good price with just an okay fit
4.0,Smaller than expected. I thought it was bigger as it looked like what was needed. Can’t use it for everyday use.
4.0,"So far so good&#34;,,, hard to get used to at first. Ink will last but becomes distorted if wet."
4.0,"Not a super-soft fleece, but it's warm and gets the job done. Slightly smaller than expected, so order a size up. Vibrant white color, which is nice. Overall it was a good buy."
4.0,I'm a petite 5'4. Full bust and small waist. This dress definitely suits anyone with curves in the right places!! My only gripe is the material is thin. It is soft & silky though. I'd suggest wearing a another layer of lingerie if you find it too see through. Otherwise a great buy!!
4.0,I liked the way the dress was so Comfortable
4.0,"I like it a lot, more than I thought I would. Not plastic, it is durable and heavy metal and fit perfectly on my friend's index finger. didn't need adjusting, though I expect to adjust it would be a bit difficult and would require pliers."
4.0,The polarization and mirror finish is amazing. These lenses are more than half the thickness of the original lenses and they were not cut to fully fit there are gaps between the frames and lenses as shown in the photos
4.0,Like the way they fit.
4.0,Cute but wasn’t for me.
4.0,"am thinking this is the first review for the lace cover-up.  am normally a 1 - 2X so  feared an xl would be way too small.<br />to my surprise it is not skimpy, just the opposite. is an abundance of soft lace and drapes nicely, but just too much of it to be flattering.  the xl would fit up to 3x easily imo.  it is a cute style and well made, but would suggest sizing down at least one.  I bought the black in XL but am buying the white one in a size L.<br />just measured - the xl is 34&#34; across the bottom which hits just below the hip. the length in pic is quite accurate (5'5&#34;).<br />it is see thru and too short to be a dress, but is a fun, trendy addition to wardrobe.<br />perfect for us plus-size gals to wear over simple almost-too-small  long-sleeve dresses to hide an imperfect middle."
4.0,"runs a little small, but a size up would be to large."
4.0,"Soft lace dress.  well made.  it is very fitted at waist but not too tight.  Really liked item but it had a snag so I had to return, but otherwise very good quality formal for a very low price."
4.0,It was a gift but it looked nice in its pouch and my niece loved it when she opened it up!
4.0,Very practical.....
4.0,"The fit is a little tight, but not too bad."
4.0,"Loved this dress, got tons of compliments. It’s realy comfortable too. Would give it 5 stars but it wrinkles easily. Besides that it’s a great dress!!"
4.0,"i like the leggings but wish there was at least a small scrunch or seam at the butt so it can be more flattering. since the fabrics on the thicker side the compression flattens my butt lol.<br />im 5’4 150, slim muscular build and got small but would pick medium forsure and would probably be more flattering"
4.0,These are so cute and I get compliments on every pair. The one I was looking forward to wearing the most however I can’t use. It’s been nearly a year and I can’t get the little bead off the barbell to put them in. Overall I’m very satisfied.
4.0,"Extremely disappointed with the box, I was expecting the robust Citzen box, but the store sent the watch in this very poor quality, damaged paper box. No instruction manual from Citzen, and from what I saw the warranty is by the store itself."
4.0,I have wanted a Heathergem necklace ever since I saw a clip on how they were made.  There is a shop in Gatlinburg that sells them but are often sold out. I order on line so sight unseen but I was very happy with the necklace. Would order from them again. The only down side in that the chain was tangle and even after I carefully uncinked it the chain broke the first time I wore it.
4.0,It fits as expected and I like it along with the smiley face on the bottom of the yoga pants.
4.0,Just the right size. Easy to find in my purse since it is red
4.0,"This top is really cute, and the tie dye is pretty and well-represented in the photos.  My problem is that it is definitely NOT a sweatshirt, which is what I wanted; it is a very soft but very thin tee shirt material.  The cuffed sleeves do make it more like a pajama top...not exactly what I'd want for Spring outings. I'm 5'3"", 150 lbs., and the Medium was generous and loose."
4.0,"It's very beautiful,but the clippers makes my ears hurt,can't wear them all day!"
4.0,"The watch looks gorgeous, but the strap is just too short. I have average width wrists, and it just fits. Will be short for larger wrists."
4.0,Cute choker I just wish it shined more.
4.0,"I love this hat, and it fits as expected. However, since it is designed for men, the front part is a little bit large for my head (I have a relatively small head and I'm a girl). Anyway, I still love it."
4.0,"This is warm, a nice 'fluffy' knit and looks like image. I got LUCKY.<br /><br />Good buy. : )"
4.0,Perfect size. It came in a little carrying bag (which I don't really care for). Looks just like the picture.
4.0,Nice product - run small
4.0,I love the shirt. It is way too big and not the colour I expected but it is a nice shirt. I kept it and  I just ordered another one.
4.0,Love the product but it was too long
4.0,Up close the material is more like a canvas. I still love it and it’s sturdy. Good price.
4.0,"It is a bit bulky for a small female wrist. And the silicone grips tightly around the wrist even when not set on a tight setting so I tend to move it around a bit to loosen it up from my skin often. Otherwise, really good quality and works great. It also does not collect lint and dust so I like that."
4.0,A little bit wide but maybe I have a small head. Ha!
4.0,"Cute pattern, well made, quality fabric, and holds all my hair. The only downside is that if you wear your scrub cap over the top of your ears, like me, it starts to hurt after just an hour or two. I’ve tried loosening the toggle but then it feels like it’s about to fall off. This isn’t a problem I’ve experienced with my other scrub caps so I don’t believe it’s a sensitivity issue."
4.0,"The hat itself is good quality, the color of the glow is more of a green,cyan-ish. He uses it for work and claims its nice. He really likes it, and i too enjoy seeing it. 4 stars mainly because i was expecting the blue glow rather than the color we did receive."
4.0,It is really big bag. I use it as an overnight bag. So if you are looking for a big bag this is it!
4.0,"I really wanted to love this because it's insanely cute, looks good on me, and is very comfortable, a combination which is not always easy to achieve. Unfortunately, I have very pointy nipples. This requires a particular kind of shirt that works for me without having to add anything other than a bra underneath. At first I thought this was one of them, but sadly, not. Unless I want to look like a 90's Charmed girl, I have to wear a t-shirt bra or nipple cover to wear this sweater, which I don't always feel like doing. So, while it's cute and quality, there is that one detriment that I remain a bit bummed about."
4.0,My husband chose this dress for me. He did good!! Perfect for work.
4.0,"It’s so freaking cute!! It’s been a few weeks since I’ve bought it and it’s still in tact! Lol though, I’d wish the price was a little lower, but all in all, very nice product !"
4.0,This is a very comfortable and convenient wristband. Makes it so easy to put on and off and it is not as stiff as a lot of the other ones. Great value for the price.
4.0,"I love these shoes. They're supposed to be just for my hospital bag but they didn't make it. I'm wearing them now and I love them! I haven't worn them a lot, but they're super comfy."
4.0,"The top of my suit fit perfectly, but the bottoms are snug. I planned on wearing boyshort bottoms anyway, but for the cost of the suit I would recommend it."
4.0,Nice comfortable great looking summer hat. I really like it!
4.0,Super comfortable. They fit as expected. The only thing wrong with these is that they were a little stingy with the denim in the pocket area. 99% of the time the white part shows because there isn't enough denim when you're walking around.
4.0,"Quality constructed with a heavy canvas fabric, it has plenty of pockets and fits well inside my FRYE tote, however wish it was an inch taller and that the inside was same light color as outside and not dark brown."
4.0,I love this my only complaint is it was difficult getting the ashes in through the funnel. I ended up not using the funnel but love the necklace!
4.0,"I bought this bracelet for the magnetic properties. It does mostly what I had hoped it would do. Reduces pain in fingers/thumb. It looks fine and I wear it all the time, even with my big bold citrine bracelet. The jade is mild so it can really go with anything. I have used magnetic bracelets for over 6 years now, because they do work. Just wish someone would make the magnet stronger and get creative with rings. Try it, give it a chance and it will work. There really good for carpal tunnel syndrome and I have something in my wrist that without the bracelet I was going to the chiropractor every week to get relief. Don't now."
4.0,This style is more for girls.
4.0,These glasses are comfortable and lightweight. The lenses do exactly what they are supposed to do. My vision is clear with no distortion. The product description says that the order contains a case and a cleaning cloth but these were not included.
4.0,"Really cute fitbit Flex 2 bracelet.  Not expensively made, but because its stainless steel should hold up okay.  Very good looking on."
4.0,"I loved it, she liked it but not as much as I did.  It's a very nice fabric, very smooth and looks comfortable.  I thought the fit was very, very flattering for her.  The color (purple) was also nice.  It was bright but not obnoxiously so.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure why she doesn't like it as much as I do, but what are you gonna do?  That's why 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,"I love the glasses, however, for me the reader is in the wrong place. I'm used to progressive lenses and getting re-used to a bifocal is a challenge. I'm going to keep them because they're terrific for every other outdoor activity."
4.0,I fits like a night shirt more than a dress. It's very comfortable. It can be worn as a bathing suit cover up with flip flops or around the house. It's probably not ideal for a dinner date.
4.0,It is a cute set. The top is a little on the small side. The pants fit well.
4.0,"It looks as described,fix right ."
4.0,Expensive for six pair and it took a bit to get here I’m in California they shipped from Tennessee. But I do like them very comfortable will buy them again
4.0,"Way too short-waisted for me. It is also very short. I'd love it if they would make these same dresses longer waisted (by 2&#34;) and longer in the lenght by about 3-4 inches. Not everyone has the legs shaped for short dresses and older women like these styles too, but with a longer length. Otherwise a beautiful dress."
4.0,The charm was a little bigger than I thought I should have read the measurements before i bought but i really thought it was really pretty
4.0,"Like the strap, but wish it was a bit thicker. Also dont like that loop keepers dont kep the strap in. It tends to come out of htose keepers."
4.0,I really liked this pants. It's pretty comfy on days I just want to chill.  One drawback is the length and cheap material.
4.0,I love this shirt!!! The fit is more of a halter than what the picture shows so I recommend for those with larger chests to size up! The shirt feels high quality and I love the thank you note they included in the order. It seems really well thought out!
4.0,"head strap good, 3 light settings"
4.0,"Good and comfortable shoe, straps are just a bit long on the toe part so I can’t tighten enough without dragging the ground. And if I cut the excess, they will fray."
4.0,"Love the price and flexibility of the watch with the multiple band colors. You get (5) different watches for the price of one. Very easy to detach bands from watch via small lever connected to both bands. I recommend this watch, especially to larger frame guys as the face is a true 47 or 48 mm."
4.0,Fits great and looks just like the picture
4.0,It looks really good and I got a lot of positive comments. It was not a generous 2x.
4.0,It super cute and looks good on anyone. A little see through but a great option.
4.0,The jacket looks good and fit well and has kept my dad warm during the initial winter months. Will have to see how well it will work on the coming months.
4.0,"Cute top and actually pretty good quality considering the price.  My only complaint is it is a little shorter than I normally would wear.  I am 5'9&#34; and 170lbs with a long torso so I ordered the Large and the front of the shirt barely covered the top of my pants (the back portion is longer than the front).  Again, a cute top for the price but if you are long like myself, keep that in mind."
4.0,my 3 year old loves them :)
4.0,"I really like this, it’s light weight perfect for CA weather. Beware of the size though. I am 5’3” 129 lbs size small, size 2. I bought the size small, but it it came labeled JP small which I’m guessing is Japan size small because the sticker said US Xs<br />The xs fit but snug. Keeping it because it is still cute and comfortable. 4 stars because they mislabeled the sizing."
4.0,"Fit is larger than normal, but still a cool shirt!"
4.0,Looks just like Oakley just a little thinner material. Nice quality though!
4.0,Solid belt will stretch out on you in the first couple wearings but solid belt for the price.
4.0,"The product itself was great! It took longer to ship than I thought it would, but great hat!"
4.0,It’s beautiful just like the picture
4.0,I lobed the fit.
4.0,"I wear 32C.  I ordered a black medium.  The bra is padded, but the pads do come out, at least on the black one.  the cups could be bigger, but overall I'm pleased.  I think the problem is that the straps are too short.  I'm 5'3"", and they're short on me, so take caution if you're tall."
4.0,"I wanted to use something other than my aviators when I ordered these glasses. But unfortunately, the headline claimed they were unisex or for men and women, and they only had pictures of the glasses, which didn't look as girly as in person.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed when I received them because they are for women, and my wife doesn't even like to wear glasses.<br /><br />Now that I have returned to write the review, I noticed they added some women's pictures to the description. If I had known these glasses were for women, I wouldn't have ordered them.<br /><br />It's a shame. The color's beautiful, and the packaging is lovely and giftable, but I needed something else as a guy.<br /><br />I'm taking a star off for that reason, but they're great, and the color blue is so beautiful!"
4.0,"The tights are durable and fit well. However, the whole for the foot to come through is very tight."
4.0,"Looked at these at the eye care center and they wanted $250 for these frames. Checked Amazon and got them almost half the price. The only problem is, that the glass is narrow and with bifocals.the clear space is smaller. This isn't a big deal, just takes a little getting used to for distance."
4.0,Really cute. They seem like a warmer alternative to just socks...and much easier than getting a baby foot into a shoe.
4.0,"Very nice watch for an excellent price! Arrived when they said it would, too. My only complaint is that it's not a Rolex... :-)"
4.0,Good quality and exactly fit the description of what I ordered.
4.0,"It's much longer than it appears in the picture (or, more likely, I am much shorter than the model!) That means it won't work with the dress I bought it to wear with - but it's a nice light layer for cool spring evenings and I've had a hard time finding cotton sweaters so I'm also not sending it back."
4.0,"These are sturdy and very nice.  The wheels are fantastic and make traveling 100% easier!  My only complaint is that while they do nest inside each other for storage (a must!), it is a really tight fit with the wheels sticking out and the rounded corners that pull over on the top.  I'm strong, others will really struggle.  It would be INCREDIBLE if someone offered wheels that fold down for storage and while putting in the overhead bins.<br /><br />The plastic seemed cheap (sounds like crinkling paper) but has held up well so far.  I've used several times now and am very happy.  I need all three sizes for different trips and needs."
4.0,"Wear and wash well, can't beat the price!"
4.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and I typically wear a 14/16, 36DDD bra. I ordered this in blue, size XL and it fits nicely. It stretches a bit across the chest and the fabric shows a little white underneath. I wore a navy blue camisole underneath and that helps. The length is great, hits at the bottom of my ankle (where typically maxi dresses will hit a little above my ankle). The pockets are nice and deep, I can put my phone in without worrying it will slip out. It's comfortable and pretty. Easy to wear. Definitely will be a regular rotation for the rest of the summer."
4.0,"Definitely order at least a size larger than usual. The pants are a bit more tapered than in the picture. The fabric is thick and good quality. I do like them and plan on ordering more, perhaps in a different style."
4.0,Cute and comfortable. For the price they are a nice pair of sandals. Fast shipping. They are a tad smaller than I expected but they look ok. I ordered a size 11 and usually wear a woman's 10.5 or 11 in most shoes/sandals.
4.0,It's thinner than I expected but nice.
4.0,Arrived wrinkled but is still a great shirt
4.0,"A little small for a bigger girl,  but I like it. Definitely fun to wear on those days when a coat is too heavy."
4.0,Worked out great for a gala fundraiser I attended. Was super comfortable. Was a little larger than expected.
4.0,"I like the orange and turquoise stripe.  I plan to wear it to UT football games, maybe with a belt and boots.  It is not lined.  When held up to the light, it is a bit see through.  But when it is on, the pattern helps hide that, so I hope it will be OK.  The fit is forgiving and comfortable.  The off-the-shoulder design may wind up driving me crazy but I am going to give it a shot.  For the money, it is a cute and easy option that could be styled several ways."
4.0,"Larger than expected but I am tiny and there was no XS.<br />Nice and I would buy it again. As in other reviews there are thin plastic pieces on the straps to make them adjustable. These, I can see, will break but a quick stick and all will be fine. Better to have them like this so the fit is right for you, I think.<br />Exactly as expected only a little big on my small frame."
4.0,"A little long! Wish I would have went with a small but I roll them once and they’ll do! Super cute cut. 127 pounds, 5’5 ordered medium."
4.0,"Very beautiful, and nice material, and  my size is 42 D, reading the comments and reviews of this product, I noted that it was small size, so I ordered a 44 D, considering that the cup was the same, but does not correspond to the cup D, I should have been a 44-DD."
4.0,"They are nice, but they are so light they get caught in my hair."
4.0,The mask thing with the striped hose is well made but strange part of the costume. It is  of a steampunk pirate.
4.0,The gloves are the perfect addition to our girl's Power Ranger outfit! They are lightweight and easy to put on. We have not worn them outside to test the durability... Light fabric. Foam in the upper part to help hold the structure.
4.0,"Thin material is great for warm weather. Needs a gentle wash, gentle detergent, and hang dry to extend the life of the cheap fabric. At $12.95 thi skirt is a good value, but I would not pay any more for this skirt and I do not expect the skirt to survive this spring/summer season in good enough condition to be worn in 2019.<br /><br />The length is very nice, I am a pear shaped 5'5&#34; woman who sizes up to US 12 to fit my hips and a Size Large in this skirt fits nicely, especially if I pull the skirt down to my hips. The stretch is good, the fabric is not sheer for the Black skirt."
4.0,"It’s very stretchy. So, ladies with big boobs should choose more sustaining material that doesn’t stretch so much."
4.0,"bought this as a gift for a Pug lover.  She was happy to receive, said it looked nice and she can't wait to use it."
4.0,"I love these! Really cute! Only negative is the dangle ones with the bar that goes through the tunnel, it's too many pieces. The balls that screw on are small and easy to drop or lose. A little too much work put in to wear something.  Otherwise, I'm happy with this product."
4.0,"I love this top! Initially, i was disappointed to discover the fabric is fairly light weight. However, I quickly got over that. The larger/plus sizing is accurate. I like everything about it and plan to buy other Jess & Jane items."
4.0,The belt fits well and is easy to use. The gray is lighter than I expected
4.0,"I like this waist trainer. It works well as a back brace for improving posture if I am going to be sitting at the computer for a lengthy amount of time. Haven't attempted to use it to lose weight. Very easy to put on/ take off, and adjustable."
4.0,"This piece worked for my angel Halloween costume. Although the wings felt flimsy to the touch, once they were on it was fine. They stayed up all night, and even when people were knocking on them, they held up well. I'm not sure they will make it to next Halloween, but good for a night!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, shipped quickly, and design is true to the picture. However, the colors are off in that the light pink is VERY VERY pink. That's the only reason I gave this product 4 stars."
4.0,Really comfy. Just a little bit long
4.0,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas. She wears a size 8 in juniors. I ordered her a 9, and they fit kinda snug. I wish the straps were adjustable."
4.0,Shirt is kind of short so it looks bad when it’s big yet short. If it was form fitting it would be so adorable. Nothing great about the feel of it or the quality so it should be solely bought on the design alone.
4.0,"Very Good product.  Lights are very bright.  Only negative, I received item batteries were dead."
4.0,"I’m 5,1” and 158 pounds (1 month postpartum) and it is a bit large for me, but i’m using it anyway"
4.0,All the buttons fell off after washing it.  It's snug in the arms.  But's it cute.
4.0,"Bought a size Large (normally size Medium) after reading through all the reviews to gauge sizing. It gave me a slightly loose, comfortable, and casual chic look of a sweatshirt dress. Length-wise it was about an inch above my knee (5’5”, 153lbs, hourglass figure). Probably could’ve gotten away with a Medium for a more fitted look but I haven’t washed it yet so wanted to be prepared for shrinkage. Bought the Sunflower design in dark gray which is super cute and the material is like a thin sweatshirt but still very comfortable."
4.0,"This is a beautifully made wallet and just the size I was looking for. The only thing I didn't like was that it is not the brown color it appears to be. I was so excited to move things out my old wallet and into this, I did it in a darkened room. Later, when outside, I looked and it appeared maroon. I really do not like maroon, wine, or burgundy, but now that I have opened it I doubt I will try to return it. It really is the perfect design."
4.0,I like this case a lot. It's so cute and I like the little wristlet strap.  It's holding up well.  There's really not room to put much money and cards in with the phone to use it as a wallet. You may be able to fit a card or two and a couple bills - but I don't use it that way.  It holds the phone well.  The little stylus it comes with is cute but the only place to attach it is on the magnetic clasp and mine is starting to look a bit worn from doing that.  I do have one small problem with this case and that is the magnet - it makes it impossible to use the stylus that came with the phone - the magnet interferes with it.
4.0,I like the style and the fit for the gym but was advised to buy a size up and it is a little too big.
4.0,no me gustó la luz que trae incorporada porque no deja ver en la noche la hora
4.0,"It's great for the price!  Took the chain off (to ornate), but love the way it looks and fits."
4.0,"Love the length and the way they fit but after 4 months the stitching is starting to fall apart. For as cheap as they were I'm not mad about it, I'll definitely buy another pair"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a5b6839affcce032eee9f2ddd1a7f3a1]] Soft, stretchy, medium on the compression level fits true to size.  Very Flattering on the curves.  The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 is because holy camel toe!  I own 2 other pairs, diff styles of aoxjox leggings and didn’t have this issue before."
4.0,"Beautiful watch, sadly I thought it's going to be color like it's on pic but I got it in gray! They should put color options not just put one color on the pic and then sell different, who still reads little print?!"
4.0,"Great pants had to get the length tailored, and I'm tall"
4.0,"This mostly-cotton underwear is comfortable and fits mostly as expected, if more on the ""roomy"" side than tight. It appears to be relatively well made, though the fabric is thinner than you might expect, so I'd expect it to last 6-12 months of regular use before starting to fray a bit.<br /><br />Be aware that the ""Grey-pink-print-violet-stripe-black"" color includes two pairs that are slightly more violet than pink (one darker than the other). Good news for kids who dislike pink, but if you're a fan of pink, be aware that it leans notably toward violet."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely perfect for spring/summer! It’s lightweight, it’s float and best of all it hides trouble tummy! The material is a polyester blend but it is still very soft and comfortable. This dress washes well but does wrinkle a bit. I would definitely suggest using a fabric steamer. Overall super cute dress!"
4.0,Love the style of the choker.Wish the gold could be at least 10karat because the minute anything less hits my skin..instant tarnish and discoloration.Would you ever consider using real gold in your chokers?I would pay more for that!!
4.0,The color is vibrant nice  hoodie  runs a little big about half size good purchase
4.0,"Pink lenses with black rims are perfect for everyday wear in Florida summer sun.  Perfect fit and feel. Look great on. Exactly the quality, look, and coverage I expected for the price.  Would buy again and recommend to others."
4.0,"I love the Googles, nose and ear piece is too tight and useless. Overall, it is good buy."
4.0,This shirt fits great and the bottom material feels really nice. The lace on top looks a bit cheap but it washes well and feels nice.
4.0,Was a gift and she loved it!
4.0,It is very comfortable and not too hot to wear in summer.
4.0,"Quite good quality overall, the latex of course came a little bent out of shape but nothing anyone couldn't fix"
4.0,"Credit card slots too tight!  I feel like they will loosen with wear.<br />I liked credit card slots on top of checkbook cover on a previous model.<br />Overall, I love the all leather Buxton billfold."
4.0,Very soft and comfy. Material looks thin. It is squatproof but doesn’t hide party lines.
4.0,Looks nice quality is excellent
4.0,Not a bad ring at all looks as described fits well
4.0,Nice but reminds me of a men’s shirt
4.0,"These are decent gloves and they do keep you warm in 0-20° weather (which is when id wear them) for several hours. These, however, are NOT work gloves. If you need to handle rough materials and do heavy duty work in them, they will not even last a day. I made the mistake of attempting to use them as work gloves. They're just not durable enough for that."
4.0,"I am not sure of the actual wool content since there is no description on the packaging, and they are thin rather than thick, but they do keep my feet warm. My one complaint is they are quite large for my size 7 feet... It would probably fit better for size 9-10 women's. However, I am just wearing them inside boots so it's not too big of a problem. Overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,Watch was quick to arrive and easy to set up for use. Not flashy but just what was wanted
4.0,They are really tiny! But otherwise beautiful.
4.0,Very cute.  The only drawback is the stand out about a 1/4&#34; from the ear so her attention was brought to having them on.  Knowing they were there she kept pulling on her ears.  We took them off and put flat earrings in.  We will put these back in when she's older.  She's only a year so we chose safety
4.0,Great feel!  It feels like I’m going commando without having to deal with getting chaffed up by the insides of my jeans.
4.0,"Very cute, fit as expected. Took a star off bc I ordered the light tan and it was much darker."
4.0,I do understand that we have a pandemic and people like to up the price a little bit but I guess the price was fair and we use it because of the pandemic at least it protects us somewhat from the other people if they have the virus.
4.0,"Though I do not understand how or if magnetic therapy works, I find it interesting, and certainly something worth trying at this very  reasonable cost. I wondered if it would have a rubber smell, and I do not find any smell with it at all.  I put it on and find it so comfortable, I barely notice it's on.  The clasp is easy to connect (magnetically) and does not come apart easily.  It's ideal for a man or woman.  I look forward to trying it long term and seeing how it works.<br /><br />****This review is in participation with the Amazon Simple Review Program and I received this item in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Got this for a ski trip my daughter went on. Kept her head warm and dry! She loved it and wore it everyday of the trip.
4.0,it was cute but the stone is not completely glues down flat.
4.0,They work great! They really do the only down side is they pinch the nose and hurt after 6hrs.
4.0,"Fit is good. 5'8 165 and got a large and it was good size, didn't give me a frontal wedge"
4.0,I bought this one because does not have the leather adornments on it.  The leather does not go good with water.  This band replaced the nylon style band that originally came with my watch.  It was a little hard to get it on but that was not the fault of the new band. I only rated it 4 stars because the resin bands usually get brittle and crack in a couple of years of wearing them 24 hours a day.
4.0,"This is a cute top. However, the material isn’t as stretchy as I would like for yoga"
4.0,Super cute light summer dress that’s not see through- my only issue is they sent me the wrong size 🤦🏻‍♀️
4.0,"Perfect for my husbands bathroom.  The colors correspond to his Fraternity colors and sets off the bathroom perfectly.,"
4.0,Inexpensive and served its purpose
4.0,"Great sunglasses, but extremely dark"
4.0,Love the dress except the zipper at the bottom is uncomfortable and bulgy for me. 5’7” and a small fits perfect
4.0,Lovely dress.  Made well and good price
4.0,Looking for dress socks to wear to work and these socks are perfect. Not too thin and not too expensive.
4.0,"Very nice color, my mother really liked them."
4.0,These are holding up ok considering they are on my 21 month old and he’s not exactly the most graceful of walkers. I got this for when we go to the pool and beach so he doesn’t tear up his toes. I had another pair during the summer for when we went tubing. My only complaint is that they should make it thicker or have more protection around the toes as the fabric get holes easily there.
4.0,Love the fit and the design! I am fond of those and they seem legit
4.0,Definitely a very fitting dress. I love the way it looked besides from the cups on the dress. The only problem are the cup size. If your over a D then expect your boobs not to fit the cups no matter the size you order
4.0,"Slightly small, but wearable.  Could have been more material for the triangles that make up the chest.  Made for dress sitting awkward at size they are.<br /><br />That being said, this was super comfy and I got so many compliments on it."
4.0,Fit is small. I wesr a medium and I ordered a large and it fits more like a small.
4.0,"fits my wife pretty well. got a few different colors and the bow popped off one of them, but can be sewn on"
4.0,Good material.  Cool design.
4.0,"This bathing suit fit a little snug (even after I sized up), but it is a great buy.  It does not fit as expected, make sure to size one or 2 sizes up.  I thought a medium would work, but a large ended up fitting better.  I am 5'5, 160 lbs.  This was flattering, and hides in all the right places if you are looking for something with a bit of coverage.  The top is loose and the bottoms have decent coverage as well.  I think for the price it is worth it, if you are looking to get a bathing suit a a reasonable price."
4.0,"Feel great, look great, just a tad on the loose side and I followed the sizing instructions.  As they are supposed to be compression shorts, perhaps order a size down.  Not quite the same size as other pairs I have are a bit tighter, but a different design."
4.0,"The mask looks pretty good and makes a good costume, but it probably is not practical for wear longer than about an hour or so. The eyes look realistic, but . . . they way they are positioned makes it very hard to see out. The only place to see out is above and to the side of the eyes, which is awkward. Not sure how this could be solved, but it does create a problem. Coloring is good and fits well, however it gets hot quickly.  Overall its good for the intended use, which is short term wear."
4.0,A good size that ll last for a while
4.0,I love these pants and being that they are super cheap is a plus! Rated 4 stars because for me it runs a little big being that i have a small waist and bigger hips i ordered a medium. Im 5'7 weighing 144.
4.0,Great shirt. Quality exceeded what I expected.
4.0,"A stylish shoe, true to size, breaks in easily. Not very breathable so that distracts from the comfort."
4.0,This looks Great on!!!!
4.0,Love the sizes. They help organize my luggage. The compression is great but you have to be careful closing or the zipper can catch on the sides.
4.0,Used as a dress for a choir performance. It was great. A little short but as my granddaughter had to climb up and down the risers it ended being great. The one star is the actual length.
4.0,These wayfarer sunglasses are good quality for a very good price. They look great and fit well. So far the hinges are good and tight. Over all these sunglasses are worth it.
4.0,"Great quality navel jewelry. Great size, and the stones are very nice colors. I would have liked to see maybe a more variety of colors, like pink or purple colors.<br />They are made great. The stones are tightly set, so no need to worry about the stone falling out. The bead unscrews and screws on easily, and stays on tightly.<br />Have not caused any time of irritation or have not had any type of bad reaction while wearing these.<br />They come individually packed, one to a bag.<br />They look great too!!"
4.0,"I like this bag. The size is perfect. I went from a very big, heavy bag to this smaller more light-weight bag and I love it. I'm still trying to figure out what to keep and what not to keep, but I love the multiple compartments that are easy to get to. I gave it four stars because I'm not crazy about the writing on it, but that's not a big deal overall. I recommend it!"
4.0,Me parecieron buenos lo malo que se descoloran con el sudor si no se los seca rápido
4.0,nice comfortable fit.
4.0,"Nice quality,  fits as expected.  Soft material"
4.0,"This is a gift for my daughter's 18th birthday.  I believe this will be a bracelet that my daughter will wear especially since she is attending an university that colors are blue and white.  It is an attractive piece of jewelry, without being overly outrageous."
4.0,"I followed the tip in the other reviews, and got them to work for a DW5600BB.  5-10 minutes gingerly trying to figure out the first one, then less than minute to put on the second one. The tips:<br /><br />(1) take off the bezel, it's just 4 screws.<br />(2) Use different/thinner spring bars. I had 16mm x 1.5 mm that came with the spring bar tool ($7 for the set here on Amazon.)<br />(3) once you have the second end of the spring bar inside the lug, then push down and toward the case.  FYI, I didn't here a click with either, but both are fully seated.<br /><br />Yes, the fit is not as snug as if you used the OEM spring bars, but good luck trying those.  They definitely looked too thick to pull it off."
4.0,did not have a pocket
4.0,"I live in Fairbanks, we know COLD here, these are a winner because the fact that they have a zipper pocket for a hand warmer to be placed inside. I searched high and low for that pocket.<br />I have older Gordini pairs that have held up through two boys with minimal wear/tear. I purchased these as a size up."
4.0,"absolutely adorable, good quality"
4.0,Bought XL. Run a little small. Not as comfortable as my popfit shorts.
4.0,"I really like these. BUT they only work in my second piercing wear my lobe starts to taper up towards the middle of my ear. It's not quite long enough to fit over my entire lobe at its widest part. I like how it looks in my second piercing, so it's not a big deal, but it would be nice if it were a tad longer."
4.0,This my 2nd Grace Karin dress. Love my first dress a bit more because it is sleeveless and felt more roomy in the shoulders than this one.Material has a very little bit of stretch but nice fabric. I am 5'3 125lbs and a 34 dd bust 28 inch waist. I bought a dark blue polka dotted medium. The top is fitted but not hard to zip. I just have to wear an unpadded bra and the fit is perfect. The waist is not tight at all. It comes to the bottom of my knee when standing.Very pretty and perfect for church. I wear a regular slip underneath. AZ summer too hot for anything else. Hope this helps!
4.0,"Very comfortable!, but you have to be careful what you wear underneath. You can see through a bit."
4.0,Nice bag. I really like the various interior pockets and the bag is a great size.
4.0,"Purse just as pictured with a less glittery shine,  a lovely sky blue. Sturdy leather that will not get dirty, scratched or damaged easily. More than enough space for cards, IDs pictures, money, coins, and not bulky with all that. Only challenge, the coin section zipper has malfunctioned a few times, in less than 2 weeks, I've just been carefully with it. Otherwise loving everything about the purse."
4.0,"Fit ok. But tighter than I would have preferred, I bought two sizes up from my normal small and still a bit tight."
4.0,"Great for the price. They did have an odor to it but not too bad that it bothered me. It was worse how bad they made my legs sweat. But $14 for faux leggings...can’t complain about that.<br />For reference I am 5-7”, 39” hips, 28” waist and usually a 6. Ordered medium and fit fine."
4.0,"Thought it would be good on a Friday at work, being casual. Unfortunately it is a Saturday or Sunday shirt. Appeared a little &#34;frumpy&#34;. Nice while I'm running around though."
4.0,Worked well for VBS
4.0,"This is an adorable jacket for my little paleontologist. I like that the hood zips off. It seems like its nice quality and the stitching is well done. It’s a good lightweight windbreaker, definitely not for really cold weather. Unfortunately the sizing was very off, so it didn’t even come close to fitting my 6 year old. Granted she is quite tall for her age, but the sleeves came up to about 3-4” above her wrist and didn’t come close to the top of her pants. This would have fit perfect when she was 3.<br /><br />Overall cute jacket and well made, but I wish the sizing was more accurate. Definitely size up 2 or more sizes if you’re considering this jacket."
4.0,Pink tiara defective:(
4.0,It's not as thick as I would have hoped but it definitely is nice and long
4.0,Smells
4.0,Works well for me to carry on pocket.
4.0,Bought one size up as suggested in other reviews.  I like this dress as it covers my arms yet feels like it will keep me cool for a summer semi- formal wedding.  The skirt portion came very wrinkled so I hope it will iron out easily.
4.0,"Perfect ! Very comfortable and the little pocket for keys is really useful, you can put your card in it too. The only bad point is that it's not dry-fit. If it gets wet, it stays wet for some time. Otherwise, good pants."
4.0,"way smaller than I thought it would be, still cool"
4.0,The girls love their knee socks.  They call them stockings and enjoy the bright colors and patterns.  Run a bit small and shrink a bit when dried.
4.0,It’s a cute lucky little charm. I love it!
4.0,Comfortable but could have been longer.
4.0,I look freaking handsome in this lol! I don't have any dislikes
4.0,"I got this for my 10 year old Granddaughter. She loves ""push-pop"" things. The purse is colorful and she plans to use it for her pool bag this summer. The eyes on the front and back are slightly creepy!! She loves the bag!!"
4.0,doesn't weight down ears a
4.0,"This is a good sandal, has good arch support ( a Birkenstock bed), however I should have listened to the information about the bed of the sandal being narrower than the original birkinstock. I am learning to really like these, and they feel good on my feet. The suede feels, but it can stretch so do watch for that. A size 38 in Birkenstocks is a size 8 Women't shoe, It is about a 7.5 in Betula. Please be aware of that. Otherwise the sandal is a very good one, well worth the money, and it feels nice on my feet."
4.0,Well received gift
4.0,This worked just fine for my Halloween costume. I cut the front down because I didn’t like it around me neck. But it fit my body great otherwise.
4.0,"I really like them, they don’t feel cheap and sturdy. I love them and definitely worth the money."
4.0,"This is a very attractive looking tie for the price, though the tie's pattern appears to be a fabric print."
4.0,"The model I had liked it so much she did not give it back to me... so I have to order it again, and this time get pictures of it on someone"
4.0,"Giving the dress 4 stars because it is just like the picture, the color is accurate and it is decently made with no loose threads or weird seams. It is slightly thin so you may want a slip but it isn't 100% necessary. I just don't like how it looks on me, it feels frumpy like I am wearing a nightgown. I purchased a large and I probably should of got a medium but I tend to order larger - that could be part of the reason I feel so frumpy in it. It is cute and can be accessorized to dress it up or down which I like. It's a nice dress for the price, just isn't for me."
4.0,"These are super comfy, maybe a touch small but cute…I had to fight my daughter to keep them"
4.0,Fabric is soft. Graphic isn't as nice as in the pic.
4.0,"They do fog up, but it's tolerable.  I really like the fit. Other masks slide all over my face, interfering with my vision. These stay in place."
4.0,"Nice skirt, but not “pleated.”"
4.0,I thought it would fit a little loose but it was form fitting so order up if you want it to look like the picture. However it is a very cute and well made shirt!
4.0,This is a fitted jacket on all the models. The large fit my chest and arms very well but was snug around my stomach and hips so I upped to the XL The cut around the arms and chest  is much much bigger. So my jacket gaps and looks ill fitted but there is plenty of room in the waist area and hips. ..but overall it will do.
4.0,The neckline on the blouse is not very flattering and does not cover up or hide bra straps very well. I just wore a different dirndl blouse and was good to go!
4.0,Great except for the clasp on the chain.
4.0,They put uncomfortable pressure behind my ears
4.0,My 6 year old loves his new shoes! Light weight and flat sole. I'd buy again.
4.0,"Got these for the coming winter, have only worn once, but met expectations as to fit and finish. I have had good experience with Wigwam socks before."
4.0,Great tee. Perfect if you love Minecraft. My daughter's friend loved it.
4.0,Well made. Fit perfectly. I didn't try it during shooting but hen I put it on I heard my wife's voice when she speaks on phone. That is reason for 4 star. I interesting how it reduce shooting voice. Maybe later I change my opinion to 5 stars (I hope).
4.0,"I like that very much. My only critique is it is too high, needs a lower profile."
4.0,"Only complaint was weight and limited amount of ashes that I was able to place in keepsake, It did ship quick and was beautiful."
4.0,I purchased  this dress thinking the material would be similar to another dress just like it. The material was very much different and didn't allow for much stretching room at all. The dress does look exactly as it was pictured. I ended up giving it to my mom who is a lot smaller than I am and it fit perfect for her. I will say that it is somewhat see through so you will need a darker undergarment to assist with that.<br />I received this dress at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,This dress is cute fit well good material. Comfortable
4.0,Its a great product but after a few wears the ribon not only broke but when it got snagged on something it cut my son
4.0,comfy and  can be dressed up a little more than a regular tee shirt.
4.0,Hubby liked it
4.0,It does run on the small side and the top is narrow. I bought the 5T for a tall 3.5 year old. It fit as expected thanks to reading the reviews. The quality isn’t bad and the long narrow top is worth it because this kid was thrilled to have Room on the Broom PJ’s.
4.0,I get so many compliments on this fun dress! Black tights and black mid rise boots make this outfit go fromthe office to drinks with no problem!!
4.0,Very cute and good luck also. I got a few to have a layered look.
4.0,"I loved the dress...just doesn't work with my body type.  It was too long and I couldn't hem it to look like the model wearing it or it would have left the pattern looking funky and just wrong.  So, if you're tall....get the dress. ;)"
4.0,Love these but they fall down frequently
4.0,"LIKE THESE JUST WISH THEY WERE ADJUSTABLE AS I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY NIECES AND NEWPHEWS.  THEY ARE CUTE THOUGH, WILL JUST HAVE TO BE CUT SMALLER FOR KIDS."
4.0,"The fit and material are comfortable; the pockets are a little high, which make you look broader at the top. I ordered two in different styles, but I was sent two of the same style. That was disappointing."
4.0,"I really like these. They are nice to pair with colorful and solid colored tops. These make your booty look really nice. I wore them in the water and they were not see through on me.I like that you can make them more or less sexy with the drawstrings on the side. I wear a size 18w and am 5'1, the XXL fits great and high waist on my frame."
4.0,"This was a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. He’s a medium so that’s what I ordered and it fits him but it’s a little smaller than they typical mediums he gets. The material of the printing is a little weird and we’re concerned about how it will hold up in the wash, but it looks and feels great overall."
4.0,"There are two delicate necklaces in this set. The circular studded one has a 16"" choker length chain that is adjustable to four lengths. However, I doubt anyone is skinny enough to be able to use all those adjustments. I had to use it on the longest length.  The long bar has a 20"" chain but extends an additional 4.5"" with the extra piece hanging at the end. This chain is adjustable to five lengths.  Both necklaces can be worn at once or separately. The long bar looks great on a solid colored turtleneck. The small necklace looks great just on a bare neck with almost any blouse as it sits right at the throat.<br /><br />I think the current price of $19.99 is competitive for this. Be aware that the chains are thin and are easily knotted. Care has to be taken when storing and wearing. This is definitely a very attractive but delicate adjustable necklace set."
4.0,"Very cute! But didnt realize! because models hair is in the way, but there is a large cow skull on the back! But still cute!"
4.0,"nice bag, looks good, sturdy zipper, good side pockets"
4.0,Love them! Get so many compliments on them. Only downside - hard to talk on the phone while wearing them
4.0,I have been using these in Kuwait and Afghanistan and the sun and sand is very harsh.  These glasses have performed very well and the foam lining has kept out most of the wind and sand.  Not quite as effective as a proper pair of goggles but a lot more comfortable and versatile.<br /><br />Wish you could change out the lenses though...and the hard case they come with should have an attached clip like the Oakley case.
4.0,"No me agradó  que la escritura es muy pequeña,  no se destaca."
4.0,"If you’re a Hippo lover, you’ll really enjoy the one little hippo who makes noice and lights up. Price point should be more like $5. I didn’t read the description thoroughly and thought it came with 3. You only get one. That’s the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars."
4.0,Product tightens to cover face nicely. Sometimes if it's too tight it will move towards the eyes. Great product!
4.0,Love the blouse but as with most dark clothing wash with darks only . The black dye runs very easily
4.0,"These are very cute, but the back is rather cheaply made. Worth the price though, but not the wait"
4.0,"Nice lightweight quality fabric. Fits a little too tight, but it's okay. I'm 5'8&#34; tall and 173 lbs. . I usually wear an XL in junior sizes, but I think if I had gotten an XL in this shirt it would be larger than I prefer. I like for my clothes to be more form fitting. Hopefully this is helpful."
4.0,I like this shirt. It's soft and cute. I got a lot of compliments on it. My only complaint is that the sleeves shrunk after the first wash. I have longer arms so now they are a bit too short.
4.0,It is a very pretty piece. Have not worn it as of yet. Not top quality but do-able!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:715d7267b0a1897c9a70d43124d292c5]] It came super packaged, I mean so many protective layers, and yet it had fingerprints on them? That’s weird. Anywho, they have some weight on them which makes them feel more expensive. My biggest issue is the Left Eye flap is loose and hangs open. Luckily, it stays open at the top and it’s just for a party."
4.0,It works excellent
4.0,"was small, and didn't like how it fits"
4.0,It fitted as expected. Despite that I didn’t like the fabric and it was a little short... I rocked it and received several compliments.
4.0,The wallet is slimming yet holds a ton of cards.  The zippy keeps all of them secure.  I purchased the red and it is a nice shade.
4.0,"Good buy for the price, it is exactly what I needed."
4.0,"pretty, sexy and comfortable -"
4.0,Not the highest quality material. My son complained it was a little stiff and scratchy. but for short periods of wear time...not a horrible  purchase.
4.0,A very cute reminder of our trip to Rome.  It looks great on my charm bracelet!
4.0,The socks were ordered for my husband; he likes them-in fact he picked the socks because of the variety.
4.0,Needed a small bag for the Masters and this worked well.
4.0,Cute and bobo. Worth the buy.
4.0,"Took one star because the dress isn’t as pictured and my earrings arrived broken. That being said, this IS a pretty dress. The fit is WONDERFUL. The white is not a cream but a stark white. I was planning on wearing this to my courthouse wedding. If you want more poof you could wear a petticoat with this. I would buy this again."
4.0,"I liked it. The material is soft and the color is exactly like the picture. However I felt its not true to its size. I usually wear small/medium, ordered large but still its skin fitting. I fear if it shrinks after wash, I won't be able to wear it."
4.0,"Pretty and well made, fits perfectly"
4.0,"This is a well made suit especially for the price, it had strong straight seams . It was very comfortable. It looked exactly like the picture, the colors were perfect very vibrant. I think this would be better suited for a D to an A cup. I read the reviews and decided that I would need to order 2 sizes larger than normal.  I ordered an XXL. The top was a bit too small, it fit fine in the back but not big enough to cover the front I am a 36DD.  The bottoms were huge on me but what do you expect when ordering 2 sizes larger. It would be great if this could be purchased as single pieces so you could order various sizes. I would have purchased medium bottoms and an XXXL top."
4.0,"they are small, but I was hoping for larger but I still like"
4.0,"I do like the look and fit and have gotten compliments on it when I wear it...however, it says to either dry clean or hand wash...I did was in washer on delicate and hung to dry...dried okay but could use a little ironing..."
4.0,Love how durable it is and I like the filter feature but it is not Drake Blue. It is more of a Navy than a Royal Blue. It is fine though.
4.0,They are too hot for florida so will only use in the winter -
4.0,A little large but overall like them
4.0,"I’ve gotten these in size 7, 8, and now I’m gonna get them in a 9. My son loves to run and play in them and they can even look nice when he’s more dressed up."
4.0,"Nicely made, but bit thinner than I expected. I'm 5'11, 225lb and got the XL. It still fits nicely, but I recommend getting at least a size bigger than you think you will need to accommodate for eventual shrinkage in the wash/drying process. The &#34;TRUNKS&#34; patch on the front and the &#34;Capsule Corp.&#34; logo on the left sleeve are actually sewn into the hoodie, but the logo on the back is iron-on. There are 2 additional pockets on the chest.<br />The only issue I had with it is that a sewing needle and some purple thread was left in one of the sleeves. Luckily I saw it before I put it on. So make sure you inspect it thoroughly before you wear it just to make sure. Other than that, fantastic hoodie, hope that it will last me a long time with continuous wear."
4.0,Super cute outfit for my newest niece! The bow is just a long piece if fabric you have to tie yourself.
4.0,Love the bag not crazy about the silky ribbon. Easy fix.
4.0,"Just as described, fits and feels just fine"
4.0,Very nice.  My son wants to take it from me.
4.0,"If I had to describe this shirt, I would say boho elegance."
4.0,I have noticed that my metal allergy was getting worse with cheaper earrings. I have been wearing these non stop with no problem and it has a good variety.
4.0,"Nice handbag for the price! I wish it was a little roomier, the center pocket is useless, eliminate that and put a deeper pouches to acomidate to ones cell phone. Overall it is made well, nice neat stitching, looks like a high end handbag. I would buy another and I have recommended to family and friends!"
4.0,"Hated it.. At first.<br />I went  with an XL im 5,5 180lbs. It was too large at the waist and bust So had some adjustments done.<br />When i got it to fit and when I wore it, I got so many compliments!. Nice dress.<br />Good buy afterall"
4.0,"These are marvelous gloves to look at and wear. However, my phone detects nothing from my finger, no matter how hard I press."
4.0,"Pinches my neck a lot. Other than that, I love it."
4.0,"These shirts are very cute. I like the length of the arm, but the V was a little too deep for me. I'd have to wear a tank underneath and I hate layers."
4.0,Way to small. These might fit the wrists of an infant but not mine. I love the antlers so I just took them off and made them into a bracelet I can wear
4.0,"For the price, it looks cute. I ordered way down in size going by reviews. I ordered a small, should have ordered a mediums I usually wear a large. It does fit but is snug in the bust (I’m a 36DD). The material feels a little cheap, slightly thin, but frankly the dress was cheap. I plan to wear with a chambray shirt or a hot pink cardigan."
4.0,I love them but they are see through.
4.0,The bag was excellent quality. But I returned because the green wasn't as bright as I would've liked
4.0,It's super cute and the Size chart is accurate until the bust.  might be better for someone who has A or B cups.  I'm a c and it's a bit uncomfortable.  Customer service is fantastic.  They promptly got in touch with me when they knew I had an issue and they really are going outside the box in helping me out. That's what good customer service is all about and encourages me to trust them on future orders.  Thank you! It means a lot to customers!
4.0,I bought it for someone she loved it
4.0,Nice robe great color
4.0,"Cute, very dainty"
4.0,The short faded after a couple of washes.
4.0,Están buenas para mis zapatos de correr me resulta más cómodo así no tengo que abrochar las tiras. Un poco difícil ajustarlas.
4.0,"I got the extra large, and they are comfortable and roomy--not too tight, but not loose in any way.  The colored panels are attractive.  The mesh panels  are a bit drafty on a cool day, but cooling if it is warm."
4.0,It fits very well and feels confortable as well. The only reason I give 4stars instead 5 is because the pattern and color look a little different from the pictures.
4.0,Awesome I have 4 pairs now... Nice and cozy and warm ..
4.0,"Shipped faster then expected. Great color (blue)<br />A little bigger then I expected but needed for travel.<br />Grey carry strap had minor discoloration between rather then outside,<br />hidden from view. I kept it-good price<br />Fabric is sturdy nylon type."
4.0,"I was impressed with the quality and fit. I have found in the past with clothing that is inexpensive, it generally runs very small. This was not the case at all."
4.0,Very comfortable. Holding up so far so good
4.0,The wording on the strap of the shoe has come off otherwise great product!
4.0,Purchased for a gift and she loved it.
4.0,"Bought this for Mother's Day. It came with everything for a great presentation. A box, tissue paper and even a little fancy bag."
4.0,"I wish it didn’t cost so much or I’d buy more . It’s comfortable , holds all my hair so I can work. It’s not very thick but the size is great . I bought two in different colours - black and navy ."
4.0,"The color is as expected and fits great. The material is not too thick and it fits right. Its in day-to-day use. non-see-through. Black detailing gives it a different look. after washing, it did not shrink. Though not great a good shirt."
4.0,"The Gysan Retro Canvas messenger bag is sturdy and has plenty of pockets. I obtained it to give as a gift, and the recipient is happy with it."
4.0,Looks good. Not sure i like the slide type bracelet though. It has a tendency to loosen up and turn around on my wrist.
4.0,The leggings are true to size.  Very sparkly and fun.  So nervous I will tear a hole in them though while be active!
4.0,"I like it very much, soft to touch and fresh. I bought it as bandana after I ride my motorcycle. With the helmets and the heat of the summer your hair gest very messy when you go for a ride and that's when this piece comes handy, I brush my hair and put on my new beautiful bandana. This color it's very pretty."
4.0,The dye comes off on papers that I put in it.<br />Guess it will go away over time.
4.0,Silver changes color
4.0,"I love this jewelry box, but the drawers aren’t high enough for rings that have a taller profile.  If you have big fingers and your rings are bigger than a size 9, they definitely won’t fit in the ring slots."
4.0,Been wearing these jeans for several years now. I love them! They fit me great! And they are a great price.
4.0,"Overall, I like this shirt.  It could be a little longer in the body, but I'm tall.  I like that it's a nice style and not clingy."
4.0,Seem a little cheaply made
4.0,The rings's quality are good however the sizes are weird. They don't fit right.
4.0,"I use only two earings out of 4. Other 2 is not my style. Two, I like are nice and comfy. I think still a good value as you can gift ones you won't wear."
4.0,"Super cute, looks identical to pictures. Kinda heavy but all and all manageable. Received lots of compliments."
4.0,Just one problem it has is that sleeves are very short
4.0,"These do the job at the gym, but are made a little small. I recommend getting the next size up if you order."
4.0,Shiny and unbroken.
4.0,Very stylish.  Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that the body is a little snug.  I bought medium and the shoulders/arms fit just right.  It is slim tailored so not much room around the hips.  But I bought 2 of these and will probably buy another.
4.0,It is an excellent item
4.0,Just got this and put it on my keys.<br /><br />It is crisply printed and bright red--the metal is thin but very rigid and strong. I have no doubt it will wear well.<br /><br />Eventually I'm going to order more just to tie on gifts for girlfriends or use as stocking-stuffers or what.
4.0,This is so cute and comfortable! I was amazed at how well this fit and how soft the fabric was. I wish it came in solid colors I would probably buy them all!
4.0,"Holy cow this is small!  After reading the reviews I decided to order a 3X even though I wanted a XL, but I knew I had to order up in size and I thought better to order too big than too small.  Well, it fits, but not like an XL, it should be baggier.  So, in my eyes a 3X = Large.  I hope that helps."
4.0,"I mean...it's about what I expected for the price I paid. The material is fairly cheap...it looks/feels kind of like a halloween costume. Which, honestly, is probably what I'll end up using it for :)"
4.0,"Originally I ordered this in a medium, my usual size.  It fit decently but was a little large, not so much that I can’t wear it but I wanted a bit of a more snug fit for going out.  I ordered a second dress in a small and it fit perfectly!  Both had a weird smell but nothing washing it didn’t fix.  I’ll keep the medium for casual occasions as well but if you want a curve hugging fit I found sizing down was better.  For reference I am about 5’3 and 130 pounds with a big bottom and I’m wearing a small in the photo"
4.0,Looks just like the picture. Love them !
4.0,Not bad for the price. Pretty cute.
4.0,"Awesome dress, it feels and fits one size bigger than me but the ribbon at the back easily takes care of that.<br />I'm 5'6"" and 180lbs and I bought a XL a large would've been just fine as well."
4.0,"Like this a lot. Looks very expensive but isn't.  Light weight and has the 925 showing it IS silver. It looks like the clasp might not last too long though. ( I can always make a new one) but I maybe I am w wrong . For the price, one could always buy two."
4.0,If you order a size up like mentioned you should be good. This doesn't hug your mid section too much like some of the other athletic fit shirts.
4.0,This is my second Homeyee dress and I will keep returning for more. This dress fit true to the size chart provided. It is work appropriate on me (not too short) and I am 5'4&#34;. I get a lot of compliments every time I wear this.
4.0,Looks and materials are good but the cups are too small.
4.0,"Love the material and the way it fits. I'm super self conscious about my body and have been wearing cute one pieces but wanted to get out of my comfort zone a bit so I ordered a couple of these and I love them! My bra size is 34D, and I wear between a M and L for bottoms, it just depends. I ordered the XXXL and it fit just fine, except I feel a little more exposed in the chest region than I'd like. But overall I would definitely order one again!"
4.0,"It falls off if right around the head, has to lifted to nearly top of head to stay put and so then becomes hard to breathe b/c it's then too tight around the face that you're sucking in the fabric when breathing."
4.0,Very cute & dainty like the person I'm gifting it to.
4.0,"Beautiful earings, makes a nice statement. Recieved lots of compliments on them."
4.0,Love this dress!  Shows off my wild side! Very comfortable!
4.0,"I only gave this a 4 star because it was so huge.  I can't wear it but gave it to a friend.  I rely heavily on reviews when it comes to online purchases and this one missed the mark.  I usually wear a size 10-12 in dresses (medium or large).  Based on the reviews, I sized up to a XL and that was a BIG mistake (literally).  It's actually a pretty dress but definitely purchase in the size you are... at least that was my experience."
4.0,"I finally feel comfortable in a swim suit! I went ahead and sized up, as I have a pretty big booty. Don't be afraid that the top will be too big, remember you can adjust it by tying it tighter or looser behind your head. I wish this suit came in other color options because I feel so comfortable in it!"
4.0,"Leather strap was a good fit for a 22mm lug width Seiko Presage Automatic (SARY055). I replaced the factory bracelet with the strap (actual watch pictured).<br /><br />It arrived with a pair of spring bars and the deployment clasp. Was easy to install and size after checking a YouTube video.<br /><br />The leather arrived very stiff and is going to take some time and effort to break in. At the price and with Prime shipping, this item was perfect for me."
4.0,"Good fit. Had to tighten the bottoms a few times while wearing. Ordered small I’m 5’4, 120, 32B, Hips 38, waist 27. I reversed the bottoms from the stripes to the stars the day I wore it. Felt the stripe side was a little too revealing for me in a certain area. If I wasn’t in a public outting and just friends I would definitely wear the stripe side. It is cheap so I did have to adjust the pattern while wearing from spilling one side to the other."
4.0,It was for a gift and she loved it
4.0,"This watch it really nice. I love the blue color on the face of the watch. The only problem I had with it, is that the numbers on the face of the watch were somewhat off. The 12 was where the 1 should be and the 1 was where the 2 should be so on and so forth."
4.0,I am impressed with quality! It's a really nice dress.
4.0,"Love them, although did have to reattach glove to string within first week of use."
4.0,"Not labeled, but that's the only small problem. They are amazing for the small price and look awesome!"
4.0,"This is a reasonably priced winder that generally seems to be made well. You should know, it is a little bit deceptive in terms of how it advertises battery operation. You can't really operate this by battery for very long. It requires large batteries that pretty much died within a day if it is solely on battery power. Otherwise, it would be fine."
4.0,Its a pair of Socks. They are Green and Black. They have Shamrocks on them.
4.0,"You get what you pay for sometimes.  This hat is top quality, looks great."
4.0,works well for the value
4.0,"Very nice dress. The dress is a different fabric then expected, but otherwise very good"
4.0,I like it but it’s difficult to put on yourself
4.0,Warm fits good and don't feel like stay puff marshmallow men.
4.0,Simple design but way cool. Images are sharp. Just note size: subtle bout 1/2”
4.0,"This necklace is just like the picture shown. It looks beautiful when worn. For the price, it is great, however I gave it only 4 stars because it took forever to arrive (it took a month and a half even though the product description stated that it would arrive in 10-15 days). Overall I am very happy."
4.0,"very comfortable, good fit and breathe well"
4.0,Really cute! My daughter loves them. No blisters or complatints!
4.0,Little bit tight at the leg
4.0,Work great! I used these while I was pregnant for swelling in my feet
4.0,Might order some more. They are comfortable
4.0,"Soft Satin Accessory, ribbon tie in the back. My neck is about 12.5 in and i tied it as much as i could but it dropped a bit. Had to pinch it at the back to be able to get the look i wanted. Keeps it shape even when I stored it squished in a box!<br />Minus 1 star because I wish it was a tad smaller to fit my neck."
4.0,I didn’t use all of the charms but they are so cute and sturdy! a good price value
4.0,"Wanted to like this dress, it would've been nice for work, but the top portion has odd seams on the inside that make wrinkles across the chest. The straps are also just an odd look."
4.0,"Loved the color of the the suit. Bottoms were a nice fit. It provided a modest amount of coverage however I have a large backside and didn’t cover as much as I would like. Top fit nicely as well but did have to cross the straps to lift me up.<br />I bought a large- normally wear 8-10. 34 DD,165lbs."
4.0,"Very happy with the purchase, will definitely buy again for the price."
4.0,This dress is very comfortable while looking stylish.  It can be dressed up or down.  Be sure to use the size chart for the item and you can't go wrong with proper fit.
4.0,"His glasses are great, sturdy and nice looking.<br />Only problem is they have a really bad glare when I’m on zoom.  Otherwise I love them."
4.0,Uses in reserves great shoe
4.0,"No water bottle holder, but tons of pockets, average size, like an average purse, it will work well."
4.0,I love the style of the top but it was a little too cropped for my liking.
4.0,They’re really cute but I ordered a size too big.
4.0,the top was kinda small & fit more like a crop & the pants were hella long but other than that the fit was good & color is super vibrant & pretty. i got lots of compliments
4.0,The only complaint I would have is about the band. It's a bit difficult to fasten.
4.0,Love the thickness but the top is very tight and I can't pull it up as high as it should be. Otherwise nice socks.
4.0,Bought for my daughter and she loves them
4.0,"nice belt, but the buckle is a bit loose, so it will 'tap'.  Not a real problem but dinging one start for fit and finish.  All that being said, the 'life to release' buckle is much nicer then the latch-type."
4.0,Wore it for Easter Sunday 4 months pregnant with a tee is bump. This dress fit as expected with the exception of the length. I ordered to XXL thinking it would graze the ground but you could clearly see my feet. This may not bother some people. Overall it’s good quality and I received lots of complaints.
4.0,great watch for price  one thing I didn't expect was that you can hear the clicking of each second  some may find this annoying where as I was just surprised
4.0,I purchased a Large and I’m 5’6 165lbs fits amazing!
4.0,"The size run bigger than normal. But overall good quality, cool colour blocking contrast. Comfy shirt."
4.0,"Love the print and style of this dress.  I'll add a belt to dress it up.  Runs a little small through the bust but a size up may be too large elsewhere.  Perfect for a shorter frame.  I'm 5'2, 155 lbs., 38DD.  It hits slightly above the knee.  I purchased a large."
4.0,"Just a little smaller then I thought, but I like the suit!"
4.0,"Color and size ran true to description.  I took away a star as this jacket is strictly button..no zipper..all rain jackets should have zippers.  This is very thin.  There is enough extra room to wear a sweatshirt underneath.  We haven't gotten rain yet, but I went ahead and sprayed scotchgard over it as added protection."
4.0,Very good quality.  You might want to buy one size larger than advertised.  I have another dress belt that is marked the same size that is an inch or two longer.  Just keep that in mind when you order.
4.0,I haven’t had time to use this - I’m planning on using it for summer
4.0,"Nice product, very thin"
4.0,great shirt but fit a little large
4.0,All together a really great bag. I have been using it for over 2 months now with multiple trips and it’s perfect as a carry-on as well as an everyday work/gym bag. The only thing I can nitpick is the stitching on the Velcro handle is starting to come undone slowly. Everything else is holding together beautifully. Very durable... beside my handle stitching. Would buy again!
4.0,"Glasses are of good quality and sturdy, I expect to get a lot of use from them."
4.0,Beautiful watch for decent price. For me having suck tiny risk I found it was gunna be a tad too snug OR too loose. I opted for the snug fit so it pinches in certain area near the clasp but I didn't want it loose at all and 1 link made a big difference but other than that it's gorgeous definitely worth it. I prefer watches with a clasp bringing the two bands together not sure what kind that is but I think it would fit better. Anyway the color is perfect not too heavy
4.0,I received a lot of compliments on this dress. I ordered it for a party. I’m not sure when I will wear it again.
4.0,"I don't have enough good things to say about this set. I bought two as gifts. The quality is amazing for the price, $19.99!<br /><br />I recently had to return a diffrent set of the same price. So I must admit my expectations were not high.<br /><br />But I contacted Pearlyta before placing my order. Pearlyta replied promptly and put my mind at ease. In my inquiry, I asked if the pearls were at least A quality & even requested photos.<br /><br />Pearltya attached extra photos & guaranteed at least A quality pearls, in their reply email. That is GRADE A customer service as I hadn't even bought anything yet!<br /><br />So you must be wondering why 4 stars. Well the loop for the necklace clasp is a little small so it is hard to out the necklace on by yourself. With that said that is my only real complaint. Also the pearls are not flawless, but for $20 you can't get better.<br /><br />I will attach photos."
4.0,I returned the first dress I purchased and bought a size larger. I really like this dress. I am almost 5'7&#34; and weigh 155. I purchased xl and it fits nicely.
4.0,I really liked the rich appearance of the bezel.
4.0,Bought this for my 10 year old son. I have been pleased with the watch.
4.0,"Cute hat, but kind of cheap quality!"
4.0,Super comfy . Love it
4.0,"This is a fun garment to wear under your clothes for a nice surprise later... or for a fun time. Aranmei Sexy Lingerie for Women Plus Size Fishnet Babydoll Nightgown Lace Sleepwear is something like a bodystocking dress. It feels like the same material that's used for tights. It clings to your curves and is suitable for nearly any body shape. It stretched out for me for a 18w dress size. I'm not sure how much it can go, but the more it stretches out wide, the shorter it will be. This may or may not be a bonus for you, but worth mentioning. It comes with the gloves pictured too, which have some thumb holes. I'd recommend this as it's cute, has a butterfly on it and feels nice. It made me feel nice about myself.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. If it was helpful, please click the button below."
4.0,"I bought these earrings because I don't have piercings, also because of the beautiful yet simplistic design. I didn't have any problems with the clamps, but they did start to slide and became uncomfortable after a while.<br /><br />The shipping does take a while though (around 3 1/2 weeks for me in California)"
4.0,My favorite coffee !!
4.0,"Deffinitly order at least a size over! I'm 5'6&#34; and 150 lbs and usually order m/l sizes, I ordered a L in this because of the reviews, and I should've got an XL.. The waist is really tight. But they're super cute. I think an XL would've been perfect, and probly for any woman who's a m or l usually."
4.0,"Color wasn't Burgundy as the description was, but still a great purse."
4.0,"I loved these pants when I got them so much I ordered a second pair.  I have gotten lots of compliments.  However after washing the first pair the leg seam split open.  After wearing the second paid a second time the pocket sewing is coming out.  Disappointing but they are inexpensive, fit great, are a nice fabric so I guess you get what you pay for."
4.0,My kids love Demon Slayer.  Much welcome addition to their collection!!
4.0,"They are very comfortable, but not a great deal of support."
4.0,"They seem to be very nice leisure pants and made with quality, but were way too big for my husband, for whom I had purchased them.  We will have to return them."
4.0,"Warm coat, but not meant for rain."
4.0,"I bought these sunglasses for my husband, he likes them but if you press on the lense too hard too clean them they will pop out. Other than that they are great for the price!"
4.0,Works well for what I need. I wish it was slightly larger because I have size 11.5 mens shoes and when they are in the pocket they take up most of the bag.
4.0,"I wish the chain was either longer or shorter. It's kind of an awkward length, even with the two different positions you can adjust it to. Unless I wear a low cut top or a turtle neck it falls behind behind the neckline and you can't see it."
4.0,Beautiful bag cotton candy pink not what I was expecting but thank you
4.0,Bought a ‘green monster’ full costume but the mask didn’t look enough like the grinch so I ordered this mask and it was perfect
4.0,"This is a good quality long sleeve tee that is comfortable to wear. The material is nice and smooth. Although it mentions it is slim fit, it fits slightly loose but I usually have this issue with clothing as I am petite. This is my new favorite tee to wear around the house since it is comfy and looks great."
4.0,"I really like the size and the style of this bag. Love the red color and changeable straps. I was initially put off by all the gold, but it's grown on me and I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,Fabric is a bit thin but was perfect for hot yoga
4.0,I wanted to wear these while chopping wood that was breaking apart and flying everywhere but there is zero grip with these. They certainly work for cooking but I prefer shorter gloves for that. The fit is good and they seem strong but it’s just too hard to hold anything more than a knife or small tool.  I didn’t get to try but I do think they will work while holding a smaller chainsaw. You can also put larger grip gloves over them.
4.0,Shirt shrunk once I washed it. Besides that it looks great
4.0,nice fabric. back zipper too tiny to zip yourself.
4.0,Only thing the ring at front came broten but really like the style and fit perfectly
4.0,A bit to heavy
4.0,It does what they say it's supposed to do.
4.0,"Nice, roomy make-up bag. I like that it has 2 pockets in it and it's deep. The one thing I don't like is that the lid does not stay open on it's own.....but not that big of a deal."
4.0,"I'm a skirt only kinda gal and recently began working from home... which proved to me I have nothing to wear beyond PJs or office attire. Plus.... I wanted a few more stretchy skirts to wear over my athletic pants/leggings for at the gym and running. These are perfect. They are thin, so if you aren't layering, they might need help.  A bonus: the foldover part isn't bulky at all like the old navy foldovers of old...  Docked a star because they are thin, and will wrinkle if crammed into my over stuffed workout wear drawer... but sure beats the way higher prices for other brands with built-in leggings or having to make my own. OVerall - happy with my purchase. Oh, I am 5'4"", 120 lbs and these hit right below my knee when worn lower on the waist. Probably hit right above my knee when at my natural waist."
4.0,I bought a large. I could have a little more room. however it can be worn for now
4.0,Bought this as advertised - as a shower shoe. So I don't wear them around and walk around a bunch. I wear them from the locker to the shower to the sink to the locker. But they are designed so that they don't hold any water so you can pretty much wipe them with a towel and put them in your duffel bag without getting everything wet.
4.0,Loved the dress. The only problem I had was the front was pretty low so my bra kept showing. I tried to go bra-less but it made it look worse. I wore it on a dinner cruise while on vacation and you have to be careful because the split does run up. With the right gust of wind you’ll be giving a show lol. It is a wrap dress as well so be mindful of that.<br /><br />Update : The dress is still amazing and beautiful. I get compliments every time I wear it. Definitely a favorite.
4.0,"Fits well and is flattering. Kind of odd slinky fabric, but overall a nice basic black dress that is easy to dress up. Will definitely wear it out on a date night or special event"
4.0,Great for wearing at night to avoid getting flying debris in my eyes on windy nights.
4.0,I like this dress but if you put anything in the pockets then it hangs and pulls the dress down.
4.0,So far so good! Look huge though...
4.0,"My daughter loves this watch and so far it's working well. I took off one start because it was a little hard to set the correct time at first, but I got it eventually."
4.0,Great hat just didn't look right on me
4.0,It's cheapy made but for the price it is rather cute.  It serves it's purpose. The top was bigger then expected I had to tie a string in back to make it fit more snug. Skirt is a different color white kinda a lil off white from the top nothing major.
4.0,My grandson loved lis chef hat it fur very well and made of very good material would give five stars if I had an option 2 months earlier of ordering his a different color.
4.0,"I am 5'3 and weight around 146 pounds. [hour glass/pear shaped] All of my weight is in my love handles, thighs, and butt. I ordered a medium. The pants are stretchy just right. I like it. It is super cute. The shorts are not soft, but that is fine! It purrrty!"
4.0,I usually get extra large but I got a large this time. they fit a little loose but I'm sure with someone with a bigger butt it'll fit perfectly. they are comfortable enough to sleep in I will definitely buy more.
4.0,"I haven't use it yet, but the fit was fine.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is it is a little thinner, then I expected."
4.0,"Fit as expected based on the size chart. Very cute. Not sure how long it'll last but as long as it lasts me a year or two, it's worth the money."
4.0,To protect me sun light
4.0,"Lovely dress. My little loves it and was twirling around. Super bouncy bottom and nice printing job on Elsa part. The top and bottom are different colors of blue/teal which is a little strange but it doesn’t take away from the cuteness, but since this is a review, if different top to bottom colors matter to you, now you know beforehand."
4.0,Fit as expected not too snug on calf. Sock is soft and comfortable all around. Color & design are as pictured and hold up in wash.
4.0,"if you keep in mind they are a little on the small side, they are fine."
4.0,This was a gift. They loved it..
4.0,It arrived quickly and looked very nice. It is soft lace and looks good with my outfits. I would recommend this to anyone.
4.0,Got as a gift for a friend. She loved them!
4.0,"Nice blouse, narrow"
4.0,Pros: the earnings are supperrrr light to wear which is great!<br />Cons: as you guys can see the tassel strings were all uneven therefore I had to trim them myself.
4.0,Somewhat large for my daughter but it will work
4.0,"If you have a very skinny body with nearly no hips at all and you are not tall, this could fit you well. Otherwise they are soft and nice."
4.0,I am so pleased with the perfect fit. I am only 5' and have problems finding nice fitting dresses. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it came with terrible wrinkles. Rayon fabric does not like ironing so I am having to be super careful trying to get all the hard wrinkles out.
4.0,"Fit perfectly, they're not glass like the originals but that also means they're lighter"
4.0,"I’m a size 22 in dress and the 3x fit good. I wore it to a wedding and got complimented all day. Only downside was that the dress was super itchy around the arms and the stomach. I wore a full spanx underneath though so it turned out ok. The longer dress length definitely added to the comfort of the dress. All in all, a beautiful dress that’s accurate by the pictures."
4.0,"This is a very lightweight toy made of thin plastic, but it is made to complete a costume, not survive children's playtime. It is very detailed and looks authentic. It completed my Thor costume perfectly."
4.0,"The embroidered “T” is super nice and thick. Overall, I’d say the quality is pretty good."
4.0,"My son loves these pajamas, the colors are vibrant. We washed it twice and it still looks good"
4.0,"A little long for us short girls, but I still like it."
4.0,Its authentic and its a nice watch for the money. Only issue is that it arrived without the plastic warranty card.
4.0,A little tight but I like it
4.0,"It has nice fabric but as you can see threads are coming out from sides.  I am not fan of threads that are coming out , and I would love it more if it has straight edges. It is really good quality though, it is worth it"
4.0,Just what I expected. Good quality for the price.
4.0,A little cheaper looking than id hoped but still cool
4.0,"Cute shoes... Decent quality for the money.  The blue/turquoise color is starting to chip away from the sole material (I believe it is EVA foam) below the heel counter.. but for the price, it's really not a big deal."
4.0,The print is not as cute in person as it looks online but it fits great and has pockets
4.0,Very pretty necklace.  Just don't let the pearl come off the chain.
4.0,Fits nice looks good
4.0,Just perfect went with outfit very well!
4.0,"These shoes are really cute, and really poorly made, however they were extraordinarily inexpensive, I think they are definitely worth what I paid for them. I have a narrow foot, so the fit is perfect that way. I wear a size 10 and ordered a size 41, they are really snug in length. I wish I had gone a size up, I'm hopeful these will stretch a tad."
4.0,"I give it 4 stars only because the material isn’t the greatest. However I am 5’7 and the length was perfect on me. The straps are not adustable, so that was a downfall."
4.0,Good priced for a toddler after a bath. To keep her feet warm.
4.0,It runs very small I am normally a L and order the XXL it fits. The material is ok but some of the stiching is coming off at the bottom. I tried it with a black belt since the waist line is higher then ur waist to give me a better waist line. I would wear it with jeans and boots I think it will be ok.
4.0,cute ..flowers could be a bit more brighter so they are more noticeable
4.0,Great product comfortable and fits well
4.0,It doesn't go all the way up to my knee but it fits good and it came in 5 days!
4.0,"Loved this dress and how it fits, but it runs two sizes too small. I typically wear a small but had to order a large in this. Perfect for work or going out. It was a little shorter than I expected."
4.0,"This product is great!! I'm a machinist and work with all kinds of metal and coolants and I couldnt wear my ring because it would've gotten scratched or ruined. I was suprised to find that pruduct even existed!! The material is really great, it suctions right to your finger and really not a lot can get in. That said i never thought about the moisture in your skin and when you wear the ring cover it holds all that moisture and the condensation builds up and water particle will start to form on the inside. still a great product for protecting."
4.0,For taller girls. It is comfortable and I like to wear it but it’s very bunch around the crotch. Need longer legs!
4.0,"a lovely dress , colour is as seen , a lit tight in sleeves m but got lots of compliments ."
4.0,"Nice string bracelets. Packaging doesn’t come as illustrated, rather loose in a draw string bag."
4.0,Leather a little stiff but overall happy with the watch. Can't beat the price. I mostly wear watches for the style only.
4.0,This dress is very comfortable but like others have mentioned it runs a little short. If you plan to wear with leggings it is perfect! I was worried about the neckline since I don't prefer turtle necks but it is not as tight as I expected so it worked out well. Color was bright and the fabric used is soft. I would definitely purchase again.
4.0,Very good item if you have to conceal body piercing for work.
4.0,"I GOT THESE PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE OF MY HONEST REVIEW , I GIVE 4 STAR OF THESE PRODUCT IS BECAUSE I LIKE IT WHEN I UESD IT IN THE NIGHT SO CONFORTABLE AND SOFT TO WEAR IT,.VERY EASY TO WASH AND NICE SEXY TO WEAR IT,. and also very easy to wash and dry just wash it whit your hand cause its not good to wash in the laundry . will one thing about these product are good not itchy in my skin so cool to slip at night ,. very good quality of these and nice design very black color and seductive to wear."
4.0,Very nice. A little tight at the bust area but can be worn as is without discomfort.
4.0,Was great product at great price bit out of my 2 pair one pair had a sock damaged before it arrived to my home and made the one sock unusable. Now these have become a daily need healing from broken leg.
4.0,I really loved the look and was excited about them.. but I have to be careful with them on because the front is heavier then the back and the want to fall out.  But really like them..
4.0,Good quality sneaker for overpronation
4.0,Really like the cross itself very good quality and workmanship. Chain just a little to short.
4.0,"Not quite as good as others i've ordered, but decent enough. The material is stretchy but a little rough, and the ends aren't hemmed."
4.0,"All I knew from Amazon when I ordered this was that it was a size small. I'm between medium and small depending on brand. But this product's small is tiny, so be sure to check the size chart before order. This blouse is too small for me: sleeves are too short and bottom hem fits snuggly around my bottom (I'm 5' 5-1/2"" tall, 36C, 135 pounds). I can now official say that I don't care for 100% polyester. It's too synthetic and feels cheap. But I can't ding the product based on that since it was advertised as polyester. It's a cute top. Too bad it doesn't fit me."
4.0,Item arrived quickly and it very cute. It runs a little small or tight. I was able to stretch it a little. I would purchase again.
4.0,"Great quality and color. They went into the frames easily, but they do have a bit of a gap in the top side of frames. You can not tell very easily, unless you are looking for it, but once you notice it, you notice it."
4.0,"I definitely could have a sized down.  The dress is very pretty, but it is a lot longer than I thought it would be.  I am very short (5'0""), and the dress hits me at mid calf.  I was hoping for something at the knee, so I could wear it all year round, but this feels like it will remain a Winter dress.  It will work for Christmas, which is what I bought it for.  I got an XL because I was nervous it would be too tight, but I absolutely could have purchased my usual size Large.  The fabric is thick and heavy; another reason this one will be a Winter dress.  It is very flattering, but again, a little longer than I was hoping."
4.0,Absolutely love the jeans love the style of the print just a little loose near the waist looks funny when you wear a belt
4.0,Not the highest quality but great for the price. Chains kinked a bit in travel but overall good.
4.0,"It's not quite as long as I'd hoped and the quality is a bit off; however, it will do quite nicely for any sub-$200 watch I'm likely to need it for.  It's OK for the price."
4.0,Cute! Fits perfect
4.0,The elastic piece sits at the lower part of my boobs rather than totally under them. The effect makes me look slightly pregnant
4.0,"It came to me just fine. not as nice as Alex and Ani bracelets, but nice and they donate to Autism Speaks which is dear to my heart."
4.0,A bit cheap and a tad smaller than expected but they're soft
4.0,"On the product package that I received, as legitimate as it was, the logo was black on the two pink masks-FYI"
4.0,"So far so good! I received my necklace in the mail today and it is MUCH better quality than I expected it to be. It was packaged very nicely in a cute little box...my only complaint is that the chain was tangled in the bag, but it was relatively easily undone."
4.0,"I get so many compliments on this dress whenever I wear it. It is so cute, comfortable and stylish. I was afraid that it might not fit - I ordered the size I normally wear - and it fits perfectly!<br /><br />Highly recommend."
4.0,Good jacket except 2Xl is tight fitting. Me 52&#34; chest. Tight in the chest and shoulder area. Can wear over t-shirt
4.0,I mean it’s a witchy hat! I love it! Little bit on the imperfections end but I dig it!
4.0,Very soft. Colors are fun. We bought the red spider web ones. There is glitter on the rubber black part. Pleasant surprise for my son. He said they feel a little tight but he think he just has to get used to them. He is five. They are warm. The sole is hard and a little heavy. Good grip on the bottom.
4.0,It is a lovely cotton neck scarf - BUT it is darker than shown.  The lighter purple does not cover much area so this pretty lavendar in the picture is not a significant area.  That was my disappointment.
4.0,"The leggings are really comfortable and has very good fit. The only thing is that the top seem of the pants, want to come undone. I love the pockets on both sides of the leggings to hold your phones and keys. It also have a small hidden pocket. Overall happy with these pants and ordered another set."
4.0,"A fun solstice head dressing.  It fits well, looks good, and is super fun."
4.0,Glad I bought them. I love wearing thongs during the summer time. Can't even tell you're wearing anything. Especially under my jeans. It feels like going commando!
4.0,"I purchased this dress in the color red and in a size large as I am currently 7 months pregnant and intended to wear this about a month from now. The dress itself is very pretty, stretchy (which was wonderful), and the lace is intricate and lovely. There was one long string along the zipper that became stuck but I'm sure that it would have been something I could have lived with. However, I am returning the dress. Unfortunately, the dress was too short for me. I'm 5'7 and intended to wear heels, not even very tall heels, but the dress wasn't long enough to touch the floor without any shoes on. It was about an inch and a half off the floor. I would have definitely kept the dress otherwise."
4.0,"Received my dress today, for women with Curves in Hips, order a size larger. I syllable love the Bohemian Maxi, I am 5' 4, Woman with Curves and keeping this Dress, Love the color combination."
4.0,Great for the price -- and the snug fit at the waist is for my tween who doesn't quite have a defined waist yet.
4.0,"Nice design, a bit small, and the silver could be shinier."
4.0,The robe is a little thin.
4.0,"They are very light, easy to pack where it was severely weight limited, Rwanda. Sat directly on the tropical forest's dirt, filled with small branches, some with sticker without the pants tearing. However they do not protect against penetration by the stickers. That would take something heavier.."
4.0,Love these glasses.  Very light. They cut the glare and make the vision much clearer. Bought more to have one for each car and for my wife.
4.0,Nice quality but the size was nowhere what I expected it to be.
4.0,"I think this skirt is very comfortable and warm. Perfect for winter-time. I love the pockets - deep enough to carry a wallet, keys, pen, ect.  I'm 5'1, 118 lbs and have a 27 inch waist, so I got the large based on many reviews that recommended sizing up. The large fits fine, but I'm sure I could've gotten by with a medium. And being on the short side, the skirt skims just above the tops of my ankles, but that's okay with me since I'll be wearing this skirt during colder months.<br /><br />A couple cons: the zipper won't zip all the way - it gets stuck on the fur/wool when it gets to the waistline where the fur is on both the inside and outside of the skirt, so I have to close it with a safety pin. I don't feel like it's noticeable when I cinch it closed with the pin, so it's not a huge deal, but still worth mentioning. I also don't particularly care for the petticoat that's sewn underneath it. I never wear petticoats, so it kind of makes me feel like I'm playing dress up when I wear this skirt . . .<br /><br />All in all, though, this a really nice skirt. I'd recommend it to anyone whose looking for some dressier clothes that they can comfortably wear during Winter."
4.0,i sized up and it’s perfect!
4.0,"Cute little necklace. The length was a bit shorter than I expected, and in the picture it looks more iridescent like mother of pearl. In person it just looks white. It’s cute though, so neither of those things are deal breakers."
4.0,"This dress fits amazing and the material feel wonderful. I didn't even know it had pockets!! I love it. Had a little trouble with the zipper going up or down in the middle, I just gotta watch the material when zipping, but it's awesome"
4.0,cute basic bracelet.
4.0,My cat absolutely loves this hoodie and I do as well. I love getting to cuddle but still do some work. The hoodie runs extremely small so definitely order at least two sizes up. I ordered 3 up and it fits the way I like. A little loose and comfy but still fits. I’m usually a m/l but order a 3x. The only other thing is the thumb holes aren’t really usable.
4.0,Great fit for my new shoes... Seem a bit flimsy as they will not hold up for very long..  but time will tell .  Still good now
4.0,"improve the chain for future customers, but the necklace is very pretty and is a symbol of the military brat"
4.0,"Looks good, fits good. Quality is just ok"
4.0,"Polarization is not fully done and lenses are definitely not 350+ UV standard, but for what you pay, you're getting an OK pair of glasses.  Lenses are clean and clear and free of inclusions.  Vision is clear.  I'm happy enough."
4.0,Product ordered was as described
4.0,"I bought it in pink. It fits well, it's cute and comfortable, which is especially helpful during the days you want to cover up more. The only thing is the neckline. The way it slightly flares out, it looks like it got stretched in the wash. It bothers me a bit, but it's not the end of the world."
4.0,"This jacket fits a little bit on the smaller side. I normally wear a large and had to exchange for an extra large. But with that being said, this is a great light jacket. It's perfect for cool summer nights"
4.0,Overall my 10 yr old loved it. She was so excited and anticipated it’s arrival.  When we opened the box everything was there but the pencil case little latch thingy was unraveled and now she can’t hook it to her bag.
4.0,I ordered this as a workout top to layer over sports bras and it works really well for that purpose. It's lightweight and breathable and I like that there's enough material that I can tie it in a knot in the front.
4.0,"I loved this dress, it was tighter at the waist and wider..."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. The sleeves were quite loose, even with a small, but nothing that can't be fixed by hand."
4.0,"Some what small, and quality isn't all that you think it should be. But nine the less they do the job fairly well."
4.0,"Very cute, and lots of volume in the skirt. I would buy it again because it is well made  and pretty."
4.0,Nice necklaceand very stylish
4.0,"a little small in the paper bill area, cannot fit many singles, but very happy overall with wallet"
4.0,"A bit constricting at the top band--otherwise very nice.<br /><br />I am editing my review today. After posting this, I received a very nice follow up from Elizabeth Hargrove, from Vero Monte. I was expecting the thigh highs to be loose, the kind to wear with garters, so the tight band when first on was a problem.<br />Elizabeth said to try to wash them in warm water to relax the band some. I did that and it worked, much more comfortable. I too am on the low end of the size scale. Now, they fit much better and Elizabeth even sent me a free gift. I added a photo of the free ones--just to let you see the wonderful selection they offer. Elizabeth is the best [[:<br />So, just know that they are made to stay up, and to do that they have to be tight, but that tightness can be lessened with a warm water wash.<br />They are very high quality, and the packaging is unique, in that they include stickers to cover the product labeling on the box for gifting.<br />Give them a try--just be aware of the band fit situation."
4.0,I like the way it looks on the wife.
4.0,"These pants are super soft, thick, and fit well. I ordered a small I should have ordered a small. They are way softer than the Victoria secret total knockout leggings. However, I wish they had bigger pockets placed on the outside instead of the inner waistband.  This is a great product I will definitely buy it again."
4.0,Great gift for my girlfriend. The only thing I didn't like too much was the St. Michael image on the back wasn't very clear. Wish it was more defined. Overall great gift though.
4.0,"Would of gotten 5 stars but ad is somewhat deceiving. In pic looks like all the socks r black, not the case. There is black, gray, dark gray, navy blue, red and white pairs of socks."
4.0,It was greeted very warmly by all whom I gifted this low price good looking wrist band/watch. I would recommend and actually have shared the product with others.
4.0,Was a good buy for sun protection......nice blue color and comfortable material.
4.0,Haven't used yet. But looks and feels good. Took a week to deliver.
4.0,"Grey stuff always looks cute in pictures, but never in person for my curvy frame. As usual, that was the case here. It hid my curves, was baggy at the waist, and visibly tight on my chest. I'm 5'2&#34;, 175#, 38DDD, and purchased an XL.<br /><br />So I ended up giving it to my daughter, and it looked super cute on her. 5'6&#34;, 160#, 38B. I have no complaints about the quality and colors. It's definitely very cute for the right body type."
4.0,its a great little wallet so far.
4.0,Poor quality material had all kinds of lent on it but it fit well. I returned it.
4.0,"Oookay, let's level set here. A lot of the other reviews are low due to the fact that it's difficult to remove links from the watch in order to fit it to your wrist. Is it really such a bad thing that the links are tight? i think not, this means it won't fall apart while you're wearing it.<br /><br />I LOVE this watch band, it's beautiful and sturdy and looks great! I only removed 1 star because i did break the first pin in the tool to remove the links, AND it came with not instruction on how to safely remove the links without damaging the finish of the watch.<br /><br />I was able to get the appropriate amount of links out (yes with some difficulty, but usually i take my watches to the watch counter at the department store and pay the $5 fee to get them removed by a professional with the appropriate tools)."
4.0,Nice shirt true to it size beautiful print
4.0,"I LOVE that it costs about 1/3 of what many bags cost. Perfect for women who aren't high maintenance (with tons of creams and make-up and skin potions). It doesn't have as much space as bags that unfold several times, but it has plenty if you just use a couple of creams/lotions, plus a bit of foundation, lipstick, mascara, shampoo & conditioner, soap/bath gel, toothpaste & toothbrush, hairbrush and comb, and several pairs of earrings. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it doesn't have removable zip pouches that can easily be washed out if something leaks. Those with that feature typically cost $45-$50 or more and I didn't want to spend that."
4.0,This is a very nice necklace.
4.0,"I want to love this sooooooo badly, it is soooo damn cute but I got a small and it is pretty baggy everywhere. it is still cute and I'll probably still wear it a little but I wish it came in an extra small<br /><br />the straps on top are very loose fitting and don't support my bust too well, so diving is out of the picture... and the bum is very baggy<br /><br />I am surprised this is so big since they are chinese sizes. I am 5'8&quot; and 125lbs normally a size 2 measurements Bust-33&quot; Waist-26&quot; Hips 34&quot;<br /><br />I did received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review<br /><br />as you can see in my pictures it is pretty big... I plan on taking it to a tailor and having a scrunch butt put on the bottoms and the straps shortened a bit, is really is adorable"
4.0,Kind of see through. But very cute.
4.0,"I wish the frames were darker, but otherwise I love them."
4.0,I love it but it’s a little snug
4.0,Worked well for my holiday costume and will keep me warm this winter!
4.0,"I love this robe its so soft its fits me right, haven't seen any fuzziness yet which is good, the robes is long so size down, I got a small medium its fits great, at first I thought I should size up to a large and xlarge but then after looking at the robe some more, I realized this size is good. I highly recommend getting this robe, the only thing I wish the robe would stay closed"
4.0,Nice looking set of ear hugging earrings. They fit close to my ears and I like that they don't have any exposed sharp points or edges to them while wearing them. They are very comfortable to wear and to sleep in. I love the colors they come in and I like to use them as daily wear hoops. I mainly use the black set. My only issues with them is that the gold pair has one of the set that won't stay closed and I'm afraid I will lose it if I wear them. I did not worry about asking for a refund or replacement because I wouldn't use that pair very much anyway. I use the black pair a lot and I've had no issues with the finish or the clasp. I bought this four piece set of Stainless Steel Huging Hoops at a discount to try them out and to write my honest unbiased feedback send review.
4.0,"Pretty earrings, the product seems to be holding up well after wearing for a full day. I am satisfied with them."
4.0,Nice item but too small for an XL body.  Disappointed that it didn't fit because it was really nice.
4.0,I've become obsessed with graphic tees over the past year and this says it all. The color is perfect for fall weather and the saying  - Nailed 2020.<br />I like the V-neck t-shirt and the color of the shirt and pattert.  I think it runs a little small but it does have stretch .  I wish it was a little roomier in the chest area.
4.0,"A little light weight but all in all, a nice little bracelet"
4.0,Barely any water resistance. Overall an amazing watch.
4.0,Great quality suit for the price!
4.0,"I was trying to emulate Kato's mask, which was rounded as pictured in advertisement, but this is not.  It still worked out fine, but if it matters to you, the masks are not exactly the same shape.  It does get hot behind the mask while indoors."
4.0,Bought for our five year old. Very cute run around shoes. She complained of them feeling to flat at first but as she wore them they became more comfortable. Love the color and fringes.
4.0,"It's it's hard because I would like to rate the quality of the jogger as being a five. The color is nice the fabric is thick. It took a long time to be delivered coming from overseas I didn't notice that at first, and I sized up based off of the reviews and it was still just too small. I think I would have been successful if I would have sized up twice."
4.0,"for a dude with a big head, was not dissapointed, great product, very comfortable"
4.0,Black and Gold for my 65th birthday celebration.
4.0,"I'm going to put this down for women and children. Mainly because the pouches worked so well for smaller sized multiple pieces, I.e. Bras, undies, and camies.<br />I liked the outline structure, and all zippers were intact and functioned well."
4.0,"They’re cute enough, but 3 of mine were the same."
4.0,They are beautiful but one moisture reaches them the change colour which is not good.
4.0,It's good but is coming on two parts<br />I need fixed
4.0,velveetas baby
4.0,Very nice product. Super light and compact. Great for travel. I like the colors and style.
4.0,The earring was actually light. I really though it was going to pull my ear since it's long and dangly but it totally doesn't. One thing though I kinda wish the cuff was somewhat smaller. But besides that the earring fits well. and is super cool.
4.0,"My daughter is 8 and she hardly fit them, but they stay up on her so she keeps wearing them! Loved the colors"
4.0,"It does it's job fine, and inexpensively."
4.0,"this dress is very cute and fits pretty well, i’m 130 pounds and 5’3 and got a small. the straps aren’t adjustable, but the waist is. it has a corset back, so it’s easy to make it however tight/loose you want to. the dress is a little “stumpy” but is overall pretty cute!"
4.0,"Seller ships very fast! The piece doesn't have much weight to it but it's costume jewelry so I wasn't expecting anything top notch! You get what you pay for guys. But for ""costume jewelry"" it is pretty and the look is great! Can't wait to wear it!"
4.0,Very pretty but after wearing it I do not like the idea of my chest accented by the high waistband. I am a grandmother 61 so that bothers me a bit.<br />The sewing of the layers was caught on 2 layers not quite obvious and I can cut & resew the tiny spot.<br />When trying to pull over your head be careful not to tug on only 1 layer you will rip it cause its snug pulling down.<br />I bought a long black swim skirt and this looks like a nice modest outfit.
4.0,Comfy for all day use
4.0,Very pretty. The gem on the necklace is bigger than I wanted it to be.
4.0,"My dogs and I walk to the top of a nearby 2000 foot mountain 2 to 3 times a week with ridge walks on our off days. So far I've worn these boots on eight trips to the top. They fit well, provide good support for my 71 year-old feet and ankles and good traction. They are on a par with the Adidas boots they replaced at about half the price. Adidas boots usually lasted about 150 - 200 trips to the peak before they needed replacing. Time will tell how these rate over time"
4.0,"They do the job but the only fault is that the rubber on the holders come off very easily. I had to super glue them in order for them to stay. I don't know why they come lose like this? They easily come off and if you don't notice you can really scratch yourself. But other than that, great set to have. If they super glue or seal that rubber on their it would be a perfect 5"
4.0,i really like this shirt  fits well and i have people asking me where i got it  love the color
4.0,"This one is cool but I mis-calculated on sizing, so it isn't one that I'd wear around as much."
4.0,Great bargain for its price.. It's a heavy big face watch that grabs attention. It's colour is an unpolished yellow gold finish similar to an Audemer watch.
4.0,I really like the product<br />I purchased it for my son
4.0,My son looks handsome in it! He likes it a lot! He say it is very “in”
4.0,I have a strong like for the dress. A strong like and not love is because it is a bit on the thin side. I ordered a large and the material is stretchy. It stretches so that the color changes a bit. I ordered the black and white one. But I'm not returning.
4.0,My favorite suit probably! But again ... I have small boobs so it looks a little weird on me - but all do because I have an extremely flat chest 😩
4.0,"These shorts are OK.  Be aware they are VERY short.  I have other shorts with 3"" inseam and they seem longer than these shorts. The material and construction seem to be good.  I ordered XXL and they fit a little smaller than I thought they would but still OK.  I usually wear large or extra large but those sizes would have been way too small."
4.0,"Great color and comfort, nice drape.  Only gripe is the length, at 5'2&#34; this dress hits me midcalf.  I was expecting longer."
4.0,Not as long as I expected but still a great buy!!
4.0,They run a little larger than the same size long jeans I have of the same brand. Good length and quality made
4.0,I fabric feels cheap but the shirt is nice. It’s definitely synthetic and slightly scratchy. It’s really cute though!
4.0,"True wrap dress and true to size.  I'm 5'6"" about 155 lbs and the medium was perfect.  As others have said, because it's a wrap, the front is a little low if you have a large chest.  The fabric was nice, but the front was a little short for any formal event."
4.0,"As per other reviews, they do fit a little big compared to other items.  Nothing extreme, as my weight goes up and down anyway. Very light weight, and they look good on you.  Cant beat 3 for the price."
4.0,Cup size fits is perfect and I like having the closure in the front.  I just wish that there was more strap to adjust.
4.0,"these are true to size. The color is a true blue and the material is very stretchy. however, these are very much made ofnthe same material as they make swimsuits.....an they are truly seamless"
4.0,Really cute but you have to pull them on a little hard to do.
4.0,"I liked the material, it was a little bit big but I added a belt and it looks perfect."
4.0,"Fit was on the small side, but it worked."
4.0,Good looking and stylish wallet.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and well made.  Beautiful, heavy jacquard fabric, no stretch.  Good stitching and quality zipper.  My only complaint is that it was way too large.  I'm L/XL and since this dress is form fitting I ordered XL.  I suspect that I might have been able to order M. When you try this dress on, step into it as the skirt tapers quickly and the bottom might be too tight to go over your hips."
4.0,I really love that a good amount of them are made with real materials
4.0,"The material was as expected and looks nice. I was expecting it to fit more like a Hawaiian shirt but it is tighter around the belly than i was expecting. I have a gut and normally XL shirts and tees work fine, this one was tight across my middle."
4.0,"Good construction, nice look, but a little too snug for my wrist. I'll keep it for dressier occasions, but for daily wear I had to go with something else."
4.0,"I really like these sunglasses, but I have some issues with them. They fit me perfectly, which is great! But most sunglasses tend to be too big for me.... I think these would be a tight fit for an adult male which defeats the unisex purpose. They also aren't the most comfortable pair of sunglasses out there.<br />What I do really like is that they're polarized sunglasses for an amazing price! You get UV protection in a simple look which is current without being too much.<br />#wearme_pro"
4.0,I use this as camisoles under my blouses.
4.0,"I love the suit, but the pants are exceptionally long.  I suggest adding petite sizes for shorter pants.  If the bottoms were shorter, I would rate 5 Sta"
4.0,"Bella, es un regalo y la persona quedó encantada, muy delicada y acordé para cualquier ocasión"
4.0,It's help but well have ur bones hurting if you keep it on
4.0,"I love the Zerdocean brand! They make amazing clothes, so I was excited when I came across these sweatpant joggers. I wear 3x in most pants like this but wanted to make sure they wouldn't be too tight so I went with a size bigger and got them in a 4x.... big mistake. They swallow me. The legs are super wide... I feel like a 3x would even be too big for me. So maybe size down perhaps? I decided to keep them anyways and wear them around the house as pj pants this winter. The material is well insulated, but still thin. Not fleece inside like other sweatpants. These are very long in the legs for all my short friends. I'm 5'3. Not the most flattering pants but they are comfy lol."
4.0,Classy but a little small.
4.0,"The size 9-10 fits my 8 yr. old average sized gdaughter nicely with a bit of room to grow. She is long waisted and leggy. The length was perfect. She'll be able to wear this dress for other occasions, which makes it a good buy."
4.0,was a gift and she really liked it
4.0,"Great and cute, but was a pain getting it on the key ring"
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and it's a little long (about an inch), but most dresses are. It's very comfortable though."
4.0,my husband has a large head and this fits great
4.0,"Before ordering this beanie I checked customer reviews and saw that a purchaser put a cell phone inside and in effect no signals came through. I've had sleep problems for at least a year because sometimes I hear Morse Code in my left ear, and other times pain that comes and goes on the right sight of my head. The beanie cap takes them away.  Only problem is, it's a small size, and the silver threads only start midway to the crown. I have to constantly pull it down while I sleep. But I also wear it in the daytime and am very glad I found it."
4.0,"The dress is super cute, fit super well (before washing) and is  so comfortable but Before wearing I Put it through a quick wash cycle in cold water and it ended up shrinking several inches (probably like 5 or 6 inches) in length  and a few inches in the arms.  I loved the dress But now can’t wear it for the purpose of Temple service where I need a full length dress so it will probably end up being a beach dress.  I’m considering purchasing a medium instead of a small And never washing it lol but the problem is it shrunk in length but not in girth and a medium would give me another inch for shrinking in length but  I Would also need the girth to shrink."
4.0,"Well when I first got it and wore it, it felt great! But after I washed it and such it was extremely small for me and I cant even wear it now. But the material it is made out of is amazing. It feels so good, but it is a little tight. I have only wore them once so i cant make a big review but they were great."
4.0,These fit my sons Oakley prescription glasses perfectly.
4.0,"They are nice and stretchy but I'm a size 11, really not meant for my size but ok."
4.0,Nice travel board.
4.0,Love this dress.  It was tacky but really cute.  Fit perfect and very comfortable.  The only thing that would have made it better is if it had pockets.
4.0,Love the feel of these masks
4.0,"The basic pearl studs to go with the basic string of pearls. If you are a real fashion plate, you have to have them. If you can't have the real ones, you need a decent set of false ones, and these will do nicely. Simple studs for pierced ears with sterling silver fittings."
4.0,Fits nicely but first time in the dryer the graphic melted a little. Emailed the company about it and they sent out a new one right away. Just be careful when you dry the shirts to keep it on a lower setting.
4.0,"Wife loves it. Fits great. Super soft. The only issue we had was that it didn't smell that good, to the extent that my wife asked me to put it in the trunk of the car while we were at a graduation party. After a run in the washing machine, all was well."
4.0,Good for Halloween or anything else
4.0,"I thought the pendant would be bigger but it a nice looking necklace.  Just order the earrings to go with it,"
4.0,It fit pretty well!
4.0,"Not bad for the price,you need to wash them in warm water and hang out to dry,would definitely buy again."
4.0,This funky nightshirt was just the ticket.  Hard to talk about sizing when it only comes in one size.  Was the perfect gift for someone who loves Maine.
4.0,"They look nice, my wife likes them, they look to be decent quality. Fast shipping. Good paskaging."
4.0,They look and feel great but I'm not convinced that they are polarized
4.0,"Durability has been great. I use these under my shorts to play indoor soccer and they have withstood the abuse of me diving every which way as I often play keeper, definitely better than some of the expensive name brands out there as far as durability goes. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they are extremely long (maybe I just have short legs)"
4.0,This dress looks and fits great. It is beautiful and was perfect for the occasion.
4.0,"cool hat. Like the thickly stitched ""M"" especially."
4.0,As expected.  One did lose a screw when first opened but had another on hand so was able to fix.
4.0,Cute the only disappointment was that the color was almost white.
4.0,Super cute shirt. I ordered an extra large and it fits the way I figured it would
4.0,"Beautiful and great size, the only downfall is i ended up being allergic to the metal."
4.0,I have worn this a view times and really enjoy it. Hasnt broke yet and overall Im happy with it!
4.0,Fit like I expected.
4.0,Fits a little small but still fits.
4.0,I really liked this dress! I wish they made more colors.  Maybe more fall colors would be very pretty.
4.0,"Love this and get complements every time I wear it.<br /><br />It is thin material,  not wool, not warm"
4.0,"Works like it's supposed to.  Be mindful of the power cord, easily slips out of back of the box."
4.0,"Great sweatshirt, fits well and of good quality- her new favorite. Only negative is the price."
4.0,"Comfortable, looks nice. I have super small wrists so I cut the band and now it’s fine. I have it on the second notch."
4.0,These are really beautiful and comfortable. I ordered a size too large so they are too loose but that's my fault! I will be trying a smaller size.
4.0,"I am 5’4” 135 pounds fairly large chested and I got a small and I love how it fits, comfy and a good quality material."
4.0,"works well, but carrying case unnecessary and in the way"
4.0,So far so good....just didn't give it five stars until I wash it a couple of times.
4.0,Bought to help with the problem of wearing masks and Hearing Aids at same time. Several times my husband would take his mask off and loose his hearing aid because they would catch on the mask strings.  These work pretty well to illimenate that problem.
4.0,"The socks are nice. The length could be a little bit longer, but do work for the purpose we needed."
4.0,The set overall is great but it is made for a toddler vs a preschooler. I can make the suspenders and tie work but the hat is too small.
4.0,This was a very nice shrug; it was just too big.  The material was nice and thick and great quality. I would suggest you size down though when you purchase clothes from Lindy Bop.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, material soft and buttery. I wished this had fit me, as I loved the dress. I am 5'2&#34; and just too short and &#34;round&#34;.  This dress made me look like I was pregnant. It would look great on a taller person."
4.0,I really liked the style and feel of this dress! I’m normally between a size 0 sometime 2 but I have a larger bust (34 DD) so everywhere fit except my chest area was too tight. I’d recommend getting one size up if you have a larger chest area!
4.0,"Ring was a teeny bit tight, but other wise this was great! Everyone loved it one me and my friends were jealous!"
4.0,So happy! Fits my body type perfectly. Im 5'8 with no boobs but thighs and a butt so it works well for my body type i ordered a L. But i wish there was padding in the top so its not nip city. Thankfully i ordered black so it shouldnt be a problem just not the most flattering without padding since i have no<br />Boobies:( lol
4.0,Husband needed a shoe horn for use with a new pair of shoes. Where does someone get a shoe horn these days? Amazon of course! This one is long enough to use while sitting and sturdy enough not to bend. Heartily recommend it.
4.0,"Well made, warm, and hilarious! Bought it as a gift!"
4.0,Very cute but the first week I lost one of the balls ( somehow unscrewed) but the other has last months
4.0,"I ordered these boots as a replacement for Ugg boots that I had also ordered.  My calves are pretty muscular and I have a hard time finding boots.  The Uggs were too tight so I returned them and ordered these instead.  They are much nicer than Uggs.  The color is awesome as is the style.  The boot fits very nice, not snug but nice.  I still have a little space!  I own many Born pairs of shoes, they are quality products for sure."
4.0,Pinches at the nose a bit but never leaks!
4.0,"These shirts are form-fitting, which is a look I found a bit odd on my chunky toddler ;) But, I do like that the backs come down a little longer than the front. Length-wise, I think they fit great. They are just a little tight in the mid-section and short/tight around the sleeves. I think that's how they are supposed to fit (you can even see the slim shape from the photo) - it just looks weird on my kid. She's wearing them anyway, though. I think they will be nice under something."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:314589563b238920de97a8b3fbbf80ea]] Wish there was a bit more lower tummy control but otherwise I love these!! Sooooo comfortable.  Contour on back sits in the perfect spot, love the detailing and fits very true to size! Will probably get another color.. or two :)"
4.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and the waist was much too high. Beautiful fabric but it smelled like oil. I ordered a large expecting it to be roomy, but it was tight."
4.0,Replacing a very old Russel sweatshirt; I liked the plush finish for the inside surface.
4.0,The title of the product is a bit deceiving. It says sports bralette but actually it's a swimwear top. It's cute and it fit well enough so I'm keeping it but I think they should accurately title the product.
4.0,A bit heavy but durable.  Will protect your face from the sun.
4.0,"Love the different colors of these glasses! They are lightweight and the fit and look is perfect. My only complaint is that after about 3 weeks the rubber nose pads fell off of 3 of the pairs, which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I'm buying the set again though and give them a second shot because I really like them otherwise and they are cheap enough."
4.0,good price. I hope they keep their shape after a few washes.<br />I certainly will be wearing them everyday.
4.0,I like the fit but thought they'd be a little thicker than they were. They are long enough before wash. I'm 5'7 and they were long enough for me.
4.0,I really like it and so does my boyfriend. Smaller sizes should be available though.
4.0,Perfect for most occasions.
4.0,Great for everyday use and imo the most comfortable gauges to sleep in.
4.0,good quality.  just wish PASSPORT wasn't stamped on it.
4.0,"Light weight, much smaller than anticipated still<br />Good looking though."
4.0,"Perfect fit with medium size (155 lbs, 5’10”).  I love the design of the shirt with the very contrasting colors at the front seam.  The stitching is good without any egregiously loose seam or strings.  The arms aren’t constricting at all and movement is good.  My only complaint is the buttons, there are just too many of them compared to a typical dress shirt, also since they are square, it’ll be tough to find replacements for them.  Please note - this review is based off of a review sample from the vendor.  If you think this review was helpful, I’d greatly appreciate your feedback & support by clicking on the &#34;Yes&#34; button below.  Thanks!  : )"
4.0,"Gloves are made from thin material and I don't expect them to hold  up too much heavy use, but that's the benefit of buying 10 pair at a reasonable price. The gloves run small and I have small hands so they fit perfectly well for me.  But if you need a medium size, these probably will not work for you."
4.0,e sure to go up at least 2 sizes for a decent fit and 3 for a loose fit.  Love the colors and material is soft and stretchy.
4.0,Great casual shoe. Sole is not slippery.
4.0,Very nice present
4.0,"I bought an XL and I wear a size 14.  It fits fine, but it's a little tight in the upper arms.  I do like that it's fairly light weight, as I get hot easily.  Very stylish to throw over a t-shirt."
4.0,"They are really nice quality and sharp looking but they run very small. When I put my foot in, it wasn't just a matter of too narrow,  my foot felt like it was just being mashed to the point of painful. Something that runs a little small will have you trying to decide if you think they'll stretch or not, these size 10s definitely feel like they are 9s or less.<br /><br />They are beautiful boots and I really would have loved to be able to wear them."
4.0,Not the best for big boobs
4.0,"I was very happily surprised with this dress especially for the price I paid on amazon. I am 5’7, athletic build at 138#. I got the medium based on chart and it fits nicely. Granted I could’ve prob worn the small bc it’s stretchy material but it may have been a bit snug which would look less classy and prob less comfy. The sleeves are snug on medium which makes me worry about any smaller. This will be good for weddings, semi formal events, dancing etc. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn’t so wrinkled. I will have to iron. Just got it so no feedback on long term use. Also I feel this dress would be appropriate for anyone age 16-96. Tasteful. I got navy."
4.0,"The shirts is nice, my only complaint is that it isn't very shapely, and it just hangs."
4.0,", packaging was not very good. Other than that it is beautiful."
4.0,"Kinda big but it feels amazing, not bad at all. The green color is amazing! Would order a large next time."
4.0,smaller than expected but pretty
4.0,my boobs are too big and makes the dress really short. I think it will be okay if I wear tights with it.
4.0,Nice and fit perfect
4.0,"Very thin. Pockets don’t stay put but decent product for the price. I’m 5’1, 145lbs, 36DD and got a medium, fits great."
4.0,"This dress is made of nice material & the print is adorable, BUT, the cut is really nothing like the dress on the model.<br />However, it’s cute so I’m keeping it."
4.0,"Is over sized for a medium.  I wear a 7 1/4 and have to use the internal adjustment strap as much as it will pull (just a strip with velcro) for tension.  Quality is great, and it seems durable.  I wear it with back turned up, and front brim snapped down.  Over a few months, it has softened and gotten a roll to the inner part of the brim, that takes away from the snap down action.  Even so, very nice looking hat that is great for really casual outside wear (eg, beach wear), and classy enough to wear with business casual."
4.0,"Have not tried it yet , but seems ok."
4.0,"Works well, if you don't mind trying to get each toe into its proper spot. They were just as expected. I do feel as if they slip a little but, not to terribly bad."
4.0,I only got one pair. It seems good but could scratch easily.
4.0,"I got the bag in October 2014. I really like it, it could be a little bigger, but it's perfect for work. I do have to say that in the last week one of the handles has had the sewing give out and the 'stuffing' is pushing out of it. I use it Mon-Fri, so maybe that's too much wear and tear on the commute. So I don't know how to rate this since it's great other than that, no warping of the bag it's self, just a handle issue that I'll have to figure out how to fix."
4.0,"Very nice shirt but sizing is off (runs small). Luckily, I read the reviews & knew to upsize. I normally wear a medium or large dress shirt but got this in a 2X. It fit perfectly & I'm pleased."
4.0,Fits my 7 inch wrist very comfortably
4.0,We love the lunch box. Very roomy inside and sturdy.  Will buy other products from you.
4.0,I love daisies and I love green! Such a fun cheerful sweater. A cool feature some of the daisies have a raised center. The sweater itself is a mid weight dense poly/acrylic blend  . I’m 5’2 between a 8/10 and I purchased the L but I could probably fit in the M as well but I like room in my sweaters and wasn’t sure on the fit of this one. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact it has a slight damp odor so I’m going to throw it in the wash and see if that helps.
4.0,Thinner than I'd hoped for but not bad overall.  There is quite a colorful overall assortment.
4.0,"Overall, it’s a good dress for the price. I did feel like it made me look a little wide in the hip area because of where the ruffles hit. I’m about 140 pounds and 5’3” and ordered a medium for reference."
4.0,"I can see how this jacket might breakdown more easily over a short amount of time, but after one use so far, it is still holding up well (-I may report back again if this changes soon).<br />Very cute and water-shielding!!! :)"
4.0,"It is cute, not quite big enough for my S22 ultra but I like it. I got it to be a work purse so it will probably  do the job.  The zipper on the smaller pocket sticks and I've decided not to use that pocket for now.  It's simple but cute. The red color looks good with the gold zippers."
4.0,"Comfortable, washed well, comes with insert filters. Still good up."
4.0,"I actually really like this dress. I’m not sure how long it will hold up, some of the threading was out when I got it but I ordered a 2xl when I’m normally an XL. It is a good oversized flowy dress. I’m 5’6 and it’s a good length."
4.0,I usually buy medium clothing on amazon - the medium and large were too tight and the XL - which was the only one that would come in time - barely fit. I’m 5’-4” and 160lbs - 39” inch waist.
4.0,I love these for running - especially love the drawstring.  They are a bit more snug than my normal size though.  I bought one size bigger than I normally wear.
4.0,Very nice fascinator.  The pink was a bit brighter than I expected but it is very pretty.  My only problem was the packaging.  Would have been nice if it came in a box so that it wouldn't get squeezed.
4.0,Muy fuertes.
4.0,"The 32nd degree cap is only worn during stated meetings. They are somewhat fragile, and certainly not meant to be left on a shelf unprotected. During periods of storage and in travel these hats need protection. This zippered box with the carry handle fulfills this need."
4.0,"This is a cute skirt, but bring your static guard!  The pattern is great, colors are dyed well.  The peacock feathers at the end of the tassels/belt are genuine peacock feathers, so that's a really nice authentic touch.  The length is great, goes all the way to the ankles, just above the shoes, which is perfect.  The best part about this skirt is that it can be dressed up or down; wear heels, flats, boots, whatever you want, it'll work.  The tag, for some reason, says 4, but I ordered a large.  Fits tight, but still fits well.  I get compliments every time I wear it!<br />The only trouble is cleaning.  I don't think I want to put feathers through the wash machine, so I'll have to dry clean or hand-wash.<br />I received this product at a discount for my review."
4.0,For my neice for christmas.  She liked it. I ordered this and several other scarves from amazon. They arrived flat in plastic and looked a little cheap at first.  Once I took them out of the package and fluffed them up they looked really pretty.  I put all of them into the same gift box so that she opened it to see four pretty fluffed scarves instead of four flat ones.
4.0,"lovely chain it can be worn on a formal occasion, great price as well. it makes you stand out , i just love the silver"
4.0,Not as comfortable as I was expecting.  The material is a bit coarse.  The color is just as pictured.
4.0,"This was perfect for what we needed it for.  My daughter is 28 lbs, I think a pretty typical almost 2 year old.  I wish it was a little longer but overall met its purpose."
4.0,Very pretty shirt.  Fits larger than expected.  Pink color is more of a &#34;Coral&#34; Color Attractive.  Have not worn it yet.  Came with Tags which was nice.
4.0,Nice looking comfortable shoe.
4.0,"The twist design moves around and hikes the dress up while your walking, kinda of annoying"
4.0,"These gloves are stunning and are an elegant accessory for any Bride. The detail of lace, ribbons, bows and rhinestones are in perfect balance, without being too overwhelming. A bride is meant to be beautiful from head to toe, and these gloves on a pretty manicured hand will look great in the wedding photos, especially the cutting of the cake photos, or the Brides hand resting over the Grooms hand photos. The Edith.qi Lace Bridal Wedding Formal Bow Fingerless Short Gloves are well made too with careful attention given to the stitching and attachment of the embellishments. Everything is sewn securely in place. The shape of the lace base is an interesting choice in design as the elongated shape makes the hand look slim and elongated. It's even pretty from the back too as the satin ribbon criss crosses over the wrist creating a lovely X pattern over the wrist and topped with the tied bow. Balance is always the key to good design. My Niece, the Bride to be is in love with the gloves, and will look gorgeous in them.<br /><br />** I dedicate many hours per week testing and reviewing products offered on Amazon. I'm offered products free or at a discount in exchange for my reviews. This in no way obligates me in any way to leave 5 star reviews as some may think. I love to try out new things and enjoy helping other make wise shopping decisions.I myself rely on reviews before making purchases and feel it's a great service to provide for others."
4.0,"They are super cute, but the material is kinda rough and hard to break in, also they do fit a bit snug at first."
4.0,Pretty but too small. I probably needed a bigger size.
4.0,Its a little big.
4.0,"The dress zipper should have been the kind that zip all the way down, instead of in the middle of the dress."
4.0,The colors were bright and looked exactly like the pictures.
4.0,"A second velcro strap mean you need to remove 2 straps. Better with just one, keep things simple"
4.0,nothing to dislike.
4.0,"Just a bit shorter than I'd imagined. And the small is still a bit large in some areas, buut oh well. Still really nice."
4.0,THE DESIGN IS GREAT AND IT LOOKS GOOD. THE ONLY THING IS THAT IT ISN'T VERY WARM FOR BEING A SWEATSHIRT. IT IS PRETTY THIN MATERIAL FOR A SWEATSHIRT
4.0,"The hat is kinda big for my baby, scarf is cute. My 12 months baby is a small baby on his age!. Great for the price, not the best quality in the world for $5! So don't expect first class quality when you are paying $5. It does has a strong smell when I received it. I wash twice to get rid of smell."
4.0,They are great except fot the fact they are made in China
4.0,"Great value and lovely print. Personally doesn’t work for me. The waist band cuts right in the middle of my stomach which makes this boxier than I imagined. Since this is the 2nd dress I own from this brand, I’m overall happy! I’m 5’7” and the large is perfect."
4.0,"It's hilarious. A bit big, but we love it."
4.0,Can't go wrong with a pair of red panties. Good quality and perfect. I'd recommend them.
4.0,"These are wonderful leggings! Make sure to read the description in the photos before buying because the description helps understand the fabric thickness and is true to their explanation.<br /><br />I love the “contour” these leggings have and fit me really well. I’m 5’5”, 180lbs and carry some weight in my midsection, but these fit me very well."
4.0,"Decent buy for the money, but the reversed zipper is annoying loud too."
4.0,No complaints from my daughter for issue she has to wear for choir
4.0,"Super comfortable and supportive!! However, I’ve had them for maybe 5 months and the strings are coming off and it doesn’t look clean."
4.0,Fit beautiful. Need to be pressed after washing because seems Drew up a bit. Very comfortable though. Fit kinda tight in boob are so if above a C cup might be snug.
4.0,The morph suit worked well... I wish the zipper was accessible without needing help from another person
4.0,"It's comfortable, a little wide but I like it"
4.0,Lots of compliments.  Very comfortable wash and wear.
4.0,These jeans re well made however I am 5’4 so they need to be altered.
4.0,Very comfortable. Just a tad small
4.0,For my 12 yr old who wears a size 0 perfectly. Kinda see through.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 140 lbs,  ordered XL per Amazon size chart.  Company description of waist measurements matches my hip size.<br />Fits me nicely, perfect on shoulders, loose in waist, narrow past my hips.<br />Very short though, comes up over my butt if i raise my arms high."
4.0,"Bought a XL. Fits nice. I’m 5’2, 195lbs and have a DDD/E chest. Only complaint is that it’s super short. I knew it’d be short but this doesn’t really cover my butt. Leggings will look cute. Nice material. Stretchy."
4.0,Nice material.  Fit is good.
4.0,It does the job it says
4.0,"Nice, clean, simple look"
4.0,"I ordered these for a trip, just in case. They arrived on time and in good shape.  But I ended up returning them, only because I found a pair at the dollar store and didn't really need 6 pair.  We ended up not even needing the ones from the dollar store."
4.0,"These are beautiful chain earrings. The reason I gave 4 stars is because it is not a Lightweight earrings, but the description states that they are lightweight."
4.0,Great dress Wish it was longer. I am 5”9 and it hit Half calf. Size it fits. Great though!
4.0,Great ring nice quality just think Mom could have been a little bigger but I love it anyway
4.0,Somewhat large but a lovely blouse
4.0,"the price might seem high, but this shirt is made high quality.  its not made of cheap material."
4.0,"Backs of the studs are kind of a pain to screw in. Wish it came with a blue stud too. the Loops are a little big on my ears... so it looked girly if you ask me. I never wear the loops. Studs look cool though. good price, would recommend."
4.0,"These will leave your ears black, the paint comes off, I've had them for months and they still rub off, but they're super cheap so I can't really complain too much.."
4.0,Quality of material a little flimsy.
4.0,"I really like these over the Oakley ear socks. It is a good thing too. Oakley stopped making the replacements years ago. This allows walleva to charge what ever they want to manufacture these kits. These kits are over priced by 200%. At best a kit should be worth 3 bucks plus shipping. But, I will keep paying it until my xmetals break. F my life."
4.0,Secure zipper pockets big enough for a phone
4.0,Good Ilike it
4.0,I Love this swimsuit cover up.  Thin and feels nice while looking great.  The waist was a bit high but overall it looked and felt great.  Wish there were more colors.
4.0,Fits a bit large and loose. I would prefer there not be a upf sticker fused to the bottom front of the jacket. Sun protection seems to be quite good.
4.0,Im 6' 215lbs with a bit of belly and these are skin tight in a large. This is good for me cuz I wear them as a base layer for cycling. They are kinda &#34;scratchy&#34; but I think they'll get softer in time.
4.0,"The pj's are very comfortable. The top opens between the buttons when you move around. Other than that, they are okay."
4.0,Runs very large on me. Very long.
4.0,I love this top! The material doesn't wrinkle easily which I love!! However it does run a little small.
4.0,Loved it except I thought it had pockets but didn't
4.0,El material no es muy grueso y párese que en pocos usos se va a dañar
4.0,Not exactly the same color as the watch face but good enough.
4.0,Worked great! My husband wore it as his Halloween costume and got lots of compliments.
4.0,Great colors and prints. Slightly hard to get fastened
4.0,They are thinner than I expected and the heart for her to wear is really small but they are very cute
4.0,"This is very cute and my grandson is very happy with it but I was just a little disappointed because it's just a little too wide to fit into a little guy's pocket.  Other than that, it was exactly like I was expecting and is a great gift for a Thomas lover."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:137b998d54ee3df0c5690499f2098cdd]] i don't ever take this bracelet off so i guess it's only natural the embellishments began to separate, i still like the bracelet though!"
4.0,"It's large, lush and lovely!"
4.0,"I liked the size, but I must have failed to notice that a chain would not be included with the order, and I had to find one that was heavy enough to keep the pendant laying flat."
4.0,"Nice colors.  If I was to change anything, it would be the loop.  It needs to be a little bigger.  But overall, satisfied."
4.0,"For the price, it's a very fun little gadget to have around. Sound is what you'd expect for having absolutely no seal whatsoever, but IMO not even that bad. There are some normal beanies that cost more than this too, so I'm not complaining."
4.0,but it is nice
4.0,Nice set of Nato straps. The leather one is very thin and looks a bit cheap. I would not put it on a watch that costs more than $50. The tricolore one is all about style.
4.0,Comfy to wear and cute
4.0,I was cute
4.0,My 7 year old son is pleased with these glasses. They fit him well and the colors and design appeal to him.
4.0,"Not sure how waterproof it is, but love the patter. The insert is soft and warm. Seems well made."
4.0,"Very cute shirt, but the sizes are way off! Luckily I ordered my shirt two sizes up because of previous posts complaining about size issues."
4.0,Love for nights out for something more fancy
4.0,"Nice quality but runs smaller or skinnier fingers, made in China where their hands are smaller I guess?"
4.0,"I own many watches none of which are super  expensive where you have to wear a fake in case of theft. I say that because I have friend who owns a Rolex but wears the knock off in case he gets ripped off. If you have to worry about that why own an expensive watch? Hence I own everyday, everyman watches that are just an accessory to clothing and a lifelong habit. I am a Dodger baseball fan and needed a blue watch to compliment jeans and q Dodger blue jersey. This  fits the bill perfectly with one slight flaw. The little hand is about two numbers off of where it should be. For example if it is two o'clock the hour indicating arm will not point directly at the two o'clock but rather on the 8 minutes. This is most noticeable as the top of the hour approaches or has passed. I think it is not noticeable to many eyes as I've asked people if they notice anything odd or different about my new watch. The answers are hilarious and never that the small hand is off by two places. I plan to take it to my watch jeweler to see if he can fix it so it lines up perfectly. Otherwise  it is a good basic watch you can wear for any casual event. It looks great with jeans and blue ensemble. I think the flaw is just one of those things and not a constant with all the watches. It's a cool everyday watch  for any man. It would make a good gift for a young person as well."
4.0,"Not super supportive, but great for low impact activities! Good quality and great fit."
4.0,Fits smaller for someone who has big boobs in the chest area. Otherwise beautiful dres.
4.0,Good but bit hard to use.
4.0,Super cute for the cost! It's purple NOT brown
4.0,I'm enjoying my new scarf. It's soft<br />around my neck and  goes great with my outfits.  But 4 Stars only because<br />it's not long enough
4.0,A little loose through the torso for use in water.  Great on land.
4.0,"fits well, but shows cleavage, good thing is that it has a somewhat of a girdle consistency, arrived quickly"
4.0,"They’re comfortable, look good, and provide good support."
4.0,"I needed a larger size (which was my fault, not the product's), but even still, I believe a larger size would also have been a little difficult to put on. This bra doesn't have a ton of stretch, which is okay while it's on, but it can be a pain to maneuver while taking it on and off. The straps are a little thicker and there's more coverage than I was looking for, but those features are probably nice if you need a little more support."
4.0,Nice cap for working out. I do wish the elastic band was a little bit smaller but it doesn't stop me from wearing it every eorkout.
4.0,They are really nice addition to my steampunk outfit.
4.0,"I got this shirt hoping to cover some of my tattoo for work but as you can see in the pictures the sleeves are still see-through. The material is comfy and stretchy, too. I ordered a small but the shirt I received has a lot of extra material to it and is decently loose fitting. I'm not a tiny person so I expected it would be a bit more form fitting."
4.0,"Okay product. Slightly tighter at the waist than expected. Overall, okay."
4.0,A bit long on both med and large
4.0,"I actually really liked this dress! I’m 200 lbs 5’6” and I usually wear xl or size 16 dresses with a C cup. I ordered this in an XL it fit pretty good. The bust is pretty tight across the chest, I was worried about the zipper so I bought little hooks to sew into the top to make sure it didn’t slip, then I sewed a hook in the middle to keep the zipper from busting when I decided to bust a move! Lol it probably wouldn’t have but I was just really cautious!<br />I wore this to a bachelorette where all the girls wore black. When I couldn’t find a good enough dress at the mall I took to amazon!<br />This dress was pretty and flattering.<br />I’ll probably wear it again 👌"
4.0,"Super soft and good quality. I didn’t really find it oversized. I’m 5’7, 120 pounds, and ordered a small. It fits just like a normal pullover. I think if I had known, I would have gone with a medium for a more oversized fit."
4.0,"This is a costume and fits and feels like any costume you would get out of a bag at a Halloween store: disappointing and overpriced. That being said, it looks good on and the colors are great. It doesn't wrinkle easily and my child will get a ton of mileage out of it."
4.0,Bought as a gift. Recipient loves it.
4.0,Very cute. You can also take the locket out. And wear the gold back on the back. So you would only show the pearls only.
4.0,very comfortable and soft fabric.  Only concern is the tassels and washing the garment.
4.0,Good value for the price paid.
4.0,"Nice cardigan! I typically wear a size Large, but ordered this in an XL based on other reviews. It's still a bit too small to button up all the way, but that's not a problem for me because I bought it to wear open anyway. The color is as pictured, most similar to the top left of the photo (the rest of the photo is in a shadow). I like the button detail on the sleeves, and the buttons are SEWN on, unlike in some other button detailing where they're glued on! It is a pretty thin cardigan. Overall I would recommend it, just know that I had to size up (on some listings different colors are different sizes, not sure if that's the case here)."
4.0,Programming was confusing at first. I went online and there is a similar Wobl watch and used those instructions instead.
4.0,"I bought this beach bag to take to Ibiza, Spain and love the way it looks. My only issue is that the silver pieces are starting to come undone a bit. They are made out of material similar to Christmas Tree tinsel and woven through the material. I would give this bag a 5 if not for the durability."
4.0,"Fits great! The fabric is very thin and sort of see through, but the neck line and overall shape lets you wear a slip or tank top underneath. Super soft."
4.0,"I really liked these earrings. I got them because i had 6 holes pierced, 3 on each ear and the 3rd ones are closed and the 2nd holes are starting to which i want them to. The place where i went pierced one hole off and its very noticable. So need it to close to get em done right. My first holes are just fine but since my other holes are either closed or trying to close and i do want the 1st hole to stay open, i hurried and got these. I tried wearing them all the time, everyday and night. Cant do that. When i sleep with them on for acouple days i wake up from the back of the earrings hurting my ears. Ive never had that problem before with earrings. Maybe its cus i havent wore any in awhile. I dont know but its not that big a problem just have to remember to take them out at night and putting them back in next day. But i lost them doing that lol. Now im going to buy a new pair of these ones sometime soon."
4.0,These tinted glasses help me see the lights and dark fabrics when putting a quilt together.  I got the tip from another quilter but couldn't find them until I looked on Amazon!
4.0,"Not bad, but a little short, otherwise amazing and pretty 🤩"
4.0,The earrings were much bigger than I anticipated them to be.  I bought them as gifts to family members and they did like them but were kind of big.
4.0,"I bought a couple of pashmina style scarfs to wear on a recent trip to Europe.  This one was a fantastic choice for that use. It was relatively inexpensive so I didn't worry should something happen to it.  It was also a good weight and length for me.  While it did have a taped on vendor tag (instead of sewn on), after wearing if for a while, I was able to easily remove the tag without damage to the scarf nor leaving the tape on the fabric.  I chose a light blue color as a nod to ""The Blue Scarf"" movement."
4.0,"The fabric of the dress is nice, super comfortable! I bought size M, it fits me very well. There are pockets on both side of the dress, really convenient for me. I like it so much!"
4.0,Good for what I needed them for.
4.0,"I loved this dress! Wore it to a friends wedding, and felt so comfortable and beautiful. The only reason I am not giving this 5⭐️ Is because it was a little too tight in my chest area."
4.0,"go for it. it is what it is and if you're looking to dress up with it, it's perfect. Don't go thinkin' you're getting real jewelry cuz you definitely will be sad with what you get. for the price and the quality - it's not bad!"
4.0,Dress it up dress it down the lace is beautiful patten high neck size is as expected.
4.0,"Small but nice;  packaged nicely, too!"
4.0,like the feel
4.0,A great and comfortable tank. I just wish I could see the design too!
4.0,Adorable and heartfelt. My coworker loved it. Thank you!
4.0,it goods to have it
4.0,I am totally satisfied with this transaction. Thank You very Much!!
4.0,"I recently purchased this hat to wear on the golf course, in part to stay cool but also as a UV sunblock to prevent melanoma. It's every bit as nice looking as it appears in the photo. The cooling effect doesn't last as long as I would like, but that can be remedied by carrying a bottle of cold water with you and soaking it frequently. It also helps if you wipe off the brim to keep it from dripping."
4.0,"I have a 41"" waist and got the XXL. The waist felt like a good fit for me; not too tight, not too loose. The Skirt was actually more like 38"" long. I prefer that it be too long rather than too short. I will have to shorten it. The fabric is not stretchy so the sewing shouldn't be too bad. I wish that they had more length choices so i didn't have to sew it."
4.0,Very soft and cozy! I am glad I sized up!
4.0,"I love the style, fit and design of this shirt, but expected it to be warmer.for me it would have been perfect with flannel or fleece lining."
4.0,Bought this to wear for a Christmas party. I really like the design but its much thinner then sweat shirt material and will probably be ok with a thin shirt under. I do really like that it is long enough that I can wear it with some leggings. I usually wear small clothing and I bought a small and it fits as I would expect a sweat shirt to fit.
4.0,A little loose but still a good option.
4.0,"This is a very thin hoodie material that is better suited for the summer months. I am so glad I got this sleeveless mesh hoodie with open mesh around the arms. It comes in three colors, black, blue and gray, I ordered the blue. I do daily yoga and Barre and this has been a wonderful addition to my workout top collection. It is 95% Cotton and 5% Spandex, loose, soft, stretchy and I love the length, shorter in the front a little longer in the back with a rounded look. I wear a small and this fit me very well.<br /><br />I will wear this as a top in the warmer weather with a pair of shorts, jeans or leggings because it looks so good with anything. I have a very thin like tank top I wear underneath. You can also layer it in cooler weather with a light long sleeve shirt/sweater underneath. I know I will be wearing this whether for exercising or for a casual top."
4.0,The whole set runs small- shirt and shorts were still wearable but the socks were too small to even try. Ok quality.
4.0,"Kind of small compared to my six-year-old, but he was super happy with it and the rest of the kids were kind of jealous of it. Hasn't broke yet – blasted through Halloween night Festivities"
4.0,Fit great! Not a thick shirt more for spring or early fall but loved the quality and button details.
4.0,"I got the wrong size first, but my daughter happily claimed it. It was so soft and looked so good following a washing, that I bought another bigger size for me. If you're very busty you may need a shirt under it."
4.0,I like the garment.
4.0,"It was a gift , so hopefully it fit as expected."
4.0,"I'm on an extended vacation and realized I missed my all cotton bathrobe...Ordered this on Amazon Prime, for 20 bucks I had it in two days<br /><br />Not the best quality, but not the worst either"
4.0,I didn’t know these were pajamas.  I wear them under cardigans.🤷‍♀️
4.0,This suited our needs for a luau.  Print is colorful & vivid but material is very thin (almost like silk). Time will tell if this lasts after washing.
4.0,"I purchased this Expandable Wire Bracelet for Cancer Awareness for my wife as a gift. She has been slowly collecting Alex and Ani bracelets for a few years now. She has quite the collection. The one bracelet that she keeps asking for is a bangle bracelet to support me, I had brain cancer. Alex and Ani does not make one so I didn't think I would be able to buy her one.<br /><br />Then I found this one. Now it is not the same high quality as an Alex and Ani but it also costs a fraction of the price. This bracelet is nice and it is for an important cause to our family. I really liked the fact that it was made in the USA, by hand. I also like that a portion of the proceeds go to the American Cancer Society. It is awesome that this bracelet is offered for 17 types of cancer and one general cancer awareness one.<br /><br />The only real issue my wife had with this bracelet is the fact that it is really large. Because she has really skinny wrists and arms the bangle slides half way down her arm. Looking at the bright side, it won't get tangles with her other bangles.<br /><br /> I purchased this bangle bracelet for a discounted price for my unbiased review and honest opinion. My wife says it's a wonderful addition to her bracelet collection."
4.0,I like it a lot!  You can hear people on phone calls well and they can hear you as well.  The music blue toothed from your phone sounds good too!
4.0,"This was a little big for my almost 4 year old. Didn't quite stay up but made cuts for her ears and it helped. Love that it came with pockets for filters and even came with filters. Love the stretchyness. Could be a little thicker. But compared to other gators out there, this one is thicker than most."
4.0,"Material is nice, the zipper on the wrong side is annoying"
4.0,Really like this dress . I got it in medium i’m 5”2 and 168lb and it fit perfectly! If I was a bit taller it would have been way to short but I’m on the shorter side so it was just right .
4.0,They are good glasses just no mirror lens otherwise everything is good
4.0,"Received this wonderful purchase swiftly and in perfect condition, it's cute. Only thing I would advise the seller is to show the exact color of the purse because mine was more dark brown and with peach accents not black and peach so that's all. Great deal, seller is a swift shipper and an awesome perfect price!"
4.0,It's really good. 4 stars only because the original is so much better! There's something just a little too strange in this one too be great.
4.0,Too large for my child but in no way would I be allowed to return it!
4.0,I am short and the leggings would fit a taller person better than they did me. I'll still wear them and I like the print.
4.0,part of daughter's halloween costume - worked great
4.0,ITS VERY CUTE BUT IT RUNS REALLY BIG
4.0,Very cute but not enough coverage (I took a chance). Would like to see larger sizes offered.
4.0,Love these! So soft and smooth and the color is beautiful! Nice tummy control and they don't flatten my butt! Would love to get more colors!
4.0,the cut is small but nice quality and a good fit
4.0,"My wife likes the shirt very well, it's light and breathable."
4.0,good shoes for a good price.  time will tell.
4.0,"I really like them.Very cool looking on and off. But a bit worried about the hing on the arms. Its a single,like you see on wire rim glasses. Doubt if they'll last very long. I decided to keep. I will be useing in a RZR. Not as hard on them as on ATV. Cost wasn't that much. So going to risk it. And i do like the way they look."
4.0,"Going on a two week cruise is what made me look for a travel body pillow and I am so excited to have found this one. The is the only one I found to be of realistic length which is what makes it a BODY pillow. It inflates with a pump but in a pinch, will also inflate by holding a hair dryer up to it while depressing the valve. I'm sure it will make being away from my home body pillow bearable!"
4.0,I'm told they fitted well and were comfortable to wear all day.
4.0,"So the fabric its good quality, it looks as the pic, but i got a small and fits too big on the waist. I have several bandage dresses from other brands and im always small, this one you should get an XS. Im returning it cause i needed for tomorrow so.<br />Im 5’1” 125 lb"
4.0,"These are a little roomy but that is better than not being able to zip them up.  They come all the way to the Knee, love that!  Very comfortable, I would give them 5 stars but haven't had them long enough to see how well they wear over time."
4.0,"It's fine, but different color."
4.0,the arm length on it is somewhat short but i also have a bigger chest. still a super cute shirt!
4.0,"The texture of this sweatshirt is soft, very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Very pretty,  fair quality, but was just what I wanted."
4.0,"nice price, hard to screw on"
4.0,Love the colors...as described
4.0,"Lenses are great! Very clear and clean viewing. Have used for day drives, night drives, motorcycle rides, boat rides and shooting."
4.0,"The bikini is made very well. It's very comfortable and looks just like the picture. The top was a little large, but besides that it fits great! Definitely worth buying!"
4.0,I thought these would be too small for my 5 and 7 y/o but they fit well.
4.0,He will grow into them !!!
4.0,the flat top makes it very subtle which is what i love. i wish there was a bigger ball on the inside tho because i wind up bumping my nose and it falls out and then i can never find it.
4.0,This dress is beautiful! It looks a lot more expensive than it is. I got so many compliments wearing it. The only downside is the fabric is not the best. It’s a little thick and scratchy.
4.0,I ordered a 7.5 W but I didn’t realize it was men’s size. Oh well. I’ve still been wearing them. Comfy and perfect for out of the bath/poolside.
4.0,Fit well and are comfortable but I already notice some pilling after a couple washes so not sure how long they will hold up.
4.0,"This will be a nice dress for fall. Looking forward to wearing it with boots and a jean jacket. Very stretchy. I'm 5'4, 125lbs and got a size small. Plenty of room."
4.0,This is a VERY wide dress.  Great material and is not see through.
4.0,I brought this for my 7 yr old. It did run big but I didn’t want to buy something he can only wear one winter. It’s a lot thinner than the picture. The fur does detach from the hood which he loves. Overall this was a good purchase.
4.0,Good value for money and a decent fit.  Will probably buy again in the future.
4.0,Love these to use for swimming and lounging around the beach.  The longer length is perfect. Slightly large in the waist and the tie is more decorative than functional but they worked out fine.
4.0,This is a very nice necklace for my granddaughter.
4.0,The ring is beautiful and the gems have rich color. The only reason I didn't give it 5/5 is that the sizing runs a little small. It's an effort to take it on and off. Maybe size up if you're in between sizes.
4.0,"I like the feel of the material, nice texture and it fits well"
4.0,"What does ""Little Kid"" mean? Is it a youth size or toddler size?"
4.0,"This is a pretty freaky mask!  Although not quite as frightening as pictured, it was scary and my 7 year old loved it.  She had other kids running away from her on Halloween just from the sight of the mask."
4.0,Fit well. Thinner fabric than expected. The tears would tear more when you try to squat though...
4.0,Fabric feels really nice but there were some loose thread seams :/<br />Design and size very good
4.0,"Very sheer kimono. I do wish it was a little longer as it barely goes past the booty if you are using it as a swim coverup. It is not as crisp white as it is shown in pictures, but still a nice pattern."
4.0,"Was asked if I lost weight after being seen wearing this suit on more than one occasion, love it!"
4.0,"I like the color, material, and fit. The only complaint I have is that it gapes in the front. I had to stitch it to keep it from opening up."
4.0,A little disappointed in the quality of the print on the shirt.
4.0,"Nice, it's more beach wear not swim wear"
4.0,"Very colorful and seem comfortable from what my daughter says:-) I went with a bigger size, so she has room to grow. They are also lightweight! Hoping they last for awhile!"
4.0,Nicer pants than I thought they would be. They are thick though. Good for winter.
4.0,"This is quite an ugly pattern, but the silk itself is lovely!  It is quite silky.  However, it is very small, and would not work for my intended purpose of a nightly hair covering.  I have fine, thin, curly hair, and I could not get everything inside the scarf and tie it without having to tie it so tightly to the point of discomfort.  So, I have returned it."
4.0,"These were very nice and worked great.  Good value for the money.  The quality was good, but not as high as others I have used.  Overall, good product."
4.0,"A little tight, but cute as heck! I bought it to wear over my wrist tattoo."
4.0,"Bought as a gift from my wife... so that she will know I think of her sometimes...<br /><br />She said &#34;I love my new glasses&#34;...  Enough Said!<br /><br />There well made, stylish, and work as expected.  I found them a little pricy than the competition, so that would be something to consider.<br /><br />If this review is helpful to you in any way... then please show your appreciation by clicking &#34;Yes&#34; on &#34;this review was helpful.&#34;  I let's me know that it is worth my time to post reviews on items I buy.  I have always relied on reviews for my purchases... and in return am trying to pay back."
4.0,However Black comes off over time.
4.0,"Due to my ample breasts I wish it was a little longer,but I love them."
4.0,Great value. They are more clear than white though but still look great with my white watch. They are thicker than the ones my watch originally came with
4.0,The legs seem to run a little small.  Should have gotten a size larger.  These are the new 'target' weight clothes.
4.0,I thought came with pocket. But still comfortable.
4.0,"Very quiet as advertised. comes with multiple winding options. Works both with electricity and batteries (not included). It could be a bit more solid, specially its door. But, can’t complain since the price is well worth it."
4.0,I recently bought several eyeglass chains.  I bought these because the rubber ends on a band new eyeglass chains that I bought were faulty.  I almost lost my eyeglasses! I replaced the ends with these and very happy I did!  They work great!
4.0,was too big for my wrist
4.0,"As other reviewers have said, these ear plugs are definitely more comfortable than the foam disposables and far more convenient than ear muffs. I'm not sure I can tell any significant difference in the &#34;noise cancelling&#34; ability between these and the foam plugs however. I have received these at a discount but without any obligation to post a review. This review, therefore, is completely voluntary. It is also based on my evaluation of the product at its regular price, which in my opinion is a bit higher than I'd be willing to pay."
4.0,"Gloves are kinda thin as expected.<br />I thought they were orange and black as sometimes Bronco items are, but they are definitely orange and dark blue. I bought them for the new black coat I gave my husband for Christmas. They looked black and orange in the picture on Amazon"
4.0,"The jacket is bealtuful, but I had to exchange because is too small"
4.0,they both love them
4.0,"Like the design and fit! Needs a tag so that you know front vs back—I had trouble reaching the snaps, so maybe I had it on backwards?! LOL"
4.0,Bought as a gift and they absolutely loved it and wear it everyday.
4.0,"We like it. It was a smidge challenging to guess the size (I returned the 1st one!;) But, it fits well & my daughter likes it. I love the colors. It doesn't keep her super dry or warm when out in the snow."
4.0,"love it! Really practical, lots of room to throw in everything for a overnite stay or the beach etc. Need an organizer compartment to put inside if you want to find stuff easily. You can just fold in a tight log for a pair of pants, tees, underwear, socks etc. The material and stitching is 'superb'! Overall, I like this 'HOBO STYLED BAG'! It even has an outside zipper which was not shown and came as a surprise to me! It also has inside zip pocket, and 2 pockets for cell phone etc. although pockets are a bit shallow, I still find them useful.<br /><br />I ordered 2 of these bags; one in dark tan and the other in brick red...the colors are on spot; brick red not too red or dark. The dark tan the same.<br />Also, it is unisex styled ... so, I would recommend for either male or female and a MOST DEFINITE PLUS for students in college or school period."
4.0,If it okay. The string for the boobs was weak. I have large chest and the xl covered it but not really. The bottom fit but the waist part was a little big. I have a big butt so I recovered that part well. And the top is padded like a lot
4.0,"Fresco color agradable, pero muy chico lo regale"
4.0,It's a great shirt that I was hoping that it would actually fit long like it shows in the picture it doesn't come down very long on the waist so it rides up because it's that slick type of material
4.0,"Nice, rather small"
4.0,"Very pleased with the fit, the color and the durability."
4.0,Very cute! Just a bit small and short for hubby.<br />Wish it fit.... CUTE!
4.0,This dress is very comfortable and came in a cute pattern.
4.0,"Quality is great!!!  Unfortunately the company quickly ran out of all of the sizes and only offered extra large and large. I wanted the shirt so ordered the large, love the shirt but way too big so sorry I purchase it."
4.0,"What I like:<br />Very comfortable. Unisex passable. Quality seems decent, no tips or tears so far.<br /> Plenty of room for yoga, running, and lounging. Color matched picture.<br />This may be based on US sizing because my waist is 40"" (I've had my waist measured) and these fit just like my size 36 Wrangler jeans (which are actually 40 inches because vanity sizing is a real thing, look into it).<br />At 5' 11"" these fit perfectly. I wear them above my ankle but if I wanted I could lower them to my hip and wear below ankles.<br />What I don't like:<br />The waist has only half elastic band, located on the back, I understand that's the design, however it's not a good design. In my opinion run the elastic the full length of the waist. It would still achieve the look the maker wants while providing all around elastic.<br />Overall verdict:<br />I would definitely buy another pair, even though I don't care for the elastic design choice."
4.0,"If you want to wear it tight (as it's designed), it's a little challenging to get all the hooks fastened (if you don't have help). Other than that, really nice quality, comfortable, and sexy."
4.0,"If you love the IWC Big Pilot but you don't want to spend $20K, this watch is a lot of fun. Simple movement with minimal complications, so I'm assuming there's a perfectly sturdy Miyota movement in there, or similar. Hand wind is very retro, allows you to see everything through the display back. For the price, it's a ton of fun and elegance."
4.0,"I needed some solid colored ties to go with my patterned shirts, but was always frustrated with how ridiculously expensive ties are in stores. These may not be the highest quality ties around, but they look nice and are well worth the money I spent on them. The only thing I knocked them down for is that the fabric is a little trickier to get to tie correctly compared to higher quality ties, but overall I really do like them."
4.0,"Would be 5 stars if the sizing were accurate. I bought 2 shirts for my children, 10 year old and a 9 year old, they are pretty average sized kids - fit, average height . I love these shirts. Theyre so cool and fun. They do run a bit small. I added some shirts for scale. The navy blue shirt is a Walmart t-shirt size 10-12. The red is a boys medium. And the green shirt is an old navy boys size 10-12 medium.<br />The shirts i ordered are size 12-14, i thought id rather have too big over too small but they ended up being much smaller than i expected. The 12- 14 year olds i know are much bigger than these shirt sizes. These are straight from the mail and not washed and im hoping there wont be a lot of shrinkage. Id say order up one size for it to fit and order up two sizes if you like a looser fit or if your child is tall or heavy.<br />Aside from the sizing, the shirt is very cool and fun!"
4.0,Love the tiny stone. The plastic backing is uncomfortable. I also worry that the stone part will get caught on my shirt and fall out.
4.0,Great work watch
4.0,"The blue pictured is not what we received. The picture is lighter, more baby tealy aqua-y in color and what we received was a very dark blue and black. Daughter was disappointed with the color. HOWEVER, the functionality is great which is what &#34;I&#34; was after more so than the color. I made the mistake of letting her chose the colors. Anyway, they are well padded and fit her petite 10 year old hands well. I took a few jabs at our punching bag at home and they feel nice. I think the 12 oz weight I got her will suffice for her for quite some time as she's not a heavy hitter...yet. I'll update this review down the road after some mileage is obtained."
4.0,"As evaluated by others, the Dri-Power Fleece Crew is not a heavy weight sweatshirt, but more a medium-weight garment. The medium size I ordered does run true to size and fits my body well (5'6&#34;, 32&#34; waist, 145 lbs) with a little more room in the shoulders and chest than with other sweatshirts I've tried. There was minimal shrinkage, though some; the sweatshirt seems slightly tapered to the waist; and the fit is comfortable and roomy enough in the shoulders to allow easy movement. It is well made and sewn."
4.0,"While this is a really handsome leather belt that comes in a giftable drawstring bag, the sizing doesn’t work.<br />It’s marked 36 but was too small for my 36” pants-wearing guy (fit last hole which makes the end stick out).<br />It isn’t a slash size, like 34/36 or 36/38 & runs small for a 36” waist."
4.0,"I like it. The disks work great it locks securely. the bracelet part is large i have to clip the chain in a bit. the chain is rough it pulls my hair, i just have to be careful with it."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, love the ginkgo design. Can be dressed up or down super easily. Doesn't make a ton of noise, which I dislike in many other big statement necklaces. I took one star off because the backside of the necklace has a couple rough spots, I'll be careful not to wear a shirt that snags easily."
4.0,"My daughter is pretty much a perfect Medium (7/8) and the sleeves are definitely too short for her on this one. Otherwise the length is fine, but I think a sweater should be a little bigger/roomier. The design is cute and it's soft and nice quality otherwise. I would order a size up for sure. I don't think this will last the winter since it's almost on the verge of being too small now!"
4.0,"THE FIT WAS ABSOLUTLY HUGSE ON ME AND MADE ME LOOK LIKE LITTLE ORPHAN ANNGIE! jUST NEED A SMALLER SIZE PLEASE.<br />Thank YOU,<br />Christie Nielsen<br />13603 COLTER RD. CALDWELL, ID. 83607"
4.0,"Very pretty earrings.  However, they are much larger than I imagined, so they aren't something that I will wear."
4.0,"I think this is a childs watch because it is small. I can only get to the 3rd or 4th hole on the band to strap on my wrist. I don't have a big wrist so that's the problem for anyone who does, even the watch face itself is small. I only wear to work so it's not a big deal but the seller has it listed as mens adult watch and it's clearly not"
4.0,Great set for summer and is holding up well. Runs a little small but not too bad.
4.0,When I ordered these I imaging atleast two inch long earrings but sadly they were much smaller and close to an inch. They were so beautiful I debated between retiring them and keeping them. I ended up returning these because a similar product that I originally wanted came back into stock and I kept those instead. So if small beautiful earrings are what you're looking for then these are for you. **side note I ordered these for prom and they would've been prefect if I knew how small they were**
4.0,"These leggings do feel like leggings and they hug super tight for me. The listing says it's shapping so maybe that's why. They do huge the curves fairly well but in terms of comfort it's a little too tight for my comfort. Before meals, the material is soft and has a good amount of stretch. Depending on your place of work, I can see these working. Might be a little too form fitting for some places though. If that's the case, then I would recommend sizing up to be safe if these are for work. These can be dressed up and down with the pockets and jeans look in a dark wash. These didn't ride up so I was fairly happy with them!"
4.0,Medical alert bracelet
4.0,"I really like the dress. I generally wear a small, but have muscular arms and sometimes have trouble wth sleeves being too tight for my comfort. The sleeves on this dress are a bit snug, but not bad enough to return."
4.0,Authentic Wiley X Replacement Lenses.
4.0,The jacket is t shirt thick in some areas and fits just right for me. I bought a small and I'm 5'7&#34; 140lbs if that helps. The branding is kind of meh so I removed a majority of it so it looks cleaner.
4.0,I ordered a size up thinking the booths would be too tight. I love the color and style.
4.0,"very small stone for the price. but did have a gnat inclusion. Fairly quick delivery as well, I would purchase from them again."
4.0,good quality fits comfortably
4.0,"the dress is beautiful and i love it, there is just 1 problem it does not fit my back it cannot zip up, other than i am gonna loose some weight just to fit in it. wish the top of the dress had a little spandex."
4.0,I loved the colors and pattern but the shorts ran large and were thinner than I would like so I returned them.
4.0,"It is very nice, the colors go well together. I got a large. I am 5.5 and 140 lbs. The sleeves were slightly too tight when worn with a long sleeve t shirt. The chest was ok and then it got wider in a weird way at the mid section. It was a bad look. I am giving it to my 10 yr old (carters kids size 14)."
4.0,These run a bit small.
4.0,Had to reshape the hat had to be messed up in shipping. Quality could have been better buy i guess ok for the price
4.0,"This is a pretty pendant. A malachite bead is held in a,copper cage. The bead is smooth and hollow with a small hole. It hangs from an adjustable rope. There is a small ring that slides to change the length. It comes in a pretty box with a small metal clasp."
4.0,"Very nice bra.  My daughter wears it often. The only thing I did not like is it was shipped from China.  I like to have thing shipped from USA, Saves on the environment. I will not buy again because of that."
4.0,"These look sturdy and will come in very handy.  My only complaint is the color is no where near the picture.  The purple is more of a plum, not the bright purple pictured."
4.0,Generously sized with super soft fabric.
4.0,It would have been better if the size for medium was't so large.
4.0,"I bought this as a maternity dress for a wedding and I love it! It's not as long as the picture shows it to be, but I could have assumed it wouldn't be. Nonetheless, the length being down past my ankles is perfect length in my opinion. The material feels so soft and it's not too thick or too thin- even though it feels sheer, it's not at all. The top half is definitely made for bigger busted women though, it fits somewhat loose on me and I'm a 36C."
4.0,"It's looks amazing, but yeh the size of it not big like the one drake has thas why i gave it 4 stars if you were expecting it to be big af"
4.0,Good quality and designs
4.0,THEY ARE GOOD QUALITY BUT RUN CLOSER TO A CHILDS HANDS THAN AN ADULT.  I HAVE SMALL HANDS AND CAN ONLY FIT THESE ON MY PINKIES
4.0,"so far so good, got this for my niece. the fabric could be a little softer. but it does look cute on her."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable..went up 1 size based on reviews and fits great!!
4.0,"Super soft, super comfortable, super cute."
4.0,Really nice but extremely see through. Do not buy if you are self conscious because this dress will show EVERYTHING.
4.0,"Be careful with drying in a dryer, can shrink"
4.0,I like it but it is a little too tight in the body
4.0,"This corset is everything I was hoping it would be.  It's much more heavy duty than I expected: the fabric is think and tough, and the boning isn't flexible enough to become warped from long term wear.  I have a long torso and the long line model was perfect for me, although at a 34&#34; waist (I purchased XL) I could have probably gone another size down.  My only complaints are that it's pretty much impossible to fasten the closures unless you do them all at once (I fasten the front and then slip the corset over my head) and there is a small hole at the top of the enclosures where the boning sticks out.  I will probably just sew shut.  Overall, GREAT purchase."
4.0,I love the material and it fits well
4.0,"I have found no glove more comfortable for driving than these with exposed knuckles. There is a greater degree of<br />flexibility when steering and they hold the wheel...well !<br />The snap could be a little tighter when closed, but overall a great glove."
4.0,"ORDER UP!!!!! I am 5' 5'' and 130 pounds (muscular, athletic build I'd definitely still say I'm skinny lol) and usually I get a size small top and medium bottom (big booty judy over hur) and after reading the reviews I decided to order a LARGE because other people commented about it being too small. I am so happy I did, the suit looks amazing! the top is super adjustable so I think if you're usually a small or smaller medium in the chest the large top will fit well and the bottoms fit great (definitely cheeky but that's what I wanted). I only gave this suit 4 stars because I haven't worn it in the water yet and idk how functional it is but just off of appearance and fit this is 4 stars easily!!!! SO CHEAP TOO!!!"
4.0,"Lovely set, the bracelet was a bit big on my daughters hand"
4.0,"I purchased these leggings for the color but only had a medium, didn't think it would fit (too big), bit they fit perfectly. Now I think my other leggings are a bit too small( from other companies). They are soft and comfy. Will buy more.."
4.0,"For this ring being pretty darn cheap, it is surprisingly sturdy! The turtles have pretty amazing detail. The only draw back I found was the inscription on the inside of the band was EXTREMELY hard to read (picture kind of shows). However, I'm not upset with the overall quality of the ring."
4.0,"They are nice, but I didn’t realize the net panel would expose so much skin. Too much for my liking. I will wear them when working out to videos in the privacy of my home."
4.0,Love this swimsuit. The boob inserts are really bad though and ended up taking them out so they didnt look so unnatural
4.0,My grandaughter liked the dress. It fit her fine
4.0,"This review is for the Amy Alder Embroidered Calligraphy Dream Dolman Top. Overall it’s a great shirt and will be rotated through as a part of my regular wardrobe.<br /><br />Here are what I feel are the pros and cons about this shirt.<br /><br />Pros: I ordered it in blue and it is a beautiful, deep shade of blue. In the photo it almost looks periwinkle, but it’s not. I washed it before I wore it, as I do with all my new clothing. It held up well even through the dryer. The fabric did not pill up or fade. I wore it with a blazer and silver jewelry to work, which matched the stitching on the word. I love wearing the word DREAM across my chest. I really like all the scroll work in the design. It has a sense of whimsy about it without being too extravagant. I liked how it felt flowy and feminine while still being fairly conservative.<br /><br />Cons: The shirt was thinner than I expected and was a little too thin to be worn without a tank or layered with a thin tee underneath. Also, because of the dolman sleeves there is a large gap when you lift your arm up, so for modesty I definitely am glad I had a tank on under it. I didn’t like how the embroidery puckered a little once washed and dried. But that may have been because I dried it on hot, rather than the recommended setting. Also, it’s really tapered at the bottom. I am a 2x top and 18w on the bottom and it was snug around my waist and hips. It me it fit more like a 1x because of that tapering at the bottom. If I had to order again, I would have ordered a size larger, if that was available. If you are narrow in the middle this shirt would be great for you!<br />Overall I am giving this shirt a 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />*As a disclaimer, I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review of the product.

4.0,You really can sleep in these. For the cost an excellent deal!
4.0,Much more durable than expected for the price.
4.0,They're nice I got them for prom but ended up not wearing them because I found another pair
4.0,Purchased 2 grandsons for memorial services. Color was just right.
4.0,My wife likes them and actually uses them.
4.0,"I didn't know this was a watch when I bought it, I thought it was a key chain and was very pleasantly surprised. I love it, it's taking a little bit of a beating, but its holding up well"
4.0,Papell's clothes are always classy. I ordered this dress for a wedding but then it felt a bit heavy for a summer wedding so I  returned it. It was so pretty and well made though and it fit perfectly
4.0,"It’s good to know the persons actual size before trying to surprise them. I ordered this as a gift for my brother who is a kappa, he loved it , he said he had to get it resized but he loved it"
4.0,I really love anime and I was looking for an anime this one stood out to me because of the color and picture. The only reson why I gave it 4 stars is because it was tall but it didnt come out as far I was expecting. It only fit 4 folder and I had a little bit of trouble getting them out but the picture and printing were really good
4.0,"good product, little bit expensive than other web pages and sellers, you should reduce the price of it and I will buy 2 or 3 instead just 1"
4.0,"Cute crib shoe, not as soft as I expected it and runs pretty large but kept it for when my daughter is able to wear it."
4.0,bought for my mother with PAD. She had trouble getting them on but that is probably because of the gauge. I now have them and I think they are good quality.
4.0,"This is a cute hat, but is slightly wide at the bottom. Would have preferred it to be slightly more narrow so that it didn't seem like it was covering as much forehead."
4.0,"Nice sunglasses for the price. The stain is a bit too dark on the frames (would have liked to see a bit more wood grain), but other than that I’m happy with the purchase."
4.0,Great stuff to put inside a hat and get to wear it even on a small head!!!
4.0,"My mother loves gingerbread men so I bought this mask for her for Christmas since the gingerbread man has his own mask--too cute! She really liked it, but said it wasn't a thick enough material. Great price, though."
4.0,"This is a really nice item, but its for someone with a small wrist. I had to order another bracelet and transfered the charms. Cost me extra but it was worth it."
4.0,"I like the way these work.  They fit my wrist, but they are not long or stretchy enough to go over my hand easily.<br />The description did not mention that complication."
4.0,The fabric is cool something that can be worn even in a 90 degree weather. I am 5’3 so it was a bit long for me but other then that i love it !!
4.0,"I purchased one of these for me and one for my partner. He had never seen one before and he tried it on and was immediately hooked.<br /><br />It keeps me very warm in the house to the point where sometimes I'm a little too hot especially if I'm wearing warm slippers.<br /><br />The drawback I have found is when I have to use the bathroom, I have to unzip it and pull the top part down. That means the hood and the arms, and back of it well kind of scrunch up and it's sometimes touches the floor or the front of the toilet seat.<br /><br />That kind of grosses me out and I've tried different ways and generally if I have to go to the bathroom I'll take it off because I don't like my close to be touching a bathroom floor, even if it's mine LOL.  I would have given at 5 stars but the bathroom situation kind of makes things a little more difficult.<br /><br />I told my partner how lucky he is to be a man because all he has to do is unzip it and kind of pull it down and he said it doesn't answer down far enough so he also ends up with it kind of on the floor."
4.0,"I ordered a L was sent XL - so it was a litte on the big side.  I wear a 10/12. I ordered right before my trip, so no time to return.<br />Very flattering, cozy dress. Perfect material for travels.  I will buy another in M for my next trip."
4.0,These were a Christmas gift for my grandson that lives away from where I live so I can’t say they are good quality. The shark fin on the back of boot is cute!! Wish I could be more helpful.
4.0,lindo vestido me gusto
4.0,"Really love this coat so far.  Its been in the 40s the past two nights and I've been outside for hours and its kept me very warm.  I wear a 2x in womens shirts and ordered this a 3x hoping it would give me a bit more width in the shoulders and length in the arms, but in my opinion it fits like a 2x.  Its not too snug though so I will keep it to wear.  I have broader shoulders than the average women's clothing give and usually get stuck wearing mens coats for that reason, but i dislike how unflattering they are.  The sleeves on this coat are only slightly short and as i lose a little weight i am hoping that will help.  Its not a very thick coat but its lined with fleece making it very toasty.  I will try to review again as the Ohio winter approaches and I am in this coat in below zero temps."
4.0,NOT GOING TO SAY NO BOUNCE- I GO TO CYCLE CLASS & IT WORKS OK- TIGHT AROUND THE RIBS-BUT IT WORKS
4.0,It is a poor quality leather but I knew what to expect.
4.0,"Item arrived about 2 weeks past delivery date. However, very happy with this item. Well made, ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly. Goes very well with jeans, tank top and some ankle boots! I'm 5' 7"", 140#'s, ordered medium and fits nicely."
4.0,"Really like the quality and style. Exactly what I’ve been searching for and can’t beat the price. However, they are much smaller than I thought. I have a short neck so I thought they’d look bigger. The first pic is a comparison. They’re about the size of a quarter and much smaller than the pair I was trying to replicate. Second shows what they look like on. Cute and I will wear them, but will still continue the search for a larger pair."
4.0,I love this gown.  The material is very sleek and comfortable.  I only gave it a 4 rating due to it's size runs a little small.  I ordered a large as I like to wear loose gowns.  I normally wear a medium.  It fit more like a medium but is so comfortable I don't mind it fitting tighter than I like.
4.0,Looks just like the photo but too big for me may need an extra small
4.0,They are ok. They are plastic and hallow.
4.0,"Everything seems right about this ring. very nice design, fit, finish, you name it! gs"
4.0,"They look great. Nice colors. Two sets did not, could not, would not, clip in. Red and black. Really the colors I wanted 'cause the colors matched the original colors of my Gear Fit2 & they are the school colors of where I work. But oh well..."
4.0,Really helps with the glare. Only thing I don't like is there's no pads at the part behind your ears.
4.0,I have mixed feeling about the bra. I do like the back a lot and that it is a front closure. But it has a plastic clasp in front. I didnt like the cups the felt like they where smothering me too much coverage but i really like the back design. So I altered the cups and it fits well. Oh and the straps nee to be a little longer for more adjusting. Sorry All my opinion.
4.0,Very good material!
4.0,Very nice for the price.  I purchased the maroon and the beige.  I paired this with jean shorts.
4.0,I bought a large. I’m 5’9 175 with a 36D chest and it fit perfectly. The only reason I didn’t give a 5 is because it did shrink a bit in length.  I have worn it A LOT and there is some pilling near underarms. But I do LOVE the way this sweater looks and would order again in another color pattern.
4.0,"I have a TURTELLY necklace and this bracelet looks like it would match GREATLY! However, I don't usually like magnetic bracelets though.. I like a firm clasp better."
4.0,Like them it helped her be able to push off the wood floor so she didn’t slip when learning to crawl however she alway took them off 🤷🏻‍♀️
4.0,Super cute but ordered a size too large.  Sent back but will order a size smaller.
4.0,"Love it. Fits well, looks totally retro."
4.0,"Fit wel, they are tight. I wear under my bullet proof vest. Was tired of cotton!"
4.0,"Son muy bonitos, llegaron en buen estado pero a mi personalmente me suelen apretar mucho."
4.0,Nice.  Received compliments when I wore it.
4.0,Bought this for my coworkers and myself. It was a huge hit! They fit well and are comfortable. Very stretchy!
4.0,Loved them at first! Noticed they aren’t staying in place after a few washes. Would still buy again. Affordable enough to replace as needed!
4.0,I loved the red so much that I got myself the black one.
4.0,Good color and fit.  A little cheaper feel than expected; get what you pay for.  Fully satisfactory for occasional wear.
4.0,"I'm running between a medium and large in most sizes right now and I was drowning in this medium. Arms way too long and wide, although I could have made the length work. Otherwise it is soft and light but appears durable. I'll try again with a small."
4.0,"This fits well and looks wonderful. However, it is a little on the thin side. The color is bright and happy, and it washes well."
4.0,"Cute earrings, not too heavy. They are a hard shiny/polished black plastic, they aren't necessarily matte. They are cute; and for the price with free shipping you still can't beat that. Shipping is a little slow though."
4.0,Sexy and fits well!
4.0,Son loves the shoe just that one does not have any light
4.0,"Overall this dress is nice. The picture looks way better. I'm an XS to S in size and the S was the best I could get for this dress. It kinda swallowed me a little. If you're a medium, I would go for the small size.<br />I had to tailor the dress a bit to fit me better. The fringe is a little long too, I'm thinking of cutting an inch off of it to make it look a little better. With the fringe as is, it comes to my knees.<br />The dress is full beads and sequins as shown in the picture with a nice pattern. There is a beige slip behind the beaded part so there is full coverage, nothing is see through. The dress is nice, but it needed a few minor touches to be complete."
4.0,They are good quality for the price. Run small. They fit but are a little tight so I ordered a couple more in the next size up.
4.0,"These work well and are really light weight.  I have a large head/nose and these grip well and feel stable.  They are not comfortable enough to wear for more than a short time however.  They grip tighter than I would like for extended use but given that I plan to use them intermittently they will work well.  I do not think they will fall off.  Additionally the viewing area is small, seeming more like a clip-on bifocal lens.  This is not really bad but takes more getting used to if replacing traditional reading glasses."
4.0,I love these boots. They are especially good on ankle support
4.0,Cute to wear under a low neck tank. Gives it a little something special without feeling like I'm trying too hard or being too fussy.
4.0,To think for me but good quality
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. Somewhat concerned about the longevity... I've washed it once and it's already piling. The material is very thin.
4.0,"This is a good scarf for the price. The fabric has a good weight to it, not too thick and bulky and not too thin. Not rough and itchy to your skin, although it's not cashmere it has a good amount of softness. Color is like a rich dark camel.  Knocked off a star because the scarf sent to me had a run in it. But for the money, this is an awesome product and I recommend it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,A little tighter fit than expected.  Weird chemical smell. They are cute though
4.0,I wish there was a xsmall size and it would be perfect.
4.0,"Looks good, just like pictures but very boxey. Almost looks unisex except the neck and sleeves."
4.0,"Cute blouse, nice knit, soft and comfy.  Looks great with jeans.  Fits great.  Recommended."
4.0,"This  is a beautiful, quality made bag but sent it back for the one size bigger and double to price! Could hardly fit anything in this. You would only want to carry this for an evening out."
4.0,"Out of the three tops I ordered, this was the only one that fit to size."
4.0,Keeping track of my mask is often difficult with taking it off and on while out.  The mask helper is convenient to attach and is easy to let your mask drop off your face when needed but not having to lay it down and possibly lose it.
4.0,"This will work for some people but for me it was either too long as a mask ear loop holder/adjuster, though it holds the mask around my neck well, and too short as a lanyard to fit around my neck for keys.  I wanted this to clip on to my mask ear loops and to be able to tighten it at the back of my head so the elastic loops would take pressure off my ears and still hold it tight, but the cord (when tightened up) at the back of my head was a bit too long so it was not snug tight and slipped down a bit. Thinking I could also use it as a key lanyard around my neck it was too short."
4.0,"It was just what I was looking for, fits just right. The only problem was that I wanted another color but it didn't come in my size."
4.0,It's super cute! The band is thin but is quite strong.
4.0,"Love these rings! They're made really well, however be warned that they are on the smaller side, so for me they only fit on my ring and pinky fingers. However, these midi rings are very cute and I'd recommend them to others!"
4.0,"Very well crafted.  Nice feel to the leather, and love the color."
4.0,"Comfy lounge, casual dress/nightgown. I don't love the elastic but overall it is comfy and was cheap. I did a tack stitch to make it not so low cut but that was easy."
4.0,"The gold pair is amazing in person. I received so many compliments. As previously stated in another review, they are NOT good for standing for long periods. If you are going somewhere and will sit most of the time and maybe dancing on occasion, these are perfect"
4.0,"I bought this beautiful dress for my best friend wedding and it was exactly what expected. Good fabric, the color was the one i picked. Super happy with this choice.<br /><br />I had to sew a little on the chest area since it was to open for mu taste."
4.0,"The purple pair are true to size. As other reviews indicated, the tan pair was on the small side. The purple is a better made shoe."
4.0,Lightweight & comfortable. My one issue is I can see a reflection of the silver nose pad.
4.0,"i decided to use this for myself as i like the feel on this one and the fitting is perfect for me. i was thinking of getting this for my husband but it was not long ago when i got him 2 new boxes or boxers where he only used one box and the other one is not open yet so when i open this one, i like the fitting. it fits me more perfectly so ask him if i can have it and he said yes. i like the design and the color combination too. i like how it was neatly arrange on the box too."
4.0,"These are the comfiest...pants...ever! Personally, I use them for pajamas because I don't like wearing tight pants to bed, but the style is versatile and can be used for a quick daytime look as well! The colors in real life were even prettier than the pictures, and I am a stickler for color! Bottom line, these are a great value for the price, cute,  and should last me a very long time! :)"
4.0,When I wear these socks I don’t have excessive foot pain at the end of the day.
4.0,Beautiful and I recd a lot of compliments. Downside is it shrunk after one wash and I followed the wash instructions on label.
4.0,"I normally wear a slim fit medium and prefer a tighter look. This is just a tiny bit smaller than i prefer, especially the length of the sleeves. The material is pretty thin, but very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear. I will definitely continue to wear this shirt."
4.0,"My husband was pleased to find cotton socks are offered in his larger size. (He wears a size 14 shoe.) He likes the moisture-wicking and antibacterial properties. Attractively designed in a muted grey abstract print, they are soft to the touch.<br /><br />He has one negative comment concerning the fit. The socks are tight where they extend beyond the ankle onto the calf. They are not too tight for him to wear. Just be advised that if you wear a size 14 shoe or larger, even the extra-large may be a tight fit.<br /><br />The material is made of 76% cotton, 14% spandex, and 10% elastic. Care instructions state they are to be machine washed with like colors and tumbled dry."
4.0,"I like the glasses they do help with glare, the glasses are stylish and does not look like fit overs"
4.0,This is a very cute and pleasantly surprised with the quality!!! This is a steal! Love it
4.0,Fit my 11 year old son and he wears working outside on our farm
4.0,I like the style I will wait until he grows into them to comment of how it wears
4.0,The Rubber holds well they are very comfortable
4.0,"These swimming shorts are inexpensive, but they get the job done, no liners just the shorts."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a University at Buffalo alum, and the key chain itself was undamaged and great quality, but the little gift box it came in was smushed, making the presentation less than I wanted it to be for his stocking stuffer. Other than that, I am happy with this product."
4.0,My girl love it 😍
4.0,Cute. However material is thin
4.0,I love these I bought them for me and my friend that I haven’t seen in a year super high Quality and even comes with a protective film over the charms.One of the charm fell off eventually I am writing this after the first review I don’t know how to get a replacement charm for it I would not wear to do active things.
4.0,"Bought these for my boys and they seem to like them. They don't stay up very well though, I have to put the sides over their ears or the back nearly on top of their head to get them to stay covering their face, otherwise they just slide down."
4.0,"I use to alternate between carrying a 13"" MacBook pro for and 11"" iPad Pro with bluetooth keyboard. The pockets are nice and the overall quality is sturdy. That is except for the strap hook which easily pops off when under a little extra pressure. It's not a big deal and doesn't come off often but it's annoying when it does. Despite that it has a decent mount of varying pockets to keep a phone away from keys/pens, room for a smallish laptop or iPad. I take it on short work trips or to the basketball court to keep wallet/keys/phone safe in one place. Overall I'd recommend this in place of the fanny pack that my wife won't let me get because they're not cool."
4.0,"Need to size up but my son loved it! Had to return, he is 6'2.5 140 lbs.. skinny and the 32 was too tight. Size up!"
4.0,A high quality belt for a reasonable price.  Sadly I ordered a medium size and all three belts were labeled medium but they fit like a large size which I could not use so I gave them away.
4.0,"Got them a little scratched, other tgan that good sunglasses"
4.0,"The medium fits my petite daughter, who is 36B, so keep that in mind when you order (other reviews indicate same sizing issues). The pads are removable (which also means they tend to wander in the wash, but most brands do that). Don't plan to wear a tight t-shirt over it because the mesh is pretty prominent. Keeping all of these elements in mind, we recommend."
4.0,"Very nice and good quality, a little big"
4.0,"Listen up! I love the design, the fabric, the color! The only thing is that the waist is too high and I have to pull his pants up all the time. If you like saggy pants, these are for you. I love the elastic waist. Great pants overall!"
4.0,"Very slightly on the large side. I would still recommend ordering your normal size, just know that it's a loOKs like a flowy style shirt. Decent quality, especially for the proce"
4.0,I bit larger than expected (very long) but it is SO soft. Workmanship is good but zipper is plastic so crossing fingers it doesn't break.  Happy w/ the purchase
4.0,Very cute but a little flimsy...
4.0,I use it for work because it is so big. And I never have a hard time reading it.
4.0,"Scarf is large enough to do a lot of different styles. Can fold and do the loop, expensive feeling material and so soft. Got in brown and it goes with a lot of clothes. Was pleasantly surprised how warm it keeps my neck. Will use a lot this winter."
4.0,The earrings are pretty but heavy.
4.0,nice little outfit for a girl who adores mini mouse.
4.0,This is a very nice golf shirt.
4.0,"I was initially happy to receive item. It is made out of a nice leather, good color, and the pendant is large and well constructed. Only problem is a barely wear it! Also if not careful the arrow point can dig into your skin and leave you in some pain!"
4.0,"I followed the size chart, if you're tall tho, don't order this dress, the fit was great, too short tho...the slit in back was at the bottom of my bottom...the dress is beautiful tho and nice and soft.  I'm giving mine to a friend that's much shorter than I am."
4.0,It was a nice color and fit nicely....
4.0,I liked the bracelet except it seemed a little large for a woman.
4.0,"These goggles are bar none the best look for any outdoor use. I use these while mowing my grass on my rider. And ridding my ol yamaha. My only gripe is the foam seal around them. I pulled it off and glued it back on... No problems.. Crazy not to buy them.... Great for tactical entry as well, protects my eyes against spit, blood, and what ever reffuse criminals throw at my eyes..."
4.0,My son loved it but it seems small to me
4.0,I am a dog walker in my area so I thought this was a great costume to walk around all day. It goes with the job.All people laughed and smiled when they saw me in it. The costume was not too hot at all and the body fits fine for an adult. I am 165 and 5'6 woman so fit me perfectly. I highly recommend it.
4.0,Thought the elastic  would be tight  around the ankle but was not which makes it much nicer.
4.0,Fit nicely. Looks good. Got a lot of compliments. Just didn’t like the button arrangement. The buttons are 2 together then a gap. There is a gap right between the breasts. It’s not a nice look almost forcing having to wear a tank top underneath.
4.0,So far cool. Plenty of compartments inside for cards etc. & the money clip band is secure.
4.0,Cute design but not a very soft material.
4.0,"I love these but my daughters ears are very sensitive and i hope she doesnt have a bad reaction,. If she does i could probably return them. Anyhow its a great buy for cute little girls who like to pull their earings out."
4.0,"I'm short-waisted and the belt loops were still quite high for my waist. I think with a lot of these dresses, just plan on getting a wide wrap belt which can really improve the look and the perception of quality. Apart from that, it's okay. This is the type of material that's gonna pick up lint and dog hair in a magical kinda way, so no throwing it on the floor when you're done with it.<br /><br />Size was perfect; I'm 5'9"", 158 lbs and ordered my normal size medium. Fit is just as expected and it's short but not crazy short. I wouldn't recommend it if you're 5'11 or taller."
4.0,It's one size and that size is SMALL. Return was simple.
4.0,Comfortable to work out in.
4.0,I bought a medium but it fit me like a small or extra small. It’s a really cute dress though.
4.0,Fun colors and slim design.  It is made of cheap materials so it won't last long (after about a month it started to have breakage around the places it bends).  I only wanted it for a short period of time as I like to change my case often so this was great for the price and what I wanted.
4.0,Stays sticky. Not large enough for DD cup size. Lasts about 3 weeks with daily use.
4.0,"Not the absolute best quality but I only paid 99 cents so I wasn't expecting sterling silver haha<br /><br />They're cute and I've received compliments on these and a couple of others I ordered (I ordered two of each for my mom and I and ordered about seven or eight different Yazlilind earrings that looked like this, just all different things obviously so mice, cats, anchor, etc.). If you aren't searching for high quality, this is GREAT and I highly recommend the item. Especially for the low price! They're exactly as pictured, sturdy and cute.<br /><br />All I say to anyone on here ordering low priced jewelry is this; remember that this is very low in price so do not expect something of extremely high quality. Be gentle, don't constantly tug on it and don't throw it on your counter when you're done wearing it, and always apply a coat of clear nail polish to avoid that green coloration on your skin and so that the silver or gold &#34;shine&#34; doesn't go away. If you remember these things you will be highly satisfied and you will have your piece of jewelry for a very long time.<br /><br />Also, always remember to read the reviews BEFORE you order. Ignore anyone who makes it obvious that they skipped reading the reviews and who is angry and ranting but doesn't deserve to do so. Had they done their research they would have known they didn't want to order the item because it wasn't their taste and they wouldn't be posting things that aren't true - making it out to be worse than it is, making it out to be ugly just because they're mad, etc. And there's always going to be people who complain because that's what some people like to do. Only take into account the well thought out reviews and you'll know what to expect!"
4.0,"Too soon to tell yet but I have never had a problem with my main CC with the chip in it. I keep it in the quick access front slot but the last 2 times I have used it, I now get chip errors till about the 3-4 time I try it. Other than that I do love the size, fits great in my front pocket (makes it a lot harder to steal)."
4.0,I read other reviews about the size. I ordereda size larger. Perfect fit.
4.0,Synthetic material pulls into your mouth while talking. Forms to your mouth too much compared to cotton and other materials.
4.0,"Cute, but does run a bit small."
4.0,"This is a cute, high quality sweatshirt but unfortunately didn't fit.  I am normally a size 12 and ordered the XL and 2XL.  I could barely get the 2XL on.  These run a couple sizes sizes too small, more like &#34;juniors&#34; sizing.  My guess is that the 2XL would fit a size 8-10.  Customer service on the return was excellent."
4.0,"Cute shorts. Shorter than I had hoped for, so not work appropriate like I wanted. Still super cute!"
4.0,Generally a good glove but the last box I got was half large and half small gloves.  I won't buy again.
4.0,"The dress is nice - surprisingly high quality. The material is thick, but not too heavy, and everything is well made. I read in some of the reviews that it ran a bit small, so since I'm right in between a medium and a large on most days, I bought a medium. I should have gotten the large, because it's a little to small for me (although I can't fault the dressmaker for the decision I made based on reviews). So if you're going to buy this, buy based on your actual size.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this dress was that it was very high wasted, which you wouldn't know based on the pictures here on amazon. Imagine that the skirt starts 2 or 3 stripes higher than the images here suggest, and you'll have an idea how it actually looks. This isn't necessarily a deal breaker for everyone, but I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known"
4.0,I thought it was a rust color and not yellow
4.0,Very nice and attractive looking for sure but needs light at night to see the time.The date and day area is too small for viewing.
4.0,"Very cute and flattering dress but it's not for the height gifted individual, unless you're ok with not bending over at all."
4.0,This watch is everything I was expecting
4.0,Cute Spring/Summer top
4.0,"I really wanted to love these shoes.  And there is nothing necessarily wrong with them--they were just wrong for me.  I wear a size ten between a medium and wide normally.  I ordered the ten, but my feet just slid right through them, leaving my toes dangling.  They also have a lot of arch support.  So much so that it felt like I was walking on a large rock in the arch of my right foot.  Now some might like that much support, but I was in pain within seconds.  On the good side, they felt like I was walking on marshmallows--so smooth and comfortable!  But I just couldn't get used to such a high arch and my feet sliding forward.  I know some people LOVE these shoes, and I can see why if they fit your shape.  The color was great, and they are well made.  I truly wanted to love them.  But I had to return."
4.0,"Not easy to get the wrinkles out, need to dampen and air fluff it !!!"
4.0,"These earrings are so beautiful!! Excellent rich blue color and tons of sparkle. They are stamped with 14kt and the backings are secure and snug as well. The only thing I would have liked differently, is that the backings have silicone stoppers encased with a tiny bit of gold on the inside. I would have preferred just 14kt gold backings without the silicone."
4.0,"I like this two piece outfit, however the sizing is a little off in my opinion. I ordered a medium and I’m 5’7”, 145 lbs. the top is a little tight and I have small boobs while the bottom was actually a little loose.  Luckily it fit but I would recommend sizing up in the top."
4.0,Lightweight and good to run in because they vent easily. But the lenses pop out very easily and they definitely don't look as good as the fully enclosed Dadumas I also have.
4.0,"The dress was very pretty, but did not fit in the chest area for me.  I will be returning it.  I would buy again tho."
4.0,Item is not bad. I love the earrings the most. The necklace is a bit heavy but looks great on dark colored clothing. Definitely would buy again!
4.0,"Great look to this hat, great feel.  I'm a Costa groupie so take that for what it's worth."
4.0,Not the best quality but great for the price.
4.0,Size up ladies!!!! The part around my armpits was awkward.
4.0,The dress has darts for the hips but unless you have a long torso they won't line up. Otherwise the fabric is very soft and comfortable. I did size up from my typical size cause I don't like tight dresses but I might try it in my normal size next time. Definitely gonna get other color options in the future.
4.0,I find this style of sunglasses very stylish. The frames are the standard wayfarer sunglasses shape. The frame is made from plastic and denim. There is 5 layers of denim and plastic. They are quite thick. The lenses are black so you can not see yourself in them. They are also very light even with the several layers of denim. These did not pinch behind my ears like some others I have had before. These glasses are unisex which I like. They also come with a glasses wipe and a bag to store them in. I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
4.0,Very happy with item...was bought for a gift..recipient loved it too!
4.0,"You get a lot for your money here. I've always used silicone tunnels to stretch my ears, so these caught my eye. I didn't wear any plugs for a year or so and wanted to stretch back to 1/2"". This has done the trick.<br /><br />The 10mm set did have a sharp edge and cut my lobe, but I noticed it right away and was able to prevent infections. Good buy for the money though."
4.0,"I'm 6'4&#34; and after washing a xxl it may be a little short if your extending your hands over your head it raises up, but other then that very comfortable"
4.0,"I overall like it so far but am a little sad. I got a 2x and it fits a bit snug. Theres minimal elastic in the waist band and the slip underneath is a bit tight. If i was a bit fatter it wouldnt fit. Sizing is my only issue.  The material is great, i love the design and color. Length is great.  Not sure how it washes yet. Would buy again but a size bigger. Hoping to try and exchange it for a bigger size cause i really do love it."
4.0,This is a beautiful bracelet and my wife is very happy with it. One of the strands came apart but it was a quick fix.
4.0,"I really like the fit, the length is a LONG. I'm 5'6&#34;, weight 200lb, measurements 36-31-44 and I got the Large. I thought the Medium would be too tight on my arms. I will be buying another."
4.0,"I bought these in July for a cruise to Alaska where we would be walking through towns and over some rougher areas. I wanted something with style that would keep my feet comfortable and warmer than regular sneakers.Since I live in Colorado, I wanted to be able to use them as everyday shoes (not waterproof) in our Winters too. They are higher than regular sneakers and the tongue was stiff at first, but with adjustment, they are fine now. I usually wear a 6 1/2 Wide, but it wasn't available when I ordered, so I took a chance on the 7 Wide and they are good. I do have to lace them up to the last hook-like eyes to keep them from rubbing. I put my own insole in to provide better arch support."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, not the greatest material, but not bad for the price! I got it just because I wanted a new pretty dress, and a new one for the vacation I’m about to go on. I bought a large and it’s fits very well!"
4.0,"So cute! Definitely on the toddler side of size. If you open the strap all the way out, it will fit a 5 year old, but not much past that age."
4.0,Top is a little snug but will probably stretch out some. Bright fun patterns.
4.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 115 lbs. I got the S/M. From the knee down it's a little baggier than I would like. No camel toe but they emphasize my hoohaa a bit. Overall a good perchance especially for the price and they are super comfy.
4.0,"No way to adjust size , for a one size fits all hat."
4.0,"I thought the fabric was stiffer than it looks in the picture. Otherwise, fits like a dream!"
4.0,"I really love this sandal. I normally wear size 9, a 9.5 in this would have been perfect. But my only problem is that in some area the glue did not hold as well, so now I am wondering if it will fall apart on me."
4.0,Very cute and fashionable but a little tight.
4.0,Fit as expected & flattering. Nice cuff & collar. Good purchase
4.0,"Bought this as a gift. He wasn’t a fan of the string, said it was super short. Ended up buying a better chain separately. The actual metal part he really liked."
4.0,it was smaller than i was hoping and i wish it was bigger but overall it cute and instead of using it for school ill just use it for my crocheting stuff
4.0,"Great watch! Looked exactly like the picture and fit perfectly. I weatherproofed/conditioned the leather band because I’ve seen some people say that they stretch or crack, but I have no reason to believe that this watch and strap won’t age perfectly."
4.0,I would like these to have a bigger handle like the 1&#34; wide model but these will still work for my Churrasco
4.0,"I usually wear a medium to large top..or size 12 dress. This is a tad big, but looks very nice, like a tunic... I bought some orange shoes and wanted to orange to to wear with them. The to is more of a coral color than orange. It still looks nice with slim white pants. The shoes are far enough away, that the color difference barely shows.<br />I like that the sleeves are slightly narrow. They are perfect for me, but if you have large upper arms, they may be tight."
4.0,"It's really cute, but because of the fabric is a little too snug...BUT I'm keeping it! Next time I'll add 1 size up...I'll be ordering other colors."
4.0,"Great and affordable product. A good and thoughtful  gift for anyone who owns a car. shipping was more expensive than the product itself, but other than that no complaints!"
4.0,see
4.0,"Very cute, like the material.  They are soft and comfortable."
4.0,"Great gift, packaged nice as well"
4.0,Super cute. Love the dress
4.0,"Beautiful dress, the size is a bit small. But the dress is of good quality and beautiful"
4.0,Feels good. Will have to have it professionally ironed. Came way too wrinkled
4.0,"Fit much better after my granddaughter put it on the correct way!! She is 5’5” and weighs about 115lbs, fit great with a little room for growth."
4.0,Not expensive but good looking.  They keep your hands warm and still allow you to use your cell or other touchable device.
4.0,"Adorable, and well made dress. I bought this beautiful dress for my daughter.I ordered her normal size but this dress  runs small. I am returning it and hope the next size up will work, she really loves the style and color."
4.0,Snags on materials easily. Like the small stud size.
4.0,This is a nice bunny charm. I bought this for my mom who has a rabbit filled bracelet and she really likes it.
4.0,I love the sweater. The color was what I expected. I would have given it 5 stars except it has a very strong chemical odor that has been hard to get rid of. It was packed in a vacuum sealed bag. Maybe that is the reason for the smell.
4.0,I like the looks and the feel of these shoes.  They fit my foot with my normal size.  I haven't worn for hours yet so I may revise the review at that time.
4.0,"I purchased this for my sister and I who are both Cancers. While it looks nice and I know that she'll love it, when it came, it smelled as if it had been stored in a damp, musty basement prior to shipping. The little bag that it came in smelled that way too. I had to soak it several times to get that smell out. I meant to do a review sooner to when I bought them but I didn't get around to it."
4.0,"Glad to be able to get a replacement for the nose pad.  Quick delivery,"
4.0,Soft comfort and nice colors.....i ised it for exercises and it is so great
4.0,This is a nice choker neck piece made of leather. The design is nice and unique and specially great for people who love a bit of a punk style and wearing a little edgy jewellery.<br /><br />The straps are pretty comfortable to wear. I love wearing accessories but this was not some thing I tried before so I was happy to try it out. Overall good buy.<br /><br />Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.
4.0,This dress is so cute and feels nice on.  But be advised that the embroidery along the bottom will absolutely destroy a pair of pantyhose.  I still like the dress.
4.0,The color is a bit pink but overall it’s a decent top.
4.0,"Runs too small she won’t be able to wear it for long. But overall is super cute, thin and light weight."
4.0,Shipping was fast. Color was misleading. But I still love them
4.0,"Very cute, however the top is cotton and is not great for the pool. This swimsuit runs a little small so i ordered a size up and she has plenty of room and is very comfortable."
4.0,"does not have sylvoen but it sylvoen on the picture, wish they would have put eevee on the buckle and replaced the eevee's on the cloth with sylveon"
4.0,"The construction is a bit cheap (some of the tassels were coming untied, but I was able to put them back together myself),  but it's a cool and unusual necklace that hangs at just the right height. It got lots of compliments!"
4.0,"Good quality, but runs a little bit small."
4.0,This scarf is very cute. It is thin but not so thin it appears cheap. Very comfortable and washes easy without bleeding colors. It is soft and goes with almost any outfit. I received at a discount in return for an honest review.
4.0,"The ring is beautiful! Runs a little big.  I am a size 7 on my ring finger and it was a little too loose, I ended up losing it.  I will buy it again soon."
4.0,"Soft and comfy, seems to be well constructed so I have no concerns about laundering. It's barely long enough in the front (and I'm only 5' 3&#34;) so if it had an extra inch or so in length, I would have given it a perfect rating."
4.0,"The dress is HUGE on me, but it still works for what I was using it for so it isn’t a complete flop. It’s comfortable so I can use it as a lounge around the house dress afterwords. Using it for Cosplay so oversized isn’t a big deal, and it still looks cute!"
4.0,"Can't change the size, so a bit larger for those who have slim wrists. Not a dedicated bracelet but chic chic."
4.0,1 out of 3 was not cut the same way as the others and fit small.
4.0,"After i figured out that I needed to cinch the legs to keep the air in, it was awesome!! Deffo loved it and will use it again!!<br />Perhaps not have to unscrew it to put the batteries in. Luckily I had a friend with a swiss army knife."
4.0,Nice cheeky swimsuit. Material not as thick as you would like but it's great
4.0,Can wear it to work and then to happy hour
4.0,Really cutejust like pic
4.0,"Bought this shirt for my husband, for his birthday. It's fun!"
4.0,I bought them as a gift for a friend.  I dont know how well they worked.  But the price was right. Shipping was fast.  No fuss / no muss shopping
4.0,"I found that this bar is made from the same steel that the original piercing bar is made from, so there's no allergic reaction or swelling.  I can only wear barbells with coatings on them for a short period before I start having reactions.  I’ve had this bar in for a week, and my ear feels great."
4.0,thinner than I expected but it will do.
4.0,"Cute, stylish and light! Just perfect for a casual look."
4.0,"The necklace looks exactly as pictured and seems to be pretty sturdy. I've had it for a few weeks and worn it in water and it doesn't seem tp tarnish or turn my neck green. The only bad thing about this product is the clasp. The clasp is an o ring and is very hard to use. It becomes hard to open the clasp and attach the necklace. Aside from the clasp, it is a great product."
4.0,Goes great with my tactical training bump helmet
4.0,Colors are a bit off but nice bow ties
4.0,Very comfortable and practical...
4.0,"great casual looking watch! not real leather though, watch comes in a plastic baggy with a microfiber cloth."
4.0,"Loved the color of this garment. It fits a little snug, but that's OK. Really enjoy the compliments I get whenever I wear it. It's nice and soft, and keeps you warm on those cool days."
4.0,Size runs a bit large. A bit hard to breath through with the filter inserted. Good quality and great picture. Quite happy with it.
4.0,My daughter loved her vampirina shirt and was very excited to wear it.
4.0,"I loved this corset, I just had to return it because it was too long in front, I was unable to sit in it, but I did get another shorter version and I love it so much!"
4.0,Great masks for kids. My 5 year old son loves them. They even fit me so I took the “girly ones”. I decided to order another pack of the masks but this time the colors were not same. They were a little lighter in color and my son will not use most of them.
4.0,"I got these to wear as headscarves but they're way too big - unless you have a ton of hair these aren't for you. Really pretty and feel nice, however."
4.0,"I bought some cheap belts 6 months ago and they started cracking almost immediately. So this time I wanted solid leather that would last a long time. I bought this one and two similar ones. I love them. The belt is solid leather, no stitching or laminated pieces. I haven't had them long but I am sure they will last a long time. This is the first time I have bought the ratchet type buckle though. I love it. I can adjust to any size. I am a large man, by large I mean around the middle, but I am losing weight every month. The great thing about this belt is that you can detach it from the buckle and cut some length off when it get's too big for my shrinking waistline, and then reattach the buckle. The only low mark I give this belt is that the buckle has already scratched, possibly a poor painting or coating process. I'll try covering it up with a black Sharpie. Overall I recommend this product and any similar versions."
4.0,This Jacket is awesome real leather suprisingly real patch real metal real everything it's literally like a biker jacket
4.0,"The socks are tight, compressed but does not have targeted compression. Other socks and calf sleeves have a more targeted design I prefer. I will use these socks for less strenuous runs and work outs."
4.0,I use it to work
4.0,PERFECT STYLE AND FIT!!! HE LOVES BRINGING BACK HIS ROOTS!
4.0,Bought for my daughter and niece and they LOVE them
4.0,"Perfect for what I needed. First one I’ve owned with straps. Was finding others would fall down.straps hold it up while blow drying my hair, etc. I’ve had ones that you pull on which I like better then Velcro but I can’t find them"
4.0,"We bought this product for my sister in-law and her new baby. It was all we could of asked for soft, well made and adorable. The shipping was a little longer than we expected but that was all fault for not reading. It was a great product and would recommend it."
4.0,"Pretty dress, but it runs a tad large and the elastic material in it is a little uncomfortable at first. I will probably just wear it as a bathing suit cover up to avoid long periods of time in it. But it is a really pretty dress and if your skin isn't sensitive to the elastic, it would be perfect with wedges and a beach hat!"
4.0,Really cute.  The turquoise could have had a little more veining.
4.0,"Thin material, more than i thought it would be. But it’s a great size and love the crossbody strap - now i can carry all our stuff and the kids into the gym!"
4.0,Bought as a birthday gift for my 11-year old nephew. He loves it and attached it to his bag for school.
4.0,The item was purchased for my daughter’s Halloween costume. It looks great as a part of her Katniss outfit. My daughter is very petite 4’6” and about 60lbs. The large fit well with the arms length a little too long.
4.0,"Someone else wrote that the belt is stretchy and I found that to be true but not necessarily a bad thing.  In my opinion the belt has a really nice soft quality feel to it.  Now if continues to stretch I suppose that would be a bad thing and I won't know that for a while.  So far though I am very happy with  it.  If it's too long you can trim it and if there's not enough holes you can add more with the supplied punch.  Only time will tell if I purchase more of these but, so far so good."
4.0,Very cute purse !!!!
4.0,"I bought the white and blue dress.  I like the color and fit, but the fabric is somewhat translucent (even though I am fair skinned)  making it unsuitable to wear in public"
4.0,"I use this for a tiny Dell Mini 9 computer. It holds the computer in the large zippered pocket and the power adapter and USB cable in the smaller front zippered pocket. It's ""rustic"" enough that it doesn't say ""take me"" like most branded computer cases do."
4.0,Good but it was not ruffled in the front only the back I wish it was ruffled in both
4.0,"Good quality, good fit, great look"
4.0,I use it to hold my key fab and it works great.  I wish it was a little smaller though.
4.0,"These classic aviator sunglasses provide a classic look at a reasonable price, and I wear them constantly.  While I try to keep them in pristine condition by always keeping them in a sturdy case, I occasionally toss them into my purse in a hurry while driving away from a gas pump or some other similar errand, and they have held up well to a little rough handling.  I would recommend these sunglasses for both eye protection and a stylish look."
4.0,Christmas gift and he loved them!
4.0,Perfect for my job and great durability
4.0,I’m a muscular 34c implant<br />My right breast has an extra pocket which causes my breast to shift when working upper body .<br />I had surgery last Nov to fix it .<br />It still has a slight shift.<br />The Small<br />It’s Tight but will hold my right boob from moving around during a workout .<br />I got the beige 2. With the x in the back .<br />Breathable material .
4.0,"These Christmas masks are very cute and pretty comfortable. They arrived in only a few days and in time to wear for Christmas eve. ""Merry Christmas"" is misspelled on one, which just gave us a good laugh. It was nice to have festive Christmas masks since we had to wear them anyway for short visits with close family."
4.0,I bought these because all of my grandchildren love to swim. They are under the water as much as they are on tap lol. These worked great for their ages for ages (4 through 9).
4.0,"very strong item, but is their a way to make it smaller ---falls off wrist"
4.0,"The gloves are very comfortable and warm. The touch screen feature doesn't seem to work, however."
4.0,It has shrunk a bit after washing a few times but I do probably wear it once a week. I'd love for the pink to come back in stock. I did sew up the sides a few inches as they are a bit revealing for work. Easy fix and so worth it.
4.0,This is a nice bag with lots of pockets both inside and out. It is a cute print and very durable water resistant fabric. The strap is adjustable and very comfortable.
4.0,"I love love love the passport stamp design for this and love the idea behind it. I love pretty much everything about it except that sometimes the clasp doesn't close properly. It's only an occasional thing though and then it goes back to closing properly again, usually if I adjust where I have placed my cards. I do have a lot of cards in there which is probably why this happens, but I do wish the clasp was a little stronger."
4.0,Tips were fine. Pants fit funny.
4.0,"I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I really like this product.  I have it attached to my messanger bag, and hang my car keys from it when I dont want to carry them in my pocket.  Velcro seems to be pretty heavy duty, and has a nice sturdy hold.  Only real complaint, and the reason I did not give it a 5 star, the clasp does not open very far.  So if you are looking to hang multiple things from it, or something that is a little thicker, I dont think it will work.  Even when completely open, it is very narrow."
4.0,The 2x fit a little snug on me but nothing terrible. I’m 6’4 280Lbs so maybe a 3x would give me a little more room to work with.
4.0,I had a bad experience with the first set of bands that I received but after speaking with the seller he made it right by sending new bands and I love them
4.0,"Made well and looks very pretty, but it is hard to remove the links. The pins provided bent very easily making it hard to push the pins back in. Also needs at least one link that is half size. Fits fairly snug but add a link and its to loose."
4.0,"Cute and comfy but runs small. I’m in between 9.5-10, I ordered a 10 and they are a bit snug"
4.0,"LOVE the ring, I bought it in two colors/styles! I just wish it came in half sizes. 5 is just a little too big but I think 4 would be too small."
4.0,Cute and comfortable. A little smaller and shorter than I wanted but otherwise a good fit.
4.0,"Super cute, compact and perfect for my needs. I do wish there were more slots for credit cards but other than that, the is the one to buy."
4.0,VERY cute and good quality! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because they were a little too short for me. Probably just a body shape thing because they fit my sister perfect so I gave them to her.
4.0,"It's so beautiful! Very lovely details. The watch has to be wound manually, and the luminescent background lends an interesting detail to it (has t be exposed to sunlight for a while to glow).  It's perfect for what we need it for (costume jewelry, basically); from a user interface perspective, the hands of the clock are not super easy to read."
4.0,"So comfortable, great to wear around the house on a cold snowy day!"
4.0,"Although these fit me well and look cute, I have to question the 165-250 pound size rating. I fall roughly in the middle of that range (and I'm 5'5 if that helps) and these fit me perfectly. I could not, however, see these fitting a 250 pound woman. Her legs would look like over stuffed sausages about to burst out of the casing.<br /><br />These are also not the &#34;Costume Adventure&#34; brand advertised. I received the brand &#34;BeWicked&#34;.<br /><br />4 stars for not sending the brand stated and having a suspicious weight rating."
4.0,"These work well to keep out the Tucson sun - only thing is that they are very stiff plastic, but that might be a plus to some. Pretty durable things, too, since I've managed to sit on them a few time with no breakage. Also very stylish if I might add. ;)"
4.0,This product is pretty awesome for the price. Good deal. The build quality is good for the price. Driving with these on don't hurt you at all. Protects your eyes from glare from the sun which surprised me since other cheap shades don't really do anything. You won't regret buying this product for the price.<br /><br />Only thing I don't like about this item are the arms. They seem too loose for my taste but that's just my two cents.
4.0,"Very pretty sterling silver Hello Kitty pendant. Nice gift box presentation. It was a little smaller than I expected, and the he box chain was tangled when it arrived, but overall it's a nice gift."
4.0,"I like how they hug you, makes u seem a little slimmer but they make you sweat more"
4.0,It said to get a bigger size but the x large was perfect for me this is not a thick hoodie so not good for real cold weather
4.0,"When I realized that I've never owned a pair of boots in my adult life, I figured I should get a pair for this winter ASAP.<br /><br />As many reviews has said, these boots seems to fit 1/2-inch ~ 1-inch too big.  I usually wear 9 1/2 ~ 10, so when I accidentally came across a ""9"" in amazon's outlet, I jumped on it.  Fit is pretty good, but it still feels about 1/4"" too big.<br /><br />Now, I am a total noob when it comes to boots, but these Earthkeepers don't feel durable or tough at all.  As one reviewer noted, it is soft/flexible right out of the box.  It doesn't feel any tougher than most shoes I wear, and I don't know if I'm protected any better in these boots, other than from water, or weather.<br /><br />I really like the look of these boots, and I must admit, what really sold them to me were that water bottle chasing TV commercial and the bargain price I got from the outlet.  Had I paid the full retail, I think I'd rate this a star lower.  Take it with a grain of salt, I don't know anything about boots.  ;)"
4.0,Id order a size up from your child's current size
4.0,Love this style. Just what I was looking for. The pearls are to big. They look smaller on the model. I wanted a small pearl. These are pretty and I like pavoi jewelry.
4.0,Very long chain
4.0,"I like it. It is not totally subtle, but it is subtle enough that it does not look as if I am wearing too much &#34;bling.&#34; It is sturdily made: the leather weave is tight; the pieces of leather thick; the steel accents are securely attached and rather lovely against the black. I am not remotely ambidextrous and always have trouble with anything I have to do only with my left hand other than catch a baseball, but given the fact that attaching the clasp, a sturdy metal slide that is thick and seems solidly soldered, took me three or four tries (because of my clumsiness, not any flaw in the bracelet), I think it nearly impossible to believe it would come loose or fall off easily. I was a little concerned that the braided leather might look dated or silly (think an early - '90s braided leather belt with jeans today), I was pleased that it is a really good - looking piece, not a punk classic like the black leather wrist band, but a better choice for those of us not heading out for a Billy Idol show in the early '80s.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it a full five - star rating has to do with sizing. I do not have large wrists at all, but even the eight and a half inch is a bit too tight on my wrist. I like it enough, though, that I plan to exchange it for the 9.1 - inch version and look forward to wearing it.  Since the 9.1 - inch model is, however, the largest available, I mention it only for your consideration if you plan to wear it on a larger wrist.<br /><br />** Some people worry about how honest and unbiased the reviews that include the free or reduced - price disclaimer are, but I hope you will recognize that is not the case with me. I received this item at a reduced price or free in exchange for an *honest* review, which I think you will see I have done here. I praise what is praise-able, and I criticize problems. I take reviews quite seriously because they have so often helped me make a decision on a purchase, so I try to help other buyers, not just the seller, because, other than the seller's own description, the buyer may have little else on which to base a decision. As they say on Law and Order, &#34;These are their stories.&#34;"
4.0,"I bought two of these... one for my two year old and one for my six year old. The hat for my two year old was much too big. The hat for my six year old seemed to fit much better. The &#34;mustache strap&#34; kept unbuttoning from the hat, which was frustrating at times, but I do like the concept of this hat."
4.0,I bought the yellow version and I really like this shirt. It's very cute and can be worn virtually anywhere.
4.0,Gift for my mother in law and she really liked it at her age of 71.  It fits her life style and jewelry choices
4.0,Nice bracelet- smooth creamy light green color with a good weight<br />Why is there a required number of words for reviews?
4.0,Love the oversized style of the sweater great for fall season and comes in cute colors
4.0,"I love this belt, though the back is no longer braided but just an elastic band."
4.0,"Overall this is a super cute top. My one pet peeve is the quality isn't the greatest. There is no indication which side is front and back, which is strange."
4.0,I think these were ok. I am not a super big fan of flats because most of them squish my feet and press on my toes and have barely any arch support (duh that is what a flat is supposed to be but still). I would say they are a good thing to bring to a wedding to slip on when your feet get sore form those heels. I wear a size 7 and have normal width feet. I think they are a good option and do not feel too cheap.
4.0,"Overall, the quality of the outfit is pretty good, and my daughter got a lot of compliments on Halloween."
4.0,Buy next size up
4.0,"not as snug as other compression shirts, probably just difference in brand."
4.0,Size and shape are ok. The thing that disappointed me is that the shade is darker than what is pictured.
4.0,"The ring is awesome. I really like it. I’ve  received several compliments on it. The only negative is that on the packaging, the name was listed as mine or current resident. Meaning if for some reason I wasn’t here anyone got to keep it? It was odd and I would recommend they update their system to remove that from the printing label."
4.0,I ordered a medium as according to the size chart would fit a 34B was too small.<br />Order at least a size up.<br />Received the Large and it is still very tight.
4.0,"I have worn this a few times and everyone has complimented me on it.  Size is right, color as shown and washes well."
4.0,"The purse is high quality, with beads that don't look like they will fall off anytime soon. It is a little smaller than  I thought it would be, but it will still work for the way I am using it as a costume."
4.0,"This fits a little tighter & is less stretchy than other sweatshirts I ordered that were one fabric all the way through.  The floral pattern is pretty & looks just like the picture.  The lower half is more fitted and has little give.  I personally like a looser fit, but, still like the shirt.  I would say order your regular size for a more fitted look & order up if you like a looser fit."
4.0,"I tried it on & didn’t like the way it fit on my body. I’m usually a size medium but I bought a large, the pants were still a little tight. I’m 5’6 175lb"
4.0,Very cute sizing a Lil off top comes small shorts a lil big.
4.0,they feel great on my feet. Great foot bed cushion and support  Only problem is that they fit slightly loose - so I am afraid they might easily come off my feet with time.
4.0,The Tankini fits as expected. The cups are a little bit too hard and having a &#34;funny&#34; shape (therefore only 4 stars). But I really love the color.
4.0,"Really good dress, the top part is a little large. I bought a 2x and I normally wear about a 2x. I love the length, it just about covers my knees. The pockets are a great size. Only reason I’m taking off a star is because they keep bumping up the price, I bought mine at $16.99 and it’s not worth much more than 20 as the material is a little flimsy and it’s just a regular dress, only thing special about it is the pockets."
4.0,"It is very pretty, but very small. But I will keep it<br />It's very  petite. Wish it would have been bigger."
4.0,"When I initially opened the item and tried it on, it felt nice and snug. The fabric is sturdy and the steel coils are perfect for keeping my waist tight in place. However, I noticed the back coil on my right side unraveled a part of the stitch. And it hasn't been a month with the product. Other than that, the color is flattering."
4.0,"Hubby gets compliments, as this mask matches up with his own beard fairly well.  My one complaint is the nose...it’s weirdly darker than the cheeks and has HUGE nostrils."
4.0,Found the sizing chart to be inaccurate.
4.0,"The top is very nice and soft. It looks just as pictured for the most part. I do wish it was longer as on the model, it looks to be longer as it’s gaped at her waist. Unfortunately it’s not on me and when I reach up or so, the shirt pulls up exposing areas is not like exposed which is why I deducted a star. On less hectic days where I’m not doing much reaching or lifting then it’s fine."
4.0,Surprisingly great length as I'm 5'9&#34; and pregnant but runs large. Even in my condition. I ordered a medium for maternity photos and had to keep pulling up loose neckline. But colors as pictures. Still love it. Just don't know if I'll get more than the one short wear out of it :/
4.0,"Nice length, fit's nicely, the texture is a bit hard. otherwise highly recommended."
4.0,"My wife found it a bit small going on, but liked the feel and fit overall. I ordered her a full size up."
4.0,"I looked and looked for boots-every time I found a pair that I liked, they were sold out in my size, or far more expensive than these.<br />These arrived only four days after I placed my order. I wish they had half sizes because I would have ordered a 6 1/2. I ordered a size 7 because they often fit. They fit as expected- a tiny bit big but good with heavier socks. They appear to be well made, insulated and warm. They look as cute as winter snow boots can be! They are a TINY bit heavy, but less heavy than I would expect snow boots to be so this is a nice medium. There seems to be great traction in the snow and ice so far! I love these! Great buy! I would recommend."
4.0,"Perfect material for California heat :),even my very picky husband liked it!<br />Sadly was too small and I had to re order..."
4.0,"Cuts of house Stark and Targaryen, which are two of the biggest houses on the show. Looks nice tho."
4.0,"I love the purse, however, being just 1 inches wide it doesn't hold very much.  With all of the inside pockets it's a shame that they go to waste as you can't put anything in them.  If it were to come in a 2 1/2 inches wide, I would order it again."
4.0,This a adorable but very small. I bought it for my 5 year old it holds her tap shoes and ballet shoes and a water. That's about it. She LOVES it. But if you are looking to hold more than tiny kids shoes find something bigger.
4.0,"Sizes are a little big, however they're soft and comfortable. I'd def recommend buying a size smaller"
4.0,"But holy soft material. I have a problem with buying things simply by feeling how soft they are. This shirt was no exception, though I bought it for the look only to discover its softness. I was hoping for a looser fit for this style. I would order again, but would need to order up so it fits right."
4.0,Just as pictured. Wish I would have been able to wear them though....someone broke into my car and took them....Guess they were blazer fans too
4.0,Really cute. A little wrinkly
4.0,"Nice sweater.  Sturdy weave.  The color is more of a wine than the picture and it is a little washed out looking, but I know I will get good use out of this sweater."
4.0,Wife l loves it. Says it's very soft.
4.0,"This necklace has a gold chain and gold tassels. The pendant piece is a mixture of blue and green &#34;rock&#34; looking parts and creates a teal color appearance. The necklace has a nice length, but I thought the pendant piece was on the small side."
4.0,"I bought the wrong size for my husband, so He's not wearing them, gave them to a relative,  He likes them. Looks nice for the price."
4.0,"This is a gorgeous skirt and beautifully made. Unfortunately its a tad bit too long for me (I'm 5'5&#34;) and as much as I wanted to keep it, even after I pulled it up to mimic a high-waisted skirt, it would still require alterations so that it didn't drag the floor. Nonetheless, anyone slightly taller or my height wearing at least a 4 inch heel would definitely benefit from it as it is a lovely skirt."
4.0,So adorable. Love the bright colors.
4.0,"Cute for shoelaces. Nice length, I bought them for a Christmas gift. I received these at discount for my review."
4.0,"Color online looked like a deep rich red, I got it and it is almost orange. The navy was the same way. It was not navy blue."
4.0,i love this ring it’s good for if you have anxiety or adhd gives you something to do with your hands of you have trouble staying still
4.0,Rad looking bandana!
4.0,"Nice socks, decent quality, price is excellent, but size is small, not for people with size 10 and above."
4.0,the fabric isn't my favorite but the shirt itself looks great. I liked it overall
4.0,"My son wears a size 5 from most store, so I got him a 6 and they fit perfectly. They run small. My son love and love them. Not heavy at all. Perfect."
4.0,"I like this dress.  It's exactly what I want to wear aond my apartment in hot weather. The coloris bright, the style is great, the material is nice and soft. The only thing, one of the pockets isn't sewn all the way.  What can you expect, I guess."
4.0,Worked great but doesn't work 8 months later.
4.0,Such a cute item. I do newborn pictures and this has been a huge hit with new mommies!
4.0,"did the job, arrived on time"
4.0,It’s a stamp and not embroidered
4.0,Better than the other imitations
4.0,I love the loose fit of this dress. The pockets are s great bonus. Very comfy
4.0,"Dont know if it is really blocking anything, but it works well enough as a wallet."
4.0,"Only worn a few times, but for now they seem real good. Like the comfortability factor and tho they may seem a little thick, they actually are more comfort with seemingly good breathability. True test is how it all holds up in a year or so from now."
4.0,"Cute for the price - Worked well for our Christmas Pageant at church,"
4.0,"Fit as expected. Nice material. Slight imperfection in cut of fabric, stripes are not straight with top solid fabric."
4.0,"Excellent for keeping my two year old’s feet warm and dry as he plays in snow. He could walk in them too, not too bulky!"
4.0,Great accessory. Good value. Looked beautiful.
4.0,"Showed all my rolls :) I did wear my waist trainer, but it was somewhat visible."
4.0,"I bought this flannel robe for my 88 year old Aunt who stays cold year round.  She loves this robe!  The color, pattern and style is super cute.  She loves that it comes up to her neck, the length of the sleeves and that it has two pockets.  She's petite so the small is a little large on her.  She would have been thrilled if it came in an extra small."
4.0,"I dig it. I like to think I have an average sized head. It fits without a problem.<br /><br /> The quality seems to be okay? I haven't noticed any fraying, or any other problems and I wear the hat just about daily to work. It feels a little on the cheaper side. But so far it has stood up well to the automotive shop."
4.0,"soft, comfy pj pants"
4.0,"The coat arrived vacuumed packed looking wrinkled.  See photos.<br /><br />I'm 5'3 and weigh about 145-150.  I carry my weight in my bust - about a size 40F.  The coat was a tad snug for me.  It has a big cut so it may run big for some.  For me, I knew it was dicey whether it would fit.<br /><br />Probably need a medium.  Or lose 10 pounds which is on the agenda.<br /><br />I think it helps to be slim to wear this coat - or get it in a black or navy.  The fluff adds pounds to your appearance.<br /><br />It is soft.  I'd like a mix of polyester and cotton.  It is 100% polyester.<br /><br />I thought it would be a fun coat to wear with jeans, leggings etc. when it's cool but not cold.  Perfect for temps 40-60 degrees perhaps?  Of course, if you have a sweater and shirt on underneath, you might be able to wear it in colder temps around 30 degrees.<br /><br />It's light but warm. It's a funky coat, but has a certain boho appeal."
4.0,Like it for costume jewelry.
4.0,I did exchange it for a larger size. I usually wear a 32DDD. I purchased a 36DD and it fits great! Very comfortable. My only wish is that the clasps were metal instead of plastic. I fear they will get brittle in the chlorine
4.0,Such a beautiful pin!! Fast delivery with pretty packaging.
4.0,I like the watch.
4.0,"I like this wallet, but its a little big for me now. I thought it was what I wanted but its not. Not room for any change either."
4.0,Product was nice. I just ordered a size too small for what I wanted. My error.
4.0,A cute watch for my daughter who loves purple!
4.0,"I like the material and the compression on my legs, but the waistband cuts in a bit. For reference I got a 3XL and the shorts I'm currently wearing them with are an XL, so I don't know if you're supposed to bump up 3 sizes, but I did reference the size chart before ordering."
4.0,"It's a nice vest,  but the small was a bit too large for me, with a 35&#34; chest"
4.0,My daughter loves this dress. Fits her perfectly.
4.0,item was returned do to size
4.0,"It's nice, but is smaller than shown on the site."
4.0,Order this dress to your size. Don't size up. It does stretch.
4.0,Really nice design & decent quality for the price.<br />My only complaint is it is short- I have a long torso so finding a one piece that doesn't ride up or dig into me is hard. Other than that beautiful suit.
4.0,"Love the dress. Would give it 5 stars, except for 2 things. One, being the color red is a bit brighter than I had expected. It looked like a rich red in the photos but in real life it has a bit of a neon pink/red hue. And two, may be my own fault if I missed it in the description buty It is advertised  as a wrap dress but it is not. I was expecting  it to have a slit open a bit to show some leg but it doesn't, it's just a regular full length skirt bottom. But those two things aside it is a very comfy and flattering dress on!"
4.0,why i bought this one because It's cheap. And the size is really big so i can wear it on my glass
4.0,It is a heavier material than others but comfortable to wear.
4.0,"The part the Velcro’s was not attached to the shoe?! Weird. Would have sent them back if I hadn’t missed the window. Still trying to figure out how to fix to make them wearable before they are too small for her. Disappointing because they are so cute, but much darker than the photo."
4.0,i should have ordered a larger size because i like bigger pj's to lounge around in and the top was cut more for a smaller busted woman
4.0,Basic knit gloves with Thinsulate lining to keep you warm. Comfortable and fit well.
4.0,Very good and versatile
4.0,"Glasses are light weight, fit very nice. Love them while playing golf!!!"
4.0,"It's not a baggy jersey -- more of a Tee shirt fit. I got large and it was more of a medium size tee shirt. Overall, it looked good."
4.0,"Simple, clean lines, definitely an evening, party wear, conversation piece. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars due to fit.I have a pretty long, slim neck, but when I have it on I can't bend my head downwards without the piece being in the way. Im still keeping it though, can't wait to wait it out on date night!"
4.0,good quality and shape
4.0,"This is super cute and works great, but the hole for the fan wasn’t quite big enough for the fan to fit through. We had to tape it inside. Overall, it worked after that."
4.0,"It's a little bigger than expected, but it looks beautiful. I've had it for over a month and it has held up."
4.0,"Worked great, decent price and the comfort was good."
4.0,The tote is very nice it is much bigger than I expected but it works for something else than what I first ordered it for. The only problem is the metal supports that keep the sides up are hard to secure with the provided Velcro retainers.
4.0,"Cute hat, the kid size fits a bit big. But fine for halloween night. Fast shipping"
4.0,did not buy for myslef but i asked how it fit he said it fits great
4.0,"I'm only 5'1"" and these are way too long. So, since they're distressed, I cut the bottoms to the length I needed and they're better now."
4.0,Another great top. Nice fabric and looks just like the picture. Order your normal size
4.0,"pros include: cute styling, good for commuting, comfortable, just the right amount of lacing for quick errands or for being in the snow<br /><br />Cons include: lacks support (feels like slippers and not boots), lining sheds,and the gray top is not quite the same color as pictured (more of a steel gray).<br /><br />Still very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:9c7d0c659fe0f25f08768c0c663a321b]] Really good quality. Better than I expected for the price.<br />I ordered small & I'm a size SMALL and it fit me really well (on the looser side though)<br />It came a day earlier than time frame alloted and it was packaged well.<br />No stains. PURE white and has the assymetrical bottom like in the picture.<br />NEEDS to be ironed to give appearance of the girl in the picture.<br />LOVE the pockets as well. This was a good buy!
4.0,"It takes forever to get these bifocal reader glasses from China. Ordered in November just got them in January. But for the cheap price and also they seem to be made well. If your willing to wait, I think they are worth the wait."
4.0,Keeps me dry without being bulky and lightweight enough to wear in warm weather
4.0,The dress runs small so order up. It's a very flowing dress. The colors are as shown.
4.0,Pretty pajamas and a lovely soft material. However the fabric is quite thin (you can see through it if holding it up to the light). I am not sure it will last long. Cat claws have already snagged it in some places.
4.0,I love this head wrap/scarf! I got a lot of compliments. Will be ordering agin in other colors.
4.0,"Was shocked they came down to my knees, considering I'm 6ft6"
4.0,"Most shoes are too big or too small or hurt my feet. I am typically 7.5-8 wide. I bought a 7 and surprisingly, they fit perfectly!  Wish they had black in my size, I would buy more."
4.0,I liked the easy adjustment that the magnetic band allowed.  The band started to show its wear after  many about one year of use but was still acceptable.  I used it while swimming and never saw any ill effects from it.<br />The real warning is in regards to using it in the water.  Be very careful when diving.  I jumped off a boat in the middle of a very deep lake and the band came off and the watch is now sitting at the bottom of a 100 foot deep lake.  Not sure how long the band will last in the water but perhaps some future diver may discover it in the years to come and leave an updated review.
4.0,Striped socks. Fit like socks.
4.0,"The sweater is nice. However, its definitely an Ivory color & not white. So the product description is off.<br /><br />Also it's kind of short. Stops at my natural waist & most tops these days go down to my hips. This would be nice for a classic look or someone more petite than I am."
4.0,A nice necklace for the price.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Being able to get them in two days with my Prime membership was a added bonus.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and surprisingly great quality. It’s not overly revealing. I’m normally a size 16 and am 5’4”. I ordered the XXL because I assumed it would run small. It was too big so it made the dress too long. I ended up returning it, but I may reorder in a smaller size."
4.0,"Really great pair of glasses, well worth the money. Quality is good, and the frame is strong and will generally maintain its form."
4.0,"The band is thicker than the original,  at times can be uncomfortable."
4.0,"It is an adorable bracelet.  I had one I liked a lot so purchased this for a family member as a gift.  In the meantime, however, the stone on my bracelet is no longer there - lost somewhere in the 3 times I've worn it, so perhaps the charms at not attached as solidly as needed for repeated wear."
4.0,"The material is really soft and in general it feels very breezy and nice. I've never tried this style before, and I don't know that I love it on me but it's nice. It's mildly sheer but not obviously in all lights. Overall I like it and feel like I ordered a quality product."
4.0,"When I purchased this dress I thought the material was a little thicker, it is very clingy and very thin.<br /> It still looks good (except the wrinkles)but if you’re wearing something for the winter it would be nice if it had some thicker warmth"
4.0,Very big... But comfy and very soft.
4.0,I wear this under my scrubs and it is comfortable and light! I would buy more.
4.0,I didnt realize they were as sheer as they are but they fit perfectly and I will still get a lot of use out of them.
4.0,Bigger than I realized when purchasing. Fit really well and are enough for the Florida sun!
4.0,"It's a little tool long for my 5'2 body, but I will still wear it, most likely with heels."
4.0,I got this tee to wear to a Country Western concert and am happy that I did. It does run a bit small so it was pretty fitted!! I added some shape wear and a light jacket to make it cute!
4.0,"I like the design on this watch band, but it does show some wear a little faster than desired."
4.0,Little big and stuff but overall good quality
4.0,Completely foldable
4.0,"This is a hoodie without a front pocket. It’s not a bad thing, but be aware of it. Fit well"
4.0,They are warm and comfy
4.0,Also works well as filter over nose and mouth when in dust filled environment.
4.0,These are really beautiful however they do have some very simple manufacturing opportunities. The studs aren’t even on both earrings which you can see if you look at the earring back peaking at the top of the left earring and then the right earring can see the metal piece through the plastic.<br /><br />They are really cute.
4.0,They are cute but look a little cheap.They are light weight and comfortable.
4.0,Such soft beautiful work. They run a bit large though!
4.0,"I have several pairs of these pants, although fewer than I used to, because they are warm and dressy enough to wear our.  My complaint is that there is too much elastic in the waist.  My hands are weak and I have trouble getting them on.  When I receive a pair I have to open the waist band and remove most of the elastic (a tedious task- there are 3 rows of stitching).  Do most people need that  much elastic?"
4.0,My cousin loved the beanie!
4.0,They feel good.  I haven't used them for their intended purpose yet.  I get my Gaynor Mindens in a month or so.  I thought they'd help my high heeled pumps not hurt so much in the toe area.  It turns out that I'd have to have a size 10 shoe to fit these buggers in the shoe if I want my foot in there as well.
4.0,Thought it was going to be a different fabric .  Outfit was a cotton fabrication with some stretch. Top loner than shorts which may give the appearance of a mini dress from front view came above the knees sides were open to reveal the shorts from the side view.  Surprisingly cute cool outfit you can dress up or down!!😀
4.0,Needs to fit better in the butt.
4.0,"The dress is well made, the embroideries don't look cheap or cheesy, the material is thick and hangs well. This is a real dress, not a cheap halloween costume. I have lived in Germany and had bought authentic dirdln. This is worthy of ""Oktoberfest."" The size runs a little larger than what the size chart says. I had to return and order one size smaller. The reason for one less star is because the blouse and the apron are made of cheap uncomfortable cotton material. But with a good ironing, they still look good, just very stiff.  After Oktoberfest, the dress can be worn as a pretty party dress with a black underblouse and without the apron. Very happy I found it!"
4.0,Little short but I got a lot of compliments<br />Nice material
4.0,"Super thick. It’s funny but it’s a wee bit small, even on a child’s face. It is SUPER thick material."
4.0,Provides plenty of support while working out and is very comfortable. Bought another one in black
4.0,I use these tk work out at the gym and love them!! They're lightweight and comfy!
4.0,"This is not a real fancy wig, but for the price it is quite nice.<br /><br />I straightened the hair a little bit and then cut it off right at the shoulders. I needed it to make me look like the Albino from The Princess Bride and that worked very well. Came in 2nd in a costume contest. :)<br /><br />Bottom line; not high quality, but very nice anyway."
4.0,"Very nice product. One star less, for not having a chin strap string. Doesn’t need it , but should be there."
4.0,"I bought this for my husband who sometimes has to travel for work.  I thought it would be a good idea for when he travelled.  In the meantime, it's a pretty big case and is just taking up room.  If you travel a lot or change your contacts out for glasses when you're not at home, you might appreciate this case.  If you're always (or almost always) at home when you swap out your contacts for your glasses, this isn't very useful."
4.0,"No frills, keeps time and has all the info you need on a who-cares-if-it-breaks sport watch."
4.0,"This looks so much more expensive than its going for on here. I received a ton of compliments on this cover up. The only downfall is if your husband accidentally puts it in the dryer, it will shrink."
4.0,I am always cold at work and this keeps me nice and warm. I live in Wisconsin and we just had some frigid weather. This was perfect for that. Love it!!!
4.0,I’m an XL. I know things on amazon normally run small so I got a 2X it just fits.
4.0,"Love the open front styling, the thin (not bulky) design, and the dressy look. Only wish is that is was a little bit longer in the back or would have given 5 stars."
4.0,The earrings are very cute.  They are small (description says &#34;girls&#34;) but they look like they wear well.
4.0,"This adult small jacket fit my 10 year old daughter... with just a roll up of the sleeves. Added a mocking jay pin on it, and put the hair in the side braid and she was set to go! Would be a 10 rating if slightly thicker material but overall pleased. She loved it -most important."
4.0,Quick and easy way to clean jewelry but was a bit messy on the fingers.  When I'm in a rush and want a quick clean this is the way to go.
4.0,"I did size up a little, just in case. I bought them for a trip and was taking a gamble on them even arriving on time (they did, 2 weeks if I remember right) They are soft,  frayed just right and a comfortable."
4.0,"Masks work good, easy to breath out of. Only issue is after you hand wash the glitter on the mask starts to fall off."
4.0,Run big and to long for me.
4.0,It's super cute but I'll need to exchange it one size up before it'll fit right
4.0,The belt was what I expected. It looks like it well made.
4.0,It is as ordered and expected.
4.0,"I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 36 C, 34 hips. I ordered a size small. I think the fit is perfect. The color is pretty. The material is soft and very comfortable to wear. My only problem is that the tag on the shirt was super itchy and when I cut it out it made a hole. Other than that I really love this pj set!"
4.0,I had never heard of XoDo before.  They make very nice undergarments.  This makes my lovely DIL look nice when she heads out the door for work.  Washes up nicely and she says it is extremely comfortable.
4.0,"It's very pretty and nice and put it on a Patriot Lanyard so the Vet can wear it around her neck. The part that screws is not perfect, it a bit offset, but it will do."
4.0,These have become my staple for gym shirts.  They fit well in all the right places but are loose enough to where I don’t worry to much about the old spare tire hanging out some.
4.0,Very sturdy and realistic! My grandson is going to love them!!!
4.0,The dress was really well made and the colour looked just as advertised. I’m a big busted person and usually dresses are snug in that area for me but I felt like this dress had a little bit more room that normal. It was fine though and the pockets were a nice touch although if you put anything like a phone in the pocket it weighs down a lot.
4.0,I like the dress fits well washes ok
4.0,These are light weight and breathable!<br />I had an issue with a knot in one mask that rested on my nose making one of the three very uncomfortable to ware. Great for the factory job I have and for the gym!
4.0,"This hat is adorable, classic and well made. The only issue is if you plan to wear it outside, it is so lightweight it flies right off your head. Consider pinning it on."
4.0,"I always hesitate to buy shoes without trying them on first.  I'm hard to fit properly & frequently end up with a blister from new shoes.  Not in this case!  I bought these boots for a New Year's eve trip to NYC.  I was not able to wear them to break them in first.  I got them in the mail & off I went.  I walked all over NYC in these boots & they were great.  Super comfortable fit.  Not slippery on wet ground.  They're also easy to slip on & off.  The only reason I didn't score them 5 stars is that after about a year, they've developed a squeak, which I find annoying... but still super comfy!"
4.0,"The outside feels soft and is a decent heather grey. The inside is not soft and that is a bummer. It’s also a bit shorter than I expected for a loose fitting garment. I’m 5’6” and 140 pounds, and ordered a medium."
4.0,Comfortable except the back is rather low.
4.0,Fit as expected.  Only 4 ⭐️ 's because the stitching IMMEDIATELY started to unravel.
4.0,Practical wallet. Nice and big for all my cards. And it zips all the way around. I have this in like nine colors lol. I usually use Kate ♠️ Spade only
4.0,"These earrings are great for your tragus piercing, small enough to fit just right yet big enough to see that it is a dragonfly. Only complaints are that the backs were screwed on so tight when I got them I had to use pliers to get them off and 1 earring won’t stay screwed on, loosens and falls off my ear."
4.0,"I ordered this shirt because I just had abdominal surgery and need looser styles to hide the bondings and resulting swelling. I live in a desert climate, so it is hot and dry most of the time. The fabric of the shirt is thin, but it seems to be well made. It is not only loose enough to hide what I need it to hide, but is cool enough to prevent me from getting overheated. I will be handwashing this garment and would recommended the same to keep up the shape and integrity of the item. I would purchase again."
4.0,"Straps cut into my shoulders, but they never slide off my shoulders!! I'm a 32 F so the straps should be a bit more padded imo."
4.0,Very long lasting bands. I've only used one in three months. The company sends tools for getting the band on. I ordered a size too big but it works out well for my watch.
4.0,"Awesome!  Great fit, light weight and they don't ride up!  The waist band still rolls so I had to deduct a star."
4.0,Work gloves for my husband
4.0,"It's a nice tie, but it looks very silver to me... If you want a bronze/brownish color (like I did), this may not be the color to choose."
4.0,Very cute. Love the arm details. Cute with jeans and also with a pencil skirt for work..
4.0,Super cute shirt! I just wish I had ordered it before it got so cold so I could actually wear it out more often not covered up in layers lol
4.0,"A nice lightweight sweatshirt, slightly large"
4.0,"Nice quality shirt. Color is great and emblems are great. Fits as expected.  Do wish it was a softer fabric (why we gave it 4 stars), which is what we prefer, but overall nice product. Do recommend."
4.0,"Im a *big* guy. 6’ 3”, 280 lbs. One of the negative reviews says this is sized for linebackers. They are 100% correct, but for us linebackers it’s always a relief to find legit gear that’s sized for us. I got the 3xl and its the best motorcycle jacket i have owned to date. A little short in the torso, but other than that fits perfect. I usually have to live with tight torso or outrageously long arms. Thank god for this jacket. Removed one star only because i don’t love the color options. If they had some single colorway options (like an all navy blue option) or made this in the sage green that the baja s4 comes in, i would buy another and would consider it perfect."
4.0,"Nice shirt. However, polos seem to be cut a little small for fit build."
4.0,34F -band size as expected & cup as expected. If it didn't fit as you expected I would recommend going to Nordstrom and having them fit you for your true bra size.  For the price it is a decent high impact sports bra. I have several $60-$90 sports bras and the materials maybe slightly better but they still wear out after 4mos of regular use.  I used this bra in a high impact fitness class and had great support. going to buy another one.
4.0,"I purchased these because I have arthritis in my hands and sleeping had gotten really bad, waking up with my hands just aching so bad. Someone had recommended I try some compression gloves and I came across these in my search and decided to try them. Let me say first off that I tried to wear them for a long time the first day, that did not go well. My hands felt too constricted and my wrists ached, and I bought the size large gloves to make sure I wouldn't have a problem with them being too small. I realized that the better time to wear them was later in the day anyway, when my hands usually would start to get a little achy. I started putting the gloves on for a couple of hours a night before bed time, removing them just before going to bed, and it has made a world of difference in how my hands feel during the night. It did happen gradually over about a months time, but it slowly got better and better. I only gave them 4 stars because I can't wear them for more than a couple of hours without feeling like my wrists are starting to ache, like maybe a circulation issue, so I don't want to cause more problems than I already have, haha! But, they are great for what I was hoping to accomplish with them."
4.0,"Lots of caps for the money, aren’t very thick but they serve the purpose . Not much grip to hold in place"
4.0,Very happy with this cute holiday dress. Fits true to size
4.0,I need to be careful putting it on and taking it off. It's delicate and doesn't seem it's made of very strong material.
4.0,Very fun earrings. They came packaged to protect the fringy part from becoming damaged. One star off because they look a little cheap...but they actually were inexpensive so I'm not terribly disappointed in that.
4.0,Good sunglasses!
4.0,It fits male and female faces. The only problem is it slides on the nose.
4.0,Received Promptly. They are good size and not heavy. Great for everyday wear. Rainbow colors not quite as bright as I had hoped but still happy with purchase.
4.0,They seem a little frumpier in person. Good for lounging though. They are comfy.
4.0,They are comfy got them in black love them!
4.0,cool!!!!!  I bought this product for my boyfriend; it's super cool. I like the fabric and the design but it's somewhat small. I choice large his regular size but it's kind of tight on him so I should get a x-large.
4.0,I could fit so much into this underseater. Electronics lifesaver. So convenient and easy to use! I love it!
4.0,It fits everything even more fullsize shampoo and conditioner love it will be buying  more colors
4.0,Great fit. Super cute and figure flattering. Fabric very thin and lighter colors are completely see through.
4.0,Nicely made. Meets my needs
4.0,"these are very form fitting, fits your foot like a glove. No support at ALL...if that is something that matters so I wouldnt wear them if on my feet all day, but extremely comfortable in all aspects. Worth the money."
4.0,great for working around the house......
4.0,Quality wasn’t the best but for the price it was what I expected. I needed a quick and cheap apron for a play my daughter was in.  It got the job done without breaking the bank and we were able to add it to the dress up collection
4.0,"Nice shape, but material is easy to worn off after washing"
4.0,"I'm torn between a 4 and 5 star review - were I to rate it on value (cost and durability), I would give it a 4.  Has not lasted a year, however, I have to say that my wife uses this little card holder constantly, so given it is used so heavily, and liked so much, it could have given it 5 stars.  I guess, in the end, the best rating is to say that I'm going to get her another one."
4.0,It's  a lovely dress but it's  somewhat small but a size up. I have to do a replacement  as i bought it for my mother in law.
4.0,Cómo en la foto
4.0,"The material is not the one I was expecting, but at the end fit nicely. It is like a bathing suit material."
4.0,"Bought this for a Hawaiian wedding.  Although the quality was appropriate for the price and the fabric and print are nice, I found that the fit was poor in the bust.  It felt like someone with a smaller bust would have looked better.  Too top heavy and its not that flattering.  I ended up not wearing it to the wedding, but instead used it as a bathing suit cover up as it has a casual look with sandals and a beach hat."
4.0,"For the most part, I was very happy when I got this. I don't know if it's specifically for your nipple or if you can use it for cartilage, but that's what I'm using it for. I got tired of the bar through my ear, and wanted to try some rings. Like I said, I'm happy but it's bigger than I though it would be."
4.0,Runs small but good
4.0,I cant wear leather due to skin allergies. So the c4 belt is great for me. Only thing is I have to wear them for daily use and the belt do not last long. I buy them 2 at a time because they break or the rubber tears after a short time. They last about 2-3 months that's it.
4.0,"I needed a pair of mittens that would work with hand warmers while walking on cold winter mornings. This suit my needs perfectly. They are well knit with no loose stitching and have a thin fleece lining to help hold their shape. The mittens themselves are not overly heavy or thick so might not be the best choice for extremely cold temperatures on their own. But with the hand warmers they keep my hands warm in below freezing conditions, which is what I needed."
4.0,"Really cute! Super easy to slip on and wicked comfy behind my ears when I’m on the water —can’t tell if they will cause the glasses float if I fall in the water yet..,so 4 stars for now"
4.0,"Very cute, all of them are exactly as pictured aside from Seiler Mars and sailor Jupiter who have defects on the eyes. Sailor Jupiter has missing white on her eyes. Sailor Mars does not have her eyelashes colored, and they are the same color as her skin and it looks very weird.  Although I can overlook sailor Jupiter's defect, sailor Mars cannot be overlooked it's just too obvious."
4.0,Love this dress but felt it needed to be longer. Got a larger size and it was definitely longer but I don’t feel like the arms or bust got much bigger. Material is thin over bust.
4.0,"My son loves this jacket with vibrant colors, fit him great only thing is by now I think we know the Chinese sizes you must go up to 3 sizrs  for accurate fit"
4.0,These are so cute..my granddaughter loved them...but they do run small...she normally wears 14s but the 14-16 was pretty tight at top ...bottom half fit fine
4.0,I like it but they were a little too big for my daughter to wear.
4.0,"Figure flattering, nice quality fabric."
4.0,"The color and design is great, but the  circle was printed slightly off to the left of center."
4.0,"Good purchase, I truly appreciate it. Only wish I would have ordered XL, I have 8 inch dreadlocks. However I’m very pleased."
4.0,"Great color and fun, warm weather dress."
4.0,I use this outfit to hangout with friends and family.
4.0,"Live it, very lightweight and cute"
4.0,These riding tights are made well. I am returning because the fit is too large for me. The full seat looks very sticky.
4.0,"I bought this bag for my husband to use as an airline carry on. We are traveling to Europe this spring and he will use it as a day bag. There is plenty of room for camera, guide books, water bottle and a jacket or fleece. There is also an outside pocket for his phone. The bag is well made and very attractive."
4.0,"I bought 2 sizes bigger and I'm glad I did. The top fit perfect, as for the bottoms...... If they were any smaller, I would not be able to wear them. It's a VERY cute swimsuit and I've gotten a lot of compliments. But if you're looking to buy this, order big!!"
4.0,"SUPER cute, i have this in my philtrum piercing and i get compliments ALL the time.<br />however!! it is turning my lip a lil green. its not visible unless you look under the piercing so it doesnt bother me, but if you have an unhealed piercing or are super sensitive to low quality metals i would steer clear."
4.0,"The dress is actually cute and decent quality for the price. However, I returned it because it was too large. If you order this size down!"
4.0,"** Update: Seller helping to resolve the problem.  Great customer service!  Cannot wait for the new set. **<br /><br />Cute idea, bought as a gift.  Came with 2 &#34;big sis&#34; keychains, the &#34;middle sis&#34; one is missing.  Will be returning."
4.0,Love this dress. I get compliments every time I wear it. The only thing I would change is the type of fabric on the bottom portion. I wish it felt like the top.
4.0,"good, but not as expected"
4.0,these were cute and long enough. but there are no ruffles on the bottom of them.
4.0,"nice for my age, not too short."
4.0,"I was very hesitant purchasing this sweater because there were no reviews and the color says yellow, when it’s clearly not. I needed something with tassels for a bachelorette party and it’s going to be cold out. This was actually very comfy and looked better than I thought. It is a little shorter so I would size up if you want it somewhat loose fitting. I got a small and wearing with high waisted jeans so I don’t mind much. It’s also almost a gold color. Still pretty. The top rides up slightly but I think that’s with any off the shoulder tops. Overall pretty pleased."
4.0,"Pretty dress, but it ran way smaller than I expected and it is not designed for large-chested women. The top has very little stretch to it. Good quality for the price though."
4.0,"I love this dress!  It's a really cute flowy dress and it's very Comfortable. However,like most of the previous reviews this dress does runs big, so go down a size. Other than that it's a great dress and I will be ordering it again in a different color."
4.0,Came as ordered for a Christmas gift
4.0,Fit a little too snug than expected. I would definitely size up.
4.0,"Nice pj's.  I am 5'2&#34; and 120 lbs and ordered the small.  Fit fine.  The front is a little more low cut than I would like but still OK.  The legs do ride up on me when I put my feet up, sitting front of the TV.  Nice material, like a soft t-shirt."
4.0,It was tricky to use at first but it didn’t take long to get the hang of it.
4.0,"Really cute sweater, not as soft as it looks, but I get compliments every time I wear it"
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for someone and they really loved. It was a little smaller than I expected, but it's really cute."
4.0,Wasn't a bad fit overall however i believe the mid-calf length is not flattering on a shorte person.
4.0,"Cute dress. Just a little bit in the top, but not too bad. I only saw one sewing issue on the top of one shoulder."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Bought a medium according to the size chart. It fits loosely. If there is a next time I will definitely make it a small.
4.0,it was  cute had to return it because the chain had a knot in it. :(
4.0,The material wasn’t exactly what I was expecting and the rounded edges seems to draw attention to my midsection.
4.0,Its ok just not for everyday use. It looks very fragile used it on the weekend but decided to take it off because it looks very fragile.
4.0,I may not be using it correctly but iI does clean up silver quite well. Not sure if I want to use on other metals. Need to learn more about it.
4.0,Me quedaron grandes. Como no había 7.5 encargue un 8. De todos modos se las regale a mi hija y le encantaron! Muy cómodas.
4.0,It fit somewhat a little smaller but this is also a good thing because it looks great when it fit.
4.0,They are so form fitting and show every bump or bulge thaat the older frame is sure to have.
4.0,very thin material but fit perfectly and looks really cute on.
4.0,I like everything about them.<br />Great for after work.
4.0,"Very thick, stiff leather, as described. Very difficult to get the buckle through the hole the first few times until the holes stretch a little. Holes on mine were slightly off center, noticeable with the stock buckle. I swapped the narrower buckle from the watch I put it on, and it is much easier to clasp, and the off center holes are barely noticeable. Looks good on my blue faced Seiko 5."
4.0,Purse was very cute and would have worked great for s themed event. Unfortunately the strap broke the first time I used it. The company however offered me a refund and I was pleased with the outcome.
4.0,It is as expected. It’s a little hard to get it to lay properly but I bought it for a costume event so it’s perfect.
4.0,A little snug in the arms but it fit well. I like the design. And I got a lot of compliments. I put it in the wash and the dryer. It didn't shrink or frey.
4.0,"As an entry level cyclist it’s nice to have these options to avoid remortgaging a house to pay for equipment. I originally ordered the 2XL, but returned it for the XL. Im 6’2” 225lbs and the XL fit snug enough that it wasn’t flapping in the wind, but wasn’t so tight that the zipper was begging for mercy. Great so far, 5 of 5 once I see how well they hold up."
4.0,Works for our bathroom design
4.0,"I ordered a size up and the bust was still too small.  I couldn't tell about flattering, comfort, stretch since if couldn't get it fastened."
4.0,Recommend not drying
4.0,Awesome dress. Colors are beautiful and fit is super flattering. Gave four stars only because it runs a bit small I had to exchange it for a bigger size.
4.0,"I mean… you get what you pay for. These are fun for dress up.<br /><br />One was broken when I received them, but I like that there are several to choose from. I gave one as a gift and my friend loved it! ❤️"
4.0,I bought this golf jacket for my sons birthday.<br />He said he likes it and it fits well.
4.0,"I picked this up on Amazon just as an experiment because it looks just like the $300 ring my fiancé said he wanted. When it came in, I showed it to him and he was amazed at the price, quality, and appearance of it."
4.0,"If you have to wear one of these, at least this one is nice looking."
4.0,Loved the crystal. Considering the sige of the crystal I wish the chain were shorter.
4.0,"The design of this rhinestone top is very good. It has two longer metal chains, which can be adjusted according to our body shape. It fits very well!"
4.0,Es muy cómodo pero es un poco chico  tienes que pedir una talla más grande
4.0,So far so good. They say they float and I haven't dropped them off the boat yet. I hope they do when/if the time comes.
4.0,"So far, so good. I wear them with my scutes and they barely show. Also wear them with sneakers and they don't show."
4.0,"It's a very nice band, but it is not easy to adjust as the description says. I had to take it to the jeweler to get links removed.  They are not pins they are tiny screws."
4.0,"Got these for my daughter, she likes them a lot says they fit well and are really comfortable throughout the day"
4.0,Looks great on little baby Georgia!
4.0,Can dress it up or down either way super cute for summer
4.0,On time shipping good quality just as described
4.0,Bought these bear plush paw gloves for my grand daughter and she loves them
4.0,"This item fit the bill. Though the color was a little too light, see-through, and not as &#34;hot pink&#34; as the photo shows. The waist band did stretch some but still a bit uncomfortable. I'm a size 10 and expected a &#34;one size&#34; to accommodate but I guess I need to jog a few blocks to make it fit better haaaaa. All in all the item arrived on-time, securely wrapped, at the right price, and will serve its purpose at the Terri Brodeur Breast Cancer Walk in October."
4.0,Ordered these to do the Color Run 5k. They worked well and were perfect for the race.
4.0,Super cute I really like it. The size is accurate and I happy with the ring overall!
4.0,This hat was of decent quality. Im happy with it.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8f217ff108fbf1a42d65e321e4fc0b6b]] Great shirt! Comfy, loose fitting material. Would look great with jeans. I'm 5'4 135lb and ordered the medium to be safe but probably could have went with a small because of the length of the sleeves. Overall, love it!"
4.0,Tight fitting!
4.0,Definitely tiny earrings but I really wanted the cz pair & it’s missing the stone on one earring. Kind of a bummer.
4.0,I am very small chested. So the waist sits a little funny and it seems longer on me. But it is very comfortable and I will definitely wear this summer! The purple color is just as pictured!
4.0,"Love the pendant, no issues. The cord i like as well, however, it comes untied constantly."
4.0,"Really too thin to be considered leggings -- more like footless tights. But the colors are cute, the material is soft, and the quality seems fine. I was a size 12 before pregnancy, currently 24 weeks, and they fit great, with room left to stretch. I would only wear them with a tunic or short dress, though."
4.0,"These are lanyards with beaded decorations to wear with your glasses, so you can easily take them off and let the lanyard hold them around your neck. If you want an eye catching lanyard this is OK, though they are a little expensive."
4.0,They aren’t very soft but are thick.
4.0,"My daughter loved this watch, it was an Easter present and it was awesome. I also bought another watch for my youngest daughter."
4.0,"I love the hoodie very much, but I was so sad to open it and not being able to tie it up when I got it. They should include the ribbons for the sides. It’s noticeable that it’s supposed to be tied up if I leave it untied. Overall  great hoodie."
4.0,Very sparkly and my granddaughter loved them. I just wish the Velcro straps weren’t so long. The color is a blush pink and very pretty.
4.0,This dress was really cute but a tad short for me. My one gripe though was that the material was a little thick for hot weather.
4.0,Love the shirt. Only problem i have is that the picture on the shirt looks a little blurry.
4.0,"It was a little tight on my head but that was expected. I always have that problem with hats. Other than that, really good quality/value."
4.0,"I really like this romper. I only give it 4 stars because of the fabric. It reminds me of shiny tablecloth that you would see during Christmas time.<br />But like I said, I really like this romper, I just don’t like how it looks from the back for my body type. And I wish the straps were adjustable so I could tighten the top.<br />Unfortunately, I have to return it.<br />I’m 5’2, 175 pounds. Got aXXL."
4.0,Really nice looking watch and it fits good as well. The leather band is a little stiff but I did just get it yesterday so it may soften up. Has a nice sized dial and easy to read with a clean sleek look. I’m not a fan of the stationary band holder so close to the buckle because it feels like I’m bending the band extremely too much that’s why I gave 4 stars. Overall it’s a nice watch for the price. Good find!
4.0,"For reference, I'm 5' 5&#34; at about 180lbs with measurements at 42&#34; bust, 38&#34; waist, and 44&#34; hips. I purchased the XL, and this thing dwarfs me. Be prepared that it's surprisingly weighty too when you pick it up. Now, I admit that I wanted something a bit fluffier and larger, but the sleeves are very long and get in the way of everything if I'm wearing it and trying to do something productive. The waist can be cinched in well enough with the tie, and the length is perfect. It's just the really long and wide sleeves. Reading a book or typing up a business report on the computer? Works just fine. But don't expect to do the dishes wearing this. On a happier note, this robe is very, very soft, and (following the washing instructions) does just fine in the washer and dryer with no pilling or snags."
4.0,"I have a 7 7/8” big head. It’s does fit. Maybe about an inch of the nylon strap left. Also I have a tall head, so it’s a shallow hat. Sits about 3/4” above my ears. Just fyi to anyone else with a huge head."
4.0,"This scarf is very very soft! It was going to be a gift, but it didn't arrive in time for when I needed it because of the delays with the USPS. I was going to return it but decided to keep it once I felt how soft it is. It's a good size too."
4.0,They feel great even at the end of a 12-hour shift. They do leave some interesting patterns on my legs though. Don't plan on wearing shorts for a while after taking them off.
4.0,"rlly like the black patchwork option but sizing is weird ppl said to size up and my body dysmorphia got me soo, screwed up and went to big. smh if you don't have body dysmorphia  your fine ig lol , love these tho"
4.0,"This is an amazing bracelet, only con is it pulls arm hair"
4.0,"The quality isn't the best, but I love getting a variety of different black chokers. Good enough for the price."
4.0,"I replaced the chain with another, but the pendant itself is very interesting.  You don't see anyone else wearing one"
4.0,"Just a little too long but that I was able to have tailored, everything else is an amazing fit!  Super dress, so much prettier in person! (Plus a littler dressier than it looks which actually works for me and my job). Tons of complements!  Definitely recommend!"
4.0,"came as described, fast shipping"
4.0,"Bottoms loosen after one day of wearing. LOVE the top! Great suit for the price, sizes on size chart are wrong, runs true to regular size"
4.0,I really like the bracelet. The leather is pretty stiff but all in all fits right and looks very nice.
4.0,"Ok so first I want to make sure everyone knows that these aren't gold but they are gold plated. Also something I expected was for them to be a bit more gold, but they are kind of gold-plated/yellow looking. When I opened them though I was in for a pleasant surprise because even though they were a bit more yellow-y than I expected they look soooo pretty!!! These are perfect for day or night and look like great statement earrings, highly recommend!"
4.0,Great summer dress. Cute classic dress.
4.0,"I REALLY like that hat...but hate that it is crumpled up and I will have to steam it in order to be able to wear it. Great looking hat though, once that is done."
4.0,"As socks, they are great. For compression, not tight enough for me."
4.0,It’s a lovely bracelet. Unfortunately it’s a little snug on my wrist and that’s why I gave it 4 stars. I usually wear 7 and 1/4 inch bracelets so this one must be less. I’ve decided not to return it but instead give to my sister. She’s petite and I think it will fit her better.
4.0,I love the material ! Comfy. A little see through if u pant to wear without a bra I wouldn't do that... also it is a little lose at where the dress ends wish it was tighter in that one place. But I think it would look really cute with a tan/beige winter coat . Also sorry about my dirty mirror but u get the idea of the dress
4.0,Works and seems dependable (in use for a few month now for remote SCADA type system).
4.0,Great robe. A little thin but the material is comfortable. If you're looking for warmth you may want to consider something a little thicker. Holds up to washing well so far but feels like it will need to be replaced at a regular interval. But at it's price point I will plan on replacing with the same product. Would recommend to a  friend.
4.0,big enough to squeeze in many clothes for carry on and very light.  only downside is it doesn't have waist band so hard to keep it tight but very happy with this bag.
4.0,Nice and soft but sleeves are a little short.
4.0,Looks bigger in the photo. It's no larger than a thumbnail.
4.0,"Hate the club, but my nephew likes the scarf and hat"
4.0,Very nice hat for the money. I would order from again!
4.0,"Very cute, lots of compliments! They are very tight, though, and I can only wear them for a short time."
4.0,The fabric of this dress was surprisingly nice. I figured for a costume dress it would be a light weight fabric so it wa since to get a quality dress. The color does fade quite a bit after washing which is the reason I did not rate as 5 star.
4.0,Very relaxed fit around the waist and hips but close fitting at the bust. Wrinkles easily but I still like it. 30C/32B for reference.
4.0,"I have ordered this leotard for several years and love the overall shape and quality. I prefer a leotard with a large cotton content. The size has changed, hence the 4 stars.  It now fits more like Capezio leotards, which are sized super-small.  Note that it is made for dancers, so you may need to go up 2 sizes. You can wear a bra under this."
4.0,I bought these for my bridal party after the local stadium said clear bags only! The bridal party loved them! It’s a great size! Although I have not used it yet but first impression is positive!
4.0,"Can be worn with cross in front or back, but seems confusing with tag on the cross side. Otherwise very comfortable, good material."
4.0,"This is a cute dress.  I’m going to keep it but feel Undecided.  The fabric is kind of odd, almost kind of thick and silky, not what I expected.  The seam across the bust hits me in an odd spot I have a large bust).  This is probably a lot more flattering and more boho looking on a smaller chested person but over all it’s comfy and leopard print is a neutral so I’m keeping it :D"
4.0,Cute shorts. Easy to wear.
4.0,The adjustable interior band made the hat wearable.  It's a cute hat but a bit heavy.
4.0,"Very comfortable, good quality material, great with yoga shorts."
4.0,These are very cute. They are good quality and stay in place. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars as they fit very tightly. I am a size 8 and these are just are uncomfo
4.0,Sister loved this as a gift
4.0,"great!!! a little bulky on my key chain but great to find my key... only thing, the eyes are only on one side and there is the brand name written on the other side. Wish the eyes were on both sides."
4.0,"Cute gloves, very warm, not water proof, one of the gloves wasn't stitched properly and had a hole in the finger."
4.0,"My husband likes this necklace.  It is a bit large, but overall good style."
4.0,I still wore it
4.0,"Cute shirt, love the pattern"
4.0,I love it however it is a little tighter in the bust area than I would have liked.. But I am keeping it!
4.0,"The product you see in the picture is the one I arrived, I was very happy with the purchase. The sizes are consistent with the measurements.<br /><br />The material is very comfortable"
4.0,Nice hoodie - great quality but runs small .  Difficult to judge size but I lucked out for my granddaughter.
4.0,The girlfriend loved them so did her coworkers. Took forever for delivery
4.0,White is kinda transparent but black is okay. Great work out outfit
4.0,"As expected.  I love the color and it will be a nice casual item for those times when you don't quite need a coat, but need a little something."
4.0,"Great skirt & fits as expected. I am 5'0, 130 lbs, 34-29-37 and ordered a medium and it fit just as it expected. Stretchy and snug but not too tight. Length is at my knees and the arms fit good & not tight either. A bit see through so wear a slip."
4.0,very happy with them . one problem is the color is very close to my skin color so wearing them causes people to look twice.
4.0,"These are very pretty earrings that came to me jumbled in a box. They weren't inside a plastic bag or anything so I wonder if they were used. The back of one of the earrings came a little bent and I had to straighten it out.<br /><br />Overall they're nice but the presentation left me a little disappointed. I think I received a customer return. As for the earrings themselves, they aren't overly sparkly but they are cleverly designed and the emerald eyes of the snake has a nice sparkle. They are on the dainty side but definitely eye catching because of their unique design. I can honestly say I don't have any other earring in my collection that looks like this."
4.0,This is a cute simple cardigan that fits nicely and is heavy weight. Good for cold nights where you want extra warmth.
4.0,"I love this dress, it fit well and looks amazing! I would've gave it 5 stars but I personally wish it was a few inches longer in the front. I am 5&#34;2 and my dress was pretty short in the front."
4.0,"This is a pretty nice jacket, and it IS waterproof - YAY! It is warm, and true to size. I only wish it had a velcro hood tab so the hood didn't interfere with my peripheral vision. Otherwise, it's almost perfect."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful, BUT-two caveats. 1-fabric is thin and it requires a slip of some kind since it is not lined at all. It’s also kind of cheaply made, loose strings here and there, but the print is lovely, and the wrap-around design is nice. 2. The sizing on this is weird. The small is a little too small. I feel like my boobs are putting so much strain on the fabric that it’s about to bust at the seams, and the slit in the front is too revealing, plus it’s shorter than I’d like (I’m 5’7”). The medium is a perfect length and the skirt wraps well so I don’t have any issues with a revealing slit, but the bust is loose no matter how I wrap it, so my boobs are falling out. It requires a camisole for the sake of modesty. And again, the sheerness....Overall this is a pretty dress and if you wear it with the right undergarments and in the right size, not expecting it to be something that will last the rest of your life, it will work."
4.0,Sooo cute and professional. Buttons popped off with first wash but I wear it with a cardigan to work anyway.
4.0,I really like the support of the sandal.  It fits great.  I just wish that they were easier to get on and off.  The buckle on the side toward the back is rather awkward.
4.0,Liked the look. Was a litle thinner than I hoped
4.0,"I love the tie, but it isnxt a true red. My mom and husband both thought it was more of a red-orange and I see it too. It's a nice tie, but I wish it was closer to the color in the picture."
4.0,".....except  for the SMALLEST bell,  it doesn't  MAKE A SOUND!!  What is up with THAT???????  Can  you  replace the little bell??  Let me know & I will  change  my review and add another star.  For now,  four stars."
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter, she wears them a lot."
4.0,A little small but could work with it!  This Uncle was tickled with it!
4.0,"Nice goggles, fit well with no leaks."
4.0,Was a little longer than expected.
4.0,"A little larger than expected, but I really like the shirt. Extremely comfortable."
4.0,This is visually correct to the picture but it run short. I should of ordered it larger. I have not washed it yet to see if it shrinks.
4.0,Pretty top - very little &quot;give&quot;..
4.0,"I wonder why there are so many negative reviews, for something so reasonably priced.<br />If one wants Fine Jewelry, one should be ready to pay the price.<br />This piece exceeded my expectations, I find it to be very nice. It is unique, which I like, and striking when it glows. I received several compliments while I was wearing it.<br />I would buy it again."
4.0,"If you have a bunch of badge buddy, this one is go to. It lasts about one year"
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my sister as she needs a good multipurpose bag that can take regular use/wear. The seller photos are accurate. It looks like it costs a bit more than I paid for it! Lots of nice compartments on the inside and big enough but not too big.
4.0,"Cute, good price for the product."
4.0,Ok changing pad. Kinda flimsy
4.0,"I'm 5'10"" 240<br />Bought an XL... It fit pretty good but is a kinda short"
4.0,It was a little loose in the fit - almost boxy in the waist/hip area.  But it wasn't too bad and I kept it anyway since overall it was a nice dress.
4.0,"Great look and design, the carbon fiber one is a little thicker and I often take it out of my back pocket. I kept it with 3 cards and it held tight and then again with 12 cards and it held together just the same. Slim fresh looking wallet!"
4.0,The fit was great but the waist line is too high and it's a bit see through at the bottom. I recommend paring this dress with a wide waist belt (to cover the awkward waist line) and wearing a slip underneath it.
4.0,"I received so many compliments when I wore this dress to work. I thought the quality was good and I am considering buying the red. They only thing I didn't like is how low cut the V neck was. Not professional for a work dress, so I added a stitch to bring it up a little higher."
4.0,"I shouldn't have to work quite so hard to pull on a pair of sockets.  They are thick and warm and attractive, but they are also tight and after several hours of wear, they do leave an indentation around my calf.  They are just a little shorter than I would like as well, although I wouldn't mind if they were more comfortable.<br /><br />I do not find myself wanting to wear these very often, even though they really look nice (the bright blue is very sporty).  That says alot.  Not terrible by any means, but I've got socks that suit me better."
4.0,"The feel good and do feel cool when there's a breeze. Good sun protection. Fit is a bit small for me, but I'm pleased, overall"
4.0,"These are so soft and warm. I wish they were a bit taller, but I like thigh highs and they're hard to find."
4.0,"Warning, does Not fit Casio's gw2310fb-1cr without &#34;doctoring&#34;. You'll lose some stars, Chronoworld, but not all of them. That said, I've joined them with...<br /><br />PerFit ZULU4 Ballistic Nylon Watch Strap + Spring Bars, Field Ready, Black-Ops/Brigade<br /><br />... and have to add that the triple combo looks tactical af!"
4.0,As expected  in shape but not in material
4.0,Very cute!  My son loved it.  I just wished the music stayed on a little longer when the button is pushed.
4.0,"Nice product, really enjoying this. Love the quality."
4.0,A little staticky for me. But a am also not very neat or smart.
4.0,"Was what I expected, soft and good for after bath"
4.0,"It definitely fits, but is shorter than I had expected; where it cuts off in the picture is how long is its pulled down right, NOT bunched up like she has it. Overall an ok feeling to the clothing, but isn’t as stretchy as I initially thought.<br />Wouldn’t buy again tho."
4.0,I really like these boots.  They are a little loose but I'm wearing regular socks with them if I had a pair of thick wooly socks they would probably fit just right.
4.0,"Very flattering suit, there are wires at the top which are weird, I haven't taken it swimming yet so I hope they don't rub or poke."
4.0,Cute but a little too tight for my regular sized girl in the elastic area
4.0,"My husband like them so far! Came in a nice sack. He says they won’t be his summer house shoes bc they hold in so much warmth. His shoe size is a 10, I got him the 11-12 and they fit snug. Some threading coming loose, so we’ll see how they hold up."
4.0,Very cute.  I aniticpated this would run small so I ordered a size larger than I would normally order.  Unfortunately - it's too big.  Very cute style.  You can't tell in the photo but it is layered at the bottom.  Very swingy.
4.0,"Very well made. The box they came in was banged up, but I didn't really need it, so it was fine."
4.0,Only downside is the size of the print.  It almost needs a magnifying glass to read it.  It would be better if it reflected 3 years instead of 4 so the print could be larger.
4.0,"Nice wallet, but snaps would be better as magnet snaps...hard to close."
4.0,"Worked better than expected. Bluetooth sync up rather quickly with my iPhone. Speakers were clear and at high volumes it was very loud. Beanie it self keeps me warm and fashionable. Most people couldn't tell it was more than just a beanie until they see the blue light on the controls side of the speakers. Would highly recommend it to listen music while staying warm on cold days/nights.<br />Wouldn't recommend using it to work out or on a run, just in case some people are interested in using it for that."
4.0,"Would have given these a 5 but they do slide off during yoga. Other than that, they are very cute!"
4.0,"Pretty dress for dance, but definitely size up!"
4.0,"Great product. Very cool. Love the feel and design of it. The only little thing I was hoping for was that the stainless steel wasn't so polished and shiny. I'm sure that's a plus for some and I can totally live with it, but would've loved more of a matte or brushed finish."
4.0,I used it for a Halloween crossfit costume . great worked as needed
4.0,This item works great coving and protecting my sons injured arm. I only wish they helped to keep his arm warmer. He has poor blood flow since the accident.
4.0,"I love these shoes! Just what I was looking for. I wear a 7.5 in all my foot ware and that is what I ordered, and they fit true to size. I don't wear much of a heel over 2&#34;, but I am able to walk without problems. I will most likely have to get an insert of some kind for the ball of my foot until I get use to the height. My width is average, but there is room for a little wider fit. No odor noted. The reason I only gave a 4 star has nothing to do with the product itself, but with how the package came. The last 3 things I have ordered from Amazon the boxes have been torn and smashed. Luckily what was inside was ok."
4.0,Still like the pattern small for my big head wish the brim was wider but still like it
4.0,"The quality is kinda bad, the peal and gems bangle had them falling out right out of the bag and the rest of the bangles were basically spray painted in cheap flakey and bubbly paint. But they do fit plus sized and that was the main reason for getting these. Don't get me wrong they do look nice from a afar! So as long as you see them as just costume jewelry and not everyday stuff to wear they are pretty good!"
4.0,"Upon first getting these i loved the material. Sooo soft and reminded me of my LLL Aligns. I ordered my regular size ( M,6) and when i tried them on they were too small, there was no way i was going to be able to workout in them or even lounge around. I gave them to a friend whom they fit perfectly and shes obsessed so I'd still recommend just make sure you size up.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I ordered one size up for myself since the last review and the quality is still amazing and the most comparable to my lululemon aligns. I've tried all the dupes and as far as look and feel these take the cake. BUT. The sizing is so off. I'm normally a medium and when I ordered the M it was too small. But now I've ordered a Large and its just way too loose. So sad! Still recommend even though I wont be able to enjoy them."
4.0,"This dress is one of those that looks nice, just not for me. Because of the stretchy fabric, there is no hiding any bumps in your curves if you are wearing the right size. On an hour glass figure, it will look wonderful. The material seemed sturdy, so I am not worried about it falling apart. The fabric was not thin at all. It was a little long with no shoes on, but I'm shorter (5'4&#34;) so I'm used to having to hem long skirts/dresses. You will likely need to steam it once you get it."
4.0,"The look is not the most flattering.<br />The fabric of the body is good, but the sleeves is not the softest."
4.0,"Overall they are amazing gorgeous chokers and they aren't too stiff and awkward like other thick ones, the only thing is the loop holding the actual lobster clip busted on me when I leaned down and I guess stretched my neck, luckily I have jewelry supplies and could fix it but other ones I have don't do that."
4.0,I work in a bakery so I am on my feet for 8 or more hours at a time so my ankles swell. I've noticed a difference when I wear these socks. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because they are a little long on me. They hit where my knee bends and rub awkwardly so I roll them down a bit.
4.0,I’m dropping my son off at MSU in a few days and figure I need some fan wear and the best price here. It’s a flattering style and comfortable
4.0,Very cute. But size up. If you have big bust order extra large.  I have big breast and a bit chubby around the middle. Ordered a large and wish I would of ordered an extra-large.  Other than that. Cute blouse
4.0,"I wanted to replace a Byrnes & Baker minimalist wallet that I owned for 30 years.  It was high quality leather and basically consisted of a money clip along with a single interior pocket on each side.  Well, you simply can no longer find a wallet that minimalist.  This item was the closest I could find.  I was initially disappointed as it is both longer and thicker than my Byrnes & Baker.  However, since then it has grown on me.  I certainly did not want the ID showing on the outside, or any other unnecessary frills as seen on similar competitor wallets.  I wasn't thrilled with the clear plastic for ID on this item, or the extra inside pocket above the clear plastic.  I wonder if the plastic will discolor or age over time?  I tend to not use the outside pocket, although I have temporarily thrown a card in there once or twice.  I definitely appreciate the RFID blocking, and perhaps this wallet needs to be thicker than my original for that purpose.  I now don't mind the two pockets on the right interior side as I have begun to carry two credit cards in addition to ID.  I purchased the solid black as I believe it looks much nicer than the highlighted brand name.  I see the price is now an additional 38% cheaper than what I paid!  That is disappointing for me, but I admit I thought it was a fantastic deal at $20 with a $4 coupon.  The packaging is extremely high quality and impressive upon arrival.  It is certain to impress the recipient if you are purchasing as a gift.  Overall, it appears to be decent to high quality and if you are attempting to find a super-minimalist money clip wallet this may be the best you can find."
4.0,I like the necklace but earrings are too small for my style. It was a good purchase overall for the price.
4.0,Easy one and easy off.  They are a hard rubber so that is good for long durability
4.0,"When travel with two kids and wants to bring as less as stuff possible, these kinds of packing bag is my best friend. I love use these bags for kid's clothes and socks so kids can find their stuff easily. Otherwise they have to dig inside the big luggage. These bags have handles can be carried easily. The bag can be expanded which is a big plus. Usually I have to expand if we have to travel more than 3 days. It also works great if one adult have a business travel for underwear or socks. It makes the luggage more organize."
4.0,The head band was almost what i expected. The Hidden Mist symbol is made of flimsy metal but it works. The back of the headband (The part you put against your head) is made of some sort of fake leather and is very irritating when you wear it for more than 4 hours. BUT IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY!!! I spent less than 7 dollars and received a decent headband.  Great buy for the money but not the best of quality!
4.0,I recommend ordering 1 to 2 sizes down from your normal size. Super cute
4.0,A bit smaller than I assumed butbthata my bad. It has an unpleasant oder that I'm hoping will dissipate with time. All in all good bang for my buck.
4.0,The top was a perfect fit! The bottoms were quite small and tight.
4.0,"The wand is BEAUTIFUL, but we only moved forward with this purchase because our daughter was very specific on the design she preferred for her wand. Our other child didn’t have a preference & her cheaper wand is much sturdier with a metal support through the middle. I wouldn’t have thought anything of it without having the 2 wand side by side & knowing the price tag difference."
4.0,Loved the softness of fabric!
4.0,"The hat arrived sooner than predicted from China. This is very good quality workmanship. Material is thick and sturdy. The hat is lined and the brim is stiff. It was a little big on me, but I am a small woman so men would probably have a better fit. Worth the price though, you do get a good hat for the money."
4.0,"I knew that I would probably have this issue since I'm a plus size (24-26) (350 lbs) Female. So they come up to just under my kneecaps. The colors are bright and the fabric is very light and airy. When pulled tight the fabric won't get runs in them. Very comfortable and I wore them all day at my job and they never fell down.  They would be perfect for a very skinny girl for knee-highs, but anyone that is over 200lbs, expect them shorter."
4.0,Very pretty but I would recommend buying a larger size. Colors are nice.
4.0,Normally wear an 8. I ordered a 7.5 because reviews said to order a size down. 7.5 was way too big. I ended up with a 6.5 and really liked them.
4.0,Cups don't stay in place and you get very uncomfortable by the end of the day
4.0,"They are comfortable and light weight. I ordered the package with white, gray and black tops. The black and white ones lay just right but the gray one climbs up. I would recommend just know that they might creep up on you."
4.0,It's small. Which I knew from other reviews. Lime it fits on top of your head. Looks cuter on my 2 year old because it fits the way a crown should. But it was good for pictures
4.0,They are exactly what I was looking for look wise. They are a tad small. Wish I would have gotten a half size bigger.
4.0,Appearance wise it looks good. My son hasn't worn it as.
4.0,Didnt look like the picture but it wasn't see-through :)
4.0,Just as pictured. Sturdy.
4.0,"The bow tie was a little small for my taste, but it was sufficient"
4.0,"The little plastic things that hold the lenses in are easily popped out, but hey, they're cheesy little glasses no worries.<br />I had gotten some of these back when I was a kid at Headlines in Nashua NH, and looked for them ever since.<br />Great to look at fireworks, or christmas lights, or whatever.. just don't like, drive with them on."
4.0,"These are a thick material, which may be good or bad depending on the weather. The two side seam pockets are big enough to hold my iPhone X in its thin UAG plasma case with just a tiny bit of the top sticking out. Of course, the placement of the pockets makes the phone add even more width to my hips, but at least they hold the phone securely. They are stretchy enough that they can hold something a little thicker, but I don't think a heavy case would fit."
4.0,Fits as expected but material is very heavy
4.0,my husband loved these pants. I find they wrinkle more than I would like.
4.0,"This is a very light blue, almost white. This will not match a blue opal very well. The front ball which has the opal part is on the large side and would really only be suited for a helix piercing. I would have definitely preferred the blue be a bit darker and the earring to not be so large. That being said this hugs my helix piercing well and does not slide back and forth due to the relatively short post."
4.0,Tight shoulder area.
4.0,Love it very pretty... got many compliments...Lovely piece!
4.0,"Didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't  worn  it daily yet. It is a nice quality 2 piece hat. The brim comes off to make a smaller hat . The hat has to  shape it in the form  you would prefer to wear it very, easy to do."
4.0,I love it.  The only set back is that it changed color with my sweat. :-(
4.0,Cute bracelets. They accessorize well. I have small wrists and these fit a little snug so make note but I do like them
4.0,"This look quite nice. I was worried it would look too cheap but its fine. The only problem with it is that the back part that closes, to keep the pin closed, swivels far too easily. I havent worn it yet, but im afraid it will easily open and fall off. Otherwise its exactly what I was expecting."
4.0,Seem a little snug for curvy girls. I’m keeping them because paired with the right top they’re super cute.
4.0,I usually wear an XL and I needed a 2X to fit. However it is very cozy!
4.0,"Seems to be pretty high quality and I like the color (I got the red one). The only con is that the wallet is just slightly too wide for my liking. I would prefer it if the extra bit on the right side wasn't there, but it's a solid wallet regardless."
4.0,"Order was perfect for my outside shade. It took a very long time to receive the order, more than 3 weeks?"
4.0,"These are the glasses that were step above the righteous cat eyes (#1301's) that true snowballers wore on the California ski slopes during the 80's. Out of pure nostalgia, I had to buy those original cat eyes first and then these. The 'Legend's' were/are rarer and more expensive and more sophisticated looking. If they were available with amber driving lenses, it would be fulfillment of  a 5-star dream"
4.0,"I love how it fit, I sized up. Usually buy medium but got a large."
4.0,Love the colors and that they are light-weight. They did have a pretty strong earthy smell right out of the package. Had to let them air out a bit before I could wear them.
4.0,was just as expected nice hat
4.0,Good buy if you just want some cheap glasses that you don't mind loosing. The lenses are pretty dark though.
4.0,I was satisfied with this buy Im 5’5 and 120 pounds so I got a size small they fit great! Just a little to long. All and all it’s a good buy🥰
4.0,"I'd love to wear them, but they are too big! The flair is HUGE on them, so knock it down a size when ordering. BUT, of course, they don't have that ONE size in stock now, so seems I'll be doing some stretching!  Can't exchange them bc....ehh, it's just super irritating to try and communicate with broken Engrish as the convo( on their part). So, I gave up on that. But, they are solid and nice. Exactly as pictured and pretty."
4.0,"I like the shirt. However, it's a little bit big in the shoulder part. Also, in the chest area it was a bit smaller. On the stomach part it does make you look a little slimmer  So I'm content with the size I got.  If I would have gone up a size it woukd have been to big."
4.0,"Love love love this! It does smell a little chemically out of the package, once I washed it, it was okay! The best thing is, I can get away with wearing this to work (I work in healthcare) ! You can dress it up and dress it down too! Let me tell you, I feel like I’m wearing PJs to work. I need more!"
4.0,Really nice toiletry bag.
4.0,"NicelNicely made, pocket for everything. Soft leather."
4.0,Colors bled together after a few washed but still one of my favorite dresses
4.0,"very pretty, nice setting"
4.0,"I own several of the single color OR Radar caps.  They are a technical type synthetic material that has good sun protection, is light weight and is easy to wash and dry.  This cammo version feels much more like cotton and more like thick cotton - like an Army issued hat.  That can be good or bad - to each their own.  My biggest issue is it feels like I will have to wear this a lot and wash it several times before it breaks in and feels like a hat should.  The normal OR Radar caps feel perfect from the second you remove the tag"
4.0,Got it for my sister. It's good quality. My sister loves it. I bought this over a year ago and she still uses it.
4.0,"This is a lightweight jacket with a good fit and warmth. It is a soft polyester fabric that weighs practically nothing, but it really cuts the wind. It fits as I expected it would. It's a little longer on me than it is on the model, but I'm 5'4"", so I'm used to that."
4.0,"I really dislike two layer wetbags.  The feel of inner PUL on outer PUL when you have to push the inner layer back after laundering is terribly unpleasant.  I had hopes this was small enough it wouldn't be as bad, but it is still.  Love the print and the quality is fabulous however."
4.0,reading tablet.
4.0,"Great sweater. I'm 6'1&#34; and 160 so i ordered a 2X, which i normally must for the arm length. Well, I definitely got just that...it will fit great once I bring the sleeves in 8 inches or so. No biggie, but a large would've been just about right, if the sizes  run true to themselves. Great quality sweater, I live in Minnesota so wearing 3 layers is normal for me. I'll make a handy dandy stash pocket inside the extra long sleeve cuffs I make."
4.0,Color is nice and material was pretty good.
4.0,Wore it for the Tax March today! So much easier than making a sign!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:5f2b471e3d4fff67c899151360bd3f76]] Excelente cómodo liviano y muchas funciones
4.0,"Good quality, basic jewelry making."
4.0,I ordered it by mistake
4.0,"The clarity is good and it is definitely polarized, but in my estimation the polarization and definition from Oakley is superior. However, given the cost, and the fact that I use these for driving, these are definitely worth the savings!  The main issue I've found is that the coating on the outside of the lens rubs off easily from regular wiping/cleaning.  Still, even if that's the case they continue to work."
4.0,See title (too small)
4.0,Fit and look is exceptional
4.0,I purchased this as a gift for a friend and haven’t given it to her yet. It’s a very pretty and heavy feeling bracelet and comes in a gift bag. I may end up buying one for myself too!
4.0,"I purchased the spice color and it is truly beautiful and well made. The closure is reliable and durable. My only issue is that when there are items in all the slots, cash and coin holders the wallet is FULL. There is no room for extra stuff (I like to put my receipts in my wallet when I shop) so I gave this wallet four stars instead of five because before I can put anything else in it I will have to take something out. Maybe the leather will stretch over time and give me a little more space for stuff when I am out and about, like receipts/stamps, business cards, etc."
4.0,Normal quaility
4.0,I bought this to use for pictures for my travelers notebook. It does fit but I am having to trim down all of my wallet sized lotuses to fit. I do love the actual product though.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter who is “well-endowed.” She has to wear a t-shirt under it because the XL is too short. She did like it overall though and it is very good quality.
4.0,It's a great shirt design but the material of the shirt is pretty thin and shrinks really good in the wash. Other than that it's one of my favorite shirts to wear
4.0,I bought this for my 12 year old and it fits him perfect.
4.0,Quality construction and cut with room to bowl.  I got a nice yellow T-shirt to bring out the highlights.  love the shirt.
4.0,Cute shirt size was accurate. It will shrink after being washed you may want to vuy a size up. Also these polo shirts are a little thin comfy enough to also wear under a button up.
4.0,"Anyone that's been in ski boots knows how cold feet can get. These kept my wife's toes, toasty warm. She was very happy with these socks"
4.0,I like the comfort of the sandal just a little too short
4.0,"Very well made and quite cute.<br />I love the slipper, but it runs short and<br />the toe section seems wider than normal.<br />Overall I love my ""little dazzlers"".<br />I also gave 2 pair as a gift and she said<br />they were wide in the toe area, but was<br />equally pleased with them.<br />EXCELLENT VALUE."
4.0,The dress is very comfortable and I love the pockets
4.0,It look good and I like it
4.0,Nice size . Backround is more burgandy than the red I was hoping for.  Fast shipping
4.0,"Bloomers are cute, but the straps are built long so need to be adjusted. The floral romper is cute, but the fabric is heavyweight and shiny. Not what I would have chosen had I known."
4.0,"This fit my son great. He is 1. The only thing I’m not a huge fan on, is you cannot play in the snow with them. The gloves get soaked so fast."
4.0,I wear size 12 and my wife wears a petit 6.  We can both wear them.  Excellent buy for the price
4.0,"a little smaller than I thought, and these are cute for my nephew"
4.0,"They're exactly as described and what I expected. Only complaint is that they're not balanced on the hanging point, so they're constantly turning and almost falling out. Otherwise they're pretty perfect!"
4.0,Was nice...like
4.0,"Its like a perfect size but, it's a little to short and wide."
4.0,"I'm usually between a size XS and S depending on the brand. I definitely should've ordered the S because this runs a little short. The straps on this adjust, but if you have a long torso, you might want to size up. I don't even have a long torso and I extended my straps to the full length, but it still gives me a huge wedgie. I like the soft fabric and the color is beautiful. I'd buy this again in a different color and will make sure to order the S next time."
4.0,"Slim fit, feels a bit snug."
4.0,Serves the purpose i get tired of carrying a huge purse now i only take what i need not the kitchen sink!
4.0,Love them. I got the rose gold ones. They were everything I thought I was getting. Got to my house way faster than it said
4.0,"I got the orange one.  It is SO BRIGHT.  Like it seems like it glows. I wore it to the pool and I could hear people over a hundred yards away all like &#34;holy cow that is a bright hat that dude is wearing.&#34;  My wife was across the pool and she didn't know I was wearing it when I showed up and she gasped in shock.  I put in on later, and everyone around us was like &#34;dude that hat is freaking bright.&#34;  It's impossible not to notice how bright the orange version of this hat is.  It's cool and all, and I'll probably wear it to like '80s parties or something, but probably not good for the wedding I bought it for.  Super comfy lightweight material, though.  Could also wear to a football game where one of the teams is orange.  Or like hunting.  Seriously, it so so bright."
4.0,Like the non-slip sox ! Good quality! The delivery was later than expected.
4.0,Good looking and comfortable. I use these for driving.
4.0,The shoe has a thick comfortable sole and feels great to walk in
4.0,Love it tried it on as soon as it came and look good on..alittle wrinkles but very nice i will order another 😌
4.0,Great organizing set for luggage. I'm sharing my luggage with my two toddlers for a week vacation. And I was able to fit 7 outfits and 3 swimsuits each in the largest one. All my swimsuits and cover ups easily fit in the medium sized one with room to spare and I put 7 t shirts and a blouse in the smallest one.  The zipper was a little off track on one of them so I had to use a little care when handling it but otherwise they worked very well.
4.0,My husband likes the belt. It has a textured look rather than being smooth and flat. The buckle works without any issues. It reverses without issues too. The hardware isn't cheap-looking. After two months of use the belt holes haven't stretched out yet and all the hardware is intact. The buckle isn't too bulky in depth or height. He's used it for casual and dress pants and style-wise it works either way.<br /><br />I received a discount because I agreed to honestly review the product after using it for a while. That agreement doesn't affect my star rating or review content.
4.0,very light weight fabric.
4.0,The 3D trumpet is over 2 inches long and is as depicted in the product image. Very pleased with it and I would recommend it. The only negative is the pouch is made of rough material and is too short for the trumpet. They don't go together.
4.0,This necklace was a good buy fo rme.  I was pleased with the stones and overall style. m Nice for casual or dressy.
4.0,It's larger than it appears in the picture. I do like the watch but I have really small wrist and the band provided doesn't work for me. I'm going to try to find a regular band that can be adjust that matches the color of the watch. Wish me luck!
4.0,"Very Cute, but it arrived on December 29, and it was supposed to be a gift for an exchange Christmas party already held.  I guess I will keep it for myself. Good for the cell phone, a lipstick and a very small  money holder."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it, the pendant note with a pearl is very pretty and look real but the chain broke easy.  She pulled it a little too hard while wearing it that's why it broke maybe I can try fixing it if I get a right tool.  I did purchase it at a discount price in exchange of my honest review."
4.0,"Love the blouse, but it is a little tight."
4.0,they're very cute and definitely worth the $2. They come with 7 rings and not five. The ring with the words says futuristic mermaid which i find a little tacky but most people arent reading your rings anyway i think that and the one that is a fish or says ok or im not honestly sure are tacky the rest are beautiful though. they came within a week or two
4.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but unfortunately it just didn't flatter my body type.<br /><br />Pros - it is very soft and comfortable. I love the length and it's a very cute design. I think it would adorable on a smaller gal.<br /><br />Cons - it's very thin, it will show EVERY. SINGLE. BUMP. With shapeware, i might be able to make it work, but kind of a pain for a casual dress.<br /><br />For size reference, I'm 5'4, 180 lbs, size 24/16 pants, large/XL tops. I ordered this in a large and it fit as expected. Not skin tight, the perfect relaxed fit. Just not flattering for my body type"
4.0,"These are very cute, but I ordered according to the sizing chart listed with them, and they are very tight thru the hip area. I am on the curvy side tho. I have to wear a belt, as they gap a bit in the waist. That is not unusual for me tho. I think they were designed for someone with less curvy hips and bum."
4.0,It Smelled when I opened it but a quick wash solved that. It fit perfect and is really soft. By touch its apparent the fabric is mostly synthetic materials. Over all very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"I 5’5”, 140#, size26 waist and the size small fit good. Flattering dress, nice material!"
4.0,This size runs 1 to 2 sizes smaller.  Fabric is very nice.  I did not really tell how it fit/tailoring because the size was so off.  But they seemed quite well made surprisingly.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7bee3e80d2cc27aa30b3896a1ee142d]]I believe this outfit only comes in one size and while it's a beautiful and sexy piece of lingerie, it is not one size fits all. I'm about 5'2 and I'm a women's size 12 and this was just a little too small for me.<br /><br />This goes on like a jumpsuit so it's very form fitting and I just had a little too much form. That's a nice way of saying that I'm still a little too chubby for this, so I would say if you're larger than a size 8 this may not be your size.<br /><br />Now, if you are the right size, this is a beautiful well-made lingerie outfit. It's all lace and the lace is super soft and it's definitely a sexy little outfit. The straps are totally adjustable and since it doesn't really have cups it should fit any bust size as well.  The little bow is a really cute touch and I’m a big sucker for cute touches. I do recommend this if it's your size and style.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,Fits nice looks good!
4.0,"I use this bag to wash my bore snake cleaner. It seems to hold up well, time will tell."
4.0,"Very soft material, colors not as bright as I expected."
4.0,Fit like a sac. Had to pin it in the back to form to my body more. Order down a size.
4.0,It's nice I like itand I would buy another one
4.0,Really cozy but doesn’t hold up as nicely after a couple washings.
4.0,"These are really warm and fit as expected. I especially like that they can be stretched over my heels like dancer tights. But, they pill and snag very quickly so really best used only underneath other clothing for warmth."
4.0,I love the material and fit but the pockets were a surprise. They made the dress stick out on my hips and made me look hippier than I already am. Also while walking the pockets would work themselves out. Because of those reasons I took my pockets out and am much happier. It sits smoother down my sides and I don't have to keep adjusting them. Color was just as pictured.
4.0,I really like this oversized shirt. I wear it as a jacket and it is better looking than the advertised picture. I would say that I wish the cuff part was smaller it seems to big. But overall I like it
4.0,Like the product but it did not keep its affordable pricing. It went up considerably from when I started buying them.
4.0,If you don't feel like a Saturday morning trek to the flea market is in your calendar.  May I suggest the 12 dollar dg glasses.  Remember AMazon won't let you barter for the gold painted Geneva watch.  They're good glasses at flea market prices.
4.0,"So, let me just say this to begin... THIS BATHING SUIT IS AMAZING! It literally is amazing material that seems as though it will hold up for a few years! So, I followed what some others said and ordered a size bigger. Well, I normally wear a 10/12 in the bottom and in bathing suits normally a XL in the bottom so I ordered a XXL... It is a bit big. I think I should have ordered a size smaller! LOL I have a really small waist but large legs. I just want you to get the picture so you know what sizes to order for yourself! It is so cute, it looks so much cuter in person than online!!! :D I have gifted this to a friend who absolutely loves this bathing suit and I am ordering one in my size!! If you need a great bathing suit, then this is your pick! I will say that the shipping is a bit long so make sure to order with plenty of time so that you have it when you need it of course! I will be ordering one of  these cute suits each and every year! I received this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,A bit more flimsy but also lighter than the original.  The closure does not seem as secure as the Garmin band.
4.0,"Very cute. This was for my 13 year old daughter. However, order a small as it was the smallest could get knowing the top would be too big and was prepared to do some re-sewing. Bottoms fit great but the top was huge. Had to take the whole thing apart, remove the molded cups add smaller new ones and resew... turned out great but it took 8 hours to do by hand (no way could it have been done on a machine.). Wish I'd done a before/after pic for comparison.<br />  Best guess for sizing for the small. Bottoms are an extra small and top is a 34 Large  B.<br />Color says peach and pic shows it to be a bit lighter &#34;peachy&#34; color but it's a nice bright pink (which is what she wanted) 😁."
4.0,"I bought these at a great price discounted I'm guessing bc it was so close to Christmas 🎄 last year. I had masks but as it was still Covid season but we were finally at that point where coming together was safer I wanted to have some nice ""Extras"" on hand as opposed to those disposable scratchy uncomfortable ones! It was a win-win to me bc it acted as both a safety measure as well as a cool parting gift for the guests to have to take home & reuse 😉<br />I loved that they also came with their own filter already so they were a complete safety set!<br />The size is the ONLY issue I ran into as most of my guests were smaller to average women & maybe 2 men. As for the fit I found the men absolutely loved them & both commented on how great & comfy they were compared to the masks they've had that were all tight & almost too small.<br />These are definitely perfect for the men & women that need a larger mask to fit comfortably.<br />As for the smaller women I gave to they had a VERY hard time keeping it up & fitting close to the face as recommended by the medical professionals.<br />So to sum this up, great quality & love the inclusiveness of it being a full set but probably would be best for those with the need for larger masks 😷<br />If that is you ir someone your buying for then this is a fantastic purchase!<br />Stay safe everyone & Happy Holidays🎄🎅🏼☃️❤❄🧣📯🎁🦌"
4.0,"The shirt fit shorter than expected and had loose seams. After one wash, the bottom was unraveling white a bit."
4.0,Great quality for price. Very stylish
4.0,It was an okay blouse.
4.0,"Fits a bit too exact, makes running a bit uncomfortable. But it's good quality."
4.0,Very cute but not true to size...
4.0,These socks are very comfortable.  I wear a woman’s 11 shoes. I bought size 2xl and they were 2 sizes too big.  That’s okay because I bought them to wear around the house.
4.0,This item was ok for the price. I wanted a little something showing I'd been to Jamaica last month.
4.0,So when I think of something as being a sweatshirt I usually think thick and warm.  This isn't sweatshirt material.  It's like a pullover that is a second shirt.  I like it. The color is a vibrant purple and it looks good.  Just don't count on it to keep you warm in the dead of winter.  This is a good top for the upcoming fall and for just an added layer of protection.
4.0,I love this sunglass so much but it was smaller than I thought.
4.0,"I use these for bicycling ... they fit well, the material is not too heavy (so for spring/summer/fall only) and the colors are bright. I gave the pink ones to my granddaughter for sock day at school!"
4.0,Is pretty  !Only One of the beads was red so i had to take it off it look weird!
4.0,"I really wanted to love these. They are super soft and very cute. However they have no arch support. If I put one in, I felt like I was going to tip off the heel (the heel is inset under the sole, which makes me feel wobbly).<br />If you don’t need the arch, no bigger. I did fine these shoes to be looser than then needed to be around the foot. If you have slim narrow feet, they will be too loose after the leather stretches."
4.0,"These socks  are nice and soft even though they are 53% merino wool.  They hopefully will keep my feet a little warmer despite being fairly on the thin side.  I like that you get a variety of colors, but I wish that they came up a little higher on your leg.  They are definitely a great price at 5 pairs for $15!"
4.0,"Comfortable and stylish. Top is loose fitting with a tapered waist to show off your feminine curves. The cut out sleeves gives this top some edge and style. Soft material that feels good on the skin. I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40 D chest. Comes just down to the top of my thighs and looks great with leggings. Great piece to look great and secretly feel like you are in your lounge around clothes. I would recommend a lint roller. This has held up great through 3 washings so far and will be buying again in more colors. I was skeptical with so few reviews and the cheap price but this is a winner!<br /><br />Great brand. Hoping to find other items from them to add to my closet.<br /><br />If my review helped you, please click the helpful button. Or comment if I can answer any other questions &#60;3"
4.0,It keeps my head warm!
4.0,I like how easy it is to place on my watch. Very fashionable at work.
4.0,"Nice, water resistant bag.  Good pockets, great size.  I plan to use it at the pool with my kids."
4.0,I have a number of Eagle Creek packers but they are pricey. I needed a couple more for a long trip and decided to give this brand a try because they were less expensive. These worked fine. They are not as heavy but that is a positive for less weight in a suitcase and a negative if you want a really firm packer. I will buy these again. I have been using packers for years and don't know how you travel without them!
4.0,I got these for my mother &she seems to like them. Says they are comfortable &pretty warm but 1negative is the strings inside that get caught on your toes but you'll find that with any socks with designs unless they're double layers &lose threads in-between but then those are only good for colder months. But for socks she says they are pretty good.
4.0,"Pretty and great for the price, is a little larger than what I expected by the reviews."
4.0,"First time I wore the black ones, my toe poked through the stitching, so I'll have to mend that one. It's been too cold to try out the other ones to see if the same thing happens."
4.0,"Love this watch, every once in a while the clasp comes loose, but it wont fall off with the one piece design."
4.0,My granddaughter is thrilled with her mermaid tail and suit. She will use it for a long time as it is a little big for her right now. That's a good thing considering how fast they grow.
4.0,They are nice covers
4.0,"These fit my large head as they are similar in dimensions to an oversized Aviator.  They have a little more ""flash"" than Aviators.  The lenses are mounted in front of the frame, not inside of the frame.  The glasses seem to be high quality.  I like that the tint is not super dark so is more useful to wear in more lighting conditions in my opinion.  Recommended!"
4.0,"These shoes are beautiful and I get compliments whenever I wear them, they are a little hard around the edges so I would suggest wearing them with socks but the heel length is perfect and sturdy so they are very easy to walk in"
4.0,love it great colors great fabric  a little long had it hemmed but love the contrast of dark trim on sleeves and front opening
4.0,"I have several of these shirts. Some colors and patterns I like very much, some not so much.  Not really fond of this pattern."
4.0,I like it but the battery had to be replaced
4.0,Love the feel! But my heel hangs over the back of them and my toes don't quite reach the front. I still love them!
4.0,"These are adorable and so soft, but order up a size if you like your nighties a little roomy. I’m 135 and 5’4” and the medium just fits. Will still keep though as I just wear it to lounge in"
4.0,The earrings are very pretty and I received several compliments on them. They are larger then I expected but they work for me.
4.0,button for the waist was very hard to get threw. Hopefully it will stretch .
4.0,Fit perfect for size ordered. Lose fit as wanted! Very thin and clingy. I expected. Comfortable pjs overall.
4.0,"I like it very much, just a lil long for me."
4.0,"I ordered a size larger, cute"
4.0,Very convenient and plenty of pockets.  I loved the green color.
4.0,It was given as a Christmas gift and unsure of the user's thoughts on the product.  It is quite the novelty item and looks quite nice as well as functional.  The recipient was quite impressed with such a gift.
4.0,"The fabric is good. Being new to the brand i ordered a large to be safe and it was too big. Being in d Caribbean returning would cost me more then to recieve a new pair would be another payment in taxes, so i had them altered."
4.0,I like the dress but was little surprise at how much darker it is than the picture. I expected it to be a little more saturated. Maybe brighter greens and more prominent feathers but it was darker. Still a very cute dress and get lots of comments on it! I am a bra size 32DDD and it actually fits nicely. Not too tight or too small!
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and the material and colors are excellent. After reading many reviews saying that it runs small, I decided to order a large. I normally wear a S/M in dresses (I'm 5'5'', weigh 145 lbs. and 34B) and I'm glad I sized up. The chest area is very tight. The length and top portion of the dress are a perfect fit but my breasts are squished. I'll still wear it but without a padded bra since padding will only make it tighter. Also, as I read in another review, the zipper in the back doesn't go all the way down so getting it on/off can be a bit tricky. Otherwise, it's lovely and arrived VERY quickly!"
4.0,Soft fits my 11 year old son well he’s 123lbs
4.0,"Cool and comfortable,  a bit large but otherwise lovely."
4.0,"I hoped the material would’ve been thicker, but it’ll do."
4.0,"There's not much worse than putting on cold damp boots when you're leaving home for the morning, especially so during hunting season.  This boot dryer holds medium height boots and smaller shoes well but I found knee high rubber boots made the whole thing want to tip over. Honestly the whole thing is a little smaller than I expected it to be. The temperature setting is fixed at 42C and the dial sets the timer up to 120 minutes. It does its job well enough, but I noticed that the fan speed slows down and speeds up while it's running and that the fan rattles a bit. It's not super loud but it's probably best to keep this in the garage so you don't have to listen to it run. I'm confident that I'll get a lot of use out of this boot dryer over the coming winter and I'm looking forward to never putting on a damp boot again!"
4.0,These were exactly as I expected. We used them for a craft project and they were perfect.
4.0,Met it
4.0,"Comfortable, looks nice. Feels like it would fit someone with a larger head than me, but is not too big, or stretched out. Doesn't stay over my ears after a while, but that could be how I'm wearing it. Very nice!"
4.0,I like the design but the strap is very short. I have very small wrists and I have to wear it on the third last hole.
4.0,Looks good. Love the different colors.
4.0,Very Sexy! Love it.
4.0,nice! came in time also! had to sew it a bit because it was to loose
4.0,My godchild dress was a lil bit too big but nothing that can't be fix . Love the dress especially for the price.
4.0,These are great. The only thing is for me after a while it hurts the bridge of my nose and the rhinestones might be a bit much but overall good pair to own.
4.0,Runs large need to order another size
4.0,Looked great but it didn't fit so I returned it and ordered one larger in tall
4.0,a tad small on my normal size head 3 and 4 year olds
4.0,"Little thought across shoulder/breast area, have to pull down regularly but overall good fit."
4.0,Good quality and they work
4.0,The color is a little skewed it more of a claret red than a true red.  I love the unique design.
4.0,It is comfy and warm. Perfect for winter travel especially on a overnight flight. Feels like wearing pajamas with roomy side pockets. The long ribbon in the back is a bit of pain. I cut it shorter. Beware when using the toilet because that ribbon is too long.
4.0,Great jersey for the money.  Fits perfect.  Nicely made. Zipper pull on wrong side but not a big deal.  Highly recommended for any rider looking for an extra jersey.
4.0,The ONLY reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because one of them is missing an ear :(
4.0,Great material but a little to large my girl is 140 and 5'4 So she is kind of small but great material
4.0,Thick material but runs small. Bought the xl in carmine and a large in blue. Xl was small. Will order a xxl. 😩
4.0,I love this ring. It formed to my finger well and easily. I think its adorable and for the price its a steal! In thw picture the face is a little fatter and full and the ring its a skinnier so its no as cute as the pic but its still awesome everyone loves it!
4.0,"The material feels a little cheap and it did not wrap/fir exactly as I was anticipating. However, if you are looking for a casual addition to your wardrobe and don’t mind the minimal issues then this is a perfect cheap skirt."
4.0,Strong slippers
4.0,Love the size of the sunglasses. Just wish they were a little heavier.
4.0,Can't beat this
4.0,No buttons
4.0,"Runs really small, i usually wear a small, odered an extra extra large and still is tight at the waist.  But i love the color! And good fabric! Im 5,8 and it was at least 3&quot; longer, but prefer it long."
4.0,So far the quality seems good. The necklace is a lot shorter than I thought it would be but the engraving in the back is beautiful.
4.0,They are lightweight and fit nice. I had to return the first pair as charging wasn't working well on one shoe.
4.0,It's pretty and good price for a gift
4.0,"It is very stylish but you should be too much careful about it, because there is no way to clean it and because of the bright colors it probably gets dirty soon, anyway you can not use it everyday. But for some special dating or celebration it is awesome."
4.0,Not to many holes in mask which makes difficult for breathing and it was a little more loose fit than needed but overall looked as pictured and did the job....might have to cut a slit in mouth or make nose holes bigger if wearing for extended period next time
4.0,"Very good vintage collection of pieces. Are good until now, almost a year later."
4.0,"Shipment arrived on time, very soft and comfortable shoes, the paint has a little crunch when you look closer, but overall is great!  Very cute, same as picture."
4.0,Fashionable and effective!
4.0,Wife loves the dress...
4.0,Love these dresses!! Super cute and comfy
4.0,The fabric was very soft to the point of being too soft and easily stuck to my mouth and lips.
4.0,I love the style of this coat but it does run small. I am a size 10/medium but I got an extra large because of the reviews and I'm glad that I did. It fits me well and is quite warm.
4.0,Read the reviews that said to order a size up so I did and the product was too big so I would say go with your actual size.<br />For reference I’m 5ft tall and normally wear a medium but I ordered a large.
4.0,"The best thing is the price! The lens doesn’t look like the image much and is way more pink.  You can clearly see the eyes through the goggles.<br />The lens is so clear and crisp, the details are very vivid through it. The fit is very comfortable on the face. The cushioning feels good and there’s no air gap anywhere. Feels snug. I have a smaller face shape and it fits perfect. Work on my Salomon helmet with no gap, which I was hoping for!<br />Overall great buy. Would’ve preferred if they were a bit more reflective/mirror , but very happy with my new goggles."
4.0,"It's a very nice head, but it certainly isn't adjustable."
4.0,I liked it a lot but i would size up it was a little small!
4.0,"I’m 5’8”, 105lbs normally, 32C  and wear XS/S,  I’m 9 months pregnant but it looked stretchy enough so I still ordered the small. The top part was too lose to stay up on my lil tiddies and was only knee length lol but it would have looked really great on had it fit me properly. Ended up regifting it to my sister who is typically a medium and she loves it! Great quality."
4.0,Wear a normal 1x but since it says slimfit i got 3x and it fits well. Little too big in waist but i have big arms so i needed the big one. Good quality. Crisp white.
4.0,"My son just had his pubescent growth spurt... he is fairly tall, but very thin... he is 5'10&#34; (shifting into 5'11&#34;) and weighs a little over 115 lbs. Finding clothes has been a pain. These looked good on him and are very trendy. My female and metro friends seemed to love these on him... his father though would prefer less &#34;style&#34; to the jeans and likes basic Levis. Needless to say, these look great with a button down and adds a little oomph to his wardrobe without being over the top."
4.0,"Will greatly enhance any mask by removing all real facial features underneath. Almost no visibility in low light conditions (like in a Halloween party at night). Use in the day, at night you will need a cane and a dog to walk around. Comfortable though."
4.0,"Cute little spoon that works for what I needed. However, it's plastic and feels like it could break easily. It would be better if the spoon was metal."
4.0,"This was exactly what I was looking for!! I bought these for my bridesmaids for my wedding to go with their outfits. The gold is a little more copper than a vibrant gold, but it still looks great!<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, they do kind of have a stench to them upon opening, but after a few days in the open, they are fine."
4.0,"This cuff is a very specific style, and, for the niche market that it suits, it will probably do exceptionally well. So, slightly nerdy rockers, I guess?<br /><br />It really is two things at once - bracelet/cuff and phone stand - so I'll judge them separately.<br /><br />BRACELET/CUFF: Very thick, nice material, real leather it seems (can't find &quot;genuine leather&quot; anywhere in the description, so I'm assuming) so it's pretty hardy. Doesn't seem like it would come apart, fray, break, etc. in any kind of hurry, including the fastening bolt. Speaking of which, the fact that it's re-adjustable is really nice to have, you just use a screwdriver to adjust to your size, very quick and easy. If your wrists are exceptionally small, it'll probably still feel big, but most likely won't fall off your hand.<br />That said, the material of this cuff isn't very soft. The edges aren't abrasive, but the back is definitely rough, and it's not the most comfortable thing to wear if you're not already used to wearing cuff bracelets - it's pretty bulky and would take some getting used to if you were planning to wear it often. If you're totally sold on this thing except for the rough aspect, try using a fine sandpaper and smoothing it down until it's comfortable.<br /><br />PHONE STAND: This works okay as a stand. My particular phone doesn't like landscape mode that much (the Samsung Galaxy S4), so I've been using this solely as a charging stand, not in order to use it for the screen. This cuff does NOT hold your phone vertically, even on the smallest setting, and if you were to increase the size of your device to compensate (like using a small tablet), it would simply fall over - the cuff isn't that terribly stable.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a guy (or have a guy) who wears this kind of stuff, you'll probably like having a phone stand handy at any given moment. If you're looking to try out a new style and this looks like the perfect accessory for your neo-geek/pseudo-rocker affectation, then sure, go for it. It's a pretty high-quality leather cuff.<br /><br />However if you're looking for a phone stand first and foremost, and like the idea of having it be a cuff secondly, you'll probably want to look for a more functional stand.<br /><br />(This product was provided to me at a discount in return for my unbiased review.)"
4.0,"These yoga pants are better than what I expected. They are super soft and comfortable. They are thick enough so they aren't see through. I gave them a 4 star though because they are a little thick for my liking, so a little hot to work out in. Would be better for lounging or running every day errands. Although, they didn't slip down when I worked out which is a huge plus for me. I can't count how many yoga pants I have bought that look and feel great, but always fall down."
4.0,Comfortable and stretch
4.0,I was very pleased with the wristlet.  It was a great price for price for a quality product!  I should have gotten one for myself at the same time.
4.0,I was looking for something different. Went with the black diamonds and I am very pleased. The black diamond with silver bracket give a nice look.
4.0,Coat is very warm and comfortable with loads of pockets. However seems to run small compared to coats from Other well known manufacturers
4.0,"I love the Dirndl. It is well made and simply beautiful, as other reviewers said.  The sizing was interesting to say the least. I did the measurements and I determined a 16 was my required size. I was a bit skeptical since I usually wear a size 10. So I ordered a size 14 and a size 12. They came and even the 12 was too large. I thought I could get it altered but why spend the extra money. So then I ordered a 10. It promptly came and fit very well.  I returned the size 12 and 14.  They gave me a refund on the size 14 but not on the 12 (I returned them both in the box they were both mailed to me).  I finally figured out how to talk to a real person on Amazon and Isaac was able to help me out.  The Dirndl exceeded my expectations. The sizing was a challenge."
4.0,"I got this purse no a deal, and it is good quality for the price I bought it at. Very cute and has held up well after 2 weeks of use. Strap is definitely shorter than I am used to but I like the shorter length."
4.0,"It came on time. My only complaints are hard to clean glass, and squeaky glasses frames."
4.0,Wore to a costume party. Looked great!
4.0,"these peals looks pretty nice, my girlfriend loved them. they are a little on the cheap kind with the clasp but they work and look good. not gawty and great value they are a good investment. also i did not haev a color issue like the other person. the pearls all were pretty uniform in color and none looked black."
4.0,"My son is 6yrs old, and a 5/6 in most clothing, more a 6 on top and 5 on the bottom. I ordered the 7/8 for him, and as expected the bottoms are very long- but with the elastic ankle, he can wear them now, we roll the waist elastic over once and he's good.  Glad I got the 8 as the jacket fits PERFECT. I think the jacket might run a bit on the smaller side, while the bottoms run a bit larger. My son if very lean, and these are not 'too baggy' on him, but the elastic waist is small enough to stay up without alterations (not always the case). My son ended up wearing these for Halloween- and it's perfect as he can dress up and play hard without destroying 'his costume'.  win-win-win!"
4.0,"Would be much, much better with pockets!!!"
4.0,Great Quality Watch
4.0,"Shoes were perfect. Fit as expected, delivered sooner than expected which was great. Price and service were excellent."
4.0,"I'm very satisfied with this jacket! The fit is spot on, so is the color. It's very lightweight, which is what I wanted. Great for rainy day, or cool day!"
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot, although I need to get a medium as the large was too big.  It's a great white button down classic shirt with a bit of a twist to add a little style."
4.0,The flap on the front needs pressed or clipped down when drying but I've gotten so many comments abt how beautiful this dress is.
4.0,This is a cute and dainty bracelet. It is adjustable and fits my wrist which is a larger wrist. I wear it daily and my son who is teething plays with it and chews it and it has stood up to all of that.
4.0,"Fabric was easily monogrammed.  The lace is obviously machine made, but still nice."
4.0,I like the shirt but it runs a little small.
4.0,The skirt and color is beautiful. The waist however is very small. My waist is 36/ 1/2 and while it buttons is way to tight.<br /><br />Also the lining seems pointless.
4.0,So cute and comfortable! Want more colors!
4.0,"Remember it's a junior size, so buy accordingly.  I'm a misses small/medium, and got  a large; it fits well, but sleeves are a tad bit tight..<br />Size of it is like what is on the girl with the gray cardigan, not the aqua blue picture--hits just below the breast.<br />It's more like a T-short material.  Shipping is very fast!!"
4.0,"Elastic waist very tight. Pants fit loose everywhere else. I am 5' 4"" & weigh 148. Usual size is 12.  Bought two pair & both have very tight elastic waist. Guess someone wants me to go on diet. Pants are warm."
4.0,"I have officially converted to minimalist footwear and VFF is my brand of choice.  I ordered these because they are designated as a youth shoe and are half the price of the adult VFF.  The fit is great for the most part, a little snug between the toes with socks on....but bearable.  The only problem is that the red from the upper part of the show bled into the white sole.  I was going to return the., but figured for the price I'll keep them.  If you can find VFF in mid sizes and they're cheap...JUMP ON IT!!!!!"
4.0,Very lightweight cheap fabric. Good to drape over heavier clothes.  Looks better on than pictured.
4.0,"Purse is great<br />Please seller... Skip the free &#34;credit card holder pouch&#34;<br />So cheap,  just trying to insert a card into plastic card sleeve & they all ripped.<br />I instantly threw in trash."
4.0,"Love the feel of the material, but there is not enough stretch and I ordered my correct size. Will be sending back."
4.0,Great fit good materials but the seams are a bit misaligned
4.0,"Impressive for the price, maybe a little long, but seem to offer good support. Going on a run will be the real test."
4.0,"Nice fit, but no real arch support, wearable for all day tho."
4.0,This tunic is pretty. The jewel tones are just what I wanted and the fit was spot on. The reason I did not give it 5 stars and question giving it 4 is because the tie dye circles land directly on the buse area like bulls eyes! It's somewhat embarrassing. I'm questioning whether I can leave the house in it! I certainly don't need to draw attention to them. I bought the 2X. I'm 5'8.5&#34; 205# Great with jeggings. The fabric is very soft and comfortable not thin or cheap.y made. It is made well.
4.0,This skirt has material that has been sewn in such a way that it gives it a puckered look all around. The inside has a lining. The band looks like a crocheted elastic band. It is a very unusual and will probably a trending skirt. The balloon effect comes from the many sewn areas in the skirt that gives it a poofy look.
4.0,"High-quality strap. No complaints. However, the buckle layout is very odd (which, I've later learned, is a normal feature on some NATO straps). The buckle is on the side/top of your wrist and there is excess strap material that you have to fold back into itself. Frankly a little too much going on for me. Still, you could cut off the extra length and be good to go. Nothing wrong with the product itself -- the design was just a little unexpected."
4.0,Clothes were not much good quality.
4.0,"Great shoe, but runs small. I usually wear a size 9 in all Adidas, and for some strange reason, these did not fit. The 9-1/2 was not available, so I risked it by buying the 10. They fit fine, very comfortable, and not too much room in the toe. These shoes are narrower throughout and shorter, so possibly you would need to move up an entire size; I think for sure at least 1/2 size. Otherwise very pleased."
4.0,It was a gift for my grandson he loved them and they fit perfect thank you
4.0,"This is a cute and colorful sweatshirt.  My daughter wanted to dress up like her favorite book character for an English Class and this fit the bill 100% - I placed a white daisy decal on the front and it was a hit.  The top is a bit on the short side - but it wears well - is light weight - fits a bit on the large side, and washes perfectly even after a dozen washes."
4.0,So it has a wire on the brim to make it go upwards like the picture but it still keeps a weird shape overall. It's more petal shaped than sun hat
4.0,"good quality, meets my expectations"
4.0,3x will work good for this giant Scandinavian.
4.0,"Really nice shoes but run narrow and small, even for the wides. Could possible stretch out in time, but I didn't keep them."
4.0,"The material isn't the best but it's light, not itchy as some have said, and it's something you could wear multiple ways... Not too bad for the price! ;)"
4.0,I love Anne Cole swimsuits.  I own 5 right now and truly enjoy wearing wearing each one.  This is the first one I have had to repair after about 5 wearings.  The straps came unsewn at the back and I had to do some fancy stitching to get them fixed.  Nothing major but I was lucky I was swimming with someone that could  tie a knot in the back for me when it happened!!! Lol!
4.0,Fits good. Hair doesn't get messed up as much.
4.0,I love it even if it is a bit large.  Great seller fast shipping
4.0,Very nice dress. Love it and so does my husband!
4.0,"I have the legend medium short sleeve and the large fit similar to the medium short sleeve. Kinda weird, but I enjoy the shirt the sizing is just a little off."
4.0,"I liked the look and users it for my car, house, and mailbox keys. Part was not durable."
4.0,The size is nice where with a short or long chain.  The Pearl is a beautiful white that goes well with the silver.
4.0,Cute and awesome skirt but didn't fit as i wanted
4.0,Soft  cushiony but outer lip by hell hits button of foot.
4.0,"This is the fourth crown I've ordered for our king. I had to return the others. They were too obviously artificial or pretend-like or too small. The Queen's crowns I have ordered have all been very good quality, good weight, and felt very realistic. The king's crown, not so much. But this one at least fits (24cm/7.8in) in diameter and has an inner lining for comfort. I would like for it to be heavier for more substance, given the pricier cost compared to the queen's crowns (all of which were great quality).  I will continue to look for a crown worthy of our king."
4.0,"Me encanta el color y estilo,  solo la tela es muy fina y la esperaba más gruesa."
4.0,Really nice material. Soft and cozy.
4.0,"Shrinks after a wash so order a little larger. Nice shirt, soft and looks great!"
4.0,"For the price, this band is nice. It is comfortable and it looks good. The band came ‘backwards’ & had to be switched. However, not even 4 months into wearing this and the color is coming off the inner wrist area and the two little slide pieces that hold the band down are completely cracked and colorless. This happened with a prior band I had as well so I think you get what you pay for. Expect 3-4 months out of these types of bands when worn 24/7."
4.0,Cute necklace. Quality is ok considering the price
4.0,Order a size up and don't put in the dryer. The fabric was thinner than another one I have in the same brand.
4.0,"I gave it four instead of five stars for two reasons.  One, the straw was not as stout as my last Stetson.  Two, it fits just a little large (where my old one was a little small-which is why I went for this size).  The price was great and that hat is just as stylish."
4.0,"My only beef is that they are quite short. Barely to my wrist, and I have normal man hands. This can make them a bit tricky to get into under pressure as well."
4.0,Good quality tho a tad large...
4.0,I believe the sizing chart is off.  According to my measurements I should order a medium which I did.  Little snug in the chest area.  Ended up returning and irdering a large
4.0,super cool famous people glasses.  also love the case it came in.
4.0,"This is a really cute shirt...I ordered large, and should've ordered med., as is my regular size.  Washed and then dewrinkled in dryer a short time...wrinkles mostly came out.  Nice buy."
4.0,"Love the concept and it looks super cool.<br />Unfortunately, or fortunately, we haven't had enough rain lately to try it out!<br />Soon I'm sure with spring coming."
4.0,At first we thought these would be too small but when my 10 yo put them on from the back rather than the front they were good. I still wish they were a touch bigger but she says they feel fine. She needs them to block out classroom noises when she is trying to concentrate. They don't completely block sound but muffle it. She recommends them. :)
4.0,"Cute shirt, expresses how most of us feel at the moment and gets a laugh every time I wear it. I’m usually a perfect size large and I could’ve taken a medium in this shirt."
4.0,Certainly cute and wasn’t expecting a lot. But the wires inside as SO THIN the ears barely stand with movement. Would it really cost that much more to use a LITTLE stronger material inside?
4.0,"This dress is adorable, but be warned - it is bright pink, not red like in the picture."
4.0,"this head band stays in place for sure. I play basketball and  on more than one occasion have had it come out of my hair while running down the court, this one dosn't. IT STAYS PUT! I don't have to worry about it at all. Thank You"
4.0,I love these pants but I purchased a small and I still feel the fit could be slightly tighter around the leg and maybe an inch shorter at the bottom. I'm 5'7&#34;. I think I'm still going to keep them though because they are cool and you will stand out in them
4.0,"It's great quality, feels super heavy and well made, however sizing is very difficult and a large is too short on me and i'm 5,3 110lbs. I still give it a 4 star review because it shipped on time and the quality is awesome!"
4.0,The material in this dress was like wearing a cloud. So soft and didn’t wrinkle.
4.0,More than I imagined
4.0,"I really like the color of this beanie and the material is high quality, but it does fit a little small.  It is supposed to be a slouch style beanie and it was just too small for me to wear it as such.  Luckily it still looks really cute when worn fully.  Definitely very warm and I received a lot of compliments on it.  Just a little upset that it was smaller than expected but I will still definitely buy this in other colors.  Overall good quality product."
4.0,This is a nice casual top for the summer its lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,Great colors and true to size.  A little thin and see-through.
4.0,Was not as nice as expected
4.0,"I ordered this jacket but returned it.  The fit is ""as expected"" if you do take your measurements and follow their chart, with one exception.  As some other reviewers have noted the sleeves are tight, cut slim.  Otherwise it is a good jacket, pretty much as described.  The reason I returned it is that  the description on the product page says it's ""Casual Gray"" and the picture looks gray to me.  But the one I received was brown.  I looked closely at the product page and sure enough in small print it said ""color brown"" with no drop down menu or other choice option.  So I returned it.  Too bad, if the color had been what I expected it would have been 5 stars.  I'm 5'5"" 145 lbs. and took a  ""US M / 39""."
4.0,Smaller than i thought theyd be but so far i likr em!
4.0,"The dress is very flattering and form fitting. The waist is ruched so it can obscure a little belly. It is quite long though, if you’re on the shorter side, the bottom will drag on the floor. Model’s size description is spot on. I am 5’7” 135lb and the dress is less than an inch shy from ground.<br /><br />Overall very happy with purchase; material quality is decent. Will buy other dress from this brand."
4.0,Appears to be well made
4.0,"For some reason the review options for this product come up as if they are shoes so I can't answer all the questions since this is an eyeglasses case :). I can say the case is sturdy and protects my oversized sunglasses very well. Measure your frames very carefully (width, depth, height) because the measurements listed online are right on the money - there's no fudge factor."
4.0,"Just got mine. Love the full long skirt. I'm 5'4&#34; and will probably have to hem it but much prefer that to it being short.  Nice fabric with a beautiful flow. Love the sleeves BUT with the top part off the shoulders, the armpit is half way to your elbow and with it up on the shoulders, the neckline is way to high and not flattering. I will probably keep and alter it as there's much that I love about it. Also I'd say it's on the larger side. I got the S/M and a really small woman would find it way too big. Someone who usually wears M/L would probably fit fine in the S/M"
4.0,"I ordered a size down, so it was perfect!"
4.0,"The top fits a bit smaller ,so size one up other than that I love them the quality and the softness of the material is wonderful."
4.0,nice and different
4.0,The anklet looks very nice. I tried a few and thought anklets were just not my thing but not every shoe fits right?
4.0,The layout was a little wonky but I love the weight and the feel of the necklace.
4.0,I'm about 6'2&#34; and 160lbs. They fit well enough but I think I should have gone with a Large. I buy extra small every chance I get but there's no shame in ordering a large Asian.
4.0,The only down fall is that they have no shape at all to them...no curve to the lenses...
4.0,This is exactly the small size of purse I wanted!
4.0,IT IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE.
4.0,Socks do as advertised but easy on and off not so much. Typical compression socks. I have several different brands and lengths. These are ok for me for about 6 hours then the top band is cutting into my leg just below the knee cap. I drive a school bus and these do help out with my leg pain.
4.0,I’m about 105 pounds and 4”11. I ordered small and It fits perfectly. The dress looks exactly as pictured. It has a flattering fit and is an appropriate- but cute- length and style. The zipper at the back is broke that was a big disappointment but I can easily just put it together.
4.0,The compression and fit is good.  The only thing I don't like is the stay up top is a bit tight and will leave red marks on my skin. Hoping that this softens up a bit..  Other brands I have gotten have a smooth stay up surface while this one isn't and leaves dot marks on the skin.
4.0,Looked great on my son.
4.0,"Cute, but broke quick"
4.0,"Very cute, light summer dress. Fits great! I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it has a 4 inch insewn seam under arm.  But love the dress so its worth sewing it myself"
4.0,I would definitely size up because it runs small. I usually wear a medium/large and ended buying an XL and it fits me like a large would. Just a bit loose.  It is soft and does keep me warm. I like this sweatshirt. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that the sleeves are a tad short. When I raise my arms they do go up a little to much for my liking. I like my sleeves to stay at my wrist and/or sometimes a bit longer. Overall this sweater was a pretty good purchase.<br />Also! The front doesn’t have much stretch to it because of the picture on the front. The rest of the sweater is more “roomy”.
4.0,Nice wallet and holds all of my cards but leather is stiff and tough so it takes a bit of effort to get a credit card out. Compact so it fits well in a small purse.
4.0,It's nicely made and he sent me a free pair of ears to match.
4.0,Really liked the design on the band. Was a bit stuff and hard to attach.
4.0,Pricey!  My husband purchased these for me for Christmas.  The work great on our hikes (it gets cold in SoCal every now and then) and during our winter trips to Utah.  North Face does not disappoint.  I also like the pink writing :)
4.0,My house was nice work good but the lights were easily to be broken on the eyes
4.0,Wish two pair
4.0,"I really like this, it fits well and makes tank tops and other shirts that have low neck lines look fun and different."
4.0,It's a lot bigger than i thought it was gonna be but its very cute!
4.0,"i like them, a bit big but besides that it's great"
4.0,"I really thought this would be a heavier weighted sweatshirt. Very light weight material, more suitable for chilly summer night rather than fall or winter. It's design is cute, the colors were as shown. I found sleeve length perfect hitting just past the wrist, body length was great too. I found the shirt to be tight fitting thru waist and hips. Purchased XL as I wanted it to be roomy. So 1 star lost for fit."
4.0,"They fit well, and more importantly work well."
4.0,"loved it, however, it is way too see through to be worn as a dress"
4.0,Great socks! Feet don't slid out of shoes when doing planks or hovers when doing my Core Class at the health club.
4.0,"Good value, all fit well with exception of one pair."
4.0,"I’m usually a size 7, but sometimes I need a 7.5. With that being said, I ordered the 8 and they’re a little too big. As someone else mentioned, it seems a little tight at the top of my food but otherwise I love them!"
4.0,"This was my first Coach purchase. Lots of their purses/bags I don't like because they've got stupid pockets on them and look like granny bags, but this one is different looking. It's classy, sleek, sophisticated and not gaudy at all. The bottom is a beautiful chocolate brown suede with the C's over it. There are a couple of pockets inside the purse, one with a zipper. The purse is the perfect size: not too big or small. I'm very picky with purses and it takes a lot to impress me. This purse sure does!"
4.0,It's pretty but a little juvenile for me.Will give to grand daughter.
4.0,"Looks like pic, material is odd"
4.0,Good cotton material. Cute hoodie.
4.0,"These ended up being too large for my son, hence the 4 versus 5 stars. But they are decent quality and fit me! Would recommend for a larger kid (he’s 3) or adult with slim neck/small face."
4.0,"My daughters LOVE these hats. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the string that goes under the chin keeps coming off. They have them attached only by sticking the ends through the material (which has that clear nylon thread running through it), and then tying a knot in the ends. Well, the knots slip out with only the slightest tug! So I'm having to hot glue gun the strings in place (or you can just take them off, if your daughter doesn't like them. Mine prefer them, though.) Also, the decorative string that goes around the base of the hat, right above the rim, is only held on by some hot glue in the front where the flower is, and it flops around a lot, so I'm also going to glue gun the string down in the back, too. It's not a deal breaker for me, as these hats are really cute and are perfect for my girls. (They're 2 1/2 and 3 1/2, but will fit them for several years easily.) For the price, it's definitely worth it! (I also got 4 different colors. I was worried that I might get several or all the same, since it said that &#34;colors vary&#34;, but they were all unique, which was nice.)"
4.0,"Small, but works for my smaller purse!!  There is quite a bit of inside space though."
4.0,We used it for travel and it served its purpose!
4.0,"Very disappointed! My wristlet is broken after only two weeks of moderate use.<br /><br />UPDATE: Befen was kind enough to send me a replacement free of charge. I received the item quickly and it was the same thing I ordered before. I am trying to refrain from carrying the full weight of the wristlet with just the wrist strap. I am holding it in my hand instead. Still not the best quality, but great for the price. I will be looking to purchase something else soon."
4.0,Good quality material but a bit small. I would order a size bigger. Super cute and bright colors.
4.0,A bit see through and I ordered a large as I like it oversized when I’m usually a medium. It fit the way I like it.
4.0,"The chain is a little stiff, and the clasp is not very durable.  But it is a very attractive anklet for day wear.  I wouldn't trust the clasp to hold during a lot of activity."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, very well made - great fabric and the skirt is lined too. Well worth the money - BUT - I ordered the xl 'cause the size chart said the waist would fit up to a 42"" waist - that's a lie unless we're talking about a balloon! I have a 35"" waist ( I re-measured it to make sure before I wrote this ) It just fits me, and that's very VERY tightly! You MUST order this lovely item one size up or plain on holding your breath all the time you're wearing this skirt! Don't get me wrong - it's lovely - I'm sending it back and re-ordering a larger size - which I wouldn't bother to do if it wasn't so nice - but I am... So save some time and frustration and order the bigger size from the start! By the way, I'm 5'7"" and this skirt was long enough that it covers my ankles and doesn't drag on the ground - the length is perfect!"
4.0,The white area is more of a cream color but the red is right period I bought this in a2x and I am 5 feet 4 inches and a half tall period I weigh 220 and my boob size is 36 Double D this shirt goes to a couple inches below my Jean button and drapes and the front really nicely like it does on the model in the picture. And I am a fairly large person I have a large baby bump in front and it covers it. my only complaint would be that the sleeves are a little bit long for me at a2x but I feel if I had won an extra large it would have been too short in the stomach area. It also does not showed in the picture but it is ribbed so if that does not bother you then I would suggest buying it
4.0,I purchased this as a gift and they have not received it yet so I'm not sure how they'll like it.<br />I personally think it's really cute and if you're a dog lover (like I am) it's a great conversation piece.
4.0,"Cute top. Silky material. It didn’t flatter my body shape so I returned it. Pattern was also a bit outside my comfort zone, but was still cute."
4.0,It's an alright hat.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:72ba9393f3f639d4966d38c865e0b438]] I got a Large. I’m 5’9 and 145lbs. It’s super itchy so I wouldn’t recommend wearing without long sleeve underneath. Soft on the outside. The length of the sleeves are good and I have long arms. I just wish it was a little longer and less wide. No idea if it will shrink.
4.0,Title says it all. Recommend these shorts. Good quality lasted well in wash but hard to put the draw string back in so be mindful when washing.
4.0,Wear it everyday but did break eventually but still super cute just don't tug on it like i did... : (
4.0,Fit great and price was affordable
4.0,Ibought it for me but it fit my mother so she kept it.So all in all it worked out.
4.0,"My dog is 14lbs.  I orderd the Medium and it is tight on him.  I would go the next size up.  Other than that, it's really cute on him"
4.0,Good fit and comfortable but went with a different vest- blue was the color I needed!
4.0,great novelty item very pretty
4.0,"I'm 34 D, 128 lbs.5'5. It fit fine but didn't love the design, it looks better in pictures, returned it."
4.0,Not as soft as we hoped
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, the name plate is very large. I’d prefer smaller font but it’s still cute, might turn it into a key chain."
4.0,The belt is easily and almost infinitely adjustable strap has a little stretch to it which is nice.
4.0,Very cute. Worked well on my 19 month old. Did start to wear in the toe after a week at the beach.
4.0,"I really like the details on these boots! They also have a lower heel, which I like, and a 14&#34; shaft, which works well with the height of my legs. EU 40 is about equivalent to a US size 9, but I found it's a tad bit on the larger side, even when wearing thick wool socks. The part of the boot around the ankle is also a little looser than appears in the photo (notice how it appears more tapered above the ankle buckle in the photo). They still look very cute and I plan on keeping them. The shaft is also semi-insulated inside, which is great for this time of year."
4.0,It fit well. The only issue is that they called the color red and it’s clearly pink. No problem for me but if someone was looking for red they might be disappointed
4.0,"Muy lindo y cómodo,  me encanta!"
4.0,It’s really nice and jewelry.for that price that’s really surprising!Looking forward for more of such nice product.
4.0,"I'm 5' tall, short waisted and about 168 pounds and the large fits true to size. I normally wear a size 12 in pants. They are a little long on me so I roll the bottoms of the legs under or they kind of gather at my ankles. The design is nice you have a pattern and then a partial see through panel which gives it a little style instead of being another pair of black yoga pants. The leggings are comfortable and hold my Mommy tummy in now that I'm 6months postpartum.  These have a nice stretch, do not show imperfections or have a shear effect upon bending over. The only reason for 4 stars is no pocket for cell phone added."
4.0,Love this shirt. Just wish it would have been longer.  Thank you for the amazing price and fast shipping
4.0,Beautiful but it does snag your clothes thus the 4 stars
4.0,"Bought medium & large based on reviews.  I normally wear a medium in sweat/track pants.  Large size runs quite large and I returned the large, keeping mediums."
4.0,"Nice material, has some stretch. The sleeves are attached low on the bottom making it pull across the chest a bit but I'm small with a 32 E so everything is tight in the chest for me. I'm 5'3&#34;, 135 and I ordered the large (because of the chest area). It's still short enough, hitting a couple inches above the knee and is cute and comfortable. Loose fit like on the model."
4.0,"Had to get it altered, shortened and the armholes made a little smaller. Beautiful dress, worth the extra money to have it altered."
4.0,"My son wears size 7 so I bought size 8 for him, but when I put this pair on he said hurt. But other than the size, this is such a cute shoes, very soft as well!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, but a little bit longer than I thought it would be. Came almost all the way down to my ankles. I do love this dress though."
4.0,"This isn't one of my mid-range Bulovas or my high-mid Omega Seamaster or Speedmaster. In fact, I spent less than $30 on this somewhere else. It isn't perfect (has 40 days on the calendar? Dufuq?) nut it keeps OK time (adjust every 2 or 3 weeks for the gained minute), all the functions work, and it only needs winding if I forget to put it on a winder for a whole day (does fine overnight on my dresser).<br /><br />This is great for work where it might get banged up (my Bulova Marine Star has seen better days). It also has a look that works well with dressier attire so if you are going to some dress event that may be more active (riverboat cruise comes to mind), instead of taking an expensive $3000 watch (or even a $300 Citizen eco-drive), this will work just fine.<br /><br />What impresses me most is the subdials and controls all work as they should. I've seen some cheap knock-offs like this where the subdials are decoration only. They don't even have real hands and they have buttons that are molded into the casing. This is much higher quality than those yet sell for under $50."
4.0,"Great inexpensive duffel bag for the gym, it’s not as durable as I expected but still a great bag."
4.0,"It's a mixed review, it fits great and is of good quality BUT it is sooo short I cannot wear it outside my bedroom. It is literally not covering my bottom. If you are any taller than 5'6"" DON'T buy this if you aren't wanting to show everyone your goodies"
4.0,A good general pair of sunglasses.<br />The super dark part refers to the frame not the lenses.
4.0,I really love this suit but the length is way too short for me. I am soooo disappointed.
4.0,Very thick socks. Haven’t washed yet so can’t attest to quality.
4.0,"Good quality, light weight.  Fit is tts. Bought a medium and I'm a dress size 8, 36C bra."
4.0,"Since the loss of my mother in law and son, my husband collects crosses. I took the opportunity to order this for a Christmas gift for him. This item is awesome. It comes with small black velvet feel bag for storage. It's made with stainless steel and comes with a ball chain. Though I noticed that the cross is rough on the edges so I wouldn't recommend this for smaller children. That's the only drawback!<br /><br />* I received this item at a discount for my honest review.*"
4.0,"Very attractive as advertised. My daughter in law really liked them, especially because their son's name is Orion"
4.0,"Cute, gets dirty. Durable chain"
4.0,"My fiancee likes these tanks especially working in the plants in the summertime, he gets a little extra protection from the &#34;man sparkly&#34; = Sweat! (my wording not his) He also likes, they don't move around whilst he's working, we got them long enough to tuck into his pants so he doesn't have to adjust it throughout the day. As an added bonus it also helps to hold everything in place without being uncomfortable if you have a little &#34;fluff&#34; around your tummy too. xo"
4.0,"My daughter wanted to use this cape as part of her Halloween costume.  It came un-hemmed, which would have been nice to know.  My daughter is 5'6&#34; so the length left her with about 4&#34; pooling at her feet when she had it on and tied.  It is a good weight, not super heavy but not see-thru either.  The hood is large, designed to pool a little in the back (good if you have long hair)."
4.0,"Bought 4 of these. They were beautiful, comfortable, and fit perfectly. How ever, one had a seam that was ripped apart when it arrived. They don’t seem durable for a lot of wear And are cheaply made but are great for a special occasion."
4.0,"UPGRADRD REVIEW;  I have changed my review to 4 stars because their customer service is excellent and they fixed the problem I was having with the glasses falling off.  For me, one of the tints is too dark since I need more light for my low vision while outdoors. The other tints are very good!<br /><br />The glasses are VERY large.  They slide down my nose and fall off.  There is no possible way to wear them.  Good concept and I wish they could be ordered in a smaller size and with different frame options.  So disappointed as I was really looking forward to using them!"
4.0,The dress fits fine but it is a little bit cheap looking.
4.0,Sizes seem to run a little large. I had to exchange for a size smaller. The quality seems good. I haven't worn it yet. I would recommend this item.
4.0,Love the quality of the material. I ordered a (m) and had a hard time getting it over my back and hips. Hahahahaha. Once I did it looked amazing.
4.0,"The wait goes well above the belly button, so they're like SUPER high rise. Otherwise they're comfy and fit great!"
4.0,"The only bad thing that I could say about this product, is how it snags on things like clothing, and how it was labeled. Labeled as in the sizes were all together in one pouch and it was confusing with the smaller gauges to distinguish size 16 and size 14. They look identical. For a week I was wearing a miss-match pair."
4.0,I usually wear large but had to return the large size and buy these.  They fit ok but the elastic is a little tight.  Good value for the money.
4.0,"Loved the color, it was very fitting"
4.0,"The size chart is very confusing but the garment is great.  I was the one who asked the question below about what exactly is being measured, the person or the garment?  The seller answer was that the chart reflects the garment lying flat which makes sense but that still doesn't really tell you how much stretch there is to fit what sized person.<br />I took a chance and ordered the XL (I normally wear about a 12-14 in jeans) and it fits great.  The wide waistband is nicely shaping and smoothing and the fabric is thick enough to not be see through but thin enough to breathe."
4.0,"Super soft and good fit and construction.  The only thing is, the &#34;shirttail&#34; portion had too much fabric and was wierd.  So I cut it off! :) All better and I like it much better"
4.0,Love these shoes. Comfortable. Non slip. Matches many outfits. Easy to get on and off
4.0,My daughter absolutely loved these!!! The only bummer thing is the bows on top came off.
4.0,"I purchased a medium.  I'm 5'2""  and this sucker was about a foot too long.  I mean it went all the way to the floor and then I had about a foot of extra fabric to stomp around on.  but I have a sewing machine so it wasn't hard to hem.  Waist is just a little tighter than I like but that's because I need to do more cardio and less bread.  It's pretty though.  I gave it four stars because I had to bust out my sewing machine.  Other wise very pretty dress at a great price."
4.0,"Have an apple watch? This set contains three replacement straps -- woven metal bands that secure using a magnetic catch. This is similar to the one that apple sells called the milano loop strap. At first I was a bit hesitant to trust my apple watch to a magnetic catch. I was worried it wouldn't be secure enough. I didn't have to worry. The magnet holds it very securely and is easy to adjust. I like it far better than the silicone bands which gave me skin irritation. Also, this is endlessly adjustable so whether you have a large or very small wrist (like me) it will fit. The set comes with three bands - silver, rose gold and black.  I got it for the silver primarily as that is the color of my watch case, but the rose gold and black worked well too. You can't go wrong with this set. Easy to install as well."
4.0,"For about $40 these are pretty good, certainly cheaper than a pair of replacements.  However, in my Revo Otis the right lens rattles in the frame.  The left is fine, so I'm not quite sure what the deal is here.  Getting the old lenses out is a bit of a pain, installation is much easier.<br />It may be hard to see in the pic, but the replacements are a bit thinner than the outgoing Revo lenses.  I may try putting a dot of super glue at the corners, but overall, I probably wouldn't buy these again.  If it didn't take like two weeks to get them, I may have considered trying a replacement, but I don't feel like taking our the new lenses putting back the old ones, boxing 'em up, blah blah blah.<br /><br />Added a star, they were good for about two years until wifey wore them and scratched them up. Rattle went away, probably filled in with some filth. Gonna buy another set because it is still cheaper than a new pair of sunglasses and I like how the Revos fit."
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I bought a gray one first, I didn’t really like it very much but I read some reviews that said that different colors were different material so I looked at it again and ordered a red on that was rayon, it came and it was flowy and loose fitting which was what I wanted. I wear it all the time. From now on I will pay attention to the material before purchasing."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:46ee9e9c8b7338716296c22e8008600a]] See the video for the construction quality. They fit as expected after I put them on. They fit like a light weight stretch leotard. It is a close fit. Don't expect the ""compression"" to smooth out back rolls or anything like that. It reveals what's really there. For yoga it holds its placement well. It won't flip up over my head and it does hold over my belly, rather than roll up to the thinnest part of my waist. Overall, for the three pack, it was worth the money."
4.0,"I love this belt! I was afraid it was going to be small but to my surprise in fits perfectly! I'm 5'6&#34; around 150lbs. a little on the chubby side not going to lie lol. It laye nice to camoflauge a little bump which is great! Quality is good for the price, came in a pretty black velvet drawstring bag, nice touch!"
4.0,Another Christmas gift for a friend.  She loved it.  Looks better than the picture.
4.0,"After reading some reviews about sizing, I purchased and xl. I’m a 34 waist, 5’9” and 190 lbs. I think the large would’ve fit fine. The xl fits but was a bit long."
4.0,"Lightweight, soft, warm. Just as described"
4.0,"Love it, but it's hard to get the cards out they go all the way down in the slots and makes it hard to get stuff out"
4.0,very cute-unfortunately it came loose and I lost the top ball...I am very hard on belly button rings..good thing is that any ball from some of my other rings will work too...lucky I could find the owl piece
4.0,The strap broke after a couple of years but the watch still works great.
4.0,Very nice like the sparkle
4.0,Nice large bag
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5de6bea54ea08b21075e0efc02ce2eff]] I like the fit of this product. I had a tummy tuck after I had my twins and it covers those scars nicely. It is a little snug on the booty but I’ve never had a small bum. Hopefully the video will show how it fits all around. I am 5’6, 134-137lbs, and I bought a med."
4.0,"i got the largest size avalable and with my 13 feet they barely get on/off, recomend going up a size with these"
4.0,"Good shoes , brought for badminton.  Work in indoor ground"
4.0,I really like this dress however.I had to send it back from a size large to xtra large because it was difficult to put it over my head because of the front v neck. I am planning to order it again in the red.
4.0,The coverage is nice for both tops and bottoms. I am wearing a large in this. There is some padding in the top. The top fits well however I could probably size up. I am a 34DDD to give an idea of fit.
4.0,the chain was thinner than expected and so was the charm but I love it my mother fell in love with it so I gave it to her and order another for me.<br />I have been wearing it for about 4 days now and I forget I have it on me until I get complements form my friends.
4.0,I found out that I don’t like self winders. Have to reset every time I wear because I have other watches solar & quartz. live & spend & learn.
4.0,"They are a tad bit big for my 4 year old but it's fine she can grow into them. She is a size 9. We purchased a size 10.<br />Super cute, durable."
4.0,"The material wasn't what I expected but it fit nicely. Sorry, I only had a selfie!"
4.0,taking a trip out of the country so I will see how good these tags work. Not sure I can review them yet.  I do like that they are easy to attach to the suitcases and ease of registration.
4.0,"I really like the bag and it will be really handy on my vacation.  I wish the color was more subdued, but still pretty."
4.0,"These pants are great for work. The fit is good, just a touch snug for me."
4.0,Got these for the 15-year-old who LOVES them!
4.0,The cosplay fit my sister good of course she have to get a bigger size and that’s what I did for her. But when I took it out the button fell out of the jacket so we have to sew it in together. But other than that it was good if it’s her good
4.0,Definitely OK for the price
4.0,Quality is about average. There is boning in the bra part for the effect. I’m a C cup for reference!
4.0,"I took advice from other reviewers and ordered one size up.  The fabric is light weight and airy.  It fits fine, very cute and looks in person as it does online."
4.0,"Good quality, love the color, size fits just right, everyone loves it! Order your normal size."
4.0,The bow was a little smashed and the gloves got a tiny bit snagged  but it was a cute set for my 80’s costume. You get what you pay for
4.0,"3 compartments, slots for a few cards, nice looking and practical"
4.0,"I ordered the purple one and with the description I went for ordering size M ...I was looking for a tunic top to wear with leggings and this fit perfect. It fits and looks nice, not to big and not to snug.. I will say a bit loose or flowy...I like its length because it  hides my bottom. The color is  true to the picture. The cowl neck has nice button design pattern as well. Long sleeves are nice innorder to protect from the sun as well... the material is breathable and comfy too"
4.0,"They are a great, elegant, smooth gloves, just what i wanted, and i could text and use touch-screen devices without taking them off, they fit great. But the only thing was that they aren't very cold resistant, i was hoping they would be, but I'm not complaining! I love them"
4.0,"THE BELT HAS A NICE QUALITY. THE COLOR IS THE SAME AS THE IMAGE, I LOVE THE ANTIQUE LOOK OF THE BUCKLE.THE BELT SIZE LARGE FIT A WAIST UP TO 36IN."
4.0,"I am 5’7”, 174 lbs. my measurements are 34 bust, 31 waist, 43 hips. I purchased a large and a medium. I kept the large. The dress is tight around my hips but I kept it anyway. The fabric on the top is different from the fabric used on the bottom. The bottom fabric is that slinky material where as the top is made of a soft cotton. I do wish the dress was made of the cotton fabric. The dress is not see through but it does hug. Hope this review helps you ladies!"
4.0,Very substantial! Really like the looks and feel!
4.0,"I bought these for a &#34;Breakfast at Tiffany's&#34; themed golf tournament. They are a little smaller than i remember from my childhood - but I could be wrong. Note that if you have arthritic fingers many of them are hard to &#34;pop&#34;. Otherwise, they suited the purpose well and looked nice."
4.0,Lovely pattern. Soft and silky but slippery. Having trouble getting it to stay on my head. Keeps sliding off.
4.0,"I love the feel of the material however, the zipper is a little on the flymsy side"
4.0,Would have bought a size up. Soft and my daughter is super cute in it.
4.0,"[I'm 5'6&#34; and 1.2 lbs.] I decided to get the medium, although it was a bit large, any smaller would have prevented mobility. It goes to my mid thigh. Very cute and good fabric. My bf says he likes it because it looks almost school girlish and is preppy."
4.0,Nice quality and work perfectly. Only complaint is seeing the velcro when on my head.
4.0,Very thin but they are whjat i ordered. Great price.
4.0,Cute dress! I returned because I am 5’9” and it was just too short for the occasion.
4.0,This was kind of big for me but mehhhh. it got the job done .I like it better then pasties
4.0,The product  was nice but the key ring came separated from the charm not even  a month  after  putting  it on keys.
4.0,"It is beautiful, and came faster than expected. The chain itself does feel a little fragile, but other than that it is very pretty!"
4.0,"These shirts were long enough but too narrow.  They would probably be good if you planned to wear them under another shirt instead of as I planned to wear them, as a summer, work-around-the-house shirt."
4.0,They are really nice except the tag that bothers the bottom of my feet. I had to cut the tags off.
4.0,Puts a finishing touch on all previously polished metals
4.0,"Loving it , with style"
4.0,Looks as described . Happy with it . It did take a long time to receive though .
4.0,"These shorts work great for my extremely active husband. Thought they would hit a little shorter, but they land around his knee. I love the colors."
4.0,"It's cute as heck, but it was too big for me. I ordered a 1x because I normally wear a large, but thought they looked bad on me, but I guess I overreacted?"
4.0,Once I had it taken in on the sides it looked much better The elastic is so thin it barely holds  Received many compliments Easy dress for dress up or down
4.0,Very pretty but very tiny. These work well for either a toddler or if you have 2nd and 3rd piercings.
4.0,PJs were fine but just not sure why they said “Cebra” instead of “zebra” ???
4.0,"Kinda wish they weren’t so stretchy but it there than that, really cute!"
4.0,"I bought a medium based on the measurements, I am 5'6&#34; and 170lbs I wear a size 10. It was extremely large and long. I am in the process of returning it and purchasing a smaller one. Will update my review when the smaller one arrives.<br />On another note, the dress is beautiful, material is very stretchy and the material feels good on the skin."
4.0,Product was great thank you
4.0,"I purchased the 37_dkroyal (Royal Blue mini cable knit style) and 17_white (plain knit) in size 1XPLUS.<br /><br />Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched:<br />37_dkroyal - chest underarm to underarm 18"", length shoulder to hem 24"", across hem 14""<br />17_white - chest underarm to underarm 20.5"", length shoulder to hem 24"", across hem 16""<br /><br />The knit fabric is light weight, very stretchy and quite soft with the cable knit being slightly thicker than the plain knit. The white is off white and a skin tone bra would definitely be need as it's almost semi-sheer. The cable knit runs a little small for 1XPLUS so I suggest upsizing unless you want to wear it as a fitted style. Overall they appear to be quite well made for the price, I paid $6 each after a $2 off coupon per item with free Prime shipping. They don't look particularly expensive but will make great casual light weight sweaters for early spring."
4.0,runs on the small side
4.0,very nice watch.. the only con is that to big strap.. i needed to get it shortered.
4.0,works perfect to clean suede shoes
4.0,I bought this as a gift for someone who likes red and hearts.  It looks just like the listing picture and seems like it will hold up well. I just wish it was bigger. I did read the listing for the dimensions but I do appreciate having a picture to get a better sense of scale for things like this.
4.0,Works well and gives good access to buttons that you need access to.
4.0,Somewhat small but it is a cute tank top.
4.0,"Good product - does run big. Filters stayed in place nicely. My teenage son was looking forward to using this mask; however, even with ear loops it was big for him."
4.0,"The sweat suit is cute and even met with approval from my teenage daughter.  It is a small fit; were I to order again I would order at least one size up.  I thought the openings shown were zippered, they aren't.  My daughter observed, unsolicited, that it &#34;would look cute with zippers too&#34;.  The seller was prompt and packaged for the safe arrival of the product."
4.0,"Was ugly! Laugh! I guess it was meant to be that way but son didn’t know character or like, so had to return. He had only asked for scary mask, he stated that this one wasn't scary, just ugly. Return was without issue.<br />May work for others. Quality wasn't bad."
4.0,"These googles are larger than other speedo swim goggles I have, but they seem to fit everyone in our family well, kids and adults. Adjustable and comfortable."
4.0,"Prettt bracelet, great price."
4.0,Cute and seem to be durable so far. A little more difficult to switch out then I’d like but maybe it just takes practice. Overall a good product.
4.0,"I usually wear a medium, but these are pretty fitted. Would’ve gone with a large or x-large for a baggy fit. I am 5 ft 4 inches and 145 lbs for reference. Good quality shirt though."
4.0,"Super cute and fun, but it breaks. Its fun to give to your friends, but it doesn't last forever. Just like friends.... But I would but it again if I had the money."
4.0,Hat didnt fit
4.0,This bag smells AWFUL. Like I get it. Genuine leather and all that. But omg it smells like rancid beef stew. I let it air out and it smells fine now. But omg. Great bag though. Six pockets and lots of space. The buckle is a little inconvenient but I'm sure I'll get used to it. Time will tell lol. But overall I would recommend. Just don't use it until you've left it outside for 24 hrs.
4.0,i was expecting the rock to be smaller... im not disappointed in the size for the price. but the clip that holds the rock onto the necklace is a little flimsy and snapped. i replaced it but just b aware
4.0,"Smaller then expected, but still fits."
4.0,"Not too bad a boot,  if they were 2&#34;  shorter (height) they would be perfect boots."
4.0,"I gave four stars because they are incredibly cute socks but...I put one over my arm just to see how snug they are & they barely fit I'm sure when I try to pull them over my average size calves (which I've never had to but extra wide boots ever) that they'll suffocate my blood supply...I'm thinking these socks would fit my 10 year old skinny neighbor kid perfectly...if you are an adult, I wouldn't reccomend unless you're an extremely small adult."
4.0,"These shoes run on the larger size, the toes have become quite scuffed - despite only being worn for everyday wear. However they are super comfortable, I love the colour and they look great with a variety of pants!"
4.0,"Honestly pretty nice looking and decent quality though they were a bit undersized, lost one while driving to work. 16mm was more like 14 so keep that in mind but for the price, would still recommend."
4.0,"It is a cute show but was unfortunately too small for my child, even though other sandals of the same size fit her."
4.0,It's cute. Looks like the picture. The chain is longer than I thought but i like it a lot. It came in much earlier than expected (said it would arrive between 7/1 & 7/22 - it came in the mail on 6/21) I'm happy with it overall just wish it was shorter.
4.0,I was expecting it to zip up the front because that's how jumpsuits work. Instead it has velcro patches on the back.<br /><br />It fit perfectly & looked pretty nice overall.
4.0,"only real complaint is slight difficulty in pulling band tight when putting on, strap catches on plastic loop unless loop pushed up. Somewhat padded so is comfortable Too soon to judge how durable it will be. Seems well worth price."
4.0,Like color it is fitted for a small frame person
4.0,"I loved the look but this is definitely not pink, more like coral. I wish it matched the color in the picture, now it’s not gonna match what I bought it for. Still keeping it."
4.0,"Looks good, but don't expect it to last more than 6 months or so. Not bad considering the reasonable price."
4.0,very sastified
4.0,"This style Nike bra has been a long time favorite for me. It’s easy on easy off for me 36B. I can’t use this for HIIT because it’s not compressing enough but love for spin, Pilates and tennis."
4.0,"For $7 i dont think i can expect more out of this shirt. Suitable for office on casual Fridays, i think.  Its a lose fit for sure, but the collar doesnt lay well, ot just stands up and looks sloppy, will wash and iron to see if that helps. Sleeves r too long on me or i am a just a T-rex."
4.0,Product fits well. I have long hair and am using this for a Dread Pirate Roberts costume and was worried it would slide off but it fits quite well. Nice material and easy to tie and untie.
4.0,This is really cute romper but its a little bigger for my 3 yr old daughter..she usually wear 4t since she's a little taller for her age but this is much bigger..but i really dont mind having extra length coz kids grow up so fast anyway..i rated 4 star coz the quality is not very well made I would say its just right for the price..but its really cute though..
4.0,It's a nice necklace. However it's very dainty the pendant is really small...suitable for a small child or young teens.
4.0,Nice dress for the price. Material is stretchy so you don't need to order a size up. Im 185 pounds ordered a XL was a bit too. Over all nice dress. Just buy it!!!!!
4.0,Wife loves it...very comfy
4.0,It is beautiful but its a bit large on my wrist. I love the stones.
4.0,"Really like the feel of these, soft and comfy. A little on the thick side and if your jeans or pants are a little tight they show through. Still cheeky and I like that fact. They're also quite high waisted. I wear low rise jeans and these rise above them. I bought a medium and probably should've bought a small."
4.0,"Had to return. Too snug. I don't have much of a belly, but this will show every curve and issue.  Like riding without a shirt on. And I am not over weight, but the large is for too small  for an American."
4.0,"Fits as advertised. a good windbreaker, but zero insulation.  definitely needs an appropriate undergarment."
4.0,Like the ring except the stones lol more orange rather than champagne
4.0,"Love it, My only issue is there isn't multiple compartments inside (aside from a small pocket you can unzip) it's still a nice bag, sturdy and not cheaply made in my opinion."
4.0,Good product. Works well. Somewhat hard to blend out do to extreme stickiness. Smell is horrid when first opening product but goes away with time. Works very well for fake lacerations in skin.
4.0,They could be a little wider. Made well and I thought they would stretch!
4.0,I like how the frame hides behind the lens. Overall build quality is decent for the price bracket. Just wish they had rubber ends for the ears instead of metal.
4.0,"It's comfortable but the lace bothers me, it's scratchy."
4.0,They look great but they make your ears sore after wearing them for a whole day.  Sure I'll get used to it..
4.0,Ordered these shirts for my 4/5 yr old they arrived an they fit more like a spring summer dress then a shirt. But are cute material was surprising to..
4.0,"True to its color, shirt seems to run a bit small."
4.0,Love the style of this shoe. My only issue is the heel height. It is about 3 1/2 inches high. I purchased thinking it was a low heel of about 2 inches.<br />Not sure if I will keep. May have to return.
4.0,"Not bad at all fornits price, although I wish I had a purchased a shorter chain than 24&#34;. I mean it's not overly long but maybe an inch or two shorter for my personal liking. The chain came in a small velvety blue sack which was nice besides the standard packaging. The clasp itself says 24K, but there was a small off color on the clasp that looked like the gold had worn off. So far so good though with this chain as it has not turned my neck green, changed colors, or snapped at any links"
4.0,Really nice unfortunately does not come with RFID blocking protection.
4.0,Faded when washed...
4.0,Purchase went well and arrived as promised.  Motor is very quiet and it gets the job done.  I am very satisfied.
4.0,It's kind of cool I'm going to be makeing it look more rugged for my purposes. Very soft inside. Sheds a little bit.
4.0,"I normally buy large in all camis but this large is a little too loose and I should have got the medium. However I love the length! They have the little plastic circles that connect the straps to the body and on the pink one the circle is very scratchy and uncomfortable to wear. Other than that, they are great."
4.0,"Looks good, a gift for grandson."
4.0,Just buy them! Fits perfect and nice and thick on the sole. Got 2 right socks! Someone does not know left from right!
4.0,"Beautiful little earrings, however, they are a little difficult to clip them shut seeing as you have to get the end in the little hoop's hole."
4.0,I think this works the same way that rubbing a little bit of soapy water on your glasses does. We used it while out shopping and it definitely did the trick. Worth an investment if you can't wear contacts!
4.0,"The fit was PERFECT.... the only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star is because it's somewhat see through.  The material is not thin... but I think it's because it's white, it's not 100% opaque. Also... if you have lumps/bumps of cellulite and fat thighs... everything will show, because of the white material, so I have to wear pantyhose underneath to smooth everything out.  I'm 5'4&#34; approximately 195-198 lbs... the XL fits just right."
4.0,did not know the size are small  hard to put the small ball in together
4.0,"I like the vest, black/white is a great combo.  It is a bit larger than I expected.  Great deal."
4.0,Ordered for my daughter.  Great for using shoulder strap and putting cell phone in when not wanting to use regular purse.  Not to small but not too big
4.0,"Very cute! Thinner than I thought (I thought it would be typical sweatshirt material), and the black faded just a little after multiple washings. However, it is well made fashion forward, as if that matters for a baby or toddler, and was pretty cute"
4.0,"I bought these for my Mom for her birthday because she had been driving around town wearing her bright green gardening gloves to protect her hands from the sun.  She has dark spots and was treating them with medication so it was important that she keep herself completely protected from UV light.  She was very excited to get these because, not only was it a thoughtful gift (pat on the back) but finding UV protective gloves that are also stylish is almost impossible.  These are super cute and they fit her... well... you know... like a glove :)<br />About the fit: I tried these on too.  We are both short women; I am 5' 2&#34; and my Mom is 5' 1&#34;. Our hands are &#34;small&#34; as in we have short fingers, but my Mom is not a skinny lady and she had no trouble with the girth of these gloves either."
4.0,"I love the charm,but the loop was too small,my braclet would not go threw it!!!"
4.0,Dress style is vey cute but unfortunately I can not wear it as is. The fabric is to sheer but it would make a great beach cover up
4.0,"Great bag, very big!!"
4.0,"I usually wear a S in leggings and am a Size 5 in most jeans. These are a bit baggy on my legs, but are overall a nice fit."
4.0,"I ordered this to complete my Roman Empress costume.  The quality was good, but I wouldn't recommend for someone with thicker calves.  I have skinny calves and the elastic that secured them to my legs was tight.  The upside is that they didn't fall down at all. I wore them with nude colored leather wedges. I got several compliments on my shoes, people didn't realize that the shoes weren't connected to the gold leg things. The wristbands are adjustable, and the headpiece is nice, though the gold leaves were a bit wrinkled."
4.0,I found nothing on the blouse to see who it is to washed
4.0,"Very nice  works well for around town holds my I pad mini  chafer cord ,I phone ,travel folding brush hand wipes wallet , keys every thing I need for a day out around town. Well not fit I pad air . Just the mini."
4.0,"This top does fit but only because I ordered the largest size (XXXL). I am a size 12/14 on top and the 3X fit great, hiding the mommy tummy perfectly. Love the color. The fabric is very thick. Tends to be hot. Won't be a good summer shirt as I was hoping for, but it will be cute for fall/winter."
4.0,"Cute top, but runs small. The arms are a bit tight. The fabric doesn't have much give. If you order, go a size up."
4.0,"This is cute when worn, but if you look closely you can tell the fabric is cheap and there are some loose pieces here and there you may need to trim. Also, the cut is kind of weird and you can see it's not completely even. You get what you pay for! I wouldn't imagine this shirt to last that long after a few washes. In the clubs, no one will be able to tell the quality anyway :)"
4.0,"I ordered a 3X and truly got a L super cute though,  just can't wear it."
4.0,Fits my big head with room to spare and lays the waves down decently. Little flimsy compared to the previously purchased Durags from the same seller but they seem to do the job.
4.0,My wife loves them and they look good
4.0,"34&#34; is the length of the belt, last holes are punched more like 30-33&#34;"
4.0,"My only complaint about these shoes is they look like they should be wider, but after so many miles my toes start to feel it. They are, however, the most comfortable pair of biking shoes I have worn so far. I've only tried two other brands, but even sizing up, they were really uncomfortable for long rides. I can go quite a bit further in these. They look cooler, too. More like a normal shoe."
4.0,Size run very large. Order 1 size down.
4.0,Super cute !! Just the fabric is not soft at all
4.0,"Wow, heavy man. Get ready for the next ice age: This product is rated for sub-zero on the Kelvin scale! Wouldn't consider it unless you're well below freezing — and that means in the -20 to -30 range. Easily a replacement for the classic winter buffalo robe: So save a buffalo. Sheer a sheep instead. Can't wait for February and a few weeks of minus 20!"
4.0,"I have bought their tops before and really liked the big, flowing feel. This was actually slightly smaller than I expected. The sleeves are a little short, unless I wear the neckline like a very wide boat neck. But it will still work with my leggings, and I like the material (as compared to their short sleeved dolman tops). Don't expect amazing quality and if you want a looser look, size up a bit."
4.0,"I wear a size 8 top and I had to return the L and get an XL, which fits ok"
4.0,"I was so exited to get this costume. I opened the box and loved the costume. After putting on the lace up part of the bodice that you assemble yourself, I looked and there was a 1 and a half inch rip on the outer part of the bodice. It cannot even be  sewed because of how it is ripped. so sadly disappointed. : ("
4.0,"This is a rare messenger bag from what I was able to find online. It was hard to see or feel before buying.  The gamble paid off. Just what I was looking for. Well constructed and durable. Large capacity with multiple storage options. Only negative is the velcro flap closure very weak. Anyway, it's a great bag and I even bought another one for backup."
4.0,I bought this for a child and it was the perfect gift.
4.0,My granddaughter wanted a grandmother granddaughter necklace and until shes much older this is perfect.  I received it pretty fast.
4.0,Really cute dress but the material is a little odd.  When you see the product description it is sometimes hard to understand exactly what type of material it is and when the description says &#34;highly stretchy&#34;.  I usually wear a size 14 and the Large fit just right.  I is VERY wrinkly when you<br />take it out of the package and needs lots of ironing.  I would recommend this dress.
4.0,"I gave this 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1 was because the tube charms had 3 Scorpio and only 1 Virgo. The other is because Capricorn looks bad, but is acceptable."
4.0,Nice earrings but from the photo I thought they were a solid teardrop shape and they are actually flat in the back and black
4.0,"i like these ties a lot. they're not the best in the world, you're definitely getting what you pay for.<br />the material isnt the most lush or strong. but as long as you aren't wrestling any bears or trying to play out your sick fetishes in the bedroom with this tie, you shouldnt have to worry about tearing or ripping"
4.0,"My husband wore these during a snowstorm and in the days after.  They did the job of keeping his feet warm.  He said they were a bit small.  Next time, I would size up."
4.0,"I like this sweater/cardigan, but it's small in the shoulders and back of neck.  I took a star away for that.<br /><br />I'm hoping it'll stretch with wear or that it won't shrink in the wash.  Otherwise, it was comfortable.  Material is cable knit, slightly rough.  Again, maybe with wear it'll soften a bit.<br /><br />This is definitely a keeper and I do like it."
4.0,"This is a little bigger than I expected, but still doable. I ordered a large, but should have gotten a medium.  Happy with the buy."
4.0,Nicely made necklace. I love it.
4.0,"The fabric quality was great, but I had to return it.  I'm only 5'1&#34; so the torso fit much too long. It gapped unflatteringly in the back. Very nice bodysuit if the fit is right for you though."
4.0,"Such awesome quality! Such a great price! The only thing I wish was different was v-neck vs. Crew neck, or as my son called it U neck, LOL."
4.0,"the XL was a bit small, so i sent it back for an upsize.  The material is thin, but a nice style.  Great for the price."
4.0,Sexy! Loved it. 5'9 220 lbs. Super see through. (I was only trying on disregard the strapless bra. I love it for the price and will def keep for a special occasion.
4.0,Not very slimming.
4.0,At first it seemed kind of thin and disappointing. After it was washed and dried it was very soft and comfortable. Looks great with jeans.
4.0,"Love the dress and material. Only complaint is that the length is really long. I would probably need to go take it to get altered a bit. But other than that , the dress is just as pictured! 💖"
4.0,"Nice material. Very soft and stretchy. The only thing I didn't like was the neckline. It's a little too high cut for me. Otherwise, super cute and comfortable dress!"
4.0,It’s expensive but good skirt
4.0,has nice coler and beautiful
4.0,Love the feel of the jeans but I wish the waist was higher. I actually added a band at the top of all the pants and they are wonderful.
4.0,"Love the colors, good quality.  However, the dollar bill holder is not wide enough.  Perhaps is was designed for the British pound, rather than American money.  Also, using the coin section makes the wallet look &#34;fat,&#34;  I will use a separate coin purse.  Arrived promptly, packaged well."
4.0,Cute but not too practical for a messy toddler. I could not wash it without wrinkling it and stains don’t come out very easily. Overall a very cute hat though and my nephew did love it at first wear.
4.0,Nice watch. Thae band is very cheap and flimsy tho
4.0,"I got these for a photo session I am preparing for, and these are brilliant. Wow. They are so lovely that they could be called works of art. Also, these are surprisingly well-made and sturdy-not flimsy and cheap like I worried about. Very nice. I am very pleased with these, and now I want to go to a party and wear one!"
4.0,"Bought two of the same color, but the salmon ( peach) color came smaller in size."
4.0,Any instructions on how to correctly adjust the links?
4.0,"These are great shirts but the price sucks.<br /><br />I've been wearing C & B for  many years, no complaints except the price, but they last longer and fit better, so maybe they are worth it."
4.0,"Fit is great and true to size. Really great price.<br /> Super cute too! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 ☆ is because the bra part looks like it has more support in the photo. Not bad, I'm just a busty girl who needs lots of support in the chest. But this covers everything very well and looks almost just like the picture. Very pleased with this purchase ♡"
4.0,"I used this for a Halloween costume when I went as an ox. I thought it would be MUCH larger (like costume jewelry), but it’s the same size as a regular septum piercing. Many people thought I’d actually gotten it pierced! If that’s the look you’re going for, this is the product for you. I was wearing it in a way that wasn’t comfortable, and I felt like I could feel it the whole time. It was fixed by somebody who actually has a real septum piercing. If you wear it further up in the tip of your nose, you can’t feel it."
4.0,The product is a very nice looking ring that fit as I ordered.  The only drawback I can see is it might scratch too easy.  It is worth the money
4.0,"This dress is very cute, and looks exactly like the pictures. The only down side is it runs big. I’m 5”1 and around 114 lbs, and I ordered a size small. It looked too big in the chest and waist area. Had I been taller, maybe it would have hit differently and looked better. But if you are looking for a non form fitting dress, this is it."
4.0,When I wear these I have to do it over my regular glasses.  I think because of that these don't work that well for me.  My kids however do not wear glasses and they have tried these and tell me that they notice a difference when wearing them when using their devices.  Less eye and head pain.
4.0,The shirts are nice but do run smsll. I should have gone up a size.
4.0,"They are pretty but I wanted to have them go up the rim of my ear from my second ear lobe piercing, and it doesn’t stay in place. It might depends on people’s ears and piecing though, so it might work for someone else. I still put 4 stars because they seem sturdy and they are pretty too."
4.0,"Really worked well with some jewelry.  Got a 20"" length, it was accurately sized.  Heavy duty clamp.  Clamp is a little difficult to manipulate at time, but this is a minor issue.  Holds well and will last quite some time."
4.0,Love it.  Perfect fit
4.0,Ordered a kids size medium and it’s more of a men’s small. I could wear it and it would be loose. I couldn’t change the size but my son is 57” and 62 lbs. the shirt was for him.
4.0,"It's beautiful, comfy, and I look great in it. Only thing was the split between the legs was a little bit to high."
4.0,Great looking tee
4.0,This wallet is a great size. The card slots are a little on the tight side. There isn’t a clear ID slot. It’s decent quality for the price paid for it. I love the elephant pattern and now I just need to find a purse to go with my maxing new wallet.
4.0,"Had to use inserts for proper fit, but left shoe much larger than right"
4.0,"This dress is lightweight and very true to picture. Not see through. I had to return this for a larger size. 5'4, 160lbs. I've tried a dozen or so pieces but they are sized like Juniors and cut so larger isn't always better. Too bad because I love everything. I think this dress is great. Soft fabric. I haven't washed it so I can't yet say how it holds up but for the price I'll be happy. Could dress up with this design or be casual but it feels casual to me."
4.0,"Cute Christmas socks but not for wearing with boots. There not thick enough for me to wear with my boots, but are great for a Christmas Party or wearing around the house. They are a good conversation starter where you don't know many people. There aren't for really cold weather if you're looking for socks to keep your feet warm. These would make great stocking stuffers or something extra in a Christmas present. I love the yes colored one so Christmas. Would definitely put you in the Christmas spirit."
4.0,"Nice sweater looks more like had crochet, but definitely machine made. So far like it. Would have preferred if it were less thick when I bought picture made hang better."
4.0,I didn't like the fact that it made my wrist turn green
4.0,Fits and feels GREAT. I have purchased 4 of these
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1a28dfbb368f3fcd36c325773e0efefa]] The kimono fits perfect and I think the earrings are adorable!
4.0,"WILL SEND A REVIEW,AFTER I RECEIVE THEM........... ESPECIALLY IF THEY DO FIT CORRECTLY"
4.0,"My three year old received this as a gift, so I turn to her for the review.  L states, ""I love putting stuff in it and its so beautiful!""  From my point of view, it is great for dressup or for her to use as her purse.  It has a decent storage capacity and appears to be well made.  Item was accurately shown on this site, no surprises! It is a good deal overall!"
4.0,"It's not true to the color of the picture at all. Instead of burgundy or wine, it's like crayola red. The sleeves seem to be a couple inches shorter than how it could've been. But this dress is thick, and at or pass my ankles and I'm 6'2. I love it. Also, if you want it to be true to size get one size up. If a little snug, get your USA size."
4.0,Good quality and light weight. Switch for lights is not covered well. Tears up fast and bothers the feet.
4.0,Color is just as pictured but a little shorter than I thought. I'm a first time online scarf buyer. Absolutely beautiful color and soft and light fabric.
4.0,"This definitely has a handmade look that might be rustic and charming for some, or maybe a bit sloppy for others, depending on what you like. I didn’t see pricing info, but I would put this in the $6-$11 range. Anything more than that would be a little high for what you get."
4.0,"While I love my ring and get compliments on it often, I can’t help but notice it doesn’t change colors. Either my mood is always a faded green, or it just doesn’t work."
4.0,Twins love their sandal
4.0,"These earrings are really pretty! The coral beads are the perfect shade of red, and have just enough weight to them not to feel like cheap plastic, but aren't too heavy at all - actually very comfortable to wear. They hang beautifully. The only issue is that the ear wires are very thin and flexible, and therefore easily bent if you aren't careful! I love the unique shape of the wires, but wish they were sturdier. For the price, though, they are definitely worth buying."
4.0,The tshirt was cute. It was very soft and not too translucent. I usually wear medium to large so I ordered a large to be safe.😥 I reccomend you go up a size. I needed to have ordered am x-large.
4.0,"the shirt is nice, love the thumb holes...but its sizing runs small. a 3X fits like a 1X...it is stretchy material...that's why i chose that size...so that it could be slightly roomy...no, it fits tight..."
4.0,"Its a cute shirt, doesnt really look anything like the picture. Its more like a tunic, its very loose fitting but tight in all the right places. Looks nice with leggings as well!"
4.0,"like, brought for a man, fits as expected."
4.0,BEAUTIFUL SKIRT EXCEPT THE TAIL IS A BIT UNEVEN .
4.0,"I really like this dress! It is perfect for a lazy day outfit. The pictures are a bit confusing, The V in the back is lower than the V in the front. For some reason, there is a weird gap near the armpits, just above the boob. Its not because of small breasts, but it also seems like there is no way to fix the gap. It is very thin, but I did not mind cause it was hot hot hot out. Would buy more if they had different colors."
4.0,"Comfy socks for winter. Cray-cray design, funny misspelling. I will not go “hany” with my dog as I don’t know what that means, and it doesn’t sound right, lol.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,"I expected the color to be more purple and it was simply a navy/royal blue. That's okay, I still love it and it is still very comfortable to wear. I also bought some vest things which looks really nice when layered on top of it so it made me very happy."
4.0,"The material of the dress wasn't what I was expecting.  I was concerned that it looked weird on me.  However, my boss and coworkers all say that the dress looks very cute and that it was a great choice."
4.0,Great for a costume. Shirt can be worn as a regular shirt too. My only complaint is the jacket got fuzz balls after one wash and had some pulls in it.
4.0,"It’s cute. Works perfect for what I needed it for. The reason why I’m giving it 4 stars is because of the weird hole (see pics) on both earrings. I’m not sure if they tried to use that bottom piece for some other project or if it’s there in case the middle piece of the earring breaks and you can attach it to the top and still wear the earring, which makes sense but still looks awkward."
4.0,I wanted to like this band! Specially for the price!<br />But I took a chance!<br />I finally had a chance to connect to my watch head and after reading the reviews I wanted to make sure I put both sides in the right spot!!!!<br />But I still But them on backwards!<br />Like the other reviews one side came off easy!<br />But the other side would not come off no matter what i did! Sometimes it's just worth paying more!!!!
4.0,"These are nice, soft, and actually fit me better than expected because I accidentally ordered the medium (maybe dreaming) but they fit. A little snug but not uncomfortable snug. I will probably hand wash them, hopefully after a few more pounds off they will look better. I tend to like my pajamas, lounge wear larger because I don't like things too tight."
4.0,"I had it chopped off (tailored) above the knee as it was ridiculously long. Got so many compliments and it is my husbands favorite dress on me. You need to purchase double sided tape (made for skin and clothes, also on amazon) to keep it on at the shoulders. I also put some along the back. Quality isn't great but hopefully will get some more wear out of it after I wash it."
4.0,"I returned this one, but bought others.  These are cute skirts.  Of course you can wear them every day, however they are very short - cheek baring short.  So add some modesty with full underpants, not a thong.  Unless you want a thong."
4.0,"I bought an XL and loved these, but they run at least two sizes smaller than usual because of how tightly they fit. It really disappoints me because they are exactly what I have been looking for! So, it's either lose fifty pounds or give them to someone else. They are too nice to return. Someone should get some use from them. Now, to find a really small person..."
4.0,"The SKYWAY Classic Polarized Aviator Sunglasses for Men and Women Mirrored UV400 Protection is simple and stylish. The person who it was selected for likes these glasses. They shade the eyes as needed. They are light and comfortable.  The case for the glasses isn't bulky. All in all, these are a nice pair of sunglasses."
4.0,"I like this item a lot, however, the color is slightly dull."
4.0,"Soft material=comfortable wearing...excellent for hot weather...also can be used as a jock which is was I really bought it...I am finding most jocks have abrasive rough material which rub me the wrong way and straps the bind...pouch size is about right for above ave dude, but not huge...do not put in dryer..."
4.0,Like the saying on hat. Wish it was a bit stiffer in head part but I like it
4.0,A very good quality key chain
4.0,"It's a nice shirt, just don't have a belly if you want to wear something like this :)"
4.0,Fits like a generic t shirt. Fit is true to size.
4.0,High quality Stainless Steel Spring Bar Pins.  Fits perfectly 24MM watch and the Hadley-Roma Men's Black Leather Strap.  Easy to install.
4.0,"I adore this charm. It stands out and is very pretty. However, I thought it would be bigger. It’s tiny but you can still read the wording. Other than it being smaller than I expected, I love it!"
4.0,"Nice size, a little stiff."
4.0,They look nice but some pop open and fall off my bracelet at times.
4.0,"Fit good, just a bit long on my daughter.  She is 120, 5ft 5&#34;."
4.0,I am please with this item.
4.0,Nice simple pair of glasses.
4.0,"I ended sending this suit back, because it was to small and way to small for my body length!  If you’ve got a short torso, I’m sure it will work great!"
4.0,"The pet jewlery is becoming a huge thing and the cost is jewlery is unbelievable. This specific item is beautiful, and made a amazing and meaningful memorable gift for a loved one whose pet passed away. The only thing that was a little disappointing was it looks a little more expensive in the photos but still beautiful in person."
4.0,Well Amazon isn’t always the best place to go for clothes but this particular shirt is not too shabby so I’ll give you all that
4.0,I really like the key chain but the picture showed the year as 2019 which is the year I wanted on the key chain. But instead it shows 2020. Is there any way I can get the 2019 charm?
4.0,"First of all I must say it is a beautiful purse.  I have received nothing but compliments when using it.  Secondly, I would like to say that the seller has worked with me after the date that I could not send it back because of a defect.  I am pleased with the sellers  solution to my concern.  I have and will use this seller again because of the quality of the bag and the excellent customer service."
4.0,"This is a cute little bag. I bought it because it is a crossbody bag & they are nice when you have your hands full. It's roomy with 3 zippered parts. I bought it to take to the beach, I like to have my hands free while walking the boardwalk but yet have my handbag secure. The one and only thing I didn't like was the bag has gold tone hardware."
4.0,More long and dope than I expected!
4.0,"Large stone, but pretty."
4.0,"Good looking shoes with nice leather, but not cosistent in size with other Rockport shoes. Had to return them."
4.0,"Not impressed with material, but my child likes wearing it"
4.0,"I was attracted to this watch because it had all the features I was looking for in a watch.  It has the analog hands and displays the day of the week, the day’s date and the month.  It’s water resistant to over 600 feet, shock resistant, and it has a light to read the time at night.  The solar power is an added and welcomed benefit.  The date display can be changed to show the date or the time with a single press of a button.  The date display windows have a back light feature which glows when the night light is activated.<br /><br />The hand shift feature is amazing.  Simply press a button for 2 seconds, and the hands automatically move to a location so the date displays can be clearly seen.  Press the button again and the hands return to the current time.<br /><br />The night light is white which illuminates from the 9:00 o’clock position on the clock face and does a good job of lighting the entire face of the watch.<br /><br />The hands do glow in the dark for a reasonable period of time.  The white night light on the clock face does help to “recharge” the glow intensity of the hands, making them more visible once the night light shuts off.  However, the hour makings on the watch face do not glow.  Only the hands will glow in the dark.  Without the glowing hour marks, it can sometimes be challenging to quickly determine exactly which hour marks the hands are aligned with.<br /><br />The watch, overall is very attractive with the polished stainless steel, contrasting against the black watch face.  It has a slight bit of weight, which gives it a nice solid feel.  The black watch band is very comfortable and a nice compliment to the stainless-steel look.<br /><br />The buttons function perfectly and with precision.  It’s easy to see this is a well-made watch at a competitive price.  Casio claims this watch battery will last for 20 years before it needs to be replaced.  They also claim it will have an accuracy tolerance of + or – 15 seconds per month.  It is not an atomic synchronized watch, but for the price difference, I can easily adjust the watch’s time fluctuation myself if it only gains or loses a maximum of 1 minute every 4 months.  Actually, once you have the watch setup, it only takes a few seconds to readjust the time again if needed.<br /><br />It also features a countdown timer and 5 separate alarms.  I found these features to be rather useless due to the very week sounding alarm.  The alarm is extremely quiet.  Holding the watch more than 3 to 4 inches from my ear, made it impossible for me to hear the alarm tone.  To be clear, I do have a very slight hearing loss in my ears, but I suspect a person with perfect hearing would still have a difficult time hearing the alarm tone in a quiet room and nearly impossible in an environment with moderate noise.<br /><br />Overall, I’m very happy with the watch.  It looks amazing. Great form and function.  Nice comfortable fit and a size that does not look overpowering on my wrist.  I wear this watch 24/7 through sleep, shower, working on cars, fishing, and we both cleanup well for date night with the wife.<br /><br />My only complaints about this watch is the quiet alarm tone and the hour marks on the watch face that don’t glow in the dark.  Otherwise, this is as near to a perfect watch as I could have asked for.  I have no regrets on my purchase."
4.0,Product looked exactly as shown and is beautiful and fits my child wonderfully. I was a little disappointed in how thin the fabric is but otherwise is very nice.
4.0,"They are very comfortable and the quality is pretty nice. The straps are a little thinner than I would like but overall, good buy! The push up padding is not very thick which I'm happy about!"
4.0,"It is a little shorter than I expected, but fits well, not tight or loose."
4.0,"Pros:  It is one of many I tried that fits.<br />  Looks nice<br />Cons: Hood is not detachable, can not zip all the way up without hood in my face.  So, with zipper down a bit, it didn't feel warm enough."
4.0,Beautiful colors and well made.  I cut off the stones because it was too bling
4.0,"I've been trying all kinds of underwear. So far I have 3 favorites.<br />MyPakage, Obviously Original Anatomax, and Separatec<br />The double pouch is brilliant. I bought this on a whim. (I would have never forgave myself if I hadn't tried them!)<br />These are the most comfortable underwear I have tried if you have a desk job.<br />I thought the double pouch thing would be weird, but now I think it actually makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />Suggestion: Make the testes pouch larger and ditch the seam in the middle.<br /><br />Update: I tried the David Archy version and they seemed to run smaller than these ones."
4.0,Needs bling
4.0,I love it. It's A perfect fit. Wish it could have been a little bigger thou. When I put it on I feel like an Indian from those old Cowboy movies.
4.0,"Exactly what I expected.  I don't care for how they look, as they are quite bulky, but I didn't buy them for looks, I bought these to use as a retainer during surgery.  All of the surgical staff I saw throughout my visit were quite impressed that I had jewelry particularly for that purpose, so I was very happy with this purchase."
4.0,Every time i move the waist band rolls down. Also makes everyone aware of where i am. My thighs are chunky and they rub against each other they make a scraping noise
4.0,I love them so much !!
4.0,"I did NOT expect to love these as much as I did! They are very comfortable, very stretchy, and flattering. The pockets sit a tad high on my back side but I absolutely love these! I got a M, could have probably done a small."
4.0,"Absorbant, but much wider than I prefer."
4.0,"I love this little purse for times that I would like my hands free. My phone case carries all my cards but sometimes I have a little extra to go with me. This is perfect. The biggest plus is how the strap stays in place for such a little purse. I am not constantly adjusting. On the downside, this is desisigned for a cell phone (I have an iPhone 8s) and a few extras (makeup, etc). The two compartments expand nicely, but the flap doesn’t, so do’t be fooled into putting more in. And the clasp is difficult to close even when not over capacity. But if that is all you need - a phone carrier wth a strap / this is perfect. And I have received several compliments from complete strangers on how cute it is."
4.0,"I wear this leggings underneath my jeans and sweat pants in the 30 degree weather, and it kept me so warm!! I love to wear it alone, but it stretches a little too thin for my taste. I dont like wearing leggings that showed my under garments, that's tights - not leggings."
4.0,This is very comfortable but I wish it covered more of the top side.  Other than that it's very stretchy and something I could wear all the time.
4.0,Love the coloring of these. I ordered the neon yellow and black ones. The hubby loves them on me. The only real complaint I have is they seem to run a little small. I typically wear a large and I think if I went up a size they may have fit better. Other than that they are great.
4.0,I ordered the rainbow set and I cannot complain. Me and my daughter split them & she loved them as well. Great shipping and packaging was good too.
4.0,looks very nice on my 4yrs old daughter
4.0,"Fit of these socks is in-between small/as expected. The reason is simple, one would think that ordering the extra large socks for size 13 extrawide feet that the socks would have a larger top around the ankles and shins. Not the case, socks are made for super skinny legs, not real men who have calf muscles. I figure (hopefully) I can streech out the upper portion to one day not be so tight as to almost stop circulation of blood to my feet. After this as expected fit, the socks are awesome at dissapating sweat and keeping feet dry. So far the durability is on par for the most expensive socks I have ever purchased, have washed them now about 5 times and no wool has frayed, even when my wife has thrown them in the dryer and not line dryed them. If they last at least a year I will forgive the insane price of them."
4.0,"I've been trying to find a pair of sweats for my son who is 6'3"", however these were just too short.  Need to buy from a big and tall store."
4.0,"Comfortable, great for the price.  They did develop cracks after two years but I am hesitant to get rid of them because they made it so great to go out into the rain or snow.  Plus, I guarantee you'll get lots of remarks on them.  All in all I like them and will probably replace them for the same ones this year."
4.0,"These are nicely made, but if you have a larger head, it will take some time and effort to get them to stretch enough to fit comfortably without headaches."
4.0,"They feel great however every time I bend over they become sheer and you can see my underwear. I usually wear something over them so it's not a huge deal for me. Also after a while, they inevitably roll up my thighs"
4.0,Seems to be made well and is lined but it is not thick.  I will update this after they are worn a few times this winter.  They look nice.
4.0,Very cute & unique. My daughter is a high school lifter. It’s good for her but it is kind of cheap-ish jewelry. Not very sturdy looking but that does keep it from being heavy. She loves it. Worth the price.
4.0,The material is soft & comfy. I'm not crazy bout the lace on the bottom. The best thing is it has pockets 🤗
4.0,"Great earrings, I got so many compliments at work while wearing them ☺️<br /><br />I experienced no irritation in my ears which are typically super sensitive. The earrings came with the steel backings that have a strong hold. Not once did one fall off or get snagged anywhere. They didn’t weigh down my ears either or cause any discoloration. I definitely recommend these!"
4.0,Quality clip-on. Convenient efbt
4.0,"It's definitely cute but it was somewhat small for me. I ordered M size and I wear 7.5 - 8 size. Based on the review, I thought it would be somewhat loose but it was narrow for me. I bought it for office use, and the slipper is a bit warm. Unless you are wearing the slipper in a cold weather or somewhere cool, it may be too warm to wear for a long period of time."
4.0,"The dress is casual and comfortable. Fit was was as expected, and long enough that you can wear for work."
4.0,Soft flannel material feels good.. Nicely made and very comfortable. Good value for money
4.0,"We've been searching for a reasonably priced leather belt for my husband.  Every one I have gotten him inthe last couple of years, either doesn't fit or is junk, cracking soon after he starts wearing it.  This belt says it is genuine leather, it fits and we'll see how it holds up.  It hasn't been long, but so far, so good"
4.0,"I like the feel of the shoe, but I have to wear socks with them because they are to big. I wear a 7 but I should have gotten a 6"
4.0,Something diffrent. I like my watch
4.0,Nice midweight fabric for the fall season. Length was great.  Was a little wide in the neck.
4.0,"The neck line is a little strange, it's almost puckered but it's okay once you wear it. Fit is a little boxy but that might be because I have a larger chest (40DD) but it fits as expected (I wear XL tops), might return for a large. Def have to wear leggings underneath its a little short (I'm 5'3 165# for reference) Love the color, love the material. Really 90s fantastic!"
4.0,Heavier than I thought so consider that. I really don't like clasp and rings. They are going to easily break. But the spiral is really cool.
4.0,This dress is so cute and fits perfectly and I love it. The fabric is fine for the style and the shoulders fit nicely without poofing out.<br /><br />The only reason I put 4 stars and not 5 is the combination of 2 things:<br />1) the belt holes did not go far enough along the belt for my waist. Being a small I'm used to this problem but the belt is intended for waist wear so I think it should be able to fit the waist of the dress it comes with. But I could overlook that if...<br />2) it could have pockets! It has more than enough flow to disguise pockets and would have been a great addition to this dress! I will overlook so many tiny problems if a dress has giant pockets! I have a gorgeous vintage white dress with pockets that fit all the way up to my forearms and I love it. Please add pockets!
4.0,Tight on my butt helps give lift
4.0,Prefer the ones Russell made in the USA
4.0,I got this watch today and can't seem to get the date to work as the instructions indicate. I press the button down and does nothing. If anyone can give me a tip I would appreciate it. Otherwise beautiful watch.
4.0,"Cute! Looks exactly the same as the picture, and got here 5 days earlier than expected. :)"
4.0,Was a little big for me! Would go for a size smaller
4.0,Zipper part is not user friendly.
4.0,My 4 year old loves them! They're a little big for him but he's comfortable and can run well etc
4.0,"Great small chain. The length I measured was 8 and 3/4 inch with about 1 and 1/2 inches to work with to extend the chain. I would consider this to be a short necklace that is small but not small enough to be a choker. If you wanted a necklace to put your necklace pedant near your cleavage you will need about 18&#34; inch chain.<br /><br />I wore the necklace for 2 weeks and didn't experience any problems or allergic reactions. The silver did not fade and the twist kept their shape. The silver goes very well with my white gold pendant.<br /><br />Chain links are small, beautiful but not durable.I tugged on the chain to see how strong it was and it easily broke. I wouldn't think this length would be a problem from breaking from tugging but that's how all my other necklaces break.For the price of the chain I think it's worth it hands down.<br /><br />I received this necklace at a discount in exchange for honest review."
4.0,"Keeps my feet nice and warm. Wish they were a little snugger, but can't complain too much!"
4.0,Beautiful color combination!<br />I chose the pink/ blue tye dye suit. It has detachable straps that hold it in place. I ordered up from normal size 8 and purchased the 12-14...I weigh 145 and wear 36C: bottoms were fine (although I would have liked a little higher on waist). The top is a bit to large; I knew it would be. I ordered the large so I would be able to cover bottom.
4.0,Very breathable but also quick to wrinkle. I feel comfy but look like a bum.
4.0,I ordered it for a bathing suit but it is too long.<br />But I liked it and it fit great so I kept it for a tennis dress.<br />Perfect with the built in shorts.
4.0,This is a beautiful ring! I have worn it every day for over three weeks and it still looks great. I do put clear nail polish on it every coupe of days or so because it will turn your finger green. Otherwise everyone thinks it is real!
4.0,Nice fabric-great fit
4.0,They are a little tight getting on. But they keep my feet warm
4.0,These run slightly smaller than other shoes of the same size but I wear them without socks and love them!
4.0,Nothing 👍🏼
4.0,Got it for my 6th grade granddaughter and she loves it!  Carries her gym clothes in it.  Perfect size for extra shoes and tennis balls and gym clothes.
4.0,"My son loves his shirts, but his favorite one (the light blue shirt) was about 2 inches shorter than the rest, which seemed kind of odd to me since they are all sold together."
4.0,Very pretty. I got lots of compliments with these earrings. I like them but if you have sensitive ears you may want to consider dipping them in Vaseline before you put them in your ears for protection. Made my ears a bit sore.
4.0,Para mis relojes
4.0,Love this! Fits amazing! My measurements are 38-30-42.
4.0,"Hubs likes these socks more than me because he likes to feel a little pressure from tube socks.  He wears pressure socks anyway and though these aren't pressure socks, they still exert a little pressure on his legs.  They are very well made out of quality material and went through the laundry cycle just fine.  They came out of the dryer nice and soft and very white.  These socks go up the legs well over the calves and have a medium thickness to them."
4.0,"They are a little smaller then I would have liked. But still fit, but as the day went on they fell a little"
4.0,Perfect for using shower at the gym.
4.0,Nice keychain. Heavy duty but a little expensive.
4.0,I like the bell but have one that has a zipper almost all the way down the belt easier to hide money when traveling.  This belt Has a short zipper just to hide a little money
4.0,Light-weight shorts with pockets and drawstring. Color is a little more taupe than grey. Fit is a bit shorter than expected.
4.0,Ordered a large based on sizing chart. Should have ordered a Small honestly. Cute top and design though. I ended up returning and not reordering though. The white fabric around the neckline was not as flattering on me as it is on the model in the item photos. For reference I am 5'6 & 155lbs. (short torso) 36D bust
4.0,Girlfriend likes it. Can't see it when it's in her nose. She needed it for work. She says it's comfortable.  So for the price two high five.
4.0,I ordered for a friend.  They made her new glasses wearable and comfortable!
4.0,"Feels slightly thinner than some other brands. But still feels like it’s good quality. The nose strip is metal and forms well for the nose. My family and I have small to medium size noses, so it might not form as well for people with bigger noses as the strip doesn’t seem that long. Overall, good deal for the amount of masks I got."
4.0,One big issue is once tightened it's not that easy to loosen belt.
4.0,"I really like them, however the long sleeve shirts run too small. I (5’7”) ordered small, and they were a great fit for my 12 year old (5’4”). We both have long arms. I ordered them in medium."
4.0,"Adorable! Great fit and cozy. There are two buttons so both &#34;flaps&#34; can be drapped across you. The inside button was a little hard to find at first but it is there!<br />I ordered at the beginning of october and JUST recieved the product in January (only reason for losing a star). It got stuck in China customs. I was given a full refund, and was allowed to keep the product once I recieved it. Would recommended if you don't expect to get it anytime soon."
4.0,"Nice outfit. Unfortunately, I’m unable to wear certain types of fabric . This was one of them."
4.0,Gets wrinkled really easily especially when wet
4.0,"It's a nice color--true to the picture. The fabric was as I'd imagined by reading the review. A little thinner than I expected, but nothing too cheap. Fits great; it's a little long, but that's what I wanted (I'm short, so it may not be long for you). Sleeves fit perfectly, which is unusual and welcome."
4.0,I bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them and they look really nice in his ears! He's at a smaller size for his second plugs so the double flare was a little hard for him to get in his ears. Other than that the price and shipping was amazing.
4.0,"Nice dress, but I do not like  the Cutout on the back, you can see the bra"
4.0,it's good but in my opinion it's more expensive than it should be!
4.0,"Great hat overall. Is a bit large for my 12-year-old daughter, which was expected. Quality is pretty good as well. The flower is a nice addition to the hat. Would recommend!"
4.0,"I wear XL in T-shirt and Sweaters it's super comfortable and Loose. I prefer more of a fitted Sweater, so I'm returning it And I am getting Large."
4.0,I think its a bit expensive for what it is. Its a very thin light weight robe. Looks great and worked for the girls
4.0,The bottom of the dress is great but the top is not meant for large chested women but you can tuck the halter part and get a shell bra
4.0,I am using this dress for my 20th year anniversary.
4.0,Cute Halloween school outfit
4.0,"I bought this shirt for work. It’s surprisingly thick for a T-shirt material, very warm."
4.0,Overall good costume. It fits but just barely. Mask is very hot. You won't suffocate but there isn't much ventilation
4.0,"Good quality wrap, albeit a more narrow than similar wraps we already own. Otherwise the color is great and the name tag is a nice addition."
4.0,"Looks nice, good for a display item. Blades can be easily bent and finger joints can be stiff, wouldn't recommend buying to wear. For a good quality wearable glove, I recommend going to Boiler Room Creations. They make a great glove, solid blades and easily flexible fingers."
4.0,This is a very nice bag and very comfortable! Came in perfect condition and I get lots of compliments on it . The only thing I didn't like about it is it has a Middle zipper section . I did not notice that when I ordered it . I tend to hate purses that have one cause it gets in the way. But this purse is lovely I will just deal with it .  The outer structure of the purse does not feel fake or plasticy --- nice soft & supple .  Great purse!
4.0,"See through material and snug fit. If you have tummy rolls, girdle will be necessary."
4.0,"Wear these in low-light when I play golf, and they are perfect.  The heavier frame blocks wind, which is good for me because I have dry eyes.  Great for the price.  The temples are somewhat long if you are smaller person (5'9&#34;) like me."
4.0,Nice looking jacket but it runs very small.  Order a couple sizes larger.
4.0,Cheap cord but nice heavy pendant.
4.0,"I purchased this passport wallet for my recent trip to Germany. I was looking for something discreet and functional. This almost perfectly hit the mark, but it was noticeably larger than I was expecting. I have only had the wallet for a few months, so I cannot speak to its durability, but it held up nicely during the trip.<br /><br />Ultimately, I made assumptions and did not diligently look at the listed size, but I do feel like sellers should make more of an effort to use product photos that give a better expectation of size. It is difficult to find a wallet that is roughly the size of a passport and also has a zipper-open change compartment, but this was the closest one I found.<br /><br />The product met my general expectations and I can't mark stars off for it being bigger than I was expecting, but it doesn't get 5 stars because it didn't exceed my expectations in any way.<br /><br />I recommend this product."
4.0,Skirt fits as expected.  I ordered a size large.  I’m 5’7” and normally wear a size 12.  It is long enough to fit well.  Love the pockets.  It’s lightweight which I wanted for A trip to the Caribbean.  It is such a thin knit it does not hang as pictured.  It works as a casual skirt but the material is not the best quality.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  I like the style.
4.0,"Ordered a half size up and their perfect. Softer top than I expected, but kid loves them. Easy to get on and off."
4.0,True to size. Light weight good quality material.
4.0,It’s a little smaller than I would have liked but most of my work pants are high waisted so it just gets covered by the pants. With normal pants there might be a gap. The neck line is super cute and flattering though.
4.0,"The earings are very cool and light, but only issue i had was the grommets would slip off."
4.0,VERY VERY NICE SET
4.0,"Ostensibly sturdy, reliable at a bargain price."
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress and well made, but I ordered a larger size based upon reviews and shouldn't have."
4.0,Its nice and shape is very great .
4.0,"I purchased this dress in both medium and large to be able to pick which size works best for me. I am a little over 5'7&#34;, my pant size is usually a 6, shirts typically a medium, with my weight hovering right around 135, depending on how many carbs I've been snarfing down! Of course there are deviations in size either way depending on the brand. But here is the low down, hope this helps.<br /><br />I ended up going with the medium. The fit was much better, although there are a few issues, however not enough to make me return the dress as I purchased it for a special occasion. It was not excessively snug, kind of gently flowing over my areas of concern without giving any of my secrets away. Just how I like it! Anyway, here are my issues.<br /><br />First issue-the way the dress crosses over the breast rather than below. Although that initially bothered me, given the cost of the dress and the fact that I still thought it was cute, I got over it.<br /><br />Second issue-the waistline is too high, it doesn't hit me at the waist like it does the model in the picture. I believe the model to be several inches shorter than me, hence the waistline hits her at the proper place. And no, I do not have a long torso & short legs, I am fairly proportionate.<br /><br />Third issue-length of dress. In reading the reviews I noted that many stated the dress to be much too long. Oh, if only that were the case for me! At least if a dress were too long, I could have it tailored to the proper length! The size large dress length was perfect for me, but as I stated before, the dress was much too big everywhere else. The medium is just a little too short, however, I am wearing it with booties, so although I would prefer it to be an inch or two longer, it still works.<br /><br />Last issue-the belt. The belt is very narrow, and a bit cheap looking, but for the price of the dress, what can one expect?<br /><br />Even with these issues, I am still happy with the dress. I feel it is a dress that works well for all age groups, I have a 21 year old niece that has the exact same style dress in a different color (she did not get it from Amazon, however) and she is hip and gorgeous.<br /><br />Last but not least, I was accidentally sent the dress in the wrong color and holy cow, was it cheap looking!!! The dress in Black1 does not look cheap (except for the belt) and nobody would ever know that it was a $22.00 dollar dress. I recommend!<br /><br />I have one last edit for the manufacturer of this dress. Please do not shorten the length of this dress or others that you manufacture. I feel it is important to note that for those of us that are on the taller side, if a dress is too short there is absolutely nothing that we can do about it, which is very frustrating. I have found many cute items on Amazon that I was unable to keep or purchase because they were too short. For women that have complained of the dress being too long, at least they have the option of either hemming it themselves, or having it done for them. Thanks!"
4.0,Great price for great shirt
4.0,"Purchased for my 16 yr old daughter after having seen many other types of this item in inferior fabrics at a much higher price.  She loved it and received many compliments from her friends.  I gave a 4 instead of 5 because the wool is woven a little loosely and it is a little scratchy.  Overall, great value and great fashion for the money."
4.0,"This shirt is fitting, so if you want it loose then order a size up. I got a medium and while it fits well and that is my normal size, I think for this style I'd prefer a looser fit.<br /><br />It is well made and soft."
4.0,"Super cute print, very thin material and it fades quickly when washed.  But for the price they’re fair quality!"
4.0,I wanted something a little different for my Fitbit Sense and this band fits the bill. It’s easy to put on the watch and adjusts perfectly to my wrist. I have two minor complaints. 1. It’s a little shorter than other metal bands and I can get it on but individuals with larger hands may have a problem. 2. It does have a tendency to catch on sleeves especially sweater sleeves. Neither one is a major issue for me and I’m glad I made the purchase.
4.0,"Item as described, extremely fast delivery!"
4.0,The coloring is definitely off in the photos. I loved the coloring and that is what drew me to buy this cap. I'm disappointed as the coloring is very light.
4.0,"I've been eyeballing this dress for months and finally decided to order it. The dress is AWESOME and the material is FANTASTIC but this dress runs EXTREMELY small.  I ordered a XXL which says it is a 18/20.  I normally wear a 20 but I couldn't even pull it over my head, so I gave it to my granddaughter."
4.0,"Received today. I like the fit. The material is kind of soft, not too hard. I just hope the garment holds up when washed. Probably would have to wash this by itself and hang dry it. I don't want to lose my pompoms. I'll update this review after wear and wash. I'm 5'10"" 36DDD+ 42"" hips...5 months pregnant and 183lbs currently. I ordered an XL"
4.0,X-Large size is equal to size 6!! its too small!! good material and design.
4.0,Runs a bit large but very cute.
4.0,Cute- light weight. Was giving as a gift but can see where the needle/back? Goes in your ear on the other side of the earring. I don’t mind it for myself but not as a gift. Can tell they are cheaper but for me works just fine.
4.0,Bought them for me but had to give to my nice. Way too small
4.0,Cute! Fits pretty well. I ordered a small and it was pretty true to size for me. I'm 5'6 and 128 lbs. The material is pretty cheap so a strap broke on my second time wearing it but it was easy enough to stitch together. The top is great when you adjust the straps to fit and the bottom was see through in sunlight so I did wear a slip. All together though the print is super cute and I think it was work the price
4.0,"I have worn this dress but not seen what happens after it's washed. The fabric is light and soft with a little bit of a sheen, almost the look of silk. It has a gathering,  kind of like an empire waist area just in the front and it sits a little high up on my boobs which gives it kind of a tent look from the side view, but part of that is just my body. I do like the dress, just waiting till laundry day and hope for the best. If it washes up nicely, I may purchase a different color. We will see."
4.0,Cool but not tied to the body while swimming and unfortunately the cool print started to peel off
4.0,"I really liked the length of the dress - it hit perfectly mid thigh on me, and I’m 5’7. also, the ruffle placement is good - right around the waist. I’ve ordered several things where the ruffle hits on my butt, but not this dress!<br />The inky reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 bc I do t like any of the color options s. I ordered the orange, and...it’s very orange."
4.0,It looks like sketchers is my son's favorite brand.
4.0,Not exactly what I expected but its okay
4.0,Nice to have on a cold night.
4.0,Looks just like pictures. Nice hat
4.0,"I really like these charms but the color I got was a rose gold. I want the gold ones, but I don't want to reorder and get the same. Yet, when I did reorder, the pieces were not yellow gold again."
4.0,Super cute but was too short for me.
4.0,"Really pretty lanyard. Chain is a little thin for my ID badge plus the key fob I am required to carry so I put it on a heavier chain. Overall, good purchase."
4.0,"Neice loved this gift, looks nice and seems durable. Nice little gift. Definitely recommend"
4.0,Good but cheaply made
4.0,Cute but did not fit my face.
4.0,Great ties for a great price. Would have liked them better if I could have picked the ties.
4.0,Smaller than expected but comfortable.
4.0,We were surprised at the iridescence of the stones - it's a lovely sparkly necklace that looks just like the picture.  The chain is super fine though and the tiny clasp is finicky for even normal size fingers so we added another fastener.
4.0,"the waistband is elastic with high waist, so there is some flexibility in  size. the  material is soft and thin. classy style of fashionable A line skirt comes down mid of calf. since the material is thin, it is see through from my experience. The skirt is good for warm day."
4.0,Liked the bright colors. They were a little small.
4.0,They were a nice colors .They looked pretty sturdy too . I had to return them because my wrists are too tiny .  Great service though ! ☺
4.0,We purchased these for my daughter to wear while on vacation (and when we don't want to have to mess with changing her earrings all the time - she's 8).  They are the perfect size and appear to be well made.
4.0,Loved the shirt I’m 5”6 220 very curvy and i purchased a xtra large to insure it fit perfect but it’s a lil too short to be considered a dress without having ur but out but i wore it with some shorts but was also upset the string was not put it in i had to do it myself and wasn’t sure what way to cross it so i had too look back at the picture
4.0,I bought it for me but it is a real tight fit. I thought maybe I could make it work for my daughter who is 7 but it's too big for her.<br />Hopefully it won't lose style and she can wear it next year.
4.0,"Not as breathable have a material as I hoped. I expected a little bit more of a breeze to flow through.But, it is 110 with the heat index today.  As far as the fit, it's good, but if you want it to look like the picture then you would need to be wearing a bra, in addition to pinning the front together or gathering material just in front of your bust, then wrap the straps around it and tie it in place, otherwise it will be a bit keeping in the front. I attached three pictures, that are a little different ways wearing it. One picture is where I just tide I attached three pictures, that are a little different ways wearing it. One picture is where I just  cinched it at my bra line  which is unflattering.  Another picture, just above my natural waist which is more flattering. Or, like I said the way the model must have it,  which is gather some of the material in front of your bust and taking the strings and tying that material to hold it in place. That way, also brings the neckline in so it doesn't try to fall off your shoulders.  This may be different depending on your build.  I have broad shoulders and 36 inches around my rib cage, with a 30 inch waist. I'm pretty hippy  and I am 5'8&#34;. I attached a photo that hopefully shows the material that I gathered and tied the strings around to try and create the look. I just was not wearing a brawl to push the girls up.The length came just above my knees. Overall, I am pleased. Just have to play around with it to make it more flattering. If you are apple shaped, I would stay away."
4.0,They are very sturdy and well-made but surprisingly light. The lenses are darker color than the photo. Perhaps they are not as reflective as they seem but they do a great job shading my eyes. And the case is great too with a cleaning cloth.
4.0,"You get what you pay for! The colors are fun, and my husband got compliments when he wore one to a wedding. But they are cotton and up close you can see the lower quality."
4.0,Keuchain was nice. Thought it would be a bit thicker material but still nice.. Came in a pretty pouch.
4.0,"The Readeel RE-1068 watch I received is exactly as shown in the picture. Overall, the watch has almost all the qualities of a usual digital watch and I am satisfied overall. At &#60;10$ price point, the watch is a steal.<br /><br />The only disadvantage that I have seen so far is that the numbers are not clear when viewed from slanting angles."
4.0,It really is more like a t-shirt/ shirt dress. It's not very long. My daughter wore it with leggings and a white tshirt underneath the other day and it looked great. I can't wait for her to wear it to Disney
4.0,"This is a very nice, clean, uncluttered, simple and sophisticated appearing watch. The band is inexpensive and plain, and should be replaced with a better quality, clean appearing leather or metal band. I chose metal."
4.0,"Not only were these comfortable, but they feel very stable.  I do a lot of walking from my car, and these were fine.<br /><br />I wish they had an adjustment strap, as they are getting a little stretched out."
4.0,Don't like them at all
4.0,It does cinch the waist but you better make time to put it on....doesn't go on easy at all.
4.0,Quite a bit bigger than expected but very pretty and bright.
4.0,"I purchased this to compliment a black and white jump suit and it is very nice.  It's not as sturdy as I would have liked, but the price was so reasonable and I only wear it occasionally, I did not want to make an investment in a trendy belt.  It's really cute though and makes my ensemble look very stylish!"
4.0,My sweet heart absolutely loved it besides the fact that we couldn't get it fitted so it was way too big for his wrist. But everything else he loved about it not much to complain.
4.0,"fit good, but very difficult for me to get fastened in the back so i had to return"
4.0,"I love the print and length of this skirt and it is so comfortable. However, the material is cheap and ripped on the seams after only wearing it once which was disappointing. It was an inexpensive buy but will not last much longer and I’ve only had it a couple of months. It does fit true to size and is cute to dress up or down."
4.0,"Beautiful shiny color, way small, and if you dont wear a tank or something,  it's very rough on unside..plus, my ling hair kept getting tangled or caught on the material"
4.0,They r on the bit wider sz but love the style
4.0,Wasn't sure what to expect ordering this necklace but I was very happy with what arrived.  It arrived quickly and is actually a very pretty necklace.  I like the antiqueness of it and the cord is the perfect thing for this to hang on.  My daughter is going to love this.
4.0,very cute... bought as a &#34;joke gift&#34; for someone who's house got &#34;skunked&#34;.... they loved it! :-)
4.0,The dress fits well in the bust. It flows well. It is flattering. The fabric is soft. I love the pockets. The length is long for me because I’m short. I hemmed it so it’s fine. I bought a S.
4.0,"I've had my eye on this key cover for a while, and really appreciated that it came with a valet key ring. The only issue is that the cover prohibits the key from inserting into the ignition all the way. But, with a little adjusting, it works just fine. It's a little inconvenient, but not the worst thing in the world."
4.0,"I had seen a friend with very similar earrings and I thought they were so unique.  As a female afraid of snakes, wearing them is a big step up.  While these earrings are approximately $15 cheaper, they are far heavier than those of my friend.  I will, ultimately, find someone who can carry the extra weight and give them away :-("
4.0,"Husband loved the festive ties. Kind of thin, but looked fine. Adult size."
4.0,They are warm but they do slide down off your legs.
4.0,"nicely made bad, good construction and design, holds quite a bit of stuff with much of it accessible when walking.  The only drawback is the computer pocket inside the bad which has a strap to hold a laptop in place.....but given the placement of the velcro on the pocket and strap, you can't tighten down the fit"
4.0,"This shell bracelet arrived in a beautiful felt bag. It is adorned with 6 natural shells and one metallic colored shell. I'm debating whether or not I like the metallic shell. It takes away from the naturalness of the bracelet, but it does add a touch of interest.<br /><br />The size is adjustable to fit very large hands. I have large wrists for a woman, and you can see that this bracelet fits me well. I think it might be too big for someone with smaller wrists. While the hanging cords don't bother me, when pulled to the smallest size, they might get in the way."
4.0,I got this in friday and is really beutiful
4.0,Loved the dress. It came looking just like the picture. I would have gave it 5 stars but one of the loops in back of the dress was sewn shut and I had to use a box cutter to open it up so I could lace it up. Otherwise beautiful. I would recommend this dress.
4.0,"Great material, well made however runs a bit big & long, so measure yourself before ordering !"
4.0,I bought this a size large due to the reviews and I'm glad that I did. Since I did that I have no problem with the fit. The seam is not centered well though. The point at the end hangs directly in front of your pants zipper and I find that an odd placement. I find myself constantly pulling the shirt to the side and when I do the seams on both sides show on the front. I like the idea a lot but I don't wear it as often as I would if the seams were better placed.
4.0,These are perfect size for my face there just a little crooked but it's an easy fix. Also there kinda dark which is nice.
4.0,Exactly what I needed.  It arrived as expected.  Worth every penny.  Will buy another if I need to. Product is as described.  Nice
4.0,"The were perfect for my Mrs. Claus outfit but bent the very first day.  Bent it back so was able to wear them, but not very well made."
4.0,Will use to make a sock monkey. Quality product from Rockford IL
4.0,"Cute, a little tight for its size listing but trendy and fun.  Comfy too."
4.0,"Stylish for wearing with leg warmers and leggings, protects feet from slush/snow/rain well.  Fit as expected with good toe room.  The only complaint is that I had wanted an inside area that was warmer/lined for the cold Wisconsin winters."
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings. They are a lighter pink than they look in the picture, and they come from China, so there is a long wait (around 3-4 weeks)."
4.0,"Great cheap sunglasses for driving, it does a good job of cutting glare and it is polarized.<br /><br />It comes with a wipe, a storage bag and a neat little image that shows if you are looking at it with something that is polarized."
4.0,Looks great even if it’s a little off in size
4.0,Overall was happy with purchase.  It was just what I wanted for a Derby Party.
4.0,"Comes with a metal band/hook to throw the Ammonite on any chain/necklace. Good buy for the price. Clasp is a bit simple, may want to switch it for a lobster clasp. Will prolly get one more."
4.0,"They are a little thin, but protected my son's hands from multiple mountain bike falls."
4.0,Used one time fishing and hated it sorry but true.  Returned it the next day.
4.0,"The fabric quality is surprising on this, but it is snug."
4.0,"First off, I bought the wig for cosplaying, not for everyday use or anything. I had read the reviews before on this product and had gotten it despite some of the bad reviews. I've only worn it out maybe 2 or 3 times and yes it does frizz up quite a bit if you keep touching it (but it's easy to maintain the frizziness if you know what you're doing, and if not watch videos!), and you do have to be careful about it catching onto and zippers or stuff like that. Also, the wig net does show, so I had to style it kinda weird for it to not show, and although it's pretty long it is also kinda thin. I do enjoy it though just for fun and everything, but it was such a hassle trying to hide some of the wig net, so I was a bit disappointed, but then again for the pricing it wasn't so bad. If you want a really good wig they might cost about $30 or more. All in all though I do like it, especially for the price, and I plan on wearing it out not just for cosplaying but for fun when i'm going out or whatever! :)"
4.0,"dat build quality isn't so good, go easy on it.  but it's cheap and very good looking - prepare for people to think you're cool"
4.0,T-shirt material. This is a decorative or summer/spring item. Very dramatic!
4.0,"Nice and soft. Yes there's an ugly tag, but you can just peel it off; it's glued on, not sewn. I just wish it was a little longer and wider, but really nice for 10 buckaroos!"
4.0,Love the quote behind the tree.  Good quality sterling necklace and chain.  Check out the quote  - its awesome!  Good size and shows up well.
4.0,"Decent material, larger than expected. Long shipping time"
4.0,Don’t like that’s it’s super slim around the legs. Made it difficult to walk in
4.0,Very nice but really really really big. It's okay though. Also the gap where you can adjust the bracelet is soooo small. Overall very nice bracelet for a very good price
4.0,"this one was beautiful, I gave it as a xmas gift"
4.0,odd vegetable-esque scent
4.0,"They are super cute. Most of them are still holding up well, and I wear them all the time. They do fit a little snug, which is ok with me."
4.0,order your product 3 sizes big.
4.0,"Arrived quickly.  Nice shine. Prettier in person.  Will be maid of honors jewelry.  I'm thinking about switching the earrings with the bridal,  they're stunning!"
4.0,"I love these pants! They fit great, I'm 5'3 and 125, the medium was perfect. The length works so I can wear either flats or heels. The material is nice quality and has a good amount of stretch. The patterns are very pretty. I will have to see how they hold up in the wash. After first evaluation I will buy more of these, they are now my favorite &#34;go to&#34; pants as they can be dressed up or down."
4.0,"Really cute!  Comfortable and slimming.  Order one size up, though.  I am usually an 8 in a shirt and a large fit perfectly."
4.0,"Fit as expected, looks good on."
4.0,Very nice piece for the cost.
4.0,Fits a little head just fine. The sets could be cheaper but they are perfect for what I wanted.
4.0,It's a costume....so it's fine
4.0,Nice watch for a good price.  So far it is a nice accurate watch that seems to be relatively durable
4.0,nice shirt...just too big!
4.0,This man's watch screams classy. The band and case are gold colored. The case is stainless steel. The crystal is mineral and the face is black. The hands and numeral indicators are also gold colored and also have glow in the dark on the major hands and numeral marks. The watch is made in Japan and also has a quartz movement. It will require a new battery from time to time.
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and slender so even the small is not as snug in the lower legs as I would like. However, it still does the job when I tuck it into my socks."
4.0,"I wear these pants over jeans to provide insulation while standing in frigid playgrounds with my kids. They are warm and do the trick. The size extra small fit best. (I am a size 4.) However, since I have need a 34inch inseam, the extra smalls were too short. The small were fine lengthwise but were too large in the rear and thigh area. I went with the small since I wear the pants with a long coat. They are a bit bulky to roll up and put in a backpack."
4.0,"It's just as I expected, given the price point. I did not read the measurements so I did not expect it to be as large as it is. I just received it, so I am not sure how well it will hold up.  Due to the size, for me, it goes very well with a turtleneck sweater. I purchased it as a deal of the day, so I am happy with what I received for my money, I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't think I would have been as happy if I had paid the regular price."
4.0,fits and works.
4.0,"I use to have a pair of these earring and I lost them during a move,  And I missed them so much.  And when I found these I had to have them.  I love them, and I think they look so good on any one."
4.0,Really cute and loved the material and the buttons are easier to snap then normal onsie
4.0,"For the most part it fits pretty well. Got the medium. It’s a little small in the arms for me and a little boxier than I thought it was, but overall still a cute shirt"
4.0,"I am all about multi-tasking so it's no surprise that this Convertible Twist Wrap Maxi Beach Dress by Flora Florida intrigued me.  If I can get multiple looks out of one dress then that makes me one happy lady!<br />If your really creative, or at least more so than me, you could probably come up with even more looks from this one dress.<br />I love the Nautical look of the blue and white stripes and it looks really cute with beachy sandals and a floppy hat.  However, I would consider this more of a swim suit cover up than an actual dress.  It's made out of 85% Cotton 15% Polyester and it's a little see through so it wouldn't be practical to wear anything but a swimsuit under it.  Which I am totally cool with since I think this makes a great swim suit cover up!<br />I would also say this dress fit true to size, if anything it maybe runs a little big.  I purchased a Medium and right now I wear about a size 8 to give you some idea of what size you might need to get for yourself.  The fabric is really stretchy and flowy so it's pretty forgiving.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because it's not really a dress but more of a swimsuit cover up and should be advertised as a cover up.<br />***I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, all of my ratings and reviews are my own thoughts and my own opinions and if I don’t believe in the product and use it myself then I will not provide a positive review or rating.***"
4.0,"Sort of a smooth bathing suit material feel, fits as expected. I'm 5'4&#34;, 115lbs and the small fit well."
4.0,"This shirt was shipped pretty quickly, gave me the size that I ordered, and is super soft. Looks really really cute with some long bead necklaces to contrast the white-ness of the shirt and a pair of dark leggings. Only thing I personally wish is that it was thinner. When I wear a color cami underneath the shirt you cant really see the color. But still, good buy! (:"
4.0,Super Cute but a little loose around the chest area as someone with larger boobs. Not bothered by it but had my talented gma adjust it a little. Love the shirt color and feel tho!
4.0,"This style is very cute and the swimsuit fit wonderfully, however, if it was red you're wanting I would say not to pick this suit. It's definitely more of a dark pink."
4.0,"I like the thickness of the glasses but the part that is supposed to be gold coloured is more of a bronze colour... it's kinda disappointing really but it's not the end of the world. I purchased this as a gift, i still plan to give it as a gift but i may also just order another pair from a different vendor and hope it's the correct colour in person and not just only the picture. When you take the picture it does look more gold but in person it is not. So i'm giving 4 stars. But these really arent bad."
4.0,Price was great but ran a little on the small size (didn't have the bigger in stock) so I took them anyway.  Seem good quality
4.0,I am 5'8&#34;-  it fits well - bought a large
4.0,"I bought this in a large which is usually what i wear. and it fit just right. but if you do want that oversized look, definitely go up a size or 2. i wanted a normal fitted look so i’m happy with getting it my usual size. i just feel like i have to be very careful with the zipper, kind of gets stuck when zipping it up but hoping it’ll be ok. 👍🏼"
4.0,"Fits great, looks cute! Fabric is a bit thin so I don't recommend drying it, and where a tank underneath if you don't want it to show everything."
4.0,Nice dress..<br />I'm 5'4&#34; and length was great could wear with flats or a heel<br />I am 38DD and it fit nicely<br />It is exactly as pictured..
4.0,"I ordered an XXL for an XL man...it is a little more snug than preferred, but it's still a very well made garment!"
4.0,"super sexy, but very thin fabric - great for wearing a couple times for pictures"
4.0,"Light to medium compression and they fit and feel great. When I have 8-10 hour days these are perfect, for longer days you may need more compression."
4.0,These shoes are made for someone with size 9.5 and down I fit my 10.5 woman size door but I have to strain the keep them on!
4.0,Cute item. Was difficult to put because it came like if it was a necklacr but I got it . Cute ankle bracelet . Makes the foot look nice !
4.0,So so beautiful 😍 and the quality is amazing. I usually wear a M and I ordered a L but it is a little tight so it runs extremely small but I did not have the strength to return it hehe . I really wish they would make this clothes a little bigger ☹️
4.0,"I am not too big a fan of tapers, but these did what they were supposed to do without any issues. The shipping was amazingly fast, so I didn't have to wait long when I realized I would have to use tapers to stretch."
4.0,"They’re not thick at all, fabric is soft."
4.0,The keychain is perfect only ONE thing bad about it. They grind off each other and scrape the black color on the boarders.
4.0,It's beautiful and material has full coverage. It's light weight material so nice for being worn on warmer nights. Just a wee bit small in midsection length to crotch but that could be my body shape. I do love it!
4.0,"Great robe, but I wish it was just a bit thicker and higher quality cotton.  The fit is plenty roomy for my son, and he loves the robe."
4.0,Look great and at a good price
4.0,Uts fine.
4.0,"It’s fits well, my little man is a chunk so Im very iffy about outfits I can’t see. Very happy with it! Good quality."
4.0,"Shirts fit my son well, but he's a size 18 and the tie that came with the size 18 was a toddler size clip-on tie.  My son thought it was so funny he wore the clip-on tie to show his friends.  Not the greatest value as listed."
4.0,Super cute runs true to size
4.0,Nice material and fit for the price. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,"I got the blue ones in small size.  They look and feel great.  I'm not used to wearing something showing so much of my legs in public but I'll get used to it.  These really need to be on someone whose body thoroughly looks good, because you can see most of it.  lol  There's one flaw in the design of these for the sake of wearing them in public.  The part that goes directly inbetween your legs and therefor covers the lower end of your junk is only 3.4 in wide.  You read right, the bridge is only 3.4 inches wide.  You cannot spread your legs very much without risking some of your stuff coming out, or at least being visible to someone else, especially if you're sitting down.  You pretty much need to pretend it's a short skirt.  I got the smallest size and I'm not very thin so there's no way any size you get will be tight enough to hold on to your legs and keep your danger below stuff hidden.  I'm gonna go swimming on a lake for a few days next week and I'm gonna bring them, along with another more covering pair for times when I won't be able to keep my body so stiff and straight all the time. I'm worried cause there will be kids with me on this vacation.  lol"
4.0,I got these for my daughter and she loves wearing them to sleep.  They're cute and comfortable and keeps warm.
4.0,"First: I am 5'6 "" and 116 lbs. This didn't drown me but it was on the large size. I know these are supposed to be more-or-less one size fits all. It looked ok on me, so it worked.<br />I love the light material which is slightly see through. It says it's made of polyester but it felt like chiffon if that helps. The pattern is better than it looks in the photos are reminded me of William Morris, the Arts and Crafts designer. It's a beautiful rich emerald green.<br />This opens in the front but has a tie. The sleeves are generous and beautifully cut. All the seams are well sewn so no issues there.<br />I just wish this was a little longer. As is, it covers my hips and my rear, but I wish it was about 3-4 inches longer."
4.0,"The holders on the pair that came were not tightly bent toward the sides so that they were not tight-fitting when only holding the glasses ends. The glasses did not have holes, and this had those hooks, so I thought it would work. I lost the strap in a week."
4.0,Product received as pictured.
4.0,"I ordered one size up and they fit perfectly.  The shirts are great, they don't shrink. I got 3, the XXL logo was fine, but the Large size logo wasn't printed well - looks spotty.  I got 2 large and both logos had the same spottiness.  I've attached 2 photos so you can see the difference,  Large is the first photo."
4.0,"My daughter loved the colors, and with an average amount of care it looks like they'll last awhile.  My one complaint is they're not as thick as I thought they'd be.  Since they're called leg &#34;warmers&#34; I expected them to be &#34;warm&#34;.  Not so much.  More stylish than warm, but still cute, and for the price they're not bad."
4.0,"The package got to me right on time and it was great! My only issue is that the red/brown one came out really dull. I knew it wasn't going to be a vibrant red, but the color was almost an amber which really didn't look as good. The others were just fine, though."
4.0,"I'm still getting used to these swim googles, but I do like these googles over more expensive, bulky diving masks or those tiny swim googles that go over each eye....and for less than $10 each, one should buy a second pair of these googles.  Lens is well attached and there is plenty of viewing area for an adult."
4.0,Love this. It came before expected time and the fabric is super nice. One of my favorite top so far.
4.0,fits as expected but I ordered a larger size based on the reviews. The blue and grey fit great but the black one tends to ride up after wearing a few hours.
4.0,"These worked out great for his ""Mavericks"" team practices, but don't hit high enough for games.<br />Lots of support, snazzy designs, good fit & ease care."
4.0,"Quality is above average, but not great. They're not as sparkly as the photos but you do get a great number for your money."
4.0,Band has already frayed which now causes a sharp splinter of the metal lacing to contact skin.<br /><br />Product fit what I needed and I am happy with that aspect. However the fact that it has already started to fray is a huge disappointment.<br /><br />If it wasn't for failure of the bands integrity more stars would have been allotted. Fix the band and after a few wears I will be happy to update my review.<br /><br />Update 12.5.20-<br />Seller replaced band. New band has not frayed. Product is decent for price. May not buy again but it us certainly fair quality.
4.0,"Looks good, feels fine, but blue color leeches if wet at all."
4.0,I absolutely love this item! The belted tail works great & perfect for when I'm wearing jeans. The tail is bendable so you can adjust it to whatever position you'd like & the ears on the headband are cute too!
4.0,"Very soft. Fits well. Arrived ok, but was just stuffed in a mailer-no sealed plastic wrap. Previous same sweatshirts were tissued and sealed in plastic."
4.0,Hard to close and flash light doesn't work but it withstands strong wind.
4.0,"This product is stylish and cute and pretty true to size for a shorter person. I am 5’10” and 138 pounds and the sleeves were short! Like, too short to wear unless pushed up. Also, even though the medium was baggy like a medium typically is on my the elastic around the waist and wrist was so tight and not soft. Also, unlike the photo, the shirt is rubbed. Which, is fine and looks cute but the photo really should show that. I really wanted to love this shirt but like so many of the Asian brands the sleeves are just too short. So, I would recommend it for shorter people and also you may want to size up due to the tight elastic but not actual size of the shirt."
4.0,"I had bought the large as a 10-12 (in America) and it was too big so I opted for the medium. When it came in, it was PERFECT! Except for the two very holes at the seas on the skirt and on the top. (I still buy buy another though)"
4.0,"solid material, just wish it can be a bit sofer"
4.0,Kind of too thick of fabric for summer.
4.0,Love this dress! I bought it for a dinner cruise and received lots of compliments. I'm a 34 F so it was a little snug on the top and the design did stretch but I kinda expected that. I bought a Medium.
4.0,"Not as stretchy as expected and a little thinner than expected, but overall a good pair of shorts. They fit well, move well, keep cool while moving, and seem to be decent quality."
4.0,"I find it difficult to get them snug enough, due to extra plastic square in band."
4.0,"Me pareció muy grande y robusta para mi gusto, sin embargo esta muy bien acondicionada, la parte pequeña de la bolsa deberia desplegarse un poco mas ya que es un poco incomodo sacar las cosas, me gusto que puedes usarla con asa grande o biem trae una asa pequeña por si quieres llevarla en la muñeca. El color es lo mas fiel posible a la fotografía."
4.0,Been looking for a larger headscarf. These fit that need.
4.0,"Not to sure about the material, never wore this before"
4.0,"Beautiful dress but seems to have a bit too much fabric in the skirt. I was expecting a knee length dress but it is more like a mid calf dress on me (5ft 4 in) so I would keep that in mind. The tie is extremely long as well, my waist is 25 inches and I had to loop it in the back and then tie in the front which still left a ton of length on the tie. Overall I do love the dress and I get many compliments on it as it really does look like a shirt/skirt combo rather than a one piece dress."
4.0,These are great fitting inner tank tops.. slim fit and feels comfortable. Only wish the material was a bit thicker. Overall a 4 star and value for money.
4.0,J.TOMSON makes a nice product and I have several of their pieces of clothing.  This J.TOMSON Women's Batwing Sleeve V-Neck Wrap Front Drape Top (S-3XL) is no exception.  It does run a little large but it is actually comfortable and I am okay with it.  The fabric is super soft and the top washed very nicely. The color is nice and surprisingly like what is on the monitor screen.  J. Thompson rarely disapoints me with their quality and design.  Sizes can be off a little here and there but on target for the most part.  I bought this top at a discount and this is my honest opinion based off my experience using the product.
4.0,Ordered a size up as reviews suggested and it fits great for me!
4.0,I ordered this bra for my wife 1 size larger and she loved it. It arrived on time and at a great price.
4.0,"Works. Still waiting to bring to the show, little bit larger than I’d expected, but nothing wrong with it."
4.0,I can never get my son to wear jeans...these pants have a Jean like texture but are cool enough that he will wear them. He also says they are as comfy as sweats and don’t feel like jeans at all
4.0,Beautiful lady short only problem was that they roll up after sitting or walking
4.0,"I like that this sports bra is a longer design. I like the fabric, it's comfortable, and the way it fits, in the front and back. I wore it at the gym and Zumba.  What I do not like is the removable pads. They are small rounds pads that move around, bunch up, difficult to fit into the pockets, and hard to get them to stay in the proper position. If the sports bra had better pads sewed into the top, I would have given this product a 5 star. I would not buy this sports bra again due to the removable pads."
4.0,It's very comfy. I love it!!!
4.0,"Not quite the size expected, but it fits. I recommend buying one size up from your normal belt size. Wear a 32? Buy a 34."
4.0,This piece of jewelry is great. It is exactly as the description says however it includes a small chain. Perfect gift for a loved one. =)
4.0,These are so cute but snug in the waist
4.0,"Was bummed that it wasn’t an actual crystal.. however, it’s so stinkin cute! And good quality! I’m using it on my Pandora charm earrings and it works perfectly!"
4.0,"I loved my new frames but they were causing pressure sores on the back of my ears. I did not want to get rid of the new frames because beauty is pain but I also needed a solution. I got a few kinds of silicone glasses sleeves and found these circular ones to fit the best. The others were too big and the fit awkwardly on the glasses. These slip on easily. I will say that I feel that it would be nice if they stayed in once place more- they slide around a lot, I adjust it a couple times a day."
4.0,I wear a 9-1/2 to 10.  I had read some other posts that said they fit small so I ordered 11's.  Ended up having to send them back and get 12's
4.0,"My students are using these as pointers for small group reading instruction. They love the finger lights, however I was disappointed that seven in my 2 boxes of 20 did not light up and couldn't be used. As a teacher I spend hundreds of dollars on supplies that are fun and exciting. I get disappointed when I get defective products, so I took one star away."
4.0,Shrinks but looks good.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter.  She does not like to wear belts. Pulls on the Jean loops alot. Afraid at some point the loops will break. But for right now it works.
4.0,"Great looking chain, The links were larger than I wanted. Sent it back. However, If you like large stuff, buy it!"
4.0,I have one in black that bought in Italy. It was great to find the same in brown. So versatile.  I use the black one everyday
4.0,Super comfortable and good compression!
4.0,"Cute but wrong size and internally threaded (didn’t know, whoops!)"
4.0,"Well, they did advertise low rise and that’s what ya get. Minimal fabric, minimal coverage. Still, I can see value in these... just very, well, minimal. They cover the bits and butt so got that going for them."
4.0,This was ok for the event
4.0,I think this is definitely cute for what it cost but it's a bit confusing when you first look at it .. it doesn't just slip over your head .. the piece that actually covers your chest is broken and the draping sides cover up the area that appears bare at first .. I am small chested but would be very nervous how it would work on Dolly Parton !!  :)
4.0,Nice color. Fits ok.
4.0,Fits well. Durable!
4.0,Good Quality.  Bright Colors.  I like this suit
4.0,Well made and soft for the inexpensive price.
4.0,"came in a professional looking box,and 5 piece.<br />feels like silk like material, will be giving as gift to my lawyer friend,hey if he cant win a case he might as well be well dressed."
4.0,"This arrived today and came as expected. Will work great with leggings. Wish the sleeves were a 1/4&#34; longer, but otherwise it's very cute!! Would order again."
4.0,It's a good sized bag with carry straps that are long enough to go over the shoulder comfortably while wearing a winter coat. I have athletic shoulders and this is a peeve when shopping for bags. Quality seems durable and holding up to daily wear and tear.
4.0,Fits more like an xl than a xxl. Still wearable though.
4.0,The skirt will work it's a little see through that's the only bummer but the fabric is soft and it does pretty much look like the one in the picture.
4.0,Would have been five star but the back of the top has two extremely different blues! One half ( the back has the seam) is the royal blue the front and sleeves are but the other half is a totally different denim blue! Still lovely but I can’t wear to a special function as I wanted.
4.0,"This handbag is almost what I thought it would be. Lots of room, very soft, Beautiful and lots of pockets.  The only problem I hav is it’s a little heavy, even with nothing in it.  I did notice by putting the shoulder straps on and carrying that why is less heavy.  It will be less stress on my back that way.  Very pretty purse."
4.0,"I don't know the first thing about jewelry... But i spent hours searching amazon for the right jewelry for my wedding day and this was the ONLY set I really liked, so despite the price, i ordered it. It is very pretty but just didn't look worth the amount i spent on it so i did some research and discovered i got it cheaper on amazon than I would have anywhere else, which was a relief. The earrings are much lighter than i expected which is great. The necklace is a bit stiff and tight, but adorable and not bothersome to wear. My dress is very plain so i'm happy with how flashy this set is. Can't wait to wear it!"
4.0,"Its just what it looks like! good material, not see through... I really like this simple peice :)"
4.0,"This is a well-made, relatively heavy sweater that is beautiful. It does not, however, have bell sleeves."
4.0,"Had a tiny hole, but not enough to be returned.  I have worn it several times with many compliments."
4.0,It's a little tighter than I was expecting but still a great dress.
4.0,Slightly thin and fitted but love the style.
4.0,"Bought as a Christmans gift for my brother, size M is way to big for this medium build man."
4.0,cute but very thin material
4.0,"The fit was as expected, BUT it is pretty short.  It doesn't cover my butt, so this is going to end up being a boho type of shirt that will be paired with cute jeans or shorts for summer.  Otherwise, its a good buy!"
4.0,"Nice jumpsuit, the straps run a bit large."
4.0,"good ,but ii is too small"
4.0,"I ordered this blouse for a holiday party, and I got a lot of compliments.  It seems to be made fairly well, but make sure you order at least two sizes up from your normal size.  All in all, I am very happy with the blouse and am thinking about getting one in another color."
4.0,I order this product for a medical condition. It is a little heavy but keeps me cool in 90+ degree weather for 2-4 hours. There is additional moisture noted to the front panels as the gels warm up. I wear it with t-shirts underneath so this is not a deal breaker for me.<br />I am just now trying it for the weight loss or increase calorie burn effect this month. I will update this review at the end of the month regarding it effectiveness.<br />As a cooling vest though I do recommend it this product. Once you get the straps figured out it is pretty simple to grab the vest and go have fun in the sun.
4.0,I didnt get tibwear it but naybe afew hours fkexed my muacles in neck and chain broke
4.0,"This item runs at least 1 size....I ordered a Med. but it way too small.  I love it, the quality but sadly it's going back.  Very cute with jeans but just too small..."
4.0,Fits on the small side. But im in the process of losing weight so it will fit more comfortably once i lose some weight. Other then that its nice
4.0,Nice Top. Good fit. Some beading over time.
4.0,"Good bag for the narrow lockers, but I wish it were more sturdy is leans over with not much in it."
4.0,"This is beautiful.  I can only use it for the thinner scarves (silk and chiffon), but that's okay.... it's so pretty!!"
4.0,"I ordered a size up as suggested by another reviewer.  I tried it on, and it was very large.  After one wash it fit perfectly.  That is why I always read the reviews.  Nice t shirt to wear with jeans."
4.0,Quality is great and the fleece on the inside is very soft and not itchy. But it makes it a little thick.
4.0,These jackets are really cute i love them
4.0,"I like the glasses , their comfortable but the top is suppose to be one third clear and mine aren't otherwise their real nice for reading etc.  Thank You. Jim L."
4.0,Very pretty in the front but I was disappointed the color did not go all the thru.  Also a little heavy for me.
4.0,"The size of  the Bank200  is perfect for carrying in a small purse. I like the color which is  a pretty rose pink.  It comes with two small keys which are easy to use. I left the keys I home and I was surprised when I opened the bank to discover I had save $420 dollars. I probably would have saved more but, it was not easy for me to discreetly insert  money into the bank so, I stopped using it.  The only thing I do not like is the opening ;which in my opinion makes it difficult to insert more than one bill at a time.  I will continue to use it and hopefully I will become more proficient with the bank200 with time.  Overall it is a great device and I am happy I bought it."
4.0,I received a lot of complements on this kimono.  I paired it with a midi black dress.  Next I'm going to wear it over some black jeans and tank :-)
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loved how the pockets are set. However the crisscross straps in the back were way to tight as she is a triple D in size. I will have to uncross the the ties and bring them straight down.
4.0,Fits very nicely and it’s very warm. The Lightgrey is rather dull. A little disappointed in the color but keeping it.
4.0,A little tight around my thighs. I’m 5’2 and 130lbs with big thighs. Other than that it was very cute!
4.0,Cómodos y grandes
4.0,"Got this for traveling, like that it comes with the case since it's hard to fold it back to how slim it was before I opened it. A little hard to open all the way, hoping it'll get easier with more use. Feels a little flimsy, but you get what you pay for. Haven't tested it in the rain yet. Like the multi leaves color!"
4.0,"The color is pretty and the material is very soft. The top fits nicely. It washes well. Taken off one star as the height is little short for me(5'6"")."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable winter coat; it has a hood, which I love. It's also got pockets for my gloves. It's not heavy but it keeps me warm.<br />I was surprised that it ran small; it's supposed to be a Large but fits more like a Medium. I wonder if since it's called a ""short winter coat"" is why it feels small to me? It only goes to my hips, which is the ""short"" part.<br />I like that it's machine washable; I laughed when I saw you could iron it - who irons winter coats? LOL<br />I recommend this coat, but you might want to order the next larger size that you typically wear."
4.0,"I like this sweater. Size-wise it looks like what is pictured,  however I received a light gray sweater,  not the dark gray pictured that I ordered.  I'm disappointed in that,  as I would have preferred dark gray,  thus I can only give it 4 stars."
4.0,"The product is as described.  Black shoe liner made to stretch.  They fit my size 12 EEE foot comfortably.  These are made to be worn with loafers, deck shoes, boat shoes, low cut sneakers, etc.  In fact, you can wear them with any low cut shoe.  I tested these with a pair of Santoni loafers, two different pairs of Allen Edmonds boat shoes and a pair of New Balance running shoe. I have included photos for your reference.  The Men's No Show Athletic Casual Socks came in a flat envelope which was easy to open.  Each pair is separate and held in shape by a piece of cardboard.  See photo.  The fabric quality is good.  It feels like a nylon or elastine/cotton mix.  Very stretchy and easy to put on.  The fabric is not like a soft cotton sock, and so does not add bulk under your footwear.  This is a good feature if your footwear is a bit tight.  The sock fit well with the toe piece crossing the upper part of the foot around the area where your foot bends.  It will fit different on different sized feet, no doubt, so that is a guide based on my size.  There is a gum-like sticky material inside the heel to prevent them from slipping off your heel when you are walking.  My experience, however, was that regardless of the footwear, the heel kept slipping off.  With the exception of my New Balance running shoes, the right heel slipped off within seconds of walking in some tests and in other tests, after a few minutes of walking.  I believe that was a function of how my loafer and deck shoes fit.  Both are loose in the heel and normally slide off.  That motion tended to pull the sock down. This did not happen with the New Balance sneaker, probably because the fit was tighter and it was a lace up running shoe.  I can't say if everyone will experience the same issue, because every person's foot is different.  I would certainly recommend giving these a try.  Full disclosure:  I was given these to test and review because I purchased two other brands.  Product link: [[ASIN:B01D2PD448 Men's No Show Athletic Casual Socks 6-Pack]]"
4.0,"I received this pajama set, but unfortunately, I am having to return them due to the sizing.  The pj's were too small, thus, did not fit as I expected.<br />Otherwise, I love the product and found both the material and the style perfect to my needs!  Please note that the bottoms are short.  I particularly thought the man shirt was quite sexy..."
4.0,"The backlight only lights from the left side, leaving the right side dimly lit... but enough to read the time."
4.0,"Cute pants, nice quality. Fit a little snug, but still look really nice. The material is soft and will be easy to clean. The belt is removals which is great because tying the knot is annoying."
4.0,"I love it! I was worried it might be small since it was one size fist all but it fit nice a loosely on me and I'm 5'4"" and 163lbs. The only complaint I have is the material is a little stiff, but other then that I'm very happy!"
4.0,"very cute, was afraid it would be to large but a great size even for a 12 year olds arm"
4.0,Very nice look not over label with coach symbols
4.0,The dress fit as expected and looked great!  The &#34;V&#34; in the chest area isn't quite how it appears in the picture.
4.0,It’s a great watch. Well worth the price. My only complaint is that the watch is larger than it need be.
4.0,"I really like this dress! I originally bought this in Black. I wear a large. I'm 5'3&#34;, 170 lbs Bust 41, Waist 35 and Hips 43. The hem line comes just below my knee. The material is soft and comfortable with a little stretch to it. I like that there is give to the material even though it's form fitting. It flatters my curves and hides my stomach. This is a great versatile dress for work or casual wear. And the price is great! My husband saw how much I liked this dress so he bought the other two colors.<br /><br />The caveats are; the sleeves do not lay on my arms as pictured. They sort of puff out. I am not all bothered by that but I noticed some reviewers are. Also, the colors are slightly off. The black is more of a Charcoal (off black). The Navy Blue is brighter than actual Navy. It is just blue. The purple is more Burgundy / Wine... NOT AT ALL purple. Because I like having multiples of clothes I love, my husband just purchased another blue one for me. The material is not at all the same as our original purchases. The originals are heavy, thick and very well made. The second blue one is much thinner and a little bit see through. There doesn't seem to be any consistency, which is unfortunate. My four stars still stand because I love the original three."
4.0,"Very nice and warm. I wear it with a half helmet. Took several weeks for delivery, but well worth the wait."
4.0,Seems fine in the few days I have had it.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dirndl.  Love the embroidery!  The blouse is  simple but nice.  The apron is just OK, but you can always get another apron."
4.0,The outfit fits great the material is lovely for the price the color is not as bold as shown in the pictures but other than that definitely worth $10
4.0,It's a nice figure with good articulation for it's size.
4.0,"very well made, great looking in person , would buy again"
4.0,This sweater is very comfortable and very cozy recommend purchasing sweater fits very well and wend it starts to get cold i throw it on and it feels delightful
4.0,I ordered a size up but due to the fabric being stretchy I could’ve left well enough alone. Beautiful dress.
4.0,Bought as a birthday gift she loves it
4.0,"good quality metalwork, stones tend to become damaged very easy such as chips or cracks if hitting the ring against things occasionally, but i mean the price is pretty dang good and it looks EXACTLY as pictured. the sizing of the ring is SPOT ON. no complaints really."
4.0,"Very happy birthday girl. (""It's my birthday today, and I like my birthday presents, and I like my new pillows, the earrings are soo fancy and I like them. Even fancier than leggings.""<br /><br />They fit well for my now 5 year old, the hoop is about half full so she has some years to grow into these if they last that long. These are the first earrings I got her after her ears were pierced at claires, and the posts on these are about double as thick, so it was slow getting them on painlessly, but the posts are very rounded so they will not hurt. They seem really secure, I can't imagine them just falling off. Packaging is cute enough to use as a gift box, though not fancy.<br /><br />Minus 1 star because the pink is not nearly as vibrant as in the picture."
4.0,"these are infrequently used (due to pandemic restrictions), but when they are worn, my child doesn't have any complaints. not the highest quality materials, but we weren't looking for that since he's still growing."
4.0,"Very nice quality item, that is a direct replica of that in the picture."
4.0,My grandson liked it. Just a bit big for pre-teen
4.0,"Like a lot of the costume jewelry you get from this site - a couple stones were wonky and one lose. Easy enough to fix with some super glue! It's SUPER pretty. Too small for fat necks, so count on needing an extender. Would recommend."
4.0,"This is for my nephew. I'm not sure he'll wear it, but it is pretty cool.  It's a little bigger than I thought it would be (about an inch long).  The board is wider than I feel it should be, but it definitely looks like a skateboard and the leather necklace part is adjustable, so I think it works together perfectly!"
4.0,You can't beat the price
4.0,"Shipping was fairly quick, and I can't tell you how many compliments I because of this skirt when I wore it to work. The elastic on the band is pretty good and it's long - even if you have long legs, it's long, which is nice. The fabric is shiny, but not in an obnoxious way, and it is not thin or see through. The pockets aren't too deep, but it's SO nice to have pockets at all in skirts and dresses these days. I'm 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs and I ordered the medium - fit great. I will definitely be ordering another one soon."
4.0,During the covid pandemic in NY we did not have mask some days in fact we had to wash our mask and reuse I use this mask at work it’s durability is great smells good
4.0,"Really nice romper. The tie doesn’t stay tight or tied for long, but not a real issue. Fit as expected and very cute for summer. Length is perfect"
4.0,It's absolutely gorgeous!!! I'd definitely recommend it but by depending on the person the chain on me felt itchy and on my sister she said it felt fine! But for me since I'm wearing it more I just changed the chain with another one I had. But overall this is really really good product unlike some other things I've gotten on here.
4.0,Sleeve holes were small I have to make a couple snips.
4.0,"The pouch in front is a little too high, but offers good support; they are still very comfortable. I like the color scheme."
4.0,"Bought them for the wife, she loves them! Very comfy (according to her) and fit as expected (according to her). Will update if any issues occur (so no update means all is well!)."
4.0,Good for kids!!
4.0,I like the shirt I was it was little bit longer.
4.0,Perfect fit for my small 12 year old son. Lightweight & comfortable.
4.0,I love this polish cloth. It's really big. It gets the job done and works on heavy duty tarnish.  I'm happy.
4.0,I do bodyflow and Will Power and Grace classes at the gym on hard wood floor and the other class with mats.  These socks are great.  The grippers are good even after a few washes.  They keep my feet warm during class because they are always cold.  They also help to keep the germs away from the bottom of my feet when others are stepping on sweat droplets or whatever is on the floor so it has reduced me getting sick during the winter.  I love them.
4.0,Fit was small. Kinda disappointed in size. Length was ok but it fit really tight around middle. I even ordered a size up. Will try to stretch it out so it fits like a hoodie and not a spandex muscle shirt.<br />Other than the fit..Love it!
4.0,Fair quality but fades.
4.0,"A friend had recommended this backpack to me and I bought it immediately after she told me. This backpack is beautiful and I love every inch of it. As someone who’s obsessed with small backpacks, I’m glad that this one here is spacious and can hold beverages with its outside pockets (something my other ones can’t do). Though I don’t know if this is anything to panic over or turn one away from but I did find a hair clip with a bit of rust on it (can’t tell by the picture) inside the backpack. Must of been left behind or something. The backpack was inside a plastic baggie and had its tags on it by the way.  It’s not a big deal, to me at least but does make me raise questions for some odd reason. Overall, I like this backpack and can’t wait to use it daily."
4.0,"This is a great suit for the price. Like another reviewer, I found that the pads inside the bra are a bit firm and thick - I would have preferred a thinner,  more flexible form. Thankfully, the bra inserts can be removed through a side opening. I am still on the lookout for new inserts. I did need to have the straps taken in about an inch; and also find that I must be cautious, as the little piece of fabric in the &#34;V&#34; of the bra portion does not come up quite as far as I would prefer. (I think new bra inserts will help with this). Altogether, this is such a good quality, pretty suit; and I felt comfortable wearing it on a recent vacation."
4.0,Very nice.  Really don't need a pouch for it.
4.0,Would give 5 star but the material snags pretty easy but with the price and the quantity you can’t beat and super comfortable and great colors too!
4.0,Cute but a little bit on the large size thought they would be more slimming
4.0,its all right
4.0,I ordered this in navy.  It is cute.  I think the style is best for the 30 and under age group.  It is fun and flirty.  I am returning it for that reason alone.
4.0,"I ordered this in XL because that's what I wear in tops.  It fit like it should.  The sleeves are very short, though.  I don't like showing the top of my arms because they are saggy.  These sleeves do NOT cover that.  I would have preferred sleeves that come down close to my elbows.  The rest of the dress fits like it should.  It does hide your middle.  It doesn't really make you look slender though.  Just hangs so rolls don't show!  It comes down past my knees and I am 5'8"" tall.  The fabric is soft t-shirt material.  It's lightweight enough to be cool in the summer.  It appears to be nicely sewn.  You can wash it in the washing machine.  I hang mine to dry."
4.0,"Bought two of these, very comfortable, only wish they had more color options."
4.0,Works great 👍!
4.0,"I love this long sweat shirt, I did have to shorten the sleeves, I have short arms so I cut the sleves off just below the elbow and since it doesn’t have pockets I sewed the portion of sleeves that I cut off and made pockets."
4.0,Not very easy to put on
4.0,Hoping they will send a new net or repair kit to fix holes.  Otherwise it is very nice.  If they make it right I will be very happy with it.
4.0,"The dress is pretty and very comfortable but the dresses I got for me and my daughter do not have the “V” shaped stripes as pictured. The are more of a wave across the dress, not a V."
4.0,"Bought these for my nephew, he loved them, and they are well-made."
4.0,The socks tend to be large. They have a strong grip and do not skid on my yoga mat.
4.0,good supports
4.0,I wish it was a little longer.
4.0,Nice dress but I'm 5 foot 6 and it was above my ankle. I also had a baby a few months ago so it isnt very flattering on my belly area.
4.0,Cute and will be giving as a graduation present for luck. Great price.
4.0,Very simple. I like it to pair with tshirts for a casual look.
4.0,"Most of the Inukshuk jewelry on Amazon, even the expensive ones are incorrectly shaped defeating the purpose. One arm is always blunt and the other pointed. Inukshuk points the way. In the US we use cairns along the trail to mark the trail. A cairn is a pyramid shaped pile of stones. The problem is if you come back from a side trail the cairn will show you the trail, but gives you no idea of which way. With the Inukshuk you either travel in direction of the pointed arm or the blunt arm; hence you always know you are on the trail and if you are going the correct direction. Hiking in northern Canada I found this to be an excellent reassuring idea. On the AT in the states even as well blazed as it is, I have know many experienced backpackers who have returned from a blue blaze (side trail) and turned the wrong way on the white blaze (main AT trail). Much easier to do than you would think.<br />Back to this item. Looks good from the front and has decent weight. Cord is easy to adjust by sliding the barrel (prusik) knots. Lost one star since the back is not solid so it is one sided. I purchased this to replace a hand carved stone one I got on my Canadian backpack that I lost in Maine. I recommend this pendant. I am wearing it now."
4.0,"First, the price of these fun leggings cannot be beat.  They are a little on the thin side, but they have held up through several tough workouts now (I lift, plyo, and cardio).  I get lots of compliments!"
4.0,"The watch is much bigger than I normally wear, I gave it to my daughter and she loves it."
4.0,Wasn’t sure about this one but after wearing for a day... I love these!!!!
4.0,They can be cut a bit shorter if need be so the possibilities are there
4.0,The dress.fot perfectly. It's a hit long pass the knees but it's cute.
4.0,Dealing with plantar fasciitis. These insoles make my work boots bearable.
4.0,Nicely made but just a tad smaller than expected!!
4.0,"These shorts has 2  very long pockets, from your hip bone to 4 inches above your knees.  The  fabric is very slick and heavier than most shorts.  Probably good for bike riding, but I bought them for walking and carrying my phone and keys."
4.0,"Completely inconsistent sizing within the same package. But for us that works. She only needed 1 or 2 for right now, so she will be able to grow into the next sizes progressively.<br /><br />The texture is SUPER SOFT. And if the seem bothers you, which it did for my sensitive child, just wear them inside out. ;)"
4.0,"Love this necklace, I always get compliments!"
4.0,"Robeez are great and these are just one of many that we have in our ""collection"". They are great because of the  Holiday theme: having a little red and green for most outfits to match. We love them."
4.0,"Bought for a gift, a bit smaller than I expected and felt somewhat “flimsy”.  They were cute tho and came with extra backs(2 styles)."
4.0,Like the bag. The toggle closure is awkward. The crocodile finish looks good. The bag is not too heavy and I really like the cross body strap.
4.0,"Personal reasons, and it fits but I had to keep putting the jacket down because I am tall."
4.0,My wife loved the look of the glasses and she said they didn't feel bad. Her only complaint is that the glasses are completely flat so they don't contour like typical glasses. Fashion wise they look great but not so much for blocking the sun due to them being flat.
4.0,Love this dress and so do my friends. Received several compliments the 2 times I wore it
4.0,"I have large breast and a long torso, I usually have to size up one size because of this. It is not necessary in this shirt style. I bought a xxl which usually just comes to the top of my pubic area on my torso, this shirt however covers my butt.<br /><br />The material is soft, the color is duller than shown, but otherwise it is a cute shirt. Because of my sizing error it is a night shirt, but if I had ordered a xl I would definitely be wearing this around town."
4.0,"I bough it as a gift to my niece, and she was so happy."
4.0,This reall does work as advertise
4.0,Although a little small and snug in the butt area.  They are very comfortable.
4.0,Husband loves these lighter weight cargo sweatpants. Perfect fit for him.
4.0,"I ordered this was and it came in PERFECT condition and right on time, except, the battery was dead... Now I'm not a watch expert but I thought they usually came already working. Just an annoying set back because now I have to buy a battery for the already $60 watch."
4.0,Great glasses just wish the frames were bigger
4.0,My grandson loved this shirt
4.0,"I love the soft feel of this.<br />The fit is mostly as expected, it's roomy and not a tight fit.  However,  this picture is after washing, the neck seems to droop a bit and doesn't lie flat.<br />The color is a bit lighter than in the product picture and some of the white flecks that are part of, I thought at first were dust or strings hanging loose.<br />It's a very nice around the house comfort tee shirt.  Soft and large enough to be part of jammies."
4.0,Great fit. Awesome colors. One pair did have a small scratch on the lens when I recieved them. But no other flaws or issues. Good buy!
4.0,"Is a tight fit for one size fits all, but stayed on throughout the evening! Has stretchy section to ensure fit, and looks great! Had many compliments!"
4.0,"Good for what I needed it for, I have a big head so it was a little tight but not bad."
4.0,Wasn't as wide as I expected
4.0,"36G and doesn't quite cover the ladies, but practically no one makes something that does, so I'm keeping it. Other shock absorbers keep things more firmly in place but this will be comfortable enough for my lazy jogs."
4.0,Fit just right love the product
4.0,"If your goal is to show some flirty behind and have them quickly removed, perfect. Uncomfortable for more than a few minutes and roll prone... But, this is essentially lingerie so long term wear is not necessary."
4.0,Nice shoe .. fits tight at first
4.0,"Nice card sleeve. Well made. Holds cards well. The leather is a bit too thick, however, and this makes the bottom too bulky where the two sides are folded over. I much prefer the Anson Calder brand card sleeve, which is made of incredibly thin, but supple and strong, leather, although those are naturally more expensive than this model."
4.0,"Nice leather, soft lining.  Runs small"
4.0,These fit Summit small at first but then they stretch out a little bit. They're very well-insulated.
4.0,"What I expected to get, satisfied with purchase."
4.0,"I loved this watched when I first got it. It looked very nice and worked wonderfully. It looks far more expensive than it actually is and i received many compliments on it. The only problem was that after about 2 weeks the mechanism that et me wind it and after that I could only change the time when I turned the spindle. The reason why I gave it such a high rating despite that was because I emailed the seller about the problem and they immediately agreed to replace it. I was tempted to post 3 stars though, because the shipping to get it there was about $12....<br />My advice?<br />handle with care."
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter. She loves it, it very thin though."
4.0,"First, these are not so much socks in the traditional sense as they are sweaters for your feet. They're knit of a heavier yarn like a sweater, fuzzy and warm on the inside, and surprisingly thick. I'd been thinking of them as a good cool weather hiking sock when I ordered, but they are so thick that my hiking boots (or any other shoe) won't fit over them comfortably unless I want to buy a half-size larger shoe to accommodate the socks. I won't be doing that.<br /><br />Instead, I'll likely re-purpose these to be excellent winter foot warmers for around the house. My feet in these will still fit into a pair of leather slide sandals that I often wear, or into an older pair of scuffs, and with keeping the heat down to conserve energy these will be a welcome addition come winter. Right now (August) they would be too warm to wear.<br /><br />Size-wise the large fit my size 10.5 to 11 foot just fine. They're pretty stretchy and would probably fit a somewht larger foot well too, but on a much smaller foot they might be too loose. If you are a 9 or smaller, I'd order the medium. They are not especially tight elastic-wise, so I'd have some question over how well they would stay up in hiking boots or shoes, which might cause them to slide down and bunch in the shoe. For my new purposes they will be just fine."
4.0,love the style and the fit
4.0,"I love the soft washable fabric. The top was smaller in proportion to the bottom which I didn't love for my body type, but it works for jammies."
4.0,"As others have mentioned, there is an odd smell that goes away within a day or two.  Nice bag set.  The old style keychain holder is cheesy but I didn't order the set for that item.  The other 5 pieces do not disappoint."
4.0,"These are cute sunglasses! I have definitely added them to my rotation. Comfy. I think you get what you pay for, so not super durable like $150 sunglasses, but not the worst for the cost either."
4.0,"This is what I was expecting. The only downside is that the neck hole is a little stretched out/big, and the shirt itself definitely runs big. I'm 5'2, 145 pounds, & I got a medium and it was big on me."
4.0,"Adorable sunglasses, just writing a review so people don’t immediately put them on and cut themselves like I did! Super sharp ends!"
4.0,Nice comfortable slippers for a good price.
4.0,The color and photo are accurate but there are NOT sleeves as the photo shows. It's more of a poncho. I would size up for an oversized feel.
4.0,"Bought the wallet as a gift to my brother. He loved it ! Its a very stylish but yet clean design. He loved how slim it was, very easily fit in his front pocket. I would recommend this wallet!"
4.0,All did good
4.0,"I was skeptical at first to order these, bc with jewelry online...hey you never know. But I actually love these earrings! They look great and are a steal for the price! I wear them regularly and am happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Okay I love this coverup! It was very very long on me (I’m kind of petite so nothing crazy for me) but I had to tie up the straps on my shoulders to make it fit okay. Then I thought I’d dry it for a short time to shrink it up a bit and it’s smaller than a crop top now so don’t make my mistakes! It’s very cute! Just a bit long on the straps
4.0,"I purchased for the patterns—the black with the white/silvery floral is my favorite, and my set also came with a swirly pattern and one with paw prints. Easy to attach to my Fitbit; came with the little metal hinges. I wear my Fitbit constantly, so after about three months of exercise, swimming, showering, and sweating in the Texas heat, the plastic “hinge” sort of degraded and came apart from the band itself. Only reason I didn’t give it five stars. But for the price, it’s not a big deal—and I love the pattern so much that I’ll probably buy it again."
4.0,This kaftan is absolutely beautiful. The fabric is high quality in a jewel tone with perfect ankle length (I am 5'8&#34; tall) and ample size (I am 2X). The price is especially attractive and is available in many different colors and designs.
4.0,So this cute isn’t super tight only thing I did not like is that the strings were not on so you spend a minute putting them on. I got an xl and I just didn’t like how it fit on me so I pulled it up and it went eked fine
4.0,Beautiful dress and a little bit loose but that’s but my wife love it.
4.0,Size XL.  Really like the dress got what i order. Material is light and fresh for summer.  The thing with this material is that is really see through so i will have to find a camisole to wear under.
4.0,these cami tank tops go great under anything they are a spandex material and the lace is kind of hard to stretch I did get holes from stretching too much but other than that they’re really cute tank tops.
4.0,Nice shirts however run very small all over.
4.0,"This crystal set is beautiful worth the price. Gave as present for 37 yr old daughter she was so excited loved opening the bags up but got to the raw green Aventurine an busted in pieces, then the polished Red Jasper was broke so disappointed, other then that others were beautiful."
4.0,"One star because it was cute but docked stars because one leg is bigger for some reason??? I bought it and it said sold by Line Friends so I don’t know if it was a dud or what. So disappointed :/<br /><br />Update: I was sent a replacement that arrived quickly and does not appear to be a dud. Much happier now, I recommend buying, however if you get a dud like I did don’t hesitate to get a replacement :) I changed the one gold star to one star docked for the purpose of the first Koya I received."
4.0,"The good: These Vitelli gloves are stylish, look great, fit well, and are incredibly soft and comfortable to wear.  They do run a bit small, though.  I found I had to order one size larger than my usual size.  They perform as advertised, allowing you to do some basic operations on a touch-screen device.  I would not try typing on a tiny smart phone keyboard while wearing these, or any gloves, but it's certainly very convenient to be able to unlock your phone and check text messages or read email without removing your gloves.<br /><br />The only thing preventing me from giving them a perfect 5-star rating is that they're not as warm as I'd have hoped or expected.  They're fine down to 45 or 50 degrees, but not below that.  Walking for 10 minutes in 35 degree weather while wearing these gloves, they didn't offer much protection from the cold.  But for all spring and fall weather they're outstanding gloves at a pretty reasonable price."
4.0,I love the way they fit and make my legs feel
4.0,"the comment I read was right. this is incredibly comfortable , I just wish it has more pockets to put cell phone & wallet"
4.0,"Gorgeous colour, comfortable fabric.<br />Upon trial: Size down, shorter then in imagined (I’m 5’9 and it’s not as long as I hoped) - Maybe it’ll stretch in length if I wear it throughout the day."
4.0,"The fit is awesome.  Very comfortable.  However,  I'm not a fan of the screws in the front so I only wear them in my car lol.  But very comfortable."
4.0,"I’m 5’3, 34C and 25 waist. This dress is too big for me, but cute enough for me to have it altered around the torso."
4.0,I like the feel.
4.0,"Nice quality for the price, color is nice too. It was just thinner than I thought or wanted, so I wound up returning it. BUt there was nothing actually wrong with the hat!"
4.0,"Really cute shirt. Unfortunately the XL was too small for me by far so I gave it to my little sister (both chronologically and physically) who states she loves the shirt. It's made out of thin material that looks nice on her. I am a US 16-18 and think this is probably meant for a size 10-12.<br />I hate my upper arms and love the look of the 3/4 length sleeve.<br />I would recommend buying up a size, otherwise super cute casual top."
4.0,Good cloth.
4.0,"Stylish, inexpensive, and a great statement earring.  The first time I wore them, I did lose a back, only noticing when the earring ended up in my lap.  However, I received several extra backs included with the purchase, so it wasn't an issue at all.  Have worn several times since with no problems.  Perhaps it was just my error the first time I wore them.  I recommend!"
4.0,So cute. I love the rubber soles
4.0,Wonderful dress! I just had to hem it because it was to my ankles and that's way too much plaid for me.
4.0,"Used this for the repair of my 12 year old sons &#34;dress&#34; watch strap.  Selected it for the ease of adjustment, and his growth.  Was not disappointed."
4.0,"My granddaughter wanted a ""time turner"" necklace and this was the nicest one I found for a reasonable price. Everything about it is great, except the chain is quite short.  She's only 10 yrs old so hopefully it won't be a problem. It comes in a lovely pouch, inside a nice black box, so it makes an impressive gift. I'm sure she'll love it. (This is NOT fine jewelry - it's very nice costume jewelry!)"
4.0,"I really like this style shirt dress, however, it fit a little smaller than I expected."
4.0,"The pattern is beautiful and the cut is super sexy.  It covers my wrinkly belly after two babies but shows off my tattooed back exactly like I wanted.  It's a little short in the front but not unwearable.  The butt is a little snug, I have to pull it lower on my butt and the back is so small that my crack is close to showing but it doesn't.  Overall it's a great bathing suit, my husband loves it!"
4.0,Super comfy! Perfect beach dress.
4.0,"Not quite as full and flowered as pictured and very sheer, but it's still a beauty, especially for the price!"
4.0,This watch was bought for my 6 year old for bladder issues. It works great. Vibrates long enough for even an active 6 year old to notice. Only issue is that the writing on the watch was small and I had a difficult time seeing it when setting the watch.
4.0,"Bought as a placeholder until I can get a sturdier one to arrive. Surprisingly holds up pretty well. I mean, I can feel it's limit whenever I pull on it, but it's for symbolic use more than practical right now."
4.0,"Fits great, is as advertised, can be worn for a day without irritation and I have sensitive skin."
4.0,Pretty dress but I sent it back because it’s just a bit too narrow in the shoulders for me.
4.0,Love the sunglassed
4.0,It was very good quality but didn’t fit my body type well
4.0,"I ordered this product like 2 weeks ago and now it's here, love the shipping service. The zebra one is a bit shorter than the leopard one but already expected from reading the reviews and i'm fine with that. The zebra one length is at my hips and i'm a 5'3 (did not wrap, only hang on neck equally). The leopard one reaches my upper part of the thighs. The materials not bad but it's not as soft as i expected. Highly recommend for good deal and quality. DO NOT expect these as winter scarves, just for fashion and cool weather."
4.0,These made a fun Christmas gift.  Kind of a strange material but still cute.
4.0,stretchy and good for one season wear.
4.0,It was surprisingly petite
4.0,"Bought these and another style shorts from the same brand. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 122. I ordered the 4/6 Small, and they fit great. After washing, they had very little shrinkage. I'm happy with these shorts and ordered a pair of jeans from the same seller."
4.0,Awesome shirt the color is perfect for what I wanted.
4.0,"I'm very happy with this bag. I needed something larger than my leather purse for a day spent out of the house and it had to be a crossbody. Pros: extremely lightweight; hides dirt; can hold a windbreaker, my normal purse contents and a shopping bag or two. Cons: I wouldn't hate if the strap were wider and it only has a single small pocket inside, so finding things can be a drag. I'm going to get an organizer to go inside."
4.0,Just what I ordered.. it's cute as a bug thank you so much I'm sure I'll get lots of compliments at our witches brew party
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Appears to be cut a little wide, but still wearable. Very nice."
4.0,"Cute, but the bottoms were about 2 sizes smaller."
4.0,"Nice well made sock. A bit pricey, but I have a teenage son with foot problems, and these help keep his feet from sweating and causing odor and itching."
4.0,"I already owned a pair of these leggings and absolutely love them so I figured I'd purchase another. When I got them in the mail and tried them on, they were a little snug and didn't fit exactly like the other pair I have. Seeing as I'm almost 6 foot tall, I thought that could be the issue. I've worn them to the gym and just around the house to maybe stretch them to the way my body is, it seems to be working to me!"
4.0,Very cute dress for the Daughter/Princess. Wife love it so I guess I did good. Nice for those hot summer days.
4.0,"The design is kind of hard to make out, but they're so cool that I don't care. Thick too! Maybe a little tight around the calves though. I'm sure they'll loosen up over time."
4.0,Thinner than thermal underwear used to be but these are very well made and a bargain.
4.0,"The back zippered pocket is too shallow, the hotel electronic key doesn't fit. Otherwise fine."
4.0,very happy with the navy blue color. looks cute with jeans not bulky. wear a large and ordered a large perfect fit.
4.0,So cute! But give me blisters after 30 minutes.
4.0,This pocket watch has a classic look and feel. I like the design on the front cover.
4.0,"The names were very small, hard to read. But the ring is beautiful."
4.0,"Looks great. Comfortable.  But like others on here said, its hard to get the top over my head.  I'm not good at sewing so I won't be able to do what one of the other reviewers was able to do.  (Looked nice)  But I'll figure something out because I really like it."
4.0,I just got these today and I love them!!! They are perfectly classy with an edge! Definitely adds pazaz with my short hair! The only thing I was a little bummed about what the ones I was most excited for didn’t fit in my ears! They have a lip on them and are so hard to push through. I just ended up taking the Jewels off and hot gluing them to different plugs that offered the twist on back bam! Over all these were a perfect purchase and I would definitely order again!
4.0,"Nice little watch and was a hit at our Christmas party for the recipient. Was within our little price range, so it was well worth it."
4.0,"These were great accessories to my  60""s costume.  Although the glasses are a bit hard to see through, they looked great."
4.0,Don't think they are bite proof. Hard to handle snake with metal nubs on hand. Slips very easy
4.0,Soft. Fit nicely. Good quality for the price.
4.0,Lightweight comfortable and cute perfect summer dress
4.0,"So after purchasing two months, two weeks & 3 days after posting this review I brutally beat this thing, ran it through a bunch of pools, rivers, & beaches, sanding it down on pavement, & slashing it with a sharp knife gave it a couple scratches doing so (obviously if you stab it it'll break) but ill be damed it still lasts me through the paces till this day. For only a meal at fast food restaurant & maybe less you can get a great valued wallet with rfid blocking (I've tried to scam my own card & didn't even go through on other people's scamming machines) & subjectively stylish not to mention extra slim tight to keep money safe is crazy great value. Only criticism is how tight the side pockets are in the last picture but thats just me knit picking great bucks spent, gonna buy another one cause I saw the new carbon fiber option is available now, they're budget friendly so even worth a second buy"
4.0,"Very nice driving gloves.  Well sized.  Thin, and yet warm even up here in the mountains.  They grip well, to the point of being a little sticky on the steering wheel or a metal doorknob.  The only downside (and you can just see this on the model) is that each glove has a round metal advertisement with the company name on the glove.  If you don't mind advertising every day for the manufacturer, you'll be happy with these.  I wish they had put their logo on a tab or tag that I could cut out of the glove.  That's the only drawback."
4.0,"Nice product, very fast shipping"
4.0,"I bought this for my mechanic husband as it is dangerous to wear typical wedding rings in his field. He has had no qualms at all and wears it on a daily basis. The only thing I'd recommend is maybe some truer sizing. We ordered him the 9 which was way too big (but is the size he normally wears) and got him the 8 and it's still a little big, but not enough of a problem to return it."
4.0,"I ordered this vest for my mother for Christmas in a medium. She definitely wears a medium, but it was way too small. So, we returned and got a large..still too small and the zipper was broken. She really liked the vest, so we ordered an extra large and it fits just right. She is very happy with the front and back warming features."
4.0,These were nice my only desire is that they needed to be bigger and possibly more durable
4.0,"Larger cups beware: This will not cover a strapless bra of c-cup size.  Note too that this has no support.  All that being said, well made and way cute!"
4.0,"Perfect size for a toddler- band has withheld a week, seems sturdy enough that it’s not going to snap."
4.0,I don't really like the fabric but it's cute. the shirt is pretty short too.
4.0,"This is a very nice corset top. Love the design and the color. The fastenings at the front can easily be knocked open, that's the only thing I don't like.<br />I am 34-30-39 measurements and bought an XL based on the reviews and size chart. The bust is a slight bit too loose but the rest of it fit well. I think the XL is best suited to a person that typically fits into medium clothing or a small large by US standards."
4.0,Si tal cual como la foto!
4.0,just what we hoped it would be
4.0,Love these bifocals. Just a bit large but overall I hate having half lenses sliding down my nose. It really ages a person.
4.0,"Lovely necklace but I had to repair it when it arrived one of the jump rings had broken and I had to replace it, otherwise I love the piece."
4.0,"The bottoms appear less diaper-y than they appear in the photos. They were difficult to pull over my hips and I heard a thread snap, but once I got them up, they were a little small but fit well otherwise. I got a small, but definitely should have done a medium. I'm hoping they'll stretch out in the water a little."
4.0,"I’m 5’3” and busty, usually wear a women’s size10/12 in dresses (41/ 33/ 41)and the XL barely fit me, but it’s a gorgeous dress and I wore it for family pics.  Construction and fabric were better than I expected."
4.0,"It’s a nice dress for the money. I think it runs small, I had to order a n XXL because I wear a 40 DD bra."
4.0,"These aviators are very nice quality. They are sturdy, they don’t slide around on my face when I bend over as some sunglasses do.  The only issue is that the glasses are difficult to return to case- they will only fit in one certain direction. I remedied this issue by using an old case I had from a previous set of sunglasses."
4.0,"Light weight, comfortable for around the house at this time of the year. Sized correctly, M as the chart says. Washes great. Just ordered 2 more! Don’t like the shipping cost!"
4.0,"The mask was a gift, My granddaughter loved the mask"
4.0,Nice looking<br />Very Sharp..
4.0,"I bought the mint color and hoped it was as pretty as the photos. I was happy that the photo was a close depiction of the color. I got a larger size because I wanted it to be roomy and comfortable. It's lightweight so it's not something you'd wear in the dead of winter, but perfect for fall, spring, and beginning of winter. Fits pretty close to the size chart, if you're wondering. I checked it before purchasing because I'm leery of sizing with off brands. I'm 5'5, 108 pounds with a 32 inch bust and I got a medium."
4.0,"I love the funky colors.  I'm constantly losing my readers - they are either in my purse, in the car, left them in the kitchen when I'm on the other side of the house.  So I use these and keep one pair in the master suite, and one in the living room and one in my office.  they work well if you are focused on a single item, but if you have to jump from one subject/scene to another, they are not so great.  For my purpose, they are great.  The colors stand out and I can always find them!"
4.0,"Do not purchase this and expect a dress that you can stroll the mall in - I mean unless you like a cool breeze up your butt. This is however, the perfect beach coverup, tunic for leggings or an at home lounging dress. The fabric is so soft and comfortable, the shape is flattering but the stomach area clings a little bit. I'm normally a s/m, and purchased a large so I can wear with leggings.<br /><br />Quality is great, not thin and cheapy at all. Definitely a great buy for us legging lovers!"
4.0,Looks great and comfortable to wear
4.0,it runs large. my boots are 7 but i ordered a small instead of the medium guidelines.<br />quality and price are ok and reasonable.
4.0,Sturdy glasses. They fit my &#34;pin&#34; head nicely!
4.0,I love it!  I just wish the waistband was a little wider
4.0,"This is very nice but not a perfectly finished leather key-holder. There were some dings in the leather. On the one hand, who cares. It will be living in my pocket and my purse. On the other, sometimes we give things as gifts and want them to look perfect on the first glance, even knowing they will be destroyed with regular use. Overall, this is a great key-holder/key-chain, it just isn't perfect in terms of presentation. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
4.0,Grandson picked these out for the captain America charm. It came with 3 charms all were too small for the holes in the shoes. Might want to size down .
4.0,I like that it is stainless because I don't have to polish it.
4.0,Beautiful but difficult to keep in place on face. Worked better after bending it a bit.
4.0,"Swimsuits come in a variety of dimensions , difficult to find a one piece especially made for you, requires fitting various upper and lower torso...<br />Can not fit all body types.  I am tall and slender, top fit well but found this one to have plenty of booty, more than I needed<br />It will work for someone! Well made.  Will make a great purchase for those with the need for this type of fit."
4.0,"Ok, so I am a petite lady in my 20s with 3 great kids.. I have been on the hunt for a modest and covering swimsuit but cute! This swimsuit looked the part...I am 5'2&#34; and 105 lbs however I wear a medium in bottoms because my hips are a little wider.  I am very small in my bust, chest are...like 32,34 A...yea I know.. so when I got the size medium.it fit perfect everywhere else but my chest it was huge!! I mean bend over and the swimsuit was so saggy because I had nothing to fill!! So upsetting. I had to go through 3 people to sew it for me and well it finally worked!! I will figure out how to post pic later...but if you are small busted you will have to sew to alert you..but now I am sooooooo excited and pleased very happy and feel great!!"
4.0,Beautiful but I had to return it because it just didn't look good on me. I would recommend it though :)
4.0,"It is a little big on my 11 year old and 8 year old, but it is as advertised. It works"
4.0,"I purchased 3 colors all in size XL. I'd say the sizes are more comparable to juniors and not women's. I wear size 10 women's jeans and have a 36C bra size and the XL fit perfectly. Comfortable across the chest, hem hugged my hips but not tightly. If you have a larger chest size, the top portion above the pleats might be a bit tight. The fabric is a nice soft modal or rayon spandex which hangs nicely with plenty of stretch. With the hem sitting at the hips or just below and not pulled down tight it sort of &#34;puffs&#34; out and hides my lumps and bumps. The straps are not adjustable. The top came really wrinkled so the pleats were all out of position but hopefully a wash and steam will get out the wrinkles. The only lighter color I purchased was antique pink which wasn't too sheer if a skin tone bra is worn. Overall they were a great buy at about $5 each and I'd buy more colors if I didn't already own similar tops."
4.0,Fits and feels amazing.  But kinda $$$$$
4.0,Only fits 1 pair of glasses!
4.0,"I wear a woman's size 9.5. I ordered a small. It's too small. Fortunately, I can give it to my son to wear when we practice sparring. The cuff around the ankle is very tight, even on my son's leg. However, the sock itself seems very well made with re-enforced stitching and padded footbed. My son says it's very easy to pivot for kicks with these on. I think when I ordered the right size for myself, these will be just what I need."
4.0,"I kinda like these socks. I originally was less than impressed by them but having worn them awhile now, I've kinda grown to like them. I didn't think they were thick enough at first but they are fine. Much better than the hospital socks I have known, these are pretty soft and cozy. I like the heather material  and the tread is more comfortable than a bunch of little bumps like on other socks."
4.0,Nice jacket. True to size.<br />shipping took a while but still cane sooner than expected delivery date.
4.0,Really enjoy this bracelet a little shinier than I expected very lightweight but they did say it was hollow has an adjustable class but is a little small I have tiny wrists so it fits me great I even ordered another one for my daughter and bought a second one similar to it from the same company and reordered that one for my daughter when it came I was pleased with it too
4.0,"The pants are a beautiful fabric that is soft. Very loose and flowy. I am 150 and 5’7, size small fit"
4.0,"The arch support is not as pronounced as I expected it to be, but it is comfortable.  For my feet, the strap that goes across my 5th toes is not placed well - it is too far forward and barely secures my little toes (I'd tried a pair belonging to a friend, who wears 1 size smaller, and it seemed a good fit except in length).  The width is a shade narrower than expected for a medium width.  If I had not gotten this pair on sale, I would be sorely disappointed, as an extended walk might prove uncomfortable. That being said, the sandals are especially comfortable for walking or standing on concrete and tiled floors, such as while shopping or cooking."
4.0,"the waste tummy control isnt so tight you cant breath., these leggings are very comfortable in cool or warm weather. they let your skin breath. I worked out in the them and i was fine and i wore them as just casual part of an outfit and both ways were comfrotable."
4.0,"I love the length. And I am 5'8"" (149lbs) FYI. I got the Medium, the only thing I don't like is the sleeve length, however I have issues with a lot of long sleeves."
4.0,Dress is being used for a little red riding hood costume. It's perfect!
4.0,Nice shirt just think the hair should be cleaner.  The color of her hair looked like it had been washed a few time already.
4.0,I like the dress it is what I expected. It was a good holiday dress.
4.0,"Snug and flattering fit, but the sleeves were too long. High quality and comfortable though I sent it back."
4.0,"It is a good deal for what you get.  The strap is sturdy but a little on the light side.  Tools are really handy.  The only thing I don't like is the band flap holders (two of them) scrape against the desk or laptop when I lean on them.  Not really a fault, just a description of how it is made.  Otherwise it is a good band and I use it regularly (just take it off when I type)."
4.0,I’m 5’1 so these joggers were a little longer on me then I would prefer but that normal. I loved the legging material with the fit of sweatpants. Mh only wish was these hit me just slightly higher at the ankle.
4.0,"Love it, but very &#34;stiff&#34;"
4.0,A great inexpensive watch that looks good. Seems to keep great time!
4.0,Good for formal occasions.
4.0,"Super cute shirt but the color is off. It's sage, which is not close to dark green. It's nice and stretchy with a little ruching at the bottom."
4.0,Haven't tried it on yet Christmas gift but I like it.
4.0,Nice dress for the money.
4.0,I like the fabric and how it skims the body
4.0,The band seems a lil cheap but I am wearing it everyday and it is great
4.0,"The belts are a perfect accessory. I was pleasantly surprised for the price. The add a nice touch to outfits. The silver one is good but it feels loose on me. It stays clipped on though. It's still cute and the belt can be used. Overall, I enjoy both belts and I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,good quality bag
4.0,"These glasses are adorable.  They may not be the best quality frames or lenses, but they are very good for this price."
4.0,"I ordered the cold shoulder beach coverup dress. It is black with silver metallic threads throughout the shawl. It actually is a wrap with 3 holes. (One for your head and the other 2 for your arms or shoulders depending on how you wear it) Overall I was extremely pleased. It is very versatile and how you can wear it. You can wear it many ways.<br />1. like a poncho with your shoulders exposed.<br />2. Off a shoulder<br />3. ALMOST off both shoulders<br />4. Under one arm and on the other shoulder<br />5. You can make it short to only cover your top or arrange it where it covers your full suit.<br />6. You can use the side holes for your shoulders or arms. Both give different looks.<br />The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />You can use as a beach coverup or with a formal dress. It has silver metallic threads to create a more dressy look.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars only because it is easy to catch it on your rings, jewelry or even fingernails if not perfectly smooth.<br /><br />Overall, a gorgeous versatile piece for any wardrobe!<br /><br /> I'm 5'2&#34;, 135lbs, 32DD, Short Torso, 32-28-35<br /><br />I DID NOT get this for a discount. I paid full price. This is my opinion. Please make your own conclusion abt it."
4.0,"As other have noted, some of these do not work.  In my case I had 8 out of 40 that did not work.  For the price, this doesn't bother me.<br /><br />If you need at least 40 working items, buy a second  pack."
4.0,no picture
4.0,"I picked up a body shaper without lace, and now that option is not available for sale. However,  I will review what ai ordered and how it arrived.<br /> The shaper has some tummy control, though not a lot. The bottom, where it clips, is very narrow and feels uncomfortable without an underwear.The section for the breasts is not a bra, and allows texture to be seen through it. So you need a bra under this. Overall, it does the job, but the whole getup doesn't look flattering. Once the shirt and pants are on, it's okay,  but I wish it looked a little different underneath."
4.0,"If the actual design wouldn't be my first pick, the colors are truly lovely.  I fold my scarves for use, so the design really doesn't matter and the colors match a couple of items in my wardrobe perfectly.  With the surprisingly low price for a nice scarf, I'd recommend it to others."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:474c70bef830b41f85033450275f8723]] Super cute and just as pictured. The pumpkins are a little heavy and the material covering the headband is very soft so it slides off easily. I’ll have to find a way to make it stay, but otherwise love how cute this is 🎃😊"
4.0,"Though these are cute earrings they are fairly hard to get on, especially if you have on nails. I also would not wear these to sleep as they may cut or dig into the ears. Other then that I love them!"
4.0,"Comfortable and soft. Too long for a 5'3"""
4.0,"Love the design, but wish I could bend it just a bit so I could fasten it without help. Still, a great accessory"
4.0,"Motivational ring. Nice and sturdy. But,  I had to have my jewelry smooth out the edges for me. It was hurting my fingers. Now, I love. Great reminder."
4.0,prompt and accurate matterial a bit rough
4.0,"It's a very nice piece, although it was bigger than I expected.  It's about a foot tall, and will definitely hold plenty of earrings.  I needed an item like this, because my earrings end up in a pile and tangled.  This is good to hold all types, hoops, studs, and dangly earrings."
4.0,Fits well. Fast shipping. Very low cut wearing a bra will be difficult
4.0,"I bought it for my girl, and she looks beatiful in it"
4.0,"I like these a lot as they look pretty, my only problem is the backs tend to slide off easily so I have to push them back every so often"
4.0,"It looks so great and the size is perfect for my daughter , but the plastic is so light and poorly made it could break by dropping a soccer ball for instance. I would not buy it again."
4.0,I love this purse and the color.  Only problem is the buckle sticks.  I have to really pull hard to get it open.
4.0,This outfit was absolutely  Amazing! My only issue was the tube top. I’m petite and small boobs so the top fit me pretty large so I had to use another top. The pants weren’t tight on me but I liked the loose short look. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Feel good to wear. If they make 3x or 4x , that be great."
4.0,Looks prettt good! Was hoping the red would be a little brighter and the rubber was a little thicker but it looks good and stays on tight.
4.0,Great charm but bought for wrong application. It's flat with a spring to open it. Not what I needed for my round bracelet.
4.0,I received 61 pcs - very good color and consistent size and structure. Well made - I only wish there were more pairs.
4.0,This bracelet is well made.  I would have given five stars except that I paid extra for the smaller size and it came in a small zip lock bag.  I am giving it as a gift and for the price I think it should have come in a box.
4.0,Good product and more than a fair value.  My wife likes the fact the band stretches and is easy to put on and take off.  It certainly looks more elegant on her than on the website.
4.0,Nice - just as described.  A good dress for school.  I'll add a shrug.
4.0,Pros<br />- Price<br />- Durable<br />- Very easy to install<br /><br />Cons<br />- N/A
4.0,"a very 'zen' bracelet to be sure! I'm partial to leather and silver combos, and this filled the bill. The only negative is after getting in on, it's almost impossible to adjust without using your teeth to hold one end of the pull. Once adjusted, though, it works fine! It is high quality."
4.0,"Clearly, white shoes are not going to hold up during a muddy soccer season, but my daughter loved them, and they did make it through the season!"
4.0,"Overall they seem decent, especially given the price. The sizing says 3-12 yrs, but I wouldn't buy for ages under 5 or 6. The rubberized coating is nice. Color does not match the advertised images. Ordered the orange expecting a bright pair like shown in the pictures but received a very light orange sherbet ish color."
4.0,The Turtleneck does not stretch enough for my body type. Material is soft but doesn't fit comfortably for me.
4.0,I needed to add some ties to keep it on my head in the wind.  The crown was somewhat small.
4.0,It looks exactly as advertised and the quality is good for the price.
4.0,Great choice for a simple mens mask for our masquerade party. I wore lace and black and he matched me perfectly. Sturdy and good for the night!
4.0,"Very nice ring,<br />I just wish they would make them in 1/2 sizes.<br />Im a 10.5 so the 11 floats around more than i like.<br />Other than that i do like it."
4.0,Reliable and warm but the mouth piece takes a trick of clipping it on wrong to be of any use personally.
4.0,Fits okay but inside material has already ripped
4.0,Niece loved it. Material makes her very hot though!
4.0,"Very nice strap - better be for the price, lol (would have given it five stars had it had more reasonable pricing)"
4.0,"Looks pretty nice on my moto 360. But I had to remove a few links to get it to fit, which would be fine but even with the tool removing the pins is incredibly difficult."
4.0,I'm only 5'1 so the dress was long but I wore shorter heels and still was able to make it work and it turned out perfect for the night!  Very comfortable too!
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL... BEAUTIFUL... BEAUTIFUL...!!!  The only reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars, was I wish they would've been a little Bigger..."
4.0,"The socks are fine. I wish they were a little thicker, but overall they are fine. I will definitely use them on my son."
4.0,"My elder daughter had to wear regular glasses, so younger wants to have her own. So younger started picking elder's glasses. I decided to go with empty designed glassed, so that she won't pick elder's. That worked for two to three days. Then again same story. I feel this is little costlier for the materiel, but I like the design so much. Kids try to wear and make fun based on the choice. Overall it's good product to have."
4.0,its a pretty ring
4.0,Bought this just to wear to Astoria for The Goonies 30th anniversary. Got lots of compliments!
4.0,"I really like the overall style and fit of these shorts. Fabric seems to be of good quality. The only recommendation I would have is to have at least 1 zipper pocket. Other than that, they are a solid pair of workout shorts. I will buy again."
4.0,button hole is too big for the button keeps opening  up.
4.0,"It fits in the taco, but it doesn’t fits perfectly. In the corner stay with a little space"
4.0,It is very beautiful and delicate. Great as a gift.
4.0,It's comfy but bendable and easily gets fingerprints
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, I like the packaging and fast delivery. The earrings were not easy to put on and did not feel secure. I wore them for about 4 hours before the discomfort of the “stick” that holds the earring in place was too much. I love the design and the earrings are super light. I’m keeping them because I’m going to attempt to find a better way to keep them on."
4.0,Absolutely love this color though. Very bold and bright for spring/summer!
4.0,"Nice, but were bigger than what I wanted."
4.0,"Skirt fits perfect around the waste, but was a little too long. Overall, it a great outfit."
4.0,"The feel and quality of this pram seem good, however, I will be unable to provide long term feedback.  The size 9 month is snug on my 8 month old baby and like another reviewer mentioned there isn't much stretch.  So, back it will have to go as it seems to run small.  I would note a few things.  I didn't read the written description so I wasn't aware of the magnetic closures down the front; it's not mentioned in the featured bullet points.  So, that was a little surprising.  It's a neat concept but has me wondering if it would stay closed if a baby was tugging at itself.  Lastly, I quickly noticed the built in mittens meet the sleeve precisely and do not offer any overlap.  So, there would be an open slit at the wrist, which is not helpful in cold New England weather.  Overall, it is an adorable pram minus my findings."
4.0,Was great material but had to be hemmed. It was too long.
4.0,"Its comfy and warm. It's a nice hoodie. I'm tall and skinny, I got the xl and it fits nice, but is a little short. I prefer my jackets to be longer. Also I was expecting black and red, but its actually navy and red. Not a big fan of the navy.... but it's still a good hoodie, it will keep me warm with the temperature starting to drop."
4.0,Nice shirt and good fit. Decent quality for the price. A known brand and met those expectations. It didn't blow me away in any aspect and found if I try to wear the shirt and the shorts together I feel like I'm wearing pajamas. Otherwise another shirt for the regular rotation.
4.0,Large felt more like a medium so it kept on slipping or rolling down from the waist. I was about to return it but had my daughter tried them on to see if she liked the fit. She said they were a lil tight but she liked them so I decided to just give them to her.
4.0,For for a gift for a cyclist . Great and funky style. Super rad and great price  I would recomend
4.0,If fit just right
4.0,Kinda small for adults but they are nice glasses
4.0,"Fit true to size. Came with a small hole on the seam, that’s why 4 stars. Otherwise cute!"
4.0,Doesn't have the &#34;women's shape&#34; I expected; sits low on my face.
4.0,Really very pretty and sparkly.  My only concern is that the posts are too long for me.  I cannot sleep with them in because the posts dig into my head.  Gonna see if I can have posts shortened.
4.0,Tight in the armpits.  I wear them under my scrubs.
4.0,I've only wore them once so far and they are comfortable.  Will update my review after I wear them acre more times.
4.0,Supercute. I just didn't realize there was an embroidered juDanzy logo on the back of the hat. I wish that wasn't there.
4.0,Recieved 94 and one was missing one ball only got a couple duplicates and none were broken they came in the mail really fast no complaints because they were great overall for the price
4.0,I'm glad I didn't need as a dress I was assuming I would wear it as a top and that's what it will be at our ugly sweater day lol
4.0,Watch is as described and works great. Only issue I've had is the chain is connected a bit flimsily.
4.0,Works well for a small umbrella and is convenient to carry.
4.0,It is worth the money just wish the quality was a little better.
4.0,good for driving in early morning. Don't get too dark while driving. BUT do not get any where close to clear inside.
4.0,It’s good for a one day occasion which is what I purchased it for. It actually looks like the picture just that the quality is not as great it’s lighter than I thought almost feels like plastic.  But it’s for a teenager to use for one day at an event so it’s perfect for me.
4.0,"I really like this, I got the tan and black one, and it looks great with black leggings. Im 5'8 around 200lbs. XL is actually a bit big, but not too big.<br />My only issue which may be a bigger issue later is the tassles. They seem cheap and thin. I don't think this can go in the dryer because of them, and the tassles is on a thin string that seems like it will break or fray rather quickly. I still like it tho"
4.0,Fits a little wide in the mid section. Good quality material.
4.0,They are very cute the fix is the top fix but the shorts was too big material is thin but great for the weather here I like them ordered an xl...
4.0,"The hat is a cute floppy hat. I ordered the White and the hat is not pure white as depicted but is a light beige. The detachable chin strap came at the bottom of the box without directions. Through another review I was told it poked through the sweat band. The hat is cute but I returned it, I didn't want to poke the chin strap through the sweatband. And I wanted a White hat not beige. I have a small head but the hat seems big."
4.0,Quality seems sturdy but I was not expecting baby pink based on the advertised photo.
4.0,"Pretty, deep blue. i don't know much about sapphires so am not a good judge of this stone.  A good match for the earrings I bought separately from the same site. I also bought the ""emeralds"" - the stone is a gorgeous deep green."
4.0,Smell unpleasant and brown is lighter than image on display
4.0,The boots are very nice. Did have the sOle start to come off but I got it fixed at our local shoe repair shop
4.0,"Loved the color and fit. Only thing I’m not crazy about, the fabric. But very cute for the price."
4.0,"If you’re 5’8 or above consider a different option, dress is way too short"
4.0,"They are exactly as pictured and described. Sure they aren't 24 carat gold material, but either is the price. You get what you pay for and this is a good buy. I received 8 total and non of them were broken or separated. I plan on adding a necklace in the box they come in, and it will fit very well. I would buy again."
4.0,Love it...it's so cute....bigger than I thought it would be...but still cute just literally orderd the green and brown one...only gave it 4 stars because one of the chain clips wouldn't open to clip to the gold metal part on the inside of the purse but I just used a small safety pin to fix it.
4.0,"It is just okay for home use around the house , but it will not be good for go somewhere, it looks ugly, also it is little bit blurry, even you have precription glass"
4.0,"Mostly a great buy for the money! The material is super soft and the length in the arms and the torso is perfect for me! For reference, I’m approximately 5’7” and 150 lbs. I normally wear between a medium and a large top and I ordered a Large in these. The only downside is that the sizing is inconsistent. When I first received them, I tried on one, it fit, so I threw them all in the wash. However, when I went to wear them for the first time, I realized that while one fit perfect, the other two were a bit snug for my liking, but still wearable. I would recommend these, but I would definitely recommend to size up."
4.0,"Avon is THE BEST when it comes to bracelets and anklets. They last for ever and never lose their shine! I did not like this one - I had to cut all the dangle parts off. But I still wear it, without the rhinestones! I recommend buying Avon, but maybe you can pick a different anklet."
4.0,I have been Super Happy with this since I bought it back in August... until it broke this morning. The metal part is still solid but I really liked being able to hold it by the the leather loop (which is probably why it broke but ). So now I have to decide to replace this or get something similar.
4.0,"I’m in love with the colors. Fit is expected I got my regular size. I wear a 14 and got size large. Fit is right on. Packaged was ok, but the smell was horrible! Washed it and it turned out fine."
4.0,"She originally wanted the other color (to be like her friends) so ""I"" purposely got the purple..<br />Once she wore em, it was her Friends that wanted different colors...lol"
4.0,This bonnet is precious! The fabric isn't the greatest quality and it wrinkles easily but it holds up to washing. It is reversible and I like both patterns a lot!
4.0,Earrings were quite large. Haven’t worn them yet.
4.0,Bought for my husband..  He likes It I feel its a bit too short..  But if he's happy I am.
4.0,Easy to install and easy to adjust.
4.0,"The shirts fit as expected. I’ve been working out for a while, so the shirts do fit a bit more snug in the chest"
4.0,"This University of Minn. scarf is great for showing school spirit.  It is less great for actually keeping warm on a frigid day.  Buy it as an accessory rather than as cold weather gear.  Well made, washable, and a better price than most other sources"
4.0,Love the dress but it had a very strong chemical smell I had to wash it.
4.0,"These earrings are so pretty and sparkly....the pictures don't do them justice!<br />The only issue is the posts are way longer than normal which is super weird to me, the ends of them actually touch my head behind my ear. If anything even slightly bumped in to my ear the earring post would poke me in the head. It's nothing I can't fix with some wire cutters though so I'm not too worried about it.<br />I'd give them 5 stars if the posts were a normal length."
4.0,Little tight. Loved the material but not as forgiving as my mom bid needs 😂 great price
4.0,"The band it pretty.  It was more bulky than I would have liked.  The largest problem was in removing the links.  I broke all the tips for the removal tool and I still could not get the last two links out.  I worked on it for over an hour until I just gave up. I never got to wear it to determine if it is comfortable or durable. Sadly, I sent it back and bought another, thinner band from another seller.  Cute if you get a good one."
4.0,It came with a small hole. Dress itself it's well made and it's beautiful.
4.0,"Finally Baleaf made a gel chamois. Compared to Pearl Izumi Quest shorts, which I actually wear under my MTB shorts, this Baleaf chamois is almost at that level and it's HALF the price. It's breathable, wicks sweat and comfortable. I have ridden it on a 3-4 bike ride, using a Specialized Epic and a Santa Cruz Hightower, and the gel held up so well I bought another one. Definitely something to consider when you are trying to save money on your bike gear.<br /><br />I would recommend these to my friends."
4.0,"They are not Cotton obviously, but slick and comfortable."
4.0,It looks nice and sturdy but we haven't used it yet!
4.0,"Very pretty , I love it!"
4.0,"Very cute, but a bit larger. And the posts feel a little loose"
4.0,"Nice, cute top.  Sizing is a little on bigger side."
4.0,"They arrived already a bit rusty on the hook. I almost returned them, but decided to clean them with silver jewelry cleaning cloth. They are ok, but I have to keep doing so every now and then."
4.0,Super cute! Great match with princess elsa dress! Some small stones are already fell off but it’s invisible. I recommend this shoes especially if you are looking for matching shoes to princess elsa dress!
4.0,Purchased this shirt as a birthday gift and it runs small.  Fabric is not very soft and does not have much give to it…not like you’d want a cozy sweatshirt to be.  The person it was gifted to likes it…so it was all good.
4.0,Nice jacket very happy with it. I'm a size 46-48 I ordered a 3X and the fit is perfect .
4.0,"Good belt to wear for work. Feels very sturdy. The brown side is a little dark, but overall happy with the product"
4.0,"good quality, fit not ideal"
4.0,I fell in love instantly.. this is my every day wristband right now. Would have have durability 5☆'s but on the first day a few stones fell out.. but I still love and wear it. I just flipped it to the bottom. I have the 46mm and it's hard to find girly/feminine band to make it not so manly.. but this makes it very feminine.
4.0,"Love the flat shape and the size. It’s exactly what I was looking for. Let’s see how long they will last. The clasp seems not to secure, well let’s see if it falls off or not.<br />I am updating my review because as I feared one of the earrings fell off and is lost. I wish the clasp was sturdier because the shape and size was perfect"
4.0,I'm going to have to extend the waist! Can't sleep in them being that tight!! Other than that they are perfect warm weather jamies!
4.0,"I really ,really like my boots. But as far as comfort, it leaves much to be desired. The material has a sort of cardboard feel to it. Very stiff. You will need thicker socks to wear them comfortably. Keep that in mind when choosing a size."
4.0,"The earrings look very much like the picture, they sparkle and shin and look very believable. work is nice and clean."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. The heart/butterfly pendant is larger than expected and the thickness and length of the chain doesnt match the pendant size.<br />The pendant itself is quite beautiful and worth the cost.<br />I will probably buy alonger and thicker chain.
4.0,I love it just I expected.  I am looking for another canvas handbag a few inches bigger with a different color with the same style.
4.0,fit as expected. good quality
4.0,I wear these to sleep in.  They are comfy.  Not sure that I would wear them to workout in.
4.0,"It's a really nice breathable fabric. The reason why I knocked off a star is because I feel like it clings a little weird around the tummy. But, that could be just me. It's also really long, I'm also 5'2 and it comes just above my knee. It looks cute with leggings and I'll probably end up belting it to help cover the stomach."
4.0,"Actually fit and was comfortable for husband, who suffers terribly from small nerve cell neuropathy in both feet.  Unfortunately, the  &#34;fur&#34; fabric on one slipper began to unravel at one wearing.  Need to return and get another pair."
4.0,A little cheap
4.0,Great quality material and the color is exactly what you see on the pictures. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it kinda lost its shape even though it was delivered inside a box.
4.0,"I don't know why this simple little device gets such bad reviews.  I ordered it to resize a slender band, and it works fine.  You just lay the wire along the bottom, then bend the prongs around the ring. I needed some needle nose pliers to do this, and then needed a little more force to clamp down the ends so they weren't skewering me in the finger.  Works fine, although I could see how this is not an ideal solution to a wider band."
4.0,Great Purchase for Wwf Era fans
4.0,These sunglasses are very cute I bought a pair for my daughter and I. They are a little big on my face so I had to bend them in a little to keep them from sliding off.
4.0,I bought this for my mom she's 5ft. and 110. It's very nice on her but runs very small. I bought 2 sizes up and it fits good. She has an enlarged stomach but even at that it still fits good everywhere else.
4.0,Good shades for the price<br /><br />Wish the lens had a darker tent
4.0,"The loops has a hard time  going through earlobe.  That part hooks to the back is a little difficult getting on because they’re kind of bent in an odd position so loop ones don’t go through ear smoothly and therefore they kind of hurt while getting them on. But they are beautiful,  I actually prefer the studs over than the loops the studs are very beautiful.  I have long hair and you can see them through the long hair,  they shine and have just the right amount of bling to say I’m here."
4.0,"I did not receive the tool promised to assist in resizing the band. While the band does look as pictured, I can not wear the watch until I am able to resize the band.<br /><br />Update: The tool finally came 9 days after the band. I had to take out 3 links for the watch to fit me. All in all I think it’s a great deal for the money paid. The quality isn’t great but this is by far the best design for an Apple Watch that I’ve found!"
4.0,I like the tie and it will go well with my son's Homecoming date's dress.  It is more of a brass/gold color.  It is NOT a bright yellow.<br /><br />It was what we were looking for.
4.0,"This item was picked by my niece so I purchased for a gift to her and I send it over seas , therefore I can not provide a rate. now I can not submit my message without rating, so since it is cute I will rate 4 but I do not know details. sorry about that."
4.0,"Tried it on-not bad., will see how it looks when I actually wear it; over all a decent purchase"
4.0,so cute and I love all of them but the snake necklace is a little tight
4.0,"The Roc Bodywear Men’s Body Slimming Compression Shirt worked miracles for my boyfriend. As soon as he put it on, he instantly stood straighter and looked as if he had lost several inches on his midsection. The shirt is very comfortable and is made of fabric that allows easy breathing. The nice thing about it is there are no bumps or bulges that show where the shirt is compressing. It is very smooth under clothing and does not show through other shirts like some shape wear does. For my boyfriend, he instantly felt more confident and made him motivated to go and workout more than he already does. It does a great job at firming his body and making him feel like an overall more confident person! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Very cute. Fits nice and snug
4.0,"This sweater is really warm and cozy! Fits like the pic, however the sleeves are on the short side. I’m 5’8” and they are barely to my wrist. If you are taller than me, they would probably be too short."
4.0,Perfect and adjustable. No problems so far.
4.0,Best sports bra I've owned. I bought 2!
4.0,"My sons jacket , but it keeps you warm like a coat .He loves it."
4.0,"Very comfortable, though I was expecting more of a hood. Rather then a standard hood it's more like a loose long necked turtle neck that can be used as a hood with a drawstring. Still I am very happy with it, ours perfect weight for cool evenings."
4.0,Love this top - comfortable and fit well
4.0,"The dress is super beautiful, i like the style, very appropriate for the summer. However, their small size is a medium for me. It was just too loose and too long. I had to cut the white par of the dress to wear it properly and sew both sides to my perfect fit. Im a 5'0, 90 lbs asian petite woman, I wish the size wa perfect, coz i totally love this dress, after all he altering though, It was really gorgeous.  I wish Agoodic will have different size option fr many types of people."
4.0,"You get what you pay for. the arms are also a little short, but all in all a good product"
4.0,"Very cute, long necklace.  Definitely worth the price."
4.0,"Bought for a fellow Whovian, these are just the right size and weight, not too shiny, and aren't too flashy for everyday wear."
4.0,Ur dad
4.0,"Very handsome bracelet.... everyone comments, it's definitely a conversation piece!!"
4.0,I love them! BUT... I just opened them because I’m making my proposal boxes and I’m missing one. There were only 5 in the pack instead of 6...
4.0,This is a very nice and easy to see charm. The only downside is it's oversized and square so it doesn't match the size or shape of standard charms which might be annoying so some.
4.0,Shorts were true to size and were of good quality. My daughter loves them and wears the different colors often!
4.0,"This charm is tiny...I must have missed the part of the description that says it's for children. It's very pretty, it's just smaller than I thought it would be for the price. My mom still liked it, but she had to switch it to a longer chain."
4.0,This is a decent backpack for the price. It is not a military grade backpack by any means. It is more of a school backpack or office backpack. Just because it comes in olive green or camo color doesn't make it military grade.<br /><br />That being said it is well made and very sturdy. The zippers appear to be very strong and there are lots of pockets inside and out.  I use it to carry my binoculars and spotting scope when I go out bird watching. I can easily fit all my stuff along with an extra jacket hat gloves whatever I need.  The expandable feature really makes this backpack have a huge storage capacity.<br /><br />It's a good value for the price. I would recommend if you're looking for an inexpensive quality backpack.
4.0,Great boots for a rough little boy
4.0,Jewel fell out but about 6 months in 😂
4.0,"After installing the new sticks I can say I like the texture more than the original ones. I do not feel a huge difference in material as some reviewers suggested they did. They work very well, however after using them for a week or two I have noticed that the texture has started to slightly wear off, just like on my originals, not as fast I do not believe though. Time will tell if they hold up better and if or not they tear like the original ones. The install was pretty straight forward, but you do have to disconnect ribbon cables, and have to move a circuit board, if you do not feel comfortable doing that do not buy these sticks."
4.0,My daughter loves this outfit though she does complain about the extra little lip of fabric around the neck of the sweater..... she says it's not big deal but she's 4 so she has trouble folding it back in. I had to trim a ton of little floating threads off the bottom and seams but it wasn't anything major. The elastic waistband band also twists but it's easy enough to straighten out. A few minor imperfections don't take away from the fact that it's adorable!
4.0,Very pretty<br /><br />Sad I will Have to iron it but that's authentic!
4.0,"As with any ""import"", you probably need to order a size larger"
4.0,"I am happy with this order but just letting know I ordered a xxl and I usually wear a large.. it fit in size but it does run short in the torso.. I am 5'7"" 154.. hope this helps on ordering"
4.0,It's a nice wristlet. Fits a big phone well.
4.0,My 13 year old daughter loves these so much. She's always cold at school and wears a pair everyday to keep her hands warm. They allow her to do everything she needs but keeps her hands warm. She can pull them off her hands and leave them on her wrists if she wants to and they are still comfortable. They aren't as long up the wrists as the image shows.
4.0,"I really like these boots! They are very comfortable, fit well and I have no problem wearing them for extended periods. The only thing I wish was better is the tip on the heels is a hard plastic which tends to slip out from under you if you are on a slick floor, but I am going to take them to the shoe repair and have them replace it with a better tip. I usually wind up doing this with a lot of the heels that I purchase. These boots are cute, cute, cute! I'm so glad I got them.<br />I did receive these at a discount for my honest review. I value Amazon's review system and rely on it myself for my purchasing decisions. I am under no obligation to leave a positive review and have, when warranted, left less-than-stellar reviews."
4.0,"These are very pretty and shiny!  A little larger than I thought so I haven't worn them yet, The lever-back seems well made and the metal looks like the finish will hold up well too."
4.0,"Cute top, a little scratchy."
4.0,They look cute and good for yoga/hanging out around the house!
4.0,I ordered the size up and it fit well.
4.0,"They shrink considerably after the first wash, but are stretchable. Great to wear with Sperry's. They don't show, and they don't slip at the heel."
4.0,"material is cool, but collar is a bit wide."
4.0,Love the bright orange perfect for the races
4.0,It's beautiful but it is small and I can't even wear it so it'll be going back. I have an average size wrist but it is obviously made for much smaller wrists
4.0,Very nice....fits my small wrists well. ...and looks like silver.<br />Please make some in a gold tone.
4.0,She loved it! But as a mom I think it could use a bit of an upgrade on how the tail is put on but it still worked out great.
4.0,"The thickness is great but they are very small, I bought them for my husband but they were impossible to wear for them, even for me that I’m a xs size they are super tight, could not stand the pressure"
4.0,Nice but smaller than I thought. Would be nicer a little bigger but I am satisfied.
4.0,Love the masks but delivery took awhile
4.0,"This fit the 24mm lug width on my standalone Android SmartWatch (Rollme S08) and gave it a nice rugged, military look. I just wish it also came in black and other colors. It was easy to install with the quick-release bars. It might not be the best fit for really thick wrists."
4.0,"This sweater is very cute and incredibly soft. However, the shape of it is extremely boxy. With the thickness of the fabric and the weird shape, it’s just not very flattering. It may have looked better if size xs was an option."
4.0,"Look good, decent quality.  accidentally ordered large, good thing as they fit well as a medium"
4.0,"I ordered two of these to replace two that I had recently lost.  They work great, though I was expecting an elastic loop like my previous umbrella rather than the braided loop that came with these."
4.0,"I like it, will recommend this item"
4.0,Nice shoe. Colour is a beige/taupe. Fits true to size. Heel not too high.Comfy to wear all day. They look nice with jeans. Since they are suede they need to be sprayed with leather protector.
4.0,Too loose on the shoulder and sleeves to loose.
4.0,"The product meet my expectations, very good quality and price, full armored and have a normal weight.<br />Thanks for great product."
4.0,"Very cute, but as others had stated, the bodice fits very short. My girl is 4, but height of a 5, so i purchased the size yr5-6. And it still barely covers. Since i sized up, the straps are long, so i will just stitch the straps in the back. In the pic, you will see that I temporarily safety pinned the straps. My advice to others would be, buy, but size 1-2 sizes up, and be ready to alter the straps."
4.0,Really soft and comfortable. Biggest issue is it a little short in length so has a tendency to ride up. No much compression like spanx more of a form/hugging fit.
4.0,"I actually really like it. Fits nicely, the top is slightly padded. Overall great suit for the price"
4.0,https://www.amazon.com/review/R2QIWOLG41SGFT/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4996B4
4.0,Very nice earrings !  Only drawback is that the color of the gem is a bit washed out. Not a rich purple. But you can kinda tell that by the picture.
4.0,"Love this top! Good quality material for the price. Only thing is it's big on me, I usually wear 10-12 so I took the L to be safe but I could have got away with the M and still have that loose effect i wanted. Would definitely buy again!"
4.0,"I have narrow hips and need belts to keep my pants up. This one is a good size and a great price. Its hard to find a belt that fits someone over a size 8, I wear size 16 pants and I have some room to spare with this belt."
4.0,The white fabric is a little see thru but that's ok because it's still a cute outfit.
4.0,"Look pretty good, material seems pretty sturdy. I think the clip could be stronger but for the cost I'm happy with it. I also received it several days earlier than amazons estimate, so that was a plus."
4.0,"This is actually a really good quality hat for the price.<br />Four stars because the circumference string to size did not stay in place after being adjusted, so the hat layed almost over my eyes (hopefully this malfunction was just on my hat).  This hat is also heavier than what I wanted to wear for my long walks.<br />The brim is nice and large, really does provide good coverage from the sun with great vents.<br />So, I did returned the hat because of the weight, as well as the string issue.  However, I think if you're thinking about purchasing this, give it a try to see if it'll work for you, especially since returns are easy and the price is fantastic."
4.0,These worked great for the crafts I was making.
4.0,so cute the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because the tail was a little shorter than i expected but it was a great pop on easy halloween costume for my work. simple is better and this is too cute. would be great for dress up with little kids too!
4.0,Fantastic legging! Looks & feels great on...
4.0,It snug and cozy.
4.0,"Dress is brightly colored. I was looking for a darker dress, so I returned, but it fit well and was nicely made."
4.0,"It's well made but narrow. I'm 5'3&#34;, 125 lbs, 38B. and I can wear it, but it would look better on someone with a more narrow rib cage. I also would not think anyone over a B cup could wear it."
4.0,These are very nice but they would be for kids 6 and up...my grand daughter is 3 1/2 and they're too big
4.0,"They’re okay, except one pair of the gold colored 3 leaf lotus leaves did not match in color."
4.0,"This dress is a great value for the money.  I will be wearing it as a casual “going out” dress, but I wouldn’t be embarrassed to wear it to a wedding. It’s got a slightly sexy plunged neckline, but not one your mother-in-law would be appalled by. I have not yet worn it to see if it will pill, but the fabric certainly doesn’t feel like it could. It isn’t sheer.  From reading reviews (after I ordered this), I was worried I may have to send it back.  I did, however, notice there are particular colors/patterns that don’t seem to show up with negative reviews.  I’d like to add this yellow print to the positive side.  Also, it is a length that will work for both short and tall girls. It fits exactly as it should, and seriously very flattering. (I, unfortunately, carry a little extra weight.) I’m happy with my purchase."
4.0,"They are soft, inside and out, they are stylish and so small.  I have average large hands, but O can barely squeeze my hands in with a lot of work, the XL would have been a better choice!"
4.0,These are cute but fit a little loose on my child.
4.0,"Not so easy to set the time - I had to do for my elderly family member - and continues to say the US time not set - I was able to set the day however,  the time I was off by 5 minutes and while the voice says the exact time and date - the clock shows 5 minutes faster..... I wanted to return but he wanted to keep even with the 5 minutes difference... 🙁"
4.0,"Cute outfit, but the headband is so large an adult could wear it as a scarf"
4.0,"Fits good, easy to assemble. No squeaks or annoying noises. Could use a few more notches in the beginning of the belt for thin people however.."
4.0,Almost a great bathing suit. I was hoping it would come higher up on my bust so my arm skin wouldnt hang over but no such luck- had to return.
4.0,"Looks great, i love the way this looks compared to the classic blaze frame style. The buttons feel sturdy and the frame fits perfectly."
4.0,"What I like best about the YOIHUR FULL OF STARS GOLD RING is that it can be worn two ways, depending on your mood.  It is an attractive simple ring that can be stacked with other rings.  I personally think it looks best all by itself.<br /><br />When you turn the stars to the inside, it looks like a wide solid gold wedding band.  It looks expensive and understated.  Wearing it with the cubic zirconia chips showing, adds sparkle and visual interest.  I do think it looks more like costume jewelry with the sparkle side showing.  It does  look good both ways,  and some outfits look even better when you add a little sparkle.<br /><br />I got it in the widest width available and am really pleased with the overall size of the ring and the way it looks on my hand.<br /><br />I will wear this ring constantly, only replacing it if it becomes discolored.  At some point that is to be expected with gold filled and gold plated jewelry.  If it lasts a year, I will consider this to be a bargain.  If it starts losing its color or irritating my finger, I will update my review."
4.0,"Well made and good price. I wish the slot did not poke out as much under a shirt, that’s why I only gave 4 stars."
4.0,"Brought it as a gift, she loves it."
4.0,"really nice top for the price, probably will buy more for BJJ."
4.0,"I was expecting a soft hoodie to wear around the house, this came and it wasn't what I expected but I love it. I live in Seattle and it's great for this time of year when it's cool outside. It's very thick, sturdy material. Nicely made. Fit a little smaller than expected but I still like it."
4.0,The material is nice. Too bad I couldn’t fit them. I will be giving them to a family member for Christmas. Rated 4 because they run small
4.0,I wear a size 8 women's shoe and was able to fit both wedge heels into one bag. They are great for sandals too. I would recommend two bags for a pair of large men's shoes. These don't feel or look cheap at all.
4.0,"Love the colors on this sweatshirt, they're a bit brighter than pictured. The fit is quite loose, I usually wear this size and items are not quite as loose. Also, it's about three inches shorter than as advertised, so for someone a bit on the tall side, like me, barely reaches &#34;tunic' status. I am very careful to order shirts I think will be long enough for me based on stated measurements, but this one, straight out of the package, was shorter than advertised. Even so, I still like it a lot, get many compliments and wear it often.<br />And after several months of wear, the black is just starting to fade a bit, but overall this is a very nice, lightweight sweatshirt."
4.0,"Nice price ! I got this for someone as a gift for his birthday .He lived it ! I got a large , but I felt the jacket was more snug then the regular northface jackets in the store .  I would recommend going a size up .This is very lite eight material . Not bulky at all . Keeps you warm and dry ."
4.0,"Good quality, but is like a size bigger. The color is darker, is like a wine, not like in the picture, but is nice color too. The pullover was for my son, I ordered Size S and I had to give it to my husband who is between a M and L size. Pls buy a size smaller than you usually use."
4.0,Nicely crafted bracelet.  Hope elastic string holds up after multiple uses.
4.0,Super cute print.<br />Even though the fabric is see through it doesn't breath. Perfect for the season I suppose.<br /><br />Fit was great.
4.0,"I live in these things while gardening and landscaping. I don’t want to keep having to change a heavy sweat-soaked shirt every hour. They will get grass stains on them and I have a tiny pill on one where it got snagged on a splinter, but overall they’re fine. I bought a size larger than I usually do because I didn’t want a muscle shirt. These are a little scratchy, but not uncomfortable, as compared to Haynes drifit."
4.0,"This top is a little bit boxy on me, but that's a minimal complaint when you compare it to the fact that this BARELY even looks like a nursing top! It is a bit see through though so that's why I gave it four stars. I wear a demi tee underneath it so you can't see my tan bra through the shirt. The zipper access for nursing is soooo clever; that's my favorite part! I will definitely be able to wear this even when I'm done nursing. Even though the fabric is a bit see through in the front, it is also thicker/heavier than I expected. It feels like a very nice quality. If you are larger chested, you may have some trouble getting this top to work for you in a discreet way until you get the hang of it; I did at first. But now that I'm used to using the zipper and the placement of it, I really do like this top quite a bit and wish I had one in a darker color too."
4.0,the cat is  smaller than I thought it would be.  super cute though. thank you
4.0,Brought it to small the dress is beautiful.
4.0,It seems like a great product but I got it to put my vape cigarette in when I go jet skiing and it's just a tad too small.
4.0,The earrings were smaller than what was shown on the model. They were well-made and very attractive
4.0,Gave a 4 star because it shrank a bit in the dryer. Hang dry.
4.0,"I ordered this in a size 10 because my 9/9.5 sizing wasn't available. Taking that into consideration, it was closer fitting than I had expected since I would normally have a wee bit more wiggle room in a size ten shoe otherwise. I also ordered it in patent to go with a dress (which unfortunately wasn't available I later came to find out) so I wasn't really looking for comfort more over than style. However, they were very easy to walk in! I stayed in them for about 45 minutes of consistent walking, going up and down stairs, and I had no difficulties walking in them or soreness caused by poor quality.<br /><br />Lacing these, like the xtra high top converse styled shoes I ordered, is a one time thing due to the zipper and thank god it is a one time thing!<br /><br />All in all I like the product and am happy with the level of comfort in spite of the semi-awkward fit."
4.0,"Everything about these is perfect, except they are really heavy. The clasp holds perfect and is undone easily but not so easy that it comes off by it's own, it's in the clasp sweet-spot. The spikes look sharp, but aren't sharp enough to actually hurt you, but they really do look like they could. They're shiny and show their quality, which is very good! The gunmetal color is perfect! Dark enough to be Goth, but not so dark as to mute their beautiful detail. The one and only problem is these are actually solid steel and HEAVY!"
4.0,Run large but good quality.
4.0,Cute & simple! I really like it especially for it being so cheap !
4.0,"Male Reviewer<br /><br />Wicked sexy. Fits great and looks better. Durable material, which is made well. It was delivered quickly and i am very happy with it. the open crotch design is shaped perfectly."
4.0,"I got an x-large, as I wear a large or x-large in shirts. This fits too small, I should've gone with the xx-large. Order two sizes up, other than that, there were no damages to the jacket itself and its really comfortable and soft on the inside."
4.0,I bought this dress hoping it would work with my body type.  Even with the belt it look like a bag.  Nothing wrong with the dress but im 197 and top heavy with hips.  Just not for me.
4.0,Pretty in pink.  Elastic waisteband so would fit anyone
4.0,"Really nice. Was a little shorter than it seems in picture, but the length is good."
4.0,The product was a bit small the only problem I had was when I washed it the dye came off on the black part marking it a have a tint of res so when washing I recommend wash with just water and I use this for cosplay
4.0,Great value for the money - runs small though. I am 5'4&#34; and 118 lbs and the small was very fitting. Wore this to an evening event and got lots of compliments on this and didn't cost a fortune!
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable.  I like it very much, especially the pockets, but any figure 'flaw' Will Show.  If you're short it may also touch the ground.  I shrunk it a little in the dryer and it's fine now."
4.0,They did not come up as high over my calves as I'd like but they are warm and batteries last about 6 hours or so.  Not as comfortable with the wires inside socks and only the toe area is heated but overall pretty happy with this purchase.
4.0,Only worry that it may turn on me because I wear it 'every day' !!
4.0,The hat  is really cute and its a nice quality..only problem is that it is slightly big but it can be adjusted with the strap on the back.
4.0,Use them for a kids so party. They are really cute. I purchased a x large for me small for the kids and fit perfectly.
4.0,"Had to make sure I had an XL since it fits like a large - the tag wasn't in the typical behind-the-neck spot. Pockets are near non-existent; really small. Sweatshirt overall feels pretty thin, and is soft on the inside. I can't imagine it lasting the test of time. I do like the style overall, but it doesn't seem like it was cut for a guy of my build. May return, unless the wife likes it.<br /><br />Update, My wife liked it, so +1 star.<br /><br />Update 2: 3/30/21: so far this sweatshirt has held up and made it through the wash a few times. No complaints."
4.0,Good for fitting over my glasses and to use for working outdoor sunlight and driving.  Bought a second pair for vacation travel to beach locations.
4.0,I wear an XL sweatshirt and I have room. This one is not skin tite. But that being said I should of got a 2xl
4.0,I thought they where going to be bigger but they were ok in size. Overall liked them a lot
4.0,Does not have a pocket for a filter. Of course that is my own fault for missing that in the description. It is very thin. I purchased it for my elderly mother but I don’t believe it provides very much protection.
4.0,"Great clasp, leather becomes waterlogged and deteriorates eventually."
4.0,"It's cute, but I'm not sure I like the racer tank underneath. It hangs off my daughter's shoulders and makes it look bigger-and it already runs a but big. This is one she will have to grow into."
4.0,Very handy.  I keep a spare pair of these in both cars for days with a lot of glare.<br /><br />VALUE - For a pair of glasses that are less than $20 pretty good.  For comparison my wife paid $200 for a pair of custom clip-ons at her eye doctor.<br /><br />MATERIALS - The protective lenses are thin but the metal clip is sturdy.  They look like they would scratch easily so we store them in the overhead sunglasses compartment of the car and have not had any problems.<br /><br />EFFECTIVENESS - They do a good job cutting glare.  They are great for days days when we have a snowstorm and there is a lot of glare.  They were a lifesaver coming back from the eye doctor when my pupils were dilated.<br /><br />SIZE - Very useful. good coverage for even large glasses.  I have a large pair of aviators and my wife has oval shaped glasses.  A nice feature is that in a pinch we can both use them while we are driving.<br /><br />UTILITY - My wife and I both have glasses that tint in the sun but that feature does not work in the car.  These are perfect for that since we do not have the same size glasses.
4.0,Just fine!
4.0,"These shorts are really nice. Lightweight, comfortable and built well. My one issue is that there are no secure pockets for small items. The best workout shorts will have a pocket with a zippier or some sort of fastener to keep loose items from falling out. These do not. There is a small pocket in the back, but it's basically useless as anything you put in it would easily fall out with any real movement."
4.0,"A little bigger then i thought it would be, looked to unproportionate in my car but it was really cute in my moms truck so i gifted it to her! I would buy again as far as the product goes I just didnt pay attention to the size when ordering."
4.0,Great! Got these for party favors and my two kids love them! They can be turned on and off too. I do agree though that they have a nasty smell... but that dissipated shortly after I opened the individual wrapper on it.
4.0,"The quality of the actual pendant is great!  It has nice weight to it and is chunky enough that boys would like it because it doesn't look too feminine.  The little link that holds the pendant on the chain seemed a little weak to me, though.  I took the pendant off the chain so I could attach it to a hat, and I easily bent it with my fingers.  That could be an issue if the necklace gets caught on something.  I still highly recommend it because of the quality of the pendant."
4.0,Got them for my Daughter  she loves them
4.0,Love it!  Fit my 2 year old grandson perfectly and his dad as well!
4.0,"Although it fits just right, the bottom towards my foot is a little loose so it’s not like tight enough but I like it."
4.0,I like them but a little thinner than I expected.
4.0,Fit great on my almost 2 yo grandson
4.0,"This is a glasses case that attaches easily to bags or belts. The case measures approximately 6.5”x2.75”x2” and weighs about 4 oz. It has a zippered opening that will accommodate regular glasses or most sunglasses. The shell is flexible plastic with padding, covered by tough woven nylon. Along one side of the case is a strap with a sturdy snap on one end that can be attached to a strap or handle of a pack or bag. Under the main strap are 2 smaller Velcro straps that can be wound around posts, ropes, or straps. At the top of the case is a light duty plastic carabiner that can be clipped onto a belt, keyring, etc. The case has no visible labels or logos.<br /><br />I find this case quite useful for travel since it holds my sunglasses securely on the outside of my pack where I can easily reach them. The multiple attachment possibilities will fit just about any carrying scenario. I wish that the case had a harder shell, though, since I don’t know if it will provide sufficient protection for my sunglasses in case I sit or step on the case by accident. Other than that, this is a handy and well made carrying case."
4.0,I have to wear contact lenses because I'm a daily driver and I have to wear polarized sunglasses. These clip on fast and fit snug and look good. For the price these are great. 5 stars if they flipped up and stayed in up.
4.0,These socks are really pretty. They have a nice fit on me and are very comfy. The material is thin so just be careful when washing them.
4.0,Came faster than expected took one star off because one was bent at the top but can still wear them beautiful worth the money
4.0,The color and style were a great fit!
4.0,"Lovely earrings although a bit expensive for single studs even with sterling silver posts and backs. Fast delivery and packaged well. Arrived in a nice presentation box tied with ribbon. Except for the price, my only disappointment is the screw backs. While secure, they are too small for arthritic hands and I had to replace the flat pieces with bullet clutch type backs. Seller seems courteous and dependable. Would consider doing business with them again."
4.0,Love the suit. The hat is on the small size we got XXL suit. Beard and hair not great but we are not using it.  We order strictly for the suit and love it.
4.0,"I LOVE! I choose the yellow based on another reviewers photo....I made the right choice for me. I’m 5’9 (and have heels on in the photo), and usually a 10ish or size M or L in dresses depending on how long they are. I ordered an XL based on other reviews and had plenty of room to spare. I’ll probably order another color once payday comes around :)"
4.0,I'm 5'2 but this fits very small though the material is so great!
4.0,Band too short; good watch
4.0,I gave this to my niece
4.0,My 12 year old grandchild loves the dress--it is stretchy and will be able to fit her for a long time as she grows.
4.0,There was an issue with my order. I contacted the seller and they were extremely responsive and the problem was with Amazon fulfillment center not the seller themselves.<br />The bags are a little smaller than expected but I can still use them as intended :)
4.0,This dress just fits my little one soo much. The straps were a bit wide but have been able to adjust it with my needle work experience. Just love it.
4.0,I ordered it as a small surprise for my wife. She was fascinated by it and wants to wear it but her feet are too small.
4.0,Great dress! Extremely comfortable and light weight. I love The colors and the price is definitely worth it. I wear These dresses to work and everyone loves them. The only complaint I have Is that I have a tummy/am a thicker woman so it is a tad visible in this dress.
4.0,"$13 for 16 anklets isn't bad.  They are simple, nothing fancy.  Pretty much a charm attached from each side with a square knot and adjustable with a sliding knot.  They are exactly as pictured with several colors and charms to fit your mood.  They were neatly ""folded"" in a drawstring organza bag and weren't too difficult to separate. Pretty good for the asking price."
4.0,Looks and feels great. It is a lot more stiff than I had anticipated. It latches well and doesn't come off. The magnetic clasp is strong but is scratched very easily just from latching. It has stayed together well and I enjoy wearing it.
4.0,my style... loved it
4.0,Beautiful but kind of cheaply made. It's most likely not going to last me long.
4.0,The headbands are thinner than pictured and the colored and grey part twists easily.
4.0,"Better than I expected and a good value. Only issue is some of them are kind of hard to screw on and off so I dinged them one star.  I am one of those people who never changes out their jewelry - these seem to be fine to leave in, they aren't tarnishing or anything. The rhinestones will eventually fall out but they always do on these things. So far so good, have had them in about 3 weeks."
4.0,"These shoes are very warm and I love the sturdy sole. I ordered a women's size 10. (My normal size ranges from 9 1/2- 10 1/2.) These fit me perfectly in length, however, they are very loose. Because of the sturdy sole, they are also semi-heavy. Because of this, I cannot walk up stairs without losing my slippers. I will be keeping them and adding an elastic strap across the back to go around my heel to resolve this problem."
4.0,"This shirt has great quality fabric and it is very well made. I determined my size by reading reviews, going on weight and height, so it's my fault the shirt is too small-  it does fit fine from the waist down. If you have a large chest you must size up . I'm keeping the shirt and I'll just wear a t-shirt under it."
4.0,Thinner material than I thought it would be but very soft and lightweight.  The sleeves looked longer in the picture than they really are.  I am 5'7&#34; and the sleeves are short...will have to wear them as 3/4 length
4.0,"Really cute, received lots of compliments, I used it everyday. My only complaint is that I guess due to my overused it has scratches all over and it looks somewhat different, but still cute"
4.0,"Exactly what I expected, comfortable, sheerness & thickness are exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,"The material is thick.  The high waist was great to absorb the sweat, which I used the shorts for spinning!  The legs was not tight at all, and was ‘loose’.  Whilst the legs didn’t hug the legs, it is actually a good thing if you are stretching and moving around a lot.  It was totally comfortable.  The waist is definitely ‘tight’ side, and if you like a bit more space, size up.  There are Side pockets, not sure why you need them for yoga, but for running, they could hold few light and flat items.  Not for phones though."
4.0,"Actually I have bought 2 pairs of these and my son loved them. My husband washed and dried the first pair and they shunk a lot, so don't wash and dry them. But they do run a bit small. He wears a 2 and I bought a 3.5 the second time and they are only about a half size too big. So size up!"
4.0,It an elastic bracelet with medal spikes. My wrist is 6.5 and it just fits but I still feel a pinch now and then.
4.0,Most comfortable that I own
4.0,"Esta blusa la compra para un regalo, es un poco transparente la tela, creo que debería usarse con un top debajo. El modelo es bonito, solo que si eres como yo mejor pude una talla menos."
4.0,Good suit for the price. Used as a Halloween costume. Zipper only lasted for 2 parties but that was all I needed it for
4.0,"Excellent price for DRC's!!  I have always liked them, and find them lasting very well, but this pair somehow were the wrong size.  Not sure if I ordered it wrong, or it was just sent wrong.  At any rate, I was able to get them on after a lot of struggle, but one sock rolled down and I could not get it to stay flat on the top.  Then, I couldn't get either one off without cutting them off!!  I will order more, as I do like DRC very much. and definitely like the price I find at Amazon.."
4.0,"I really like this outfit for my son, it’s alsays a gamble buying clothes online but I am very happy with the quality of this outfit. The onesie is very soft and true to size. The pants and jacket aren’t as soft but they are a very nice comfortable and quality fabric. Overall this is a great winter outfit and it looked and feels great on my son!"
4.0,"Love the dress! Wish it had a longer torso, if you are pudgy you might be asked when you are due.  But quality is good and comhy"
4.0,I like these biker shorts to work out. I’m short but I love the height of the shorts. Stays in place. I don’t like that it doesn’t have good tummy hold but hey that’s why I go to the gym. Nice and smooth material.
4.0,"Reason for Purchase:  I purchased the Men’s Fashion Polyester Skinny Neck Tie, bowtie and pocket square for my husband, who wears ties every day at work and wear suits frequently.  The blue background with the white and orange really caught my eye and can go with a lot of different shirt colors and styles.<br />Merchandise:  The pack came with a skinny neck tie, a bowtie and a pocket square.  It has a dark blue background with alternating white and orange flowers, the petals alternate their orientation too for a neat pattern. The skinny tie is a typical length and width of a “skinny” tie and the bow tie is a standard size.  The pocket square is a typical six inches by six inches.<br />The good: The color combination of these pieces is absolutely wonderful. The sizes are great and nothing out of the ordinary. People looking from afar will never notice these were a cheaper purchase when put up next to a shirt and suit.<br />The not so good: The quality of this merchandise is okay.  It will definitely last for a while but it is not the same quality as the very expensive ties you would buy at stores such as Lord and Taylor or Nordstroms.<br />Recommendation: I would recommend this set of tie, bowtie, and pocket square for anyone looking for an okay quality and great color combination.<br />Please note I received this product at a discount for an honest review."
4.0,"I bought these specifically for the case, which I'm using to carry a high quality pair of folding sunglasses. Most of the expensive folding sunglasses come with cases that offer zero protection from being crushed, this case fits my perfectly and is quite sturdy. Regarding the glasses that came with them... Im happy with my vision so i wouldn't wear those in a million years"
4.0,Cute little shirt. The shirt did shrink up in length. Maybe avoid the dryer.
4.0,Good material and terminations
4.0,"Lo compré para el cumpleaños #4 de mi hija. Me gustó mucho el diseño de la tela, ya que la fiesta fue de unicornio"
4.0,Scarf and tie are very nice. Couldn’t get the tattoo to come off so that’s the reason for the four stars. Great price for what you get
4.0,I little bit hot
4.0,These have a great look and my customers love them. However one arrived bent and when I tried to bend it straight it snapped in two.
4.0,"The camisole itself is nice, I liked the fabric and the print. The length was good, but it was too small in the chest for me (32G). I got a medium and usually wear about a size 12. The lower half of the cami fit fine, it was just the top that was too small and compressed my breasts too much and in a very unflattering way."
4.0,"Great bag! Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the zipper. After only a month, it will only zip half way."
4.0,Just wish the pockets were deeper
4.0,"I really like these! Super cute design, very comfortable and cool feeling. Would recommend"
4.0,"Very cute bracelet, a bit smaller than I wanted but very happy with my purchase"
4.0,"I bought this dress for a “luau” fundraiser. The material was somewhat cheap, and the dress was pretty short for my taste (I am 5’6”). Overall I still thought the dress was pretty cute for the price! I would have ordered a size up than I normally do, though. The tie around the waste allows you to make it more flattering."
4.0,Purchased size xl fits as expected. The length was just right.
4.0,It is a great product. Only thing is their sizes run a little to big compared to a normal shoe size.
4.0,All the colors  are nice would order again  when they go on sale again  have not washed  them yet  to see if i need to air dry or dryer  the colors or so deep may have to wash on cold water. They are nice for casual  wear .
4.0,Up close it’s not the nicest 5 star dress but for the price I thought it was perfect!
4.0,Got them for my mother in law as a gift. They are nice just not what I expected.
4.0,They are soft and nice . My opinion size S/M is a little too big for a small
4.0,"I feel this necklace may not last a long time but it is beautiful & dazzling. Would be great for prom, weddings & formal occasions."
4.0,Not gonna lie the Suga one came damaged lowkey hurt my soul had marker on his face 😔 but all the other ones came perfectly intact.
4.0,It's a good belt for the price.
4.0,the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is kind of light when compared to other sunglasses I have. the darkness helps sunlight from causing inconvenience especially when driving in the evening. a darker version would be much more helpful. the rest of the qualities are very good.
4.0,Fit was as expected. A little too long but waist can be folded over to shorten it. Heavy enough fabric that it is not see through.
4.0,I had to order up a size so the shirt would fit but the straps were too long. I had to hem them to get them to fit. But it was still an adorable outfit. Many compliments
4.0,"It's a really nice piece, and goes with alot of the other things I wear. The only thing I don't like is that it's started to turn my wrist green in certain places."
4.0,Great quaility
4.0,"This is a great shirt, but here's the thing...I took other reviewers' advice and ordered a size up and it's WAY too big! I should have sized DOWN, not UP.<br />I'm 145 lbs, 34C and the XL is swimming on me. It's wide and the sleeves are all loose. It's doesn't even remotely look like it does on the model, on me, in this size.<br /><br />I normally wear Medium or Larges and I likely would have ordered a Large to play it safe had I not listened to the reviews that recommended to size up, and with how large the XL is, I'm sure a Medium would have provided the fit I was looking for.<br />Hopefully it shrinks in the wash! I don't have the time or patience to return it, so if it doesn't shrink I'll just be using it as a sleep/around the house shirt (like I needed another one of THOSE haha).<br /><br />The shirt is nice though. It's your typical t shirt material and it's very soft and comfy.  It's lightweight and sheer enough that you'd still want to match the color of your bra to the color of the shirt, but not so sheer that a nude/taupe bra would be visible.<br /><br />I recommend this shirt, but I'd definitely recommend sticking to your normal size. ;)"
4.0,"It was much bigger than I felt was described. My son wears it to hockey practice. Over his pads it fits a little better, but still big. I didn’t return it because he loves it so much."
4.0,Thin but cute.  I like the cap sleeve and flow of the dress.  All of my breast area was properly covered.  I was able to wear it on a recent interview.  The dress is a bit small in the bust.  I would want to size up if you are average to large busted.
4.0,I bought XL.<br />wonderful dress!
4.0,The shirt fits great. I’m glad I got a little bit bigger size otherwise my 36 DD boobs wouldn’t fit right. It’s a typical t-shirt with rubbery pictures. I’m worried about washing it and the characters coming off but otherwise it’s great.
4.0,Shirt is nice but material is not stretchy. Ordered for my daughter & she normally wears a large or xl depending. So I ordered an xl to play it safe. It fit but was snug so ordered another in a 2xl. Fits better but is still snugger than normal shirts.
4.0,Fit my 5yr old perfectly and in person it looks just like the picture!
4.0,The necklace is great quality. Its very beautiful and quite fashionable. The pendant is very large and the chain is very long though which makes it difficult to find things to wear with it. You can take the pendant off of the chain so you change the length. I have a black velvet string thing that I use for some of my pendants and I just tie it to whatever length looks best.
4.0,Like it. Bought Medium. Good fit.
4.0,Product was as described. Except they ran a little smaller the expected & they were very sheer .
4.0,"I really liked this dress when I received it. The color and material are very nice and when I put it on it felt nice on. I would have given this five stars, but I had to send it back due to it being to long. One good thing is, that I did find this particular dress color and pattern in a knee length!!"
4.0,Very cute dress. Definitely tighter than I would like. It’s not extremely forgiving in the tummy area either. I like the fabric & style of the dress. The strings on the side work well to adjust the length for a more customizable fit. I advise you to size up unless you’re looking for they body con fit
4.0,Bigger than expected but customer service was great with returns!
4.0,"Material is soft and comfortable, the crotch length is a little long, but leg length is perfect to my feet (I’m 5’ 6’ weight 140 lbs slender waist long legs)."
4.0,Super cute but they run extremely small
4.0,I love the airy ness of this dress but seem very closed off at the chest kinda fits weird on the top.
4.0,"Exactly what I expected, just a tiny bit smaller than I thought it would be."
4.0,Perfect for my Sandtrooper costume. If they only come in white I wouldn't have to paint them. True to the size and very comfortable.
4.0,These look great and have nice compression but they have a tendency to slide down during a busy 12 hour shift. I find myself having to pull them up several times.
4.0,"Nice sweater, great for a breezy summer day! Wrinkles really easily though!"
4.0,A great accessory for a tie.
4.0,I ordered a large and it fit like a medium. Should have ordered an XL. Go one size larger than you normally would. Nice shirt otherwise.
4.0,"I love most anything relating to JAWS.  I am giving the wallet 4 stars because it is just the tiniest bit too small for paper money -- it sticks out a little bit.  It's not the end of the world, but just enough to make it a 4 start purchase instead of 5."
4.0,It's ok. You get what you pay for 😉
4.0,Worked well for our party!
4.0,I needed a clear bag for concerts as that is the rule several venues have gone to. I purchased this one due to price.  It has held up after attending three rowdy shows and being stuffed full of things.
4.0,It kinda big but very nice
4.0,"My husband loves this watch. He wears it everday. Great looking, tough."
4.0,"Bought the cobalt blue - nice colour and material. I am 155 pounds, 5'4&#34;, and normally wear a medium. I ordered a size up (Large), based on other reviews but it was too big for me. It seems the medium would have been fine. Will have to get it adjusted. It is also very long also, so will also have to adjust it as well."
4.0,"Unlike some reviewers have stated, these pants cannot be rolled down to a full length hem. They are true capri length (22"" inseam on size M) including the 2-1/2"" sewn cuff. The 12 inch rise with flat front and elasticized waist in back create a perfect ""paper bag"" high waist when cinched thru the belt loops. Fit well without a belt too. Nice summer weight material (cotton/flax) that hopefully won't shrink too much in the wash since they are true to size new. Note: The gray shade is very warm - more like a dark taupe - in case you're looking for a cooler tone. Thumbs up overall and I'm going to order another pair in beige.<br /><br />Update: Machine washed in cold water, dried flat with no shrinkage. Lots of loose threads needed to be cut off from seams, button holes and hems which are not double sewn. No surprise that construction isn't great at this price. Gentle handling to prevent further fraying will be necessary with this garment."
4.0,"This shirt is made well and looks great, but the fit is rather large. Will fit great on top of layers."
4.0,"I like this chain quite a lot. It is strong and the adjustable rubber ends fit any glasses I've tried. I feel confident that my reading glasses won't fall. It looks great too.<br /><br />However, they advertised that the chain is 70 cm long (27+ inches) and it is not. My chain, not including the ends, is only about 60 cm (24 inches). I bought this chain to get the extra length so I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />Other than that discrepancy, this is a great, albeit expensive, eyeglass chain."
4.0,Lovely ring. Prongs do catch on clothing. Very shiny but loses the initial shine after washing hands a few times. Nice ring.
4.0,"Bought this for my husband as he needed an overnight bag.  Works great, perfect for a weekend.  Has held up nicely so far!"
4.0,Cute but wider than it is long. Should be longer it’s short and wide.
4.0,Haven't had it long enough to really tell!!
4.0,It is a good product that work well
4.0,"when I go to a brick and mortar store, I wear a 22 or 24 on top.  I have several woman within/roamans tunics and shirts.  I love the 100% cotton.  it presents a challenge, however, in that they shrink; I read reviews to try to determine how much, but sometimes reviewers don’t even mention shrinkage!  really?  in my ww/roamans tees, I have sizes from l (18/20) to 3x (30/32).  I ordered this one in a 2x (28/30) in the coral circles because it was cheap.  it’s actually a pretty pattern in person, the circle is red lines.  I wore it right away and noticed that the boatneck is short, much shorter than I would expect for a 28/30.  part of the reason, I ordered up on this one is that I bought two boatneck tunics 3 years ago and the neckline was several inches shorter than I needed and indeed more narrow than where the bottom of the sleeve attaches to the body of the shirt.  then I washed my new coral circles boatneck.  it still looks great, no fading-which I must say, is true of the tunics I have had for 4 years.  however, new tee shrank 2”+ in length and more in width.  I realize cotton shrinks and I try to order my tees/tunics accordingly.  with the boatneck, if you have broad shoulders (and maybe average) you might wanna size up one or two sizes.  if I order another of this style, I will size up again, so the neckline is more in line with my shoulders."
4.0,Worn as a top. Too much tummy to wear as a dress.
4.0,This watch comes in a nice black box. I have had it almost two weeks and it is keeping perfect time. The band feels a bit cheep but I really like the way the clasping mechanism works. I feel like this watch is well worth the money
4.0,Super pretty just didnt fit the way I needed it to. The fabric and color are beautiful!
4.0,"I purchased this crop top with the intention of using it in a Panda halloween costume. It worked well for that, and for so much more! I've ended up wearing it to many themed dances at my school, and occasionally in day-to-day life. It's very versatile! I ordered the Large, which fit well but relatively tight on me (I'm 5&#34;5' and 180). I do with they went one size larger, but even on my relatively large it was fine since I didn't mind it being tight.<br /><br />There are a couple of things to keep in mind before purchasing this shirt: it's pretty see-through, which isn't necessarily bad but should be noted. It's cropped in a really nice way--not too short but not too long! The fabric is thin but I've been impressed with how well it's held up: I've worn it dozens of times and don't see any signs of wear or tearing.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase. I do wish the price were a bit lower, but for what you get I think it's worth it. I'll consider buying more in different colors in the future!"
4.0,"I like the tie, but after about 25 times of wearing it, I'm starting to notice fraying."
4.0,"Arrived earlier then anticipated, but had no O rings to clasp it together."
4.0,Really like this dress. I wear a 12/14 and purchased an XL. It fit perfectly. I'm 5'7.5&#34; and curvy. I will wear a blazer over it for work.
4.0,Looks great but doesn't work for my body !!!
4.0,The dress was very nice. I usually wear a size 10 or 12 depending on how a dress is made. Ordered the xl and it fit body wise but the bust area was a little big. Nonetheless I still loved it and received many compliments!!!
4.0,"Really cute, the cut is a little bit different in the arms (good). I was concerned you would see my strapless bra on the sides, but you couldn't!"
4.0,"So far so good, wallet holds up nice. I like the look and feel. My only complain is the size, which is difficult to gauge online. It's a little bit on the larger side to what I prefer, but it's not unreasonable. It has a lot of pockets, so there is no end to the different arrangement options available. Overall, I'd recommend!"
4.0,Beautiful socks. Not as thick as expected. Fairly warm. Nice stocking stuffers. Reasonably priced.
4.0,"I ordered this for my trip to cancun. I wanted a 1 piece instead of my 2 piece swimsuits. Halters kill my neck due to my girls being so big. I'm 5'2&#34;, 125 pounds, and wear size 34DDD in bra size. I ordered the medium and it fit perfectly. No side boob or uniboob (my big concern with swimsuits that have no underwire). The pads in the breast area are a nice round shape. Not some Madonna cone bra shape. I ordered the black and green suit. The black makes you look even thinner and smoothes everything out. I washed it after trying it on & hung it up to dry. There is no color fading from washing. I can't wait to test it out on my trip. Best part is, I'll be comfortable without worrying about my chesticles popping out for all to see. I'll put this at 5 stars once I put it through my trip."
4.0,"I'm a woman with a curvier waist and bust, this fit nicely."
4.0,"The dress looks absolutely great and just like the picture. The top is see-through but not that much, since when I put it on I was wearing a dark blue tank top. Your bra straps will most likely show so it's recommended to wear a strapless bra. I'm not too fond of the straps though since you have to tie them. Also, sadly I am 5'0 and this dress went past my knees rather than right above like in the picture."
4.0,"nice cross, good value"
4.0,"good value for the money, a little heavy"
4.0,I used the bags for grocery shopping. I don’t like the material they are made out of because I cannot stand them up to fill them. However they seem to be durable and they do fold up to a small size which I like very much. I also like the color. All in all I think they will serve the purpose.
4.0,The pens were just as expected and a perfect replacement for the original.  Thank you!
4.0,The colors are gorgeous and fits perfect....well worth the price and fits great!
4.0,"Good quality but really run small around the the lower band.  May have to return, not too comfortable. I usually wear a m-l.  I ordered an  xl and it fit tight"
4.0,Im short so it is a bit long even with heels and much more revealing on me than in the picture
4.0,"I ordered this Aiyino men’s short sleeve T- shirt for our son, and he says that he does the white color with the black hems, the crewneck design and the length of the shirt.<br />Our son does like that this athletic T- shirt fits him pretty well and he says that they are comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off as needed. We do like that the texture of the fabric is soft, smooth to touch and easy on his skin. Our son says he has been wearing it for the last 2 weeks and that so far, so good, as he has washed it twice and it still retained the color and quality. He likes that it matches most of his pants and shoes and it seems to be good value for bucks, considering the quality and the price point. I would recommend it."
4.0,An autographed TJ Oshie hat
4.0,"This is really a beautiful pendant necklace.  I'm very picky about necklaces and the chain was too short for me.  so I was able to change the chains very easily.  The bail at the top of the pendant is large and open by design, which allows the wearer to change the chain to any other chain or omega that is thin enough to slide through. I was able to change my chain very easily.<br /><br />The pendant is over 5 cts and this scale is quite nice to be worn alone.  There are plenty of beautiful feminine details on the pendant, but not so many that they get lost.  The focal point is the lavender CZ, which resembles an amethyst, February's birthstone, which is mine as well.<br /><br />I think the size and sparkle of the CZ is a great look and i'm glad I got it.<br /><br />It's a WIN and I recommend.  (Just plan on getting (or using) a different chain :P)!!<br /><br />If you find my review(s) helpful, please check the box below.  Thanks!!"
4.0,"I really really liked this shirt, but I'm on the heavier side, and this material just shows every roll."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Wore it to a wedding and got a lot of complaints. Lower cut than I'm used to and tighter, but beautiful! Not disappointed! Just be sure to order at least 1 size bigger, if not 2!"
4.0,"I was looking for a natural-fiber watchband (after years of leather) and this came up. It's washable, and watchbands can get grody, so I bought two. No complaints!"
4.0,I was hoping this dress would fit.... it is tight in the hips. Order 2 sizes up.<br />I love the sleeves.
4.0,Pretty wings. Bought matching adult and child ones for Halloween. I wish they had velcro or finger straps to extend the wings.
4.0,"This is a pretty, low-profile case. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that the liner was coming loose on the inside lid, but that is a quick fix with a dot of glue, so I wasn't too bothered."
4.0,The person I bought it for absolutely loves the purplish color. She says it makes her think of the northern lights. My only disappointment was that up close you can see some pixellation that takes away from the overall beauty of the &#34;stone&#34;. The overall value for the money was good.
4.0,Nice glasses if you have a smaller face.
4.0,"I am a 36B and got a size small (4-6). I am usually a medium, but the small fits very well so I would say this may run a little large. This sweater is very cute, gorgeous and cozy. However most wrap shirts have a hidden button or tie ribbon inside the shirt opposite the outside tie to keep the wrap together and secure so you get that nice v neckline and also won't flash everyone. This does not have anything except the tie on the outside. Once you start to move around, even minimally, the whole shirt starts to gape open and becomes a very deep plunging neckline. One simple button on the inside would fix this which is why I am only giving 4 stars. I am going to sew in my own button and/or ribbon to fix this issue for me, but I wish I didn't have too."
4.0,Pretty shirt. Delicate but still sturdy
4.0,"Great Shirt. I love jack wolfskin shirts but have found their sizing to be inconsistent. This shirt, while running a little small, still fits."
4.0,This is a lovely set of necklaces. They are both 8 inch chain link chains with a 2 inch extender. They both  have a small lobster claw clasps. The chains are really tiny so they will get tangled quite a bit but they have a delicate classy look. The bar is 2 inches long and rests gently against the décolletage. The disc is about 1/3 of an inch in the drop/diameter. Both of these have a really great color to start with. I took a picture of what they look like next to my 14 kt rope chain. If it is handled with care and doesn’t get wet then the color might maintain it selves for a while especially since it’s 14k over stainless steel and not any kind of copper which would turn fast no matter what. So these are pretty decent. You can’t beat paying $20.00 for both. That’s about the cost of costume/plastic jewelry anyway. I know I can get a few years out of these if I’m super careful.
4.0,"I usually wear a small. So I ordered a medium and that fit more the way I wanted. I wish it was an off the shoulder style like I thought, but hey it works!"
4.0,These are a present
4.0,The wrighting is barely visible
4.0,"great product,,great price,,i highly recommend this product"
4.0,"Super flattering. I took the pads out of the top immediately though because they made a very weird line/didn't feel super secure. Luckily, they were easily removed and it looked great without them.<br /><br />Wasn't suffocatingly tight. The cut on the legs in the front was comfortable (not super high).<br /><br />Feels like it could be sturdier fabric so I will have to see how it holds up."
4.0,Product is good quality but won’t lie the air tag tends to pop off every now and then maybe it’s because I’m always up and down stairs but maybe it would be different for you :) either way it’s pretty cheap for a good quality product so it’s a win 👍🏾
4.0,Very cute.  It's for my grandson to wear on St pattys day.
4.0,"really like it.  Fit as expected, ordered a M.  Nice and low cut in the back.  The top is a bit gappy in the front, so if you are smaller chested, it could expose you."
4.0,fits great with a lot of stretch. great deal
4.0,This runs a little small.
4.0,"Fit was as expected but I wish the manufacturer would use a higher grade and more dense (heavy) T-shirt stock for these shirts... obviously, this would likely alter the price point.  The print work was very well done, perfectly centered on the shirt."
4.0,"Feb 2006:<br />I'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers.  I run around the house in socks.  I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up.<br /><br />Dec. 2007:<br />Still wearing them, no problems other than staining, but can't fault the slippers, I spill things and drop stuff and even wear them outside occasionally."
4.0,"El color esta bello,yo cogi talla 16mm y me quedo perfecto,solo que no es de muy buena calidad,pero pagas lo que quieres."
4.0,"Feels good on my face. Looks cute, and is a great price. 😎"
4.0,It is so pretty & sparkles like diamonds. The ring & bracelet are tight but will work. The earrings & choker are as expected.<br />Great for the price.
4.0,"Ordered Dark Grey because when I went to order there was no black to order.  But dark grey is black as black can be, so worked in my favor.  Ordered for my husband's birthday will see if he likes them and review after that."
4.0,3x is really a 1x. Pretty otherwise.
4.0,The lock is not a tsa approved would give it 5 stars if it wa.  all three worked great my husband was able to handle all 3 with out a problem even with a car seat on top of one. It holds a lot of stuff I didn't even have to extend the bag to fit our stuff (I am an over packer) the luggage still looks great we flew and took a cruise.
4.0,"Soft, washes well and comfy. Sizing is off and runs very large"
4.0,good for the money<br />ik for the SHOW.. looks good<br />BUT BUILD QUALITY..<br />ehhh<br />Chinglish trinket but fits the bill
4.0,"This is a nice sweater, but it looks bulkier in person than in the picture.  The distressed ends are cool, but I think it will not hold up under a lot of use.  Its a cool sweater, I did not realize it was 100% synthetic until after I ordered it.  Being acrylic, its essentially made of plastic and with the amount of microplastics in the news I am concerned about that."
4.0,More floppy than I wanted but I am a woman with a smaller head. Still I like the color and I wear it a lot.
4.0,"My husband looked great in it, he said it was comfortable."
4.0,Fots great and feels so cozy. Just what i was looking for. Not to thick and has room if you layer up.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:18ebf5fa45d19f49c86bd55b7041693a]] Because the description of this shirt says it's a ""baseball jersey,"" I originally thought it was a Kris Bryant jersey. I didn't realize it was Kobi Bryant, the basketball player, until I Googled Mamba. As far as the quality of the shirt goes, it's not bad, though it's a bit thinner than another baseball jersey I have. The only label inside is a tiny size label with no care instructions or list of materials. Adding a care label would be a helpful addition. I can't say this shirt is anything less than what the description says it is, but I will only give it 4 stars since there are no care or materials labels and it's thin and a bit itchy."
4.0,"I love this dress.  After ordering from other vendors with no success in the fit, I ordered this one and it fits perfect.  Would definitely recommend ordering this again.  I had a lot of compliments on it as well."
4.0,"This is definitely a very attractive and well-designed bag.  It's not real leather, though -- it's PU leather (meaning there's a bit of leather coated with polyurethane).  It definitely looks and feels like vinyl.  Still, the color is rich and beautiful, and I love all the zippered pockets and compartments.  There's a sueded outside pocket with two zippered compartments -- a small one (perfect for keys) and a larger one (perfect for my phone).  The bag itself closes at the top with two magnetic buttons, but there's also a zipper (making sure nothing you put in the bag will fall out).  There are additional deep zippered compartments on each side of the bag -- this bag holds a lot!<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the cross-body strap, mainly because it's too long to wear as a regular shoulder bag.  I do own a few cross-body bags, but they are much smaller than this.  I would love to wear this as a regular purse, but the strap (which is adjustable) is too long.  The measurements of the bag differ from the product description -- it is 9 inches high, 11 inches long, and 4.5 inches wide (at the footed bottom).  This is considerably bigger than the measurements provided in the description.  Because of this, it would work much better as a shoulder bag, rather than a cross-body bag.<br /><br />All that said, I do really like this bag.  I will try to use it as a shoulder bag -- I just need to get used to the long strap."
4.0,Yes that's what I was expecting for thanks
4.0,"They are comfortable, but the main hole I was using ripped after about a week."
4.0,Nice and fun to wear
4.0,I love the dress it fits perfect the only thing is the purple is not as dark as it is in the picture and I gave it a 4-star because of the color but overall it is a beautiful dress in my husband loves it
4.0,"These were fine for my teenager. He wanted something comfy and the fit is as expected. He is a tall, 6'2&#34; and these are ok, but could be longer. Overall, just as we expected them to be."
4.0,This time piece suits my need for a compact [thin]<br />pocket watch. The case is smooth and shines!<br />The stem does get &#34;loose&#34; fairly easily -- time<br />unwittingly reset -- requires caution that way.
4.0,The dress is absolutely gorgeous. It looks better than on the picture. It is rose gold.
4.0,The watch is all I expected.  It was easy to set and the band was easy to make smaller.  The face is darker than I'd like when in bright sunlight but the light is very good.
4.0,"They are super cute but they were big, so no coverage (loose) over the nose, chin and cheeks.  :("
4.0,Warm sweater
4.0,Works great and are comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Good, solid riding gloves! They’re not perfect, a little thin in the materials, hard to get off! But overall, would buy again."
4.0,"Decent quality! Great to use as a wrap, scarf,shawl etc."
4.0,"I replaced my leather deployment clasp band with this Speidel band. I removed a couple links, following the instructions, as I have thin wrists. The band is great. It's easy on/off. No fiddling with a clasp or snap. My only complaint is the cost, but a replacement deployment clasp leather band for a Hamilton watch is around $150. If you have hairy wrists, you may lose a few hairs. The band comes with 2 sets of pins and instructions."
4.0,Cómo en las fotos. Se ve bonito para un regalo sencillo.
4.0,"First things first, I really like this brand. I have gotten a lot of items from this company and I love them. I will say though with these particular color of shorts, for some reason they appeared a little tighter on the thigh than the same size in just the matte black. It might be the material on the pleather ones that make them seem tighter but nonetheless still cute. I love the reg black ones soo much, wear them all the time. Got a size L in both."
4.0,"Hat was ok. A little big  and quality, especially for the price, was def not what I expected. Seller was nice and did accept my return for a refund."
4.0,"Looks nice, oversized and did not shrink much. Has to be ironed."
4.0,"It could be due to my body shape; I have small breasts and  relatively bigger hips and butt..so it's a bit tight in that area even though I ordered my usual size. It's a nice dress and I received compliments but if I had thought it over sooner, I would've exchanged it for one size larger."
4.0,Was a cool costume but it it was also a little tight.
4.0,Very very petite earrings that really hug my ears. I am very pleased with them!  They have a minimalist look.
4.0,"I have recently started doing Zumba.  I have long hair, that I pull back into a ponytail, but I also have bangs that I'm trying to grow out.  These bangs do not reach my ponytail, and bobby pins do not hold them in completely when I am Zumba-ing.  I have been looking for a headband that will help with bangs, as well as help me when I am sweating to prevent sweat from dripping into my eyes.<br /><br />This headband is just the thing!  It is wide, and easy to put on.  It fits my large head without issue.  It is the first headband thing I have worn that has not slipped off my head while doing something!  I was worried it would not stay throughout my Zumba class, but it did!  And it looked cute too!<br /><br />My only reason for deducting a star is that it felt a little itchy.  I am not sure if that is just because I was sweating and it was holding the sweat on my skin, or if it was the fabric.  It was not extremely uncomfortable, just a little bothersome.  I will continue to use this during my workouts, because it did work so well.  Maybe after washing it a few times it will not be itchy.  Or maybe I will get used to it.  Either way, this product is great and keeps my hair out of my face, and my sweat out of my eyes!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
4.0,"Will need to wear a tank top under this because of such a low cut, but it is cute and comfortable. Not see through."
4.0,Its a great gift just fit too tightly for the person I intended to give it to and had to lend it to someone else even though it was the largest size I could get. Still a great present and looks great while feeling great.
4.0,I'm a thicc girl with a thicc neck. All but 3-4 of these fit fairly comfortably. Definitely pleased.
4.0,"This cape is exactly what I was looking for. I plan on being Mary Sanderson for Halloween and it's a great fit for that look. I'd highly recommend double checking the size for length before ordering. It's a thicker material which I think will be great to keep me warm for trick-or-treating, but I'm concerned it might be a bit warm for a Halloween party I am attending. I also wish the clasp was just a bit easier to use but for the few times I'm planning on wearing it, it'll be just fine."
4.0,so far so good.  These glasses look good on my son and are holding up well for him and he is tough on his apparell.
4.0,"Cute shirt, stitching around the collar was a little sloppy. But you get what you pay for. I ordered the XXL, and it was a bit too big. (Which I'm definitely not used to) I washed and dried it,  hoping it would shrink and it didn't.  It still looks good but I wish I had gone a size smaller.  Would have been more flattering.<br />For reference I am 5'3 and 220 lbs. 46 inch bust (DD)"
4.0,"Light weight fits well with the little bit of stretch in the material feels good.<br /> You must enjoy the skulls to wear this dress. Looks even better with the petticoat, cute."
4.0,"It's a great looking watch for 0.085% of the price of the Rolex this is based off of ([[ASIN:B00N10ZC3Q Rolex Daytona Platinum Watch Ice Blue Ceramic 116506 Unworn 2016]]) ($58,515.00 last time I checked). I like the calendar and how it automatically adjusts each day, even though it may need to be adjusted at the beginning of the month. Unfortunately, I'm a 24/7 watch wearing kind of a guy, and this didn't fit my wants.<br /><br />The problems I have with this watch are more personal problems rather than practical problems, but perhaps something you may take into consideration.<br />My biggest gripe is that since it is a luminous watch (and only on the minute & hour hands), it isn't suitable for night time use, which is when I'm usually awake.<br />The watch is a little too big and heavy for my tastes. Coming from a Columbia compass watch ([[ASIN:B00DI2PWWI Columbia Men's CT011-330 Switchback Digital Display Quartz Multi-Color Watch]]), I didn't like how it (the Columbia) &#34;sunk down&#34; every time my palm was facing towards me such as when I'm writing or typing. I never got to compare the difference since I didn't remove any links.<br />I'm not a fan of the screw-down crown which makes changing the time nearly impossible without the correct tools. But I was very happy to see that the watch arrived with the correct time so it isn't a huge issue.<br /><br />It's a great looking watch if you're going to an event, but it's not for wearing at all *times*."
4.0,"This is a basic t-shirt, and fits exactly as I expected it to.  I typically wear an XL shirt, and this one was just right -- it is long enough to do a side knot if I want, but not so long that I can't wear it untucked.  The print is super cute! No complaints!  I do wish the fabric was a little softer, but otherwise, it's a great shirt and will get a lot of use. :)"
4.0,Thnk's
4.0,Fabric is a little slinkier than I expected but it's a great dress
4.0,I orded a size to big thinking it would be to small. My mistake  as it is true to sixe and the 3x is slightly large i will.be wearing with a belt for a lil shape. Love the lace quality  is good
4.0,"I bought this dress for my 6 yr old for Oktoberfest and the dress part fit her well and looked great.  The only ding was the shirt was way smaller than the dress and she couldn't fit it over her head.  Returned the dress for a larger side, so she can grow into it and wear more than 1 year.  This is a light cotton dress and the work is very nice, so could be worn as any other dress for events, play, or daily wear."
4.0,Overall happy with the fit although the inseam is approximately an inch too long.  Not enough of an issue for me to not recommend them but enough that I won't buy more.
4.0,Such a cute little outfit for toddlers
4.0,"Bought this skirt for a wedding I will be in. I normally wear a size 10/12 in jeans. I ordered the 14/16 to be safe, My waist is my skinniest point and it's still snug, but fits. I REALLY like this, I would totally recommend it. The material does not look cheap. Or feel cheap. There's no liner but that doesn't bother me. I'm 5&#34;2' and I'm barefoot in this picture. Hope my review helps!"
4.0,Big but lovely!
4.0,Very convenient to clip over your normal eye glasses but the sun shades are just a tad too dark.  Maybe they can offer a version with gradient lens?
4.0,"This Amazon Aware Men's Cotton Crew T-Shirt is incredibly smooth, soft, and comfortable. I got this one size too big in a 3X (I normally wear a 2X because I can't stand tight clothes) because all the Amazon Aware clothes that I had bought before had shrunk 1 size and gotten shorter.<br /><br />I tried it on before washing it on cold delicate and dried it on Ultra Low and it fit loosely. I tried it on again, and found that it had shrunk about a size, as I expected. That meant that sizing up one made it fit perfectly after I washed and drie dit.<br /><br />Drying this on Ultra Low / Low seemed to have no detrimental effect, just as it was with all my other Amazon Aware clothes. It was also pretty much wrinkle-free which is a huge bonus.<br /><br />Very pleased with the quality and design of Amazon Aware apparel.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

4.0,"My husband loved the shirt, but I read several reviews that said it ran small. I ordered an XL because of that, and it was HUGE! Seemed larger than most XLs. Still like the shirt, but returning and ordering a L instead."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter to cosplay in. They seem to fit ok, but the fastenings are weird. It's a clear plastic strip like an invisible bra strap, and they hook together. Also, the bottoms don't give any traction on rugs or tile floors, she has slipped a few times. I'm going to try putting some hot glue in a few of the grooves on the bottom and see if that helps."
4.0,It is hard to open when you have it on.  Very pretty.
4.0,"This dress is NOT red. I've attached a photo showing the difference. It's orange. It is a pretty dress nonetheless. You will need spanx with this. It's VERY stretchy. I bought a size up,  because I don't like my dresses to cling to me. I'm 5'4 size 11. It stops below my knees."
4.0,it was smaller than expected.
4.0,"Lovely gloves, but felt a bit small and difficult to get on at first.  Must wear them a little bit to stretch out for comfort.  But after wearing a few times, these beautiful gloves now fit very comfortably."
4.0,I love the suit.... However the staves in the bra part stick out and are not comfortable so I had to take the out.
4.0,I love the wood cross but the cord is too short; will definitely replace.
4.0,Shirt is great. Runs very large though.
4.0,"Great for those who want a lightweight mask to avoid being arrested or participating in a riot, but like any other mask, these will not stop a virus from spreading."
4.0,This is a much lighter of a material than expected but good material it was more of a light chiffon. It’s a little tighter in the shoulders. I would recommend s size up.
4.0,"I really loved this tankini style as noted the pink/black/purple version is the top only, no bottoms included. I ordered in  large and then in XXL (no XL available when I ordered). I am 5'5/145/36D. The large was a bit tighter on my chest than I preferred, but the XXL was way too big. I kept the large and ordered boy shorts in purple and black to go along with the tank."
4.0,I really love it. It’s so beautiful
4.0,Clasp ripped easily (still able to wear) but other than that good quality
4.0,The material is nice but it's a little big.
4.0,Worked great in New York.
4.0,Received product on time with Good quality lather.
4.0,"Right off the bat you can tell these are not authentic leather pouches and that they really are made from ""leather material"" like the description says. They look good but definitely need to be aired out because they smell very chemically. The smell does go away so that is a good thing. Other than that, these pouches are good and sturdy. The zipper is also strong and doesn't seem like it will break after a few uses. The pouches are big enough to hold pretty much anything you want. They help keep you bag organized. They are a little on the pricey end though. for pouches that are not real leather, they could be a little cheaper. Good looking pouches that work well but just a little pricey."
4.0,"I like the concept, but we are in the midst of a severe drought, so I can't test it.  Pray for rain."
4.0,Very Hip.
4.0,Well made purse but they only thing I would improve is the zipper. It’s kinda cheap but everything else is awesome.
4.0,"The lug bars are too short, on the 20mm at least. That said, if you have bars already, which you should, just take the ""quick adjust"" ones out. No big deal. The strap itself looks great, love the vintage style. 4/5 stars for having to do some work to get it to fit properly."
4.0,Item was shipped fast and was as expected. The nose rubber pads were a little low on the glasses. They needed some adjustment.
4.0,"This is a different material (thinner, might snag) than the usual thermal however I do like it. The size chart did not assist me as this is pretty large and long on me, however it is rayon so it may shrink. My measurements are 5ft4inches and it came to almost the top of my knees. I'm 36 chest, 31.5&#34; waist and 42&#34; hip. I think I will reorder just a different size. I need to get some nice layers for Iceland!"
4.0,"Fits well. Was hoping for higher waist, better tummy bulge control but fits just at the waist and not overly tight on legs. Really like. I am 5'3"" 120lbs and ordered Small"
4.0,Very soft and very cute. Came earlier than it should've. My only complaint the the fur on the ears is a little sparse looking from the front... but I do love this little pouch nonetheless.
4.0,Nice material and I love the sleeves they’re not the short short sleeves that crawl under your armpit! This shirt will get used a lot for sure!
4.0,"Excelente calidad y precio, entalla bien"
4.0,"For the first time today, I tried this pair of earrings on, didn't like them on me....nothing to do with the earrings as they were lovely; however, over the years the hole in my left ear became larger so I had another hole put in and found I cannot wear ""dangling"" earrings as they don't ""drop evenly"". gave them to a friend and she loves them, said she will be wearing them often!."
4.0,Great for alot of characters.
4.0,Great ankle support for low tops and very good energy return when jumping. They were a half size too small which is my only complaint.
4.0,"I simply love the feel and look for casual dress. However, I purchased it to play golf and with temperatures in the mid to high 90’s and humidity above 80, the shirt looses it’s structure and the waist band become stretched and then it looks like a long polo that’s untux. So I only wear it for casual dress mostly indoors"
4.0,"Had this watch for over a year now. Still working, but wore it often and the band is starting to get worn and a little dirty (bc it's white). However, the face has the cute little butterflies to complement it. I think it would've been even cuter if the maker would've put a little butterfly on the second hand for movement...just my thoughts! Overall, nice watch. Wonder if they have more colors!"
4.0,Great leggings! Want a pair in every color.
4.0,"Super cute on the hanger, but did nothing for me unfortunately."
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter - ran about a size too large.
4.0,"This is an awesome skirt! It is see through up close, so plan on leggings but it is so worth it and was the hit of rainbow prom."
4.0,"I like very much my new set of FREE Soldier pants. Very comfortable and it fits me perfect. I was skeptical about the way sizes are given at first, but now I know what to order next time. It has plenty of pockets for any common accessories that we usually put on the belt. I like that has a pocket designed specifically for a knife, small flash light, pens, cell phone, Gerber, and much more.... as a technician, these are a must have items ready accessible at all times. This pant offers that accessibility. I didn't received the color I requested, but I am ok with the color I got."
4.0,"exactly as described.  Fabric is thicker and stiffer ( not a bad thing) than I expected and the colors are incredibly bright, just like the picture"
4.0,"It's a nice shirt, but way too small. It's supposed to be form fitting, but it was uncomfortably tight. I would go at least one, if not two, sizes smaller."
4.0,They are washable and do as advertised.  I just didn't love the prints. They are handy and practical.  I used after I washed my hair while it was wet. Did the trick of allowing my hair to dry naturally.
4.0,This is a nice watch but the watch sometimes stops even when worn daily. But it was a present for my wife and she loves it!!!!
4.0,"Cute, a little smaller than I envisioned, prices appropriately...."
4.0,"Unfortunately had to return it after wearing it for two days as it was just a bit too big. They don't have 1/2 sizes so I ordered a 9 as they recommend, and it was too large."
4.0,"Cute, but tiny. The picture makes them look larger."
4.0,"The product is as described, I thought I'd be a bit more like the images on the website."
4.0,Cute and comfortable shirt!  Somewhat thin but nice to wear around the house.  I would purchase it again.
4.0,Geat product. I would have liked if it is made little smaller in size.
4.0,"If the person is taller than 6 ft, the pants will be too short. I bought a large and the pants had plenty of room in the waist, but the were very short in length."
4.0,"quality OK, not exceptional"
4.0,The pants were a little big so I just put my son in jeans with the shirt. I also had to use a safety pin to help keep the tie in place.<br />We love airplanes so it was a great last minute find for his first birthday party!<br />Thank you Amazon Prime!
4.0,"Cute, had a few strings to remove and the bow is attached with a safety pin but over all a nice look"
4.0,"A little tight to fit on, but really cute and nice quality!"
4.0,Top is too small and weird material.  Love the bottoms.
4.0,Decent product for the price.
4.0,Size is correct but colors are little to bright.
4.0,It's a beautiful dress with a nice flow and very flattering. I am size 6 and petite and ran a bit large.
4.0,Fit is excellent. . . comfortable.
4.0,Good product at low cost.
4.0,"great fit, nice and solid appearance"
4.0,Nice but a bit flimsy.
4.0,"I love how comfortable they are.  These are more of something I would only wear around the house as they are more a pajama or lazy day kind of pants.  I do not get much tummy control from them, but they do stay up.<br />I would say order to size.  I ordered up and they were a little big on me and could have went with my normal size."
4.0,"There are many bags with see-through windows.  This is the only larger one with cross body shoulder straps though.<br />The area of the clear window is large enough to fit 2 postcards the long ways.  Which is what I wanted.<br /><br />It is a bit fragile in construction however.  The zippers look like they won't last a lot of heavy use before breaking,<br />The black canvas material is good enough quality.  The lining is a thin material that catches easily on the zippers.<br /><br />For the price I expected a better quality bag.  I will keep it and enjoy using it, but can't use it as an everyday bag.<br /><br />Four stars only for the display area and size"
4.0,"Love these, great look and warm in snow."
4.0,best product could not fit me while
4.0,"Sad to say I love these bra their supportive and cute; unfortunately if you go by your size you will have some peekaboos time to time. My sister, auntie also brought this at the same time and ran into the same problem. Ladies if buying get a size up!!"
4.0,"nice item small flaws but overall good item to wear out, it is heavy just FYI. Glad i got it."
4.0,Stiff fabric. Not very breathable. Was not as cute as I anticipated
4.0,"These are just the cutest, I had to have them! I feel super fancy since it's Evian water haha!"
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress, I ordered a Medium (BLUE), which is my normal size and it was too big, so I am re-ordering a small or x-small which ever one will give me the better fit....."
4.0,I just received both bracelets!  They look great!  Thanks.
4.0,Great but too small
4.0,Bought this for my dad who had skin cancer.  Better than others but still really hot to wear.
4.0,It is sturdy and comfortable. Sparkly too. The only thing is the material is a bit thick for summer play.
4.0,"Love it, it fits nicely but make sure to read the size chart as I am a size 10 and needed a large. People always compliment me on this when I wear it. There were some loose threads upon arrival so I will be keeping an eye on that."
4.0,It runs pretty big. I recommend to get a size smaller. I normally get a large and it fits like an extra large.
4.0,Cute pj's - soft but run small! Buy one size up. My son loves them - easy to wash. Happy with purchase overall.
4.0,"I loved it, but the  back<br />ball is a little big."
4.0,"Chest is close and dress is shorter than expected, but it is super flattering. The scalloped hem will snag on random things."
4.0,"Very small, y order based on the size chart but is still small, so order at least one size bigger. The quality is no good, looks like polyester with the colors printed is not cotton, is very warm to wear in summer and on top take like a month to delivery. Forget about size exchange...will take forever.  Not satisfied.<br />I'm writing an update of my previous review to say that the seller contacted me immediately and sent me the right size and yes, fits perfect. I  can tell that there is a great customer services and the seller is very polite and helpful. The replacement arrives in less than a week.  My respects!"
4.0,It's a bit shorter and fitted than a similar style I ordered on Amazon (the good vibes muscle tank) but still a good fit. 35% cotton 65% polyester. Soft fabric. The print is just ok. A bit brighter than expected and sort of a stiff/plastic finish. Would have preferred a more worn and flexible style of print. But still cute. I can wear it out a bit in no time I am sure 😊
4.0,cute and a decent quality for the price
4.0,"I always buy larger than I usually wear when I buy from a Chinese company, they always run small.  I do love the shirt."
4.0,Nice coverup...fits as expected and is comfy.  Only thing is it tends to really hold onto wrinkles.
4.0,"I got this PJ set for my mother. The fit was perfect for my mother. The material was soft, comfortable, and cool. I will get another."
4.0,love love them two things I think one size up would have been better and these are more of a hip hugger. Love the feel and the comfort also the correct length which is usually hard for me to find
4.0,The sweatshirt is a good weight. However it is a bit looser around the chest and arms. I would recommend sizing down.
4.0,was satified
4.0,"I have around a 36-38 inch waist, so I got the large and it fits just about right. I have room to make it tighter, but there's not so much excess belt that it's wrapping around my waist. Easy to do and undo once you get the hang of it, so I wouldn't recommend trying to whip it off if you have to really use the bathroom in a rush....saying from personal experience as it doesn't seem it will come off in a hurry like a traditional belt. Regardless, it looks good, fits good, and stays secure all day long whether I'm getting up or standing repeatedly."
4.0,This dress is adorable really it is! It wasn’t stretchy it’s more of a linen type stiffness but it was doable. I returned it though because it was very short for me (I’m 5’9” and my butt was peeking) and the ruffles on the sleeve were a bit too dramatic for my liking. If the dress was longer I’d keep it even with the ruffle sleeves I would’ve sewn some of it.<br /><br />If this review has helped please let me know!!
4.0,"It is incredibly difficult to find this patch! My unit supply hadn't ordered these for the new OCPs, so I tried the highlighter trick on the old ACU patch. It still looked off, so I ordered a set here. The patch does have some minute differences in the direction of the background embroidery and that the minuteman's right arm is a little crooked, but it solves my issue, and it's a sturdy patch."
4.0,"I love this dress except the pockets only because they bulge and I haven't figured out a solution yet (I'm thinking either fabric tape or just sew them closed). I'm a US 12 - 14, 40DDD top for reference."
4.0,Very cute outfit and extremely nicely made. Love the feel of the fabric! Washes nicely and keeps it's shape and color. Purchased the 1-7y size for my 15 month old and it's pretty big but my son is petite. I do love everything about it and will be purchasing a different color one when he out grows this! Shipping was pretty fast too!
4.0,Make sure to size up! I typically wear a medium in most shorts and I ordered a large in the gray skirt and it fits perfectly! It's comfortable and the pocket is big enough to hold my smartphone!
4.0,"One of the better pouches on the ,market.  Not sure why I ordered a medium. I'm a 35&#34; waist, probably should have gone large. The material is quite soft and comfortable. They seem to be well made and I think they will last with regular laundering. My biggest problem is the price.  Not many people want to pay $18 - $20 for a single pair of underwear.  But if money is no object for you these are very comfortable briefs."
4.0,I exchanged it for a smaller size...the smaller size fit great. I got a lot of compliments
4.0,"This assortment of butterfly earrings is adorable for the amount of money you pay. They are colorful, lightweight, and seem to be well made. The hinges that open and close the earrings work smoothly and so far, I haven't had any that have been lost since wearing. I have a tendency to be hard on my jewelry, so this is a feat. I try not to spend too much on earrings as I am a person who loses quite a few a year. This selection, though, at least has quite a few backups for what I need. The only complaint I have regarding these earrings is the size of the latch. Since they are so small and my earlobes are a bit thicker, I sometimes have difficulties putting them on and taking them off. I can see these being the perfect size for a child or preteen."
4.0,"Another review said it’s a little too long to be a crop top and a little too short to be a shirt, and really, that’s the tea.<br />It fits alright, but I have a pretty medium build so “one size fits all” things tend to fit"
4.0,"These Capri's fit as expected. I do not like a tight waist and these feel tight at first, but the fabric allows enough stretch to be comfortable. I'm 5'4 and weigh 150."
4.0,"This is a very beautiful sports bra. I love the look and the soft material. The encouraging words ""Never Give Up"" are a nice, subtle touch on the back straps. Of course, I always wear a tank top or tee over the top of my bras because I have a lot of loose skin in my belly from weight loss, so no one but my hubby will ever see the message on the back. I still like knowing it's there though (here's to subliminal messaging!)<br /><br />The sheer mesh in the front makes for a sexy look, but it may be too sheer for some folks as it shows your cleavage really well through that.  Oh, and the ""phone packet"" (pocket?) on the back is kind of silly, really. First off, why would you want to put the phone in the middle of your upper back? Secondly, You cannot fit any modern smartphone into that pocket. It is about 3-fingers wide, so really not much use and impractical.<br /><br />the bra is listed as a high-impact sports bra - I definitely would not wear it for running or other high-impact sports. I am a size 32DD/34D so you'll need to take that into account here since bras sized for s/m/l/xl are often problematic for me due to my size falling slightly outside the ranges for small and medium.  I went with the medium in this bra.  The cup pads I would normally remove but they add a bit more support so I left them in when working out. The medium fit fairly well at first.<br /><br />I have worn this bra for strength training and a 30 minute cardio workout on the elliptical. After the elliptical (which is not much bounce) I noticed the bra was sagging and I could have benefited from adjustable straps (this bra does not have that) to make the fit better.  I suppose I could sew it to shorten the straps, but not sure I want to mess with that. I will probably just wear the bra for strength training ( low impact) or around the house, because it is comfortable for that."
4.0,...a short tail that looks kinda awkward when affixed to my otherwise catly body
4.0,Fits right shrink thin
4.0,"So I as a mom wouldn’t typically have rated them a 4 overall. The soles seem cheap and the top part legit looks like color foam (like the art foam paper) just sewed together two colors. They just look cheap but then again the price reflects that so I’m not mad at it but I personally wouldn’t buy them again. HOWEVER, although I don’t like how they look, my daughter (19 months old) is a complete shoe snob. She HATES, and I mean haaaaates wearing anything on her feet: socks, shoes, stockings whatever. She will not keep shoes on longer than 10 mins usually. But these shoes she wore for several hours without a fight so I rated them higher. I dont know if It’s because they’re lightweight, airy, or just soft and comfortable but she likes em so in my book they’re a win. They’re not a shoe that I think will last but again, I knew they were cheap from the start so I’m just happy shes not walking around like a cave baby anymore. They’re not the cutest or most durable but they do the job."
4.0,"These slippers are for my daughter. She wears a size 9 and says that these fit reasonable well, but could benefit from being a half size larger. They do make your feet look bulky and wide, but my daughter seems to like how they look and feel in general.<br /><br />They are comfortable and easy to slip on. My daughter says the memory foam insoles are comfortable but seem to squish down rather quickly and are less comfortable after a few hours.<br /><br />The nonslip bottom is very effective and allows you to step outside without fear of damage to the slippers or your feet.<br /><br />They are warm and serve their purpose."
4.0,Soft and cozy material;) Rich color;) It flares out like a maternity top so i suggest ordering a size down and it will be perfect size;)
4.0,"My husband loved this hat. He wears it alot during summer. I washed it the washing machine. Then hung dry, so far still in good shape. I may buy again in the future."
4.0,It's a beautiful top but the 2X fits me like a L.  Way too small.
4.0,"Super soft material, great construction. Ran a little large, but so comfortable. Turned right around and ordered another set. Do keep in mind it's random colors. Wound up with orange, teal, grey and black. Definitely will buy again."
4.0,Gift for my husband. Fits fine
4.0,Really cute dress. I had to go up a size because it was too tight.
4.0,Make sure to order a size or two larger. It is a beautiful shirt and very comfy.
4.0,chosen for a flower girl dress. the hem was uneven but hopefully no one else will notice.
4.0,Fits nice but it could be a little bigger but there's nothing bigger than a XXL and usually wear medium. I know it's Chinese sizes but they should make bigger sizes too considering that other people than Chinese people might want to order it too.
4.0,I like the dress and it's comfy. A bit short though as I'm 5'5&#34; and it comes above my ankle bone
4.0,Very effective.
4.0,"Ordered for my mother-in-law for a wedding. While it fit pretty well and was in the top running, we went with another dress that was more flattering. I will note that the neckline was uneven and had we chosen this dress we would have had to exchange it. For an older, overweight woman, the thick fabric was preferable."
4.0,"I purchased the same dress from another supplier and loved it. This one, however, fits larger. It is also longer and has longer sleeves. More true to size (I ordered a medium) but I prefer a tighter fit."
4.0,Good deal for the value
4.0,"I have to have any bags inspected when I go to work, and this allows me to hold up my lunch bag while they just look inside it.  I bought this because my previous mesh lunch bag (a temporary bag that I got for a marathon in 2010) was starting to come apart.  This looks like it should last at least until I no longer need it.  I do wish that there was a size in between this one and the next size up."
4.0,"Great for one very rainy day at Disneyland. Bought for three of us. One set lasted entire day but the seat of the pants ripped when taking them off, won’t be able to re-use them. Jackets held help great. We got white. See through worked so you could still see our themed wear underneath. Not very breathable, got warm and a little steamy but still worked as it was also cold outside.<br />In the future, if I need pants to last multiple long day wears, I’ll probably look for sturdier."
4.0,Love them! Worth the money!!
4.0,I love these headbands but can only wear them for a couple hours at a time because they give me a headache.
4.0,"These fit great and are very comfortable. I only gave 4 stars because they are slightly see-through if you bend over. I bought the solid gray color. Otherwise, definitely recommend and the pockets are nice."
4.0,"I love it but it's way longer than it shows. I wish it were a bit shorter. I tried drying it, but that didn't work."
4.0,"too small around the ankle; it was very difficult to get my feet into tem; however, the size is ok."
4.0,The colors on the dress are amazing. The dress fit well. I
4.0,"It was shorter than I anticipated, but that could have been my fault for not looking into the length. Good scarf, very soft."
4.0,Daughter likes them and nice shoes for the price.  Would buy again.
4.0,This top is soft and comfortable.
4.0,Some of these broke but came quickly.
4.0,"The robe itself is ok for the price but it’s super small, order a size or two up."
4.0,I ordered quite a bit of these and only had one rock chip just a tad bit. Wasn't any real problem though.<br /><br />These rocks are very pretty and you're sure to find at least one that you have a connection with.
4.0,Used it for a Minion costume. I added goggles and a mouth. Was great. I was worried about the delivery time but it arrived right on time.
4.0,These are surprisingly nice and well made for the price.
4.0,I like everything about it and switched to it immediately.  The only thing  I am concerned is that the edging may continue to get a little white around it.  I also like the fact that the bottom has little things on it so that the leather is not directly on the ground or table etc.
4.0,Very thin kinda nice
4.0,"Ordered a medium, which claimed to be my measurements, but was very form fitting. Also its a crop top."
4.0,The L dress fit really long. My daughter is 5’7” and it was touching past the ground. Cute dress otherwise
4.0,"I'm very happy with the dress. It fits me well and the quality of material and the way it was made are very good. It was delivered on the day it was promised. I like the style because it hides my problem area which is my stomach. I'm 5'3&#34; and weighs 129 lbs, small frame. The size Medium fits me well. It's about 4 in above my knees. I can wear it with boots or leggings. The only downside is if someone has big forearms, it will be tight on the sleeves. I have average size forearms and the top sleeves are a little snug but the fabric stretches a bit. I would order from this company again."
4.0,"I'm 5'4"", 140lb, 36A and the medium fits perfectly everywhere, falling above the ankle. The material is fairly heavy weight,  great for cool autumn weather. One star short due to the color being off. Rather than burgundy, it's definitely red. But not so bright a red as to be unsightly, so it will do."
4.0,"In case you're wondering, like I did, whether the inseam listed is a lie... It's not! It's a true 33.5.<br /><br />Thank you!!!<br /><br />I probably could have gone a size smaller. I got a medium and they're very comfy (and I'm six months pregnant). These can be used for maternity because the waist band can fold over, but honestly the medium comes up around my big belly just fine lol. I might need to reorder a small after I deliver, or maybe rolling it down will work at that point. I'll update then.<br /><br />I'd say buy your regular size. I normally would have bought a small but Amazon experience told me to size up, which maybe wasn't necessary.<br /><br />The material is very thin, btw, so this is a lounge pant or summer item. Very very soft too."
4.0,"I loved most of the charms but this bunch had far too many religion-oriented charms for my taste. The quality, size and amount werenice as ordered."
4.0,Great packaging with care. Fun variety of prints to choose from. The paper hook on the back easily rips. The only recommendation is to make straps smaller for kids or at least adjustable.
4.0,Could be thicker. Still very nice and quality.
4.0,Good size. Didn't like the white thread lining but fixed that issue with a red sharpie.
4.0,I wear a 44F. I didn’t expect these to fit. Nice fit in 3x
4.0,Love these earrings. ..Price was great and they look cute
4.0,People say it looks great on me.
4.0,I like that you can dress up an outfit without all the added layers! They fit nicely around the neck and keep their shape as well!
4.0,Good for the price paid.<br />Less thicker than expected May not be suitable for severe winters.
4.0,"Love it, but i usually wear a 1X, but these was a little tight. My sister who is a size smaller  loves them."
4.0,Very nice chain.  Durable.
4.0,I bought this set for my brother and I haven’t heard any complaints
4.0,These seem like they will hold up well. Runs large.
4.0,"I've been using this for a few months now.  I like how there are many pockets to store items, but a little disappointed in the durability.  Although it has a side pocket for my laptop it doesn't hold it up very well.  It leans over to the side and falls over because the bag itself isn't sturdy enough to hold the weight.  I have enough room to put a small purse in there hoping to help with that but it really didn't.  Because of this, the edges of the lining are ripping on the inside showing the foam underneath.  Overall I would recommend this product but be advised it doesn't sit up well on its own."
4.0,Couldn’t link it to my I phone<br />Sent it back to amazon
4.0,"I really like this dress. It's not the best material, but not the cheapest.  Only thing is I lost a button the second time I wore it.  Definitely reinforce the buttons.  Other than that, pretty good for $30."
4.0,"I didn’t realize that this band is not a clasp & click, it’s almost like a bracelet with a magnet for tightening/loosening. It looks good, my only complaint is that the metal links really hold water if you get it wet, so I have to be extra careful when I wash my hands or take it off after and dry it thoroughly."
4.0,"Very cute but they bend a little too easily. Awesome product for the price, though."
4.0,My first necklace was broken when I received it. Replace came quickly. I love the replacement. Thanks for replacing so quickly. Its very dainty which is perfect for my pendent.
4.0,Good for price i guess
4.0,I love all the pockets this is just what I expected!
4.0,Great product but runs a little large.
4.0,It’s ok.  Long torso and short legs.  I’m 5 ft and it goes to my ankles.  It will look nice dressed up with the right jewelry so I will keep it.
4.0,Very cute dress... but it is knit so it fits snug...glad I ordered a size up.
4.0,everything is great but the zippers on back of ankles slide up whenever i walk
4.0,"It’s for my friend, it’s her mother’s day gift.<br />I Love it. It’s beautiful golden color and is not heavy. Plenty room. Thanks for the good price."
4.0,This shirt is super comfortable.
4.0,"It looks great, and whatnot, but the glue came off on the first night, I imagine some better glue would be good for a while."
4.0,Casual ware
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter's birthday party favors. They are very bright and easy to use. There were a few dead on arrival, and they can come apart, but overall Well worth the price. Turn off the lights and have a fun mini rave at your kids' party."
4.0,I like this dress. My husband thinks it’s gorgeous on me. The seam that connects the top half to the bottom half is a little itchy and bulges a bit. Overall it’s a very pretty dress though. The top half is slightly see-through if you stretch the bust area at all (big busted ladies). I’m looking for a slip to put under for my own comfort.
4.0,This dress beat out the other 3 I bought for a fall wedding. I paired it with a petticoat and received numerous compliments on the dress! The arm holes were a little snug but otherwise for great. Was very pleased with the dress.
4.0,Very nice and the price made it all the better
4.0,"Great for the price!! Quality is great, out of the box! Check for updates later."
4.0,"pretty earring, just hurts the ear a little while you are wearing it."
4.0,"This is a great, elegant watch. If you like big and heavy watches, I'll recommend this.<br /><br />I'll only suggest to Fossil that this model could look great in a more dark chrome. The product is silver color as advertised but the picture posted in the product's page, could make you think it's not."
4.0,It's a nice shirt for what it is. Some of the characters are a bit faded and the colors don't stand out too much but it's still nice. My husband said it was just a little itchy. We ended up giving the shirt to my son because it was also just a bit small.
4.0,its a heavy gauge material and the fastening all seem sound. i'd buy it again.
4.0,They come in little girl sizes size small would fit a 4 year old size medium would fit an 8 year old size large fits likes 10-12year old but past that they are made well and very warm.
4.0,A little snug on the ankle.  But the buckle does give room for adjustment.
4.0,They where exactly what I expected! I like them a lot.
4.0,"These yoga pants are really nice.  The material is thick and stretchy.  The length on me is ankle length as I'm only 5'0 tall.  There was no weird smell when I opened them, which is always appreciated.  They are ok with tummy control but not too tight and I like that."
4.0,Great fit but gonna take some time to break in!
4.0,the color was very vibrant and looked great in pics. The width was not what I expected but I made it work.
4.0,"Watch is perfect size, I've received  compliments the first week, looks like an expensive watch, so far so good."
4.0,"It looked ok, but it was given as a gift."
4.0,Great light weight watch. I have small hands so watches tend to be bulky for me but this watch fit perfectly. Only complain is that the screen scratches easily.
4.0,Good vest. Lots of pockets. Easy to adjust. Lightweight.
4.0,Love love these fit overs. This is my 3rd pair. I get many compliments on them. Most people say they don’t notice they are fit overs until I take them off. Need to be careful to measure your glasses before ordering since the small size does not fit with my other pair of glasses.
4.0,My office is freezing not only in the winter but also in the summer. I wear these at work & am able to use my computer keyboard while keeping my hands warm.
4.0,"It fits okay. It’s a clingy material so I up sized so I wouldn’t feel so self conscious but it was too long to wear with jeans, so wear with leggings or if you’ve got nice legs, you could wear it as a dress. Perhaps if I had gotten my correct size it would have looked fine with jeans but I tended up looking sloppy like that. But it’s a very comfy dress!"
4.0,Nice quality for the price.  I am tall and they fit great - so other people's comments about them being very long are spot on.  I just happen to like very long.  :)  The ball on the hat is barely attached and fell right off.  For that I took off a star.
4.0,I wear a woman's 8.5. They fit great for that. They would not fit a men's foot over 9 because they are too tight for my boyfriend.
4.0,Very nice. Red is lighter than pictured.
4.0,It is pretty and comfortable.  Wish that length could be adjusted.
4.0,"These are great and the stay-in-place lining does its job well. My only issue is the point was for them to be no show, and these still tend to show in the corners and look a bit odd."
4.0,This box of 50 blue fiber face masks comes in 5 packages of 10 so they're easy to take-along.  They are basic and utilitarian.  The nose clip is easily adjustable.  They cover both my face and that of my adult male boys well.  They're 3 layered and will work when you have lots of in-and-out stops to make around town.
4.0,Daughter like this
4.0,I was really excited about these sweatpants because I already have a shirt that's a really close match. The print is big and vibrant and loud! They look really great. The fabric is sorta thin (for sweatpants) but comfortable. The only problem is that the fit is smaller than I expected.
4.0,Very cute - glad to share with coworkers.
4.0,We used this after my husband's open heart surgery and it was a great addition to his post surgical gear.
4.0,"Fits well, keeps you warm but rips easily."
4.0,4 stars because of missing stitching but cute enough that I kept them..
4.0,"Was great for a while. Only good for a good amount of wears the outer areas have become less sticky, && the outside looks wrinkled or cringed up.<br />See through.<br />But over all the negatives I got great use out of it😁"
4.0,"If you like your jeans tight, you might want to get a pair like this. Its 70% cotton, and 28% coolmax. I am not sure exactly what that is, but I am guessing its the material that makes these jeans stretch. The ripped areas are a nice touch and underneath each hole is a patch so its not cold and will also prevent it from ripping further. The size I got was my size and it fits as it should. Overall, I find these a nice pair of jeans that are slightly different than your classical style denim."
4.0,OK for a very low price
4.0,Love these they're bigger than expected but so comfortable & adorably shiny they came in a little box & recyclable package :)
4.0,Very cute lightweight if you want it longer or baggier size up I'm a 34 double D very short but still looks really cute
4.0,"The dress si nice, the flower that I received is smaller than I expected. I bought the dress for 5th birthday of my daughther and it fits a little tide, I suggest you to order a size up."
4.0,"I ordered two dresses and loved them. They fit perfect so I decided to order two more, same size.<br />When I received my new order I tried on the dress and it was tight, same size, same style only different color.<br />It was tight ! The arms were tight and so was the chest area. I don't like anything tight in the summer, it's too hot. I don't know if I should exchange it for a larger size. Doesn't make any sense to me."
4.0,"I would have given this 5 stars but the straps kept falling down, and would not stay up. I could not adjust the straps to make it tighter, where it did not fall off. However, this is a very cute and overall comfortable clothing item. I will purchase again, ( in a different color) because of the price, and the quality meets the price paid. :)"
4.0,"Was a gift for my daughter, and she loved"
4.0,rises up a lot and long
4.0,I like it bc it’s cotton unlike many offered.<br />It’s cute if not a little cheap looking. 😊<br />But overall happy with purchase
4.0,"so soft and pretty good material for the price!!! a little on the thinner side though, so it does make sense why it’s way cheaper than usual fuzzy robes. super soft and lightweight though :)"
4.0,"Sweater was nice, material was also soft and comfortable. Says it’s true to size if I remember correctly, but i ordered a size ten for one daughter and was very loose on the arms, seems like they run wide. Maybe order a size or two down."
4.0,I received my refund today for the 2 pair that I ordered but did not like the style. I kept the slip on style and returned the lace up ones. Thanks.
4.0,"They're more like knee highs than thigh highs. Still for the price they're a very good quality, and the material is very comfy!"
4.0,"The necklace is pretty light. It does have some extra material in the back, but you don't notice it from the front. Hopefully it won't snag my blouse."
4.0,Was a bit large when I first tried it on. I modified the back and sewed some of the fabric back into a simple buttress. Fixed the problem and immediately gave me the silhouette I was looking for.
4.0,Bottom part is good ...top is too thin
4.0,"I got these for my son and he loves them. I took off one star because the lining and exterior get wadded together when trying to put them on sometimes, requiring lots of finger wiggling."
4.0,"I loved this dress, the colour was beautiful, and it wasn't so much that it was too small, but I have a long torso, so the waist hit me in the wrong spot"
4.0,"Well the clock is very pretty, the picture depicts a silver rim around the mosaic tiles. The clock I received has gold rims around the tiles and the tiles are not the blue colors that you see in the picture they are very light brown beige White not at all blue at all. I was also expecting it to be a larger clock and because of the rim of the Mosaic shells the face of the clock is much smaller which I should have prepared for from the beginning so that's my fault. Other than that the clock is beautiful it just doesn't match the room that I bought it for."
4.0,my kid had one but grew out of it. got the bigger size and fits fine. this is a house slipper so no actual arch support.
4.0,"I ordered this in the Floral Mint size medium.  I'm a size 10 in jeans, usually a medium to large in tops & this fit like a charm.  Unfortunately, after the first wash it was unwearable because the inner liner is white which makes the dress appear to be really faded. I washed on cold & hung to dry, but it still happened. I'd recommend sticking with the solids on this. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a good quality dress & I'd even buy it again just not in a color that has a white liner."
4.0,Runs a lil short...k
4.0,The dress was a little to long in the front and had to be altered ($75) but other than that my daughter loves it!!
4.0,It rattles quite a bit and feels like plastic but looks fine for the price
4.0,"These shipped really fast so that was cool.  I thought they were cute, but they didn't fit exactly right for me personally.  I ended up giving them away but they look great with the dresses my friends put them with.  The only thing I didn't love was the single use plastic they come in.  Seems super unnecessary to put them in the little wrap they come in."
4.0,"Excellent quality for the price. Seems to be well-constructed with a strong busk. Reinforced waist tape. Comes laced, but I had to re-knot the ribbon because it pulled through. Order a couple sizes smaller than you think you need -- you can always relax the laces. The color is vivid and it's very pretty."
4.0,My Lady was very disappointed 😔 the bag was exactly what she wanted but the craftsmanship was not..bag handle came loose just after the return date expired
4.0,"I’m 5’4” and these are too long for me. They’re good quality and comfortable, just fit odd because of length."
4.0,I really like these thigh high socks however being a plus size my self the top thigh bands are really tight fitting. I would expect so that they stay in place but it makes them a bit uncomfortable. Regardless however they look nice and I enjoy having them.
4.0,"My husband wears them to take the dogs in and out. Good traction, warm, average slipper."
4.0,"They were exactly what I expected for the price and did their job.  If you are looking for quality sunglasses that you can see through well, these are not for you.  They are cheap plastic lenses so they aren't clear when looking through them."
4.0,"Great, basic dress! Easy to dress up/down. Arrived quite dirty, but I washed it (and air dried) and was fine. No shrinkage as I air dried."
4.0,"This blouse is beautiful! It is exactly like the picture. I rated it down a star because a medium sized hole was in the side stitching; although, it was an easy fix. Other than the hole, the blouse is great."
4.0,"I bought the black bag. I like that it top closes with a zipper. My only issue is that it lacks an outside pocket. Other than that, the bag is fine and useable. You can definitely tell that the material quality is not very high.  I was given this product at a discounted price to review, I only review products I have used, know, like and trust."
4.0,"Fit ,but not very flattering,and the material was awful."
4.0,"Nice bags, not too big. They are not stretchy at all which I was expecting and the holes are rather big. Smaller items might fall out."
4.0,"This is a nice skirt. It is a good shape, and it sits well on my measurements (47-46-52)"
4.0,Very cute earrings my only complaint is they are bigger than the matching nacklace and a slightly darker green.
4.0,"The color was exactly what I expected. I loved the top but the sleeves were a bit tight and the style was not the best cut for me. If it were a different cut, I would defintly keep it."
4.0,The blouse fits great goes well with the skirt😊
4.0,Chain too long
4.0,The shirt has good quality but it's too big for my daughter who wears a S (we did order a S).
4.0,The quality is good the only thing is that they run short . I don't think a little girl needs to be running around with her tummy hanging out
4.0,It's beautiful! Only issue is it can be a bit annoying to close at times but not that big of a deal. Buy it!
4.0,I was going for the pink gold as in the image :( but the necklace is gorgeous!
4.0,Nice product. Tight around the arms making it difficult to lift your arms.
4.0,nice addition to my aircraft key chain.
4.0,Tight around the leg but a good fit around the waist.
4.0,My son really liked this socks.  He like the way it fits
4.0,ONE NEEDS TO GET A COMPRESSION SHIRT TO MATCH THIS WILL LKEEP IT FROM ROLLING OWN.
4.0,get what you see
4.0,Bought this my boyfriend. It's slim fit and looked great!
4.0,I love these undies! They are truly no VPL even under yoga pants and they don't ride up while exercising. I love the thickness and elasticity of the fabric and also the shape of the panties. Not too low in the front like others are. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I'd really love them to come in actual sizes. These come in OSFA - which means one size fits athletic types. My body has changed a bit from the athletic type so they could be a tiny bit larger for a perfect fit. But these are by far the best no VPL panties I've found yet and I've tried several. I now have 3 pairs of these and want a pair for each day of the week.
4.0,Then wig is a bit weird. It is not a mohawk but more.like a full spikey wig...we just put some hairspray in it to shape it abit...Other than that it's great.
4.0,Was exactly what we wanted came in a nice box to wrap for a present loved it was a great  gift idea
4.0,No squad approved
4.0,These are shinny and seem to be good quality so far. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the little part that hold the earrings in place (not sure of the name) comes off really easy. I usually sleep with my earrings on but I realized I couldn't do that with these because I would lose them.
4.0,I was worried as I have a smaller head but this hat is perfect.  Nice and snug.
4.0,"My only complaint, I wish it was packaged in a box with paper stuffed in it instead of flattered in plastic. Having a tough time stretching it out and getting it to hold. Not built for my face. Mostly got it to use in a photoshoot with models."
4.0,Very comfortable but a little on the small side. I wear a 9 in every shoe and that’s what I ordered. Very comfortable and cushioned in the inside but just slightly smaller than a normal size 9
4.0,"Don't get me wrong, it's cute, it's comfortable, but for $10 it's definitely not a bad deal, but I think there are better options available on Amazon. My wrist is 6 inches in circumference and this was too big for me. If you have a seam ripper and are steady with a needle and thread it's easy to fix. I did so easily and it's holding up well (the side I stitched together shown above.) Just purchased it, so I'm not sure how well it will hold up over time.<br /><br />Pros: Cute pattern, slim fabric design that stays in place, it's very cute and comfortable to wear.<br />Cons: Size isn't easily adjustable. It was big for me, though might be too small for some folks."
4.0,"Nice watch, especially for the price. Keeping very accurate time in both modes.  Slightly heavy but comfortable."
4.0,I ordered several pair of Aviators and this was the only one I really liked a lot. The frame and fit was as expected. I've had several people ask where I got them. My answer as always: &#34;Amazon.com Baby!&#34; Love my Amazon Prime. :-)
4.0,"I absolutely love this ring. It’s beautiful. I bought it to commemorate our beagle that had to be put down recently at age 11. I didn’t buy the ring for the engraving, and I did see reviews prior to purchasing that said it was misspelled. I was showing my family and we all think it’s hilarious. The ring says “aways in my heat”. I don’t regret buying this ring, but if they’re going to bother put an engraving in it, the least they can do is make sure it’s spelled correctly."
4.0,The tie can be a bit difficult to do by yourself but for the price it is worth it. Not something for a man because it's small I bought it for my wife who loves it.
4.0,"Loved this dress! Unfortunately with my athletic build my shoulders were a bit too broad.  Could have deff kept and been fine but I found another that fit better so will be returning.  As mentioned in other reviews, this is a heavier dress with a thicker underlay however the material is great.  Overall very happy, wish I could keep everything I ordered!"
4.0,I purchased the white sweater and found it to be soft and warm. It fit as expected and was a nice length. My only complaint is there is a hole in the pocket after wearing it for a few months.
4.0,"I really like this jacket! I ordered a large even though I fit medium and it fits me very comfortably with extra space as I intended. My previous jacket I wore while pregnant and I'm hoping much the same this time too.<br />I was expecting the red to be a little darker but I don't mind it at all. The hood has button clasps that I love so much. It helps the hood stay up and I don't struggle to hold it when it's windy.<br />The length alone is my favorite thing because I am a tall woman at 5' 9"" with a long torso and legs and it goes to mid thigh. The sleeves could be a smidge longer but I can't complain. I'm all for the extra added material at the sleeves which extended it enough so my wrists don't poke out because of my long arms. The thumb holes to cut into my hands but again that's because I've got long arms. Overall great buy!"
4.0,I get compliments on it all the time.
4.0,For the price it's not bad but I wish it was tighter quality is good
4.0,"Soft material, fits as expected."
4.0,"I purchased this to replace an underwire strapless bra.  The previous one made the ladies look perky but kept sliding down, especially when it was hot.  I've tried a few others and they either poked into my armpit, didn't give any support, or smashed down my chest in an unsightly manner.  I've worn this new one twice now.  Isn't scratchy, doesn't smash my chest flat, and STAYS UP.  It also came with clear detachable straps AND a bra hook extender.  It has removable pads but doesn't have an uncomfortable underwire.  For reference I am a 36B.  I don't think it would be a suitable bra for large breasted ladies."
4.0,They're a pain in the neck to get closed because the bar that goes through the piercing wobbles in its hinge. But they're cute
4.0,"I like these glasses, but I feel like I got a defect or something, just because it barely has any type of pattern going on compared to the one I have seen at the store or even in their own picture.<br />Picture I added is me trying to hold it up to the light which shows not much of a pattern going on."
4.0,"This top is cute and unique, but the material is not very stretchy, and it seems to be a little scratchy."
4.0,"I bought these for me, but they were so small my C-cup granddaughter can wear them.  I will not buy them for myself, but will buy them for my mom (b-cup) and my granddaughter.  Granddaughter says they are super comfy.  She loved the padding and front closure."
4.0,I use mine as a head wrap...works great. The material is thin and stretchy.
4.0,"Product as described and good.  Only minor thing is they are a bit too stiff, otherwise good."
4.0,It very flattering
4.0,Fit was good and so was quality
4.0,It is OK but the blue lose the color when washed.  I recommend to add some white vinegar to the water.
4.0,"Arrived with a split seam on one pair. The other 4 have been great, very soft and durable through multiple washes."
4.0,"It’s comfortable and made alright. Not the cheapest material but not the softest. The shirt is true to size. I guess I was just expecting more for the price, which I found to be the only problem. It’s just a little pricey for a regular T-shirt."
4.0,"I absolutely love this top - the design and  the fabric are just gorgeous. The problem I had was the bodice area is way too tight. Even though it's mostly covered up by the ruffle, it would be uncomfortable for me to wear it. If the fabric had some stretch to it, that would solve the problem. I have been a fashion designer for many years and know that it is so much easier to fit many different shapes of people, just by adding stretch to the fabric. So the top will be selling to small chested women and fitting perfectly, but me, being a 36DD, it couldn't work. I'm sure a Company wants to sell as many tops as possible, so an easy fix is to always have some stretch in their fabrics!"
4.0,Product is pretty. There are two different levels for hanging depth but still they were too long so you saw the prongs on the back. If your ear holes are higher these will work well for you.
4.0,The plastic between the toe is a little stiff and irritates my toe but as time goes on getting use to it<br />Other than that there good! I just use them to shower in at work.
4.0,These boots look great but they stink
4.0,It was cute but ran a little large I thought
4.0,It fits a little tight in the bust compared to other dresses the same size
4.0,"Nice,  soft tee shirt. Fits true to size."
4.0,Not as much stretch as I would have hoped for but my teen son is a Mario fanatic and likes the socks.
4.0,"Not quite as water resistant as I had hoped, so I bought a waterproof phone case and wrap my sensitive items in zip loc bags. But I carried it with me all summer, dragging it into my raft and to work. It does fit a SurfacePro in the center, but just barely."
4.0,"Perfect for the car. Good size, but a little on the small size. Metal seems a little thin but over its a decent umbrella"
4.0,"Like it, well made but the elastic waste in the front looks a little unfinished without the proper belt.  Color is nice."
4.0,"Clips are not as large as preferred, and do not grip as tightly as some others do.  Fairly good value for price, however"
4.0,"Would definitely purchase again love the quality.. I feel like the price is somewhat fair but for 25 bucks just be careful for sizing. I bought for my six-year-old son and it fits like a dress. I purchase an extra small. please note my son absolutely loves it he just won't be able to wear it in public. For reference I'm 5'1, 120 lbs and the XS fits me. Definitely not child sizes as advertised. Including a pic."
4.0,"I ordered this necklace because I felt like I need some &#34;bear energy.&#34;  I did not end up wearing it as often as I thought I would because it looked... I don't know... not as elegant as I would have liked.  I'm not sure how to explain it, it looked like it did in the picture, and there was nothing wrong with it.  I just ended up not liking it was much as I thought I would."
4.0,It's very nice looking and light weight. But it has been leaving some gray residue around my wrist.
4.0,I've been watching Amazon waiting on some halloween masks. These popped up and I ordered right away. They came next day and I tossed in washer and dryer. They held up great after being washed. I tried them on and I have a narrow face so I tucked up the sides and sewed them down. Ended with a PERFECT fit. Love that they came with ear adjusters as well. Halloween is my favorite time so I am very excited to wear!
4.0,"You get what you pay for. I like the style, the quality is what you'd expect at this price point. But a good looking Tom Ford knockoff"
4.0,My son loves his hearings
4.0,Well made and fits as expected !
4.0,I really like these shoes! I ordered the gray leopard prints ones. I listened to the other reviews saying to order half a size up which I regret doing because my regular size would have fit perfect.
4.0,I can't wear them because I accidentally ordered the wrong size.. but they look super comfy. My daughter tried them on but she didn't love how they made her booty look. So I guess well be giving them away.
4.0,For the price it was good
4.0,Wire was poking through a couple of them but overall they worked great
4.0,"I haven't worn these outside yet (I'll update the review once I do), but they are comfortable and fit well.  I'm normally a size S (24 in waist, 36 in hips), and I ordered the XL based on other reviews.  I probably should have gotten the L.  These were easy to get on, unlike other compression pants.  They are quite short, well above the ankle on me.  I'm 5'5&#34;.  I can't wait to try them out."
4.0,"Everyone loves this dress, the material isn't thin. It fit very well. Shows my curves"
4.0,pretty but was cute large in the chest my daughter could not wear
4.0,Its an $8 fake gold grill set.  You know what you are signing up for
4.0,My daughter loves these slippers.
4.0,"it looks cheap, but it is, any ways it looks nice with any clothes, iget it very quickly.. like it"
4.0,"These look gorgeous! The metal posts are super cheap and arrived a little bent, but the earrings look really good. :)"
4.0,"The nose piece was a little bent on one side, but it wasn't terrible. An easy fix. Great dim shading for bright environments. Might be a little too dark for some people wanting to see well, but have a little protection. Me? I like it dark. So these are perfect. The arms feel like they're potentially easy to break, as they're made of plastic, but it's worth the risk for the price and the added cool factor they seem to give.<br /><br />Comes with a nice little pouch to stick them inside if you like, but no box. You'll have to get that separately if you want."
4.0,Great looking ties.
4.0,This came in a bag. When I pulled it out I thought was adorable. There is just so much detail in the swimming suit. Specially in the front. With all the lace. It is all so cute because it has a little built-in skirt. This way it covers more than most bathing suits with stress makes it even better. Then you turn around and it is tight across the back. So you see the whole back which makes it kind of sexy. The only thing is the size. I asked for an extra large and I swear I got an extra small. If you look at the chart it says an XL is a large. However it was more like a medium or small. It was very small and did not stretch. I'm hoping my much give me your sister will like it because it will not fit me. I'm kind of disappointed but that's what I get for not trying it on first. I did get this item for a very low cost to write an honest and unbiased review.
4.0,The design and quality are too cute but the only flaws are it runs abit small purchased a 5t/6t and it fits like a 3t/4tbut then again I kind of have a large toddler and the straps were too long which was kind of odd considering the proportions of the top.. just tied them and called it a day..other than that it doubled as a cute swim suit!
4.0,Super happy with the quality of this ring. Sizing is spot on as well!
4.0,"Arrived in less than 48 hours. Works great, so far!<br />Needless to say, considerably less expensive than LEXUS.<br />4 out of 5 key-makers cannot cut this key, so look for a ""LASER"" cutter.<br />Only thing missing is the Lexus emblem, but TOTALLY worth it."
4.0,I love this shirt! Many compliments while I wore it on vacation. I just felt it was a bit snug for a large.
4.0,"I've been carrying this bag everyday, since I purchased it back in May, 2016. It's a great looking bag and carries well. There was an issue with the strap coming loose as well as the inside change pocket not being securely sewed, however I've since made the fixes needed to continue use of the bag. I'm currently eyeing the darker gray version for purchase, too. If you're looking to make this purchase, I believe you'll like this bag, if you decide to give it a try. That is to say, for amount paid, I cannot complain. Thanks!"
4.0,"This belt is nothing to write home about but works well for me as a simple, tan belt. The price is excellent and it looks just fine. It does, as many others have mentioned, smell pretty bad right out of the package - this is not the case for this brand's other belts, so I'm not sure what went wrong here. I left it outside overnight after spraying it with some &#34;body mist,&#34; though, and it made it smell fine enough to wear."
4.0,It was a bit too itchy.  I find the Minus33 to be much less itchy.
4.0,"Love these, have them in a couple colors. Polarized makes a world of difference!"
4.0,These necklaces are very nice.
4.0,I liked it has pockets. It would be better if there was a tie at the waist like other skirts from the same brand. That may only be personal style preference though.
4.0,Bought for granddaughter and she loved it
4.0,The problem is me.  It makes me feel prettier than I am.
4.0,"My scarf measures  62&#34; x 16&#34;, not 65&#34; x 17&#34; as stated in the description.  The colors are brighter and more electric pink than shown on my monitor.  The material feels nice and soft.  If you crumple the material in your hand, it will hold every crease."
4.0,just a little small...beautiful!...oh and pretty long!
4.0,These are super cute and comfortable but I think they run a bit small. I wear a size 8 and they are just too tight for my liking.
4.0,"Looks great and it's definitely fitted.  If you want some wiggle room, go a size up."
4.0,I think these are original but older model Vuarnets.  Each lens has the Ski V etched into the glass so if they are fakes they are very good ones.  The box it came in was totally crushed but if you look at the cost of these compared with the Legend 06 ($240) and these which to me look identical you're paying less than half the price.
4.0,The cross is a bit smaller than the picture shows but it's pretty much what you see.. Shirt runs a bit small as well...
4.0,"See above.  I like the fit and style of this jacket-sweater.  One thing that caused temporary anxiety:  I ordered a medium, as last time.  This item was labeled small, but when I put it on, it is exactly the same size as the earlier maroon garment, which was correctly labeled medium."
4.0,"Very nice, unfortunately it was too big and they were sold out of the medium"
4.0,"they were somewhat small, meaning they were a little narrow. Usually this width fits well. But I feel I have worn them and shouldn't return them now. Will try to get them stretched out."
4.0,"Fits a little big, but decent quality and cute for the price."
4.0,"Loved the top of this one piece, but the waist  line made me look like I had wide hips and would be best on someone with curves (not straight type figure)"
4.0,Loses a star because it say Kylo Ren vs Star Wars but I actually love it. The price is killer
4.0,"Love this two piece suit, especially the built in bra.<br />I will say that they show it being worn as a short dress. Not sure how they did that for the picture.<br />I'm 5' 4"" 128lbs and narrow as in no hips.<br />This absolutely did not come down to below my hips.<br />Still worth it. Dries fast, super comfortable. Great bottoms! Not super high waisted."
4.0,"I have bought a few economy mat bags from amazon. You have to settle in some respects, unless you want to pay $100-$250 for a very professional version.<br />This bag is great because it has a nice sturdy zipper, so it’s more appropriate for air travel than one that has flaps and Velcro. Keep in mind, the material will eventually wear thin from being dragged around by baggage handlers. The more you Travel, the faster it will wear. If you don’t travel much, and never drag it, it will likely last much longer. Traveling on a monthly basis, 4 flights a month, it lasted about 6 months before I could start to see through some parts of the fabric.<br />This is typical of the durability of a mat bag in this price range. If you want better, spend more.<br />The only feature I disliked about this bag was the lack of a shoulder strap. The bag is huge and weighs about twenty pounds when full of foam tiles. If you aren’t a particularly tall person, this will throw you off balance, and be a pain in the butt (esp if you are walking through an airport). I have used luggage straps and thrown the handles over my suitcase, which warped the handle (because it’s just heavy enough). So, if you are just moving this in and out of a vehicle or building, it’s probably worth it to save the money. If you are going to be lugging it or traveling with it, you might need to just go for the more expensive and durable model with all the features."
4.0,The glass are very nice. However they are huge but they are fashionable. I'm so ready to rock these.
4.0,Muy lindos.
4.0,Bought this as a gift for a 35 year old that lost sight coming after complications of childbirth. She was not able see a huge wall clock in the other side of the room. Very easy to learn to use and not too loud in a home setting. I haven't visited again after giving this watch so I can't attest to durability.
4.0,"I have purchased several fashion pieces from Mordenmiss this year. This blue sweater was probably the most expensive out of all of those items. Is it worth the price? I would have to say yes, but that is because it is more of a sweater coat than an actual sweater. I was expecting a roomy cardigan that could be worn around the house or at an office. This piece - which is well made - is something that one would wear outside. For someone looking for a light sweater, this isn't it. For someone wanting a stylish, attractive, welll-tailored sweater coat, this fits that description. I am 5'6&#34; and the length was very good; it hits about the knees. The sleeves were perfect on me. I love the color tone of the blue. Although the buttons look red in the photo, they are actually a shiny faux wood; they do not distract from the garment. The material is a blend of cotton and some synthetic fibers; this too is acceptable. The sweater is very, very soft. I love the deep pockets; they make the outfit pretty perfect! So, yes, this piece is pricier than many Mordenmiss offerings, but one gets a coat as opposed to a cardigan, so I guess that is okay."
4.0,"I like this cover well enough. Seems sturdy. The edges around the reader itself could be a little narrower, they interfere with my fingers touching the edge of the screen. Otherwise happy with it."
4.0,"The thing I like the most is the actual bracelet is great quality, what I least like about it is the packaging that it comes in. It makes it seem very cheap"
4.0,I love it! It’s nice and heavy and feels very sturdy. I did expect the chord to be longer but I still love it. I wouldn’t recommend wearing it much because the braiding is a little loose around the chord and the black threading is also a little loose too but I still love it ❤️
4.0,Me llego y es lindo
4.0,"This is my second pair.  Be sure to put a little grease on the screws during clip installation, so you won't strip out the screws.  Take care of them, and they will last a long time.  Delivered in one day."
4.0,I like the fact that I don't have to unbuckle in order to loosen my belt.
4.0,"Picture is a MUCH darker red than received. Is more of a bright red, was lucky I wore it for Christmas because the color is a little much. Maybe for a Where’s Waldo or Cat in the Hat look. But the fit is great 👍"
4.0,No see through issues here.  Fit as expected and even provides a slimming.
4.0,Shipped very quickly and they are all so cute I’m so excited to mix and match as I have 2 tragus piercings the only issue was the red/pink one wasn’t fully painted kinda bummed as that and the white one were my sole reason for buying the set but The others are cute as well I added 2 photos one with flash one without
4.0,"With these Dyad 9 shoes I am able to easily run even if I am tired. And my knee pain is gone. The shoe has the perfect firmness and cushion needed to get you a good run without being too soft and too hard. Definitely worth the $65 I paid. The new model of this shoe Dyad 10 was fitting little better on the sides, but it costs double. I was told Dyad 9 and Dyad 10 has the same fit but only the design is different. That's not completely true. There are subtle upgrades. Nevertheless, this Dyad 9 serves my purpose for pavement and blacktop running easily. I am happy with it."
4.0,"I really love this necklace, its totally trendy! My only complaint as to why I did not rate it 5 stars is that the gecko seemed a bit tarnished. The necklace itself was nice and shiny, but the lizard part look a bit yellowish. I tried using sterling silver cleaner on it, it helped a bit."
4.0,"Product fit as anticipated and wear is as expected, after numerous washings."
4.0,"The bracelet was going to be a gift for a friend, but it turned out to be a bit thicker and heavier than I thought. It comes with a gift box and hair ties , nicely made and it’s not too difficult to open and close. It is nice but just isn’t what I was looking for."
4.0,"Love this top, it's a spandex type of stretchy material, I'm 5'8 175lbs bought a large..fit like the pics accept not long enough to wear as a dress in the back...it almost doesn't cover my butt and if I tie in the front, it goes way above my crotch but def a sexy shirt, I'm ordering the blk one in med to have a nice sexy more firm fitting top:)"
4.0,Over all pleased sleeve length is good shirt is a lil shorter than expected
4.0,"They look great, but the spots were kinda misplaced. Just keep the people looking at them at a distance"
4.0,It’s a little bit longer than I anticipated
4.0,"This dress is comfortable and the fabric feels nice. If I were to order it again, I would purchase a small (versus medium) as the fit is a bit loose even with the drawstring. For reference, I'm 5'5"" ~145pounds very athletic (lifting/running)/pear shaped."
4.0,"It is really nice and the colors are nice. Colors may be just a little off from picture but still nice. I'm small, so will fit perfectly size small. Also the sleeves are a little longer than 3/4, but not exactly full length as shown in pic. 5'3.75&#34; and 124lbs."
4.0,"More pros than cons. I ordered 4 pairs of these and I'm glad I did! Theyre buttery soft, extremely comfortable, and the price is amazing for the quality. I ordered them all in a Large. They were all sewn really well, the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is, 1, they sent me 1 wrong color, and 2, the fit is inconsistent.<br /><br />I ordered the black camo which fit exactly how I had hoped but was black and purple? Didn't match the picture but theyre still cute. They sent me a white heather grey when I ordered the dark heather grey and they fit more like comfy sweats, not fitted joggers like I'd hoped. I got a charcoal color that looks more purple, it fits looser than the camo but way tighter than the light grey. And I got an olive green that fits looser than the camo and charcoal but tighter than the light grey. I wish they all fit like the camo since I ordered them all in the same size. Im keeping them though because like I said in the beginning theyre butter on my body lol and awesome quality. I guess I'll just have to order more lol"
4.0,"Beautiful watch that matches many of the reviews here, a bit of understated class. The real win is the accuracy. I am tracking the accuracy after five days against my absolutely accurate Atomic Citizen and it is within three seconds of coordinated universal time. Apparently, the reputation of the Seagull 2542 for accuracy is well warranted. Recommended for value!"
4.0,I like these BJJ Gi's. I bought one for myself amd my son. Seeing that he is only 9 and the cost of Gi's are expensive he grew out of his gi over the summer and I replaced it asap.<br /><br />They are durable and colorful
4.0,It looks like it does in the picture but the material feels kind of thin and the zipper seems like it might break. So far so good but i will update further if needed.
4.0,"Super super cute, seems well-made so far. However, can't seem to keep my ladies in place. Could be my wearing it too loose but otherwise great product for the price."
4.0,The looks and good quality
4.0,These are nice ..however over time the designs wear off..I like them but not sure I’d order them again ..
4.0,"Looked great on the night of the event, but jewels fell out of their sockets by the end of the evening but it's a costume piece and it served it's purpose."
4.0,The color of the padlock in the photo is misleading because it isn't a matte black. It's more of a shiny gunmetal dark grey. So far everything seems good quality I like it except for the padlock color though some may like that shiny grey.
4.0,"These are adorable! My only complaint is that while the fit is great, they push into my daughters toes just a bit making them a bit red when worn for a while (like if we go to the park). I think that maybe the top of the sandal just pushes down a little too much, but other than that they're perfect. I'll probably buy the next size up so her toes have a little more wiggle room."
4.0,does the job very well
4.0,"Just what I wanted.  I am tired of wearing leggings, and they are hot and clingy for Summer weather.<br />This is nice fabric, feels cool and comfy.  Go anywhere in them ... grocery shop, out to lunch, cocktail<br />hour, dinner at 8.  Any shoe will do, just not athletic shoes, although I could picture these pants with<br />black Converse All-Stars for an out-there, funky look.  All this and priced to please!"
4.0,"Hi,  This was returned, because size of bags were too small.  I  wanted the larger ones that I had ordered before.<br />I returned to Kohl's right before they closed due to Pandemic.  I never received a credit for this.  Thank you.<br />A. Borgognone"
4.0,"Boyfriend loved it , seems cheaply made tho but for the price what do you expect"
4.0,Not as pink as the picture but lovely nonetheless.
4.0,It fits well. Heavy material which I like. Overall good dress.
4.0,"Shirt looks and fits as expected with one exception.  The back is plain white.  Disappointing!  In terms of sizing,  I ordered a XXL when I typically wear an L.  Fits like a large."
4.0,"Is nice, good to go out; and is just different"
4.0,Love the spring pattern!
4.0,Good retro look
4.0,Arrived 2 days late but otherwise was as listed.
4.0,Did not realize that the dress was see thru
4.0,These work and I do breath easier but the silicone wasn’t the most comfortable this winter even with using a paper barrier. Using them this summer is going to be challenging but I’m going to try and make it happen. I’m hopi g someone comes out with a paper version.
4.0,Lots of compliments- very affordable. Pay attention to the size recommendations and order appropriately!
4.0,"My husband has a huge neck and these have been awesome in extending the collar  of his button-ups so he can wear a tie with them. I only gave 4 stars becusae sometimes the extenders snap and break and we probably only have 5 of the 10 left. Overall, though this product has helped to save us money by not having to buy new shirts."
4.0,Was a little smaller in the chest area than expected. Overall great buy.
4.0,"I’m 5’9” and 135 lbs. I have an athletic build, and I’m normally a size small, but I gravitate to a medium when it’s close fitting around the hips since I’m a little bottom-heavy.<br /><br />I purchased a medium, and I’m glad I did. The dress doesn’t hug my curves, but I didn’t want it to be tight. The hemline hits right above my knee, and the neckline is a flattering boat neck. The material is quite soft. The dress itself is so comfortable, I plan on purchasing it in every color.<br /><br />I deducted a star because in some light, the fabric is a bit see through. For most, this won’t be an issue, but a simple slip can fix this problem. I still love the dress and plan on buying it in every color."
4.0,"I truly like using this equipment, I have problems with my knees and back. Using this helps me walk upright and keeps the pressure off my knees"
4.0,"Every dress I've purchased from this company fits great. I'm 5'3"" 360 lbs so its hard to find dresses that are cute and flattering. My only issue is that it doesn't come up high enough in the back to cover the fat rolls in my bra area unless you continue to pull it up."
4.0,"It is okay, thought would be longer and a little bigger."
4.0,Bracelet is nice. Would have preferred shorter wrist adjustments.
4.0,Closest I could find to Seamus Mcfly's hat!  Ran a little big for my male friend in the med/large size.
4.0,I think my grandson will love it.
4.0,It's a good coat that's about it
4.0,"I’m a size small and I got the size that I usually wear but it was very baggy and I noticed the straps were loose and falling off a lot. I got it to wear on the beach during our honeymoon, so it didn’t bother me too much it still looked pretty. Just wish I knew how baggy it was going to be. It’s also something easily fixed with a belt or safety pin. Still great quality."
4.0,Like it a lot. It’s for that day that is a bit chilly.
4.0,I guess i have to lose extra weight to make this look good or just order another one in a bigger size
4.0,Smaller than I expected.  I use it for work. We sent have bags that are not vle as r in the pharmacy.  Over all it works.  I wish the straps were longer to go over my shoulder.
4.0,Item is true to color and fits well.  I didn't like how it is hard to keep it from opening up when wearing.  I am still trying to figure out how to keep it secure.
4.0,It was cute but it’s run a size smaller
4.0,Good boxers
4.0,"Very nice quality,  don't feel it's large enough for multiple people, but super nice, hard to get back into the pouch too. But doesn anyone actually really keep those and use them? 🤷‍♀️"
4.0,"When I originally received this bag, a section of the back was not assembled properly so it was all one giant pocket. Not useful at all. I emailed the company and they not only refunded my money but sent me another, properly sewn, bag immediately.<br /><br />I have to admit, I've made a few adjustments to the bag to make it sturdier. I sewed the strap at the top where the hook is attached to the sturdier outer fabric (it only comes sewn to the very thin inner fabric), which improved the strength quite a bit. I have to say, it's not the sturdiest bag I've had, but it's not that bad. I use it almost every day and it holds everything I need."
4.0,The wig is very shiny be warned of that. Other than that its a good quality wig
4.0,Very well made. Great colours! I would purchase again.
4.0,I was very excited to receive this shirt. I will say it is very cozy and warm. It looks very masculine though. It is not flattering for a female.
4.0,Kind of runs small and not very comfy. I got a medium and needed a large and I’m a small woman. It looks pretty but I feel the quality should be higher for the price. Good for Halloween
4.0,I like this top but I bought it a little large as I read reviews as to it running on the small side.  It is still a very cute<br />top and I just wear a camisole underneath to compensate for the looser lower cut fit.  I gave it 4 stars only because it was a<br />bit larger than I was expecting but other than that I'm not disappointed that I bought it.
4.0,You need to wash first to get the color
4.0,Very different from other checkbook covers!
4.0,"I have purchased several different Momo shoes for both a boy and a girl.  They wear well, easy to slip on, and the toddlers seem to like wearing them."
4.0,I wear an XS/S and the small fits me very well.  Loose but just right.  It’s very comfortable and not itchy.  It is a little bit see-through so I wear a shirt under it.  I ordered this in the light pink color but upon receipt it’s more of a light coral color.  I was disappointed that it’s not pink but since the coral is still pretty I kept it.
4.0,"Super comfy, not too tight or loose."
4.0,Love the earrings!! The backs should be a little bit bigger...
4.0,This was thicker than I expected. The shirt is tailored to fit very nicely.
4.0,Wish it were a bit larger!
4.0,Nice but not classy.
4.0,"Dress fit well, the style of the dress is exactly what you see but the material of the dress is what throw me."
4.0,"Had to reorder twice because the sizes run small. I’m 5’3 and about 155 lbs. I’m a size medium but I like jackets big enough to layer underneath and a more casual and comfortable look, not too fitted. I went with a medium because the reviews said the sizes run big (not true) I exchanged it for a LARGE and it was just slightly bigger than a MEDIUM, it was still quite fitted, so I went with an X-Large, this size was perfect and comfortable, not too fitted and not too big. Size up if you can unless you like tight fitted jackets."
4.0,Pretty accessory but the size toggle kept slipping to enlarge causing movement & falling off. Purchase at your own risk
4.0,Very cute! runs true to size.
4.0,I bought this for my wife who loves camisoles. I bought Xl but was way to small for my wife. Once out of the package we could see that it was for a woman with small Breast. No hassle with the return
4.0,Loved this dress! Recieved tons of compliments the night I wore it!!
4.0,My daughter love it.. it was for me. I Will order a large the next time. Lol
4.0,"Great little jacket! Bought for my son to be Indiana Jones for Halloween, and it’s perfect. Fits true to size and is pretty nice quality! Not sure how much he will wear it but spot on for what we needed it for."
4.0,Took forever to get and had a horrible chemical smell I couldn’t get out for a few months but now that I have it and the smell is gone I really like it. Heavyier weight with a nice lining inside that’s warm.
4.0,"Beautiful ring,  fun to match with my clothing!"
4.0,Nice bag but huge disappointment! I was going to give this as gift but it did not come with a dust bag!! I have to give one of my own.  The bag is really nice and arrived right on time.
4.0,"I don't know quite how to rate these socks. They fit well, but I didn't get them for me. I expected my husband to wear them. However, they are small for a 9-11 size that can fit men or women. I wear a women's 8 and they are right on me. I like the tab heel to keep the shoes from rubbing on my Achilles. They are bright! They do show above my shoes.<br /><br />I like that they are cushioned and comfortable, nice and thick.<br /><br />Overall, I like the fit and comfort a lot, but would only give 5 stars if the fit was right for the size they are labeled for."
4.0,Silky soft but not breathable. Looks nice on but uncomfortable on a hot day. Will be saving for cooler weather.
4.0,👏very sexy. Difficult to figure out at first. But once I got it I was pleased.
4.0,Not the greatest support but very comfortable and because it's stretchy it's easier than many sports bras to put on and take off.
4.0,"This really is a decent bag.<br />I bought the tan color to use as a work bag (folders, pad folio, thermos, lunch). It fit the bill perfectly and has many pockets for organization, which is terrific (outside flap, deep back zip, deep inside zip and 2 inside open wall pockets). I also bought the tan color because it is lined in tan, which of course makes it easier to see what's swimming in the depths.<br />I did return it, though for 2 reasons:<br />1. I am a serious Dooney and Bourke fan and when you're used to Dooney leather its difficult to accept something that's not<br />2. One of my existing Dooneys (that I forgot about) works really well as a work bag 😘<br />Were it not for the second reason I'm sure I would have kept this little gem!"
4.0,Beautiful little wallet for your cards and fits in my small swing bag
4.0,"They are cool tshirts for a toddler to wear they are not very thick ,to be worn on a hot day out."
4.0,"These were EXACTLY what I was looking for, lightweight, comfortable and ADORABLE!!! I am 5’9 with an athletic frame, and they fit just loose enough to where I don’t feel like I am swimming in 6 yards of fabric. Very pleased, I have also purchased in black and brown and love them all just the same, very similar fit, lovely."
4.0,"Decent quality material for such a cheap price. Wish it was a little bigger ( I bought the biggest size option available ) I'm a 38 DD weighing anywhere between 150-175 (it changes a lot due to my food allergies) and 5 foot 3, this is how it looks on me. (Sorry for the crappy pic) because my chest stretches it, it definitely becomes more see through! Fair warning to full chested girls. Still loved it for its uniqueness and I'll probably just throw a jacket over top of it. It's very comfy!!!"
4.0,Very nice charms are a little bigger than I thought they would be
4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this bag...I really like it but I think I could have found something better for the purpose I want to use it for.  I spent days trying to find something that would hold a 12.5 computer for an upcoming flight and finally picked this one.  It's really cute but with the computer in it, it's snug.  I also didn't realize the hardware was gold... I may have missed that somewhere.  Decent quality.  I think it will work for my trip so I'll be keeping it."
4.0,I wish the fringe went further around to the butt and in the front… but honestly outside of that I am so surprised with these shorts coming from Amazon.<br />I’ll probably buy more.<br /><br />I am 5’5<br />165 lbs<br />Purchased a size large
4.0,I wear a small but I got it in a Medium. I wished I got it in a Large. But it fits great....
4.0,This dress is eye catching and so elegant. I will wear it to a gala. I will be th he belle of the ball.
4.0,Love the fit and look but doesn’t keep hands warm when in the 30’s.
4.0,"They fit as expected. I'm 5'4"" and they weren't too long."
4.0,"Colors and material are as expected. Overrall fit good, sleeve length a little short on me."
4.0,High on thighs. But super cute
4.0,"very sweet gift idea!!! 💖 i was expecting the chain to be longer and pendant larger, but all in all it is EXACTLY as pictured. xo"
4.0,The size is just right and comfortable.
4.0,"I have the iloveSIA nursing bras and they wouldn't clasp without these extenders. The only issue is the clasps don't line up- more annoying than anything, because you get one clipped and another falls off. But eventually I get them to work."
4.0,Good but the tshirt is a little bit longer than I expected
4.0,very pretty and lightweight
4.0,"I bought a medium and it is comfortable but a little shorter than I would have liked. I large would have been too big I. The chest and wait given heaven the medium top is a little big at the bust for me (34c) and it’s very cropped. Bought the cream and lavender color and I prefer the lavender, the cream has a yellow undertone which I don’t prefer."
4.0,"Fair quality leather, boots look as pictured. I recommend buying a size larger than normally worn. The boots are made small. I usually wear a 9, I got a size 10 which is a good fit."
4.0,"I ordered a large (i'm 5-9, about 145lb) and it is near perfect even with a layer or two underneath; the problem lies in the biceps and shoulder width, its not SUPER limiting, but it is overly snug for sure, and i'm not a muscular body type at all. So i'd say XL would have been the wiser choice for overall comfort. But the actual quality of the leather and the construction is beautiful, and a pretty much perfect replica of Jessica Jone's jacket."
4.0,"Good strap! I'm using it in a submariner homage, I wish it had instructions on how to fit it to size, since it has to be cut carefully, the clasp is ok.<br /><br />I think for the money is a great product!"
4.0,I like the color and make. I wish it was a little bit bigger.
4.0,Runs small but otherwise comfortable
4.0,I am 5'2&#34; & it hits below my knees.
4.0,"For $10 it’s just as nice as the $25 version. I only gave 4 stars because the glass is quite scratched on one side. But against skin or clothing it doesn’t show terribly. Still, a bit bummed because it was a gift and I didn’t have time to order a replacement.<br /><br />The chain is a bit thick, so I ordered a daintier silver one and it made the whole package look that much nicer.<br /><br />Overall satisfied, but wish it wasn’t scratched. The scratches don’t show well in the picture."
4.0,"Product is as promised, works well with my pocket squares"
4.0,Good  wallet. Sturdy. Eye catcher for sure :) Wish it had more storage space for large bills.
4.0,"Very nice pair of earrings for the price. Very shiny and they don't look fake. The 6mm size is perfect for me--not too big or small, and compared to other cz's I've worn, they sparkle quite a bit and aren't dull."
4.0,Love the color options but hate the band isn’t secured to the other side.
4.0,"Sweet, made well and photographs well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that the buckles are a little tough to work with."
4.0,Great product.  Did the trick.
4.0,"Gave this out to some friends of mine. They loved them and a year later, some are still wearing these rubber bracelets as daily reminders"
4.0,Cheap material but still really pretty!!
4.0,"The breast area was a little loose and I'm full figure girl, but all in all it is a very nice dress"
4.0,AS DESCRIBED IN THE AD FOR THE FLIP FLOP SOCKS. PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH.  IN INDIA THESE ARE WAY CHEAPER.
4.0,"These fit my wider face, but the quality/finish isn't what I'd hoped."
4.0,It is thin and beautiful.
4.0,"Very pretty, just too large"
4.0,It's simple to put on my smart active 2 the only thing was that It was a bit sweaty around my wrist and that had me constantly pulling it to the bigger hole and moving it up my arm.. other than that it's strong and bendy and the green color matches my phone case so I loved that.
4.0,"The ONLY thing I can complain about is my annoyance with the pointy pocket area. If you stand with your arms out the dress hangs like a diamond, but who stands like that?! It really is just a personal opinion. The dress is fantastic! I’ve found a way to alleviate the pocket area point by hanging sewing clamps on the inside of the dress.<br /><br />It is SUCH a versatile dress and so flattering and comfy.<br /><br />I’m back to purchase another color!<br /><br />6’ tall, size 12 and I bought a large and have plenty of room."
4.0,great dress for the price.  I got it as my maid of honor dress at 7 weeks postpartum.<br /><br />I still have a tummy and the dress fits and doesn't make me look overly pregnant
4.0,"They just feel like they might wear out, quickly...not very thick."
4.0,"3/4 sleeves and touches the knees- it's PERFECT for work!  The material is great: thick enough to keep me warm in the cold office, yet thin enough to survive the Miami heat. I wear sizes 8-10 in dresses (depending on brand/style), I'm 5'4 and 150 lbs (with curves)- based on reviews and size chart I got the XL. It fits really nice.  It's a little loose in the front midsection but for work (for me) this is just fine.  All other areas (thighs, rear, arms etc) were just right. I liked it so much I bought other HOMEYEE dresses for work-  they're the best dresses to feel comfy and sexy on a workday."
4.0,Love them.  Would like for hooks to be a little heavier duty but they are beautiful
4.0,"Price excellent, looks a little cheaper than in photo.  Using it in retro-type Bakelite jewelry  reminiscent of 40's-50's style costume jewelry, so I can pull off a classier appearance using other beads surrounding it.  Shipped on time."
4.0,"I ordered size M, but will exchange for S. Pants are slimming and very comfortable. I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs, 29"" waist, with long torso / shorter legs. The M was too big in the waist, so I worry they'll droop down and sweep the floor. I'll try a size S and see if that solves it. Length hits just below ankles for me (sweeps the tops of my feet)."
4.0,"Nice ties at a great price point. These aren't the best ties ... but they're good ties. Add in the right price and they're a really good bargain. Just right for anyone who doesn't wear ties a lot or younger guys who are just starting out and need some decent ties to mix it up. Stitching, quality, length are all good."
4.0,"shirt is great. I use if for traveling. with 4 pockets, its great for plan tix, hand sani, ear buds etc. love the look. more comfortable than expected. only issue is buttons on wrong side. very hard to button up the shirt"
4.0,"This “I run like a Girl. Try to Keep Up” t-shirt is super cute. I like the phrase, it could be interpreted either way. I got XL going with the size chart bust measurements provided, figuring it would end up being fitted around the bust going with those, but it’s larger than expected – I should have gone with a large or medium instead. With the XL, I have a tank top underneath it and it is still loose. While I don’t mind it being a little loose, I like it a little more fitted than this. Otherwise, it is a very comfortable tee, it’s soft and not starchy or on the stiff side like some printed t-shirt fabrics can be. It feels light-weight while on, and does not drape heavily. The v-neck cut is prefect, sometimes you get v-necks that are cut too high, but not this one – this is where I like my v-necks to be. The color is vibrant and the graphics sharp, I normally don’t go for a red, but I think it kind of goes and works with the phrase!  I received this t-shirt at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Sizing is accurate stile is classy perfect for office environment
4.0,"They took quite awhile to get here, but once delivered I found them to be decently warm while wicking well.  The high visibility color is also a huge plus.  In my part of the world, the more high visibility clothing you wear, the safer you are.  I don’t use the stash feature but I’m sure many folks will find it helpful.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from giving these nice mittens a 5-Star rating is the thumb.  Seriously, the thumb.  When you run in cold weather, your nose runs as well, and a soft terrycloth patch on the thumb would be quite helpful from time to time."
4.0,Very pretty but a little too small
4.0,"these are great and well made, so far, seem to be good quality, but they are giant, much like goggles, so if thats the look you want, these are for you, i dont see myself wearing them a lot, i look like i have an older persons sunglasses on to cover my bad vision glasses, lol!!!"
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous! I wore it to a retirement/birthday party and the gals and guys gave me lots of compliments. My only complaint is before I even wore the dress, I noticed a small tear in one of the back seams by the waist.  I had to mend it myself before wearing it."
4.0,Its very cute. Tops fits perfectly (I'm a small 36 C) but the bottom I barely got on past my hips. I ordered a medium. I am 5'7&quot; 131 lbs. So I'm re-ordering in a large. Runs a bit small. I don't have big hips. I measure 28 inch in waist and 37 inthe  hips so if your are the same height and weight and have bigger hips than me then you may want to get an XL.
4.0,Good fitting cap.
4.0,The price is no to much good
4.0,I bought this for my car keys and it fits great. I love the fact that its double sided! The only problem is that the clip sometimes opens
4.0,My granddaughter loved this ring.
4.0,Runs super small. The material is not high quality but the dress style is super cute.
4.0,"From all the different reviews, I ordered an XL.  Fits great but it's only comes down to my waist (not like how it's advertised).  I'm 5'11&#34; and about 180 lbs.  I had a double mastectomy due to cancer and I'm now in the reconstruction phase.  I've ordered a lot of off the shoulder shirts as they look the best on while expanding my chest 😊."
4.0,"I like this dress. One seam horizontal seam for the skirt is elastic and one is not. I find that it does matter and I often feel like I'm pulling on it accidently. Also no pockets. 😔 It's flattering for me. Pretty comfy and for the price, it's awesome."
4.0,Order on the smaller size. Because they stretch (as is supposed to) you'll find them slipping and not holding like a belt.
4.0,"The only reason I docked a star is because they don’t fit snuggly enough on the earlobe. So you can tell it’s not gauged. I wanted these go a faux gauge look. Otherwise they are sturdy, and super cute."
4.0,"Nice vest, plenty of pockets, size is not true, maybe a Chinese 4"
4.0,Really cute skirt a but small so order a size or 3 up
4.0,"The material is very soft and nice. The orange is not as bold as the picture shows, but it is still pretty."
4.0,Like the fact the earrings are reversable - wish the seller had described that the post is on the white gold side.  Hard to install from the back if I want the yellow gold side to show.  Picture does not show that these are molded earrings - not solid.  They are comfortable to wear.  These replace a pair that were similar and were stolen about 18 months ago.  Have been looking for this same design as they were favorites.  Am happy with the purchase and will wear often.
4.0,"These scarfs are worth what you pay for them, they are not as long as others I have purchased but sufficient. Not long enough to do any fancy tying but good just to add color to outfits!"
4.0,"Good construction, just took forever to get it"
4.0,I am from america but i wanted to get the china glasses cause i thought they looked cool and be nice change even though i love my country and always proud to be a american i thought the panda bear on the glasses was cute and it would be a cute thing for my kids to play with so its not a fashion statement i will be wearing cause they look more like toy glasses then nice glasses but there fun for my kids and they still look cool.<br />i received these glasses for free in exchange for a honest unbiased review.
4.0,Just fine!
4.0,It's nice. It is just like the ones in the store which cost a lot more. Great buy!
4.0,Asian fit. Material a little off but for the price
4.0,The bow tie is absolutely beautiful. I only gave it a 4 because it’s a clip on. Other than that by boyfriend loved it.
4.0,"I normally wear a 8-10 in womens, this dress fit in the arms but was somewhat large in the body of the dress.  But If I wear it with a black belt it looks fine!"
4.0,"This is so cute on. I'm between a 14-16 and it fit perfectly. I really didn't care for the bust bc I'm a little bigger up there but it wasn't bad. I really like the rouching at the waist, it hides the tummy well. I really love it. And the color is gorgeous!!"
4.0,"This is a nice, casual dress that looks great with a belt.  The material is very soft and it washes well."
4.0,"These glasses definitely live up to the product description.  They are nice, and HUGE!!!!  Wearing them definitely gives you attitude.  The reason I only gave them 4 stars is because there's no comfort guard on the nose.  They're so heavy, they start to hurt the bridge of your nose after a while."
4.0,To big order one size smaller
4.0,The dress is pretty but my bra size is DD and the material stretches out of color on my chest area. I still haven’t wore it anywhere. It’s been months.
4.0,Scarf is larger than I thought it would be. Nice material.
4.0,I'm satisfied with the dress.
4.0,"nice fit, good fabric.  Hasn't been washed or worn yet though.  Hope it washes well."
4.0,Nice hat but I feel like im wearing a hunting hat..  it was shipped over fast and had no damge.
4.0,I have bought a lot for my clients and they are great.
4.0,True to size make you look slimmer.<br />Gave 4 stars cuz it's static . Let's see what happens after a wash.
4.0,works fine...<br />looks girlish (nt that it matters at all neither do i hav problems with any)<br />not tht piece-of-cake level of easyness<br />needs two hands to work<br />REALLY STRONG for sure
4.0,"I really like this work out shirt. Comfortable, cute and I love the color. I order my normal size L, and the fit is good. On the snug side without being too tight. Perfect for the gym and yoga."
4.0,As advertised.  Love the color.
4.0,Nice colors but the material is very thin.
4.0,It looks exactly like the photo. The silky material keeps falling off my shoulder so I tied it in the front. It is pretty cute. I just wish that it wasn't so large. I'm 5&#34;4-140lbs. It is pretty big on me.
4.0,Love it! Very chic and not so big I feel conspicuous!
4.0,Just like picture. Just a bit hard. Not really like rubber. I would say works great for getting wet. But if you are looking for really comfy sandals with good support these would not be it.
4.0,The earrings are a xmas gift for my daughter who has 3 piercings in each earlob.  The earrings look exactly like they are pictured.  After she wears them I will be able to tell you more.
4.0,"I usually wear a 4/6 so I ordered a small and was drowning in it! Super disappointed because the coat seems really nice, good weight and feel, wish there was an XS so I good reorder. Had to return :("
4.0,The shape is a little odd when put on but I really like the feel of the material.
4.0,I chose these to carry my sunglasses and reading glass safely.  The soft slim type smear my lenses and offer little protection. An added bonus is the carrying swivel and great value.
4.0,The price was great for the three different color sleep caps.  The quality is good and texture Is very comfortable to sleep in. I was very surprised that the the ban was not too small very comfortable fit.
4.0,Love design and material
4.0,"Seems like a great shoe, but with most brands i wear a size 12. the 12 was way too big. Took them back and got an 11, still too big. Hopefully the 10 will be perfect. Probably a bit different also because with this style of slip on shoe you really do want it to be snug."
4.0,"love the look of the earrings, but had one of the metal 'petals' fall off the first time I wore them :("
4.0,This sweatshirt was warm and comfortable.  Hopefully it'll last a few years.  I'll try and do a follow-up review later.
4.0,"These are beautiful little earrings, amazing quality and luster for the price, but my GOD are the backs hard to get on... I'm going to have to find others to use with these."
4.0,"Super cute, but you can tell it is cheap. Worked great for what we needed it for."
4.0,Nice fabric a bit sheer but overall good dress
4.0,Adorable slippers though soles could use some additional cushioning.
4.0,It's a very good looking coat and it fits as expected. Nice coat. The nice leather covers on the string pulls came off right away. The threads they were laced with were not secured. I finally figured out I could redo them with needle and thread and keep them on. Had to fix every one of them. Other than that the coat seems well made
4.0,I love how it fits although i was going for something bigger but its good enough for my ring finger
4.0,Dress has a full fit. It is a very pretty dress with nice coloring. The material is very thick making it more of a winter dress. Dress material is not tight or clingy at all. This would be a nice work dress.<br />The waistline is decent and fit nicely. Length of dress is fairly decent not too short.
4.0,Beware! This is just for suspenders. The picture shows both the bow tie and suspenders.
4.0,"Our grandson is on a Michael Jackson kick, and he has really enjoyed these shoes."
4.0,I recently purchased this pair of earrings and I just loved them. They are so beautiful and amazing quality. Its great for sensitive ears like me.
4.0,"Turkey earrings for thanksgiving wearing!<br />Cute but wish was metal, not plastic."
4.0,Thin but sparkle
4.0,Watch is really nice but does not look like the picture
4.0,As pictured. My waist is about 34&#34; and it was a bit tight but wearable through a wedding.
4.0,Longer than expected. I am 5'5 and it is almost to my knees.
4.0,"The breathable material around the honda logo on the front of this jacket has started to fray from the wind, after the end of the summer season.  I love this jacket, it fits well, feels good, I just don't expect it to last very many seasons.  Honestly, I'll probably just buy another one when the time comes.  I have gotten many compliments and it fits me better then my joe rocket of similar size."
4.0,"These are absolutely adorable. I ordered for both of my girls and both of them fit well. My older daughter's was a little short but that was because 3-4 years was the largest available and shes 4, so no fault of the sellers. I think the elastic at the waist also made the dress lift up as she played.<br />A few loose strings but nothing too noticeable."
4.0,The fit was off and uncomfortable so I returned them
4.0,very cute.  versatile and classic.
4.0,Cute top that fits me well.  I'm 36B-5'5&#34;114#.  The only thing I don't like is the zippers are rather puckered.
4.0,Cute accessory
4.0,I purchased the t-shirts because of the reviews.  The quality it good but the sizing is off.  They were too small.  I followed the sizing for my size.  I paid $18.95  To return it they want me to pay 19.95!  The company added that they will return the remainder of my purchase price.  What a joke.  I have never had this happen buying through Amazon.  No where in the information does it mention that you will be charged a fee.  I would be willing to pay USPS cost but not $20.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted the seller and they got back to me the same day.  Due to the issues I had they are refunding my payment and told me to keep the t-shirts.  I have family who will enjoy them.
4.0,"I purchased this hat with the intention of donning it at last year's Kentucky Derby, and not only did I receive multiple enthusiastic compliments on my bold fashion choice, but I was able to reuse it for many other occasions (i.e. church, picnics, work, and even camping!)  This was always the right choice.  I love this hat so much that when I ruined it in the wilderness (does NOT hold up in the rain), I not only eagerly replaced it, I bought all four colors!  I strongly recommend that you go with this gorgeous hat, whoever you are.  As I am entering into matrimony in three months, I have decided to adorn my bridesmaid's heads with the different colors of this headpiece.  My only beef with this franchise is that they do not come in white.  Bummer..."
4.0,Tons of compliments on these...a little heavy but they are of good quality.
4.0,"This is a super cute dress and a great color.  It's made of a nice thick material and will be great for winter.  It doesn't have pockets and is a bit bunchy at the top of it around the neck, but its very comfy and cute."
4.0,Great quality but too small
4.0,Real comfortable the material is soft and cool really like it thank you will definitely  order again really nice colors are good .
4.0,We used these as runner up prizes for an ugly sweater contest. Only downside is they are quite small so unless you are an adult that is child size then this will squeeze your skull until your eyes pop out. Small but fun!
4.0,Bought as a gift recipient loved it at a very fair price is
4.0,Wasn't what I expected but it was very useful
4.0,Sure cute. But the size was smaller than most.
4.0,They're good for reading when I need them.
4.0,"Overall not a bad product, after 15 miles I had to adjust due to the pad wearing down."
4.0,"Nice but not as form fitting as i would like i ordered my reg us size xl maybe should have just gotten a large, but i have to say compared to other sellers at amazon on items ive purchased, these colors are very brilliant and are  very true to the picture i may order more, but i only like bright colors for summer and darker colors for fall and winter, which it maybe too cold to wear these except they would be good under clothes im 5 ft 4 weigh 147 bust are 38d US size , ladies please when submitting reviews can you say your height weight bust as well as what size you purchased, it helps other shoppers to see if an item will fit them and we all save time, thx and happy shopping!!!!"
4.0,"Very nice and nicely made, but sadly way too small. :("
4.0,"I read various reviews before I purchased this product and made sure to purchase a larger size, as many reviews said this ran small. I normally wear a size 14- between a large and an XL. I ordered a 3x and it was just a tiny bit too big. I'm convinced the large or XL would've been too snug. So make sure you order at least a size up from what you would normally wear.<br /><br />The one nit that I have for the product is there are no instructions telling you how to place it on your body. The picture that I saw when ordering shows the model wearing this product outside her clothes. I tried it both outside my clothes, with just my t-shirt over the waist and over my pants. I also tried this with the entire waist and thigh trimmer underneath my clothes. You sweat much more and it absolutely works better if you put the 3-in1 trimmer next to your skin, instead of over top your clothing.  I've been using this 3-in1 trimmer as I exercise and diet this week and now that I know to put the 3 in-1 trimmer directly against my skin, I'm pleased to see how much it makes me sweat!"
4.0,"I am a xl but I got it's as a XXL. It fits very nicely but some things I don't like are that the sleeves keep rolling down. I'm five ft and weigh 180. The stockings are very long on me and the elastic doesn't help but nothing some minor sewing can't help. Really the oy thing stopping at five stars are the sleeves. It stretches nice, is breathable, flexible, and fits nicely on my body in a way I don't feel snug."
4.0,I was really surprised that the colors on the pendent are better than the profile picture and the chain looks fantastic with it.
4.0,Looks hoot fits good
4.0,I am very hippy tall and busty so i ordered the next size up in anticipation of a european fit. WRONG the dress is too big and falls off my shoulders so i ordered another at a smaller size. I like the product and would recommend
4.0,"Fit as described.  After washing the decal lost a little brightness. Overall, recommend this shirt. Good value for the price."
4.0,Nice little wallet for the money. Of course I won't know if the RFID blocking works or not unless someone actually uses one of those devices and I know about it. But the color is good and my cards fit.
4.0,"Beautiful dress but too tight, usually wear a size 12 in dresses, bought xl and still too small, last year I ordered an xl and it fit perfect, maybe the sizes got adjusted down? Not sure, definitely take your measurements correctly and probably order at least one size up<br /><br />This dress has material to expand in the front, wonderful for tummy hide"
4.0,Colors didn’t make the pant that I order.  But otherwise the product is good.
4.0,"Seller got the item delivered real fast and with no problems at all. The watch itself is ok, but the color scheme makes it somewhat hard to read since the pointers are difficult to see sometimes. Other than that it is a fine watch, works well, is quite comfortable and well built. Satisfied overall."
4.0,"It’s a very nice dress but I am 5.6”  and it was long . Material is very soft and comfortable . I didn’t like how it showed every detail on my back even if it was like a small roll ...so I would’ve needed a shapeware which defeats the purpose of me buying it in the first place (( we all know how suffocating shapeware can be !)) ,I wanted a pretty dress that I’m going to be comfortable in. So I returned it."
4.0,Durable and a great classic look.
4.0,Good quality shorts and they fit well. My only problem with them was that they were not stretchy and that limited the range of my high kicks. I could not roundhouse high kick to the head. The highest it would allow me to go is the shoulder of a ~6’0 partner. I bought the large size.
4.0,"Just what I was looking for, fits over clothes well and is easy to get on an off."
4.0,"Love the sleeves and style. The yellow is nit heathered like the pictures, but is still mustard enough to look good.  The ties are a little long, so I might cut them."
4.0,Very beautiful ring ....it felt so fragile in a way (although my daughter said it had a rough edge feeling) the color  we order  was the rose colored one it was a darker color then in photo ..but still ring is beautiful
4.0,Super comfy nice shirt
4.0,Nice style.
4.0,"I'm not sure I should have high expectations for kids sunglasses like this, but my daughter really wanted them and loved the cute color and heart shaped design. She wore them for a school spirit day and was thrilled. However, I had also hoped she could wear them to the beach this summer, but they don't seem to do a great job of blocking the light. Really just for looks, which are very cute."
4.0,I walk on a concrete floor 7 hrs. a day and these shoes are comfortable. Also resist slipping  on a wet floor<br />So many colors to choose from..
4.0,Material is wonderful. Probably could have gone down a size - but it is Avery pretty skirt
4.0,"I loved the style and fit of this dress. However, I ordered the blue expecting it be a soft, light blue. But instead, it is a bold, bright turquoise."
4.0,"fit & quality was fine but as soon as I got these, I found the same thing for $6 less near my home in IL"
4.0,"I really like these.  The material is thinner than expected but that's ok for wearing around the house.  The fabric feels like a jersey, but if you look inside the pants, there is a look of light fleece.  The only thing that I found annoying goes along with other reviews.  These pants are soooooo long.  Not all women are 6 foot tall and I'll need to cut off at least 6 inches.  Good grief."
4.0,"It fit very well, made me feel very sexy"
4.0,The fit is very tight. I would order at minimum a size larger.  The feel is very soft. And made very well. Just the sizing is incorrect.
4.0,Nice top but the sleeves are a little long.
4.0,great if it were a little bigger i would give 5 stars
4.0,Had some issues with the durability of these bows (lets face it - we used pink and purple a LOT) and a few of them have started to unravel. The more uncommon colors were used less and are still in mint condition. These bows are adorable and the wear we did get was reasonable for the money and amount of bows in the set. I would buy from this company again. Excellent customer service.
4.0,Comfortable for exercise and sleeping.
4.0,"I love the fit, color, and style of this hat! The hat keeps the sun off my face and my ponytail off my neck. The only negative is that the bill has several creases from the packaging."
4.0,"Great dress.  Got lots of compliments on it.  I did take the bow off the side, which was really easy to do.  (not my style) My only complaint is that I washed the dress in COLD water and it still shrank.  The tag says it can be hand washed in cold, but they recommend dry cleaning.  I'm not dry cleaning a $12 dress.  And since it hangs to dry, mine got really wrinkly.  As it had already shrunk, I was afraid to steam the dress.  I work it a little wrinkly and no one seemed seemed to notice all that much.  Next time I am going to try some wrinkly release spray on it."
4.0,"Fits great! And comfortable! I'm 5'4, 110 and fits perfect, came with a couple loose strings though"
4.0,"This ring is very sturdy. I wore it in a size 6 while I waited for my jeweler to resize my real wedding ring to a 6.5, and they seemed almost the same size, so it seems like this ring runs a little big. I wore it in the shower, and pretty much didn't take it off for over two weeks and it quickly started looking like a dark yellow gold. At the jewelry store the woman working there said it looked like real yellow gold to her, but next to my rose gold ring it looked super yellow. I think that calling this &#34;rose gold plated&#34; is pretty misleading because it looks like regular yellow gold in the customer photos as well as in real life. With that being said I'm still pretty glad I got it as a back up because $15 is definitely not too bad of a deal for a plated tungsten ring."
4.0,Pretty but a little shorter than I thought.
4.0,Very comfortable fit.  Wear it often.
4.0,Would like more compression<br />Warm when wearing due to the material
4.0,"These are very nice neckties. I had to dock 1 star for the packaging because it says AWESOME! on the front and it looks kind of tacky and makes the ties look cheap. It would have been PERFECT if it came in a wonderful, higher quality box/packaging. The ties themselves are nice quality and has a good feel to the fabric."
4.0,"Super cool cause its Hunter. S Thompson and Rick and Morty worlds colliding, but the pin can easily break or it would be 5 stars."
4.0,Everything is great but shoulders are tight.
4.0,love them ... well made but TINY
4.0,"It feels nice to touch, heavy, pretty"
4.0,"it came a week earlier than it was supposed to, and I am so happy about that! It is exactly as shown, though the hinge doesn't open up as much. The clock works perfectly, and there are a few smudges on the inside. other than that, its great for the price!"
4.0,"My son gives this five stars, however the felt material mask really wasn’t it for me."
4.0,"I really love the graphic of this case (as a pianist). That's why I was willing to risk not putting a more secure case on my phone. I've always kept an Otterbox on my phones, and while it did save my phone more than once, I hated the bulkiness and the beyond blah look of them. This case does seem to offer some protection, it has a raised lip around the screen and a rubberized backing. The texturized rubber on the sides makes it easier to keep a grip on the phone. So far, I've been very careful and haven't dropped my phone, so I can't speak to the real protective nature of the case. But I love the thin profile and of course, the graphic, so I'm being extra careful. The only bone I have to pick with the case, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the on/off button. The way the case covers it, it's quite hard to access. You really have to push in exactly the right spot. While the case does have the button designed into it, it's not distinctive enough. Most times I have to turn the case over to see where I'm suppose to be pushing. That aspect could've/should've been designed better. I am seriously thinking about taking an exacto knife and cutting out that portion so I can access the on/off button directly."
4.0,I like the color quality and pockets of this bag each compartment has its own zipper.  The only criticism I have is the shoulder strap is a little loner than it needs to be but would work if there were a couple more holes to adjust the length.  I feel it is a well made bag and good quality for the price.  Did have an odor when I first opened it but it dissipated quickly
4.0,"Bought this watch four years ago this month, haven't had to change a battery or worry about it after all this time of daily use and even taking it off nearly every night.<br /><br />Only reason I'm looking at a new one now is the strap is cracking at the notch I usually use."
4.0,"Polarized Sunglasses for Women Ladies Brand Trending Sun glasses UV400<br /><br />Very comfortable and nice looking glasses. Look like expensive designer glasses. Not sure of the price on these yet. I would expect to pay about $20-$30 for these glasses. You get the glasses, a soft case, a cleaning cloth and a screw driver keychain. UV400 to protect your eyes. Lightweight - look great! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! Nicely packaged - would make an excellent gift! I have other glasses from this seller and I have not had any issues at all. I recommend these!"
4.0,"Was cheap and satisfying to wear, Wore them to work once while a certain manager was there, he laughed and proceeded to fist bump me."
4.0,"I like most things about this necklace, but the clip can be a little annoying to put on, especially when the cross keeps falling off. But I'm also a dude, so I don't have much experience putting jewelry clips on."
4.0,"This is definitely giftable: he's only had it for a few days but states its nice, feels sleepy and durable. Nice budget friendly item."
4.0,"The picture shown is enlarged so the earrings were smaller than I thought, even though there was a picture on a mannequin. Other than that, the earrings look totally cute. These are a gift to my mom, so they haven't been used yet."
4.0,Each one very beautiful
4.0,"It's kind of a stiff, shiny tie, but I like it. It's an all purpose marrying and burying tie."
4.0,"Beautiful, but collar pokes me in the neck."
4.0,Need 3x in jacket.
4.0,"Fits me well-especially keeping in mind it's hard to find decent fishing shirts for women (why in the world do the womens shirts have scooped necks that leave you scorching in the sun?!).Love LOVE the bright ghost orange for maximum visibility while kayak fishing the ocean. Not cheap, but worth it. Now if Huk made their quarter zip/mock neck in small and orange...I'd be all over them. Keeps me cool all day in the hot Florida summer."
4.0,"Really nice, had to return it for the next size because It was a bit snug in the bust area. Love this dress."
4.0,"These are cheap plastic BUT you get what you pay for! I love these glasses though, their cute and trendy!"
4.0,Works just like advertised except it dosent shut off when fully charged and wish it had more preloaded pics on the app
4.0,This glove set has very good quality and it's extra long. The only issue is they need to size up. I ordered medium size. But what I got probably only like small size.
4.0,"Nice size, color true to picture, but prettier on the actual item. All of the edges are nicely hemmed is even. I deducted one star because of the rediculously slow shipping/delivery time. Recieved another scarf I ordered at the same time from another vendor in half the time. Over all, if you are not in a hurry this is worth the wait."
4.0,"It's nice. Liked the simple Kawasaki logo. As most tshirts nowadays, seems a little thin for the material. Oh well, was not very expensive and I am happy with it. Fit is good, maybe a hair long."
4.0,"4 stars instead of 5 because you can't wear a bra with this dress due to it's open back.  This dress is better quality than I expected, and the fit is perfect."
4.0,This is ok.  Not sure how many times I will be able to wear it as I'm not sure how long it will stay sticky.  It does keep the girls together so far
4.0,Just the right size. Perfect for gym or to run errands. Can hold all the essentials without any issues. A great buy.
4.0,I bought these for my wife. She is more of a “granny panty” type. At least these have color and look nicer on her.
4.0,Cute sunglasses and packaged very nicely.<br />They are however very large on my face. I look like a 5 year old wearing my Mommy's glasses.
4.0,Comfortable. Fair Quality.
4.0,"The main thing that didn’t make this a five star review was the fact that the blue band isn’t the same shade of blue as shown in the images posted on Amazon. It’s technically a rich deep navy blue, not this nice subtle slate blue color which is why I purchased this set in the first place. :/"
4.0,"Fits well, looks great with the blue face from the gear fit 2 series. I like the clasp closure way better than the original band and I think this one will be more secure."
4.0,"Shirt is pretty, like others said material look cheap, but still pretty. The back side is long and is see thru, so you would have to wear something under it."
4.0,Thought material may have looked a little better quality
4.0,"Nice product for the price, nice fabric and great price overall for what you get."
4.0,"Very cute and fun. Where I showed this top to my husband, he said…yep, I totally agree!<br />Nice and lighting top. But it is a bit tight. I recommend going up a size.<br />I weigh 153 pounds and 6’2”, bra 36 DDD. Hoping this helps you pick a good size for yourself.<br />Recommended"
4.0,"Great bag, I wish it had a choice of the gold and silver zippers, I wear a lot of silver."
4.0,"The dress looks great and after five washings to get rid of the perfume, still looks great.  I'm a size 8 and Medium fits perfectly.  A caveat though:  if you are allergic to perfume as I am, do not pull this dress out of the bag indoors.  I had headaches for a couple of days because I couldn't get the perfume out of the wooden countertop that the dress rested on as I unpacked it, nor out of the dress that I had to keep washing.  Sheesh, let up on the perfume a bit, would you?"
4.0,My teenage son bought this for his girlfriend. It's cute and dainty.
4.0,This is a good size and very pretty. I get many compliments on it when I wear it. It definitely has sparkle! I also like that it stays in place when I wear it.
4.0,I returned these because they were to light. They were great in every other way. Have since ordered a new pair.
4.0,"Super cozy, cute dress! It was a little longer than I'd like, but I am short so it was fair. Its very soft and pockets on a dress are always awesome!"
4.0,"I needed something to wear while playing blackjack or paying bills, and this does the job. The shape is slightly tapered, but it's not piligrim-shaped as stated in other reviews."
4.0,Perfect for everyday wear!
4.0,"The amulet come entangled with its (not so strong) chain. I had to break the chain (which was way too easy to do) and pull part of it from between the dragons.  The amulet itself is good, but like the Targaryen state of mental health- not quite perfect..."
4.0,"The item does run very small, so keep this in mind when ordering. It is more of a lightweight material so not for super cold days but good for chilly fall days. It is certainly worth the price. Customer service is excellent for this company."
4.0,Very cute for my daughters costume. The spider was not attached upon arrival and we had to sew it on.
4.0,Es bonito pero muy rosado
4.0,"The post seems a bit weak.  It moves, so I have to be careful when I put on, or take of this ear cuff.  Otherwise, it's beautiful."
4.0,"This is a beautiful set.  I purchased this set for my upcoming 28th wedding anniversary/vow renewal.  I would have given my purchase 5 stars, but the backs to the earrings arrived broken and the earring stems were bent."
4.0,"Very cute and soft but sizing is off. Definitely need to size up. These are the same size, if not smaller, than a pair we have in another brand that are size 11-12. Unfortunately we will have to return."
4.0,"I did like these rings. Cute.<br /><br />Surprisingly mroe of a thicker material then I expected,<br />which is good considering the cheap price"
4.0,Beautiful dress. Material is very thin and sort of cheap and the dress is very long but it is beautiful and besides the length it fits perfectly. Material doesnt look as cheap as it feels
4.0,Fits slightly bigger than a 3x. Image isn't pressed that great. Still a good buy. It's thin so great for spring time.
4.0,"This is actually my second time buying this watch (I accidentally broke my first one by over-twisting the wind up knob. That was my fault though. Although the top stainless steel ring that surrounds the watch fell off during one of my runs, that was my only issue with the watch.)<br /><br />All I can say is that this watch is amazing and stunning. I mean, I bought two so far! That should say something about this watch right there!  People have mistaken this for a $100 plus watch because of how visually stunning it is. I cannot express enough in words how much I love the design of this watch. To me it actually looks BETTER in reality than it does in the picture.<br /><br />Bottom line: this watch is an extremely wise purchase, and you will most likely not regret it.<br /><br />Edit: Okay you might regret it slightly. The circular part of the watch fell off AGAIN sometime during of my day. AGAIN. I mean seriously? It's only been 3-4 days. They need to glue it on or something. You can't just sit a ring on the top of the main body of the watch in some ledge and expect it to stay. They should've known that. That's a pretty serious defect because it changes the look of the watch (doesn't look too bad, but the ring is most likely lost forever.)"
4.0,Oddly tight around the neck. I have a size 17.5. Fine otherwise
4.0,Comfortable summer dress
4.0,"What a great undergarments. They make ""the boys"" feel secure. I highly recommend them."
4.0,I loved the way the body suit felt. However i am 5ft tall and have big boobs. So normally i am a large top and a small bottom. I wanted to buy a small but i didnt want the outfit to stretch.. So i bought a medium which fit fine but i didnt like that there was so much slack in the pelvic area so it bunched up. The body suit fit perfect was not tight at all. I wore it once and before the night was over there was a hole in the back where the zipper stitching ended.
4.0,"A must buy product. After wearing the same hugs frames for the past six years, I wanted to try something new and more fashionable. And thanks to amazon and Newbee Fashion, I was able to transition into a new style with no problem. The lens are very full and cover the entire eye (thank god) and I've received numerous compliments. You can't go wrong with these!"
4.0,i like it very mush
4.0,"Cons<br />The only cons I have is it a little on the wide side. But all you have to do is improvise adapt and overcome. And I hate having to thread the drink tube into the bladder. Hello quick disconnect please!!!<br /><br />Pros<br /> Seems to me to be  well built with thicker material than some of the other bladders aka walmart. Very nice ability to open the top of the bladder and fill, has a nice handle, hold lots of water for those longer excursions, drink tube already has a cover on it, pop open valve for drinking, and comes with some cleaning accessories.<br /><br />Only reason i gave a 4 is because its a little wide.<br /><br />I didn't post pictures because others posted good pics already.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01F34I42I Hydration Bladder System 100oz/3litres, for Hydration pack with FREE Cleaning Brush , Easy to Clean Water Reservoir, Anti-bacteria, BPA Free Tasteless Water Bag Packs, for Cycling, Climbing, Hiking]]"
4.0,"Very cute, although doesn't slouch as much as the picture shows."
4.0,My son BEGGED me to get these.  He put them on as soon as we received them and hasn't gone back to his other pair since! He loves them!
4.0,"Just crew length, a comfortable blend of 80% cotton and the rest polyester and elastane. Fun Christmas/Yule patterns."
4.0,It is somewhat small. My wrists are 200mm in diameter.
4.0,"Very nice quality, but more than likely won't wear it because of the size. I was looking more for something that would be fitted."
4.0,"It is super long! Fits good in the chest, but the sleeves are down to my forearm and the bottom of the mail is to my knees. Made for tall thin guys I guess. None of the links are sealed, but the mail was only $78. Good pattern and great for the price."
4.0,"I purchased these for my kids who like 100% cotton pj pants, but impossible to find in kids brands because they all have fire retardant or are super tight. If you are buying for yourself as an adult female, just know that these pants will be extremely small. My kid is 11 and it fits great for this purpose."
4.0,"Good wallet, a bit pricey.  When I first opened the wallet, I was a bit skeptical.  It did not strike me as &#34;quality&#34; leather since the leather is so thin.  I expected a thicker leather not a thicker wallet.  I have an old fossil wallet that is really solid leather and just as thin as this JetSet, but the fossil is not RFID, hence purchasing this wallet.  BUT,,,,, after having the wallet for about a month, I have really come to like it a lot.  It is holding 6 credit cards, Health care, and a few other miscellaneous cards all with no issue and remains slim.  I'd give 5 stars, but honestly I think the price is a bit high for the product."
4.0,Very compressive. The top rolls up but pants stay in place. I’m really impressed. Love the design and gradient pattern. It does pass the squat test.
4.0,"Satisfied but never worth the retail value of $570<br />Quality is an 8 out of 10 , 10 being perfect ."
4.0,"This sweater is very soft and comfy.  It wears loose, so definitely consider wearing this with leggings and boots. It's a great sweater! Especially for the price!"
4.0,"The colors were vibrant and the material has a silky feeling. My daughter felt like a princess. I only gave 4 stars because, when the dress arrived some of the stitching under the right arm had become undone. Also, the size tag was sewn on the outside of the dress and was quite visible. I had to cut the tag as close to the seem as possible and still some of the tag was showing just a little. The dress was not packaged very well it was wrinkled and I had to apply a lot of steam."
4.0,Love it except neckline is a bit too big it turns out the deep v neckline is in back also which feels a bit uncomfortable to me. The other gown I ordered was not like this. They do run true to size the fabric is amazingly soft and keeps me cool . All in all a good purchase my fault for not noticing the difference of the neckline .
4.0,"Love these for my kids' athletic bags.  One caution if you have sensitive skin or prone to allergic skin reactions - my daughter placed these directly inside her stinky volleyball knee pads inside her bag.  Soon, she had a sore breakout all over her knees (front and back), and also on her lower legs.  We soon figured out that she must be allergic to the contents of the skunkies.  She broke out all around her knees where she wears her knee pads, and also on her lower legs, where her knee pads rest when pulled down when they're not in use.  Simple enough - she still keeps them in the BOTTOM of her bag, but doesn't place them directly up against her knee pads.  This does not seem to be a problem for her now, and we still keep the bag from stinking! Love these for my kids' athletic bags.

4.0,Kids love these---  they do scuff to a white under material that is easily covered with standard brown shoe polish.
4.0,I gifted this to a friend for christmas
4.0,Update: The dragon is fun. Arrived with broken chain and decided to exchange it. Undamaged this time.
4.0,Nice! I used it for a halloween costume and the length covered what I needed coverage!
4.0,"Just love this bag, it has lots of space to carry just about every and anything. Good value for money."
4.0,"I just received these goggles and I already love them. They fit great and are comfortable. I can't wait to try them out in the water. I especially love the adjustable head strap and buckle.<br /><br />As always, there is a downfall. one of the reasons that I purchased these was because they came with a case. The case looks like it would be a great case, had I not received a broken one. I thought it might had been damaged during shipping, but there were no broken pieces in the box. That means Amazon sent me a broken product. Unfortunately, I needed these pretty quick and I don't have time to send these back and receive a new pair. I also paid the extra shipping to have them here faster and they arrived a day later than promised."
4.0,I quite like these shorts. light and comfortable.  I had a little unfortunate experience with what was in stock and shipping. However I still recommend on the facts that they were very helpful and quick to solve the issue.
4.0,"PROS:<br />-very fast shipping time... and it was FREE!<br />-the length is really nice and the band is tight and does not stretch.<br />-if your like me and enjoy a high waist band on your leggings, these are for you.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-They are definitely a little see through. If you are going to be doing something that is high intensity, I wouldn't recommend these because of the thin fabric, but for people like me who just like to wear leggings basically everyday then these are fine (just don't bend down to far). SIDENOTE: The people who keep saying these are not see through, we must have gotten different leggings, because these are definitely not fully opaque.<br />-Again they are pretty thin. I was expecting them to be somewhat comparable to the VS leggings that I have come to love, but at such a hefty price tag:(.<br />-On the tag it says these retail for $78 and I definitely would not pay that much for these leggings. If your going to spend that much then buy<br />something that is nice quality that will last you a long time. I do not see these lasting for more than a year or two if you wear them as much as I do.<br />-One last thing, they do stretch out a smidgen when you wear them so be weary of that.<br /><br />P.S. sizing does run a little on the larger side. ie. I am usually an XL in most to all women's clothing, And I am happy that I sized down to the large because the XL would have been a mess.<br /><br />Overall, I think they are worth the buy. At $20 for a pair of leggings that are worn to run errands and do work around the house, they are definitely worth it."
4.0,"This is a very sweet gift. The bond between mother and daughter is very strong, and I love the sentiment. It is packaged beautifully. The necklace itself is made of sterling silver. The 2 interlocking circles represent infinity. Personally i think the chain could have been a little thicker.  Otherwise I think it is a lovely set."
4.0,cool shades and an Awesome price.
4.0,Works well. Doesn't leak when I have it in my hunting pack. Not a bad buy at all!
4.0,"These are good socks, but are just way to hot for me. They would be nice to wear during cold weather or traveling, but when I’m working as a nurse they just make my legs sweaty!!"
4.0,My daughter is a music education major.  Today is her birthday.  She received this as a gift and she loved it.
4.0,"It's a wrinkle fest and see through, but the rust color is nice."
4.0,It's cute for a bathing suit cover up
4.0,Just not a great fix but it is very pretty an d elegant in looks.
4.0,"I really like this blouse. I initially had trouble finding bottoms that matched well, but I think a cute, plaid skirt works best considering the style of the blouse. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box to see the blouse and tie were individually wrapped in a zippered pouch. I love that! It kept the blouse clean, and smelling fresh and new. The size is nearly perfect, with the exception of a slight gap in the chest region when I move my arms too much. I normally order a size small in t-shirts and medium in blouses. I knew this blouse ran small so I ordered one size up and it fits well. Would definitely recommend to others."
4.0,"Love it,its perfect"
4.0,I ordered the gold.  I really like it but I have not worn it yet (I just got it this week) so  I can't say how it'll hold up.  The only drawback at this time is the post on the earrings (why I didn't give 5 stars).  It doesn't seem strong and one is wiggling so I'm wondering if it will break off.  I wear my hair over my ear on one side so for now I won't wear that one earing.  I think they would have been better as clip on earrings.
4.0,"It's a very nice enclosure.  Well built, easy to assemble & shipped in an uber sturdy double box.  I was leery as the price seems high for what it is but it's very nice.  If you're going to display something I would recommend this case."
4.0,Order next size up if you don't want a snug fit for this type of garment. The weight of the product is perfect though and it washs very well.
4.0,"I bought a 2XL for me and a Medium for my niece who is actually an XL youth size. The smallest they had left was medium so thats what I got her because she loves Tye dye.  I ended up giving the 2XL to my sister who is a large and the medium fit my niece perfectly. They are cute. Thin, good for summer ... I did expect thin, however expected not as thin as what I got. For the price I cant really complain to much they were on sale for $8 when I bought them. I did miss the fact that there is no pocket - that was my fault - just letting everyone else know so if you want a pocket maybe not the shirt for you.<br />It is a really nice length and just for reference I was able to put the 2XL on, it was just skin tight so I guess it depends on what you are looking for in reference to sizing. If you want it to fit like the photo, size up for sure."
4.0,Fit nicely in the waist but was a bit too long for my preference
4.0,I'm not sure about the fit because I purchased it for my 13 year old son for Christmas. I did not have too high an expectation because of the price. It came today and I am shocked by the quality. The stitching is good. It isnt some thin jersey. It is actually quite nice for the cost!
4.0,"The victory shirt was really nice and well made, but it was too big. I had to mail it back, which I had to pay for. They didn't have another one in the size I needed, so I ended up ordering it somewhere else. Have ordered a lot of things from Amazon and have been happy with everything else."
4.0,"This spray actually works!  I have not been able to find a Covid mask that fits right enough that doesn't fog my glasses.  This stuff is pricy, but it actually does what it says.  Imm ordering the three oack"
4.0,"I told my son I  ordered it and his first words were, does it have a safety release in case it gets caught in something. I got it and no it doesn't. Now since I work in an office I don't think it will be a problem but for him working with heavy equipment running a fork lift it could possibly be a hazzard.<br />Other than that it seems well made."
4.0,I really like it fits my Galaxy S8 phone with a thin case and all my card. I wish it had a wrist band though
4.0,"Great Product a neat little key-chain eye-catcher, planning on getting more for Xmas presents."
4.0,This was very surprising... the jacket fit about 95% and good enough to use for the party without alterations .
4.0,Size down where length is concerned. Arm length extremely long. Wish I could exchange for a medium but missed window of opportunity. Feel of fabric is great!
4.0,cheap material but very cool.  i bought 2 for my halloween party
4.0,"I got an XL for my daughter and it's a snug fit; 5'2"" 210lbs it's warm though and the color is beautiful, real soft. Just beware if you're a XL in plus sizes, it's a little snug."
4.0,very nice and comfortable. Ordering another. Love the comfortable fit and it doesn’t make my head hot
4.0,"Way more comfortable than those plastic straps and less likely to break. I would buy again, and would like even more if not made in china."
4.0,Nice fit and feel - good for driving and cold above 20 degrees.  Would not work for serious wind chill or below zero temps but find for my PA/NY/NJ locale.
4.0,comfortable but not thick enough...wear a mask underneath for protection
4.0,Good Support for flip flops
4.0,Quick delivery. Not high end quality but will do.
4.0,Seems to be solid. My daughter is keeping it in her backpack. No complaints so far and would buy again.
4.0,It's a beautiful watch that matches with a lot clothing. I have it 4 stars just because the materials that were made with this watch are decent. I'm pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"The seller contacted me and asked that I would rate this bag for a discount. I needed a bag to use everyday that would expand to carry the stuff for work and would be easy to close.  There are 2 magnetic closures - one set on the flap and 1 on each strap under the buckle. These make closing it easy as you are running out the door. This bag fits my little day purse, my kindle fire, the back up computer tape, and a some other stuff. It is a stylish brief case that will stay dry on a rainy day, nice heavy canvas. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little heavier in weight and can get a little heavy once it is filled.So one of the reasons I like it, is also the reason why I only gave it 4 stars. I would have given it 4 1/2 if that was possible."
4.0,"I got this for my neice in Germany where it rains all the time. I thought it was pretty cool.  I wouldn't have a need for one because I live in Texas and if it rains, I just stay home. I hope she will like it. Seems to have been well made."
4.0,It hits above the knee.
4.0,My son loves these glasses. They looked great and are comfortable. Great buy!
4.0,"Great, but not perfect, strap. It looks nice, but also looks and feels a bit cheap (which it is, and that is why I bought it). Wonderful value. Would buy again."
4.0,"I love the color and fit of this dress! It is comfortable, the pattern is lovely, and the fit is flattering. However, I am docking a star because it fades and starts to pill pretty quickly. I noticed it after a single delicate wash. I'll still wear the dress, but I find that annoying."
4.0,Im a new referee.  Runs a little on the small side. So far shirt is holding up.
4.0,"I love the design and the set, however, I will have to put a new clasp on it because the clasp does not open.<br />Will take it to jewelers as it will take forever to return and exchange, not worth the effort. I love the product just wish that<br />it was wearable."
4.0,"The product is, as advertised. It's made in China and has a velcro adjustable strap at the back of the hat. It's a &#34;one size fits most&#34; product and it's accurate. I have a big head and while it fits, it looks a bit small on me, so I'll keep it as novelty item. Overall, it's a solid hat...good stitching, good quality materials."
4.0,"I noticed a friend with a pair on, we place racquetball and paddleball in NYC together. He mentioned he got them on Amazon. The shoe is a little wider than I expected, but I have used them to play paddleball/racquetball and the shoe is comfortable."
4.0,This dress was a little bigger than expected and the material is not the best but for the price I WONT complain. The colors are very bright just like the picture. I added a belt to dress it up!
4.0,"Size runs small, shipment takes a little time so plan ahead. That said, it was a decent quality dress."
4.0,"Looks good well made , maybe add a zipper on one pocket!"
4.0,"Fits as advertised. Too high waisted for my liking so I returned. BUT, not see through, VERY comfortable.  Tried really hard to get used to fitting above my navel and just couldn’t do it. If you’re good with that these will be great for you. I’m 5’6” 150 size 30” jeans and got a lg. Fit good"
4.0,Didn't know Ben was unfinished
4.0,"Great design and the material is very friendly to my sensitive ears. After a few months of intermittently wearing them, the metal has started to oxidize in some places, but in general they look and feel great!"
4.0,"Great looking watch. Just beware, the links cannot be removed. Great for the price. Looks like a $100 watch."
4.0,"I purchase 2 of these necklaces for my son and his friend that were in the police academy. They both loved them. Although my son's neck was breaking out from the chain, in which he has in the past from certain metals. I puchased a black cord for him to put the medal on and it looks great. He wears it everyday. So my advise is if you are sensitive to medals, buy a different chain/cord. The medal looks as good today as the day I purchased them."
4.0,These glasses were OK. The lens were a little loose but that is to be expected from a non-name brand product. Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase.
4.0,"Band really makes the Ionic a classy watch that fits my modern suit.<br /><br />The watchband tool to adjust the band is easy enough to use, but feels flimsy and I don't trust it will handle many uses."
4.0,Good medium sized duffle bag for workouts. My daughter actually uses hers for carrying her dance gear/shoes so the bottom-zipped pouch is convenient for storing sweaty shoes without stinking up the main compartment!
4.0,The size was perfect and they are too sexy on my hands
4.0,"The size was smaller than I had thought, but this has all functions I need."
4.0,"This was my 2nd time purchashing these for my hubby.  This style/brand is one of his favs. He complains about similar underwear styles riding up. When the underwear's content is primarily cotton with a touch of spandex, they don't ride up. He fluctuates from a 30""-33"" and he wears these in a medium comfortably.<br />The first time we order these underwear we got 2 cool colors, but the second time we didn't. We received 4 different random boring colors; navy, gray and 2 variations of black. That was a bummer. Other than that they are an affordable quality product."
4.0,It’s slightly smaller than I expected but it’s a great size and my sister is going to love it. Decent sized chain.
4.0,it needs longer straps
4.0,"Love the feel, and style BUT they stretch out soon after putting them on. So much so I have to keep tugging them up all day. I like them enough I will probably order another pair in smaller size to allow for excess stretch."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised with quality and style!  Would look cute with white turtleneck!
4.0,The person who received this gift liked it and said it was like one she had when she was young.
4.0,A little too see through to cover tattoos but a good size.
4.0,Delicate.love it love it
4.0,"The necklace was delivered on day and pretty much the same as I expected except the size of the crystal, but i'm saying the size is better then I thought, not to big to make this necklace to look old fashion. Would be a great gift, appreciated."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in a large. I’m 5’4, currently 146lbs, 37/31/42. This dress fit smaller in the hips and waist than my other size L dress in this brand. It’s comfortable and a quality material. The only things I don’t love about it is the sleeves (they “poof” out a bit from the shoulders) and the bottom hem (seems to bell out a bit at the bottom of the dress which is less than flattering). A dress similar to this one is sold online by other sellers that do not sew the top completely together (it’s a single stitch keeping the chest wrap portion together) and I’m happy to report that this top is fully sewn at the wrap-seam in the chest. This dress will do, but I’m not excited to buy it in another color so it’ll be just this one for me."
4.0,"Arrived  quick enough It gets noticed and I get compliments on it very nice,  Friend  liked it so I got one for her for Christmas"
4.0,I was very empressed with the quality. The chain is very delicate. The color is very bright. I gave it as a gift.
4.0,rings are simple. I added them to a band on each side. Looks nice. I have lost a stone in one of the rings after about 2 days of wear. Sellers where great to do business with
4.0,"a gift for my young niece, a very petite bracelet, more for a younger person than a woman, in my opinion"
4.0,"I ordered one for and for my granddaughter, I misplaced one so I didn't get one,but it was to small for an adult I have small wrist s and it barely fit."
4.0,"The grey is inferior material to the white and black , very odd"
4.0,The top was very cute BUT it came without the belt....
4.0,"I like how it fits, and the good jean material. But wish it wasn't so long (I'm 5'3) and I thought it might be slimmer from the knee to the foot. Very hard to find Women's construction work clothes. Still I'm glad that product exists."
4.0,"Seriously, I mean it: these pants are AWESOME!  The quality is really nice.  The seams were sewn well, & the fabric is great.  For the price I expected those to be lacking, but they wern't.<br /><br />My son said they are very comfortable.  He has been lounging most of the day in them.  I was most impressed with how nice they looked.  They are more form fitting than typical sweatpants.  These could be worn around town, & not just at home or during my boys sporting practices.<br /><br />There was one issue I saw, though.  They fit a tad small.  My son, whom you see in these pictures, wears a size 32x30.  I ordered these pants in an XL hoping to have them a tad baggy, but as you can see, that was not how it happened.<br /><br />So all in all, a rating of 4 stars.  While I receved these pants at a discount in exchange for a review, I will be ordering a second & third pair at full price for my other boys."
4.0,I got a size medium for my 15 lb. terrier/chihuahua mix. Loved the shirts. They’re a little big on the legs and not easy to walk with. But The material is great and They look great too!
4.0,"A little small, but I can wear it."
4.0,nice light weight hoodie good graphics!
4.0,Great slim but protective case... love the textured back for grip. Need more colors though!
4.0,"The lace in this is perfect - it's not too bumpy so you can wear it under thinner shirts without it showing through. It's stretchy, but the sizing runs pretty small. I'm a medium in basically every brand I buy, but i bought a large in this based on reviews. It fits perfectly on its own, but I also like to be able to take the padding out and wear it over a regular bra, and it's too tight to do that. Overall very happy with it and will purchase more colors, but beware of sizing."
4.0,Fits a little small. Great color!
4.0,"nice, easy to wear dress that is great for fall weather. fabric a little see through so need to wear a dark camisole or slip underneath."
4.0,"I like them a lot.  But, they will shed glitter into a school carpet for circle time,  so just be aware of that"
4.0,"Probably will only get a few wears in as these are cheaply made (gold paint was already chipped when I got them) but what did I expect at this price? They are a nice accent I didn't pay much for, so four stars."
4.0,I understand that this is a beach coverup but I was still surprised to see the fit on myself. I have rather large breasts and this coverup didn't cover up much on the top. The length was very good and the overall fit was very loose and comfy fitting. I'm lucky enough to have my bathing suit cover my top area and the coverup just adds a pop of color to my swim suit.<br /><br /> I received this item at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and truthful review of the product
4.0,Love it and great for traveling
4.0,"Runs small, but it looks good on."
4.0,"You get what you pay for,  to you negative people!!!! I have ordered many things from Amazon, always worth what I paid for, fast shipping and quality merchandise...  What would you expect for the money.....??????"
4.0,"Nicely designed,<br />Looks very neat and nice<br />Wife liked this product so much<br />Will be willing to get the same/similar product again."
4.0,Happy with the fit but the pattern on the socks was not the one I ordered. Since they fit my 17.5&#34; calf I will keep them and try for another better pattern next time.  Hard to find compression socks that fit me. Please be careful when filling orders.
4.0,"I really like this outfit, but the measurements that are listed are a bit misleading. The strap that fits around your waist doesn't have much stretch to it, so it needs to be large enough to fit over your hips which can be a problem with you have a big bottom. Otherwise I love it, especially the cuffs."
4.0,"A little shorter than I expected, but they perform well."
4.0,"These have a very dark matte tortoise color. The lenses, too, are dark and so they just work nicely together. I think they look a bit 80’s, having lived through the decade. I really like these!"
4.0,These are very cute and keep your ears warm but they are extremely itchy.
4.0,I'd give the short 5 stars but I haven't ridden with them yet. Otherwise the fit is good and they've held up after numerous sessions in the pool. The pocket is a nice touch.
4.0,They are larger as stated but I didn't expect that large more like a 3mo and up size.
4.0,"The fit was a little oversize, it has a stretchy band inside.  Not what I would call the best.  The hat itself is made very well.  I use it for shooting trap, and it keeps the sun off my ears and neck."
4.0,These socks were given to each of the groomsmen and groom to wear on the wedding day. I really don't know what they would rate theses socks.
4.0,I got these socks did my mom because she stands on her feet all day and she absolutely loves them. I will be getting more for her since she loved these because of the fun colors and how they fit
4.0,This was great for my grandson. It was durable and good for the money.
4.0,Puggles and I loved the anchor design and when the collars showed up they were great quality! The faux leather was very smooth and soft so I know it won't chafe either of us. My only complaint is you must be careful when putting their tags on because the metal scratches just alittle bit
4.0,Soft and sturdy
4.0,Beautiful. Fits just right. Fabric is soft. :)
4.0,"This bag is really cute, but the quality is extremely poor.  My daughter used it twice, and on the third time, the zipper was completely broken.  Now it is useless as the zipper will not zip and stay zipped at all.<br /><br />Edit: After reaching out to the company, they were very quick to send me a new bag.  We have used it a few times and the zipper seems to be working much better.  Love the size of the bag and really appreciate the quick customer service."
4.0,works properly
4.0,"The fabric feels a little flimsy but overall it's a good shirt, comfortable and the size was as I expected it would be."
4.0,Very stylish and warm but there was a strange fishy order when I got it so I washed it and got the smell out.
4.0,"these boots are beautiful. they are a touch narrow but thankfully I had a western and shoe repair shop and was able to stretch them a touch. now they fit perfect. if you are older as I am, I suggest you buy the boot pulls also."
4.0,"But it is too small for my face.  I need the bigger one, please!  wear it for fun and cool."
4.0,jacket runs extremely small in the arm circumference but way too long in length
4.0,"This jacket was sent to me in exchange for my honest review. I had hoped to have my boyfriend wear this. He normally wears a size medium in American clothing, so that's what I ordered, only to find it far too small. The quality is nice, however, and I love how the light gray portion is reflective. I would recommend this but advise you to size up."
4.0,"These are going to be Christmas gift, so in all honesty I won't know how they'll be until next summer, but from what I can see just by looking at them, they look like a really great product."
4.0,"The mask is very comfortable. I had a music lesson today, & I found it easier to sing/breathe when wearing it, unlike standard medical masks which make taking deep breaths difficult.<br />I washed it in the laundry, but it still has a bit of a chemical smell. I will wash it again. It did not come w/ washing instructions, unless that's what's on the little piece of paper that came in the package; I assume that's a receipt, but it's in Chinese. Someone at my old office will be able to read it for me.<br />I wish there were information on how well the mask protects the wearer & others from spreading or being exposed to the virus."
4.0,I really liked the look of this product however each individual loop is slightly opened and kept getting caught in my hair.
4.0,I liked the softness. Good stretch washes up well. A little shorter than the typical size I went with a 7 in girls should have ordered an 8. My granddaughter is very slim and the waistband fits well.
4.0,They fit but im glad i got the largest size because they are a little small
4.0,"This runs a little small, but it was a great Halloween costume for my kid and she could wear it after."
4.0,Arrived on time and these CZ earring sparkle so bright they put my real diamonds to shame. I ordered a smaller size because I was looking for something dainty and I'm in love with the way the stone is cut.
4.0,"5'2&#34; 130lbs, usually a medium. Had to return and order a large so it wouldn't dig into the hips. Large fit fine if you plan on activities. We bought other colors in XL for lounging around. Those might slip down of cliff diving or something. Great quality, good material."
4.0,"I loved it, but I just wanted my boobs to be higher up. I would wear it again, though!"
4.0,"Me agrado mucho el leggins!! lo único es que compre de acuerdo a la tabla de tallas, y estoy en lo escogido, pero me quedo un tanto ajustado, me habría encantado en un poco menos, a la próxima comprare una talla mas!!"
4.0,It’s literally elastic which is good when u need a bit more room plus there are no pre cut holes you can latch the belt anywhere  it’s hard to put cell phone cases onto it though.
4.0,"it is a pretty good pack, although it smells bad."
4.0,Product as described. Very nice band. Fits my small wrist well. Not too loose. Dressed up my Apple Watch beautifully. Love it<br /><br />Just received so will update about lasting quality of materials.
4.0,"Living on the coast means storms move in quickly. These ponchos will help keep me prepared when the weather moves in. These are decent quality, better than the ones we got from a dollar store, and they are easy to put on. These keep you dry in an emergency, they're not meant to be kept forever so they can rip easily, but do their job well. These do not have full sleeves, they're 3/4 sleeves so you won't have to constantly pull it up while working. These also aren't full length, meaning they're not going to you feet, but again you're not going to trip while working. I was sent this item at a discount in exchange for this review."
4.0,"I love this dress, super cute. I ordered an XL, it's a little tight in the bust(wear 42D), fits good at the waist(fyi waist part is not very stretchy), hangs just above the knee. And it has pockets!"
4.0,The high waist is comfortable with good coverage and the material is thick without being heavy. They are not compression so the fit is not as snug but they are comfortable and move well.
4.0,Three words. Worth the money.
4.0,It is cute on I’m 5 ft and weigh 120 I got a small. The only thing is it doesnt look exactly like pic. It’s hard to explain but I was hoping the arm part would look more like the picture real loose but there’s more fabric that covers that part so it’s not the same look.
4.0,The necklace is great for the price! It's difficult to review this product considering I wore it in the Bahamas at the beach. By the time I got back to the hotel it was tarnished from getting into the water. Good buy just don't get it wet!
4.0,These are not for you if you are a well defined person
4.0,Wear it everywhere fits perfectly
4.0,"Product was good. It didn't wow me, but it was okay. Just wasn't in love for my body type. Maybe if you were super skinny - the ruffles at the bottom wasn't my fav."
4.0,wanted 2 specific colors not 2 same but very comfy
4.0,"Liked the pants but the size was not right, Fabric was bit stiff. had to return."
4.0,"These were a little tighter than his last pair. Same shoe, different color.  My son plays on 3 comp teams, all high school aged. His last pair lasted about 4 months before the glue separated from the bottom due to hot turf. About 30 - 40 games out of them, plus practices 3 days a week.  Hoping we get around the same from these. If not, I will update."
4.0,"I really like this piece, just a little smaller than I thought."
4.0,Lots of organization. Everything in one place. Won't always need to carry a pocketbook.
4.0,I did not realize that this the brand that is always at Costco so I'm not sure if it was a deal or not. Probably about the same price as if you bought it from Costco. My 11 year old son likes them. He is skinny so they are a little loose on him but he will wear them eventually.
4.0,"So after reading lot's of reviews about this shirt I wanted it bad!!! And there were lot's of reviews about the size of the men that the shirt was bought for and they pretty much matched my husbands size and build. So I went ahead and ordered a x-large. WAY TO BIG. The shirt was like a tent!! I don't get it he's 6foot medium built, dunno his weight but not a really big dude. So when I went on here to exchange for a large it was sold out ;0( I had to return and order the same shirt from a different company and pay more and a different color. Not happy but not mad. was shipped on time."
4.0,"I really like this dress.  I normally wear a 2XL but got this in a 3 and  it fits great. I have to wear a badge around my neck for work,  and it did get a little fuzz bally wear my badge rubbed after one day but other than that it is great.  Also have to mention the pockets are perfect!"
4.0,It does help with my snoring I always forget to put it on.  I would wear a mouth hard because it keeps everything Otomi Jong and in place.  It is about as comfy as I would expect it to be while sleeping.  I got this promising a review
4.0,Loved the quality and will take it to a streemstress to fit accordingly
4.0,The dress is just ok. Nothing special. Not bad quality. Maybe too loose for me.
4.0,"The hat fits great, the front bill is too long."
4.0,will be able to use w/ long top/jacket...waistline not the most flattering with the elastic  very comfy
4.0,Follow the size chart and you'll be fine! Beautiful look and really comfortable.
4.0,My daughter loves the fact that these light up! They are a fun shoe for school and go with everything.
4.0,"I love these but keep in mind I’ve never had ice fishing bibs before. They are very warm but the waist is draftier than my regular carhartts. Keep in mind this was noticed walking my dog at about 2 degrees with a medium weight coat on the inside of the bibs for some testing, but the cut is definitely a bit lower than a lot of bibs.<br /><br />The waterproof and padding is great and I love the pockets. I was out on the ice with these on a 5 degree day and had no complaints—hardly had the heater on in an insulated 2 man flip over solo.<br /><br />Main thing I wanted to point out is the large reflective “STRIKEMASTER” logo printed down each leg. It’s a bit much and not mentioned in the photos provided.<br /><br />It’s a bit tacky and I feel like a nascar driver. This is why I give 4/5 stars.<br /><br />$100 less than 90% of bibs out there so shoutout to my sponsor, Strikemaster.<br /><br />I have a 34” inseam and these worked well. I am a 34 waist and 46 chest/shoulder. I had plenty of room in all regards but wasn’t swimming in it. Adjustable cuffs should work for a 30” inseam all the way up to a 36”.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
4.0,The material is excellent quality! Only problem was with drawstring waist! He pulled string to tie and it came out in his hand and had broken in half! The material washes well and colors stay true!
4.0,"I really liked this dress, and the simple but elegant detailing at the hem make it an excellent choice. Unfortunately I bought it along with a few others in the same color and it was not the favorite of people I polled, but I definitely really liked it!"
4.0,"I’m sure this is sized to match the Apple ‘medium,’ but I wish you could order in large. It fits fine, but you have to be very careful when putting it on or taking it off to keep the free end from bashing into the watch housing if you have a bit of a bigger hand."
4.0,"Son likes shirt.  A bit too big, but he'll grow into it."
4.0,Ordered a large. I’m 5’2 so the dress fit me a little closer to my knee then mid thigh. It fits really snug around the waist and arms. Dress was nice for price but stitching started coming out after first wash. I definitely sugguest the gentle washing cycle be used for this dress.
4.0,Material was a little scratchy but other than that a great price for a cute dress!
4.0,Causal cover
4.0,"Only thing I’m not crazy about is the dual time zone but being so sensitive, I’m constantly having to return it to my primary time."
4.0,its a nice priced solar/ light powered watch
4.0,"Like these for quick protection, have better ones for coverage, but I ould buy again."
4.0,"I like this dress. The color is bright. I purchased the green flower one. The only thing I don't really like is the material, it's taffeta. Taffeta doesn't breath well in the heat of Florida.  I'm 5'5"" and 125 lbs and I purchased a medium and it fits a tiny bit loose. However, this material does NOT stretch at all, so any smaller wouldn't work well."
4.0,Love it! My new favorite bag!
4.0,one size up and it fits great. Stylish and comfortable!
4.0,"I really loved this dress when I first got it, but after wearing it just two times I’ve realized the fabric is pretty cheap - it pills easily and I already have two small holes. In the future I’ll make sure to hang dry it and would suggest doing the same!"
4.0,"Odd smell. Otherwise as expected. This item was not purchased for every day use, so I cannot rate its durability."
4.0,It's the same as shown in pictures I like it the only thing is kind of difficult to get the ID from the  ID pocket
4.0,Fit great. Cute shirt
4.0,It fits great. Fabric was pleasantly thicker than expected. I bought a blue in size large.
4.0,"We original bought this in a small, after verifying measurements with the size chart.  The product came and it was WAY too big.  We had to return it and get an extra small.  The XS fits good and the product is nice."
4.0,Cute socks!  Somewhat thin though.
4.0,Only reason I deducted a star was because I got two boy headbands instead of a boy and a girl.
4.0,"I am using these gloves for propelling myself in my wheelchair and not for biking.  These have done very well I  and they have protected my hands from dirt and wall scrapes and lets me have a pretty good grip.  They seem to be made okish for my use, though a couple of top finger are comming apart but for the price I think they will last for a while even with the wearing.  I'm 5 foot 8 inches and around 110 so have fairly thin wrists and I thin fingers but the glove size I got fits a tiny bit large but not a lot."
4.0,"I sized up one, but should have ordered my normal size. This is a nice, lightweight jacket and is generously sized. I am 5’1”, 135 pounds with an athletic build. I generally  wear a small or 2/4. If there’s a question about size, I tend to size up. I like this jacket a lot and am keeping it, but wish that I had purchased my normal size."
4.0,They make me smile Every time I see them. Cute socks! Pretty Good quality
4.0,Fit well but it is a little too long.
4.0,These came in earlier and are very cute! One of the rhinestones was already missing but that's not that visible. They're adorable butterfly earrings. ❤️ them! Obsessed with stud earrings! Glad I got those and soo cheap!
4.0,"Beautiful bag, lovely color and quality. But too small for my needs."
4.0,"I bought an Elite Sports ultra light weight gi to have as a backup uniform. The material is lighter weight, but the construction is sturdy and durable.  After several washes, the material does seem to be color fast. The drawback is that is does seem to size small. My BJJ gi is an A1. Which is what I chose for the Elite. It fits. but it fits small. The price was perfect, just remember to order one size up."
4.0,Shoulder pads a lil funky but wearable…
4.0,I couldn't believe that when I tried the pant on it had to be 3 sizes too small.  I ordered a size 12 (my normal size).  Seriously it must of been a size 6-8 .  Too bad because the material was good quality and  was the style I was looking for.
4.0,"I am petite, It looked beautiful but it didn't fit me well."
4.0,The dress is beautiful wish it didn’t have to lay flat. To dry.  Must be very careful but in the end so so which I really dislike butit looks very pretty after washing and ironing !  Going to wear it for romantic getaway with my hubby.
4.0,"the skirt is a slightly weird material, but still a cute outfit"
4.0,"Nice sunglasses for the price, I like them"
4.0,So Soft on my nethers... So very soft
4.0,I love it. 👍🏽😻
4.0,"like it a lot,, but tight in the chest."
4.0,"I love the top but it to big ,I need a large size.  I need to return it . Can u gave me call plz"
4.0,"Loved the shirt, but the sleeves are cut too narrow for comfort when wearing a shirt underneath it. I bought it to wear as a lightweight jacket. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 115 lbs. and ordered a small. A medium would be too large. The color is more faded and not as bright as the picture. The quality is excellent, and the fleece lining is substantially heavy. I wish it had fit, but unfortunately, I had to return it."
4.0,My favorite part about this is the chest clip. I wish it was just a little bit bigger. It is not big enough to hold a folder or clip board in it. It is made of very sturdy material. Perfect size from my soon to be six year old.
4.0,Worked well for busy men in our lives
4.0,"I have thick thighs, there was a tiny bit of the muffin top affect going on around my thigh once socks where pulled all the way up. Other than that they are cute. Gave them to a friend with smaller legs though. She wears them constantly and says they are very comfy!"
4.0,"Exactly as described. Arrived on time. Nice material. Somewhat lightweight, which I like because it's not too bulky. I thought it was a little see-through at first, but when you loop it around, you can't tell."
4.0,It's good with dress.
4.0,"I wish they were a bit bigger and lighter. I got these for Halloween to wear as a hippie and plan on wearing after as normal sunglasses of course but, sometimes it looks a bit funky. They were smaller than I thought. Look like a blind mouse with them on🤣 the lenses are really dark too. Like ik they’re sunglasses but jeez!"
4.0,Gorgeous dress but runs way too large. Order at least 1 size smaller than normal if not two. I ended up giving this dress away  to my mom because I ordered a large and it fit more like an xl or 2xl. She looks great in it though!
4.0,"Socks are great which is why I have purchased the body glove brand so many times HOWEVER, I am disappointed that the picture is misleading. These are WHITE socks not gray as the picture leads you to believe"
4.0,MATERIAL KIND OF THIN.
4.0,"I have two pairs of these - one for reading and one for use with laptop. Both with black frame. They are very comfortable. The frames have held up fine for me but would probably break if twisted or overly flexed. Not the best readers to carry around unprotected in your shirt pocket or purse. The lenses are uncoated plastic, so must be cleaned carefully and kept in case or they will scratch. The case is very sturdy, but a little fussy to close at times. I can get prescription glasses at a discount, but still like these for a inexpensive and practical pair of reading glasses. Am just now buying a stronger pair to use for reading in bed."
4.0,It fits pretty true to size I would still order one size larger because it's a little tighter than expected. I'm 34D and I got a large and it's a little too small so I would reccomend getting XL
4.0,Loved them but... they are missing the antislippers on the bottom of the feet...thats why i gave them 4 stars instead of 5.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift. I bought a medium that fits more like a small, thankfully my friend was still able to wear it. This company is a great company though."
4.0,"I bought 3 of these to work in the covid units, to protect my hair. I usually sweat easily from head and forehead, but this caps lets your scalp breathe and keeps your hair clean. They're also very comfortable.  This was my 1st time using caps. I'm actually very pleased"
4.0,They should make different sizes. But I love the convenience of this product. I mainly uses it after showering. Cool material is differently a plus and breathable. Just wish it came in a larger size.
4.0,"Beautiful! Only thing about this is that the symbol on the outside does not have a black background so you will be able to see the photo through it and does not have a glass to protect the picture, so do not recommend showering with it otherwise the photo can get ruined. But other than that this does not rust and looks great!"
4.0,"I thought it was cute in the picture, but once received, I didn’t care for it. Just not my style. I wear on occasion. Would look great on others."
4.0,"These are gorgeous! One of the two I ordered came broken - one of the chains detached. It's an easy fix with jewelry pliers. I responded to the seller's email informing them, and they replied within 24 hour."
4.0,"I'm 5'6"" &163 pounds ordered a large but could have gotten a medium. Received tons of compliments."
4.0,This was sexy with some stretch. Thankful for the drape in the front since it covers my mommy pouch and keeps me feeling confident.
4.0,Too lńg
4.0,Dressing the kids up for the elderly
4.0,It works just as advertised.
4.0,"Soft fabric and a pretty color, but order up a size if you want it a bit roomier."
4.0,I liked these! I bought them for a charity event for a group of hunter/fisherman etc. I made beef jerky packets and filled these bins up to raffle off for charity. They were a huge hit!
4.0,The necklace was very nice. The deer was bigger then I thought. I enjoy it
4.0,"It's a great value for the money and my only problem is the pentacle itself can cause some reactions and green on the skin. Other than that, no negative energy, easy to open packaging, and very beautiful and durable."
4.0,They loved it.  Although I wished it would have been a bit more plushy.
4.0,"Good stuff, smells good as well."
4.0,"Not sure her mom will let her wear it out of the house, but it is so cute. She will look great and can wear it with shorts or jeans. I like that it has the shelf bra. It also compresses well. Makes your shape look better. Overall, a nice top with lots of potential for more than just exercising"
4.0,"Wonderfully Soft. Ordered a small but they were kinda big for an adult sized small, the drawstring helps though...warm enough for fall and winter..long enough to not flood and did not shrink or shed when washed."
4.0,The girlfriend loves it!<br />You're getting the quality that you pay for.<br /><br />Enjoy.
4.0,I usually wear a size 8 and the small fit just right. This is a very lightweight wicking top perfect for running.
4.0,"These are beautiful, elegant and small.  I thought they would be larger as they are about the size of a dime."
4.0,Quality is okay.  Would never pay more than $25 for this.  Appreciate the easy return policy!!
4.0,As expected. Good socks.
4.0,"It was better than I expected! the perfect ""add on"" to any Mans gift!"
4.0,"Very nice dress for the price. Fits as expected. I'm 4'11 &amp; 115lbs, size 6, and 32DD - I ordered a small. It of course a tiny bit long on me but nothing 1-2 inch heels can't fix. However, I received what must have been a return because it had deodorant stains (or what I hope is deordorant) all over it. Nothing I can't wash off but still kind of gross. Totally would have given this 5 stars if not for that."
4.0,Very very cute! Much smaller than I expected.
4.0,"I'm 5'5 and weight 140. I ordred a Medium and it fit slightly looser than I would have liked, but I prefer my shirts a bit snug. The fabric is soft and thick so it is a great shirt for a breezy day. I have had this shirt for a few months now and after a few washes it is still in great condition. I have ordred other shirts from this brand and continue to be pleased with the clothing."
4.0,The earrings are really nice. It would have been nice for them to come in a box instead on a small plastic Ziploc bag.
4.0,"Seemed snug when I tried it on. I never dry casual dresses in the dryer. This should never, ever go in the dryer, even on light dry cycle.  May have to pass it down to a smaller person. We will see after the first washing. Like the style and color. Fabric feels nice."
4.0,My son is in high school and loves these soccer shoes.  He said he didn't realize how bad his other shoes were until he tried these on.  They are light and he feels like he has much more support when changing directions quickly...
4.0,"The bra fit perfectly, very sexy. The panties were too small tho"
4.0,Beautiful scarf! Happy that I bought it. Delivery took a lot longer then I thought but it's okay.
4.0,Too big for shirt pocket though
4.0,"Pretty, lightweight earrings.  A nice touch of sparkle for dress or casual wear."
4.0,These bras are pretty supportive of my 38D self. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the pads fall out in the washer (didn't realize they even had pads when I ordered them) and the covering that makes it easier to put the pads back in seems to come off pretty easily.
4.0,"I was dubious of these because there are so many cheap Chinese knock-offs out there. I only took the gamble on these because of Amazon's solid return policy. As it turns out, they are decent. They juuuuuuuust about fit the same as my actual Oakley lenses that came with my Radarlocks. The overall lens quality is about what you'd expect for an off market replacement lens - not as heavy and solid feeling as the real thing, but not necessarily a bad thing when they're on your face.<br /><br />The photochromic part of it works as advertised, and the transition is just as quick as my Tifosi glasses that I use for mountain biking (I got these lenses for my road shades). Time will tell how they hold up to scratches and drops, but I am middle-of-the-road optimistic about them. if I get three seasons out of these I'll consider them money well spent.<br /><br />They do fit real Oakley frames, and overall lens quality is decent. Worth a shot if you're looking for the same thing."
4.0,Very cute and fits just right I wear about size 10 but think it would also fit a small to med 12 nicely.
4.0,Got the 6 to 12 months it fits but the opening isn't stretchy enough
4.0,Watch and as posted but scratchy and took awhile to come in.
4.0,I have been looking for Hockey Charms for a long time and...finally!!  Thanks!
4.0,A bit to big but i still love it.
4.0,Really soft and comfortable. Perfect length and I'm only 5' tall.
4.0,"I love the jacket,  yet was prepared for fit from previous reviews.<br />It does run very small<br />I usually wear a large but ordered a XXL<br />And it could be bigger<br />But it’s a cute holiday item!"
4.0,Very nice watch for the money . Would make a excellent gift for a young man. I like tke the band clasp. The only reason I didn't give 5 Stars is because the watch does not have a second counting hand. I collect watches for sport. This was a deviation from what I normally buy. However I will purchase more.
4.0,"Great socks for running. Didn't solve my blister problem, but I will continue to buy and use these for running."
4.0,"Love the shirt, wish I had bought a size bigger.  Not as long as the picture.  5'6&#34; 140lbs"
4.0,This is a nice jacket and very comfortable. The merlot/wine color is definitely more of a brighter wine color.
4.0,"Bought these dresses for bridesmaids. Everyone loved them. Super comfy and super cute. A really nice dress, especially for the price. Seem to fit as expected."
4.0,Loved the soft lining on slippers
4.0,"Drapes well. It is cheaply made- unfinished edges, thin fabric- but I expected that for $10. Nice and light for warmer weather."
4.0,Doesnt keep your hands as warm as Id wish but it does work and its great quality
4.0,It's ok for what it cost not bad
4.0,"I wanted a bat-wing shirt, that appeared to be a little heavier, but it was sold out, after I placed my order. This is still lovely, I use a cotton turtle neck under it for warmth if needed."
4.0,Purchased for my wedding. They are a great concept but do not fit my ear that well as other reviews mentioned (would be better with a second clasp). I will keep them to wear with another outfit.
4.0,"I've had this bag for 2 years now and use it every single day. Just recently the strap started to come apart a bit but since this has lasted me 2 years, I will purchase again. Everyrhing else is still 100% intact including the inside which is usually the first part to go!"
4.0,"Nice looking watch winder, Compact for 1 watch.  Space is too tight for a large dace watch 45mm.  Runs with AC or battery.  Black Metal"
4.0,Beautiful dress. I got it for my wife for our daughters wedding.  So many compliments. We were the best dressed couple there...
4.0,"I love these leggings, they fit perfect and so soft and comfortable.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 145lbs and a small fit perfect"
4.0,These were at least a half size too small.
4.0,This set is so cute. The material is so soft. Fits true to size.
4.0,I like the pattern and it's durable.
4.0,Y’all must have big noses bc mine slipped in easily. But there’s so much extra wire at the bottom of my nose... maybe I should plier it into the shape I want....<br />(Photo hopefully soon but it’s not in atm a different one is)<br />Either way I do love this it’s unique and edgy!!<br />BUY!
4.0,It was bigger than expected.....not the products fault.....I must have missed the small print.....very pretty.
4.0,"This is really cute, I was worried I wouldn't like it.  I did order the black with feathers, in the same size XL when it came it was huge.<br />had to send it back.  I don't know what was up with that."
4.0,Size Runs small. Order 1 up
4.0,"Super soft, good quality. Way larger than I thought. I believe the sizes are measured by the product lying flat, not by measurements around your body."
4.0,"So far, I love most  things about the watch. It is a little too large in diameter for me, however, it isn't flashy.<br /><br />There are three ways to tell the time - a) digital, b) analogue, c) via the tri-circle clock at the top of the watch.<br /><br />Two other things I like about this watch is the ease of use as well as the digital part lights up.<br /><br />The blue strap is nice, but I prefer rubber or silicone straps.<br /><br />Will have to wait and see how it stands up to everyday use."
4.0,I used these for a year. Sometimes I'd lose one when I was sleeping.
4.0,Came from China which I didn't realize. Good overall except the belt buckle was a little off on angle. Like it was clamped on off center but can't tell when on. Worth the price though..
4.0,"love product, just did not fit my foot"
4.0,Arrived on time and it’s super cute! The only draw back is that I wished it was a little more stretchy. Still super cute!
4.0,"I like the outfit, but the material is thin.  You will need a cardigan to make it appropriate for work.  For everyday wear, you will need a long tank top that covers down to your but because it the material is very sheer."
4.0,Light weight and good looking.
4.0,love the organization.  you get what you pay for.  keep it dry
4.0,"For the price, these are great. The frame is so thin, it's really flimsy. Keep in mind you can't expect Maui Jim quality at this price. No complaints here."
4.0,"This keyring with charm could be given/gifted to male or female. The keyring is solid, glossy silver and complements the solid silvery charm. The Inscription's mix of capital letters, in a non-serif font, for STRONG, and use of cursive and lower case letters for the rest of the phrase emphasizes the two aspects. This charm could serve as motivation, as well as being inspirational. Strength is not only physical, but mental, emotional and spiritual, too.<br />The card that comes inside the box is a nicely designed touch, with the barbell illustration accenting the concept of strength.<br />I've attached some photos, to show real world images of the presentation box and packaging. Also a ruler is shown to provide size reference.<br />As shown in these photos, the packaging shows the concern about the appearance of the product. I could find no defect or flaw in the manufacture or design.<br />I would give a 'strong' recommendation for this beautiful keyring/charm."
4.0,Love this dress! This by far my favorite dress that I own now. Love that the color is a emerald green. The quality of the dress is great. I had to steam the dress once I got it due to all the wrinkles that it had but once I got all those out it looks so pretty. The dress fit me great wasn't tight .
4.0,It's not a bad quality lapel pin flowers. But it wasn't the greatest thing ever. So I guess it's worth it.
4.0,"So I love the peach color of these leggings, but alas, they're a little too big for me in places.<br />I'm thinking they might be too long - see how they scrunch and there's extra fabric at the back of the knees?<br />The tummy area is also kind of loose.<br />I usually wear a size large though, so I was surprised that these turned out to be loose on me.<br /><br />On the upside, they're super soft and buttery feeling.. color is fantastic and unique!<br /><br />Here are my measurements for reference:<br /><br />5'3, 140 pounds<br />Waist: 28""<br />Hips: 44""<br />Thighs: 25"" each"
4.0,"Several of the finger lights in the package I received didn't work.  Since the price was so good, I didn't bother returning.  They are a lot of fun though."
4.0,I like this shoe but I normally wear sizes 6.5 or 7 so I ordered a size 7 in this shoe which was slightly too small. It's a good comfy shoe otherwise.
4.0,Order 2 sizes up. Fits good ( I wanted a baggy fit ) denim is a little stiff
4.0,"I ended up returning these because I was looking for a high impact sports bra. The girls were just out of control on my run. :)<br />However, if I was just running errands for the day I know this would have been a perfect fit and very comfortable. Most likely I will buy them but it wasn't what I was looking for at this time."
4.0,"They're big!  I have a big face and these are just a wee bit larger than the average aviators, think Top Gun Tom Cruise + 1 cm.  Frame is about as sturdy as I expected, not indestructible but not flimsy.  Overall great price and actually polarized!"
4.0,"I expected they would be a little small.  I have to keep pulling them up over my tummy.  That said, they will work for how I wear them.."
4.0,"These are nice sports bras, but they run a full size smaller than the premium Nike sports bras. So, order a size larger than you would normally wear. Because of this size discrepency I rated them 4 out of 5 stars. I would buy more but availabilty isn't great!"
4.0,"Great for playing sports or working out. Its small, it does its job, and comfortable."
4.0,"Cute, lightweight- great for spring/summer. It does run small- I normally wear a medium and bought this in XL based on reviews- it was the right decision."
4.0,"Soft, warm and comfortable pajama bottoms"
4.0,"This is a good quality leather case.  It holds my two pairs of glasses - a rather large pair of sunglasses and my plastic mid-size prescription glasses.  I purchased this for a vacation to save myself the headache of juggling glass cases and hoping to save space.  This case does the trick.  It is as wide as my sunglass case but holds two pairs.  It is about 1 inch longer than my cases.  We will see how this holds up in travel since it is soft sided, i am hoping that it protects the glasses well."
4.0,I bought this sweater for my daughter and she loves it.
4.0,"The necklace is adorable and not bad quality but, when it came the chain was broken before I opened it. It was a really easy fix but it shouldn’t have been like that to begin with. But I love it and I get lots of compliments on it."
4.0,"Good for an emergency raincoat to leave in the car.  Pocket ripped immediately, so I don't think it will last more than a couple times."
4.0,"Be aware that they're shorter than the average pair of running shorts, so if you don't like showing too much thigh, these might not be for you. But they feel really good when running and look great. The pouch zips well, and is a good size for a small set of keys/key fob - although there's not much for sweat protection (personally, I sweat a lot when running, and keep my car's fob in a ziplock bag even if inside a belt/pouch). Because it's a combo pair of shorts, you can't pull up the ""shorts"" onto your stomach and have them ride higher than the underwear, so be aware of that if you like to pull one or the other up.<br /><br />It's a good pair of running shorts for runs of a few miles, I just wish the pouch had more sweat protection, and the waist was a little higher."
4.0,Really love this belt. It's a bit thin and the holes are closer together than usual belts. I really wish the whole belt was just a bit thicker. It's a bit small/thin in comparison to other belts in the leather area. That could have been a bit more &quot;masculine&quot; per say.
4.0,The neck cut out was a little small.
4.0,The quality wasn’t bad I expected it to be worse. It hides your belly perfectly and the dress is short! Omg I didn’t think it would be a few inches below by my butt. The picture looks longer but when you wear it please wear shorts or something to cover your lady parts. It’s not as loose in the front as the picture shows & you can def wear a bar underneath. I do love the color.
4.0,"The bag is really beautiful, smaller than expected, however. I thought to use it to carry my work laptop but I'll have to use it as a regular purse, instead. The downside is the absolutely horrendous smell, which hasn't dissipated since hanging it on a chair for four days. Like a mix of mothballs, burning rubber, and sharpie.  I have it tied in a pillowcase right now, marinating in lavender dryer sheets in hopes that will help, because the bag really is beautiful and I want to wear it out without causing people to clear rooms to avoid me due to the smell."
4.0,"These gaiters are a smidge snug on my nose.  After a while, they will smush my nose and make it hurt.  Also, the cut makes it so that if they are high enough to cover my nose, they are very close to my eyes and push on my glasses or make them slip.  Its a little strange - I do wear other gaiters and like them - it is something about these that are just a little odd.<br /><br />Otherwise, the fabric is very soft and comfortable on my skin.  The seams are straight and the edges are bound."
4.0,Good purchase. Cute.
4.0,Not the most flattering fit for my body type but it's made well enough. Comfy to wear and super patriotic whether you're going to a rave or the beach.
4.0,"First off I love these sweatshirts but I wish I could give them 3 different reviews.<br />I first bought the 'Red Space Dye' in 3X and I would have given this a 4☆ review. I normally wear a 2X but I read other reviews so I bought one size larger because I like my hoodies roomy. Let me tell you, there is NO give or stretch to this fabric. I like how it fits, the way it looks, and how soft the fabric is. I just wish it was a little stretchy.<br />Second I bought the 'Black Tie Dye' in 3X. I would have given this a 5☆ review hands down! I stayed with the same size because I liked how the last one fit. This one, however, is a completely different sweatshirt. I absolutely LOVE this sweatshirt! It fit the same and there's still not a lot of give/stretch to this fabric but there's more than the space dyed versions. The hood is different from that version also. It's huge! I read some reviews that didn't like how big and bulky the hood was and that it didn't lay down properly. I personally prefer a bigger hood. You just have to fold it to have it lay right. The dye pattern looks awesome! There's no inconsistencies with it. I loved this sweatshirt so much that I got another one.<br />Third, and lastly, I got the 'Red Tie Dye' in 3X. I would have given this a 3☆ review. The physical quality of this sweatshirt is the same as the other tie dye. The dye job is lacking though. The dye pattern is different which I didn't mind but you can see in the pictures that the black on the sleeves is much lighter than it is on the body. I love how dark the black is on the rest of the sweatshirt. I just wish the sleeves matched. Kind of a let down. I'm keeping it because I like how it fits. I wish it looked as good as it felt.<br />With these 3 different ratings, I just decided to take the average. Sorry this is such a long review but, if people read it, I hope it helps.<br />**I haven't washed these yet. When I do, if anything changes, I'll update my review."
4.0,The color grey is not grey more like light brown and too many threads on the clothes.
4.0,"This is a nice skirt, i like it, i think that this should not be labeled as one size, but probably a small, the elastic band was realllllly tight around my natural waist, and my waist is about 29&#34; for those of you who want a reference."
4.0,Purchased as an alternate to expensive designer name and have performed well so far.  Survived travel to Central America and southern USA and do the job at the beach.  Only con is frames are large(by design) and block breeze to eye area.
4.0,"I love the style and the comfort of this shoe/boot. A bit hard to get in and out of, but that is a small inconvenience. It's good quality and a great buy for the price."
4.0,"Very cute, I got Sango, shippo, and Miroku keychains because I was unable to find funko pops for them and they all look great!"
4.0,"Everything about these shorts is reasonably good.  No complaints.  The stretch capabilities aren't as good as some shorts I bought months ago when hiking up steep trails, but plenty good enough.  I'd prefer a built-in belt, but the belt loops work well enough with inexpensive military-style belts I have."
4.0,While these are nice—they are NOT as Oversized as they appear on here.  Just sayin...
4.0,"Very nice Hoodie for the price, sleeves are a bit long so I have to roll them up. I’ve already washed it and dried in the dryer no shrinkage at all."
4.0,This little dress was perfect for my almost-three year old. Shipping took quite awhile... Almost three weeks and there was also a weird chemical smell but after a couple times in the washer it went away. My daughter loves it and can't stop wearing it even though her birthday isn't till next month.
4.0,"The older I get the faster the eyes start to go! That said, there are readers all over this house, I call them &#34;My Eyes&#34; My partner of 28 years uses readers as well or we'rte both blind as bats. I thought these would be fun and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. The frames are quite Retro, well made considering the price and lenses although plastic work beautifully at the magnification I chose (2.75)<br /><br />They're light yet substantial and help a great deal when I'm reading or in front of the computer for hours working - they alleviate eye strain and headaches as well as my Glass lenses which cost twice as much. The down side of course to plastic is how easily they scratch, something to keep in mind. Always remember never to use cleaners like Windex of you'll destroy the lenses. Solutions made for cleaning LCD screens are perfect I've used Philips Screen Cleaning Fluid for years on our monitors, Cell Phones, TV's and so on and it works beautifully - even on these lenses.<br /><br />Included is a nice hard shell case and cleaning cloth making these a very good value in relationship to cost."
4.0,This suit fit well and I received great comments!
4.0,I like that these heels can be used with a varieties of outfits. Thank you!
4.0,Cute. Smaller than expected though.
4.0,High quality fabric.  Fits a little snug with little room in the shoulders.  Stitching is good. Not for active casual wear.
4.0,I got the wrong color combat boots otherwise everything was good
4.0,Used Amazon Search Engine.
4.0,Nice bag but the colors on the inner bag are not as vibrant as shown in the picture.
4.0,So far so good. It fits everything I needed it to and is so classic. I love the color. It's just like the picture. The only negative is that my laptop (15.6 &#34;) does not fit in the section that is designated for a laptop. It arrived on time and was well packaged. Now I wait and see how it holds up with regular use.
4.0,These are longer than what I expected but they do what they are supposed to.
4.0,Does the job.  Magnet is very strong to hang on the cart.  However the magnet that holds the cover of the case shut disappeared.  I don't know where too?  The cover now is loose and my range finder fell out once as I didn't notice the magnet was gone.  Now I'm careful taking out bag from car as that is when it is most likely to fall out of case as I have it hooked on to golf bag.
4.0,"I really liked these sandals and really hoped to keep them but unfortunately I had to return them because my feet are a little wide and they weren’t comfortable. I would recommend them if you have a narrow foot, they look really cute in and they seemed to be comfortable with the right size foot."
4.0,"Delicate fabric a little but cute , just like in the picture"
4.0,"ordered a medium,as other brands of this type glove fit well.these are a bit on the tight side."
4.0,"Bigger than I thought, looks kinda cheap :("
4.0,Tthis dress was a really pretty dress. It fits perfectly. Loved the  orange color. I just didn't the collar of the dress on me. I debating whether to return it because it a great dress.
4.0,Nice affordable. Very large piece
4.0,"The price is right, and it's well made.<br /><br />Being Anglican and Catholic, I find it a meaningful bit of &#34;bling&#34; to wear under my shirt and give meaning to myself without shouting out to the World.<br /><br />One hint, the leather &#34;chain&#34; is adjusable.  Just pull on the knots."
4.0,Great quality bag as expected! I love the embossed flower design too. I love the shape of the bag and how spacious it is. Only drawback is the gold is starting to come off.
4.0,"The cincher fit but, I could have gone down a size. The material is similar to a mesh and just a tad bit too long for my torso (I'm 5'4).  It pulled me in nicely and it wasn't the uncomfortable sort of feeling.  I'll be ordering another in a smaller size."
4.0,I like these suckers.<br /><br />Unfortunately I bought on wishful sizing.<br /><br />But that is my own delusional mistake.
4.0,it was just what I was Looking for.
4.0,Cute dress! Well made
4.0,Love the hat. Fits well. Good quality. Wish the adjustment strap was same color as the hat. It stands out too much and kind of looks like an after thought.
4.0,cute good material
4.0,I really wanted to make this work because the feel and design is excellent. I live in a hot and humid climate so this would've been perfect if it wasn't as baggy as it was on me.<br /><br />I'm under 5 feet so this top was like a short dress that gave me a box figure.<br /><br />Even the sleeves went to my elbows. I love this shirt but it's me who couldn't fit it.
4.0,"Nice! Son liked it but for a few bucks more ($6-7 more) I also ordered a Ronaldo jersey that was much better quality by Adidas. So this serves its purpose but in terms of quality, meh."
4.0,Nice shoes...
4.0,Pretty earrings but some of them are much smaller than expected.
4.0,Really pretty. Heavy but Love the look
4.0,"Arrived on time, undamaged."
4.0,"This did fit around my waist, but the quality isn't the best. It looks cute with some edgy emo outfits. For reference my waist is around 30 inches."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful. Didn't get to wear too my event but I kept it for a future function. Unfortunately this dress is made for someone with bigger breasts, but it's still cute."
4.0,"This is a lovely cardigan, but it's the kind that fits small. I missed where it said ""slim fit"" in the description. I like my cardigans loose and longer. This one is on the short side, too. I was disappointed as soon as I pulled it out of the bag, because I could tell it was on the small side. I normally go for a large for a loose fit, but sometimes go up to an XL when I especially want something to fit looser(like with cardigans and T-shirts). I got an XL in this, but I simply prefer a looser, longer, more casual look. If you are wanting a cardigan that fits shorter and smaller, this is a nice choice. The color looks beautiful and I love the design around the edges. It's not the softest cardigan, but it's not bad either."
4.0,Cute but kind of thin and runs small. M Fits my 7 yr old just barely
4.0,Thin material perfect for spring/summer. Love the design and comfortable. My onky issue is that is slightly tight across the back/shoulders. Still wearable but no real give to the material.
4.0,Bought my son iron man(bioworld) one over 2 yrs ago...and still going.So now you understand the quality. So didnt hesitate to buy this one  although lacking pockets and little touches that made other one standout it is being evaluated now.  But seems good so far
4.0,The belt is to long but it will work.  Has a very good hole maker need a block of wood and hammer.
4.0,I had to return as it was too big.  Nice purse and made well.
4.0,It is the size I wanted and I like it but I have to agree with some reviews I read regarding how hard and not flexible the material is.  I hope that with time it will  get softer.
4.0,"Thicker material, almost like ski socks. I am of average height and they go up almost over my knees."
4.0,I'm a pretty large guy and it fits pretty good. I'm on the second to last notch but it's cool and for your money's worth seems to be very durable.
4.0,"I love this dress BUT had to make alterations first. It's nice and thick so no see through with it, i love that I can wear it without a bra (small chested). But the straps were too long at first so I cut them where they met the dress on one side, then cut the straps to the length I like and sewed back on. Super quick fix, but could easily be improved with adjustable straps."
4.0,This is a gift and I hope the person I bought it for will like it.
4.0,"Excellent for walking through stores during the day or night because store lights are white and harsh.Excellent for night time walking around where are a lot of store lights,street lights ect.Just the right amount of amber to dim the lights.Good for driving at night.I put mine on at dusk when shopping,in car and browsing supermarkets.Reduces stress when shopping ect."
4.0,I enjoy the different colors and the fact that they don't stab me in the head like the plastic headbands...
4.0,"Poor quality on the stitching, I had to add my own hole for the tie. Very thin fabric but will be fine in the summer."
4.0,Nice ring. Fits well
4.0,"The beads are solid with good quality crystals and firmly mounted.  Have small indentations for CBR of that type, but can also be used to replace spring-loaded beads of same size - may need CBR pliers to assist.  These have no threads for internal or external threaded jewelry.  Only disappointment was the aqua color was very light compared to most aqua crystals purchased elsewhere - just a little more aqua than plain light blue color."
4.0,"These are helpful in extending the length of a necklace. The magnet end was a little different than ones I had used in the past in that one end inserts into the other. So far they seem to work OK. The metal does have that ""cheap"" look but I guess I didn't expect more because of the price."
4.0,the studs are 18 gauge ate lest be warned. more normal ear piercings are 20 gauge so the whole in a normal ear my be small for these but as someone who had gauges before these are perfect. little big for me to look like gauges but i wasn't going for that look
4.0,I liked the product it is used for cycling
4.0,Thin but as expected. Great throw around errand-running kind of a day top
4.0,A bit bigger than the measurements state
4.0,Order up a size. Accidentally ordered my mom’s size(she wears a size larger than I do)It actually fit me perfectly.
4.0,"Thick, cozy, boxy shape. Not fitted like shown. I ordered 3xl (large American) based on reviews. Don't care for it buttoned because of the boxy shape but it's cute open. I'm 5'6 148lb (muscular) and normally wear 6 in pants and medium shirt to give you a reference point. I feel it's a little big but a medium prob would be too small."
4.0,My daughter says they keep her legs warm and don’t slip down her waist like others have. They aren’t the easiest thing in the world to get on either but it’s worth the effort once on. I definitely recommend them.
4.0,"Super stylin, just what I was looking for. Sturdy quality and great fit. These are grey lens I prefer amber but the grey is just the right tone."
4.0,"Soft material, and cute. It runs big for my 5-month-old."
4.0,"These are fun. You have to look closely to see the dragon, but isn't it that way in nature?"
4.0,The inside is soft. I am a little concerned about the graphic coming off with washing.
4.0,as described and seem to be of reasonable quality for the price
4.0,Looks NOTHING like the picture but I still like the dress a lot.
4.0,Nice light Sweater with a pearl buttons for a special look.
4.0,string was very short and made of a weird material.
4.0,nice and warm.. my daughter love it.. it comfortable
4.0,Not too many men carry a cloth handkerchief these days.  But my Father has always (and will always).  So these were a great bargain and he was pleased with the quality (plus my 85 year old Mother won't have to iron them like linen ones of old).
4.0,As described.  Shiny material is durable.
4.0,I think it was a good present for my sister.  It came quickly and in good shape
4.0,"They are warm and the touch screen capability does work.  The inner lining does bunch up a bit making the glove harder to put on fully.  However, once they are on your hands, they are comfortable and warm."
4.0,Bought 2 of them for my granddaughter’s totally adorable
4.0,kind of like a wife beater dress. I bought it to wear under neath a see through dress i own.
4.0,I have used this type of cleaning cloth before and this one appears better
4.0,"Little tight around the neck, but fits well otherwise."
4.0,Runs way to small. I accidentally ordered 3x which I larger then my size .there was almost no stretchability. I didn’t think it would fit. It sure holds in place so I guess it would be good for working out. Would not buy again. Return window closed. boo
4.0,Lenses are the perfect shade to block out the bright sun rays while driving. The fit is very comfortable n lightweight. The style and color of the frames are beautiful! The bifocals are a tad noticeable when looking straight out of the lenses but it doesn’t stop me from enjoying  these great reader sunglasses! The little crystals were a nice surprise on each of the temples!
4.0,Love it! It arrived in a few days (on time before my OUAT convention). I’m using this for cosplay and halloween. Haven’t used it yet but I did try it on and it fits perfectly. It also came very well packaged you can tell the seller cares!<br /><br />I took off one star because my sensitive weird skin found it a tad bit itchy on my neck. I will come back for an update if its not itchy at all when i wear it this weekend. I would still recommend this product.
4.0,I would have given 5 stars but I am short so it is a little long but I love the comfort.
4.0,Pretty good my gf liked it a lot
4.0,It’s comfortable & can b used 4 many diff occasions
4.0,They're cute they block the sun pretty well they're a bit smaller than I thought but they fit perfectly fine just thought the lense part would be bigger still very cute! Would recommend!
4.0,"I love this necklace! It can be dressed up or down.  I received so many compliments on it my first day wearing it.  People think it is more expensive than what it is.  People who are complaining on here are probably expecting more for their money, but seriously?  You paid under $4. for it.  I love it! so dainty and just my bohemian style.  I say go for it..  and I also purchased the silver leaf necklace. Another steal at under $4<br />great summer jewelry too!  Enjoy my friends!!"
4.0,"I love this shirt! It's so cute and fun, I can wear with just about anything. It's a little tight around my hips but that's it."
4.0,"I like this flip focal very much.  For old eyes, it is a great help.  This is not a complaint, but I wish there was a way to lower the lens into position without actually touching it.  With slimy hands after just releasing a fish, you wind up having to clean the lens from time to time; never easy to do when standing in the water with a rod and wading staff to manage."
4.0,"This suit is very cute. However, if you are some what small in the tata area, it seems to push them down a little bit more."
4.0,Was a gift for my son. He loves it
4.0,Nice dress and fit however I am disappointed with the colour ........it is totally off! I was expecting a mint look but I got a light blue.
4.0,I was surprised when this piece arrived. It has been done in a very old fashion manor but yet it held a precious appeal. The flower is made of a plastic material. The dealer did well in explaining it. It came in a timely fashion and I will not hesitate in buying from them again.
4.0,Nice suit. Top does run big. Seller in China so cant exchange for quick turnaround. At the price kept and took it for alterations. No support in the top. Bottoms fit nice
4.0,Cleans shoes good
4.0,"I received this in a few weeks which was quick. Before I ordered this I read the reviews and ordered a large due to others stating the product runs small. I am 5'7&#34;, normal weight and busty. Large fits perfect with a little to give so it doesn't look to tight. I suppose the medium would have fit but may have been too snug. It's lightweight, has a stretch too it and cute with dresses. I like it!"
4.0,"Fits as expected. Sleeves are long so I have to roll them up, which is normal for me."
4.0,it's such a pretty ring but it's too big rip
4.0,Great glasses for the price. Comfortable with hats.  Lost a star because 2 weeks in the arm screw fell out. Easy fix so I can still wear them!
4.0,Great size bag for an iPad Pro 10.5 in with a Smart Keyboard and pencil case. It is a minimalist bag. Very portable. Does not provide much protection to the tablet. Charger fits in side pocket but makes it bulky.
4.0,Its unique and of my favorite anime.
4.0,"I was leery about ordering this but needed something to hold my phone while running with no other pockets. I ordered the green in an extra large. I am 5’4”, 150 lbs athletic, 38 B. When it came I thought....NO WAY this is going to fit. It’s very very small looking. But it does fit and it holds my iPhone 10s plus sans case. It’s not exactly “easy” getting the phone into the pocket by yourself but you can do it. My only complaint is that I wish there was more material on the sides by the arm pit because for me.....it gives me that “boob fat” spilling out look. As I am normally wearing a shirt, it’s not a huge deal but it would be better with a bit more coverage in that area."
4.0,Beautiful gift for my 14-year old step daughter!  Looked to be of high quality.
4.0,I ordered this last minute for my daughters HBCU graduation. Nice wish it was a bit thicker quality.
4.0,"Do not wear this piece if you are in scrubs all day. The constant hand washing might ruin the appearance. I love how my watch blings and looks very expensive. I just will not be wearing it at work anymore.<br />I took two links out of the band, very easy to remove the directions were easy to read."
4.0,Its perfect for my 20m old
4.0,"Loose in the armpits,  but overall a good product."
4.0,like it hope it will last a while.
4.0,"It is fine at night so your hair isn’t frizzy in the a.m…. But the elastic ic to small, so it needs a little cutting adjustment for comfort."
4.0,goes to far past my ears
4.0,Product was beautiful but link removal tool was broken. Unfortunately I can not wear without removing links. May be returning
4.0,"a little shorter than expected, but otherwise great."
4.0,"Dress is great this is just a review to help with sizing. I’m 5 foot two 130lbs athletic built. Hips 36, waist 29 chest 36 (34D) I got a size 8 and it was almost perfect. I had a lot of side boob going on. Thos would fit perfectly if you were a 34B or C probably. Material is thick and stretchy. Great dress!"
4.0,Works well.<br />Only downside is that it is difficult for the toddler to reattach if it becomes unclipped.
4.0,Material quality I did not like.<br />Too long.<br />Had to order two sizes larger.
4.0,"Thr material is very comfortable and rhe pockets are fabulous. BUT, I'm on the fence about these as a larger woman. I ordered my normal XXL size and they absolutely fit like leggings with pockets. Will probably keep them bit not loose fitting like I wanted."
4.0,I like the dress. It is a little longer than I expected after reading reviews I was scared it’d be too short but it was actually too long. Overall the fit was good
4.0,This shirt is adorable and exactly what I wanted for my 10 year old son who Ioves Barney! The material feels a little cheap at first but once I washed it it felt fine.
4.0,"Love the stretchiness, makes for comfortable wearing."
4.0,The most adorable thing ever! Only the puff ball on the hoodie got ripped off instantly and that's why the 4 stars.
4.0,Very good fit well
4.0,"Smaller then what I thought it was, plus to me the picture looks like it would be half gold/half silver like the Orin in the movie, but it's solid gold color.  Need to get a new chain this one is a little cheap looking but for the price it's a cute added little flair to the book and movie lovers."
4.0,"Got this hat after seeing a cheaper knockoff on Facebook.  My partner wanted one and so we ordered.  The hat is well made, the embroidery is good and he loves his hat.  :-)  I know he would buy it again.  It doesn't look cheap or tacky and all in all he's glad he got it."
4.0,It worked great on a cold rainy fishing trip. The length was just right so the pants still covered my boots when sitting down.
4.0,Look a little cheap.
4.0,The top part sits a lot higher but the dress is super cute and flattering. Big chest friendly! The color is on point and the material is super soft and not see thru. Really like this.
4.0,"After reading a LOT of reviews, I ordered a medium. The other dress I ordered at the same time, I ordered in an XXL. Both fit, which only goes to show. I'm five three and weight 145 lbs, btw.<br /><br />This Medium dress would probably be better for someone about five five or five six. If I wear heels and also tuck the waist up a bit as I tie it, it's wearable without hemming -- barely. Commenters are correct that the slits in the skirt come up very, very high. I will probably wind up taking a few stitches on both sides. It's a very pretty dress, though, and immediately drew compliments the first time I wore it."
4.0,"Ordered in an XL, a little big but fit as I thought it would for an XL. Could have gotten a Large. I am 5'0, 175lb, dress hit just slightly above the knee. Overall very flattering!"
4.0,This is not slim fit. It is regular fit.
4.0,"Comfortable, flowy, and perfect when paired with leggings and tall boots!"
4.0,"My husband found the shirt to fit great.  The collar was a bit tight around the neck, made him want to keep pulling it away from his neck.  He is not a big man.  He wears normal t-shirts and has never worn a V-neck so I know it wasn't due to the type of shirt it was.  Super soft! Comfortable other than the neck area."
4.0,CUTE FITTED DRESSY TSHIRT. GOOD FOR WORK ON HIT DAYS
4.0,Somewhat confused because they contain spandex or licra .So they stretch a bit.  Never had that before.  Lets see how much they last.  They look good.
4.0,"I surprised myself when I tried on the dress. The material is so thin that I'll have to wear a slip or be ok with my body shining if I stand with light behind me.  HOWEVER, the dress fits extremely well. I'm bra size 36D, and usually dresses like this are too low cut, or gap around the arm holes or too tight on top.  This one fits perfectly. It even has side seam pockets! So I'm keeping it for sure."
4.0,The item is in great condition and a perfect gift. It arrived a day late but my younger sister loves the necklace. I would recommend the buy. Enjoy!
4.0,"These are huge!! Fall right off but I'm a fan of over sides glasses so I'm used to it. Only thing is, don't drive while wearing them! The thick plastic kinda obstructed my vision and made it hard to drive. I guess i'll only be wearing these if I'm in the passenger seat! Lol"
4.0,"I gifted this to a friend who is as crazy about skulls as I am and she loves it.  It loses a star b/c of the side zippers, which make it difficult to get into and out of the purse."
4.0,Absolutely love this hair. It is super soft and  I've worn it for the last three days with no shedding or tangles. There was more than enough hair to complete my wig. I even have 1/3 of a bundle left over! I will most definitely buy from this vendor again.
4.0,"I'm going to give this a 4 because within minutes of trying these on, a hole was  created by the left hand thumb. I was able to sew it and save them but if I hadn't that would have been a major disappointment."
4.0,Just needed a bit of tailoring but looks and feels nice
4.0,"I would give this sweater 5 stars! I gave it 4 starts because of how long it took to receive it. It took at least 6 weeks.<br />However, the sweater is something I wear ALL THE TIM. I get so many compliments on it! It’s incredibly warm!"
4.0,It is a Christmas gift don’t know the answer
4.0,"My wife bought this dress hoping it was chiffon as the title suggests but it is not. This also fits extremely small, even for a wrap dress which is generally a universally flattering design."
4.0,"soft material, very comfortable, great size I got 2X love way fits, have not washed it yet but will let you know"
4.0,"These shirts are incredibly comfortable. I am fairly skinny, so I went with a size small and it fit just right. It does have a good stretch to it, so if someone carries more muscle mass and still wants to go with a small, I think it will work, but with more of a compression feel to it, of course.<br /><br />As for the fabric, keep in mind that it is very THIN, and as it stretches it becomes more ""see through"".<br /><br />The one real critique I have for this shirt is the seaming, specifically around the neck area. In all 3 shirts is kind of loose and the fabric is really choppy, and I would not be surprided if I could rip it with my bare hands.<br /><br />Let's see how if they can hold up, once I get to train in them."
4.0,The material is quite thin
4.0,"This was my first item, I have ordered from Amazon.  The earrings are very pretty.  A nice surprise!"
4.0,Fast delivery. Super light weight. Polarized takes a little time to get used to.
4.0,It was a little small but that might have been my bad. Hoping that hand washing it and stretching the fabric it will fit just right.
4.0,Looks cute and useful.
4.0,"Comfy - did not have an issue with sizing as far as other reviews. Want to order more but not available, I’ve had them for a while now and they hold well too! See through but I don’t care I wear them to bed anyways"
4.0,i ordered the ones with blue in the inside not white but i like them
4.0,"I love the look of these and they are great quality for the price. Wanted something different from my usual wayfarers - only thing 2 things I don’t “love” -  the nose pads catch on my hair and pull, and they are too dark for days that are partly cloudy - I usually choose a different pair except on full sun days."
4.0,"This wrap coat is really warm and looks decent much better than the classic coats. Comes with the belt. I wear it sometimes in Minnesota winters. Delivery was on time. i just wished it had XS size available. Material is of good quality, havent washed yet. But till now, I love this wrap coat."
4.0,Received numerous compliments when I wore this to work
4.0,"Perfect for a gift,  love the Ying and yang ,it came in a neat cute box,  really love the neat make"
4.0,The color was not as depicted it's more of a peachy / coral pink instead of the soft rose pink that was shown but I can deal with that. It's the only reason I gave 4 stars. Haven't put it to use yet but it seemed quality made and has more than enough room to fit all my stuff. About 95% happy with my purchase.
4.0,Bought these for our daughter she in a drug tec.<br />She said they are 👍
4.0,"Love the earrings! Very nice in person. The posts were a little tight, but could be loosened."
4.0,Purchased for my husband as he had an accident with his cap.  This one looks and fits ok.
4.0,I liked it but it ran pretty small.
4.0,I really enjoy this wallet because its very small and i like wallets i can easily throw in my small purse or in my pockey or hook on my keys and this was perfect for it it holds a lot for me and the quality is really good
4.0,"The dress fit as expected. No imperfections, no alterations needed. Length was perfect. Color was as expected. Good quality material."
4.0,Beautiful design and the quality is decent. The dress is fully lined and comes with built in cups but also boning which makes the top fit horribly. I ordered this for a ball and had the boning and cups taken out. Ordered a 20w when my normal size is usually a 16-18 so I’d definitely say it runs small. Good value for the price though
4.0,"I'm on the short side, but everything feels nice."
4.0,"I use this kimono all the time because it is SO comfortable and perfect for wearing around the house. I wanted it to be loose so I ordered a large (I'm usually a size small) and am happy with the fit. The color and pattern on the material are also very nice. The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because some of the seams have loose threats and the inside seams are kind of rough. You can't see them when wearing the kimono so it is totally fine, and for the price it is a great product! Very good deal."
4.0,"Bought for my son. He loves it. It is soft and warm, and if the washing instructions were in English, he would wear it everyday. Unfortunately, it is not. I hand washed and flat dried it and it seems to have worked, but I am hesitant about repeat washes, and hence about buying more colors."
4.0,my son liked it especially all the pockets
4.0,Very nicely made!<br />Ran a little small
4.0,Looks a good as in the picture and cozy. Only thing I don’t like is the sleeves are itchy
4.0,"Fit and length were as expected. It is a beautiful shirt! I do think the crochet bottom could be a little softer/flowier, but otherwise I love it so far!"
4.0,"I was surprised to discover the verbiage on the top was NOT in French like the ad, which is why I purchased. The top is still nice, the quality and fit were very nice as well, and even though the message on the top was different from what I thought I was ordering, (the ad had a French message, the top came with an English message and NOT the same meaning). I liked it too much to return it. I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the difference of the message."
4.0,"Fit well and looked good with the matching top. Strings untie often, but not a deal breaker."
4.0,Came on time and very soft brushed cotton. Would recommend for the Harley female enthusiast or rider
4.0,I didnt get to wear it but did try it on. Its very beautiful and would of been worn if I could have walked in it. It was for my daughters wedding.
4.0,I like this item because it is very fashionable and gives added value to my wardrobe.
4.0,Super comfy & cute! Just the right size and length! It’s a cute go to sweatshirt when you don’t want to look like a bum!
4.0,"Fits great, looks good. Takes some getting used to in order to take it off, but I am getting the hang of it after a few tries."
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and feels nice quality. Unfortunately it was too large for me. I am 5'2"" and 105 pounds and got a small. It was too long and too loose, especially in the sleeves. I wouldn't recommend getting the 3/4 sleeve version if you have thin arms. I am returning it. Also of note is that the care instructions say dry clean only."
4.0,"Boyfriend loves this for his lapel or tie because he's kind of a handyman around the place and he loves his tools. He is a kid in a candy store whenever we are at OSH or Home Depot. I saw this and knew I had to get it for him. The only issue I have with it is that it is kind of difficult to get it to stay on straight. I think if the handle wasn't so far from the clip, it would be easier to align it. But that's a small issue and overall it is still cute."
4.0,Very pretty  rosary
4.0,"I have been looking for a good pair of shield rimless sunglasses, cus my head is wide, so it can flex a bit to fit my face<br />you just can't beat this quality at this price!!!<br />the hinge needs to be smoother though"
4.0,"I love the colors on this suit!  It just screams summer beach!  I typically would never consider a two piece suit, but I thought I would give this a try.  I like the adjustable straps on the top, I always love the 'fit just for your style.  The top does not have an underwire, but is padded and very supportive.  The bottoms are high waist and provide great lower belly and rear coverage.  There is no tummy control on these, so not for a bloat day!  If you have been wearing one piece suits for the last 10 years, step out of your comfort zone and give this a try, I think you'll enjoy.  For the price, it is definitely worth it!"
4.0,They are roomy in the legs... not exactly &#34;skinny jeans&#34; (and I am not a skinny person!) but they look good and are comfortable.
4.0,This sweater is a high quality product. My only complaint is that the weave is a little looser than I expected.
4.0,"Simple vest - fit very well, light, but warm enough. Looks good with sport attire."
4.0,"Overall I love this dress, I think it is great, however it will shrink when you wash it. It shrinks almost a full size. This was my experience, it maybe be different for others."
4.0,I love that these slippers are warm and they cover my ankles. My feet stay toasty warm all day in these slippers.
4.0,"Very comfortable, good quality product. Met my expectations."
4.0,The material isn’t cotton so be aware of that. I wore them once for a festival and they held up pretty nicely
4.0,"Really tight around the shoulders.  Good quality fabric.  Long enough to wear as a dress (5'10&#34;).  Cute on the model, not cute on me."
4.0,Little large than my size and very thin... But good product....Go for it
4.0,"Nice jeans, I did not know Sassoon jeans were still around!"
4.0,Easy to use.  Works perfectly.
4.0,Great quality. Runs a little large. Should cost much less. It's just a doo rag after all.
4.0,"Very breathable, even comfortable in summer heat."
4.0,"I've had these earrings for about two weeks now and feel ready to write a review:<br /><br />Pros<br />1. The earrings arrived promptly and were nicely packaged.<br />2. I ordered the 6mm and they are exactly that. I love the size and find them just right for my first piercing.<br />3. The earrings are solid and sturdy and they appear to be made of true stainless steel.<br />4. I've worn them while showering and swimming and they have not tarnished or faded or turned my ears green.<br />5. The seller provided excellent customer service.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. The butterfly backs that came with the earrings were too loose and I had to replace them with another pair of mine.<br />2. The earrings are rather heavy; 6mm is manageable but I wouldn't go any bigger than that.<br />3. The seller's pictures are not accurate and the earrings are mainly gold with a hint of copper. The photos posted by other reviewers depict the color more accurately. I was disappointed at first but I've grown to like the shade.<br /><br />Others<br />1. The posts are quite long at 12mm. This doesnt bother me (even while sleeping) but others may find it cumbersome.<br />2. I do not have any metal allergy and cannot tell if the earrings are hypoallergenic. However, I have not experienced any irritation wearing them.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this item given the offer price and durability.<br /><br />I hope this helps you in deciding on whether to make the purchase!"
4.0,"A little narrow between the straps on the front. Don't care for the fabric tag, wish they were just printed on. Some loose threads and the side seams aren't exactly finished, but I wear them instead of camis under other tops, so no one will ever know."
4.0,"After receiving the uniform I was surprised at the quality of the hakama. For the price, it is very nice and well made. The kimono top looks nice and fit well, but a bit on the thin side as you can see some light shining through. I am 6' 1&#34; and over 200 pounds. The hakama when properly tied was just long enough to reach my ankles. So hopefully that can help some people figure out the right size for them. Also the hakama has no inseam, just a skirt. Not sure if there really is supposed to be one but not a con for me.<br /><br />Learning to tie the hakama took a couple tries but I managed to figure it out  in no time! The straps could be longer since I was not able to completely tie the front straps with a secure bow in the back as well as creating the &#34;+&#34; sign bow shape in the front with the back straps. Also, what made me take a star was the lack of the plastic piece that should be attached to the back portion of the hakama! This is an important piece that was not included. There should be a small white plastic spatula shaped piece secured to the back to allow you to secure the back portion of the hakama to the straps from the front portion. If this was supposed to be included, I'd like to know how to get one sent over so I may attach it myself.<br /><br />Note: It says I chose Medium for some reason, but I chose XL. Just to avoid confusion....."
4.0,"The product is convenient for traveling and is easily to carry in the pants pocket.  The company also followed-up with an email to check for production satisfaction. 3 pairs can be used for a long time.  When I need other prescription strength, I'll buy from them again."
4.0,Nice big bag. Only thing is those strings are little difficult to close.
4.0,Very comfortable. Lots of compliments
4.0,Great for the price. Thick long and so cute!
4.0,"Made with a thin material, this is just for looks will not keep you warm"
4.0,"Cute boots! They fit ok. Not using them for extended wear, so comfort isn’t an issue for me. Look great with lingerie🤗"
4.0,Excellent variety of sizes.
4.0,Good but wish i got the 16 oz as i use mostly to spray garden & flowers.
4.0,"Cute markers for your glasses. The pineapples fit perfectly on wine glasses but the snails are too big for the rim.  If you have a mug, the snails will be a better fit."
4.0,"I’m 5’5” got the medium and it falls just below my knees, which is perfect for me. I’ve worn it both as “business casual” and “casual” so it’s definitely worth the money."
4.0,I have a narrow foot but had to order a half size larger because the toe of the sole is really narrow and I felt like my toes were going to hang over the edges. The half size larger then made the strap across the toes a little too loose. I did keep them because navy is hard to find and with the ankle strap I felt like I would be ok with the loose toe strap. Not ideal fit however. If you have a wide foot it might not work for you.
4.0,"The description says its a 32R, but it's a 42R.<br />This coat arrived 2 days early, so that alone gets a star or two, enough time to get a rush job on stitching and hemming, square it away the following night, and pass a promotion board with it. So, two big ol' thumbs up from me.<br />That being said, it arrives crisp, but the buttons are drooping from a cord, instead of attached with a sliding metal piece. Very ""costume"" feel instead of like a uniform. Maybe the ""tropical"" cut material?<br />The material is definitely thinner, and the description mentions something about relaxed arm-holes for ease of saluting or driving....not the case. Fits fine while standing or just bending at the elbow, but the coat is just as tight or tighter than my former ASU coat, that was ruined by an off post dry cleaner, when popping a salute.<br />Considering the nationwide inventory shortage, and the haste in which it was required, I don't regret my purchase."
4.0,"Cute shirt, love the pockets"
4.0,I originally bought an xs but in the trim style I needed a small. In the completely solid  skort the xs which I usually wear fit fine. Also the skirt with the trim color has a waistband that makes your waist look unflattering. I would recommend the solid colors  I LOVE THAT IT HAS 2 hidden pockets on the built in shorts
4.0,They are very comfortable.  I am a nurse and work 12 hours shifts.  My feet did not get tired wearing these shoes.  The colors went great with my halloween and fall scrubs.
4.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for. Love the look and feel of the pu leather. I would say I have regular sized calves and about halfway up, I have to slowly guide the zipper while pushing my skin down. The calf area is a bit tight so be wary of that about fit. For shoe size, I normally wear a 9.5-10 in other heels and got the size 10 in this. That size fits great in the shoe area. There are a couple frays from threads so makes me worry a little about quality. But for the price, got what I wanted and look great on."
4.0,Am 5’ 0” 127-130 lbs with a belly (pouch) and the medium fit good.I bought the black on me it’s squat proof despite it says not squat proof.  I initially had a sm in my cart based Off what I read but because I have a gut So went with the medium. I think the small would be good for someone who had a flat belly and no pouch. It’s not saggy anywhere it fits nicely and has good compression on the waist. The only but I have is that it rolls down on me.
4.0,Really cute cross-body bag. Perfect size. I really wanted to keep it but I could get over the pink/red color that the edges of the bag had. If you look closely you can see it in the picture. Lovely bag though.
4.0,Super cute suit but it hasn’t really retained its elasticity.  Wore in pool a couple of times and it’s too big now!
4.0,"Very beautiful necklace.  Chain is a little short,  hence the 4 stars.  Other than that I LOVE it!"
4.0,"Fits like a medium. Comfortable. I didn't realize at time of order (though clearly noticable in the picture) that the seams on the sides come forward towards the bottom of the shirt instead of remaining vertical the whole way down. These will be great as undershirts and layering, possibly even for gym use. They are a bit shiny, however based on the material that's to be expected."
4.0,The necklace was actually smaller than what it looks like. But they made good gifts.
4.0,"They are bigger than expected but i have no problem with it, they are super cute although the white paint doesn’t line up with the spots you’re supposed to put the paint"
4.0,"Perfect size.<br />Arrived on time.<br />Feels like memory foam inside, fits well.<br />Very comfortable.<br />Great for long hours on your feet, even overnight shifts."
4.0,"They're nice enough. They match the price paid, so I would recommend them. They're also the perfect size."
4.0,Gave them to my sister for Christmas and she is happy with them.
4.0,Bigger than I thought. Runs big . Material is just plastic decorations ironed into the fabric
4.0,This is great and and does its job. One big drawback is you can't leave it plugged in. You always have to unplug it from the wall. It's got a switch to toggle the ozone. Why not just include a second switch to toggle power on/off?!
4.0,"Comfortable, great quality, but runs large. I wear a 12-14 and it was too big on me."
4.0,"Very nice and stylish, but just wish they had a pivoting foot (2 points of contact) where it grabs the shirt. Just one single point of contact, so you will find yourself straightening the clip from time to time."
4.0,"I got these for a cosplay costume so I haven't worn them much but they seem nice, fit well"
4.0,just as it appears on picture.
4.0,"It does its job, but I wish it was heavier. My umbrella is on my balcony and gets quite a bit of wind. At times I feel like I have to check if it's still in place because once the wind was so strong that the base rotated ( umbrella was closed)."
4.0,"Excellent Watch for LOW PRICE! Just to look at it, U would think it's a High Dollar Investment. Band seems flimsy, but doesn't look cheap..."
4.0,It is kind of a cheaper material than expected and it looks kinda cheap but it is comfortable and that's pretty much all that matters!
4.0,"I ordered this shirt for my wife so she had other flowy options for when she went to the gym. The shirt arrived as expected and is exactly something she would buy as a gym shirt or something to throw on while working around the house. The sizing does seem to be a bit off though, as it is a bit bigger than expected so she has to find a way to make it work now, especially if she planned to wear it at the gym. But, besides that one little issue, the shirt is not bad at all."
4.0,"Gift. Everyone loved it. Looks great, fits well, good quality.👍"
4.0,"These are some real OVERSIZED glasses. I thought they would be slightly smaller but I think they will be an eye catcher though, haha"
4.0,I liked this. I was worried about the color and the fit. I am a very small woman. It was comfy and fit snuggly. I felt very sexy!
4.0,"IT's really a cool, there is a lot respect of me having this Cross."
4.0,It was hard to get the band through. The material stripped off. I’m glad the band was dark so all was not lost.
4.0,I ordered this for my brother for Christmas and he adores it. He loves the fit and wears it all the time.
4.0,"This was a lifesaver.  I wish it was a little bigger, but otherwise purfect.  Thank you."
4.0,"very comfortable shoes, the arch support is very supportive and helps to relieve the pain in my feet, the adjustable top is very helpful to customize the shoe -- just love to wear them! just wish they would have come in a darker brown color"
4.0,"This is a cute winter hat.  The boiled wool is not as sturdy as another hat I have of boiled wool, but it keeps the head warm and looks cute at the same time."
4.0,"this purse is very spacious and fits everything which is a nice feature. The small handles seem to be very flimsy and have somehow separated at the base of the purse, and some of the stitching is loose. I have gotten a lot of compliments on this bag but it seems that its not the best quality if using this as an every day carry all."
4.0,"Took a few tries to get them to sit and secure in the tight place. Edges would sometimes curl up and slowly lost the  stickiness. But good for coverage, short term wear, don't sweat too much."
4.0,Second order ..... Just what l ordered ..... Thanks .....
4.0,Fit good and looked like the picture.  Exactly what I wanted
4.0,"The black trays were scratched, and a couple were bent. The rest were fine."
4.0,Purple is my favorite color but the material was made a little funny and feels. Like a book leg purse.it reminds me of a diaper bag.
4.0,"Skirt purchased for my 12 year old and fits perfectly, although she's not too happy about the length which is to her knees.  She's average height between 4'11"" and 5'.  Great quality. The lining is a cotton material and soft.  Not crazy about the way the waist is made, thought it came with a satin belt to cover it, but it doesn't. In pictures sent by others a satin ribbon belt is shown.  My only other complaint is that the color is not as described.  We ordered light pink and it is not even in the pink family.  It is actually a very light peach, more in the orange family, so I have to send it back because I ordered for a specific occasion where I need blush pink or at least something in the pink family."
4.0,I read the reviews prior to ordering and everyone said to size down. I am normally 9.5 and I got a size 9. These fit perfectly!! The day I got them in mail it was a rainy day and it kept my feet warm!
4.0,Great quality. Ran small
4.0,"Took a long time to receive top. But worth it is soft, a little big,the sewing is nice  if it hadn't taken so long to receive top I would order another"
4.0,"The bracelet was packaged and delivered perfectly.  The cross was larger than I expected but was still nice.  The crystals in the cross are alright, but the cloth bracelet worked great.  It was easily adjusted."
4.0,"This bag is the perfect size for daily use. It is convenient and light.  However, the leather is slightly lighter than I had expected from the pictures but it still looks quite nice."
4.0,I think if I wear it with another bracelet. It will look great. I hope that I can get it soon.
4.0,"Easy to see numbers, has a second hamd and it is very light. Hardly know I am wearing it"
4.0,l its ok
4.0,The chest was less supportive then what I would like but I can still get away without a bra. I’m 5’4’’ 34DD 160 very curvy. Nice material. Glad I got it for my vacation
4.0,"Thus far, this is one of my best sunshades...."
4.0,Nice pair of tights. Compression is perfect. Not to tight
4.0,"Cute, awesome if thats your style"
4.0,"This bodysuit is EVERYTHING, It's sexy and seems to be a bit slimming, maybe it's the two types of material of the bodysuit that gives you the slimming look. It actually fits like a great fitting blouse than a bodysuit, however as the title stated you will need boob tape, the cut is very low so unless you purchase a size small or your intentions is to show alot of cleavage, tape is definitely a necessity."
4.0,My usual size now is XL - I assume this dress would be run small so I got a 3x and it fit comfortably.
4.0,"Shipping and packaging was great. Faster than expected. Sizing runs a big small, so be prepared for that. More of my bum will be showing at the pool than I had planned, butt that's fine."
4.0,"They are a bit thinner that the ones I usually wear which have a more padded foot bed, but I like the reinforced toe and heel and they were comfortable to wear."
4.0,"The bracelelts arrived and they’re pretty, but I just don’t think they’re worth the cost.  It’s a set of 4 stretch bracelets with tiny beads and the beads don’t seem heavy enough to be made of glass.  They are stretchy and would fit almost any wrist.  If you have a hard time finding bracelets that fit your writsts, these might be the bracelets for you."
4.0,"I love this shacket ,I ordered a large but a medium would have been more flattering ,I'm very tall so it really doesn't work as a dress"
4.0,Cute but probably won't last to long as they are pretty cheaply constructed but you get what you pay for and they are great for the price
4.0,"I ordered black, it's a pretty sweater but I suggest ordering a size or two bigger if you want it a little more roomy, it is see through, also it seems like it will shrink easily in the wash if washed on hot and also might shrink easily in the dryer, it is a very soft sweater and is thicker, seems to be a little shorter in length than the pictures shown, I'm not a tall person so that isn't the issue with length,  overall it's a nice sweater, the sleeves fit tightly which is not what I was looking for, it did not fit me so I will need to return it but it is a nice sweater."
4.0,"You get what you pay for, but the pants are pretty comfy even though they’re not exactly flattering. As for the shirt, it’s very tight and I do not have the body for a crop top so that was a no-go from the beginning. I like sleeping in the pants, they are a light material that does not make you hot."
4.0,Was great for Spirit day. Exactly as described and expected. Love Minnie and the sparkle
4.0,This jacket is warm & fits as I expected.
4.0,True to size - very comfortable - have not washed yet
4.0,My only thing was that the waist wasn’t elastic but fit fine.
4.0,Great shoe for the river.
4.0,I bought these gloves for riding my motorcycle in colder weather in FL. They are very warm and waterproof which is why I bought them. The only negative is the fingers have a lot of padding so feeling the controls on my handlebars is difficult.  They feel too mushy to be used as my daily driver gloves but for an occasional drive in 55degree weather they do the job. I can still use my phone touch screen with gloves on which is great when I’m parked and wanting to enter Navigation location. For the money these will keep your hands warm and dry but they don’t offer precise feeling of handlebar controls if you plan on using them for motorcycle driving. I ordered XXL because I have long fingers but honestly these are slightly too big. These don’t run small. I own a pair of Revit gloves which are XXL and fit tight. These run big so ordered accordingly.
4.0,Very Robust Look
4.0,"Nice large face with a classic look.  Lightweight with a double clasp system.  However, links are too wide and don't allow for must adjustment in size around the wrist.  For the price, I can't complain and the look is stylish enough to outshine many other high priced watches"
4.0,This is a fun jacket but the sequins were not a true gold like the photo. They were more of an orange color.
4.0,Son had no complaints
4.0,"This is super soft and very cute. My only complaint is that it's a bit short through the torso. I'm 5'8 and I wear a women's XL or XXL (when something runs small). I expected a unisex XXL to be a bit baggy. It fit fine but I did feel like the length was too small, I am busty so perhaps that it partly to blame but I would not recommend this for someone with a long torso."
4.0,Enjoying my purchases!
4.0,"Not practical for everyday wear and not the most comfortable, but cute for cheap sunglasses. I will only be using these for when I'm laying out at the beach and that's about it."
4.0,"love the material, I should have a size bigger."
4.0,Nice belt not Michael Kors but def. good qulity.
4.0,"Pretty much as described! I chose the shorter length thinking that as I am only 5.4ft they would be longer on me but they were shorter than I expected (my bad judgement not fault of supplier!) However, I am disappointed in the material and in the fall of the pants. Just my taste, nothing wrong with pants but not as happy as I'd like! I wore them to my mothers day celebration and was complimented so they must look ok!!!"
4.0,"This dress came yesterday and I am happy to say, it fits, it's light, it's adorable! I love it! I'm usually a US small,  boy am I glad I read the reviews because it does run small! I got a Medium and it fits perfect."
4.0,"I really like Ilaria.  This is the only Powerstrike one that I have done.  I own two of her Bodystrikes and I do like those better.  However, this was a great workout for an Intermediate level.  She cues well enough to follow along even on the more complex combos.  She is good at instructing form which I appreciate because if you do not focus and do these moves properly, you will get nothing out of it."
4.0,Great made and fits well. Very comfortable. Thank you
4.0,Very thick and warm. Soft on inside.
4.0,Fit as expected because I read others reviews. The jacket was on the larger side and pants were on the smaller size. The white boot cuffs did not fit around my calves. I was dissapointed because I dont have fat legs.
4.0,I like it functionality. I use it for recharge automatic watches.<br />I don't like the system to fix it inside the rewinding box.
4.0,"Got the purple. A very nice light- medium shade,  but not even close to the color pictured (included a picture to see color... ignore how poorly it fits,  we bought the wrong size by mistake)<br />My 15 year old says it is very comfortable,  and she and her sister really like the material it is made out of and say it is soft."
4.0,Where too small but not near as small as others I ordered. They came just like pictured and where really nice pants!
4.0,Fits really well love it
4.0,"This is such a beautiful wrap!! Spikerking Women’s Fashion Sarongs Style Beachwear is a great design idea.  My only issue is that it comes as a one size fits all, and it is just too small for me to wear.  I will pass it on to a family member who is much smaller than me, but I am disappointed that it did not fit me! ' Like I said, it is really a beautiful wrap and I love the material.  It is made well.  Just be sure to understand that it runs on the small side of sizes.<br />I hope you have found this review helpful to you. I have the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price or at times even for free in return for my fair and honest opinion. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and I receive no incentives or rewards. Every item is used and tested before I review it. My comments are sincere and are of my own opinion, or that of the family member I purchased it for. Thank You!"
4.0,Lots of compliments - beautiful color.
4.0,No box . No plug to go with wire charging.
4.0,Love them thamks
4.0,"My mother would disown me if I got a real one so this is my other option , also they were individually wrapped"
4.0,6/10<br />Gloves were super weird. The thumbs make no sense on them.<br /><br />Leather is good but the other fabric and stitching was kinda poor.<br /><br />Pants were kinda baggy spark is more of a slim fit.<br /><br />Necklace is too short for any human neck.<br /><br />I would be willing to pay more if you needed it make a better quality material and more love into the stitching overall though i actually like it. You pass.
4.0,"great price, nice product - a little short, but that's my bad."
4.0,"The product is lightweight. My son loves that it’s easy to put on, and he loves that he can put on his own shoes. On the flip side, this shoe slides on tiles."
4.0,Cute but wish it was a little smaller.
4.0,Slippers are very comfortable. I wear an 81/2 normally but ordered a7/8 and they are a perfect fit. I’m definitely happy with this purchase.
4.0,This ring is really cute.  The ears are sharp and very pointy.  It shipped really fast too.  I would recommend it.
4.0,"Not 100% what I expected , but looks great wearing."
4.0,Cute. Was given as a gift
4.0,"A+ seller and I absolutely LOVE my new wallet but I was somewhat disappointed in the stitching. It seems sturdy and well made but the front where the ball looking stitches are at are off/ununiform enough for my nonbaseball saavy girlfriend to even point it out. With that said, I would absolutely buy another one again If I lost this one. Its very slim and I was able to pack 8 cards (im sure I could fit a couple more) plus some cash into it and it was STILL smaller than my Nike Bifold wallet. Rawlings has been my go to brand for Baseball supplies for years and now I know where to turn for all my personal leather goods!"
4.0,"Purchased this shirt and received it within two weeks. Not bad. This shirt is light, will be perfect for a summer night with some shorts. Fits me well, Im about 5'5 almost 5'6 and the length fits right at the start of my jeans. Not too long, not too short. I like it!"
4.0,Hubby loves the jacket onlything he didn't like is the top zippers are not pockets keeps you really warm
4.0,Hard to get top to fit but once you do good product quick shipping
4.0,"It is roomy. I'm 5'5&#34; and 136, bought a small. I wouldn't wear it out as a long dress. Its too baggy. But its perfect for over pjs or underwear around the house and yard. Not warm. Jersey knit, not sweatshirt fabric."
4.0,I got this for my friend for a Hawaiian party for my mom
4.0,not sure if this is 100% leather. It is well made I love the color and style. I have received compliment's from my firends
4.0,The slippers are soft and warm but way too big.
4.0,"It's a really nice dress...decent quality for the price. I'm 130lbs and 5.4&#34;, purchased size 8 and it fit perfectly! Not too tight n not too loose!"
4.0,"This tankini is cute and very needed if you snorkel, paddle or go in any water that might have a rough bottom. Ideal for surfers. This has sun protection, rash guard and is quick dry. As with all swimwear, rinse after wearing, let dry and when you get home, hand wash in gentle detergent and hang to dry. This will keep your swimsuit looking best."
4.0,feels so nice on my skin
4.0,"Nice hat, thin and lightweight."
4.0,"love this sweater, it's almost like I'm back in the 50's or 60's.  It's very soft, and comfortable.  This sweater can be worn with anything, I wore my sweater with a slim skirt, and I received many complements on it."
4.0,Sleeves are a little small but other than that good shirt
4.0,"The fabric is quite soft and fits well according to the sizing chart.  The design is very cute and eye catching.  The burgundy color is a bit more pink in hue than the picture shows.  Nice quality.  Washes and dries well, too."
4.0,Fits good. Sides not too long or short. A good buy
4.0,"Will not keep you warm (and I’m saying this from tropical Hawaii) but would be OK for wind protection, a slight drizzle."
4.0,"I was not able to use these glasses.  I was looking for a blue tinted lens to counteract florescent lighting for a Sensory Processing Disorder.  From the inside when looking through them, they were brown.  On the positive side, they were a good shape and matched my glasses.  They came in a nice case for protection and storage.  The outside was a reflective mirrored blue."
4.0,Amazing!!! Lights up and has a volume adjuster so you can change how loud you speak compared to how much it lights up. Takes 2 AAA's and fits great
4.0,Like this swimsuit I just wish the sizing was better. I ordered a large to fit my larger hips but only the top fit and the bottoms were way too tight on my waist. If you can find the right sizing it would be a good swimsuit. I say order at least a size up. Construction was okay. The top looks like it's going to split or rip where the cups meet. Giving 4 stars because I can wear the top with other bottoms and the seller helped with the problem.
4.0,"The necklace part itself breaks easily and had to be replaced with a different string and chain a few times. The One Piece logo charm itself is really nice in color when you first get it but keep out of sun and water, it will change colors over time but a lot quicker if you do not take care of it. Logo itself is durable and lasts a while. Would be a great gift or just to keep as a necklace."
4.0,"Very pretty dress... I got it in pink and beige.  The pink is a little lighter than the photo.  Very body conscious material so if you don't want it to be too tight, order up a size.  (I'm 5'5&#34;, 130# - boyish figure and ordered medium.)  I like the texture a lot - sort of horizontal ridges.  Definitely need to wear something underneath that won't show lines and prevents seeing through as the light colors are a little bit sheer.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the material is just a little rough and not as silky as I'd like.  Otherwise, a good deal for the price.  I haven't washed it yet so I can't comment on whether or not it will hold up."
4.0,These worked out as a great Xmas gift. They were a little bigger than I expected but that should make them much sturdier and durable to all the traveling they will see.
4.0,"I ordered an x-small even though I normally wear a small, and it was still to big for me. Didn’t take too much effort to take it in though."
4.0,"Order according to what the size chart stated and it was a little big in the stomach area.  Couldn't get as tight as I liked.  Luckily I have another waist cinched so I put that on over it with the albolene and I am good.  So I will say the SMELL is bad, but I washed it and it was gone.  Second I am not much of a sweater, like running in 95° weather and I don't sweat; with this on I am sweating just sitting down.  It will make you sweat.  I can't say that I have lost weight but with the Albolene and this my skin in that area looks tighter and smoother."
4.0,Gave as a gift to a beagle lover and they were thrilled. Love the colors and the design. Slightly pricey for socks but made for a cute addition to a gift!
4.0,like these and use them every summer!
4.0,"First of all, I ordered an extra large and received a large so that stinks. Honestly too much of a pain to try and correct this. Even for a large it's still small. I would order at least one size up from what you normally wear. Other than that its nice. The color is red-ish and white yarn weaved together. It looks pink from far away. Generally nice sweater. Not the softest but not scratchy. Just a general cotton sweater. Decent for the price."
4.0,"Its a cute bodysuit and fit as expected, but the seller picture makes it seem a darker red, like a burgundy but it is actually a bright red, like a fire truck. Will still wear, just wish the color was more accurate to the picture."
4.0,It’s too tight for extra large. I will have to return it for larger size . I love the color but size nit good for me. Need bigger
4.0,"just ur standard septum ring. a little longer than i had anticipated and not as thick, but still works and hasn't fallen out like my other rings despite the fact that i lost the little rubber stoppers almost immediately."
4.0,So glad the only size available was XL.  I bought this for my teen who likes over sized tops.  This XL actually fits more like a woman’s medium!  It would have been too tight if I had gotten any smaller size. Otherwise it’s soft and good quality.
4.0,"Great necklace, very pretty but just a little on the small side. Normally I would expect a pendant to be slightly bigger than the equivalent earrings though this one appears to be the exact same size. The detail is nice, and the picture is fairly accurate. Just beware that the pendant is only slightly larger than my thumb nail (I am a male with average sized hands). As it is, I am sure my girlfriend will love it when I finally give it to her. Well worth the price if you like the design and style."
4.0,"Fits great, has a nice head opening to drape over you. Needs to be washed a few times it’s a bit rough at first"
4.0,It's so cute! Took about 1 week to get here and I love it
4.0,"good quality, but a little shorter than I expected and a little small for size 11"
4.0,A little too big for a 1 year olds hands. Difficult to get them to put their thumbs in the thumb slot. They are waterproof though which is good for little toddlers who fall down alot.
4.0,The watch band is of good quality and looks great.  The pins that were sent with the band were not of good quality and we had to replace them with stronger ones.  This band would get 5 stars if the pins sent with it were stronger.
4.0,"Bought these when Costco stopped stocking their version and my last pair wore out.<br />Four stars for value; three for quality. They don't fit my particular frames perfectly, but it's good enough. I was able to put a little bend in the center piece that improves the fit a bit. I did snap one of the lenses out when taking them off once, but I was able to replace it and the problem hasn't repeated. They're actually fairly dark, and do the job pretty well."
4.0,Darling little ring! I love the paw imprints at the back of the ring.
4.0,"You get what you pay for, that being said its ok. Shipping took forever"
4.0,"i would have loved this but it just did not fit right. i am size Large usually, 38C breast, could definitely get this dress on, it  fit my waist and hips, but the chest was soooooooo small wayyy too tight.  if you are an american size large be careful. i gladly would have gotten an XL once i realized their L is too small for an american large, but it doesn't come in XL. very cute otherwise."
4.0,"I was looking for a skirt to wear in public. I ordered in red and pink. I honestly looked all over for a size chart with the waist and length measurements but didn't find one. After I received the skirts, i found it but see the listing was updated so maybe it wasn't there before. Anyways, this skirt is very short. 12 inches. I am 5'7 and a size 1 (about the same size as model). The skirt looks like its at least mid waist but even when I have it low waist its still too short to wear in public. I wear short stuff, so when I say too short to wear in public I mean my booty is showing. If you're looking for something high waist, you definitely can't wear this unless its lingerie. If you're shorter you can probably wear out but it would be probably need to be worn low or mid waist. Also, this came extremely wrinkled. You will need a steamer to get them wrinkles and pleats looking good. I wouldn't try a normal iron since the fabric is thin and seems like it could be ruined"
4.0,a little high but they work!
4.0,"Love the style of these glasses, nice fit I have a M/large head but the lenses do cause visual distortion if you have sensitive eyes you may not be able to wear these."
4.0,"Super cute, but the material is ALWAYS wrinkled. Even if you spend the time ironing it, it gets wrinkled as soon as you put a seatbelt on or sit."
4.0,Fits smaller than size wanted. Just have to friend. But is a nice shirt in person.
4.0,Somewhat larger than expected but still adequate
4.0,Got an XL. It’s cute. A little baggy.
4.0,"These look nice and help provide support for my feet. I wish they had half sizes, and I would probably buy a size up next time. They seem to run a little small."
4.0,Fine experience and product
4.0,"this mask is large and i have a fairly small face so i had to do some alterations.  other than that it is very well made, nice material, soft.  it has a place for a filter and even with filter in place i had no problem breathing.  if they had a smaller size i would buy again."
4.0,This worked great with an anime costume but it was a bit big/loose.
4.0,Like the look. Fits well
4.0,It's gorgeous but fits small go a size higher!
4.0,Very pretty earings
4.0,Nice warm and fashionable
4.0,Fits almost perfectly it does run big though I think I needed an XS the quality of fabric is on point 😃😃😃
4.0,"Nice, but that neckline goes way way too low for me.  Did not fit like the photo looks.  I could never wear this, but bigger chested women with a longer torso would look nice.  Maybe get some body tape so it doesn't fly open and result in a flashing wardrobe malfunction!"
4.0,Excellent transaction and Product
4.0,So Cute!  nice material and good quality
4.0,These are for my Mother.  They are tight but then that is how they are supposed to be.  Her at home nurse approved them for her. The zipper makes them easier to put on.
4.0,"Cute shirt, but from the picture, I thought it actually had some “bling” on it from sequins, so I was disappointed that there is no bling"
4.0,"I must say, it doesn't look exactly like the picture. I was expecting something more blue, but the blue is barely noticeable.<br />I wanted it to pop, but it doesn't. Therefore, it's fine, but it's not highly recommended it that was what you were looking for."
4.0,"Sooo warm and cute, but it does fit about a size/ size and a half larger than it should. I’m 5 4 118 lbs and the arms hang down past my hands with the small. Also wish it had pockets. Even so, I’m  thinking about keeping and having it altered, bc I love it that much."
4.0,Design is cute. Fabric is thick enough to not be see-through but the print on it is a little cheaply done. Works for a cover-up but not really a dress.
4.0,Gave as a present to a cat lover.
4.0,I ordered a size up and it fits my body like a glove. It's cropped to my belly button and is soft to wear.
4.0,This is a good bag to keep in the car for light groceries.  It is a bit thin & flimsy but it serves the purpose if you don't have too many groceries to haul.
4.0,great beanie for the price! arrived quickly.. the white is a crisp white so I am sure will get dirty because will be worn often!
4.0,I don't like the fact it says to hand wash or that I have to iron it but I still like it and will probably buy more.
4.0,Love this tutu its nice that there is a lining in the inside I am a size 10 in bottoms and I got a medium it fits perfect. Only negative thing was there was a funny smell which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars
4.0,My best friends loved the bracelets. I got them as a memorable for their 50th birthday. Too cute!
4.0,Skirt is a lot darker than the pic..
4.0,Nice watch for the price. Ended up getting a little rusty at the bottom where my wrist touches the metal but for what you pay for it's expected. Overall a nice and inexpensive watch.
4.0,"It looks nice, but there really should be information about how to use the clasp. Someone posted a URL that is now invalid. The picture on the Amazon product page is extremely unhelpful (and in a terribly low resolution). I can't believe the product manual doesn't cover this. It took me over an hour to figure out the three separate steps to unfurl and re-attach the clasp."
4.0,I liked the fabric and the color was so pretty!
4.0,"Usually a small, ordered small. Fit true. Quality seems good. Bottoms have good coverage. Top could use more padding. Interesting style but unless you got something going on up there, it’s a bit flattening."
4.0,These keychains were nice. I love the way they look. Though the strap was a little bigger but other than that i love it!
4.0,Pretty and as described. Spit easily.
4.0,I was satisfied with my purchase and I enjoy the compliments I get on all my rings.
4.0,"Some how I missed it in the description (even though it is there) that these were a one-sided print.  Why do manufacturers do this??!!!  Anyway, it is good that they are large and the colors are good.<br /><br />Love that they are large so they easily wrap around our face to keep out the desert storm.<br /><br />They do need to be washed before using them as they are very stiff and have a slight odor.<br /><br />I will probably re-evaluate if they do not soften up or if the odor does not go away."
4.0,"They are pretty cool, may not be the best quality but they are good enough."
4.0,"The hat came a little later than expected but it was shipping from overseas so it's understandable. The quality is awesome, as nice as some $40 hats I've seen in the mall. Very happy with this purchase :)"
4.0,Beautiful colors and it fits good. Only critique is that i would like for it to be made from cotton or another regular cloth.
4.0,It does everything you would expect A 30 dollar vest to do. Its not the best you can buy but for the price it's kinda hard to beat I can't really complain about anything with it.
4.0,"I live in boyshort underwear. I have loved them ever since they came out with them. I wear them with just about everything.<br />These are made from a very soft blend of nylon and elasta.  (which I assume is a brand of elastic) They hold their shape well, and they hold you in a bit, smoothing out your booty ; )<br />They are very stretchy, they appear to be extremely small when you take them out of the package, but they do stretch to almost double the size.<br />However, these are not sized in your typical &#34;American&#34; sizes. They do run somewhat small. If you wear anything over a size 10 or 12 pants these might not be comfortable for you. I have kind of big thighs, so these do ride up a bit. But that's me, not everyone is built alike.<br />They come in really great colors, and even a beige so you can wear them under white so you can't see them.<br />I really like them, even though I tend to buy cotton for the most part. I would purchase these again.<br /><br />*I received this product free to evaluate and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I don't guarantee a positive review. I personally try the items and give you my best evaluation. No other compensation was received."
4.0,Other vendors has a better ratio of working light than this one.
4.0,"I feel they are too sheer to wear alone, but I planned on wearing them like underwear anyway.  The pad reminds me of wearing a pad, but I purchased them for padding those sore areas I get when riding bike so that was expected.  If you can not feel the pad why get a padded short after all?  Feels comfortable when riding, does not bunch.  I hand wash mine and they dry quickly for next day use."
4.0,The Velcro on the bottom has a tendency to stick to everything.
4.0,"These Under Zero Women’s Winter Knitted Gloves quite unique since they can be worn it two different ways. The gloves can be worn folded; just fold the gloves and lace thumbs through the premade holes. This doubles the protection from the bottoms of your fingers to the end of the gloves. Unfortunately, the gloves are much shorter when worn this way. In many instances, wearing the gloves folded protects your hands from cold steering wheels, door handles or shovel handles. The gloves are touchscreen device friendly; the thumb and forefinger have touchscreen pads on them. The gloves can be worn longer which covers more of your forearms. Unfortunately, the thumb holes and seams show when the gloves are worn unfolded. These gloves are soft and one size should fit most hands. These gloves will be great for most of our winters here in the South. Unfortunately, I don’t think that these gloves are designed for really cold wet weather."
4.0,Its good but had some scratches
4.0,READ the size chart. I am a US Large\Asian XL. That is what I ordered and its fits perfectly. The materials are good for the price and the shirt is comfy.
4.0,So I do really like the dress however I searched for “sweater dresses” for the actual winter and this is not it. I wear an 8 (6 is usually too snug) bought the 8-10 and it HUGS. For my comfort and room to eat I would prefer a size up. Looks just as pictured and I’d consider buying again for sure!
4.0,"Very nice key-chain, solid, feels durable, but the bottle opener is &#34;soft&#34;. When I tried to open a bottle, the little chunk got a bit deformed, so I would not use it again."
4.0,"Country, thick socks – my daughter loves them"
4.0,Cute. Quality as expected. Is a little big on me (5’; 112 lbs; 32D) but works
4.0,"Hurts to wear for a long time , toes stick out a bit more than expected but overall , these are sturdy and a good product for their price."
4.0,"I love the color, and the feel.  But It is too tight/small around the bottom....so that it pulls back to the side or behind me, instead of hanging straight like the photo."
4.0,Came quickly and size was accurate outside of the sleeves which I expected so I'm not that bothered by it. Worked good for a Yandere-chan cosplay
4.0,Very Satisfied!
4.0,"Not bad , kids like em"
4.0,"good quality, simple design. perfect for everyday wear"
4.0,"Very comfortable, wrinkles easily, front pockets are kind of worthless because they have a Velcro split halfway down that allows things to fall out. But well worth the cost."
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress, however, it is way too big for my 1 month old.  I can only see it fitting on my baby when she’s 3 months old."
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; 135 lbs and I got the Small. Probably could've gone XS since this dress has a lot of room in it. I am happy with the Small though, and with a brown belt and some heels you can really dress it up. It's the perfect casual and comfortable dress."
4.0,"What the other reviewers said. $30 is a lot of money for what is essentially a piece of elastic and a plastic buckle; but, it does what it is supposed to do, which is hold your pants up. I'm surprised there are not similar products on the market but I guess Arcade found a niche and seems like a good company. But a little competition wouldn't hurt!"
4.0,"What and aweful smell! It took two washes to get the terrible smell out. Once on, the jeans are comfortable and very stretchy through the legs. The distressing is well placed so your not putting your toes through it when pulling them on. But, the cut is odd. When I walk, the material below the zipper pushes outward and creates and aquward 3D V shape right at the crotch. I tried to show it in the pic where Im turned to the side. Its actually more pronounced than the photo shows when I walk. I will keep the pants but I can only wear them with long shirts that cover the bottom of the zipper. Thus the 4 stars rather than 5."
4.0,"Arrived quickly. Works and fits well. Was expecting tougher material like a Lifeproof case, but overall a good product. And 1/4 of the price!"
4.0,This watch is comfortable and pretty.  I've had it for a couple of months and am pleased with it. The watch face has pretty gold markings that are easy to read but no so big that it looks ridiculous.  Good buy for the price.
4.0,"Nice, soft, comfy pants. My only complaint is that the waist is a little tight. I ordered a M and I have a 28inch waist. The rest of the pants fit great....hoping the waist will stretch a bit with wear."
4.0,I Thule the material and quality seems good. Nice style. It does run large. Normally am a 3x but returned for a smaller size for top to fit snug around my Chest and back. It must come from Asian seller. They didn’t take back would be more expensive so the credited me 5$ and told me to keep it. I’ll see if I can hem it to make tighter.  Nice suit though
4.0,"The material is this and will keep you warm on those cold mornings.  I good this because of the cheap price and the hood.  My other robe was great, but my bald head would still be freezing the morning.  The hood fixed the problem.  The only problem I have with it is it only comes in the one size.  Granted, I'm your average Joe, so I was okay.  However, a little more room would have been nice.  Don't get me wrong it fits fine, but could be roomier.  I'm 5-9, slight muscular build.  The material could be softer.  If you haven't felt the ultra soft counter part, you may not notice.  All in all it's a good rope, and on top to that you can't beat that price,"
4.0,"This costume is really cute! Not too short and great pleats. The fabric is actually substantial. I am fairly conservative and don't like snug clothes. Being an athletic size 4, I ordered the Large. Perfect."
4.0,Little too curvy for me. Good quality product!!
4.0,"This is a nice dress for work or parties. But it is not a wrap dress as i says in the description. It is just a V-neck dress. I like the fit and length of the dress. It is soft, stretchy, and comfortable. I hot navy blue and t is not sheer or see through. It is flattering and versatile.<br /><br />I recommend this dress."
4.0,These socks are comfortable and reasonably priced.  I kept two pair and gifted three!
4.0,"I love this dress and it fits well. I'm 5'7"" and it is the perfect length for me. And it has POCKETS!!! Yay!! Only downside is that it has started to look a bit faded after only a few washes."
4.0,"The adhesive is very sticky, it does give you instant cleavage and does look nice under clothing and such. It does not provide support, so if your needing your girls to be lifted this will not work for you. I wore mine under a bralette for a very low cut open back romper and it worked great for that."
4.0,Thedes masks have a great Thanksgiving them on them but they run a little big
4.0,"Another cute belt purchase from this brand/seller. The photo DOESN'T lie. It's a rich, true green color. So perfect for my Spring/Summer wardrobe. Satisfied customer!! Super fast shipping!!"
4.0,Not for people with wide feet
4.0,Es elegante pero la parte de la correa no es duradera.
4.0,"As stated by others...the product description is a bit self-contradictory.  It is correct that the belt is 51&#34; long.  It is NOT correct that it is is suited for waist sizes up to 35.4.  I take a 36&#34; in jean/pant sizes and this belt had at least 6&#34; excess that needed to be cut off and STILL leave around 4&#34; &#34;excess&#34; to tuck through the first belt loop on my pants.  Shrug.  Maybe it's now &#34;COOL&#34; to have a 10-12&#34; of excess belt hanging down in front of you.  I'm not a fashion-conscious guy so it was not cool to me.<br /><br />I ordered a second one in case it was an error on the part of the shipper but it came in the same way so it will get sent back.  (Funny thing was, it was different material  (tighter weave, different color tab on the end and greater nylon content so it looked more like plastic whereas the first one looked more like cotton.)  So also be aware that these do not come exactly alike in case you want more than one.<br /><br />Having said all that...it's a pretty decent belt for the money and if it really came in my size, I would have given 5 stars.<br /><br />In THIS case I had to take it to an alterations place and have it shortened.  (Simple process of cutting off the buckle, cutting off excess material, reattaching the buckle."
4.0,"The waist has two parts and the bottom bunches up to the top of you sit down, bend over or move even a little. It's really annoying to have to keep pulling bit down. Otherwise a cute dress."
4.0,"Why cant they ever look like the picture, I'm buying another one now hoping it's as good as its picture, you really do get what's you pay for 🙄"
4.0,"These are a good blance of quality and price, though I was hoping they woudl be 100% cotton:  they are still nice and light for summer sleeping."
4.0,"These are good for the price. The colors are vibrant and the reflective stripes do their job. If I am not wearing my hard hat, these are comfortable. If I am wearing this under my hard hat, the pressure of the band makes these a bit scratchy. Maybe if I wash them they may soften a bit."
4.0,Light weight. Easy to use.
4.0,"I am a little disappointed because the color of the actual mask is darker than this picture makes it seem. The picture shows that under the eye is more of a pink/magenta color. The mask that came is a darker purple, but it is still pretty and will serve the need for this party. I also, had to take a hot glue gun to reattach some of the feathers, but that's a quick fix so it didn't bother me."
4.0,"Super cute dress! It has a cheery vintage look, true to the pictures. The colors and print are beautiful. The lapel is a bit larger than I prefer but still looks nice. Decent quality polyester and not too thick for summer. I love that the buttons don't gape and I'm a 36 DD. I'm 5'3 and it comes just below my knee. Pockets are a bit small but still fun, best suited for lipgloss or other small items.  I would buy this dress in other prints if offered."
4.0,I really like these for the times I want to dress up a little more.<br />they are beautiful.  As pictured
4.0,"Good quality fabric, as described. The printing on mine was offline so it’s blurry. Not sure if all are that way."
4.0,Soft very comfortable
4.0,"Nice size, matched necklace I purchased. Was light, not heavy on ears."
4.0,Cute Christmas socks. Comes in a festive box ready to gift. Pretty good quality for the price.
4.0,"sturdy..great durable outer material.. I wish the ""snap"" would be louder when hit correctly.. this would be more satisfying.  but still good product"
4.0,These are so cute. They arent crazy comfortable but that is because the type of heel it is.
4.0,Perfect for the Joyce Myer Sparkle & Shine event.
4.0,"The zipper makes these socks much easier to put on than other compression socks - they're for my mom who has very fragile skin that tears easily, and they allow us to compress her legs without tearing her skin putting them on.  We put a thin knee sock or nylon under them so the zipper doesn't catch on her skin."
4.0,They are cute but definitely not as shiny as the photo
4.0,Nice item thank you
4.0,"Absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this necklace. It is my favorite owl necklace. Only reason took one star off, there is no hasp, it's slid over your head. My head isn't big but it's tight to slip over. (I plan to replace the chain, will be easy to do this swap out)"
4.0,"I love the authentic look, but was smaller than I anticipated."
4.0,The feel was great.
4.0,"The color is a darker purple than pictured but the necklace is very well made, beautiful, and arrived before estimated. overall I am happy."
4.0,Love the style and the fabric is soft. I ordered the smallest size and it seemed a little big.
4.0,The material is a little thinner than I expected. But nice fit.
4.0,"This tie pattern is a nice alternative to the usual stripes or medallions. It has a metallic sheen. The fabric is thick, which you may really appreciate, or find less than ideal if you don't want a large knot."
4.0,"I was interested in these crops because of the One Size, as I just had a baby.  The material is great - it is a soft, stretchy crepe material that is wrinkle free.  The crops are dressy enough to wear to the office.  The pockets are a huge plus.  My only complaint about the crops is the rise is too long.  I have to wear the pants very high up (a few inches about my belly button) due to the rise being too long.  I should also add that I'm 5'10&#34; so the rise issue would likely be worse for petite or normal statured women.  (You can see it in the picture.)<br /><br />As a person on the larger end of the size range, I am happy with the fit.  They are still flowy around my hips.  I can also see these working well after I lose 15 lbs. or another size."
4.0,Always get compliments when I wear it.
4.0,"I really like this blouse, but was surprised to see that it's see-through.  You'll have to buy something to wear underneath unless you want your bra and bulges (if any) showing through very easily.  The photo is deceptive in that you can't see through the shirt the model is wearing.  It's still a very nice blouse, though.  If you're willing to buy just an inexpensive tank top in a darker blue color, it's perfect!  That's what I did and I'm going to wear it a lot.  I've already had several compliments on the beautiful blue color."
4.0,Love the look of this romper. I did shrink a little although it was washed in cold water and hung to dry. I was able to stretch the legs a little but can no longer wear to ankles.
4.0,"Good fit, well constructed, but it is not snow white - more like eggshell or an off-white. It's still a very nice robe, but don't expect it to match your towels."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely darling. The pattern is so feminine and pretty, and style is VERY flattering and flow-y and it sits right above/right at the knee.<br /><br />My two dislikes:<br /><br />1. The loops that hold the belt in place are situated weirdly high. If I put the belt through the loops, then the belt will sit over my ribs instead of at the waist.<br /><br />2. There is ZERO stretch in the cap sleeves. So while they are super pretty, you can't lift your arms all the way because there is no give.<br /><br />Ultimately I loved the dress but I returned it because of the tight sleeves. I bought this dress for a wedding, and I wouldn't be able to dance like that."
4.0,Nice product. Doesnt tangle hair while bleaching.
4.0,"The pendant itself is stunning, the chain it comes with eh, doesn't last more than a day.  Definitely put the pendant on another silver chain.  Totally worth the cheap price and wait time in delivery. All the colors are really beautiful.  I think I saw these same necklaces for $9.99 on Groupon.  So these are a steal if you can wait for delivery."
4.0,Love them!!!! They are so what I was looking for and at a terrific price!!!
4.0,The earrings are pretty. But from the picture they look completely round which is what I wanted. But they are kind of flat in the back which gives them an oblong kind of shape.
4.0,Good quality and inexpensive ankle bracelet
4.0,"I gave these a 4-star rating because they aren't anything amazing, but they aren't half bad. I ordered cheap glasses and I got cheap glasses. These really are a ""you get what you pay for"" type product. They are pretty light and plastic feeling and the arms are loose and uneven. But for the price, they block the sun and look all right.<br /><br />A couple of things I would mention, first off, they're small. I'm on the large side as a person, but the nose pads are really close together so they sit a little strange. Also, the temple width is narrow, I had to spend a few hours bending them to be wider to fit my face. Along with that, the arms are short, they have a really poorly made ""adjustability"" feature, but in general, they're a bit short.<br /><br />I'd say these would be great for a kids costume or as a set of beater sunglasses that you can drop without worrying."
4.0,"I LOVE THIS , great material and fit , only problem is In a spot or two you can see at the crease (your nipple) if you look hard enough. I would probably wear pasties under this ."
4.0,"Definitely need to size up, but it I just Love it!"
4.0,"These are perfect for my 10 month old who started walking on her own. I bought up a size (size 4), so I anticipated them being a little big, but this way she'll actually be able to wear them for more than a month. :) They don't seem to trip her up, and she's able to go outside when it's rainy or wet and her feet stay dry. They are relatively easy to get on and off. The only reason I took it down to 4 stars is because the velcro that goes around the top is already a little tight even though the shoes have room to grow. I'm not able to fully close the velcro, so one of the boots will occasionally slip off. Otherwise, this are great little rainboots!"
4.0,"I really love how light it is. I totally forget I'm wearing it. Just got it completely wet. Looking forward to adding my own charms to the loops. Con... it was extremely hard to get one ball off to out it on. Pro... light, danté and pretty."
4.0,Came earlier than expected
4.0,My son liked because it's easily adjustable
4.0,I bought this for my nephew. I put it on a black leather strap and he loved it.
4.0,just a right size to me and looks good though it's quite a heavy one.
4.0,So cute. Bought for my nephew and it is adorable
4.0,Needed something for night time. I drive between states often and head lights kill my eyes over time. This item has worked nicely
4.0,very classy the rose is rich in color love the material also ! great for spring with a small shell underneath<br />for coverage
4.0,"A very good balance between class a functionality. A little tedious to setup at first, but very pleased with my purchase of my BUREI bm-7003-01E day and date."
4.0,"Love this bracelet,  only problem is the lettering is fading. I never take it off though,  so that could be some of the reason."
4.0,"A little fake looking, but cute."
4.0,"Very nice shirts; I really liked the silky fabric that wasn't at all flimsy or see-through. Easily 5 stars if the sleeves hadn't been a bit short, necessitating a return. I'm 5'9.5"" tall and have long limbs, granted, but I don't run into the problem of skimpy sleeve length too much anymore. I'd gladly order this brand for styles with short, 1/2, or 3/4 sleeves but not with long sleeves."
4.0,"Got these for my 3 year old. They work great. He loves them. Only problem is that they are kind of hard to get on. He's not able to put the on himself. I can put them on him but when I can't, for example, when I'm driving, he isn't able to do it himself which is disappointing"
4.0,I love it but for a big purse doesn't work that well. This is better for a small crossbody bag.
4.0,"Love the purse. It's a bit too hard, but overall it's great. Has different pockets for separating items. Which I like."
4.0,"Nice shirt, soft and true to size."
4.0,The sun protection provided by this hat encouraged me to try it for my husband. The fit was snug and the hat is not adjustable. Sun protection is good and best of all it is packable. It is a nice looking hat in a rich brown color. Stitching and fabric are very nice.
4.0,Cute novelty necklace for Dark Souls fans.
4.0,Cute top for summer!
4.0,"I have wide shoulders, hard for me to get women's clothes that fit.  It was a lovely dress, I loved the feel of the material, but I couldn't move my arms.  It would fit a normally proportioned person."
4.0,"These are great.  I've taken them grocery shopping with me many a time now and they fit quite a bit in them.  Side handles make it easy to load them in and our of grocery carts.  You may have to play a bit of tetris tfinding the best way to stack, but that's not too bad, to be honest.<br /><br />The only downside, as many have noted, is the dang zipper.  Just be aware of it and don't try to yank it closed.  Take the extra 5 seconds to zip it carefully and you won't have problems."
4.0,"They are great, not see through, even though I worked the light one might be. Only complaint is they could be thicker imo."
4.0,"Beautiful stone. what holds it, could be of better design though."
4.0,Soft material nice
4.0,I love it so much! It's so much fun to swim in! And they're really pretty. And it's great quality. The material is just like swim suit material. But not so sure it's worth $200 to everyone. I'm glad I bought it but I think it was quite a bit overpriced.
4.0,"Socks are a little tight but appear to be of good quality.  I bought the three pair set earlier and those fit my size 10EEE feet better.  They must use different factories to make these but they're decent for the price.  Guys need to beware that the colors are a little feminine if that kind of stuff bothers you, as for me, I don't give a rip about that!"
4.0,"It looks good, and feels comfortable. You can tell it's not American though because the zipper is on the opposite side in comparison to your US standard zippers. Out of the package, you can feel immediately it requires a wash. Not to be used as a windbreaker as it goes right through it.<br />One thing I wish they did was to stitch the interior of the pocket to the jacket. When the wind blows when unzipped with your hands in your pocket, it makes the product to appear incomplete.<br />Otherwise it does look pretty sharp. I don't regret my purchase."
4.0,Nice little dress. Will be ordering from this brand again
4.0,Good Quality watch band. Would order again from here
4.0,This Satchel is spacious and seems durable. The only thing that I dislike are the buckles on each end. they just come loose for no reason.
4.0,"Quality is really nice, im not suee how long its gonna last as i haven't tried wearing it for long period of time."
4.0,"Beautiful dress better than the picture, fast delivery"
4.0,Great fit and most comfortable pants ever....
4.0,Very very pleased. 😊
4.0,Beautiful design and quality. Very pleased.
4.0,Cute! Fits well and the color is as shown.
4.0,"The dress fit a bit more snugly through the bodice than I anticipated based on the sizing chart. But the fabric is good quality, and the dress is very cute! I recommend getting a petticoat underskirt or crinoline...it really makes the dress pop."
4.0,"I really love these! The lines and colors contour my legs perfectly!! The only downfall is they do run a little small. I’m 5’3”, 135 pounds and I have a 27 inch waist and typically wear a size 4 jean. So the fact that these ran a bit small on me was disappointing. They need more range in the size!"
4.0,Was so cute but fits small and I ordered 1 size up
4.0,fun lightweight scarf for added style to any outfit
4.0,"THESE ARE SORT OF SMALL GLASSES, YET THEY FIT WELL AND WORK AS PROMISED"
4.0,Just got them. They look like the photos. They’re very light and pretty.
4.0,Alright so I love these but my only complaint is the sizes aren't labeled so it's a bit of work to figure out which one is what size. It's doable but a bit annoying. The only thing I would change is this. I love them 100% otherwise. I guess I could measure them and label the bags myself but meh.<br /><br />Love em!
4.0,Alot for price
4.0,Size was too small went up 1 size and then was too big. Lightweight which is good hopefully they hold up not sure yet.
4.0,I really like the style of this dress.  Unfortunately it was too big for me.  I normally order a large but in this dress I had to size down to a medium.
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; so I ordered the small. They fit great around the waist but are a bit too lose around the legs as well as too long. They bunch up at the ankles. I have no problem with the ankle part because I half expected it since I am short and normally have that problem anyway. I'm not crazy about them not being as snug as they should be though. The material is soft, breathable, and very comfortable. The top can be folded over and also has a hidden inner pocket to store your card or similar items. I love the shade of purple. I was sent these in exchange for an honest opinion."
4.0,"Im 5'4"" and ordered the x-large as the seller suggested. Usually wear a med/large.  Outfit is cute, but the pants are extremely long.  I had to cut at least 7 inches off.  Ridiculous!"
4.0,These are pretty good nothing negative to say only wish they come the letters where you can spell out different things ..
4.0,Love having a denim skirt and with pockets!
4.0,"Great quality but they run small in my opinion. I bought these for my Mom and they fit her thankfully.  I could not even get my hands in them at all. I think they are more like S/M than M/L as I normally have no issues with gloves being too small. Very soft, warm and my Mom loves them so that's great:)"
4.0,Got this got to wear for the fall and winter months. The coat is a little big I would size down a size. The coat is the perfect length to wear with dresses. The color is exactly as pictured.
4.0,"Easy to install and removing links was stait forward with the tools provided.<br />Its pulled a hair or two but not to the point I wouldn't use it.<br />It really beats the original band that comes with the sunto watch.<br />As of this review,  I have worn the band for one full week."
4.0,"Initially I was impressed, its a lighter weight sweatshirt and the overall quality is good but not great. The colors are bright and look as shown in pictures. The only flaw is that due to im assuming the material its made from, after washing once it pills pretty bad on the outside (The little fuzz balls all over) giving it a faded/worn look and cheap feel. If you never washed it it would be great! I think the price is way too high for the quality of the product. It should be half this price."
4.0,Really feels nice
4.0,"These really are lovely for the price. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because one of the hinges that holds the year wire in is a little loose and I'm afraid it might not last that long, just long enough to go over the return window. But I'm taking a chance keeping them because I like the way they sparkle."
4.0,I was not exactly what I was expecting but it's good.
4.0,Recommend using with sunscreen since there are mesh areas on the hat. that let in sunlight. Very comfortable and light weight though
4.0,"Very popular with my friends, especially my Greek friends."
4.0,Color and print not as shown here. Soft cloth.
4.0,My granddaughter was thrilled. Loved the design @ the top.
4.0,"This has become one of my go-to work shirts (because it's all you see on a webcam).  Simple, understated, with the nice twist at the bottom, it's definitely one you can have that's somewhat dressy but still comfortable.<br /><br />The color is a light beige and I haven't noticed any fading yet.  Fit was ok, maybe a tad baggy but that's fine.  I think the twist makes it seem more so.  It has gone through multiple wash/dry cycles with no issue or shrinkage.<br /><br />Cute shirt, definitely a good one to add to the wardrobe.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2021"
4.0,"Love the colors, quality, and the customer service. This item came quickly, was as expected and a real treat after a failed order with a different seller."
4.0,"I bought this for a Mardi Gras costume.  We have a regular group that dresses as Princess Leia yearly.  I decided to invest in an upgrade on my wig.  This wig was very well made, but it was a little large.  I do have a smaller size head and it is one size fits all.  This wig should make it through a few years of costuming."
4.0,"saw the superbowl commercial with colbert for pistachios, being a fan of bright colors pretty much went on a man hunt for a pistachio colored tie saw this one got it and immediately put a half windsor knot on it first opportunity i get to rock it i will be doing so, only thing its a very thin tie its not very thick as i thought it would be its more of a silky feel and weight but thats not really a draw back it dosent bother men just hope it helps one of you people who are considering purchasing this product."
4.0,They are a little snug but I guess they wouldn't do what is needed if they weren't.  A little hard to get on but love that they have the zippers to assist with putting on.
4.0,I ordered this item for my best friend and plan to give her as Christmas gift. The shipping is very fast. It looks nice and the design is very comfortable. I took one star off because I think it's still a little pricey if you add up the shipping. But it's hard to find this kind of design in store and it deserves 4 stars.
4.0,is beautiful but the top is small
4.0,Great for when you are losing weight.  They don't last really long but they are very inexpensive.
4.0,Bought this for a trip that have since cancelled -  I did not get a chance to wear in the rain.  I can tell you it fits nicely into the little pouch which is great to pack - about the size of 2 pair of socks.  So travels great.  The color it nice too  - husband can identify me amongst all the darker raincoats.
4.0,"So very comfortable, so many compliments!"
4.0,Gift. They liked it
4.0,"To start, absolutely loved the print on the shirt!  Only gave it 4 stars because it fits small on the top."
4.0,"Read other reviews saying this runs small so I ordered a medium for my daughter's, short, petite, 13 year old friend's bday. I was absolutely dumbfounded when it arrived and it looked like my 250lb could have probably fit into it(am I really exaggerating though? Lol). It was definitely bigger than I thought. Possibly more a mens medium. Thank goodness its in style(again! Oh!) to tie them around you and shorten them and do many other things to make it fit. The material was thin, but soft. The color was vibrant! (I ordered the yellow) It was perfect. The screen print seems decent. As a gift? The recipient was very happy with it."
4.0,Love it! Very durable and looks great!
4.0,Zipper broke as soon I as put it on.
4.0,"Cozy, handsome, wearing well."
4.0,easy to change and put on/off. lightweight
4.0,Love this shirt!  Fits great and can accessorize it with any color tank top underneath.
4.0,"I got this band in the different colors of metal.  It is really pretty in person.<br />It fits my watch band perfectly.<br />The only thing I don't love (if I would have paid attention to the picture - I would have known), the band has a top magnet and a bottom magnet to get on your wrist.  I checked out if a metal decorative band would work and mine didn't go over the end.<br />All in all, beautiful band that I will use :)"
4.0,Happy with the mask just one of them came unstitched after one use
4.0,Didn't even try to use the cord that came with it. I fashioned it onto a keychain instead and that works for me.
4.0,"Lovely! Pockets are great. Bought a large, and T-shirt material top just a bit too wide for my 36B chest. Gaps under my arms. Also a tad short waisted for my long waisted 5’8” 150 lbs self. Having my shorter bustier friend try on. If it doesn’t fit her, I’ll sew in a seam or two. Because it really is a lovely little dress."
4.0,"It's pretty much true to size. It doesn't breath much so its very warm to wear around. The zipper is small and tends to get caught in the collar. Also you may need a hand to zip and unzip. It would have been nice if the red &quot;panties&quot; had been included as part of the costume, but it's nothing you can find at the local Walmart.<br />I ordered a medium, I'm 5'7&quot; 137lbs, 34C, 29&quot; waist and 36&quot; hips. To help others better decide if the size is right for them."
4.0,Loved these Tops!
4.0,I love the materal and feel of these pants.  My only complaint is that the G Hook of the belt does keep the tension as much as I like.  I might swap it out for a G Hook with a wave pattern to see if that helps!  Good pants overall.
4.0,Nice for the price but rip SO easily!
4.0,Nice shoe if you have a  super narrow foot. Good quality for the price.
4.0,Next size up. Run small.
4.0,I like light weight<br />Dislike I have to put the strap and tight .I wish they have home only to put the straps
4.0,Super cute love these shoes
4.0,Pin is smaller than expected and heavy. Needs to be pinned to a coat or thick shirt so it doesn’t pull the fabric. Cute nonetheless.
4.0,"So... okay. Im not sure if this will make any sense at all, but when I received mine i was beyond excited to try it on. I put on the shorts first and they fit wonderfully. However when I put the top on, the sides where my bust is stuck out some and it fits a little too big on me. Im 5’1” and 104lbs, a very petite size so i ordered a small like i usually would. I dont really know what went wrong because if the bottoms fit, you would think the top would too but it just didnt. Does anyone know if I can send back and resize the top without returning the bottoms? I just really love this outfit and im super sad that it didnt go as planned. I leave for the beach tomorrow so sadly this wont be a full outfit 😔 any tips would be great help. Thank you!"
4.0,"Love the green. I wear it with black leggings, boots and scarf..love the whole outfit"
4.0,Really cute but fit is really small—like for a 2 or 3 year old so my tall yet slender 5 year old it didn’t fit so I had to return. Headband cute addition
4.0,"I really love this watch! It's easy to set and it gives you the option of 12 or 24 hour time. You can also set the date and watch the seconds. It also does not stay on all the time and you have to press a button to display the time but I think that is probably a great battery saver.<br /><br />I'm a female and this is a men's watch but it gave the illusion that it was adjustable. It is not and that's why I have given this product 4 stars instead of 5. It's one size fits all. It is about 2 notches too big for my wrist and I have a very small wrist. My friend has one as well and it fits his wrist perfectly but he also has a small wrist. So I'm warning all you large-wristed people out there, IT MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE FOR YOUR WRIST! Other than that, it's a perfectly good watch and it's nicely priced."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:aefd256370ae4ab862582f50df71027d]] Loved the navy blue but pink is to light almost a tan color not so happy with that color. The quality is nice though.
4.0,Bought it for the colors/design. Fits me fine
4.0,Beautiful color and very roomy but not too flattering around my waist. Very flowing.
4.0,"This hat is great for what I need it for, as a prop, but it can be used regularly if needed. It is pretty sturdy and holds its shape well."
4.0,It was too large to be flattering for me
4.0,"length was as pictured, color was true to picture however was a little opaque when worn. The material is great, overall really impressed!"
4.0,"They cover my feet perfect, the problem is that my calves maybe are too big and the socks roll sometimes. But I have several pairs and for now, no swollen legs or feet. So that’s one of the main purpose... Just careful if you have big calves, maybe you would have my rolling problem. 😬"
4.0,"Cute design. Lacked rubber backer to hold in place. Ok size, but dino is a little heavy; pulls just a bit on the earlobe due to weight."
4.0,Absolutely loved my phone cover.
4.0,"These are natural leather sewn sandals with a rubberized sole. Nice brown color. My husband says they fit well, but need to be broken in, like most leather shoes. They have an insole, not completely flat. He got his normal shoe size and they fit. The leather strap on the back might not be for everyone, however."
4.0,"Very comfy, the material is a thicker material which is a good thing rhey a made to last longer. Yea I definitely recommend"
4.0,This shirt is very cute BUT it does run small.  I ordered a XL and it fits more like a M/L.
4.0,Cost me almost as much in postage to return the shoes as I paid for them.  So Iam stuck with them😡  Shoes however are very well made.  E. Cronk
4.0,"I’m being generous when leaving a four star review. It more of a three and a half. The box came nicely wrapped. The pearl itself is beautiful, but the chain is more flimsy than dainty. I would expect something of a little higher quality especially for what I paid for the necklace."
4.0,"I took a risk ordering somewhere that had no reviews when I purchased. But it worked out, everything fit perfectly! The belt unfortunately did not match the cosplay but everything else is spot on. The overcoat is a tiny bit on the heavy side so it's probably going to be a pain in the summer at conventions, but I'm not worried about that much. All in all this costume was well worth it."
4.0,"This worked really well for a few months but recently the metal clip broke off so now we have to attach the little ring hook to a keychain instead of just clipping the car key case onto a purse, lanyard, etc. The case itself is still in great condition but I wish the ring hook had not broken off"
4.0,"I usually wear medium and I'm 5'8&#34;, 145 lbs. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. My only gripe is that the front has some tiny blue ink specks on the white parts. When worn, its not that noticeable so not that big of a deal."
4.0,"It's so pretty. It's made out of very thin material, and feels a little cheap. But then it is a cheap price so I didn't have really high expectations. Overall it's a nice fashionable scarf for cat lovers."
4.0,"The shoes were well made, sturdy and looked comfortable. Unfortunately, my feet did not have enough room width wise and l am not able to keep the size l ordered. I want to reorder when l figure out which size will work."
4.0,Product is great and there is exactly 100 but don’t get your hopes up for one specific charm because you’re not guaranteed to get it
4.0,"PRO : Well, this watch got me A LOT of compliments. Everyone stared at it and tried so see what kind of watch is is. It definitely seems to be an expensive watch.<br />CONS : The wrist band  started to wear off and eventually part of it broke. So now I have to search for a replacement.<br /><br />Overall : Would I buy this again? Hell yeah. Just with spare wrist bands."
4.0,Several layers for buffing and polishing.  It's worth purchasing to clean silver.
4.0,"I've ordered other tank tops for the summer, and an X-large turned out to be a small or medium in American sizes.<br />So I thought I'd be smart and order an XXXX-large and see how that fits.<br />Guess what? This brand actually has accurate sizing.<br />These are way bigger than I would've wanted, but I like them anyway.<br />Plus, I'm giving them an extra star for being accurate."
4.0,"cute, cozy and warm - the perfect length for draping and doing all sorts of fun ties.  A bit itchy but mostly just soft.  My only complaint is that I ordered the C pink and it has a yellow stripe running through it that is pretty much a neon yellow.  It's a bit jarring with the rest of the colors but not really noticeable unless you're up pretty close."
4.0,"I'm a strong supporter of the Baleaf brand so of course when i'm looking for joggers comparable to Zyia, Baleaf is my first stop to try their product.<br />So pros are:<br />-very soft fabric<br />-very comfortable and stretchy material<br />-fabric is middle of the road for thickness; so not as thick as the cozy joggers (zyia) but thicker than the dragfit brand.<br />Also, the waist band is more like a yoga type high-waist pants versus a mid-low rise waiste and no ties.<br /><br />i only gave 4 stars due to the thickness of the material.<br />they do run a bit big; if you want baggier, get your normal size; if you like a tighter fit, size down."
4.0,"Perfect size and length- fits true to size! Im 5 ft 0  110 lbs and its true to US sizing. Both pieces and be mixed and matched with your other clothing items. Very versatile and cute. The only drawback is that the sweater fabric is a little itchy and abrasive, like wool. Maybe try fabric softener and hang dry"
4.0,"Shade good, fashion wise cool. Fits my wide head"
4.0,"Great quality, nice size purse.. Only thing was the color was a little darker than pictured"
4.0,Beautiful. Kinda comfy. Gotta get used to feel of it.
4.0,"This is a cute dress to wear to work, on dates or just about anywhere you would wear a dress. It is soft and comfortable. I like the print, I like the comfort and it can be dressed up or down with accessories."
4.0,I like the design. The t shirt is a little boxy.
4.0,"nice fabric, not tight."
4.0,"usually break my glasses really quick however, these shades have been holding their own. but, the screw that ties on to the frame does come loose sometimes and i do need to tighten it once and awhile."
4.0,"Runs a little big. Even after washing it. I absolutely love the color. But could have gone with a small and it would have been a better fit for me. I don’t like baggy sweaters, but if you do I’d recommend going with your true size. I’m 4”11 - 138 lbs - 40C. Wouldn’t definitely buy again, just in a smaller size."
4.0,"Overall this is a pretty good belt.  I also have an elastic belt by Arcade that I LOVE.  This belt can probably be best described as almost, but not quite as good as my Arcade belt in every way but at a much lower price.  Many of things that I love about my Arcade belt apply.  It's thin, it has an easy-to-use buckle, and it's very comfortable.  The elastic belt material is thinner and not as strong as the Arcade belt.  My solution has been to adjust it to a slightly smaller size compared to my Arcade belt to get the right tension.  Again - not quite as good as the Arcade belt, but it works.<br /><br />Some reviews have mentioned the buckle size.  I have not had a major issue.  While it is a tight fit, I have worked it through the belt loops of several pairs of my pants/jeans without too much effort.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  If I needed a belt to use almost everyday, I would probably go with Arcade.  It's more expensive, but is slightly better in every way and I think it will last longer in an daily use situation.  As a second option, this belt works really well though, and for the price is a really good deal.  I think it's perfect as a different color alternate to my daily wear black Arcade belt."
4.0,"Good quality, runs a little large"
4.0,"A bit larger than I care for, but very pretty! Gave it to my daughter. She loved it!"
4.0,"I was looking for some casual ankle boots size 12.5, to be able to place my arch support into! They are Awesome!"
4.0,Im satisfied with it. I dont hate it but I dont love it. Its made more for a young teenager or a child. Other than that it shipped quickly and arrived safely.
4.0,I normally wear a size 8 or 10 on swimsuits so I bought a medium and it ended up being a bit larger than what I expected.
4.0,"The good about the ring is that it is very pretty and it hasn't discolored my finger at all. I love it.<br /><br />But I have been really disappointed that the gold flower faded really fast (within a month). You can barely tell it's yellow at all anymore. I thought the flower was made of yellow gold, but I guess it is just silver with a light gold plating.<br /><br />In spite of that, I still love the ring."
4.0,Pretty good I guess
4.0,"It's gonna work for my purpose, walking from the shower to the tent (so I don't have to stand on one leg and drag my shorts on the wet floor).<br />It's covering all my equipment while standing, a little short for sitting.<br />A little tight in the shoulders to put on or take off a t-shirt underneath it (it rides up in an unflattering fashion), but plenty of room to change shorts/pants/etc.<br />I'm 5'8&#34; - 225 probably a little bigger bore than the target demographic.<br />If you're a big or tall you might want something larger.<br />I'm keeping mine."
4.0,"I love the style & especially the pockets. However, the neckline is a bit higher than I thought. These are great for going out."
4.0,"This was a good price for a very comfortable wrap  skirt  with vibrant colors, tops and shoes easily matched. I received many compliments on this skirt, I bought 2, gave my daughter one, she loves it"
4.0,Have three of these outdoor shades. After 2-3 years the bracket that the wand fits in have all broken. I believe if the ring was made of metal rather than plastic they would last longer. Still satisfied with the product.
4.0,Not the best sweatshirt available but great for the price!
4.0,"Nice leather and lots of compartments.  Nice long strap too.  Holds lots of credit cards, money etc... phone fits on side pocket."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:8bc66b4d78071f536ed797fe17ae3209]] Almost 5 stars but my hat came with a stain didn’t want to return because I needed to wear my purse the same day I received it.
4.0,Don't know yet. It's a Christmas present hasn't been given yet.
4.0,"Nice bathing suit. The top isn't all that great, could definitely use more support, but I already knew that from the other reviews. Otherwise I'm happy with it and how it looks."
4.0,Very comfortable fit love the style
4.0,"O.K., I'll admit George Lucas has pretty much been swayed by the power of the green to the point where he'll stamp the name ""Star Wars"" on anything that requires a check or money order or major credit card for the masses to sample.  But still, every now and then, once in a great while, the licensing lackeys at Lucasfilm manage to greenlight something that IS not only unique, but genuinely fun and would make both an awesome plaything and a pretty cool display piece.  In recent years, it's Hasbro that's been responsible for a few of the very best ""Star Wars"" toys ever made, due largely to the role-playing nature they provide - the Interactive R2-D2 and the Darth Vader Voice Changer.<br /><br />Still, Artoo came with too hefty a price tag for everyone to get their hands on him, and for all its tricks the Voice Changer still requires one to throw some menace into their own pipes in order for the effect to really work.  The third time, however, may at last be the charm.<br /><br />The Ultimate Lightsaber, as it's dubbed, affords one the opportunity to live out something that only Jedi Knights can do in the fictional ""Star Wars"" universe: construct their own weapon as a final rite of passage into the Jedi Order.  The price tag is more than substantiated by the number of parts available in this kit, few as they are when you consider how many prominent characters in the ""Star Wars"" saga wield lightsabers (and how many of those same lightsabers have already been produced as role-play toys by Hasbro).  The lack of more parts seems to have limited the Hasbro designers to derive most of the components from the same five or six characters, to be sure, but with a little imagination the combinations can still be impressive in appearance.<br /><br />Another tradeoff exists in the main 'core' component upon which the others are added; no doubt to keep the item affordable, the electronics are only geared for one end - meaning double-bladed lightsabers are out of the question - and the straight hilt is sure to disappoint those ""Star Wars"" enthusiasts who missed out on Count Dooku's lightsaber the first time around (the handle of Dooku's weapon is curved for tighter crossparry moves).  In other words, the chance to craft two of the most unusual lightsabers to yet be seen in the ""Star Wars"" saga was dismissed.<br /><br />But to your child (or the child in everyone likely to play with this thing - admit it), none of this is going to matter.  Apart from the basic battery and light-bulb replacement procedures most parents should be able to handle, the assembly of the weapon can be relatively quick, easy, and make for a sweet finished product that can be enjoyed for hours and hours.  And even then, if one should feel the need to upgrade the device, there's still a raft of components available.  The color filters are expectedly not as potent as the regular colored blades of other toy lightsabers (the red blade, of course, renders them useless), but in the dark they can be ""most impressive"", to quote a certain Dark Lord of the Sith.<br /><br />The 'crystals' - the little plastic chunky thingies - do offer a variety of sounds; one mechanized, one menacing, and one that sounds more like the classic lightsabers we all are familiar with.  And just like Hasbro's other electronic lightsabers, the finished product makes crashing sounds on impact.  The blade is about as rigid as those of the other lightsabers, and with a bit of a thrust to the wrist one can get the blade to stick firmly into position, thereby avoiding the constant collapse of the telescoping blade that can bring heartache to young ones and ear-splitting wailing to the ears of their parents.  This is something that your child should probably practice, as the lightsabers are intended as much for adults (i.e. fans) as well as kids; ditto for pushing the blade back in - with a bit of extra effort these catalysts for tears and refunds can be averted.<br /><br />The instructions for assembly may require a bit of going-over for parent and child, but it shouldn't require too many more readings beyond that (never hurts to save those instructions, though).  Give'em a week or two, and at their leisure your child should be able to replace parts with the ease and speed of a Jedi Master.<br /><br />All in all, like all great toys, the Ultimate Lightsaber requires some patience early on, but ultimately can provide hours of enjoyment as a result, and even give one a particular level of pride in building their own momento of endless adventure in that galaxy far, far away..."
4.0,"This fits perfectly and is super cute.  I wore a cami underneath in case I had to bend over and didn't want to flash my tosro.  But when I wore them with leggings, I realized (while I was in my corp office) that you could see through the legs.<br /><br />Maybe I'll just wear these with jeans going forward."
4.0,"Shipping took a little longer than usual, but worth the weight.  This kimono is great for spring/summer/early fall in some areas; since it is lightweight.  It's extremely versatile too.  Could be worth with a crop and shorts for the summer...and skinny jeans/booties in the fall!  I only knocked one star off because of how long it is, but that is because I am only 5'3''."
4.0,"Very cute but it's really hard to keep on the shoulders, keeps slipping up."
4.0,"Feels and looks just like the original band that came with the Fitbit HR 2, only issue was the screw was not tighten in the band where you snap the Fitbit into it.  It was an easy fix, but a small screwdriver was needed.  Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"This dress is amazing, but there are a few things I was unhappy with. First, it fit a bit looser I was hoping for but it’s better than being too tight. I remember there’s a custom button but I was worried it would take to long to ship. I bought this dress for my ballet recital, I am dressing up as a “mademoiselle” or basically a Marie Antoinette knock off and needed a rococo inspired gown. I purchased a separate hip enhancer petticoat cage thing and found that it’s not enough to give the dress volume so I also had to purchase another long petticoat for the extra layers.<br />This dress is LONG and if that’s what you’re going for, cool, but I’m going to have to hem it. I will also have to take in the waist and the arms, but I’m worried when I take in the waist the zipper won’t work as well, as it already is tough to close near where the bodice portion and the bottom of the gown meet.<br />The fabrics takes well to a steamer, it doesn’t melt, but I am being careful not to hover too long but there will be WRINKLES when it arrives from being folded up so tightly.<br /><br />The front pleated panels aren’t attached to the innermost layer, there are two layers to the skirt, the panels are pinned on one side to the outer skirt. The lace on the arms are soft, doesn’t itch, and the bodice is so nice but I need structure underneath so my boobs will stay up and give that nice, flat, authentic rococo look.<br /><br />The color is beautiful but isn’t as true as the photo, atleast not in all lighting. In the sun it looks more of a rosy pink color and I had bought all these purple accessories to match the hue from the picture, but they won’t be near the color to match, more of a compliment. I’m some lighting and in the dark it looks purple like the photo.<br /><br />Such a beautiful dress and I can’t wait to get it to fit me and be able to dance in it without tripping."
4.0,has not turned color love the feel and not heavy. Wish it was a little bigger
4.0,"The dress is nice and fits well with 2-3 inch heels if you're petite. The cloth isn't really that good. Otherwise, the dress is perfect for any casual family/dinner occasion here or there."
4.0,"First, the set is huge. Second, the bottom is way bigger than the top. Third the top pocket has a raw cut edge. Anyhow, it does look pretty good. I will have to steam it and make it work. Itjas potential due to the pretty color and material. Oh and not sexy pj's at all more like a chill outfit. You may be able to get away with wearing outside. I bought it for the top."
4.0,It is really cute on.
4.0,"Love this suit! I am a heavier girl so I thought this two piece would be perfect. The bottom is perfect size but the top is much bigger than it needs to be. I ordered a 2x, I am about 200 lbs and wear a 38D so I thought a 2X would be good. Even though the top is bigger, it's not a big deal to the point that it's worth returining. I still love the suit!"
4.0,Love these workout pants
4.0,"I ordered a 38DD, it doesn't fit perfectly but for the price I paid it's not a big deal."
4.0,Case bigger than expected too big ti carry in my pocket but I like the glasses
4.0,"This turquoise pendant is very pretty.  The turquoise is a beautiful light blue, and the silverwork is very nice.  The bale is  small, and I prefer large bales so that I can wear the pendant on different size chains/necklaces."
4.0,Cute and dressy for going out
4.0,"Thank You,"
4.0,Way longer than I expected. I will hem it though so no problem! Im 5'-9&#34; and it still hit my knees. It fit good I got a large and I measure 47 bust 32 waist and 38 hips. So it fit the boobs and everything which was super nice for once! So big titty committee this dress works!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:37904b9b397b4c33a441e5eab1ed2c1]] I love the smell of the leather on this belt. It fit great (I ordered a medium, and I usually fit a US women's size 8-10), and just gives me that extra cinch I need on dresses that aren't tailored as well for my shape.<br /><br />The belt buckle is sturdy and the elastic band stays in place without buckling at all.<br /><br />I would caution against wearing this belt cinched too tight for too long, as it may cause discomfort in the waist and back."
4.0,"Decent dress, but the zipper is flimsy and gets stuck so badly on the seams so that I ended up working it closed past the belt and then putting it on. Not a big deal though for the price and it’s still super cute"
4.0,Good quality anf stronge. Me and my sons love them.
4.0,love these funky shoes.  Warning:  very high and a little difficult to walk in because of that.
4.0,My husband normally is comfortable in XL and I in L sizes. However when we got the adult versions they were tight on both of us. The 2-T for a child fit them well though. 1
4.0,"It seems to be well made and the magnet is strong.  In the past I have used a small metal clip; so, I'm still getting used to the added bulk."
4.0,No comment right now
4.0,"His was too tight in the chest. I could not get some of the buttons to lie flat, and I had to return it. I think a larger size would have been too large for my bottom half, though. This is probably a great dress for pears, but apples might wish to consider the dress carefully. The tie to the back was also unbecoming for the waist line. I ordered a similar dress without buttons and a tie in the back, and I kept it."
4.0,They fit & look good BUT They’re hard to turn & clip the little ear in by yourself when putting on otherwise I would have given 5 stars if not kinda a pain to latch the ear on.
4.0,10-30-20 I liked the jacket it did keep me warm. I wore it outdoors in temperatures of  55-60 F.
4.0,Water shoes are not the most attractive but I actually get a lot of complaints on these. I ordered them for my whole family for a waterpark. Good product but they start wearing out pretty quickly unfortunately. I just ordered another pair for my 2yr old since he wears them all the time in the pool.
4.0,"Great price for a nice, sparkly little bracelet. Very easy to find matching earrings, and made an excellent gift as a set."
4.0,"I did return the dress because it was a little too fancy and revealing as a friend's date to a wedding. But it was very pretty and if I had an event scheduled I could have worn it to I would have definitely kept it. The low back is gorgeous there was just a little too much side boob. Also the length was just a tad too short, it hit right at the ankles. I am 5'6"", 36C usually a 6 in pants and I ordered the small based on others reviews."
4.0,"Decent quality and affordable price. The briefs were big, so next time I’ll small instead of a medium size."
4.0,"Cute wallet, clip on end has not stood up to regular use (it broke quickly and wasn’t very strong so if you plan attaching to keys maybe buy a new clip for end.)"
4.0,Dress is beautiful... nice thick material. Wish it had less material on the skirt part of the dress. Doesn't need a petticoat.
4.0,Received my necklace today. The &quot;diamond&quot; is definitely smaller than I hoped it would be but it's really cute. Exactly how I remembered these types of necklaces looking when they were super popular in the early 2000s (I believe 2000s) in the US. The clear &quot;fishing line&quot; was a little wonky at first so I had to GENTLY tugging on it a bit to straighten it out once it was around my neck to get it to make a perfect circle shape. All in all a great buy for the price if you want a feminine preppy looking necklace. Only had it for a day so not sure how it'll tarnish yet. Will update review if things go bad.
4.0,"its very cute, but kind of big (maybe i have a small head?) and the ears are hard to keep in place. but that was expected."
4.0,"Fits true to size and is warm. A bit scratchy, but comfortable enough to wear all day"
4.0,These fit my 11-year-old son well! The ear holes make him look like a rectangle with giant ears though 😂 I sewed them shut.
4.0,I know I can ask for perfection when I’m not paying much.. the studs were falling out after a couple of baths.
4.0,"I'm overall quite pleased with this dress. The color leans more toward a deep rose red than the wine depicted here. The cut is modest. The bust is covered fully and the skirt falls to my knees, which rarely happens given my 178 cm height. I did not find the band to be tight or restricting as other reviewers have suggested. It lays flat and falls near the narrowest part of my waist. I could have sized down in every part of this dress except the bust. For example, the shoulderline is slightly broad even for my broader-shouldered hourglass frame and the bodice is cut wider than I need. This is a typical issue in ready-to-wear clothing cut for average busts--going up a size  to accommodate large breasts gives one more width rather than the deeper darts in the bust that are really needed. However, the fabric is flexible and molds around the body well enough to mostly obfuscate small fit issues. The overall silhouette is balanced and flattering, and the material has sufficient body not to cling or reveal overmuch."
4.0,Would give 5 stars but they tend to slide down otherwise great fit!
4.0,Love this hat. Love the color. Love the fit. Great quality and very warm.
4.0,"Nice pair of cycling shorts, breathable fabric!"
4.0,"These definitely were a little large on my daughter and I purchased her size.  Also, be very aware that the color that came is NOT this color.  My daughter is very fair skinned and these that came were very tan/mocha.  Her prom dress was an ivory lace, I had to put pads in the dress top because these were so dark.  I'm olive skinned and these were dark for me.  So the picture shown is not correct.  I didn't send them back and I didn't contact the seller because I had to have them in time for alterations and then prom was a short time after that, returning them and trying to find another one wouldn't work.  The product worked great, but the color is way off and they are a little large."
4.0,"Returned; item was too long but too beautiful to attempt to alter. Haven't seen refund to my account, yet. 😕"
4.0,These are very cute. The length is a problem though. They are an awkward and in-between length. They are too short to be considered a regular length for a petite woman and too long to be Capri length.
4.0,"The skirt is just as in the picture.<br />The material of the skirt is quite thin, with no underskirt."
4.0,slightly smaller than it appears in the movie but overall a nice product
4.0,"This is a very good wallet, but it doesn't hold much. I love that it protects my cards with chips (including my Driver's Licence) from data skimmers. I like the change pocket."
4.0,"Pros: The army camouflage leggings are very cute and soft to the feel.  Cons:  The legging had a hole in one leg.  The fabric wears easily.  I had the recipient of the gift put the leggings on.  When she removed the leggings it looked as though she had worn them for a number of days.  I purchased the leggings for a special army themed program at church.  I know after the program the leggings will need to be &#34;pitched&#34;.  Again, the leggings are very cute; however, they are not of a good quality.[[ASIN:B01FLJI0NS Girl's Dark Military Camouflage Pattern Print Leggings - Olive Green L/XL]]"
4.0,When you roll up the sleeves there is a strap that you button to the upper sleeve but that strap is twice as long as needed.  I never use those straps so I just cut them off.
4.0,"The dress is just as it appears in the pictures except for one thing...I'm 5'3 and it is way too short for me to wear to work. It falls a good three inches above my knee. Other than that, it's a lovely dress. Wrap dresses are very flattering and this one is no exception."
4.0,"This dress fit great, just a little loose in the waist because of the open back. It photographs beautifully with the design but the sequins started to fall off the second I opened the package. I also had to cut some loose strings off. I'm not used to wearing sequins so it was a little uncomfortable. It was the perfect length with heels on and I am 5'8"". Great dress for the price and what I was looking for. My measurements are 36-29.5-40."
4.0,"I think my kindergarten boy is going to make it through the whole school year in these shoes (one month to go). However, I did have to replace the velcro about 7 month in. It wore off completely. I have no problem with minor mending so this was not a huge deal to me. He loves them because they are very light weight and very comfortable with lots of shock absorption (he says ""squishy""). They are definitely showing wear at this point, and he may have a hole near the big toe any day now, but making it through a whole school year is about as much as I can ask from any gradeschool sized shoe. Especially a lower priced one."
4.0,nice quality and style.
4.0,"I ordered a large after reading reviews and I should have bought the medium. Returning, undecided if reordering a medium&lt;the fabric was just okay."
4.0,I love Russell Gear I have been wearing it since I was a kid.
4.0,I like this item to wear on my walks in the neighborhood
4.0,About what you’d expect. Nicer quality than some I’ve seen.  Nice variety of colors too.
4.0,"I liked that this had an adjustable visor type of style.  I used for plane travel and felt like it offered an extra layer of protection.  It fit and the strap was comfortable.<br /><br />I wore it for almost 8 hours and I would say that by hour 5, I wanted it off, but I doubt they make one in this price range that wouldn't be like that.  The biggest issue I had after that amount of time is that I wear glasses and while it fit over the glasses, it put some pressure on the frame and it made my glasses uncomfortable.  I wore a homemade mask with a charcoal filter with it.  The homemade mask straps started becoming uncomfortable at the 5 hour mark as well so it might just be the combination of the PPE and my glass exacerbated my comfort.  Four stars as the clear part at each end is starting to become deformed--presumably from rolling it for travel."
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because the description says it has pockets but it doesn't.  If it did then easily I'd give 5 stars.  I got a 2x and it's a little big. Typically I get a XL or 1x but it wasn't in my size so I went up one. So I assume it runs true to size.
4.0,"5'2 and 108lbs. Small fit prefect however like others have said, lace on the back was a little loose...pinning it was an easy fix.  Tons of compliments a"
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter. She is small, 4’10”, and the XS was way too big."
4.0,I really do love this bikini.  The top fits great and even has a metal hook/clasp at the back which I love since plastic ones do not last in sun and chlorine.  The bottoms are a little on the smaller side of size 18.  They are not as stretchy as most swimsuits either so fits a little tight on the waist/hip.
4.0,"I absolutely love this multi-color platform wedge.  The shoe fits perfectly and even though the wegde is high, it stills feels comfortable walking.  The velcro strip on the side can irritate the leg if not worn correctly, but that is the only downside."
4.0,This necklace is actually pretty cute. Only fault is that it doesn't always stay in place and has fallen off a few times. Other than that I love it for the price.
4.0,"Came quicly in the mail and the product was undamaged. The glass itself appears a bit hard to clean, like its got the faint reminants of something sticky on it. I got the smaller one which seems to be a good size."
4.0,"Very shiny, pretty, but a little like tin - I can see why it was so inexpensive."
4.0,"This dress fit me as expected, I ordered a medium and there were no fit issues aside from length. I am using it for a costume, so no real information about day-to-day wearability The dress is a bit long on me and needed to be hemmed by a couple of inches.<br /><br />For reference: I am 5'2&#34;, 145 lbs. with a 29.5&#34; waist. I typically wear a 34F (UK) bra and size 8/10 dress."
4.0,"This is a really beautifully crafted bracelet. It came super fast and the quality is superb. Its a little heavy but in a good way. The bracelet has adjustable straps. The only thing that i don't like about it is that when you tighten it, it leaves extra material hanging on your wrists, which could cause it to be in the way."
4.0,Gets the job done. What can I really say its a bandana.
4.0,I liked the pattern but needs more stability.
4.0,Looks great and very comfortable. Just wish it was easier to install without the tool.
4.0,what expected
4.0,Nice quality! Great price ! I wold buy again!
4.0,"Initially I ordered a large in this dress, when I tried it on, I had 3-4 inches of extra fabric around my waistline. So I ordered the medium to replace it, and the medium is tight in the top across the shoulders and chest. I always have issues with tops fitting my shoulders, so having it tight across my shoulder is nothing new, but the lace is strong and even when it feels like I might be close to ripping some of it, it stays strong and intact. The dress doesn't quite sit as low on me as it does on the model, the three bands are appear a bit move above my waist, but it still looks cute.<br /><br />I'm going to stick with the medium because I'd rather it be a bit tight, than 3-4 inches too large. I'm 5'11&#34; and usually wear a medium in shirts, and 8-10(29-30) in jeans."
4.0,"When I first opened the package-loved the sunglasses!  Style is great, color great. But after coming home, taking them off.. I looked into the mirror and I had red dye on my face, where the glasses laid! It was a real bummer! I was glad that I didn't take them off in public! I have these cool, fashion-forward sunglasses; now I am leary of wearing them. I will keep them. Will I wear the again?  Probably not, but for approximately six dollars, I'm not going to bother with returns.  Cute though! Too bad!!!"
4.0,"This is my go-to bag for carrying my stuff while taking extended longboard rides on my electric. I wish it had a 3 point harness and the plastic buckles are a bit finicky, but it's good nonetheless. I'll be holding onto it."
4.0,"Fit is good, tad itchy but we fold them down and they were fine."
4.0,Very sturdy and goes well with everything.
4.0,Cool looking hat for my kid!
4.0,"I knew it would be too small (from experience) so I ordered 2 sizes up. The fabric is wonderful. Polyester, but different than I expected. It’s nicely weighted. Hangs great. I call it my Roman conquest dress. I wore it to church and got several compliments."
4.0,Nice size studs.  I wish the color of the amethysts were not so dark.
4.0,Smaller than expected. The color is true to pictures that are featured. I like the material.
4.0,used to wear large --but as I've aged I shrunk--glad these fit so well--pkt
4.0,Such soft and stretchy maternity leggings. It’s one of the most comfortable ones I own but I’m really disappointed with how fast it started pilling. It started the first day I wore it.
4.0,"This worked perfect for my surgery, will use again if need be."
4.0,"Beautiful, but it slides around a lot -- doesn't stay where you put it."
4.0,"Most of the time, I order a Large in women's tops as I am broad across my back. The measurement around the fullest part of my bust is around 39-40&#34;. This is the measurement you will need to know when ordering your size. If it fits around your bust properly, the rest will drape. This top looked way too baggy in the size Large so I ordered one in a size Medium. It fits perfectly. I love the high neckline and the cut in shoulders. The arm holes are perfect. The material is light weight enough to drape beautifully. I was afraid it was going to look like a tent but it doesn't. I am 5' 6&#34; tall and a fairly fit 64 year old.  I generally like more fitted tops but this looks great with straight leg pants and I don't have to worry about any bulging around the back or around the waist. It is a very flattering cut for me but I will say that it would probably be best for taller women due to long length in the front. You will have to wear a bra with cut in straps if you don't want them to show."
4.0,I really like this dress it is so nice and the material is great! Definitely well made.<br />I gave it 4 starts because I thought the buttons made the dresses look cheaper. However it was nice so I kept it and it was worth adding different buttons.
4.0,Gift .
4.0,Very nice dress will order more
4.0,"A handsome piece with just the right amount of color as an accent. When in stopwatch mode, the action is splendid. The bit of curve on the crystal looks rich.  It has a nice weight, but not heavy."
4.0,"This is a cute lightweight jacket. I purchased a large (expecting it to fit perfectly), it fit somewhat small on me."
4.0,"This shirt was so cute and exactly what I wanted, but unfortunately it was tighter than I like to wear my shirts so I returned it."
4.0,Took a while to get to me...but love the shoes!!! Great quality and great price! :)
4.0,Overall a great tank top exactly like pictured
4.0,I don't give 5 star because an the front of the dress is a bit short.  Otherwise is beauty
4.0,"Purchased this item for my big day in custody court, and man did it deliver! The color was perfect, dark navy blue, the ruching is the perfect touch, the slit goes a tad bit higher than I expected, but the worst part is that it’s like the same material as a slip so it shows everything underneath. Definitely have to buy a slip if you want to not show any lines. (Plus I had to wear some spandex shorts with my shirt tucked in for a smooth seamless look)."
4.0,I felt like they would've been a bit bigger than what they ended up being but they're still very cute
4.0,These socks work well with flip flops in the winter.
4.0,"This wig was perfect for my bride of Frankenstein costume. It was pretty comfortable, but I did loosely ball up plastic grocery bags and stuff them in the wig to make sure it stayed up while we were out trick-or-treating."
4.0,I normally wear a 2x in women's tops so I ordered the 2x and it fits perfect. First dress I've bought in years that actually fits and looks good
4.0,Me quedó grande lo utilizo para trabajar; Im a nurse
4.0,Cool looking watch and received a couple of compliments. Keeps time we’ll after about a month.
4.0,Got this and really like it. The metal is heavier then I expected but otherwise a really nice set. I've worn it twice so we'll see how long term it works out.
4.0,I love this necklace so so much. I was able to wear it pretty much for every occasion. From formal to elegant. Unfortunately it broke
4.0,"Great print on the mask, fits fairly well. Took a little while to adjust properly and I forgot it had the nose wire so I had it on wrong for about a week before I fixed it all. It's a bit big for my face still though so it's not as easy to wear as my other masks."
4.0,Just what I ordered! No case but came in a great box and has the sleeve to put them in. Very satisfied and Will continue doing business with them.
4.0,"I liked this jumpsuit, but it was too big.  I am 180lb 5'5 pear shaped. bust measurement is 36, waist 32, hips 42.  XL swallowed me and wouldn't even stay up.  I like the purple color and style however...just too big"
4.0,"Very cute! It runs a little small, though. I'm 5/4, 125 pounds. I'm still going to wear it, just cannot bend over in it or you will see my booty!"
4.0,"I bought two pairs of these.  Kept one and gave the other to may Dad.  We both enjoy them.  They look fine and are great for the beach, throwing around in the car, etc...  You should not be purchasing these with the expectation that they are going to be identical to brand name though as they definitely aren't."
4.0,"The wallet looks very good and has plenty of room to keep money, change, checks, several credit cards and ids.<br />The zip was kind of slow at the beginning but after a drop of cooking oil and some usage now it works fine.<br />The chain is not that good looking, quite short and not worth using it.<br />The only issue I have is that the credit card slot is a bit tight so sometimes I struggle to get a plastic out.<br />I strongly recommend buying from Amazon as the oversea shipment might take 3-4 week to get through USPS"
4.0,"Paper thin material. But from a far looks like real jean with adequate stretch. It runs true to size. I got a large n it fits n looks like a large. I'm more towards a medium, the large fits ok but will have to tailor.  Don't know what people saying about buying a size up. Maybe they're in disbelief about their weight (Shade) doesn't have a good tailored fit. Waist as big as the rest of the skirt (will take it in) adequate for a comfortable sexy night or afternoon with sandals out NOT up to part for looking &#34;FLY&#34; overall not bad for 15 bucks."
4.0,"Very nice, like very much"
4.0,"Bought this shirt for my son. The style is like a baseball shirt. Fabric is very different from a regular t-shirt. Haven't washed it yet so I'm not sure how it will wash, but there is specific instructions on how to wash to preserve the lettering."
4.0,I haven't used it yet. Im already getting compliments. EXACTLY as expected
4.0,"Pretty solid duffle. Came with some paint stains or something on it, but they aren’t very noticeable. I did spill red wine on it (long story) but after immediately rinsing it and throwing it in the washer, it was completely fine!"
4.0,I like the shirt's fit.  It was a bit wrinkled after a wash and dry.  I will be testing the shirt fully next week and will update if needed.
4.0,"This fit just like I thought it would. As someone who has lost 100pounds since purchasing it still fits fine despite the sleeves which are slightly long, but thats because i'm 5'5 and bought this so ya thats on my odd body shape. Went from 280 to 170"
4.0,"I really like this dress, but do go up a size if you don't want your breast to take center stage. The cloth is much softer and thinner than a regular tshirt. So unless you have a good bra that hides your nipples best to wear at home."
4.0,"Very nice little gift, but much smaller than I anticipated."
4.0,"Excellent product for price; seams just a little rough, as might be anticipated for the low price."
4.0,Pretty darn good for the money .. cant go wrong for the money.. description was accurate.. thank goodness
4.0,"My son asked for this hoodie for Christmas. It was delivered quickly and it seems like nice quality. The material is more of a silky, slick material on the outside. A little lighter than the regular thickness of a hoodie, but still nice quality."
4.0,"Bought for my sister. It fits her well, but could use a slip. The skirt static clings to your behind and legs. Good product overall."
4.0,It is beautiful. A bit bigger than I was expecting. My daughter has already taken it so if passed her inspection. She is three years old.
4.0,"Soft and comfortable. Fits as expected. The pocket in back actually fits my phone! Came well packaged as it was pouring rain, but they remained undamaged. However they smelled awful like chemicals. Hoping the smell washes out all the way."
4.0,unique kind of look
4.0,"I love this little dress. So comfy, it feels like t shirt material."
4.0,"The quality is good, but the size is a bit small as it described. I am 125b, ""M"" is a bit tight for me. I guess ""L"" probably would fit me better. For avoiding the return process, I still keep it."
4.0,"I bought for my dance team, some of the ladies have much larger feet than I... they are quite small"
4.0,Love these! Helps keep everything in place.
4.0,I wouldn’t recommend purchasing these in pattern form. As the stitching due to color pattern/color change created uneven compression. I will be repurchasing as a solid color.
4.0,"I'd put better buttons or make them snap buttons but otherwise, good quality"
4.0,This shirt is somewhat odd looking but still quite comfortable. The shirt fits I was expected and has a nice soft feel to it. It is quite thin so you won't get too hot in it. Considering how cheap it is it is definitely a good alternative to other shirts.
4.0,"Very cute earrings for my daughter. Not too heavy or too big, but big enough to leave no question that they’re owls. Biggest downside was 6 weeks shipping  from China."
4.0,"Hidden pocket was hard to find, and does not work that well for a pedometer. Keys would be better, but I wish the pocket were on a side, my belly already is too big! Otherwise, these pants work great for my workouts at the gym."
4.0,It super soft and seem well made
4.0,Gets the job done. It is just as pictured. Built in bra for those who need to know.
4.0,"It is well package...good enough to give it as a gift for sure.<br />As shown,, it is quite tiny peal earrings that would be good for occasions like you don't want to wear something flashy or noticeable but still want something.<br />The accent diamond is definitely not noticeable if you are 1 mm away  haha. it's just looks like silver dot.<br />I just wear it around home because it doesn't bother me at all :)"
4.0,Very nice but really smaller than I thought.
4.0,"Fit is a little on the big side.  I got a S/M and it was a bit loose fitting. Also, the straps in the back continue to bunch together so they don't stay spread out to show the strappy style in the back unless you constantly separate them. It is comfortable."
4.0,These fit comfortably and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. They are slightly see through but I kinda expected that for the price. It is not so see through that it can't be easily camouflaged with the right color undergarment. Would definitely recommend for the occasional St Patrick's Day wear.
4.0,"I love these!!! They are so flowy and comfortable. Perfect for the beach. They fit perfectly. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because they are VERY see through so they are fine for the beach but I would've liked to wear them out other places. I am 5'6"" 138lb and ordered a medium."
4.0,"Good boa, except tends to lose its feathers easily...like most I've found. Good length and fullness."
4.0,"The material is scratchy for my skin and does cause irritation after wearing.  I got this because of roseaca, it is better on the skin than the paper masks."
4.0,Fits like the other reviews said. Looks great
4.0,"Like Im not even kidding. THese don't run a bit large, they are very large. If you need a small, well tough luck that won't even work. A small is a medium-large and medium is I dont how, like large large? I don't even want to imagine what a large would fit like.<br /><br />But the material is great and its very comfortable. Looks sweet"
4.0,I love the feel and fit. The only down fall is the stitching shows at every seam. The size does run small. I am 5'7&#34; and 150. Xlarge fits perfect
4.0,Cheapy made. But for the price great.
4.0,I like the suspenders the look cool but they're a lot smaller than I expected so just think about that when you decide to buy them
4.0,Nice shirt but does require ironing after wash and dry.
4.0,"The ring is beautiful,  I got it to be used as a promise ring. It is very Big. The only upsetting thing is that size 5 is the smallest size when I am a size 4. Because of this I had to buy ring doodles to wear on the ring so it's uncomfortable and bulky. Wish they had more sizes, but the ring is very beautiful and looks real"
4.0,"These are cute little earrings, go with everything, sparkle beautifully. The picture is not very accurate, since they are not as colorful as shown."
4.0,A tad shorter than I anticipated but still very cute
4.0,The sleeves where to long
4.0,Runs Small to size
4.0,"Nice sunglasses, but scratch easily"
4.0,"I returned for a size down.  I am a wide 7.5/8  (depends on style and maker) - but 7.5 was way to large. 7 is good. I love the asymmetrical toe line - makes the shoe more formal, necessary for people like me who can't wear heels. It won't last very long, I think, but great for the price and the event."
4.0,"I've had my eye on this simple number ever since it appeared on my Pinterest wall as part of a Mori Girl outfit. I hesitated at first because there were so many different reviews concerning the sizing. However, I finally took a leap of faith and purchased it. And I'm pretty darn pleased, I must say. I'm an inch below six feet and the dress reaches just above the ankle, give or take. My rule as far as sizing is to go one size up (I bought the XL), depending on how loose you prefer. And it is a loose fit, so don't expect body skimming. The material is light and flowy enough for spring/summer with sandals, but paired with a cardigan and boots would be perfect for fall/winter. The label indicates the dress plays well in the washing machine - cold water and delicate setting - but I opted to wash by hand and line dry. This dress is about to become a key item in my closet."
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; 170 lbs, fits great! I bought a size large since I'm a 34DD size 29 in pants."
4.0,The strings are annoying when cinched but they are stylist and the dye isn't rubbing off onto my skin when wet or sweaty.
4.0,"These shoes seem to be a bit overpriced for the quality. They are holding up all right, but the material is cheap-looking. The design is adorable, though."
4.0,The clip on part was bigger than expected. Didn't fit on my real glasses. They work alright though
4.0,"It’s beautiful, but it doesn’t line up straight after it’s put in."
4.0,Exactly the way I wanted it to fit!
4.0,"Great looking pants that are nice and thin and great for causal wear.  My only critique would be the ankle zippers seem a bit industrial, meaning the zipper part you grab onto is a bit bigger than I'd like. When jogging it somehow gets into the top of my shoe, so I have to zip  it up higher. It's not a big issue just thing the zipper could be smaller. Overall these are great for house wear or casual events."
4.0,I absolutely loved it! Can’t wait till it gets warm enough to wear it at!! ❤️
4.0,Arrived on time and great sunglasses for that price.
4.0,Great fit! Comfy and washed well! My dinosaur loving daughter loves these pajamas!
4.0,"I'm usually an 8 in men and 10 in womens, however, the shoe fits except for the big toe. I am definitely returning them, but i wonder if the toe will still be too small if i order a larger size..."
4.0,It sticks out a little more than I would have liked. But I am happy with it overall.
4.0,"This is a somewhat confusing dress, honestly: while very much a classic swing dress from the bust down, it's quite fitted through the sleeves. Too fitted for me, actually. Granted, I'm a plus size gal who carries substantial bulk in her arms, but I found the fit uncomfortably constricting - an issue exacerbated by the fact that the fabric is quite thick, with only minimal stretch.<br /><br />However, that personal drawback is actually one of this dress's greatest strengths: everything, from fabric to construction, feels high-quality. Much higher-quality than you'd expect in this price range. Luckily the sleeves fit my slimmer mother very well, and the free sizing of the swing cut adapts well to her frame. Honestly, this is a great dress, and very forgiving fit-wise in every aspect but the sleeves."
4.0,Fits as expected and color is as shown. I used it as a beach shirt. Cute and looks great. Shipped quick.
4.0,I'm 5'4 and 125. It fits snug. I was very snug up top but I would rather have it a little snug. I feel good about the buy for 20
4.0,"Looked like it was well made, unfortunately, it is smaller than advertised. I returned it but give it 4 stars and would have kept it had it fit."
4.0,So one size fits all is a lie. For me it fits quite well. I have pretty chunky fingers. Even so if my fingers were any smaller then this ring would be painful. It’s slightly uncomfortable for me but nothing most women don’t suffer through for beauty;) my biggest disappointment is the color. I ordered rose gold which I’ve realized is really hard to match. Every company’s rose gold is a slightly different tint. This one for example is MUCH DARKER than the picture. Almost a copper color. Perhaps an amber. Which isn’t noticeable until paired with other rose gold items. Then it’s obvious that this color is so much darker.... I still think it’s beautiful but probably should have stuck with silver...
4.0,Different style from the picture the buttons are not like the picture. But over all it's a great style and slim fit perfect ....
4.0,Awesome product... but for something that you use for the bottom of your shoe to hold your pant legs from riding up during a bike ride and that will eventually need to be replace.. I feel it's a bit too pricey!!!😕
4.0,Bought this as a replacement pair for one I lost. Not exactly the same but close enough and for the price its not bad.
4.0,No more lost mittens!  Yay!  Must have for young kids.  Easy to use and stay clipped.  Kids have been using them for several weeks without problem.
4.0,"The plugs fit well, are pretty, and came very quickly. The stone just isn't as intricate as the picture would suggest."
4.0,These are okay slippers for the price.  I wish the inside of the slipper was as soft as the outside.
4.0,Loved these shirts. Definitely ordering more. I work with kids and prefer to have my arms covered. These are perfect for the hot days and running around.
4.0,"Has held up surprisingly well, fits exactly as sized. The material is a little heavy, but it wears really nicely over a dress or jeans."
4.0,"I have been using this for months now. I love that I can just wrap this around my wrist when not required to have a face covering. When wearing this face covering, it does cause my eye glasses to become foggy."
4.0,I love this set it's so cute. Wish I would have ordered a size down because it does seem to run a little big.
4.0,This was a gift. The inner pocket is plastic but the outer liner starts out as cloth then transitions to plastic.  The exterior  is soft leather and it is spacious.
4.0,"Cheap, and perfect for the Harry Potter costume."
4.0,Just a smidgeon more than I would have liked to pay. But it's a quality pin. Solid metal. Decent enamel work and plating.
4.0,Super cute! We got the dark grey and navy blue. Colors are just like expected! Only reason it isnt a 5 star is because the material on the velcro strap is already a bit frayed. My son likes them alot though!
4.0,"Love these shirts xlarge is bigger then I thought but comfy and good quality, long length"
4.0,bag was too small for my computer reordered another
4.0,The dress fit really nicely and was as expected. The only downfall would be the zipper which was difficult to get up and down.
4.0,was expecting bright white and it was a rustic while
4.0,"This is a decent corset. Not the best, but it works. It looks fine after first being put on, but after wearing it all day, the sides began to cave in and pinch. True to size"
4.0,"I usually wear a large but ordered a 2x and it fits great. The sleeves shrank quite a bit. Although, the material is soft."
4.0,Comfortable and nice material and fit just as expected.
4.0,"Arrived very quickly, they are very comfortable and fashion forward. The touch works pretty well on the phone, however sometimes it doesn't always pick it up"
4.0,"It fits well I like the material it's very comfortable, I only wish it had pockets."
4.0,"I like the dress, it fit as expected. It's cute for summer dress and I felt really pretty in it. Overall, you get what you pay for."
4.0,I ordered two 4way stretch in navy and rust.  After a few washes it’s starting to fit as shown in ad.  Washes and drys nicely.  Had to size up x2.  Later ordered the rust which was already knee length when received after washing its at the knee.  May have to hand down by the end of Fall.
4.0,"This is such a unique skirt, it has a vintage type vibe to it for those that appreciate that. It is velvet, and falls just below my knee (I'm 5'4), and the skirt is quite heavy. Generally I wear these types of skirts high-waisted, but it's a little big for that on me (25"" waist) and combined with the weight of the skirt, it makes it hard to wear on the actual waist. It works okay with a belt though. It fits perfectly fine lower down closer to your hips, but it will make the dress wear longer so that's all about personal preference. The colors are bold and rich, but classic, and the material feels nice your skin. It washes fine, no complaints, great piece to add to any wardrobe."
4.0,Bought this for my toddler for 4th of jult outfit and its really cute. A litfle big for her though.
4.0,The legs bands are perfect<br />Size is as expected<br />Comfortable on a nicely padded seat for long rides
4.0,Still last  at this time
4.0,"Easy, lightweight skirt to wear. There's two holes in the waist line so it won't fall immediately if the tie comes undone. The slit was higher than anticipated, so I had to hold down the front if there was a slight breeze. Great casual outfit! I am short, so the length worked well with heels and flats."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised.
4.0,"The shine of the necklace is nice. A bit thinner than I hoped, but I still like it. Let's see how it holds up..."
4.0,Great color. No pockets.
4.0,I was pleased at the feel of the material and the fit.
4.0,Great idea but the poles aren’t strong enough. The connectors are perfect and the rods are good for too pieces. It needs wood or stronger pieces for the base. They’re not strong enough to support any of the structures pictured…let alone a sheet on top.
4.0,I like the material very much but will have to alter it as it’s pretty big. good quality
4.0,Pretty dress but applique  did not look right  on me.  Will be sending this one back. The applique and the way it bunched were not flattering on the tummy.
4.0,Cute but Too big I look like a mosquito 😅
4.0,Guys really well.
4.0,I didn't like the fact that there was not a small jump ring on the end of the chain for easier fastening.
4.0,Muy buena calidad !
4.0,Good glasses. They are a bit scatchey around the ears.
4.0,"The leather finish is great. It has the vintage look. Looks like it will age just fine. The band is thick but also very stiff. I have to apply olive oil to lessen the stiffness. Also, the standard buckle is too big for my taste. I have to replace it with a non Pre V. Overall, it is a good product."
4.0,"Great nose ring for someone that doesn't keep it in all the the time. Its nice and flat and fits securely.  It is, however a little to shiny like a rhinestone so not very subtle to wear in a professional job setting"
4.0,Cute design but wish they hadn’t used white three in the color part of the mask.  Made well otherwise
4.0,"Really nice robe, perfect for lying around, and it went through the wash well. I really love the color and design! Only problem was that the inside strings that tie the inner waist snapped and I had to resew it. Not much of a problem, but that felt cheap."
4.0,Love this dress and the fit  however it see through you will have to wear a slip under even with the black color.
4.0,"Would have been 5⭐️ But isn't as long as picture. I still really like it though. I'm 5, 3&#34; weigh 150. I purchased a medium."
4.0,"The jeans seem great, but I'll need to return because I ordered a size too large. It's different with each brand and I find a lot of brands run small so I always order a size up just in case, but if I ordered my true size, these would have fit perfectly."
4.0,Cool shades and keep the dust out.
4.0,"It’s not as delicate as it appears in the photo, so it was a little too much/chunky  for my nose."
4.0,Look like picture great product
4.0,Nice job of keeping approaching headlights from blinding me. Unfortunately lights just seem to be getting brighter . Four stars cause the fit could be better
4.0,"Looks exactly as the photo. It’s one piece and has a clasp and chain close so you can make it longer or shorter. I like the length of the feather one but felt that the top one was closer to my neck than I wanted, even on the lowest chain setting."
4.0,"I wanted to wear this as a dress, but it is very thick and the tie is very thick, so cinching the waist as a dress just looks bulky. Very nice as a long shacket tho."
4.0,"I own the 102,103. I purchased these 105 knowing about the back pocket changes. What I didn’t know is that the pocket pouch was reduced. I always use a checkbook style wallet and now I can’t close the pocket top. I feel uncomfortable having my wallet sticking out. I wish they had not reduced the inner pouch. I bought 2 of the 105 and both are the same."
4.0,good and looks same as in the picture
4.0,My husband is a medium and I got him a large because of other reviews. It is just a tad tight in his arms but an x-large probably would be top big. The quality is great though and he loves it.
4.0,"When buying swimsuits I normally have to buy the bottoms and tops separately like a large top and medium bottoms, but I took a chance when I ordered this.<br />Overall the swimsuit is awesome, but the top is too small for my 34C chest. The bottoms are cuter then i expected, but I wish the back would cover my cheeks a little more because it feels like I could get a wedgie easily."
4.0,Good quality 4 price
4.0,This is a nice necklace but it is longer than the picture makes it out to be. I was disappointed at first but after wearing it a few times I got used to it and people really love it.
4.0,This is one of the better lanyards I've owned. I have to have a breakaway lanyard due to work environment and this one doesn't randomly break like others.
4.0,"Great look, very classy."
4.0,"Cute and fit as expected. The off-white color is really &#34;off&#34;, looks more like creamy, but still pretty."
4.0,"Like it, came just as I expected."
4.0,The pink doesn't quite match the pink so I'm going for a different look I guess.  But it was really bugging me that my strap broke.  I really appreciate this.  I got the largest size. Fits great.
4.0,"Good non slip socks. Not for boys and girls, not enough boy colors."
4.0,A little tiny in size but I was expecting that. Looks just like the picture shows. Good quality.
4.0,Worth the price. Used ad prizes at a summer camp. The little girls loved them.
4.0,It doesn't seem to want to set the date it is stuck in 2013.
4.0,Fit as expected. Material was nice. Just wasn't crazy about how it looked on my boxy frame.
4.0,"Nice looking, not too 10 of favs but it's okay"
4.0,"This dress is really flattering. I got tons of compliments when I wore it. The only issue is that it doesn't have lining, so you will have to wear something under it if you feel uncomfy."
4.0,"Pendant it's self is very pretty but the chain was a little short. It was almost like a choker, had to get a different chain to use. Otherwise great necklace for the price."
4.0,It’s a bit big. But it keeps my head warm on a windy day.
4.0,"Good product, good quality, fast shipping"
4.0,"Look pretty cool, don't need to use it as cuffs but as costume details.  was a little smaller than I though."
4.0,The only downfall to this dress is that it rode up when I walked... and it was already pretty short to begin with. Use tape!
4.0,Got this for my son for Christmas.. he loves it.. this seems to be made of high quality material.. only thing shipping took a long time.. like weels
4.0,A nice and comfortable hoodie that keeps me warm. Seems like it should last a long time.
4.0,"Bright red  stones  will add that standout touch to normal black tie formal attire.  Many prongs  safe guard the stones.  Fast  shipment and a nice  presentation box.  I was  so pleased with the red stones the I  also  bought the Light blue  and  purple sets.  I  am a bit  less pleased with these  colors.  The  light blue is very  pale  blue more like  aquamarine  than  the  blue topaz look of the online  picture.  And the  purple is a dark pinkish purple rather than the more amethyst blue purple of the online picture.  These  colors are  OK, but  not  as bold  as I expected.<br /><br />At the  sale price, I consider each of the sets to be a good bargin."
4.0,"Daughter Could NOT use these for driving, altered vision greatly.<br />However, grandson gets headaches and these help him and wears them to play video games, watch TV, and in class."
4.0,"It's for my husband, only complaint is that the jawbone falls out of the wristband occasionally."
4.0,Very light and durable
4.0,Very fun and cute! And floats! A little too bulky to wear with your hair down though. Not a big deal just being picky!
4.0,These gloves were a big help in dealing with storms and snow removal. They fit well enough.  The batteries do not last nearly as long as the seller claims.
4.0,Like the gloves but not that sturdy having sew the fingers
4.0,"These leggings are very stretchy and comfortable. I like the overall design. The problem is that the leggings run very small. For demonstration purposes, I put this pair on top of another pair that's supposed to be the same size. As you can see, these leggings are much smaller in the waist and thighs. You'll definitely need to size up if you're curvy. I think the X-Large would have been ideal for me. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"" and 153lbs.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,One of the pair I received had poor stitching on the cuff which failed or was not sown properly
4.0,"Very nice shirt but the sleeves were a tad bit short, other then that, my husband loved it!!!"
4.0,The hat is cute and as pictured.  It fits my larger than avg head even with a French braid.  Big shame it was not delivered as promised in time for the canoe trip.
4.0,Really nice medic alert pendant. 4 stars because the included chain was very short and very light. This wasn't an issue for me because I have a heavy stainless chain.
4.0,"This was a gift to my daughter along with a couple others so it’s hard to tell if she liked any, sadly. But there’s other things too."
4.0,"This costume was a HUGE hit for Halloween!! The only thing I didn’t like was their was nothing on the inside to help hold it up and keep it straight forward. I am 5’2 and it was too big for me so it made it pretty difficult to walk In :( Like I said, it was a huge hit and I have never had so many compliments for an inflatable costume! If your taller this is perfect!"
4.0,"Just got it, so too new for a decent review.  Like it so far."
4.0,I wasn't quite as prominent as the picture showed.  But still very nice.
4.0,Great Product will buy again.
4.0,Not sure if size is correct but it doesn't fit as it should.
4.0,I bought these in black. Those were more spandex booty shorts however these are much longer and tighter. I'm not sure if the fabric is different. They feel thicker than my other pair. However I still love them will continue to wear to loosen them up.
4.0,It’s a very nice color
4.0,Bought this for my nieces. Good quality for price.
4.0,"I like it, im a Madrid fan and its everething i wanted, i dont use it regularly so i cant talk about the quality of the painting."
4.0,"Very cute shirt. Somewhat thing material, but still quality. Love the blue color."
4.0,Nice item<br /> Looks good
4.0,"I ended up processing a return for this item. It was a nice shirt overall, but I didn't want a stretchy, non-cotton shirt that was fitted I thought it was more like a baseball tee when I made the purchase. I just wanted something different."
4.0,"I wore this under a vintage dress I purchased and it made the dress pop even more. I've also worn this with just a pock rock type of shirt and it was really cute. I've noticed the petticoat can be worn multiple ways and for me, that's a good thing."
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this, however I wish the front was longer. I can't wear it with leggings without being conscious of my lower abdomen showing."
4.0,"I am 5'0"" and about 110 lbs., 34B bust.  The Small was a bit too big in the waist and around the arms, but I loved the length.  For my size, I would go for the XS.  Great for short people!"
4.0,It was simple but still popping
4.0,"I ordered a Large, so that I could wear with bulky sweaters. The jacket fits everywhere, except the sleeves - they’re a bit long, but they can be rolled up once & look just fine."
4.0,"As my readers know, I'm very big into leggings/meggings/compression/workout clothes.  I shop from both men's and women's sections for these because of my weird frame/size and the strange styles that millennial/post millennial men seem to prefer (or what manufactures foist on us, whomever the more guilty party).  My main preferences are to the all black ""git-r-dun"" variety: good stretch, decent compression (especially in the lower legs) and ease of movement.  Oh, and pockets are a plus, too.  (Why do women buy anything without 'em?)<br /><br />In the ad, then, these looked like my style.  And, fit-wise, they are: the high ""tummy control"" waistband, which on most leggings only produces a pouch, an added ""roll"" and, after a long day of basic moving around, rolls down to belt level, this one isn't overly tight at the top (no dent!) and stays put.  But I could see even before I put them on that something wasn't right: the ""lint.""  On the back were some dots that look a lot like the usual fuzz or lint that sometimes arrives on new orders.  But this fuzz wouldn't go away.  Turns out, these are threads from the outrageous collection of TAGS inside the waistband that would drive me CRAZY against bare skin!  I'd either wear undies, which one should always do while wearing leggings anyway, or CUT THEM OFFF.  Maybe then, with a good thread puller, you could eliminate these pills.  (Note to manufacturer: black thread would be helpful.)<br /><br />My next gripe is the pocket.  There's one, on the right leg.  (Sorry southpaws!)  I guess the idea was to follow the line of the seam for some sort of style statement, but they chose to make the pocket opening a reverse of the norm, not to mention being narrow; it almost defies you to slip your cell phone into it!  (And, once there, don't try to answer a call very fast!)  This will be no big deal if you're used to no pockets, but if you intend to use it, it will, at the very least, take some getting used to.<br /><br />Moving along, as you can see from the side view, there's two more irksome things, the first being bagging behind the knees while standing.  A bit of wrinkle when sitting down is understandable: fabric needs to give.  But bagging while standing?  For a legging?  I have some ten-dollar leggings that dont' do this.  And, lastly, the one thing I didn't notice in the ad: a ""sexy peek-a-boo"" mesh panel on the side/rear of the lower leg.  (Funny - I seem to recall the words ""fully opaque"" in the original ad.)  Needless to say, it's not exactly a guy type feature - I'd have passed if I'd have noticed.  For females looking for a bit of style and sexiness, though, I also have to wonder: is this really a good place to play ""peek-a-boo"" if you're looking for a bit of sexy?  Were I female, I'd think it a bit silly.  Maybe if you have a tattoo in that precise spot, only then does it make sense.<br /><br />So despite these drawbacks, and in all fairness, not being the end user they had in mind for these things, I only deducted one star.  I advise you to check out all of the features, though, and do your own math."
4.0,"The tag has a nice dark print and made of metal.  We use it on my mother's convertible wheelchair as she is in a public facility, but the strap is too short.  I will have to get a longer one so it can be seen better."
4.0,"Cute dress and fits everywhere except length. I am 5'2"" and this is way too long. Otherwise would be cute."
4.0,Love the length. Tight around the arms.
4.0,bought for my lady friend & she loved them and they look good on her feet as well
4.0,Glue used is sloppy
4.0,It is light weight and keeps the mask off my face. I like it.
4.0,It's nicer than I expected! Want other colors!
4.0,I ordered black and green in both sizes L and XL. The XL was too large in the green and L was a much better fit. In the black the L was too small and the XL was the winner. Conclusion: sizing was inconsistent but the pants were super cute.
4.0,"I like the color and the Person material, however it irritates my wrist where the buckle is as the end of the Person isn't finished very smoothly. Will probably go with a NATO because of this"
4.0,"Very good for the price. Mask was OK, but not very comfortable."
4.0,The quality is okay for Amazon clothing. The fit was great! Super cute sleeves. The only issue is I was looking for actual white. This is definitely ivory or off-white.
4.0,Very soft. Thinner than expected.
4.0,"Super cute dress . Elegant as well. I wear an XL & ordered a XXL . I could have done the XL , but it would have been really snug. Happy with this purchase."
4.0,Last layer was oddly longer but I pined it up and it fit fine. Perfect for my occasion light and comfortable.
4.0,Where it all the time with my other hippie jewelry.
4.0,So I had these a bit and never really looked in a full length mirror with good lights. Lmao I have all dark underwear and well you can see that. Still gonna wear them so I guess just be glad you can't see my lady bits or big butt for all its glory
4.0,"The earrings arrived the day after I ordered them.  They are exactly as described.  They arrived in a gift-quality box.  If you are giving these as a gift, the wrapping is already done for you.  I assumed that instead of identical earrings, they would be mirror images, but they are identical.  When worn, one pearl faces forward while the other faces backward.  I'm satisfied.  I don't mind the asymmetrical appearance.  They're very pretty."
4.0,Very pretty color and fit as expected.
4.0,I like it and all the buttons are small and mysterious.
4.0,Cute but too small to notice
4.0,"Came on time, fit great. Noticed 2 spots on different areas. Overall a good buy."
4.0,"Product as described, came in a ziplock bag which I find tacky for shoes....not much support from keeping it from getting smashed."
4.0,A little tight on the length and it ties around the neck and isn't very long.
4.0,Like the hat a lot.  Using it to wear in the kitchen.  Very comfortable for long period wear.
4.0,"Surprisingly, this material was winter comfortable and cooled down quick enough when a hot flash hits. I would have given 5 stars except the front is cut awfully deep. Unlike everything else clothing I have purchased over the past few years, this material actually breathes! Doesn’t stifle me!"
4.0,"Shorter than the picture, and I'm 5'3."
4.0,"The skirt is lovely. Nice,  swingy, loose and cool for summer. The only thing that annoyed me what the orange floral I order, which was so adorable, comes on a navy background. I expected black. I’ll still wear it but I preferred it to be black."
4.0,Thank you for letting me review this product.  Quality is good but I am afraid it runs small for a male wrist.
4.0,"These are nicer than I was expecting. Comfortable fit, good visibility. Shipping was super fast too."
4.0,"Nice slip, good length but the line at hip showed through with the dress I needed for"
4.0,On the small side but fits the Pandora bracelet and looks nice.
4.0,It's a great dress for a day at the beach. I'm 5'11 and it's somewhat short but wearing a swimsuit  under and you're good to go!
4.0,"I love packing cubes. They make packing and unpacking much easier for me. What i didnt care for were the solid colors i had bought from other sellers-solid blue, beige, magenta. I wanted something more feminine. So imagine my surprise when i found these lovely feminine flowery designs. I ordered two sets. Yay! The construction seems solid. And I like the mesh fronts on some and no mesh on others for privacy. The shoe bag is a bit small, im use to getting 2-3 pairs of shoes in 1 bag. And the zipper on the largest bag slighly sticks at times<br /> Nevertheless, i am quite satisfied."
4.0,I was surprised at how cute this was for the price.
4.0,"Super cute but was weirdly very itchy, as other people mentioned."
4.0,"The bands are nice but be careful to check the length. Compared to the original vívofit fit jr adjustable strap, this strap is slightly shorter. If your child has a bigger wrist you will need the extra length that this band will not provide. Otherwise these are very nice."
4.0,"The reviews I read are not promising but decided to purchase anyway I got it in I seem to like it the small words I would agree is a little blurry with your glasses but overall I like it, it covers your entire face not overall big and long stops right at the chin I would still have to wear a mask if I wore it to work but overall it is good"
4.0,Very pretty however the fit is a little tight. Maybe order a size up.
4.0,"They are well made & really shine, however I am having problems getting them in my ears. I may have to send them back."
4.0,I love this dress. It fits well. The skirt swings nicely. The only negative I that it snags easily.
4.0,"This really wrinkles.  It wrinkles badly and doesn't straighten out with just hanging.  I can touch it up in the dryer to get some of the wrinkles out, but ultimately it requires ironing to look nice.  I hang the shirt to dry because I don't want it to shrink, and after two washings, it still fits like new.  I'd order up one size if I wanted to dry the shirt in the dryer though."
4.0,It is cheaper feeling than I guessed but does the job. It was raining the day I received it.
4.0,Just received my boots today 3 days to get her not bad!!! Nice and soft not to mention warm and they fit well good thing I ordered 1 size up LOVE THEM
4.0,I was supper excited to get this but rather a bit disappointed.  It's nice n soft but not as pictured or described. A bit thin and could of gone up a size. But it works.
4.0,Love the top...however should’ve went a size up
4.0,I ordered a size up but they are loose in certain places also very unflattering in the front from being too big
4.0,"I love the memory foam, however it does tend to run a nit small, I find myself sometimes stepping on the back of the shoe and it's not pleasant when that happens.  Other that that I love them."
4.0,"These are really nice photo on both sides. Light weight on the ear which I love. Do wish they were a bit bigger, but they are really nice."
4.0,"Dress was not exactly as shown on the picture. It was way shorter, sleeves were to tight and I do not have big arms. Dress was pretty though and like the fit, but had to return it due to it was too short. Gave 4 stars for great and fast customer service.  Got refunded my money back asap."
4.0,nice sun glasses. vary light plastic design. at first seem cheap but in this case light is great. no problems with durability.
4.0,"Soft, cute print, my daughter loves it, thicker than a plain hoodie.  I haven't seen anyone else with this so easier to find my kid at the playground!"
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful, however the tie is very wide."
4.0,Cute shirt but definitely size up.
4.0,"I love the style and fit but I am short, so I must hem!"
4.0,My son loved them at first and still likes them but he says they are a bit hard to breathe through.
4.0,"Great pajamas, good quality but very expensive, like all pajamagram products. Four stars because they are a little overpriced for pajamas."
4.0,"The color is a lot lighter in person. It looks like an interesting piece that needs a really well-thought outfit so it wouldn't look &#34;funny&#34;. Or perhaps, it's just a little big on me. As for function, it does keep me warm so I would experiment with looks come winter. Next to the armholes are pockets, so that should be useful for keeping your phone."
4.0,considering the lack of products for the oneplus watch this is a very good option and it does work well and is fairly comfortable.
4.0,Material is a little thinner than I expected but still cute.
4.0,"UPDATE: I don't know why, but ever since writing this review, the Chromecast/YouTube control that I mentioned has failed to work. I'm sure it's just a coincidence, but it's an unfortunate one. That was an unexpected capability that I'd grown to rely upon. Sad development.<br /><br />-------Original Review-------<br />I'm a watch fan. I have a modest collection - a mix of automatics and quartz - and recently I started desiring some ""smart"" features. Topping my ""want"" list were a silent alarm, a date function, and filtered notifications. I love the look of a nice analog watch. I didn't want another screen, and I didn't want another thing to charge every night. Additionally, automatic watches can be a pain sometimes because they stop running if you don't wear them for a day or two, (or don't put them on winders) and then you have to reset the time and date. Hybrids set themselves based on your phone time - including when you move into new time zones. Skagen checked those boxes for me.<br /><br />But before I chose Skagen, I tried some of the competition.<br /><br />Originally, I ordered one of the new Withings HR Sport hybrids. They have long battery life (for something with a heart rate monitor and a small screen) and I liked the many fitness tracking features. Unfortunately, that watch looked very underwhelming in person - and the black one I had was very hard to read in low light. I also seemed to have an allergic reaction to the case material and silicone strap. Not good.<br /><br />Next, I tried Kronaby. They're FAR more expensive than Skagen's options, but for me the selling point was their beautiful designs, intricate details and top shelf materials - like sapphire crystal instead of mineral. As a watch lover, I like to know that I'm buying quality. Unfortunately, Kronaby has some inconsistencies in production that caused indices on the watch face to not align properly with the hands. That made something as simple as reading the date difficult - and for the price of their watches, that's absolutely unconscionable. They should be ashamed.<br /><br />So Skagen was my final choice, and I ordered directly from their website. I honestly didn't expect much. I was concerned that the watch would be too chunky, that all the little dots might be hard to read, and that it might look cheap in person. I'm happily proven wrong. I love the look and feel of this watch. I did quickly change the strap for a leather one because the steel mesh felt a little too formal for my casual attire. Fortunately, the quick release feature makes it extremely easy to swap straps as needed. It appears that just about any 20mm strap will fit this watch. You don't have to feel locked-in to Skagen's own offerings.<br /><br />I'm excited that I can easily change the battery on this watch myself instead of needing to take it to a jeweler. No tools are necessary - just a coin or a house key should allow twist access to the battery compartment. I bought a pack of 5 CR2430 batteries for $6, and it will be interesting to see how long I can go on the original battery. Unlike my former Kronaby watches, I can see a battery meter from within the app on my phone. Very handy.<br /><br />The vibration motor has 3 settings: Low, Medium and High. I've been keeping mine on medium and it's serving me well. So far, there was only one morning when the silent alarm failed to wake me up - but I keep my phone alarm set 5 minutes later as a backup.<br /><br />The filtered notifications are great. The hands point to one of the 12 watch positions based on who is calling - and that  gives me enough extra information to know when I need to get my phone out and check it, or when it's something that can probably wait. My girlfriend has a specific spot on the dial. My family has specific spots. My boss has a specific spot. It's such a simple thing - but so very useful.<br /><br />I'm very pleased that the watch hands and hour markers have ""lume"" so that they glow in the dark. To be fair, the glow is VERY faint unless you hold the watch up to a lightbulb for several seconds - but it's just enough to be able to read the time throughout the night once your eyes have adjusted to pitch darkness. I have bad eyesight - so reading the time from my phone or a clock would require a lot of disruptive movement to either get close enough to see, or to put on my glasses. With the watch, I just raise my arm for a second.<br /><br />Here's a feature I wasn't expecting to love: Media controls. If I'm sitting at my desk at work listening to headphones, controls are in-line on my headphone cable. I don't need that on my watch. What I discovered though is that I can play and pause YouTube videos that I'm casting to my TV on a Chromecast. If you use a Chromecast, then you may know how frustrating it can be to have to fiddle around with your phone just to pause something when you need to. Now, I can just hit a button on my watch to play and pause YouTube on my TV - and that's SO refreshing. I wish I could tell you that it also worked with Netflix or other 3rd party apps while casting to a TV, but it only appears to work with YouTube - likely owing to that app's tight integration with Android. However, as long as I'm playing content on my phone (as opposed to casting) the media controls work with any app.<br /><br />The media controls also come in handy while I'm playing a podcast in my car over bluetooth. Instead of having to reach out to my phone and mess with the touch screen while I'm driving, I can just play and pause with a button on my watch as needed.<br /><br />Lastly, having a dial dedicated to step count is a real motivator. When it's right there for you to see throughout the day, it reminds you to get up and try to make some more progress. Again, simple - but surprisingly useful.<br /><br />The combination of design and function make this Skagen a real winner for me. I only knock a star off for these reasons:<br /><br />1. I really wish it was sapphire crystal instead of mineral for added peace of mind in avoiding scratches (I would absolutely pay more to have that.)<br /><br />2. I'm disappointed that the watch doesn't use Bluetooth 5. If it did, a feature like ""ring my phone"" which can be so helpful in locating a phone you've misplaced, would have far better range. With Bluetooth 4.1, I have to walk around my apartment pressing the button until I'm close enough to get it to ring - and that nearly defeats the purpose.<br /><br />3. I'm ever-so-slightly bothered that the watch face has design elements that Skagen no longer uses for different notifications. (My understanding is that they stopped using the 4 color bars on the face for custom notification to instead use the 12 hour markers. This gives users more notification flexibility - which is great - but I wish they'd still let us use those color areas for something.)<br /><br />In the end, the price is right, the features are great, and I really enjoy the look of this watch. I hope it lasts a long while, and I highly recommend Skagen hybrid watches."
4.0,Love them. My only issue is that one of the screws has already started to strip out.
4.0,Lay seem to b the correct size but the top slides down
4.0,love the comfort ... not a ton of support but fine for smaller breasted women.
4.0,"I wore this with a $450.00 Mother of the Bride dress and the set really outshone the outfit!  All pieces did need a little polishing when received but this was mentioned in the product description.  Very comfortable to wear - chain didn't irritate neck, earrings didn't pinch ears.  Earrings are large enough that they could have used a round back rather than the smaller one supplied, though this was easily corrected by simply switching out backs with some from a different pair I already had.  Ring and bracelet not sturdy enough for daily wear but do very well for a night out or occasional work day.<br /><br />May 04, 2019:  am buying my second set.  I loved the first and someone else must have loved it as well.  Someone went to the trouble of breaking into my home , taking only my expensive, real gem, gold and silver jewelry as well as this set.  They left the rest of my costume jewelry behind, so this must have looked as good to them as it did to me!"
4.0,I like they way they fit
4.0,"I bought the black glasses. They are beautiful. But they are not mirrored, as the photos seemed to indicate."
4.0,"Product looks and fits nice, perfect addition to my sportster"
4.0,"I purchased these shorts in size 12, they were enormous but the print was adorable. I sized down to a 10 and they fit well. At the same time I ordered a different pattern also in a 10 and those were also far too large. I haven’t washed them yet, hoping the bold colors don’t bleed."
4.0,I was so pleased with the jeans...I ordered another pair.
4.0,I received a 40 D instead of a 34DDD...somewhat dissapointed as it rides my back but I am still a fan as  my other 3 other Ekouaer bras are perfect. This was a packing error and we all make mistakes.
4.0,"This dress surprised me with how great the back of the dress is concealing under garments. Not see thru at all! I’m 5.4 1/2 135lbs and while I think the dress is great, I don’t like how the material doesn’t hug my curves... so it makes me feel kind of frumpy. I feel like after hours of wear it would stretch out too much. I saw a previous review that mentioned how the sequence has no pattern to it whatsoever, and I found this to be accurate. So if your OCD like me, not being able to smooth out the sequence to lay one way is going to drive you crazy. Overall it is a beautiful dress and I think I would love more if I lost some belly fat, as this dress does not hide it well."
4.0,"Comfortable stocking, use it for compression and Planter Fasciitis.  Only feature I don't care for is the height the side copper of them come up the side of the heel.  No matter what shoe you wear, dress, casual or activity the copper material shows above the heel side."
4.0,"This little dress was adorable for our unicorn photo shoot for my 4 yr old. However, it is NOT a dress that will get much wear. The dress ran really small, my girl is right at the in between stage of 4t and 5t, so i opted for the 5t, and it was very snug, but the tulle flares out beautifully. There was a defect on one side of the waist, but wasn't very noticeable. For the price, it worked great for what we needed it for. I now intend to let it be a dress-up outfit and possibly a halloween fairy."
4.0,Product took a while until delivered but arrived as advertised
4.0,Super cute on but does run a little big!
4.0,Got a lot of compliments on this top.  I took the string out and rolled the neck under so the grommets wouldn't show.  Really happy I bought it.
4.0,nice quality soft.
4.0,Not bad for the price. It’s not real leather though.
4.0,I didn't like how it looked or fit but a friend of mine loved it
4.0,"I really like this item - the fabric is nice quality with a heavier than expected weight without being heavy. It's soft and the color is rich. I like how it's made and even how it fits, sort of. It's easily a size too large even though I am slightly bigger than the measurements in the size chart for Medium. I'm 5'5"", 122 lbs, and around 34-27-35. The small should fit me just right. I'm returning it and getting a small."
4.0,A little thinner than expected but will be fine with a long shirt
4.0,Looks pretty good for a knock off.Juzt don't like the red on the drawstrings
4.0,"Nice top, I thought it may be small at first but come and fit perfectly. The material is quality and the design is made well. Everyone loved this."
4.0,"The dress is actually bright yellow. I needed a mustard yellow. I ordered a size small. I am 5’4, 155 pounds and 36 B. The dress is really nice and made of good quality it was tight around my Brest area. I hope this helps someone."
4.0,"I really like the dress. It is somewhat small for an 8-10 however. It fits me fine, but is snug. I usually wear an 8 and was afraid it might be too big."
4.0,Well it's a nice belt with a few issues. First it smell like mildew and after almost a month it still smells a little. It leaves color on your pants where it was rubbing but that washes away in the laundry. The quality is good otherwise.
4.0,I got alot of compliments  fits really nice. I really like the fit I will order again.......Ty Carieann Havnen
4.0,They were bigger than expected but they are comfy! I have always been a size small but the small can be a medium. A plus side is they don't ride up at all. Overall good product.
4.0,Not the best but will suffice. Very pretty.
4.0,This is very flattering. I really like it.
4.0,This is cute top. It’s more of a long sleeve shirt than a sweater. It’s also very fitted and runs a bit small.
4.0,"This Fitbit watch band looks great and is very sturdy, however the band is to small for my husband who has Normal sized wrists. I need to see about getting more links."
4.0,These are more like knee high tights because you really can’t scrunch it down to mid calf area. Cute enough and the quality is pretty good.  It’d be good with almost knee high boots or full knee high boots - not the ‘typical’ boots (like the ones that are about 4 inches above ankle).
4.0,"The form and the pattern look hot on my wife!  I love it, and so does she.  Sure has a lot of &#34;WOW&#34; appeal"
4.0,"This is a cute, flowy dress. I'm 5'3"" around 135 pounds and ordered a medium. I wish I would have ordered a small. It's pretty loose and knee length, rather than above the knee. Still cute though!"
4.0,"Really beautiful color and if you Arden one size larger, it will be perfect. Love this top."
4.0,"The watch serves its purpose well and has a long (est. 10000 hr) battery life. Keeps time amazingly well and has a stopwatch, month, day, and day of the week functions as well as operating in both 12 and 24 hr formats. The led for night time leaves a good bit to be desired. It is not a backlit watch, rather, the led is built into the side and will only light the first third of the watch. Comes with the retail display holder if you like having your watches mounted in a display fashion while not in use. This watch is only splash, perspiration, and light rain rated, don't go swimming with it."
4.0,Warm and nice to the touch. My husband loves them. We will be ordering another pair.
4.0,Like it but pilling now and I have only washed it maybe 6 times. Have not worn it much
4.0,Very pretty material. Runs small.
4.0,"I got this bathing suit for my wife. She’s never owned a “cheeky” style before, but she said this one was a good in between and helped her feel covered enough to not be too self-conscious. She got the small since she has a short torso. The medium likely would have been too big, but the issue she had was fitting the tight waist band above her hips. The black waist band doesn’t stretch very much, so keep that in mind when ordering. Overall, the quality is pretty good and it is a flattering one piece. Although she does not recommend it for too much swimming or activity since the top is very open and you can easily slip out."
4.0,The colors and quality of the print is amazing. My son loves it. It is on the thin side so it’s great for layering on cold days but definitely not a only thing needed for warmth.
4.0,"This shirt is great! I ordered teal because I heard that color is made in the actual LQ factory and higher quality. It's nice, pretty thick, and a gorgeous color. The sleaves are more like 3/4 length, but look great when scrunched up a little. I am 5'6&#34; 125lbs and the size small was perfect for me. Normally I wear XS shirts, but I wanted it to fit around my booty and am very happy with size S."
4.0,"The zipper's not the best, but overall it's so cute that it's not a real issue."
4.0,"Because it looked awesome, I took all the links out making it small as I can and fits perfect my battery still works and had it for about two weeks now heard a lot about bad betterys not true on my just don't use it every min use it when you want to know time, other than that some how my settings got reset  on there on don't even know how that even happen"
4.0,"Me quedo grande, bello el vestido y la tela."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I am 5'3 130 pounds and I got size Small, its fits good! The material is thin (not see thru thin) and the dress is a little short for my taste, but I wear it with black leggings and looks great. I am very happy with this dress."
4.0,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It has such a soft lining and is really nice.
4.0,"First time I tried one of these belts. I like having more control over the slide adjustment than over holes, which can be a big jump in between. Seems to be of good quality, the price is fair. I am assuming the belt will last longer than belt with holes, but we will see. Belt also came with what appears to be a key ring with a leather strap on it with a snap (Se pic). There does not seem to be anyway to attach it to the belt so I am assuming an extra &#34;gift&#34;. No mention made in the description or with the product when it came. The box the belt came in is very extravagant. Perhaps some people like the quality of the packaging, but I would prefer less cost through less expensive packaging. So far I like the belt a lot!!<br />After 7 months I find that the buckle falls off as the compression teeth which hold the leather in the buckle have lost their grip. This occurs only when the tongue of the belt is taken out of the buckle. A person could cut the belt in order to relocate the gripping area, but this again would only work for a time.<br />I return again later even after the 7 months with praise for Marino. They have a Warranty which states that if you cut too much off of the belt and the fit can only be too tight, they will send you a new belt. This they did! I certainly like this Warranty as it has benefited me, but I am more concerned that the company remain in business for future purchases than file bankruptcy! Thank you Marino!"
4.0,Cute  All very bright silver but Daughter is going to do various projects w them. Most will be spray painted.
4.0,Beautifully made except for the zipper! The zipper seem to catch constantly and I was concerned it was going to break. Plus I am only 5'1 and 145lb it would look better on a tall slender lady.
4.0,The quality of the canvas was what I expected it to be but I would have preferred a shorter handle. The description was not so clear as to the length.....or maybe I missed that part on the description. Otherwise it’s fine and It will do.
4.0,"I really like these but I wouldn't call them compression tops. I'm petite but busty - I got a size small and the shirts are still a little loose - but so comfy and I generally wear them under t-shirts when I go to martial arts classes or places where I have to be upside down. It stays put when you cartwheel or handstand. I would even wear one casually with jeans wearing the right bra. They are very* slightly see through, but not so much that you can't wear alone with a bra."
4.0,Love these leggings! I have three pairs by this brand but my only problem is they tend to stretch out and become to big in the waist so I suggest buying a size smaller
4.0,"I know the picture shows the dress having some trailing on the ground, but wow. I'm 5'10"" and was wearing 2"" inch heels, (making me 6ft!) and I still had to hem it up two inches just to make it walk-able. It was a beautiful dress, fit me perfectly otherwise, and I got a million compliments on it. Just be prepared for a long dress."
4.0,"This case is so cute. The giraffe is not as bright as I thought it would be, therefore I gave it four stars instead of five."
4.0,Love the watch other then it says fits 7 1/2 wrist but still little tight
4.0,They are even better than expected. They do not have a lining but they are good quality and fit well. Good work and casual wear trousers. It was also the color I needed. Will buy in other colors as well.
4.0,We love these but they feel really thin. I worry about the durability.
4.0,"Thankfully, I only needed a 16!"
4.0,"Bold, attractive, fun, well constructed. This is by no means a serious dive watch, but it is a fun dive-styled watch. I would call this a cool summer watch. Workmanship is good and the price point is not bad for what you get. The watch comes packaged very nicely in an attractive box. I was disappointed and surprised to find that this is built in China, but I suppose that is fine for  what it is."
4.0,This is the cutest swim top. The material was very strong and it was very colorful. The only problem is this brand runs pretty big. So I had to send it back 🙁 and order another in a smaller size. I was so anxious to wear it. Lol but I think it's a great product. Just maybe order a size down from what you're used to wearing.
4.0,Fits well. Will wait and see how it looks like after the first wash.
4.0,Carhartt quality. Minus one star for lack of inside pockets.
4.0,Super comfy activewear! And the side pocket is HUGE!! There is only one pocket in the leggings but it goes almost to the knee. The fabric does not seem see through and is relatively thick. 130lb 5’4” size small
4.0,Different. Loved it!
4.0,"Hands down , cute Dress ..."
4.0,"I bought these for my 6 year old niece and myself.  It took a while to come in, which I later learned was because they were coming from China.  My niece was so excited to wear her bracelet. Only issue we had was it was way to big for her little wrist."
4.0,The spacer beads were shipped from China which was a surprise to me. I didn't see any mention of this in the description and info. It took 2 weeks for delivery. I just wish I had known this ahead of time instead of wondering if they were lost in the mail. That's why only 4 stars instead of 5. The spacers are nice and bright silver as described and look of good quality.
4.0,Fits great. If I could change one thing I would like it to be not so flared out at the bottom makes it look funny.
4.0,I really wanted to love this but it was huge! I am 125lbs and a small was like an xl on me.
4.0,"Shirt is good quality , flowers are painted on so I’m hoping they won’t tarnish in the dryer. Sizing of arms is a little long but otherwise nice shirt !"
4.0,"Slim, small, basically a stacked credit card holder with end pieces with a sturdy rubber band to hold everything together.  Seems very secure but at the expense of quickly finding a particular card."
4.0,This hat is super cute and the material is comfortable. It doesn't pull at my hair and it doesn't slip off easily. It falls well in the back (no awkward cone or anything). I'm going to really enjoy sporting this over the next few cold months!
4.0,It's good. Looks a little bit cheap but you get what you pay for. It doesn't come in a box.
4.0,"Pretty, silky, great for holding a ponytail, but not covering your head for a retro feel."
4.0,Good shoes but a bit tight
4.0,"I like the. Clutch but it was advertised to have a strong magnetic closure. There is only a snap and no magnetic properties at all. Very disappointed since I’ve been looking for some time, I’ll use until I find clutch with the desired magnetic closure."
4.0,Looks good on.  Pockets are great.
4.0,"I don't mean like yes, look at that fat ass in tight shorts. Its more like girl let that cookie breath a little. Like hit the gym girl those are too tight. I love them outside of that one part."
4.0,they are good but very small size than usual sizes so buy 2 sizes bigger than yours
4.0,"Love the detailing of the hat, but the bucket is actually a wee bit too deep.  There is still room at the top of the hat even when I have it pulled down to my ears.  Wish I could have tried it on before I bought it.  But, it's a Jeep-thing so I'll keep it anyway."
4.0,"I haven't taken them out yet, but by feel and look they're fairly decent. Will try to update once I've worn them a few times to confirm if they are as durable as I expect."
4.0,For bragging rights!
4.0,I loved how it looked on me but definitely order a size or two up cus it can be tight. It was I little tight on the arms  for the jacket and the shirt it was a little tight on the chest area. Over all it was vary nice and I loved it
4.0,It is larger than expected. I recommend sizing down.
4.0,Must wear a tank underneath
4.0,"The skirt was good, but somehow the packaging for the skirt partially melted onto the skirt. I had to use scissor to sort of scrap it off. After plastic was scraped off the skirt was it fine so far, just hoping it doesn't develop any holes in the material in the long term. Also only removed the plastic since it is located around the area of my knees so it would be completely visible to others.<br />***tip for the seller maybe ship the skirt inside out, so if this does not occur with packaging again, so it won't impact the visible portion of the skirt. Or reconsider packaging method to include paper between the skirt and plastic to avoid this occurring again in the future"
4.0,"I thought this a must need for my LSAT exam. The color blocks really help you mange your time and the watch is very easy to use. All you have to do is remember to reset it after every section. I wish it was an automatic timer because I rather not do the math, but rather just see how much actual time I have left in every section."
4.0,"Love these yoga pants, they're good lounge pants. They fit great, but they're not completely squat proof. I wear them around and to classes and such but I wouldn't suggest wearing them to the gym. I ordered my actual size as well."
4.0,My daughter was so excited about it
4.0,Lovely got so many compliments on it!
4.0,Cute ring. My daughter loved it! Good thing I bought 2 as the first one broke immediately. Nice for the price!
4.0,"Fits over my glasses pretty well, kind of large and clunky and takes up lots of space, they don't fit in my car's sun glass compartment. the sides are a bit think so it creates a larger blind spot in the peripherals.<br /><br />But they are a life saver for people who wear glasses and need eye protection from the sun."
4.0,"Fits great,  awesome quality."
4.0,Material sencillo
4.0,Some were solid and some had a red stone eye and adjustable
4.0,Great glasses for my grandson who is extremely hard on glasses. Light and fit snugly without falling off.
4.0,They will work in certain situations but I am going to re-order
4.0,Thought they would be a thicker weave material not so thin. But I like the color.
4.0,Zipper Broke in a week.  Nice bag but week metal on the zipper.<br /><br />Update:<br />Sent a replacement bag from manufacturer.  It took a while to get here but awesome service.  It’s not a $3000 bag but it is good quality.  Just right for my wife.
4.0,Would be a 5 if they were bigger
4.0,"Here's the thing- the silicone goes ALL the way around and underneath. So, there's no slipping a shoe on with these. They seem like decent quality but make sure you know what you're ordering. I had to send them back."
4.0,Cute dress but it doesn't stay on your shoulders very well.  Pulls up every time you move.
4.0,"I am a perfect size 8 at 5'10&#34;<br />Runs small, returning both pairs<br />I ordered 8 Long"
4.0,"great product but small, keep in mind the size"
4.0,"Great dress for the office or professional attire. The dress was slightly bigger than expected, especially in the chest/underarm area. Received a lot of compliments. I will definitely be buying another dress in a different color."
4.0,Nice pullover. The material of the shirt is comfortable and made well. Great for early morning walks.
4.0,"These boots are well made (and made in the USA), very comfortable and look great. They have not left black marks on my socks like many other oil-tanned boots that I own. My only negative critique about them is that the laces are a bit on the short side. Not a big deal as I was planning on replacing them with black colored laces anyhow. Not crazy about the brown and black mixed sole? Having the soles dyed all black at the local shoemaker's shop was surprisingly inexpensive. Overall a nice boot at a nice price."
4.0,Chain came with latch broken
4.0,Helped improved my vision at night. I can drive more safely now at night. Without lights blinding me.<br />I would recommend this item.
4.0,Lightweight but feels delicate (like it could easily break). Great lens quality!
4.0,"This ended up being a great dress for Halloween! I am 5’6” and 140 lbs and the medium was slightly baggy in the midsection and arms, but that’s better than being too snug in both of those areas. I’m surprised at the other reviews saying it runs small? It doesn’t have any stretch, so keep that in mind. Had I not waited until the last minute to buy this, I would’ve exchanged it for a small. But I got several compliments on it and it was great for trick-or-treating with toddlers all night (aka drinking wine in my yeti cup while walking around the neighborhood)."
4.0,"I think the product was great. My son loves Ryan’s world.  The fit was good, and as to be expected."
4.0,This bracelet was a gift so I can only give response on what I liked about item.  Lobster claw clasp was very good & a must have  including the adjustable length so all 2 were great.  The color was ok (hence the 4 stars)  for the price & the style was more contemporary & the silver setting was smooth /didn't roll on wrist.
4.0,"I love this dress. I've worn it out to dinner several time and get tons of complements. I normally wear it with a thick belt, but I've also worn it as is. I love the fact that it has pockets. I was kind of worried that when it arrived it would not fit that way that it did on the model, but when I tried it on I was amazed at how great it looked. The red is nice and deep and it seems well made. No loose seams or thread. Definitely will recommend. As a reference I'm 5'8 and 160lb."
4.0,"I really like these sunglasses. My boyfriend wanted a pair of the horn rimmed so we picked these out. I made fun of him for liking the style, but when I got them I actually liked them on myself as well. So now I wear a pair and he wears a pair. The only thing he was disappointed with was that the yellow/red pair were just dyed that color and the tint you see through isn't yellow-ey. It's just dark, but that's the pair I wear anyways."
4.0,I made bracelets with them ☺ they come in different sizes! But perfect for this!
4.0,Easy fast sturdy
4.0,I like the fabric and the design. I’ll use it as a robe or for lounging around the house. This is the fifth caftan I have purchased by Ellen Tracy.
4.0,"Good enough.<br />But I have a thick frame, so it holds on the very ends of the fasteners (don't expect it to be longer that 15 cm).<br />Also, not-so-waterproof and the zipper looks quite weakly"
4.0,"It's a ball cap, Four Winn's fits great cause it's adjustable."
4.0,"The Sizes--the reviews are true. I wear sizes 2-4, so I ordered a 6. Plenty roomy, and mine did NOT shrink after first wash.<br />Wash & Dry – like many fabrics shipping from parts unknown, mine smelled heavily like pesticide (e.g., Raid) upon arrival,<br />but it machine washed and dried on gentle very nicely. True, no tag, but feels like rayon.<br />Ironing--only thing that needed serious starching down was the V-neck lining which was poorly constructed on mine.<br />The Trim--the fuzzy dingle-balls on mine were cheap looking and annoying, but safe to trim off above the thread line.<br />The Look--with those touchups, I have a super cute long-sleeved tunic. LOVE the pattern, colors and shaping!<br />Also just pushed up the sleeves to elbow length, and it's even more adorable.<br />The Value -- very cheap price, arrived early, and with a little work became one of the coolest and most versatile pieces I own.<br /> Great with or without capris or camisole underneath. Lots of compliments."
4.0,"Love it! I just wish the zipper part wasn't an illusion of gold (it's yellow and white). I wish it was gold just like the other parts of the bag. It's comfortable to carry, my laptop fit, my 3 ring binder fit...and it's just so cute!"
4.0,this bad holds a lot and has three different ways to carry it which is nice.  good for everyday and not to worry about tossing it anywhere.  only complaint is that since there is no firm construction on the inside it is very difficult to find things. everything is loosey goosey inside.
4.0,really pretty.  my niece really likes them
4.0,"These shoes are narrow, but my 2.5 year old loved them. She was comfortable enough to wear them all day, and loves that they light up. Overall a good buy."
4.0,Product met my expectations.<br />My wife’s surprise Holliday gift and she was pleased to be able to wear the earrings before Thanksgiving.
4.0,These socks are super soft but do not provide much warmth. Great for what they are intended- layering and wearing with warm boots.
4.0,"I wear a 1X. To make sure it fit, I bought a 3X. The problem is the clothes are too small for full figured women no matter how much they say order a size bigger. I ordered two sizes bigger and it's still a little snug. Other than that I love the dress I have a red one and a blue one."
4.0,cute dress. fits well. I just over 5 feet tall and can wear a low heel to avoid alterations
4.0,The hardware is heavy and irritating on my shoulder. I am going to purchase a strap pad to cover it up. I do recommend overall.
4.0,This is a nice wrist band that I will wear when I not wearing a watch. The design is unique as well.
4.0,I like that the shirt stretches because it runs a little small!
4.0,"Minimal materials, butsufficient.  Protection, without unecessary design!"
4.0,More casual then it looked. My niece will probably love it.
4.0,For large heads only
4.0,"Shorts are super cute, fit a little tighter then what i like personally. But feel like the material just needs to stretch a bit. But otherwise love the style and length! The high-waist is perfect"
4.0,"This wand is absolutely gorgeous. It’s heavy and feels like a really good quality product. My only complaint (and for my costume, it’s kinda important) is that the wand looked a lot darker in the photo than it is in person. I’ll make it work, but I wish it had been darker. Otherwise, I’m really pleased with this purchase."
4.0,This is a cute dress.  My daughter loves the pockets and says it is very comfortable.
4.0,It is a heavy fabric.
4.0,Was a great gift.
4.0,Overall good zippers do stick. Had to use soap bar to get the zipper move
4.0,"Bought this watch for my wife to add to her collection, she loves it. It's a great buy."
4.0,"Not suitable for my need of a backpack as a college student, but then this is designed to be a hiking pack (somewhat small for books). I need to keep looking. I got this because every backpack I buy shortly rips open, or the zipper breaks, under the pressure of carrying the numerous hardback books of my many classes. This is more durable but smaller than I estimated. In my opinion, a flaw is the design of the shoulder straps which are simply straps as you see on the backpack's exterior with a little padding in the middle. By design, the padding is not entirely attached to the straps."
4.0,"I am 5ft 120, large size a little tight on the shoulder. I like the style of the coat."
4.0,I bought this for my husband he has been real pleased with it.. It washes an dryers great.
4.0,This dress is great for the price. The neckline in the back flips up which i don't like and the material is stretchy so I may need to order a smaller size. It seems as though the dress runs large.
4.0,"Just what I expected<br />Warm & comfy, good fit"
4.0,Plenty of pairs for the money! My son loved all the colors.
4.0,Love my earrings. But they are to small. Will pay more attention to size details from now on. But they look good and wear well so I will keep them. Thanks
4.0,These lenses are great but don’t last as long as I would expect
4.0,"I really wanted to love this. I saw a ton of ads for this on Tiktok, and it seemed sooo cute. I did like the idea of the style, but the way it actually ended up fitting was weirdly unflattering. The material is LOVELY, it seems high-quality and looks very nice. It's also very comfortable to wear, but if you want to look good in it that may be a different story.<br /><br />I think this is designed for a very specific body shape and ratio of different parts, so if your body doesn't follow those proportions, it won't look nice and will bunch up/fold up weird in specific places. The waist was too big on me and the front of the hip area was too big. However, no other part was too big. It's also not very stretchy, so it either fits or it doesn't. The bottoms were very unflattering, but the top was a great sports bra (it fit, offered support without being too tight, and looked cute). It has some padding, but not too much."
4.0,It is beautiful watch but unfortunately is heavy.
4.0,Made nicely a bit lg
4.0,"I bought these for party favors for my 5-year old's birthday party.  The kids seemed to love them.  I dropped one star because some of the lights were harder to switch on than others and just a couple didn't turn on, so I'd advise making sure that you order a few more than you need.  I tested each light that I put in the party favor bags to make sure that the switch was easy to turn on and weeded out the more difficult ones.  Other than that issue, these were a hit with the kids!<br /><br />Some reviewers mention that the rubber band on the light is kind of flimsy.  We had purchased some of these lights at a local retail store and they had a more sturdy black elastic around them, but for the cost and use as a kid's novelty item, the cheaper rubber band-ish elastic didn't really bother me."
4.0,We liked the shirt but had to send it back because it was much too big.
4.0,Item fit as I expected. I did order a larger size as I was expecting this to run small
4.0,Toe rings were great - especially for the price.  Bought these to go on vacation to the beach and i’ve Been wearing the same one for almost a week.  Pretty durable.
4.0,"I have dropped my phone in the toilet, in puddles, and have fell in pools with my phone in my pocket.  A waterproof case was definitely appealing to me.  The case itself is easy to install.  There are 2 pieces- front and back and they enclose the phone fully and there is a rubber gasket at the seam to prevent water from entering the case.  The camera, the home button, the cut out on the back and the speakers are protected by a clear film.  There are screw on covers for the headphone jack to keep water out.  Not only does it offer water proof protection, it does offer some shock absorption and protection.  All side buttons are functional with this case on.<br />I do not recommend this case for everyday use though.  The screen is not as responsive with this particular coating and the speaker quality is diminished.  Also, people hear an echo when talking to you.  I only use this case when I will be doing an activity near water.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was received at no cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,"They breath better than I expected and definitely fit nicely; although, I wish the package area was a little more roomy but overall I do love them and will likely buy again. My girl loves the camo ones too! ha ha They fit slim so order a size bigger than normal."
4.0,"This is a cute cotton t-shirt, but definitely order a larger size.  It is pretty small.  The wing cut outs are cool and stand up to several washings."
4.0,Very nice...a bit too large but my daughter will grow into it
4.0,"I orderde about 10 scarves, I got 1 scarf today it's pretty and of good quality but scarf was wrapping<br />just in a zipper bag. Your order pictures are the products are in the box.<br />Other scarves were packaged and delivered beautifully like gift wrapping."
4.0,"The pants are lightweight and the fit is perfect. Worn pants through a rain event and water seem to be repelled and pants were dry within minutes after getting wet.<br /> JezMax Men's Lightweight Quick Dry Exercise Shorts Gym Running Shorts for Men with Zipper Pockets,"
4.0,My husband loves them becuz of the pocket clip
4.0,"This was a great buy for the price.  Some of the buttons are prone to falling off, but it isn't anything that some simple stitching won't fix.  In my opinion, this isn't a big deal.  I usually don't wear it buttoned up anyways, so it isn't a problem.  The sweater looks exactly as pictured.  The color is a tiny bit lighter than what is shown, but not by a lot.  The color is beautiful, and I am always getting compliments when I wear this sweater.<br /><br />It's your average oversized knit cardigan, so it will fit loose.  I wouldn't say it fits loose enough to order a size down, however.  For the price, the quality is pretty good. It will keep you warm during the cold weather (I live in the West Coast, so it is that type of cold).  The material is knit, so it can get a bit fuzzy if you don't take care of it.  If you're sensitive to knit or yarn material, I can see the material being a problem if you don't wear a long sleeve.  For me, I don't have an issue with any material, so the material doesn't bother me.  I would say that I wear this cardigan as much as my more expensive ones.<br /><br />Overall, for the price this was an excellent buy.  If you don't have issues with the above problems, I would highly recommend that you purchase this cardigan.  I've already bought two more, and have been equally pleased with those purchases.  I plan on purchasing more in the future."
4.0,These are cute little disco balls with bling. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because some of the posts seemed a little rough.
4.0,"At first glance thought they were to large, but they fit. I haven't tried working out in them yet. You would pay a lot more if you bought them from Target."
4.0,"Items are great quality.. I would recommend. The only concern I had with my order, I received too many boy charms (Spiderman) I wish would have more girl options."
4.0,"Glad I bought a size larger, it ran small on my son.  Also wish it had a loop behind your neck for hanging it up on a coat hook.  Nice looking jacket."
4.0,"fit a little tight, but feel good,"
4.0,Excellent quality dress!! Worth the price.
4.0,Christmas gift.  My co-worker loved it
4.0,"Very roomy.  I like how it doesn't fade in color, My zip is a little risky, but I do enjoy my bag.  I actually like the face I bought it. thanks."
4.0,Cute but one earring was put together wrong.  Had to take it apart and redo it.
4.0,"The selves were a little short for my arms and the zipper gets stuck often. Other then that, the length is perfect and the material is pretty good and durable."
4.0,Great quality and an adorable set. the pants were a bit large but he'll grow into them!
4.0,"I love the color of this!  It’s very much what I hoped, I just wish it was a little longer so I could wrap it around again."
4.0,It's a nice stuff.
4.0,"This case is really simple and cute. It is smooth to the touch and slim, and adds a bit of grip, but I wouldn’t expect much for drop protection. I have a dark grey case made by this same company (AutumnFall) which I have had for about eight months and LOVE. I thought I’d get purple to use in the summer. Unfortunately, I think this light lavender color looks very strange on my black phone so I don’t think I’ll use it. Also, the apple logo on the back has changed a bit; it’s bigger now, which I don’t think seems as realistic. I do think this color would look much better on a white phone."
4.0,Great weekend errands bag
4.0,"I'm 5'6, 140 lbs and it fits fairly close to the model in the photo. Decent fabric, it's that soft, fuzzy, acrylic you get from throw blankets in this price range. My biggest complaint is that it strands of the poncho keep peeling off the bottom - I wish they had done a slightly better job of stitching along the edges."
4.0,The pants are longer than I expected.  I am short and it was about 1.5 to 2 inches bigger than I thought. Really look at measurements for these.
4.0,"Just like the description says. I ordered Male medium and it fit perfect. Not like other shirts that are not true medium. I like the shirt a lot, but I gave it four stars because its an &#34;OK&#34; material made from fruit of the loom. HD cotton 100% cotton"
4.0,Very fine and delicate chain...
4.0,"should offer a length size,had to have them shortened. Other than that they fit great and are warm and comfortable."
4.0,These look really nice and well made but were smaller than what I anticipated.
4.0,"A bit tighter than I anticipated (L/XL size), and I don't need to cinch down the cord that allows you to reduce the effective hat-size. Nice feature for some I'm sure. I figure the hat will stretch a bit over time, so I'm happy with the size.<br /><br />Material is nice, and the construction seems quite good. Lots of vents, so I know this will be my go-to hat when I'm active on a warm-to-hot day.<br /><br />Another nice touch is the small(!) zippered pocket on the front for carrying something (a $10 bill for buying a beer at the end of a hike?!).<br /><br />Overall, quite pleased with the hat, and I know I'll get years of use out of it. If I had to &#34;complain&#34; about one feature, it would be that the brim is not rigid (like a ball-cap) at all. Kind of makes it a crusher-style Bucket hat... and I'm fine with that."
4.0,Very cute.  I received a ton of complements.
4.0,Order it for my daughter's school dance  perfect fit a little big on the top but it was ok she love it!!!
4.0,Really very warm and nice fitting
4.0,Very cute but too small for what was expected. Ended up returning them.
4.0,"The earrings are well made, the size is right, and they look nice, but they are thick, so they aren't very feminine.  I will have to order a different style."
4.0,"Nice, soft material and I love the pockets! I ordered the medium and it was a little large but not totally unflattering. It was also a little long (I'm 160cm) so I need to hem it, but that's to be expected with my height."
4.0,Very nice looking bracelet. Quality so far seems good and well made. Likely silver plated only!
4.0,"I got lots of compliments at work today. Dress was nice, but has little give around where it switches from lines to solid. I am 5'3&#34; 137 pounds and a small fit just right. Thinking about getting one more in a different color.."
4.0,"I usually wear waist size 27-28 but I got a small because I wanted it to fit high wasted and I didn’t want it to be too long. It fits but it’s snug on my waist, still love it though. Does not stretch. I’m 5’4 and 130lbs. It’s a really cute skirt and good quality. I’ll probbaly buy a medium too."
4.0,"Overall, these have been great undershirts for my husband. The size was a bit of annoyance to figure out, but doable. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the bottom seams: after a few washes, they start to fray and unravel. However, the material seems to hold up even without the seams."
4.0,very conformable
4.0,Item Delivered as promised.  That's one of the things I love about Amazon.  Earrings are very nice BUT lots smaller than expected.
4.0,Very cute! Can't wait to wear it as part of my costume. To answer a question yes the brim is soft and droopy.
4.0,"First off let me say how much more sparkly these are in person than in the photos.  The beaded detail is really pretty and there are stones all around it.  I normally wear an 8.5 so ordered this size.  The sandals themselves are very cushiony and comfortable.  The size for me, seemed a bit small lengthwise and narrow for my foot. As I said May just not have been a good match for me. But they are very cushioned and pretty."
4.0,"They are great & colors are beautiful! I usually fit any glasses, but these fall of my head a lot which is really annoying but they were inexpensive & super cute colors!"
4.0,"Although it is a bit too large, it's a beautiful, well made hat. I look forward to wearing it."
4.0,I keep cold toes. Purchased these to go into the Smoky Mountains.
4.0,"Really pretty and delicate; my 18-year-old granddaughter said &#34;Go, Nana!&#34;"
4.0,Love the dress.  A tad small but it will be ok.
4.0,Nice but thin matirial
4.0,"Tighter than expected, but I still wear it to work out, good support"
4.0,"I got this for my daughter who has a blobfish obsession. She loves it and carries it with her on her backpack and plays with it; she even makes clothing for it...<br />But she's had it barely a month and a half and the thing is filthy and pilled. The thing was made as a decoration, not a lovie, but my daughter uh... really loves playing with it and it doesn't hold up in the durability department."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but I’m glad I didn’t buy it for a gift because it came in the mail slightly bent. Would suggest better packaging.
4.0,I like the shirt but it runs small to go up a size!
4.0,"I'm a year round cyclists and do a lot of riding in the snow, mostly off road with the Mt. and cross bike. My biggest weakness riding in the winter  is cold feet and over the years I've tried many different shoe/sock/bootie combo's to keep the feet warm. Shoe size is normally a 42 and I bought this shoe as a 43. With the bigger size I can comfortably wear an extra thick smartwool sock without cutting off the circulation. With this I'm good at 30 to 35 degs. Anything colder then I'll slide on a pair of booties then I'm good to 20 degs. Booties do slide over these shoes easily. So what I do like about this shoe is the fit, good construction, and just feels comfortable. I believe the price was good and for me the level of warmth for me is just right. My only complaint is when I slide on the shoe the heel cup on the inside can curl down a little and I have to jam my finger in there to pull it out."
4.0,Fits great but there is a lot of material in the stomach area almost fit as maternity wear.
4.0,This is a dressier version of a sweatpant and I really dig that. They have a wider-leg fit and a cropped length. The material is soft and midweight. I will warn you that these pants are pretty much guaranteed to pick up lint. Just be careful what you wear with them. I found the fit to be true to size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
4.0,Very pretty and surprisingly well made. Breast panels a BIT far apart but I'll figure it out.
4.0,"If you want to make that butterfly knot, SIZE UP! The butterfly knot was impossible in the size I ordered, and that wasn't the smallest size I could have chosen based on my measurements."
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered up. Not the best quality but it is very sexy!
4.0,"I ordered this beautiful dress for my mother.  She tried it on and was slightly to small for her.  The size is probably accurate on the company's chart.  She's just use to wearing very stretchy material.  She was able to put the dress on but a little snug in the chest.  So, we did return and reordered the next size up.  She loves the dress material and color.  It's going to be perfect for her to wear as the mother of the bride."
4.0,love this item.
4.0,"The pair of leggings got to me pretty fast. The waist is a loose, which can be either good or bad. It won't be too tight and uncomfortable at times, but it can also become looser after being washed. I'll see after I wash it. The fleece layer, in my opinion, is only good enough for layering."
4.0,"I really really like this duster. I am 5'9&#34; and have a hard time finding garments that are long enough. I ordered the XXL to make sure it was really going to be big enough. It definitely is. (I normally wear about a size 14) I could have sized down, but get extremely paranoid about shoulder sizing since a lot of styles run too tight in the shoulders for me. This fits perfectly in the shoulders. I will say the cut of this product is a tad boxy. I am definitely going to have the waist taken in a bit in order to get a more custom and flattering fit. The underarm area of the sleeve actually had a hole in it as well. I still gave it a 4 because despite the mildly boxy cut and the hole, I really love this garment and will be wearing it a ton this fall. It's very classy and chic."
4.0,"I ordered this dress for family photos. The material is very soft and it looks just as it's pictured. I ordered a medium and am 5'6"" and 160lbs, 34c, pear shaped and it fit well. I did have to pin the bottom because just as many reviewers noted the slit is quite high. I did have a few wardrobe malfunctions at the top, but that's to be expected while holding little ones. I do wish that the interior of the dress was the same as the exterior given its a high-low and you can see the faded pattern behind your legs. Overall though its a great dress. Very comfortable and cute."
4.0,I love the product except for one thing. The strap that hides around the neck has a weirdly placed buckle that leaves a long strap hanging down. I had to tie out around the main strap three times to get it out of the way.  Otherwise it's great.
4.0,LIGHT AND GREAT FOR TRAVELING.
4.0,The fit is pretty form fitting and does a good amount of cleavage . I'm 5'5 it was a bit short for me. Nice dress maybe for someone really thin and short.
4.0,"These earrings are great, perfect for what I wanted.  The only drawback, the post is very small and a little difficult to hold onto."
4.0,They are a little small but comfortable
4.0,"I can't decide how I feel about this bathing suit. The pattern looks a little cheaper in person than it does in the picture. It has a very young, 80s vibe (in my opinion) and is obviously not of the best quality. It's a little on the thin side, but as far as the fit goes I'm very satisfied.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,"Great fit, and feels good... however they were delivered folded so there's a crease in the middle that won't go away."
4.0,"Band is super long, but you can take out links relatively easily. Nice watch otherwise"
4.0,These do the job they are meant to do. They are heavy duty. Only disappointment was the purple was so dark it was almost black. Wished they had been more pruple. Otherwise a great product and i do use them.
4.0,"Ordered based on reviews, is a little big, but very cute and fun for the holidays"
4.0,"I did get this on sale after Christmas for next year, but I don't think full price it was too expensive. The quality seems good. It does fit a little tight in the stomach area. I would still recommend."
4.0,"These necklaces are so very beautiful. The rose color is the reason I bought them and the color is perfect! I would’ve given 5 stars, however, the rose necklace came damaged. The links were flattened in one part. I love it so much I’m wearing it anyway. And with this crisis going on I’m not sending any packages back."
4.0,"I went up a size (XL) and it's a little big. I am going to wear it at night, so it will be ok!"
4.0,It's super cure but just is cut strange like if I was shaped like a square!
4.0,The brooch is very pretty and looks like good quality.  I haven't worn it yet so I am not sure how durable it is.
4.0,Fit well but narrow
4.0,"I tend to sleep in sweats for both warmth and comfort.  I order my sweats intentionally larger than needed because I like the room. This did not disappoint.  If anything, it's maybe larger than expected... which is fine by me.<br /><br />I have a number of other sweatshirts from other manufacturers.  Generally, they're all good and I don't really have much to say about them.  They fit, they last a while, and they do the job.  What I will say about this one is that I find it unusually warm.  If it's not a fairly cold winter evening, it's almost too warm for me.  There have been times I've swapped it out for a t-shirt during the evening and put it back on when I go to bed (since the furnace temp dials back then).<br /><br />Not much else to say.  Easy to wash and dry, durable, and warm.  Everything I expect from it."
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, meant for child's ears probably, but that's not the problem. Problem is the 4 little posts make a sort of &#34;cage&#34; which holds onto the tiny stone disk. I've had issues with them letting the stone fall out and having to needle-nose it back in. Overall, cheap way to add a bit of color to your ears."
4.0,"I love my earrings, they are definitely show stoppers and a conversation pieces but they are huge. I'll be ordering more for my little sister she loves them."
4.0,"Very nice sport skirt,well made,but run to small."
4.0,"Awesome boot! These boots are very nice but they run very small, I wear size 7 1/2 to 8 in most shoes and ordered a 8 1/2, and they were too small, I had to reorder a size 9.  Great boot for the money!!"
4.0,A bitnlong
4.0,Very cute but a bit tight. Fits my little girl better than me
4.0,A little small but its ok it fits material looks a little cheap
4.0,Looks good but it won't last forever u may have to keep buying them if they fall apart.
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. The only problem is if u wear them for any length of time,  they dig into your skin."
4.0,Nice kippah but fit a small child with a small head. They should offer different sizes or make it adjustable
4.0,"Nice fabric, pretty shape.  But despite recommendations, runs big.  I had to send back the first one for a smaller one."
4.0,"Very cute dress, and I like it. However, the dress isn't as fitted as the picture would have you believe. It's more like smocking and a skirt, so there's no real waist to this dress. I just paired it with a short leather jacket and heeled booties to give it more of a silhouette. For reference, I'm 5'2, 140ish pounds, I carry my weight in my hips and butt, but I'm small up top. So, if you are about the same weight but you're blessed up top, this dress will probably be too short or fit strangely."
4.0,"Great product and great customer service, they responded very quickly to any concerns I might have! Thank you very much !!"
4.0,"This thing was almost barely to small to get around my 28"" suitcase.  (the one I purchased was supposed to fit 27""-29"")  I felt like I almost needed 2 people to even zip it at the bottom.  Overall though, It looks super cute and so far done its job.  After one flight, I pick it up and it was already starting to get holes/dirt on it, but that was to be expected.  (TSA people seem to toss luggage around no matter what.)  I am afraid that only after a few more flights, I will need to purchase another one.  However, I am glad I bought it!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but needs more length."
4.0,"I bought these glasses based on others reviews. They weren't lying. Its hard fore to be outside on sunny days, due to sun glints giving me optical migraines. These have let me enjoy the outside again."
4.0,"It's okay in style, but the sizes are problematic. The designer needs to check for the size."
4.0,"This sock's pros: good cushion, nice fit, good elastic. Only con: overall cost for 1 pair is very high in my opinion even for a really good quality sock as it's only 1 pair."
4.0,"Nice jacket. Lots of stretch. I purchased a 2XL. It fit like a medium. I'll be returning it.  Also, fabric was plastic-ish."
4.0,"I love it, i saw other reveiws that said the shorts part is really short and it is. I'm 5'2 so i thought maybe it wouldn't be that bad... but it is...and it touches the ground so if you are shorter twist it up off the floor or wear heels.<br />And if you are bigger chested like me 36DDD, I'd say get some boob tape<br />Get compliments when I wear"
4.0,"Very cute, I'll wear as a chemise and boy shorts, or sleepwear"
4.0,The price is good the quality is ok.
4.0,It fits great. Great price. It works great to play dress up with my daughter with out costing me a fortune. When the time comes that I need more I will definitely purchase again.
4.0,This dress is super soft and comfy! It fits true to size. The only thing I don’t like is the pockets make it puff out a little at the sides. Hoping that i can flatten them down a bit with an iron. Definitely pairing this dress with a chunky red necklace and earrings for the holidays!
4.0,"2Pc casual toddler print skirt: this is adorable it will need a tank top for underneath the shirt, the size says 5-6t but I’d say it’s more 4t-5t."
4.0,The compression on the foot area does not seem to be 30 as advertised.  The toe area is a little large so the compression does not go as near the toe as it should
4.0,"Returned it , to small"
4.0,SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS...VERY GOOD QUALITY THOUGH
4.0,"I thought it would be over one shoulder, but it’s not! The neck is too small and  thats why I just like it not love it at all!"
4.0,This was a very cute jumpsuit  but runs very large size down and if you are on the shorter side you will need to get the pants hemmed
4.0,Nice and loose fit. Love it
4.0,"Beautiful pants...I'm 5'6 170...the large fits great! VERY stretchy. Tight, breathable sexy fit that I was looking for. But, be aware that the fabric is pretty thin...not so good quality..I don't expect them to last too long."
4.0,I love the hat but it was a tad bit too big. It was made for a man's head. I was too tall.
4.0,"I love them. They haven't fallen apart and are quite sturdy for cosplaying. My only complaint is that the upper thigh straps often slip down unless you are willing to cut off circulation to your legs. Other than that though great product. Lots of compliments. You will need to go to YouTube for instructions on how to put it together the first couple times around, however. But that's as expected."
4.0,"I loved this costume except for the gloves being a little too small. They ripped while I was trying to put them on. The halter not having any sort of clasp was also a little inconvenient, but otherwise a fantastic costume"
4.0,Runs large and is much more of an orange but seems like nice quality
4.0,"Wonderful product, fit was as expected and material is light and comfortable"
4.0,"It's very pretty, a little more yellow then what the photo shows however, it went nicely with my costume. It's isn't as heavy as it looks!"
4.0,"These socks are a good fit, above what I anticipated."
4.0,Nice necklace & nice price.
4.0,Only thing the pendent is very small
4.0,Inside slip little short had to wear tights with it
4.0,returned for a smaller size
4.0,The silver thing that puts the key on the key ring keeps disconnecting and my key is coming loose.
4.0,"Nice shoe. For me it runs a little tight, but still is a nice shoe. Very comfortable with thinner socks."
4.0,Nice packaging but gloves too small for my use
4.0,Beautiful! Gave as a gift. It was perfect for the person that received it. She loved it. Wore it immediately. It made me very happy to know it was well appreciated.
4.0,"First of all this really works!  Not really comfortable material, but it works well enough.  Not clear why it is so tight in the belly and so long it reaches past my hips, but it really helps with that pain and cramping in upper back caused by rounding of shoulders and slouching upper back.<br /><br />Size is weird and I haven't worn a medium anything in over 30 years, but a medium fit me.  I don't drink beer and have a good waistline, but can imagine it being a problem if you have a belly.."
4.0,"They look nice and are as comfortable as you can expect from flip flops. I usually buy size 10s in slippers but when I got it, it was pretty snug. After wearing them for awhile they stretched just a little and they're comfortable enough to wear now."
4.0,I love this!  It fits me really well. I normally wear a 36C bra.  I got it to wear with spaghetti strap tank tops.
4.0,"Easy wash and wear, very comfortable, and I get quite a few compliments."
4.0,Lo recomiendo me gusto
4.0,love the way it feels. make sure you get an extra size
4.0,Because its a litle boring
4.0,love these. have gotten so many compliments. I tried on the black pair and instantly got a run in them. :( be extremely careful with.
4.0,I love this scarf so much that I purchased several more for holiday gifts. Reasonably priceD for such a beautiful and well made wrap with gorgeous colors!
4.0,"Bought two of these for my wife and daughter, they are extremely happy with the comfort and feel. May have to get two more pairs."
4.0,Very Nice but the thumbholes could be made a little different and does hurt if pulled to hard. Otherwise it works
4.0,looked great with my daughters flower girl dress it stayed in place for the day without much need of  replacing.
4.0,Very soft.  Fits tighter around the instep for support but still very comfortable.  It takes longer to dry in the dryer than any of my other socks so I think this means the fabric absorbs moisture/perspiration.  I have not worn them while hiking.
4.0,"These earings were just as pictured but gold, the gold started to flake. Its not noticeable though, another thing is they're quite heavy so they hang toward a bit, worth the price though!"
4.0,"It appears to be nice,but could not figure out how to open chain strap to attach it to purse. No instructions or anything. I tried pushing,pinching,pulling,all different ways to open,and now have to ask friends how to do it. Very annoying,but hopefully will like it after I figure it out."
4.0,Very nice!! Good quality for a low price!
4.0,Love the lightbar. Do not like the shape
4.0,Got for sister and law and she likes alot. Was a good price during the holiday season and are holding up very well
4.0,Really pretty but it really didn't flatter my figure. It needed to be a little smaller around the middle.<br />Very flowy but I know what looks good on me.
4.0,"I wasn't really expecting to have to attach the quick release pins to the watch band, which was kind of a pain, but they sent a tool to remove the extra links (band is still a bit big on me but I have tiny wrists) and it fits my 2nd gen women's moto 360."
4.0,The shoe is light fits well but does not flex enough for table tennis
4.0,"Everything looks vivid when I was wearing it.  Sadly, the frame easily broke by accident.  I might buy it again though."
4.0,"8-19-17 This is a really pretty bracelet. It has a nice weight to it. It looks and feels expensive. My only complaint is that it has a copper base, so the silver starts to wear off. I thought it was stainless steel when I purchased it. It was not. I had purchased a previous bracelet from the same company and have had not problems. I is stainless steel. After voicing my complaint, the company contacted me to see if I wanted it replaced. They were very kind and wanted to do what they could to satisfy their customer. Their customer service is awesome."
4.0,Not to shabby for the price
4.0,They're great for the price but they do fade in color after wearing for a while.
4.0,"Good looking jacket, but the sizing is way off! The small will fit a petite 10 year old."
4.0,I like it. but polyester underlay is kind of constricting. but beautiful
4.0,Grandson gift for Christmas
4.0,"This is a must have for when you don't want to carry a big purse.  It displays your license in an easy to read, clear insert at the front.  The only problem is that the clear protector becomes a bit brittle after a few years and if you need to take the license out for any reason, it will slowly tear the clear protector.  that is why I buy 3 at a time so it will last me for 5 years."
4.0,good but could improve.
4.0,Didn’t take a photo because I was not happy with how it looked on me personally! Still a beautiful dress!
4.0,"Got the silver.  They don't stay on all that well (they absolutely need a rubber stopper), but they're really cute.  Loved wearing them, but I don't do it often- I mean, they're cheap.  They're not going to last and stay pretty, especially if they get wet."
4.0,Runs a little small - order at least 1 size larger than you normally would.  Nice quality.
4.0,Like the color and look. They do not fog with a procedural mask on all day which is awesome. My only complaint is discomfort over the bridge of my nose. It leaves a big indent. Also a bit tight behind the ears but I can deal with those things.
4.0,Very pretty necklace just hope it lasts a long time
4.0,Kinda feel like i could have made this myself...
4.0,Ordered for a gift. Delivered in great time. Appears just as advertised.
4.0,"Sexy and flattering silk string panties.  Bought size large(32-35 according to size chart.) Wife wears size 7 panty and they fit ok, but they are a little loose on her.  They will accommodate at least 1 or 2 size larger.  She looks very sexy in them."
4.0,"I like them and had these before, so I am used to the orange tint.  But I bought them too small and wished I had seen the pair that was slightly wider"
4.0,these are cute and i would've given a 5 star but a couple of them were pretty bent up! If they weren't such a great price I would've given a 3 star but 4 is fair.
4.0,The only thing that throws me off is the scales go the wrong way
4.0,looks like the pic but seems to run small. It also took over a month to get it.
4.0,"Love the style of this dress. It's a little heavy, but with the weather like it is it works."
4.0,"This fit a 5 month old just right, so I would not get it for an ACTUAL 9-12 month old in this size.  It was nice and comfortable, and looked good, but the vest part curled up somewhat after one washing, so a touch up with a light iron would be a good idea."
4.0,A little thin but otherwise good
4.0,"Invicta might make some awful watches, but these prodiver series are quite affordable and decent automatic watches to get started or to wear as a beater."
4.0,Great watch for the price. I'll give a 5 star rating if it works as expected. Great look in red.
4.0,"The color is  nice green not too dark, however I thought it will be  larger size. Actual size should be described on item."
4.0,very good vision. I'd buy again and think I will
4.0,"I bought these pants for a wedding.  I never wear pants to any event, but I wanted a change. These are a little cheaply made, but very nice and very comfy. I received many compliments. One thing tho...they were supposed to be 'goucho' style...but if you are under 5' 4""...they won't be !  They went right the ground, but I was able to wear heels, so it worked."
4.0,I ordered mine for a wedding that I'm in soon.<br /> I received them today and they are really cute but they are REALLY small. I always wear a 9 but could barely get them on my feet. I am returning them and had to order the next size up! Luckily they shipped pretty fast.
4.0,"I bought this watch to replace my old Casio watch whose wristband had broken.  This new watch is basically fine, but the wristband on this one has different tightness settings (the notches in the wristband) than my old one, and it doesn't fit as well on my wrist as my old one.  It's a minor annoyance.  The other problem is that on the occasion where you would actually want to use the watch's alarm feature, that alarm only goes off for a couple seconds, so it probably won't actually wake you up.  Otherwise, I like this simple watch.  I am very loyal to the Casio brand for wristwatches.  I don't want to own a fancy or visually flashy watch."
4.0,"These worked for the sun over my prescription glasses.  I was pretty pleased.  However, I did feel that that were a little flimsy, so that’s why I took away a star."
4.0,These I got for my child. He liked them. Which I gotta say was awesome. Drawstring is thick and less likely to knot. Very comfortable and super fast shipping.
4.0,"Really cute! It’s a cheap top so it’s cheap material but I think it holds up well, I recommend it"
4.0,"Huge fan of aviators and these are nice!<br /><br />Pro: Nice size. I have kind of a melon head (stop laughing) so glasses that are too small emphasize that. These are awesome! Nice color - vibrant and eye catching, yet doesn't make everything look like weird colors.<br /><br />Con: Quality is MEH - could break kind of easy and they scratch relatively easy, but you're also paying for what you get. I break sunglasses too easily to buy expensive ones!<br /><br />Verdict: Recommend!"
4.0,"The shirt is very cute and nice and soft but it was quite large not tailored as it looks in the picture also it comes with the big clumsies differ on the back that I removed, I added a seam instead  in order to cinch it up a bit, still love it."
4.0,"Nice looking shirt, fits as expected. Could be a little heavier material."
4.0,not a good pocket for my cell phone without it getting in the way of the snap
4.0,"I wear large and although I ordered an extra large, it's still a tight fit for me. I like the quality though.  Better than some of the cardigans I bought at Macy's"
4.0,I like it. Material is not as comfortable as I had expected but It's cute and I like it
4.0,It was well received as a gift
4.0,It’s cute. But runs small. My 7 year old is wearing a size 10 in these jammies.
4.0,The body fits wide and loose.<br />The arms are 3/4 length and have rouching. However they are very loose.<br />The knit is pretty and feels expensive
4.0,This is a nice solid set only problem one of the chain is too short to fit around a male neck the one with the initial is longer I recommend you purchase for a female our separate them and one for a female and the other part fir a male item look exactly like the picture
4.0,These are so adorable on my kids. Company contacted me a couple of days after my order and said they were out of the design my kid wanted. They asked us to choose a different design or get a refund. We chose a different design. They sent in the wrong size but quickly sent out the correct size after I contacted them. I will buy again. These have held up through many washes and haven’t stretched out the way other chain store brands have.
4.0,I had to pick a larger size just so it could fit me in a way
4.0,"I've looked at this mask in my Amazon saved list for nearly 2 years and dithered about whether or not I should purchase it for my brother (no, he doesn't have a weird squirrel fetish or anything). I got it for him as a holiday gift. The mask is exactly as shown and described. I'm told it's VERY warm with it on. I know this was supposed to be a gift FOR my brother, but I received the best gift, which keeps on giving - seeing my brother's horrified (but trying not to be obvious that he's horrified) face when he received it...and letting him continue to think that I'd be hurt if he let on that he hates it. I ask him about it periodically just to see how he reacts. Maybe someday I'll fess up that it was a joke...or not."
4.0,"So I ordered these earrings on 6/8/21, and  received them on 6/12/21 (4days later). I was skeptical due to no reviews but that didn't stop me from buying, considering I liked what I saw. They are lightweight, true to color, adorable and they didn't arrive bent. However, my reason for 4⭐'s was because one wasn't consistent with the other. But, that was a small fix. Would I purchase again? Yes!"
4.0,I ordered this sleeveless Short Fitness shirt for my daughter to where underneath other shirts.  Regular camisole shirts are too long for her and she doesn't like to tuck them in. She is small and a 32A so I ordered a small size. The shirt is perfect length and fits great just a tad big in the chest. The design of the shirt is wider in the chest. It's still super cute and will work for sure! Plus she's still growing! Lol
4.0,"6'1"", 135lbs, 35 bust, 26 waist, 35 hips, 32 inseam(&lt;Measurement in INCHES).<br /><br />Dress was ok but I got the Grey and Green and instantly looked like I was a Die Hard Packers Fan vibe. Nice material and length for Tall girls, but not my colors haha. Fit as expected"
4.0,Very cute top.  Long hem line! Little crisscross on the chest area.  Beautiful purple color.  Only complaint is it rubs a tad small.  I should've ordered up.  Definitely worth it.  Machine wash cold like colors...I line dried since it runs small
4.0,It fits very well. I’m 5’4” I weigh 155<br />My bust is 36DD and it’s very hard for me to find dresses that fit.<br />I like this dress bc it’s a little stretchy and it’s light for the summer.
4.0,Its is light weight and no disruption in breathing and fabric is good to feel . 👍✅
4.0,"I love the socks that look like shoes, and these are definitely cute ones. They also have grips on the bottom which is really good for little ones learning to walk. Either my daughter has very large feet though, or these run a little on the smallish side, they are labeled 1-3 years and she has fit into them since 9 months. At least I know we will get a lot of use out of them. :)"
4.0,Product is as it appears.. velvet generic cloak.
4.0,"I love the look of this cap, it fits a little snug. Not a problem for me as I know a seamstress who can fix that. I have many caps all the size 7 3/4 they all fit great, I don’t know if my hat alone was an anomaly but..if you order one one for yourself, I suggest one size too large. Might be perfect then."
4.0,"Good mask….somewhat comfortable, didn’t really like the elastic pull things."
4.0,I love the necklace it’s very cute however it came with 2 different chains so you could wear it as a necklace and I had on the black one and it broke off my neck the rose gold chain that came with it was good tho so I still recommend
4.0,I really liked this! It fit true to size! I am 5'4 118lbs and the small fit great! But my husband wasn't a fan of the ruffles...so I had to return it.
4.0,Fit and finish is nice.  Keeps his head warm too.
4.0,"Men's nurse mate socks fit comfortably I'm 5 10"" 190lbs & they are not too tight behind or near the knee area."
4.0,My best friend loves Elvis (and so do I) so she was very happy with it!
4.0,Feels like a Halloween costume. Which I guess is okay because I bought it for a Beatleguise costume.
4.0,These are so comfy! Just a bit long. I’m 5’0 and it goes from over my belly button down to my ankles
4.0,"The material is actually a pretty nice cotton like material. The floral print is nice and the length is pretty good on me. The quality isn’t the greatest, there is no tag which gives it a bit of a “cheap” look. Also it is pretty low cut, I will have to pin it a bit."
4.0,This is a very classy wrap shirt.  It can be worn to work or casually. The material is soft and stretchy.  I bought the purple and black. One Medium and one Large and they fit the same way... Not much of a difference except the Large was a few inches longer than the medium.
4.0,The candy buttons were not sewn but instead glued and my child yanked one off within moments.
4.0,"I bought this top in several different colors; I love the fit, the length, the shape...the only reason I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5, is the material - a little too much of that polyester feel.  Otherwise, I recommend them when you want something a little more polished looking than a t-shirt."
4.0,I purchased the wallett for my grandsons as a stocking stuffer. The wallet is of good quality and construction. Thanks
4.0,"These are just fun watches.  The quality sucks..... we bought them at Christmas and all of them are falling apart 3 weeks later.  But for the price, they were easily worth a couple bucks each in entertainment.  I think the watches will last a few more weeks and then we'll break out the extra ones and distribute to the kids.  I would have given it 5 stars if they would just last a couple of months..... Is that too much to ask for a perfect rating?"
4.0,"My only negative feedback is that the padding is not removable, unless you cut into the fabric. Otherwise, this suit is a dream. So comfortable!"
4.0,"I purchased these earrings for myself and overall I am satisfied with them. They arrived in a very timely manner in good condition. They are slightly bigger than nickle-size in diameter, which is a bit smaller then the picture conveys, but I believe that they're actually nicer for this fact. They are also a bit more detailed then the picture shows--very unique.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that on one earring, the wire is a tiny bit bent--slightly annoying, but not really noticeable when you're wearing them. Very much recommended for the price."
4.0,Really really nice watch! It looks super sleek and is easy to read. The only thing is the band material makes it really easy to pick up dust. Overall satisfied!
4.0,It was thicker than I expected at this price!  Very cute but I can't zip up because I wear size C in bras! Not returning!
4.0,They stay on. They are not slippery. Cute. Well sewn. They look like the photo.
4.0,It’s a pretty ring. I like the moonstone. The metal looks like fake silver and I’m not crazy about the adjustable thing. It makes it feel cheap.
4.0,Nice bag...
4.0,"My daughter is consistently a size small and this was to big, should have ordered an xs."
4.0,They are a little higher than expected but work well
4.0,This organized my purse wonderfully! I would have rated it 5 stars if it didn’t add so much more weight to my purse.
4.0,"This dress is actually flattering, I am 5’2 about 156lbs and 8 months pregnant. It does define the waist and flows at the bottom. I really like that it has pockets. I ordered the L but I think I should’ve  ordered the medium so it defined my waist a bit more (but the L fits comfortable at the top). So I might just keep it."
4.0,perfect fit but the hem was not all the way done
4.0,"Quedan un poco grandes pero son de un excelente material, fácil de instalation y buen servicing al cliente."
4.0,Size up one size so it's not too tight in the crotch. I'm only 5'4 and it was tight on me. Wrinkles very easily. I did get compliments.
4.0,"This face mask helped keep the wind off my face so that part was all good, after washing it the first time the treading came apart on the neck part which is a bummer."
4.0,Brought for my daughter...she really likes them. The fit is good and very comfortable.
4.0,Actually my favourite shirt I own now! I love the design and it's incredibly comfortable! I did order a slightly larger size but it fits perfect (for my taste) so it's fine anyway
4.0,"It is stretchy, so if you are worried don't be. XL fits as you would expect, and is flattering. The material is a little see-through in the lighter areas for this color. I am satisfied. BEST PART It has POCKETS. Not huge or really big pockets, but pockets."
4.0,"I am 5’4” and 125 lbs.  I ordered a size large. Bottom portion fits nice, but loose gap near armpits...not sure whether to stick with it or size down. Can’t afford for it to get tighter on butt. CAME VERY WRINKLED."
4.0,boot fillers...
4.0,"The Kalon yoga pants were a nice fabric, and a good look, the fit was about right, I'm sure I will get good use out of them."
4.0,Seemed really nice. I just didn't like the color of gold for the belt buckles.  I should have ordered silver colored ones.
4.0,"I have the same bag but in taupe. I love this black one however for some reason they only put in one zippered pocket on the inside where as the taupe one has two zippered pockets. It's not big enough for a regular sized wallet so you probably need to use the credit card slots in one of the outside pockets. Overall, I like the size and fabric."
4.0,Made for taller  children  but my Grand son  is short
4.0,I ordered my usual size of large and the sweater fit pretty snug even with a tank top. No too uncomfortable but would have been better with an x-lg for some room.
4.0,"If you are looking for cheap, outlandish glasses, these are the ones."
4.0,"Pleasant blouse, excellent for different events."
4.0,"A very cute shirt.  I ordered a large and am a size 12.  Fit nicely, but a bit snug at the hips.  Material is lightweight.  Looks adorable with jeans or leggings."
4.0,"Bought this tray to take on a plane trip,  it was too big and heavy to carry through the airport, so it has been put to use in the car."
4.0,"... but I ordered the XLarge and washed it and it shrank a little too much.  I haven't washed the XXLarge yet, but I'm guessing that it will shrink but still fit."
4.0,All my expectations were meet. I would by this item again. Fit better than expected.
4.0,The pajamas are cute but seem a bit tight. I purchased a 2T for a 2 year old but if I could do it again I would purchase one size higher so there is some wiggle room.
4.0,Fits well. Machine washed a few times and still good - no stretching or pilling and the colors are still good
4.0,This is a very nice top...good quality and fit.
4.0,String breaks quick at joining.
4.0,"Great product! The size was perfect and it looks just like the pictures. Material is typical of leotards, great quality for the price."
4.0,I love these. They are molded which I love and now I do not have to worry about having my beauty products crushed and ruined. The are really roomy and roll smoothly. After getting these at a discount to try I used them on an unexpected trip to take care of an ailing family member. I loved the ease of use and of navigating around the airport. No more carrying the heavy bag on my shoulder.
4.0,"Beautiful pattern, a little thick of fabric, but comfy."
4.0,I think this is a great apron design. It doesn’t move around or require adjusting. I forgot I was wearing it. My deduction was because I had to redo part of the hem that wasn’t turned under. Small issue. I would recommend it. This one is small and fits me easily (sz10).
4.0,I bought these for my boyfriend and I. They came as pictured. No problems.
4.0,This was the second set I purchased. Same style different color. The sizing and fit is completely different. The stitching could've been a lot better. The hem & seem were raveled before I wore them. I had to restitch with  more appropriate color thread.
4.0,"Awesome necklace, perfect length, looks great!"
4.0,Price and delivered to my door made this an excellent choice.
4.0,Nice quality underwear. Elastic is strong and material is very soft. A little overpriced but seems they will last a long time. Sizing is good.
4.0,"This dress is absolutely adorable, but its not for the tall ladies unless you dont mind the possibility of your lady bits showing when you bend over or move the wrong way.  Its super comfy and so cute, but just too short if you are tall.  For reference i am 5'10.  Id say it would be perfect for anyone 5'8 and under length wise."
4.0,"I ordered the wrong size, but overall it was a quality skirt for a good price."
4.0,"Based on reviews, it fit perfectly. Very nice quality. Took suggestion of the petticoat."
4.0,"Orders these I love the color, style and quality but turns out they were way too big  I'm a little thick for 5'2 and cant exchange because theres no smaller sizes in stock now😞"
4.0,Cute but the material is a bit thin and cheap.
4.0,The h is a little to small but other then that its coo mine  came with no stamp but i still like it.
4.0,"Mine did not come as pictured. Was expecting it to teach my knees, but really only came past my thighs.  Although, this may be due to me being plus size and maybe the measurements didn't accommodate for that.  I did like the color,  style, and feel of the shirt."
4.0,The material is super soft. And it is so comfortable. I can't wait to wear it on my cruise.
4.0,"One of the pegs broke when I was trying to figure out how to fasten it to my hair. The look and overall quality is pretty good. I colored the gems with nail polish. Some of the smaller gems fell off, but were easily fixed with clear nail polish."
4.0,Haven't been able to use it yet; it is a cold-weather item.  This is a simple fleece scarf  bought because it is styled with pockets at the ends.  It should function as designed.
4.0,I like this ring very much.  It fits my finger well - doesn't slide around with the blossoms ending up inside my hand.  Very pretty.
4.0,They are super comfy but just a little see through
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because I really like it a lot and the quality is very good but......it is way to small in the chest area.  I usually wear a 1x to 2x so I ordered a 4x my bra size is 38 DD and this made my breast look flat.  It fit great everywhere else.  I was so disappointed because it is so adorable.
4.0,"The picture makes the pattern look better than what you get, but it's comfortable, cool, and fits just right. The cut of the skirt is slimming."
4.0,"The gloves are comfortable, work well and the dexterity and grip are an improvement over typical work gloves. That said they are not as durable as decent work gloves and the rubber coating will wear off quickly, depending on your activity. I suggest going up a size from your usual as the large were short and tight compared to the same sort of glove from other brands. This type of glove is now my go-to for most tasks."
4.0,The fabric was soft and not too flimsy
4.0,I wore my boots for the second time last night and the toe part on the left boot came apart.  It was so embarrassing.  I was at the bar walking and almost tripped over it.  Had to go put superglue in between the soul of the boot and the top part.  Otherwise the fit is perfect and I love the way they look on.  Very sexy and comfortable at the same time.
4.0,Love this.  Fits nicely and soft.  Received it fast.
4.0,Love it . Fits great
4.0,This is a cute little earring.  My only draw back is that my hair keeps getting caught in the little opening where the two ends meet.
4.0,I really love these blue crystal earrings. the only thing that could make them better is a stronger latch. I have to make sure they are not going to fall out. I don't want to lose them.
4.0,"Cute shirt. The sleeves were a little shorter than they looked in the picture, but I like it anyway."
4.0,"The glasses fit really well and they look great.  The only problem I have with them is that they are really dark when you look through them, only good for really bright sunshine."
4.0,"Shoes are dandy for a house slipper, and what I was looking for.  However, my normal shoe size is a 10, sometimes 10-1/2 depending on brand, but the XL, supposedly size 10-11, would never fit anyone with a size 11 foot.  This fits me, but it's a close call.  Definitely a get-what-you-pay-for type deal, and any footwear that allegedly fits two sizes is always a crapshoot.  These are satisfactory, but if in doubt, definitely feel safe ordering a larger size!"
4.0,The calf cuffs aren't tight enough
4.0,Cute but small for women I am petite under 5 feet so it worked for me but maybe too small for average ++ women
4.0,Super soft and well-made hat. The pom pom at the top has flecks of gold. I will most likely replace it with a white Pom-Pom.
4.0,"My husband is pretty picky when it comes to finding a new money clip that has a strong magnet. After reading reviews on many other wallets similar I choose this one. The price was right. He also has it filled with about 7 diff. Cards/licenses. It got really tight when I converted everything over 2 days ago, but being he keeps it in his front pocket it has loosened up some making it easier to pull the cards out. He also carries a lot of cash on him, so far the magnet has kept the bills snuggles up. (20 bills most the time). I'm assuming over time it will get stronger connection as the leather breaks in and wears, like his old one did. It's like a new pair of sneakers, they need to get broke in some."
4.0,"I like that the waist fits.  It's not too tight.  Tha material is nice and light for the summer.  The length is mid-calf, which I like.  The top ruffle seems to be inside-out and upside-down.  I dont know if that was intentional or not.  It's barely noticeable, but that's why I didn't give this product five stars."
4.0,"These briefs suited my husband, because the elastic waistband is covered and they fit as expected.  He says they're comfortable, and the initial wash didn't fade the color."
4.0,"I like these sandals, I wore them two days so far and comfort is about as you would expect for a thin flat sandal. However, walking any considerable distance in these causes my foot to slip backwards on the sandal because the elastic across the toes is much stiffer than the other elastic and therefore the path of least resistance is backward. The elastic band across the toe is also less comfortable than expected and presses my toes together, but my feet are wider than normal, so again this was expected. Overall 4/5"
4.0,Not as sturdy of a sole as previous timberland shoes i've worn. But very stylish and comfortable
4.0,It OK.
4.0,"I bought size L (US4-6) but I would have been better at M. I still look good, and I loved the fabric, design, color and the swimsuit ... it is beautiful and comfortable."
4.0,"Cute, nice color, fits well, exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,I love the love pumice so much.<br />Loved my dress too but too small that's how p had to order another one .l hope it will fit.
4.0,"I received size medium.  The upper part of the sock is quite snug and the foot part is a little bit loose. I wear women's shoe size ranging from 7.5 to 8.5 depending on brand, style, and whether or not I wear socks. I do like the looks and the fabric of these socks, they're very nice. I would not call them thin but I would not call them cushioned. I have another pair of socks designated as military boot socks and they are very cushioned. These new socks aren't like that."
4.0,I like them. You just have to pay attention to which holes the two side fingers go in because it can be uncomfortavle and they can tear. Also people with long nails this might be a little complicated. Over all i like them. It looks like the nets are ripping a little because there are several loose string hanging but it worth the price.
4.0,"The belt was very nice, but I ordered a 42 and it was 48 not counting the buckle."
4.0,"Shirt fits very well for the medium ordered. Material is very, very thin. GOOD, for a summer golf shirt in south Texas. Background color in photo appears white. Upon delivery it is light gray.  For the price [close out] it is a great shirt & fits a medium exactly!  I am very pleased over all! Where else can you score a golf shirt in a print you like, delivered for $10. Way to go Amazon!!!!!"
4.0,"As always, doing business with Amazon is just great.  I purchased this item from Huangqian and decided that i didn't want it.  They in turn told me to keep this item free of charge because returning it would be expensive.  This decision was unexpected and a surprise.  The outcome was much appreciated.............thank you again, Huangqian, a great way to do business....Lenore"
4.0,"The dress is cute.  Fabric is doable. Issue, my 1st dress was perfect.  The 2nd, 3rd and 4th dress the neckline came in HUGE! I would have to wear a cami or tank top otherwise if I were to bend over, all would show.  Why is the dress pattern different than the 1st?  Dissapointed."
4.0,My son is 11 months and crawls so much he was starting to get dry red knees. They work great when they stay up but by always curl up and slide down and have to keep readjusting them.
4.0,"I get compliments on this dress whenever I wear it. It is nice and stretchy. The included belt is cute and can be worn with other outfits. The gathered v neck of the top is just deep enough to show off cleavage, but not deep enough to show your bra. Speaking of bras, the material of the top (specifically the white stripes) is thin and can show your bra if it is not light-colored. That small problem is the only reason I gave it four stars."
4.0,I really like/love NYDJ.  They fit great on mature figures.  My only complaint is the fit isn’t the same as previous pants.  A little wider in the leg.
4.0,"Although these socks do not perform equally to 100% wool, they are reasonably warm. I like the fit, and they are not too tight on your leg and they stay in place comfortably. I recommend these socks."
4.0,"Adorable. However, pay attention to sizing!"
4.0,"Gift for coworker, she loves them<br />Clasp gives extra security & peace of mind"
4.0,I'm 5'1 and a bit curvy so large fit me pretty well. It was long in the leg but I just tucked them into my shoes. It was kind of see through and had some weird wrinkling on the lower part. I bought a tutu and I felt much more comfortable.  I got a lot of compliments! Paired it with some gold sneakers for comfort!
4.0,"The material is not very breathable. Not great for spin, but supper cute for athlesure wear."
4.0,"Up to now, everything is ok but I do not know if the belt will be in good condition afer some years. I use the blt perhaps once in a month and kept in a convenient  location but if I see any abnormal deterioration, I let you know. Chinese product quality have increased rapidly soo wit and see...."
4.0,the Scrap is Cool and very comfortable.
4.0,"Excelente, pero aunque es grande la caja y el tamaño de las almohadillas no tanto, y los relojes de tamaño considerable queda apretados abajo.<br />La calidad parece muy buena"
4.0,My 4 year old (very tall and slim for his age) loves these briefs. He specifically asks for them. So they serve their purpose.
4.0,"5'2, 112 lbs, D cup. Ordered a Small.<br />I first ordered one in light blue and one in red. They both were just a little big so I washed them (cold water) and put them in the dryer. It shrunk just a bit, and I like the fit so I ordered this light pink one and wash/dryer as well. But now I hang them to dry. Material doesn't wrinkle easily and lays nicely.  It's a conservative top with a little sex appeal when worn with skinny jeans or a pencil skirt."
4.0,"Not as big as I expected. Nice shade blue and built material. I even got a small extra gift, a coin purse."
4.0,I love this dress. It is light and perfect for casual wear. Perfect purchase for the price!
4.0,I love these sun block sleeves. It really keeps my arms from tanning darker than my upper arms. This is my second time ordering and I do suggest the sleeves when people ask.
4.0,"Got the olive and muave flower one. It doesn't seem as pictured but I think it's because I ordered a bit big. I went up 2 sizes from American L to asian xxl. So hard to decipher which size to get with orfering online. It doesn't look bad but i want it tighter. I'm just going to keep them and sew it smaller. It falls about 3&#34; below my knees. I'm 5'3&#34;. Other than that, i think it's not worth no more than $10. If the price goes down, i might buy more in the future."
4.0,"Does shrink in dryer! Careful...it is alot of material so if I orderd a med and shrunk it , it may have been perfect...I got a small and can still wear it but w shorts under it...I'm 5'5 120lbs"
4.0,Very comfortable and nice looking. They don't wrinkle or stretch out. I would love to see a 32 inch inseam available. These are flattering pants and I really like the inside drawstring.
4.0,"Well made, beautiful colors just snug for size 9"
4.0,A little cheaply made but hopefully they will last awhile
4.0,The large fit a little snug and the extra large fit huge around the arms. A little disappointed but otherwise the quality of the fabric and print were great. Love me some Pete.
4.0,This was a really cozy set; not too tight but still form fitting. I actually rolled the shorts up because they are pretty long but it’s nice to have that option. It’s a ribbed material which is flattering. Recommend!
4.0,Very stretchy material.  Comfortable.  I love the way they look and feel
4.0,No grip when wet.  When using them in dry environments they work very well.
4.0,"I love them!! It’s perfect, the only problem is the clasp got disconnected once but it was very easy to fix, definitely recommend getting it!!"
4.0,"I got a 2X and although it is a little snug in the shoulders, it fits nicely. The rippling front is visually slimming and it is light and comfortable. If you want it to hang looser, SIZE UP!  Jacket is unlined, stretchy, matt fabric, sewing is well done with no loose edges or untrimmed strings. Good quality for the price."
4.0,It's a cute necklace. I've seen similar going for much more. It will be a nice touch of green on St Patrick's day.
4.0,I used it as a Halloween costume and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"very very good quality for the price. even though the bra did not fit me, It is really a nice bra. I normally wear a 30A but its in Asian size. So be careful of your sizing, Other than that I would recommend this"
4.0,If there weren't small spaces in between the buttons this item would be perfect. This bodysuit is super cute. I wear with thigh high socks whenever I'm Netflix and chilling with my boo. Super cute and causal but because of the gaps in the buttons it cannot be worn as a top. Makes for adorable pajamas.
4.0,"Decent dress. Not too thin, not to thick."
4.0,Love the item. Shipping was terrible.
4.0,Love it! 5 7 and 125 pounds and medium fit perfectly
4.0,"Seller repeatedly implores you to read the listing for details, but the details are scant and the referred to measuring guide is absent.<br /><br />Here's the deal:<br />Quality - YES. They are clear, suitably hardened against scratching and they do magnify.<br />Size - BIG. A bit larger than I anticipated despite measuring something similar on another watch<br />Price - VALUE. Based on my searches this is a great price for 6. Never know when you will need more.<br />Magnification - OVERKILL. The 2.5x is a bit much. I applied it to watch that didn't have a cyclops, but did have the tiniest date window you could imagine. The end result is a bit overblown.<br /><br />Seller delivered exactly what they promised. I took a star off because they really should supply a sizing chart if they want you to check it so badly and PICTURES of BEFORE & AFTER would really and truly help."
4.0,Great look for the cost. Light color soils easy and not easy to clean as it feels like suade.
4.0,Yes very nice. Just a little big around my ankle but it works.
4.0,Cheap and beautiful
4.0,"Hard to beat the price.  However, this watch is very small.  Seems like mostly for kids and not for folks who need larger display."
4.0,I had to try this on right away because I plan to wear it to a baby shower this weekend!  It fit perfectly and comfortably. It’s shorter than I normally wear my shirts but the cut makes it look great.  The front wrap doesn’t show too much and the Ruffle hem is in the perfect spot to hide any flaws. The material is soft and can be dressed up or worn with jeans for a more casual look.
4.0,"This book cover fit my Joyce Meyer Bible perfectly! Love the inside pocket, it holds my highlighters in place. The only bad thing I have to say is that I should have payed more attention to the item description. In the picture the book cover looks grey, but the one I received is black."
4.0,Attractive key holder- like that it comes with other rings. Strange that it says the gray color  is for women.
4.0,Paper is too shiny that most pens just bleed on top of it. Otherwise works as advertised and a bright color to spot on the luggage belt at the airport
4.0,"Just received it the day before, then I put it in washing machine. It came out ok. Beautiful."
4.0,Love this jacket. I got it in red  and it's perfect for the holidays. Cozy and cute. Tons of compliments
4.0,Practically 2 sizes in one. When the strap is down it hold her foot in well and tight but I notice more room behind her foot. This is great when it starts getting small she can turn the strap to the top and wear for another few months. So in my opinion good deal for the $.
4.0,"Price is right, looked cute and I'm happy"
4.0,Morganite is very pink but they are beautiful and perfect size
4.0,"I got this to wear with a navy dress for my friends wedding this summer, it's just what I needed. And it makes me look super skinny too!"
4.0,Do you stress makes you look slimmer and gives a beautiful hour glass shape !
4.0,Great swim suit just not meant for oversized bust
4.0,The fit is good but the material is thinner than expected.
4.0,Went through airport screening with no problem.
4.0,Ordered up one size and it's still a bit tight but I'm a bigger sort of girl. Graphic is rad! I get compliments whenever I wear it. Material is thin but I wear a tank top under it.
4.0,"Very nice rosary, compact and sturdy-looking. It seems it will last me a long time. The beads are the perfect size, although the rosary itself is smaller than conventional ones (but it has all the beads of conventional rosaries). The cross in my rosary did not have an imprint as advertised (neither does the site image for that matter) so I'm knocking off one star for that. I certainly won't be returning it for that reason alone, but I was a little disappointed. Other than that, I love this little rosary!"
4.0,It was bigger than expected but overall I am happy with this dress!
4.0,"I’m just gonna be honest in that I would not have bought these at the full price of $99 - I ordered them, because I get them at a discount for being a reviewer, otherwise I would not have purchased them myself. That being said, they are pretty earrings - very sparkly and clear plus they come in a nice box. I just don’t understand why these are so expensive, they are not real emeralds and comparable earrings are much less. Even from the same maker (Cate & Chloe) their earrings aren’t usually so expensive. I don’t know what’s up with it, but maybe the price will go down eventually."
4.0,"Love the bag! Looks just like pictured. The crossbody strap is easily adjustable and the fabric is a softened leather that's comfortable and not stiff. It's a &#34;slouch&#34; bag, not rigid at all and doesn't stand flat on the floor. But lightweight fabric makes it feel not so bulky given its size. I would definitely buy again."
4.0,"Look good, c arrived fast, see how they hold up to a 5 yrs old."
4.0,Beautiful good quality dress and great value for the price. I added a petticoat for extra pouf but the dress already has a little poufy layer within the skirt.
4.0,Love the length but as with other reviews short in the waist- or would have given it 5 stars!
4.0,I like the necklace
4.0,Super cute! Love the fit and they're great quality!!!
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress, very well made, quality fabric and lined. The color silver was lovely and elegant. However, it fit several sizes too big. I am a size 4, which I ordered, but it fit like a 10 or 12. I really wished it had fit as I loved it.  I even wonder if it had been mislabeled as size 4 rather than 10 or 12 because it was huge on me as the bust hung down near my waist and I would have had take a hem up about 12 or more inches. So sad, I had to return it."
4.0,I listened to what people had to say about the sizes and went to the next size up and they fit great.  Great show so far.
4.0,"This is pretty and nicely made but runs really big, so I had to return it."
4.0,I got this for a summer dress. It fits as expected. I would buy more from this seller.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! The buttons on the sleeves were poorly sewn on, also the red bleeds a lot. Make sure to wash the first wash by itself in cold water, it will bleed a lot, I can't stress that enough.<br /><br />If you're short you will need to wear heels, also if you're a big boobied person or have a large ribcage you may need to go up a size, I'm a 36C and could not zip this up with a bra on, and it took extra tugging to get it past the waist material.<br /><br />4/5 for the flaws, otherwise a great price for a beautiful dress."
4.0,"This item is amazing super strong and heavy for its size. The colors are bright and I don’t think they will ever fade. These are 2 of my favorite brands so it was a must have, I use it for my dirt bike key. The only thing I don’t like about it is on the reverse side there’s a round piece held in by a magnet which I said to myself i hope this piece doesn’t fall out and it did and it’s lost so I recommend if you want to keep that round part put a tiny piece of double sided tape in there to reduce the chance of it getting lost. Over all this is an amazing piece."
4.0,"To use it for a back braid, you might need a helper. I can only do side braids on my own. It keeps them in place."
4.0,Wonderful colors and very vibrant. The Black studs' crystals have started falling out but the other colors' crystals are still in tact.<br />The size of the studs will not be larger than your ear lobe. They fit just within your lobe. Think of them as the size of a pencil eraser.
4.0,"Great results, decent price, but it was a bit bigger than I expected. I got it because it compensates for a longer torso so it fit quite better than the regular one where it would end at my hips instead of just below where it's more comfortable.<br />I would buy this again, but maybe I'll get it a size smaller since the sizes can vary."
4.0,"Great fit, great look. I would give it 5 stars but the scales came upside down. I'm 5&#34;7 168lbs and ordered a large. Perfect size."
4.0,I have nicer watches but paid much more for them. If you aren’t the type that needs to impress anyone else (who aren’t impressed anyway) this is a very nice watch that won’t empty the bank account.  Yes it keeps time quite well too.
4.0,Very cute ! Can’t beat the price
4.0,"its smaller than I expected, which means you should pay attention to the case size. However its the lightest most comfortable watch I've ever worn and doesn't look half bad. I have Rolex's and Apple watches etc. But this one is just so nifty and comfortable nd well made I find myself wearing it a lot. The ""light"" is poor and time is nearly readable, but you can at a stretch...but... hey, this cost less than $20!"
4.0,"The bracelet I received was just as colorful as pictured. Only gave it 4 stars because I don't believe the elastic willl hold up, but I'll be very careful!"
4.0,I am a size 14/16 and these fit perfectly. I love the vibrant colors and the very cozy feel of these!  Will look for more from this company!
4.0,"It only took a day to get the item, very nice and cheap"
4.0,This fits well but maybe if I sized down it would be tighter and I wouldn’t need a bra underneath. Could use the extra padding though. I like the color and material though and it appears well made.
4.0,"I liked everything about this onsie.  It was an absolute hit at the baby shower.  The seams were straight, the design was centered, and there were no stray threads.  I, obviously, have not washed the item, but may add another star when the mom-to-be reports back regarding sturdiness."
4.0,"It's nice, thick material.  A good buy for the money."
4.0,Great fit also got complements on how great it looked.
4.0,"Ordered for my wife. This hat looks different from the picture- the color is off and the material looks cheaper than what is shown. I don't recommend it in terms of fashion, but I do think it's a safe sun option if that's all you're worried about. It has a more utilitarian look than a fashion look."
4.0,"Cute shirt, but thread is already coming apart after 1-2 washes."
4.0,The dress is so cute. Thr material is shiny like satin --it kind of remind me of my granny dresses. But I loved it. The pattern is so cute!!!! I got the pink and its bit see through. I am 5'4&#34; and it covers my feet which I don't mind.
4.0,pretty nice leather..
4.0,"I really like the product. It feels nice - has a good stretch to it,  the built-in gator is a nice feature and it seems well made... but unfortunately, it runs very small. I prefer XXL, because I like clothing to be loose, but i have no issues wearing XL. This shirt rode up my arm and left my stomach exposed like it was a Korean size medium. It actually fit nicely on my 110 lb, 5' 6"" female companion, but she does not like the color."
4.0,The bag I received was smaller than the dimensions cited in the description.  The widest part when opened is barely 16 inches.  I wanted a larger bag. However I'm hooked.  The bag is lovely. It is well made.  I like the look of it too much to return it.  Also kudo's to the seller for exceptional packaging.
4.0,Could be cut a little wider but nice
4.0,First time I ever bought jeans online.  I can't find any jeans to fit me in a store.  I actually love these.  Now I am 5ft 4&#34; and these capris actually went to my ankles.  I did roll them up a bit but I love wearing them down to my ankles for casual Friday at work.  The roll is stitch and after one wash it did become unstitched.  They are very stretchy so I could of gone a size down.  I will definitely purchase Wax Jeans again.
4.0,Its very short
4.0,"El producto perfecto, el envío muy rapido, llegó dos dias antes de lo previsto, aunque en la información me decia que venia retrasado en la entrega.  Y finalmente el transportista lo entrego en el conjunto residencial de al frente, y de alli me llamo el guarda para recogerlos."
4.0,For me it was too hot for FL
4.0,"The bracelet is cute, unfortunately the shipping was more than the bracelet itself, it's durable. and i wear it daily. I would recommend this bracelet to friends."
4.0,I’m a dog groomer and it’s working out well. Dries quickly and comfortable but the zippers jingle while you walk and it’s pretty annoying
4.0,Dakine Booker socks are my faves. I have 4 in different patterns and colors. I’m not sure why they stopped making them.<br />My only gripe… Shipping took a while.
4.0,"Very satisfied. For people who have smaller hips, it's a little lose and doesn't have a way to adjust chain."
4.0,"This dress is super cute and flattering. The ruffle details make it just a little bit different which I like. Note that this dress is short though. I'm only 5'2"" and when I sit down it goes about 1/2 way up my thigh which is too short for wearing at the office. In the fall I can get away with it with tights, but not bare leg in spring/summer. Great for outside of the office though.  Husband loves it."
4.0,I love this necklace. It was a little smaller than i expected but still very nice.
4.0,"Cute shirt, great length that covers torso. I'm just a little disappointed in how the sleeves fit, but it could be because I'm built like a hobbit. My shoulders appear very rounded, but other than that, this is adorable."
4.0,"Very delicate fabric. But if you plan to wear for one or two events, it’s good for the price. My wife got lot of compliments for the dress."
4.0,they are so cute on even though they run over a size small I love the way they look I usually wear a size 7 and a half got a size 8 and feels like half size to small so when I order again will get size 9 see how that works
4.0,A simple and comfortable hoodie. 4 of 5 because one of the four I bought had a loose pocket seam that pulled apart after one wash.
4.0,Great so far. Matches my silver jewelry perfectly
4.0,"When first putting them on you can feel the cooling. As with any cooling product if you get them wet it is more noticeable. I am a city mail carrier and I use them instead of sun block. Down side to using them is they fray easily. but I do get a lot of use out of them. I pull them up to the elbows then roll down since my arms seem to be a little thick for them. If I leave them hallway up the bicep then my arm feels bruised. My arms aren't that big or flabby. Im a  5'2"" 155lb female so I would say they run a bit small."
4.0,smaller than I expected but still very nice
4.0,great durability for composite toes allegation’s
4.0,bust size runs smaller than regular
4.0,Worked as advertised!  Surface wasn't as smooth when first installed. However worked well when my Ionic bumped up against a wall. It left a mark that easily wiped off.
4.0,I'm a 34&#34;-35&#34; waist. Decided on the large instead of the mediums. The large fit a slightly loose so that I have cinch the side adjustments. The material is strong and heavy. The seat is reinforced. Much heavier than standard casual cargo shorts. I would expect these to last years of abuse. I've owned them for 11 months now and wear them once a week. No signs of wear or fading.
4.0,Good quality and they look great to boot.
4.0,"I love this dress. My first I bought last summer. It was easily my favorite for fit, comfort and versatility. I am 5’6 165 lbs 38DDD. The XL fits great,  Wash it on gentle cycle. It’s held up great, but has had some easily removed pilling."
4.0,"this is a well made bag and functions well for my needs.  for the money, i am keeping it but i question whether this material is really leather. i think it could be a bonded/blended leather material."
4.0,"while i found the photos to accurately depict the color of the navy blue skirt (very dark navy blue, nearly black) i am returning it for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />i ordered an X-Small which i found to be quite large around the waste. it is not as fitted as i'd like it to be, so it sits a bit lower. i'm 5'2&#34; and the length is a lot longer on me than on the girl in the photo (obviously), but for me it's the perfect ankle length for this type of skirt, even though it doesn't sit as high as i'd like.<br /><br />i think this runs large. sometimes different colors fit differently so i'll see when i get the other skirt (deep red wine). otherwise i was happy to see that the material easily unwrinkled when taken out of the bag and hung up for a bit. i hope the pleats last through washing and i'll update my review accordingly.<br /><br />otherwise, if you're waist is 22&#34; or smaller, this will definitely not stay up."
4.0,Good mask got many compliments but inside was sharp plastic. That was the only problem but still a. Great Halloween mask recommend
4.0,"Runs large, but I'll still probably wear it. The shape is decent"
4.0,They look cute!  I used them for my tragus and they are not to big.  The gems are sparkly. The thread on the post tho is small I hope they will not break easily.
4.0,This shirt feels 100% polyester. It is very soft and form fitting. It wasn’t what I was expecting but still very cute.
4.0,A nice compliment to my other Evil Eye purchases.Lots of praise and comments from friends.  It arrived within 2  days.  What a treat!!!
4.0,"This product is as described. The other reviews were helpful, it does feel like the gloves will fall off if your hand is flat, but as long as you're moving around and using your hands, that feeling doesn't bother you. These gloves were perfect for my steampunk outfit and I got a lot of compliments on them!"
4.0,These Belle p.j.s are so cute. My great grand daughter loves them and will be so cool.
4.0,I purchased the XXL socks. I wear a men's 8 1/2 shoe and have medium size ankles. They fit fine. I wear them while lounging around the house. They are comfortable and somewhat warm and the grips work well on laminate flooring at least while they are new. The quality is fine for the price. I bought a 6pk for under $12. I am happy thus far with my purchase.
4.0,Looks just as pictured. But it’s not very soft and the tag is very irritating even after I tried to cut it off. The sleeves are also slightly short. Also does not keep you very warm. Weird material. But overall cute and I do enjoy it.
4.0,I wear this all the time! The clasp broke but I was able to fix it..worth the money though! so cute!
4.0,"Like it but contrary to other reviews, you can definitely see through the material."
4.0,"Nice and sturdy, heavy enough for the cold Florida winters and looks good on me."
4.0,This is a dress. It fit well. I have not worn or washed it yet and cannot report on that.
4.0,Great simple summer dress that is office friendly! Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the blue color is more of a bright blue rather than a dark navy as pictured.
4.0,US sizes were correct
4.0,I thought it could’ve been just a little shorter.
4.0,"It is what it is. You can't add or change the sheets, but if you have a bunch of small bills you don't want to get damaged, this will do fine. Probably most appropriate if you're traveling and might pick up some currency on your trip--the small size, firm front and back, and plenty of pockets will get your acquisitions home safely without taking up the room of a huge 3-ring binder."
4.0,"Bought for a Halloween costume thinking it would be light and great for a party based off previous reviews. Holy s***! This thing is super heavy, felt like a solid 10 pounds haha. It fit below the waist on someone who is 5'6&#34; and 155 lbs. Looked great though and many people wanted to try it on and did!"
4.0,"Happy with the quality considering the bulk price. Fit nice with pads and without, I am a 32C at 130lbs bought a meduim. I bought for coverage under low shirts and am satisfied. Only disappointment is within my oversight. Straps are thick so they resemble a sports bras under tanks or sheer shirts not as feminine as some razor back bralettes but the support makes the structure worth it."
4.0,"I really like these, the only thing is the seams are already coming apart after one use and it’s a little loose around the ankles, seems like the material isn’t the best, the pattern is great tho."
4.0,I purchased this for a young teen. The ring is cute. It was a little thinner/lightweight than I prefer.
4.0,"I actually got this for part of a costume and it didn't work the way I wanted it to, but I found it can be very comfortable to lounge in or wrap up when cold."
4.0,"I love this watch, my favorite!! Battery died about 8 months after wearing...well hoping it’s the battery...but overall was happy with purchase!"
4.0,"These are awesome- a little big, though."
4.0,"I was thinking this had more depth to it; the filigree looks to be more 3-D (I thought) making a more sparkled, diamond-cut look to it .  It is a pretty necklace, but it is flat."
4.0,"Está lindo pero para niñas mayores de un año, a mi bebé de 10 meses no le ajusto bien<br />La tela de la blusa linda pero la falta está muy simple"
4.0,The insoles fall out which is annoying but other than that they're perfect!
4.0,My babies legs are too chunky!
4.0,"I bought these lights to put into plastic Easter eggs but they would make a good party favor for kids.  They're easy to use and the rubber band isn't too tight for most fingers.  While the lights aren't that bright, they have a nice color and amused the kids.  The lights are small and could be a choking hazard, so maybe not for really young kids.  I would purchase these lights again."
4.0,"Great fit n lovely dress just too short, I'm 5'8 and it was too short for me"
4.0,Super easy to apply. I did notice a difference. It didn't eliminate all fogging completely but definitely helped! I'll continue to use it.
4.0,"Solid watch. I've had this for a year and a half and wear it on the hospital floor once a week caring for patients.<br />The straps seem to be fake leather as they're kind of peeling off at the edges. The loop to slide the strap into is also nearing the end of its life.<br />The second hand doesn't line up perfectly with the seconds-markings. Oftentimes it'll land in between seconds, but still maintain 60 ticks per minute. Watch is still accurate but this may bother you. The green glow of the minute and hour hand is very faint but still visible after a year and a half. Perfect watch to toss around and not worry about it getting dirty. I'm not sure if you can swim with it but it hasn't had water infiltration from wearing it while hand-washing. By the way, this brand is NAVIFORCE, also seen in the photos."
4.0,Very nice boots. Love the color. The got is fine a little big on my calves due to my small legs.
4.0,"Not super stylish, but really a great walking sandal that is so amazingly comfortable. Like walking on a puffy cloud."
4.0,The lens color is amazing.  Super lightweight.  Great buy.
4.0,"This top fits really well and I got the wine color and it looks good with black leggings, dark jeans, and a black cardigan. Super cute and got lots of compliments on it."
4.0,"Love the actual bracelet.  I have had mine a couple of months.  Only issue I have is the silver on the clasp part has turned a copper color.<br />But other than that I love the look, fit and have had several compliments.  Wish I could purchase just the band part."
4.0,Very comfortable thought he pair I received had poor sewing. A few parts of the trouser are beginning to become undone in terms of the sewing.
4.0,"It's definitely not red like in the picture. It's a hot pink color, but it's still cute. I like it because I have tiny wrists and it's small enough to fit me, but it can be adjusted to a larger size."
4.0,"I have a platinum beveled wedding band but wanted something for daily wear. This fits the bill nicely it doesn't scratch and looks very close to my ring. However it has a very slight blueish tinge compared to the platinum, and also compared to another white tungsten band I have."
4.0,"The shirts are cute and are as pictured, but they are snug on my 3 year old who normally wears 4t. I ordered her a 4, and it fits more more like a 3. I’m sending these back & getting the size 5. Hopefully they fit!"
4.0,Headband was cute my daughter loved it. Not super great quality. I can see it breaking if you not careful with it. For the price it was worth it for her donut theme birthday party.
4.0,"I was concern with the quality of the fabric.  I must say that I was impressed with the blouse.  It is very pretty, fits to size and it is comfortable."
4.0,In order to avoid any problems with the fit of the suit know your competitive racing size. And don't forget to take in account for the 34 long or 36 long. The suit is true to size...with no room for mistakes or in between sizes
4.0,Its a really nice top however tje colour is off . I thought it was burgundy or wine red but instead it was just regular bright red which im not a fan of but the top looks and fits great otherwise .
4.0,"I love this and wear it all the time. The only issue is that it has begun to &#34;pill&#34; with wear. I have similar ones which I bought in the late 1980's which have never pilled at all. Oh well. Very warm, very convenient for carrying the camera when out with the dogs."
4.0,"NIce quality, great for the price. Took FOREVER to ship."
4.0,Cute but not a long lasting thing. Can break easily. But for the money granddaughter loved it
4.0,Product feels soft and comfortable.  They appear to be good quality.  I am 5'41/2-  It's very long for me.  They're fine to wear with boots but I wouldn't be able to wear them with regular shoes without having them hemmed up by 4-5 inches.
4.0,Delicate and pretty with  beautiful sparkle.  Looks like real diamonds especially because of the small size of each stone.  Just what I was looking for -- understated elegance at an affordable price.
4.0,Love it!  Could be a bit thicker though.
4.0,Love it. Wear it everywhere
4.0,Great glasses. These were more real than turquoise.
4.0,Great value but they do run a little large.
4.0,I bought this for a trip to Europe so I would have something light but waterproof and this jacket did it just fine. We had 1 light rain day and some breezy days and I was comfortable and as the day warmed up it was light and not a bother to carry.
4.0,"El suéter quedó perfectamente al cuerpo, diseño acordé para la ocasión"
4.0,Looks great! Bought for a gift for the holiday later this year so have not tried it out
4.0,"These are adorable and my stepson is very excited about dino undies! One pair came ripped and will have to be thrown out, but the others appear to be fine."
4.0,Very handy. A little bigger than I wanted
4.0,Cute hat. A little softer than I expected but overall a good quality.
4.0,Love the feel of the fabric. All in all a good buy. The edges tend to roll up so not sure how &#34;non showing&#34; they are. Happy with the colors and they are comfortable except for the tendency to ride up a little.
4.0,"We have a side-by-side that we want to take our 2-year old on leisurely rides, and the state mandates DOT approved helmets. Finding one that would fit her was difficult. We first tried a Raider SM youth full-face helmet, but that was way too big and heavy. Based on reviews we opted for this one, and found one through Amazon Warehouse for cheaper. It's not as light as people made it out to be (well, for a 2-year old anyway), but I think it's much better than a full-face option. I would not let her walk around in this as it's still too heavy for her, but sitting with her 4-point harness up against a tall backed seat, and not going on bumpy roads, it'll suffice and she'll grow into it. I would not recommend for any kids littler, and definitely would not recommend if you plan to go on bumpy/uneven terrain that would cause a lot of jostling of the kid, as they would for sure have the bobble-head effect which I'm sure would not be ideal for their spine."
4.0,"Pros: great case, case bag, and comfortable sunglasses that are a great value.<br />Cons: the sunglasses look slightly different than the picture, more rounded lens aka Ray Bans.<br />Overall a great value that I received as part of a promotion for a full, unbiased opinion."
4.0,"It's a bit smaller than pictured. It's a bit harder to tie in back. It's definitely cute to wear and fits nicely overall. However if you're looking for this to wear for COVID-19, this mask is too thin. Only thing you can do is see how you can retrofit it to add a filter (which is what I plan to do)."
4.0,I shouldve ordered XXL..for plus size women size 16 and over the XL will fit but don't bend over! Lol id buy again.
4.0,they are really pretty
4.0,A bit nice
4.0,"Sizing runs extremely small BUT with a little change in how its worn, it will fit a plus size person. It is thin material. It shrinks if put in the dryer. But for the price, it is exactly what you get for the price you paid."
4.0,Good clip
4.0,"I adore the set and very surprised someone is still making this type of jewelry. I only wish that the charms were an inch bigger. Otherwise, I get all kinds of nice compliments on them. I have told several people where to go for it, so you all should be selling more soon! Thank You"
4.0,"As a birder, I'm occasionally in areas of the tropics, like SE Asia and New Guinea, where leeches are common.  These worked to protect my feet and ankles from the little buggers, and were reasonably comfortable, worn over socks.  But the available colors were yellow and chartreuse, not exactly camouflage to sneak up on forest denizens."
4.0,The dress fitted my niece perfectly.
4.0,"Nice watch, don't use it to close to the hand, cause the bottons are to easy to active And if you're swimming you can damage the watch."
4.0,This product was made well.  My sunglasses fit well in the compartments.  It displays well.
4.0,"AMAZINGLY cute and sophisticated. Only issue is one small feather in the back was damaged in shipping. That regretfully knocked it down one star. But, I'll cut off the broken feather and wear it with great pride."
4.0,"I really appreciate the material. It has a nice weight, and is not skimpy. I recommend this dress. Please be advised that this dress does not have adjustable straps."
4.0,"The fabric is very thin, is not an amazing quality but great."
4.0,"Very pretty, but can almost see through. Also, there is no forgiveness in this dress."
4.0,Size up for washing and drying.<br />Needs detailed ironing!
4.0,"Nice shoes for kids, but the soles fell out of both shoes."
4.0,"I reviewed the sizing chart before purchasing an XXL, because I normally wear a medium or large American size. This fits ok, but is a little shorter than I expected, barely reaching past the top button on my jeans. Yet it isn't quite as fitted through the waist as the photo made it seem.  The fabric is nice and thick, though, and the color is just as I expected. I will keep it, but I won't be wearing it as much as I had hoped. Since it was so cheap, this is still 4 stars to me.  If it had been pricier, I would not have accepted these weird size/fitting issues."
4.0,"I loved this cute dress, the print, and the quality! Unfortunately it was too roomy and there was too much extra material, therefore unflattering, for me at 5' 2"". If alterations weren't so expensive, I would keep it in a heartbeat!"
4.0,"Good dye for suede shoes. Easy to use, but 3 oz bottle barely covered 1 pair of loafers. Ran out while covering up spots missed with first coat."
4.0,I like the fit and cut of these pants. They are super comfortable for a lazy day around the house or for the gym. The only thing I don’t like is that the band of the waist is large but there is only a small elastic piece that goes around the waist in the waist band. If they made this larger the pants would be more comfortable.
4.0,The  chain was a little longer than I needed so I doubled it.
4.0,Knot up the strings or they get lost in the pants. Other than that I love them.
4.0,I purchased the black and white. Beautiful fitting but after several times wearing the suit it began to have those tiny balls in the lower part. Not real happy considering what I paid.
4.0,"I would have given it 5 stars as it keeps the coffee hot for a long time. My only negative issue is that the base at the bottom has split, and I am hopping that it does not eventually cause it to break completely off. Guess I wil have to tape it or something."
4.0,Very soft and fits. Bought the one for me though.
4.0,"Will shrink, get larger size"
4.0,"Very nice quality. A little big, overall I really like it. More of a boyfriend/tunic fit."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and the length is perfect. The material is a little thinner than I'd like, but like them a lot otherwise."
4.0,It arrived on time unscathed.
4.0,"These stud earrings are quite nice. They were a bit larger than expected, but quite pretty, and for this Van Gogh fan a great addition to a Starry Night collection."
4.0,Son loves them however they are heavy to try to run in.  So he prefers a cheaper pair.  He doesn't play basketball.  These are good though for protection of his ankles.
4.0,It runs a little bigger of my regular size. But they are comfortable. Maybe I'll try an smaller size if they work well for me.
4.0,I love that it cover my entire face and it has the little metal thing for nose.
4.0,Very nice robe. My wife loves it.
4.0,"I've ordered a few Allegra K products.  I do agree the size it's a bit confuse.  Sometimes it came too small other it's too big.<br />However, I was surprise to get this one perfect.  I love it & I love Allegra K Tunic & Loose Shirt.  Looking forward to see more styles to shop."
4.0,Fits nicely. Definitely should get a size up. A very good windbreaker but my only complaint is that the hoodie seemed really small on the jacket.
4.0,They fit and are very soft but it said the color was Khaki and they defiantly are a light gray. I ordered them for my daughters school musical and they didn't match her khaki top.
4.0,Muy ajustado de las mangas
4.0,"I've had these for about 5 weeks and my finicky son likes wearing them. They have had their share of drop and rolling around my backpack; yet, there are no scratches. My only desire is a better nose piece as my son has a pretty flat nose, so they slip down."
4.0,This bag is absolutely beautiful in person.  However when I received it it has a small spot on the front of it so I decided to return it due to how much it was I felt like it should be perfect.  The return was flawless and amazon refunded my money very quickly.
4.0,Very lite weight but comfortable
4.0,"Overall a good costume. Pretty much on par with similar suits I've gotten my son over the years. Built in feet and hands (all one piece) with a separate mask. This one has two features I really love. It uses zippers - so the back zips up and doesn't have velcro to snag and pull at the fabric. The other, it has a front zipper so that you don't need to take the whole thing off to go to the bathroom. In both cases they're not all that noticeable. The printing on the fabric is good. Some looks a bit odd like the highlights over the eyes and in general it would be nice if the colors were a bit ""richer"". Still worth it for the Deadpool fan in your family!"
4.0,"My 18month son wore these without much fuss. He's not thrilled putting them on at first but once they are on he wears them with little fuss. He mows the yard with his Dad and we recently attended an air show with them.  Would give 5 stars, but the black plastic cushion has popped off once or twice in the process of unfolding them; not too big a deal it snaps right back in. Were shipped promptly and received as promised."
4.0,This was a nice bracelet. It is very shiny and the packaging is very beautiful. The bracelet is very rigid (as you might expect) so if your wrist is smaller than the bangle it looks a little strange.
4.0,kinda big for my 9 year old. manual is really hard to read. I may wear it instead if I can figure out how to make it stop beeping!
4.0,"This is super cute and my niece loved the paw prints on the mittens. It looks great and fits a teenager or an adult. The was a down side and that was the paw prints on the mittens cracked after an hour of sledding. Other then that it is very warm, soft and looks super cute!"
4.0,I used it for a block of wood I have in the shape of a cat.  The whiskers fit perfectly!
4.0,It looks very durable but way too chunky looking.
4.0,"I ordered the 3XL in the navy floral. For reference I am pear shaped: size 18-20 on top and 20-22 on bottom. Bust is around 40B. The upper part of the dress: the sleeves were tight. (My arms are bigger so you may not have this issue with the dress if you don’t carry extra weight there). The elastic around the “off shoulder” was comfortable.<br />Lower part of dress: the waist was snug. It was wearable but I would have been “sucking in” all night if I wore it. Skirt part below the waist was flowy but it hung nicely. It is sheer, you’ll need a slip."
4.0,"Beautiful color and details. Fits great. It is very thin, much thinner thN expected."
4.0,"Quality, good price, and name brand."
4.0,"Love the way these look. Extremely durable; I've dropped them a number of times and where other shades have broken, these have stood the test of time. Had them now for about 6-8 months and wear them almost daily. Only took off one star because they arrived with the nose posts pretty bent up. Thanks"
4.0,"If you have one of those kids that likes to put on fashion shows for you, then you should add this to her collection.<br /><br />It is of middling quality--all synthetic and I would definitely want to wash it on a gentle cycle because I doubt it would stand up to heavy duty.  Probably want to air dry it as well.<br /><br />One important caution:  It violates Daddy's fundamental rule on glitter--not allowed in the house because it ends up everywhere."
4.0,"I couldn’t find a sizing chart while making my decision to buy on this item. I do think that needs to be added to the description. With that said I wear a pants size 16/18 depending on the style. I decided to go with the 2XL. They fit pretty well and they definitely will make you sweat! I’m optimistic that these will help shed some stubborn thigh weight. They do have a very strong plastic odor, that was expected. I’ve been wearing them under my regular workout leggings and you cannot tell that they are even there. I would recommend."
4.0,"Theyre all really cute, they fit well, but do not tighten too much because if you sneeze, the clasps will break."
4.0,Nice realistic looking charm.
4.0,These are great for wearing under scrubs if you're always cold. I definitely get warm in them. They don't breathe as well as I'd like but I'll definitely keep wearing them.
4.0,For the price this skirt is okay. It is slightly too big but I can tie the strings in the front tighter to make it fit on my body. The material is not the best quality but you get what you pay for. It is not a thick suede material but it is ok for the price. I ordered a size S and have a 27&#34; waist.
4.0,"Very cute a t little tighter then expected, but I love it I got tons of compliments"
4.0,Great stocking stuffer! I love that each comes with it's own clasp clip. Really cute colors. They have a strange odor when you first open them but it wears off after some use. I believe it's just the padded like material they are made up of.
4.0,I got the navy and purple. The purple actually looks orange. The fit at the top flaps a little but still really like the dress. The fit is loose which is nice for the hot summer. I’m 5’3 150lb and the large fit perfect.
4.0,"Nice material, the color is a little weird and is really open in the front."
4.0,a great watch and very stylish.
4.0,I like the look and the glare reduction is great.  They do seem a little flimsy.  My first pair snapped at the nose/eye piece connection with a mild twist to the frame.
4.0,The white side of the dress is slightly see-through if you wear a black or dark-colored bra or undies.<br /><br />Cute fall dress!  5'2  150lbs 34B  fit nicely<br />Can't wait to wear this fall
4.0,Beautiful! Much higher quality than expected. I was nervous it would be super cheap looking but it's not at all.
4.0,Great look...picks a little to easily
4.0,I have lived with arm pain for about a year.  I ordered these compression arm sleeves and have seen a drastic difference.  My pain is almost completely gone. Would recommend these for everyone!!
4.0,Ordered a size medium. Comfortable and stretchy. A tad sheer but wear the right undergarments you won’t have an issue
4.0,Beautiful color but the material gets wrinkled very quickly.
4.0,Love it. I wear it almost everyday.
4.0,"Warm enough for winter weather hike with long coat & boots. Super soft inside. Size up. I went up from a usual Small & went with Large based on other reviews. 5'6 124lbs athletic legs, small waist.<br /><br />Perfect for post orthopedic surgery activies/rehab"
4.0,"Nice lightweight jacket, perfect for traveling.  The fit is a bit snug."
4.0,This is a very nice good size purse. It's super soft but it's a mystery material. My mom loved it when she saw it so I guess you can say it's mom approved.
4.0,Its one of those glasses that I always wanted to have and I found it here. It really looks good when you put it on and take selfie lol
4.0,"My daughter wanted a one piece, long sleeve bathing suit and much to my surprise, they existed! This fits her comfortably and provides the coverage she was seeking. The top half is a little loose but since it is one piece & long sleeve, I think it would be a challenge to get on if it was any tighter. She's worn it half a dozen times so far and it's held up."
4.0,"Just a tad small, otherwise it's quite comfortable to wear. Love the sturdiness of it and how cute it is."
4.0,"I needed a little backpack and this was perfect because I liked the color and it was just the perfect size. But after 2weeks of having it the handle at the top has ripped off. No I don’t carry anything heavy in it. I was a little sad when I found out, maybe I can take it to the cleaners and they can put a double stitch."
4.0,Not bad seem to be decent for price
4.0,Absolutely love this piece!
4.0,"Super cute and my 5 year old old granddaughter loved them,  just to small to be comfortable"
4.0,"Love the color, the waterproof zippers, the packable material.  But I am especially pleased with the sleeve length.  Everyone in my family has long arms for their size, we are all tall.  So jackets usually show off our wrists, especially when doing something active where you reach forward, like for bicycling.  This jacket is cut to fit well even in that situation.  Nice!<br /><br />I would like it better if it had a mesh lining to keep the waterproof coating off my skin when wearing over a t-shirt.  But another layer would add bulk and the lack of bulk is nice, so I guess it’s a trade off.  My dad says he cuts those mesh layers out of his jackets!<br /><br />I am also not crazy about the brand name printed on the back.  People keep asking me what “LUSHENUNI” is.  It’s not a fashionable name brand everyone has heard of, so it’s baffling to people.<br /><br />But the biggest problem, is that my family members keep taking it.  Lol!<br /><br />Edited to add:  My dad has worn this jacket all day every day, indoors and out, for the last six weeks.  It is holding up well, no serious stains so far, no tears, the zippers still work."
4.0,Cute on the go dress<br />Lots of compliments; Can be dressed up or down
4.0,Nice addition to my apple bands......!!!!!
4.0,"I had to take this watch to my jeweler so that she could adjust it for me.  It took her half an hour to do the job.  The watch is very difficult to size to your wrist - despite the directions.  It is not a lightweight watch - feels rather heavy on the wrist, but I am giving it 4 stars because it comes beautifully packaged, is attractive, and the bonus bracelet adds a nice touch.  I hope that it does not become discolored or turn the skin green.  Will update this review should that happen."
4.0,"The fit was as expected, but I returned it because I just didn't like it on me nor did I like it for the event I bought it for. Good dress for the price."
4.0,I'm happy with my chokers. But they are not velvet they are leather.
4.0,Comfortable pants! Fits great.
4.0,"Nice product, nice price. Pretty comfortable and I like the colors. Will definitely be buying this again. A few other reviewers said the bra runs small, but I found they ran true to size. I'm a 34D and I bought a 36D just in case. It fits pretty much fine on the third hook, but I'd like a little more support/compression. Not really worth the effort of exchanging it, I'll just buy a 34D next time."
4.0,Will have to wear a cardigan with it because it is thin and shows back bulge - but otherwise it's flattering and cute.
4.0,I love this product. I got a medium I'm about 130lb and curvy and it fit kind of tight but not too bad. The material is fine. I did notice the seam wasn't fully finished so I just sewed it myself. That was the only down side to this product.
4.0,I normally wear XL but I had to order this top in XXL and it fit perfect.<br />Blouse is very sexy and nice quality
4.0,Bought two of these for my older girls. Arrived in time bubble mailer with one of the posts sticking through the package. The other was bent.<br />Didn't fit my oldest (18 years old).
4.0,"Review for: Bropite Compression Socks Women & Men,7 Pairs Ankle Athletic Socks Low Cut with Arch Support Best for Athletic<br /><br />I found these socks to be a good fit for my women’s size 8.5 feet. They are comfortable and I get a nice snugness around my arches. The colors of the socks match the picture in the description. Each one comes in an individual wrap incase you want to share with friends. All pair are ankle height, perfect for wearing with athletic  shoes."
4.0,"Good quality, well made, the size adjustment is perfect."
4.0,"Cute oversized shirt, looks great with leggings and snow boots,  sleeves are very short, like 3/4 length sleeves, will need to modify the sleeves somewhat ."
4.0,I like them but they seem to run a little small
4.0,"Great Dress for the price! I bought it for a Halloween party in Disney. I will wear it again for Halloween to take the kids trick or treating! It was a little snug in the chest but fairly true to size! I wore a size 16 here, and ordered an extra large."
4.0,Runs a little snug
4.0,"This was definitely lightweight.  I hate anything constricting around my neck so much that I can't wear turtlenecks.  This was so light, I didn't notice.  The color was a true lavender and was a great accent piece.  I took off a star b/c it started to unravel after wearing a few times."
4.0,Arrived in good shape. Sad the other one I purchased was defective.
4.0,The dish is wonderful. Just like any other porcelain jewelry dish. The keychains have sharp edges and just didn’t fit the style of the dish. I purchased this for the dish so I didn’t care about the keychains.
4.0,My replacement bands fit perfectly and seem to be very well made. The only negative is that there are not many color choices.
4.0,Worn them only once yet but they stay up well. Think they will definitely fit the need.
4.0,Very nice design; however the actual face would’ve looked a little nicer without being as quite as “stripey” with light and dark grain that distracts.
4.0,Muy buena calidad en la tela solo para ser talla M me quedo grande podría agarrar talla S la próxima ocasión ya que si me gusto
4.0,Es igual que en la foto.
4.0,I used this for a “fiesta” theme family photo shoot. Everything was great except the color is not like the picture. Picture shows burgundy but it is really a bright red burnt  orange color. I’m 5’6  size 12/14 and am wearing an xl
4.0,Clasico reloj casio no puede fallar es el segundo que compro!
4.0,"It looks great I really like it. The only thing that is a little bit of a issue is it is a little tough to put in. The screw is tiny, if you use needle nose pliers it makes it easier to put in."
4.0,"Fun shirt, very casual."
4.0,It's a comfortable shirt. I chose Green and it was true to fit for me. Waffle Henley Shirt.
4.0,"These are cute and nicely made.<br /><br />The clasps are cheap. They don't have that twirly thing to secure them. But they're just Christmas pins and rhinestones are really nice.<br /><br />It's a great value! I'm guessing these pins would be three or four dollars each at Target or wherever.<br /><br />I took a point off because they all have the cheap clasps and also because the eyes on one of the Santas don't show because the enamel is a little bit too thick. they must not have good quality control because the problem is really obvious. I'll take a little bit of black paint and touch it up.<br /><br />As far as the quality for what I paid, these are real bargain and I like them a lot."
4.0,It's nice. The piece represents the description. The cross slides out through the infinity and so they disconnect if you're not careful.  It's easy to lose from your neck.
4.0,excellent for gyming!
4.0,Very fun! Bought for vaca and would buy again! May get more. Runs larger than I expected. Material very soft and comfortable!
4.0,Like the slippers only wish the massage were firmer. I have already worn one pair out and it's only been 2 months
4.0,"Shirt was great ,but if you have over a sz C breast they are too short . Im a DD and it signs cover bottom of my bra . Very short crop top . Great if you a sz A or B only ."
4.0,Dress is super cute and great for summer. Fits sa little large everywhere except for books. Small fit my frame perfectly 5'6 athletic 155lbs. But at a 34D my boots felt like they were spilling out. Maybe with a bralette or size up if big busted. Otherwise cute dress for summer.
4.0,"I bought this about 6-9 months ago. It's surprisingly comfortable given the petals are pointy. Looks pretty cute and you can see the flower design. Some cons however are 1) the ball is at the bottom and is the only part that unscrews, which makes attaching the ball pretty hard as its at the bottom and harder to access, especially if you have big fingers or long nails 2) I've noticed the past couple months the skin around my ear and the petals are turning green which isn't cute. However, for the price it looks cute and remained cute for quite a while. I have the 6mm bar length for my rook and the length is perfect"
4.0,"Lightweight and very good make , price is cheap for the  quality"
4.0,Plus size friendly-ish. Slight rolling. Get leg garters . cute and comfy material.
4.0,It came in good condition. Cute dress!
4.0,My grandson has been loving this and it helps him to learn to swim better in our pool
4.0,"I love jewelry and always look forward to adding cute items to my jewelry box.  The ring is as cute in person as it is in pictures. It fits perfectly and comfortably and looks good with just about every item in my closet. The only thing I can say wrong about it is that the first time I put it on and wore it for whaile, I went to take it off and it seperated from the inner ring, which I did not know it was two pieces. It went back in but now I am concious of it."
4.0,"Product seems alright. They said it has an hdmi, but it doesn’t. So get an adapter. Besides that, it’s working well"
4.0,"Very good apron, good protection. My wife uses it more than her others. It could use some sort of adjustment at the neck."
4.0,It's small so it doesn't feel annoying on your wrist . . . the problem is you can't use the light in stopwatch mode.  It resets it
4.0,the leg warmer works fine.  the only change I have is the knee pads don't really come to my knee high.
4.0,"I wanted to get this mask because I just need something breathable, trying to navigate life after COVID. Unfortunately, I learned that the CDC considers masks with these ventilation filters *not* conducive to stopping the spread. The one-way filter will protect you, but all the air your breath out is not filtered and can increase the spread if you are asymptomatic or sick.<br /><br />That all being said, it's a great mask! I have still worn this out while running errands and haven't had any trouble even though it's deemed ""unsafe"". I am tested weekly for COVID as per my employer, so I feel comfortable wearing this knowing I am not spreading the disease. The straps in the back are a little big for my liking and overlap each other, but that's a non-issue at the end of the day."
4.0,"These are comfortable and I can't believe how cheap they are!  I only like three of the colors but, at this price, that's alright.  I got these in two different strengths.  I also don't need 5 pairs.  But, maybe I'll keep them in case they break.  They seem sturdy though.  I only wish they were a little smaller in size.  I'm really glad that Amazon had these."
4.0,A little itchy on the waist
4.0,"Yep it was small, but now I have a weight loss goal!"
4.0,I love the way it looked and got my face perfect. The glasses fit perfect and it really does help the eyes from getting sore and tired. Great deal
4.0,Sleeves were not as picture but it’s a nice dress
4.0,Hard to zip up coat. The fur not attached and not able to be attached
4.0,I dropped a star because 2 broke right off the bat but other than that they’re great. One was broken when I got the package.
4.0,"This is cute, I'm glad I bought it! I would have preferred the skirt to be shorter because I have short legs but they are knee length (as advertised, I was just wishing for dryer shrinkage). This is exactly as the picture is shown I docked a star because I do not really like the sleeve cuffs... They are not stretchy and are tighter than the sleeve itself is and I don't care for that style! Still happy I bought this &amp; I can see it being useful in all seasons, dress it down with just flip flops or dress it up with leggings and boots. I ordered the size small and I am 5'3 140 lbs 36dd, the fit was what I expected."
4.0,The top runs a little small. I had to take the padding out for it to fit properly. I usually wear a size large top but I had to get an extra large bikini top.
4.0,"Perfect for a teenager,  cute casual look."
4.0,Fit is good and they are comfortable
4.0,"Fits good, but zipper could be a little longer"
4.0,We gave this as a confirmation gift and she loved it.
4.0,I always order these 2 sizes larger than I wear. Then it fits perfectly and super cute!
4.0,"Good bag, holds up well. It would be great if it had more inner structure. All it has is 2 side pockets and things tend to get lost inside."
4.0,Gave it 4 stars because it is a little short for me. I'm 5'5. So I ordered XL and the length is perfect but now the dress is a little big. It's still is a cute dress. Got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I have not used these yet, but the pink flower pattern is very pretty and these seem to be made well. I am excited to use them!"
4.0,"Very nice set, soft and good quality. Looks exactly like the picture."
4.0,Got many compliments on this sweater
4.0,"Very cute socks that stay on my newborn with plenty of room to grow. One of the pairs was noticeably shorter than the others, though. There were also a lot of long threads on the inside that I trimmed to ensure they didn’t get wrapped around my daughters toes. Overall pleased with the product for the price."
4.0,"Light, compact and easy to use"
4.0,Es muy boni mi bebé tiene un año 5 meses peso18 libras el quedo un poquito grande pero esta bien para crecer talla 18 a 24 meses
4.0,"I like it, but it does run small.  I was at the top of the size, and it is tight."
4.0,"I am in between sizes, i had ordered an A3 the first time and the pants fit great but not the top. Exchanged and order the A3H the top fits great and the pants are a little big  but overall a great GI. You can't beat the price and the quality of Elite Sports gear. I have a gi and rash guards from Elite and I will continue to buy their products."
4.0,"Unfortunately, the clasp was broken on the first one so I wasn't too happy with that.  But the second one worked well and my daughter-in-law loved it.  So, overall I'm happy with it."
4.0,very cute jacket lots of bright colors runs alittle big in size but worth the price.
4.0,"Well, I just reviewed the wrong pants, so I will try again, very comfy, like pajamas, wore them to my trip to Mexico and went into the ocean with them when I got there and just rinse them in the shower and dried naturally by the sun and wore them again on my way back at the end of the week.<br />Purchased two more colors when I got home but the material feels different, fit the same, hope they will do as great as this.<br />10/05/16 update to the new beige pair, it does feel and wear much different that green blue I purchased earlier, still very comfy but elastic waist and material are not the same, still keep my rating until I try the green pair"
4.0,Nice watch for the price. Functional bezel isn't functional but no big deal. Clasp on band came apart once but easily repaired. I like the look and would purchase again. Fast shipping great seller
4.0,"My goodness;This is the most perfect shopping I've ever done;I feel really, really great in this dress;Once walked in the street a lot of people all praise my special beauty;Most of all, I am in a very good mood.On the way to feel that their head has changed a lot better than before;A perfect shopping experience;I hope you can help"
4.0,"Love love the design of the top and the colour is nice though lighter than expected but the size is too small. I especially love that it doesn’t leave all the weight of the bust hanging on the bottom of the neck, but if only it actually fit a bigger bust..."
4.0,I absolutely love them. I have a small head so they fit me well. I can tell they are cheaply made but for the price they are great!
4.0,"So far so good, held up after a busy workday. Only downside for me personally is after I took out a few notches its a little tight, but if I add one back its too loose."
4.0,VERY NICE FOR COSTUME JEWELRY!! PRETTY ON THE EAR
4.0,I’ve had socks by this company before.  I love them.  They’re not too thin but not so thick as to be a problen either.  The botton of the foot area is slightly padded.  They hold up well after repeated washing.<br /><br />My only complaint with their mens socks is I get them for the hubby and end up wearing them myself.  I am a size 8-9 in womens shoes (6-7 in mens) and they just fit me more comfortably than they fit (size 11-12 mens).  I have them in womens too and the size difference is very slight.  They can fit the hubby’s foot.  They’re just a little snug on him.
4.0,"Excellent color/pattern design choices. Stands out for cars to see. All riding jersies with back pocket carriage have same flaw -- when anything even with modest weight is in the pocket (e.g. cell phone) it pulls jersey back along your neck, making it less comfortable."
4.0,"This blouse is very cute and classy, but it does run very very small. The fabric is very thin. So, personally, I would wear a camisole under it. I liked it so much I am considering ordering it two sizes larger"
4.0,"Though Mr. Owl was somewhat larger than expected, the necklace is fun and useful for plain tops' decor."
4.0,These fit great and are easy to adjust. I had to order a second set after 6 months of regular use because the plastic clips broke. Otherwise these are great water tight goggles
4.0,Little too long for petites (im 5') but a little tailoring of the straps will do the trick. I wish the straps were adjustable :/ Otherwise the material is nice and the pattern is great.
4.0,"The material was soft and draped in a pretty manner.  I bought it to hide my stomach, and it does a pretty good job at that.  I wore it today with leggings, but I also plan to wear it with tights as a dress.  I am 5'8&#34;, and the length is good for either option"
4.0,"Well built belt, attractive"
4.0,"these are ferfect for gifting, they have apparently had a lot of work put into them"
4.0,Is a little smaller than the picture represents but it is still a nice travel bag.
4.0,"The earrings look great and the magnets are strong. I wore them for a costume and had them on for about 6 hours straight. The following day, both ears developed a hard spot on them where the earrings were and almost created like a zit / cyst type thing. They are very painful and now scabbed over. I would still wear the earrings if needed again for a costume but im prepared for the aftermath."
4.0,Love them super cute was unsure about size I can be between 13-14 so I got extra large super big I'm gonn try shrinking but this has lots of stretch n their really dark black  n great lengths cuz I'm 5'6 n i hate when this just right or too short...just perfect  cute to wear with heels
4.0,Love the coloring
4.0,"Good product, but they don't stay put the whole day. I will buy again and get a one size larger."
4.0,Just as described. Very pretty!!
4.0,"Very lightweight and cute, especially for the price! I stocked up on several and keep them on hand for last minute gifts!"
4.0,"Very attractive Top, though runs smaller than expected, so I either will wear when bust gets smaller somehow, or offer as gift to daughter. It’s nice enough that I wouldn’t want to return it. Especially like the elbow patches; look very authentic."
4.0,"I love these capris. They are so comfortable when I'm working out. They even have a little pocket where I can put something (like my car key) in the waistband. These are definitely worth the money. Everytime I go to workout I find myself reaching for these over my other workout pants. My only complaint is that they want to stretch a little, creating a crotch sag when I run. The problem might be that I order too large. Because they're so form fitting I ordered up a size just in case. These are true to size."
4.0,Cute shirt but the material is quite thin. I need to wear an undershirt.
4.0,Necklace is a little hard to get on at first as it is slip knotted but the medallion is excellent.
4.0,"The packaging was adorable, the panties are adorable. I would buy them again. My only concern is my daughter has a prominent rear and our butts require a little more hemming under the cheek regions. That said, my daughter tends to get wedgies with these panties due to lack of added material to keep them from sliding up. But overall they are good quality and washed well and again, super cute!"
4.0,Very Thin
4.0,The one I wanted. It in 1x that all Iam ok this is nice. An warning. Lol April
4.0,Very comfortable pants and I love that they are pull on.  I have them in several colors.
4.0,"OK, so to be fair ... I don't use these for welding. But they are excellent fire gloves for camping and my backyard fire pit. They are solid construction, and give me protection when I need to move logs around, or to grab a cast iron pot that has been bubbling away with something good. The gloves fit well, and everything works like a glove should. Freedom of movement is quite restricted. I have some other gloves that use patch &#34;armor&#34; over a more flexible surface that allow you greater mobility. But those leave gaps, whereas these are just tough.<br /><br />Received for review."
4.0,Fit great!  Cant' o wrong with Gold Toe!
4.0,Medium - fits great - thin fabric; great for summer!
4.0,Love it. Too hot for summer though.
4.0,"This product did as I hoped. It will help to stretch your shoes/boots. I think it would work lots better in less rigid boots than mine, but it did help. Reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the stretchers seem rather flimsy and need to be handled carefully. They are rather difficult to adjust down in the boot, but they will stretch as promised!"
4.0,Very nice top!!
4.0,"This is a great purse for someone with a messy life.  I can take this anywhere and put anything in it and not worry.  It would be nice if the lining was a different color - with so much room things can get a little lost.  But it’s worth it.<br />I’ve carried an iPad, phone, a small knitting project, a book, keys, wallet, sunglasses and some cosmetics.  It was very full, but still zipped closed."
4.0,"A nice band, comfortable and strong, but a little thin.  Its lines dont seamlessly flow with the watch like the original, so it looks dainty on my wrist like im wearing a &#34;womans&#34; band. Doesnt pinch tho, and doesnt easily fall off."
4.0,"This is a really cute romper.  The greatest thing about it is that there is a zipper at the crotch.  This makes diaper changes a breeze. I want to buy more just for that.  That being said, the fit is smaller than usual. I got the size 80 (10-12 months) for my 7 month old son. My 7 month old is also small for his size. He is in the 5th percentile and the romper fits a tad long.  The pant legs are also quite slim. They fit my son but he is on the slimmer side.  One would definitely have to size up considerably if your child is of average size and above.  The quality is ok for the price it’s fine.  I want to buy more in another color but only the short sleeve black bunny has prime."
4.0,Loved the thickness of the dress and the cut. Feels and looks good on
4.0,"A bit small, but my wife loved it."
4.0,"I really wanted to love these but I didn’t like the material. I wouldn’t recommend for anyone who is doing a serious cardio workout. Also, these gave me really bad camel toe!"
4.0,It was a gift for a 16 year old birthday. I was satisfied but I did think it would be bigger.
4.0,"Converse run 1/2 to 1 size large i knew this before purchasing however. These shoes are leather whis was unexpected but ive come to like it. They have a much more  cushioned  soul than other converse i have owned. Great looking shoe, would give it 5 starts if it were suede but still great as leather."
4.0,can be hard if you do not have finger nails but that is my problem not the products
4.0,the strap broke . the clip that holds the strap broke
4.0,I needed a replacement chain for a cheap necklace I had broken and I saw this one for the right price.  I liked it but it was not exactly the regular yellow gold like you see normally.  It is more of a orangey gold.  Still it works ok with my piece so its ok
4.0,"The large does stretch - I was afraid the fabric would be difficult. I'm 5'7&#34; and normally fit a 12-14 in women's s sizes. It fit closely but not so tight it was uncomfortable. I had enough of room if i wanted to wear a few layers underneath. For me its length reached right above my knees and every time I moved or walked, the dress would rise so I had to pull it down. - It is not unbearable.<br /><br />The fabric is light and soft. In the stretched parts it would become a tiny bit see through but not that you would need to wear an additional garment underneath - this is for the chest area for me. - (that area didn't stay the solid color of the dress, it turned a lighter shade)<br /><br /> The flower patterns landed in my mid section which camouflaged a little that section which is great! The split in the bak made the dress a little less modest from what I'm used to because I was expecting the dress' length to be at least below my knees, but the good thing it's not a big one."
4.0,It was so cute. Exactly what I was looking for. It was just a tad bit big
4.0,It fits snug.  Not a lot of room if your big busted.  Turns it into an empire dress for me.  I'm keeping it because of the nice material.
4.0,Great colors. Just a little stuff.
4.0,the wife liked it
4.0,It looked great with my semi-casual outfit for a family wedding.
4.0,This is a simple but beautiful bracelet.
4.0,"Boot is a little snug, but the shade of red and the texture of the leather is exquisitely divine. Perfect heel height."
4.0,Thin and flowy. Great for a summertime cover over a tank or tee. Would work for a bathing suit cover as well. Its sheer and slightly see through. Great for the price.
4.0,Cute shirt.  Fits nice.
4.0,"Nice fabric, well made. Wish there was a full brief option that sits at the waist."
4.0,I love this dress! I purchased my size regular size and it fit fine! Super cute I only wish the stripes were all black and white an not green but still super cute it would have been perfect if it had pockets will upload a picture next time I wear it
4.0,classy but a little shiny
4.0,Light weight good quality material<br />I am 5'4&#34; and this is just slighty longer on me..I wore it with straight leg pants..But I prefer to wear longer tops..Great top to wear with leggings
4.0,So the reason I didn’t give you give you five star is the colors are too bright too much for me for my style. But it is good quality.
4.0,"I was surprised actually, it looks exactly like the picture, the quality isn't that great but not so bad too<br />I think its price is perfect for it<br />The mirrored half of the lenses need attention because it can be scratched very easily, other than that I'm happy with it"
4.0,Fits perfectly I think the only problem I have is that the stitching is kind of weird like there’s a lot of the thread loose.
4.0,"I got these because I was going to Universal Studios and I was going to be a wizard all day. I wear the same stone plugs every day usually so I would expect my ears to be pretty evenly stretched. I got one in easily, but it seemed like the second one was made a little larger than the first. I eventually got it to fit and I love them, but it was a struggle. I will wear them again in the future!"
4.0,Easy to pack and store.
4.0,"I really like the fit, style & color. However, I work in a dialysis clinic and I've only had them for just a couple weeks and the tops are peeling already"
4.0,The rise wasn’t high enough and the top seam pinched too much and was unflattering
4.0,"Would have been nice to have a bandeau that is the same color as the dress to cover up bras. This style dress was my brides maids dresses and I ordered from a different site and it came with one. Over all, I love the dress and color. I am a size 14 and ordered a large."
4.0,Used for casual wear. Very pretty.
4.0,Sleek and sharp looking bought the next size up. They seem good quality my toddler is generally hard on shoes.
4.0,"The boots are sturdy and rugged.  Though they fall under the Georgia family, I think the GIANT is the official brand/maker.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's still a good, quality boot.  Also, it's not really a pair of WORK boots.  It's more of a casual boot, than it is a boot to go out in labor in.  I did have a bit of a problem with one of the boots; the stitching on the back above the heal became undone a little.  It was an easy fix, and I think it's an uncommon occurrence in these boots. Overall, I like how they fit, and how they look.<br />Oh, and they're not made in the USA, for those out there that might be wondering."
4.0,Always love them!
4.0,"Slightly small, but overall really well made. Satisfied. Will have to lose a few pounds lol"
4.0,"Good product, a little big, and I wish they were a little thicker, other than that a good quality for the price."
4.0,"I'm 5' 2"", 116 lbs. Its cute, but the skirt is longer than I expected. It comes to my knees. I got a large and have some room in the skirt. The shirt is way to roomy but I can fix that. Ladies make sure you adjust it to fit perfectly before showing your mothers. Thanks to my mother for saying I look like a little girl and not an adult, I no longer know how I feel 😭. But its a lovely outfit and well made. Fits nice and came with earrings.<br />Edit: if you're small chested like me, pull the tie pieces around to the front and tie under your bust, it looked so much better that way."
4.0,"Great comfortable, sexy peice of lingere that is easy to wear, fits well, easy to wash, and durable. I plan to get more in different colors."
4.0,Case wears so soon that you are afraid of breaking glasses in your pocket
4.0,"I received these boots today. After reading previous reviews, I decided to order a half-size larger. In length it WAS NOT necessary (I alway order a size DOWN in regular UGG shoes)  However, as was mentioned by others many times in past reviews , this boot is difficult, if not impossible, to put on unless you have a slim foot (an ankle zipper would have solved this issue)  . I do not have a slim foot! . It has a very snug instep. I struggled but managed to get the boots on. I have no doubt in time, and wearing, this problem would resolve itself as the leather stretches. I have a somewhat wide foot. I did re-order the size smaller (my true size) to compare because of the length. The only problem would arise if I cannot get the boot on due to the tight instep. Order 1/2 size larger if you plan to wear socks for sure. This boot isn't lined at all. I hope to use a soft insole in the bottom if the instep stretches enough for one to fit.There is no foot support- flat shoe.. It rises to just above your ankle- a very low cut boot. but cute."
4.0,"I love the look of this watch. It can go from workout to casual to casual/dress pretty seamlessly. The band catch where you tuck the band in began to tear within a couple months. It took in water when I wore it swimming, though it has a water resistant statement on it. Love the watch, would buy it again... Just being more careful with the water."
4.0,Bought for my 4 year old son who was thrilled when it arrived.  Not the best quality but will probably last the year.
4.0,"I normally wear a Large (I'm 5'9, 180, 38B and long waisted) and the sizing chart and comments lead me to believe these fit TTS. However, the Large is actually a bit too small to zip in my chest area. With that said, I will simply be exchanging becAuse this dress is AMAZING! The quality of the fabric and the stitching is unbelievably wonderful and astounding for this price! The fabric is thick and the print is a very vivid color. I'll be exchanging and ordering a couple more in the process! (I gave 4 star for the sizing issue)"
4.0,This is very thin and see though. Worked great as a cover up on vacation.
4.0,This is a nice ring set that can be ordered in sizes 5-10.. This is not a sterling silver ring. It is a two piece set that is plated with platinum to give it a nice shine and color. The cubic zirconia is nice looking and it looks like it could be a real wedding set. I like the price. I also like that I can get it in my size. It is pretty.
4.0,"I have XL in Danskin, got 3X in these and the Danskins are bigger. The fabric is lightweight and shiny, not like pic. The stitching is overt, but I like that."
4.0,"Overall, great tanks! I bought the maroon one first, then navy blue, and gold. Green is next.<br /><br />I typically wear a small/medium but I did have to order a large to get the fit right. However that causes the tank to be longer in length. But minor issue that I can easily work around.<br /><br />Received it pretty quickly as well. I am indeed satisfied with these tanks."
4.0,"Little bag holds a lot! So far holding up to heavy everyday use (1month). Would give it 5 stars, but a little put off by the quality of the strap attachments at first.. seem cheap/flimsy. But seems to be holding up."
4.0,My daughter loves her princess set.
4.0,Quality wise it’s pretty good
4.0,"Loved the coat but if I gained one pound it would be too tight even though I ordered one size up. The other thing is, I couldn't wear a sweater with it because it was too snug. It's too bad because it's just what I was looking for in length and warmth."
4.0,"These are very nice socks. The price was great and I'm happy with the quality. My only downside is I expected them to be a little thicker by looking at the pic and being made of wool. Other than that, great socks!"
4.0,"While computer screen colors can vary, they clearly show a maroon/burgundy shade BUT the shirt I received is a bright, bright red. Since it's only going to be worn for an afternoon, it's not a huge deal, but it was a little disappointing. Nonetheless, it fits my husband. He's a large (very muscular with a 44"" chest) and I ordered x-large because I worried a large would be too snug since it's supposed to look ""blousy."" It fits good, so I recommend going a size up if you want a looser fit."
4.0,"Purchased all of these rfid blocking wristlets for my family and girlfriends so they wouldn’t have to carry a big purse around all the time.  The colors were amazing and it definitely fit all the required credit cards, money and a thin phone."
4.0,gloves do allow you to text but they are extremely tight and rip easily. they also dont keep your hands as warm as other gloves do. however they are still worth buying if you need to text during the winter
4.0,Love this player
4.0,"I ordered 3 bags, so around 120 pieces and only got one defective. Not top quality if that's what's you're looking for but for small-medium charms they are perfect!! Overall I don't regret buying from here."
4.0,"Cute, fashionable hoops. At the price though they are a little cheaply made , it is just a bit of a trade off."
4.0,Ok on the feet but too tight on the ankles.
4.0,"This is a great suit for what it is. Looks great and feels great. With what it's made of, yes it will get pretty warm. Wear it in the fall winter and early spring and you'll be fine. If you sweat a lot undershirt and dress shirt accordingly. Enjoy turning heads because this thing is sharp!"
4.0,Should be a little bigger
4.0,"Very pretty.  Has a nice, solid feel to it.  It's shinier than pictured, guess it's been rhodium plated. It looks more like an Iron Cross than a Jerusalem Cross.  That's OK, but not what I expected."
4.0,"Nice soft cotton and great detail!<br />Well crafted product, will order again."
4.0,"Nice purse.  Big and roomy.  The blue is a bit darker than in the picture though.  I was trying to match a top I have and thought I found the perfect color...oops...a bit off, but it should still work out ok.  Overall, I like the purse very much.  Good price too.  Can't go wrong if you like a roomy purse.  A like the zippered pocket on the back of the purse also.  Nice this style is available in a lot of colors.  I would recommend this purse to anyone thinking about buying it."
4.0,Material different than what I hoped for. They don’t wash up as I had hope for also. Look nice
4.0,"We had to loosen the whole strap for it to fit my 9-year-old, so be aware it might be a tight fit. He loves it, it's very nice."
4.0,My wife likes the design and material.
4.0,"Very pretty. I'm short and it's really long on me, but I kind of expected that with a one size fits all peice."
4.0,This was a great buy love the comfort but a little snug around the mid section I was going off users reviews that they fit to size and the fit is actually off by few inches for my body type I normally wear a xl but if get this agian I get a 2xl for a little extra fit. I wear this also over my Sweat neoprene tanks hides the bulk a bit lol
4.0,Really nice material and fit
4.0,"I do wish there was some shading on the skull, but I otherwise totally love this necklace. It's well made."
4.0,Nice for the price. I would have kept if my boobs were smaller. It made the front of the dress fit weird having larger boobs. I liked the dress overall but the dress under-part could have been a better quality
4.0,"For an inexpensive watch, this is a very good buy (so far). It keeps time accurately and I like the clean, graceful, easy-to-read face."
4.0,"Dress is wonderful! The area under the arms is a tad large, but the rest of the dress fits perfectly, so don't size down. It would be really simple to take in at the side seams if you're skilled in that, but its not so large as to be necessary, and it looks wonderful! I have only tried it on, because its for Easter, but I'm really excited for it!"
4.0,"The John Deere hat is really cute, but is huge. I found this one that said infant, but didn't give any details on 3-6m, 6-12m, etc. Come to find out this hat is a 6-12m which is a very large range in size. My little guy couldn't even see it was so big. Eventually he will grow into it, but know it does run on the bigger side of the sizing spectrum."
4.0,"Fit was a bit tight and short, but it was ok for what I needed it for."
4.0,"It was to replace my old one. I like it has a pocket on it..However, It could of been a little bit wider."
4.0,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband how often works outdoors in the winter.  The hat itself fits well and looks great.  As far as the bluetooth features go - it was very simple to connect to an iPhone.  When we attempted a phone call using the hat it wasn't very easy to hear each other and the call cut out early.  It works very well to listen to music though.  Overall he is happy with it and excited to use it to listen to music while working/shoveling but not for work calls.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"I love the dress.  The quality is good for the price.  It is not a heavy or thick sweater material.  I would definitely purchase this dress again.  I am a size 8/10 (38.5, 31, 42) and purchased an XL.  It was lose where desired and fit where desired; not too tight."
4.0,"My daughter enjoys this and it looks great on her.  She does not like that the flannel is not stretchy, but overall it looks and feelsgood."
4.0,"This skirt is very cute, super stretchy, and actually mini. I am 5'2"" and a plus size 14 (not a misses 14)-38"" waist, and I actually sized down to an XL so it'd be too small and I could use it for my grommet project. Well, its so stretchy, it actually fit great! I still kept this size for the project, but had I kept it just to wear I would have gotten the XXL. Though if you like your clothes skin tight, don't be afraid to size down. The length is awesome, I never can trust a mini skirt to be an actual mini skirt, but this one is perfect. I will say that the material is a little thin, not see through or anything, just a little thinner than some other denim skirts I've had, but this one is not breaking the bank, and of course the pay off is the awesome stretch it has which makes it so comfy. Thinking about buying another in a lighter shade to tie dye, I'm just so pleased by the fit."
4.0,"Beauty, but see through"
4.0,"I have been looking for the perfect pair of pink shorts and it looks like I finally found them.<br /><br />I have these in the petal color, and made the mistake of buying my normal size 12. as I always wash my items before wearing they shrunk. Sorry for me. I will order the 14.<br /><br />There is just enough stretch in the material to fit you just as you want it to. Not too tight on the leg and perfect length for big legs like mine.<br /><br />I will be ordering in all the colors so i can have them just in case."
4.0,"To call this a mini dress is false!  It is a slightly long shirt, short tunic.  If you want to show everything off wear this without anything else!  But I love it as a top!"
4.0,This bag is great. It has lots of pockets. You can put many things in this bag. It can be used different ways.The only reason I took off a star is because it would be great if a bit bigger took it to school note book was too wide to fit bag comfortably. Actually might buy one for my son it's a good gym bag
4.0,This is a great buy plenty for your money
4.0,"Very comfortable leggings but no compression on the legs or stomach. I like them though, a lot."
4.0,Kinda makes screens look 3d
4.0,"Really high quality, only thing is I have a wide face and they’re a little smaller than I’d like but still fine for driving as long as no one sees me lol!"
4.0,"These will be a good back up pair of glasses. The color is slightly different in person (less blue more green). Overall, for the price they are a good buy."
4.0,"Ordered a medium, either the fit is a little small or it shrunk a bit after washing. Great shirt though for a Doctor Who fan! Will order again in larger size."
4.0,"Color, material, and quality was above average."
4.0,ave it to my 12 yr old
4.0,"These seem like nice arm sleeves. However, I couldn't get them past my forearm, so I'm not sure. The Amazon description says &#34;Men's&#34; L/XL. I figured that was due to strechyness, they are not (a little, but not comparable to spandex). The labeling on the product says &#34;Unisex&#34;. So, I'm guessing that it's a men's large and a women's x-large. If that's your size, they do seem nice."
4.0,"Surprised how good this pair of shorts are made. Nice elastic material for full range of movement, airflow and  comfort  with a drawstring waist.  I got a large based off the product reviews of it running larger, but wished I went with my gut instinct of getting an XL. While the large is still very comfortable for a 190# guy like me, it does feel tailored  and somewhat limiting.<br /><br />Great materials and simple design with comfort in mind.<br />Sizing chart definitely needed."
4.0,"Durable, but somewhat heavy."
4.0,"Given as a gift.  Let you know more when we know more, but he opened the package & about came unglued with joy. Only comments so far have been, &#34;better quality than the shirt he bought at Disney theme park&#34; and &#34;better design of pattern/graphics&#34; than same shirt mentioned earlier. Hasn't been washed yet.  Only warn once, so that's all I can honestly tell you at this point"
4.0,"This coat is good quality, but it’s too big for me.  I got a Medium, which is my usual coat size.  I’m 5’3” and 120 lbs.  The shoulders’ width on this coat is 20.5 inches, the sleeves are 21.5 inches long, and shoulder to hem is 36 inches long.  I like the fabric.  It reminds me of Western Native-American blankets but the stripes are in black, gold, white, and gray.  The fabric is 65% polyester, 30% acrylic, and 5% viscose.  The front is all snap buttons with a slight turtle neck feature.  Good for windy days.  There are two front pockets, and the sleeves are accented with an extra band of material. The description says Hoodie, but there’s no hood.<br /><br />I gave it one fewer star, because the lining is staticky.  The bottom line is: Even though it was too big for me, I think it’s a very nice-looking coat.  Use the measurements I gave or hopefully they’ll have a table of measurements."
4.0,"I received a sie XL (11-14Y) and when I got the tights, they look so small. I had my 7 year old step daughter try them on (she wears a size 6 (small) and was able to fit these perfectly. I'm not sure how much stretch they would have, but they look way too small for a 11-14 year old to fit. However, they were really thick and the color didn't look faded. But i would say, be weary of the sizing because I think that it is way off."
4.0,Pretty dress but the zipper on mine does does not close it's seem and I will need to get fixed but this dress it very cool
4.0,"I liked the pajamas very much, except why manufacturers think everyone is 5'11"". So now I have to have the bottoms shortened at added expense."
4.0,Like the idea but the ring is too thick for some of my keys which fit on a normal loop.
4.0,"I loved the style and the poly/cotton for easy care but it was too snug in bodice, even tight in underarms so I will return. I could buy larger size but since the bow is overly large and only really ties off to the side, it may not be as figuring for my body shape as I'd hoped."
4.0,"Good quality and satisfied with product, however had to re-order a lager size.  Short in the crotch"
4.0,"I've only had this a few days but used it quite a bit (we're having a cold snap!) and it's handy and versatile. I like that the neck part is long, so you can either bunch it up like in the picture or tuck the bottom under the collar of your coat and zip your coat up to keep your neck extra cozy.  I was hoping the neck piece could be slipped over my nose easily, but with the hood up if just doesn't work well. You CAN, but if the hood is up it makes it bulge out or fall off unless you scrunch up the draw chords (which I think makes your face look like it's poking out out a sphincter). I like that I can flip the hood back and just use the neck part, then just slip the hood back on if my ears get cold - saves me having to stop what I'm doing and look for a hat.<br />It's of medium quality construction (fine for the price) and very useful for the right weather conditions. It's warm unless there's wind, which seems to cut through it pretty easy and chill my ears. But that also lets the air move so my head doesn't sweat or get over-hot,  which is nice. Definitely not the thing for super cold (below 20F) weather or if there's a chilly wind.  The faux fur is pretty soft and feels nice, and lines the entire hood and neck (not just around the face like many hoods) which I like.... even though it's not enough to keep the wind out, it does feel nice to wear. It's snug on me and I have a small head for an adult. It'd be cuter if the hood were a little looser. Would be cozy on a kid - definitely not for anyone with a big head.<br /><br />Overall a fine buy for the money, but it's something I'll use while working outside on cold but not very windy days - I'll definitely choose something else for around town."
4.0,"La tela es muy fresca, el diseño es lindo"
4.0,Style more baseballish in person. Baseball is lame. Decent cheapos though.
4.0,Can't go wrong for the money!
4.0,I really like this simple necklace. It’s very versatile and I receive many compliments. The chain is a great length (long!) and has held up over a few months wear. Would recommend
4.0,It fits a little bigger than the actual size
4.0,It's a bit more light weight than a heavy winter coat but is the cutest most comfortable coat.
4.0,Love the weight of these leggings. I am not a fan of the elastic in the waist band.
4.0,They were nice. Little small.
4.0,"Amazon suggested I order a L, which is what I usually wear. The size chart was not helpful. Based on other reviews, I ordered an XL (Sleeveless version). I tried it on, it was slightly snug getting it over my hips, at the time I was glad I didn't get the L. Once zipped up it fits great. It's a little roomy on the top, but I'd rather have that than too snug. It's a super cute set."
4.0,Size up one.
4.0,The material is a little thin but over all good
4.0,"A little bigger than expected, probably won't fit baby until about 6 months. Cute, great product other than sizing."
4.0,Very cute! A little heavier material than I thought it would be but love it!
4.0,"Nice watch but be careful, the image can fools you, the clock is big, really big, not suitable for thiny wrists."
4.0,Very pretty and soft.  I love it great quality for the price.
4.0,"Good quality.  Tends to shrink alittle in cold wash, but returns to proper size when put on."
4.0,Love the bag! Bigger than I thought it would be but I'm keeping it.
4.0,"This is top quality leather that is beautiful. However, after six months one of the pins that holds the band in place just snapped, causing my watch to fall off. This therefore impacted the overall quality rating. That being said. the customer service is 5 stars. They immediately replaced the band!"
4.0,"Love the soft material, good quality graphics and I get a compliment EVERY time I wear it. Only dislike is that it isn’t a women’s shirt. The “boyfriend fit” is just a men’s boxy square skinny fit shirt size. I found the XL to fit like a men’s LG. Definitely look at measurements (measure your fav tee to compare?) I cut it up. Classic movie, glad I bought it."
4.0,I love the dress. A bit too large. I am going to return it for a smaller size.
4.0,"Beautiful purse if like firm purses instead of soft. No matching wallets in the purse colors. Company doesn't carry a line of wallets, colors are impossible for exact match."
4.0,"Doesn't actually look like what it is in the picture. Instead it has two dragon heads out of the sides, which is still awesome but not what is on the picture. I got this for my boyfriend and he still loved it. :) so four stars it is :)"
4.0,Cute dress.  I ordered my usual size of XL and it fit as expected. I ordered another color selection because I was pleased with this one.
4.0,"Ours came with no flaws. The chain was in good shape and it is also very thin. Although the necklace looks cheap, it seems well made. It is very pretty and looks very pretty on my wife.<br /><br />Don't let your kids get a hold of this necklace. I'm pretty sure the necklace would break within minutes.<br /><br />My wife did she will wear it daily. We will find out if it is real or fake."
4.0,"It's a mustard color wallet. I loved everything about the way it looks. However, the card slots are smaller than the norm. it can be annoying when you're at the register struggling to get you card out. On the plus side, your cards will never accidentally fall out of you wallet."
4.0,Nice jacket but way too small!! I wear a 14 and I bought the largest size they had and I could barely even get the sleeves on.
4.0,Love everything about these shoes but the colors.
4.0,I love the design but it just didn't fit me right. It didn't look flattering for my body shape.
4.0,Very satisfied. Comfy and flattering.
4.0,"Very good detail, only thing wrong was it was slightly bent upon arriving."
4.0,Love this cute outfit.
4.0,"Awesome fabric, good quality."
4.0,"These earrings are stylish and beautiful and pretty well made. Obviously, given the price, they are not real silver... but if you love them, I say go for it. I was thinking they would be great for tween birthday party favors!"
4.0,"I purchased a size large and it fits pretty loose. I washed it once hoping it would shrink but it did not. In my opinion this is an extra large. Besides that, the shirt is great quality."
4.0,I liked the tee a lot.  I will probably purchase a few more.  It was a perfect fit.  Glad I purchased.
4.0,"I ordered a size up, and the sides of my boobs were still trying to escape a little bit as well as the top, so order a size up at least or two sizes. It was fairly easy to get on, but thats because i choose to put it over my head instead of undoing the clasps. I would not recommend it for high activity if you are large chested, as soon as I put it on I jumped up and down and sure enough they still bounced but not nearly as much as with a normal bra. This is my first sports bra so i dont have much to compare it to, but I would say overall its pretty good. And its super cute."
4.0,Wondeful and durable material but the sleeves kept rolling up because it was somewhat tight on me.
4.0,Not as thick on the bottom as my other Balega running sock.  It's also designed differently on top to provide more ventilation and motion.  I like the crew which is higher up and keep me warmer when running in cold weather.  Nice sock.
4.0,Nice pair but little blue tints.  I enjoy them and would buy again for the price.
4.0,Fits a bit snug but so sexy it's all worth it.<br />Disappointed with shipping method box had no top and the rest of the box was crushed
4.0,This item i bought as gift for my mother and she loved it which means she loves it came as expected as well great gift
4.0,Wore this to Drai's in Las Vegas. It fit really cute but be sure to get nipple pasties because the material is on the thin side.
4.0,These are great love them... but having the brand name written so huge is a little off putting. (see photo)  A little more subtlety would be awesome.
4.0,It was as described - and a nice length and fit all over.  fabric is comfortable and washing is a breeze.
4.0,Cute dress I think it will work for Halloween party on my Cruise.
4.0,Have 4 yr old 35lbs and this was a bought 5t and it just barely fit I would definitely size up
4.0,I’ve owned 6 havaiannas and I loved them but I was quite surprised about the strap of this one being very loose as shown on the picture attached. This is something unusual.
4.0,"Nice product. I ordered one in black for me and one in pink for my daughter. The quality is good and they arrived in a timely manner. The clear touch screen allowing one to use a phone while it is in the purse works, despite what other reviews said. You have to press a bit hard but both my daughter and I were able to use the phones while in our purses. The reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is that the purse is bigger and heavier than I thought it would be. I was hoping for something slimmer and a bit lighter. However, it fit my 6+ I-phone well on the phone side and the other compartment holds credit cards, money, and could fit lipstick or a compact and a keys. I was really looking for something that held the phone plus one credit card and a little money--so slimmer. But it is a good product and we kept both."
4.0,"These slippers are so cute! My niece loves them!! The only thing is the sizing is confusing. She’s 2 and I thought getting the toddler size would be a little big with room to grow, but they’re just right and a bit snug at the toes so she’s going to outgrow them fast."
4.0,"Strange...the blue one broke the very first day we got it.  The rest are okay. Bummer because out of the 4, blue is the one we wanted the most.  My son thought it was fake when it broke so he cut it up to look for the mud LOL - it's legit."
4.0,Great suit for lap swimming.  Runs small so order one size up.
4.0,I love these but the clasps are a little flimsy. They were easily bent out of shape so that they dont close properly on one of them. They still work and i wear them but i feel like its a matter of time until the clasp fully breaks off.
4.0,"Just a tad bit shorter than I thought it would be, but I like it."
4.0,"Great belts, perfect fit"
4.0,"This hat fitted very well, and the material was of good quality also. Recommended for the winter and for the holidays coming up."
4.0,"Okay, so I was not blessed with a nice round tight bottom.  I'm about as straight backed as they come.  Unfortunately, it runs in my family.  I was excited to try this butt lifting underwear.  They are not itchy or extremely tight, they are actually quite comfortable.  They have a soft waistband and 'legs' in them with a cotton crotch.  The legs also have a bit of a band to keep them from riding up.  I am ecstatic to say they do fool they eye.  They push your bottom up a bit and squeeze it together some to give the illusion of a fuller bottom.  They are not noticeable, even under sweatpants.  I wouldn't want anyone to know my secret.  I am interested in finding any way to make my self look and feel better.  This is one great step in the right direction.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,nice but a littletoo tight.
4.0,This really does help.  I had to practice using it and follow the illustration.  If you do that it works
4.0,Juniors but small for juniors. Order up two.
4.0,These are very cute light weight earrings that I bought for my grand daughters for St. Patricks Day. I also bought them the matching necklace. It made for a nice set.
4.0,"Quality is not best. Material is thin,but great design and good price : ))"
4.0,"I ordered 2 sizes bigger than my children wear in hopes they would be able to wear it awhile. The hoodies fit as if I bought their exact sizes.<br />Unfortunate cause they won't be able to wear them for a long time, but my kids refuse to wait for a replacement so we're just going to keep these."
4.0,Beautiful wrap nice and stretchy & they stay in place I wear a wig gripper under mines for security! The  print is just as gorgeous just not exactly like the photo!! But I will definitely be buying more!
4.0,"Nice top. But a tight fit, definitely order a size or 2 larger than what you wear. Runs small. Other than the size issue it's a nice top."
4.0,One of the backs didn’t work. Three out of four pins were usable. Thank God I had another back from another pin.
4.0,"cool looking watch, works great, however the blue on the band rubs off VERY easily. other than that, great buy!"
4.0,It was a little too long for me but I’m short 5’3 about 106 lbs it was gorgeous and comfortable and not hard to put on❤️
4.0,Wish these had a higher rise as they may roll down after a while. Love the pockets. With these shorts I no longer hesitate to wear a dress to theme parks or outdoor events and I get to leave my purse at home!
4.0,"It's really just a nice looking jacket, that's it ... Very cheap material but I'll still wear"
4.0,"Pretty, looks a bit chunkier in person and sometimes the bottom flower does not hang flat it will turn around backwards. A bit pricey for the product."
4.0,They fit well. but are a bit short. The shortness is okay because I usually wear boots so no one can see them. I love the colors and design of them. Overall I am happy with them.
4.0,Well got em fast enough. They look good. Have to wait for comfort and durability i would prefer them to be a touch bigger but what are ya gonna do? They certainly draw att
4.0,"This dress is very soft, made of 65% polyester, 35% cotton. I'm a true medium but ordered a large to have a very loose fit on super hot days. I like the 2 pockets. The measurements for Large are: bust 42&#34;, hips 43&#34;, length from centre back to hem 33&#34;. The length is a bit too short for an older woman but will be ok to wear around the house. It would be a cozy cover up too."
4.0,"Bought these for my entire family, but the fit is too tight for adults.<br />They are good for young kids.<br />They are very cute though."
4.0,"Good water shoe/sock. Light weight, cool pattern, got tons of compliments. Thanks"
4.0,These pants are super comfortable and they fit nicely. I am 5‘2“ and 137 pounds. I ordered a size medium and they fit me perfectly. The only problem is that the crotch is either really low or the waist comes up super high if you have a short torso. But it’s still cute just a little weird.
4.0,I bought this to wear over my bathing suit while on a cruise this summer...Fits as expected
4.0,"I like the dress, but it is a little thin to be worn on its own. You have to layer it with leggings and a sweater to stay warm. Minor inconvenience but overall nice color and soft material."
4.0,"These are a great size, but the post might be too short for some, I have thicker ear lobes and very little wiggle room left. The marbling on them is perfect, but like others have said, the little black band falls off easily, and they can be a pain to screw in. Overall I will be buying again and the shipment came within a few days!<br /><br />UPDATE: After about 1 month of daily wear, one of them won't tighten properly, and it just spins and spins. Sooooo, I guess I'll be buying another pair.  For that, I am taking off a star. :("
4.0,Tried them out in blazing mid day sun and they work gangbusters. Fit fine. Came in nice package with cleaning cloth and a clip to keep them handy on your car/truck visor. Arrived on time. Happy camper here. No complaino. Would buy again.
4.0,Did shrink a little
4.0,"wife liked them, looked good"
4.0,Really Cute and material is nice.
4.0,I purchased 4 hats all large/extra and they are just a little too small. What do you suggest i do..thank you. But the quality is good.
4.0,The top fits as expected and is good quality material. The shoulders fall appropriately and looks good. 4 star rating overall. its a bit see through but thats negligible.
4.0,"Love the look, only thing is it is a bit see though"
4.0,"I love it ,my daughter is so happy"
4.0,I bought this for my bf for work. It is really helping to smooth-en his calluses on his fingers. Def a good buy! :)
4.0,Love it brry Beautiful watch
4.0,"I loved this dress.  It arrived on time according to my shipment date. Since I read other reviews stating that the dress was long, I wore 4 inch heels and the dress fell perfectly.  I'm 5'5.  I bought the dress in white but I was glad that it was more an ivory color once it arrived.  The only reason this review is a 4 is because my local cleaners told me that I can only spot clean the dress because the bead work is glued on, not sewed.  I was instructed to &#34;try not to get the dress dirty because it will be more expensive to clean.&#34;  😐.  But I still looked fabulous in the dress, hence 4 stars!"
4.0,Interesting bracelet. I like it a lot.
4.0,I'm short and the length was good
4.0,Fo for them!!! These are very alike to the ones I saw in Disneyland!! I think they are from there!! They ran out of them and had to order online. They light beautifully and arrived super fast. Loved the on/off button and how easy is to use them. Just where a little opaque and a tiny scratch. I'm super excited about using them!!! :D
4.0,Runs a small.
4.0,"It was nice. It worked for the costume party I bought it for, but then I put it in the washer and it fell apart. My bad..."
4.0,As good as advertised. Prefect fit to my older frames I have from my tour in Afghanistan.
4.0,Works on some cactus. That really good if you work on large cactus. Needs better protection
4.0,"I bought medium fits like a medium should but a little weird on top,  I'll be fighting so my bra doesn't show but overall I like it."
4.0,"Just a little small, quite comfy"
4.0,"Bought this robe for travel however I'm 5'3"" so I should have known it would be long, like to my ankles. The length isn't so much a problem because I decided to keep it for home.  It is much weightier than expected and the real reason I won't use it for travel. It's a nice thickness, didn't want some terry or brushed or chenille fabric. It's flowy and has 3/4 sleeves which I really like. I got the animal print pattern. Hubs has complimented each time I wear it which tells I need to up my leisure game!"
4.0,Timeson tops are always so soft and comfortable but I am disappointed in the color of this one. Listed as &#34;wine&#34; it is more a reddish brown so just be aware that this top may not match your color expectations (usually they do with Timeson)
4.0,I love the fit of these dress pants.  I just exchanged for a size down because they are too big in weiste. I wear a 10-12(xl) and they were too big so going down 1 size.
4.0,"I liked my costume. Came with skirt, shirt, and a 63194 neck tatoo. Mine was kinda big but still usable. Shirt is sort of see-through, but fine with a tank top. I recvomend."
4.0,Pretty but a little chunky
4.0,Pretty and a little bit heavy ... but the red one came in orange 😩 so disappointed I was waiting for the red one 😭😭
4.0,Small pad of paper - check the dimensions...I did not
4.0,"I brought a large , I suggest to buy bigger size"
4.0,Found this from a review of runners world on Male running shorts. Definitely like having more room around the crotch as it feels like I have more support. One star off since it still rides up my inner thigh more then other running shorts I have. Like the deep pockets though.
4.0,"The description does not specify that the yellow lens pair is NOT POLARIZED. The darker lenses, gray and brown are polarized. Otherwise, these are a good product."
4.0,"Good product, a little bit flimsy. I bent the first one just trying to clip it into place."
4.0,Looks and fits great! On time delivery.
4.0,This is a great light jacket especially if expecting wind/rain. It won't keep you too warm under 40 degrees.
4.0,"It's pretty, but small. I have to use it as a pinky ring."
4.0,"I am so old fashioned I look not only at how cute, but how long will it last.  I have a limited budget and I have to slip in a few things here and there for me.  This is very cute, but, it will not last long.  The fabric is not strong.  It is thin, and will wear out soon.  The look is fine.  The short sleeve is good for summer and can go under a big shirt or jacket for fall.  Too thin for cooler weather, but the white lace makes it a spring - summer item.  If it were made with a better cotton, I would love it forever.  It is awful when things wear out too soon."
4.0,Very beautiful with any outfit
4.0,Bought for my daughter - she is typically a large or XL - we got this in a 42 and it fit great and looks great on her.  Very flattering for larger women/girls.
4.0,material feels like a graduation gown. Meh. Quality not worth.
4.0,I loved the style of these studs. I always prefer backs that screw on. I just wish the barbell part was a little longer but that's just because I have thick ears.
4.0,Helps me to have a good nights rest. It blocks out the light in the room and the ear plugs help reduce noises in my bed room.
4.0,Very flattering but sheer so a tank underneath is necessary. Usually wear a l or xl in shirts went with a 3x and it fits perfectly.
4.0,I would like it better if it polished more efficiently
4.0,"It's a beautiful piece for the price, a bit small, but good size anyway. Bought it regular price for $6, next day went up to $9, the next $11... I was considering buying another as a gift, but I don't want to pay double the price I paid 2 days ago."
4.0,"The pendant is beautiful and the perfect size. The chain is on the cheaper side but hey, came with a chain. They dont show in the picture that the pendant is hollow, so it weighs close to nothing which I guess can be a nice thing. Very comfortable against the skin. My only issue is that I cant find a 925 stamp on the pendant itself.. there are stamps on the chain and the connector on the pendant but nothing on the pendant itself, so that is a little concerning to me. Other than that I wear it everyday and I love the design"
4.0,when i first opened these i was in love - the shape and color was perfect! unfortunately they are indeed $7 sunglasses and are made that way - one of the legs fell off within the week. but superglue and care has kept them together fine. i'd recommend them if you just want some cheap cute sunglasses
4.0,"so it's your most basic tie bar. i just recently got a new job where the uniform is a suit and tie, and i love wearing tie bars because it keeps my tie straight and presentable.<br /><br />however i am also good at loosing tie bars and for the most part they are quite expensive.<br /><br />so for the price of this tie bar it does exactly what its supposed to do. keeps your tie in place and looks nice doing it.<br /><br />the plating is shiny and catches the eye, without looking too gaudy.<br /><br />the inside catch is jagged so it stays place on the shirt, the only fear i have is that it may tear the inside of my shirt up but it hasnt yet.<br /><br />overall if you are looking for a cheap good looking tie bar, look no further"
4.0,The details on it is so nice it brings out the vintage in it.. It's a must to have h
4.0,"I received my order late, but they are super soft and fit based on size.  My only complaint is that they are to thin in my opinion.  If you are looking for super comfy leggings that are nice and light weight these are for you!"
4.0,"Wearing well after 2-3 months. Comfortable with the built in waist elastic and fits as expected. Haven't had the experience of sliding in or out of an M1A1 tank, but looks like they would hold up. The weave pattern of the fabric looks to be tear resistant, but so far not had occasion to test this..."
4.0,"Never worn the bottoms because they are extremely cheeky and not my thing, but the top is cute and comfortable. Size up one for the bottoms unless you want them to become a permanent part of you."
4.0,I love the wallet very much and it looks great! But it's pretty small especially if you have alot of credit cards or cards in general. I personally dont carry to many and had to leave alot home just because of the size so if you're looking for something spacious i do not recommend this one
4.0,"I loved this bag, but it simply wasn't large enough for my continental style zip wallet, phone, sunglasses and reading glasses.  I felt sad sending it back, but it just didn't work for me.  If you carry very small items, you will love it--also it was the featured brand in Schipol airport in The Netherlands, which is a huge quality endorsement!"
4.0,I purchased this set to use until I get big enough for maternity pants.  They are easy to use and give me up to an extra 3 inches wiggle room.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter for Easter. It is a perfect fit. It has pockets, which I did not know. That is an added bonus. It looks really nice on her. You will love it."
4.0,This is a beautiful piece. It's delicacy and uniqueness will convey the most special and custom effect when worn. I ordered for my wife's birthday and it came nicely packaged as well and she was absolutely in love with it. The packaging could be better though to protect the item from damage in transit.
4.0,"I'm on the bigger side, usually wearing a 2-3X on most US sizes.  This actually fits similar to a comfortable shirt.  I would personally still wear shorts or pants with this cover up, but it is lighter and more comfortable than wearing a large thick cotton shirt to the beach.<br />It also came with a fun bracelet.  I like this cover-up very much, but at 5&#34;6' I'm a little tall to be wearing it out in public without something covering my lower half.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
4.0,Good fit with the exception that the sleeves are a tad too long<br /> I love the feel and quality of the material
4.0,Nice dress fits good I’m 5’2 158 ordered M fits well
4.0,This body piercing kit was a gift for a friend. She said it had everything she could possibly need for her piercings. This kit has multiple sizes and designs for each type of piercing.  There are multiples of each size. Many different colors and themes to choose from. This kit comes with a handy storage container which will hold all 110 pieces and then some. It's nice to be organized and trendy at the same time. Each small compartment will hold jewlery in place when on the go and keeps the jewelry organized and clean at the same time.
4.0,"A bit tight on the nose and the serrated part that sits on nose needs to be filed down for comfort, but the price is right."
4.0,They were a lil snug in chest area
4.0,A comfortable band. It was not the exact color I was expecting but I still like it!
4.0,They came quickly like they said they would. The down fall to them is they do look cheap
4.0,Super comfy shirts. Just wish they washed well. But they are perfect for work.
4.0,Exceeded expectations. Great color and quality. The color blue is really like the teal in the picture
4.0,"Well made, nicely trimmed. The pictures shown are accurate. Exactly what I needed."
4.0,"I really really like these socks, wish they were a bit bigger though. I have slim legs and these felt super tight."
4.0,"This is not thick or thin. It is not high quality or low quality, It's not a great value, it's not a poor value. It IS reliably the same from year to year. Runs a little small. Prices different based on color."
4.0,Little big but made well
4.0,"Overalls are very cute, however, the button holes on the sides of waist were not open. I had to use my ripper and open them. Also, the hardware for the shoulder straps came in a plastic bag. Had to put that on myself."
4.0,I like the shoes. I dislike that they don’t offer sizes by the half after size 11 . I wear 11.5. But overall the shoes were good
4.0,Liked bright color
4.0,this product was used to stretch my husband's new stetson
4.0,"The socks are really nice, but they are too small. It would cost more to  return them than they are worth. I'll find someone to give them to. addendum to my review: Madeline at Fiorelle Boutique saw my review and responded very quickly. Seems there was a shipment to them that was wrongly sized,  they are sending me two pair in my correct size. I'm so happy, I really like these and was disappointed when I couldn't use them. I'll change the Product fit box once they arrive and I try them on."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c99c59a5c96e185d5acd7fcc9d38727d]]This 3 pack of Lace Bralettes is kind of combination between a bra and sports bra in my opinion. They are all lace including the back. The back is a sports bra style and there are no hooks. The shoulder straps are lace as well and have some elasticity to them. The straps are not adjustable. The cup area is lined on the underside with a cotton material. That is the only &quot;padding&quot; if you even want to call it that. It's not thicker like padding so I would say it a lining. These do have underwire in them.<br /><br />These are a very pretty style and have a nice look when on. My daughter wears a 38C bra and I ordered the XL for her and they fit her around the back and in the cup area. The shoulder straps worked good for her too and do not slide down on her. Over many times of wearing, I could see that the straps may possible stretch out but if that happens I will be sure to update this for you to let you know.<br /><br />Seeing how these looked on her and being a C cup, I don't think these would fit a larger size breast. These don't have much support even though they are underwire. I think it's due to them being all lace. My daughter said they are comfortable but she almost feels like when she bends over she's gonna slip out of the cup area.<br /><br />The only issue I noticed with these as far as quality goes is the straps. There are some threads/fuzz on the side of all the straps (I show this in my video). I think it's just because of them being lace because it's not like they are falling apart or unraveling or anything. Overall, they are a pretty style and a decent quality. Definitely not a VS quality but I wasn't expecting that when I ordered them.<br />I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,"A nice scarf. Only issues are that it needs to be washed before 1st wear (stiff, wrinkles, etc... ) and that the colors are quite a bit darker than the image here. The dark blues are navy blue in reality. Those gray/turquoise splotches are much more blue/gray.<br /><br />Otherwise, however, 4 stars. It is exactly what it claims. A nice, large, well made scarf."
4.0,Great skip. Just right for making my daughter's pageant dress hang perfectly.  This slip smells horribly though. I hope the smell will dissipate with a good airing our.
4.0,"I liked the fabric and cotton touch. It is lightly stretchy in 4 ways adjusting easily to the body. It is a masculine polo shirt, but I am a female and liked it for myself.  There is no agreement with the labels, the one sewn is XL, the paper kind is L, but I am a size M, in the female chart and it fits well with some extra room on the sides and length of sleeves. It's a long shirt, body length is 28"", sleeves 25"".  The only thing I didn't particularly like was the label in the back of the neck that bothers my skin there, an easy fix. A great piece for any casual occasion and especially a morning walk."
4.0,"Doesn't squeeze the ear, i wished they were larger though."
4.0,great shirt  well made but a size too small  Wonderful customer service!  Would always order from them
4.0,"I received Lots of compliments! I rated it a 4star, just because it's a little &#34;puffy&#34; for my taste. The material and colors are very nice. Very comfortable to wear all day!"
4.0,"This dress is lovely but runs very large. It does shrink a size in the wash, but even then is quite large. I am 5’3” and around 135 lbs. I purchased the medium after reading about the shrinking. It was a tent! After washing it is much better, but still a very loose fit."
4.0,Perfect fit. The waist band did roll over instead of staying in place.
4.0,"Soft, fluffy, and colorful. My daughter likes to keep the fuzzy side on the inside. The (outer) nylon is not as thick or reinforced as I expected. I worry it might be susceptible to rips or snags if she's not careful. Also, do not expect this to be a super warm winter coat. Better worn in early spring or late fall jacket. Daughter says it's comfortable and soft!"
4.0,I ordered a 31 and it the fit is a smidge to tight but with a little breaking it in for a couple days around the house it fits the way it's supposed to.
4.0,"Very durable, I bought this as a gift and it has stood up many a beating."
4.0,"Very pretty color and overall good fit. It's a heavy dress. I wish it were a little shorter and fitted in the waist. I will get it tailored, but for the price it's to be expected to need a little tweaking."
4.0,So cute! Love how lightweight and flowy it is! Perfect for Spring to summer transition.
4.0,"It is larger than I imagined, but great when I take my granddaughters to the pool. Everything fits in one bag-towels, snacks, sunscreen, pool toys, etc."
4.0,It's cute. It seems a little big. I am not sure if I needed smaller because of the color but it's still a cute jacket.
4.0,Cute. Fit well. Good for the price
4.0,"It was relatively cheap yet fit well and completed my hubby's costume. If someone were to wear a hat like this on a regular basis, I'd probably go for a tad more quality like a Kangol hat. This was not poor quality or cheap like one you'd get with a Halloween costume, it just isn't &#34;high&#34; quality"
4.0,"I wear a size 10 so if you have feet later than this, like if you wear a size 11 sometimes, these are a pass for you.  Because while these were really comfortable, I felt they were really stretching on my feet.  So, my mother who wears an 11.5 would hate these because they would be pulling on her feet.<br /><br />However, the fabric of the Hissox Men's Women's Cotton Ankle Low Cut Casual Socks is extremely soft and weave is kind of loose so they are breathable. The fabric is also thin, but ""cushion-y"" at the same time.  The light grey is a nice color.  Too bad these didn't come in a pack or 3 or 6.  I wouldn't call these men's socks.  The wouldn't fit a man's foot.  Plus they are really thin and really would not hold to up wear in a man's shoe.  I like these better than the socks I typically buy at a fast-fashion big box store."
4.0,These athletic shorts dry quickly and allow for easy and free movement. My husband uses these when he works out. They wick away moisture pretty well and don't feel overly restrictive. The blue color is bright and bold and the length is good. They fit as expected.
4.0,It's nice. Pretty color. Thin fabric. Not much body.
4.0,"Product is cute, however, way too big."
4.0,"if you are caught between sizes this is a great belt, no complaints at all 32-34 waist, super comfortable to 38"" waist."
4.0,The nose was easy to adhere to my face and easy to breathe with it on. I could not keep the chin adhered to my face so I didn’t use it.
4.0,Super cute and vibrant color. The only reason I took one star away is it’s a bit see through. Great purchase for the price though. Made well.
4.0,"Smaller than I thought it would be, but it's cute and I need all the protection I can get."
4.0,It may be small for bigger hands and wrist. Mine supossed to be de G100BB-1AJF and i end receiving the G100BB-1ADR model. Box was a mess and it came late but at least the watch was in good condition.
4.0,"Overall beautiful dress, great for the summer it’s very light. Bottom skirt is somewhat see through but can be worn with shorts under. My daughter is 2.5 years and ordered the 3t-4t fits perfect! The top part is more of a light blue denim color then shown. Would buy different styles!"
4.0,It does smell pretty weird when 1sr opened. It seems to take about 30 minutes to soften up. I wash off the weird flavor and give the flavor water to my dog. But it really does taste pretty good in recipes.
4.0,"I LIKE THESE, BUT THEY ARE SSOOO THIN! i'M AFRAID i'M GOING TO BEND THEM WHILE PUTTING THEM ON. OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE STYLE, SIZE i LIKE."
4.0,THIS IS A NICE NECKLACE - I THOUGHT THE TOPAZ STONE AS PART OF THE BEE'S BODY - OOPS MY FAULT - BUT IT'S STILL A NICE NECKLACE - I LOVE BEES - SO THIS IS PERFECT
4.0,Love the color scheme. Great piece for everyday wear.
4.0,"I really Like the feel of the Fabric, it don't cling to your shape"
4.0,"Very pretty dress, but it runs small, I always buy a 3x dress,but this dress did not fit, I wish there was a 5x I would buy it again."
4.0,I like the. I wear them with my boots a.d short skirt cute
4.0,Cute and super comfy!! Wish it had pockets though. Still love it!!
4.0,They are decent for the price. They don’t tightening much but my daughter doesn’t seem to mind. They are a good quality for the price.
4.0,"I like the look through the glasses, polarized, but the lenses are too close together for my liking.  Nice looking on someone else perhaps.  I like the gold touch on the arm as well."
4.0,Stacking wood in 20 degree weather.
4.0,Love my new lil bag.
4.0,"I really like this band.  It was a tad confusing to get attached to my watch at first, but once it was on I really like it.  The only downfall is that with it being sweater and sweatshirt wearing season, it tends to get caught on the fabric of my shirts.  Other than that I love it, I also have it in rose gold.  Makes the watch look nice, especially when you add a face cover."
4.0,Arrived on time and fit well. The cups were a bit huge. I'm a A/B and the swimsuit top was made to fit someone C cup or larger.
4.0,"Loved the fabric feel, fit n color. Good find for so low price. But it is very sheer."
4.0,"The size is perfect and, the colors bright.  Good value."
4.0,"Thick fabric, but dress is very long. I can only wear with heels"
4.0,"The ring is solid built but the image on it can scratch off, so be careful to wear it when you aren't doing something that could scratch it. Was a great ring for the price and I was still happy I got it. Did not feel cheap at all."
4.0,"I'm glad that this came really quick but I could tell before I tried it on that it runs too big! Since I have bigger hips I like to get A-line dresses to highlight my curves. Got a medium since some of the reviews said it ran small. For me it ran big! The sizing says Small (4-6 US dress size) and Medium (6 dress size) so I ordered the medium since I am a 6 dress size. Oh well, I can just alter it.<br />The fabiric is nothing exciting. But I still love the design on it!"
4.0,"These ties are great! Good quality and exactly as described. I took off one star because even when they’re adjusted to the smallest neck size, they’re still too loose on my 4 year olds and my 6 year olds. So I took the elastic in with my sewing machine. But now they’re perfect!"
4.0,They seemed to be ok for me but my husband didn't care for them as he felt they didn't keep his feet warm.
4.0,"Very pretty summer dress. The material is not very soft though, but the quality is good."
4.0,This mask prevents my hearing aids from flying off and covers my nose and mouth well. The wire is a little heavy and uncomfortable for my nose. I would suggest using twist ties for a lighter wire. I appreciate that the masks are made in the USA and that delivery was so prompt. More colors please.
4.0,"Nice and dark shades. Possible quality issue... there is a small screw that holds logo to arm of shades. Mine arrived with one of the screws missing, which creates a rattle sound. I could easily return for exchange but the quality, look, feel and price make that small flaw tolerable. Would recommend."
4.0,Once I tied them up with my glasses sometimes The strap will come lose very easily. I would not recommend this.
4.0,The gloves fits well the quality is not quite as good as I thought
4.0,"Kind if small, but very stretchy. Not very long."
4.0,I loved the contrast of buffalo plaid against black and white polka dots!  I had more compliments on it than I’ve had in a long time.  No one had seen the two contrasting materials together and they loved it.  I can’t wait to wear it again!  It fits just as I expected and has held up fine.
4.0,Very pretty. A little bigger than expected. Guess I didn't read the specs! :-)
4.0,"I only wanted the keychain, but it cost as much as it would to buy the necklace with it. Wish they had a cheaper option for keychain only, to wear it as a necklace would look cheap, especially on a middle aged woman. However, the key chain was just as expected and it meant a lot to my step mom. It was packaged nicely in a box too."
4.0,I absolutely love the shirt! I'm normally a medium though and I had to order an extra large.
4.0,Just like the other one - but this on is better
4.0,Slightly larger in length but it wears well.
4.0,Needs more support for tightening. I LOVE the material and design!
4.0,"They are soft and fit well, but they don't stay on the backs of my feet very well."
4.0,The shoes are comfortable and loose fit. I only wished I would<br />have gotten 1 size bigger for the length
4.0,Bought for my 18 year old granddaughter and she loves it.
4.0,"Super cute, sexy casual dress. I can see why everyone is putting a knot in the front, the end of the dress on the sides are loose and comes out. I love how the strings aren't sewed into the dress so you can choose how much you want to reveal and customized it."
4.0,"Super value for these beautiful earrings, really interesting design!  Can wear these with everything."
4.0,Love the fit of these shorts
4.0,"Bad enough we have to mask so lets show some style.  Nylon like material is ok, not as comfortable as cotton.  Big selling poi t.  They come with filters that will eliminate some of the "" public nasties "" and a drop of essential oil makes it nice."
4.0,Definately fits like a medium but makes my chest look great so i am keeping it!  Material doesnt wrinkle either.
4.0,These pajamas are very cute and comfortable. The material is very soft and the design is stylish.
4.0,These work great in my shoes!
4.0,My wife love it! It is so cute.<br />Unfortunately it is a  little bigger than I expected.<br />It has an elastic back to keep it secure.<br />Cute flower and pretty green.<br />High quality.<br />It doesn't have any issue except the size.<br />I recommend
4.0,Cute option for a cover up. Very lightweight and comfortable
4.0,Great comfortable floats. Recline back a bit. Great for relaxing.
4.0,The hat was fun for a Mexican themed party. It was a great price but a little big.
4.0,"Nice look, trying with the t-shirt as model did"
4.0,"Comfortable, loose fit. Very lightweight. I'm 5'5"" 175lbs; Amazon suggested XL, which I'm keeping for hiking, but I'll reorder a Large for a better fit under a life jacket."
4.0,Green color wears off quick with repeated use. It was unusable after about a month
4.0,Love these bags except lately they tend to rip easily and the outside bag detaches right away. Didn't have these problems with my older bag.
4.0,Was a very pretty shemagh. Unfortunately I had to return it because the stitching was pulled out in a section half an inch wide which ran the length of it.
4.0,Good so far.  Not any issues.
4.0,It beautiful as described
4.0,Doesn't zip all the way up. But it is very warm and comfy.
4.0,Thought they'd be bigger but they are cute
4.0,Colour faded
4.0,Plastic but nice!
4.0,"The key-chain is exactly as depicted in the picture. The craftsmanship is great, the only reason for the 4 STARS is because of the price."
4.0,"This is a crazy nice belt, especially at under $20. The one drawback is that it's a little on the heavy side. I prefer a lighter belt myself but as someone with a unique talent for getting my belts snagged and torn on things I've quickly built an appreciation for the more heavy duty build of a this heavier leather. I haven't found the reversible feature to be at all useful, but this option doesn't impact normal use so I don't mind that it's there at all. Oh, and it came with a little tool for punching holes into belts. Again, not terribly useful for me but I thought it was kind of cool. I got curious as to how effective it was and put a deep circular dent into my wallet with a very small amount of effort. Always nice to have a potentially useful tool like that."
4.0,I love this loose jacket. It fits like the picture. I wish I could get more in other colors.
4.0,I LOVE MY CLUTCH ....
4.0,Just what I wanted. They are a little loose but I have narrow feet.
4.0,The watch is pretty but the battery was dead so now I need to find a battery for it.I hope it works.
4.0,"I used these to make bracelets for a son, moon, and stars baby shower.  They were the perfect size for the string bracelet, but within 2-3 weeks of wearing the bracelet the silver polish starts to fade around the tips."
4.0,This was so cute I want to buy more. It fit just about as I expected. Love it
4.0,"It’s a ok undershirt. Though, I will say it runs small, it’s a little shorter than I’d like (not made for someone with a long torso), and the straps are bra strap material just not as supportive. Bright side, the fabric is thick and feels nice and the front looks nice."
4.0,"Surprisingly great dress.  Didn't have high expectations given the price but its really an attractive classic dress.  Unfortunately its not made well and likely wont last long, but I get compliments on it every time I wear it."
4.0,"I wanted to love this suit so badly! However it is definitely not made for someone with a chest larger than a D cup. I'm 5'4, 145 lbs, and wear a 36DD and ordered a large and an extra large. Other than the cup size the large fit great. The bottoms are high waisted and make you feel like you're covered in the bum area. The peplume top is adorable. I just had way too much boob exposed to be comfortable. I unfortunately had to return the suite because of the small cup size of the suite."
4.0,"Good size, holds dollar bills well. Would like more slots for charge cards, but I can manage, that is why 4 stars."
4.0,"looks great but make no mistake this does run small! I'm 5'9 and usually a size 4 or 6 and I got the 8/10 and it fit well. Since this is really short but lose on the bottom I wore a pair of short yoga shorts underneath, so i didn't have to worry about accidentally showing too much! Overall i really loved this and got many compliments."
4.0,"Wish there wasn’t only two sizes. I bought both. My son out grew the first at 6 months, and won’t fit the next size until he’s 12 months... in the middle of winter. It would have been great to have an in between size for 6-12 months so I could have used it most of the summer. I love this product. It’s soft and cute and thin. Though it is easy to get holes in."
4.0,"I think considering all of the bad reviews you usually see on these Asian sites this coat is great for the money! My issue is I ordered a large and got an xxl:( if it fit better in sleeves I'd probably love it. I think a large would've been perfect! I'm normally a small but ordered up a couple sizes up due to reviews. Maybe if I had ordered a small I would've got what I actually needed, large! I'll have to give it away."
4.0,Usegul
4.0,"I have a long torso, so when I try compression waistband things it can be hit or miss. These pants did a pretty good job making the lower half of my body look a lot firmer than it is. I would have liked more of the compression to come down to where my mom-apron-flap thing is, but alas it doesn’t quite reach down there. But if you have a short torso this may work well for you."
4.0,They are great for what you spend on them. Just be a bit careful with the clasps when taking them on and off and they will last. I wear one to work every day and have had them for a few months. WORTH IT!
4.0,Well made and effective.  Very light weight.  but Clip design is problematic for prescription glasses with high bridge.  (See photos.)
4.0,"Loved this dress and the color. I ordered a large and it was just right if not just a little snug in the top and a little low but its more flirty than slutty.<br />I am 5’7, 165 lbs, and a 36 DD. I washed it before I wore it so it laid better on and hung it out to dry so it wouldn’t shrink up. I couldn’t afford that, it was already short but not inappropriate for a wedding. Just a small large, not like a Old Navy Large. So it’s adorable and I danced all night in it. Great dress for the price. Oh! And it’s lined."
4.0,boys weren't sure about this but when they tried it they liked it.
4.0,look too 'plasticky'
4.0,I think if you are going to use this kind of strap it would be best to start with it. Otherwise it is hard to get use to. Serves my purpose well I did not want to put holes in my new uke. And besides it's easy to detach.
4.0,"Had to sew the straps because the halter is not the most supportive fit for bustier women, but other than that I love it."
4.0,Seems great at first sight.  My child slipped her foot into the shoe right after we took it out of the bag. She was able to get it on by  herself. She is 3. She still wears them now on the second day continuously. The reason I left one star was because the back is not as sturdy as original natives but they do look of good quality as a water shoe.
4.0,"bought son his size 11 (runs small) returned and ordered the next size 12 since he really like<br />the way shoe looked, 12 worked great and he is happy with his new slippers."
4.0,"The sizing is inconsistent within the same pack and that was disappointing. Two pair fit great, one pair was a little snug, but the 4th pair was uncomfortablely small and I couldn’t wear them for very long. The elastic on the leg opening was digging into my skin."
4.0,"Cool replica, although it would be better if the eye actually lit up or there was some sort of animation to it like the Marvel Legends helmets (Iron Man, Starlord) or Thor's hammer.  Still, good presentation in the box with the authentication card from Marvel."
4.0,Very nice dress. 4 stars just because of fabric.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:72aa1aab294d7b933b165e9275574689]] I really liked this material..its really cute and comfortable.
4.0,"I was looking for a travel bag , (airplane )the size is is exactly what I was looking for  and the material is good . Side pockets are very useful to put all my tiny stuffs,I recommend this to all"
4.0,"The dress is alright for a cheap price. The fabric is cool and comfortable. The stitches is a little rusty and you can find some ends sticking out. The back of the dress is flopped for me, I guess I don't have enough booty so beware for that. I did wish the dress would be a little puffed on the bottom, that would be great."
4.0,"Arrived early, looks great. Thanks!"
4.0,Love it. Super comfortable and it’s a great length to pair with leggings.
4.0,"Husband loves it. He keeps commenting how soft it is.  The sweater overall seems well made,  the only reason I took off one star is due to the interior finishing on the pockets. They have a odd piece of trim and aren't tacked down so he won't wear it unzipped.  I think a few hand stitches to tac it down will fix it.  Fits as expected.  I prob could have got him a Large but I wanted it on the roomy side. He can comfortably wear a tshirt and dress shirt under it."
4.0,I love emerson street night shirts<br />This one the fabric weight seemd a bit lighter than all my others.<br />I am hoping they are not going to change that feature.
4.0,"This band is easy to install, doesn't look too bad (considering i wanted it as a workout band) and seems pretty durable. its a bit stiff making it harder to get on and off sometimes, but I imagine over time it will loosen up."
4.0,The material was absolutely exquisite but it was much to long for my frame.
4.0,Great material and flattering with a decent amount of material in the skirt so it doesn’t cling to saddle hips. I am 6 feet tall and it’s barely long enough but I am thinking that I should add a 2 inch black lace ruffle
4.0,"Fun socks, these are very low compression though."
4.0,It was way to big as a small. Had to add holes in band
4.0,"I really like this suit and the adjustable straps. The bottoms run small and top is true to size. I'm 5&#34;5', 130, 34B & purchased a medium (normally wear 2 or 4). The bra top is a little loose on me, but stays in place, even with diving. The bottoms cover just enough, but definitely not full coverage."
4.0,Really nice overall. Happy with length not too short. You can tighten waist.
4.0,"Nice summer hat. It arrived as advertised... although it took 9 weeks from when it was ordered. Can't complain though, pandemic was out of everyone's control. At least I've got a stylish option for summer since getting a haircut isn't an option."
4.0,Cute! The fabric is a little cheap
4.0,Had to order 2 sizes up from what I normally wear in Mavi jeans
4.0,We love this dress I bought it for my daughter but she did need to wear a tank top under it due to the fact that it was somewhat see thru but overall very cute
4.0,"I ordered these the middle of June 2017. It is now September 2018. They have never left my wrists. Both are starting to tear apart after a year of constant wearing. Not bad for the price. The four stars would have been five, had the leather faded with wear. It seems to be coated, and retains<br />it's look for just over a year at least. Also would be nice if they offered two of the same color."
4.0,"The fit, color, weight and look were great, however, upon washing it as instructed, the down balled up and the jacket was no longer puffy.  I had to return it to Costco."
4.0,it awsome
4.0,"This dress was super cute However, I am 5'3"", weigh 165, and wear 36 C (ordered a Medium). This dress showed off boobies!! I returned because I needed a more comfortable dress for Italy."
4.0,I love them! I also just am the slightest bit disappointed because they're black and not clear like it poses as.
4.0,"Very pleased with this necklace,"
4.0,"great qualityi love the different bags that it has,perfect to put in the different stuff we have"
4.0,Brought as a gift not expecting to last long but it was cute and served the purpose
4.0,"First off these shorts are definitely worth the purchase. I own 2 pairs of Ten Thousand shorts and these are basically right on par. I will say if you get these to get 1 size larger than normal as they were a bit tight on me and I’m 6’1 207ish muscular build. Also AVOID THE WHITE- they are dope but they are see through hahaha. Luckily I found out before I went to the gym. You can’t not not wear anything under them as it will be visible and if you wear any dark compression shorts underneath, well that’s seen through them too haha. If you have maybe a light grey or white briefs or spandex I think you’d be fine but yeah wasn’t expecting that as the pictures didn’t show this on the model.<br /><br />Also, they’re are not for swimming. I tried them on the hot tub and the shorts bubble up. Not a con as these are for training but just incase, just be prepared for having an excuse evertime you have to push out the bubbles and it looks like you farted lol.<br /><br />Other than that great shorts for 1/2 the cost of the other top brands."
4.0,"There is no fit to this product.  It is a spray to help stretch shoes. It seems to work well, along with shoe stretchers."
4.0,The boyfriend liked it.
4.0,"A great starter gym bag for my 4th grader who just started sports , stylish , affordable, just wish it had a water bottle pocket"
4.0,"Love, love these earrings.  This year, I've been all about the fringe and these really fit he bill.  My only complaint is that some of the threads were cut uneven (easily remedied by trimming myself), but 2 of the 3 pair also had one of each set that was fuller of threads than the other, making them a little lopsided looking.  Overall, very pretty for the $$."
4.0,"I liked the print, but it is very thin in comparison to other mouse pads I have purchased."
4.0,Very comfortable and looks great too.
4.0,Nice sturdy frames that can fit prescription lenses however they're more of a woman's style.
4.0,Like it can’t use my earphones with it
4.0,They fir very well. I like the look.
4.0,"These are really nice, came on time and in great condition. The only complaint I have is the post is a little short for my liking making it a little tough to fit into my cartilage. However, they look super nice, fit extremly well and feel great. Will defiantly buy from here again! 💕✨"
4.0,"Super cute & trendy. Looks stylish & expensive from afar. Only problem is that it it doesn't sit atop  your head. I can't wear it on my head while I shop, as the sides are to loose & wide."
4.0,Love this necklace very eye catching I get a lot of compliments on it kinda feel like a gypsy wearing it
4.0,"Great quality, soft material. I had to send it back because the sleeves were too long."
4.0,"The belts are ok, but why not just have a real picture of the products you are ordering.  This happens too much. If the ""orange color belt matched the picture I would think they were perfect. I did age some of the belts and they look fine.. so not too bad..."
4.0,"This is really a fabulous dress for the price it's a bit long for wife (she's 5'2"") hit well below knee.  However the top shelf for a 36c is spot on.  The straps are shaped to handle the girls and not be to wide on top.  There is also a nice ripple texture in the fabric which really works out well on.  Would definitely recommend, especially for the taller ladies."
4.0,I think they are adorable
4.0,Jacket is nice quality but runs small
4.0,"This dress was very, very comfortable and kinda cute. I refer to it as the bat dress because... It made me look, and feel, like a bat. I'm 5'4, just under 200lbs and the XL fit very well. I actually just pulled it over my head, rather than unzipping it. The material is quite thick and I would not encourage anyone to wear it in any sort of heat. Who knows, maybe if you tend to run cold, go for it. You can't beat the quality for the price at all."
4.0,"Casio doesn't supply the information anywhere, but I'm quite certain that the only difference between this F91W-1 &#34;Classic&#34; watch and the F105W-1A &#34;Illuminator&#34; watch is the backlight. The F91W-1 uses a single LED for its lighting source, which is pretty weak. Note some of the complaints in these comments about the poor backlight quality. On the other hand, the F105W-1A uses an electroluminescent backlight, which is a far better uniform, bright backlight. It's blue, too. Hence its name of &#34;Illuminator.&#34; Other than that, the two watches (and their bands) are identical. It's like comparing a lightbulb (Classic) to a glowing wall (Illuminator).  BTW: both watches use an 18mm band.<br /><br />So if the quality of the backlight is of concern to you, pop for the extra $3 and buy the Illuminator instead of the Classic. I've owned each model and gave up on the Classic because I didn't like the quality of its backlighting."
4.0,Its nice but bigger than I prefer on my finger. I will wear it a few times then pass it along to a family member or good friend
4.0,"Let me start off by stating that It's beautiful. I'm uber sensitive to energy and can't wear or make any of my stones much at all anymore. Autonomic Dysfunction has robbed me of all of it. Crystal's, energy and meditation all stimulate the vagus nerve and a metal allergy so I'll be snipping the metal out and like all my jewelry, I won't be wearing it often. The only thing which held back a 5 star was the macrame cloth is coated in some sort of hard wax and makes it difficult to maneuver the knotted closure due to it being very stiff."
4.0,Very good... Not made for all Casio XL's but they will fit with some maneuvering of the shelf. Fits 5 only of that size.
4.0,Good quality except that the hard plastic (glass?)  top easily came out of place
4.0,"These are actually pretty nice socks. I was suspicious that since they were advertised as loose at the top that they would slip down when I was walking, but so far they have stayed put. They are very soft and protect my feet well inside my shoes, allowing my foot to breathe, I guess I suspected compression of some sort, but thats not what i got. Just a comfortable pair of loose fitting socks, but I'm not dissappointed."
4.0,Good thick soft material. Beautiful dress! I'm 5'1'' 120lbs the dress is long on me and fits a bit snug in the waist.
4.0,"Great product.  Alas, 9” is too small for my head I guess.  I do have a slightly bigger head.  Too tight."
4.0,"Very nice necklace-the cat was the icing on the cake for me. Although I have small hands, it takes me awhile to fasten the tiny clasp onto the small loop.  I do like the delicate chain."
4.0,Nice. Comfortable but I wish it could hold a few more cards. it holds 5
4.0,These just came in today and are good quality just I have a huge head and these are a little short for my glasses but still very nice.
4.0,These are great value for the money. I bought them to insert inside my DGI FPV googles to provide the clearest and widest widest possible view. I also use them for those times when a little extra magnification is needed for fine scale work (e.g. viewing electronics circuit boards.)  I needed the extra power (+4) that can not typically be found in the local stores or pharmacies. They do this job admirably. The frames are a little flimsy and these are best left for occasional use.
4.0,"These are still and a bit thin at the bottom, but overall not too bad for the price. I put a cushy insole in the bottom and wore them for twelve hours (at a Renaissance Faire) without any problems."
4.0,"Recieved fast and fit as expected. Material is very light and see thru, wish i had ordered 2 to get the right puffiness i was looking for but will order again."
4.0,"I bought two on sale and I’m very happy with my purchase! I’m 5’2 and I don’t find the dress to be too long. I will mention I’m 20 weeks pregnant so my little bump might help the length a little, but I was very pleased with the fit. I’m normally a medium, but sized up to large so it would fit as my belly grows. It’s super comfortable and very cute. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the fabric on the olive one was a little frayed all over and the navy with blue and white stripes on top was very see-through at the top."
4.0,The boots are beautiful but the size runs smaller.
4.0,"I had to readjust the ring a little so that it didn’t dig into my thumb. However, that was super easy! I wear it all day and there is no sign of tarnish or wear. I’m giving the other one to a friend."
4.0,Really nice looking watch. Love the wood my husband hasn’t worn it much yet because of the type of work he does so I will update more later as to how it holds up. Came in a nice wood box with a tool to adjust the links worked great!
4.0,"They look nice however, they don't fit kids like it says in the description. I had my 12yr old try it on and it was too big for her."
4.0,Love the comfort of this dress and the ability to dress up or down.
4.0,Small but very beautiful.
4.0,Cute but really thick
4.0,I wish I had paid the extra couple $$$ for a fabric strap. This one is rubber/silicone.
4.0,"Well made apron, with thick leather straps and front pocket. The canvas is a well made of durable  tough material."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty. When I opened the package one of the buttons had fallen off, but that would be an easy fix. I just had to return it because it was too large in the chest  and a little itchy where the straps are with lace.  I had found another style that fit me better, but still a very pretty dress!"
4.0,I got two of these.  One for my baby and one for my big girl.  The color of the skirts was a little different even though I ordered them in the same color.  But they are still beautiful and we'll made.  My girls love them.
4.0,Well made. fit well. good material.
4.0,Great price and pretty cool kids shoe.
4.0,"I ordered a Medium. I wear a medium for shorts, sweat pants, etc. When I put it on the waist band came put much father than in the picture. It almost covers my belly button. Other than that it fits well and is comfortable."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter's for Christmas, so I haven't given it to them yet.  They are super pretty. The CZ is VERY clear...I'd like it if it didn't look nearly invisible, but they are very pretty! I can't wait to give them to my kids!"
4.0,"Muy buena calidad y 100 % comodos y ajustables. Solo que no son grey ..mas bien son oscuros como lentes de sol ...si son para trabajar inside """" recomiendo que usen los transparentes"
4.0,"It is very comfortable. Just make sure you wash in a mesh bag on gentle cycle. I just put a big safety pin in the pads so they washed nicely. No pilling. As long as you don't mind the riding up of the band. I personally like the adjustable straps. But if you're not comfortable with the band riding up Don't purchase. It's impossible to wear without the band riding up. The price was why I picked this bra, and the comfort."
4.0,"I ordered these but returned them, they were super soft, and very comfy but just too big for me.  I didn't measure myself before ordering, If I had ordered about 1 size smaller they would have been fine. The product was comfortable and seemed of good quality."
4.0,"The sandals fit fine and get the job done for shower use, but I wouldn't walk around in them all day long. -md"
4.0,"It is beautiful, very pleased ."
4.0,It’s a comfortable stretch material but fit a little tight in the mid section across my belly. If I would have gone up 1 size I think it would have been fine.
4.0,"These boots fit so perfectly true to size! I am a size 7 1/2 and ordered as such and these shoes fit perfectly. They are very comfortable and easy to walk in, and they are soft to the touch. My only complaint is that I could see some minor areas where glue was used to adhere parts of the boots. However, unless you have your face 6” away from them, you would never know. Overall, I love these boots! They are my new go-to shoes for wintertime."
4.0,"The fabric is nice and light weight, so it's good for a summer top. 4 stars because it is not a real wrap top, the top half looks like one, but you have to pull this over your head instead of wrapping it around you."
4.0,"(First picture to show pants - blue shirt is a separate order I tried to pair the pants with. Second picture is NOT of the pants that came with this outfit - just the shirt and bow tie. The pants didn’t fit so I paired the shirt with some black pants I already had.)<br /><br />The shirt and bow tie are super cute but I can’t imagine the pants fitting ANY child as they have terrible proportions. The waist is far too tight and the legs are weirdly long and wide, and wouldn’t fit his size (0-3) even if the waist did. However, I’m still giving four stars because I like the shirt and it fits okay (I have to roll the sleeves), and the bow tie is adorable and can be moved to any shirt that has a top button (the bow tie attaches via a small elastic band on it that goes around the button). Sadly the suspenders are also not usable because they have openings to attach to the buttons on the pants. I may try to find an easy way to switch the suspenders to clasp fasteners but probably won’t since I’m a busy mom of three. It’s a sad waste of otherwise cute suspenders. I can’t say this outfit was too small or too large because it was too small in some places and too large in others 🤦🏻‍♀️"
4.0,"They were not fancy, by any means.  But I bought them, last minute, for a trip where I wanted to have some sun protection.  Since I travel by backpack, I didn't want to invest much in something which might get broken, so I figured these might be good even if they only last the one trip.<br /><br />The good:  They didn't fall apart, and they protected my eyes.  Didn't look half bad.  Good value considering cheap cost.<br /><br />The bad:  They do seem a bit cheap.  Don't expect them to hold up."
4.0,This is very cute set my daughter loves them wears them all the time she's 12 the gems are super cute
4.0,thinner than I thought but it will be perfect for spring snowboarding! Love it!
4.0,They will serve the purpose. They were a little lighter weight than I had hoped but that was not a deal breaker. They seem to be well made and I'm sure will be fine.
4.0,I like the heart gem tongue rings
4.0,"very good looking, the person who get it, loved"
4.0,Fit perfectly.  Material differs between pairs.  Three are thick as expected and one is incredibly thin material.
4.0,"Fit my glasses perfect. I mountain bike. I can flip the lens up in the shade and back down in the bright sun. When I’m riding fast, I can always see the trail."
4.0,"I love this dress. It is a beautiful color and pattern, and soft. I’m taller at 5’6”, and carry most of my height in my legs. I find the length to be great because usually midis do not fit like true midis for me. I only took off one star because I expected the fit to be a bit looser after scouring the vendor provided fit guide. It still fits well just a little more form fitting than expected."
4.0,My only complaint is that they attracts lint like crazy. Otherwise they're great
4.0,"clip is too tight had to use a screw driver to open the clip to put a single dollar in,<br />After the adjustment it works well and looks great."
4.0,"This was a gift for my granddaughter’s First Communion. I read the description and knew it would be tiny...but I had to use a magnifying glass to assure myself it really had the diamonds. Chips actually. The overall look was cute for a little girl though. Keep in mind that the way the chain is attached you will have a problem if it breaks. If you want to give a very nice little gift of jewelry to a young girl to commemorate a special occasion this is it. For an adult also, if they appreciate small unusual designs. Compared to what I saw at jewelry stores I feel I got good value for my money."
4.0,really pretty nice scarf
4.0,"Feels like it is good quality, has some nice heft and size to blind out with"
4.0,Cute cable knit. Definitely Ivory color and runs large. Using as a Halloween costume and getting it here on time was a huge concern. My grandson is a big guy for 10 months and the size 80 will be too big.
4.0,"Fits perfect, very comfortable and the skirt part is long enough for me to feel more confident."
4.0,"Subtracting a star because the size was way too big and return shipping is the buyers responsibility.. Originally ordered a large (which is my normal size) but these seem to be an extra large. Returning (return shipping is my responsibility) and ordering a size medium. I like the color and the fabric; returning isn't much of a hassle, but it should be free."
4.0,Not a huge fan but cool
4.0,Gave as a gift so not sure of how it held up but came wrapped in plastic and was easily giftable.  Pattern/colors were nice.  Zipper was as expected.  Straps seemed sturdy.  Size was great for a travel tote...not too big but also big enough to store some simple essentials.
4.0,Very attractive purse.
4.0,"This watch band is very nice and looks great, however it is small in circumference and hard to wear."
4.0,"I am 5'3"", 165lbs and this blanket fits as expected: very big as it is one size fits all! I took off one star because it has a strange chemical smell.<br />This blanket is perfect for curling up on the couch or wearing around inside If you're trying to save on your heating bill. If you are petite the pocket in the front is a little too low for keeping hands warm, but you could just tuck your arms into the sleeves! The sleeves are quite long so I feel like this will fit a much taller person. I like that the cuffs on the sleeves make this wearable for me as they keep the sleeves from falling down."
4.0,It's a strap. It works.
4.0,I do like this Jacket. It’s not to warm so really not for real cold weather !! The only thing I don’t like is the Zipper always get stuck zipping up or down every time !!!
4.0,They are so cute and look real. The edges are a little pointy though.
4.0,Beautiful earrings; not as long as portrayed on the website but they are fabulous earrings and great quality.
4.0,Cute little necklace for St Patrick's Day and was better quality than I expected for such a low price.
4.0,A little snug but cute. Color off or I got the wrong item. Would get again though. Lovely lace
4.0,I like the style and color. Roomy but not huge. I keep trying to go smaller but cant get rid of my stuff. Some people might think it's big when I read other reviews.
4.0,"These earrings are pretty, lightweight and definitely get noticed. Leopard pattern is the new thing and  is made out of small beads but beads completely took over this pattern and I honestly don’t see leopard patter when looking at these earrings. I immediately think native. They are still pretty just not leopardy."
4.0,"This product is no different than it is in the reference picture, which is pleasing. the leather (or vinyl) is durable, but not very flexible. it's going to take some time to break them in, but none the less seem sturdy enough for re-enactments, L.A.R.P, or even S.C.A.<br />In general, they can fit an average man's forearms comfortably, but probably wouldn't fit any one who has a lot of bulk on their arms.<br />they are light, also they look and feel like they were quality made for the price I payed.<br />I recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good addition to their costumes, but not for people who want the functionality of a real set of leather armor"
4.0,"The reviews are all over the place, so I'm thinking the construction control at the factories is not at a high standard<br />I ordered 2,  XL due to it being under 70% expected fit, but I normally wear L in tunics<br />These fit me slim, not flared, but flattering, long enough for over leggings, and not clingy...I was happy because I have so many trapeze style tunics and wanted something slimmer...but someone wanting a flare would be disappointed. HOWEVER, some of the photos posted by other customers didn't look anything like what I got, so again, inconsistent design...and these are long, so not sure about the review saying they are tank length..."
4.0,Wish I would’ve dozed down 1! Also it took a long time to get this chemical smell out..
4.0,Love Mordennmiss
4.0,Suit was super cute & excellent style but just too big! Defintely runs big for sizes!
4.0,Would like to have a little more support in the bra area as I am a DD cup.  A larger woman would probably fall out of the top.
4.0,"I've got a pretty large pumpkin head, but there were even just a little bit big for me. I'm able to wear them and they are great glasses. I used to buy Wal-Mart type glasses until I saw myself in a photo and it looked bad because the sunglasses looked tiny and made my head look bigger than it actually is!"
4.0,Really can't answer any questions other than their appearance.  I mean they don't look like Uggs but my 3 year old granddaughter doesn't need Uggs so they will work fine.
4.0,Watch doesn't work but I got it cause it looked nice. And it was cheap.
4.0,Nice weight and quality but the colors are way darker and dreary/muted.  Not light bright and cheery like in the photos.  The metallic is a gold color which is causing this.  I'd give 5 stars if the colors were like the photos.
4.0,"These sunglasses were a gift for a friend who collects &#34;Day of the Dead&#34; items. They are Wayfarer-style, not the actual Ray Ban Wayfarers, but they are really cute with the skull design! She loved them and was very happy with the way they looked."
4.0,"Super soft and comfy, no compression so no uncomfortable pressure on my belly. I’m 5’4”, was 132 lbs pre-pregnancy. Now 29 weeks and 149 lbs, the small fits great, not tight, if anything just slightly larger than I really need. I’m glad I didn’t size up. Length is perfect for cycling, not seat rub.<br /><br />The pink Spacedye color is really pretty but see-through and anything other than nude color panties will be noticeable."
4.0,its a beautiful shoe...a lil large behind the ankle but still beautiful and great fit!
4.0,"Although it only worked for a few minutes, this product has more potential."
4.0,Nice color and shape!
4.0,"I bought this to use for outdoor yoga at the park. the fabric feels nice , and the band at the bottom keeps the shirt in place .Keeps me covered when I am in downward facing dog!"
4.0,"I got the black checkered dress that the model is wearing, and I'm built similarly to her. It's a cute dress. I handwashed it according to instructions, and the wrinkles came out. My only issue is that I have tiny shoulders, and the dress slides right off my shoulders, so I hope I can fix that with a little sewing. I'm 5'3&#34; and 124 lbs. The medium was huge on me, so I returned it and got the small, which otherwise fits beautifully. The material is 100% polyester, so it should hold up fine, but the zipper may have to be replaced for a more solid one."
4.0,"I gave this to a friend, and she loves it. She gets many complements on it. I like on the, there is signs for prosperity and love. Good feng shui for a wallet."
4.0,They are great for work where my shirt is longer. They are super thin.
4.0,Good value for the price.. though fit is slightly odd.
4.0,Good. As expected.
4.0,"nice product, very light weight -- nice deep pockets."
4.0,"This coat is very warm and comfortable. It runs slightly large, but is good for wearing layers underneath in the cold months. Very flattering as well!"
4.0,"This is a very nice mask.  It's rather comfortable.  I only wish that it was listed as more of a young adult's or maybe a child's mask because I find that the eyes are rather close together and I noticed that one eye is half covered by the mask when I put it on.  Also,  I would recommend that they add a layer of cotton fabric on the side that covers your face because the plastic / rubber material is a little uncomfortable on the skin."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:bef4ae52fb305f7a306117902f5f5f43]] Got it for my boyfriend to wear for Halloween! Makes a weird humming sound when it’s turned on but so far so good.
4.0,If you have big calfs. Bigger than 16in they will be to tight.. XL is not XL i have size 10 women foot and 17in calf too tight so tight it hurt
4.0,"Just a standard faux septum peircing, cute, elegant, the faux opal is pretty, it fell out of my pocket while camping and couldn't find it, thinking about re purchasing"
4.0,"My son loves this shirt! It seemed to run a bit smaller than most boys mediums, I wish I had ordered the large, but he can still wear it and I've not putting it in the dryer but the quality seems good enough that if I did dry it I do not think it would shrink."
4.0,Cool badge but a little small
4.0,"Great set of faux plug studs. The black in mine is wearing off quickly, but who looks at the back of your ear much anyway? If I cared about that I would have gotten a set that had a plug-like back instead of a traditional back."
4.0,"My 18 month old petite daughter swam in this, but it did the job. We needed some gear for the snow and she stayed warm, dry, and puffy. Room to grow."
4.0,"Still a bit difficult to get them on.....they need a larger size for big-footed men!!<br />Priced higher than some other compression socks, but cotton is better than other materials.<br />A reasonably good deal.  Am likely to get another pair."
4.0,Denim cut off shorts are cute. Good price.
4.0,"Cute and small...not good for a fresh piercing though as they are extremely short. Perfect small stone, love them!! Shipping was long."
4.0,They don't really fit in each other but they are very nice necklaces
4.0,More of a rose gold color. Love it very bohemian look. Very good for price!
4.0,It fits a little snug but I do have a large head.  Great coverage a really stylish
4.0,"The small leo fits my 3 soon to be 4 year old just right. My only complaint is that when I got it, it had a hole on the shoulder. Luckily it was on the seam and I sewed it easily but was disappointed that it was there."
4.0,"I was not sure what size jacket I would receive when I placed my order for the Goodthreads Terry French jacket.  It arrived as a medium (""M"") size. If that's your true size the jacket should fit perfectly, especially if you're not taller than 5' 9"". Its cuffs and bottom are ribbed nicely and the neck is roomy when zipped all the way up. The fabric is good quality; it can be used indoors on cold days to save on energy bill. Be sure to order the correct size."
4.0,"This is very well made piece. Having three snaps on the band insures it can fit most anyone, and most anyone can wear it, from a preteen to old hippie types like me!. The only thing I don't prefer is the stain job on the band. Two coats would have looked better. But I have received compliments on it from several people.  good job!"
4.0,Mom loved it.  Its about 1/2 inch too big for her wrist though.  Would have liked to be able to shorten the links but overall a very nice piece.
4.0,A little big in shoulders but every where else fine.
4.0,"This is a nice leather case for small eyeglasses. My eyeglasses slide easily into the opening as you can see from the picture.  The interior is not lined, so the leather comes in contact with the lens. However, it is not scratchy so it has no ill effect. Obviously, this is a soft case, so it only protects my glasses from scratches and not from sitting on them or crushing them. However, anyone who purchases a case like this already knows that."
4.0,"Pros:<br />-light<br />-very adjustable<br />-attractive<br />-tougher than what the watch comes with<br />-price is right<br /><br />Cons:<br />-the securing band looks/feels cheap and slides around, letting the extra band flap like crazy<br />-a light color (I ordered lavender) dirties pretty quickly just from normal use<br />-doesn't &#34;stick&#34; to a spot on your wrist the way rubber does - slides around a lot more (this may be a pro for some people)<br /><br />Note: the buckle is not attached to the strap with a pin, it's just clamped on. This means that the buckle doesn't rotate on the band - instead the band, since it's flexible, bends when the buckle has to move. It's not as smart a way to design a watchband as a setup with a pin."
4.0,Totally a great bargain for the price
4.0,"I really liked the overall product. The length is nice and the shape around the neck is flattering, along with the big black buttons. The only thing I would personally change is the black shiny lining and the belt. It does look a bit on the cheaper side. Maybe try going for a matte and it would help. Also, I would make full pockets, because I was fooled thinking there were actually pockets."
4.0,These were nice sandles but our 4. 5 year old did not like them as they were too large on his feet. We had to return them.
4.0,"A little small, but good for the price"
4.0,"Cute,but a little thinner than I expected,I use under top for layers look"
4.0,Absolutely beautiful. The only reason it get four star's is because my drawstring came out the same day I wore it. It is so comfortable and just vibrant.
4.0,The goggles are great!  The swim cap never really fit right.  It was inexpensive enough that the goggles alone make it a worthwhile purchase.
4.0,"The material is a good weight and very soft! I’m only taking a star off because it appeared olive green in the photo but is actually grey. It looks more green in my photo than in real life too! So weird. Anyway, really wanted a green dress but I’ll still wear this because the material is so soft. Glad I sized down, too!"
4.0,"These are very cute although just a little blurred, but overall great for the price."
4.0,This dress works great. Really sexy but was little bit bigger cause I ordered a medium Instill of small. But love it
4.0,Perfect for tall men. Soft fabric; fantastic price!
4.0,Kind of cheesy looking but from far away for wedding pictures they looked romantic
4.0,"pretty cute! the yellow on top is kind of see through so will need a cami underneath. Fit as expected, I ordered a size up (large) from my normal medium and it's still not as flowy as I expected but will work fine with leggings or jeggings. Overall super cute! love it"
4.0,"Fit as expected, a little bit wide though. Not a big deal. Not sure if it'll hold up many washes"
4.0,"Lots of slots for cards. Once filled, its pretty thick...."
4.0,"I'm glad other reviewers had mentioned the size. I am normally a 3x but ordered the 5x from advice. The 5x fits like a 3x. You definitely need to size up by 2. Also, for being plus size the belt isn't the right length. When I tie a knot around the middle there is only about 6 inches of ""tail"". There isn't enough length for me to make a pretty bow like the picture, only a double knot. The belt is definitely meant for an XL or 1X person."
4.0,A bit thin but very comfortable. Nice as a swim suit cover up. It was a bit shorter than I expected.
4.0,"I have mixed feelings about these leggings. I appreciate the waist a lot, as I have problems with tights fitting my thighs but being too big on the waist. They fit kinda strangely--it's obvious there's some banding on the back side for accentuating your bum, but it's placed a little low, so it hits the back of my thigh. I do find the pattern to be somewhat flattering, although I wasn't expecting them to look as polka dotted as they do. I'm not mad though, for the most part, they're good for running, slip down a little, but not too bad! I would recommend it!"
4.0,I would recommend getting a size up so your whoo-ha doesn't flash everyone.
4.0,I liked the way it was made and for the price it was surprising
4.0,Can't beat the price doesn't look excatly like the picture and is a little big but overall it's a great purchase
4.0,Super sparkly and perfect size however after 2 days the post inside my nose started to tarnish. It hasn't effected the diamond part yet so it doesn't bother me but if you address sensitive to cheap metal you might want to keep that in mind... Other wise they are perfect and an awesome deal
4.0,"My boy is very active, these are great all around shoes, the only issue has been the Velcro that detached, easy fix."
4.0,great to help keep suitcase organized!
4.0,"Cute but I ended up returning. The top was VERY secure.  The lace at the back is adjustable for fit.  The colors were very vibrant.  The bottoms do not cover as much as I expected for a large.  The front ruching is great.  My hips are a 41 with fat thighs.  My waist is about a 31 and chest 35,b cup."
4.0,"I love looser peplum tops to help hide bloating and mama belly. Saw this was selling for a good deal and ordered it in the red. It’s more of a deep cranberry. The first shirt came, was cute, material seemed thin but I threw it on since it was perfect for casual Easter dinner with family. An hour at my mother in law’s someone points out my shirt looks like it is ripping... embarrassing. I look closer and the seam to attach the peplum is destroyed in many spots because the material got chewed up and holey during sewing. I immediately requested an exchange - I felt bad I wore the shirt but I didn’t bring a back up and for $18 it shouldn’t be unwearable. I received the replacement and the material is thicker and it’s overall a slightly better quality version. Would like black for the $14 lightening deal - hopefully I get a good one."
4.0,"ordered for someone else - he really likes it, but maybe he needs a hair cut for it to fit better!"
4.0,"I'm accustomed to loose fitting ""base layer"" shirts, but these shirts give my okay body a fitter appearance. The new feel took some getting used to but I never perspired. If you're not comfortable with a more clinging feel to your shirts it may not be for you, but I think you will like the look it gives you over your standard tank top. Not just for the model athlete."
4.0,Very nice shirt was disappointed that it fit a little large for a XL if fit like a 1X.  But I would recommend it for it is a great shirt.
4.0,"Nice silk, good quality but it fits small. Get 1-2 sizes up if you are husky or broad shouldered."
4.0,"I really like the Brooms of Elder Pentacle .. the only thing is, I wish it was detailed just a little bit more."
4.0,The quality of this shirt is not the best but the style is really cute! It's a great buy for the price.
4.0,I probably would have liked the shirt had it been longer. The fabric was soft and the color was nice. Unfortunately I'm a little taller and therefore need longer shirts. The shirt looks like it's very long in the picture but it only came down to just at the top of my pants.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest review.
4.0,"If this is for your kid than it would be good, the quality is great for the price, but if you like your sunglasses to be the perfect size, then I would suggest you buy from a different brand."
4.0,"There's a lot of bad reviews on this. Mine do fall out on occasion but not too often , they have an alright wearable space.also I got two that matched perfect, they're super opal , not too see thru"
4.0,"Metal is turning coppery where it is in most contact with skin, but for the price this doesn't bother me. Otherwise great, this was the first jewelry I've put in since the original piercing jewelry and I had no adverse reaction to the material."
4.0,These sun glasses were for my mom's stocking stuffer. she loved them.
4.0,Been wearing these around the house for over 6 months and they are holding up well and very comfortable. Mine was somewhat small but was able to break em in in about a week. They run small so order 1 size up
4.0,It's absolutely beautiful and soft. The description was right on other than size. I wish it fit but it swallows me whole. I'm thinking about ordering again but 1 size smaller. FYI I ordered a Large but its huge!!! I should have ordered a Medium .
4.0,Daughter wore it for her junior prom! Looked great and it was a great price
4.0,"Dress is very soft and comfortable. To me it fits very loose and wide at the bottom especially with the pockets. Overall, it's cute and perfect even for maternity wear."
4.0,Love this dress. Lot of compliments. Would have given 5 stars but a button fell off after the second wear and I don't know when it happened so it's lost. I'll have to replace all the buttons so they will all match.
4.0,"These are comfy slippers, just a tad big and clunky. For the price, they keep my feet warm. I don't expect them to last very long though because of the memory foam foot bed."
4.0,too big  for my taste but cute
4.0,"Anyone who owns a hipster type wallet will enjoy these. I guess anything you carry in your pocket is subject to wear, this product seems to be wearing just fine so far !!"
4.0,"The length is shorter than the picture shows, kinda disappointed"
4.0,It fits as I expected. It is flowy yet looks flattering
4.0,Nice. A little plasticky tho.
4.0,VERY COMFORTABLE AND COOL ON SUNNY DAYS.I use them for sports and walking for protection from sun.i would prefer selection of sizes.
4.0,Lightweight stretchy . Soft and comfy.  Nice color and fit. Wrinkles easily
4.0,I like these sunglasses. The color is beautiful. It comes in the Tiffany box and the Tiffany cloth bag and cleaning cloth. Nicely made.
4.0,Material is real thin but super cool hat
4.0,"Needed a last minute dress for my brother's wedding back in July and this was practically perfect!<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - The yellow dress is sheer. It's not terrible, but even with light colored undergarments, it was see through. I ended up sewing my own slip to wear underneath.<br /> - I'm 5'9 and the dress was almost a little too short. Standing up, it was fine, but my worries came from sitting/crouching down, etc.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Sooo comfortable! Weddings are a long event, so you want to wear something cute AND comfortable, right? This fits the bill perfectly!<br /> - Super flattering! Most dresses make me look like a brick wall but not this one! The ruffles really make the dress pop!<br /> - Beautiful color!<br /><br />Four stars because of the sheerness, but otherwise, a five star dress!"
4.0,I ordered size L but I usually wear M. It fits great.<br />I'm happy that material doesn't shrink on the drier .
4.0,Too see through but it looks nice with a tank top.
4.0,"this bag is nice.  I mainly use it for work lugging my food and work items with plenty of space to spare.  the material is thick and the 6 &#34;legs&#34; on the bottom add for stability.  the strap however is a pain.  the latches do not rotate, the strap itself, at times, gets tangled and I am constantly having to straighten the strap prior to using it.  I wish the latches would rotate so I wouldn't have to keep disconnecting it and reconnecting after the strap is straight again.  the other problem I have with this one of the pull zippers fell off for no apparent reason.  thankfully I found it at home and was to to reattach it and I secured it with some vice grips to ensure it wouldn't fall off again.  as of this review it has held in place.  and lastly the other problem I have already encountered is that it is starting to rust.  mainly on the latches.  the zippered areas are holding up well and the Velcro is fine but the connection latches are rusting in certain areas.<br /><br />the duffel bag is very nice overall.  never owned a Zebella product before.  I would recommend this to someone who likes to have their hands free when walking in and out of work or for everyday use."
4.0,"Demasiado ancho a mi gusto, no recuerdo haberlo visto en pantalla el ancho, posiblemente lo decía en números, pero para el precio, no hablaré mucho... lo obsequié, lo malo que a mi amigo nunca se lo he visto puesto jajaj"
4.0,My husband loves the shirt. It looks great on him. But the fit is a loose fit. It works for him. I just thought it would be a little more fitted
4.0,"My 4 year old picked this out and it looks and fits great. I ordered 4t and it fit perfect even though she's has a smaller waist for her age. I would have given 5 stars, but some if the sueing fabric was left uncut on both the shirt and shorts which looked sloppy, but after cutting the ends off myself it looked fine."
4.0,I bought 2 and both are very nice good quality but the lions head always spins on the wrong side.
4.0,Nice underwear but seems like sizing runs a little small.
4.0,This was aa gift and I never got a feedback from her.
4.0,"This outfit is cozy and stylish! The pop of camo in the hooded vest ties it all together! The joggers stay in place due to the elastic waistband! My son wears a 14/16 but I ordered a 16/18 there's no room to grow, This outfit runs small. It's been through several washes and hasn't shrunk nor faded!"
4.0,I love this dress fits great.
4.0,Love these tops. I was worried about how they would stay up and not slip being strapless. These are very soft and the band stays put! The colors are bright and solid pigment!
4.0,These are beautiful but a 3X is really only about a 8-10 in USA sizes.
4.0,I would say me lenses are more &#34;orange&#34; than the bright red they show in the picture.  Delivered on time and no issues yet with the workmanship.
4.0,Normally a size small but I sized up to a medium based on other reviews. I'm a 32D with 31&#34; ribcage and 35&#34; bust. The medium it's a pretty good fit. The pink is closer to an orangey-coral color.
4.0,Bought 2 of these in 2 different colors. They’re comfortable and just easy to throw on
4.0,These are exactly as described - they are long and look great.
4.0,"This dress was very reasonably priced and arrived quickly. I was sad because I couldn’t get the dress on, way too small. Unfortunately there wasn’t a larger size in stock, if there was I would have purchased it."
4.0,Every guy wants a great body -  strong arms and a chest that you proudly show off at the beach. The reality is I like beer and pizza and if i skip the gym and indulge my body shows it. I bought the Roc men's body shaper. I'm 6'3 and 247lbs. Ive got a belly. I usually wear an XL or XXL shirt size depending on the fit so I ordered an XL. The compression tank does a nice job of smoothing everything in a button up shirt. Its pretty comfortable too. I read reviews where people said it was too constricting. I found it to be just tight enough.<br /><br />The compression makes me look a little better when Im at work but it doesn't hide the fact losing 20 pounds would be far more benficial. Overall a good product and price.
4.0,I had purchased this dress for my daughter in a different color & we both loved it so much I purchased one for myself! It's very comfy & very figure flattering!
4.0,For taller girls. It is comfortable and I like to wear it but it’s very bunch around the crotch. Need longer legs!
4.0,"Love this dress! I’ve been getting into maxi dresses lately because I’m getting fatter, haha, and wanted something comfortable and classy. This is a simple dress and you can class it up a little more by throwing something over it, but it’s so soft and a great color! Only problem is that the pockets have a mind of their own and keep popping out at random, so I’m not sure what to do about that. Otherwise, excellent dress, modest and comfortable and an easy kind of classy (minus those peekaboo pockets!!)"
4.0,I ordered this for my son and he loves wearing it!  It fits nicely and looks great!  I recommend it.
4.0,The suit fits overall well a little too fitted up top. Not a bad thing just would prefer looser but otherwise no complaint. Material is quality
4.0,I expected a more finished product - i.e. at least hemmed at top and bottom but after reviewing the video maybe that is required to maintain the versatility. The patterns are lovely.  Keeping because of the lightweight and  returns are just too much hassle for me. At this low price it likely worth a try. Arrived sooner than projected.
4.0,"This is the third time I've ordered this. The first I lost, the second I gave to a friend & this is the third! I love it! Although a couple of the beads have lost the black color...I can live with that :)"
4.0,"I love these skirts. I'm 5'4, 170 lbs, 35 inch waist. I ordered an XL. They are rather long, but if I wear them high on my waist they go to my ankles. They have a LOT of stretch, so I could have gone with a large but they're good for fat days. Much lighter and thinner than expected, but good quality. Perfect for super hot days, especially going through ""the change"". 😆"
4.0,"I have several Syrokan sport bras--all 36D, but they all fit slightly different.  The band is a little tight on this one, so I wear it on the largest hooks.  The support is as stated &#34;medium&#34;, so it's not as supportive as I'd like, but I bought it to wear to my son's cross country meets so I can jog along the route with a little more support than an everyday bra without getting a regular bra all sweaty.  I've tried to tighten the straps for more support, but then the straps dig in and cause discomfort.  But overall it is a decent bra."
4.0,"It works fine. I use jojoba oil on them and my ears and so far, no complaints. The only reason I give it a 4 star is I'm impatient and it took forever to sort out the sizes. The tapers and tunnels are all in separate bags and you have to match the tapers to the tunnel and put them all in order. But, they are perfect after that step lol"
4.0,You get a lot for what you pay for - it works...I use it to make sure the jeweler gave me back my diamond :)
4.0,This is a belt I couldn't find in the stores around my home.  It is an elastic belt so the fit isn't a problem.  The flower is very pretty.  I added sparkle to it by putting one of my broaches in the flower's center.  It was inexpensive and totally worth the price and the wait (it was shipped from overseas).
4.0,El producto es muy cómodo y las utilizo para conducir.<br />El servicio muy bueno llegó antes de lo previsto
4.0,"Really cute. I have received lots of compliments about them.  The only this is since they’re only filled in on one side, one of them is twisted backwards and you can’t see the prettier side.  Can probably be fixed by twisting gently with pliers though, and they’re cheap... so overall happy!"
4.0,Love the design. I just wish the colors were brighter.
4.0,"I really really like the size of this backpack overall, the feel, the size, the look... it wouldve had it all! I would gladdly give it 5 stars but the string was sewn into the threading of the bag, probably a manufacturing error... but... im worried if i clip it it will affect the integrity of the bag.... :( im hoping i can just kinda adapt to having it that way and if it bugs me too much i will just clip it and see what happens.... overall tho! I love the bag and hope it lasts me a long time!"
4.0,Beautiful little dress for Thanksgiving. Everyone called my daughter a turkey princess. But beware of all the glitter fall out when you open it. Washing it helps lessen the fall out.
4.0,"This bra is pretty great for the price. I don’t have a large chest at all and it really did me some favors. Pretty comfortable, too. True to size...I’m a 36B at Aerie because they run a little small, but I got this one in a 36A (what I usually wear) and it fit perfect."
4.0,"Great crop tank, not too short. Love these! Not superb quality but good enough and for a great price. Love these and wear them often for workouts. Would recommend!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:acac73f86903a094032e1ecddbfd77b]] Pros:<br /> - Very soft comfortable material (76% Polyester / 24% Spandex)<br /> - Moisture wicking quick dry - breathable fabric<br /> - Material is stretchy<br /> - 2 Large Pockets (fit Samsung galaxy S20 Ultra with a pop socket)<br />Cons:<br /> - None<br /><br />I ordered these to have comfortable clothes to just hang out around the house.  These shorts are very comfortable.  The material is stretchy, lightweight and very breathable.  The material is not see-thru.  The 2 large pockets are large enough to hold my Samsung Galaxy S20 ultra with a pop socket.  The material is very stretchy and does not provide a lot of compression as stated in the title but very comfortable.  I did order a size up because I do not like really restrictive clothing.  I would recommend these to others and would consider reordering them in different colors.  I feel that they are worth the current price point."
4.0,They are nice fitting but to short for me
4.0,GREAT PRODUCT AND FAST DELIVERY
4.0,Love! I gave it 4 stars because the straps are a little too big and look cheap.
4.0,"Beautiful and so stunning that I will wear them on special occasions only.  I was planning to wear them to work, but they are just so spectacular that I wear other earrings that are not so &#34;blingy.&#34;  I would have given them 5 stars, but the backs of the earrings are a bit bent.  Otherwise, I am thrilled with my purchase and would recommend them just for the fact that the stones are beautifully cut and facetted."
4.0,Comfortable Summer dress.
4.0,I love this dress! I only have it a 4 because the neckline seem is making a giant gap where your cleavage meets. Good thing it wasn't put together great and i was able to pull the stitch out. Material is nice and not too heavy. I'm 5 6 180
4.0,"Very cute! A bit shorter than expected but not so short I'll return it. Also very thin, which is perfect for the summer, but it does need a slip"
4.0,Order up two sizes and for big breasts definitely need bigger. I love this so much!! I normally wear an extra large but got a 3x fit perfect. I love the color and style.
4.0,Very flattering dress. I'm 5' 7 140lbs.  I ordered the small and it fits perfect. Only complaint is how long it is but that will make it the perfect dress to wear to weddings or more formal events.
4.0,"I love this bag. Its big enough to fit my wallet and my planner/notebook, along with my every day things like my keys and phone. It seems really durable. Its a little heavy, which is fine. The only problem I have with it is the front pocket under the flap is sown on crooked. Otherwise, its a great bag."
4.0,"I am 5’7” and wanted to try this dress after reading the reviews.  The dress runs a little small, in my opinion and the fabric is a little thin, but I live in TX and summers are hot so that was not a bad thing!  The fabric drapes well and I don’t think it is see through. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,I absolutely love this scarf and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it sheds everywhere! Not horribly noticeable on my Pea-coat but very noticeable on my fleece jackets! Very very soft material and also very delicate. I haven't washed it yet but I think hand-washing will be the way to go. Just remember once you wash it it won't have that same fluffy feeling it did right out of the package!
4.0,Love this dress. The material is very soft and the cut is flattering! I’ll be ordering it in more colors for sure!
4.0,"This came in an adorable box. That was a nice surprise. It's really cute too, but I broke 2 nails trying to open the clasp. At least I know that it won't fall off once it's on. Ha ha. It's a nice heavy piece that feels good on. I like heavy pieces because they just feel better and more secure. It's a good size for an adult, but I wouldn't buy this for a kid. Sizing it would need to be done by a jeweler and would cost a butt load.<br />All in all I'm happy with this purchase. I would have given the fifth star if the clasp wasn't so difficult to open and if the hearts were more pronounced."
4.0,Good buy! True to size!
4.0,"Good for the price. But, it's not as nice as the picture. It's also bigger than I thought it would be."
4.0,I really like this shirt. I read some of the reviews before purchasing so I knew it ran small. I ordered a 2x when usually I am a large or large. It fits fine.
4.0,"I like it, it's neat. really cute! love the glittery deer head, I would deff recommend to anyone whether you're a little country or a lotta city!"
4.0,"I wear these shorts to run with a compression liner beneath them. The dark olive green is a nice neutral and unobtrusive color. They do make a 'swishing' sound when the thighs rub together, so if you're hoping to be a running ninja and stealthy, these will make you a total giveaway. They don't seem to retain any odor after washing and dry fairly quickly on the line so you can get back out on the track, trails, or pavement. They also fit as expected, so bonus there as often times clothing sized in other countries is a big funky. Recommended!"
4.0,Awesome dress. Soft. Great pockets. I'm taking a star off for the color. This is more pink than the blush color shown in the picture.
4.0,"It's of great quality and very comfortable, but I'm 5'9&#34; and 160lbs - ordered &#34;US Medium&#34; size which is what I wear for almost every item of clothing I purchase. When it arrived, the thing was 7' tall. Tried it on and it's really bunchy in the legs and the pockets were at my mid-thigh. Double checked the label and it confirmed &#34;US Medium.&#34; Sending it back and ordering a &#34;US Small&#34; size instead. Hopefully that will fit better."
4.0,"I have always been drawn to vintage and antique style watches.  From the parts of a watch to the mechanical workings, I think watches and clocks have beauty that is not only on the outside but even more gorgeous on the inside.<br /><br />CSMARTE, is a company that features many styles of watches that can easily satisfy anyone's taste.  Many of the styles are jewelry like in nature, so you get not only a piece that tells time but also one that serves as a beautiful necklace.  Their selection goes from pocket watches to wrist watches, so you can find a tick-tock device that fits your needs.<br /><br />I was sent a pocket watch unit that comes with a chain style necklace.  The watch has a black colored metal finish that is smoky and glossy at the same time.  The face of the watch is white, which is a nice contrast against the darker tones.  You have two ornate style clock hands, both for the hour and minute settings.  They resemble a scroll design and like with any pocket watch, you use the lever on the top that sets the time.  A classic and whimsical style and all comes together in a gift box, just in case this serves as a present for that special someone.<br /><br />Retail Price Point: Depending on the chain you choose, teh watch is priced between $12.88 and $12.99, plus qualifies for Amazon Prime free shipping.<br /><br />Product Dimensions: 3.1 x 2 x 1.2 inches<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />The clock has a nice balanced weight to it, so it is not too heavy when worn as a jewelry accessory but also not so light that it will be flinging around at your every move.  The (Japanese) quartz movement keeps accurate time and I did notice the nice touch of plastic peels added to the clock's case, so you receive a blemish free article when the watch arrives.  No scratches or fingerprints!  The only con I could find is when opening the watch, it can be a little difficult if you have nails and do not want to damage the watch or your manicure, but I prefer that over the top popping open.  The clock's case also does not open all the way, as the hinge seems to be a little tight and I get 3/4 of the clock open when I need to check the time.  It's a value nonetheless if you look at the price and quality of the product, that makes it a fair purchase.  I will be using mine in a pocket watch craft project I will be doing this Summer, so for me this is a perfect price for a working unit and what I have in mind.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from CSMARTE. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours."
4.0,"I ordered a pair of these for a freind. They shipped fast and looked nice. Material feels high quality, but were slightly see through; mainly when bending over. It could be due to possibly getting a size to small, she said they fit fine though. For the price they are a fair deal."
4.0,"So cute but way too big! I’m 144lbs and 5’5” and I’m usually an 8/M, 36C. I ordered a medium and was swimming in it. The material is light and flowy, but it was very roomy especially up top. Sadly I’ll be returning it."
4.0,Works as expected with Fossil watch.
4.0,Nice hat.  Will keep my head warm and let other hunters see me during muzzleloader season.
4.0,Fun dress but too small for me
4.0,They were a little snug in the buttocks area
4.0,a useful piece of warm weather clothing from Latin America and the carribean
4.0,This is a gift for Christmas but I hope it goes over with my  teen granddaughter.
4.0,The size 10/14 was too big. I was pleased with the sleeper. Will order a smaller size.
4.0,"pretty,"
4.0,Beautiful dress but a lot smaller than I thought. Definitely go up a size. But it is seriously gorgeous.
4.0,Sturdy body jewelry.  Beautiful.
4.0,"This boots are fabulous!  They are very attractive and have a solid heel so I won't turn my ankle. I usually wear a 7 1/2 shoe size so that's what I ordered. There is enough room for me to wear  footies.<br />My advice: order your regular shoe size and wear footies or ankle socks. If you want a snug fit, order 1/2 down."
4.0,I bought these for protection at a concert. My kid loves to wear them. They do their job.
4.0,I wanted to use it as a shield on an Opinel but it's just too big. I knew the size and I thought I'd bend it around. Can't. Nice pin though.
4.0,"These were a little more flimsy than I anticipated - hoped they would be a bit harder/protective, but great price for what you get! Would recommend to a friend, but I had been looking up hard cases, and these came up - and I would say they're great, but not exactly what I was looking for!"
4.0,"Made alterations on the upper part of the dress, the shoulder line would not stay in place as shown in the picture."
4.0,"I wish these were made specifically for size 10 womens.  I got the largest size because reviews said they fit fine, however, my index toe is longer than my big toe and after a few hours, it begins to hurt a bit.  Still, they are a good idea and well made."
4.0,"I really like this purse because it &#34;goes&#34; with almost everything and for an evening out, the strap comes off which, if you want, makes it look a bit more dressy. What I find difficult is inside. It has lots of zipper/pockets, etc. But, the one larger zipper pocket, is not in the middle of the purse and it gets lost when you have things in the purse...and if you want to stash make-up or extra &#34;whatever&#34; it is then hard to find. That is an inconvenience.<br />But overall, I do like the purse."
4.0,The suspenders are great. By themselves the material is pretty rough on shoulders and personally rubbed me raw.. I purchased the atlas yolk and they are amazing way better than I could’ve imagined and you can add atlas attachments.
4.0,"Nice set, but tie and tie tack are on the chinsy side."
4.0,Im 5'4 and about 104 pounds and it fit me perfictly but you have to wear a white bra with it or else you will be able to see it
4.0,"I have poor circulation and  thought I would give leg warmers a try during the cold winter months.  They fit well, wash well, and are a good price."
4.0,The colors were perfect for my winter jacket!
4.0,"The dress, style, and fabric are nice. The dress is far too long. It was even too long for my tall friend."
4.0,It is really cute! I ordered a large size because everyone said I should (I'm 5&#34;5' 140 lbs) It's too big. Will it shrink? Has anyone washed it? If it shinks a bit it will fit fine!
4.0,I'm 5 foot 4 and 135 pounds and I ordered the small and its still pretty loose and also goes well past my knees. It lands about mid calf. Not really what I expected. Also I thought it would be a more cottony material but it's a synthetic blend and a tad see through. For the price it's decent enough though.
4.0,"The stone is lovely, delicate and of a nice size. The chain is superfine and I wouldn't risk even using it."
4.0,little different that what I usually wear but they are nice.
4.0,"The Glasses are Good. They do look fancy, however they are cheap in quality. Mine broke about 4 months after I bought them.. but what can you expect for something so cheap.. I would say They are some good glasses! Would definitely buy them again."
4.0,"I like it, Got a lot of compliments"
4.0,"This is very easy to read, day or night. But the controls are slightly confusing. The button labels do not always match the button function, causing confusion and frustration.<br />If this really is ""military-grade"" one has to hope we give them to the opposing army, so they will be too distracted to attack."
4.0,This dress is a beautiful color amd style but I had to return the 1st one and reorder because the 1st one sent to us has several snags. I was nervous about ordering another one but my daughter really liked this dress. She wore it for the 1st time for pictures and has worn it a couple times since then. There hasn't been any snagging of fabric.  Shipping was fast.
4.0,"Its cool that i can stash little things that fit in pockets. I dont go crazy so all i have is a sheathed tiny ceramic blade, small line of kevlar and a tiny plastic handcuff key. My only thing to note is sometimes the hat likes to loosen slightly so i reset my hat not so often. Its most likely my hair, my hair is really smooth and on the long side (ponytail). If i was bald then yes the hat would stay sit. I definitely wont be cutting off all my hair (nothing against bald, just not my cup of tea) but like the hat enough to use it daily."
4.0,I love the shorts but way too small. I normally wear a medium but I ordered large instead but still too small
4.0,Loop hinge a little tough
4.0,Nice quality- prettu
4.0,I bought 2 of these for my nieces that were graduating they both loved them.  They do
4.0,"Light weight and comfortable. Do run large. The pants run long. I don't mind because their pajamas. I would buy these again, great price."
4.0,These are really cute chokers but please be awake that there not children size.
4.0,This bra is super cute! It’s perfect to wear to a festival. It looks great on its own or paired with a kimono. The only complaint I might have is that it’s rather see through. If you’re small busted having something show underneath won’t be as much of a problem but if you have larger breasts it’s probably best to size up.
4.0,These are perfect and my son loves them!!
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife):<br />*This necklace is large, chunky and thus a bold look;<br />*The chain is relatively short;<br />*Looks great against a plain black dress or blouse;<br />*It's definitely costume jewelry and a bit cheap-looking (at $8.98 it's to be expected) but it's still fun and stylish;<br />*It comes in a gold-colored gift box."
4.0,The shorts are nice and comfortable and I like the pocket. They are a bit baggier than expected based on other yoga pants I’ve bought recently.  So if you’re in between sizes I would go down.
4.0,"I love this purse, however the little metal piece below the large buckle came off on day three, when I was just flipping open that strap!"
4.0,"I like them well enough. They are cute and comfortable; however, 4 pairs of earrings have the prints upside down and 2 prints are on one side only with the back a solid beige color. Out of 12 pairs of earrings, there are only 6 that I can actually wear."
4.0,I can't believe how many compliments I get on my super cheap little earrings! They make my whole head sparkle!
4.0,Love these socks!  They are warmer than most of my thicker socks with the exception of my Smartwools.  I only took off a star because they do pill quite a bit.  But the pills are easy to remove.
4.0,Very thin material which I dont mind. There were several loose bunches of threads I cut off. Ill update if it goes downhill after multiple washes.
4.0,Better than the last one I bought. Perfect size. Would recommend.
4.0,"This is the first harness bra/bralette that I've ever bought so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect & I was pleasantly surprised. The entire thing is one piece & it's made of bra strap material so it all stretches. There are no clasps so you have to slip it on overhead, which I would recommend doing carefully as I heard a subtle seam-ripping sound when I tried it on. There wasn't any visible damage but I'm going to be more careful with it. I'm a 36D & I ordered a medium, which fits me just fine. The outer straps that are attached to the top ring (above the boob area) are a bit big but if you wear it under a bra, it isn't an issue. Overall, for such a cheap price, I am very happy with it!"
4.0,"This was meant to be a present for my boyfriend. I loved it, but it did not fit him that well. I would say the size is more appropriate for a woman"
4.0,Works great!  I bought these for somebody else but they suited their needs.  I am a Buff user and thought these bands were almost as good.
4.0,"Love the dress,<br />Length was not too long (I’m 5’6)<br />Loved the pockets<br />It’s not thin material."
4.0,"This a very nice warm sweater and it's non itchy.  The sweater was bought as a layer for under a light coat, not for casual dress although it would be perfect for that as well.  The button holes are very tight at first, I feel they'll loosen up over time.  I bought the  XXL even though I wear XXXL because they said it ran a bit big, I'm 6'4 and 275lbs and the sweater fits me just fine."
4.0,was a little better than the dollar store sunglassesl
4.0,great picture.
4.0,Feel get to the body although the metal button scratches my waist line
4.0,"I am a big fan of front and back earrings.  The rod doesn't appear sturdy and looks like it might easily bend if I am not gentle and careful, but this is still a great deal for the price."
4.0,"Construction seems good quality.  I have no idea why other reviewers complain about it being hard to adjust, its the same as every other mesh bracelet I have ever had.<br /><br />As it turned out, this one was a bit too wide in my case, so I'll have to return it.  My watch has a spacing of 17.45mm according to my handy caliper.  This band is listed as 18mm, but I know they make them a bit smaller so they fit inside 18mm, so I thought I'd be okay.  Actual band width was 17.85mm, so that's my fault!"
4.0,"I am 5'6"", 150# and wear an XL.  1.  After washing/drying, this is true to size.  Will initially seem larger than you want.  Definitely will shrink in length and width.  2.  Check your seams before keeping.  I had a shoulder opening about 1"", but could easily repair.  3.  I would advise washing/drying this separately the first time.  Tons of lint had to be wiped out of the washer and then I had to empty the lint filter on the dryer which was filled. 4.  It is light-medium weight fabric.  If you keep your heat low in the winter, this may be too thin.<br /><br />Overall, I like the fit/feel and that fact that it has pockets to carry my phone in.  After washing/drying, is about 4"" off the floor and the sleeves come to my wrist with plenty of room in the body."
4.0,The color is nothing like the picture. It’s more of a pink purple than a blue purple color.
4.0,Great fit for my small face!!!
4.0,I bought this for a birth gift for my husband and he loved it! I wasn't able to find much info on the band length (we normally need to get him a longer band) but this one fit on the last hole. And it was a lot less expensive then the department store I originally viewed it in.
4.0,Print is a little different than shown but it is super cute!!
4.0,"I didn't read the description, they are stretch. Very comfortable, but I should have ordered a size smaller"
4.0,"I like the necklace a lot, but as a die-hard fan of Skyrim, I feel obligated to tell you that the symbol is not a Dinosaur. It is supposed to be Alduin, the dragon nicknamed 'World Eater' so please, check your facts before you go and sell anything. The necklace itself is very nice, and I wear it all the time. :-D"
4.0,Please make them bigger I’m tall and have a big booty a small waist extra-large is a bit too tight on me I will pay extra! Please please please make them bigger !!!!!!Love the style they make my booty look amazing but wish they had a bigger size!
4.0,They do what they are advertised to do
4.0,I like them. The only drawback is that the end is super tiny and doesn't like it stay in. Im sure I'll lose them all eventually for that reason. But the price was right and they sent a free one!
4.0,"Dress is beautiful but I got the navy blue one and it turned my pink gel manicure blue! Not my<br />Skin, just my nails! But I'm 5'7&#34; and usually wear a medium and that's what I got and it's true to size and has adjustable straps. And it has pockets!"
4.0,"Full disclosure, so I do not look anything close to those models on the product page, not EVEN CLOSE :). I am sorry but my toothpick legs does not do these 2-in-1 shorts any justice at all. However, the reason for the 4-star has nothing to do with the way my legs look LOL. It's a combination of things which I will try to point out here. Don't get me wrong, first of all, these are excellent shorts for running, workout or just lounging around the house, very, very comfortable and breathable even with the built in tights. The outer fabric is super light, thin and soft, mostly made of polyester and some spandex which will fly when you move and tend to stick to the built in tight, sometimes in an awkward ways, this is the first and main reason for the deduction. Love the green light reflector color back pocket zipper and drawstring, however, secondly, the drawstring is somewhat short and will be drawn back into the holes if you forget to tie a knot on the ends. The spandex tight is much longer than the outer short and super comfortable against the skin. Good size pocket on the inner layer for your phone or other personal items along with a zipper pocket at the back. Machine wash with tumble dry on low or just air dry very quickly with the water wicking fabrics.  Other than those two minor things, this should be a 5-star easily."
4.0,This dress is a cute for a young girl that wants something sexy.  If you are taller like me 5'9 you may find it too short for your taste.  It came mid-thigh on me and that's not my style.
4.0,A bit smaller than expected.. fits but is a little snug for my personal preference  Nice material.
4.0,"Color is good, but I wouldn't purchase if you're over 5'5. I'm 5'7 and they're a little too short. I'm going to have to wear shorts over them to hold them up under my costume."
4.0,"I liked the boots. I would have loved to keep them, but the top cut across my ankle."
4.0,"Love this! It is so adorable and comfortable. The only thing wrong was that it got a hole in the seam of the crotch after a couple of days & i had to sew that up. But overall, great purchase so far. My daughter loved it."
4.0,The earrings are great they just jingle annoyingly loudly
4.0,"It fits large and it a little stiff, even after a few washes with fabric softener."
4.0,Nice design and good quality material but runs a bit small.
4.0,Brought these socks for my trip last month. Very soft and comfortable.
4.0,I'm giving this crossbody 4 stars based on what I saw because I never used the bag.  I returned it because it wasn't exactly what I wanted.  The bag appeared to be well made of real leather (you could smell it).  Color and size were as described.  I would have kept and used the bag had it been what I wanted.
4.0,I bought this for my nephew and he loved it.
4.0,Does the job. Convenient and works on any surface.
4.0,"Really cute, great color.  Too cheeky for my body type, disappointed...had to return"
4.0,"This product is exactly what they say it is, the comfort level is great I highly recommend this product if u want a comfortable pair of compression socks. The price is the reason I gave them a 4star."
4.0,"I actually purchased this because I carry a small cross bag for ease through the airport.  I needed a slim wallet to hold 3 cards/id.  I needed something very slim that would hold only those things.  This fit the job exactly.  It was very slim.  However, if you have more than 4 things to put in it, this will not be for you.  I haven't had it long, so I don't know how well it will hold up, but it seems okay."
4.0,"A great buy, elegant finish. The only reason I did not give it a five star, is because the watch is alot darker than the photo.But overall, no regrets. 👍"
4.0,"I bought this for my vacation to Florida, thinking I would use it out by the pool. I used it there but also when I went to the spa, and when I went on an all day swimming adventure as my swimsuit cover up. Beautiful colors, nice and flows but still has weight to it, not too thin. Very happy with this purchase, will probably buy again in different colors."
4.0,"These seem to be very well made and fit well. The turtleneck is not bulky. I like the feel of the material and I like the colors. I have not washed these yet, but I am hoping that there is no shrinkage and the color does not run  (uncertainty is the only reason why I am giving 4 stars.)"
4.0,"Bottom line up front: Check the size chart.<br /><br />I like the shirt, the quality is good, but you must pay attention to the sizing chart. &#34;Knowing&#34; what size your son wears is not going to cut it. If you &#34;know&#34; your kid is a medium you will probably want an x-large. These things run much different than normal. The size chart lists it as &#34;Toddler-Youth&#34; and while accurate in inches is both much bigger and much smaller than you are used to. The size goes from XXS-XL. My scrawny average height ten year old is normally a medium, here he is an extra large. My 5 year old, normally a size 5 is now a small-medium."
4.0,The waist band was a a little to tight not as loose as a shirt would be
4.0,My girlfriend who is an avid dog lover was thrilled with it!
4.0,"Pretty. Dont expect it to be super soft because it feels cheap. I have no problem with that because I care more about its purpose than the material. Its still nice looking though. I got the purple and its more like a violet than purple.<br /><br />Im 5'8 and got the XL. I usually wear L, XL and 1X. The size is on point and the length is perfect."
4.0,It was good kurta. Ordered for friend. It was timely delivered. Hope it fit well.
4.0,The look is slightly cheaper than expected. I know they're clear plastic and you can't expect much from that but there's just something about them that aren't as high quality as I expected. I'm not super sure that I would have purchased them had I seen them in person first.
4.0,Warm and comfortable.  The color was a dark blue and not the black that I ordered.
4.0,The outfit is cute and fits nice.. It will be great 4 my trip to Punta Cuna..
4.0,Very cute! I was worried it would be way too big due to the fact it's only offered in a size 6 but I took a chance and it's only a little too big.
4.0,Nice Socks....
4.0,I love these but the glare is awful
4.0,"Cute fabric, cute skirt.  The cut of the bodice is odd.  There's a seam right across the breast, which makes it look like the lower half of your breasts are in an empire waistband, until you look at the backside and see that there isn't an empire waistband.  Then there are the folds above that seam.  Those kept coming unfolded all day, needing constant adjustment.  This probably won't get much wear.  I imagine someone with a smaller chest might not have this problem."
4.0,So buttery soft. I would say the material would be perfect for colder weather. Seems to be squat proof.  Would definitely recommend and will but again. I will keep the large but use them more for lounging around.
4.0,"The quality of this dress is very high. The material is thicker then I expected, however I think it helps make the dress lay better. Sometimes these styles can make you look like a big box. But this one definitely doesn't do that. However I would recommend getting a tan before you wear it. Otherwise the dress doesn't pop as much."
4.0,"Finding fire fighter jewelry for women is almost impossible.  I've wanted a charm for my pandora bracelet for a long time, and I couldn't find one I like.  The design of it is great and it fit my pandora just fine.<br /><br />There are a few spots on the charm that will tell you that it isn't officially licensed by pandora, but given the price, I wouldn't expect this."
4.0,A little small but none the less cute! Great price!
4.0,"Beautiful and soft, but hand washing suggestion and price discouraged me from keeping.  Plus decided I didn’t often wear long sleeves."
4.0,"This is the hat that I have been wearing this winter, because I like the the color, quality and way it looks.  The only downside is that I feel it could have been a little longer to better cover my ears.  When it's really cold, I'm always tugging it down on my ears.  Also, I am a small person, so it's not like I have an unusually large head."
4.0,Material is ok
4.0,I am in love with my necklace and have gotten many compliments already. I just wish there was more dandelion in it because it's hard to see there's only 2 pieces. But it's still beautiful and sentimental to me.
4.0,"I do like it, the design is definitely my style. The only reason I knocked it to 4 stars is the color. Black isn't actually black. It's a dark blue. That irritated me since it looks dumb with many colors... Black should be black!"
4.0,"Wore this for choir awards ceremony, cute and whimsical but too long- wish it were more ar or above the knee"
4.0,"Very nice set of belly button rings, each one is varied and unique plus they are very sturdy so you won't be losing your jewelry anytime.<br /><br />I really like how each ring is unique, there are many that are shiny and quite a few that have a matte appearance so there are looks for every taste. Plus every one is a different color so you can swap them out daily and match your outfit or other accessories if you wanted. I did include a picture of every ring it the set though so you can get a first hand look.<br /><br />I guess my major negative is that there isn't anything at all that separates this set from the various other hundreds of others out on the market really. As a personal preference I prefer the acrylic bars, but will still wear the stainless on occasion (which is why I did purchase this set). Finally a few of the stones are downright ugly, I'm not sure who chose to make them but I don't think they should have been included.<br /><br />Note I did receive this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own and are completely honest."
4.0,"I am 5'3"", 137lbs, and 39"" chest with a 31"" waist. The fabric is stretchy, light, flowy and soft (aside from slightly scratchy Seamlines/lace). The dress has a flattering cut, and fits well in the chest area while also retaining modesty which is actually very hard to do for my hourglass shape. Normally the cup area is too small or the v-neck is cut too low. I am super happy with this dress and highly recommend! I would also describe the color of this dress as a bubblegum pink."
4.0,"I'm very pleased with this product.  Having said that, it's important to know that the bracelet you receive will probably not look like the one in the photos - there, the beads are more navy in color.  The bracelet I got is a brighter, more vibrant blue.  I cannot speak to either its authenticity or its healing powers and honestly, that isn't why I bought it.  Saw the earlier comments about weak elastic being used and my bracelet seems to have a firm, thick cord and hasn't had any problems.  I love the size - tried the 8MM earlier and 10 is much more to my liking, so I'll definitely be getting more...!"
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, per other reviews they had used dryer with no issues. I found that the length shrunk when initially dried but have not shrunk more sense then."
4.0,Use this for daily wear. Very comfortable. Squared end makes it difficult to thread into belt loops. I trimmed the end but found that belt did not melt as easily as others I have used. After several attempts I was able to get a reasonably hard edge on the trimmed end. After several weeks I noticed the edge was fraying again. Will need to put  it to the flame again. If I buy again will not trim it again
4.0,The material is very comfortable and I like the style for casual wear.
4.0,Beautiful!  Fits well if you order 2 sizes up.
4.0,"I chose it because it looks like a gym bag and not an overnight duffel masquerading as a gym bag. Interior lining and pockets give it a touch of class. Outer zipper/end pocket works well for your shoes or damp items. I ordered the blue color which appears in the photo to be a brighter royal blue, but is actually dark and closer to a navy blue."
4.0,"So far these are the best of the ones I've tried. fit my face perfectly. heavy, but not too heavy."
4.0,"I love my my bags, but I thought they would have been bigger as in longer"
4.0,Nice comfy T-shirt!
4.0,Great looking good fitting and easy to wear!
4.0,"Really like this, seems true to size. Have worn it swimming quite a bit & is holding up well. A tad more blousy than I'd like, but overall it's great, really comfortable. If ur large chested, go up a size, cups r a bit small."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised by this bra.  The quality was better than I was expecting and it even had a pleasant smell right out of the packaging.  I was worried it would be a little small but actually it is a bit big.  I am hoping it shrinks a bit with washing.  It isn't particularly supportive but I expected that.  It is very comfortable.  I would give this five stars if it fit better.
4.0,"Nice looking hat, kind of bummed due to the hat being damaged during shipping but still works. Just a little bent is all."
4.0,Disappointed I received mine with a hole in the arm. I ended up returning it. Thin material but it is cute.  Would have been great as a light weight sweater for summer nights.
4.0,This was used on someone who is totally bedridden. The best use is after bed bath for warmth. I did not re snap it in back. Just left it open and like a blanket with arms. There is to much material to place it under someone. I did REALLY LIKE it
4.0,"Looks okay, but the pocket flap looks cheap. The arms are very short which I don't like, but some might."
4.0,Good fit and arrived quickly
4.0,"Love the style and length. I’m not too crazy for the fabric, it wrinkles."
4.0,I have mixed feelings as they look very cheap but work ok.  Small hands are not the best fit but they get the job done.  I didn’t find anything better so we will work with them.
4.0,This is a really cute shirt!  Great deal.
4.0,"Design is pretty, all of assorted decorative selections are nice, looks good on blouse and holds glasses well. Negative is the round ring that holds glasses broke almost immediately; it appeared to be make of plastic which broke easily, the rest of the brooch is metal so holds up well to wearing. I was able to replace the broken ring with an extra key ring I had which worked well."
4.0,The bottoms were shorter than I expected but the material seemed nice.
4.0,Bought for my daughter for mother’s Day. .She’s a new mom and it’s cute & practice.
4.0,This is beautiful! I haven't worn it yet but have great plans to wear it this Christmas.
4.0,"Very cute and beautiful color, however i am large chested the way it falls made me look like a potato"
4.0,It fits me great around my stomach but the top area not so much...if you got big tatas definitely size up
4.0,It arrived quickly and looked good. The size ran a little big for an 8 and sewn in cups were a little crushed. But over all for the price a nice dress
4.0,"Got these no show socks for my wife. She wears a size 6 and these are meant to fit sizes 5 to 9. They are very oversized for her. She did like that they are very thin, which translates to fitting really well with sneakers. All and all , good socks.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,Quality is decent.
4.0,Good quality.  Dark material hard to keep clean.
4.0,"Cute but Cannot use as a dress, there's not enough fabric. Must have leggings or something underneath. :("
4.0,if you got long legs expect this to be short.
4.0,"Really happy with this. It was a bit fighting drilling into my Ukulele. I have always resisted using power tools on my musical instruments. It is so much easier to play my concert sized Luna ukulele with this than with the hook and necktie style strap. If you struggle hold your ukulele as you try to play it, buy this.  Update... I still love my strap and just ordered a second one for another Ukulele. The strap is comfy, does not slip. The scary part was drilling a pilot hole into the Ukulele to screw in a strap button. :)<br /><br />Quality & Parts are different than their current image. Second update. I just received my re-order. The new strap is not as nice as the one purchased last time.The last 4 photos show the original strap (brown leather), next to the new strap (black). The fabric was sewn in the opposite direction and the adjustable buckle has been downgraded to no longer have the nice side grip (see photos). I expect the strap to be fine, it just was not manufactured as nice and has lower quality parts. It is a strap for a Ukulele so I expect and am sure will also work well."
4.0,Great for period wear I had many comments on the jewelry all positive. What wonderful little gifts. I love the hand.made pieces that really give it charm.
4.0,This is a very cute dress and fits perfect.  I am 5'10 and 170lbs.  I ordered a L
4.0,Jockey Pajamas
4.0,"it did not fit as I wanted but a few alterations to my under garments and it  fit fine.  love the length, but off the shoulder had to go to make it fit right I still is one of my fav outfits"
4.0,Wish they had other colors
4.0,Length and pockets great
4.0,This ring is so pretty. It is worth the few bucks I had paid for it and would order again. It runs pretty much to true size. It's been a few months and hasnt turned my finger . Very satisfied...
4.0,"The fit is odd. The body is the size you'd expect for a 10 but the sleeves are short. Not good for tall, slender kids. We won't get much use out of it for that reason, but at least he can wear it when his baby brother gets here.<br />The material is thick and design nice."
4.0,Love the weight ..fit perfectly
4.0,"Nice material, good quality."
4.0,"My son looooves his PJ Masks jammies, but they definitely run very small. He is a solid 3T in most clothes, and I bought these in 5T based on the reviews. After washing the 5Ts fit him perfectly. He'll be able to wear them for at least a few more months, but definitely not until he's 5!"
4.0,I only received the buckle which is of good quality and workmanship. I love it
4.0,Very nice gift.
4.0,"nice dress, well made. The sizes run a little small, but it is a great dress"
4.0,Great.  Exactly what I needed.
4.0,"The size As indicated, exellent materal,very light, the only thing is that the links turn on their own and lose a bit of aesthetics"
4.0,"Material is okay, I went ahead with a L because of some of the reviews I read said that it ran small. I should have gotten a M. I haven't worn it for the costume party yet, hopefully the people that reviewed it stating it doesn't stay on the shoulders are also wrong."
4.0,"This visor arrived on time actually early and in great condition.  I love the navy color.  It goes with most anything you wear.  I also love the American Flag you can see all the detail.  I will proudly wear this visor all the time to show my patriotism.  This visor does fit a little big, I took me a while to get it adjusted to the right size.  The end is easily movable to get the right bend in the visor.  It does adjust with velcro so i'm a little concerned how long it will stay &#34;sticky&#34;  I was given this product at a discounted rate to give me honest opinion."
4.0,This a a cute outfit! Bought it for vacation in Flordia. I thought the top part kinda fit a little oversized for the area. Definitely was a good buy tho!
4.0,"Lovely piece, fair quality, just wasn’t for me. Fits true to size."
4.0,"Or you could use it as motorcycle gear, your choice."
4.0,No draw strings
4.0,"Material is OK, numerous washings to soften them.<br />I've had better.<br />Wouldn't order these again."
4.0,Well pleased with product
4.0,"I would completely LOVE this wallet and use it everyday, IF it had a full spot for cash. But it is an awesome wallet thing and lightweight. Fits in front or back pockets. Holds passport and 4 credit cards/ID."
4.0,"I like butterflies so I bought It but, it doesn't come inside a box as pictured here"
4.0,"I love diffraction glasses and have many of them. I prefer the &#34;nerd style&#34; flip up ones like this one because you can flip them up to see normal and down for diffraction effect.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Low cost<br />-Much preferred over paper ones<br />-Fit comfortably<br />-Won't dissolve in the rain<br /><br />Cons<br />-For some reason both the normal lense and the flip up lense are both diffraction - unlike my other pairs where the normal lense is just clear plastic and the flip up lense is diffraction. This may sound cool because you get double the diffraction!... but in reality one diffraction lense makes it hard enough to actually see things around you - two makes it practically impossible. Looking through both makes it so really all you can see is light pigments, without being able to make out your hand infront of your face. That being said I found it was preferred to just have one diffraction lense, not two. To solve this, I popped the lense out of the fixed part of the glasses so when flipped up you can see normal and when flipped down you get the diffraction effect. I ended up using the extra lense that I popped out over my cell phone camera for cool video effects. It would be cool to incorporate this into a cell phone case.<br /><br />Overall it worked as I wanted it to. I would love to see a product like this that allows me to rotate the lense while I wear it so that the diffracted image can move without me having to tilt my head. Just a thought!"
4.0,The bag was late but it was a nice mother's day gift. This was a good size. very nice. oh
4.0,"I ordered two of these. One for myself and the other for a friend. I received mine via USPS. It's very cute, I've not yet worn it though. But I recommend."
4.0,Didn't fit my face to small
4.0,I wish these were bifocal. It helps with reading the phone but not the tv or computer.
4.0,"Very nice, looks much more expensive than it is--doesn't lay quite right but fine."
4.0,"It is a gift for my granddaughter! But looking at it it looks way to small, so we may need to exchange it for a different size"
4.0,Perfect dress for a night out in NYC. !! Comfortable and classy!
4.0,"Handsome watch and certainly appears to be far pricier than it actually is .... nice large face, handsome sub-dials, quality leather strap"
4.0,The socks were great. I wear a size 11 and might have been barely made for me. I would suggest a size 10 and below.
4.0,My wife liked these earrings and would have loved them if they were larger.
4.0,I wanted to share a photo but I really don’t wanna give camera in photo access so I will just say what I need to say. This nightie is really really cute and it fits wonderfully but the only problem that I ran into was when I washed it and it bled really bad… Even before I added detergent to the water.
4.0,I wore mine for 3 1/2 months before a ball popped off. I havent cut it so maybe thats why I'm having better luck. The bar is really long though and you can often see it through my shirt. Other than that these are great i just wish there were some cuter options or sizes that dont involve having to cut it yourself
4.0,It can be worn with any outfit and it doesn't look cheap.
4.0,"The Kangaroo Organizer has two pockets in the front for easy access to my coin and cash and small pockets inside for my cards. I like the pocket in the back for storage of papers, tickets, and lists that I don't want to lose. It also keeps my keys handy and my ear buds won't get lost. I am very pleased with this money belt. I think I made a good choice."
4.0,"They are lightweight, and comfortable. I don’t care for the zippers though; they are difficult to zip. You must  hold the fabric with one hand and zip with the other. The shorts are very roomy and I would suggest going with a smaller size, if you’re in-between. Not a high quality garment but good for just an every day type of shorts."
4.0,These are almost perfect. If the fabric were a Little more breathable they’d be just right !
4.0,Runs a little small. I had to loose a couple of pounds before I felt comfortable to wear this dress.
4.0,Love the scrunch
4.0,Was a little big but still loved it
4.0,"This suit is really adorable.  I am about 5 ft 2 inches and wear a size 14p pant and a 44DD cup.  I normally only wear one piece suits since I'm not a small girl but the way the bottoms of this suit are made to fit I still felt comfortable in this bikini...not overly exposed.  I purchased a 3xl and the bottoms were a great fit.  My problem came with the top.  The top is not made for a DD cup size.  No matter how I tried to position it I was either spilling out the sides or popping out of the front.  The padding was ample, which is nice, I just wish there was more fabric around it.  The workmanship was good quality...no crazy or loose stitching anywhere that I could see.  Still giving it 4 stars because I love the style and quality and I will definitely be wearing the bottoms this summer, I'll just have to find a black tankini or something to pair with it. Arrived in a nice little plastic zipper pouch.<br />Note: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,didnt' look good on me
4.0,"I have a 31in waist and bought a large. It fit comfortably and is a semi-shiny material (not super shiny, but there is some shine to it). I'm a rather straight figure and the elastic waist was not flattering for me since it's bunches a little at the waist. Otherwise it's good quality for unlined and pretty decently made (no random threads)."
4.0,i read from other reviews that this dress runs small. the fabric is textured which I did not know and it is a little thick and might be too warm in the summer. I am only 5' tall and it comes right at my knees and its perfect.
4.0,"These band came quickly & were comfy, but did not hold the watch tight enough to get accurate HR & other readings. Had to return."
4.0,Very soft and sexy! Top is very small if you are big busted...fits more like a crop top. I have size Xl
4.0,Comfy and fit perfectly.  The brown ones are a great shade and stay in place during my workouts.
4.0,Very nice Vest but unfortunately it was too small and not available in the same color in a larger size.
4.0,"Bought for my Autistic daughter, thought it was swimwear, we are still laughing months later about the snap crotch, this is a Bodysuit!!!!!"
4.0,"These rose hair clips are beautiful and beautifully made. Shipping was fast, it arrived 2 days early :)<br />The only down side was that the roses had strings of hot glue all over them..."
4.0,"Disliked the top of shoe box torn off, I'm assuming to fit inside the plastic postage bag. The size, feel, and color were ok."
4.0,Its slightly short but its fine.
4.0,Awesome earrings. Look great feel great. Only problem is after a month they starred turn copper
4.0,Not as great as the other purchase of this item I made that was really uplifting to my backside and form fitted to look great. Disappointing
4.0,"I like these very much.  They are very comfortable and fit very well.  They are advertised a &#34;Non-slide&#34; and this is partially true.  They work very well on carpet, but wearer should be careful on hardwood floors.  Overall, an excellent choice."
4.0,"Came with a battery, but has to be installed. Good looking watch for the price, and not a bad deal."
4.0,I love the fabric but these run big so you should order a size down from your normal size.
4.0,"Great quality, soft material. Runs a little big, but I can tie a side knot and it looks cute."
4.0,A bit too long for the size. I’ll have to alter the length by at least 3 inches.
4.0,"I really loved it, but  the cristal was scratched :("
4.0,"Great suit - just too big for me.  When I went to make an exchange the size I needed was gone.  This is a sexy suit, lined but no padding and moderate booty coverage."
4.0,"beautiful bows!  I'm only giving 4 stars (and probably should give 3, but the price point is so good) because one bow immediately came apart from the elastic (we haven't used all of the colored yet), and some of the elastics are hard and don't stretch-weird.  I would buy again because the bows are so pretty, and the price is great.  My daughter has always ripped out alligator clip bows, but doesn't mind one attached to her ponytail."
4.0,Ran a little smaller than I thought it would but it's absolutely beautiful.
4.0,"I really like the earnings, but they do not stay clipped to ear lobes. I really have to pinch a squeeze them so they'll stay in place."
4.0,"Found out after further research that some of this site's boots may say wooden buttons by &#34;Tina 02, Tina with buttons,  and Amy&#34;. I found that the wooden button Tina 02 has nicer details  and is an overall  better boot...this is the one I purchased in Tan color...not Chestnut.  Colors are close, however , the Chestnut to my surprise  is a lighter tan than the Tan pair. The Tan is a rich deep beautiful  colors as shown."
4.0,Great for a bridesmaid dress! True to size.
4.0,Definitely dog house proof gift
4.0,"Love the pattern! Fit just slightly bigger than I expected, but that's okay - better a little too big than too small. It's super light, and it catches the wind easily so watch out for those Marilyn moments!"
4.0,I love the flare and it’s light. Please offer in petite sizes as I had to cut off to hem. Way too long for me.
4.0,"The rope infinity charm appears to be excellent quality. Thick and strong and shiny. No sharp points or flaws that I can see or feel.  The bale is solid so it won't separate and release the charm.<br />The 18&#34; chain is another story. It is seriously tarnished already. To the point that it's actually a different color than the infinity rope...its a dark, matte gray. I even tried polishing it and it didn't help at all. Fortunately, I already had a nice shiny, sterling silver chain I can use because the rope charm can't be worn with the supplied chain.<br />Unfortunately, not being able to use the chain makes the price point on this set a little high as you'll need to buy a chain if you don't already have one. I've deducted 1 star for that reason. Hopefully the charm doesn't tarnish as badly as the chain."
4.0,Jackets nice. A bit loose around the waste but it is a jacket so makes sense. The Sherpa is actually really soft.
4.0,"Too small, cheaply made"
4.0,"Wanted something fresh and cute and this is it for warm summer days. Like the knit fabric, pockets.  Hope it washes well."
4.0,This is a delightful granddaughter present and it came quickly without excess packaging (environmentally responsible).
4.0,It was to small to use as a purse accessory that I needed to replace. It was too small so it will be used as a pendant.
4.0,"These are nice!  Much nicer than I expected from the price.  They're a good size (about a quarter inch across), shiny and sturdy."
4.0,"Not bad quality for the price. Seems warm. It's just very large and shapeless. If you're taller it may work well.<br />I'm 4'11&#34;, 105 pounds and busty, so it's very long, very baggy, and because I'm busty, it's even less form-fitting around my torso.<br />All in all, not a bad sweater, but if you're petite it may just be too big."
4.0,For my bf. He loves it.
4.0,Great fit. A little bit see thru...
4.0,"Item looks exactly like the stock photo shows and the material is soft. I was concerned it would not fit because the pieces looked so small upon opening the package but luckily it does.<br /><br />The top: If you don't have perfectly centered boobs, you will look weird in the top. The way the top is sown is why I have rated this item as 4 out of 5.<br />The bottom: Side ties make it easy to get in and out of. Still some room on the ties after adjusting to my size.<br />The stockings: The thighs do tend to roll down on me but I have big legs so that's a given.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />My measurements (in inches): 40-31-40. Thighs: 16 inches.<br />A PIC OF ME WEARING THE ITEM CAN BE FOUND ON MY BLOG (for a link, see my profile description)."
4.0,"Really liked the hoodie but size didn’t work. I paid $27.68 I had to hassle to get a response or refun. So frustrating, then after a few weeks they said they would refund me $15.00 yes $15.00 so they can keep the money and I’ll keep the hoodie. Will NEVER purchase from that company again!!! I don’t understand why Amazon would ever work with a company like that!"
4.0,This item was great  exactly what I needed I highly recommend it
4.0,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the original was never received even though it said it was delivered.<br /><br />Very elegant looking.  It looks expensive.  A good gift for my lady.
4.0,They are nice but sit really low on your face and allow light to come in from the top. I have a medium to large head and they fit great.
4.0,I like this shirt but it fits smaller than it should.
4.0,"Great quality and a great price.<br />My husband really enjoys wearing the sweatshirt in the cooler weather,<br />Especially since we live by the ocean."
4.0,Very nice and very comfortable.  I ordered according to the size chart and it's a little big (but better than too small). I wanted to order another in a different color but they are not available anymore.
4.0,Good one for such a price
4.0,The shaw is very fancy and delicate.
4.0,"Quality made jacket in this price range.  For $200.00 it seems like a great deal.  Wore it a few times now for aggressive mountain riding and it works well in the attack position.  The arms are pre-curved for this position and they are pretty stiff when riding upright.  It's not totally broken in yet, so this may improve.<br />Not designed for cold weather.  When riding my naked bike through 58-60 degree fog I get cold pretty quickly.<br />I'm 5'11"" 180lbs with fairly wide shoulders and I'd say that's the limit for a size large.<br />Definitely happy about the purchase."
4.0,"Sizing is close to true. Might be a little longer than normal. I bought a size 5. It is a touch too long, but the size 4 would have been too short. I wear a size 36 in pants. I don't wash the belt everytime I wash my gi. I may have washed the belt like twice now. It softened it up enough to hold a knot throughout class. There are a few stitches beginning to come loose. So far, the belt has been abused 6 hours a week for about 4 months now. Seeing as how you shouldn't plan on staying at yellow belt, I'm sure this one will last as long as I need it too, and still look good. I'll try the orange one next from the same company."
4.0,"To this point, these gloves have proven to be quite warm; however, I haven't worn them in negative temperatures yet. I bought them in preparation for the real winter that is to come. This is the reason I can't rate them at 5 stars in any category yet  They are quite thick which does make manipulating any object difficult. The touchscreen fingers do work but with the thickness of the gloves it is not very accurate so typing/texting isn't really an option unless you take the gloves off.<br /><br />Overall I am satisfied with the product for it's warmth and water resistance."
4.0,Very pretty and my only complaint would be the lever back closure seems a bit fragile.  Time will tell how long it holds up
4.0,"I'm 5'6"", 180 lbs, 38-D. I ordered an XL and if fit but I didn't think it was flattering on me. Came below the knee. Very comfy material."
4.0,Bought two pairs because I wasn't sure of the fit.  They are tight so I went with the bigger size!  :)
4.0,I am glad I bought it
4.0,It would be great if you had an extra small choice.
4.0,I purchased these gloves to wear to work . They fit perfect & they keep my hands  warm! & im still able to use my phone with them on!
4.0,"I used the measurements and was a little bit smaller on the top, bottom was nice. I ended up turning this into a skirt! I would order another one the order just one size up from the measurements if you're blessed up top like me! But I am a 36 DD. The material in this dress is light which makes it nice for wearing on warmer days. I would definitely recommend getting a petticoat to add the fluff without the Petticoat it will just kind of hang down and won't look right."
4.0,Item as expected. Good buy!
4.0,So far this belt is working perfectly. I bought it for when I golf and it makes minor adjustments simple. I would give it a five star rating but haven't had it long enough yet.
4.0,This dress fits like a glove. The material is stretchy and the weight of the fabric wasn't too heavy. It provided a flattering deep neckline. I am smaller on top than from the waist down so it looked good when I tried it on. It has a nice flare to it and it came just below my knees. The buttons didn't take away from the retro design of the dress. I don't why anyone would say it is a cheap looking dress. It is comfortable and made for someone with decent subtle curves. It does have pleat in the back of the dress right above the hop line. It can make the dress appearance look weird for someone with &#34;too much in the rear&#34;. It just has to be pressed just right.
4.0,I like the skirt but it is too tight across the middle.  I bought the biggest size offered.  I can wear it but it is uncomfortable.
4.0,"I wore this to a Christmas party and received many compliments, this is an excellent product for the $$. Can't say I expected it to last more than a few washes but it was less then $20 and totally worth it. It definitely does not look cheap."
4.0,Comfort after I cut the heel strap of nicely great price very happy
4.0,The T shirt print is nice and dark. T-shirt great thick quality
4.0,"Arrived in perfect condition.  Not constructed as well as big name brands, but these are a fraction of the cost.  Recipient loves them!"
4.0,"We got these a couple months ago.<br />Our nearly 18 m old kiddo has an older sibling, and through all of their normal daily activities, the shoes are already showing significant wear around the edge by the toes and heels. That being said, they are worn every day -ALL- day except when sleeping.<br /><br />I don't love the zipper, but that was a gamble I knew I was taking going into it. I like the easier slip on design of the previous pair. The leather on the previous pair (also worn every day) held up through three kiddos before it started to develop holes in the toes (it was a 12m size, so more crawling, which really seems to be worse for wear and tear in the tires especially). We were impressed.<br /><br />The first pair were worth the price. I'm a little disappointed to see the leather on these getting worn out faster than expected now that we have a walker.<br /><br />(Sorry the pictures are blurry. I foolishly thought I could take photos while they were being worn)."
4.0,I think it’s lovely. It’s a little flimsy so you have to be careful not to break it.
4.0,"Cute socks fit well granddaughter is 3yo size 8 shoe, they are thin you can see through them!"
4.0,"I have to rate 5 star. Love it. The color is what I wanted, fit perfect in me and the style is great. Got to order another one.<br /><br />Update! The hem is loosen up not properly done. They should put double stitches in there. I will update with pics soon."
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): These pants are stretchy and comfortable yet stylish.  The piping down the front of the leg makes the pants a more dressy and sophisticated than a normal pair of dress pants.  These pants can be worn on casual occasions or to work.
4.0,"Very well  made, just too small."
4.0,Love the charm.  The chain broke the second time I wore it.
4.0,"I love the color, seems very sturdy, will know more after some more use."
4.0,I bought these earrings to wear with a multi-colored dress on my cruise. I paired them with some sling backs of the same color. I was able to wear these earrings multiple times during my cruise and received so many compliments. I am not technically speaking suppose to wear costume jewelry due to the fact that my ears will breakout but I think I will see what other colors I may like to purchase for a future cruise or event.
4.0,"Dint think it had purple in it, Oh well"
4.0,The torso is too small for me. I’m 5’7. It fit my friend just fine though and she’s 5’5. Material looked good and design was nice. Too bad it didn’t fit.
4.0,I love these pajamas they’re cotton the bottoms are very soft and very lightweight and the top is well-made and is a little on the heavy side very impressed with this it fits as expected
4.0,Nice...very clear and light weight.
4.0,There's a tassels on each side of the front which you pull to unzip 2 pockets. One tassels broke away after  day of using the bag
4.0,Love the print and design of the shirt but was disappointed that the shirt ran a little smaller than the size it was supposed to be so I haven't had the opportunity to wear it yet.
4.0,very snug fitting across bustling. high quality fabric. arm holes are not tight so good for athletic activity.
4.0,"This is a high quality shoe horn that works well from a standing or sitting position. It is a pleasure to use on a daily basis, with the brass and wood combination. The only downside is a long shipping/delivery time. If you can wait, recommended."
4.0,"Good product, my daughter loves it. Thanks"
4.0,Brought this as a thumb ring. It’s a nice ring. I don’t think it’s real turquoise. The price isn’t meant a real stone. Still it’s a nice costume piece. :)
4.0,"The fabric is soft and light. Beautiful colors and perfect fit. I am slim, size 2 and small fit perfectly. Love the pockets. Can dress up or down. Love it!"
4.0,Bought this dress for my 10 year old daughter to wear on our beach vacation coming up. Fits great (covers everything) and isn't too thin. Gave 4 stars bc the bottom had light fraying but it's nothing I can't fix.
4.0,"Warm, but not very high quality. Definitely worth it for the price!"
4.0,Nice leather but this gaps a bit more than expected and holds less than expected. Not bad but overall I'd rather go with one of the old squeeze gel plastic versions despite the extra nice leather.
4.0,Be aware it completely see they so you need something underneath but still cute for a beach cover up
4.0,"I really like this top. It's cute and since the bottom flairs, it is really flattering. However, this is not a true medium unless you wear a medium in juniors. I do not wear a junior medium. I wear a ladies medium. It's pretty thick and will keep you warm on a cool day-not really cold, just cool. I really wish it was bigger so I could wear it rather than having to give it to my 100 lb. daughter."
4.0,I was bored wearing my black N95 masks so I bought this one to wear over it. I like it!! I would not wear this alone as it is made out of cloth and has no nose wire but it is great as a second mask.
4.0,I liked this and the price was right. I wish it had a snap so you don't have to take your belt off to put it on.
4.0,"Nice color, nice soft fabric, very flattering. I give a 4 because i find it a little too long, i m 5'6 and it goes between my bottom and me knees...3 inchs shorter for me would have been a 5! But if you wear it with a legging I guess it would fit better than with a skirt which is a little weird.  But great shirt and confortable. I bought two and no regrets at all. I specially love the dark blue one."
4.0,I’m satisfied with the Items my sons loved them thx
4.0,I am a size 2 so it was a little big. It is super comfy and the fabric is soft.
4.0,I definitely should've got the xl instead of the large and the jeans aren't really distressed it's more like someone cut holes in them with a pair of scissors
4.0,Great product for the price. It doesn't look cheap and will add  to the elegance of my wedding dress.
4.0,"This is perfect plastic ring sizer .  Contained together, light and functional.  I used it for jewelry making, but great for any need to ring size.  Great price, and the product holds it's shape and value.  I would purchase this item again, and recommend for purchase."
4.0,"I really love this shirt because it’s very unique. The fit is exactly as expected if you use your measurements and follow the sellers size chart. The material of the shirt is nice, it’s not too thick or thin. The shirt is made with quality there are no loose strings or uneven stitching. The only problem I have with the shirt is that I ordered black but what I received isn’t what the picture shows. The shirt I received in the color black is more of a dark grey or dark charcoal it’s definitely not what is shown as the black in the picture. I did double check and my package had the color listed as black but it’s definitely closer to grey in color."
4.0,"Nice an thick so they don't cut you hand pulling your boots tight.  They are a little too stretchy, but still okay.  I'm used to ones with no stretch."
4.0,Great for working might of gone up one size though
4.0,Oh my God I'm in love with these bring the sexy out
4.0,"Good quality pants!<br />The fabric is rather thick for summer but excellent for cooler days.<br />I am 65 . 5 kg,  5&#34;4 , I ordered size L and they fit well in thighs but slightly large on waist. But i have this issue with most of the pants since my waist is thin compared to hips. If i loose 2,3 kg they will look a little baggy which i actually like.<br />They are slightly high waisted but don't look like granny pants. Good for those who wants to hide their muffin top.<br />Overall i like this pants."
4.0,My Mac fits perfectly. I think I will keep it for transport. Nice color. I am happy with it.
4.0,This is perfect for the event I’m attending. Sparkly and sweet!
4.0,I gotten this for a Disney Bounding that I would be doing some time.
4.0,"Satisfied, they fit the slide letters I have."
4.0,"Very cute and look very warm, but very small. 😒"
4.0,Too short to be worn with leggings but a nice top to wear with jeans.
4.0,"I’m busty so I returned this because the neck line wasn’t flattering on me, but the overall shirt was nice."
4.0,"I'm a size 6/8 and have a 29"" waist. So I bought the large based on the idea it fit a 30"" waist and it was HUMONGOUS.  I ran out of time to send them back so I'll wear them but it wound up being like 2 sizes too big with the stretch.  If you're on the bubble size down.  The waist is filled with elastic."
4.0,Just a little oversized
4.0,"I gave this item 4 stars because this kaftan is beautiful!!  But dang it, too small for this BBW"
4.0,"Dress fits well and the sizing chart is accurate. A callout is that some of the stitching is messy, for example, the stitching right over the bust, in one of the most noticeable places a stitcher could make a mistake, is double stitched and messy."
4.0,The neck is large. Just ok for me.
4.0,"I wore this to a luncheon and got dozens of compliments! It is a little had to put on, zippers in the back are actually easier than the side when you have large breasts, I have found."
4.0,Nice and shiny...what I needed to find in my purse!  I like the two hooks that separate keys and a big remote for the car.  Works for me!
4.0,"Kinda cuts your circulation because they roll up quite a bit. However, they sure are compression sleeves"
4.0,"Nice size for price. I wear in the second hole and they look good, I would recommenf for first hole."
4.0,Great quality nice and sturdy glasses for my toddler!
4.0,"I bought these because I have a similar pair, but they were Capezio. However, they didn't have any in my size, so I purchased these instead. These are very soft, and fit well, but they are also very thin."
4.0,I wanted a hoop earring for my conch piercing and it’s been pain in the a*# for me to get the right size. These hoops are little big but I don’t mind. Good earrings.
4.0,"These things work.  I have vitiligo (body is losing melanin, leaving white patches, like ozone holes on the skin!) and it's important to block UV rays when I'm gardening.  These sleeves DO keep my arms cooler and keep the rays off my skin.  Plus, they're pretty."
4.0,Very dainty and very cute. My only suggestion would be to remove the charm and put it on the end of the extender chain for some weight so that when you have it tight it doesn’t bundle up in the back..
4.0,The hoops fall out sometime because how they close but the earrings are beautiful.
4.0,"I love it but I'm short, so it's too long."
4.0,"Extremely lightweight, but very soft. Machine washes and dries beautifully."
4.0,I love it. Fits nice. It's what I expected
4.0,To cute for words
4.0,"Nice and long for me at 5'9"" and cute style."
4.0,Love how cute they are. Just a tiny bit snug
4.0,Light weight and dark lenses as expected.the only cons were little glue on the lenses but nothing that a cleaner couldn’t solve and some glare inside the lenses whenever the sun hits.Besides that I love the sunglasses and I will keep it!! Thank you
4.0,Fairly soft Hanes tee shirt. It's a great print quality. Fits as expected. A more comfortable shirt like Next Level or Tultex would have made it 5 stars.
4.0,just as expected. great gift!
4.0,"A little smaller than it looks in the pic, but still very nice and stylish!"
4.0,I liked the overall size and shape of the bag but didn't really care for the feel of the material.  it has lots of nice pockets inside.
4.0,Perfect!! Didint give five stars because i havent worn them in cold yet
4.0,nice quality and quick shipping
4.0,"Nice quality, and pretty warm."
4.0,"This is a fun and comfortable outfit. I am 5’2, 125, 32DD and the small fits great. I originally ordered a medium based off of the reviews saying it runs small. The medium was too baggy however the straps are not adjustable and the pants are on the shorter side. If you are taller, order a size up. The material is very thin so it does not hide any lumps or bumps. It is also somewhat see though when you bend. I attached a picture so you can see this. I am wearing this in the Caribbean so it’s not a big deal to me."
4.0,It is every bit as lovely as shown in the picture.  The crystals really sparkle.  I give new & different Christmas pins each year to friends and this crystal tree got rave reviews.
4.0,"Great fit, good quality, everything I was looking for."
4.0,It looks just like the picture. I brought it in medium and it fit very tight so I will send it back and buy a large. But I love the outfit so much i brought both colors.
4.0,For a second hole and love.  The only negative is the post could be longer.
4.0,"I ordered a size up and it's a little big so these are true to size for women, not pre-teen shaped women"
4.0,I really like this piece..came pretty fast so i was excited about that.the clasp on mine is really sturdy i like that so it should last me awhile i gave it 4⭐because i just wish it came a lil longer.but other than that it's a good buy and for the price . .get one!
4.0,"is the best looking watch that i have.. and i have quite a few... just superb... for a swiss watch i think it worths the price... the only problem that i can tell you is that it doesn't come with saphire window (that's why i gave 4 stars), but i realy don't think this is such a big deal.. at least not for me... i'm extremily careful with my watches.."
4.0,"The shirt is soft and comfortable and it does the job (I bought it for breastfeeding and the buttons go low enough that it works great for that). The fabric is thinner than I expected and the seams and quality is a bit cheap. But it works. I am overall happy with the purchase but feel it is overpriced. I am 5’7” and 155lbs and ordered a large. It is nice and baggy to hide my postpartum belly, but not particularly flattering."
4.0,I love the watch! Just having a little trouble getting it to 12 hour.. but all in all great
4.0,"It’s ok . A little thin and a little short . Haven’t worn it yet but good for the price. Usually 10/12, medium fits good ."
4.0,Zippers get stuck and it's not as big as I was hoping. But has nice storage pockets.
4.0,My niece loves John Cena good material
4.0,"I love this pendant; I purchased &#34;white&#34;!  The pendant is simple yet so very pretty!  The chain is comparable to a &#34;clear fishing line&#34; which still really suites my simple, unique taste; and fits perfectly around my neck. Great with a white t-shirt!"
4.0,I ordered size L since I am curvy. The material feels good and overall the bottom fits well. It's Brazilian style so you definetly show your back...
4.0,Top is a little longer than pictured but that is ok.
4.0,Not meant for anyone larger than a B cup- otherwise beautiful
4.0,Too big for my face  they nice for a younger person
4.0,This is a great belt bag.
4.0,"This is a gorgeous, well-made sweater. The colors are vibrant and vivid. The material is soft and luxurious.  The problem is the size. Definitely get a once size larger from what you would get.  It fits snug.  The collar stands up when put on but does sit easily when put down.  The jacket is warm, pretty and form-fitting.  For skiing, a great idea, but, again, get a size larger."
4.0,Nice but a little balky.
4.0,Loved the colors my daughter loves unicorns
4.0,a little on the to short side but are comfortable
4.0,"Had a problem with the first shipment getting lost, but the replacement order was delivered in 2 days, so very happy because I was using them for Christmas gifts, and very happy I did go with the replacement instead of a refund because they are very beautiful and very easy to work with.  I will purchase from this seller again and would recommend them."
4.0,The dress is a deep red color. Very flattering fit. Nice fabric.
4.0,The top us really nice.  Vibrant color.  The one issue i have is the sleeves seem a little short.  But not so short its not wearable.  I just like my sleeves longer.
4.0,Love them but one didn't look good at all<br />Made me sad
4.0,It's not superb but fills expectations. Like it. May be too long the leaf for my neck.
4.0,"Some what tight, but I am very happy with the design! Very stylish and cute."
4.0,Very cute - fit larger than expected but he will grow into it. Ordered for a 13 month old.
4.0,I like the jacket but the sleeves are a little too short.
4.0,Lo compe para mí hermana y le gusto.
4.0,"I ordered this on sale for $12. It’s nice to throw over a fitted shirt or tank top. It’s like t shirt material, not flowy or silky. I like it for a casual cover when I expect it to be colder inside when I’m going somewhere. I would not think the $40 list price would be worth it but if you can catch it on sale it worth the purchase."
4.0,I love the ring its very niceley detailed although a little lighter weight than i thought .but fits perfect<br />.
4.0,Very comfortable but would have preferred elastic waist to tie waist.
4.0,Very nice appearance... good deal for affordable jewelry...Thanks
4.0,The size was fine for 12 shoe w/wound gauze
4.0,Very nice hat and survived the travels well.
4.0,Like them<br />Thank you
4.0,"Good quality and none were broken. But like some others, the colors I got were off. I got 3 oranges, 2 that were black and green and one that was purple and clear."
4.0,Love the fresh style. Chic!
4.0,"Reading the reviews and people saying what all it would hold, I thought it would be bigger. Much smaller then I expected. It was a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. It's very pretty and well made."
4.0,It fits the occasion
4.0,It works for me and will accomplish the use I have for it. I only bought it because I did not want to carry a large magnifying glass
4.0,"I love this piece! It’s not heavy at all, and it’s the perfect statement necklace for my outfit."
4.0,A really cute item but it does run quite small so I ordered a few sizes up.
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress, I got a large and it is huge on me. There is a lot of sideboob going on, and the back is also loose."
4.0,Bought a pair just like this with shorter cuffs which are a bit annoying so I bought these longer cuff gloves. These seem a bit tighter than the other ones but these are also a bit thicker in material so do a better job of blocking the wind.
4.0,"Nice pants, material and color. Run very small though so had to return."
4.0,Product quality is very good. Soft and comfortable and feels very good to use in cold weather. The touch fingers are fat so can't use in precision in devices like phone.
4.0,"This swimsuit is cute but it is cut high in the front and back. It almost reminds me of the loincloth bottoms that are popular right now but it does cover a bit more. I don’t like my suit cut so high my stomach is showing and this does that. I am 5’4”, 118 Lbs. I am usually a medium in a 1 piece which is what I order here. It seemed to fit as it should. Even going down a size would not have helped with the cut."
4.0,"This chain is a very nice THICK DURABLE stainless steel chain. Like most people I ended up getting the frosted chain instead of the polished chain they advertised in the picture. To polish the chain yourself you will need to buy some ""Mothers  Mag & Aluminum Polish"" to polish this chain. The sell the polish here on Amazon. Without machine tools this process will take a while. I had to do it by hand. But it was worth it. I highly recommend this stainless steel chain."
4.0,"I really like the bottoms, super comfy and good fit.  The top is a disappointment.  I am a plus size, 5'7''-270lb large busted woman so most tops are a let down.  This top fits across the bust but barely hits my waist so it's way too short.  I would probably order again just because of the bottoms."
4.0,Nice simple wallet. Quality material.
4.0,My granddaughter loves JoJo and these slides were also the perfect color for her! The slides were good quality and she says they are comfortable. I gave them 4 stars because the printing on the footbed of the slide looked like it had rubbed off in the same spot on both slides. I am sure that was not a big deal to my granddaughter .
4.0,Unique design with ruffles on the sleeves. Comfortable to wear although the material is a little thin. Still good price for what it is..
4.0,"The color is very cute and design is fun, but the sleeves kind of just stick out and the waist was a tad too loose. I am definitely keeping the dress for the overall appearance of it, and I think some ironing can turn the sleeves down. Also, I am in in-between size person, so M is too small and L is too big; to be fair to the dress, it cannot be in the middle of two sizes."
4.0,"I ordered a T120 for my 4.5-year-old daughter, who is between 4T and 5T at Carters/Gap/etc. It's a little too long, but I'm keeping it since I know she'll grow into it. It's a very pretty pale pink. The fabric isn't quite as soft/thick as the Capezio flutter-sleeve dress, but it's lovely for the price."
4.0,If you are right on the edge go the next size down Shorts run large. I'm always pulling the XL up.
4.0,Nice for the price. I have a 32 waist and bought an xxl according to the tag for room in the booty and balls
4.0,Never got the sandals they didnt have my size was disappointed.they was so cute.and the price was very good.
4.0,These are my wifes
4.0,"I love it &#60;3 it needed a new chain because the one it came with was both silver and irritated my skin but that was an issue easily solved XD. the item is great for its price, not to mention the box it comes with is really cute :3"
4.0,"A very nice watch: light-weight, simple and accurate. Dial light could be a bit brighter, but it is not too bad. One thing I did not realiize prior to purchase: the instructions state the watch is merely water resistant and should not be use for swimming. Still, I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Just fit. Was expecting a little bit larger, but it still fits."
4.0,"Very pretty, lace has great detail and is of great quality. I however ordered a little big. I thought that I may need an xl as I am a us 12 but no, I needed a large instead. It works though and fits fine but would be better a little tighter on the body. It is certainly too shear to post a picture. I love the hot pink it is really vibrant and I like that the straps come down on the shoulders. The thong was a no go, it was so huge that I cracked up laughing and tossed it out. Overall I am happy with this piece and it really is nice and detailed. Looks exactly like the picture. I received this item at a discount for my honest review.  ( I am 5'6'', 170 and chest is a 36D I recommend in that size range go with a large)"
4.0,Cute swimsuit. Thong is a little uncomfortable because it’s thick
4.0,Looking forward to using them.
4.0,"Band is nice. However, the description and picture don’t match. I received the wrong one the first time. Order by description, not the photo."
4.0,Great Scottish tie! I liked it a lot!
4.0,Really Like the clarity of the lenses. Not sure how they will hold up they feel somewhat fragile but they are cheap. That’s what I wanted so it wouldn’t matter when I lost or broke them.
4.0,Nice finish.  The only improvement would be to make it double sided so it could be hung like a real street sign.
4.0,This is a heavy thick leather belt. The belt buckle part has a sort of industrial look to it because of the grooves. It has red accent stitching which makes it look more like a casual belt. The thickness if the leather makes it feel like it will last a long time.
4.0,Great colors--classic rugby look.  Fit is exact.
4.0,"I love the print on this dress.  It's actually too short for me to wear comfortably for work, but I use it as a beach cover-up or around the house and it is perfect for that.  I have washed it a couple of times(hung to dry) and there still is somewhat of a dye smell.  I wish it had been a couple of inches longer so I could have worn it to work on a hot summer day!<br />2018...I got a pair of coral/pink capri leggings that I wear under the dress and it looks really cute.  I feel comfortable wearing it now in public!"
4.0,"So far, I am quite pleased with this product. I have been wearing this bracelet for a couple of weeks, and no stones have fallen out. Also, it is much less gawdy/obvious than some other cz faceted shamballa bracelets that I've seen. I would recommend this to others."
4.0,This was too small but it was adorable. Had to return.
4.0,They keep u warm
4.0,It’s pretty and I do wear it. Know that even with the underwire there is zero support. Seems true to size but gets stretch out the more you wash it.
4.0,I purchased this bag for my mother and she loved it. Quality is good. Very happy with the purchase.
4.0,My daughter loves it. Only complaint is it didn’t have the front pocket you’d expect with a hoodie and that the Print begins to peel after a few washes
4.0,"I'm a full C cup and I normally wear 34 C. After reading reviews that said the straps run short (they are not adjustable). I was hesitant but decided to try it. It fits just right in the length (even though I am only 5 ft tall I have a long torso and straps are typically tight/short on me). I think the rest would have fit better (across the breasts and the torso) if I had gone a size smaller but then the straps would have certainly been too tight. It is a little large across the bust and the lace puckers a tiny bit but not bad. The looseness could be because I took out the cups. I cut off the little rhinestone dangle since I am looking for a very smooth, comfortable &#34;cami type feel&#34; just to keep my nipples from showing through my t-shirts. The seam runs right over the nipples from top to bottom which does camouflage the nipple but unfortunately isn't as smooth as I would like. This is a decent comfortable bra that I can wear while I continue my search. A sports bra is perfect smoothness but too thick and hot under clothes. A cami is too long with material around the waist. My search for stretchy sheer cool smooth lace ending just under the bust, that is tight around the torso but long in the straps continues, meanwhile I have purchased a few of these in different colors to hold me over."
4.0,A real bargain ...the watch is awesome and the price can’t be beat.  The only drawback is that is difficult to read the time in low light situations.
4.0,"a little on the large side and a little long, but cute enough."
4.0,Great product I bought a size medium top fit perfect (36B) however the bottom fit somewhat small felt little tight. Had to return it probably could of gone with a Large
4.0,The glasses are great even though I realized that they were oversized once it shipped. Received compliments at work on them. Most importantly the glasses help with my eyes so much when staring at a computer all day.
4.0,It came out to what I wanted its great the length was perfect sterling silver/ silver
4.0,"I'm always in the search for good, cheap sunglasses. My brother-in-law always gets polarized glasses, swearing by the anti-glare and how much better they are than regular sunglasses. Therefore,  I decided to give these a try.<br /><br />Pros:<br />What I like about them is that they seem to be well made. While the arms are a little thin, they don't seem like they would be easy to break. Also, I enjoy the mirrored lenses that I ordered. They fit my face well and sit snug and comfortably.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Despite being &#34;polarized&#34;, they still have glare on them from either inside lights or the sun. This is disappointing because it was the main reason I bought them.<br /><br />Despite the glare, I still feel like this is a good purchase. They look good and feel great on my face. Plus they don't break the bank. Just don't go in expecting these to reduce glare from outside and inside lights.<br /><br />*I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review"
4.0,They are too big runs big
4.0,"Very cute. Buy a couple sizes up! Trust me! I usually wear a small in jackets, and the reviews convinced me to get a large. I was not disappointed. The jacket fits me like a small, and it is even a bit tight on my shoulders now. Great jacket, warm, nicely quilted, but get two sizes up at least!"
4.0,"I love this coat. It looks much more expensive than it is, and it seems very well made. However, I cannot wear it. It was too small in some parts and too large in others. I feel like keeping it and having a dressmaker make me one just like it, only one that fits me perfectly, but I think I'll be sending it back, instead. I really hate to do so because it's warm and lovely. The only reason I deducted one star is because of the fit. The coat itself is beautiful."
4.0,"Buttons are in a weird spot and hurts the top of my ears when I’m wearing a n95, surgical mask and face shield."
4.0,"These are really cute! The metal is a little thinner than I thought it would be but could just be because I did not look at the measurements and actually measure it out, but does not take away from how sweet they are! Can't wait to give mine to the bf for Valentine's Day!"
4.0,Good quality for a small price.
4.0,It was beautiful but just to small for my daughters nose and was uncomfortable. It was a shame we had to return it :(
4.0,"Well made, fits my sunglasses perfectly, and comfortable."
4.0,"My young so  gave this to his girlfriend, and she lived it! Pretty piece...<br /><br />Thank you!"
4.0,Bought it for my best friend and she loved it
4.0,"I ordered according to my measurements instead of the size so I bought a 3XL. I have a 50” bust, 40” waist, and 50” hips and it fit perfectly. I like that the hem hits just above the knee. The fabric is a little thin but I plan on using this as a layering piece this fall! So it’s perfect."
4.0,"This review is for : DoSmart Aviator Polarized Metal Frame Sunglasses Uv400<br />I do a lot of fishing and outdoor activities in which the aide of polarized lenses benefits me greatly.  I also like to remain stylish when I'm out and about just in case...  These mirrored Aviator sunglasses which are designed in classic style are great for both of my needs.  The lenses are made of a lightweight plastic and not extremely heavy like a glass lens would be, the sit well seated in a lightweight chrome/stainless steel frame.  They are deeply tinted so you wont have to worry about loosing some vision to sun blindness.  The polarization of the lenses works great, I wore these fishing on several trips in which having a polarized lens is helpful as it severely cuts down the glare on the top of the water and allows me to see through the first few feet to look for my targets and see structures under the surface.  I wore these and compared them to my name brand fishing glasses I generally wear and the level of polarization is about the same.  They rest comfortably on the nose and wrap about the ears, as I said they are lightweight and despite the darkened lenses you hardly notice them at all. They also come with a handy included protective bag but this is nothing more than bag to prevent scratches on the glasses not a clam shell style of care.  They also come with a microfiber cleaning cloth, to remove your greasy fingerprints from them.  Great Shades!<br /><br />I received a discount on the purchase of this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,These sweaters run bigger than advertised be advised.
4.0,"It is a little tight, other than that I like it."
4.0,It's a little large
4.0,It is a great purse and exactly what my daughter-in-law wanted.<br />I have to give it only 4 stars as it really smells strongly of leather and she's not been able to use it. We're hoping the smell will decrease or go away.
4.0,😕 Made in China....
4.0,Everyone loved this cute fun shirt. Great for an office setting.
4.0,"Cute, different from pictures."
4.0,This sweater is very comfortable and versatile.  The color was a little different then the picture but it's still very pretty!
4.0,Great dress for work!  I am 5'1&#34; and weigh 105 and the small fit perfect! I might get another one in a different color!
4.0,"Fits true to size, good color."
4.0,My wife likes this piece. It has performed well the few times she's worn it. Really nice costume jewelry. Took quite a while to arrive from China.
4.0,It fits good and seemed to wash up fine.  For the price was well worth it. Might get another one.
4.0,Cut sleeves off made it screen accurate then sold it for 300
4.0,This is very cute and lightweight. This will match most fall tops because of all the colors in the pattern of the sleeves! Sleeves are a little tight in the shoulders area and long in the arms but overall fit is generally as expected.
4.0,I like this cute prism necklace. I love small pedants. So it is no surprise this is one of my favorite necklaces now. But it is a lil bit pricey to be honest!
4.0,XL is 4 inches short for an 11 size shoe or sock  get  XXL for size 11  2x 3x  no better
4.0,My favorite tote.  I'll probably buy another one in another color.
4.0,You get what you pay for 4 stars because you can’t expect much from a cheaper grill I'd say this is great for a hollowed costume or something small but don’t flex this grill it won’t work lol.
4.0,"Great belt.  Smooth bonded leather and alloy buckle.  The buckle itself was about 1-3/4&#34; thick which is a little thick for my taste but not something to be hung up on.<br />Fast shipping: ordered on a Thursday expected it the next Thursday, instead it shipped to Hawaii *first class* and arrived on Monday."
4.0,"Super cute socks of pretty good quality, but there was a pattern irregularity on one of the socks (see photo)."
4.0,"The dress is made of really good material. My only problem was it was extremely difficult to put the dress on by myself. The fit was easy to adjust because of the tied back but it was impossible to get in and out of without help. Unfortunately, I had to return it."
4.0,"Very comfortable, good quality. I'm returning for the next size larger bc I like a looser fit."
4.0,"Take the care tag seriously. I put this through the washer and dryer and it completely fell apart. It said ""Hand wash recommended, do not tumble dry"" and I just tossed it in the washer and dryer like a regular t-shirt.<br />It fell apart. Which is sad because it fit great and I loved it. My fault for not reading the care instructions.<br />My four stars are based on the one time I got to wear it before I ruined it. LOL."
4.0,"These shoes are cute, but initially fit small. I liked them a lot once I broke them in. The leather finish definitely does not look like leather, but I still like them a lot and get lots of compliments on them."
4.0,"I like the look of these shoes, but they are entirely too big!"
4.0,"What I mean is that this does catch the hair, but the part that is around the shoulders falls. This does not get in the way of it catching hair but is annoying. Another important thing to note is to make sure if you need to change anything have it close and ready. If not you are having to take it down, get what you need, then set back up."
4.0,What I was looking for but the material is thin.
4.0,The red in the carbon fiber was great but the red that was on the links in between was more of a cranberry color. My husband was happy with it though. Not sure if I would by it again. Not sure what the whole point is with the magnetic part though.
4.0,They are very delicate but nice
4.0,"Overall, great boots.  My only suggestion is they seem to run a bit small even though I ordered a half size larger.  It would be great if they came in wide widths."
4.0,"Only reason not a full 5 , is based on the top of the mask has its seem that cuts under the eyes and is bothersome to me.. love the draw string gathering up at top though."
4.0,"Shirt is just a little bigger than expected, still fits nice. Super comfy"
4.0,"I have this bag in 2 colors, navy and black.  Love everything about it except for the gray edging along the black leather cross body strap.  This gray edging is not on the short strap.  The Navy bag has a light blue edging on the cross body strap, no edging on the short one.  These bags are very versatile, can be used with jeans or heels and dresses.  I am really happy with the gold hardware, so tired of the gunmetal hardware on expensive leather bags.  I really don't mind the light blue on my navy bag, sort of mind the gray on my black one, kept them both."
4.0,"These pants are amazing! My legs are just too short for these to be capris on me lol. Otherwise, 100% satisfied"
4.0,This was a good product but runs somewhat large. I had to return it. I recommend getting a size smaller.
4.0,"nice product, chain could have been a little thicker and adjustable for length. Wife was very happy with it other wise"
4.0,"Nice bathing suit, bra cup is a bit on the smaller side, but overall fits nicely! Also, I was expecting to get the blue and black and received a green and black one..? Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars."
4.0,"Love my studs but the backs don’t fit tight, so I have to keep checking them.... Do t want to lose these babies"
4.0,Nice quality. Meet my expectations.
4.0,I really like these... But I was hoping they were bigger.. But really are adorable.
4.0,More comfortable and fit better than expected. I wear socks with these and my jeans. Economical and great for everyday casual.
4.0,"The dress is great, fits perfectly for the size, the lace is soft, the material looks like a good quality, however I do have a couple advices. First if you get a dark color wash by hand at least the first time to get rid of some of that dye, in the picture that was the third time I had rinsed with clean water and still a lot of dye, I would also not wash this in the machine for another reason, the lace is very soft and delicate, the other material is pretty heavy when wet, I would ve scared of ruining the lace with all that extra weight. Second, check all the seams, mine had some pulled seams I wish I had seen sooner so I could've exchanged it, but I think it was just the &#34;lucky&#34; one when it comes to that.<br />Overall though I love it"
4.0,"I like these pants, but I'm 5'1 and have a sort of athletic build. Nothing extreme. I usually wear small pants, so that's what I ordered. They fit around the waist, jus a bit tight on the legs."
4.0,"This necklace is actually bigger then I expected. The charm part is bigger then you would think. So if you like big long necklaces, it perfect for you."
4.0,"I wear 9 or 39 usually. I read the reviews and ordered a 41. These fit fine. I do have a wider foot, but they are not too long."
4.0,Beautiful and I would say they are fairly true to size but you need a sturdy slim item like a pen to help get your foot in. These definitely do NOT slip on. But once the shoe is on they feel as though they fit and just need some breaking in. So I blame the design a bit more than the actual size.
4.0,Lovely looking beads. They seem to be making my stiff neck better.<br /><br />liok
4.0,"I like this product, but I found it to be a little too small around--otherwise, great."
4.0,"Okay so let's get the good stuff out of the way.<br /><br />The GOOD: basically everything. Material feels strong, and stitches are durable. The buckles are also really nice and I love the addition of the clip buckle for easy removal and decompression. I bought this to stuff my Adidas down winter jacket into so I can carry it in my bag when I arrive at work. It fits perfectly with room to spare. And that's how I'll lead into the bad<br /><br />The BAD: I would say that this isn't actually a ""bad"" quality but more like a ""meh"" quality. So where the straps are stitched on the side where you'd sinch the bag closed, I find that the straps are kinda long. This way when you compress the bag all the way, there's a huge length still left that could be compressed but the design won't allow it. I'll show pictures to show what I mean. In one of them I show my knee pressing on the bag to show how much ""slack"" the straps have and how much further I can compress it if those parts were a bit shorter. Basically, I could compress this bag way further but the design won't allow it and that kind of sucks because it's still bigger than what I'd like.<br /><br />Conclusion: all around great bag (especially for $10) but unfortunately it can't be compressed any further due to the limitations set by the straps."
4.0,Very comfortable dance shoe. Especially like the net between the straps so my toes don’t poke through.
4.0,Love the material. It's a lil big but ok.
4.0,So soft and beautiful color but fit too small.
4.0,I am 5'4 165lbs and usually a size 10. I ordered this suit in a LARGE and it is very good quality and adorable but i could have probably used an XL just for more coverage. Definitely a hot mom suit which i wanted and is cheeky so keep that in mind when ordering.
4.0,"I've searched high and low for a pair of sunglasses that can comfortably fit my small head and my low nose bridge (Asian). This pair actually wraps around my head and rests comfortably between the eyes. However, I knocked off a point for the item not looking like the product photo - the tortoiseshell is MUCH darker in person, and the lenses are not transparent, they're black and nearly opaque, which I don't mind, but it does tend to make the whole thing blend together. I look like I basically have a pair of black sunglasses, not tortoiseshell sunglasses."
4.0,Good quality material and fit is good
4.0,Got this to give as a gift and she really likes it!
4.0,It is a really cute shirt.  Fits great.
4.0,"This is a cute, good quality dress. However a bit wild for me."
4.0,Pretty Jacket
4.0,Love the shirt! More shear than expected but item was described very well & shipping was super fast!
4.0,"This is super comfy. I ordered my normal size (small-5'1&#34;, 120lbs). This is a bit long but most thing usually are. I like how it is uneven but if I wear with boots, the longest part reaches down to my boots! But I think that just is mostly because I'm so short. I ordered yellow. It is a bit see through if you don't wear nude-ish colored undergarments though."
4.0,Like the overall fit
4.0,"This ran a little big, but not noticeably to others.  I’m 5’3 and 125 and ordered a small.  I do have to wear heels or they’re too long and I needed shapewear to smooth things out under the thin fabric.  I got a lot of compliments on them."
4.0,"Maybe I have large hands, but the side zippers can be a little tight.  Aside from that, these are great lightweight shorts for the money."
4.0,"When I took it out of the package I was like... meh not what I expected.  However, it’s comfy and warm and it looks cute on.  I would purchase it again.  I’m between a 4-6 and bought a medium.  It fits baggy.  If that helps."
4.0,"This dress is so freaking cute!!!  Runs a little small but is fun, sweet, and wonderful- perfect for a sunny day or a summer's eve!"
4.0,"They do break under hard use, but lighter than steel, keep a screw remover handy"
4.0,I like the Colorada keychain.
4.0,"I ordered this in green in size XL, based on the size chart. I typically wear a 12, and the XL was fine. My only complaint is that the fabric is very thin. Because of that, I returned the dress. I did like it and wish it had worked for me."
4.0,"Bought this for my sister so I will update when she gets it to see what she thinks. Item does run small so I bought an extra large although my sister wears a medium. It looks like it will be a good fit for her. Very cute product, the material is a little stiff but I don't think she will mind."
4.0,Love it.  The only problem is the clasp.  Hard to open.  But other than that it is totally beautiful.
4.0,The arms were very long but overall is a nice fit.
4.0,"Have tried this on, but it's a little small on me so I need to adjust much of it to fit me.  Haven't worn this yet with a dress.  Maybe this Holiday :)"
4.0,"Smaller than I thought it would be, but other than that, I like it."
4.0,I ordered a 2t for my niece and it was a little big. She will haveto grow into it. It is super cute though and will look cute with a sweater or sandals very satisfied. Looks even nicer in person.
4.0,"The dress was well made, but definitely lighter than pictured in the product photo so it did not work for my costume needs."
4.0,"Holds the fitbit one very well, almost too tight that it makes it difficult to slip it in or pull it out. I use it only when sleeping. This stays on the wrist much better than the velcro band that it came with."
4.0,Great last minute costume. Only complaint I have is the placement of two dots on the front... Had several people questioning why my costume had nipples. Bit awkward.
4.0,"Fits the watch fine but installing the spring bars was a very long and hard process. The bracelet is fine but for the price quality is great. I ended up breaking a spring bar in half trying to install them into the watch. After bending the spring bars they stuck in the watch but one came back, however after putting it back in a second time it stayed in and hasn't come back out.<br /><br />A great deal for the price if you're willing to be patient with the installation process."
4.0,"Great hat, made well. Only irony is that it is made in Vietnam!"
4.0,"Good quality, color as it looks in the picture but definitely order one size up"
4.0,"I love the ankle bracelet it looks exactly how its perceived in the picture the only bad I have on my end is that my ankle too small so it's kind of big for me, but my mom took it, but I will most certainly recommend this product to anyone who want a nice comfy ankle bracelet"
4.0,This tote is exactly the size I was looking for.  So far it has lived up to my expectations.  Love the color!
4.0,"These boots fit very well but they do run a size small! I ordered the olive green color and they are the perfect shade of dark/hunter green! I normally a 6.5W so after reading the other reviews, I ordered half a size down. The 6 fit well with boot socks and if I want extra comfort and fluff, I can probably fit with another sock on for those really cold days. The inner sole has a soft layer for when you get your foot in. At a first glance paired with some boot socks, these can pastas Hunter boots! Definitely recommend and would buy again."
4.0,"Really nice Purse, a little bigger than I expected. Great quality, and love the way it looks"
4.0,Very nice for the cost! Wears comfortably on my wrist for a large case watch. Also  a big enough band to fit my large wrist.
4.0,The masks arrived they were beautiful but there are 3 masks not 4 as mentioned in the description. Not a big deal as in some places (title) it says 3 and there are only 3 masks pictured but let's try and keep in consistent.  Masks are BEAUTIFUL! Very comfortable as well!
4.0,Nice band for the price. It’s a little stiff but I’m sure will relax with wear.
4.0,"Pros:<br />Having mono vision, I wear one contact lens. Because it's a special scleral lens, the visual field is totally different than a standard RGP lens, and they can't add the same bifocal type correction. For this reason, I also need readers to see up close. I have a half dozen pair of reading glasses all over the house, and constantly put them on and off all day, just sticking them on my head.  When I use these, I don't have that line from the top of the frame or lenses to cut into my visual field when looking ahead. I can put these on when I'm home, and just leave them on all afternoon if I choose.<br />Cons:<br />If there was an option to choose a slighty different frame with a solid nose piece instead of the metal loops with hard plastic pads, I would have offered 5 stars.  I like to stick my glasses on the top of my head so I don't have to retrieve them all day, but this style nose piece tangles and pulls my hair. If you offer a pair with a solid nose piece, I'd love to try them.<br />All in all, they're quite handy, and I intend to keep them. Yet they're not a type frame that I would invest in multiple pairs."
4.0,Pretty.  Just like pic. I only wished it had a strap
4.0,I love this sweater love love but I need to return its to big and the buttoms open up.<br />So I would like to return and order a medium size. Please respond.<br />Thank you
4.0,Very soft. ..loved the fit and layered this with a tank underneath.  Perfect for casual wear as well as the gym.
4.0,"I wear a straight size 9 in shoe, boot or sandal, so I was surprised to find the fit on the tight side.<br />Couldn't be worn with heavy winter sock if you wanted to.<br />But a fun bootie for a trip to the grocery store."
4.0,The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is purely based on sizing. I am a standard US 38 C with wide shoulders and wear a dress size 12. In no known world am I considered a XXL. That size with this company fits great. Nice colors and comfortable fabric.
4.0,"Very cute, helps keep me organized without taking up much room at all!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress! I love the color and the fit, but for the original price I think it is too much. Thank goodness I bought this on sale since it is for me to wear as a bridesmaid, but I would have been disappointed with the quality had I paid more. The fabric is thin and a more see-through than appreciated."
4.0,Smaller than I thought it would be. But great service
4.0,Cute. But I cannot leave it in because it pokes me in the ear because of its sharp corners if I try to leave it in to sleep.
4.0,Returning as too oversized.
4.0,"This is a nice bag. I am having second thoughts. I returned it, but should kept it. I probably will buy it again."
4.0,"I love wearing slip-on shoes that come up pretty low on my ankle, such as boat shoes, but one thing I hate about wearing said shoes is that I’m usually left with two options. One, I can wear the shoes without socks, which leads to my wife constantly complaining about my feet stinking. Two, I can wear low-rise socks, which leaves me with a look that I’m not terribly fond of with most slip-on shoes. This led me to search out some solution to this conundrum, which lead me to the MABUA Cotton No Show Socks.<br /><br />First Impression<br />After finding the socks and purchasing seven pairs for right around $15, I was eager to try them out. I purchased the socks in “One Size Fits Most” which is supposed to fit men’s shoes sizes 8.5 thru 10.5. This size ended up fitting me really well, I wear a 9.5 usually but if my foot was any bigger I would be worried if the socks would fit.<br /><br />The socks I ordered were the “7 striped pairs” (as shown in link at bottom) and I was really happy with the colors that came with it. They are packaged as Men’s or Women’s socks and I can confirm that the colors that come in the seven pair pack is definitely wearable by either sex without having to worry about them being “too manly” or “too feminine.”  With that said, I like bright colors and patterns whenever it comes to socks, so that is completely personal preference. If you were someone who likes to stick to plain white, gray, or black socks, then I’d order a different set than the ones I picked up.<br /><br />In Use<br />I had tried no-show socks that were made by a different company a few years back and there was one problem that made the socks completely unusable. After walking for any short distance the back of the sock would slip off your heel and then ball up inside of your shoe. This made it impossible for me to ever wear those socks, so I ended up just throwing them away. This was something I was worried about whenever I ordered the MABUA socks, but there is one key design feature that helps guard against this. On the inside back of the sock there is a gel-like line that is supposed to help keep the back of the sock from sliding off the back of your heel. Thankfully, that’s exactly what it does and I haven’t had a problem with the socks sliding off my heel once.<br /><br />The next big thing I noticed while wearing the socks was how light-weight and breathable they are. I haven’t had any problem at all with my feet getting too hot while wearing them. This light-weight build though is something that also worries me though. While I’ve worn the socks 3-4 times for each pair at this point, I am still afraid that at some point soon there will be holes worn into the socks because of how thin and light-weight they are. I have no evidence that this will happen, thankfully it hasn’t yet, but I can’t help but worry that it will. Another point worth mentioning about the thin/light-weight build of the socks, if you’re used to wearing thicker socks then you might feel like you’re shoes are fitting a bit looser while wearing these socks. This wasn’t a problem for me, but I could easily see it being something a person could encounter, so I wanted to bring it up.<br /><br />Recap<br />As I mentioned, I was initially worried about these socks because of my past experience with no-show socks, but I’ve been extremely happy with this purchase and I will probably end up getting more pairs of them at some point. The thin and breathable material makes them incredibly comfortable to wear during those hot summer days, and that gel strip on the back heel of the sock effectively keeps the sock from sliding off my foot throughout the day. I do still worry about the longevity of these socks, and I won’t be surprised if I have to replace them sooner than later. While the “one-size fits most” fits my feet perfectly, if I wore a size 10 I’d be pretty worried about whether or not these would fit. In the end though, I’m pleased with this purchase and have no problem recommending it to anyone else out there."
4.0,"I purchased the large gloves and found them to be way too tight. Although I am 6'1, I don't have huge hands and I thought they would fit. I gave them to a friend, and she loved them. I went back and purchased a pair of XLs and they fit fine."
4.0,"It is nice quality. I got the size 12-14 for my 10-year-old, and she thinks it is too small."
4.0,I love this dress however its fits a bit too small by d butt i had some adjustments to do to fit into the dress... So i recommend if ur buyin go up by 2sizes....overall beautiful dress....How can i add pics
4.0,"I really liked this wallet when I received it. It fit my phone and passport and is a nice material. The only issue is that after using it for about a month, the wristlet part fell off. I am trying to sew it back on but because of where it is located, it is very difficult to try to fix. Thisis the only issue I've had with it."
4.0,"This really is a quality top! Beautiful colors, very well made, nice fabric! I just wish that it fit me right! I'm 5'6"" 145lbs 36D. I usually buy large tops because I like a slightly looser fit to hide anything unflattering. However, this top was huge! It swallowed me with absolutely no shape whatsoever. I felt like I was wearing a sack. I will be returning. I loved the length! It would be a perfect shirt to wear with leggings."
4.0,"So it's pretty cute, and exactly as pictured, however it is packaged in a small box that made the taller feathers fold in; I was going to remove them anyways but I figured I should mention it here."
4.0,Not as warm as what I'd like...but can use phone easily
4.0,King size is a great product for people that are big like myself obesity just a little expensive could get better deals especially for repeated customers other than that no complaints on their product
4.0,This dress was cute and fit well. Perfect to run around and run errands in. I'm 5'1 and a 36DD and the dress hit right above my knee. I ordered a medium.
4.0,nice material and all but the are like a size bigger so if your are medium like me get a small.
4.0,"Just a little long/little wide for my foot. Because the cut of the shoe, you can't slip in an insole for support.  But, they are perfectly comfortable without.  Seem to be made well."
4.0,Feels great on and very flattering.
4.0,Good fit and the material is really comfortable.  Shirts gets lots of laughs when I am out running.
4.0,"Normally I am a Large but decided to go Medium on this one. The bust looks a little snug but it wasn’t. I think one may want to size down. I believe since it’s pretty long, it’s meant to be tucked in front, but I don’t like doing that.<br /><br />It was a thick blouse. It says it’s rayon and another fabric but it honestly feels like cotton. I didn’t mind but just noticed that. I have plenty rayon tops so I could feel the difference."
4.0,"Just like all the Orchid Row products, this is a nice-quality scarf, just as cute as you would hope. The fake fur feels a lot like rabbit... if rabbits came covered in flowers.<br /><br />I haven't seen the tab design before, but it's handy. Otherwise something this silky would slide right off."
4.0,"This watch was gorgeous it's just my style it has little crystal like blings at each hour, around the dial, and a few in between each the big wrist link.. It rose gold in color and comes in an appealing box...<br /><br />What you get:<br />1. Gift box with watch around pillow<br />2. Link removing tool<br />3. Instructional link removal pamphlet with photos<br />4. Cleaning cloth<br />5. Warranty card<br /><br />I personally have a tiny wrist (5&#34;), and this watch was huge. When I saw the tools I thought how lovely I don't have to go to the jewelers to get links taken out. I hate to be the barrier of bad news but the tool is absolutely worthless. The problem is while it fits in the pin hole it's much to thick, not pointed enough, nor sturdy to get the job done. I bent it twice trying to push out the pins which wouldn't budge so I guess that's a good thing in a way (no worries of pins coming undone). Finally after a hour of fooling with it my husband tell tells me how he just bought a jewelers kit not that long ago....gee thanks! Anyways his kit worked perfect and was able to readjust the watch. Other than that the watch is perfect in every way. I have gotten a few compliments on it so far. I highly recommend this watch just forget about the the tool though ;)"
4.0,Looks durable and is very comfortable. Size a little too big but will work
4.0,"Super cute, great quality, fit a tiny bit too big."
4.0,"so cute but runs small, I ended up giving to a friend for her b-day ands she loves it, says comfortable."
4.0,Great material. Stitching is slightly blurred.
4.0,Perfect size labret for my lip pericing. The jewel fell out after 3 weeks on one of them though... that was disappointing.
4.0,It was a hit at my Job's Christmas Party!!
4.0,Shirt is soft and great fit.  I was disappointed that the red was so dark- almost a burgundy.
4.0,"Very low cut, but otherwise great!"
4.0,Nice backpack. Can fit a lot. The only downfall is that it doesn’t have a bottle holder on the side as shown on the picture.
4.0,For the price the OMG LOL sweat hoodie set IS well made  so I’m glad I bought it after all. $30+with tax for a kid  I hate to spend that on a budget but It’s very soft on the inside n out. She loves it to go with her LOL OMGdolls n backpack! She turned 6 and she’s tall n the size was exact lik they said it would be.and no ShrinkageFantastic!!! 🤗 that sure helped  all three were great gifts. I’m a new Amazon customer who got off to a bad start w trying to return a new gift that the bday girl already received from Amazon 1day b4 MY exact Amazon gift was delivered to her!!  Then Those return boxes were a mess so I called the # on the lock boxes for help. The poor man knew nothing he was foreign n I could hear all the other men loud in the background  It felt strange that Amazon would use a customer service in another country  w bad language gap  he couldn’t understand a word I was sayin n said he had no answer how they work (all while sounding lik catfishing loud in background) so finally I begged for a supervisor who in 2 sentences solved the problem after all that back n forth w him for more than10min in the middle of a store full of people 🤦🏻‍♀️Poor guy he needed more training n quiet.  anyway then”u”AMAZON  said a week later U never received the brand new gift I sent back ( while on the phone w a supervisor at that!!) So then I had to solve that credit problem too b4 I could order her a replace gift which I ended up buying her a gift worth 4x’s more $$than the first gift (for being so late after her bday) with a life like newborn which she adores n won’t let it out her sight  (She has already picked out 2 more reborn girls for sisters for the newborn.  So it all ended out fine but I hate the thought of ever returning anything that says “free” return n i hav to go find a drop box n I hav to lyft there n back $15-$18 n then u make us pay $5.99 for a box when it said clearly free returns no hassle after no one would pick back up at my house for free fast return only $12.99pickup  ( n then say u didn’t receive it after the expensive lyft n had to fight to get my 5.99back from lock box n hav it credited back to me  with the credit for the lol cheer doll u said u never received)  hassle big hassle to clear up n get straight  But I will order again  but wisely n hope never hav to return anything again  If u can pick up at my house where u dropped off for free not $12.99 for u to pick up  that was crazi when the gift cost $21  if we clear this pick up this up  I will be a great customer  this is so great for me a disabled person who is room/ bed bound most days  now that iv finally caved n downloaded ur App to get the best presents for my granddaughter  I will just chalk it off as 1st timers bad luck n pray it was a one time mistake n I’ll hav no more problems  I’m on SSI Disability so tight on funds for gifts for my lil sweetie  hope to find sales after Xmas to buy her a sister doll for her newborn she adores lik a real baby she’s a only child n this is the best gift she’s ever received
4.0,I got this for my boyfriend and it looks great but the sizing is a little off compared to other rings...maybe because it's so thick. So I went a half size up and it fits great. The seller shipped fast too!!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:2bf7d935e05752c56a2f722078877a8d]] Fit great comfortable, I wear them while mowing or yard work on hot days"
4.0,Nice quite a lot more sheer than expected. The white one fit nicely though a bit snug. The black was too much smaller and unfortunately unwearable. Lucky for my granddaughter. I suggest buying the next size if you don’t want them quite tight
4.0,Made of a thinner material. I'm 5'2&#34; and got the small and have to roll up the with waistband twice for it to fit. Other than that it's really comfy.
4.0,The charm is larger than I thought.
4.0,"Since I can't enter a fitting room to try on a swimsuit at a brick and mortar store because of Cvid protocol, I took a chance and purchased online. I could narrow my search down to the price point, star rating and swimsuit style.  What a pleasant surprise! The swimsuit fits perfectly."
4.0,Good looking bag with many compartments. Roomy yet jazzy camera bag design. Great for everyday or travel bag.
4.0,This is super adorable and my daughter absolutely loves this. She is a 2T in most other sizes and although it fits her it's a little snug and we will only get a few wears out of it. The quality is fine and we didn't dry ours otherwise I think she would've only worn it once.
4.0,"A bit shorter than perfect length, and the fact that they attach on the handles themselves rather than the tips of the handles, may be detractors for some.  Other than these, they work fine."
4.0,Fit and finish are nice.  I wish the color was slightly closer to the original watch.  This bands light grey color doesn't quite match.  I still wear it without issue though.  I do recommend if you need a lower cost option than the original metal bracelet.
4.0,"I like them, I didn't check the material online, they are a slight shiny slippery material."
4.0,The skirt looks shinier and more pink in person rather than in the pic as if it's better for a party or disco rather than for everyday wear unless you like wearing shiny light pink in daylight.  The material is light.  Make sure you have a small skirt or slip for underneath since there's no lining and of course the color is light.  It's a good deal though for a low cost stylish skirt.
4.0,Only thing I didn’t like is the pink one was a little bigger than the black one
4.0,Somewhat small in the fit but they have two buttons on the waist so you can make it work and be comfortable
4.0,Cute. Gave it as a gift from my son to his gram. Perfect sentiment.
4.0,"Bought this to work as a costume for my 8-year old child, but the helmet is waaaay too small.  This needs to be properly labeled as a &#34;Toddler&#34; helmet.<br /><br />Very snug fit on a 3-year old (with normal sized head).  Watching my poor 8-year old try to put it on was hilarious."
4.0,The fabric is nice and breathable. I only couldn’t wear it long enough to see if it got hot around the neck or not because it was too lose and wouldn’t stay on my face. The fabric is stretchy enough that it could be a few inches smaller in diameter in order to stay on the face well enough while still fitting different sizes.
4.0,"Fanrastic sunglasses for the price, nice case for Them too."
4.0,Kinda flimsy but great for value for money. Very thin as well.
4.0,Good quality for the price! Very pretty and the perfect size!
4.0,This was for my mother and she really likes it.
4.0,"Nice dress & comfy too.  Would have given it 5 stars, except the material across the top area looses the pattern a bit as it stretches across the bust area.  Super long, which is great when your 5'9&#34;!"
4.0,"Ridiculously adorable one piece!! So cute! I ordered a size up (normally a small, but ordered a medium). Makes your booty look great! However, the top part is a bit large on me. It's meant to have some side-boob view but I'm not large enough on top to fill that out (32B). Hopefully I can get it altered in time for my vacation! Highly recommend this suit but beware if you're smaller on top you might not be able to fill out the cups."
4.0,"This is a really cool wallet. The fact that it has an apple air tag holder means that I won't lose my wallet again. It also has spots for my credit cards and other important cards that i need to have with me. When closed, it is slim, so it fits easy into my pocket."
4.0,Nice shirt fits well. I bought a large and I usually wear medium. The shirt is very comfortable.
4.0,"They are very cute, however more of a gift for a child. I ordered them for my best friend and made them longer. I took the hearts off the hook and added sterling silver round rings which them 2"" longer. Now they look great. Wanted to share that idea! I would add a picture but they are already mailed."
4.0,"I like it. It fits well, a very nice top."
4.0,"What love to have given the adorable St. Paddy's Day glasses 5 stars, but the lenses were quite scratched. I only used them for a couple days & will be put away for next year. But will keep them and use them for years to come, I'm sure. Pretty well made for the price and loads of fun in a crowd."
4.0,"I love these shorts, they’re so cute. The fabric isn’t very soft but still comfy. I went up a size and they fit very well. I like them a little loose so it’s more appropriate for work."
4.0,"When you have it open it’s a little wobbly,I think it should be a little tighter."
4.0,"Product is as advertised. Yet my mistake 4mm is too big for me, wish it came in 3mm."
4.0,"these are the double flapper model, padded OK, good for light contact, plus you get a satisfying noise when hit correctly, and a not-so-good flat rise if hit at an angle, so very good for inexperienced students learning correct contact. Not the greatest quality, a little flimsy, but for the money, just fine. They will wear out, split and fray with heavy use, so plan on replacing every year or two if you use them a lot."
4.0,Beautiful earrings. I ended up returning them bc they were too big for my 6 almost 7 year old. I have them 4 stars bc they are very beautiful and fancy. It’s unfortunate they were too big in size for my daughters ears.
4.0,Loved the style however the top and bottom were both too small. I am a 36DD and a size 12/14. I reordered another one in a different style but same brand in a size 3xl which was a size 12/14 since these suits run a size SMALLER! That fit great!
4.0,Cozy and warm. Great choice for the price
4.0,"I purchased two bands from this company. Both bands are of good quality for the price paid. However, this band did not fit my 49 millimeter Asus zenwatch 2. The other one did. My watch uses a 22 millimeter band. I will not fault the band because I had ordered a third band from another company that also did not fit my watch despite being 22 millimeters too. This leads me to believe that there is nothing wrong with the size of the watch band, but actually a discrepancy in the size of the connectors on the watch end."
4.0,"The shirt was beautiful, but I had to send it back because I read the shirt description wrong before I ordered. I thought the sequins were all silver, but they're not, they're different colors."
4.0,"The material is very light and dries very quickly, It is very nice. The sown in lining is a little uncomfortable for me, I would rather use my own underwear... but that is a personal opinion. The other thing that would be nice is a longer pull string. If the waist is fully stretched, the pull string tends to disappear inside the waist. In my opinion, the pull string should be 12"" longer, which would allow 6"" of ""tail"" when the waist is fully expanded. If this last point were addressed my result would be in 5-start rating."
4.0,"This was a gift for a friend who just had surgery, she loved it."
4.0,Never need ironing
4.0,"I have short blocky fat feet and these actually fit. The strap barely closes but the velcro is sturdy and stays clasped. They smelled horrible. I tried to put them on out of the box when I got them but I the smell made me sick. I had to leave them outside over night. But hey, for $18, I'd buy another pair."
4.0,Well made!  Using it for the summer travel ahead.<br />Love the RFID & security features. So many colors<br />to choose from. Stuck with black.
4.0,"It is very cute and a medium size. It does look as pictured however I don’t know about it’s lasting power considering I gave it as a gift. I don’t think it’s silver plated or sterling silver which implies it will turn your skin green/black if you sweat or swim with it. But if you plan to wear it for an event and remove it after it seems good enough for the job.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I will say that abalones are endangered so I would not repurchase from anyone that does not ethically source their abalone."
4.0,"I like them, but I bought them thinking that they would be a shorter version of the full length pair that I love...they aren't."
4.0,Very cute.  Well made for the price.
4.0,"I love it but it runs small, cant wear it. However still in love with the material and quality."
4.0,"I bought this very pretty top as a Christmas gift for my wife. She says it's a little big, but likes it none the less. You may want to invest in a size just a bit smaller than you would usually wear. All in all, I still think it's a nice blouse and would buy it again--just smaller."
4.0,Little hard to wear on shorter toe but still cute and fun
4.0,I purchased this bag for my 9 year old niece.  The purse has zipper compartments for her to carry her &#34;treasures&#34;.  She loves her new purse.
4.0,Really nice an my daughter loves it.
4.0,Love this item only issue was arms were a little snug even though I went up a couple of sizes
4.0,"Although this is not terry cloth, and it is very short, I still really like it.  It's a good weight for a bathrobe."
4.0,Just amazing quality and craftsman
4.0,I loved the style of this hat but I was expecting something a bit more heavier duty. It's a great hat for fashion purposes but I'm not sure how long it would last for real use.
4.0,"Its thick material. The goggles are lined up with my eyes . Nice lining , I look forward to using it . Thanks"
4.0,Looks great! Love the navy color.
4.0,"Almost a direct replacement. Work very well. However, the strap comes loose from the frames very easily."
4.0,"I like this dress. I ordered the plaid and the print is nice. I'm 5'5&#34; and it hit me just at the knees. The material stretches enough to be forgiving but not enough to lose shape. It is a bit smaller than expected in the chest, but otherwise it's a lovely casual work dress."
4.0,For the price it's impossible to complain.  Shipping took almost 1 month but it is the right color and it functions well....
4.0,It fits pretty much perfect.  Shows off the package pretty damn well- just a little pointy in the front but overall hot
4.0,"Exactly as pictured (including the color). It's a nicely hemmed nylon. So many scarves terrible hems that are unraveled when you get them, but not this one! It's very color and soft. The only reason I didn't give it a five star, is because it's not a very large scarf and it ships from China, so it took about 5 weeks to get it. Other than that, you're love it and it's worth the price."
4.0,I love them. They can a couple days early and look a lot better in person. The also look almost red when i put them in my ear.
4.0,I love these earrings.  Not too big. Just enough subtle bling.
4.0,"Luscious feeling.  I could live in this romper.<br />It can be dressy, casual or sleepwear.  I plan to keep this item and possibly order another in a smaller size.  I’ll decide once I’ve laundered the piece."
4.0,Beautiful! A little smaller then I anticipated but love it. Quick delivery too.
4.0,"This is a very simple and small purse. It's made of leather that seems of good quality and likely will last a long time. The flap is secured by two snaps.  It has little room in it, but could be used for coins, or business cards, or credit cards, or folded bills, perhaps if you're dressing up and don't want to carry a bulging wallet."
4.0,"I love this sports bra even though it looks pretty weird on me.  Luckily, I'm more about practicality than appearance.  I love the pocket for my phone, the mesh in front and the openings in back allow for good airflow, the band at the bottom doesn't bite into me, and the fabric is soft and strong.  I suspect the reason it looks odd on me that I am rather flat chested?  Doesn't matter, I can just put a shirt on over it and croon over how comfortable it is."
4.0,The hood is a maroon purple. Would have been prettier if they used one of the brighter colors from the shirt.
4.0,This is actually washable and durable. I have been using this constantly since I bought them.
4.0,"Great fit, but fabric and colors fade after a few washings"
4.0,This is a really nice bracelet. I really love all cat jewelry. This bracelet would have gotten 5 stars but it did not come with a lobster clasp like in the pics and descriptions. It came with the clasp in my photo.
4.0,Sorry...Holes  already in belt
4.0,Lululemon dupe with good material.
4.0,"The bag is well made, looks nice, has lots of pockets and is well padded around the tablet, but it's hard to fit much more than a Surface, a power adapter, a small notepad and some pens."
4.0,"I honestly thought this was perfect for cosplaying and Halloween that's coming up. My research found that cosplays can be pricey, but it's worth the price. I looked at the comments, and it stated that the bottom leg thingy is tight. Honestly, to avoid that, buy a size or two above your normal size. The demon slayer uniform is baggy anyway. Although one of the buttons did come broken and wasn't in the package, I simply fixed that by sticking the upper cloth, to the downer cloth using tape. The belt is fine too! I just stuck the hanging piece to the belt for it to look better. It was worth the price, and I can't wait for the sword to come! Once that comes, I'll be fully ready for a fun Halloween!"
4.0,There is no grip so it doesn't always stay up but its adorable!
4.0,These are all cute EXCEPT the honey.  Horrible smell!
4.0,Really nicer that I thought it would be. I wear a 10-12 and went ahead and ordered the XL cause I wanted it loose. It is quite loose but I like it. The shape of the hem is fine. Cute with my wool scarf leggings and boots. Don't know how it will hold up in the wash hence four stars. Quick shipping! If washes well I will get more colors!
4.0,Wore off on one pair of shoes in one day.  Difficult to place on shoes with deep treads.
4.0,"I expected the ankles to be tighter, like cinched with elastic or something, but they were open and flowy. I kinda like it anyway. Also this is a super stylish and low effort outfit."
4.0,It's kind of awkward at first cuz the straps aren't tied together but once I went back and looked at the picture I figured it out and I like it
4.0,Not exactly as picture but good for the price. The once pictured looked like a slightly better quality than the one I received.
4.0,"I have had designer polarized sunglasses previously, this were not as high quality. I will be honest though they are really great for the prize. I would definitely buy them again- I tend to loose sunglasses easily.  they sit on the nose and behind the ears nicely, no adjusting needed. they also don't slid of my nose.<br /><br />Great Buy!!!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a6ee55333f8ed0ebd8b98750a14d2017]] This is just what I need for the few occasions when I dress up. It is a simple sheer black shawl that can be worn over the shoulders either loose or tied. It's perfect for chilly evenings and will not take away from whatever is worn underneath. It will go with just about any outfit. It could also be worn as a scarf in a myriad of manners.<br /><br />The shawl is appropriate for any age, and adds a touch of modesty to a strapless outfit. It is nicely hemmed all the way around, with no unsightly tag to remove. There were no washing instructions, but the listing says to hand wash and dry flat. To me it seems like I could put it in a lingerie bag and use my machine on the hand wash cycle, and it would be just fine, but I like to live on the edge when it comes to laundry.<br /><br />The fabric is soft and wrinkle resistant. It came out of the bag having been folded for who knows how long, and the folds were barely noticeable. This is a nice basic wrap that is available in a wide array of colors. I chose black because most of my formal stuff is either black or would work with a black wrap. I feel that the price at the time of this review is also fair, and I would recommend it.<br /><br />Free sample provided for review in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations."
4.0,"This dainty little thing comes full of an off white grainy substance.  If you put it in the sun or in front of a light bulb, that side will glow blue in the dark.  It is difficult to get all of the contents evenly light charged."
4.0,Very small but pretty
4.0,Got it to cove my tummy and it did okay..not full tummy support but it worked for what I needed it for.<br />Looks very cute on.
4.0,Looks nice. A little heavy but not too bad to wear.
4.0,"The pendant is smaller than I hoped for but overall, it's a nice necklace."
4.0,"I purposely bought my coat two sizes up because I wanted space for sweaters and also I wanted the length, so I can’t speak on how true to size it is, but it keeps me warm. My only complaints are the zipper is sometimes hard to “take” at the bottom? Don’t know how to describe it, but it might just be a slight error on my coat. Also, they used a very cheap quality fabric in the pockets. Otherwise, I am very happy with my coat."
4.0,"Nice cap but since it arrived after New Year, I guess it will be this years Christmas."
4.0,Love the color is very vibrant fit perfect just a little bit too long have to  Hammett up just a little bit very good product
4.0,Loved these but they got black and patchy after only a little while... like they started to chip. I wish they were a bit cheaper cause then it wouldn’t matter as much.
4.0,"I think this little outfit is cute, should have ordered it a size bigger though, I cannot wear it, but I do like it!"
4.0,The color is not the same as the picture though. It is not that dark and is unfortunately now not in the palette of color I wear.
4.0,"Okay so just for everyone who doesn't know much about bowling, this is NOT  flesh light.<br />I repeat, NOT A FLESH LIGHT.<br />Its meant for your other extremities; to be more clear you freaking fingers. I can't begin to imagine someone who bought this not knowing what it was 🤣🤣🤣 yall need Jesus."
4.0,Very nice skirt. A bit thinner than I had hoped. Will definitely need to wear a slip underneath but the style is pretty and it fits very well.
4.0,"I love this dress! It's a little tight when it's new, but it loosens and relaxes a bit with wear. The sizing will probably run small."
4.0,Fit just fine did the job on my wife's fancy sandals that my bunny chewed the laces. Lol..
4.0,love them  were exactly as described...coming from china took a while to get here
4.0,"Nice quality and style, but too fits too small."
4.0,Chic. works well with other pieces.
4.0,Cute suit for the price. It does run large and is very stretchy.
4.0,"These are really nicely made.  Just beautiful!  I ordered and received the size 8.5 which is what I normally wear and I could hardly get my hands in them.  The were pretty tight.  I measured my hands again and the 8.5 is the size I need.  These must be labeled incorrectly.  No worries though, they made a wonderful gift for my friend, she wears a size 8 and they fit her perfectly."
4.0,"These classic neckties by Awesome 360 are great gift set for the men in your life. The set I got comes with two in the shades of purple (checkered) and pink (flower). The material is great and fabric is made out of polyester. It's not silk, however, pollsters are sturdy, last long and come through the wash alright. The colors would go nicely with any shirt/suit combination specially white shirt and a nice fitted black suit. The cut of the ties is classic, meaning not too wide or too narrow."
4.0,"Great hat, but it comes without the box, and because of the shipping, it was pretty flat... it lost its shape.<br />It didn't say anything about this, but it works just well after a bit of disappointment."
4.0,Great bargain but a piece fell off as soon as I got it. Easy repair though as far as the price goes real bargain.
4.0,"Good quality and pretty, but suitable for someone with large wrists. The gems themselves are large as well. Gem Stone King is an awesome company -- have a favorite morganite ring from them I wear everyday, but this bracelet overwhelmed my wrists and hands. Too large, not delicate."
4.0,"It is cute, comfortable just a bit see through. All black under garments necessary!"
4.0,"The comfort of the jacket was amazing! It's perfect for a cold day, and you don't want to look like an Eskimo. A comfortable jacket that has the kangaroo pocket and the thumb design is what I was going for! The jacket that I can wear at home or to work! Superb!"
4.0,the kid likes it.
4.0,"I used this dress for a fancy dinner date, I didn’t feel under dressed at all. The thigh slit is so sexy I love it! I couldn’t wear the shoulders down around my upper arm/shoulder because the elastic was too tight and uncomfortable but it looked cute as it was without pulling the collar down. Very comfortable and breathable, the materal is thin and stretchy but not see through."
4.0,"I’m giving it 4 stars, instead of 5 because I cannot wear the jacket.  The color is vibrant, the material is thick and good quality, however even a XXX Large will not fit.  I am a U.S. large and I can’t get this jacket on because it’s so small...I ordered the XXXL.  If you are a U.S. XS, S or medium you might fit this jacket in its largest sizes.  It’s a beautiful jacket, wish I could wear it."
4.0,"Sharkborough’s athletic tee is soft, comfortable and made from a moisture wicking material that will keep sweat and wetness away from you whatever your physical activity is going to be. Warning: these run much larger than size to be sure to order down a size. Besides that, the shirt looks nice and seems sturdy enough.<br />I always line dry these sorts of gear, just to be safe. I’ll add wear evaluation later."
4.0,"Came quickly! We ordered last minute as we planning on heading out of town for the holiday and got it just before we left. I ordered size 12 months which is what my daughter normally wears (sometimes she even wears 18 months) and this was actually a bit big on her. Not too big that she couldn't wear it but I just had to roll up her sleeves a little. Overall, super cute though."
4.0,"Love this dress. Only lost one star because I have to pull at the sides at the top to keep my bra from showing. Otherwise, compliments all the time from people."
4.0,"I do like this dress, but it's way too long for me. I kept it with plans to hem, but have not done it yet, so I can't say how well this will hold up. I'm 5'7&#34; and would like to wear this with flat shoes....it's possible that with heels it would be ok."
4.0,This is a beautiful pendant.  It was a little bigger than I thought it would be but other than that it was great.
4.0,It is Exactly what my son wanted. The fit is true to size. He says they are the most comfortable shoe but still works.
4.0,"It's quite a bit bigger than I thought it would be, which isnt a bad thing.... the chain it came with was too tangled to use so o had to use one that i already had on hand(it comes with a black rope too but i dont like to use those because they look cheaper)... the crystals inside slide around which is what i was hoping for and the pendant is exactly as pictured. I had to take a star off because of the chain being tangled and (in my opinion) too short for the weight of the pendant. Mine did come with a a pair of small stud earrings in a small pouch that daid ""mystery gifts given to the lucky 10%"" so that eas nice other than the fact that my ears arent pierced so ill have to give them away."
4.0,More for a lady.. Although it was displayed as if for a man
4.0,My son loves crocs. These are great for cooler weather since that have the fleece inside.
4.0,"I  really liked the dress, and of good quality. I  will use it for the office"
4.0,"The only reason I gave this dress 4 stars is because I didn't like how it sat on my shoulders. When I moved the fabric kind of creased on my chest.<br />I also didn't keep the dress, because the pattern just didn't look good on me.The fabric is stretchy and thick enough that it wasn't see through."
4.0,I got an XL but there’s absolutely no stretch in this material. I gave it to my son that usually wears a medium or large. There was also a strong chemical odor when taking it out of the package
4.0,I love how flowy it is because i am self concious about my stomach region but it is a little shorter than I expected. Still a great product.
4.0,"This shirt isn't as soft as I had hoped. Also, I followed the size guide and it's more snug than I would have liked. I was hoping it would have fit more like in the picture."
4.0,The glasses are a little big but they fit very well over my glasses. I would recommend.
4.0,"beautiful, nice"
4.0,I love the lenses.  They are an amber tone.  I miss judged the size. Wish the were a tiny bit bigger.
4.0,"(4 stars only because there are no instructions) My nose pads turned to sticky mush, and I saw these while looking for new glasses. I ended up using a drop of superglue in each little hole, and held them in place for a minute, and the glasses are good as new! However, do NOT do what I did with the first one, and glue your thumb and finger together. Just a tiny bit in each hole!"
4.0,Super cute! But sides kept collapsing in. Had to stuff them with wadded up paper towels to keep it looking good! May glue foam in there for next time  Can only keep on for so long without it being so hot and suffocating but I used it a lot! Got lots of compliments on it!
4.0,I love the shirt!  I bought a large and it the size of a small!  This is the first thing I’ve gotten that we were not really happy with.
4.0,"Very cute cuff!  I like that it is small and easily adjustable as most cuffs are too big for me to wear.  I've worn it a few times and the small green chain on the outside is coming loose at one end.  I think I can easily fix it with a dab of super glue, but that is why I took of one star.  I am hoping that it holds up, because it really is adorable!"
4.0,Great thick material. They do look smaller than expected but once you put them on they fit fine. Great quality for the price.
4.0,"It’s a greasy piece for everyday wear,"
4.0,I bought this for my 15 year old for his birthday.  (for size reference he is 6 ft. tall) and this hat fits him well.  It could probably fit a little better but it's not so big that he can't or won't wear it.  For the price this is a great hat.
4.0,These were a gift for my daughter. Just glad to find them as they had nothing available HP wise in the proper size.
4.0,I love the leo design but it was a little smaller than we expected so we didn't get as many practices as we thought we would out of it.
4.0,"The patterns are awesome, if they were slightly longer they'd be perfect. One exception though, I recieved one pair which has something off with the stitching because it's like floss around my ankles. Broke that pair in by flexing my able through the range of motion to break some of that 'floss', worked until the wear started wearing holes in the able area. 11 out of 12 is still a win though"
4.0,Nice shirt & tie!
4.0,"Had them make me a custom size for a bridal party I was in. The cups seems small and high, and arm holes slightly close, but otherwise well made!"
4.0,"Just what I needed for my cosplay, my only issues is that the glasses were shipped in a bubble wrap lined envelope, which caused the glasses to be significantly twisted and unbalanced when I got them and felt really wonky on my head. Nothing a little pressure at the right points can fix though."
4.0,"This cardigan is somewhat small, but definitely wearable!<br />I really do like it."
4.0,Wear them daily. Pretty. Simple. I have sensitive ears nd no irrigation.
4.0,I’m a UGA Bulldogs fan for the fla vs ga game weekend
4.0,Appear to be a quality leather glove.  Soft and supple.  Zipper works well and the fit is good.
4.0,Cheap watch...I ruin watches in my hobbies. I get through four or five a year.  I also use for navigation; keep perfect time.
4.0,The color wasn't as deep as I was expecting and the fabric is a bit rougher than I thought it would be. For the price it's a comfortable and easy to wear shirt.
4.0,Very cute dress for a low price. Like that it has pockets!
4.0,"Beautiful, just fots a little large"
4.0,Very functional piece my only complaint is it’s very linty and it got all over my clothes.
4.0,"I'm 5'3 125lbs I got a medium and it fit me perfect. Nice and soft, comfy and cute"
4.0,it is very soft and warm.  just love this hat
4.0,Cute little bag!
4.0,"I love this purse! I've had this style for a few years. I like the multiple pockets and the conceal carry on the back. This purse doesn't have the big bulky flap that goes over the top that a lot of the others have. It's the perfect size... not too big, not too small.<br />The only thing that I wish this purse had is the 3 small pockets on the inside. I use those to put small things in like gum, chapstick, etc.<br />I wish there was an option to purchase the wallet that matches with the red, white and blue skull on it."
4.0,Sexy sheer front
4.0,Very nice quality.  I thought it would be a brighter red it's a little more burgundy but still very nice.  Will probably order the black and white also.
4.0,Really cute and exactly what I was looking for. The clasp is a bit flimsy but I didn’t expect much for the price. They were als a lot heavier than I would think for costume jewelry.
4.0,love the color and texture - a lot of pockets - I didn't receive the key holder some have mentioned...my only complaint is no zippered coin storage...I am hoping this helps me with my Dave Ramsey Journey
4.0,Every item that ordered came as pictured
4.0,"These are light weight and dry fast. That makes it great to go to the gym, rinse off, and not worry about getting the bag wet. The only issue I have is that the top strap is very snug.  Large feet. Had to stretch the straps to make it easier to put on."
4.0,"I too have fallen in love with this watch as did everyone who purchased it. I red quarrels of others who now by their after purchase experience gave true testimony. I say now to anyone reading this review and considering purchasing the watch to go right ahead. I received the watch on time, it came in a box with instructions(better than the way Amazon portrays it) as how to use and take care of it which was very helpful, the watch looks and feels good on the wrist. I have particularly small wrist but do not share the sentiments of those who said the watch is ""big and heavy"". I will say this however change the batteries before you begin to use the watch. My batteries died within the first two days of usage, after they were changed all worked well. On average remember this is a cheap watch, but in my opinion it is good value for money and everybody loved it. If you are like myself and you're fed up of the ordinary take the leap of faith. For those of you who have not received a manual with your purchase I have included a link to a short youtube clip showing someone briefly going through the watches setup. It is not the exact watch but it is a similar model from the manufacturer and it works the same way.  [...]"
4.0,The colors are very subtle but overall it is a cute necklace.  A &#34;just for fun&#34; kind of thing.
4.0,Its fairly high quality but a china size of 3xl is equivalent to a U.S. XL  size so it fits tight to be comfortable.  I do like the styling and stitching...looks sporty.
4.0,Served the purpose as a wedding dress
4.0,Was an excellent Christmas gift for my son.. He will love it.. Good quality
4.0,"I really need 100% cotton, this was a little scratch, I have very dry skin, but, then again, I wanted to return it, so I didn't wash it."
4.0,"Wasn't sure about buying this purse because I'm not a fan of the backpack style , but the ability to carry this as a shoulder bag or a backpack appealed to me and I decided to go for it.  I'm happy I did.  This is a sturdy bag and is so much roomier than it looks.  Good buy."
4.0,Smaller then I thought and the ear whole is a bit thick so they kindof stretched my ear hole but they look nice
4.0,"Love this basic jumper so much that I bought it in three colors. Kind of odd, but they each fit slightly different. That said, it’s a great go-to piece. Only downside is that the pants shortened just a tiny bit when I washed it and the straps start to stretch out a bit. I wish they had adjustable straps."
4.0,Bought for daughter as a gift. She loves them
4.0,love this and will wear it until it falls apart!
4.0,Megusta su testura me en canta
4.0,"I got this bag in the Kelly Green option, and it looks exactly as described in terms of color: it really is the definition of kelly green. I was a little disappointed in the texture of the bag because it was described as being very soft, and I wouldn't call it ""soft,"" like leather and even some fake leather can feel. This feels very vinyl instead. However, it is very smooth and seems to be in great condition, from what I can tell so far. It really is a BEAUTIFUL bag, no doubt about it. Moreover it's ROOMY, unlike my regular daily bag, which makes it perfect for organization - everything gets its own place: it has 3 main zippered pockets, all of which are quite spacious for a medium-sized bag, another zippered pocket on the back (see photo), and another [internal] zippered small pocket inside the biggest of the main pockets. Then there are the 2 small internal, non-zippered pockets, also inside the biggest of the main pockets - perfect for a cell phone or a mini hair brush, or a few lip balms.<br /><br />My only REAL gripe so far, the only thing keeping me from ordering a few more of these bags in other colors, is the finish (color) of the hardware - the zippers are gold, and I hate gold hardware on pretty much everything, especially bags and jackets. It works with this Kelly Green color, that's why I bought this bag anyway, in spite of the gold, but on all of the other non-beige-y and non-green colors, the gold looks tacky and ugly. WHY is the hardware of, say, the LILAC bag - a very cool-toned color by nature - freaking gold???? It looks AWFUL in that combo. Lilac looks good only with other cool tones, like silver, not warm tones like gold. If this company releases this exact same bag but with silver hardware (zippers and all the metal parts) instead, then I'll GLADLY order 3 more bags from them in 3 different colors. Until then, I am limited to the greens and beiges in this collection, and I don't need any more beiges... :("
4.0,I bought these earrings for my granddaughter's 18th birthday which is in August. (Peridot) She was delighted! They are beautifully made and look even richer with the 14K gold. They were a perfect size as she likes a bit larger solitaire. I don't think they've been off her ears since!
4.0,"Soft fabric, fits perfectly"
4.0,Love everything about this dress. A lot of compliments
4.0,Zipper malfunctions<br />The dress is low quality but cute. My guess it would retail at a low cost retailer such as Rainbow for about $15.00 US
4.0,"Pretty colors and not too thick or thin. My biggest concern was &#34;sliding down&#34; socks. (I hate it!) These are not too bad considering the soft material it is made of. I am not sure how sturdy they are. I haven't washed them yet. Overall, good purchase.<br /><br />(After I washed them several times)<br />I machine washed them with no dryer. They started getting balls, but not too bad. I wore these with dr.marten and they were coming off my feet inside the boots."
4.0,It look nice however fabric is a little hard
4.0,"Great band, solid material. The strap was a little stiff. The butterfly closure isn't the most comfortable at times but you get used to it."
4.0,"I thought the fabric was thicker. It fits fine, though."
4.0,"The Nike Men's Jordan NFS 23/7 Black Sweatpants are well made, durable and good looking.  I like everything about them except the bungees at the leg opening.  The hard plastic bungees bang against my ankles when actively moving, and they dig into my leg when I happen to rest my legs on them when watching TV  or sleeping.  This is my least favorite pair of sweatpants."
4.0,"This set fits as expected and looks good on, but the material its made of is shiny material more like sleep/lounge wear. I decided to keep it to lounge in because it looks so good on, and I may even wear the top outside with jeans. It's so comfortable I plan to order another one in a different color."
4.0,"These earrings look really good, but their size in the picture seems misleading. The diameter of these earrings are about 2/3 that of a U.S. dime. If that was made clearer in the picture, I may have thought twice. I'm glad I didn't, though, since I've received many compliments on them."
4.0,"This shirt was bought for my wife . She loves it , she does wish the sleeves were a little longer. The color is great the fit is great so over all it’s a winner"
4.0,Great jacket.. really warm.. a lot softer than the one tom hardy wears . I Believe his was vintage.
4.0,"Fine condition, but I bought the wrong ones (Football refs dont wear white stripes on shorts)"
4.0,"Beautiful coat, could not work buttons. If it had a zipper like most raincoats would have been perfect."
4.0,Big for a size 5 but my daughter will grow into them. Great quality of a shoe
4.0,"I ordered this outfit for my granddaughter's birthday party, and she wore it, and it was absolutely PERFECT and DARLING but is poorly made and is truly only a costume.  The dress we got would not survive much wear."
4.0,"I liked the coat, but the zipper is very difficult to use."
4.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to work. It is definitely more work or occasion appropriate. I am 5,2” and 160 lbs. I ordered a medium and I think it’s the perfect fit. I would recommend this dress."
4.0,Cute. Pretty. A little small in sizing
4.0,It am amazing! Everyone love! They ask me where I bought it! Although is not 5 star because a small piece began to peel off already
4.0,"Quality is good, and it is lightweight."
4.0,"We decided to buy this bag for my son for school. It works great to put gym clothes, shoes and a towel."
4.0,"Looks great and is comfortable, however, my son could not manage to fit his hands into the sleeves (it's just a one piece costume). It's tight so there's nothing to grab onto either (I think it runs a little small for the size). However, we easily overcame this issue by cutting the hands off and using them as gloves. He liked this as a Halloween costume and stated he felt comfortable throughout our night of walking around for trick or treating (temperature was around the mid-40's). Overall the look is very good and the quality was also good. The hands are very snug though."
4.0,I like that it’s pretty and sturdy.
4.0,I'm a Soccer Ref in the Pacific North West and I've put these through a lot of wet and muddy conditions as well as turf (both indoor and out). I've centered multiple matches back to back as well as having to deal with long wait periods between matches. Overall I've experienced good performance and really excellent comfort which is what I was looking for. Also kept my feet dry too!!!<br />************************************************************************WARNING**************************************************************************************I've have worn size 11-11.5 since adulthood. Based on previous reviews in regards to the sizes running small I decided to order a 12. It fits just like a 11!!! Don't know if they need to re-calibrate their machine back at the factory or what but definitely go a size up.
4.0,These are cute but they do not come with the jump rings.
4.0,For a pack of necklaces for only $10 they are great. But don't expect anything crazy awesome
4.0,It’s cute and not too expensive. It is on the smaller side though and would probably best fit a child’s head.
4.0,Looks exactly as pictured and fit true to size.
4.0,"Bought these for my wife in a 6.5. She loves them and says they fit great, but she did have a lingering rash after touching the bottoms. She is sensitive to latex and it was a similar outbreak, though she says it was less severe, so we're not actually sure what's in the outer sole but we suspect it may contain some latex. If you have severe allergies to latex I'd recommend staying away from them but if you're more like my wife you might be able to get away with just not touching the bottoms or applying a protective coat to keep you from touching it. [[ASIN:B01IOZKZJS MiYang Womens Cat Print Fleece House Warm Bedroom Slippers Cat Purple 38-39-1]]"
4.0,"Bracelets came in and fit all the 10 and 11 year old boys at the party.  They also glow in the dark, so it does what it says it'll do.  The pictures on the bracelets are tiny, so some of the skins or emote's the kids had a challenging time making them out, but all in all it was a success."
4.0,"El estampado es muy bueno, pero la calidad de la tela no me parece tan buena y es súper delgadita. Está bien pero esperaba algo mejor."
4.0,"Can't tell the difference between real and imitation amber. Nice set, but the toggle bracelet opens up. Replaced the clasp and all is good. Nobody knows it is a very inexpensive set, and I'm glad I purchased it."
4.0,after all I am using them for a Halloween costume prop.  They are mostly black with white here and there on the roses.
4.0,"I saw this dress worn by Ivy on the Bold and the Beautiful and had to have it! Very forgiving fabric, doesn't show panty lines, lumps or bumps... yet very form fitting with firm, stretchy support. I am 5'6&#34; 130lbs and this dress comes right to my knee. Normally I'm a very curvy 4 or 6 but paid attention to reviews and sized up to an 8. I'm glad I did because I couldn't have gotten my butt into a smaller size!<br /><br />I bought the navy, which is so dark it could be mistaken for black if worn in a dark room. Needs to be dressed up with big sparkly earrings, bag & shoes with bling. I also love that the back zipper is hidden, NOT exposed. So over that tacky trend!<br /><br />My only knock on the dress is that it gaps a bit in the bust. I'm a 32D/34C so I'm not flat chested. Nor am I overly busty either. Not sure what the problem is there? Also the cut is low under the arms - cannot get away with a strapless bra without it showing. However, given the supportive, thick material, it's not really necessary unless you need major help. If the cut had been a tad higher (or tighter?) I'd have given it 5 stars. Overall happy and will look for this high quality brand again."
4.0,"This is a very cute top.  My only complaint is that it runs very small.  I usually wear a 14-16 and ordered a 2x based on previous reviews.  Even with that size it barely fits.  That being said, I do really love the color.  I got the hot pink and it is very vibrant.  The fabric is light without being cheap so even with long sleeves you can comfortably wear it in the summer.<br />I do think it's better for smaller ladies.  Make sure if you order to go up at least one size!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for a fair and honest review."
4.0,Super bright!!!!
4.0,I just received this wallet and I love it.  Plenty of room.  Zipper inside the wallet as well as outside.  I will need to use it for a while to see how the product holds up.  I may need to review again later.
4.0,"I love the shoe...it breathes! I ordered a wide and really should have ordered medium. Little too wide, but I put on a couple extra footies to accommodate. Very comfortable walking shoe."
4.0,Nice polarized glasses. They lose a star because I can't find the little V skier on lens.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Very classy and comfortable. A little long on me. But overall loved it.
4.0,Cute but is smaller than 4/5 fits her younger sister better 3t
4.0,"This is simply a normal F-91W with a white plastic case that has been painted silver.  The finish is more of a matte silver, like you'd expect from silver spray paint as opposed to chrome plating.  If you are looking for a *chrome* version of the F-91W, get the A158WA (exposed lugs) or A168WA (a bit thicker) instead and put a F-91W band on it."
4.0,"You’ll see a black “patch” on the left sleeve.  This has a Velcro black disc covering it.  I’m not exactly sure what this is for.  Perhaps it’s so you can attach a  hat or something else to it.<br /><br />There is a hood on this jacket.  Unfortunately, it’s not removable.<br /><br />I have the size Large.  It measures 39” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  The sleeves measure 21.5” from where they attach at the shoulder to the end.  It measures 23.5” across.<br /><br />The shell is made of 100% slick nylon.  The lining is 100% polyester.  The filling is 90% down and 10% feathers.<br /><br />This coat is Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.  At the current price of forty bucks. . . It’s not bad."
4.0,It is longer than I expected comes down to my ankles when it’s on my waist
4.0,"This skirt is great quality! The lining is cotton and  not itchy at all. It hangs nicely and doesnt shiw wrinkles. Grest for all sorts of occasions, dressed up or down. It gets lots of compliments.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that its a little big (I got a size S) and they dont sell XS."
4.0,"I like these for the price and cuteness, but they hardly stretch over jeans. If you are going to wear them with tights, like the picture demonstrates, then you need skinny legs. I stretched them out a bit to wear with jeans, but eventually gave up and gave them to my college age daughter. She wears a lot of dresses with boots and she is a size 2, so the fit was perfect for her. Pretty and a great low price compared to retail stores, but not for use with jeans."
4.0,"Update after 6months: The dress did not hold up. By the end of 5months use, the pattern n bow, started falling off. And 2more washes, it was done. Only one summer wear.<br /><br />This summer dress is beautiful. Like many mentioned, it runs one size small. Better to size up. The color combination is great. I found the pink shorts is one tone lighter than its pictured. But still I loved it on my daughter."
4.0,"I really liked it, thanks, good quality"
4.0,"super cute design! the shirt is not exactly like the photo on the model (not exact adjustable strap or heart ring) but it is exactly how it looks in the photo of the shirt alone, it’s a thin material that i think will be really nice during hot weather! i’m usually an xs and it is true to its size it didn’t fit me as fitted but like i wrote it’s true to its size! overall happy with the shirt!"
4.0,GOOD fit
4.0,I love how flashy these glasses are. They look great on and can enhance any look. I get several compliments every time I wear these glasses. Not only saying is I wish they had a slightly smaller fit.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but DO NOT order bigger. I did from reading the reviews and my dress is huge. I'm 5'1 110 lbs and got a medium because everyone was saying it runs small in the chest area (I'm a 32D). I was swimming in the medium, currently returning for a small."
4.0,I like it looks good with clothes I wear
4.0,"Its ligther than i expected, And the strap looks very fragile but other than that i love it"
4.0,"Nice, large statement watch for casual wear. Easy to read dial. Great bargain, but I'm not expecting it to last very long."
4.0,This runs big
4.0,Ordered a medium and it’s huge! Medium is definitely more like a large! Wish I would have gotten a small :(
4.0,"I like the mask.  I think it looks great, however it is kind of bothersome around the eye holes since its a little small for my eyes and it kind of feels like its pushing my eyelids down, plus you have to tie it (instead of elastic) so it has to push against your face in order to stay on.  But I still like it and may wear it again to another masquerade ball."
4.0,It was ok for the price but order a size smaller.
4.0,"Boyfriend loves the looks of these, he says they feel a bit tight in his 0 holes and they can be a bit hard to get in. We have one pair where the threading did not match up.<br />Overall good for the price"
4.0,"Good and sturdy, just wish they were a lil' bigger on my joint head"
4.0,Loved the bright colors. Cute tank. But the size runs small. I ordered up a size and think maybe I should have even went higher..Now I gotta lose weight..lol
4.0,Tighter than I expected.  Heavier people would have difficulty putting these on and being comfortable.
4.0,"This is a well made, high quality shirt, that has a nice true red color. Can't wait to sport it on college football Saturdays!"
4.0,"I like except one problem the type to the robe is small, you can barely make a bow"
4.0,Sweater is a good replica. I  thought it ran a bit small for a men''s large.
4.0,It's cute. Fades slightly after being washed.
4.0,I love the way it folds to make it easier to get in your car.  The handle type is so handy and the dual waterproof with the sunblocking is just great.  The only disappointing thing (dumb idea) is the comany name is stamped several times on the material inside the unbrella.
4.0,They are comphy. But do not dry them.
4.0,"Wonderful, love the color and the product."
4.0,which waist had a bit of elastic
4.0,product was a little large but not terrible. my wife likes it and we have ordered next smaller size. after 2 day trial it seems to be working but more time is required.
4.0,Bought this for halloween. It is easy to mold and fit into your teeth. As comfortable as a  grill could be I guess. overall this is a good product
4.0,"The fabric is not my favorite, but it does travel really well, which is what I was hoping for!"
4.0,"I have purchased this a few times for friends going through Cancer Treatment. On this particular order, unfortunately I didn't get what I wanted. I ordered two Pink Breast Cancer bracelets and received one Pink and one multi-colored cancer bracelets.  To return the multi-colored bracelet was not worth the effort."
4.0,I loves these ! I have worn them almost every day since I got them. They look like the real things ! They feel a little fragile but not cheap so I am just very careful with them. But they look great on.
4.0,Gorgeous blouse. Love the pearls and the design. Only problem I took a large bcuz I know the sizes usually comes tiny. I should have taken a medium. Regardless nice material and classy top.
4.0,Loved the shirt. Fit as it should and colors were great!
4.0,Stylish and nice fit.
4.0,"Little big but works, love it!"
4.0,Absolutely love this band. The only issue is be careful when extending or reducing the size. The stiches tend to get caught on the adjustment clasp.
4.0,"I bought this set for my dad and brother to share and I have to say, they are gorgeous for CZ. The only complaint I have is a minor one - they are quite a bit smaller than pictured but it's not really a big deal. I'm not the one wearing them and my dad and brother are happy."
4.0,"Really love this shirt, I ordered a small and it is still big, fabric is so soft"
4.0,If your self consious at all about your size it will make you look wide... Just how stripes work
4.0,Received today. The picture looks more like actual long shorts but they’re like a boy shorts style.
4.0,"It looks great.  The fabric falls very nicely,  and is suitably thin. That said,  if you get cold in even a slightly cool evening, this is strictly a summer dress."
4.0,It was Exactly what I ordered
4.0,I normally wear a size Large but figured I would size up one so it fit like the model. I should have went to a size XXL. The buttons don't even button in the hip area. I would have loved it if I had just sized up. It's cute and has a silky material. I'll probably be wearing it as a cardigan now since it's too small to button
4.0,"First thing I noted when I examined the straps was that the rubber adjustment slider felt bulky and cheap but operates properly and has served its purpose. The slide tensioner slides easily but does not slip once position is adjusted while wearing, good thing... I wore glasses while working over the fender of a car and when leaning over the glasses would drag across engine components, tightened adjustment slide and had no issues, plus straps were comfortable tightened close to the neck<br /><br />I noted that the straps could be longer for easier placement over the head. If you have long hair, you may find these too short for you. The straps seem to be of good quality and should last for a long time. The rubber ends slip on glasses with a narrow arm frame at the ends. Once glasses were folded with straps attached, the rubber ends would bend unlike real rubber which flexes. The rubber ends has the characteristics of heat shrink which may present problems if you store glasses in a case<br /><br />I had a hard time getting these straps to slip over my Costa Del Mar Harpoon glasses which has a medium arm end. The rubber would stress, turning white in color while trying to install them, even while using a lubricant... overall, for the price, these are a great value but not suitable for larger framed glasses<br /><br />4 stars, deduct 1 star for strap ends<br />See pics of glasses used for this review below"
4.0,"Very cute tankini that fits as expected.  I don't normally order clothes online because I like being able to try them on, but there really aren't swimsuits left in the stores and I wanted another one to take on my upcoming beach vacation. I ordered for the tankini but it also came with the bottoms.  It also included a waterproof bag for my phone as a surprise.  I'm pleased with my purchase and glad I decided to go ahead and order it. Good thing is, if it didn't fit I could send it back for a refund and reorder and have another one in 2 days."
4.0,These shorts are comfy but a tad too short for my comfort level. I got a size small.  I am 5'2&#34; and 123lbs. I usually fit between a size 2 or 4 in pants. The tag label warns that it can shrink after washing. I am wondering if I should have gotten a medium because it is a little too snug. But I love the color and stretch in the shorts.
4.0,"I have been disappointing my wife for years for not wearing a traditional, metal wedding band.  I work with my hands regularly (outside of my REAL job) and I am active-- hiking, biking, building/destroying things, camping, water sports, workouts (for the common man)-- and simply could not/cannot wear a metal band and have my fingers survive.  Swinging a hammer all day was a brutal affair, but the deal-sealer for me--  I spent almost an hour crammed under the hood of a truck waiting for help to get my finger, which was wedged soundly between the engine block and exhaust manifold, dislodged.  ENOUGH!  I removed my band and hadn't put one on since.<br /><br />After considering, but for now dismissing, a finger tattoo, I ordered the 3-pack of silicone bands offered by Keep Fit; just to try 'em,-- to see how they looked, felt, and performed.  They arrived in one day.  They were packaged attractively, yet responsibly.  The bands inside were manufactured extremely well (ZERO detectable defects- no seams, burs, pits...).  The silver was more lustrous than anticipated.  It does not look like polished silver, white gold, or platinum, but has a luminous, brushed-chrome look to it; not a dull gray that I expected.  If you like the gray look, there's a dark gray and black option in the pack I ordered, too.  The bands are wide enough to look masculine but not uncomfortably wide as some bands are.  So... (I think) they looked great.<br /><br />How do they feel?  They are thick enough to inspire survival-confidence, but not bulky or uncomfortable in the least.  To the contrary, they are so soft and smooth, you hardly know you have anything on your finger!  They have a subtle edge-to-edge taper so movement is unrestricted and the snag-factor is minimal.  Even after my finger puffs up after a run or workout, the band slips (or rolls, if necessary) right off.  You can wash them, subject them to heat and cold, beat 'em up and still good to go.<br /><br />The one-star reduction-  as others have reported, the finish on the silver band does manifest some wear pretty quickly.  Mine has some scuffs and marring, but honestly, the base light gray color underneath disguises the wear well.  It looks, in my opinion, like a well-worn metal band.  Again, I don't think these bands were conceptualized as a REPLACEMENT FOR for metal; more, an ALTERNATIVE TO metal.  The pro/con weighting is user-specific.<br /><br />This specific user is thrilled to have found a high-quality, affordable alternative to a metal band-  perhaps not for high-polish events, and likely not to last forever'ish like some precious metals, but for active guys who use their hands or for those that are in and out of temperature extremes (divers, meat-cutters, surgeons, dish washers, etc.), I would think these bands are ideal.  For $3 each, it was an easy decision for me.<br /><br />If anything noteworthy arises in the coming months, I will update my review, but for now, if you can't or do not want a metal tourniquet on your finger, order a set of silicone bands from Keep Fit!"
4.0,"I don't know about you, but I've never heard of Coevals Club. It's not a very exclusive club apparently because you can get these decent western shirts for cheap here, and they fit and feel just fine. Lightweight like many western shirts I've had, they fit me well (broad shoulders, slightly less broad middle!) and have enough length to cover my belt. Yee freakin haw."
4.0,"They work just fine for your phone, just wrap around wrist and you don't have to worry about dropping phone also very comfy"
4.0,"I love the look and design but I find that it comes unsnapped too easily - so much so that I almost lost it the first time I wore it. Since then, after I snap it, I put a small rubber-band on it to keep it secure. Needless to say I don't wear often - but I like it none-the-less."
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. The band is definitely meant for small wrists though, it barely fits hers. It's a nice watch just beware the small band."
4.0,Watches used to be heavy and bulky but now they are slim and lightweight.  I used to take my watch off as soon as I got home.  I have watches that are so lightweight you forget you have them on.  This one is not quite that lightweight but still easy to wear.  The face is nothing special but that is not a negative. The only thing that is a negative is that the setting the watch is hard because the hands change when the stem is reset.
4.0,Looks nice ...underwear optional
4.0,"Glow nicely, good price for a set of 2"
4.0,So cute and a great price. Make sure you buy a size bigger than you think you should.
4.0,Love the sandal - well constructed and my friends are very entertained by the bottle opener.  I would have ordered a size larger had I known
4.0,very nice makeup table. I used it everyday now. It is very useful. However it does look pretty cheap.
4.0,"They appear a bit &#34;cheap&#34;, but still nice."
4.0,"Take note this is a OVERSIZED shirt.  Material does leave more to be desired, basic cotton synthetic blend rough fabric."
4.0,Cute runs on the bigger side.. fades fast
4.0,This is a good quality ball cap with a nicely embroidered C4 Corvette emblem.  It also has the official GM licensing.
4.0,"I thought I would really dislike this bikini when I first bought it, but I really liked it. It fit well. I liked the material it's made out of.<br /><br />It's different than most bathing suites and drys quickly. It was a comfortable, fun, and bright bikini to wear to the beach and I received many compliments on it when I wore it. I will definitely be using it during the summer!"
4.0,Item was very small and also see through
4.0,"My husband is not wild about these because the fit is a bit tight, probably because one of his feet is swollen, but his physical therapist insists he use them. They help him feel the floor and are helping to improve his balance. There is no arch support. The sole is thin but durable for indoor use, with good traction. They do exactly what I wanted them to do. I just took off one star for the comfort factor, but that may be the fault of the swollen foot."
4.0,I wish the magnet was a little stronger. It adjusts looser as I'm wearing it and starts to dangle. Comfortable as long as it stays where I position it.
4.0,"It doesn't stretch much so it's a little difficult to pull down. It runs small, I am between M and L but I order XL and it's a little tight. The only good thing it's that it's cheaper than others."
4.0,Very cute shoes. We have to wait for our daughter to grow into them since they are a little large for the size listed.
4.0,shoes OK
4.0,"Serves it's purpose well,  well made although the string keeps getting loose upon wearing for a long time."
4.0,"This is a really cute, well-made dress. The fabric is nice and the colors are beautiful it looks exactly like it does in the picture. I ordered a medium and it was too small in the bust. Also it was pretty long but I can always shorten it. I am 5 foot two and approximately 133 pounds have lost some weight recently. I did exchange it for a large because I liked it so much, hence the four star rating instead of five.  Hoping the large is not too big."
4.0,Like the fit and the soft fabric
4.0,Runs a little small so order a size up . Other than that it’s a nice material.
4.0,"Product as described.  Each of the pieces were baggies in different parts to keep it free from fingerprints.  Came with a cleaning cloth and a small maintenance brochure.  Perfect gift for a long distance friend! I only wish we could choose different stones for the tear drop like birth stones.  Other than that, very beautiful! She is going to love it!"
4.0,It's a good look and great price. The fabric makes noise which i wasn't expecting. But I bought it to wear to clubs so it's not much of a problem. Overall happy with it.
4.0,Look exactly like the picture goes great with all of my other outfits with this color scheme and Design
4.0,The fit is small..more like a bra..not a bralette.  I'm a 34D. .. I will still wear it tho. It's cute. Not tight and doesn't cut. Wish it was a little longer like the pic. Nothing spills out because it stretches over the girls. Just wish it was longer
4.0,I got these for my birthday. I loved how they fit besides them being slightly too short. I was wearing heels boots anyway so it didn't really matter.  I normally wear a size 14-16 in woman's pants and ordered the xl. I'm 5'9&#34; and weigh 240 pounds. They do come unlaced but that was fine. That way you can adjust to just how much thing you want to show. Overall they were an awesome fit.
4.0,"Ordered a size up, fits great. Soft fabric. True to color"
4.0,Everything was as expected. Fit very well. Well made. Except the plastic part that fits in the wallet tore a little just as said in some of the interviews. That's to bad because except for this the wallet insert would have been perfect for my wallet. I just taped it up which should hold for some time so I'm not going to send it back as I bought 3 of them just to make sure I had replacements. These are hard to find where I live.
4.0,"Nice band, color could've been a little darker"
4.0,I really like this watch...wish the face a just a tad bigger.
4.0,"This item is very beautiful as well as stylish by only drawback is that an additional currency slot would make it a five stars, otherwise it fits perfectly.<br />I love the color"
4.0,Cute and comfy prob won't hold up long if you don't hand wash though
4.0,I am 5”9 and weigh 160 pounds and the shorts were way too small for me. Love the style and loved the color but if you’re wanting them baggy definitely size up one or two. I had to get an extra large and I usually wear a medium.
4.0,"I love this dress! It’s a great breathable dress for the heat of summer. I get many compliments on it, the neck link is a little low for my taste and has borderline cleavage if you’re looking to dress modestly."
4.0,"Good quality.  Arrived on time.  Looks more brownish than purple, though."
4.0,"I REALLY liked the fit and it's such a pretty dress. Unfortunately, it was something off-putting about the pink sleeve which is actually the thing that attracted me to the dress. I will be returning. If the dress was such the Blue and Black, I would have kept it."
4.0,Cute and inexpensive.  After several wears the elastic does stretch out.
4.0,my grandkids love it
4.0,"Unfortunately, I lost this watch pretty soon after I bought it... BUT, while it was in my possession, I really liked it. It looked nice on my tiny lady wrists and told time accurately."
4.0,I love the design!  The only negative comment I have is that the band is too short and I have a small wrist!
4.0,"It's pretty good for the price i think. The wing was a good size, but have to be careful when bending it into shape."
4.0,This scarf is so soft and drapes beautifully.  Loved the art deco design and the colors shown on my computer.  Unfortunately the pink color on the actual scarf was a pale peach color and not at all attractive (IMO).
4.0,Gwen
4.0,"Great value, fits my daughter perfect."
4.0,"The outfit was very cute and fit as expected overall. The top does roll down and required adjustment throughout the day, especially when I was lugging my 19 month old around. As you may notice my tummy poked out somewhat especially after dinner but I wanted you guys to see the pics with me alone."
4.0,"These fit good, it took a bit to figure out how to strap them in but the instructions were clear. The clear strips help the back not act like flip-flops and stay secure on covered feet.<br />In the end I couldn't wear them because it rained the day I used them, but I did wear them around the house and they stayed secure."
4.0,"Very cute swing dress but no cotton blend, it's polyester.  I love the shade of deep green, it's very flattering.  I prefer to wear with leggings."
4.0,It is very nice for the price. I was expecting light sweater but it is winter one.
4.0,"Came in a nice gift box. The cuff links have good weight to them, feels quality.<br />Have not used them yet, so can not comment on how well it will stand daily<br />wear. Thus, 4 starts."
4.0,"Very warm and cozy. I like the open legs/ not footed. However, the length is more of a Capri length after one wash. Still a great jammy for lounging around."
4.0,Fits just like it should. The only problem is that the legs do roll a bit.
4.0,Love the pendant didn’t love the chain which most of the time anywhere you get pendants the chain is to flimsy but the pendants cute I just upgraded the chain
4.0,Masks a bit smaller than expected.
4.0,"This is really big to wear as a headband. If you fold it in half it's fine, but then you can't see half the unicorn. I have run with it twice and it doesn't move around and it isn't annoying."
4.0,"I love hooded tanks, and I love the Pink Power Ranger so this was a no brainer! It fits a bit snug on me but not bad, the only real issue for me is that the arm holes seem way larger than they need to be, I have to layer it over another tank unless I want to show the world what bra I'm wearing. The black part on the hood is sort of a crushed velvet which I don't love the feel of but I'm just excited to have found a Pink Ranger hooded tank."
4.0,cool halloween accessory
4.0,"Cute, fits very well.lovely material."
4.0,I get Lots of complements when I wear this one
4.0,I would buy this again for sure. The one piece of feedback is I wish the mock turtleneck was a bit tighter and up against the neck. It hangs a bit..
4.0,"The shades are good fit my face perfectly ""thank you"" the shades are dark could be lighter however anyway if you need me 🎁""GIFT""🎁 me a company vehicle or put up something lucrative Akeem yall Akeem RW Ross wouldn't mind soem better friends ones more energetic and more optimistic"
4.0,"Kind of orange, not really red but still very cute!"
4.0,This is adorable.  Pretty color blue.  Received promptly.  Would recommend.
4.0,I love this sweater! It’s a thicker material which tells me it is probably made well (but I haven’t tried to wash it yet so we will see). It is just the right length on me and I paired it with black leather leggings and I am loving it so much! I purchased a medium and am 5’5” 140 pounds and have more muscular arms which have been challenging to find sleeves that fit right - these do!
4.0,"This dress is made with a really great quality, which is surprising for the price! I love the distressing on this - it's not overdone and looks nice. The only reason I look off 1 star is it's not as form fitting as the picture shows. It's a bit boxy towards the bottom (which some may prefer - just didn't work with my body type). All-in-all a great purchase and I would recommend!"
4.0,"not for people with bigger chests, kinda thin, i’m wearing a tube top under it in the picture. but cute and pretty much what i expected for the price."
4.0,"Ordered a size 6, fit was perfect! It was a little long, but other than that it was a good pick. Wore it to my husband's military function."
4.0,"I have a difficult time finding a suit that fits right ( I have a small chest and big ol’ booty), I typically have to purchase two bathing suits in order to get one whole one that fits comfortably.<br /><br />This was great! Love how it is adjustable!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the “frayed” bottom is very poorly done and will rip easily. I would recommend hand washing and hanging to dry."
4.0,fine underwears
4.0,"I purchased these on a whim and they turned out to be a great buy! The colors are vibrant and look exactly as pictured. The leggings themselves are very comfortable and fit true to size. The only small critique I have is that the waistband isn’t the greatest as far as comfort, it could be the stitching or the elastic, it isn’t too tight but rather a bit scratchy. Overall these are perfect for your Dva Cosplay or even just relaxing at home!"
4.0,received as expected
4.0,The towel for your hair is too thin
4.0,Bought these for my wife and she does love them. very lightweight and shiny material. The only thing she would improve there should be the little rubbery piece on the back of the hook to prevent from it falling out of your ear. Great value!
4.0,Grey polarized petfection.<br />Only warning: do not be misled by the photograph the tent on the lenses does not change the pure gray of the view
4.0,Durable & Lovely
4.0,Love the color and pattern on these. I thought it might be a little tight at first (I got the XL) but they fit great and my butt felt comfortable as I did my spin routine! The padding was just enough.
4.0,My daughter had to have the ghost spider costume! We ordered it at the last minute. All others were sold out. I would buy it again
4.0,beautiful watch but stops after a few hours after taking it off.
4.0,My granddaughter loved them. She wears a 2T and I’m glad I took the advice of other buyers and ordered the 5T. The shirt fits perfectly but the pants blouse some over the cuff.
4.0,If you wear a large buy xtra large
4.0,See threw material but fit well nice tummy panel
4.0,These are super soft. We used gowns to transition out of sleep sacks for “grown girl” jammies. I got these for my 21 month old. She likes them and sleeps through the night in them. They tend to get a little static and pills in the wash because of the fabric. They don’t hold up as well as some other gowns we got. But we love carters for the fit.
4.0,"Pros: great pockets, drawstring waist, thin (but not too thin) fabric, VERY comfortable<br /><br />Cons: the black pair has a shorter inseam than the navy pair, drawstring is thin (I need it to be functional)"
4.0,"Fits just right, but the under skirt is a little short, but it’ll still work for my Halloween costume"
4.0,"Really like this cream. Absorbs well, provides good glide for all types of massage. Only drawback is this cream is too thick to pump. (even though Bon Vital promotes it as pumpable)"
4.0,The bracelet is beautiful.  The clasp will be easy for my grandmother to put on. It's a little small in wrist size than I thought. And it smells. Needs to be aired out
4.0,It's fun to wear them at home. It's just sometimes the lower end cannot block the lights from outside so I would feel dizzy.
4.0,Pretty heavy fabric which leads me to believe it will hold up well. I love the way it fits. Also love the pockets. Only complaint would be there is a small hole inside the right pocket which isn’t visible to anyone and will be an easy fix. But you shouldn’t have to fix something you bought new. However I am very pleased and won’t be returning it. It will go perfect with my all black dress code for work. I would definitely recommend!
4.0,"I am woman using this for a costume, as female button downs are expensive and rarely fit. Im 38D, 225, and this fit amazing. It was a little big in the sleeves, but other than that going to work perfectly. It is MUCH more see through than I expected, so it needs an undershirt."
4.0,"I got this as a gift for my husband.  It is good quality, but it is very difficult to see the black chess pieces on the dark blue shirt.  I would recommend going with a lighter color shirt."
4.0,"Really like this hoodie, not too heavy or too light. My only slight issue is that it's way more orange than the picture seems, like construction worker orange vs a darker vintage orange as the picture shows."
4.0,"Oh my goodness , for me this is so much better than the silicon band that came with my fitbit sense. No irritation. Although one end came a bit loose so I glued it back. Other than that I really really like this band. No itching, no rash. Very comfortable"
4.0,"I like it , does run small"
4.0,Got so many compliments on this dress and for the low low price of $40 I went to an event that women pay high dollar for their dresses and got so many compliments just added a zirconia belt and some shoes and I was done. Thank you so much for a great look at a great price.
4.0,Very nice but charcoal color is not very attractive--either go darker or lighter as in silver.
4.0,"it was a gift  to a stylist, she loves it. its a great buy for you hairstylist. they will enjoy it."
4.0,"I just received it yesterday and it looks fine to me, I'm looking for durability so stay tuned."
4.0,It smelled like chemicals but it's pretty.<br />Had to wash.
4.0,Great tights A little smaller than anticipated
4.0,The product arrived as discribed. The overall quality is good. I gave a 4 star rating because there is a metal tab on the back of the clasp which catches the back of my ties and has damaged a couple of them.
4.0,The dress is great. It is good. It the delivery that I have an issue with. They didn't even bother putting it into a mailing envelope.<br />Left on my front porch in a clear plastic bag so that what I bought is in plain view of anyone walking up to my porch. Thankfully I was home and it didn't get stolen.
4.0,"Just received them and tossed them on to give them a days page. They are tight! I wear medium size undies and ordered a M in these. I had to stretch them a bit, I strongly suggest ordering a size higher. They feel great under my regular jeans, no bulges. The side armor is some sort of plastic and the butt has foam padding with a hard plastic tail bone protector.  I feel these will work great with my urban commuting."
4.0,Does protect but the blue covering doesn't match the blue band
4.0,Cute. Great for hot tub at gym without showing my goods.
4.0,"I received this from the Amazon Vine program and am leaving my review voluntarily.<br /><br />I wanted a hoodie that wasn't a heavy material so I could wear it over a tee or alone.<br /><br />Comes in choice of 3 tie dye patterns. Material is soft. I haven't washed it yet, so not sure if it will shrink but I generally drip dry my clothes anyway.<br /><br />I chose the 2xl and measurements  were slightly different than posted so this is more fitted.<br /><br />chest: 26in pit to pit<br />sleeve: 20in<br />length: 27.5in<br /><br />Priced at $30.89 seems reasonable."
4.0,You have to be very close to door before it will open
4.0,"i liked the style but on its arrival it was almost out of the box its a wonder it made it to me, also it was a tangled mess but i was finally able to get it straigtened out, found it did not lay right so swithed the moon with the crystal and it looked and layed  better now all that aside am quite pleased it looks well on and matches well with earrings i already had,thank you"
4.0,"Lovely color.  The pair I received had a few worn spots on the toe and back of heel which is why I've rated them at 4 rather than 5 stars, .  Wonderful heel height and strap is placed in a comfortable position (for me)."
4.0,I ordered a large and it fit true to size for me.  I am short but wore 2 inch heels so the length was perfect.  I got a lot of compliments on how pretty the dress looked.
4.0,FITS PRETTY perfect. Hides my tummy. Love.
4.0,"alittle bigger than i expected, and bigger than most wallets, but it works."
4.0,Very nice quality for the price.  Comfortable and looks nice on.
4.0,Great. They are nice and durable. No problems at all.
4.0,O like it :)
4.0,"stones are nice, keep in mind two of them are glass, not stone.. you can see glue spots"
4.0,"I have small hands so the cup feels a little too large for me but its great for my husband's hands. There is a nice leather smell and feels nice to the touch. It is solid, sturdy and slightly heavy compared to plastic cups.  The only complaint is the bottom is plastic covered with leather on the exterior which feels thin in comparison to the rest of the cup. It also was a little louder as a result of the plastic. We glued a circle of felt to the bottom which took care of the problem.  The dice are just ordinary. All in all we love the cup despite the minor adjustment. It makes dice games much more enjoyable and quieter."
4.0,It has a nice fit and the nylon seems thick and durable...
4.0,"Perfect fit for my husbands face. Most are too narrow, these fit great."
4.0,"I really like the tank tops. I think they are unique and I like the different bright colors. As far as size goes, I'm 5'5 155 lbs and I bought a small and they fit great. I originally bought a size Large and they were way too big but I was going off the size chart. My recommendation is go with your size shirt you would normally wear."
4.0,"I like this dress as a casual, every day wear item. It also works well for Church or other places where you need to look modest, but want to feel comfortable. I purchased a medium because a small wasn’t available. It looks a little oversized on me, but I don’t mind. It’s comfortable, respectable and easy to wash and dry. For your reference, my measurements are 37-28-41 and I’m wearing a medium in this photo. I am also 5’2” and it hits right at/below my knees."
4.0,"This is the first Ekouaer clothing I've bought. I got it a size S for under $8 as a Warehouse deal. On sight, I wasn't sure - it looked so small! But it's decently stretchy and damned if it didn't stretch enough to fit me (long enough torso, long enough sleeves). It looked good on too. I think it'll be great as the old ""base layer"". I've never been a fan of layering but I'm starting to come around; the key seems to be a very snug under-layer, which this is. The quality for the price is okay."
4.0,Fits well under bike helmet. The only problem is I ordered dark grey and received grey/pink...
4.0,"My grandson's birthday was coming up - when asked what he wanted he told me that he wanted me to make him a cowboy outfit! Having just come out of that ""Pirate faze"" he took me by surprise with this request. I proceeded to look for a pattern and after making the vest and chaps I really wanted to round out the outfit. Purchased a hobby horse, ordered a cowboy hat, and then decided it needed one more thing...a bolo tie! After reading about the many for sale, and even looking into making it myself, I purchased this set. First of all, they cost more to make yourself, IF you can find the necessary parts. I liked buying this set, rather than a single one, because of the price but also thought maybe he could get dad to dress up with him. Well, these were perfect. They are sturdy and good looking. Wish I could have found some that were smaller but this will do for a costume. I recommend them!"
4.0,Great Value...........fit as expected.  Nice quality
4.0,Dry pretty and soft. Not terribly warm
4.0,"These sandals are really cute,  appear to be well made.  The size is slightly smaller than others she has in the same size."
4.0,"It was tight the first few wears, especially in the shoulders. But it fits better now and still compresses well."
4.0,Nice tank - wash in a lingerie bag for best results so the lace part doesn't get ruined or snagged.  I only bought them to wear underneath other tops.  Bra would definitely show if worn on own. Really good for the price point.
4.0,They had a break in one of the strap clips going to the button and I was obliged to replace it. This happened after one washing.
4.0,Nice dress fit correct
4.0,"I like the product for the price. I did break the extender chain when trying to get it from the packaging (really my fault, I was in a hurry) but it looks like it can be fixed easily. The earrings are not too heavy but are prettier than I expected. Overall, very happy with this purchase. Will see how long the gold patina lasts, only worn once so far."
4.0,"Big around the neck, other than that its ok"
4.0,Super cure and very comfortable; I wish they came in a ankle height version for summer wear.
4.0,only complaint is that the cargo pockets are kind of small
4.0,"My feet are a size 7 and these fit perfectly, I will say though that they do tend to slip down over the heel at times and that can get somewhat annoying....but other than that, they are good to have and I use them often."
4.0,Love these but the tag says it’s only 50% organic.
4.0,A little smaller than I anticipated. Not sure Amazon truly has long dangly earrings out there or perhaps it was misrepresented in size but I really love feathers and I like the metallic sheen on them. Very durable and I've gotten lots of compliments on them.
4.0,Nice looking dress and it’s pretty comfortable too. Sleeves are a little narrow but not uncomfortable.
4.0,"Seems a little long for a youth, but great product. My 7 yr. old loves it."
4.0,"I think these will be great, I'm wearing them as part of my Halloween costume. :D"
4.0,"This bracelet is very nice and well made, but it was too small for my wrist. I gave it to my daughter and she loved it."
4.0,To express my gratitude for ace
4.0,"I was a little bit skeptical of buying this because there weren’t many reviews. I like it, except the gold on the smiley face does seem to be wearing off a little bit. The other thing is that it is technically adjustable, but it is a pretty thick piece of metal so it is difficult to pull to make it wider. I really like it though, and I get lots of compliments on it!"
4.0,Chicchic
4.0,These are brown not black but still pretty
4.0,Cool shirt. Well made
4.0,Very distinctive
4.0,Grand kids liked it so I liked it. Made a good Christmas stocking stuffer. Kids wore them all weekend like the guys on TV.
4.0,They look pimp as hell
4.0,The sizes are slightly smaller than they claim but the bra is very nice.
4.0,Easy to apply if you follow directions. I think they are a bit too “tall” though. I’ve read that I can cut them so I might pare them down a bit when I have time.  I’ve had  no issues keeping them where I put them.  The placement seemed odd (inside lower corner) but It works.
4.0,If you don't have skin problem with wool they're fine. No lining. But modern fit. Good value.
4.0,Quick arrival. I put clear Polish on them so they won't turn my fingers green. They are cute.
4.0,As shown in picture
4.0,"Delivered timely and in perfect condition; however, it was much too large for my head."
4.0,"My shirt has no tag. When I checked Google about why my Amazon shirt has no tag (I've never before had a piece of clothing without a manufacturer's tag with care instructions), Google says that it cannot be new. What's up?"
4.0,i like this top alot got lots of compliments.  It is a little loose around the waist but worked it with a pair of white jeans and choker.  Never looked back.
4.0,Nice fit for my faux locks.
4.0,"It is a little big around my small wrist but then again I am very petite so I use it as an arm cuff which is actually a whole lot better! The inside of it is also a little uncomfortable as it rubs against your skin and is rough but you could put something on the inside to keep that from happening. Overall, love it."
4.0,So far the helmet is comfortable and protects well
4.0,I really like the shirt. The only thing is that the pineapple was a lot darker thin appeared on the picture.<br />Fit as expected and material was very soft.
4.0,"love it, fits just a little big, but nothing a little bra wont fix. perfect!"
4.0,"The stones are rather dull, but overall, I'm pleased with this item."
4.0,"Soft & a tad see through but no problem, just wear a nude bra for lighter colors. The length hits at my hip (5”3’) so for those of you my height & taller looking to cover your booty, this might not happen.<br />I got XL so that it falls on my body as an oversized sweater (38DD). I washed them in cold & chose the air dry option in my dryer. No shrinkage."
4.0,Really cut but the top is a little large and you have to tie the front extremely tight. The bottoms are really high waisted.
4.0,"Fits well, looks nice. Zipper gets stuck where the band of lace is. Had to have help getting it zipped. Also it says it can be ironed, but be very careful!"
4.0,Amazing protection against sun. 5 hours on cocoa beach not so much as a hint of sun. A little bit snug.
4.0,Ah-Mazing! 👍😊
4.0,Liked it! Would like to order other color👍🏻Even recommended to a friend!
4.0,Bought this for my daughter. Super vibrant and just soooooo pretty!! Definitely worth it!
4.0,The cardigan is gorgeous. I got a 2xl since that is what I normally wear and this was party snug on me.. I was able to wear it but it felt more like a 1x than anything. I recommend this for ladies up to size 1x.
4.0,I didnt think the back of the top was so open as it was.
4.0,"Great for summer. A Little too short for my taste, but could be because I'm a little tall.  Wish the description would give different options on how to tie the straps."
4.0,"This shirt is made of pretty cheap stretchy fabric, but it's good quality for the price. It's cute, a crop top, and the small fit me well (I'm about 110lb)"
4.0,"It's a cute top, but wasn't as long as I expected and not super flattering like I had hoped. I had zero issues with the fit."
4.0,Used the size chart but was 2 sizes too big. Purchased for 11 year old daughter. She is around 5 feet tall and 75 lbs with a smaller build. She won't be able to wear for at least a year.
4.0,"Great, but oh so Long!  I cut 5 inches off the bottom!"
4.0,One of the closest depictions of the actual USN Chief's fouled anchor.
4.0,Color is nice but a little small.
4.0,I like them as they have a good shape that would go with most faces. Only not sure about opening and closing goes as it seems like they are tight. I’m hoping they will loosen a bit with wear or perhaps loosen the screw.
4.0,"I bought XL and its a bit tighter to my liking. I bought these because they looked very close to the 32 degrees brand, but I think the Mojo XL is smaller than the 32 degrees XL.  Despite not fitting me, I think the material and  quality is similar to the 32 degrees which is pretty good."
4.0,"Wore these all day, stayed in place and didn't budge would like a little bit more of support but they work just fine. I'm a nurse and I work long hours and these really did hold up. I'm anxious to see how well the stickiness holds up I don't want to have to keep buying it month after month and I don't wear bras anymore so having a product that has a good stick and reuse, which I have several of them, but this will really tell."
4.0,Very cute w my boots n clothes!
4.0,It fits somewhat larger than expected but it has a nice drape to it. It's flattering and the color is very vibrant.
4.0,Made for a great birthday gift.  The colors were as shown and the recipient love how easy to put in and how cute it looks.
4.0,Nice thin fabric and comfortable. However. brown looks like dark purple.
4.0,"There is a rivet on the belt loop that looks like it could come worked undone over time and the bigger issue is that this belt doesn't seem to be able to stay tight a whole day and it is somewhat difficult to tighten, a bit more than others of this style. Its okay but I tend to grab a different belt when given the choice."
4.0,nice to wear for the gym but you should wear something underneath either a bikini or thong great for the gym or dance class
4.0,Good for Halloween. It's a bit long but I guess I won't complain that there was too much fabric because the alternative is a capelette. It's good for Halloween. Thats about it
4.0,this bluse is everything is so freh material is great the best part is that fit to your size
4.0,I used these as shower shoes in a community lockeroom.  They fit the purpose & stood up to months of daily use.
4.0,"The dress is very pretty. I'm a size 11/13 junior pant and extra large shirt. I feel it's a little tight in the chest, and I ordered a extra large. I feel like it's very well made. I think i will add a sash to the waist. Happy with it, especially for the price:)"
4.0,"Fun earrings, just be careful and handle with care because the hook attachment can easily fall off."
4.0,"These are very nice goloves. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is that they sell up to size 8 when I need 8.5 or 9 size. Once I force them on, they are very warm and comfortable."
4.0,"Works well, but it could use an embedded ""wire"" in the nose bridge to provide a more customized fit at the top."
4.0,"This item looks surprisingly great for the price. The last thing I expected was the claim that the letters and numbers are embroidered would actually be true. The colors are accurate to the image, the numbers and letters look great (though some have an awkward cut) and the quality is generally acceptable for something a bit more expensive. I know this isn't official, thats clear from the price, but it looks very good for what it is. This would make a great gift for a basketball or Kobe fan, thats for sure.<br /><br />The only issue I really had with this is the size. It runs a bit small. I purchased the 3XL and it fits more like an XL+ or maybe a very slim 2xl. Order a size up for body. Only issue with that will be the length."
4.0,Bought this for my husband and he loved it!  Nice material and fits well.  A must for Penn State Fans.  We Are..!
4.0,Works fine. A bit bulky for my skinny wrist.
4.0,Great item and so pretty. Worth the price. The gold color is a little more like bronze and not as shiny as the picture. But still looks good!
4.0,Beautiful color and texture in this lightweight cardigan/jacket.  I ordered up to ensure the arms would fit.  I have very large upper arms causing most sleeves to be too tight.  I will have to take in the sides to get the body to fit.
4.0,"Like many researching this product, I have a big belly which makes belts and belt buckles very uncomfortable, especially when sitting for long periods of time, but often necessary when standing or walking, so I have tried many different types over the years to try and overcome this, but unfortunately none have satisfied, including this one...<br /><br />I will say that this one is one of the most comfortable that I have tried, and I will probably keep it because it is better than many of the alternatives - but it is still not perfect, and it is a bit more expensive than I would prefer.  Specifically, the belt strap itself is more comfortable than many of the others I have tried because it is elastic/stretchy (similar to what suspenders are made of), and thin/flimsy so it rolls and folds over easily without creating pressure points against my belly.  Unfortunately though, the plastic buckle still digs into my belly pretty bad which not only creates pressure points while I am sitting, but leaves red irritated indentions in my skin which take quite some time to go away.  The plastic buckle also seems like it may break easily, but we will have to wait and see.<br /><br />Obviously the solution to this problem is to get rid of my big belly, but until then the search for a belt which I can tolerate wearing all day continues..."
4.0,"I ordered these for my sister for Christmas.  I did not open the package, but they look great---if you are a Penn State fan."
4.0,I love this bag! I use it whenever I go to the grocery store instead of plastic bags. It's durable and pretty big so you can stuff a lot into it. I also like that it is reversable. My one issue is that only $20 of the $59 it costs goes to the World Feed Progamme. I think they should let you know that before you purchase it.
4.0,Great flip flops but don’t forget to size up!
4.0,"I have lost so many pairs of expensive designer shades. These are the perfect disposables to have. Funny story, no one has stolen one form me yet. LOL!"
4.0,"They are beautiful earrings, just a little heavier than I would like.  I will definitely wear them."
4.0,"slightly big for my 6 years old hands, but she will grow into them. cute and hopefully they keep her warm."
4.0,Too large but I waited too long to return it and wait again
4.0,My wife really likes this bracelet but it is smaller in circumference than it appears so it barely clears my wifes small wrist.
4.0,Nice size and not gawdy.  Very thin chain.
4.0,I love this bracelet! It fits snug and looks great!
4.0,"I ordered this dress without much expectation and a hope it would look as good as the picture. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it! The shipping was also exceptionally fast.<br /><br />The dress itself was a bit too large, even though I sent in my measurements. I triple checked the measurement to make sure they were right. I was also hesitant to send in my measurement reading some reviewers not getting good outcomes. Originally, I was just going to order a size 12, knowing I would have to alter it. However, emailing with MACloth customer service, I decided to send in my measurements. The customer service was exceptional, they were very responsive and answered all my questions, making me feel comfortable about my decision. However, ordering with an expectation that the dress will fit perfectly and I would not have to alter it, and then receiving the dress and having to alter it, is why I am deducting one star. I was glad that the dress was larger so that I could alter it, then smaller, since that would have been a deal breaker.<br /><br />Overall, with alterations, the dress cost me about $200 total. I have attached pictures of the final product. I think the chiffon is really nice, not the best out there, but very good quality for the money. The chiffon is also what makes this dress, it flows so nicely. The top of the dress is sturdy (almost like a robust corset?), when I first felt it, it felt weird, but when you put it on, it gives the dress structure. I thought I would not like it and that it would make the dress look “boxy”, but you could not tell when I put the dress on.<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you that are undecided. I looked at this dress for about a month before finally deciding to order it and I don’t regret it."
4.0,cool shirt but runs small
4.0,Not stretchy and fits smaller than expected
4.0,"The moissanite has so much fire and it really is a beautiful ring but the band overall is a bit thick for my taste personally. Otherwise it’s a gorgeous ring and ready to gift immediately, anyone would be glad to receive it!"
4.0,"Esta bonito el conjunto ,esta bn diseñado y es elegante yo lo compré para regalo aún me hicieron el comentario que pesa un poquito.pero es lindo y llevo pronto."
4.0,I got medium and it fit as a large other than that the fabric and material is great came exactly as shown
4.0,"These are about the quality expected for the price. Cute for bed or lounging! If you look at the size chart the company posted you should be fine, but they definitely run way smaller than regular US sizing. I am a 26 ish waist and got a Large, which fit well."
4.0,This is a really cute simple dress. I got in the light blue & it is much lighter than it looks online.
4.0,"Runs small but my wife looks very sexy on this swimsuit, you should buy a size bigger"
4.0,"Perfect fit, light and great spring or fall dress!"
4.0,I liked this product.. the top looks cute and fits well. Only thing I didn’t like is polyester shell.. the lining could have been cotton and that would have made it so much better!
4.0,"This is pretty and feel solidly built.  The chains to make it a bracelet would only fit a small wrist, but I love the different configuration options."
4.0,"Bought in red (everyone said it was orange but I think it is red-ish) because I had to have something red for a family picture and I never wear red and don't have anything red and I don't like red near my face - so this was great with the red just being at the bottom. It's not the greatest quality - I'm going to have to sew up a side seam, but its pretty ok for the price. I also might shorten it. I'll wear it as a blouse and its a little on the long side for that but that's not a difficult change to make, even with the cinched sides."
4.0,"the fabric strted ripping away from the woven bout,  so I had to sew it back together. and I also had to put tape on the ringsbecause the straps kept flipping through the gap. but cute design and perfect size for everyday stuff"
4.0,I really like the large number of compartments.
4.0,"This dress is definitely on the higher quality end than a lot of the PU materials out there. This one is thick, which makes it a lot tighter than some of the PU's. I got a Medium and I typically fluxgate  from an average medium to a larger medium, and I tried this on at my average medium size. I could fit into it but it was TIGHT. Too tight to be comfortable for a whole evening. I then put on about 7 lbs, which is normal for me, and I can no longer fit into it. So I'd definitely say size up, but is is a SEXY little black strapless dress and absolutely adorable if you get the correct size!"
4.0,Buy one size up of what you normally wear
4.0,"After a friend ended up with a DVT after a long airplane flight I always wear compression socks when traveling. Planes, trains or automobiles - if I'm going to be sitting for extended periods I now wear compressions.  These are long enough to fit over my calf.  They give support but are not overly tight or uncomfortable.  I like the fabric pattern - it's jazzy for this old lady."
4.0,Nice. A little lighter weight than expected but a great bracket for the price.
4.0,I just received the bracelet. It's nice. I can use it for my wrist and my ankle
4.0,"Love this bag but the zippers can get stuck and the zippers almost feel like tgey are flimsy to be on tgis bag because of so much the bag can hold. Everything was perfect with the delivery it was in great condition, i love the packaging it came in. I love this bag just a little afraid of the zippers."
4.0,I ordered a 5XL to ensure it would fit my bust and it does not. I wear a size 14 but my bra size is 40H. This corset is almost too big for my waist but too small for my bust to the point of making my breasts look misshapen.
4.0,"good fit,decent quality!"
4.0,the pants came with a small rip in the leg which I sewed but overall this is a good set
4.0,"The crochet hits right where your butt is so it is hard to work with. I wear shorts with it, but then you do see the shorts through the hem in the back."
4.0,"This is a good basic white shirt to have in any ones wardrobe. It looks as good in person as it does in the picture, and just as in the picture it is a bit thin. So it can be worn in any season. As is in the summer and fall, and layered in winter early spring."
4.0,Good product. Met my expectations. Am wearing them now. Good job.
4.0,i am 5 feet tall and they fit like capris length.  Other than that true to size and real cute.
4.0,"My mom loved this shirt.  But order a size up. We order 2 sizes, had to go with the bigger one."
4.0,"For the price it is surprisingly good quality, my daughter loves it. goes great with the costume and the crown."
4.0,It is light and comfortable and great for hot humid days ahead
4.0,Great dress.  Longer sleeves to help as the weather cools down.
4.0,I really love these earrings. Thought they were a bit small but i still love them.
4.0,"We got this for my daughter’s MHA costume, fits good, decent quality."
4.0,Bought this for my Granddaughter...she loves it.
4.0,Not as shiny as I hoped it would be but still cute!
4.0,"I have several pairs of this bran of leggings. (I purchased pop fit leggings and loved them convenience of the pockets, but could not afford their prices (and honestly their selection was a bit too sporty for me) these leggings are comparable with 2-3 pairs for the price of one popfit. The pink is a kinda strange rose color (kinda more mauve than pink) but I already had a Capri pair so I have a top to match and thought they would be this color."
4.0,They feel great just what I was expecting
4.0,"Gorgeous, does the job and decent price. Hard to find traditional/ethnic earrings without spending a lot or traveling somewhere where they are sold more commonly.<br />Minor issue bringing the rating to 4/5 and that is that one earring has additional “molding”/structure on the backside of the earring whereas the other earring does not have it. See photos for better explanation.<br />Will not cause any issue with wearing it however, it may bother some ears or look off to others. Not high end quality nor high end price.<br /><br />Overall, nice earrings for the price. They are absolutely beautiful and look stunning. I would recommend for limited wear."
4.0,Love this wallet/checkbook cover.  Looks  and feels good.  Really like the fact that it is RFID PROTECTED.  The price for it was really good.  Wish I needed a second one in a different color.
4.0,"Cute and comfortable but beware of you are a larger chested women. I'm a 32DD in Victoria secret which is probably a normal 34C and not what I would consider ""large"" and I got both the M and L. There was an obvious different in the size of the bottoms but not the top so I kept the medium. I do have to stay vigilant because a nip slip is just one wave away but I do LOVE the suit! I'm actually planning on buying another one in the neon green!<br />I'm 5'6"" and weigh 155"
4.0,I bought this as a work cover up for the summer months. It's perfect. The fabric flows and makes for a more professional look over a plain tank top.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, arrived quickly and well-packed. Prettier in person.Great price. Be aware that in order to get the fullness in the skirt show in pics, you will need to purchase a petticoat thing. Otherwise, poof is minimal."
4.0,"Sizing is correct, and the material is nice . Was super comfortable to work out in. My only issue with the fit is the sides flare just a little right at the bottom of the big arm cutout"
4.0,"They do wear down in the silver but I love them! I just bought another pair because for the price, you can afford to replace them as they wear down. Just shows how much I wore them!"
4.0,"Very sexy dress. It is a little longer in the front than the picture shows, but it's an easy fix. I got a lot of compliments when wore it to a wedding."
4.0,"I bought these as a Christmas present. My sibling wears these everyday outside and in the house, 7 days a week. After eight months of abuse from a hyperactive child have they started to sprout holes (and to be honest they would have lasted longer were they not worn across a rocky backyard for every trash run). As an indoor slipper they're great and best of all machine washable (cold wash, preferably in a pillow case to keep them from getting lost)."
4.0,The USA flag mask are very comfortable for me (a woman). They were too small for my husband. Great value for the money. Great 3 ply mask. Needs a layer of polyester to help even more to prevent the spread of a virus.
4.0,I wear mine often. There is not any elasticity in the fabric and sometimes it can be a little warm but it is comfortable and durable otherwise.
4.0,The tank top is very soft and stretchy! I love the added detail on the back. I just wish it was longer in the body and not as wide.
4.0,This is a gift. I hope it fits
4.0,Black color is perfect 👌🏽
4.0,The belt works wonderful and is what I expected it to be.
4.0,Great shirt for the money.
4.0,"I have wide feet, so I ordered up to size 7 to be safe. They definitely fit well, and I'm glad I sized up. I'm usually a 6 or 6.5. The heel is a good height - can wear them for most of the day before my feet start to get unhappy...but that's at a mostly desk/sitting job. Definitely super cute and what I wanted, though! The pictures of the taupe suede are very accurate, also."
4.0,"The jacket is short, very short. I am 5’2 and 115lbs and a small didn’t come all the way down to my hip bones and I have a very short torso. If you have a long torso this is not the jacket for you. It is fitted well and flexible and has a flattering shape. I kept the small to wear over dress but am going to order another color in medium hoping to get a bit more length."
4.0,Elise bloom medium floral dress. This dress is very cute it has adjustable straps and a slip underneath. The material is rayon and sewn well. I recieved the medium I am 5'4 110lbs and a 34D. The dress fit just right in the top but it was larger than I like everywhere else. The dress landed at the middle of my calves which is perfect for a flowy dress of this style. To fix the extra materiel and make it more snug through the middle I pinned it in the back and created a gathered look. It turned out great. The bottom sides of the dress are slitted for a even more comfortable flowy look. The yellow flowers and green foliage are very bright and vibrant. The dress because of the slip is not see through. Great summer dress.
4.0,"I had to go up a size for it to fit. If you want your daughter to wear all year, go up two sizes. Overall, it’s a very nice blouse."
4.0,"The key is a lot smaller than I expected.  Looks nice though and came in a nice little box.  It's not too flashy, and I like that about it."
4.0,These are great and kiddos feet are comfy but their toes hang out quite a bit so I ended up going with a closed toe version of a similar brand
4.0,A little big but I do have very small feet. Not bad.
4.0,"Nice time piece!, There was a problem with delivery but i got it 8/8/19"
4.0,"The middle of these rings is small. Very small.<br />I also don't see much bling, but they are pretty."
4.0,"It would be nicer if it was a little thinner, but it works and looked good for the price. Thanks"
4.0,"My daughter is a size medium, and really liked the look of this dress. She loves how comfortable it is, and the color as well. However, it is not as form fitting as the one in the picture. It is rather loose, so if you want the form fitting look, you should probably order a size down. Other than that, she is very happy with it!"
4.0,I like the feel of the material and the way the dress flows.
4.0,"If I get a 34, it's usually tight. If I get a 36, it's usually loose. I love the elasticity of these jeans but will need to get an alteration to make them fit just right 🤙🏽"
4.0,Well worth the money.I am so pleased with all my purchases
4.0,Me quedo bien $
4.0,"Nice looking, it's just little to big to the side (because of the filter)<br />I believe if without the Filter, it would be nicer looking."
4.0,"the description said to get an extra size of my original size, it's beautiful and fits perfect"
4.0,I’m 5’6 and around 140 lbs. I bought the extra small after reading the reviews. I normally wear a sm/md. It fits loosely but doesn’t look sloppy. Fabric is light and airy. Overall happy with the dress.
4.0,"Very long, very colorful, nice material."
4.0,I generally buy mine big but this one seems to fit fine.
4.0,"They have sharp edges making them a bit uncomfortable to get in and out, otherwise, look great and are okay to wear"
4.0,I ordered two wigs for my &#34;things&#34; and they arrived quickly and were perfect to complete their costumes. Good quality items. And everyone that saw them was impressed.
4.0,A little big and low cut. Really cute though
4.0,"Like how it fits, had to roll up the sleeves because they're big/hang lower than I personally like. This particular set is true to size."
4.0,"The quality of the robe seemed good for the price. The material was a little thin, which I could have lived with, if it fit. This robe is very small in sizing. I am 5'5"" and wear a size 6-8 in women's pants and a S/M in shirts yet the size medium robe barely covered my chest. It definitely runs on the small side, so if you are purchasing, order at least one size larger. I think this robe would be best if you are wearing clothing underneath or are in the privacy of your home."
4.0,"cool look, but shorter than expected. I'm an 8th grader and it looks a little bit short. (Maybe I should've gotten an adult one)"
4.0,"5', 170, 44B.  Apple shape.  It bunched up at what should have been my waist.  Very soft fabric, no slip needed. Clearly, it was too long for me everywhere, shoulders, sleeves, waist, length.  Those models are tall, 5'5&#34; or more. Learned my lesson, now I only look at &#34;short&#34; plus size dresses."
4.0,This was a guid vest. Especially for the price!
4.0,"Love cotton gowns. Living in Mexico, it can get rather hot and humid and these can keep you cooler than a poly or nylon."
4.0,Very shiny very nice as expected will purchase again
4.0,Good quality for the cost. Rustic looking like I was hoping for.
4.0,Strong leather finely woven. The plate is not as the picture. The plate is darker I wonder if its tarnished.
4.0,"Good looking, well made cap. I've had a few snapback lids and this one seems to be slightly small. Fits around the head as most would but there is less room than most inside the cap. So it has more of a tendency to point upward than all of my other caps and trucker caps. I have a large head so it may not bother others. I still like it and will wear it as much as any other."
4.0,"This was a gift, and she loved it!"
4.0,"Looks good, fits well, kind of on the cheaper side of material."
4.0,The perfect color
4.0,"I bought this for my husband. Good quality and comfortable. Nice design. Bought a large and fits like a large. Given 4 stars because I feel like it is a bit pricey for a shirt, but I guess that's what you get with a brand name."
4.0,"Terrific for suicide awareness! They are too expensive for what you receive, but no biggie, I bought 2 more packets!"
4.0,"Oriflame dust mask is gorgeous, beautiful, full cover, comfortable. I have just ordered more of it."
4.0,"the receiver of the gift loved it, bur wished it had a pocket."
4.0,"Great value and variety. Disappointed though because I mainly ordered for the hello kitty head and charmander, which I didn't receive:("
4.0,"Comfy, warm and hold their shape washing after washing!  They only thing that kept this from being a five star rating was the 'fuzzies' my children get when wearing them, they refer to them as Hobbit feet so it's not too bad;-)!"
4.0,Fits really tight to wear it leaves marks after u take them off
4.0,"Fit exactly as expected. A Small fit my 5'6"", 115 pound granddaughter with a little room to spare. Didn't want it skin tight, so we were pleased.  She said it was comfortable through the whole school dance."
4.0,"I wear a women's M to L with a 36C bra size. I originally purchased the white in size Large and had to send it back. The top is designed with so much extra material in the front that the Large was just way too big and swamped me. I returned and reordered a Small. Out of the packet it looked too small but after trying it on the fit was perfect across the chest with plenty loose fabric around the mid section. The straps are adjustable and the elastic around the waist is not too tight or uncomfortable (I wear a size 10 jeans). Due to the elastic waist, the top sort of &#34;puffs&#34; out and is great for hiding my stomach. The fabric is really nice and soft similar to modal or rayon/spandex and is very stretchy but not clingy at all. It's thick enough not to be too sheer if a skin tone bra is worn. Overall it's a great quality top and I would recommend purchasing but possibly ordering a size smaller."
4.0,"The size:<br />These shoes offer support. I ordered a 9ww which is my correct size. They fit well, with room for a thin sock. My left foot is bit wider than right, so I need ww. This brand enclosed 3 kinds of pads, for your comfort & size adjustment. Ex. If one foot is smaller you can use a slip in a pad. Toe box has ample room.<br /><br />The look: These Mary Janes are not feminine, I’d call them serviceable & sturdy. IMO. Good for walking, pumpkin picking, choosing a tree, not for your first date!"
4.0,"I bought these socks for my two year old son who has AFO's (leg braces). Because of the braces he needs socks that go above the knee, and since we live down south they would have to be on the thinner side. These socks are perfect for what I've been looking for and he's not complaining of discomfort. I will definitely be referring other friends to these socks as well."
4.0,"These are cute earrings. Not fancy, but I get lots of compliments when I where them with boho looks. My only complaint is that some of the small decorative beads don't stay glued so they are easy to lose when you take them off"
4.0,I really do like this crop top and it fit but if your bustier than most then idk if you would want this one lol but I do really like it
4.0,"Unusually I wear a small so I ordered a medium after reading the reviews and it fits nicely. I wear a 32C I am 5'7&#34; and 115 pounds. I was worried the butt would be way to small because I kind if have a booty, but the medium worked perfectly."
4.0,Stretched with minimal effort/wet & took 2 days
4.0,"I get complements everytime I wear this. I love the style, the fabric not as much. It's slinky like swimsuit material and didn't breathe as much as I'd hoped but overall it's adorable."
4.0,"it protects the sunlight really well.<br />My mom had a skin problem so because of that she needs some protection from sunlight.<br />This hat serves that purpose really well. Top of the hat can be detached, and quality is great.<br />It is not that expensive, and was affordable. Overall I like it a lot."
4.0,"This is a really pretty watch. Unfortunately, the face is already scratched, but for the price, it's not a huge letdown. So far, the band is holding up really well. This watch does not have a second hand, that took some getting used to. Overall, I'm super pleased!"
4.0,I returned them because the shorts were too short.
4.0,"Wish these came in 24/25. I got the smallest size, 26, and it’s just a little big. I really like the jeans though, but surprised the tall wasn’t actually a tall length."
4.0,looks good for the price
4.0,"Bought them for my son to wear under his rugby jersey and he loves them, warm but not bulky.<br />*** But it took forever for them to arrive. I should've received them on 3 February, JUST got them today."
4.0,These exceeded my expectations. I was looking for nice studs for every day wear. I have received several compliments in the short time I've had them. I purchased disk backs for the larger pairs and it gives them much better stability. I would definitely recommend these earrings.
4.0,"I thought it was going to be a sweatshirt type material, not sure if I just didn’t read the product description properly or if that info isn’t available. Either way the set is comfortable, especially the joggers. The sleeves on the shirt are a bit weird, baggy at the top but tighter through the forearm. Either way I find it to be comfortable despite not being what I expected. The tie dye is screen printed on though which is why I’m giving it 4 stars, it looks pixelated. The pants do run large though and are extremely high waisted."
4.0,The only downfall I had with the bells I ordered is I only received four of the five the second two smallest Bell was the one I needed the most and it was missing.
4.0,"However, it does have a pinkish color instead of looking white or off-white like the pictures… FYI."
4.0,"Gosh, this is pretty. I'm glad it's true to size."
4.0,"My husband need new socks all the time. He's on his feet all day and some brands that I've bought him went straight to the garbage after he got home from work. These are good quality socks. They keep his feet dry, unlike some of the others. They hold up well in the wash. No shrinkage and no unraveling. The only problem is they're a bit tight. He had difficulty putting them on. It may have been a good idea if I had sized up."
4.0,They look smith and perfect. I am just scared they go dark or color changing. I hope they don’t honestly
4.0,I was very pleased with this especially for the price I paid.  Nice weight to the fabric which helps us Plus<br />Sized women out as far as the overall look.  The print on the fabric is a little wonky making it show it’s an inexpensive shirt.
4.0,Cool hat. Kinda small.
4.0,Shoe comes apart when in water.
4.0,"Currently using this case. Added a ring. to make it easter to hold.  Durable. Pretty. Big bumpers, good for safety.  Rubber edges loosen up from time to time, when pulling from pocket, etc.<br />Only usability drawbacks are:<br />1. this case is thick and wide. Doesn't fit in my car cup holders or console cut outs, so I'm probably going to change out.<br />2. Edges make swiping from all sides difficult."
4.0,Loved the dress except it was a little long for my height. Did some adjusts and I was good.
4.0,"I had originally ordered a large size based on the reviews.  After trying it on, it was too small. Based on how that fit, i ordered up to a plus size. I should've  ordered the extra large because  I'm  swimming in it. I probably  should have exchanged it for an extra large. Otherwise,  its lovely. So order your true size. Its also alot heavier weight than i was looking for. For me, its great for winter, or cool nights. But its too warm for me to wear in the 68°F  daytime weather here in Vegas."
4.0,Shoes were difficult to get on with everything tight and smaller than expected.  Dissapointed for Nike
4.0,Would definitely order the next size up if I purchase again. Good support and comfortable. Straps hold you up better than other cheap nursing bras I’ve ordered off amazon.
4.0,"Just FYI.  The word Fleece is in the title.  It is not fleece.  The description states 100% cotton, and then a few lines later it states 50/50 cotton poly.<br /><br />They are nice and comfortable.  I just wanted to let people know fleece is inaccurate and possibly misleading."
4.0,I absolutely love them!!!
4.0,Loved these masks. Beautiful colors and very comfortable.
4.0,Bonitos aunque grandes para mi gusto
4.0,Runs short - order a half size up from your regular size. Shoe is on trend and comfy.
4.0,This dress fit great. It was actually a bit longer than pictured on the model. It’s stretchy material that shows everything so I would need to wear shape wear. I will be returning as it is weird in the shoulder area. It’s too large and shows my bra.
4.0,"The dress fit perfectly,  4 stars for the off center v neck. Nice fabric, in fact heavier than I need for Texas."
4.0,Nice cleats
4.0,I bought these to use as mini-suspenders to keep my knit pants from sagging down. So far they work well.
4.0,Nicely cut.  Well made & comfortable to wear.  Wish you had it in a more vibrant color as well as the black & Navy blue.
4.0,I love this pack! The only thing I wish was different is the sizing... I have the XS but am normally a womens medium in everything else...this is even a little big for me
4.0,Love this skort!!
4.0,Love it! It fit jus perfectly. I received plenty of compliments
4.0,It’s a good sweat shirt hoodie and I would by again. I would like the neck hole to be a little bigger but that is just a small detail. Perhaps a lighter weight version would be good.
4.0,"I bought these for my husband. I'm glad I read the reviews saying they run small. He normally wears a 10, so I ordered an 11 and they were a little snug, but stretched a little and now fit great."
4.0,"Is it me, or are eye glasses just getting bigger?  Anyway, most of my large-ish sunglasses fit in this case.  I also use them to store small stuff that seems to float around my car, i.e., hand wipes, a few napkins, a lipstick, etc.  It nicely contains everything and I can see what's in there without opening the container (yes, I'm just that lazy)."
4.0,"These are narrow, thankfully my toddler has small feet"
4.0,"I like its tight fit and the long neck. It is also very good at wicking away sweat, which in the Arizona desert is highly desirable when trying to keep the inside of our helmets from smelling like a gym locker room. The only thing I do not like, and this applies to all balaclavas that I have found, is the seam that runs from the forehead over the head to the back. It is uncomfortable and leaves a depression on my forehead. That said, I have bought more than a few MOTO-D head socks."
4.0,Liked that there were card holders both front and back. Plus added bonus splits in the middle to carry money.
4.0,"Although this is what I would consider ""costume jewelry"", it is quite stylish and pretty. Its not an expensive piece, making if affordable for anyone who wants the look of a diamond neckless, but without the price of one.<br /><br />I have several ""real"" LeVian pieces in the strawberry gold color, and this necklace has a very similar tint to it.<br /><br />The pendent piece looks fantastic, its very cute, sparkly, and all of the CZ gems look good. My biggest issue overall with this necklace is the chain. It seems slightly ""chunky"" for this pendant and has a slightly different color to it. Not that anyone would notice it while you were wearing it, but upon closer inspection I could see the variations in what I received.<br /><br />This piece would be great as a Valentine's Gift for teens. Its pretty, certainly in a teenagers budget, and doesn't break the bank. Overall its a pretty decent piece and stylish."
4.0,Many compliments at work
4.0,Adorable necklace.  Adds that dramatic touch to any outfit.  Quality is good for the price.
4.0,I have been please with the quality of this chain.  It is substantial enough to be tugged and it does not stretch or weaken.
4.0,"Nice overall, expected it to be more loose towards the bottom"
4.0,"Love the style and the lenses clean nicely. One of them popped out, but was easily put back in."
4.0,"Decent quality , good product , was missing a diamond piece unfortunately but they are making it right and sending new ones !"
4.0,Pretty good and very comfortable. However it came with some stains on the outside I think from the water proof agent which was a bummer.
4.0,"KN95 Face Masks for Women Men, 30 Packs Individually Wrapped Tie Dye Design Mask, Adult Sized Colored Mask, 5 Ply Breathable Comfortable Protective Mask<br /><br />We're starting to feel like the last family still masking indoors, but at least with these masks, it's more comfortable. These masks are nice and thick and solid feeling, but still breathable. The ear loops are soft and comfortable, and the nose wire is handy and minimizes glasses fogging. I like the prints, which make me feel less like I'm in a decontamination unit than the all-business medical masks. But they still have a good seal and good filtration. I like that they're individually wrapped so I can keep a few clean in my purse or glove box.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the joints for the ear loops occasionally break when my daughter wears them at school. She does knot the loops for a better fit, but I think that makes the little heat-welded ""seam"" more vulnerable.<br /><br />For extra close wear like air travel, I still prefer the clunky old N-95s for the superior seal, but for everyday wear, these area  great compromise of security, comfort & appearance."
4.0,Nice Costume quality.
4.0,"A little cheap looking, but it still looks good for the price. Order a size up, I am 5-3, 115lbs., I ordered a small and it hurt to wear after a while."
4.0,"This is a good, little girl's leotard. It fits as expected. It stretches adequately and isn't tight. It's great for weekly dance classes that require simple, black leotards."
4.0,I really liked the design of this necklace but it is too short for where I would like it to hang around my neck. I planned on adding it as a layering piece but I more than likely will purchase another one in a longer length and give this one to my baby cousin.
4.0,I wanted a daisy print sweater and found this one.  It’s nice for the price and fits well.  I recommend it.
4.0,Great inexpensive pair of sun glasses. Would be 5 stars if they were polarized.
4.0,"I love the color of this bag on the outside. Not as thrilled about the inner color, which is orange. The inner pockets are less roomy that I was expecting, but I have a tendency to overload bags so this doesn't detract from the usefulness of the bag."
4.0,It is skullcap. Does not cover ears even half.
4.0,"I really like the style of the glasses, but they are a bit loose and fall off if I bend over."
4.0,"Love the color and cut, although the velvet dried quickly and look nice it was a little bulky and thick on the stitching part which was bothering me, otherwise it's a nice suit, top runs small I'm a 36c and it was little too revealing bottoms fit true to size very cheeky."
4.0,"This band looks great, but it was hard to figure out how to adjust it as someone not experienced with watches. The part of the band that meets the pins is also a little loose, not to the point of risking detaching, just enough to make it jiggle if the band is not really tight. Definitely worth the price though."
4.0,"Would’ve given five stars, but the figpin box itself had some sort of sticker residue left on it. Was easy to clean off but would’ve preferred it to have coke residue free."
4.0,"I liked the 5 clasps, I need more support and this bra I provided it in that area. Alot of cleavage. It does make you look like you have cone breasts, but overall am satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Very light weight and looks nice.  I've has this for about 2 weeks and it's a little stiff but over very nice
4.0,"My daughter has sensory issues and shoes and socks always give her a problem. She really likes the socks. They don't bother her nearly as much as others we have tried. There are no extra threads inside the socks to give her discomfort. And they are supper cute so she loves wearing them All. The. Time. So we did find out that that is not a good idea. The reason I gave 4 stars is the quality is amazing, but I have to remember these have such nice soft fabric to serve their purpose that they shouldn't be worn as slippers for two straight days. She liked them so much, with the bows and all that she has almost worn holes in them already. And only after the first few times she has worn them. But for the price and comfort she seems to feel, they are more than worth it!!"
4.0,"If quality was your goal, it was not achieved.<br /><br />Edit: Seller reached out and rectified issue, I have upgraded review to reflect the customer support, which is A+."
4.0,"This is SUCH a pretty dress! I have a hard time finding things that fit nicely, without busting out at the chest. (See what I did there?) But this dress has quite a bit of stretch as the fabric blend has spandex in it. It is a very flattering style, I'd imagine for most body types. I ordered this in Medium, as I usually wear a 10 in dresses. If it weren't for the stretch, I could almost have gone up to a Large. It's a bit heavy, so it will be lovely for cooler weather. I wish they had more colors, I'd LOVE it in teal! I'm ordering one in black for my daughter immediately.<br />**I would have given it 5 stars, but the navy isn't close to the one pictured. It is so dark, it's hard to tell if it's black or blue, even in the sunlight."
4.0,I like that I didn't feel pain behind my ear and they don't feel heavy.
4.0,"The sizing you choose from the drop down menu is liated in asian sizing, so order up one size (or 2 if you have a large booty).<br /><br />One thing that bothers me about this is how the top is not padded whatsoever (it has this soft mesh reinforcement on both the top and bottom, but I don't consider that padding). Some of you may not mind, but I'd rather not have people staring at my nips if they got hard from jumping into cold water. Other than that, it's great quality and a regular bikini swim suit. It's 90% polyester and 10% spandex.<br />It is also see through as it doesn't have another layer of opaque cloth underneath.<br />The string to tie up on the top is very short, I almost couldn't tie it into a knot.<br /><br />The color hasn't faded yet, but I've only gone swimming once for 3 hours.<br /><br />I wouldn't recomment this to busty/curvy gals and people who mind if others can see their nipples.<br /><br />I recieved this product for free for my honest and unbaised review."
4.0,"My sis loves the bag. This bag is very small. So if you are a small person, or someone with a petite frame or teenager this will work great for you. Bonus that it folds up and away."
4.0,Wish it was a little larger
4.0,"DESIGN, QUALITY, BUT ARE A LITTLE SMALL, I RECOMMEND TO BUY SIZE BIGGER"
4.0,These are piercing style earrings that arrive in cartridges that fit piercing tools. I just wanted the earrings and was able to open the cartridges to remove the earring. They are a pretty light blue with well-fitting backs.
4.0,Nice......Tks
4.0,"I looove this shirt. Its been a favorite style recently and this one is perfect for layering. Its light, but a t-shirt under goes great. Itsgreat that it has pockets, and they have zippers on them to keep closed. My only thing is that besides the zipper area, the pockets are not sewn in anywhere else. Like the pocket itself can hang down below the shirt. If i put a phone in them, it would deff hang down so you could see it under the shirt. I didnt use the pockets and loved howit fit. Id buy moreif not for the pockets."
4.0,Not too bad. A jewel was out in the bag but that's to be expected it happens no matter where you but them and for how many you get for the price they are worth it. I especially like the gold with blue jewel.
4.0,"These whimsical little birds were a nice little decorative addition to my home.  I love seeing them as i walk by my door every morning and evening and just about every other time I go in and out of my house.  I haven't had a chance to test out the rape whistle yet, but I can update this review when I do."
4.0,"These pants are great! They are long capris on me (I'm 5' 2 1/2 &#34;), and they fall about mid-calf. This is great because they don't bunch or move like some of the other capris I have from this manufacturer (which fall just below the knee). The print is vibrant, and I appreciate the pocket. The only complaint I have is that they are not 100% opaque, unlike other pant's I have from them. I definitely have to choose my panties wisely! Be aware of that while you are purchasing."
4.0,"Very good quality of steel and nylon. Put together nicley, its comfy and looks like it'll be durable. The only con is I wish it was half inch longer so the folding of the nato looks clean."
4.0,"It's perfect! Great size, not too big not too small and made amazingly well. Love it!"
4.0,Fabric is very thin. Looks good now but not sure after couple washes.
4.0,"The dress fits wonderfully and it’s comfortable. I’m a little bummed about the color, the color in the pictures makes it look like a royal blue color. The color of the dress I received is almost a faded royal blue, almost Greyish blue."
4.0,They are adorable! Soft and so cute. Using for a white elephant gift exchange gift.
4.0,New work dress! Comfortable and flattering. Not a fan of the buttons but get compliments on it!
4.0,Great simple summer dress.  Lightweight.  Great for hot days.
4.0,"I bought the XXXX size based on waist measurement - these are tiny. Fortunately they also stretch! So they work and I'll use them until they wear out, but will try to find a more correct fit when they do."
4.0,Beautiful dress. I got a size larger than needed and still tight.
4.0,"Super cute, as pictured but runs large. I am 5’4” and 120lbs and I ordered a Medium and had to return because it was too loose."
4.0,"I love it! the material is not the highest quality, but it is soft and warm. take care when washing!"
4.0,It was great I just had expected inner ties to keep the robe secure. Otherwise it is a good product!
4.0,"It’s comfy, true to the size, it’s a low cut though"
4.0,Fits wonderfully and looks so real!
4.0,"This is an awesome sweater - I usually wear 14 / XL. I got the XL and it fits perfectly. Well made. I have washed it several times (hung to dry) and it has maintained its shape - and I have managed not to snag it (yet). My only disappointment is that the color is stated as ""pink"" and although the photo on my computer looks a more peachy pink, the color in the sweater I got is a very bright peach (not pink at all). I would have preferred it to actually be pink."
4.0,"Used this kit for piercing a nose a few days ago. Everything was legit. The clamps are a little flimsy, but worked just as well. The jewelry is solid and the needles were in sterile packaging. The alcohol swabs were dried up but no worries there; we had some extra. Also, if you want to put in 16g jewelry use a 15g needle or you won't get the jewelry in. I learned that the hard way."
4.0,"I ordered this for my grandaughter for Christmas.  She loved it because it was adjustable.  Since she is older she told me she will wear this for school dances.  If it passes the tween tests, I would recommend."
4.0,I am very happy with the gloves.  They are thicker then what I thought I was buying which is a plus in Upper Michigan.
4.0,I thought the hat was adjustable. I ordered the hat that was adjustable and was sent this one. Lucky i have a big head.
4.0,"The bracelet arrived on time.  The young lady's Quinceanera is not for another week, so I hope she will enjoy it."
4.0,"The dress came baggy which is what you want. You will have enough cloth the customize to your liking. As previous reviews stated you must tie the knot yourself and create the off shoulder look on your own. Certain angles the dress looks AMAZING, other angles not so much. I definitely have a few photos where it looks as though I have a pooch lol. The way you pose can make or break the effect of the dress. Obviously the models on here poses perfect so in live view you may be disappointed until you strike a pose.<br /><br />I wore this dress (still wearing actually) to the Black Vegan Festival in Brooklyn today. The material is comfy. I’m 5’5” and it reaches my knees before I tie it. I’m 160 pounds. 38-27-41 and it’s baggy but that’s what I want.<br /><br /> Put the knot to the side or prepare to show undies. The lower the knot the less curvy effect it has. Place loose knots at first to get the position right. That way you won’t have to worry about unnecessary wrinkles.<br /><br />Here are a few pics... cute angle and not so flattering angle. Worth the price and quick shipping to me. I had nothing to wear and this was my back up."
4.0,Right size good basic back to school shoe.
4.0,i was amazed how beautiful the necklaces look. such an elegant unique peice of jewlery but i rated this 4 stars due to the fact that i ordered six then to find out one rhinestone or topaz was missing from my mom in laws necklace. i do wish also that the turquiose was in the right place as well. u get what u pay for but overall the necklace is perfect for my outfits
4.0,"In the picture of each vest, it shows the color sherpa on thr outside with a second layer on thr inside.  There is only one layer and not what is posted!!  Very misleading if looking for a double warmth hooded vest."
4.0,I liked all of the designs.  I really bought it for the lightning bolt but the post is to thick to put in you ear so I can not use it.  There are two of the designs that the posts are to thick to put in your ear.  The rest of the earrings are really nice.  I like them a lot.  Overall a good deal.
4.0,It was high quality and when I gave it to my fiance as a gift she was really pleased.<br />I felt like I bought it at an expensive shop.
4.0,"Should have ordered my normal size (medium), but I can make the small do.  NOTE:  the waist line (where the skirt is attached to the bodice, is more like empire rather than as pictured.  Be sure to take that into account when ordering (unless you are flat chested, maybe)."
4.0,I bought these four my four year old granddaughter. She loves them. Seem to be well enough made.<br />Update 3-20-2018: These have held up well and my granddaughter still wears them though she will soon outgrow them.
4.0,"I ordered 1 size up(L) and it fits just like shown on model.  The material is lightweight, slightly stretchy but it does not breathe well.  Will definitely not wear is outside in summer heat .  Overall, nice top."
4.0,This was a great way for my 1st grader to go back to school.  His little smile could be seen.  All teacher should be required to wear these.
4.0,it was little smaller than i thought so i gave it to someone
4.0,"Initially very pretty, perfect coloring. Slight tingle on skin from metal, metal turned color quickly. Stopped wearing it."
4.0,"Love the shirt, but it does run just a bit small.  Not to worry, because I'm wearing it today!"
4.0,"I love the purse, high quality and beautiful. It is stiff, and doesn't give much to get my wallet in. Everything fits, but not easy as easy to get into. I still love it, and would recommend."
4.0,"Aside from the mask it was a great costume. The mask was out of shape and would not relax.. even if not I'm not sure how well it would have worked. We did use the costume, but got a different mask for it."
4.0,Nice fit and the quality was acceptable.
4.0,"I like the size, super practical for kids faces. However the clear part for eyes bends easy!!"
4.0,Love the organization it provided and fit well in my carry on size luggage.
4.0,Bought it as a gift!  I was satisfied!
4.0,These comfortable socks are lightweight yet warm with a cushioned feel. They fit well with any type of footwear. They slide easily over another pair of socks. They cling comfortably to the calf.
4.0,The color of these earrings is bright and very pink - I love that about the earrings. The sterling silver does color so you need to work at keep that part clean - this is the only draw back.
4.0,I thought they were the same as the picture.  They were grey with a stripe on the but.  Very thin and nice.  And quick delivery.
4.0,"Not the best quality, but still great for the price. My son loves the skull and crossbones tie. Keeps him from complaining when he has to wear a tie. Would buy again."
4.0,Leather is much stiffer than I expected. Maybe it will break in and get softer. Pockets have lots of room. Top carry loop is much larger than it needs to be.
4.0,"A little long to wear with jeans, cute with leggings"
4.0,"I opened the box and was immediately reminded of bags that I had purchased long ago in Florence, Italy. Rich color and pleasant nostalgic leather smell. Nicely-stitched, with old-fashioned metal zippers. The only disappointment is that the interior is made of a thin polyester, which likely won't last as long as the exterior. One of the pockets also has a second interior small zipped pocket, and there is a third smaller compartment on the outside as well. If you don't need to use both larger compartments, you can just use one, which will allow for larger items such as an electric razor, etc. Wide enough for toothbrushes. The strap handle pulls through a loop so the bag can be held vertically or horizontally."
4.0,"Purchased Medium based off the reviews, I’m in process of weight loss and this is fitting just right  on the high rise of the short and being able to tuck the shirt in.  Color not really rich rust like color more a mustard brown on the stripe. Washed in cold water with Persia detergent, no shrinkage with air dry.  If you like baggy fit go up, if not stick to reviews ."
4.0,A little heavy but very pretty
4.0,Really stylish dress for the money. Glad I bought the XL because it's a product from China that runs small. Came packaged in a dark manilla type envelope that was closed with a snap. Pretty mod. Taking to Europe and the material is light and won't wrinkle. Great purchase.
4.0,A little small for a 2T size
4.0,Great tights for the price. I will be buying again.
4.0,A little hard to connect. Wish it was a firm or tighter clip.
4.0,Just a little smaller than expected.
4.0,Got these in pink for my daughter to wear to the pool. These look just like crocs except the logo and toddlers don’t care about the logo. She says they feel comfortable.  She usually grows out of her crocs before they even start to show any wear. We will see how they hold up!
4.0,"I have bought from this company before. I do like the style but sizing is inconsistent. This one was too tight. I did fix it myself, it wasn’t hard. The quality is good and fabric is pretty, it washes well too"
4.0,I’m a medium in all of my Amazon leggings but these felt very small on me. They are beautiful leggings so I may just exchange the size.
4.0,I thought it was a cute shirt but it was  very sheer. I wore a tank underneath it and it was fine.
4.0,"I ordered this necklace to commemorate my mom.  It is a beautiful piece, it has the 925 Silver stamp on the charm itself and the silver and rose gold together looks lovely.  It comes on a thin silver chain that has a little sparkle.  The box it comes in is very nice and it also includes a cleaning cloth that you can use to shine it up when needed.<br /><br />The only thing to be aware of is that I ordered the Butterfly option and received the Flower option.  If you look, the picture under the butterfly option shows the flower necklace and vice versa.  I called customer service and they said that they would try to have this fixed and in the meantime I exchanged it for another one and included a message stating that I ordered the butterfly.<br /><br />They got another one out very quickly for me and upon receipt, it was the flower one a second time.  It really is a beautiful necklace and I think either option is great.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the mix-up otherwise this is a 5 star purchase."
4.0,Very pretty and get lots of compliments. However the pattern is starting to rub off where the bands overlap but I wear it everyday around chemicals (lab work) so<br />that may be why. Still great for the reasonable price.
4.0,"These are no show socks, so I know they are small, but they are a little on the tight side as far as length goes. I wear a US women's size 9, and I find they pull on my toes. However, the material is soft, and there is a grippy strip on the inside of the heel so they don't slip off."
4.0,Cute! Wish they'd have been a bit larger to really see the writing without having to be so close!
4.0,"The tags are nice and bright, but they pop off if they’re hit hard (like luggage being tossed into cars/shuttles), so we used metal ring clasps and had no more issues."
4.0,"I ordered this dress for a wedding. It is very beautiful. The blue flowers give it a really pretty yet classy look.<br /><br />Unfortunately the fit was a little off. I wear a size 16 in dresses, I don't know my measurements but I can say I wear a size 40D so I ordered an XXL. The Torso and down fit perfectly. It looks really great. Not to tight or loose. However the bust is very loose.  Also the straps of course are very loose. If I return the dress for a smaller size. I am afraid then the torso section would be to tight but the bust fit. But I like the dress so much I don't want to return it. So I am just going to take it to a seamstress to get fixed."
4.0,"I bought them according to the measurements on the ad. (I measured my leg at its most swollen) But when I opened the package and pulled at the fabric, I thought for sure there was no way they would stretch to fit my calf. But it did! Looks are deceiving, so if you don't think it will work, make sure you try it first. They are very soft and comfortable too. Not sure how hot they will be once the temps go up, but we'll see. I've had so much trouble finding ones to fit my calves, and was so happy to have found these."
4.0,I have larger boobs and the swimsuit top did not fit super well because of the padding. That resulted in a lot of 'overflow' so I don't really wear it. But I love the bottoms. I have had them for a few months now and the fabric seems to be a bit stretched out. Though I'm not shocked since they were rather cheap. I think they are a good item for the cost. Since I now know I like this style I would probably spend more money on the same thing of better quality.<br /><br />**I hope you enjoy my reviews as much as I enjoy trying new products. This is my honest review and I did NOT receive any discount or compensation for this review. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!**
4.0,"This bathing suit is super cute on, the fit is a little large so I'm not sure if I would go a full size down. The material appears to be of good quality. This is very flattering with the fabric gatherings in all of the right areas. The shipping took awhile to reach me but the pricing isn't bad to have to wait a little longer.<br /><br />I would recommend this product. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Very clear lenses, crisp polarization. Frames are very light weight, but expected with the price only $14. After wearing outside in bright sun I realize that I'm squinting a bit. I wish the lenses were a tad darker. But I love the shape and they sit on the bridge of my nose well without resting on my cheeks."
4.0,There's not a lot of stretch in it.
4.0,I get compliments everywhere I go!!! They fit great and feel so roomy in any kind of weather.  Run don't walk to order these artsy overalls.
4.0,"The ""Mens Hippie Sleeveless T Shirt Cotton Beach Lace Up V Neck Tank Tops Summer Casual Yoga Tee Tops"" is a lightweight and comfortable shirt with a bit of a beach bum vibe. Go ahead and show off those arms!  Fits well and seems well constructed."
4.0,Nice pants however waist is tight and legs are looser than I was expecting- kind of like men's carpenters pants really nice fabric I just prefer tighter legs when on the trail.
4.0,"Really nice dress for the price! Great, almost heavy material so it does not feel cheap. It would be perfect for an outdoor/fall/winter wedding with the sleeves. Earrings were a nice addition but not a great quality at all - dress was good enough. I am 5'10 and the length is perfect."
4.0,LOVE THESE OMG but if you are over 5’9 like me they will be cropped
4.0,Bought for SEC college football games. Won’t really fit an iPhone 7 Plus with case on. So I managed to just take my case off and use it.
4.0,good on bike
4.0,I like the product.  I am 5&#34;2&#34; and 125 lbs with 34D and 35 butt size.  I ordered the Medium and It is a big too big but otherwise it is a nice material and fits and flows as I expected from the pictures.
4.0,"I actually think this sweater runs small for unisex sizing. I typically wear a small in men’s sweaters like this but found the elastic band at the bottom ran much tighter than any sweatshirt I own along with the neck. I would prob return for a medium if it didn’t take a week to get here. For size reference -  I’m 5’7, 34DD, 148lbs."
4.0,"This is a really nice shirt but runs on the smaller side.  I am 5'7"", 138 lbs, bust 36D.  I ordered a M and the sizing was like a fitted shirt.  Order up if you want a looser fit."
4.0,Do not like the bottle opener on the sole of the sandal.  Very health hazardous.
4.0,Seems to be well made.  The extra material around the ear isn't quite as thick as I'd hoped.  The quality for the price is good.  Will see how it holds up over the course of the full season!
4.0,loved the tight feel of these...and material allows a smooth look for long tonic or shirt dress...I am 5'11 I am 200lbs I wear a 14 misses......they aren't as long on me as in pic of model....but not to short that it looks odd....if its cool out I may use one pair for running and another pair to dress up or down ....
4.0,"Good quality, Definitely will wear it to the gym! I Purchased the sports braw too so I can wear them  together.😄"
4.0,"It's adorable! Perfect for a little one. Pink, pretty, delicate. Will make a nice gift."
4.0,It's elsa so of course my little girl loved it. Works as it's intended is easy to link to your Disney experience account. BUT you can buy it for much cheaper in the parks. It was half the price I paid for it in the parks. So save your money and wait til you get there to purchase. The person who rings you up can link it to your account instantly for you. Much easier.
4.0,It is pretty!
4.0,I love the way the sweater was made. I had to send it back because it runs small. I am a true size small but this sweater was too small
4.0,I love this coat but unfortunately I brought it one size tops big thinking that if I wear sweaters it would fit nicely. I am normally a medium and I’m 5 foot 2in but I brought a large. I still think this coat is beautiful and comfortable.
4.0,"My granddaughter is small toddler almost 2 yr old, was a preemie, so they run a tad large for her."
4.0,Great fabric material. A nice throw and go that’s fashionable. The legs could be a bit longer although my child is tall. Lol
4.0,"Really good product, I fear that in time the straps may crack but they seem to be really good as of now."
4.0,The set is very cute for the price!
4.0,"Good, comfortable shoes. My only issue is that there is sort of “waves” or creases in the leather. So it looks somewhat cheap."
4.0,"Fun,great mask"
4.0,"I bought this because my feets flat as a table. I get real bad shin splints when I run, this gives a very good arch support and it is not as cushiony as dr scholls, infact its hard as a rock. but my feet didnt hurt after a day out walking and a mile run and that's why i got this. It works and good value as well."
4.0,I Love It even though it runs around 2 sizes smaller than stated. Very Pretty and I am sure Comfortable Once I Get The Correct Size.
4.0,The gloves are good and work as expected. They keep my hands just warm enough. I am using them for work where and need to have good feel when holding smaller parts. The only thing for me that makes them not great is they are a little short at the wrist.
4.0,Very well made and stands out.
4.0,Order ur legit size. I did one bigger and wish I didnt... Dont know if ill even wear it its much bigger then expected
4.0,"It's a good shirt - lightweight, which is what I wanted."
4.0,It turned my wrist green however I love the fit and look very comfortable
4.0,"Love it, but sleeves are a little long for me. I got the medium and I'm 5'2&#34; @ 140 lbs."
4.0,I love this dress but it is a little too short for my liking. I love the burgundy color and the fit. I’m only 5’4 so if it’s short on me it will be very short on you if you are taller!
4.0,Cute tank top and washes well! If you're on the fence about what size to buy I would suggest you go with the smaller size. I went with my normal size and had to modify it a little so it would fit properly...wish I would have bought a size smaller.
4.0,"Has a pretty thick waistband.  It has some compression which is good. The thick waistband means you will have to use it with pants that have room around the waist.  Works well for stomach compression needed to take pressure off lower back when working out, but the thick waistband gets pretty hot.  I like everything except the extra thick waistband."
4.0,Super Cute!  Minnie’s nose arrived broken off. I just drew her nose back on and it worked.
4.0,"Very good pack for the cost. The handle at the top broke off very quickly, but I also had probably 30 pounds worth of gear shoved into it. Just don't pick it up by the handle if it's overpacked and you should be fine."
4.0,Not much support buy looks cute under loose tanks.
4.0,My 10 year old daughter loves them. Quality is what you would expect. Great for girls or young teens.<br />I will update later on durability.
4.0,"My son loves the outfit, but I just wish their was more detail in the shorts and they didn't just look like fabric that just was sewn together . Definitely something he can wear next summer as well ."
4.0,"Highly visible yellow tag... but the white strips where you write the address information is a little small and once written, it is permanent so...once you wrote down something on them, it can no longer be changed...  It would be better if it uses an inserted pocket so the address information can be swabbed out as needed."
4.0,"I really did not like these boots at all when I first opened the box, and what made it worse is I was sent the wrong ones--the ones I didn't pick; I ordered 034 and received 189. I thought the uplifted toe on the 189 style was ridiculous looking and even more so 'in person.' I stuck them in my closet and thought, I'll try them again tomorrow.<br /><br />So today I grabbed them by the toe and the heel and kind of crunched them backwards, and guess what? It worked! The toe doesn't look like an elf shoe any more.<br /><br /> I walked around in them and began to like them more. The top doesn't come up very far, just below my calf, and that's what I expected from the pic.<br /><br />They do fit a little large on me--I wear a 7 (I can sometimes wear a 6.5 so I guess I'm between sizes), but these are a little big; however, with socks they do fine and don't slip on my feet.<br /><br />I put some new gel insoles inside them and boy did that make them cushiony and the fit was better. It's not that they are uncomfortable; there is a soft inner sole, but the gel insoles helped with fit and comfort even more.<br /><br />They feel pretty good on. And they are fun.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about the design on them - I wish it were darker instead of white; however, I can always darken the design if I decide I don't like it after giving it some time. It's growing on me!<br /><br />These are super cheap (at least at time of this review) so for an 'on a whim' order to wear for fun, I'm surprisingly happy I ordered them. Don't expect super quality at this price, but do expect to receive a bit more than what you paid for (at this price now).<br /><br />They come packed very well and securely, though not in a box; however, they are stuffed to keep their shape and put inside soft bags to keep them from being scuffed."
4.0,don't know yet this is a Christmas present
4.0,"Hi I'm really in love with this bow ties (I bought three), I really love them. They were expected to be delivered by March 19th, but I got them February 24th. I'd give five stars However, I ordered this on February 4th and I had to wait 3 weeks to get the package. I'd like buying more bow ties from this seller but I wish the deliver was faster, nevertheless I really reccomend theese bow ties."
4.0,Cute but the skirt is a lil shorter than pic. Orders XL I'm 240 5'9
4.0,This dress is comfortable and perfect for Autumn layers where temps are mild. It does run big. I am about an 8 normally so I got a medium and it fits well overall. The neckline is a bit wide so my bra strap creeps out sometimes.
4.0,They run a little big so I’d say don’t size up.
4.0,"These are so warm. They are almost like shoes so make sure you have socks on your feet. There are only two downsides: 1. the laces do not stay laced. I fixed this by applying a dab of Elmers Glue at the knot and they have stayed fixed for over a year. 2. If you do not wear sock, the &#34;fur&#34; lining will come off and stick to your toes if your feet sweat a bit. Outside of those two things, these are great house slippers."
4.0,"I have bought a Floerns dress before and I really liked it so I decided to get a different style this time. I really like it. Fits very nice. I wish it was a little longer in length, I had got it because it said it was the same length as the last one I got but this seems a little shorter. I wore it to a casual wedding and received lots of compliments."
4.0,"They're for my son who wears AFOs to bed each night.  They were a little tight, but fortunately he has small calves.  If it was a normal 10 y.o. boy, these would likely be very tight.<br /><br />But the length was good for him.<br /><br />This is our fourth pair.  When he first got the AFOs, regular socks bothered him.  These fixed the problem."
4.0,These are a little small than what I usually use but good material.
4.0,Easy for child to put on.
4.0,I ordered a medium and it fits nicely. Not baggy but not skin tight. I’m glad I ordered a medium because the small would’ve been uncomfortable. It’s not that soft. The outside of the sweater is softer than the inside. After some time it itches. But the print is beautiful and unique.
4.0,Works looks real but hurts after a bit. I hope they will make more sizes like 8mm ring
4.0,I bought this for a trip to the mainland from Hawaii at Christmas time.  It definitely kept me warm. Would give 5 stars if it had a detachable hood.
4.0,It is a good looking scarf holder and I like it.
4.0,"Way too big for my toddler, have to return but the quality is good and love the warm cozy feel of the hat. I really wish it fit her."
4.0,Not sure of any medical benefits actually received from these for my veins etc.  But they sure do feel great on my legs.  Have hand washed them many times and they are seeming to hold up well.
4.0,I ordered two dresses different colors but same size. Huge difference in length between them. I am petite (5’1”) and ordered a small in both. One I can wear flats with and the other I will have to wear wedges with. Still a cute dress and a steal for the price.
4.0,"I am satisfied with the product. I usually wear a Medium shirt, but will purchase a Small if I am planning to use it as a base layer. The the sizing on the Augusta Sportswear Training Tanks & Wicking T-Shirts run small and the material doesn't stretch very much. I had to exchange my entire order of Smalls for Mediums because of this and I would order Larges to wear as a normal outer layer. Be mindful of the smaller & tighter than normal sizing if you prefer a more loose fit. Other than that the product performs well as a base layer & a workout top."
4.0,"They're cheap and seem to be of good quality.<br />I bought the green pair first, and they're not bad, so I<br />bought the Gold one that looks green in the picture,<br />and actually is some shade of greenish.<br />And I bought the Red one that looks yellow in the pic,<br />and actually is a faded light orange color.<br />Most of my many clip-ons are not rimmed.<br />The silver rim makes these seem more substantial,<br />and the clear clip and spring seem substantial as well.<br />For the price, I may buy the Blue, Silver and Sky Blue, too."
4.0,"These are unique shaped underwear, but they do their job. My guy’s shirt stayed put when he tried these.  He said they do have a jock strap feel, but they do what they are advertised to do."
4.0,Love the fit and color. Would order these again.
4.0,"Theses are a great alternative yo the expensive name brand. The sock material may not be as good as the name brand (just a guess), but little ones will only be wearing them a few months and they definitely last longer than a few months. They are harder for my little one to pull off because of the sock-like fit. Also, great got those with hardwood floors. I ended up ordering 6 more pairs in various sizes and all are holding up well. Great for pre and early walkers. Definitely recommend."
4.0,"Lovely watch, but had to add another hole to band because have a very small wrist."
4.0,Have not used it yet but the color is a burgundy shade not purple....love it ...it is the color of the season.  It has tons of zipper compartments and a place for everything.  The faux leather unfortunately looks faux .  It still is a great bag.
4.0,"I recently realized the importance of sleeping in 100%cotton, and the comfort it provides. So I got the tartan plaid, even though I wanted the red  plaid. The tartan was cheapest, and if I liked it I would buy the red next.<br /><br />Ok the robe does run large. I am a solid 1x or occasionally 2X, and the Xl size in this robe fits comfortably. The fabric is so soft, beautiful traditional colors, and light to medium weight flannel. The sleeves and collar are kinda more than needed, but I could care less.<br />I have not washed or dried, but I will be carefully as I have not room to shrink.<br /><br />So my cost came out to right at 20$, and I would say the robe is about worth 35$- simply due to the fact that most store don't sell 100% cotton robes. The major departments are mostly selling fleece or poly blend."
4.0,"Bought this as a short term solution until I can have the one that I designed 3D printed so that I can assemble it.  The winder works well, however, the foam holder for the watch does not rest snuggly in the housing and my watch fell and made contact with the plastic front cover (thankfully scratching the plastic and not the face of my watch).  I was able to fix this by using the provided micro cloth as a shin on the back of the watch to create more pressure on the foam to allow it to distort more and fit more snuggly."
4.0,I like it. It fits good in my front pocket which is why I bought it. Makes carrying my cards and license easier than in my money clip.
4.0,"It's comfortable and keeps me cool while hiking. I've only used it during California winter season, so I still have yet to use it in the hot summer. I think the dark color will make me feel hot, not the fabric. It's long enough to keep dust and small rocks from my socks & shoes. I also like how it fits like yoga pants in the hip area."
4.0,"The cap is cute and relatively comfortable. There is a peice in back attached to to stretchy part meant for tightening. If you try to tighten it at all the bouffant slides up your forehead. You can prevent that by putting the bouffant behind your ears. I can't do that due to my glasses having ear hooks. For most this isn't an issue though, so I'm still giving it four stars."
4.0,"Very nice charm.  Pretty much what I expected and unlike other posts, the charm definitely is made by Pandora."
4.0,It is great for keeping your things dry but it was larger than expected. And it floats
4.0,Fit was okay but quality was not great
4.0,I ordered 2x for more of an oversized look. It was wide with shorter than expected sleeves. I still get lots of compliments on it tho
4.0,"Collects cat and dog hair very easy, almost impossible to get off"
4.0,Beautiful color but runs on the smaller side and the legs pretty short.
4.0,I LOVED the way this dress fit. The color was a little more Halloween orange than burnt orange but other than that it was perfect for my engagement photos.
4.0,Its cute face is huge had to get links taken out but overall its a cute wstvh great color like geneva watvhes
4.0,"This item took its time to arrive, coming all the way from Thailand to the US. I expected it to be thicker, it is actually pretty light."
4.0,"I got two of these dresses, and although I like them I have to return them both.  I gave a high rating because these dresses are beautiful, and very well made.  Unfortunately, the top portion of the dress is just too small. It fits tight across the chest in a way that flattens the breast area.  The bottom part fits well, but the top makes it look like I'm wearing something that is too small for me.  I ordered size small in the leopard print and black polka dot.  I'm afraid that if I size up, the dresses will fit better up top, but then might be too big and billowy from the waist down.  Except for the top part, everything else about these dresses fit me perfectly!  I even thought about just cutting off the top half, and adding some elastic to the waist to turn them into maxi skirts.  I think that if there was a bit more spandex, the dress would have more give to it and might fit better on top.  They do have some spandex added, but not enough.  Which means if you tug on the material, you will feel just a very, very slight amount of give.  About the same about of give if spandex were added to a silk fabric.  You would more feel the tautness of the silk, rather than the stretch of the spandex.  The style is flattering because it gives the dress more of a feminine shape, and a less boxy look.  Be aware that these dresses have a seam down the back and the FRONT.  If your order a print or floral design, just be mindful that the design on the front of the dress might not line up with the front seam.  The seam on my black polka dot was nicely done, but this may not be the case with other designs.  My suggestion to the maker would be to make the top portion larger or add more stretch so that there is more give and less tightness and flattening in the chest area.  I still might swap the small out for a medium and see how that works.  If I do, I will give an update."
4.0,Just for hang out purposes.but i really like it.
4.0,"This shirt looks just like the picture.  It is a nice material and feels good on.  However, you really have to make sure you look at the measurements given.  You cannot go by size.  I looked at my measurements and saw that an XXL would fit (I usually get an XL because I have broad shoulders and long arms).  The XXL is somewhat small.  I can wear it, but it fits very closely.  I really needed the XXXL.  You may need to go up two sizes.  I'm not a fan of this cut."
4.0,The shirt wasn't true to size runs small so beware..but all was not lost it fit my teen daughter perfectly
4.0,It's cute. It would've been better if they sewed the top a little tighter and let it flow out.
4.0,Material is soft and comfy. Fit wise normally wear XL ordered regular size. Little snug in arms but not tight. Next time I will size up. Will definitely buy again.
4.0,"Good quality, print is nice and vibrant. But the fit is a little baggy, not to my liking,but I'm keeping it anyway. If you prefer a women's shirt that has a fitted or slightly fitted look, then this is not the shirt for you."
4.0,"Lights are not quite bright enough for long term reading ( like on a flight), but is good enough to read a menu in a restaurant."
4.0,Better than the last one I bought from another seller! Fits good and looks good Thank You
4.0,Beautiful and adorable on my 9 year old anime fan. I wish the ears snapped on rather than bobby pins because she has massively curly hair and its hard to put them in but otherwise they set is perfect.
4.0,Absolutely love this jacket!
4.0,"This capri is the best i've ever had, they're so resistant, and don't show off through out."
4.0,Needed a light weight robe for travel. The length is perfect as I am 5'3&#34; inches. Very comfortable!
4.0,Liked.  Yoga practice
4.0,"Overall it looks great, great price and fast shipping."
4.0,Loved this for my wedding updo
4.0,"Shrinky like a violet, these socks diminished instantly when washed and dried.<br /><br />Still, they stretch pretty well, which makes the shrink not so bad."
4.0,nice bag but i have to wash it has weird smell.
4.0,"This suit is well a made lighter material w/ double stitching and better heavy duty zipper. Easier to put on and take off after a workout.<br />My only problem with this item is that the sizing runs on the really small size. I am and x-large, the site states that I needed as 4x-xlge. I ordered as stated, then when it arrived it was too tight. I returned and re-ordered the 5x-xlge. Just make sure to order one size larger than recommended."
4.0,It did look a little different than I expected from the picture but I still loved the way it laid. Fit was still good. Now I'll get more colors.
4.0,Glasses is made of good quality material. Design looks good and perfect. I would recommend this glasses for all. Price is also reasonable. Over all this is a nice and my wife is happy to wear this one
4.0,The &#34;metallic&#34; ring lost its coating within 3 days of just normal wear.  Other than that they have been great.
4.0,"I love the color, the flexibility of the fabric and the versatility of the fashion it offers to my wardrobe."
4.0,Material is just a little thin but I think these pants are incredible for the price. Just the right amount of mesh/sheer and sits comfortably on the waist.
4.0,"My daughter loves these shoes. they are as comfortable for her as her tennis shoes, but she feels like a ballerina in them (she says),... I only gave them 4 stars simply because they are only 2.5 months old, and the toes are already pealing, but in their defense, she is 5 and plays on the playground and I am sure that plays a huge factor into their current condition. she loves them, and I will probably buy another pair when these start looking too rag-it ."
4.0,"This is very pretty, and inventive. I'm quite happy with it."
4.0,Its what you pay for: cheap looking and pretty lightweight. Its pretty strong though wont break if you pull on it.
4.0,"These are good looking pair of basic gloves, they are a little longer.  I've washed them a few times with minimum shrinkage, very little fading and they held up nicely."
4.0,The pink is a little lighter than the pictures show
4.0,"I love all the features of this watch for all the same reasons as other reviewers.  The modes are great.  I love the automatic light on as you raise your wrist in darker conditions.  I like the flexibility of the time display.  I only want my watches from now on to have solar and atomic radio capability-- it makes this an easy watch to wear.  It truly is the ultimate nerd timepiece.  My wife thinks it look horrendous, but I wear it to work regularly because I love it.<br /><br />The only weakness in my mind is that the stainless steel ring rotates a little too easily for my taste.  I will often reset it to N and then a couple of hours later, just going through regular day in the life motions, it winds up twisted around.  Also, some of the black printing is coming out of the inlay (in the picture you can see it on the S and NE directions).  It can be a touch difficult to read in the wrong lighting conditions and at an angle which is a little tough when I need to surreptitiously check the time.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy this again.  It checks all the boxes I want in a watch with very little downside."
4.0,Love these glasses tytytyty
4.0,Nice shirt but was afraid of returning it...coofandy COTTON items tend to run LARGE compared to Polly or slim items...so I ordered down...CURSES...I should’ve ordered my size and let it shrink...😞...would’ve fit perfectly...had to return anyway🤪
4.0,I bought this for my niece who is five and enters horse shows. She loves this necklace and can wear it for good luck.
4.0,I gave it a 4 because i really like the coat. It isn't the greatest quality. the hook and eye closure is difficult to secure. you have to squeeze the hook together to keep it fastened. I would really like to return it but this is the fifth leopard coat i ordered. the size i ordered was not the size i received. they automatically sent two sizes up.?
4.0,"My daughter is very big for her age (8) so I did have to go up a size. Fits well with some room for growth without being baggy. This has modest coverage in the rear which is what I was looking for. Very soft, stretchy, and breathable. She likes it. The only thing is is looks slightly faded after washing in warm, maybe cold would have been better. Maintains shape well."
4.0,"It's a really nice fabric. I haven't had a chance to wear it yet but I think it is going to be nice to have a large, warm scarf. It's really big, like the picture. I even actually used it as a blanket the other night."
4.0,Gran correa.
4.0,I truly love this bracelet .. i gave it 4 stars because the bracelet is really tight on my wrist . Time will tell if i can continue wearing it
4.0,"Great winter/snow boot and good price ! I bought some for my little girl and my son, different colors and styles of course but both great! Got them the same day I ordered. The ones with Fur inside are deff my favorite!"
4.0,Dont look or feel cheap really nice
4.0,Light weight and inexpensive. Perfect price for all my sunglasses for travel. 👍👍
4.0,"Fits well, looks nice but the fabric is not thick enough"
4.0,"cute top. the pic shows it oversized.  but it fit a lot tighter and shorter. it doesn't look bad, but not like pic"
4.0,Very cute. Got a lot of compliments on them. I’m a 7 1/2 and that’s the size I got but they feel more like a 7. Still wearable though
4.0,It was a gift the person love it
4.0,"The tiara is an awesome replica. It’s quite sturdy (but still bendable to some extent). The head strap is nice and the box is a great addition. It fits on my head quite nicely. My only complaint is there’s some paint scuffs here and there and a few parts of the tiara got bent. I was able to bend them back. Just a bit bummed that the paint and matte finish got rubbed off somehow. Considering there’s not much Marvel official replicas on the market, this one is great but for a $80, I would hope it was packaged a bit better and more securely and the product doesn’t get damaged like this one did. Regardless, happy but bummed out."
4.0,I love this ear cuff. Wish it fit my ear though. No problems with it other than that. Love it.
4.0,My four years old daughter loves them!!
4.0,"These fit great and have pretty good support. I'm a 36DDD and got the XL. They're perfect. I'm pregnant and these feel like they'll accomidate me through out my pregnancy. My only dislike is that the overall fabric is see through, showing the removable padding. It's not a big deal for me since I don't plan on wearing these on their own but if you want something to wear solo, these aren't for you."
4.0,"My son is almost 5 and loves all of the mustache items, so he really wanted this set.<br />The clothes look just like the picture and are adorable! They are also super soft and very comfortable (he keeps asking to wear them again). However, the ""big boy"" set is just two pieces instead of three; you don't get the hat. Also, the pants fit him fine but the shirt was small on him. So, he'll be able to wear the pants for a while but the shirt is too small after the first wash. It is a really cute outfit, just pay attention when ordering and you may want to order up a size."
4.0,"I did give only 4 stars because the cutoff on the back it is not wide enough to plug the charger.  I did cut around it (easy task) and work perfectly, other wise it is beautiful and colors are bright.  YES I would recommend this product"
4.0,Nicer than I expected and drapes just right. I like the pockets. Good length. Easy to launder.
4.0,I'm a 32dd/ddd. I ordered 34e after reading reviews. Fits well
4.0,They are the right size but they still come out when sleeping so be careful.
4.0,"I just bought this pajama set for an upcoming trip to China but after reading all the reviews about how small these run I was really worried about how it would fit. I'm 5'5"" 185lb and wear a 40C, 12/L top, 14/XL pants. After taking my measurements and consulting the size chart I ordered a US XL/ 3XL and was really relieved that it fits!! It's not at all like the child sizes some reviewers mention. I'd say it fits somewhere between an adult L and XL (like a big large or small Xlarge). The top fits perfectly with plenty of coverage (although I wish it had a bit more support in the cups) and the pants are just a little tight in the belly/bum (where I carry more weight) but are still comfortable. The pants definitely look small right out of the package but have a lot of stretch in the elastic waist so they fit fine. The material is very light, silky, and comfortable and I really like the print. The eye mask also seems really comfortable (and I don't generally like anything on my face) and I think it will come in very handy for my 14+ hour flights!<br />There are 2 reasons I decided to drop to 4 stars. First, the loops for the belt on the robe are REALLY high - a good 5 inches above my waist! - and so it ties right across my chest. It's a bit annoying but something I can deal with because I like the set as a whole. I may just cut off the loops and sew the belt to the robe in the back. Second, though, is that the color doesn't really match the pictures. It's called ""camel"" which suggests beige, but online it looks more like a pale silvery pink/beige with grey print - very pretty. In person it's more of a yellow/gold beige with dark brown print. It's still nice (and thankfully works with my skin tone) but isn't as pretty or feminine as it looks online. Overall, though, I really like the set and look forward to enjoying it during my travels! And if any of the other colors - especially the dark blue - ever come back in stock in my size, I'll buy more!"
4.0,Lasted through out the day. Fit very comfortably. Did not slide around and was not to constricting. Feet never got sweaty or uncomfortable. The color however is very vibrant and will show through breathable shoes.
4.0,"The flare on these allows them to easily fall out, but most of these kind do. Otherwise they are beautiful and a great price."
4.0,"They don’t flip up, attatch discreetly."
4.0,This is great for under a dress and fits well but it is a hoop skirt and not advertised as such.
4.0,"I really like it! It is a little big, but that is my fault. I ordered a medium, and depending on the product, I am usually small or medium. When in doubt, I go for the bigger size. I am really glad it's not too small though! It drapes nicely, and most of the complaints found in reviews have been fixed, i.e. The button holes being too small for the buttons. It seems like a very warm coat, and I can't wait for the cold weather so that I can wear it!"
4.0,"The dress is cute, fits perfectly and I love how it flows.<br />A perfect perfect dual with dual usage : evening dress or day dress.<br />The only thing is that the dress could be a little longer."
4.0,"This was for my daughter - hate blue, but she likes it!  It's a color thing with me - the piece itself would be a 5....if it wasn't a blue stone!  : )"
4.0,"Wife loves the look...  The material could be better, but overall good."
4.0,Fit great. Love dearfoams.
4.0,I ordered this dress last weekend and was received yesterday It's look very nice and comply!!!!! Love it!
4.0,Very cute dress. Very comfortable. Just runs a little big.
4.0,"Nice workman ship except the internal center zip pocket is flimsy and falls over, also the 2 straps that snap together get in the way off removing items from the handbag, may consider cutting them off."
4.0,looked good and fit well
4.0,I had to get the medium because I’m a 32D but it was too big around so if you’re like a 34 D it’ll be perfect
4.0,It is a really nice top !<br />You can see through it a little but if you're wearing a sportsbra or a top underneath it's totally fine (:
4.0,"I was so wanting this to be nice, but when I got it was broken, and that was such a bummer. Would of given a One Star, but have to say the company Qiyun was wonderful, and gave me a full refund. This shows honor and commiment to their customers, and for that reason I will purchase more of what they offer, as they can be trusted. Oops happens, and this was just something that got past the handling team."
4.0,One of the straps will slip down sometimes but otherwise its comfortable.
4.0,"My husband and I got this for our moms as Mother's Day presents as we were days away from birthing their grandson. They both love it! My mom hasn't taken hers off at all. I was nervous that it would 'turn' because of the price but she's done laundry (by hand), cleaned and done several activities using bleach and to my delight, it hasn't turned black or discolored in any way. After being nervous about this but, I am happy with it. Our moms are happy with it."
4.0,"I am in love with this beauty!! Such an exquisite print. The only thing is...my boobs don’t fit...neither does my rather generous derrière! It was a long shot trying for a short dress, but it was worth trying on. This dress won’t work for my body, but I’m obsessed with the print and will be cruising the Internet hunting for more styles with it!"
4.0,Beautiful color and style.
4.0,Love them stylish and cute!
4.0,Love them!!! Perfect fit. True to size.
4.0,"Nice bands, durable and comfortable. However the pink one faded in a few months and became nude."
4.0,"The pendent is perfect but the chain isn't. It's color was fading, some spots were black."
4.0,Love these tees. A little snug in the upper arm/chest area but stretchy enough to work with.
4.0,"Two years ago, I got the 28 Palms Women's Tropical Hawaiian Print Off Shoulder Maxi Dress and adored it - until it faded into unwearability in a few washes. I was a bit nervous about trying another dress - and there is still a chance that this dress could disappoint me.<br /><br />This is a stunning, fun print - more than one person has complimented me on it! I really like the halter neck-line - it works great to wear this with a pretty bralette. The large fit well on me - I think I might have wanted the waist to either be a bit lower or a bit higher, to be either at my natural waist or under my bustline, but it's not horrible.<br /><br />My biggest problem is trying to fasten the button at the neck - I've had to ask my sibling to get this each time. Definitely not very easy for someone who lives alone!<br /><br />We shall see how this fares in the wash, but for now, it's been a fun print for summer."
4.0,Fits well and I like the colors
4.0,"This may run big  definitely read more reviews before selecting the size. I liked the fabric. Although a nice style design, it's not my preference to have the shoulder straps be see-thru. I'm not a fan of strapless bras."
4.0,"Worked amazingly well and was quite comfortable on the &#34;hard-to-reach&#34; pierced jewelery (I have my ear tragus pierced), however fell off of the backs of my regular earlobe earrings the first night I slept with them on. Or maybe it depends on the width of the earring back. I also like the fact that they are flesh-toned (if you're Caucasian or of similar skin tones)."
4.0,"Nice bag, all my stuff fits."
4.0,"I like there are two pockets; one inside and anther is on the side. Due to the pandemic, I don't like to bring extra handbag for shopping. the pockets are definitely good for smaller items, such as car key and credit cards. I just wish the side pocket is little bigger."
4.0,good quality and nice watch
4.0,"This fit very well.  As others have said, the zipper is sewn on backward for a male garment (in &#34;Western&#34; countries), but you can't tell once it is zipped.  There is nothing about the style that makes it look feminine or masculine in particular so I am not sure why a previous reviewer would return it over the zipper.<br /><br />Also, the lining is baby-kitten soft and the garment itself is very warm.  I assume this is where the cashmere is.  One minor down side is that the pockets have enough room that you if you are not careful, you can expose the pocket material below the bottom of the sweater.<br /><br />This is also not a &#34;hard-wearing&#34; item.  I don't think it would stand up well to being worn outside an office environment.<br /><br />The only real unhappiness I have is the collars.  I would prefer if they would just lay down, but don't want to stay there.  They like to be up as shown in the picture.<br /><br />I keep it at work because our floor is kept super cold.  Even with the collars, I would give this 5 stars for being so comfortable and warm."
4.0,Super cute! The only reason I’m giving 4 stars is it’s very see through. I have my nipples pierced and you can totally see them and your underwear line. Going to wear it in Mexico.
4.0,Cute.  Wear for beach coverup.
4.0,nice shirt rare find my favorite skate brand
4.0,Cute shirt! My daughter loved it! It’s a little large. My daughter is in size 4. I ordered a 4 and it is big
4.0,I like it! you just cant hold very many cards in the card holder because it will not latch. but for the price its great
4.0,Ordered it for a Halloween costume and it was great! Would wear it again in my everyday life but it was a little more snug than I thought it would be.
4.0,I purchased this to replace my stolen check book. . I have yet to receive my new checks but this item seems a little tight as I am using it for credit cards as well till my aluminum wallet arrives. It's working.
4.0,Queda un poco ajustado
4.0,"This dress is very nice however it is a bit see through. The fabric has a great feel to it, I just wish it was a little thicker so I wouldn’t need a slip. I am 5’9 160 pounds and fits great!"
4.0,"Love the way this looks when I get it on. It fit perfectly and although assistance is needed to get it tied, it was exactly as I expected. The matching g-string, on the other hand, was way to big to fit me."
4.0,Just a bit smaller than I expected but still fits and works well!
4.0,Just as I expected. Great value! Great product.
4.0,"These gardening/work gloves are too small for my male hands but fit my wife perfectly and she likes them and uses them a lot. They allow a lot of mobility in the fingers and are light and durable. Perfect for picking up branches, trimming roses, etc.<br />These three pairs will last us a long time and I think that 3 for this price is a really good value.<br />I recommend these and would buy them again"
4.0,"1. Material feels like thinner 'bathing suit' material: there is a sheen to it (see image of reflection of my peace sign shadow), it is smooth the touch (on dry land).<br />2 It fits my current waif-like frame with bow hitting below the knee as shown on their page.<br />4. there is a thin underwear inside (see image #7, which is the last image).<br />4A) I think it is to prevent the material touching the crotch and creating a camel-toe effect -- see image #1 (w groin region pushed forward) vs image #2 (w tailbone region pushed back).<br />4B) the underwear also can create an underwear line --- see image #3 (contour of buttock has extra dent where underwear line is) vs image #4 (underwear is rolled back and the only thing underneath this short is my own underwear without any stitching on the edge to prevent the 'dip').<br />5. The underwear is very basic, it's two material sewed together, there is no extra white padding -- see image #6.<br /><br />I have not jumped into the water with them.<br />I like the idea overall and will keep it.<br />I may wear a longer top to cover the 'dip' on the buttocks. OR, I may accept it and move on. Not a major issue -- but it is an annoying one."
4.0,"Fits as expected.<br />the material is  polyester, so you can see everything if its too tight.<br />Im finicky about having bra lines, so this is something im conscious about<br />Other than that, its a cute shirt and i feel it is well depicted in the pictures."
4.0,"I just bought these and they are cute for the price. I did notice that they run a little small (I usually wear a 7 1/2 and the 7 1/2 is the exact length of my foot which looks kind of funny)and also that the bottom is made of like a suede-like material that I am sure will get dirty in no time. But other than that if you want a step above a typical flip-flop sandal this is a decent choice, they're pretty comfy too."
4.0,A little smaller than what I thought they were going to be but I think that was me not gauging the size well not an issue with the jewelry.
4.0,"Bought this for 4 year old granddaughter and she loves it.<br />Had to get a larger size because of them selling out in smaller size.<br />Very nice, well made shirt. Design is fantastic.<br />Not sure why it's designated boys it's pinks and purples .<br />It's a pain when searching for PK Mask clothing as Owlette only stuff is classified under girls and not easily located in genetic search."
4.0,Kinda loose i am a medium so i bought it in that size next time size down
4.0,Smaller than expected but beautiful! Perfect for my needs. Dainty and fits great!
4.0,"A little small, and hole for button closure was too small so I had to cut it so the button would fit. Overall, super cute though and I got a lot of compliments."
4.0,"I am a size 6 and ordered a size 10, it was still way to small."
4.0,Haven't worn them yet but tried them on and they seem to be very comfortable.
4.0,Love the watch! Only ding is the strap. IMHO it is too stiff. Good quality but I find it difficult to manipulate and it sets the smallish watch too high on the wrist. Everything else is awesome. Strap might be great to many others too.
4.0,"I bought them for a halloween costume, love the purple lenses and everyone wanted to know where I got them!  Awesome"
4.0,"It's very cute, and affordable, but runs very small."
4.0,This top is not a sweatshirt as the description says. It is a light weight long sleeve top. Nice casual top and fits true to size.
4.0,Comfortable enough.
4.0,"Although slightly large, I will order this product again, just in a smaller size"
4.0,"Sizing was strange. I had to either get them slightly too big or slightly too small. I wish I had gone with the bigger size. (trust me, order up a size no matter what you think you'd be)"
4.0,These are adorable and I will probably give them to one of my granddaughters as they are to small for me.
4.0,The dress is soft and comfy. The fabric is alittle thin and the fit is loose.
4.0,"I like the glasses and they look great.  However, these glasses never last long because the side parts of the glasses that fit over the ear ALWAYS break.  The side parts where they are joined with the small screws never hold up and I have accumulated perfectly fine glasses with one of these parts always broken!! I am coming to the conclusion that this fault in the design is planned to encourage continued sales.  I would think that this design flaw could be addressed.  Like I said, I like the product but if this continues I will have to look to another provider for my sunglasses."
4.0,Not a bad wallet. Seems to do the job for me. Only criticism is that I wish the pockets were deeper so I can flip my cards to the side for easier access.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:130d7156bfa7ec1f8f98f38a55e6524c]] In the past few weeks, I have gotten my active lifestyle back by purchasing bunion socks. The other ones that I bought cost $25 for one pair. They are left-right, so I have to lose $12.50 by throwing one out. Ouch.<br /><br />These socks are all the same. They fit both feet, so no waste. They are somewhat thin, which suits me just fine. Try it!"
4.0,This is a very large scarf. It has lots of shiny embellishments weaved into it and a bottom trim of shells and beads. It has a rich red color and is made of a rayon like fabric typical of many Indian garments. It's a nice accessory.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Great fabric, colors look vivid. I ordered a 14 and it fits great in hips but was huge in the bust. I had the busy taken in by a seamstress locally and it fits perfectly now."
4.0,"Bought this short for something to wear on leg days.  Fit is great, cut/trim/features being the main reason for my purchase.  The fabric is nice and hasn't had any random threads come loose. Pockets fit my phone (iPhone X + case) very well.<br />The flip side is that the zippers on the pockets are both already not functioning properly (2 months of regular use).  Sweat shows but not that big of a deal.<br />Will likely buy another pair in the same size."
4.0,This dress came on time. Fit great. Exactly like picture. Only con I have with this dress is the zipper in the back. Kinda hard to pull it up but I managed.
4.0,"This is most definitely a cover up item. It is completely see-through, which was disappointing because I bought it as a dress! I got tons of compliments on it as a cover up."
4.0,These pants are very nice The only problem is that the pants are nonstretch. I wear a 31 in levis and these 31 pants were too small I couldn't even button them up too tight. Go a size up or two
4.0,"The brown one is super cute. Love the zipper! The straps are a little long, and I wish they adjusted. Overall very cute!"
4.0,"the size chart is off- at least is was for me. Suggested XL,next time will order a M. Tried to shrink in the wash,but didn't shrink much. I wear it around the house."
4.0,"Pretty but smaller than I imagined and a long thread inside, like it was seen in a hurry.<br /> But altogether it's nice. I like it."
4.0,It’s really cute but maybe a tad short for this 67 year old but for a vacation or wearing around the pool or walking the beach it’s fine and you can’t beat the price. I’m five foot one and 125 lbs and got the M.
4.0,Case/bag is really soft. Comes with an extra eyeglass screwdriver. Has a small narrow fit which is good for small headed people.
4.0,"They wear well. After multiple washings, they still hold their shape, are comfortable, and look good. The crest stitching is almost unreadable. Looks really pixelated."
4.0,It's exactly like the photo
4.0,"Cloth are good quality runs a bit big, I got 18ms fits like 24m"
4.0,I am only giving 4 stars because it's more yellow tinted then green then I would have like. So comfy though! And it's good material so itll actually keep me comfortable. Very happy with my purchase ❤ I am 5 ft 6 in 170 lbs and I got a large
4.0,It is a gift for my daughter and she said she loves it. I'm impressed with the size and quality so far.
4.0,Use this when I drive help keep sun Clare away.
4.0,"I really like this shirt so far. Washed up nice, no wrinkles if you get it out of the dryer quickly. I'm 5'7 and 115 lbs and I bought a medium. It's loose, but I'm fine with that, I just had a baby. It's just a nice, comfortable, cute shirt for hanging out."
4.0,The jumper fit perfectly and it's so comfortable. I got alot of compliments at work
4.0,"I really love how cute and comfy these PJs are! The little satin trim around the neck and legs is a nice touch and makes them look like a dressier rather than frumpy pajama.<br />I only have one small complaint about them. I am 5'6"" around 125 lbs and ordered a small. The fit on most of it is great but the elastic on the shorts is just a bit too tight for me. I do not like tight things on my waist especially if they are supposed to be comfy. It is ok and I could put up with it but I plan to slit the waistband on the inside and either cut the elastic or just sew on another inch or two of elastic in and close it back up. That's really not that hard to do and will for sure make them 5 stars for me."
4.0,Runs big but still cute and like the lightweight fabric.
4.0,Great slippers but my husband wears a 10.5 shoe so we ordered the 11 cuz they run small.  Well we sent them back and ordered the 13 since 12 wasn't available and they were prefect.  They are super nice other than the sizing.
4.0,"I am 5' 4"", 130lbs in size M, and  I thought the dress was cute, the fabric was good quality, and it fit me as expected. Although the style is definitely for a teenagers, as 21 yr old I felt it made me look a little too young."
4.0,"I wanted a wallet to keep bills, coins, IDs, and credit cards in, and this one is working well. It is a bit tricky to get the credit cards out and back in, and I have no way to test whether the RFID works or not."
4.0,I’m 5’7 and 160 lbs. I normally wear a medium/size 8 but I ordered this dress in a large after reading reviews. The large was still fitted. Super cute but inappropriate for church or a funeral. The reason I initially ordered it. But I’ll keep it for a date night with the hubby. * You definitely want to order at least one size up. *
4.0,"I like these, they are more comfortable than a regular bra. They last well if you wash them in cool water on gentle with woolite."
4.0,Thinner than expected and a little large in the chest
4.0,Slightly small than anticipated and a bit see theougb
4.0,Dress was even nicer when I got it. Fits like a glove and sexy on my 5’2 130lb frame. Love love the dress got a medium but I think I could have done the small ❤️
4.0,Very cute! Super happy with my purchase. Bought it for my 3 year old.
4.0,I like the glasses. quality but  they did Fog.  Anti fig is why I bought them. But I WOULD buy them again if I needed goggles.
4.0,"Ran a little small, as a man when ordering women's panties I alway order a size up. I normally wear a medium in men's underwear so I ordered a large and the were a little smaller then I expected but otherwise the panties were good quality material and time will tell how durable they are. Will definitely be buying more of these in the future but will just size up to an XL"
4.0,Very cute! Also very sheer! Great for a beach cover up but I would be cautious wearing it out otherwise.
4.0,I would have given these shoes five stars if they were more true to size. My daughter usually wears carters or walmart brand shoes and those sizes are pretty consistent with each other. This brand runs big. I ordered a 6 but it fits like a 7.
4.0,Comfortable fit. Lite compression.
4.0,These are much narrower than expected. Picture is  very deceiving from the narrow belts I recieved.
4.0,Nice feel and color runs very small
4.0,"Bought two at the same time, both were beautiful but, when placed next to one another, one is a bit less brilliant than the other, it is a tiny issue, but still definitely there"
4.0,Very nice reader sunglasses. I would buy again and would buy other styles from Suncloud. I like polarized lenses and while these aren't 100 percent perfect they are certainly worth the money.
4.0,Super cute tank top. The bows were huge but removable so I just took them off. I already knew by reading reviews that the skulls on the back were upside down but my husband didn't even notice until I told him. It's comfortable and flattering though! Love it!
4.0,Very pretty however a couple strings started coming off as soon as i took it out of the bag
4.0,"The shirt fits perfectly, but the pocket is too loose so it just kind of flops around.  A little irritating."
4.0,"I can’t say how much I love my new backpack! I can fit far more than I could imagine inside of it and I absolutely love all the different pockets. The durable zippers, big side pockets and the fact that it’s waterproof beyond met my expectations! I would absolutely recommend purchasing this backpack!"
4.0,It stayed on while I was at the gym running. Wearing them around the house it has been slipping a little. They’re decent. Not sure if I would buy more though.
4.0,So far it’s good
4.0,"The case has an aluminum silver back, with rubber sides."
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, the color, the quality and everything was perfect ... I just didn’t like the length of the sleeves, they should be a few inches longer or shorter"
4.0,They are comfortable and fit perfect
4.0,Love yellow box sandals!
4.0,"Would have gave it 5 stars but it was missing a button, so I had to replace them all.  Otherwise, the top is very cute & fits great."
4.0,Happy with this product... no defects..
4.0,Very cute and flattering fit - toooo short for me though so I had to return :(
4.0,But material not as soft as I would have expected
4.0,Color not so nice as photo
4.0,Great choice ....
4.0,Super cute hat - unfortunately I have a rather large head and it was too small for me.
4.0,Nice floppy hat. Came early
4.0,"the charm is sort of big but hey, its a pretty necklace and sparkly, this was an awesome buy. Well worth it."
4.0,Not as thick as I had hoped for.  Otherwise I like the fit.
4.0,As the price indicates they are cheap. But will serve the purpose of wearing them to work
4.0,Very pretty if you are into big accessories. Good quality. Excellent price
4.0,"Runs small, order a size larger"
4.0,Excellent fit ware product. Trims me and all the right places without feeling overly tight or restrictive. Would recommend to anyone.
4.0,Takes some getting used to but heck<br />Of a lot easier on your back.! Carry in front pocket. I’ve had and used since January won’t go back to regular wallet.
4.0,"These are like puffy jackets for your feet. They do run a bit narrow though, so if you like to slip them on over socks you may wish to size up. I find them comfy, the bottom is rigid enough for a quick trip to the mailbox, but still bends enough to not clop clop clop when you walk. I wish the soles had a bit more squish but they are better than my hard floors and the fluffy interior is cozy soft."
4.0,It was cute but ita eyes were red
4.0,Nice color but a bit large.
4.0,bigger  and more tubular than I thought from description and picture
4.0,Stretch material.
4.0,Much better than the set I previously bought. The posts are a little more rigid and makes them easier to get the backs on. The backs are tiny though and a little difficult for my old hands. I've been unable to wear earrings for many years due to metal sensitivity and use these to get used to them again.
4.0,"Tighter than expected I wish I would have sized up for sure. Otherwise, it's exactly as pictured and the image is clear and good quality. Very cute and bright but is a slicker material with no stretch so being tight is a big con."
4.0,I wear these shorts all the time. They are stretchy and comfy. The only downfall is that I feel the top is a little loose and I wish  it were slightly tighter. Otherwise I love them!
4.0,These are my second pair of FitFlop athletic shoes and so I expected the same 8M fit and quality construction. I won’t be wearing them for a few weeks but took them out to inspect. Love the ombré effect but the quality of construction does not look like the shoe will last very long. I hope they prove otherwise.
4.0,It's a little tight to be a 3x but I went up two sizes just in case but could of went up three sizes ... nice dress for the summer though...
4.0,Good product but they t were a little smaller than I thought they would be. I decided to return them and the seller was very gracious.
4.0,The bra looks nice and the material is very soft. But i had to return it as it was very tight on my chest and back.
4.0,Much better quality than I expected for the price! I kept one and gave one to my Mom! Recommend them!! Great deal!
4.0,"Long time favorites, we came back to buy the 4th pair for my daughter to accommodate her growing feet! She refuses many other sport sandals, loves those!"
4.0,Great wings for lots of fun.  Stitching on loops came loose
4.0,Perfect super cute for work. Soft cotton material. Now just looks sloppy notning like the pic
4.0,My wife really likes it. It has a slim profile and is unique looking. I liked the price.
4.0,Some of the stitching was off so the layers were not even. It was an easy fix. Overall a very cute outfit!
4.0,I bought 2 colors in the same number black fits perfect but the brown is a little bigger than the black. But I really like this style.
4.0,Like DeFeet socks and wanted something different so got these.  DeFeet products are always good quality.
4.0,"I thought they were nice.. a little snug, but that could just be me.. LOL.. a good buy just the same"
4.0,I love the leather look. I gave it four stars because the first one I ordered fell apart in a week. I returned it and got another replacement band. This one hasn't broken yet but its only been a month.
4.0,"cute item, alittle smaller than expected.  quick shipping."
4.0,Material and pattern was not as I expected but I'm using it for work so it will do. Otherwise it fits well
4.0,Come as described. One of the chains did burst off into two but I didn’t find it a major issue
4.0,Love this! Only wish there was a cell phone pocket!
4.0,"These vests are OK but they are made with cheap material. They kind of remind me of something you would get at the dollar store. For the way that they are made I would say $20 is a lot more than I would normally pay. I'd maybe pay $12 to $15 for these.  Given that these are for my three-year-old nephew It's not a big deal but, I think the price is a little higher then I would pay for something of this quality."
4.0,Bought as a give for my sister and she loves it!
4.0,"This is a great belt.  I originally ordered the 1 1/2-inch wide belt but had a tough time getting it through my belt loops.  I returned it and got this belt in exchange.  This belt is BETTER, but it still takes a while to thread the belt through my belt loops.  I wish they would make a belt that is just a little bit more narrow--this would make threading the belt a little less of a chore.  Also, if the belt was an inch or so longer, that'd be even better yet."
4.0,A little thin so summer socks lol but these are nice socks definitely will be buying them again and came in a nice box so easy gift wrapping
4.0,"Runs big, order smaller but super cute!"
4.0,"Great outdoors/hiking/duty watch. Great bulid quality, especially given the price.<br /><br />I didn't want to spend Luminox- or Victorinox-like money. For me, this was a solid alternative, especially with its mineral glass face (I'm very happy about that ... at this price one usually only finds polycarbonate, not glass).<br /><br />I only have three cons, although nothing major. 1) Wrist band is too long (I'm not a small guy and I'm using the second-from-closest notch to the watch case); 2) Unnecessarily hefty weight; and 3) LCD/backlit display is cheap ... older technology and easily distorted if you press in the display buttons with a solid effort.<br /><br />Keeps great time, looks hardcore, and it looks/feels extremely rugged and expensive.<br /><br />Would I buy from this company again? Absolutely. Love it."
4.0,Very pretty! Will go well with a lot in my closet!
4.0,pant legs not long as i thought they would be.  ××however I do like the color and design.  Thank you
4.0,"Loved the color, and how it fit, but it was really short on one side and I didn’t realize it! But went great with leggings and brown boots!"
4.0,Cute dress I ordered a large (5'2 140 lbs) because I wanted to make sure it was a little loose. It fits great but received a pink dress instead of the wine red I ordered. They were super apologetic and issued a refund of 10% for the inconvenience. Adorable dress but definitely would have liked the red better
4.0,Gift he loves them.
4.0,I wished the material was a little bit thicker.
4.0,"Fits well if you take your measurements and order accordingly. The material is decent, the inside seemed a little unfinished as in there were lots of loose threads, but it didn't affect the look or function at all.  The bib part is a shorter than I expected but still looks good."
4.0,"Wear it all the time! One of my favorite shirts, although the emblems are a little bit itchy on the inside (near the nipple), although you get used to it!"
4.0,"I’ve been wearing this Helen’s Heart shoe style for years. I own them in 5 colors. They’re a versatile shoe that can easily be dressed up or down. The color was more like a bronze or taupe, not silver, but beautiful nonetheless. The color will match many items in my wardrobe. They are a bit rigid, so not too comfortable for extensive walking, but great for short occasions. The pair was shipped expediently and the shoes were in excellent condition. Very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"They are about 18 inches long, just covers my calves...would love a longer option"
4.0,Nice dress shirt. Runs a little small.
4.0,Its hard to find good length Jean shorts but these were a great find. They are exactly what I was looking for. I probably should have bought one size down but I just out on a belt and I'm just fine
4.0,These earrings are beautiful and super cute. They are really best for toddlers With pierced ears. I bought them for my seven-year-old and they are a little bit small for her. Otherwise very cute and so far I’ve had no issues other than size.
4.0,Con los accesorios adecuados es un vestido que se puede utilizar para cualquier ocasión.
4.0,This looks great but it's a little stuffy and makes me sweat easily.
4.0,"These are very cute, well-made PJs that are suitable for lounge wear. I see this as sophisticated tie-dye. I am very pleased with these and would purchase these at retail price. I have seen other tie-dye sets, but this is arguable the best made one I have encountered."
4.0,"A little small, (I am a between a size 7.5 and 8.5 depending on shoe brand and style) but as long as I keep my nails trim, they should last long enough. Cute :)"
4.0,"I do have small wrists, but this is kinda loose on me, but it is pretty and came the way it was advertised"
4.0,"It fits perfectly, but this bra isn't really designed for regular wear. This is the kind of bra you wear when you're expecting someone else to take it off shortly after putting it on."
4.0,I've chosen it do to the fact that it comes with a short length lockup system which fits my wrists  nicely...!
4.0,"Overall great for the look we were going for.  A little snug in the thighs and loose at the waist, but they are mens, not womens, so it was not a surprise."
4.0,"Nice piece for th price.  Bought for my daughter, who is a Frizen fan.  She loved it.  Size is nice.  Detail is pretty clear."
4.0,"I like the mesh, but the magnet keeps attaching itself to things I am around. I would like more colors to be available."
4.0,I like😊
4.0,Fun bling! A little on the heavy side.
4.0,i do like the boots. run too small. I should have ordered half size up.
4.0,"It's about a size too small.  I'll keep it, because I'm losing weight and it feels so nice. The color is pretty, too.  I'm a Plus 16 for most tops."
4.0,Update: two crystals fell off . Used just a few times since i just wear it when travelling to avoid taking with me real gold jewelry... Nice ring though if your crystals hold up.
4.0,It’s a great alternative to the sporty look of the original band.  Just a little had to open/close but I have it figured out.
4.0,"It's not a wool -feel coat as the photos imply, more flannel/felt, but it looks cool and the price rocks."
4.0,"I’m breastfeeding and have a 6 month old, so I wasn’t sure how this would work out given the excess belly fat/monster boobs I’m currently sporting! The dress isn’t bad. It’s a nice quality considering the price. I will say if you are on the “fluffy” side of things, be aware that it won’t be flattering in the middle unless you wear a corset. It’s a little stiff on the upper body if you’re full-chested. I’m not sure if I’ll keep it yet, but it is pretty for the price."
4.0,"They are really beautiful, thanks"
4.0,it is a nice dress. i purchased a large because that's what i typically wear but it was a bit loose.
4.0,LUV LUV LUV THIS PRODUCT
4.0,"These are warm and comfortable. I hate all thumbholes, so I mostly don't wear these over my hands. With my slender arms, these stretch all the way up past my elbow. They don't shrink in the wash, which is also nice."
4.0,Very pretty sneakers but it was small and narrow for my feet.  Saddly I had to send them back!
4.0,Love this purse/backpack. The fabric is lite and water resistant. Lots of pockets for organizing.<br />My only problem was delivery took much longer than expected.
4.0,Great buy! Very happy with my purchase!
4.0,My husband really likes it.
4.0,Bought for a baby that doesn’t get baptized.
4.0,"Wore it to a concert, it's comfortable, and I like it.  Not a huge fan of the clasp thing though.  It doesn't feel real secure.  I spent a weekend in it, and it never fell off though!"
4.0,"Wasn't the type of material expected, almost like a dry fit fabric. Either way, very comfortable and light. Would recommend."
4.0,Great leotard. Fully lined front and better quality than expected. I will order the Dance Favourite brand Leo’s again.
4.0,Was pleased
4.0,The kids and there friends use them.  They dont complain
4.0,"Would’ve liked them a lot more if they didn’t arrive dirty & scuffed. Cleaned up alright, just annoying"
4.0,I really like this necklace. I wish it were a little heavier.
4.0,The color and cut are very nice. It ran just a little small for my daughter but the quality was what you would expect from lands end. I only took away a star because it ran too small for us and I had to return it.
4.0,The medallion is great but the chain is a bit cheap...over all i really like it.
4.0,This wallet is great. Might not be for all of buyers because it is a little big. But in my opinion if perfect. And has many dividers to put cards and many other things at ease.
4.0,I like it very much.  It is just a right size.
4.0,"Nice shoes, but could do without the Velcro strap."
4.0,I am  very pleased with my new sandle they fit perfectly and are very comfortable
4.0,"The hat came in 2 weeks earlier than expected, which was great. I love the pink color and the &#34;Gimme Faith&#34; embroidery on the sides, but there are some issues that i encountered. One if the complications being the hanging stitches on the top lid, and the adjustable strap on the back is a little difficult to tighten at first. You can tell by the fabric it's not really good quality, but it is a decent hat for a cheap price."
4.0,Good quality and bright colors.
4.0,Cheap material but great for price.
4.0,"These are lovely little studs and great for the price. The color, however, is quite lighter than in the picture and more readily appears as zirconia."
4.0,like the socks just might have to buy another set. nice and comfortable
4.0,Very nice. Live the color...seems sturdy. Can't wait to use on my trip
4.0,"Perfect for a high school graduation - looks great, and is every bit as good as the one from Josten's, at a much cheaper price!"
4.0,"Great slippers, but I wear 11.5 and the 12 I got was way small."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8478254c392d4e55ed7b8db2d281330f]] Great budget bag. but it is EXACTLY 4 POUNDS. not 2! so you have to consider that if you are taking this on a plane. When its empty, it is about 6inch or so taller than a allowed carry on bag so there is no way you can take this on the plane so you have to check it and weight might matter depending on what you are carrying.<br />I am disappointed it came dirty. has dried up water marks all over the back. its hard to see in the picture and some mud spots.<br />I got it today and returning it so i cant speak on durability"
4.0,Size was perfect aside from the sweater a little short. Very comfortable and warm!
4.0,"I'll admit that I have narrow wrists but typically things will more or less fit. The bracelet looks exactly as it is described and I really liked it but it slipped right off my arm. I ordered two of these for layering so my plan is to see if I can tighten it since it's elastic. If that doesn't work, I'll just wear them with chunky bracelets that can hold them on. Overall - very cute and I would recommend it."
4.0,"Product was as described. Soft and design is cool. Slips a bit after talking for some time when worn as a mask, but overall like it."
4.0,"This outfit is pretty & fashionable! The picture doesn’t do its justice. Anyone looking for a pretty & nice outfit for pictures , birthday parties or any occasion this is the one . Love it !"
4.0,Nice cozy warm
4.0,"Nothing special, but its a nice dress that can be worn in a variety of settings.  Fit as expected"
4.0,Beautiful shirt.... Little bigger then I thought but still love the way it looks
4.0,Its nice and soft<br />I just wish the top had a bit more shape to it
4.0,"I bought these as a backup pair of sunglasses because I misplace my sunglasses more than I care to admit.  They are on the larger side (which is good, it blocks more sun that way.).  They seem fairly sturdy.  The reason I'm giving them four stars is that they look fine, but it's fairly obvious they're cheap sunglasses by their look."
4.0,I like these I just feel a little uncomfortable cause of the back strap not sure if it's me or its a bad design but I love how light weight its.
4.0,I think it's so useful.
4.0,Nice bag with some convenient pockets. I like that with a couple of quick disconnects i can remove the bag from the field glasses. Also laid in the prone shooting position with this on and it was not to intrusive. Easy to get on and off with your hunting jacket or bulky shirts.
4.0,"Comfortable but a little big. I have it as small as it’ll go but it’s still a bit loose, more so than I care for."
4.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding and it was a huge hit. I got so many compliments on the dress and the color. (I got the blue) I loved the fit as it was stretchy but fitted enough. I ordered a medium and there was a zipper but I didn’t need to use it, I was able to just pull the dress over my head. For the money it was a great buy and look very elegant."
4.0,"The watch is exactly as I expected it to be in size and texture. Strap is a little big because it's unisex, but otherwise it's perfectly. I bought it to have a watch while I work out. It will be great for intended purposes."
4.0,"I like how the product looks, but it is very very tight in the bust. My wife’s boobs are just too big to get the top closed. Otherwise it fits and looks pretty. She likes it too."
4.0,Pants are great but waist is very small
4.0,I like the ability to adjust the size with the buckle at the back.
4.0,Cheap looking but it does the job.
4.0,"Very cute,but runs small...order size up."
4.0,They run small because the front is pointed so I def recommend sizing up! Otherwise they are comfy and cute
4.0,"I got the size 9 and they are on the small side.  Sometimes I wear a 9, sometimes an 8.5  The 9 fits like a small 8.5.  Really cute."
4.0,GREAT.....REALLY ADDS BEAUTY AND CLASS TO JEWELRY
4.0,I don't dis like these earrings they were smaller then expected. they are nice for men. maybe more for teens
4.0,i like the look of this one must get more colors.
4.0,I bought this product for my granddaughter.
4.0,"It took a long time to get the order, but the glasses are exactly as  shown. Very lightweight and comfortable. They are a little darker than I anticipated, but I will get used to them."
4.0,My hubby loved them
4.0,Fit better than flip-up's.  Polarizing works well but I wish they were a bit darker.  Great price!
4.0,I love the quality but there is a hole in the middle like a burnt whole
4.0,Nice but no pockets
4.0,nice belt for the price!
4.0,"I think this watch is very cool, I am worried about the longevity of the watch and how well it will last. So for the meantime will probably gravitate towards the metal watch. But overall a very cool and neat watch"
4.0,I like it. The fabric is a teensy bit rougher than I like but not enough to send it back. It fits as expected. The length is good. Seems well made. Washed up good.
4.0,Comfortable. Wish there were more colors. The gold squares on the shoulders look tacky. I'm looking for a way to remove them.
4.0,It's a cute Clutch really simple well made and with natural smell of the material.<br />Nice size and slim as a normal clutch<br />It comes with a magnet clasp for closure<br />Good for the price
4.0,Better made than I thought.  Doesn't look like an expensive piece. I had fun wearing it.  Shipped from China.
4.0,"I had to re-lace the ribbon, but once I got it where I wanted it, it fit perfectly on my body. I order the dark blue. I loved the color. You want to hand wash it as well unless you want to unlace it to save the ribbon."
4.0,"Don't like long for summer, don't like to short. These are just above the knees. Nice fit. 5ft. 1, 125lb."
4.0,It’s the perfect length to wear with skirts or high waisted pants without tucking in. Comfortable and love the wide straps. It doesn’t quite lay flat in the torso section but cute anyways.
4.0,this fit great and looked adorable but the ribbon all started fraying after 1 use
4.0,"So soft, so cute, lovely color.  Not sure about the paws."
4.0,"B+ This jewelry case is perfect for earrings, rings and chains but it's really not large enough for necklaces that have pendants larger than a dime. If the part that hold necklaces were larger then I feel it would be a five star product.<br /><br />Overall I'm content with this travel jewelry case and I've used it already a half of a dozen times and the material, zipper, and dividers have remained intact. I don't think that this would be the type of case for the outdoor adventure as it seems to be slightly delicate.<br /><br />I would recommend this product!"
4.0,I like everything about these earrings but be aware that the blue heart is darker than shown online. They may not show up as well with long dark hair but with short hair the light will shine through showing off the color.
4.0,"I looked up ""jewelry for women"" and this is beautiful jewelry for children. Not my size at all."
4.0,I took this on a long trip to Morocco and it turned out to be the perfect visor... very light and easy to hang on my purse and then use when needed.<br /><br />I do think it was pricey for what it is but it really worked for my trip.<br /><br />I agree with some comments that the band is too tight but since I am petite it didn't present a problem for me.
4.0,"The best thing about this cuff bracelet is the magnetic clasp.  It holds beautifully, and it's very easy to attach.  Clasps on bracelets are often difficult to maneuver, but this one works perfectly.<br /><br />As for the bracelet itself, I do like the colors and textures.  There are tiny beads, contrasting shades of blue, gold, and white, and everything is flexible.  But there are some loose threads (especially around the beaded triangle in the center -- see posted picture).  The bracelet fits loosely on my wrist -- I would like it more if the fit was snugger.  But it's not adjustable.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the bracelet.  The best part is the magnetic clasp!"
4.0,"My second pair of Peppers and I got to say the are awesome sunglasses for the price. Word of warning on this model though, I would say they are a blue/green mirrored finish rather than just a straight green mirrored finish as shown in the picture. Otherwise Awesome glasses with an excellent warranty policy. One star knock for the mirrored finish being different than the picture, otherwise I love them"
4.0,I wear this every day! I love the phrase on it! It is trying to tarnish a tad bit already though.
4.0,I bought the large and have a 32-34 waist and these fit quite snugly.  I've never bought an extra large and would feel silly doing so. Otherwise these are very nice boxers so far.
4.0,Purse is exactly as pictured. Shipping was about 2 1/2 weeks. Purse is cute a on the smaller size. It does have a weird smell though and I have had the purse a few days and cant get rid of the smell though. I am hoping a few more times using it the smell will wear away.
4.0,"great fit, comfortable and looks professional"
4.0,"Nice dress but on my 5’ 10.5” size 14-16 frame, it is a little too short."
4.0,overall the product is good and recommendable to others but the cover start to slide down from your face as soon as you put it on yours.
4.0,"My husband loved the feel of the material but I would advise sizing up.  I am reordering, because I didn't save the packaging, and ordering an XL.  My husband usually wears a large."
4.0,Wish the face was bigger but I enjoy looking at my wrist. Kids are amazed when they see this quality relic. It’s a watch not a bracelet :-)
4.0,"I really like this dress, it's just extremely snug. If you have any belly, it will show in this dress"
4.0,Nice watch. Thank u
4.0,"Very cute! Soft, comfortable, though not for those with a long torso, I think. It's nice and thin and cute!"
4.0,"It is of good quality. A Hanes Beefy. I'm 6'1"" and like to ware my Tee Shirts tucked in. But they did'nt have tall sizes so I have to ware it untucked. no B.F.D.<br />  I'd recomend buying it."
4.0,"Patch on that was smaller than expected,otherwise printing quite detailed"
4.0,A tad bigger than I expected but it looks very nice.
4.0,Cool pants run a little small though....
4.0,she loved it def fit her ear well and the pic does not do the ear wrap justice. def would reccomend
4.0,They will fall off my kid's feet ever so often but generally a great shoe for the price
4.0,Its a litle small
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  The color is every bit as vibrant as the photos suggest and it looks much more expensive than it is.  I don't know why, but I was expecting it to be larger: it isn't quite small, but not really the statement piece of jewelry I was hoping for.  Regardless, I'm happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend."
4.0,great product but one wheell broke first time travelling
4.0,Sized a bit large.  Advised to order 1 size up but the belt is way too long.  Should have ordered the actual waist size
4.0,"they arrived on time.  they were a little difficult to put on the bracelet, but I think they will do the job"
4.0,All the features of the watch are fine except the illuminating light. It is too weak to be effective. Only lights the far left of the watchface
4.0,"I bought these rings for my husband since he worked with food-safety metal detectors and he needed something he could wear there. The rings fit him comfortably, were easy to get on and off, and look nice while being flexible.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted rate in return for a fair and honest review."
4.0,"I love these earring, though they're much smaller than they appear here (Maybe an inch or so in length) so it's hard to see until you're closer. They're high quality and pretty, just small."
4.0,A lil long but pretty
4.0,"love the fabric,  soft, stretchy, drapey 95% rayon5%spandex knit.  the fit does run asian-small.  I am normally a 1X (45"" bust) and the 4X fits .  is made reasonably well (neck is somewhat high for my taste).  at 5'5"", it is barely long enough be worn as a dress, but great as a tunic.  being from that era, I love the tie-die print.<br />hint - on the drop-down size chart, a size '1X big' is actually a 4X."
4.0,"It has a women’s zipper on it.  Mans pull is always on the right side, women’s on the left. Nice jacket though."
4.0,"These are cute and very soft and comfy pants. They run a tiny bit large, but I'd rather have them a bit bigger as fast as kids grow. I just wish the drawstrings worked and they had some sort of of elastic around the ankle."
4.0,"I packed this for a trip where I knew I'd need an extra day pack. It's not durable enough to carry a laptop on the airplane,  but it can carry a tablet in a case and all my stuff for days running around on a trip. My only negative comment is, would it kill them to put the words ""turn pack inside out first"" on the photos about getting it back in its collapsible carry bag? Took me a little while to figure that one out."
4.0,Like the blouse & color as well... just like the picture
4.0,I found the size of the links didn’t look right on my wrist which is very small.  Product was pretty and would look great on a normal wrist size.
4.0,"I was excited when this arrived because the appearance was great. Exactly what I was looking for. However, the adjustable fit was not precise enough for my wrist. This is the type of adjustable fit where you add/remove links to adjust the fit. It was either too loose or too big on me. Disappointed that I had to return it."
4.0,"I gotta say this is really good.  And using my experience from the past, I order one size larger then normal US size (buying M size clothes in the US, order a large one here).  This Method works pretty well.  The quality is not perfect, comes in ok, I think it will break after 10 washes (I just suspect that by looking at the material and the way it was sewed), you get what you pay for.  Look really good after putting it on."
4.0,Great watch. Value for money!
4.0,Very cute but runs large in size
4.0,"This is beautiful, but needs to be worn delicately. The construction and material are not very durable. Very pretty to look at though."
4.0,I agree they run small.  I ordered 2 sizes.  They do run small.  Jacket length is shorter than a bigger man would probably like.  But overall the jacket is nice.  The storage pockets are just what my husband likes.
4.0,"I love these. When my pleaser shoes straps brake, it reeves my shoe right up. But this time around one of the straps broke the second day I used it. It's usually not like this."
4.0,It’s form fitting but also comfortable.  The dress has a quality appearance even though it’s casual wear. The fabric is soft and stretchy and the stitching secure. If you are very curvaceous there will be a bit of optical illusion as your curves stretch out the horizontal stripes. The hood is just the right size and I like the extra long hood pulls to add to the design.
4.0,"Pretty skirt, got several comments when I wore it."
4.0,These mittens are great! Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I have small hands and these are snug. But they should stretch out and they feel wonderful.
4.0,Little large in the waist.  May need a slip or hose depending on what color you get (white was a little sheer).
4.0,"Small, but pretty"
4.0,"The wallet is well made and exactly what I was looking for.  I'd actually rate it as a 4.5, and would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the two corners that had a little bit of stitching and material that had to be trimmed off so it didn't scrape my hand when I took it out of my front pocket."
4.0,Runs way big. Not true to size but fabric seemed off decent quality. Love the yellow print! Too bad I had to return it due to size.
4.0,great coverage on your face glasses are little short and don't wrap fully around though and then nose piece isn't changeable and is a little hard
4.0,The large was a perfect fit for me. They were so fun to wear and made me feel festive and feminine. Thank you!
4.0,Love it so far fits very well nice material good color
4.0,It's comfortable and fits perfect.
4.0,Very nice dress....measurements are spot on. I ordered a 2xl and am 250lbs and 5'6 but it is kinda short....otherwise great buy!
4.0,"Set is very beautiful, I would have liked the puff heart could open or the part where the chain connects could unscrew. So you can put your own tiny stones. Other than that it's all good"
4.0,"Very cute, nice size! Fits my heels, knee pads, water bottle and body spray as well as has a good place to put my keys and wireless headphones"
4.0,wife likes (me too)
4.0,"Loved the fit and the warmth level. Used these pants for a recent winter trip to Zion Nat’l Park and Bryce Canyon NP. Did a ton of strenuous hiking and also used the pants as my base layer underneath a dry suit for deep River wading/hiking. Pockets are pretty good, but these pants could use a venting zipper high up on each leg, and also a better belt. Size 34”x32” for layering."
4.0,"I’m 5’6 and 180ish lbs, this dress is now a staple for summer. I wore this and received so many compliments. The fit was nice and flowing. I am busty, but with a few adjustments of straps, I had no issues. I liked it so much I ordered another one. You won’t go wrong with this one."
4.0,The package came with some other kind of piercings that it has not been in the picture of the product. But overall is good.
4.0,"I bought this to wear to a concert. It really worked well. Looks nice, there was a funny smell to it in the beginning but washing took the smell away."
4.0,"I wish they were a little larger, but I can only wear surgical steel so I’m happy with this purchase"
4.0,Nice looking and plenty of space inside.
4.0,Description states that it is a men's watch.  I have a small wrist and the band barely fits me. I would consider this a boy's watch.  Other than that the watch keeps good time and I'm satisfied with it otherwise
4.0,"One needs to be sure to order the correct size as this bra does not have any room for adjustment, but if you are looking for latex free, this fits the bill"
4.0,"The fit is what I expected, being flat footed and having a wide foot as well, they fit where they should (just a touch tight) they still feel godd when I am walking or running.  and the price wasn't bad either."
4.0,Perfect size and comfortable. You can barely tell you have them on.
4.0,My GrandDaughter loved it. The color and pattern really looked good on her.
4.0,Got a ton of compliments when I wore it. Super cute. Super flattering! Embroderie was gorgeous!
4.0,"I bought these as my first pair of thigh high socks.  I have lupus and when I get cold I am in pain for days and am looking for cute ways to stay warm.  I could not find enough reviews from people with my body type so here is mine.  I am 5'2/5'3ish, 152lbs and kinda curvy.  I wear a size 10/12 pant and 7.5/8 shoe.  These can be pulled all the way up to my bum.  They are snug on the widest part of my thigh which for me is about 3 inches down from how high I can pull them so the tight top part of the band doesn't cut off my circulation, but they are noticeably snug.  If you wear larger than a size 12 pant I don't see them being very comfortable.  They are thick and tight from toe to thigh, when I try rolling them down to right above the knee it was very uncomfortable.  I will be getting several more pairs as they are good quality and I'm certain with regular wear they will relax a bit :)"
4.0,"It is very cute and nice cotton French terry material, but the pants have clearly been worn (and possibly even washed) as they had some wear on the knees and grass stains. The top was brand new with tag attached. My kid didn't notice or care so I decided not to return it. The fit is pretty loose even for my above average height and weight kiddo. She thought it was pajamas at first, but decided it was not soft enough to sleep in."
4.0,"The strap fabric seems a bit ""delicate"" and the durability is yet to be tested, but it looks great and is the perfect length for my UBass."
4.0,"Tailored blouse, I love it."
4.0,I wear this band everyday. It looks good and fits well
4.0,Excelente pero algo grande
4.0,My sisters loved these.
4.0,Love the fitting of the shirt
4.0,"I thought this would look just like a face, but you can tell it's slightly larger than a normal-sized face. Still very funny!"
4.0,Very nice! I really like wearing this since it's neutral and looks simple yet elegant.
4.0,"The earrings arrived quickly and are very pretty.  The only thing noticed when I opened the packet was that the stones were noticeably different from each other however once they are on your ears, you cannot tell this at all and look very pretty.  Great size too."
4.0,I really like this roomy purse and the color. I am a little concerned about the handles however as I am not sure how well they will hold up. They seem flimsy and hopefully they will last a while.
4.0,"Great price on some cute shoes for the summer that work great for both work and fun. I was going to pair these with a dress for a wedding but the leopard belt I bought didn't look right. HOWEVER, I have been able to pair with other outfits and even into the office."
4.0,It was super cute ! My daughter is a 4t to 5t but she is short. The straps on the shirt where too long I had to cut and re sew them shorter to cover her.
4.0,"This shirt is pretty much the same as the Brandy Melville company, but instead of having the alien made of thread, it's just a plastic print on the shirt."
4.0,I am 5'-8&#34; and this dress stops above my ankles. Super cute.
4.0,I like this. They are just smaller than i expected.
4.0,Great smaller hoops not tiny . I'm just not thrilled about how careful you have to be with them ie  don't sleep or shower with them. I wanted something i could wear and forget.
4.0,"Excellent quality sunglasses; unfortunately they don’t look great on me and I will be returning them, but hopefully I can find a style that does."
4.0,I love the adjustible sliders for the elastic on the ears. the nose area seems a little small and doesnt tighten across my nose at all so I am mostly breathing through the area above the nose. it fogged up immediately but a little anti- fogging agent works great!
4.0,"Specifically speaking, if your tatas have left their home base best pick another dress.  Yet, if you are fit and team with all parts in their original location, This dress is a beauty."
4.0,Charm is a good value but very thin
4.0,"They look similar to the picture advertisement.  My hands are large, but the fit is nice.  Hard to guage how long go keep yhem plugged up but I like them."
4.0,Aside from sizing...great transaction
4.0,The flowers are very cute and the material feels great.
4.0,A LITTLE SMALL BUT THEY ARE GORGEOUS
4.0,"The bracelet itself if beautiful, the packaging was beautiful.  I wish I did not have to return it, but I simply cannot get it onto my hand without causing myself significant pain and eventually, I am sure, breaking the safety chain.  They would have a great product if they extended the safety chain and made the clasp a bit bigger.  Don't order this unless you have  tiny wrists and hands."
4.0,Comfortable but makes you sweat after a little while and shows on the clear part of the mask. Doesn’t fog up when you speak though!
4.0,"Love these cute vintage style, antique coin/foot jewelry around your ankle (only).  Fits well.  Just be ready for a little 'clink, clink' noise as you walk.  I'm a silver wearer, so this is the perfect accent - it's fun and pretty sturdy (not as delicate as some others)."
4.0,I usually wear 7.5 hug this one runs small n the material is hard. Cute shoes though. I will buy again n up the size. Love the colour.
4.0,"Nothing, except the back of the ""pin"" is a cheap rubber cap that didn't hold the pin in place.  So sad because this is a really cute piece of funky jewelry."
4.0,"Bought this for my husband, nice leather and plenty of room with a zipper"
4.0,I love that this comes with a pack of three sunglasses. Each of them look good but they do feel a little cheap when holding them. They are cute but just a bit too large for my face where it touches my cheeks and I don’t like it.
4.0,I would have gave it 5 stars but the earrings are just too big and they are made for a older person and not a child ! Other then that I like the set !
4.0,I bought these glasses for my husband.  He really likes them although they were too big for his head.<br /><br />He had to cut down the arms to make them fit.
4.0,"It's a little clunky to get on the controller, but it's fine once it's on."
4.0,"Really cute, but a little small. I'll probably give it to my daughter. She'll love it!"
4.0,"I thought this was super cute - great quality for the price.  Unfortunately, I returned it because it was a bit shorter than I wanted.  I would recommend it though."
4.0,Nice shirt with great colors.  The material is sort of scratchy and not very soft or breathable. It holds its shape after washing and I lay it flat to dry.
4.0,"I have absolutely no complaints about this dress - it’s comfortable with pockets and plenty of stretch, seems well made, and the fit is flattering. For me, though, the t-shirt-like short sleeves work best for younger women and more casual settings—not quite business casual, in my opinion."
4.0,I love the glasses but they are too large for me
4.0,It’s super soft and warm! Which is great. The only downsize is that i don’t see it working for someone who is claustrophobic or someone who has sever anxiety due to its thickness. I have anxiety and I was freaking out after a few mins. But my husband was okay with it. Just something to keep in mind.
4.0,Thay are rilly pretty the bad part was one of the flowers came broken but was aboule to glue it on
4.0,Thin material and not soft
4.0,"I bought this to wear as a liner to a dress that was thin, and thought it could have other uses, too, maybe a nightgown or bathing suit cover up. It was longer than I thought it would be, but still OK with the dress.  There was some extra fabric under the arms that sort of bags out, but it didn't show under the dress, and I'm hoping the first wash will tighten it up a bit. I love bamboo fabric, but if you haven't owned it before, you should be aware it's rather heavy and has little body to it. On the plus side, it's antimicrobial and won't smell quickly. Very soft and lovely next to your skin."
4.0,This is comfortable and filtered well for the COVID virus. I have lung breathing problems & was told by my Doctor that regular masks retain the C02 which could make me pass out or have a heart attack. This mask with the exhaust works great. Only wish it came with instructions on how to put together. It is in pieces.
4.0,"It is a slim tie. Not skinny, slim. But the material it's made out of makes it a bit thick? Whoever great buy for the price you pay."
4.0,The gloves were exactly as expected
4.0,"The quality of the socks is excellent. The colors are so pretty. And 100% cotton socks are hard to find in pretty colors. They are just a smidge small. I wear a woman's size 8 shoe, which I've always considered a rather normal size - not too small and not to big. The socks fall a little short on my heel and don't come up to the top of the shoe. I guess that might be the &#34;no show&#34; feature, but they pull on my toes. I only gave the socks 4 stars, which is still an excellent review, because they are just a little small in my opinion. They're really cute, though."
4.0,"It's a great quality tail in my opinion although you do NOT want to get it wet at all. Just a little bit got dipped in water when I was at an animal shelter playing with the dogs there, only for me to shortly find out later that you could smell dead animal constantly. It didn't go away for months. So please, when buying this tail, don't get it wet. Other than that, it's perfect!"
4.0,Not very flattering for a large woman. I looked like a Christmas ornament.
4.0,"Decent quality. The lace is very thin and if I'd needed it for more than just a night, I'd reinforce it with more glue or some stitching."
4.0,Its nice but material is different then what I expected
4.0,The zippers are not as strong as the 2018 versions and i took them to my seamstress after the pocket zipper broke and she put the larger zipper as on tge older version
4.0,Ran a little small. But most adorable shirt ever!!
4.0,"I like the top and ordered a small however, it’s still very very loose. I’m 5’4” and 125lbs with 36ddd so I thought it would be fine but.... I’m mildly disappointed."
4.0,"These worked very well for the first few wears, then my 6 month old found a way around them and was able to get her socks off about half of the time. Also they seemed to stretch a little bit the more that they were used and they don't seem as tight as they used to. I would imagine these would be more effective if paired with a heavier sock on the baby. Overall, good product and worth the money."
4.0,"Its a stylish watch.. Ferrari made (of course) and burns a deep hole in the pocket.<br /><br />Pros -<br />Looks great (grandiose).. feels heavy.. you get noticed (and earn nice compliments too)..<br />Has decent basic day-to-day features like alarm, chronograph, timer, second city/world time option, etc.<br /><br />Cons -<br />1. For a watch that has fair digital bells and whistles, I wonder how difficult it is to incorporate an illumination/indiglo feature for the darker shades of the day.. Or are the people wearing this watch the kind who never step off the limelight ?<br />2. The glow from the hands of the watch does not last all that long... so after about an hour of dim light surrounding you, you have a heavy feeling in your hand from a object that is of no use, as you cant see anything to use it (unless you are super human and light glows from your eyes or elsewhere) .. Those are the times I get why someone said 'Money cant buy everything'..<br /><br />If you find an alternative to this jewel that can also glow in the dark, do go for that one. But if style prevails over substance on your wish list, you've landed on the right satin cloth. The beautiful case and packaging will win you over ( and make you forget what you had to forgo to buy this one). A super gift for the guy in your life (pop, bro, granda, chum, mr right).. Only if it could last into the dark, it would tag along with you into the starry night..<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Con 3: (Just realized) No DST support for the World Time. Maranello, home of Ferrari follows Daylight Saving Time settings. So, why for the love of cognitive abilities in humans, would they not incorporate it in this World Time watch?<br />All the world times seem to match perfectly until you incorporate DST time in the watch for your city (T1). Once your country is set to DST, all the other cities in the world have to follow DST (Ferrari leaves them with no choice.. that answers my question from above).<br /><br />I wish I could remove one star from my rating for this, but the damn thing looks so elegant that you could act as if you care less. Besides, who on Earth does not have a phone for those silly things like check the time at night or in a different city. This rock on your hand is just an accessory that happens to show time and do a faint bit more..."
4.0,I wear a 16 so normally a XL fits well.  I thought this is a little tight.  I love the color though.  It will work great with my bathing suit.
4.0,"Cute jacket, just wish the sleeves were longer"
4.0,Product fit well. I ordered a 2xl and surprisingly it fit me (as a fitted shirt).  Picture came out well also.  I copied an anime pic from online.
4.0,For the price you can't beat these sunglasses. They fit amazingly and don't fit tightly. I usually get tired of wearing sunglasses after 4 hours but these are very light weight.<br /><br />The only con is that the case to carry the sunglasses around in is very big and the magnetic part has stopped working.
4.0,"I like this dress. It's cute and comfortable. The only draw back is the odd elastic band around the bottom.  From the photo you cannot tell that the black band is elastic. I'm not sure why this is. Mine arrived all twisted up, which cause the dress to bunch up.  A quick removal of the elastic was all it took to remedy the issue.  I get lost of compliments on this dress."
4.0,Love them!! Would definitely buy again!!!
4.0,"A little too thin, but useable"
4.0,"Very cute, vibrant colors. The pant legs are a bit long."
4.0,It's was just to big
4.0,"It’s compact to use, but complicated to handle."
4.0,I absolutely love these earrings. The are comfortable and go with anything. They also don't irritate my skin.
4.0,Must wear this dress with confidence!!!!! Its lovely.  It will hug every curve and you better believe it will show every roll if you have em. Nothing a lil spanx can't fix and have you SNATCHED! Size 2xl!  229lbs 5ft5. The dress makes you feel so girly indeed.
4.0,I like the texture of the protective cover and it has a button for the trunk release.
4.0,I actually ended Returning this item only because they ordered a size too large. I ended up ordering a different dress so my review is basically void! But I will say that even though it is cheaply made it was a pretty cute dress and I will probably be buying it in the future.
4.0,"no give in the material. great shirt, just buy it 1 size bigger :)"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6b2f9949e9286aee77b8ee64118a2573]] My wife used it at home. She didn’t like me buying it but, she used it all the time. She kept dropping stuff down her shirt. This stopped that."
4.0,"The jacket is meant to be an oversized boyfriend fit, but on top of the style it’s still too big and I got a medium. (Normally a size 4) I think if I go down a size it’ll fit perfectly. Quality is great and it’s so cute otherwise."
4.0,"Beautiful frame however it is been a year since I bought it and the hinges keep coming loose. If you need a frame to wear all the time, this is not for you."
4.0,"So soft! So cute! So sweaty! Definitely holds in heat and moisture. Despite making me sweat more (I'm not a big sweater) I didn't notice sweat Mark's on the outside so that's a plus. As soon as I opened these I hoped I would love them bc they're so soft! I was worried about the elastic in the top but, it didnt bother me. I love these.<br />I am 5'2 135 ordered a small. Fits great, just a little too long."
4.0,I like the size of the bib (long and covers clothing well)---material is quite thin and flimsy.
4.0,Good quality for the price. Fits a bit big. Fits Way better then any other brands tho.
4.0,Beautiful but came broken.  My aunt liked it so she found a little silver catch to put it together with.
4.0,Nice dress for the price. It's definitely more on the casual side. Comfortable and can be flattering.
4.0,nice looking sweet shirt but sizes run small
4.0,"And a soft material that doesn't wrinkle, has good flex... all in all, an excellent product at a very reasonable price..."
4.0,Nice pendant and style. Cheap chain.
4.0,"Great material, and fit just right.  My only complaint was the end came in bent!"
4.0,"I love them, but they need to be a bit larger for a size 8 shoe"
4.0,"Runs a bit large, but super comfy and soft. Works great with leggings. Flattering cut that is not too boxy. Washed and dried as normal and held up well. Will be ordering in more colors (and a size smaller)."
4.0,This is stretchy material all the way thru...have to handle with care so that the material does not drag
4.0,It was a little warm but super cute. People loved it.
4.0,Buena calidad en el material
4.0,Satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,Solid quality but its tooooooooo big for my baby boy
4.0,I liked it. I kept it
4.0,Simple and casually elegant. I receive complements at work for this watch
4.0,Soft and comfy.. not yet washed but hopefully it stays good. Very cute and casual dress.
4.0,"This is a great value, it looks as pictured. The finish on the clasp is a little cheapy but still nice for the price."
4.0,It made a nice Christmas gif
4.0,The shoes is good but size 11 was 30.I don’t know why it came on 29.too small for my daughter 😒
4.0,It's a little difficult to take the links out and it would help if there was instructions included on how to remove links...<br />The band is so pretty! I love it so far!
4.0,Absolutely adorable.  We got so many compliments on my son at the wedding we attended.  My only complaint is that the shirt kept on coming out of the pants.  Wish there was a button or something inside the pants to keep the shirt down.
4.0,Material is stretchy fits comfortably.
4.0,It like this blouse fit as expected and it is very comfortable. I even use it to work. I got an XL - 173lbs 5.7 H. I hope this helps
4.0,"Very neat product, but the bracelet turns my wrist green.  Alas, it is not stainless steel."
4.0,This dress is beautiful. Fits perfect. A lot longer than the picture. Very lightweight. Comes to my calls/ankles. Flows really nicely.
4.0,Super cute and comfy dress. It was a bit tight when I got it but now that I’ve used it a couple of times it sits better. I feel great in this. Fabric is not the softest you’ll find out there but it’s comfy enough.
4.0,I leaned against my glasses and broke them- so sad because I love them.<br />Any way I can return them for another ???<br />Don’t know where to return them.<br />I have bought a few for others. Love them too.<br />I have only been wearing them since the end of March.<br />Thanks for your anticipated response.<br /><br />Susan-<br />suzn911@gmail.com
4.0,"It's SUPER cute. I ordered a GG and I wear a DD, so I hoped it would be kind of big and full coverage would be easy. It fits like a DD would. So it's good, but lord, I'm glad I went up several sizes."
4.0,This shirt is comfy and very soft. I sized up but the sizin is a little smaller than I expected. If wanting a more loose fit I would size up.
4.0,I gave these to my classmates as a gift. They are cute but a little cheesy.
4.0,Dress fit well. Simple black dress. Exactly what I wanted
4.0,"Work fine, worth what I paid for them."
4.0,Very pretty but stiff.
4.0,"What you see is very much what you get here.  This is the sort of necklace you would pick up at the mall.  Something Hot Topic might carry.  The cross is large (around 3 inches long) and rather heavy and is at its best from a distance of several feet or more but doesn't suffer overly much upon inspection.  The heart is acrylic so while shiny, it does not sparkle like it would if it were crystal but then it would also undoubtedly cost more.  This would be a really nice piece for a costume and is not bad just for wearing around.  No one is going to mistake it for a priceless relic but it doesn't look shoddy either and has a nice heft to it.  This belongs to my daughter who is a bit gothy and adores it.  She has paired it with both casual and dressy outfits and it looked decent with both."
4.0,"Really cute dress. Good quality for the price. Very flattering! Happy with it! Always a risk to get a good fit online. Btw, I'm 5'1&#34;, 135 lbs with a D cup and got a great fit with the XL."
4.0,It's tight but LONG.  DEEP pockets. Great Jersey for the price
4.0,Great hat for the price! It's really round so I've had to shape it to fit my head. Overall I'm very happy!
4.0,Super adorable and well made! The only complaint is that the sleeves were too short. But my 4 year old loved this outfit!
4.0,"Ordered this to replace the wrist band on my Samsung smartwatch. I had no problems switching the band and once clasped together via the magnet, it stayed on very well.<br />However, at times when the watch moved or shifted, the band would pull the fine hairs on my arms which made it uncomfortable to wear when that happened and due to it not really being able to be adjusted for size, it stayed kind of loose.<br />Lastly, in order to get the band to fit, it essentially clasped at the very end of the band, where it met the watch. This actually caused the turn dial to become unresponsive. I finally learned that was the issue after researching and removing the band. I had to go back to the original band in order fo the turn dial to work again (which it does now).<br /><br />Overall, a good concept and a fine product perhaps for those with bigger wrists who can keep the magnet away from the turn dial. For me personally, the band wasn't for me."
4.0,"Its way cute, can't wait till she's born to wera it!!"
4.0,My daughter loves this suit.  It doesn't require pulling or picking during swim classes.
4.0,"Given as Christmas gift, received very pleased"
4.0,"Very nice, gets the job done."
4.0,"I am 5’0” and 135 lbs - I ordered a medium and had to exchange for a small. The medium would have worked but I wanted the dress to fit snugly and be short enough for my short legs. Just like the picture, very comfortable and cute!"
4.0,Beautiful deep purple color but feel a bit flimsy.
4.0,Nice dress would recommend. True to size.
4.0,"It's a cute shirt, but I never wore it. I gave it to my sister because she's much smaller than me."
4.0,It's flat . I was expecting full egg shape but it still looks really nice. We'll see how the wife feels on Valentines day.
4.0,"I use to used a front pocket wallet and the clip would dig into my thigh, this one does not.  It harder to get items out, but everything stay in it."
4.0,"If the handle drop were just a couple of inches more this bag would be perfect! I love it though! It is beautiful, looks rich. I love the color (I chose the navy blue). The bag is dressy enough for work, but looks great with jeans for the weekend. This was my first Scarleton bag, and will not be my last!"
4.0,Very nice.  Like the fact that it is stainless steel.  Chain could have been longer.
4.0,The quality is first rate.  My only complaint is the washed cord is a bit stiff.  The design is very crisp and well defined.
4.0,"This shirt was something that stuck out to me being that it had a nice slogan and who doesn't like glitter right? Here are some things I liked and noticed about the muscle shirt:<br /><br />-The material is thin, it's super lightweight so keeping it for workouts at home, a night shirt, or adding a camisol/tank top under it would solve the problem.<br /><br />-The straps are not the same width, they are slightly off and roll with how thin the material is and how the edges are sewn. The stitching was not knotted on one and I had to run a few stitches myself to secure the strap before it unraveled.<br /><br />-The shirt washes just fine inside out in cold water and air drying. It needs a light iron because you end up with a wrinkled ball, but again the wording on the shirt stayed put nicely.<br /><br />-The length on this shirt was nice. Being that I have a longer torso, finding a good exercise shirt is hard because most come to the tops of my hips and aren't as comfortable.<br /><br />-This runs small, the length was awesome but the width was a bit off so I would say go up a size.<br /><br />Overall for the price this shirt is a nice lightweight style that pairs better with an undershirt if wearing it to the gym etc. the shirt is fitting for home use and night shirt use as well. Aside from from seam issues that I fixed the shirt washes just fine with no defect to the printing on the shirt.<br /><br />I did receive this workout style tank at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the product after using it."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:18817a8e3edbca4ad35feff31f8c9dda]] Value for money. Light weight, stylish. Only deducted one star bc it's not got lots of faces to choose from and the OS could be more user friendly"
4.0,"Soft and stretchy material with great drape/weight/hang to it. It’s very comfortable to wear and looks as depicted in the photo. I am 5 foot 9 and the length was great, not too short and not too long as it does not brush along the floor either. I ordered my typical size and it fit as in the photo, a bit loose. The only downside is the back of the garment is pretty revealing/open. Also, the portion of the garment below the straps (at the back) kind of hangs loose and off the body a little bit, it’s either to be worn without a bra or one that is meant to show (from the back)."
4.0,"The arm loops are coming off as they are like tourniquet to my fluffy arms apparently. The dress is pretty and once I chop those puppies off, I can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"Good for traveling, and when you have your period, just throw it away at the end of the day"
4.0,"Yeah so they okay and all and it is definitely makes me look a little slimmer but when I go to the gym or on a run they have a irritating habit of cinching all up in my sacs, now it's not a full wedgie but it is uncomfortable enough to make me adjust. All in all I am not unhappy and I think it was worth the money but I'm going to buy a pair  that are more Capri like and of course you can get that here on Amazon"
4.0,LOVE for the price! Covered with spray polyurethane to keep metal from tarnishing. Works great and everyone loves it on
4.0,"It is a super cute dress.  The reviews pointed out that it runs big, so I ordered a small.  Still too big...cute and comfortable though."
4.0,Just a tad large under the arms.  But this was for my skinny 14 year old for homecoming.
4.0,""" I can't breathe"" is what you would say if you can still brethe after puttin this one. It is very soft so I thought it could stretch to L/XL, I bought a XXL because its a tank top , but this fit more like a medium.<br />I am sending it back, if you ear medium, order the XXL"
4.0,"The original bag I ordered was all black and it turns out they were out of stock, but the email I received just informed me that the ordered was cancelled with no explanation.  I had to email ebags to find out why.  They did not suggest another color nor tell me which colors were available.  I was lucky in that the second bag I ordered was in stock.<br /><br />The bag itself is excellent, good quality and well insulated."
4.0,Easy to put on and stays on!
4.0,"Bag was awesome, but a bit small my laptop would not fit inside. I would buy it  againif it was bigger."
4.0,I like the font of the letters and it was pretty but a little small.
4.0,Smaller than I thought they would be even though I had recognized the size indicated.  Still pretty.
4.0,Really pretty but smaller than expected
4.0,"I really wanted to like this Vivitulip Casual Shirt.  It looked so cute in the picture and I love the pink/grey color combination.  It's so soft and comfy and the fit is true to size.  The problem is - it just doesn't look good on me:(.  The  color block change line hits me at exactly the wrong place.  Unfortunately, the color change is right in the middle of my chest!  If the color change was about 3 inches higher or lower, it would be fine.  Sigh!  So, I've actually been wearing this shirt as a pajama or lounge top with sweatpants.  It' s just so comfy! I'll keep looking for another shirt by this brand, maybe of a solid color this time."
4.0,Tabs are cute
4.0,"The sweaters material wasn’t very comfy but it seemed warm. The bottom color looks black in person and it doesn’t match well with the pattern in my opinion.  Ordered a small and I’m usually a large. Fit great. If you want oversize, definitely order your regular size."
4.0,My son loves his and tests the waterproof since he will take baths with it.
4.0,"Beautiful blouse, but the front little buttons had to go into little WHITE elastic loops to close the front. Not only did the white show and look tacky, but it didn't even stay fastened. I cut the elastic loops off then sewed the opening shut, leaving the buttons as decorative only. now I love it!"
4.0,I ordered a 16w and I was sent a regular 16. I tried it on and it fit so I kept it.
4.0,Ordered<br />A size larger than normal<br />Size. Still too tight. Shoes too narrow. Shirt too slim fitting. Nice quality and good customer service but will be returning.
4.0,"Good compression, will make you very warm in summer time if you need to wear them. Perfect for fall and winter time. I would recommend!"
4.0,After a few washes stretches out. If purchasing another will get smaller size.
4.0,Love it and so comfortable.
4.0,"Nice dress. Well made. But too large in the bodice, under the arms, and too long for a petite woman. Loved the color, but had to send it back."
4.0,"Cute, but they pill a bit the first few times you wear them (left little fuzzies on my outfit)"
4.0,Lovely would buy again.
4.0,"This hat is quite nice... it folds up really well, and the bill is nice and large so it really blocks my entire face from the sun.  It fits a bit large for me, but I have a tiny head.  It does a good job of cooling off my forehead when I sweat!  I actually end up getting it wet before a run on a really hot day, and it keeps my head nice and cool.  Overall, I love the hat!"
4.0,"This a great watch, very good design, and great price. I did have an issue that I contacted the supplier regarding and I was so surprised to get an immediate response and the issue is currently being addressed as promised. I do recommend and will update the review once finalized.<br /><br />*** Update ***<br />Contacting the supplier worked out perfectly and I'm very happy with this transaction. Awesome watch and very stylish. Great transaction!"
4.0,Pretty 1 piece dress but was too small in the chest and under arm area.
4.0,It does seem to make it  feel  cooler
4.0,It's one size too small but it fits pretty well so I'm not going to return it. I'll just have to lose weight LOL
4.0,"The fit is flattering, but I only wish it would be just a little longer, like right above the belly button would be perfect."
4.0,"I'm not sure how long this band will last but for the price, its worth it. Easy to put change bands and easy to put on. very comfortable."
4.0,"Fits nice, kinda square up top, figured it would be a slouch hat."
4.0,I love these so much. But I can’t get them to stay on my ear
4.0,Was a little small compared to another Red Cap shirt I bought before.It did shrink some even though I washed it in cold water.Still I good shirt.
4.0,Great sunglasses and cutest case. My daughter loves them.
4.0,"It's a little clunky to get on the controller, but it's fine once it's on."
4.0,It was not the style that I expect. It won't work for me but it was well made. I returned it.
4.0,"I really like how comfortable it is. Lightweight, yet pretty warm, and it seems like its well constructed. The zipper snags a little, but nothing serious. I'm 6'6"" 280 lbs.  I must confess that I was hoping it had a little more room, but it fits. It's not the jacket's fault as I usually wear a 3XL long, and the biggest they had was a 2XL long. Took a chance anyway.  It fits, and it will work for what I bought it for, but if it just had a little more room through the shoulders and chest it would be perfect.  The sizing in the mid-section, neck size (19) , and overall length in the sleeves and torso is ok.  I'm a hard man to buy clothes for anyway.  It's still a keeper.  By the way,  the strip of whatever you call what they use to hem the bottom of the torso really lends itself to installing a 1/8"" shock-cord to the fleece. It's kind of a hollow tube and 1/8"" fits perfectly. Those of you complaining about this jacket not having  a way to cinch the bottom and keep the heat in can pretty easily add one if you have any paracord skills at all.  It's not hard to do at all and just takes a little patience.  Shock-cord...cord locks....Boom. Perfect."
4.0,"The bifocal works great, when working in my shop no need to keep taking them off and on."
4.0,"The quality was good. The fit was good but I had issues with the cut and material. The top is low on the hips. The material is very light; too light for me. They are vary revealing. If you want to show off your junk, these are great. I’m too modest to wear them in public without a long shirt over"
4.0,As pictured but really heavy.
4.0,"Though  it was black but came in blue.  Still really pretty, but is not pleated like in the picture, but it is flowy. Ordered in my normal size for great."
4.0,"Nice fit. Thin material which is fine for working out. Wrinkles for days, though."
4.0,"Nice boots, but had to send back, sent wrong size!!!"
4.0,Pretty but runs a lot smaller. I went up a size and it's skin tight. I'd suggest going up at least two sizes for fitted. More if you want room.
4.0,Like the size and the quantity of things it holds
4.0,"I love these earrings, I forget that I'm even wearing them, they're so light. However, like other reviews, I wish the pattern was on both sides. They flip/turn a lot and it'd be nice if the design was on both sides."
4.0,"Ok. I’m still debating how I feel about this shirt. I love the cut of it. Yes the previous reviews say the arm holes are big but that’s the design of the shirt and I like the design. Material is thin, but good quality. Supposed to be thin.  My only complaint is I wish it were a few inches longer. It looks great when your not moving, but once you put your arms up it’s a belly shirt. So unless you have six pack abs or a super toned mid section I wouldn’t buy. I am 6ft and have a longer mid section so it maybe it would be fine a shorter people. I still like the shirt and will wear it on runs. But not sure I would order another."
4.0,"House Shoes But I am wearing these everywhere, very comfy. I wish they had 1/2 sizes.<br />I do love them"
4.0,better than one I previously bought
4.0,Love this shirt !!! Thank you
4.0,"Good price, decent product and they work!  It's hard to hold on to mittens with little ones!  These are a good price, the style is the same so I don't feel awful when I mix and match colors because I can't find one or the other and they fit my 18 month old very well.  They are made of a thin fabric so they are not good for extreme cold but they are perfect for a car ride."
4.0,its ok more for people with I pad I think
4.0,"I want to start by saying the company is amazing. I got the wrong size and they automatically sent me the correct one. The shirt fits as expected and is not thin contrary to other reviews. It is a normal shirt fabric, not a sweater lol. Yes the shipping took a little over a week but that was noted and it should not have been expected to get here sooner."
4.0,"These are tight fitting without being overly tight! Would like if they were somewhat longer, but maybe they would constrict vessels behind the knee.(?)"
4.0,It is good and fits my feet well. Good so far . No issues
4.0,"Well, I bought this organizer thinking I would make do till I could get one that I liked better. But having used it for a few weeks, it's relly better than I thought it would be. I didn't like the way opened but have since made it work for me better than I thought it would. The seller was very prompt in getting it shipped out. I wanted one where the long side bottom did not zip and the two short sides opened, or opened up and down instead of side to side."
4.0,Like the shirt very much. Larger than expected. Think they run large.
4.0,Durable band. Great price!
4.0,"I expected this to be a full 360 deg crown but really it's just the front section attached to an elastic strap that goes around the back of a child's head. My daughter didn't know the difference and loved it anyway, but a more complete set of photos would be appreciated."
4.0,Worked perfect to size hats
4.0,Perfect grab and go sandal. However the bottoms are quite heavy and took my little one some time to get used to.
4.0,"The only  reason why I didn't rate as 5 stars is the glasses seem very delicate. Not sturdy at all, I'm afraid I will break them."
4.0,"I think that the bra is very nice, but my granddaughter prefers the nylon blend sports bras.  I think that it is a matter of getting used to a bra."
4.0,"Surprisingly impressed,definitely better looking than the price."
4.0,"The material is great, the fleece on the inside is soft and keep your head warm. Over all nice hat. The scarf is interesting. If you have a big neck it is to tight. Even if you have a ""normal"" neck it is not really comfortable to where. Instead of wearing it as a scarf I wear it as a open hat.<br />I would buy the hat hat but not the scarf thing."
4.0,"Sturdy ring with good craftsmanship, doesn't look exactly like the picture. Only dislike is it is extremely bulky, the top of the skull protrudes out ALOT."
4.0,Used for a dress up day at school and fit kindergartner perfectly.
4.0,Really like the material and color
4.0,"work great, soccer player loves them."
4.0,"The embroidered colors are brighter than I expected. The threads are hot magenta and cobalt, and I was hoping for deeper jewel tones, thinking I saw deep red (ruby) and sapphire blue. I kept it because it's unique. I'll get used to the brighter colors :)"
4.0,Nice top. I think it is juniors. Got a 2x and it flows nicely— just right. Would recommend going up two sizes for nice fit.
4.0,Worked well for what it was intended. Didn't turn skin green.
4.0,"Super cute earrings.  Worn once so far, and a little heavy.  Love them!"
4.0,"Great and used, only issue is the threader so to speak, already getting weakened but otherwise great"
4.0,"Loved the style and the fit is, for once, perfect. I'm quite petite and it's always a struggle to find anything adult looking that fits. This t-shirt fits like a petite glove."
4.0,"I love this top! It is more of a top than a &#34;sweater&#34; and  the sizing is more of a junior sizing than women's. I ordered the medium (36D,29&#34; waist) and it fits perfect. I wear medium in junior tops and small on women's sizing. But I definitely recommend this knit top. I took one star off because it is 100% viscose (rayon) not cotton/wool as described."
4.0,"Nice quality, comfortable fit. I would typically take L, but size chart said XL so I went with that. It was the right choice. Fabric is comfortable, not see through. Pocket is narrow, so my larger phone only went in 1/2 way, but was secure. Treadmill and machines went great!"
4.0,Fit as expected. Perfect for gym etc
4.0,Perfect for spring hikes
4.0,Good socks for lighter compression.  Feels great and my legs aren't as tired at the end of the day
4.0,"Not bad, for the price. Fairly sturdy and does the job. nice size and they don't stretch out too much."
4.0,"I love it, but I'll have to shorten it."
4.0,She hasn't used them much but I think they'll help.
4.0,"I went up in size, bought the 2x [dresses run small- i'm 5'4&#34; & normally use XL]. Love the pattern an length of the dress!!"
4.0,"Very cute dress, but skirt is little heavy to me."
4.0,"Somewhat large but with heavy socks , perfect. Like walking in your slippers"
4.0,A little better than Decent quality ! I like my shirts to be a little heavier but it fits well and didn't shrink like crazy .
4.0,"Ordered the XL and I am 200lbs and 5’7” and it falls past my ankles to rest just nicely on top of my feet. I find the straps a bit too wide (kind of matronly) and the neck high cut. I can see why so many pregnant women like this dress. The material is kind of like bathing suit material. So, while I will wear this, I will look for a cotton or jersey version with more narrow straps and more low cut."
4.0,Runs small. Awesome shirt if it fit.
4.0,Aceptables gafas
4.0,"belt is sturdy, if I had to be picky, I would say it is a little too thick. But works well and stays in place"
4.0,I love the material!! My daughter loves it. I will say the shirt fit her really right and the pants super loose. So I’m not sure if it’s correct sizing. But over all I still love it and we make it work!
4.0,"Neck and Chest area a little tight, but with some tugging and pulling it loosens up some and fits good. Cute under blue jean jacket and some boots.  I ordered a XL and my chest is 38 c"
4.0,"This product, when ordered, came for me way before it said, which was good!  But... The face is asymmetrical and the eyes are somewhat scary.  The silver finish comes off in three days of wearing it.  The ears are almost bigger than the head.  I will still wear it, but... I don't recommend it."
4.0,"This glasses are beautiful, I really loved them they are so simple and look great !! My only issue was that I ordered them in grey but I received them in brown. I decided to keep them because they still look great and I was in need of my glasses soon..."
4.0,A very comfortable and nice looking sweater. The edges roll  back around neck and down the front but looks as if it is supposed to be this way.
4.0,"These we purchase for my husband whose hobby is sports officiating.  They torn the first time he pulled them on.  He wore them anyway since it was not in the foot region.  Overall, he liked the comfort and feel of the socks."
4.0,Nice but has a little snag defect at waist seam.  I can fix it or cover it with a jacket.
4.0,For me it was a bit tight in the waist
4.0,child loves them
4.0,"Removing the links is not so easy. a tool is provided but no instructions so, you have to figure out how it works. But, the band is metal and i like it with it's clasp.<br />Because, it is metal, it pulls the watch portion away from the charging base. The band is heavier than the magnet can hold the unit to the charging base"
4.0,Seems good so far. Easy to install but seems a little thin for a mens band.
4.0,"I like this vest, just wish it was longer. I'm 5'11&#34;.<br />The craftsmanship is great and I love the color combinations it comes in. It's perfect that it is reversable. Solid purchase for me!"
4.0,good quality. pretty​ & deep color
4.0,"It’s beautiful and I love the appearance but it’s slightly snug on my larger wrist. It won’t seem to stretch out either. If your looking for that, here you go! I know my sister has a hard time finding smaller ones that don’t stretch out on her so I will likely pass this on to her."
4.0,Nice quality jewelry and chain. Wasn’t able to get hardly any ashes into the jewelry. My husband and I did 18 different piece of jewelry.
4.0,received item fast - item as expected.  Not the greatest quality but effective and as stated in the description.  Great price for four!
4.0,I had to cut the belt due to being too big. I did not like the fact that it started to unravel on the end that was cut.
4.0,My wife thinks it’s beautiful.
4.0,"Nice fabric, Don't need the cufflinks but they came together as a set."
4.0,"Paired the skirt with a different shirt but still so cute. Nothing wrong with the shirt it came with, just liked how this looked better."
4.0,I do really like these earrings. I thought from the photo that they might have been a bit larger. I still love wearing them.
4.0,The dress is quite nice. My first clothes purchase on Amazon. I’m not disappointed whatsoever. The flower on the side isn’t as vibrant as pictured but that’s a minor detail. I’m very pleased with my new dress!
4.0,This mask is very pretty but runs small which makes it right on my face.  Would it buy if you have a round face.
4.0,"Very cute.  The &#34;metal&#34; part is pretty flimsy and the color screams fake, but they are still cute.  Super light weight.  I can wear them all day with no issues."
4.0,A bit small but I can still wear it.
4.0,Brought it from my mom and she loved it
4.0,Fit as expected! I'm always looking for a good sports bra with thicker straps especially in the back and these fit the bill!! Really glad I purchased them.
4.0,"A bold and wonderfully strong ring design, that speaks of strength and charm. I love this!"
4.0,"This is a wonderful ponytail headband for running, walking or hiking on a cold day. The fleece material is soft and absorbent and keeps the ears warm.<br /><br />The downside for me is that the headband covers too much area on my head and sticks out a little on top. My head may be smaller than some as I use small settings on hats and I have fine hair. In my case, it is a challenge to make my hair look good in this headband, but the great thing is that it covers so much I can just put my hair in a ponytail then go.<br /><br />The other slight downside is that the material covers my ears. This is both a plus and a minus. It is a plus since it keeps my ears warm. It is a minus since it slightly muffles sound -- nowhere near as much as a pair of headphones or earbuds would though. Sadly, I want to use both headphones and the headband. I only recommend that if on a running track or other safe environment -- never running or walking on a street!<br /><br />I do love how warm and cozy this headband is for outdoor activities. It is especially useful on those chilly mornings! I also love that it accommodates a ponytail.<br /><br />I received this headband free to review. All opinions and experiences described are my own."
4.0,"The necklace was as expected, however the card inserted was supposed to say To My Boyfriend, instead I was sent the one that said To My Husband. It was a Father's Day gift, so I was disappointed it didn't have the correct card included."
4.0,needs a better snap button besides that a great pant
4.0,Attractive practicle
4.0,Good protection. Needed to sand down some of the outer ridges as they are quite sharp and pointy.
4.0,"I got this as a Christmas present for my friend. He loves it, but it would be a little small for me. Not many pockets. But it looks very nice and feels solid."
4.0,Great design great fit as described comfortable to wear only downfall you can't wear this dress and others like it from the same manufacturer because you can see directly through
4.0,Its very nice and strong really colorful the wrist cord could be longer so to fit on the wrist
4.0,These shirts feel great on my body and especially while working out. My only complaint  is the body length is not what I expected but  other than that the shirts feel great
4.0,I really like the size of the bag. Its perfect for me. I don't like a really big purse. I washed it and it came out great. The material is a little stiff but sturdy.
4.0,I pants are comfy and warm. But I would order a size bigger next time.
4.0,"Attractive, fits nice. The leather band screws come loose. But jewelry screwdriver tighten it back up. Enjoy the change. Have to take it off to wash dishes and shower only draw back. Still enjoying it though"
4.0,Beautiful ring.  Need a second one as my niece is wearing the original.
4.0,"The dress fits well and I love the color. Haven’t washed it yet so I don’t know if it will shrink. Four stars because the photo they used is obviously stolen. I expected the dress to be sewn together do that the slit in the front formed naturally, like a wrap dress. However as you can see in my second picture they just cut a gap out of the front of the dress. I’m 5’2” 130lb and bought a size small."
4.0,"I originally bought this because I thought that it would keep my hair oil from soiling my pillow but it didn’t. However it did maintain my hair style so I guess I have to figure out which is more important, hair style or pillowcase."
4.0,Hot outfit for heating up the room wife likes I love it....
4.0,Run a little bit smaller than expected
4.0,"Beautiful colors and very soft but small. The pictures make it look at least as long as all of my other scarves I have.... Each end barely goes to my mid stomach when hanging around my neck and my torso isn't longer than average. So there is no wrapping it like I normally do. I will definitely make it work and just learn to wear it a bit different, but I wish it had been the typical large blanket scarf.<br /><br />The photo where just my neck is showing is the scarf hanging around my neck. The other one is with the opposite corners softly tied and tucked behind my neck."
4.0,Goes well with my drag costumes!
4.0,"Well, this dress is super comfortable but just kind of hangs like an oversized tee. Maybe would have liked a vet neck style better. Colorful and great for lounging."
4.0,I love this watch! For the price the quality was better then I thought it would be.  Only problem is the band is tight i have ot put an extra hole for it to be comfortable
4.0,"It's ok. Low price so no big expectations. It's pretty, but if you are well endowed like me, not really much for support. Does look nice peeking out under a top."
4.0,"This necklace is really cool, great statement piece. Wore for a Vintage Circus Gala. A little bit oversized for my taste, but I'm a tiny person at 5'2&#34;<br /><br />Necklace stays on straight but does make a clanking noise with body movement. Still a great purchase!"
4.0,I had to return this shirt for one size larger than I normally wear.
4.0,"I have not actually had the opportunity to use this poncho as yet but it seems to be made out of a soft yet sturdy plastic.  It does not rustle when you move.  It has a strange shape (see photo) but it looks OK on.  I like the closable neck opening and drawstring hood, as well as the fact that there is elastic at the wrists.  I think it will work well.  If it doesn't, I will revisit this review and amend accordingly."
4.0,These gloves are fabulous. I got so manny compliment. Very fashionable. And they looked real good. They made the occasion. Love them.
4.0,"I like this dress a lot, and it worked perfectly for my medusa halloween costume. I am a size 14/16 and ordered a 3X. It's just slightly big enough to not be clingy, but it's a loose fitted dress. Be sure that you size up in this dress. I ordered the 3X in hopes of it fitting loosely like in the photo, but it doesn't sadly. Either way, it works and is beautiful!"
4.0,"This was the prefect item to snuggle into while sitting on the deck this past weekend at Buckhorn State Park, in Kentucky. The mornings were on are the cooler side (54 degrees) for this time of year. This kept me warm, without over heating, while I cross stitched and sipped coffee.<br /><br />It fit as expected and received several comments (some sarcastic but always positive). It is very smooth and soft...without shedding everywhere."
4.0,stylish dress
4.0,Super cute. Very thin material but will work for Halloween!
4.0,Nicely made item for the price.
4.0,Love these cute penguins they go with different outfits
4.0,It got to me in 9 days! They're a little see through though :l
4.0,"Price is right, water resistance, durability and tool access out weigh the weight of bag. Good for outdoor workers."
4.0,"it is really cute, almost too small even though i ordered a size bigger, love that it has pockets."
4.0,"I've purchased many of these dresses in the past, all the same size, but this one seems to run one size smaller than the rest. It's either that or I was sent the wrong size, even though it says the right size on the tag. Now I'm wondering if I'm going to get a smaller sizer the next time I buy one..."
4.0,satisfied!
4.0,wore it on my anniversary. it fits perfect
4.0,"Used for fishing, fit well and comfortable"
4.0,The blouse fits well a 3months old baby. But the short is a little bit large.
4.0,"I thought this was a pink dress with white details, but turns out the pattern is blue, not white. Got this for my mom and it fit as expected, although it is (not surprisingly) too long for her 5'0&#34; frame. She says it is very comfortable and even though it is a little long, she wears it often. Good quality for the price."
4.0,"The dress is cute and comfortable, but the side seam that comes up under the arm ends up sticking out just a little bit at the top of it. If I was a seamstress I would take it in a little right in that spot. Not enough of an issue to dissuade me from keeping the dress, though."
4.0,Worth noting that it doesn't actually wrap--the top just looks wrapped. Fits a little tighter than expected.
4.0,"The print on this is adorable.  As prior reviewers mentioned, the material is flimsy, but not so thin that a slip is needed.  White underwear will work fine.  I ordered a Medium.  I'm 5'8.5"", 120#.  Chest=36, Waist=29, Hips=38.  The fit was good, I just wish it was longer.  I prefer dresses that go below the knee to mid-calf, but I love Halloween & this dress is the spirit of it!  I haven't washed it yet; if it holds up well, I may order more from this manufacturer."
4.0,good quality. wife says they fit well. a little small. order a size up
4.0,"I followed the reviews and size chart. Right now I'm wearing a size 8, so I ordered 44. Might have fit a 42, but it does fit and is comfortable. It doesn't have a lot of boob support if you have above a C, but it will work. It's cute on! It is blue with light blue dots."
4.0,Soooo pretty. One of my chains broke but that's a pretty fix. It's still beautiful. I plan on buying another.
4.0,"I just received the hat today and was pleasantly surprised.  A good value for the price.<br /><br />Helpful hints:<br />-Make sure you select the right color along with the “with feather” or “without feather” style as illustrated in the Amazon product photos.<br />- I think I must have a big head so I typically by large size hats. I bought the XL size and it fits perfectly.<br />- A nice fun hat. Not for wearing to any formal event because of the quality (it is a straw hat after all) but perfect for recreation, beach, park, etc. or just hanging out.<br />- The ribbon around the hat does not detach; at least not easily. It is glued on to the hat in spots. So, you can remove it if desired but obviously at the expensive of the glue connection.<br />- The plastic stitching in the straw has a slight sparkle to it if light reflects off of it. I personally wasn’t crazy about that feature so it may be something to consider. That sparkle does not show as much in the Amazon product pictures online but it is noticeable in the actual product if reflecting light.. (See the picture I attached to this review)<br /><br />Overall, I like the hat and I am satisfied with the purchase. I rated it 4 Stars instead of 5 Stars only because of that sparkle thing. But that’s just me. Other than that, it’s great. I appreciate that Amazon offered the variety of selections. This style of hat is hard to find at those prices."
4.0,"This product is very adorable and the size S fits as expected. The elastic waistband keeps them up with no problem. However, there are two flaws: first, since the title says &#34;Running,&#34; I expected there to be some spandex/compression &#34;shine&#34; to them (as I thought was depicted), but there isn't any; it's just matte fabric. Second, due to the way the pattern is cut/sewn, the two diagonal black cats in the center make a giant &#34;V&#34; shape right in a certain...&#34;V&#34;... anatomical area, which looks really embarrassing, particularly because it stands out as the only black on the pants. It's kind of like having a giant arrow outlining your camel-toe. Sorry, just fair warning! They should change the cut there. Other than that, it's an awesomely cute whimsical design that is very lightweight and comfortable for any crazy cat lady. But due to the issues I mentioned, will probably only wear them lounging around the house. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Fabric is soft,  style is comfortable. Was too small for me. Gave it to my daughter."
4.0,"you cant beat the price on this! it came on time, great condition. my only issue was the battery seem to go pretty fast, but that's definitely something I can get past."
4.0,"Overall, not a bad watch.  The band color is pretty vibrant, and it works as it should.<br /><br />It is certainly good for its price; my only complaint is that the band stitching isn't all that great.  I bought this as a gift, but when I first received it, the stitching on one side of part of the band had already come apart.  It was easy to repair, but it's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a more durable watch."
4.0,"Item:  SNUGWIND Women's Casual V Neck Sleeveless Tank Top Long Pant Romper<br /><br />My wife is a busty 5’-4” and in a very similar ‘romper outfit’ ordered an XL and hit it out of the park on the fit. But with the Snugwind romper, she also ordered XL and it was too large. Her comment was, I should have ordered the Large. She’s usually pretty saavy in intuitively judging the fit on certain ‘types’ of outfits, pants or tops. In this case she granted herself too much of a safety margin. She's still judging about 85% correct on most clothing orders. Can't win them all."
4.0,"This bag is great for keys, phone and glasses. It is lightweight and well made. But the brown look so much nicer on the screen. It is a very dark, unattractive brown. I would pick another color unless it is for a guy."
4.0,"Its smaller than i imagined, roughly the size of  a dime. it does look exactly as pictured. Very unique piece."
4.0,"Bracelet is great but the images show like if it was a different type of polish, more like satin but in fact it is a high polish mirror finish. Still very happy with it and it's very comfortable."
4.0,seem like a sturdy product and shape the wife really well
4.0,"Overall look great, feel well made. Only thing is they're just slightly lighter in color and heavier than I expected."
4.0,"I normally wear a medium because I don't like things too tight but i purchased this shirt in a small because i know it's meant to be long and it fits like i wanted it to! The quality is fine, lays nice. It was a good buy!"
4.0,"I really love this cover up. It’s breezy and cute and adds a nice touch to a plain outfit. I took off one star for the fit of the sleeve - while it fits great when my arms are down at my sides, when I reach for things in front of me it gets VERY tight. I would recommend sizing up at least one size, if not two if you plan to try to do things while wearing this."
4.0,Nice large green stone
4.0,"It's nice, but the color is not as dark as shown in the photo."
4.0,The shoe looks beautiful but the right shoe is lose and squeaks loudly.  I'd love to know how to fix it.
4.0,Love this T-shirt. Have a thing for giraffes so that’s why I ordered it. It fits great. Not tight fitting or snug at all. A large is what I wear and that is what I ordered. I find it to be spot on.
4.0,With my long legs ... These jeans are so comfortable and they FIT!!!
4.0,"a little tight at the top, but it help the socks stay up."
4.0,Do not like bell bottoms! Too long! Having them taken up!
4.0,i purchased them for my husband for his elaborate shoe collection he was so suprised that i found em online which was cheaper (thank you) he fixed every pair of shoes in 3 days he couldnt be more happier with your item thanx again will be buying more for his unfixed shoes
4.0,A great purse for the price.I clean perfect for everyday use
4.0,"I bought one of these to try them out, and I was glad I did. The fabric is nice and light - perfect for working out, and the cutaways at the arm holes are really great (beats grungy T-shirt pits!). However, I decided I didn't like the high neckline in the front - I would have preferred something a bit more scooped out in front, as the front of the shirt by the neckline was drenched by the end of my workout. That could be my personal preference, though, so don't let it put you off! I'll keep wearing this shirt, but will order a different one next time."
4.0,"The dress is just as pictures, ordered it in my normal XL  size it fits perfectly except in the chest. It buttons up, but pulls a bit across my breasts. Besides that it's very well made, very nice material and sewn wonderfully."
4.0,For $10 for a pair of polarized sunglasses?  Why not!
4.0,I use these gloves for cleaning and they work very well.
4.0,It took 4 months for them to arrive but they were beautiful. One broke a year later because it was stepped on so now I'm looking to purchase a new pair
4.0,"Ordered Brown F2252 and hat came very nicely package. Not bent or creased. It seriously looks and feels more expensive than it is. It's listed to fit up to 23.5&#34; and fit very snug on my 22.75&#34; head. This snug fit worked out as it held up nicely in the wind. I will be purchasing another in a different color, so nice!"
4.0,The suspenders are good quality. After use for awhile I may think differently.We'll see how the clips hold up.<br />H W Foster
4.0,Nothing fancy but a great dress for throwing on in the summer. I would suggest sizing down at least 1 size.
4.0,"Seems to be thinning with every wash, have had for about year, and was great price, so would buy again"
4.0,"Great color, light fabric was perfect for a hot day. However the garment was shorter than expected. It did not cover my legs as I had thought it would."
4.0,"It’s very pretty though a little flimsier than I expected... but for the price, it’s nice."
4.0,bought to replace an 18 inch chain
4.0,Very cute! Beautiful purple color. The embroidery is very well done. The flowers are more beige and green than bronze but the colors are complimentary and the contrast is still quite lovely.
4.0,"I’m 5’7, 12lbs, the small fits perfectly. I did however have to wear a nude color shaper underneath because the dress is a tad see through."
4.0,Good quality but runs very small and my little guy is already small for his age.
4.0,"The dress hugs the body very well. At $18, my husband is very happy about how it looks."
4.0,Exactly as advertised and perfect for a little black dress.
4.0,It looks really good. I love it bt am waiting to see how it will be when sweat hits it. Hopefully it doesn’t change at all or change to quickly.
4.0,"I'm writing a thorough review because I know I love thorough reviews!<br /><br />I am 5'6&#34;, 28&#34; waist, today I am 152 pounds but I fluctuate all the way up to 155, and I was sized for a 32D bra at Victoria's Secret. I am at that place where I can usually wear anything medium or small, depending on the manufacturing of the clothing, so I wear both but usually small. After reading the reviews, I originally ordered a medium in this dress, to be safe. I found the medium was quite big on me! It wasn't terrible - I could wear it if I needed to, but the waist especially had a ton of room. You can see both how roomy it is and how stretchy the material is, which was nice. But I knew I would need a small. So I ordered a small, and that fit was a little tighter, but more to my liking. I will say that to get into the small at first was kind of a production. It zipped, but it took about five minutes of jumping up and down and trying to make sure I didn't bust any seams. That's part of why I'm not wearing a bra with the small, and I probably won't when I wear it out, either. However, once I had it on I was really pleased with the look. I'm going to return the medium and keep the small.<br /><br />CONS: The thing that bothers me the most about the small dress is the arms. My underarm/boob fat shows VERY noticeably. I included a picture of what the fat looks like if I just relax my arm normally, and what it looks like when I try to keep my arm tense and eliminate the fat. I'm going to either keep my hair down or wear a shawl over the dress to hide it. The other thing that bothers me about BOTH dresses is the chest area. The stitching is a little weird on the neckline. You can see how it won't lay flat on either dress. It's not enough to make me return the small, but it does look weird. But there was plenty of room for my boobs, as long as I didn't wear a bra with the small one. In the medium I labeled which pictures I wore a bra and which I didn't, just to show what that looked like.<br /><br />PROS: Nice fabric. Long enough (just past my knees on the small). The color and pattern are really cute. Maybe it's just because I have a pretty big butt and hips, but I don't feel like I even remotely need a petticoat with this. If I did it would look too poofy. I feel like the skirt is definitely flared enough. It's not thin fabric to me. And the small makes my boobs look huge! A+++<br /><br />I'm wearing this for a short film set in the 50s I'm shooting, and I can definitely see myself wearing it again for a cute Halloween thing or something. Overall, I'd say if you're just a little bigger than me, I'd be safe and go with the medium. I'm happy with the small. ☺️"
4.0,"I love them , they do are polarized , great for going to the beach and not wanting to take your expensive glasses afraid of loosing them, material feels cheap but what do you expect for $10 dlls"
4.0,Perfect for the holidays!
4.0,Super disappointed in the product quality. Broke the first time I wore it when my baby gently tugged on it.
4.0,Very upset I was given to letter Fs the E was missing I tried to return it but I consisted of to much for me
4.0,"Arrived very quickly, appears to bee good quality material. Little strange beautiful blue top and black bottom.<br /><br />I ordered XXL.<br />The bottom fit size 12 perfectly.<br /><br />The Top is NOT designed for large breasted women.<br />5'6"" 180 (40 DD) the cup shape was small and didn't have enough room for the girls....."
4.0,"July 17 update-After my initial review the company reached out and indicated that they had had some issues and a redesign took effect-actually even a better look and again the length was perfect! However again the width was just as bad, I measured them and both the older pair and the new ones are on the high side of a C width or low D width. Normally I wear a high D width and E size is fine also. I added an extra ⭐️ back because of their customer service and I provided them the information above and they asked me to please post the update-pretty awesome compared to other companies I’ve dealt with. If you have narrow feet then this is a great shoe at a great price and length is perfect but if your foot is mid D width or above then expect to go barefoot and even then it will be tight.<br /><br />They look really nice and length fit fine. But after a month and no stretch in toe width area - brutal with thin socks, unbearable with thick socks. I go barefoot with them on and can do short walks after I blistered the sides of toes-need to be a lot wider to get a extra stars from me but if you have a narrow narrow foot I think you might like them."
4.0,Got a large and it fits nicely for girls size 10.
4.0,"Good quality gloves,will probably last a long time. I wear a size 8 and that’s what I bought.seem a little large to me maybe like 8.5.left hand a little larger than right,but I do like them."
4.0,"I read the other reviews that said to buy a size up, but I wish I hadn't because it would fit better with my normal size. Other than that it's great."
4.0,"Overall, it fits, but is much shorter than I would like. I do have a long torso, though."
4.0,"I wear it all the time. The chakra colors are glued on and I accidentally ordered two and one looked great, the other wasn't straight. I don't mind too much. It's a nice weighted stone, the chain is nice too."
4.0,"I was very impressed with this bag and grow more so daily. Although the leather is not THE top of the line (hence the four rather than five stars) it is a nice, pebbled leather and EXCELLENT for the price; actually pretty rich looking. The top-handle style is right on trend and the two sides are capable of holding more than you would think at a glance, all without looking too bulge-y and misshapen. As other reviewers noted, the detachable shoulder strap is rather long but I found a work-around for that by buckling it into the last hole then tucking the excess in. I initially secured it with a completely unnoticeable black rubber just to ""train"" it to stay, and have had no issues with it once I removed it. The only other reason I deducted a star is because the top-handle, when sitting unused, leans a little as if it was crushed in shipping, but this is completely unapparent when holding it by the handle - which I do because I prefer using the handle rather than the shoulder strap. I have used this bag every single day since it arrived on 30 January 2019, and it still looks almost brand new! If like I, you are financially unable to invest in a higher end bag, I totally recommend that you purchase this one!"
4.0,Hubby finds these comfy and more like a boxer with the soft fabric he says does not bunch up.
4.0,"This is an attractive and classy watch.  Both the watch case and the strap are an authentically &#34;rose&#34; color.  The watch body and face are smaller than many smartwatches, making it not stand out like some of the larger versions.  A woman could easily wear this watch.  The information on the screen is still very legible despite the smaller size. It handles call info, texts, emails, calendar events, etc., like most smartwatches.  The watch comes with 8 Skagen watch faces to use, but you can also use faces from the Google Play store by using the search function on the watch.  As advertised, this watch does last longer than other smartwatches.  My previous watch would occasionally get down into the 9% range by evening.  This watch is still at 48% when I'm going to bed.  Nice.<br /><br />The only &#34;cons&#34; for this watch so far are a) that it has no speaker in it, so if you want to use the watch as a timer or alarm, it will only vibrate, b) it took a looong time for it to initially download the new Android Wear OS and programs (I'd recommend charging it up full and just leaving it on near wi-fi  until it finishes its business), and c) you'll probably need to go to the SKAGEN webpage that describes how to adjust the length of the band before you can wear it.  No instructions in the box.<br /><br />PS: be sure to watch the animation on the screen when you plug it in to charge up!"
4.0,"I usually take a small, this PJ should be xsmall"
4.0,"Dress would fit a medium to large. I am 5'2, 127 lbs and this dress is loose on me. I usually wear a small and this is definitely a size medium. It's comfy, though and will be good for the celestial party I am attending."
4.0,Nice tie. Good for special occasions and entertainment events. A bit showy for business but that's an opinion from a fairly conservative dresser.
4.0,They feel very comfortable.
4.0,"I actually bought these for work.  I work in a refrigerated environment, where I must lift and open boxes, so I needed something to shield my hands while working between 35-45 degrees, with good grip to lift from pallets and shelves.  These fit the bill.  If you need a true winter glove (i.e. below freezing, these might not be warm enough for you) but they were great to wear for my needs!  Fit is nice and close, not baggy, looks nice on the hand."
4.0,My fault being so over weight!  This shirt in a 3x looks like a tent.  But it fits and I’ll keep it.
4.0,"Dainty, nice piece. Small and perfect for a child or someone who likes small pieces. Middle of cross is not a stone, just small ball bump."
4.0,"All of them came in and werent broken, so thats great! But some of the beads on the rings were a little mis-shapen, but that didnt effect whether or not my friends loved them!"
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous, especially for the price. This will be great to wear to work. It fits like a glove and really shows off your curves, while still looking very classy! My only complaint is it's a bit longer than I would prefer, but if you're taller this may not be an issue. For reference I'm 5'4&#34; and 135lbs and the medium fits great!"
4.0,Fits looser than expected but super cute. Lots of compliments
4.0,"They would probably been better if my legs were thinner, but I was able to wear them and they stayed up."
4.0,A little big but still a very cute dress.
4.0,"Neckline larger than I would like but okay for home wear. Fabric light and soft, very comfortable."
4.0,The silicon isn't as thick as my Qualo so these have stretched out faster. But I'd rather buy another 6 pack of these for a fraction of 1 Qualo.
4.0,"I must admit I missed the title specifying it was just a green watchband that I would receive, instead of the colours in the first pic, so look out for that one.<br /><br />Outside of that, the watchband is a lovely aquamarine and fits my ID107Plus HR perfectly! Very solid and feels even more reinforced than the band that came with the watch itself. I can't wait to start wearing it again!"
4.0,"Slightly small as the shoulder seams fit too low on the shoulder like a garment that is too baggy, but it's not. Otherwise it's beautiful and fits well."
4.0,"The suit is very comfortable, and stretchy. Very nice!"
4.0,"Band fits watch perfectly, but was a little big on my wrist"
4.0,"Nice, but I got an XL and it fits like a short L."
4.0,"This was my first septum jewelry other than my horse shoe. Since its so tiny, it was difficult to put in. Unlocking it and taking it out was even trickier without hurting my nose. But after the first time, I learned how to manage it. That being said, it's a beautiful piece and fairly comfortable."
4.0,I didn’t like writing on rubber
4.0,It's bigger then I thought it would be and nicer.
4.0,"These are actually really great! I was hesitant, but ended up ordering one for everyone!"
4.0,"The bra was good only issue is one had no pads in it, I didn’t care cause I don’t like the padding and throw it out, boxes were in poor shape as well"
4.0,"I love it, it's just the right size with plenty of card slots and lots of space. The zipper sticks a little."
4.0,It is perfect size for a child.
4.0,"I loved the socks in general. They made my feet more comfortable and I was able to work my 10 hour shift with much less discomfort and swelling. The only thing that still bothers my toes is the seems inside the end of the tip of the socks. It scratches my toes and after a short while they hurt a lot. I would like to order at least 3 more pairs but I am afraid I will experience the same pain/ discomfort. Otherwise I love the quality, they stay in place and no more swelling after long shifts. Any suggestions about the inside seems? Thank you so much."
4.0,"I really love the pattern and vintage feel of this swim top, so I am keeping it... even though the molded cups are a bit big."
4.0,These are nice socks.
4.0,"Product is just like the picture. Very cute, I got a size up because I'm very tall and wanted it to be longer so this worked out well for me. Looks a little cheap but for the price it's a good product"
4.0,Love this dress. Size large is perfect if your a 14. Sleeves don't go to your wrist so there a little short.
4.0,These are made well and look great but they fog up and make you sweat a little more than a regular mask. I wear it when I only need it for a shorter period because it's always nice to see a smile 😁
4.0,I really like them.  They do a great job.
4.0,"Don't get these and expect more than what you are paying for. I like them for spares, keep one in every vehicle. They look great. Ear pieces come loose fast."
4.0,"very pretty,nice weight,feel like a quality product and the deer design was nice as a gift for hunter.beautiful wood gift box."
4.0,No me gusto como se me be
4.0,In hopes to do some Yoga !
4.0,Works great with a kilt
4.0,"Lightweight. True to size. Only issue I had is the slip underneath is not the thickest - doesn't look totally see-through, but feels a bit opaque. Still love it, though!"
4.0,Great quality and even stylish enough to wear by itself. Unfortunately it did shrink quite a bit in the arms and now it's too short to completely cover my arms to the wrist.
4.0,An actual working bothered for Halloween prop
4.0,Purchased this for my boyfriend who is a substitute teacher. He loves it and gets tons of compliments on it. Its very durable but often gets lost among note book paper.
4.0,7.5/10
4.0,"I love these! I do struggle a little to keep them all the way up on my face, but I love the design. Full coverage and sun protection! Many compliments."
4.0,"If you're a 8.5 or size 9 shoes (nikes), go with a size small/medium. I made the mistake of getting the Large and the calves were little loose until it reached the calves. These are COMPRESSION socks so expect them to compress and feel snug. They should never feel uncomfortable and restricted. If you are a Nurse like I am and are on your feet for 12 hours running around, up and down the hallway, you'll love these. After a while, it feels like you aren't wearing socks at all. You should notice your calves/legs feeling less sore and throbbing. SB SOX were nice enough to comp me a small pair due to the fitment. Now I am telling you all, if you are in between what they recommend 8 or 9....go with the Small!"
4.0,Very nice styling and pattern.
4.0,"Nice shirt to wear to the local watering hole.  Decent quality, but I think the price is a little high. It would be a fair deal at $25."
4.0,"They were a gift for my son, and he really likes them."
4.0,Very nice dress. Stretchy and curve fitting. My only qualm is that the hem at the bottom is a bit ununiformed looking and does not fall like the picture. Mine looked a bit zig-zagged.
4.0,"Ordered SMALL (28inch waist/39 hips)<br />I purchased these pants thinking that they were more of a spandex material, but they are more cotton-like. I will say that they do look and feel great though. I am an avid runner and I tend to sweat a lot around my lower back. This is why I need mostly spandex material pants because those can hide the sweat. These pants would definitely absorb and show my sweat. If you are into more low-impact sports, lounging around or just don't really sweat then I would definitely recommend these pants. I will also add that I purchased the (what I thought as) mint green, but they are more of a true teal.<br /><br />PROS<br />Nice fit<br />Comfortable<br /><br />CONS<br />Color is darker in person<br />More cotton-like than I expected"
4.0,Still super cute
4.0,"These are a bit stiff, and not always simple to create a flat fit against all faces.  But it’s a tight cotton knit, and the filters are easy to insert. Overall, a good value."
4.0,"I ordered two of these dresses trying to find something to wear to a summer outdoor wedding: the white flowered one and the blue tendril one. I am 5’9” and about 155 lbs and I ordered a large. Large was the perfect size for me. I didn’t want them to be too tight, and this size skimmed over my figure nicely. This is definitely a dress for someone with an hourglass or curvy figure. I let a couple of friends with different body types (straight and apple shaped) try it on and it didn't look quite as nice on them. These dresses were plenty long enough, which is saying something as maxi dresses for tall women are hard to find. I could have probably worn wedges or heels with them and been ok on length. I will say that the dresses were made of different material. The white one was thinner but the belt loops were sewn unevenly with one higher and one lower. The blue one was much thicker but sewn fine. In the end, I returned them both. The white one was defectively sewn and the blue one was so thick it would have been too hot to wear to the event I needed it for. It would probably have been great for a fall event. Even though I returned these dresses, I would probably repurchase if I needed them for an event in the future. I do think the nearly $30 price is a bit high considering what I received, but if the price went down a bit I think it would be fair."
4.0,Beautiful dress! I bought it to wear to a dance and worked perfectly! I am 5'3 and I wore 2 inch heels and I had to get it hemmed but otherwise it fit perfectly!!! I am very pleased with the dress and everyone I know loved it too.
4.0,"These Sunsoul magnetic copper bracelets are super cute and comfortable to wear. The set comes with four bracelets that are easily adjustable (squeeze to tight or pull to expand). I have not worn these long enough to know if it has any actually pain relief properties, but regardless, the bangle bracelets are super cute and I love the layering look. I recommend this set of bracelets!"
4.0,Great quality and nice fit
4.0,"Bottoms are cut weird and bunch in odd places. Also, colors are not as bright or vivid as advertised in the photos but cute suit other than that."
4.0,Very cute color/pattern. My boyfriend says it’s his favorite golf skirt on me and his flattering it looks. I bought a size down for some yummy control.
4.0,This is a nice looking ring.  I put it inside of a bath bomb in a container.  It is a great surprise to have inside of my bath bombs.
4.0,"This dress is absolutely adorable. It fits her perfect and we are quite happy especially for the price. The quality is not amazing but I did not expect it to be for the price. The zipper is a bit difficult to zip up and I imaging that the puff balls on the front will fall off at some point and then I will sew them back on. Overall we are very happy with this dress. She is 9 but fits more like a 7. The sleeves would probably be on the short side for 9-10 year old which is the size this was listed for, but there is room in the waist."
4.0,Kind of thin material. But cute. And washes well.
4.0,"They are extremely big, so if you have a small face you won't like them. I actually love the big size. They look like the pictures. They are soft. They came in a little plastic pouch. The filters came in their own little package. It arrived quickly. They will be worn sparingly because they are holiday themed, so with proper care they should hopefully last for many Christmases. Only time will tell."
4.0,Nice. My step daughter liked them. (She’s 8)
4.0,"A bit short, but they still worked.  Would not recommend buying if you are over 5ft5in.  Otherwards I love them."
4.0,The color is beautiful. Eventhough i have a narrow back the elastic was very tight.<br />Im a medium and order the medium.  Is somewhat big at the bottom
4.0,"Quality is good, fit right, and great price. The picture makes the shirt a lighter shade but don't be fooled the green color is much darker."
4.0,"Okay, wasn't sure about this initially, but after several months I love this guy. Keeps things organized, great build quality. Highly recommend. Well constructed. Still a great purchase."
4.0,"Cheap feeling. The &#34;Bra&#34; part is basically a swimsuit, so after the first wash, the pads got turned around."
4.0,These are comfortable.  I can wear the white and yellow pair with my real gold and they match up fine.  The pink is a little too coppery (to me) and doesn’t look like rose gold so I took a star off for that.  I have sensitive ears and small ear piercings but these didn’t bother my ears and fit fine.  I generally have to wear real gold but figured for the price I would try these .  I really like the French clip backs on these.  Many earrings with these backs are too tight for me but these were perfect and don’t squeeze my lobes at all.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She was absolutely thrilled.  It's quite heavy, although not too much so, and looks exactly like the picture.  I was a little disappointed that it doesn't have a metal backing because I wanted to get it engraved, but other than that it is perfect."
4.0,We Americans have a different vision of what large is!  After some pulling and tugging. I was able to get the large on. After a while wearing them around the house I could breathe again.  I have since worn the large to workout.  I have two pair that I alternate wearing to the gym.  They look fine and inspire me to stand up straight and breathe correctly. I think if had to order again I would order the extra large.
4.0,"These are exactly as enormous as the description says they are. I have a 28&#34; waist, and it took several attempts to get them cinched up and situated right. Also on anyone shorter than.... maybe 5'8, they'd just be normal pants, not cropped. I'm 5'10, and they hit mid-calf if I wear them at my natural waist. To sum up: Super weird. Not bad. Will take some getting used to."
4.0,I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my son-in-law.
4.0,The medium is a bit large for my 6 petite frame.
4.0,"good value, but they are not bifocals, just reading glasses"
4.0,I like it but a bit small
4.0,Nice bag but could be a little larger.
4.0,Perfect for workouts and wearing to the pool or beach. Docked a star as they’re a little short. Wish they were about an inch or 2 longer. Rides up just a little when you do any kind of overhead movements.
4.0,Great product for the price. Love the color options.
4.0,Para moto no son buenas porque se le entran las basuras de los otros beiculos
4.0,"I really like this double secure banded headband (which in my mind is what keeps it on my head while I'm running around or working out) The material is super flexible, but enough to stay on my head for activities. Honestly, the only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the tightness when you first wear it. It works into the stretchiness, but I did have a headache for the first few days.<br />So far so good!"
4.0,Nice looking hipster glasses and they are unisex.
4.0,Very comfortable. I am happy with them. I usually wear shoe size 10 1/2 or 11 and order the slippers that said they were size 11-12. So I ordered a little larger and They fit well.
4.0,"not as transparent as it seems, a lil too big at the top"
4.0,Looks good ... it still in wrapper .. I haven’t wore it yet
4.0,Nice dress but a bit thin. A size up would have beeen nice. Afforable.
4.0,Lovely scarf. Feels great and will be a nice addition to complement items in wardrobe.
4.0,It’s thin and shows seams a little to much and hugs a little to tight for my taste.  Otherwise it is very soft and the seams are all done.
4.0,one of the underwear seems to have shrunk a bit.  Now when I put it on it slides down my butt and feels funny.
4.0,"I purchased several vests to use for outdoor activities - hiking, cycling, etc in the fall /winter here in the PNW. This one is my favorite with the location of the pockets, warmth and look. It fits trim - so while some of the other vests I own are roomy when you wear it, this one wears more like a fitted vest. Perfect when I use it cycling as it doesn't flap in the wind or anything. I typically wear mens L, but after looking at the comments, I went with a M and it's perfect for me. I'm 5' 9"" @ 170 in average shape. L would also work if I wanted something looser."
4.0,We are very pleased with our Badiya clutch.
4.0,I did not like how the joggers fit. I ordered a small. They were loose in some areas and made my butt look baggy. I ended up returning them.
4.0,Bought this purse in the Mud color. Bag came quickly and in nice shape but the straps were in black not brown like it pictured.<br />I don't feel its as top quality as some Italian leather bags I've purchased before.
4.0,Fit was perfect.  I ordered one size larger than I measured.  Ordered identical hoodie from some place else and it was so mis sized and there was no refund.  Thank you Amazon for making sure we are getting the advertised product.
4.0,Fast delivery love it.
4.0,It is very nice. The material definitely needs to be washed and ironed before wearing. The color smells like fish so wipe that down gently with a lysol wipe or something. The necklace/chain is very confusing to figure out and the skirt is like maybe a foot too long(im 5’4”). Other than that wonderful outfit.
4.0,"This jacket is soft, stretchy, and basic from the design to the fabric used. With that said, it fit snug (size small) as anticipated hitting just below the chest which worked for the empire dress I wore and smaller upper arms. I like the satin lapels and cuffs on the sleeves. This is a good balance of materials that give it a classic look. Works out well as a summer addition to dress up an outfit. For me the buttons were just too plain, so I replaced them with crystal buttons that weren't too flashy. This worked out great for the wedding I attended and got lots of compliments as it ended up looking like it was made specifically for my floor length dress. After laundering the item (cold, gentle cycle in a lingerie bag) and delicate tumble dry, it was slightly wrinkled needing a light ironing through a press cloth so as not to dull the satin. Overall, I recommend this item without reservation."
4.0,Good slippers.
4.0,I like it. Still can’t get one ball off but might be user error. It is a 14 gauge. Wish that would have been listed in the description.
4.0,The product worked exactly as described. Good construction and comes in a plastic case as well. Works just like the one I used at jewelry shops
4.0,"This dress is awesome and very comfy, and very cute! It fit great besides being a little tight in the bust for me (I'm a 40D) but that does not bother me too much as I'll wear a cami underneath to help with any button gaps. I highly recommend this dress, it can be worn up or down for work or a casual day. The fabric is very soft, and the polka dots are crisp without standing out too much.<br />For reference I'm 5'4&#34; 40D about 190lbs and I ordered an XL"
4.0,"LOOK&FEEL: The look is exactly like the posted photo the model is wearing. The off the shoulder parts of the dress has stretch bands as well as the area under the bust. The material is very soft making it super comfortable. According to the inside tab, it is made from 35% cotton and 65% polyester.<br /><br />SIZE: I am usually a LARGE. However, I just figured it would be stretchy so I ordered a MEDIUM so that the dress doesn't look too bulky. I am also 5'2&#34; and the dress is ALMOST on the ground. I washed it several times already and it has shrunk just a tad to this height.<br /><br />PROS: Addressing a question I saw, this dress would be perfect for PREGNANT/NURSING/BRA-FREE women. Believe it or not....I am not wearing a bra in the photos taken and you cant even tell!!! It is extremely comfortable. If you are nursing, you could easily bring the shirt down to nurse. I saw a photo where a woman wore it off one shoulder. This form would also be easy to nurse your child.<br /><br />There are slits and pockets!!!<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS: This was a great choice. Lately I have been clothes shopping on Amazon because most companies offer free returns and the item just arrives at my doorstep. This is definitely a great dress. I am CHUNKY/HEAVY SET, however this dress is so flowy and stretchy that makes me very comfortable. The tightness at the waist/under bust is perfect for giving me a shape without exposing that I have a stomach (lol). Love this dress!"
4.0,"Am 5ft2in, 130-135#. Ordered the M beige. Perfect fit, not see through at all. May order other colors. Thanks Amazon!"
4.0,This is so very soft and comfy. To dress it up you need cute booties and a belt. It looks a bit frumpy without accessories. But it is brilliantly colored and comfortable. I can't wear it on a dress-down day at work.<br /><br />It is only hand-washable. That is a major drawback and I wonder if once it is washed it will be ill-fitting or the colors will bleed. I hate hand-washing anything.
4.0,i like this band fit is nice and the band is comfortable and the two tone look is real sporty
4.0,"I got a large (5’9, 150 lbs) and the fit was great. Just wish it was a longer coat (like past the knees)."
4.0,"A nice pair of breeches for exercising horses. Good fit, good construction.  Pleased but feel product may be slightly over priced."
4.0,the belt is not soft !!
4.0,The customer service is amazing I can say that. They really value customers. They are super comfy to wear while sleeping however I'm not sure if my family is just loud as hell or these don't block sound as well as I would like but I could still hear them a bit. Still satisfied overall though.
4.0,"Soft, well made knit top. Fitting is a little loose, so order a size down! It’s super cute!"
4.0,Playful socks .  Wash and wear well.
4.0,"The clasp is hard to close. It can only hold a few credit cards and bit of cash. Don't bother putting in coins, it won't close."
4.0,"Great for colder weather, plan to wear them in Alaska."
4.0,"I really love this shirt. It's a perfect thickness and fit for me. I only gave 4 starts because the material is scratchy, I am hoping that some fabric softener will soften it up.  Want to order more but will wait until I see if I can make the shirt softer."
4.0,"I wear this to work since I am pregnant and worried my fingers will swell too much for my regular rings.  It's a lovely option that feels much fancier than the normal thin plain band.  I actually had a cashier today ask to see my engagement ring and I had to tell her it was rubber and show her closer!  If you are closer than 4 feet away, you can tell easily it is rubber and at this point I see a bit of scratch in the metallic sheen they use."
4.0,Gift for my dad. He says great belt but he deducted a star because there were no instructions and it was not obvious how to use it. Would buy it again.
4.0,"This seems to be the only affordable pair of acetate amber computer glasses available that also offers magnification options (for additional eye strain reduction). However, the first pair I bought had a significant amount of the amber tinting rub off after cleaning with the provided wipe within the first day of use. I was refunded and bought another in case it was a defective pair. So far, the tinting has remained after several uses, but the right lens quickly developed a ring of small scratches and the left is now starting to show the same. This seems to be a result of abrasion from the provided wipe. It's a standard lens wipe, which has never affected similar glasses I've owned in the past.  Fortunately, the scratches aren't visible while wearing the glasses and don't affect image at all. I'll probably buy another if these get too bad because it will still be cheaper than buying any other comparable product as far as I can tell."
4.0,"Cute pocket watch. I love it, the ticking is a little noticeable in a quiet room but that's what I love about it. I've only had it for a while (couple of weeks)so some of the black is already wearing off, it looks worn but it's still cool looking. I would have given it a five stars if the black was more durable but really that's my only compliant. This watch is well put together, and a must have accessory for any death note fan."
4.0,"I normally wear a size large and I bought an XL.  The XL fits okay, more like a club dress.  If I went for the XXL, then it would fit more like an everyday dress.  Because of the material, if it stretches too much it will turn white and you can see the seams.<br /><br />For the price, it's not bad at all and my husband likes how it fits on me."
4.0,comfortable and warm.
4.0,"Very cute shoe for my daughter. She really loves the squeaky noise. But the sizing is a problem for her. I ordered size 5 by reading the comments. But it is somewat large for her. It comes out while walk, so i will wait for some more time to use it. Size 4 would have really small.<br />Apart from that, this shoe is soft, cute and all loved ones will love it"
4.0,Love this product. Don’t care for the black C/C pocket.
4.0,Really pretty.  A bit smaller than I'd thought.
4.0,"Suit fits well, could use some personal adjustments but that won’t be a huge problem for me. Would be better if the suit came as a jumpsuit but in the end the two piece works well and the belt isn’t awful either, minus the fact that it was a little big for me I adjusted it with Velcro patches so it’d stay on better. All in all the suit it good. Hoping it will perform well for my three night elvis show coming up in December."
4.0,"I purchased this dress in three different fabrics. The pink is the lightest I got and you can see the pockets on that one but not the two darker. Not such a big deal that I’m going to return but if I buy again, I will only buy dark colors. There is also a two inch difference in the length between the longest and shortest ones but it’s a cheap dress so not a big deal for the money. Overall a good deal and may buy again.  I’m 5’5” and 157 pounds. The medium is a little tight but I’m losing weight and expected that."
4.0,"I love these tees. HOWEVER, they are billed as 56% cotton, 37% modal, 7% elastane. In fact, when they arrived, they're 93% cotton/7% spandex. I purchased them off Amazon once previously (fulfilled by Felina no less!) and again, same issue: description says blend with modal (which friends and I love, as the tee is so soft!) and instead 93% cotton tees arrive. THEY FIT CONSIDERABLY SMALLER! So again, I'm having to return the product. They're also not improved IMHO–truly the modal is what makes these long sleeve tees so wonderful. I wish the product descriptions on Amazon were more accurate. As they say, it would certainly save everyone involved a lot of time and trouble...."
4.0,"it doesnt really clip on the disposable mask but if you have a reusable mask that has a little slit, it'll work just great."
4.0,"Elastic at bottom is very tight. I usually wear M (5’7”, 135lbs). I ordered L and am returning it for XL. Hope that size is big enough."
4.0,I'd had my eye on this dress for quite awhile. I love the way it looks but it's a bit more on the green side than gray. I've worn it to work with brown boots & out running errands with Mary Jane's & both ways look great.
4.0,To soon to tell
4.0,Beautiful head bands just not for babies..I will have to adjust it to fit my daughter. Can't wait to see it on her. Wish there was more colors. Overall great items..well made and boy are they cute.
4.0,I really like the pin. but the packaging needs more attention. if i was going to give this to a person i would need to buy a small box to put it in because there wasn't any packaging meant for the pin. the pin it self was not harmed in anyway and is in good condition.
4.0,"38DD-30-42, the medium fit nicely but because of my chest, I returned for a large. I didn't want to keep using a safety pin to keep myself covered. Definitely, go up a size if you have a larger chest.<br /><br />Great dress! Breezy and comfortable. Very flattering to any body types.<br /><br />Fast shipment and great to wear to a luncheon, dinner date, or out shopping."
4.0,Dress was as expected
4.0,"I really like the styling on this little dress shirt for boys, and how interesting the collar is. It really gives it a fun style upgrade to have it be a little different from the norm.<br /><br />The shirt fits true to size and has fabric that is a little thinner than some of his other dress shirts, but certainly thick enough to do the job. It's not like he's going to wear this for 20 years, he can wear this until he grows out of the size, which will likely be about five different occasions where we want to wear a dressy shirt?<br /><br />The coloration is nice and I like the fit. The fabric is not stretchy, like most dress shirts."
4.0,"Ordered a size large because I have large bust. Fit great. I am usually a size small or medium bottom and the large bottoms fit perfectly so they run small, that just so  happened to work out perfectly for my body type. The material is pretty high quality as well. Will order again."
4.0,Beautiful leather but the straps could about 1-2 inches longer. Doesn't always stay on my shoulder.
4.0,This is a nice dress and it looks just like the  listing. I do not feel that it flatters my body type personally and I won't be wearing it because I feel uncomfortable in it. The material feels silky and almost clings to me. I'm not a big fan of this dress but it is pretty.
4.0,As has been mentioned in other reviews.  The wrap tie is bizarrely  long.  I have to wrap it around my waist 3 times just so it does not hang below the hem line.  Design flaw that needs to be fixed.  That is the only reason I'm not buying a few more.
4.0,"These sandals are adorable; the only thing is the foot bed is really hard. There's no give there at all, which I prefer. If that wouldn't bother you, then you'd probably love this sandal. Oh, and the arch is hard to get used to, but once you do, it's great!"
4.0,"Love these shirts, but if you order at night the price is higher then ordering in the morning"
4.0,Super Cute and great quality!
4.0,I bought this for my mom to wear after her knee surgery. The robe has a light-medium weight to it and is very soft. I subtracted 1 star because she said the zipper was a little weak at the bottom.
4.0,Quality of cotton could be much better.
4.0,"Nice eyeglass case with bright colors.  Cleaning cloth included.  Almost too small for my particular frames so I have to be careful when closing the case or the earpiece gets caught.  A bit stiff opening and closing, but I expect that will loosen with use.  Overall nice case."
4.0,"Nice screw fittings, good polish on the surface, slight flare noted at the screw ends, which would make transferring the jewelry in a fresh piercing challenging (especially with a taper-pin). Work great with healed piercings, though."
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and are the perfect weight. They come well packaged in a little pouch. But I was very disappointed they do not have backs on them.  I would have given them 5 stars if they did.
4.0,"They look good and I am satisfied with them.  They are flattened though, and I would have preferred completely round."
4.0,"Bag was really nice but I thought the hardware was silver.  It wasn't, it was black. I sent it back;."
4.0,A little bigger than I thought but it worked out good. Nice bag .
4.0,These are cute and look great from the knees up but the bottom mesh portion around the ankle area is just not fitted correctly. It's almost baggy...And why I just rated these as 4 stars. I didn't return these because I still think they're a a good value because they pass the squat test. Thankfully! I'm always concerned about exposing my backside during back squats or bending over. These pass the test and are good quality from that perspective. I'm a size 7/8 pants and got a medium and they fit nicely. I included photos for reference.
4.0,"Great quality. the space for the credit cards is too tight, but the leather is very nice and light-weight."
4.0,Its cute but falls off my wrist. I wish i was adjustable
4.0,I bought these for my 2 year old daughter and had prescription transition lenses made for them at Costco. The lenses were around $100 and they'll also take insurance now. Much better than the $400 cost from the local optometrist. The optician at Costco trimmed the temples to fit my daughter. They come a little long for that purpose.
4.0,Overall pretty good.  But the stems seem a little flimsy
4.0,"Good size and arrived quickly! Color is more yellow than orange and that is why it got 4 stars. Otherwise, I like it and it is just what I ordered!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but it is not black. It looks silver with black sparkles."
4.0,"The dress fit is small at the band around the midsection. I am hoping a bit of exercise and weight loss will rectify the situation. Spanx does the trick but may be uncomfortable for a tropical wedding. The colour is a bit darker than I expected. Overall, I love the style and material."
4.0,"A little snug at first but they are working fine.  But, of course, I don't run in them, I swim in them.  My favorites, actually.  I don't know how long they'll hold up to regular lap swimming but for the price and the comfortable liner, I'm willing to give it a try.  If it makes it more than six months with out fading or coming apart,  I'd come back a buy a few more pairs.  Make it a year and I'll definitely be back."
4.0,This cute little pin will bring a smile. It comes nicely packaged in a blue and yellow box. It is a lapel pin. the colors are vivid and it seems to be nicely made. I don't know too many men who would wear it but it is a fun piece for kids and those who work with them. adorable.
4.0,The hat is a bit too small for my head.<br />The waist band is a little too small.
4.0,My wife loves the skirt and it looks great. Price is somewhat higher than the quality. Overall a gorgeous skirt.
4.0,"I thought I bought an earring, but it's not. It's an ear cuff. But it's a good surprise. Once I get fed up with using it as an earring, I can turn it into a ring or pendant. Worth the waiting and the price."
4.0,It is perfect for my small womans head. It has a nice elastic liner to keep it fitted on a small head. To small for a large mans head.
4.0,A little thinner than I'd like but very functional.
4.0,My 11 year old granddaughter says it's cool.  So I'm assuming she loved it. I can't give 5-stars because I didn't really see it. It was ordered and mailed online.
4.0,Good quality material perfect fit or used it for my wedding dress .
4.0,2 butterflies are upside down. I was able to take them off and fix it.
4.0,"Works great looks great and dosent seem cheap at all, i like it"
4.0,"Good size and easy to use, but the plastic is brittle, so you cant bend it back into place neatly. Overall theyre ok in a pinch. Better quality is out there."
4.0,"I am normally an XS. But I am 5’7 and didn’t want to risk it being too short, so I got a S. This was a good call—it would’ve definitely been too short if I got my normal size. This dress also isn’t meant for girls with big chests, I am an A and it is pretty tight across the chest. Has a lining so it isn’t see through. It’s also more of a blush/cream color."
4.0,The pants and the tshirt fits my daughter just fine and she is 115 however it was saying 130 so i would say it fits on the smaller side but the pants is so cute. True to color and style. The bow however is cheaply made. It looks cute but i doubt the bow will last.
4.0,Color and size as expected. Only complaint is the material is a little thin. If I wear black tights under it you can tell.
4.0,"This was a gift. I was disappointed when I received this,I wanted to order one for myself. But not after I received it. The person I bought it for liked it, but I wear more quality jewelry"
4.0,"LOVE this hoodie. Very comfortable but a little snug, but not unwearable. I absolutely love that the arms are extremely long. I can never find long sleeved shirts to fit my arms. I am going to buy another one and go up a size to an XL instead.<br />5&#34; 11&#34;, 150 lbs, originally bought a large<br /><br />Update: posted pic is the XL. Comfortably tight and long arms!"
4.0,hard to get on but help from supplier was easy  good tight fit on ear tang even in hot Texas sweat.
4.0,I liked the top just was a little to small
4.0,"Eh not what I thought it was. Doesnt really look like the picture, and wicked hard to put on. Needs to come with instructions lol. But decent quality. And came with a free gift"
4.0,I wear a 7/8 in most wranglers. These fit snug and don’t have any stretch. They do starch and crease nice.
4.0,"So far my daughther loves them, she said comfortable and loves the lighting"
4.0,It is exactly what I expected it to be. I’m enjoying it.
4.0,"Cute socks. Be aware the mesh on the top of the sock is white, not peach/tan. So depending on how pale your feet are it may not look very natural."
4.0,"Slightly small. I love it, wished my wife liked it as much as me!:)"
4.0,I bought them for my 17yo pettite girl. She needs it for Volleyball. The adults ones fall from her nose and were too big for her. This ones works perfect. We had wash them and they still in good condition. I really recommend them.
4.0,"I'm hard to buy glasses for, having such a large head. These weren't uncomfortable to wear for a few days though. They definitely block some sunlight, and I'm glad to learn they're UV protective. I would rather have a few pairs of these than 1 pair of name-brand."
4.0,The color was a little off. Not the correct shade of blue. The picture online doesn’t accurately depict the color. The skirt was knee length so we had to have it hemmed. The top was loose so we took it in.  Ordered size small. She is 5’3” and 105 lbs. plan on spending more for quick adjustments. We didn’t have it properly fitted to save $$.
4.0,A little on the small side. But not bad.
4.0,"Love the print, the fabric not so much. I ordered the L and it fitted perfect. It's high rise as the picture."
4.0,"I love the price for these. They are both very pretty and look good without a hair band on them. As some other reviewers said, the edges of the cuff are a bit too low so the hair tie can slip off the bracelet occasionally. I don't really mind having to put it back on every once in a while, especially for the price."
4.0,"OK my waist is 32.5 in..im 5'9..This fit right out of the package BUT I cannot handle super tight waist bands...I want elastic waist bands to feel like PJ's no pressure. The elastic band width is over an inch so the big squeeze is there. Now I really liked the look, material and length so worth pulling out the ole sewing box and altering.  Done by hand . I ended up removing ( in the back) about 6-7 inches of the elastic-opened seam and cut threads holding elastic. Then sewing seam back up. Perfect now."
4.0,"This cap was quite small, much to small for me.  I gave it to my neighbor for her little girl as the one I received is more of a child's size than adult.<br />The cap is attractive and comfortable, soft and stretchy enough for a child.<br />The color is very pretty."
4.0,Ruffles stick out more than I would like
4.0,love the bead but it doesn't lay well on the bracelet.  beautiful and great quality
4.0,"Good looking. Fits ok when on, but! Rather difficult to put on and take off. It takes a lot of wiggling. Fast delivery."
4.0,take it with banble.<br />Can't answer from the watch the calls
4.0,Pretty! Would order again.
4.0,Its 7 degrees and winter in Wisconsin. I needed a thin silk sock liner to fir under the warm wool socks.<br /><br />these work perfectly for that need!
4.0,nice bag for the price very roomy
4.0,"So Cute! little bigger then i thought, but still adorable"
4.0,Would gave been happier if the beads were of same size and the colors were are little more darker. Still like them.
4.0,"I don't have small wrist, and the black rubber band just wasn't cutting it for me.  Now it has some weight to it, so now the blaze feels more like a watch.  I am very happy with the purchase."
4.0,Great looking PJs
4.0,"Very thin material- sexy, fit as expected, super flattering, just a bit chilly!"
4.0,Very cute belts!
4.0,The softness was amazing
4.0,"This clutch is beautiful, very blingy and a tad heavy but definitely stunning.  Sadly, I have to return it because I purchased it to bring to a wedding and although the exterior meausurements indicated it would fit my Galaxy S7 edge (I measured my phone before ordering this purse too) the purse walls are fairly thick and the phone definitely doesn't fit."
4.0,I like the fit of these pants. They fit perfect.
4.0,"Description states it had a lobster clasp, it did not.....Specs call it a spring clasp"
4.0,"I love these day and night glasses. Worked in the day light and night time. I used them for night time driving. Unfortunately some girl stole em from me, so she must of loved them too."
4.0,"Floppy looking,"
4.0,"Unlike the Jacked Up shims which really are heel lift only, these sandals are formed with a sole and heel lift.  It is not what I expected but I am using them.  My lift is a quarter inch.  Each time I first put the sandals on my balance is thrown off a bit but after a few minutes I pretty well adjust."
4.0,Color was just as expected. With yellow I was worried about the color since I wanted it to be a bright yellow but not on the neon green side.
4.0,"It's fairly well-made, especially so for the price. The shirt was delivered within the promised window, on the quicker side."
4.0,"Fits good, the pads in the top are terrible tho, they kept folding into themselves so I just took them out."
4.0,"About a size too big, had to reorder a full size smaller"
4.0,"It's a super comfy shirt, but it stretched out very quickly."
4.0,The maroon material seemed better quality vs the tan.
4.0,Great product bought for my uncle as a present and says he loves it!!
4.0,"super comfy, love the tall waistband."
4.0,Warm hat but has a funny smell until you was it. Gave it to my son..
4.0,"Great running socks, I prefer the ultra light cushion even for long runs but these are second best."
4.0,"Loved the wallet, took sometime to arrive but it was very nice. would have given a 5 but the time I had to wait was very long, but product is good quality."
4.0,This is exactly what it us described as.
4.0,Very comfortable. Be careful with washing/drying as it will shrink if not done properly
4.0,"Quality material and looks great on my keychain.  Do wish the item was a bit bigger.  Seems to get lost amongst the keys and supermarket cards.  All and all, it's a keychain and serves its purpose."
4.0,"Had a little bit of trouble finding right size. Normally she wears a 10, but ended up needing an 11 1/2. So keep that in mind. But they are cute and was told very comfy!"
4.0,Roses are not identical but in real life roses are not the same. Nice and lightweight
4.0,"Great for home use. Item was purchased for hospital stay, it's slightly too transparent for preference. Overall comfy and good quality."
4.0,Looks like the picture and long lasting.
4.0,Good but broad
4.0,"I love the fit and style, comfortable, and inexpensive. I am very curvy and it hung well on my hips and bust. It is thin cheap material but great for the price. If you have a larger chest make sure to order it large enough as it buttons up pretty high on the neckling and the buttons will gape if it is too tight. I ordered a size up and it fit great. I wore with a lightly peticoted slip for volume also"
4.0,"It is a little lighter gauge material than I expected, but the hat fits and sets well on my head.  Workmanship is even and all seams are tight."
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable. The bottoms a little thinner than expected. Fine for relaxing around the house, but wouldn’t run outside to grab my mail. Top is fine and have worn to the grocery store."
4.0,Its adorable I love it. Only problem is that the links that you fasten it close with break kinda easy. Other than that its a great bracelet.
4.0,not as loose as I like...but very comfortable and cute
4.0,Love the pants only down side is they are a little baggy in the legs.
4.0,"This is a really cute dress with handy pockets.  It's extremely well made.  It's slightly snug around the chest, but not enough to complain about.  This one's a keeper ladies!"
4.0,Good quality but too small.
4.0,"This set of tank top and shorts is cute and I appreciate that it is unisex. However, it is so thin and soft that the fabric really recollects pajamas, much more than anything you would wear to go outside. I also don't like how the logo, which is embroidered, kind of makes the rest of the fabric wrinkle around it because the embroidered logo is such a different texture than the fabric.<br /><br />These were true to size and went through the wash just fine, they are stitched nicely and made of a nice, soft cotton. If you are looking for a lightweight pajama set, this is a good choice. It's nice that it can be passed from boy to girl or girl to boy, if you do hand-me-downs with your kids."
4.0,"I don't exactly have a thick wrist. Most Apple Watch bands fit me fine, with a normal amount of lead after the buckle.<br />But this one? I can barely close it on the second hole from the end.<br />It still fits—just barely—but you might want to be aware if you have a larger wrist.<br />Otherwise, it's a beautiful band!<br />Go, Pack, Go!"
4.0,"This is a really good and not expensive Band replacement, considering that Sammy sells their owns around the 50s, so far I really like it, but the materials does looks simple and what I don't like is that some dust particles get stuck to it and it is really soft compared to an original one. The color is really good but is not that dark blue as I expected it will be."
4.0,Bigger than expected. Material is of a cheaper feel and piles quickly.
4.0,I just wish they were a little bigger
4.0,"I previously purchased the same dress in red and black. I love each of them. They fitted prefectly. Loved the fabric they were made out of. I received the purple dress. I wished the sleeves and dress were the same color. The material feels different from the other 2 dresses that Love so much. Got lots of compliments.  Oh well, haven’t decided if I am going to keep it or send it back. Only been 4 days since I received it. I will try it on again. I love the style of the dress."
4.0,Does not lay flat.
4.0,Just acquired about 2 weeks ago. So I’m still working on the stand-up to time test. I have used them and washed per instructions and they’re still performing well. Sure helps tired legs feeling.
4.0,Great for working out or as a crop top. Only suggestion is to have the cups sewn in because they move while wearing. Otherwise the thickness is perfect and not see through at all. The material is also soft to the touch but not snuggly.
4.0,good product and excellent service
4.0,"I'm a skinny man, and the cape barely fits my neck"
4.0,"Overall, a comfortable nice looking high quality shirt.  It allows me to have long sleeves to protect my arms from the sun without being hot."
4.0,"Loved loved loved these... but one fell out in the first week of owning them and is still missing...<br />They are really perfect though good size, got a million compliments on them...."
4.0,"Bought these socks for my grandson, who is a pro basketball player. He says they are great and help a lot. Legs feel better for the support"
4.0,Good product..!
4.0,This is very beautiful ! However I do weight 205 lbs it fits but u can't breathe out haha but nice quality if your maybe under 200
4.0,These are soft to the touch and flexible - I think they will be a good sandle for my son.
4.0,"I'm 6ft 230lbs 51"" chest, work out, second purchase of XXL this time in different colors, fits well but a little long in length, cool and breathable, very satisfied."
4.0,"Very nice, but after all, they are rubbery plastic.  You get what you pay for. However, they look better than you would expect."
4.0,Exstreamly soft and cute easy to snap I sometimes have trouble with snaps when I order things like this. Only complaint is after one wash the design faded pretty bad but all over a very cute outfit
4.0,"Generally a nice item, fit well, the waist tie is very long and needed shortening. arm bows are a bit much but easily removed, pretty color."
4.0,"My son loves the style of these jeans, but we have issues with the length. I have ordered two different sizes and neither was quite long enough to suit the fit he was looking for. He is not excessively tall (5'11&#34;) but each pair barely met the ankles."
4.0,"Great color, I read some reviews about it being hard to wash but I had no problem with it. It is a bit too big, bigger then I thought it would be.<br />But over all really like it."
4.0,Great compression.. The top compresses more than the other material. I had a surgery and needed to make relief cuts in the top to allow the blood to actually compress as it was supposed to.. Different materials make the top much more restrictive rather than compression.
4.0,The one side is really short it's like a shirt not a nightgown. But the top half is perfect and the material is awesome and comfy. I'll probably just get some same material night shorts to wear with it
4.0,My wife said they’re excellent quality but they run small.
4.0,"We bought this dress in the navy, gorgeous color.  Correspondence with the company was prompt and answered all my questions. Received the dress exactly the day we were told it would be here. They requested my daughter's measurements which i thought was a plus, with ordering online it made me feel a bit more confident it would fit her.  It fits well, a tad big in the waist.  I think this dress does look better when the waist is a bit tighter like the picture. Makes the pretty skirt &#34;pop&#34;  The dress is very well made, nice quality and heavy.  Beading on the dress is perfect.  I would have given this a five star but the zipper is very hard to zip up. We struggled with it. Not a huge issue, this dress is for homecoming so it will prob be the only time she wears it.  We can deal with it for one night!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend buying from this company and this dress."
4.0,"After reading all the reviews I decided to go up a size. I'm 38 wks pregnant and usually I would where a medium or large but since I read that this fitted small, I ordered XL and it was way too big. I would have been better off ordering a L. Besides the size, I absolutely love this dress. It was really nice an elegant! Even my husband loved it."
4.0,Was a nice hat to pack in bag
4.0,"You can definitely buy a nicer set of walking poles, but for the price I think these are decent set of entry level poles.<br /><br />They are extremely light, and they are extremely portable.  And, for a first time user of these walking poles I didn't want to invest too much money, and I can't say I was disappointed.<br /><br />The height is easily adjustable, and uses a pressure clamp instead of metal studs, which means it is very easy to move and more flexible, but not quite as sturdy.<br /><br />The carbon fiber makeup makes the poles very light and you'll have no problem using them over long distances.<br /><br />It also comes with a carrying bag, which I appreciated.  For the professional hiker you may want something else, but for a once in a while user these fit the bill nicely for me.  (A little bit of a pain to assemble, but once that was done they seemed to work fine.)"
4.0,Would have preferred it a bit wider but it does keep you cooler
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with my purchase. I took a chance on ordering a product with no reviews because I liked the style and that it had a full image (other ones I looked at had a border of love in 100 languages.) The image is clear (it was hard to take a photo of but I think I managed to get some good ones.) It took 28 days to be delivered but I knew that was going to be the case when I ordered it. It came with a nice box and a gift bag. Only problem was that I got an 18"" chain instead of the 20"" I ordered, so it is shorter than I would like."
4.0,It's a well made sure but was too big for my faughtet even though I got the size shr currently. She'll be able to wear in the spring so I didn't return.
4.0,I ordered size up not too small I love this dress and wear it mostly with sweaters over in the fall and winter
4.0,"I bought the blue. I love them, but they don't get 5 stars because I had to add my own back to them, they come out of my ear without a back."
4.0,Love these! Have been wearing them everyday (just the 4mm) and havent had any problems. I sleep with them on as well and they don't bother me at all.
4.0,"My daughters wear a 6 and 7 shoe in womens sizes and I bought them a medium.  A small may fit for the size 6 shoe if she wants something snug really snug.  These seem to be fine, but they also seem a little flimsy.  The stitching is fine, but they are made out of a thin mesh upper.  It's very thin compared to the sturdy neoprene-type dance paws that I've seen - so completely different.  I think the suede pads underneath could be a little bit larger - come closer to the toes.  My ballet-dancing daughter doesn't like them as much as her ballet shoes because she's used to having a large pad to turn on.  Remember that they are coming from far away and will take a couple of weeks to get here.  Even with all that caution, they are about 1/4 of the prices of something like capezio's footundies.  They will work fine for something she only has to wear for an hour a week."
4.0,Very beautiful just in time for Christmas pictures with my husband we haven't taken pictures since 05 our wedding
4.0,"It's a really adorable hat and well made.  That said, my daughter bought it for her dad who, admittedly, has a very large head.  It's just way too tight :(  Great hat for a regular sized adult head or a larger child/teen head, but not for an adult with a big noggin."
4.0,"This fits beautifully. I got a size small. 155 lbs, 5'7"". Unfortunately, even after my thoughtful deliberation on which colors I wanted, they sent me the wrong bundle. I was looking forward to blue and black shirts and I instead got green and gray. 😒"
4.0,turned out to be very small ...
4.0,"My son likes these shoes. They don't have arch support, but these are skate shoes and they function well for that purpose. They're also some nice looking shoes. Dad's gonna get a pair, as well!"
4.0,"Keep in mind these are capri leggings, so they do not go to the ankle. They are very soft and stretch easily. I am a little concerned about the construction due to a knot of loose threads in the inseam, but hopefully these will stay stitched together. I cannot be sure until they have been worn several times."
4.0,"Yup, worth the price, not spectacular quality, but are priced OK for what you are getting."
4.0,Cute sandals but were very small had to rerurn
4.0,"Looked great on my husband, received many compliments"
4.0,"The shirt is adorable, but runs extremely small."
4.0,"Comfy, but shrunk in the dryer. Order a size up."
4.0,"Great and. Appears to be very sturdy and is incredibly smooth. It came with a nice little band replacement tool with 4 spare springs. Unfortunately when I received it, the pink band appears almost more of a buff color and is too narrow for the watch it was intended for. I'll be returning it"
4.0,It’s cute very stretchy definitely size down ..
4.0,"All my watch bands are happily attached now, and the included tool makes the task much less frustrating.<br /><br />One caveat - be careful not the jar the box when the cover is open even a little bit: the one millimeter difference in length from one size to another makes sorting these out a tedious ordeal."
4.0,"Sowing could be better, it’s a little loose so threads will start to loosen on second use. Either than that it’s good."
4.0,"Buena calidad, un poco pequeños; pero era lo esperado"
4.0,Love it! The pin is exacly as shown.
4.0,"Really, really nice!!! The only problem is I bought them for a friend & they look too big for her. (Not too big for me though)"
4.0,"I am about 5 ft 2.5 inches tall, 126 lbs. I bought a small and the fit is actually pretty ideal. I expected to find something wrong immediately, but did not, yet. The fabric is NOT stiff, though it's also not soft/silky smooth; I would compare it to linen. And it's nice & thin so I think it feels perfectly comfortable. The sinched elastic ""waist"" thankfully sits at just the right spot for my height. Probably thanks in part to my smallish chest. I was nervous when ordering that it wouldn't look right to me but I think I might even go ahead & order in another color. I have trip to thailand coming up and have a DIFFICULT time finding dresses that suit my style. This is modest, cheap & attractive in my opinion. Maybe the details vary between colors & sizes but I am genuinely surprised by how much I like the dress I received.<br /><br />OH, ALSO, it is very true that the brick red is realistically orange but it is a sort of rusty orange - I know most are disappointed but I personally chose brick red on purpose because I like this shade of orange very much. The color is the only part of my dress that didn't match the photo! Buy it; you can return if needed."
4.0,This is a great purchase though I would not consider them a compression tank. They feel good and are a nice quality. I would buy them again and likely will.
4.0,Ordered large and received proper size.
4.0,"The quality of the mask was fabulous! It was purchased for my adult sized son's phantom performance. The only issue was the elastic strap holding the mask in place was a little tight. However, the strap help up through multiple performances! Great quality!"
4.0,"this item is nice, but it was shipped over sea and took forever to get. I don't remember if this was a lot of money or not, but I don't know if it was worth it. its sold individually but it is very cute. if I had to buy again I wouldn't. but up to you if its worth the time and money"
4.0,Package had been previously opened.  I assumed it was returned so I am returning it.  I purchased two other as gifts and the boxes were sealed.  Clear sound and cellular capable which is crisp
4.0,The hat itself was just fine.  Would need some time to get the shipping creases out of it.  I did return mine because it was too small for my head.  I also thought the brim would be wider that what it actually was.
4.0,"These are a great pair of glasses. However, I must warn you about this size. It is a little too big for my face. These 50 MM glasses are great because the other John Lennon sunglasses on Amazon are 40mm which is way to small. It would be nice to find a happy medium. The shipping g was very fast, and came 6 days ahead of time. Highly recommended, but do not complain if these are too big on your face. Please measure your head girth before buying ANY glasses. Thank you."
4.0,Beautiful dress but way too small.
4.0,But a elastic black belt will do.  Its pretty and gives for to the body.
4.0,Hoping it would help with some health issues.  It does appear to be making my left knee a bit less painful.  (Am wearing it just below my knew.
4.0,"Good quality, looks so delicate! I absolutely loved it!"
4.0,This frames are actually pretty cute and well made but there Chinese the case does not carolina Herrera original
4.0,I liked the length
4.0,It's soft but kinda tight
4.0,"Cute, but fits awkward at neck and armpit area, snug across chest, then loose at waist, then the seam is snug at hip bc the thread at the seam doesn't have enough stretch. Probably would look cute if you aren’t curvy. For reference, I am 5’6, 135lbs, 38-30-40, dress size 8."
4.0,I love the dress but the color is far from what you see in here.  Fuchsia color is bright pink.  That is why I gives it a 4 stars.
4.0,"The fabric is thinner than I expected, but still opaque enough that you don't need an  undershirt. I ordered a medium and the chest is a bit snug, while the stomach area is very loose. (I'm 5'1"", 120lbs, 32D and usually wear a size 4) The cut is flattering, and the pockets are perfect!"
4.0,"Like the slippers, got them for indoor but if I have to run out they have a good sole!!!!"
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and well made, but we paid extra for express delivery and it was 4 days late.  If planning to purchase the dress for a particular date, add at least 5 days to the express shipping date."
4.0,"I am satisfied with this product. I am in the kitchen everyday, water runs off the apron so i don't get soaked, its adjustable.  I ordered the I am 5ft 1inch,  weighs 182lbs, bust 46inches, waist 38inches, shoulders are about 16inches, Hips 42 inches"
4.0,Great top to dress up jeans .  Love the color.
4.0,I do love this! Feels great and looks great! I have noticed after having it a little over a month the silver is starting to peel off and is turning black. So unfortunately this won’t be able to stay in much longer. Great while it lasted!
4.0,"Rings were nice and decent quality. Only issue was that the black chain, where it is closed onto itself to make the loop around the ring, is slightly raised, but this has not been an issue."
4.0,It somehow didn't look exactly like the pdc but is still an awesome looking dress for the value
4.0,Good thick gloves that allow solid finger mobility. The only thing is that in temps below about 30 my fingertips start to get cold while on my bike. Very good for walking though.
4.0,"I love the color of these sunglasses! They are the best cheap sunglasses i've ever had.  Great quality, super cute! My only complaint is that the frame is quite small.  I don't consider myself to have a really big face, however, i do have some cheeks on me.  These would be perfect for girls with petite faces.  But for average size to large type faces.  These glasses make your face look even bigger/rounder."
4.0,"The Necklace looks pretty, but it's very thin and fragile."
4.0,I really like this bralette. I will need to find some inserts but the comfort is terrific. Loved it from the first time I wore it.
4.0,"Love this top! Large fits as expected, I’m a 32D. I only gave 4 stars because I’m not a fan of the bottoms. I don’t like thongs, I wish it came with Brazilian bottoms. Anyway, highly recommend"
4.0,LOVE IT!  Great price and quality.
4.0,"It's a beautiful item, but I think it's a bit overpriced."
4.0,Excellent for hot day.
4.0,Good shoes for college shower. No slip. Nothing fancy.
4.0,the side pockets in Great
4.0,The various sizes are great!
4.0,"Looks great, feels comfortable.  Only worn once so far - hope it looks as good next time.  Ironing all those pleats could be a challenge..."
4.0,The hoodie is nice but the rainbow hoodie strings it came with did not match.  It was supposed to be white. We removed the strings.
4.0,4 stars bc the leather scuffs easily but still looks nice and very comfortable to wear. I have smaller wrist and it easily adjusted down to fit. Great no matter what sz wrist you have.
4.0,"Gift for a cat lover. Brooch is very pretty. Nice size and colors.  Wish the pin was a bit better, it doesn’t have the little safety to double secure the needle. Hence 4 out of 5 stars"
4.0,"They're beautiful! The clasp is well made, the material isn't cheap and flimsy. The only thing I don't like is the straps, but they're the same straps as most bras. Completely worth it!"
4.0,Great transaction! Good product! Didn’t like faux fur pom...very cheap.
4.0,"I love the warmth of these socks.  They are a good quality construction. I wear them at night to keep my feet warm while sleeping.  I also like the non-skid bottoms  The only downside is they could be a little larger as they were advertised as a woman's size, and for this reason, I give them 4 instead of 5 stars."
4.0,I bought this dress for a work event and have not regretted it at all.  Good fit love the feel and I can wear it out to dinner and to work.
4.0,"This replaces a rfid I had.  It's big, roomy and organizes all your stuff well.  Only hassle is card slots are hard to get cards out of.  Still highly recommend it!"
4.0,For the price the bracelet is great though nothing special. I bought it to fit my Casio MDV106-1A and it fits and looks great although it was a bit of a pain getting it on. Make sure to use the spring bars that come with the bracelet as the ones that come with the watch itself are too big.
4.0,"I intentionally ordered a bouffant scrub cap because I wanted a puffed up style rather than the regular fitted scrub cap. This runs small, there's hardly any room for this cap to ""puff up"" to live up to its name.<br />In the past, I usually buy small sized hats anyway so this worked out ok. If you have a bigger sized head or usually wear a large hat, this may not adequately cover your hair."
4.0,"nice and very beautiful shirt, I bought black one and it is a bit for my grand mother, but I think other colors will be good.<br />I wear 40 US size and I bought XXL was exactly for me"
4.0,Whoever thinks that it didt say it was said in the description that it was half look better this is good just be careful with it
4.0,this was bought  as a gift tor a friend
4.0,I love it but need to get a smaller size. It’s very warm.
4.0,"I wanted something for me and my sister to wear to church and these are really nice.  She loved hers, too."
4.0,My wife liked these shorts and said they dry quick enough to use for paddleboarding.  The only complaint is that the overlayer of shorts instead of a skirt means the fabric is a little bulkier between the legs.  The fabric is thin enough it isn't a problem but would be more flattering as a skirt overlay instead of a shorts overlay.
4.0,This jacket is great and is extremely comfortable. The only problem was that after one wash the whole zipper fell apart.
4.0,Had to order three sizes up. In all good tailoring but the sizes are not the regular sizes
4.0,value for paid. recommend
4.0,"Beautiful dress, just a little big. I'm 5'7 and it was past my feet floor length"
4.0,Was purchased as a gift. Went over well
4.0,"This dress is beautiful, I am big on top so i filled it pretty nicely unlike the other reviews. I will say though, it is so long ! I am 5'1 so I like shorter dresses and this one didn't cut it it was way below my knees. had to return it."
4.0,"Love the look and feel of the shirt. Overall very happy with it. The elastic bands within the sleeves were tight, and were leaving marks on my arms when rolled up, had to cut the sleeves open and slice the bands to make it more wearable. Would still recommend."
4.0,A little more see through than I expected but I love the dress.
4.0,"Cute sunglasses but a bit flimsy. Lenses are very dark, which I prefer."
4.0,Cute but way too big for my 6 y.o. Will put away and hopefully he still loves minecraft when he's 8!
4.0,"The bra fitted me really well, the bra material was smooth an comfortable. My only complaint is the material where the clasp is. The material at the corners is some of plastic and sticks into my back and is painful. Didn’t return bra as it is so comfortable, will try and fix issue myself with some stitching."
4.0,Super cut. Great length
4.0,"They could look better, but they feel good to wear and do keep a lot of sweat off of you."
4.0,"They arrived faster than originally expected, which is great. But right out of the package, the small box they came in was slightly crushed. Thankfully the glasses were not damaged, surprisingly! Understandable giving the envelope they were sent in. Just be aware, it can happen, but glad these were ok. Fit great, look great, nice feel looking through lenses. Very pleased."
4.0,"very cute scarf, I would purchase again. One reviewer said it had a weird scent, and they were correct. I had to wash the scarf before I wore it."
4.0,Get what you pay for! The color failed after a while and makes you're fingers green where you worn them but they look exactly as pictured and were great until they faded
4.0,"I don't know why but one day I was sitting thinking, ""Wouldn't it be cool to have a necklace that was also a Kaleidoscope?""  So of course I went straight to Amazon where I can find EVERYTHING and there it was!  I wear it often and get compliments from people who don't even realize it's a kaleidoscope.  People probably look at me strange when I'm in a public place holding it up to my eye!  Only thing I would like to be different is the ""gems"" in the kaleidoscope are obviously round beads with holes through the center.  Like the kind a little girl would string on yarn to make a necklace.  It would be better if they were more sparkly and blingy without the hole."
4.0,"These are great! Very clear lens! Just wish the lenses were more snug in the frame. A very slight gap near the bridge. For everyday wear, the gap is not perceptible."
4.0,"I usually buy size small, but after measuring myself and comparing to the product specifications, I fell into the medium size range. However, I wanted the shorts to fit loose and drapey so I ordered a Large and they work well!"
4.0,"I wore this on vacation and it was comfortable, breathable but fun and a little more dressy.<br />I really like this top and hope it does well with washings."
4.0,"I’m 5’4” 165lbs with it the weight evenly distributed and it fits perfect. It falls above my knees, but it’s under my finger tips!"
4.0,"I spend most of my time in a hospital gown and enjoy wearing these shirts underneath. They are sort and comfortable and launder well. I deducted one star because  they are tighter than I expected. To be fair, this is my first order of undershirts, and I have no tangible base of comparison."
4.0,Fits wells and it very comfortable. I ordered a large for extra room. Love the pockets too.
4.0,"The shirt is beautiful, cut well, fits well... it’s just a bit off on sizing.  I’m 5’7, 190 and wear. 44G.  Normally XXLis a perfect fit but this ones just a pinch snug.  I’m going to keep it and wear it.... will still be perfect for summer!"
4.0,"It is well made and very nice looking.  I followed the size chart and ordered according to it...I probably should have gone a size bigger than suggested.  It's more of a long shirt than a dress (also the ruffles at the bottom will roll up some after wash/dry, making it look a bit shorter too)  Still looks appropriate with leggings though and my kid likes it. 4 stars only because of the length."
4.0,"Fits well. I'm 6'-0"" 170 lbs. The shirt it's not overly large in the middle, more of a slim fit. I did hope it would be a thicker material. It's a bit thin."
4.0,"I love how comfortable these pants are! They are a little see through (maybe it's just the color because I have some in black and they are fine), but otherwise these are awesome!"
4.0,I have a Series 3 42mm and the band fits great. The one thing I wish were different is how the piece that locks into the watch itself is longer and fits like an apple band would.
4.0,Love the feel and color.<br />It was a bit small.<br />Would go up a size<br />When ordering.
4.0,"It's a bit hard to review a coat in late summer, as there's no way to tell how warm it will be.  So all I can say is that it is comfortable and the fuzzy fleecy texture is cute and casual.  Easy to get on and off.  Fits pretty well, too, though probably not room for several layers underneath.<br /><br />My guess is that it won't be the go-to for really cold days, but in the fall it will be a good casual option.  I'll report back if it doesn't keep me warm."
4.0,Looks good . But on the heavier side...
4.0,You could wear as a cover up or a dress.
4.0,"Good fit. However, belt loops poorly stitched, not secure.  Several came apart."
4.0,"It fit a tad tight, but I am breaking it in. The brim is a small and will provide less protection from the glare of the sun than a normal hat. The real benefit of this hat is in the title; it is a &#34;Pocket&#34; hat, which means it easily folds up in your pocket. I got it so I can put it in my pocket while I ride my bike, and when I get to my destination, I can take off my helmet and put this hat on. It works great for that."
4.0,"Great price, I'm using the crystal for other earrings"
4.0,"It was a little big but still was a perfect smash cake outfit. Sadly when I washed it, the red sleeves bled into the white of the shirt and caused a little pink into it. But other than that it was super cute and perfect for our Wild One theme!"
4.0,"After one wash on delicate the white screen print on the front faded and started cracking.  Kinda wish i hadn't spent more than $10 on this outfit. But the fabric is nice and the fit is pretty good. I really like baby clothes with the snaps on the collar so I'll keep putting it on my kid, at least."
4.0,"These are fine ties. The colors are bright and very striking. From far away, they even could be mistaken for silk ties. But close up, they are clearly polyester. It's not a huge deal--these are more rugged and need less care, but if you work in a fancier work place, your colleagues might take note. If you need them just as your one tie that you have for special occasions, these may be a little bright. The pink one has sparkly thread woven in as an accent. I like it, but it could be a little off putting. The purple one also has a sheen/shimmer to it. Again, I think it really pops with the right shirt and suit combination, but I can imagine the set isn't for everyone, especially folks who only want to own one or two ties."
4.0,Fit good and gives me the support I need.
4.0,"I am buying a pair of these from Amazon today but I recently purchased several pairs of the same product at Costco. Once you take into account that they sit at the natural waistline (just above your hips) which means you may buy a size or two larger than other styles, you will love these! The fabric is heavy and yet comfortable, looks very professional. They wash extremely well, and maintain the leg center crease even with numerous washes. I typically hang dry my dress pants, but I think they would be fine dried all the way also."
4.0,"Great looking top. Good for the office, love the material. It is light weight. Feels good on."
4.0,Perfect jacket if you want to be Indiana Jones. Quality is not good enough for a day to day jacket.
4.0,"Don't care for the inside of the purse, to much to go threw to get what you need to get it out ofyour purse.  Other than that its a good size and quality for the money."
4.0,"225 lb, 5’2 , bought 2xl, i feel like this dress was shorter from the back than linger in front.."
4.0,Nice material & they fit very well.
4.0,"Came in packed nicely. Bought Medium size.<br /> Fabric is nice not too thin or delicate. Size and style pretty nice. Fits well.<br />Wasn’t very happy with the hemming though,  the white thread on gray. You can easily remove the stitches and redo it with matching color. Overall...pretty good."
4.0,These are really cute and decent quality for the price. My only issue is that the pictures they advertise make them look more red but they are actually PINK. Kind of disappointed the color of the product isn't the same as what is pictured.
4.0,"I can’t see myself wearing this as a sports bra, except maybe to a yoga stretching class. It has little support, arm holes are fairly big (I’ll probably sew up the straps a bit), band at the bottom isn’t snug. I’m a 34dd and ordered a M. I do love the smooth fabric and the crossover detail on the back. Perfect for open back shirts and lays really smooth on the skin."
4.0,"These are decent quality pants.  Zippered pockets are nice when riding to carry key and such.  Husband is a 30"" waist could have gone with a small or a medium.  He opted for the Mediums and is happy with the fit as he's using them for biking and didn't want them too constricting.  The velcro tabs on the side allow him to tighten the waist properly. He tightens the velcro about 3/4 of what's available. The grey color is a nice dark grey."
4.0,Was for husband and I am wearing it!! I am a small/medium
4.0,Esta bonito me quedo perfecto
4.0,"A very nice bra. The one drawback is the two straps meld together, eliminating the effect of the two separate straps."
4.0,Good quality product for this type of stretchy belt. I think the woven style in this kind of belt does not work as well as some of their other models. I’m still happy with it though.
4.0,Wouldve liked them to be a bit larger frame but love the light pink lens.
4.0,The belt looks great. It has the unusual feature of the end passing under the rest of the belt. It it just a little bit strange feeling as a result.
4.0,this was a gift and the person loved it.
4.0,Was a bit smaller than what I thought.
4.0,Love these shirts. I got 2 of them...they both fit great. Get your normal size. Super comfy buuuut they do pill a little after a couple of washes.
4.0,"I bought this suit for my 17 year old daughter.  It is very pretty and is made very well.  The bottom fit perfectly.  The top however, is very small.  My daughter is a B cup and generally wears a small or size 2 in most things.  I wish we could have ordered a size up just in the top."
4.0,"Great shirt!  I love the pattern, I have a Yamaha Wolverine and wanted a shirt that had simple writing on it.  Got an XL and it's a little on the small size after I washed it.  It's ok though because I stretched it a little bit and it fits fine now."
4.0,Kinda long and weird looking on my face. Great materials though!
4.0,"I bought this for my mother who has kidney disease.  I wanted a way to remind her to take a drink of water every 15 minutes until it became a  natural habit for her.  It worked well for that purpose.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the battery degrades quickly over time if you allow it to drain all the way to 0%. The instructions that came with the device do recommend recharging at 20%, but that was not always possible. Overall, a nice product though."
4.0,"For the price, these are not bad.  I've had one that got a fray in the leg elastic the first time I wore them, but the rest seem fine.  There are 3 strips of elastic on the legs, so I guess partially losing one strand isn't THAT big of a deal, especially considering that these things cost just over $1 a pair.  I think they do run a little small, but they also stretch out a little after you've worn them a bit.  Not enough to slip off or anything, but just enough to make them more comfortable.  I didn't notice any shrinkage in the wash, either.  Overall, they're good enough for the money.  I would buy them again."
4.0,Very cute. Fit well. Pill easily though
4.0,Love this ring.  Looks like the pic.  Wears really well.  I haven't taken it off since I got it.  It looks cute as a set and great with just the diamond 3 stones.  Feels great on too !!
4.0,This skirt is super cute but it’s extremely short and at least two sizes too small.
4.0,Silky polyester material. Not super ideal for winters in Kentucky. Super cute for pics though. I would purchase again. Make sure to size up.
4.0,Gift my daughter it was her first piece of jewelry big frozen fan
4.0,"The blouse is pretty and I would recommend. I have a fairly long torso, but it came exactly to my waist. The look was good, but functionally it made for a struggle not to show my mid area when moving."
4.0,"Nice stretchy material. Straps are super thin though, not sure how they’ll hold up?"
4.0,Im 5'2 about 175lbs and I was swimming in the medium. Added photo of my body under it. I have an hourglass figure but this was not hitting in the right places. The dress doesn't have any shape to it so it was loose on my hips and baggy in my midsection so small would probably be perfect. Size down if you want it to hug your body like the pix. The dress has a higher neck than pictured so no cleavage and not very flattering so I'd never wear it without the sweater. The bottom of the arms are open with a button at the wrist to keep it on. Would have preferred full sleeves as it feels weird with your arms getting a breeze underneath but it doesn't look bad at all. Its a thick material that's actually warm. Overall worth the money.
4.0,Really for $2 how can you go wrong. They are a bit dark but these are definitely worth the money. Value on steroids.
4.0,Very nice. Solid and no issues in workmanship you might expect from 10$ shades
4.0,"It’s holding up better than I thought it would. It seemed kinda thin, and the zipper didn’t look like it would work well, but so far it’s working out great! I use it everyday for the gym!"
4.0,"I would give it a 5 star if I could at this time,  I bought these as a gift for my grandson but it isn't time for him to get them yet.  But they look great and come with a nice pouch to keep them in.  They came very quickly and are clearly new and unscratched.  I will try to get back in here to update my comment after he tries them on."
4.0,Loved the masks. They are very pretty
4.0,I  like the shirt a lot I am around 170 and I have ordered a large it was a little shorter than I thought it was going but the rest of it fits pretty good. It showed up on time and was made well
4.0,very lightweight and very visible bike/trike riders
4.0,"I bought this hat because I needed something that would shield my face from the sun better than a baseball hat.  This hat worked well for that purpose.  It is well made and has survived its first summer with me.  I have hiked in it, swam in it, soaked it in water to keep cool, done heavy yard and house maintenance labor in it, washed it several times (in cold water by hand, hang dry, it did not shrink) and stuffed it in any number of bags for travel.  The pictures I attached are after all of these activities.  My one compliant is that I don't like the lighter coloring on the inside of the hat, but this is obviously just a cosmetic issue for me (which is also why it only got four stars).  Otherwise this hat is great at a good price. One other note the hat is 100% cotton so won't dry as quickly as hats made with synthetic material, but I prefer the cotton."
4.0,"This is a fatastic comfy, casual summer dress! It's cute and flattering and it has POCKETS!!! I've had clothes made out of this kind of material before and they didn't wash up super well, so we'll see how long it hold up, but for now I'm happy with it! For reference, I'm 5'3'' and 115lbs wearing a size small."
4.0,Love this coat! So light weight but so warm! Feels like a teddy bear skin coat. My daughter loves petting it as well while I load her in the car seat.
4.0,"My husband was in the market for a new belt as his was beat to smitherens. Leather is obviously very durable and defiently the best looking. So this was a wonderful purchase, We have had it for a few months now and its held up well for the abuse he puts it through (hes a construction worker) Obviously we dont want to spend a fortune on a nice looking belt becasue it would be a waste. So it was a great investment!"
4.0,"Cute, small and dainty! Perfect for everyday wear I haven’t had any issues so far."
4.0,I ordered small because I knew it would probably fit big... I was correct... the top came as a small but the bottoms say xs... fortunately I’m small so it fit fine... I’ll order more... material is slightly stiff but I’ll steam it...
4.0,"Very flattering and good quality for the price. Comfortable, soft material. Size is pretty true to what is listed in the details section as far as what size you should order based on what size you wear in US sizes."
4.0,ok except the little toe is huge!
4.0,"This shirt came with Walmart tags. So, I was disappointed when I realized I over paid for a shirt a that came from Walmart."
4.0,"It’s comfortable, not to crazy about the material, but I think that’s just personal preference."
4.0,This bra is beautiful once you get the correct size. I had to order 3 band sizes up! But once I figured that out I love it!! Very comfortable and supportive without underwire!! I'm very pleased indeed!!
4.0,Softness.  A little shorter than expected.  Quick service!
4.0,"I’m 5 feet 120 pounds I’m usually a size 3/4 in dresses I ordered a small. I wear a b for bra size the fit around the breast was perfect and straps were also a good fit, the waist was a little too big. If the waist would have been 2 inches smaller would have been perfect. But the dress is cute and good quality so I decided to keep it. There were just a few fly away strings you will have to cut off also around buttons but overall worth the price."
4.0,"These flip-up sunglasses are as advertised - good quality and large enough to cover my style of glasses. The only reservations are based on previous similar flip-ups, that the clips will eventually leave marks on the eyeglasses (not really a problem) and that the flip-up detent mechanism which locks the eyewear in the up or down position will eventually wear and become ineffective. At the price, these are excellent buys and could be replaced in a year or two. Recommended.<br />The original pair of sunglasses have held up very well - I ordered a second set as a backup."
4.0,Super cute! I wore it as part of my Hamburglar costume this past Halloween. I’m 5’3 & 160 lbs. & I ordered a large. I will say that the bottom fabric (the black) is kind of heavy.
4.0,Nice but very  very long. Have to bend a lot
4.0,Nice color and very comfortable but neckline is somewhat low.
4.0,"Absolutely no care instructions whatsoever so when I get the courage to try throwing it in the machine I'll edit my review with the results haha but looked fantastic and fit line a glove. Made of slightly stretchy material making it hug all the right places. Also, bottom heart button did not line up with it's button hole - like at all - but easy fix for a person who knows how to sew buttons lol<br /><br />Edit: I do machine wash this item. I've only thrown it in the dryer once though. I hang it to dry and iron as needed on a medium heat."
4.0,"For the price, this is a great deal for a shirt of this quality. Fabric is much thicker and higher quality than what I had expected, and is common, for a shirt at this price point. Fabric is a little stiff out of the package, but that is expected. A couple wears and a good ironing will bring it around perfectly. This thicker/stiffer fabric is desirable to prevent the &#34;ballooning&#34; effect thin fabric shirts can have around the armpits and waste when moving around. This shirt lays much better and compliments the modern slim fit cut.<br />Stitching is also solid and I do not foresee any issues.<br /><br />Couple things to keep in mind. The color scheme of the &#34;blue&#34; shirt is actually teal and and the lines are more yellow than they appear in the picture. Not to the point that it looks weird, I still like the color combo a lot, but just something to know going in.<br /><br />The other thing is the sizing. I usually wear a medium and ordered a large to avoid the &#34;tight fit&#34;  as stated in the description. At 5' 9&#34; 170lbs and a normal build, I wear a 40-42 suit; the large was too big, even for a regular fit. I will be exchanging this for a medium. It appears these shirts fit true to size. I would say order you normal size for a standard sleek fitting shirt (not tight) and go one size larger if you like to have a much more relaxed fit shirt, although I don't see the point of ordering a slim fit cut shirt if you want a relaxed fit.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, though I reviewed this based on the asking price on Amazon."
4.0,"Adorable dress, excellent quality for the price. I would definitely buy from this company again. Fun and flirty dress that still fits into office party appropriate category."
4.0,"SOOOO CUTE!! Just too small. Purchased the XXL, wear size 12, got it on and zippered but was waaaay too tight to actually wear :( definitely get it if you can!"
4.0,"I really love this skirt! It fits pretty well (isn't quite &#34;floor-mopping&#34; and a little tight in the waist, but not to the point where I have a muffin-top or anything), and it's absolutely gorgeous! It's very voluminous and flowy, and makes me feel like a Disney princess, which I'm pretty sure every girl wants XD Aside from the slight fitting issue (for reference, I'm 5'3&#34;, 115 lbs, and ordered a medium), the color isn't quite as dark and rich as in the photo. It's still a lovely red, but it really isn't burgundy. Still, I absolutely adore this skirt and would definitely recommend it!"
4.0,Not as big as I thought but really nice 2 gifts and also included a soft and hard case with cleaning material. Very nice
4.0,"It’s on the big sode, but very cute. My daughter liked it, but again too big to fit on a bracelet"
4.0,"This purchase was made for my daughter and she actually liked how it fits on her. She really thought it was befitting for her hanging out with her friends for the Saturday. I thought that the material was thinner than the picture displayed, but she very pleased."
4.0,These are the softest leggings and fit so well.  Glad I bought 2 pairs!
4.0,"Vuarnet makes great quality polycarbonate lenses, too...the price is amazing...i just wish that the product description mentioned the lens color...i didn't know if Brown/yellow meant the lens or the frames...the lens is gray, would've preferred brown, but that's ok..."
4.0,"I am going as Hiesenburg for Halloween, these are almost perfect. The lense does cut short on the side, I think that's how it's supposed to be though. It looks great in the mirror. In general, the sun glasses you need are the kind that wrap around your face."
4.0,Nice looking item. One side stays fastened but other side comes apart
4.0,Well made and comfy to wear. Quality is okay for the price I paid
4.0,[[VIDEOID:5cd3e4d7df9f463ec94c41635c69722f]] These are cute. Made well. Substantial fabruc. But you get 8 not 10 as heading says. Took one star for a little deceptive title.  Other than that highly recommend
4.0,"Look like the picture, super cute.  My only problem with the shoes, is that one strap is tighter than the other.  I will have to make the looser strap tighter, but other than that, the shoes are perfect.  Plus, I love the fact that the soles have a rubber grip."
4.0,Hard bottoms but they don't hurt at all so I'm fine with them. Nothing to write home about but OK.
4.0,"They're pretty good and comfy only real problem is cleaning them, want your feet always clean before putting these on or wear socks too. My girlfriend would just wear them when ever and they got dirty inside and was hard to clean."
4.0,"I made a mistake on size.  I fixed the back for a curve.  Otherwise, I got a lot of compliments."
4.0,"Looks sturdy, quality and beautiful. Not too bulky.<br /><br />My contacts broke and I'm currently away from home, out of state for a few more weeks. So finding these glasses on Amazon has been a wonderful, economical solution. Not sure why they only sell reading glasses at stores but no DISTANCE. And why amazon makes it so difficult to find and filter: no distance vs. Reading glasses, no strength grade.<br /><br />I see a big difference with then on, so they work. But i plan to return them because they don't have higher strengths over -4.0 and my vision is still slightly blurry. It's unfortunate they don't offer more vision range."
4.0,Look great but very hard to get into tragus piercings
4.0,The shirt itself is great and I like it very much....only problem is that the small is super small so I can't really wear it.
4.0,"Simple and useful. I don't like the inside pockets, sometimes things get caught. Otherwise, inexpensive and useful."
4.0,Excellent and interchangeable
4.0,"These are cute, affordable sandals. I sent them to summer camp with my stepdaughter I will say that the leather is not very convincing, it does overall look fairly cheap. However I do not expect her to wear them forever, and they might not even last the summer, which is alright. They filled a need that I had!"
4.0,It's not 100% like the real bag.
4.0,"Love the quality of these items, however they were a bit small for me even at XL.  Would like to get notified  if they come in larger size."
4.0,I like the look and the length.
4.0,"Nice hat, but this was purchased for my husband.  It would only fit a man with a very small head.  I am a woman, and it was too tight on me."
4.0,Decent product for money
4.0,Beautiful tie for a great price. My only complaint is that they did not place the fabric so you can see a full flower on the front of the tie.
4.0,get rid of the red and its 5 stars but the red looks out of place.
4.0,Compliments every time I wear them.
4.0,not as good as basico
4.0,Loved everything about it except it doesn't fit and i got a 3x. Guess it will fit better once I lose some belly. 🤦🏾‍♂️
4.0,"got here in good time, looks high quality, but is soft enough to bend to size"
4.0,The suspenders stood up to the test and functioned well for suspenders. The LED portion was a letdown since the light fades as it hits the top of your shoulders. Another light source is on the back but does not do justice. I wish the light was constant throughout the length
4.0,Came in a nice box. Very nice but loger than expected. I have to find someone to shorten it a bit because the stone is too low on the chest.
4.0,"This is a well made dress. It fit a bit close , so be be sure to check the size chart. very attractive dress and i'll wear it when I'm going for a sexy look or pair it with a jacket."
4.0,"These earrings are quite pretty, actually, more pretty than I expected. The front has a sparkly design, which is actually a sticker, and a smooth border. One of the stickers is slightly crooked but it won't be noticeable when wearing the earrings. This is how I realized it was a sticker and not engraving in the metal as it appears to be. The back and inside are smooth.  The hoop is 2&quot; across and 1/2&quot; wide at the bottom. They are stamped .925, indicating silver. The clasps have a post on one side and a hinged piece with a hole on the end on the other side. You simply put the post through your ear hole and close the hinged part with the post going through the hole on the end.<br /><br />The one problem I have with them is how easily they bend. One was bent enough so that the post would not go in the hole on the hinged side. I was able to bend it down so it now will attach okay and I believe will fit well and not be lost. Just be aware that you might have to adjust for a good, solid connection.<br /><br />In full disclosure, I bought these earrings at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I always give honest and informative reviews to the best of my ability."
4.0,"I like the Torege Sunglasses. They are as advertised, only the dark lens is polarized. But I like the whole package. In the semi-hard case, each lens has its own storage area. There is also a soft-pouch for the glasses along with a lanyard and cleaning cloth. Great storage case and I say great overall value for the money."
4.0,I wear a 36/38 dd bra but usually a large sports bra. I ordered extra large because of cup size. They are ok but would have been better off with a large. I do a lot of cardio days at the gym and need the girls to stay put. The bra has a lot of stretch and as I started jumping around it loosened up a bit. The bra is good but for working out don't order up a size.
4.0,Comfortable little too big.
4.0,"Beautiful bangle bracelet, very light and elegant, thinner than the photo shows"
4.0,I like the softness inside..havent w ear them yet
4.0,"LOVE this clutch, Love the hard case, it just needs to be about 2 inches longer with a deeper middle zipper pocket. Wouldn't hurt to have a card pocket too.  Wanted to carry it for every day but won't  hold all I need. Will use it for church and special events."
4.0,It was a great dress for the price. I loved the back. It is thin and some of the sequins came off just as I was trying it on. I would have gone with it but I didn't like that the slip was shorter than the dress. It would've been easy to get a tailor to add to it but I didn't have time.
4.0,"I love this product.  I didn't put five stars because apparently it was some kind of leftover item from a Dental Conference in Las Vegas Nevada (printed on reverse side pocket) and I did not know it, but I can use the zip pocket for discs if I want to and besides (chuckles) I love Las Vegas!"
4.0,So the dress looks just like the picture! It's so cute! I knocked a star off for the fit. I'm 5 feet tall 125 pounds. Measurements are 34 27 33. I order a small. Everything fit except the breast cup. :( it was way too big. I would have to wear a bombshell bra or get it altered. Other than that it's a smoking hot dress!
4.0,"I like this scarf.. very light,like the pattern and easy to style..except the shipping was so slow.."
4.0,have had this for about a month and so far it looks good and it is well put together. It does not seem to have any weak points.  It is comfortable.  The only reason for not having 5 stars is that it went through a period where the color was coming off on my skin.
4.0,Just as expected thank you
4.0,It's beautiful but the torso part is super long.
4.0,it was a gift for my sister for x-mas and she loved them and wine!
4.0,Love this top! Exactly what I thought it was going to be. The only thing I don’t like is that the flowers are. Ow fully sewn onto the shirt and once washed stuck up slightly.
4.0,"A little long for me and I am 5' 4&#34;. Material great except at bust lines it stretches thin and becomes distorted and see thru. I bought to wear around the house, I would not wear in public."
4.0,Plus size is still a bit snug for an XXL body.  But it's a costume that will only be worn once so it works!
4.0,Nice color and pattern set.
4.0,Not really oversized
4.0,"I ordered it too too bug, my mistake.  Still a cute top"
4.0,Fit was good.  Very comfortable to wear.
4.0,"My daughter loves these , lasts many wearings , only thing is many times when we try to reorder they are always out of stock."
4.0,"Screw came off after first day. Very bad quality, waste of money."
4.0,This dress is cute AND comfortable.<br />The material is soft but pretty thin which is why I gave only 4 stars.
4.0,Nice large bag but a little difficult for a small child to open at each house.  The graphics are great and the quality of the bag is good.
4.0,"Dial is very readable, love the band."
4.0,Love it! I just recommend getting one size bigger than what you’re planning on ordering. I got a large and it’s a bit smaller than I was expecting. Still great tho!
4.0,The shirt is good quality. It fits as expected. The material is very light and the characters on the shirt look really good.
4.0,Great price cute date night shirt
4.0,Beautiful will not know how it holds up until it is worn awhile
4.0,Soft. Comfortable. Fit as expected.
4.0,"I bought the Western style. These run a tad small - need to go up one size. I wear a size 7 -  tried them on with thin trouser socks and had a hard time taking them off.<br />Also,  they're made for thick calves.  Mine are slim - they fit me like the ones in photo - wish they were slimmer.<br />However, they're really cute and the chunky heel makes them pretty comfortable to walk in."
4.0,Very nice ..Thanks
4.0,Very cute and very nicely packaged. Comes in a nice black satin look box. Bracelet sits on foam with a pink cloth over it. Even comes with a really pretty card to gift it. I would post pics but Amazon access camera not working.
4.0,"Pretty cute.  A bit of a rough finish,  but they are fine for my project."
4.0,"This is adorable and fits my 14 month old perfectly.  She likes to pull on the straps, but it stays on nicely.  She looks like a mermaid and that is exactly what we needed for her Daycare performance!  I unstitched the tutu to remove it (since it is a little &quot;cheap&quot; looking), and I am going to add my own tutu to the outfit.  With the original tutu it is still really cute though."
4.0,"This a great Jacket. Fits great and looks awesome. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because the zipper got stuck once. After loosing the Zipper, it know works great again."
4.0,Nice for novelty...Would have liked a little thicker material.
4.0,"I love this shirt but it runs a size small, other than that it's beautiful!"
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress for tall and skinny girls!!...otherwise will be too small, because the dress runs small(waist and chest) and it is very long."
4.0,Very pretty and comfy cooling fabric.  Very nice!
4.0,Cool designs but they fall out easy
4.0,Not a sweatshirt material but still cute runs small
4.0,"They're definitely big right now, but I'm hopeful my son will grow into them before too long as they are absolutely adorable!"
4.0,It’s an ok blouse. Looks funny if you don’t tuck it in<br />Material isn’t stretchy. But fits true to size over good quality just not my stylw
4.0,Arrived on time color and size as described
4.0,I really like this top. I didn't get any compliments but that's ok. I wore it to work and I realized halfway through the day that the top would probably work better for a Christmas party or something.  Its very comfortable and not too thick of a material. Soft and bright red.
4.0,These goggles fit my 4 year old perfectly.  He loves them.  The only problem we had at all was that the eye lens popped out but you can easily pop it back in.  He used them all summer.  Don't let adults use these because they will stretch out the headband.  Highly recommend these for all kids ages 2 through 12.
4.0,"A bit wider than I expected, but other than that it is great.  Cool &#34;clicking&#34; locking component."
4.0,This is a good watch. The only complaint i have is the light on it. You can't see the numbers on it with the light.
4.0,Beautiful gift set for my sons girlfriend. She loved them! They are light weight and the wings are very thin so a little care is needed. Nice product for the price
4.0,"It is nice, but the legs aren't long enough so it wouldn't be a good idea to wear very high heels. If I was shorter, then this would have been 5stars."
4.0,A tad long on my 5'1 frame but that can easily be fixed by taking it to a seamstress. Beautiful green color and good stretchy fabric. Very flattering and versatile.
4.0,Like it - super soft!  Runs a bit small.
4.0,Came as picture very good product
4.0,"Needed a size smaller, a little loose."
4.0,very good quality shoe and my toddler loves them
4.0,The price was good. I have extremely sensitive skin and this did not irritate my ear/surrounding skin.  Thats how i know it was real stainless steel. However the quality isn't the best...its thin and you have to treat the hooks with great care as it can break or get warped easily. I'm glad i didn't pay more than 8.99 as i would have been extremely disappointed. It fits the purpose i.e. great for casual errands and different colors
4.0,Fabric is great. Completely not see through. I am 5ft 3 in 110lbs 34B and it hit me right above my knees. Color is as pictured.
4.0,Great but shrinks a little too much in the length...
4.0,"When they say ""Inspired by our snowboard photographer friends who use shoelaces..."", they truly mean it. This thing is basically a shoelace with some specialized ends for creating slip knots in your Moment photo case. The clasp at the top does kind of feel like it could come loose with enough pull, so I have tied a knot above it so that my phone does not fall out by accident. This was actually suggested by Moment on the product materials. Overall, I like it and it truly is minimal though I think maybe the price point is a bit high for a glorified shoelace haha. You are really paying for the specialized attachments that make it more suited to your phone & case."
4.0,This is the second one we ordered. Our Grandson liked the first one so much that we got him another one.
4.0,"I guess I need to learn to read better.  I did not  realize they were stretch material, would  have preferred cotton."
4.0,Didn't realize how much I was going to like this.  Good quality.
4.0,"Very pretty kimono to wear over a bathing suit or even a black dress. Regrettably, it doesn’t include a self belt which would’ve enhanced its versatility. I will find a long solid color polyester scarf to repurpose as a belt because I want to wear it over my black bathing suit. The print is a lovely floral. See my close up photo."
4.0,Mask works great for my job and fits comfortably. I would buy again if I ever needed a new one.
4.0,Beautiful. Easy to put on  Looks expensive
4.0,"Really enjoy this band.  Was not sure at first but it has been great for the summer.  Love that when it is hot out the band does not feel sweaty and sticky like others. Have gotten a bunch of compliments on it.  Bought the large as I have thick wrists.  The black one fit perfect.  The tie dye one was a bit tight but as I have worn it, it has stretched out a bit and fits nice.  The tie dye has become my favorite go to band.  They are a bit tricky to get on and off the watch at first."
4.0,Very shiny but nice with the right dress
4.0,"I love it ! I sure like it  matches  well with so many things , the reason i did not  give a 5 star is because i just rarely give something a five star"
4.0,"These glasses are a delight.  I bought two sets one to ride on my motorcycle and the other for daily use.  I have a relatively large head (so says my motorcycle helmet) and wanted something which would fit well yet perform as glare and sun attenuators.  These are perfect.  When I put them on the background color changes minimally basically getting rid of the sun glare.  The distance images become clearer, more sharply edged without changing color.  They are comfortable with spring loaded hinges and durable.  They have been dropped in mud, slid across a concrete floor and still no scratches.  They clean easily.  I am very pleased and recommend them highly."
4.0,"The ring is very beautiful and detailed, and I wear it pretty often. The stone isn’t as pink as in the picture, but I was sort of expecting it because I watched the short clip of the ring on display, and it wasn’t very pink there. Still very beautiful, and I’ll continue to purchase from this seller."
4.0,I’d order a size up. I did just to be safe and the shirt fit my son perfectly.
4.0,"Color accurate. Size a little tight, not much stretch. Usable, but not loving it."
4.0,Immediately upon receipt I was able to use the tool kit to change a battery in one watch and change the band length on another. Savings equals.... more than the tool kit cost. Am sure the kit will be useful for many years to come.
4.0,Missing pin on one.
4.0,"this is cute, but its a lil too big"
4.0,"Runs a little small for the size, but the shirt still drips"
4.0,I'm happy with the look the glove runs a little small. The touch finger works ok must of the time sometimes you have to try multiple times to get it to work.
4.0,I don’t have a picture but these gloves are great. Really good grip on them and overall a good glove. BUT one problem I ran into was the grip on the palm is starting to tear. I’ve had them since July and they’re already tearing but maybe it’s just because of how much I have used them.
4.0,"Im so happy I bought this swimming suit. Its different and doesn't show a lot of skin. I wear a XL and im also a lil busty so I ordered a 3X. The suit fits like a perfect glove. It shapes around my curves. I would've given a 5 star if the suit had underwire. Other than that it's pretty nice, I recommend buying from this vendor. Also, fast shipping!!!! 😁🙌👍"
4.0,"I like the unique style on this poly/spandex knit top, and it is certainly comfortable. The fabric isn't particularly flattering, and it doesn't seem particularly durable. However, for a trendy, fun knit top, it's a nice option. Great casual look that fits true to size."
4.0,"I liked the hat a lot and would have kept it if the brim were smaller.  It was light weight and attractive and you could turn up the brim and fix it however you wanted it.  It was just a little too big for me.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,"My purse came in faster than expected, however, the black stones have little scratches over them. While they are not very visible, I know the problem is there.now just so you know, the concept is beautifully thought out. The phone will hold my iPhone 6, plus a couple of other things. Overall, I am very satisfied 😌"
4.0,Its a very flowy summer dress. All and all its a cute dress just for a casual day.
4.0,Bought these and another set. The set without hinges broke after two weeks. These seem okay so far
4.0,It’s good for outside use for what I wanted but it doesn’t hold a fold or hold the rim when you change the hat.
4.0,My husband loves them. He uses them evernight to pray. They are very nice and great detail.
4.0,"I got this for my husband, he loves the design of this mask. He also said that it is quite comfortable.<br /><br />One small annoyance, the print is on both the front and the back. So, that's kind of weird."
4.0,Very very pretty but not great quality it was a little expensive for what it was.
4.0,Great value and they suit my funky sock obsession. The fit is good and the quality is on point with any other socks that are for fashion.
4.0,This bathing suit is very comfortable and full coverage. The top fits comparable to a sports bra. I like this top style because it’s very cute while providing great coverage and comfort while holding the girls in place. The rushed material also adds style. It fit as expected. I am 5’5 and 135 lbs. I’m a 34 D and the top and bottom fit me perfectly. I also love the blue. I recommend this!
4.0,Ring bearer shoes. It ran a little large but it did the trick for the wedding.
4.0,"Love the material beautiful, super cute , very comfortable"
4.0,"This is a great little dress/coverup. The material is light without being too sheer (that said, you can definitely see if you're wearing dark undies or something underneath). It's very comfortable and on my 5'2&#34; 38DD frame, the L was the perfect length and actually very flattering. Took off one star as I can tell it's not produced with the utmost quality in mind, but despite that, the material doesn't feel or look cheap, felt great on and has a beautiful pattern. Very well worth it!!"
4.0,I use these all the time. They are great but they don't fit over my glasses well and usually slip down.
4.0,"I ordered these about two weeks ago. I started reading reviews though, and a lot of them were from people who's packages were just sitting at the facility. Maybe I was lucky, my package arrived today (expected date June 2). I'm pretty happy and they're just what I expected: tongue rings."
4.0,"Great hat and a good look, just a little larger than expected."
4.0,"These are kind of pricey socks and I wish they were a bit taller (I do have very long legs though, in their defense).  That aside they are the cutest ever and super comfortable.  I don't like them quite as much as my &#34;worlds softest&#34; brand sock."
4.0,"It appears that this listing is for some heavy weight flannel shirts and also thin polyester shirts. I wanted a thin shirt. I keep losing the battle with the thermostat natzi at work (no a/c for me) but don’t like to show off much skin so lightweight button downs work the best. I ordered the black and white plaid (XL). First impression out of the bag was the material had a horrible feel. Not the soft polyester like my other shirts. The fit was nice and it was lightweight so I decided to keep it. I washed it hoping it would soften up the fabric. Maybe it did a little? More so I noticed that the shoulders and the arms of the shirt shrank significantly. I’m pretty broad in the shoulders (even when I was at my lightest) and it’s much tighter than it was when I tried it on right out of the bag.  I can still wear it but it’s not as loose as I would like. I usually wear the sleeves rolled up on these types of shirts. The tab that buttons up the sleeve is way too long but easily altered. Overall, pretty decent lightweight plaid shirt."
4.0,The Battery was wasted. Just 20 days...
4.0,Definitely has a beach cover-up feel.
4.0,"Fits really good, except the sleeves are really long and tighter for this size ordered. And the color is a really deep wine color.  More for the winter then spring or summer."
4.0,Cute necklace I bought for a friend.
4.0,I bought this product as an accessory for a dance costume. It served its intended purpose well. It's well made.
4.0,"I did not know that these ear muffs went behind your head instead of over the top. However, they work very well like that. They are easy to wear and quite warm, not sure how long they will last because they are not real heavy duty, only time will tell.They arrived on time."
4.0,Decent shoe for the price. Perfect for school uniform.
4.0,It is what you pay for. Not super high quality but our Harry Fan loved it just the same!
4.0,"These are beautiful in real life, but they start to hurt your ears after a while."
4.0,I am sending this shirt back. I think it would look good on someone with a very slim figure & no chest but although it fit my chest it was far too baggy around my belly and the collar was way too loose/big.  The material and construction is good quality though (thus the 4 stars) and I really think it would look good on the right body type. I think they really should only offer it to small and medium size body types.
4.0,"Super soft and cozy. They run a little large, but the red ribbon tie helps that situation."
4.0,Fits very tight and wears more like spandex.
4.0,This looks beautiful but it's too short and I had to buy an extender.
4.0,I like it. I thought the picture showed this dress as having a hood attached. It doesnt. Fits tighter than expected. Overall I like the dress.
4.0,"My wife liked this dress. She said it had a nice look and felt very comfortable. She thought the manufacturing quality was good, too. She said she would wear it for ""better"" casual occasions. By that she meant lunches, parties, gatherings with friends, but not grocery shopping. Also not formal occasions where evening wear is appropriate.<br /><br />While she liked most everything, and said the fit and sizing were fine, she had one problem with the cut. She thought the shoulder straps were too wide. I attached two photos, before and after. The wider strap is how the dress came. The narrower strap is how she is altering it.<br /><br />So this could be five stars overall, but it's really more like 4 and a half, so I went with 4. Your own taste about the shoulder straps could be different, of course."
4.0,"I love these underwear. They don't ride up or give wedgies but still look cute. Very comfortable. I can just never ever find them in size 4 in the stores! A lot of my pairs do have wear in the elastic- the fabric covering the elastic starts to wear away after many washings. But they do last a while. Great product overall, I hope these are never discontinued!"
4.0,I washed them in the washer in cold water and air dried and they didn't shrink a bit.  They dry quickly.
4.0,Product was delivered as advertised. However the small plastic card on which it was attached stated it was sterling silver. The charm stated it was stainless steel (which is what I bought).
4.0,"I cannot stress how beautiful this dress is and how comfortable it is. I normally wear a small but sometimes have to size up to a medium bc my arms are kinda big. I'm also currently pregnant. So I decided to def size up to a medium this time. Good thing bc the dress fits like a gloves but the material is so nice that it doesn't feel like I'll tear at the seams. It's really perfect. I am concerned about the stones that I may lose a few before the night is over bc they are glued on and while trying it on 1 fell off. I feel tho that as long as it's minimal shedding it won't be noticable at all. Again this is perfect for what I need. **UPDATE** I didn't lose any of my gold stones, the dress was amazing, and compliments were endless. Would highly recommend this dress/seller  !"
4.0,"Ordered a medium and it fits perfectly- 5'5, 135 lbs, and I don't  like super tight clothes- the medium looks fitted and not baggy or &#34;too big&#34;. Length brushes the ground with flats even after machine wash (cold/delicate) and dry (low heat)  Surprised the fabric is 95% cotton 5% spandex!!!! Feels amazingly soft and airy, not cheap in the least. I have a similar style that's polyester and spandex and REALLY prefer this fabric to the other.  Took one star because the waist band has a crooked bit on one side but I plan to wear it with a belt anyway- it's only really noticeable if you are looking for it."
4.0,"Fits well, pretty"
4.0,As the day goes on the magnet seems to slide a bit so have to readjust a couple times per day. Not a deal breaker for me but might be for others
4.0,Didn’t come with feather duster
4.0,"This is cute! I am a size 14, curvy, large chest, 5'4&#34;, about 185 -- however while I have shortish legs, I am long waisted - from neck to crotch.  So this was to short waisted for me.  Not very generous sizing, no big deal but I'd say err on the side of getting one size larger, ladies and gents.  Nice color, fun cut."
4.0,would buy again but the fabric quality could be better
4.0,Got it as a gift and my friend loved it
4.0,"This item is very nice, of great quality, especially for the price. Unique and really cute, takes a while to get to ya but totally worth it!"
4.0,The dress is great it could definitely go without the little metal button keeping it from a being a line you should just sew it and leave out the metal ring.
4.0,Cute jersey dress. Needed a green dress for a 1930s costume and this works.
4.0,Hard to see second hand
4.0,"Left lens too close to face, rubs against eyelashes.<br />Seller contaced me to make this right! I really appreciated this."
4.0,"Theyre real elegant and pretty. I purchased the silver leaf pair. Yes it is a pair. 2 of them. The only thing I dislike is theres only one side to the leaf. The back side is hollowed out so when it dangles, your gonna see the hollow side as well as the solid side instead of it being a full solid leaf. Thay2 and clasp seems real fragile. So try and limit the bending on it to where it fits your ear well. They are pretty though. I think my chain is longer than what shows. I were it higher up the ear so it wasnt so low."
4.0,"Buying  underwear on Amazon? Sounds a little sketchy, but I saw these recommended on some website and decided to try. They're good everyday underwear and have held up well for the several months I've had them. They do run a little bit big - not enough to select a different size, but know they'll fit just a little loose."
4.0,"Wife likes teal, fits the Charge 2.  She likes it."
4.0,It works better the one I used before. Built better.
4.0,"These are comfortable flipflops but they are very narrow. Either that or I have really wide feet.  Not really, but if someone does, their feet may hang over the sides."
4.0,"The community I am living in currently has a tennis court, and I wanted to mark which key was for that gate. I don't know what other reason anyone would have for ordering a tennis racket and ball keychain, actually, unless you just generally love tennis and/or are Serena Williams.<br /><br />It is about what you think it will be, I just so so so so wished the little ball had been fuzzy like a tennis ball, thus the four stars."
4.0,love this but the glue that holds the button that closes the wallet isnt letting the wallet close
4.0,"I love how simple and petite this case is. It's well made with a beautiful polish. Although it was expensive for the size , I'm happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I was sceptical to purchase this item because there were no previous reviews, but I’m glad I did. Everything is wonderful. The fit is great. The only issue I had is that it is very thin. Definitely a jacket for fashion, and not for keeping warm."
4.0,"Pretty design for large women. Being petite and seemingly shrinking every year, I find this shirt pretty  but large.  The fabric is good for the heat of summer but I don't like black in summer. I hope it's warm enough in winter as its very pretty and I hope pairing with leggings will look nice.<br /><br />It's long for 5'1&#34; but should be great for average or tall women who look good in black. The flow is best described as, lovely."
4.0,Item came fast overpriced
4.0,"A small was a little roomy/flowy, but comfortable. I think it's supposed to fit as such though. Great colors, looks same as pictured!"
4.0,I loved the cut and style of this dress. The front comes up a bit shorter than I expected but I have long legs so that could play a role in it. This dress is perfect for a winery or a dinner party in the fall. I’m looking forward to wearing it out!
4.0,"Fits pretty well except I feel the arms are a bit short, never been a fan of capped sleeves, bought in a pinch for a graduation. The other part I didn’t love was this is supposed to be a wrap style dress, it’s only wrapped in the breast area &permanently fixed so it wasn’t really giving the cleavage I was hoping i’d Have, if u try to adjust it by pulling it down on one side it looks all bunched on the stomach area below the boobs. I do think it’s a good fit for my figure as the busy pattern helps blend u & the way the waist come in and skirt flares out, gives a hourglass effect. I hate anything that defines my muffin top so I am very critical about that particular area of a dress. All in all it’s cute, probably a good shore dress, maybe summer picnic. I’d wear a Shaw over the sleeves cause I hate them it just digs in ur armpit."
4.0,"The material is very soft and not too thick. I live in Florida, so I don't need anything super thick. It's very difficult to find a cardigan that's thin, but doesn't feel cheap -- and this one accomplishes just that. I also love that the buttons are covered in the same fabric as the cardigan itself so they're sort of camouflaged as (in my experience) some jacket buttons can look quite ridiculous. The only down sides are that the sleeves are a bit short and I can't button the jack closed. The sleeves stop about 3 inches from my wrists, but I roll them up half the time anyway, so it's not so noticeable. I don't really mind that I can't close the jacket because my chest is what's stopping it and those with a smaller chest might not have the same issues. Overall though, this is a great cardigan though!"
4.0,My son is very sensitive to fabrics and these pants for comfortable for him. The only problem was that he didn't like the white pattern on the pants.
4.0,"They are nice and soft but a little thin.  Short socks that don't come up too high.  Several inches but that's it.  Not sure how they will hold up.  I doubt if they will last more than a year but time will tell. For the price they are just fine because cashmere is not cheap.  However, there was nothing on the package that would indicate the percentage of wool or cashmere so I don't really know the fiber content or percentage which is odd.  I think that is a requirement in the U.S. but probably not in China where I believe these are manufactured.  Anyway, they feel like a cashmere wool blend and are performing as such.  I do find cashmere and wool to develop much less foot odor at the end of the day walking a lot and they are doing that so yes, they probably are wool cashmere and they are substantially warmer and cozier than cotton too of course. . ."
4.0,Quality is good seem like they will last. The run a 1 size small
4.0,I love this product I previously purchased it elsewhere and when I looked for it again I found it on amazon for a friend
4.0,"Fit about 8 cards.  Very function, only drawback is it's hard to remove cards to use them.  Overall very satisfied and I would recommend it!"
4.0,"Unfortunately, it was too short for me. (I'm 58) but I loved the style and how the material was not clingy. It was well made and and the color was exactly as pictured. The material is kind of like linen so it would be cool in hot weather. The dip of the underarm is also very low and as I would want to wear it when hot out, it would need a tank under it."
4.0,"For $3, this is a nice bracelet. Arrived earlier than originally stated and my daughter loves it"
4.0,Not so easy to adjust
4.0,"I just received today. I got Xlarge bikini, top is little big and bottom is not bad. My actually size is medium. But I love that bikini because it covers my belly and style. I will do sew it to make little small.<br /><br />I did received this product free or at a discount and I am reporting my honest review."
4.0,My wife loves this 50s style dress spinning around the house all day I was very pleased and she looks perfect in it!!
4.0,"Glitziest Women's Shell Bracelet Hawaiian Jewelry is delicate and attractive. The combination of blue and white is particularly pretty.<br /><br />It is held together by what is described as high quality elastic cord and durable rope.  This is what is most important because there are a lot of small pieces strung together. The outside unstretched diameter measures 2.5 inches and this bracelet fits comfortably on my 5.5 inch wrist.<br /><br />Glitziest Women's Shell Bracelet Hawaiian Jewelry, Blue, is a nice summer bracelet.  The .375 inch wide pieces are smooth and not at all jagged making it a comfortable as well as attractive accessory."
4.0,I like it but it is a little too small and the padding is too thick but just take it out and your good.
4.0,"Looks great, good quality.  It appears slightly large."
4.0,Fits nicely and comfortable too.  Light weight and hardly notice I'm wearing it while playing tennis with sun protection.
4.0,"The ad says 'pink', and I was sent a slumber cap in BLUE. While the elastic is slightly tight, it does stay on my hair while I sleep after putting my hair up on foam rollers."
4.0,Very loose fit.  Have to find someone to adjust/tighten for me.
4.0,Kept me warm.  Made for somebody with a giant beach ball head
4.0,The colors are wrong. It looks like two different colors on the monitor. But when I received the bracelet the pearls are both the same color Ivory. I have an 8 inch wrist its okay for the size but it would look better not so stretched out on a smaller wrist.
4.0,Love this cute stackable fashion ring!  Looks so cute on!  I wore it alone and got lots of compliments!
4.0,Gave it a 4 cause of the material.
4.0,"I ordered Large, and being from China, I assumed they would run small.  They DO NOT.  The Large size is actually Large/XLarge.  There is not a lot of spandex; they won't hold you in or compress your fat parts, so they are quite comfortable to wear.  I usually wear a size 12-14 jean (hips 42&#34;).  They have the wide, non-elastic waistband, which is not constricting, if waistbands are a problem for you.  They seem to be well made.  They feel velvety soft and I really like the side inset panel.  The Large/XLarge has a little too much slack for me, and the next time I will order the Medium.  These are great for relaxing without feeling like you're in leg bondage.  My preference is just a little more spandex, but I will keep these and order a Medium next time and see how it goes.  It took almost 3 weeks coming from China, but the shipping is FREE, so why complain?  Who's in that big a rush?"
4.0,i like this bracelet a lot but the only bad this is that you cant get it wet otherwise you cant pull the strings to tighten it or make it loose.
4.0,It is made very well.  I like the amount of pockets it has.I like the adjustable strap.  I just wish it was a little taller.
4.0,I feel it could have fit better if the thing part of the sandal was brought a little more forward. The bow is super cute I love them overall
4.0,My daughter loves these. I wish they came in a lighter pink.
4.0,The fit is perfect except for the length. Its not as long as the picture makes it look. Maybe my daughter is too tall but it ends above her ankles. Still beautiful and soft and she loves it!
4.0,"There to long for flats, but mid heal ankle boots are perfect!😊"
4.0,It’s a nice dress and I really like I.  The material is really wrinkled.  The chest part doesn’t stay down. It’s always riding up and I have to pull it back down.  Other than that it’s very nice
4.0,looks like nice quality
4.0,They did the job- I had to re-pierce an ear. Dainty and good looking. I’ve had them on for a mth so the hike doesn’t close and they don’t bother me.
4.0,"Disinfect woth barbicide, not alcohol, cause it eats at the ends (balls)"
4.0,I usually wear a size 7 sometimes a 71/2 and ordered a 71/2. The shoes were way to small.  After returning the shoes i ordered an 81/2 and is a little roomy but no longer crunching my toes and much more comfortable.
4.0,Cute gift for a little girl.  Came in a nice glitter box.
4.0,"I'm sure this is a great bag. I couldn't use it because it was surprisingly heavy, which made it very unwieldy."
4.0,Sufficiently adjustable that me and my ten year old son can both wear them on our walks. Quite comfortable!
4.0,"I was hesitant to get the black/rose gold with my space gray watch, but it turned out beautifully.  The band is thinner than what I had hoped and the leather creased the very first time I buckled the strap.  I have had no issues with the band to date, but I ended up buying additional sport straps because I knew that this band wouldn't last long if I wore it around the clock. Now I reserve it for dressier outfits and use sport bands for everything else. Pro - looks great for the price. Con - not made to last"
4.0,I really love it but I am 5 foot nine and this is pretty short on me
4.0,I got it for someone who loves nightmare before Christmas and I think this is great
4.0,Their actually heavy to be small but the quality is great.
4.0,"These Giotto yoga socks run small. But they do feel good on. When ordering from the drop-down box, it states size ""5-1/2 to 9 shoe"" which I selected because I wear a size 8 woman's shoe. However, the heel was between my heel and the center of my foot. Can you imagine how disappointed we size 8 or 9 customers are with ill fitting yoga socks? Very disappointing. Socks definitely need to be made longer for this size range. Since the Shelter-in-Place has taken over our lives, I've been doing yoga and workouts from the internet instead of driving to the gym. So we've started putting together a home gym (still working on it) which is in the basement on concrete floors. Cold...brrrr....need socks! I have Raynauld's Syndrome so very sensitive to cold. So I need more and more socks that fit, by golly!"
4.0,These are great but the XL is pretty tight...thank goodness I have chicken legs or this would have been a problem.
4.0,"Just slightly thinner than apple, but they're pretty decent bands my husband loves them and doesn't seem to have any problems."
4.0,"These fit well, they are soft, and very comfortable."
4.0,Maybe it’s because I use too much lotion and baby oil I try to keep the skin completely clean in that area when I use them but it seems like it keeps loosening up could be my fault
4.0,"4 star because it was way to big, order your size, i had to put a stitch in the back to make it fit and i love it, not at all see through, i get all kind of compliments!"
4.0,"Good buy. Looks great and keeps good time. Had an initial issue, but the seller took care of it quickly."
4.0,"Watch face nice and crisp as I had hoped.  The band is basic leather, looks kinda chinsey, but thinking about replacing the band and making this inexpensive watch face look high end."
4.0,Not enough coverage for me. I liked the high leg snd the cutout top but decided I wanted more rear  coverage and more support on top.
4.0,Love the watch but the band is way too small but purchased 22 mm crome extenders and the watches are fine . Not for big men .
4.0,I likef the dress but I didn't get my belt with it ...
4.0,Awesome quality. The double stick is very nice. Very pleased. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice looking belt. And being able to adjust is pretty sweet as well.
4.0,"Absolutely Beautiful skirt, got tons of compliments on it. It is quite tight around the waist so I would suggest either getting the next size up or wearing something underneath (tights, leggings, a tucked-in top, etc.) so it isn't completely constraining you."
4.0,"The dress fits well, it is pretty.  However I didn't give 5 stars because it doesn't hold the shape shown in picture, you would need a hoop skirt.  It also came very wrinkled.  It washes and irons well, but it did take a bit of work."
4.0,Like it a lot.  The only exception is the bottom hem opening is a tad narrow. No wide strides in this dress.  Fit is great thru the body.
4.0,Elmaterial del estampado es muy ajustado
4.0,"More beautiful than pictured.  New leather watch and very stiff, though, which is why the 4.  Would definitelyshop again."
4.0,Slightly smaller than expected.
4.0,Like IT! Thanks
4.0,"I am 5'9"" and weigh about 150lbs. I ordered an XL and it was one size too large. I put it in the dryer and it fits pretty well now. The dress hits right above my knees (not exactly knee length). It is a bit large on top still, but fits well everywhere else. I love the pockets and the pattern. The are both true to the picture. Overall, not a bad buy for under $10."
4.0,"FABULOUS FABULOUS NORMA K GENIUS MATERIAL ,SO FLATTERING ,WASHES SO BRILLIANTLY ..BUT THEY RUN REALLY LONG ! I AM 5'5 AND I AM GOING TO NEED TO GET THEM SHORTENED TO WEAR WITH FLATS  ,THEY ARE HOWEVER  THE  BEST QUALITY MONEY CAN BUY AND BOY DOES IT SHOW ,I JUST LOVE HER STUFF ,I HAVE THE GOTURTLE  TO MATCH AND LIVE IN THIS LOOK ,CLASSIC ,TIMELESS ,CLASSY ,I CAN GO TO THE ANYWHERE IN THESE AND NOT FEEL SCRUFFY IT'S THE CUT AND THE FABRIC ,PERFECT"
4.0,"These are cute but not as brightly colored as the picture.  For the price, they are great!"
4.0,"A bit see through in spots, but if you wear non patterned underwear you should be fine. The dress is sheer, so it is breathable for the summer. Got lots of compliments. The pattern is awesome. The buttons do come all the way undone if you would like to make a more risky neckline or slit at the bottom."
4.0,They are very cute and good quality although some had marks on them and if you touch them they may get brown marks as well. Overall a good product though!
4.0,I ordered one size up and the fit was very good.  Extremely nice suit for a very low price.  Have only tried it on and not yet gotten it wet.  Will use for a vacation planned a few weeks from now.
4.0,"Love it! comfy and looks good with sneakers or sandals. I am 5'4&#34;, 150lbs. and the medium fit me perfectly."
4.0,Very beautiful cover up.  You cannot wear as a dress because it’s too sheer.  It runs very small.
4.0,Warm and full of fashion.
4.0,"Price, price, price"
4.0,"Got the 10mm for my cartilage piercings. Fit perfectly! I had no complaints for the few months they lasted. Never snagged my hair, and never came out. Just had to toss them, the inside part of the ring that hangs down and visible was tarnished so bad! Silver jewelry cleaner didn’t remove it. Overall, happy with the price and how long they lasted."
4.0,"For $18, you will have a difficult time finding something better.<br /><br />4 stars because the bag is a little too wide to carry along everywhere. The plastic for the arm handle makes noise when you walk."
4.0,"These are adorable! Little bit difficult to get in, but its manageable once you get the hang of it!"
4.0,These glasses look great and they arrived with a hard case as well as a lens cleaning cloth case. I left off a star because of personal preference. The lens are a little too dark for my comfort and I discovered that polarized lenses cancelled my car's OHD.
4.0,"Good fit, quick dry, has pockets, super lightweight, drawstring, great price. They’re shorts and the description is accurate. Good deal."
4.0,"Pleasantly comfy fit, but any poly is always too warm for me.  Typically 100 percent cotton is hard to find."
4.0,Pretty case. I received it 3 weeks before excepted.
4.0,"A measure of success for any author is an improvement in craft and storytelling from one book to the next. Prystauk's ""Bloodletting"" created characters of great distinction, and subverted the traditional notions of Noir (for as much as I love ya, I'm lookin' at you, Hard Case Crime) by making alternative-lifestyle PI Denny Bowie and his lovers, Erin and Penny, adherents of the BDSM subculture. Overall, it was a satisfying novel that teased at the possibility of a greater world of unique mysteries. Working from ""Bloodletting""'s foundation, ""Punishment"" serves up a fresh tale that's full of page-turning intrigue. Prystauk's prose is more streamlined and engaging here, expanding on the characterizations of our central trio, and the denizens of the BDSM subculture they encounter during their investigation of a series of brutal, domme-driven murders. I was struck immediately by the focused, well-paced storytelling, which is as strategic and deliberate in establishing three-dimensional characters as it is in giving casual readers an empathetic window into alternative lifestyles. It's telling of Prystauk's own character, as creator of this world, that even moments that could have come off as cheap shock value (and there are a few humdingers in ""Punishment"") resonate with drama, despair, and heartbreak. Another measure of authorial success? When a slow reader like myself actively carves out time to make it just a couple pages further. Rife with suspense and unsuspecting humor, ""Punishment"" is a more than worthwhile trip, and I'm eager to see where Prystauk takes these characters next.<br /><br />(review cross-posted from Goodreads - JGW)"
4.0,"We ordered a larger size because we've found that most of the Frank Turner t-shirts run small. I would say go one size up, at a minimum. We went two sizes up & this did shrink, but is still a little big. But, that's OK. My hubby likes it."
4.0,"well... i returned it. i can see what such a number of buyers really like this wallet but it just wasn’t for me.<br /><br />at a glance, the wallet seems well-made, the magnet was powerful, and my cards all fit securely.<br /><br />i’ve previously used a 10-year-old kenneth cole reaction front pocket wallet with a clear license slot on one side and a second slot for credit cards (as well as a traditional money clip) on the other side. over the years it’s grown thicker and thicker as i stuff more cards into it (now totally +/- 12) but never any longer/wider.<br /><br />this napawalli was substantially longer/wider than i’ve grown accustomed to and thus a poor fit for my needs/pocket. i also found the crazy horse khaki to be lighter and tanner than pictured - also not for me. i wanted something richer brown.<br /><br />sorry for being picky, amazon, but for an item that will be in my pocket and hands multiple times everyday it has to be just right.<br /><br />(i’m fighting the urge to sample one of these expensive minimalist “the ridge” wallets as $75 seems a little steep. only time will tell if i win that battle...)"
4.0,"Not really great material for it’s price. Got a better deal at an actual store, almost half of the price"
4.0,Love that they’re mostly cotton.  They are a little thin so hope they last
4.0,If it's very tightly on the garmin active for watch band but i guess that helps it stand place . It takes a little bit to fill out all the information on the website . Kind of wish there was a way anyone could access it just not first responders . That kind of water is me that i am might be in a place where the first responder doesn't have access to it
4.0,"Perfect for warm days at the office. Light weight, appropriate coverage (not see through) and soft feel"
4.0,"I got these for an anime convention costume, and I must say they suited that purpose nicely. However, throughout the day the fingertips did start fraying already, and that was the only time I had worn them. They're really cheap, but with that price I'm not sure what else to expect."
4.0,I liked these yoga pants but they did not fit as I expected. They were a very tight XL. :-(
4.0,"These earrings are just the right size for my very petite 2yo. Dainty and not too heavy on her ears. They would be 5 stars if they were easier to fasten, but endless hoop earrings are ALWAYS difficult to close. They're hard to open, too, though, so she shouldn't be able to remove them on her own, and that is what I wanted. She is always pulling the backs off of regular earrings and losing either the earring or the back, even with screw-back children's earrings, so I thought we'd give endless hoops a try. Also, because they're endless hoops, there are no pointy earring backs to poke her, so they are much more comfortable. They would probably be a pain to get closed on your own ear, because you are trying to put a tiny wire in a tiny hole, and you can't see either if you're putting them on yourself. Also, the quality seems pretty good. Dainty, yes, but not flimsy."
4.0,"I have a slim body, but have been cursed with large thighs. This makes my body very difficult to fit, so it appears that this pant has become the answer to my prayers! The reason why I gave it only four stars is because it is advertised as an ankle pant. I'm 5'5&#34; and had to cut several inches off in order to make them become an ankle pant."
4.0,Perfect for our little ones first birthday. This has a snug fit so it is a little difficult to get over the head but is very soft and made of a performance ware fabric that cleans very easy and does not shrink when washed. I only hang dry.
4.0,Great Halloween prop. Can’t wait to use it next year.
4.0,"Love the distinguished look of the watch.  A little light to my liking, but looks great with any professional attire.  Functions well."
4.0,I am pretty happy with this perches. I like that it looks hi end and not like custom jewelry. Wish the purple was more brit it just looks like a light blue.
4.0,good stuff. Watch out for the runs
4.0,This bag looks good although the trim design may not be the best scale for such a large bag. This bag packs my laptop and on short business trips (2 days or less) holds my toiletries and clothes. Very functional. The biggest challenge with this bag is that it does not fly well. It is not very heavy but rather heavy and I cannot roll it through the cabin on the airplanes because it is too wide for those narrow passages. Result is that I end up carrying that heavy bag to my seat and that's major pressure for me. Complete oscillating wheels may help by allowing carriage through cabin on narrow side. Still this is a good bag but needs to be better designed for air travel which is what I use it for. It does fit under the plane seat.
4.0,"My tot has a wide foot, and this shoe was too narrow for him. Normally with this style shoe we can stretch the rubber, but these don't stretch enough. After wearing the shoes a couple of times, he still hurt ""ow"" when we put them on and they left imprints of the hole, so clearly they were too tight. The quality is great, and the shoe is cute, but if your tot has a wide foot it might be too tight."
4.0,"I love this dress. Super cute, great w leggings."
4.0,Cute but wish they were longer like how they look in the picture to give me a more slimming look...makes me look square lol
4.0,"The fit is OK, it makes you feel hot and you sweat , not sure if it will actually make me slimmer, only have used for 3 1/2 weeks. It does ride up so you have to pull down often."
4.0,This looks great on my arm and goes with many outfits.  It seems to be of decent quality and the picture represents the bracelet well. It's one piece of jewelry I reach for often. I even feel a little younger wearing it! :) I recommend this leather wrap.
4.0,These are great. Sent small instead of large but the product is awesome.
4.0,Beautiful dress though I had to buy a size up. Runs small. The top is too low. Will have to pin it closed. Really love the style and length.
4.0,"Good product for the price. Quality is average as few threads from stitching have started to break and come out, but the straps should last for foreseeable future. Overall it's good buy."
4.0,good price - great gift
4.0,its ok for this days of covid cuz you can spray alcohol and clean it easy but is not that big
4.0,It is cute and soft. My only problem is the shedding. The fur on the inside gets every where and I ended up having to remove the inner layer and just use the outside for a light jacket.
4.0,I like it. It's very comfortable to wear and it's not itchy.
4.0,"This sweater is honestly a great quality made sweater. It is thick but not heavy and uncomfortable. It is really cute. Fits true to size and you could even size down one if want it fitted as these are made to be oversized sweaters. I returned mine only because I didn’t care for one of the threads used in it because it was a glittery type thread, it wasn’t crazy noticable but I noticed and I couldn’t get over that unfortunately because other then that it really is such a well made beautiful sweater, buttons and all!! Also in their photo it looks more white but definitely is a cream beige / off white"
4.0,The dress looks great on my wife she said it's a little to big though.
4.0,"This is a really nice little skirt. The quality is better than I expected. Although it fits, it runs a bit small, so the waistline sits higher than I would like. I would suggest sizing up."
4.0,Very comfy. Wish the visor was a tad smaller.
4.0,Very pretty dress and very flattering
4.0,It sinches you nicely but it does roll down in the back a little.
4.0,"i am usually a womens medium/juniors large.  after reviewing the size chart, i ordered a 2xl.  fits great!  the only thing is that it is super long.  i am 5'6&#34; and have to roll the legs up twice to have them hit my ankles.  other than that, these are great!"
4.0,I bought this leather bracelet for my granddaughter and she loves it when I gave it to her in her birthday she got the biggest smile and I got a big hug. She ware it every single day.
4.0,Its super cute but short. I dont have a large wrist but I am on like the 3rd to last cut out
4.0,"These sunglasses are great! and they fit well. They come with a custom case and cleaning cloth. The only reason they get only four stars is that they scratch very easily. I put them in the sunglasses compartment in the roof of my truck and they came out with small scratches. They are well worth it, just remember not to let the lenses touch anything."
4.0,"Cute little necklace, good for its price. A little bigger than expected but that's fine. Arrived super late (still within its estimated delivery though) but that didn't bother me."
4.0,"Quality of the cap is top notch, however fitting is not quite good. Hence returned it."
4.0,Sits excellent
4.0,I loved these the moment I found them. Unfortunately as you can see one earring was broken so wasn’t able to wear them. The reason for the 4 star review is because the company gave me a refund after explaining what happen and I didn’t have to return it. I don’t plan on throwing them away. I want to try fixing them first.
4.0,I’m 5’6” 146 lbs and a medium fits nice out of the box so it may be just right as it shrinks down after washing. If you’re any larger I would say size up.
4.0,These pins look great. They are highly polished and ready to were clean out of the box.
4.0,"Good shirt. Flowy in front, great for hiding belly."
4.0,"I got these boots at a VERY discounted price, so I'll admit, that was the main appeal.  I don't think I would pay anywhere near full price for them.  That being said, the pros are that they are relatively comfortable, light-weight, and easy to get on and off.  The color is also true to the photo, and you can scrunch them down, or unfold the top to make them longer, so they are versatile.  The main con is that they have NO traction whatsoever, so even walking around the house, I am slipping and sliding."
4.0,Fit perfect to size..
4.0,As the description said “ The most adorable tiny state necklace you will find!“ I was expecting it to be a small pendant. It is not. It is way bigger than expected. Looks to be good quality. I will probably not be wearing it due to the size(too big). But it looks of nice quality.<br /><br />Update:<br />I now use this as a decortion from my rear view window. 5/5 stars
4.0,I am 5'9&#34; and this does not quite fit right. Probably best for somebody around 5'5&#34; ish...very pretty though!
4.0,Like the dress it was somewhat small for me.  Definitely go up a size.  Dress was then as well. I returned due to the size.
4.0,Cool earrings but hinges can be hard to open. Still happy with purchase.
4.0,"Necklaces are super cute and fit my 7 and 10 year old.  One fell apart after one wear, hoping the others hold up, otherwise I will change my rating."
4.0,Good quality but everyone thinks it's a giraffe until we point out what it actually is and they look closely. Keeping it because it's cute either way.  :)
4.0,Love the way the belt looks and how strong it is.
4.0,"I ordered the 3X....should have gone with 4X. The person I bought this for isn’t overweight but definitely tall! I should have ordered one size bigger to accommodate for shirt length & sizing in the waist. Just something to keep in mind if you’re ordering for a taller person! Other than that, it’s exactly as pictured! Loved it."
4.0,"I absolutely love this purse! It's beautiful and goes with everything. The material looks like great quality, and has a soft feel. I would have given this purse 5 stars except for the that the straps seem to be wearing quickly. I've only been wearing the purse for one week, and they're already peeling quite a bit, so I'm not sure how long they'll last."
4.0,I liked the fact that they were very pliable and light. Great for hot days as they feel weightless. Also the indestructible frame makes for easy storage. However the flat color look makes them appear cheap
4.0,"I expected the skirt to be slightly longer as displayed in the picture, but the skirt is still cute on. It fits well and hugs in the right places. I would recommend."
4.0,Cute earrings.  Took forever to arrive!
4.0,"I bought this for my 1 yo, it is too big, but I used the last hole and it fits. I do recommend."
4.0,Nice quality. True to size. Washed several times so far and no issues.<br /><br />These boxers are silky smooth.
4.0,"This is a really pretty dress. I was concerned it would be super tight. I've gained a little weight recently, but the XL did its job. I only wish the inside was black instead of white. The more it stretches, the more you can tell the inside is white. I ordered a different colors as well for when I lose weight."
4.0,The size and fit are exactly as expected. The pants themselves are comfy and neither hot nor cool (if that makes any sense). For working out or going for walks/park/bike these are perfect if you are not the kind of person that loves wearing leggings.
4.0,I like the watch but the light doesn’t work correctly.
4.0,Not as baggy as I expected but cute none the less.
4.0,These are some really great straps. But I was hoping they be a bit wider.<br />I'm guessing companies don't make wide guitar straps any more.<br />But I'm going to keep these for my extra guitars I keep on the wall.<br />Most of all they are strong and look great.<br />Now all I need is my new strap locks.
4.0,"Love the shoes, super sexy but one shoe was missing a stone and the other was missing 3. As I am a crafter I had stones to replace them so no problem.  But they were missing when sent as they were not in the box.  So do check them over carefully before wearing them"
4.0,it runs smaller than expected
4.0,I ordered a medium for my nephew it looked really small. so ordered a large and it didn't look that much bigger I recommend you get a XL
4.0,"Cute and comfy- I wish this were a little higher waisted. Bought an XXL and I have a bit of a belly, and the waist does slip down during rigorous exercise. Also the lining is white, which means that where it is stretched, the black fades to a grey."
4.0,"The barbell is a little long for my liking, it tends to make the gemstone poke out to a noticeable degree, but it can easily be pushed back in. The stones are a bit small, too, when I was hoping for something a little bigger, but that's fine if you want something discreet. Good color variety, arrived as advertised."
4.0,These are really nice socks and they feel good except for how tight they are around my leg. I’ve got thicker legs and these are killing me by mid day. So if you have smaller legs you are good! I’m just going to give them away.
4.0,I as very pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"These sterling silver studs have inset cubic zirconia stones. They are very tiny and minimalist and perfect for people with multiple piercings (or a single piercing). They are lead and nickel free making them hypoallergenic and perfect for sensitive skin. You can easily combine sets of different letters for initials or can use them to spell out words depending on how many piercings<br /> you have. They have a year warranty for a refund or replacement making these an easy choice for purchase. The one downside to these earrings is the size. They are just as beautiful in person as they are in the photos, but are smaller than the photos would lead you to believe, making them, for me, more suited for a second or third piercing  them for a primary piercing."
4.0,"Very nice little bag for the price, my only complaint is the strap isn't conducive to shortening. I like to wear it on my shoulder rather than cross body and I had to cut off part of the strap after I shortened it. Not a big deal though."
4.0,"It runs small but, my daughter who is usually a medium took a size large and this jacket is so adorable.  The only problem we had the first day she wore it was the snap in the middle of the back of the jacket came off.  So, will have to re-sew the snap back on.  But, it is really unique and adorable.."
4.0,I was hoping for a natural fiber combination shirt. I believe that this shirt is primarily rayon. I ordered an extra large but the cap sleeves were tight on my arms. I have the shirt to my daughter who wears size Large In juniors and it fit her well.
4.0,"The dress was beautiful, of you are not well endowed in the breast area go a size down. The stretch is great and hugs curves nicely!"
4.0,Works perfect. Love these to keep my mask handy while at work or when going to a store!
4.0,Nice faux plugs and realistic. Good size gauge. A bit weird to line up front post with back hole. Good buy though.
4.0,"This dress is a dream and I get sooooo many compliments on it! My only hesitation in five stars is that where it stretches, it gets much, much lighter. I would recommend wearing a dark tank top underneath. But I have two of these dresses and would get many more."
4.0,I wear these every time I go out.  They can get a little warm but I think all face mask do.
4.0,"Great universal sun charm. As with all of my other reviews for this type of charm, I wish it was finished on both sides but so few are. This makes a nice pair of earrings and is nice to add to a charm bracelet or charm necklace."
4.0,My daughter wore this to my other daughters wedding...she looked beautiful but only complaint was the material is a little stiff..she loved it other wise....thank you
4.0,Nice 👗 but a little BIG..plz set up an area where can post photos with ease
4.0,The X-large is more like a large.  The pads are a little thick.  Decent Bra.
4.0,"Ordered 3x large, like all my shirts which fit well, but this was too small, gave it away."
4.0,"Sizing is all over the place. 12 is not an XXL in the US, it's maybe a Large. I'd say I'd be a Medium according to the advertising but regardless, this fits too large but it's definitely not an XXL. It would be tight on someone who is expecting to order XXL in the US. 12 is a reasonable size for a tall person, who is athletic. 14, 16, 18 are all larger sizes in swimwear.  I ordered blind, expecting to get something in my size since the size isn't listed. The fabric is good but the cut is not 1st quality. The bum is crooked, one check is more generous than the other. It's a nice idea though, and the fabric and style is pretty, flattering, but it's not 1st quality. It fits as a 12 should, I believe but the tag doesn't say XXL, it does state 12. There is a mesh peek a boo window at the hip, the skirt offers the right amount of modesty and coverage without being too long. The asymmetry is flattering. The top/bra is nice and well formed, offering also the adjustable straps. For me, too loose but I might be able to take it in so as to be able to wear it. For reference to size 12, or XXL...I am 5'8"" 130, 34D cup for bra, 28 jeans, size 2/4 typically. This suit is just a bit loose around the bra band by about an inch or two."
4.0,perfect for a 80s theme party
4.0,Fits much small then list for this design.
4.0,I love the bracelet.  Just wish the ties on the ends were not so long.
4.0,Great gloves but too thick for cold motorcycle rides.
4.0,"So far, so good. I've only worn it twice and it's a bit stiff. But it's attractive and protects my face from the sun, so it gets the job done."
4.0,"I ordered these ones because the description said they were stainless steel, which is not true, they are aluminum. That being said, they seem fairly well made. I would have preferred the hole where the clip is to be a little further back from the outside edge as I plan on using these to display flags on the back of my Jeep and I’m concerned about the drag at speed. I will update my review once I’ve used them."
4.0,Use it every time I go away
4.0,"Replacing one that my husband had wore out, good quality sweat shirt jacket at a great price."
4.0,Nice slim fit for an athletic body. Slim enough to flatter but not skin tight
4.0,Got this as a gift for someone who likes to run a lot and now that it's cold it seemed perfect. It seemed a little thin but it was decent
4.0,"Full disclosure, I received a discount for this item in order to provide an unbiased review.<br /><br />The hat fits snugly, maybe a bit small, especially for people with long/thick hair.<br /><br />It looks pretty, very stylish, especially compared to other sun hats.<br /><br />Not sure how much it'll do to block the sun, but the light material makes it easy to carry around and store."
4.0,"Madeline Kelly panties are my absolute favorite. I've learned from past experience that they run a little large. I would normally go for size large, but medium typically works great for me in this brand. That said, I learned with these that I don't like the wider band as well. I think for that reason a large might have worked better, but I'm not sure. The band is a bit irritating to wear and it rolls when I move around or sit. Even though these particular undies aren't my favorite, I still love the Madeline Kelly brand, just with the thinner band.  Other than that, these are comfortable."
4.0,"I don't normally wear lingerie, but thought this was nice and pretty! I've never liked the way the mesh like material felt. Likewise, I've never felt sexy in it. I couldn't resist trying to spice it up with something else that he's not seen. (Yes, I hid this when it came so I could surprise him.)<br /><br />This is like mesh, but not itchy. Just sheer feeling. Nice silk placed in front. Lace trim on top of bra area and at the bottom. Wire bra. Adjustable straps for shoulders and mid back area. The lace trim at the bottom was tight, on me, but that's my &quot;trouble area&quot;.<br /><br />The g-string was silky like material in the front. Elastic strings on hips and from bottom of material to a loop in the back, around the hip elastic.  It is adjustable and easily moves when washed and dried. I would recommend hanging to air dry.<br /><br />''DISCLAIMER: I received this Ruzishun women's sexy lingerie at a discounted price in exchange for my own 100% honest, unbiased, and own original opinion.  However, reguardless of the price I paid, this is a great piece. I do think it is the right price, but I wish the lace would have been looser and not so tight on the bottom."
4.0,These look great on my 8 month old. Fit perfect with room to grow. Would recommend
4.0,"A little large which is fine, if I gain a few pounds I'll still be able to wear the dress in comfort."
4.0,"Great for the price. can easily get scratched like many other sunglasses, but its super functional to have for water sports and outdoor activities like biking."
4.0,I'm usually a size 8.5 and got a 9 based on other reviews but I should have stuck with my usual size. I either wear two socks each or thick socks with them. They also have a lump at the bottom probably from the way it was made. But the color is a nice white and everything else is fine.
4.0,Looks just like the pic came as a couple days before shipping expected but came from China so took forever!
4.0,Pretty cute the lace isn’t very soft but it’s a great price for this shirt the back is a little low but it’s a cute detail with a bralette it would look super cute.
4.0,Works perfect. Lightweight and stays put. 4 star because the flowers detail fell of with second use.
4.0,"After washing, don't put in dryer at all. Lay it flat to dry as it does shrink in length. The length was the best part of this skirt as my daughter is 5'8"
4.0,Great quality!  Exactly as pictured.  I wished I had gotten my daughter's exact shoe size.  I went a half size larger after reading the reviews.  She will have to grow into them
4.0,Cute for a new mom.
4.0,Love the length and pocket
4.0,"Love the lights! Received 10 cards of four lights each and out of the 20 i've tested so far only one was a dud. The rest all work fine, with just a few lighting up a bit dim at first but this was easily fixed by simply adjusting the batteries. I think the quality of the lights you'll receive depends largely on the seller, for those of you who seem to have received some bad batches. I ordered mine from Globalprice and I'm largely satisfied with them. They came as described and will work perfectly for what I need. I can't give the full five stars because of the one bad light, so not a perfect order, but for the most part I'm pretty happy. :)"
4.0,"Full size, No frills movie prop"
4.0,Can very quickly dress up an outfit.
4.0,Wrinkled will try to steam
4.0,Comfortable and breathable shoes good for the summer coming up.
4.0,"Very pleased with the quality for the price.  Reversible light brown was much lighter than expected. Wanted to order second belt for a darker brown, but am hesitant for getting same light brown."
4.0,"Beautiful, the feathers split a little, but they are super pretty!"
4.0,"The fabric is good, but the size is a little bit big on my face. Unfortunately, the seller doesn't have any smaller sizes."
4.0,"I bought this off shoulder loose casual blouse for my girlfriend who had planned on wearing it on our trip to Arizona this past week.  It did take a while to ship, but I had purchased it far enough in advance to get it in time.  When it arrived I was a bit surprised to see that it was a cream color, not black like in the picture shown on Amazon.  No biggie though, it still looked very nice.  We hit a snag though when we got to Arizona and my gf put it on.  WAY too small.  Now, she does have DD's, and I ordered accordingly, but it was still way too small to fit her.  She's 5'7 and 150 lbs for reference.  Fortunately our 11 year old daughter was there to save the day (her day a least) and took it off of our hands.  She's long and lean for an 11 year old, and it fit her great.  The material is very soft, and it seems to be made well.  I got the shirt at a discount for writing an honest review and because I rely heavily on Amazon reviews when I make purchases I try to give as detailed and honest a review as possible.  Any questions feel free to ask."
4.0,Product helps with postpartum body!
4.0,Big calves may not feel great.
4.0,"I love this shirt and it's very cute, just 2 small things:  1) It runs a bit small 2) The print on the front REALLY smells plasticy at first - need to wash a few times.  Great shirt for summer!"
4.0,"As someone who has suffered from disabilities for almost 10 yrs now, the words on this Inspirational Leather Rope Stainless Steel Bracelet are a gentle reminder to push myself when I am feeling my worst.<br />Wearing this bracelet reinforces the positive thoughts that I really am &quot;Braver Than I Believe, Stronger Than I Seem and Smarter Than I Think&quot;.<br /><br />The 1 3/4&quot; x 1/2&quot; Stainless Steel Plate upon which these words are inscribed is Lightweight and Smoothly Polished.<br />Although the Font is fairly Small in Size, the Deeply Stamped Black Lettering makes it stand out against the stainless steel.<br />The 3/16&quot; wide Leather Strip is looped through an opening on one side of the Plate and attached to the opening on the other side by way of a 1/2&quot; Stainless Steel Lobster Claw Clasp which is tied onto the loose ends of the leather.<br />The doubled leather strip measures 10&quot; in length and sizing can be adjusted by untying the loose ends, re-positioning the clasp and cutting off any excess leather.<br /><br />While I LOVE the Saying, I do wish that Regatta Jewelers would have designed the leather portion so that it looped through Both Sides of the Plate and added a Jump Ring, allowing the Clasp to be fastened to the Jump Ring, rather than to one side of the plate.<br />I find that the design as it is, causes the plate to shift sideways on my wrist, even after shortening the leather.<br />I also find it a bit difficult to maneuver the clasp through the opening on the plate when putting the bracelet on.<br /><br />In spite of the design, the Inspiration I receive when I wear this bracelet keeps me from giving up and going back to bed on those days when I am feeling overwhelmed by my shortcomings. I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to purchase it at a discounted cost in exchange for evaluation and offering my honest, unbiased opinion and I would recommend it."
4.0,Cute sunglasses but the frame is thin. Also is not that flattering on wider faces.
4.0,"This top is very cute and looks exactly like the picture but I think it runs a little small. I followed the size chart and bought a medium but it was tiny and barley covered anything. But since I like it so much an the price is so inexpensive I've decided to buy another one 2 sizes bigger. We will see how my new one fits :) Also, it came in the mail 2 weeks early!"
4.0,I like the  lighted dials
4.0,"It's cute, but small than I expected. Very small diamonds. Cute but not for me 😑"
4.0,Runs a little large and the sleeves were kind of weird but it was alright.
4.0,It’s cute but smaller than I expected
4.0,Cute lightweight earrings to add some flare to an outfit! Exactly like the picture.
4.0,"My son loves this. We use it to help with reminders for taking bathroom breaks. It works so well. It is non disruptive to others in his class as you can just have it vibrate without making sound. Also, it is made well and has lasted a long time and my son isn't always ""careful"" with his things.."
4.0,"I do think this is a good quality hat, but my only issue is the brim. I tried to straighten it out but it doesn't seem like it will ever be fully straight and will have the slight kinks from shipping. That is the only reason I marked it down a star. I just don't like the look of it on my head because it isn't completely straight all the way around.<br />Other than that it is a much better quality hat than some others that I got similar to it. The material on top is well made. Some other ones that I got the top seemed flimsy and is not soft and felt cheap. I used it on the beach last weekend and it worked out when I needed it. It was light weight and I like that it had a string which came in handy when the wind blew to keep it on. The brim is light weight and kept it from not feeling too hot on my head. They have little mesh sides that also help keep you cool."
4.0,"I like this sweater, but my only complaint is you need to lint brush the inside before you wear it. That black fuzz will get EVERYWHERE."
4.0,Perfect size with the adjustable zips. However colour isnt the same as in picture
4.0,Good quality pant but they run about two sizes small.
4.0,A little bigger than I thought. I should have looked more closely at the dimensions. Good overall for quality.
4.0,Gave as a gift but good material and cut
4.0,[[VIDEOID:3eae408894c8b96503e9751c7b317c97]] I make blessing jars and string these charms to them via embroidery thread or hemp string. I love that they are the perfect size for my blessing jars. I Would purchase again for the sale price I paid. Definitely.
4.0,Soewhat large
4.0,Very pretty. Diamonds are small.
4.0,Nicely constructed.  Good value for cost.  Just what I wanted.
4.0,"The order said it was a two pack item and I only received one , other than that . I really like my cap just wish it had two ."
4.0,"Works well, difficult to setup because the double sided, plastic coated instruction sheet is a pictograph.  It isn't very clear and not well suited to describing how to properly set this machine up so that you get good coverage of your pool.<br /><br />  In my opinion the poor documentation is the major downfall of this product.  The manufacture needs to explain that the flow direction of the water in the pool is what guides this product. That it follows the hose.  That the weight on the hose adjusts the angle at which the blue round mat meets the ground and that angle affects how the rotary motion is transferred to forward or backward motion by the other blue round hard plastic wheel.  The source of the power is water hammer induced by the water flowing through a flexible venturi nozzle. None of that was conveyed by the instruction sheet.<br /><br />  If you are not mechanically inclined and not a tinker, you will not like this product.  If you thrive on the challenge of figuring out how things work you will be able to get good results with this product.  It moves at a decent clip when setup correctly.  It will partially climb walls not to the top though. And not all the walls. it depends on the hose length and a lot of other variable.<br /><br /> What I do is vary the hose length to clean different parts of the pool on different days.  I recently just added extra length to the hose way more than is recommended and that seems to make it do the center of the pool as well as the outside edges.  Occasional brushing  in one direction to sweep the dust down to the deep end helps.  This is not a Roomba but it does cut down on the time pool maintenance takes.  I don't vacuum anymore but I do occasionally sweep."
4.0,This dress looks great in the picture as well as the hanger.  Unfortunately it didn't work for me but it worked for my friend.  When found it comfortable and stylish.  I think the color red also helps make this dress stand out
4.0,"Mostly people you need to realize that this item is not made in this country.  It is based on Oriental cultural sizing.  So order accordingly-- which is to say 2 sizes bigger than usual.  And some people complained that it sheds.  OK It does.  I took it out of the package and put it into the dryer for an hour with NO heat and tumbled it to remove the loose shedding.  It has been fine ever since...Mine is Black, I wore it today with white.  I wish the arm holes were bigger.  More of a raglan cut and lined like the body.  But aside from that, for less than $40 I think it is a bargain.  If you need a closure wear a belt or put a loop and button on it.  That is what I did.  This item is advertised appropriately.  And I think it is work the money."
4.0,I really like the large size of these glasses.
4.0,It's a very beautiful dress. A must buy. Now let's see what happens after washing it.
4.0,"I'd have given it 5 stars but the clasp broke on me the second time I wore it. I found a great work-around with a small s hook, so no worries. I will probably buy again."
4.0,The material is a little thin. It's not so thin that it's sheer but you will definitely need to wear a slip or body shaper underneath. I'm 5'4 and it falls right at my knees. I wear size 18 misses so I ordered the 2Xl. It fits perfectly.
4.0,"Great comfortable socks. I just wish it had more cotton, but wears better than I expected."
4.0,I little bigger in back than I thought but appears to be good quality for the price.
4.0,"I love this dress. It fits very well. I did choose to go for a large where I thought a medium would have but the large is better, so size up. I love the light weight of the material.<br />The only thing wrong with it is it says it’s balck and white but the black is really navy blue."
4.0,There's almost no money in it.
4.0,"This Swan Sterling sliver necklace it was so cute and Shining,the chains it was perfect lengths for me ,it’s my first time buy the jewelry on Amazon, I am so surprises ."
4.0,"I really like these workout tanks and they fit pretty well.  Be warned that they will begin to droop and sag throughout your workout, though, especially in the armpit/neck area.  It's not a problem for me since my sports bras provide plenty of coverage anyways, but it is worth noting.  They return to their original shape when washed/dried.  They are very light and airy; I wear them for everything from running to dancing."
4.0,"I wanted the new Victoria Secret bathing suit look but didn't want to pay the price.  This suit did the trick.  It is a little confusing to put on but once you figure it out, its easy.  The bottoms are a bit skimpy but I really wanted it for the top.  I love the way it looks and am excited to wear it."
4.0,Beautiful color and love the strap
4.0,"while I would not wear these slippers outside of the house, they are the prefect house slipper.  While I have seen better made slippers, they are indeed very comfortable.......especially when wearing them bare footed to feel the softness of the material inside the slipper"
4.0,I love the silk robe. it doesn't stay closed that well but the silk is really soft
4.0,"Great umbrella, but too short of a handle and too small of a diameter.  When I wear it, the hands are covered by the sun"
4.0,"Fits very large. I am 5'10, 140lbs and this dress drags on the ground. Its very bright pink as well"
4.0,these seem to be great quality but a bit small and tight around the ears for me.  I like the 6 layers of protection but do not like the brand name on the outside of the mask.
4.0,"Love this piece! Bought for a trip to Jamaica and it was perfect for the weather there. I always appreciate lightweight fabrics in tropical climates! Be aware that you will want very light or nude color undergarments with this, as it is easy to see color through the fabric."
4.0,"This belt is a quality leather item and fit according to size. I traditionally wear size 38 pants and bought the corresponding belt and it fits two notches in according to size, so I am not sure what all the others are talking about when they say it runs small. It came in a nice tin with tissue paper as pictured and is genuine leather. It has a very stylish looking buckle and the stitching is nice and neat. I have not worn this belt for an extensive period of time, but when I tried it on it was comfortable and stylish and should fit in well with my current attire. I bought this belt because I go through belts pretty quickly. I wear a fashionable belt for work everyday because my work requires business casual attire or slacks and a long sleeve collared shirt with a belt daily. Even when wearing jeans I like to have a nice looking belt that looks classy but stylish and this belt fits that bill. Overall I was very satisfied with my purchase, and like others have said I might go and get the brown belt in the future. The only downfall and thus the reason why it was four stars instead of five is because it is very easy and accommodating nowadays to have a reversible belt with black on one side and brown on the other, and this belt obviously is a single color. With that being said though, all around a great product and a great buy. I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"They fit well if you go up a half size. Not the best shoe for kids, my son did tear them up a bit."
4.0,"I got the silver pair, the frame is matte black.  These are decently wide, I have a fairly big head (7 5/8"") and they are just right.  Very flat across the top and look good with 59fifty hat."
4.0,"I wish they made these tank tops non see through. But these are honestly one of the better brands of tank tops that I've purchased, and believe me I have purchased a lot. They last long, hold their form after washing and are very comfortable. Worth the investment."
4.0,"I like mine. It spreads out my muffin top that would normally hang around the top of my pants.  Pretty comfortable too. The only bummer part is that once they're on, the top edge does some weird shifting, it doesn't roll,  but some weird fold with the top 1/2&#34;. I also wonder if I maybe should have ordered larges.  I wear a 3-5 in jeans, and I ordered a medium. I feel like the crotch area was maybe a bit short, but then again, I'm long waisted.  I'm not sure. But they absolutely serve their purpose."
4.0,it's cute. I like it. But it's still not the bag I was hoping for. I'm looking for a bag to take to Disney World. The little side pockets are to small to hold anything. I was hoping it would hold a bottle of water.  I'm still looking for the perfect bag.
4.0,bought for someone else
4.0,"Nice, comfy just too friggin small"
4.0,"The case fit perfectly. But since I am clumsy, I think I need something more sturdy for my phone. Still a keeper though."
4.0,Cute little lounge piece for the price.
4.0,"Carry bag ripped fast , shoes are great son loves them"
4.0,When you wash them they shrink a bit.
4.0,I liked the weight and the fit
4.0,This dress is beautiful and the material is great. I read reviews that it ran big so I got a large and it was a little too big so I returned it. If I would've ordered a medium it would have been perfect!
4.0,You can not see the letter
4.0,I love the silver studs more than anything. The jewls were okay but the ball ones were my favorite.
4.0,"Giving it a 4 because its a little bit tight, the design at the front kinda hides my big tummy (just had a baby )nothing a blazer won't fix."
4.0,Just opened the box and am pleased with the appearance of the watch.  If it runs as good as it looks this will be a fabulous buy.
4.0,Easy one-piece hat/scarf
4.0,"Comfortable, decent quality"
4.0,"Bought this for a bridal shower, it was cute and comfy and now I am able to wear it as a work dress as well. Ill probably buy in a few colors!"
4.0,A friend of mine loved it his sexy wife can't stop touching it he says lol
4.0,"Does not stay on my ears, however they are lightweight and look like real silver"
4.0,"Silver = Gray. So I'm exchanging for another color.  For was fine, ordered up a size."
4.0,"Our daughter asked for a digital watch for Christmas that resembled a smart watch but wasn’t one (we aren’t ready to spring for that yet). She chose this one and is very happy with it. It has a nice bright display. I’m a little concerned because her previous watch was water resistant and more sturdy, so we will see how well this one withstands the wear and tear of an active preteen."
4.0,"While the inside material is not quite what I expected, I do love the size and handle choices."
4.0,I converted the vertical blinds to curtain. These clips got the job done.
4.0,Very nice for the price. Not as long As they look in the picture.Colors are very pretty
4.0,"It's great, just took a long time to arrive."
4.0,"The material is a bit thin and questionable but the dress is pretty. Fits snug to the body like a body on dress, so if you have a bit of a belly like i have, you might want to go up a size."
4.0,Love the sunglasses but prefer the amber lens for bright sunshine.
4.0,Its basically the comfortable hoodie you want to wear all the time but nice enough to wear out. It's so light and its long and the only thing I would change is making the hood removable and the draw.string is not as attractive as I like . It's really an awesome jacket and I'd purchase it again..I actually will prob get my daughter one too.
4.0,Fast ship item as described
4.0,"Wow. Great look, great feel. What a great deal. Well worth the price. Even comes with a carry bag & micofiber cleaning cloth.<br />My only complaint: more of an observation, as it does not affect the usability of the glasses. The SojoS logo is &#34;etched &#34; into the top left corner of one lens. But it is located on the inside of the lens, not the outside. Might be a production error since this isn't a logical location?? Like I said, it doesn't matter to me, just kinda weird. Still love them."
4.0,"These slippers are very durable.  With daily wear and tear, they seem like they'll last a while."
4.0,Hard to find these anymore. They were a gift for my boyfriend. The only downside is you have to buy the pair.
4.0,"A bit in the snug side, but beautifully made. I usually wear a size Small, but I'm glad I ordered a Medium! The material is comfy and the lace arm pieces are lovely. Very nice blouse!"
4.0,My feet are always cold and the first time I wore them I was impressed. My feet stayed warm with temperatures around zero degrees.
4.0,great dress .. fits perfect
4.0,"Seems to be nice quality. Lined and can be used as windbreaker and raincoat. But be warned, these run small. I wear a US XL and ordered a US XXL and its a just fit. The wife said it gives me a reason to lose a couple of #'s, but a US XXXL would have been better (I'm not fat, just American :-)"
4.0,"Like the style, but not for me."
4.0,The corset is absolutely beautiful! The fabric is soft and silky. The embroidery is very detailed. Overall I would recommend this to anyone! The only issue is that the shoulders are really broad. I will have to add a hook and eye clasp to pull them up otherwise they hang and pull down on the corset.
4.0,Not perfect over the eyeglass
4.0,It looked good on my daughter. Thanks
4.0,swag but not actually adjustable😩
4.0,delightful ring
4.0,"Taking this out of the package, the medium is humongous. Very loose and flowy and on me, and I wish I went for a small. The material is very sheer, so I wouldn't recommend wearing this on its own, but on the plus it looks super cute with leggings or jeans. Feels just a little scratchy.<br />The style is kinda flower-power meets gothic romance. There is a a little snap button halfway up the collar which I thought was cool because you can control how open you want it to be, but it unsnaps easily."
4.0,"Pretty, just not for me, exposed too much on me, nice, but returned"
4.0,"I like it, wanted to love it, but the size L/XL (14-20) is definitely not up to sz 20."
4.0,Good fit. Nice and lightweight.
4.0,"This was a beautiful necklace, but it was missing some of the rhinestones."
4.0,"Ok Robe, nothing great"
4.0,Beautiful dress! My only issue is the chest area is not as expected but I'm top heavy so I wore a tank top underneath it. I'm a US size 16 and 5'7 and I ordered the 2x. I wore it with wedges and the length was great.
4.0,"Fits well overall, but the sleeves are way too long."
4.0,"The material of the skirt is thicker than expected. But, overall, it’s a nice dress"
4.0,Nice quality little small
4.0,"Nice hat, just a little tight over my ear because I wear a hearing aide."
4.0,"Definitely use the sellers size chart. I'm 5'11, size 12, and have a larger chest. Ordered an XL and it fit like a dream. Was the perfect length for me so if you are on the shorter height scale, you may need to hem. Ordered this for a rehearsal dinner outfit, and can't wait to wear it!"
4.0,"I love this dress!!  Reference I am 5'3, 208lbs I ordered a Medium. it fit snug enough to show the curves and the top is long enough to cover the tummy. BEWARE it will rise up on those thighs when you walk/sit."
4.0,"Great look!! But they will not fit all glasses,seems to be made of good quality!!"
4.0,These are very good quality. I would recommend for any little boy who loves dinosaurs like my son does.
4.0,It's very pretty but smaller than I expected
4.0,"These were too small and they do not come in half sizes.  I returned them and got a full size bigger.  The outside of boots are like a black sweater and they are lined with fake fur. They would not be good to wear in the rain or snow.  The insole is most like Vionic flip flops, so if you like those, you will like these."
4.0,"I'll give it 4 stars because it's a perfectly good skirt, nice pattern, nice material, nice price - a great skirt, if you're TALL.  I am not tall, 5'3&#34;, and I needed to bring it up beneath my breasts just to get it to be an ankle-length skirt - but since it won't STAY under my breasts, I won't be able to wear this skirt.  I have a 6' friend who might like the skirt, otherwise somebody at Goodwill can enjoy it."
4.0,"Washed nice , runs big."
4.0,"Love the colors and size, also the pocket is large enough to place items such as money, passport, etc."
4.0,Little longer than anticipated. But still a good buy
4.0,"While I love the feel and look of the sweatshirt, I usually wear a medium or large in sweatshirts. I bought an XL. The sleeves are exceedingly long (that's ok) but the hipline is VERY tight (size 8/9 jeans) while the top could fit a small family of cats. Still worth the inexpensive price for a Halloween season."
4.0,"My wife loves it! It's simple, delicate and the gems shine. The only drawback is the clasp is a little funky but we figured it out. I got this for our 13th wedding anniversary since Citrine is the traditional stone for 13th. I also got her the &#34;Sterling Silver Citrine and White Topaz&#34; necklace which she also loved."
4.0,"Overall, for the price, what I expected. The detail isn't that polished on the dice, but again for the price it is a fun item to have."
4.0,"The pink case was perfect. It fit on my MacBook Air wonderfully. The keyboard cover didn't though. I tried all 3 and I felt like the keys would get stuck underneath. I couldn't type as well, which is disappointing because I really loved the color of the pink one when it was on. A couple of the slot covers were either too big or too small so I have lost a some because they won't stay in. All I really was concerned about though was the case and I am very happy that fit correctly."
4.0,"This top is very cute, speaks summer time for sure! The quality of it is ok, nothing special about it. Fits little snugged over the chest area and hits right by your hips so is not actually long or flowing like it looks on the pictures. The straps could go a little more longer to have a more loosen top, but just with what it provides is not very comfortable. I would recommend this blouse for someone medium average body type with not much chest as with the bra it feels snugged."
4.0,Perfect as a dance party give away.
4.0,"This Jeff & Aimy Western Outback Cowboy Straw Hat with a Shapeable Brim is actually a pretty nice product. The color is a little off-putting, but everything else is really nice. It holds its shape pretty easily and is comfortable to wear. It looks good too."
4.0,This is a cute earring. It took me a while to figure out how the heck to put it on your ear but you have to slide it on and make sure the bar goes directly to the back of your ear.  I like it a lot.  And 2 came for me.  Speedy delivery.
4.0,It fits a tad bit loose but my kid will grow into it. The only issue I have with this dress the tag is sown onto the outside of the dress right on the side. Felt it was weird/inconvenient spot to put a tag. But cute toddler dress.
4.0,Nice shoelaces.  The have a sort of oval profile.
4.0,"I ordered this suit because I just didn't want to wear a bikini, but also still wanted to look cute at the beach. This is a very feminine suit that I can wear with confidence and not worry about any wardrobe malfunctions while playing with my kids in the water. As other reviewers have said, the rear part is small and does not provide &#34;full&#34; coverage. I wouldn't mind that so much except that it's a little tight, and smooshes my cheeks somewhat unattractively. That's the reason I give this four stars instead of five--it would be more comfortable if it were cut a little roomier in the backside. But overall, I'm very happy with this suit and am glad all the other good reviews convinced me to buy it.<br /><br />I'm 5'6&#34;, usually wear a size 4 or 6, and I ordered a size 42."
4.0,A really nice watch for the money!
4.0,Bought these Capri's for my daughter and she really likes them.  They came recommended by a friend.
4.0,"Not the item as the image provided, need to order a couple sizes up, color is off"
4.0,"Bout these for my grandson who is 3yrs old and wearing 2Ts in most things. These were super cute but a bit small. They won't last very long before he is out of them. Wish there were bigger sizes for him, and for his 6yr old sister who was very upset there were no pj mask items in her size."
4.0,they are little bit small but fit tight on my face but they look very old school. i like it
4.0,Beautiful ring and very comfortable.
4.0,"Boots were well made, but I couldn't get my foot in.  The strap across the instep was too tight."
4.0,"Let me start by saying these lenses are AMAZING. I take my eyewear very serious and always opt for the most protection. These lens are almost as good as my $200 lens I use for driving. While wearing the glasses I can see part of the bridge of nose piece. I have had friends try them on and they say the same. Its not enough for them to be totally disregarded. I have used the glasses for golf, baseball, and hiking. Seeing the bridge really affected my golf game so I stopped wearing them for golf. They held up really well in baseball as long as they were on my face. They have a tendency to fall apart while on my hat at full sprint. For hiking they were perfect. Super light weight, pieces snap together so not worried about it getting bent, and lenses protected my eyes while still giveing me crisp color.<br /><br />If you can catch these on sale for sure buy, would have returned if paid full price."
4.0,There great jeans just must run small I fit into 32w no problem and these where tight
4.0,"The pants are high quality, comfortable and fit true to size. The only downsize is that the belt is not very good and it is stitched into the pants to it’s not removable. Over all I like the pants."
4.0,"I purchased these pants because I wanted skinny jeans with secure cargo pockets. I went to Cedar Point and didn't want anything falling out of my pockets while on a roller coaster. Having buttons to hold the pockets shut was my number one concern. I tried these pants on for a couple hours before having one of the buttons on the cargo pockets pop right off. I ended up having new buttons sewn on to ensure that the pockets would be secure. Other than that the pants fit fine, and were as expected. I can't imagine they'll last very long as it's clear that they are made with very low quality. These pants are not worth more than $20.<br /><br />EDIT: Seller reached out to me after reading my initial review. I was offered a partial refund for the item. Great customer service. Changed my rating from 2/5 to 4/5 just for the great customer service."
4.0,"I bought these for the jackets. They are great to add to all sorts of studs. The stones are big, so it's better for more formal wear. I would not wear these to work."
4.0,"This shop apron is a workers helper.  It is heavy duty denim and will last forever with proper care.  Just throw it in with a load of jeans and keep it clean.  The only problem is the straps to hang around one's neck are difficult to adjust and  have to be adjusted every time you put the apron on.  I am going to remove the straps and make a stationary strap to go around my neck and have a simple tie in the back  I don't know why they couldn't make a simple adjustable neck strap and a tie in the back like other aprons to alleviate the problem.  As is sometimes said, keep it simple, stupid.  That might work for this occasion."
4.0,"For the most part, I like this dress. It's just a little weird fitting like around the beck and arms and the material is kinda stiff."
4.0,"I like these pajamas. The material is not heavy, but for sleeping in it's great. I am 5'7&#34; and 128 lbs and ordered large. They looked big but shrunk so that they fit perfectly. At first I thought they were too small, but when I put them on they loosened up and are very comfortable. I'm getting another set."
4.0,"I ordered 2 different types of this type of reusable shopping bag. I was looking for a good sturdy bag that will hold up over time that was inexpensive to start out. This is a 5 pack at the listed price, I was initially a little leery because there is only 5 in the pack.  They arrived and upon inspection, I am very pleased these were packaged well seem well manufactured, sturdy, stitching looks good. I still think they are a little pricey but, I feel better about paying that price for this well-made product. I would purchase more of these for myself or even purchase them as a gift for someone else. I do recommend these reusable bags to Family, Friends, and to YOU!"
4.0,"The good - very comfortable, very stretchy, I love wearing these skirts<br /><br />The bad - maybe a little too loose in the waist - I felt the need to check that the skirt wasn't sliding. Also, when getting in and out of the car, mine twisted around a lot so the seems migrated to the front.<br /><br />The caution - slightly thin material, but great with the right underwear. My blue underwear under the pink skirt were visible but that's easy to prevent. Otherwise, not too thin"
4.0,del early  coo; looking  one size all lil bit big
4.0,"Pretty, simple, skinny belts. I was hoping they'd fit me with a 36&#34; waist, but no luck, I punched another hole in them, but it's still a bit too snug."
4.0,Great buy my son loves them!!!!!
4.0,"I bit confusing to put together, especially if you haven't this type of sweeper before.  After some time, I got it together and it works great.  Very please with the product."
4.0,"Pros:<br />- Comfortable<br />- Sturdy<br />- Affordable<br />- Functional<br />- Stylish<br />- Waterproof<br />- Good quality<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Stains easy<br />-Fits but only if you tie well<br /><br />Overall, I love these boots! I've been looking for good affordable vegan waterproof boots and these have been holding out well. I've been going to the gym a lot more to where I have squat shoes to help with stability. Surprisingly, these boots have the exact same stability so it's like they're the shoe version of an AWD vehicle where you can walk anywhere with no worry lol. Now I originally bought these for the waterproof aspect because puddling water happens a lot where I live. How did they hold up? Well, I stood in a puddle that was about 4 inches and didn't feel my feet get wet at all! My only complaints are that they stain easily (guessing it's the material) and they're loose if you don't tie them properly. I know the latter goes without saying like with shoes in general but these require you to put some ummph into it when tying. Other than that I love these and I'm waiting to see how they hold up."
4.0,True to size and but material slightly uncomfortable
4.0,"I got this package fairly quickly. I ordered the Ivory color and it was more white than an off white color. Also, the loop seems too long for me and hangs a little awkwardly around my neck. It would have been better if it was shorter."
4.0,"Very nice dress, however it is a little shiny."
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for my sister.  Because she didn't rave about them, I gave them a 4, but she did seem to like them.  The were soft and cuddly without making her feet too hot, which is why I got them.  I would recommend them because they looked great to me and she just doesn't rave about most things."
4.0,Bought these for my husband. He loves them. Says the compression shorts are great.
4.0,"I like the hat quality! Nothing outstanding about it, but it won't fall apart, and it has held up to me wearing it in the gym for a few weeks. Embroidery looks fine, no frays as of yet. The one complaint I have is that my big head has it down to the two buttons on the strap. Haha."
4.0,Nice very nice. Larger than anticipated. Good looking and confy. Can't beat the price.  Didn't love the bubble glass I expected it to be flat. The finish lends me to believe that it will flake off eventually. Accurate and light for its size
4.0,They were thick and not as long as he would have liked them.
4.0,It pretty good the only problem I had was it looked a little baggy
4.0,Nice shirt but blue area is faded.
4.0,I like tassel earrings but there were a bit too wide for my liking.  They're attractive but was a bit overpowering on mye.
4.0,This chain is nicely made and matches the woman’s choker necklace and has a little weight to it but not to much the color stays ain’t trashing or changed in anyway he has worn it since getting it to dr working in cutting word to work and everything and it ain’t bothered it one bit so great chains for budgets to show that special someone you care
4.0,Feels like it could break if I strength it but it’s looks cute. I didn’t expect it to bc good quilts tho lmao
4.0,"You have to be careful with these type of ties. Be sure to like it before buying one. It's a little bit hard to make a knot. I suggest you to begin with a simple knot. Having said that, I really think it's a wonderful and cheap choice. If you don't like it, you won't feel so bad about it. I give a 7.5/10 to this tie."
4.0,"The earrings are actually even nicer looking than I expected! They seem pretty high quality (a little malleable, but that's to be expected!) They arrived promptly and even came with a little bonus gift (small sterling silver pink star studs) and they look very nice on the ear. I use them as both lobe earrings and as inserts for my cartilage piercing. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,This dress is very cute. I do find that it’s cut a bit lower in front then expected but I use fashion tape to keep it a bit more modest. Overall the style is adorable and made of good quality. I did buy 2 other colors as well for the cruise I went on.<br />I am 5’7 and weigh 138 and purchased a small I think I could have gone up a size but overall pleased with the small.
4.0,"The shirt is cute, but made small. Other than that,  the product came in very quickly."
4.0,Looks the same in person
4.0,"I'm writing because I like these overall and recommend them and wish I could get prescription glasses that were this comfy. I have had these for two years (bought at a store). I normally wouldn't pay this much for a non-prescription pair, but I needed them for a standardized test that required reading a lot of small print at different distances. They were helpful. I love how lightweight they are and that the material is kind of velvety soft, rubbery, and flexible against the head, but not loose. I removed one star because the silver accent on one side fell off (you could take both accent bars off and it would look okay). I didn't buy them for their looks, but it's funny how many compliments I get about them. I leave them sitting around without their case a lot, so I've accumulated quite a few little scratches on the lenses at this point that don't really bother me. I highly advise using a case."
4.0,"Mom looks querky with them on, but block the sun shine nicely."
4.0,Great buy. Runs big. Shouldn’t have sized up like other reviews said.
4.0,"Exactly what I expected, a bit snug but I should’ve ordered an XL anyway"
4.0,Nice fit. Wore to an afternoon garden wedding.
4.0,Glasses are too heavy on the nose.  Use most times to block sun.
4.0,"Thinner than most similar watches; easy to set.  Timer's irrelevant to me - all I want is time & date, plus ability to show time in 24H format, all of which this watch fulfills.  If I get 5+ yrs out of it, I'll be happy.  Have had good luck in the past w/Casio."
4.0,I loved it ! Toddler shirt a little fitting but it’s a great look ! Thank you !
4.0,Took to Hawaii and I did great in the ocean. Took to pool didn’t fade
4.0,So I’m not a stick thin model sodoesn’t drape as perfectly. Also it’s cute but not the finest of material
4.0,"It's adorable, received quickly and I love it!"
4.0,"Very comfortable.  Much thinner than most corduroys, but it's been a warm fall so that hasn't bothered me too much.  I've worn them almost every weekend for about a month and haven't seen any wear yet, but I tend to soak my pants rather than wash them."
4.0,"This is a nice hoodie but I thought the material would be thicker and warmer, it wasn't. However my granddaughter loves the teal color and begged to keep it. I was persuaded!"
4.0,arrived on time I used these pendants for my Pearl Party & every one loved them .
4.0,For the price this is a cute set.
4.0,I ordered 4t. fits well.
4.0,"Great, came on schedule and lays beautifully the way I was expecting it to be . Thank you!"
4.0,"I bought these compression sleeves for my paralyzed husband hoping they would help with the circulation in his paralyzed leg, however he hasn't actually been able to try them yet because he has developed an injury to his leg, which is being treated by nurses with compression zinc wraps but once it heals and we are able to let him try them I will then leave another review of this product, but what I can say is they seem to be good quality shipping was fast and I was very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Soft, cute, fits as expected, and well-appliqued. Only beef - a bit expensive for a T."
4.0,"Great savings, great compartmentalization!"
4.0,It first me well and it came weeks earlier than what it said. I love it. I just wasn't expecting the faded style of the grey so it threw me off. I would prefer a solid color but overall I love it. I have a 1990 isuzu pickup.
4.0,"Seems flimsily at first however, I found that it is efficient and does the job with minimal exterior modifications.  Delivered on time and not as expensive as other vent outlets."
4.0,She liked it ....
4.0,Very pretty. Lots of compliments
4.0,"This bathing suit impressed me a lot. It’s unique and adorable on. However, the material is very thin in the crotch and shows the lining of my lady parts. For the little price I paid I am willing to deal with the cheap material."
4.0,"I purchased in size Medium. Approximate measurements: chest underarm to underarm 18.5"", length shoulder to hem 26"", across hem 20.5"", across mid body 17"". I typically wear a women's size medium in basic t-shirts, 36C bra, size 8 jeans. On me this top was slightly fitted through the chest, relaxed below the bust, loose at the hips. The fabric was soft, thin and stretchy but not at all sheer/semi-sheer. With the faded logo and after a few washes I expect it will have the genuine vintage look and feel. Overall it appears to be well made and fairly good quality."
4.0,"These black face masks are comfortable, easy to adjust the ear straps, and all around fit fairly well. We tried these masks on two different adult faces, and they worked well on both. Our biggest and only complaint is that the design of the mask makes it easy to mistake the top for the bottom. I've often quickly put on my mask only to realize afterwards that I had it on upside down. Other than simple user error of flipping my mask top to bottom, I really enjoy these masks."
4.0,"Good quality, but I don't like pajama stitching"
4.0,I really love this bathing suit unfortunately it's a tad small in the breast area. I am 5'9&#34; about 175 lbs and have size DDs. It doesn't have the best support for my top but the rest fits good and I believe if I get some double-sided tape that it would fit perfect
4.0,"Fit was comfy, dress is cute but the blue floral pattern wasn't the most flattering or what I expected so it's going back."
4.0,"Extra large was still snug (ordered up size since it was juniors) but in a good way.  This shirt is also long enough to not ride up while exercising, which of course you would be doing in this shirt ;-)"
4.0,Nice quick delivery.  I could have gone up in size. Nice bright color and suits the purpose.
4.0,This is a pull slide style bracelet.  Where you can expand and then close to fit your wrist.  The materials are all pretty decent.  Gems in the skull seem to be secured nicely.  The skull isn’t flat so this is a round pebble sitting against your wrist though out the day.  I found that waring this as a very loose bracelet is more comfortable then against my skin.  Overall pretty subtle jewelry that is well made.
4.0,I love this watch! It runs well and looks lovely. The only reason for 4 stars is because the clip that holds the extra band slides off. I have small wrists so there’s quite a tail and it can be irritating. But it wouldn’t stop me from buying it.
4.0,Like color and design but it’s little bigger than I thought for my front pocket
4.0,It's a little flimsy and I have very small wrists so it doesn't fit on my hand well. But it's a great price!
4.0,"I love this dress. I looked at it and thought no way it'll fit. Not only did it fit but I look hot. Big girls, get this masterpiece. Only complaint is you need a slip because it's see through in the back!"
4.0,"Great looking shirt, not as big ad I hoped. Fit was not as relaxed, but it should fit fine after the baby (13 weeks along, thought I ordered up enough)"
4.0,Love the material! And the cut is really nice. Long but not too long.
4.0,I really enjoy traveling with Lipault luggag!  Very packable that in large size you need to watch the weight!  We have never traveled in heavy snow so I do not know it it would soak through.  We have traveled over 10 flights and no damage to luggage so far.  The last piece I purchased did not match the original plum so I ordered this color.
4.0,"As per the other reviews I sized up (5’5 and 145 lbs) to a large. The dress fit great everywhere besides the chest, it was far too baggy so I had my grandma take it in. Over all this was a beautiful dress and worth the money! I did not expect the feel of the fabric and didn’t LOVE it but it’s still worth it!"
4.0,"Pretty good material, i would say a good quality shirt. Only downside is that you definately need to size up. I got an XL for a friend and it kinda looks like a medium compared to me and I usually get smalls."
4.0,these laces were great and as described but would have been better suited to boots than shoes. just note how long they are before purchasing - otherwise they're great quality.
4.0,Daughter loved the dress but the bag ended up splitting after a few weeks
4.0,Bought as a replacement for my father in law. He loves it.
4.0,"I love how this suit looks! It's well lined (so not see-through when wet) and fits comfortably. the straps are adjustable and the wrap-around tie doesn't loosen as you wear it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the stitching is a tiny bit uneven on the top, but it's not noticeable when wearing it. Overall, a really great suit for the price!"
4.0,All the bands except for the gray on are great.  The gray one can not be read with ease.  I wear mine 7/24.
4.0,"Haven't worn it yet, but bought for a beginning yoga class. I tried it on, love the feel, and believe it will be perfect for yoga or tai chi."
4.0,These were sent to me at no charge in exchange for a review. I found them to be very comfy but a little too large so I wouldn't wear them in public. They are perfect however for lounging around the house or running small errands. They did not shrink when I washed them the first time but I do think over time and with the use of hot water they would. I do like them though for wearing around and just being comfortable.
4.0,"I normally wear small but after reading the reviews I ordered a medium to be safe, well the top fit great but the bottoms are too snug!! The suit is very pretty and the quality is great! I'm considering exchanging for a large! I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh between 123 and 125."
4.0,It's great for the price.
4.0,"Good quality- especially for  it being twenty something bucks! After looking at their sizing chart and reading reviews I got the 3XL. Usually I am a Large/extra large depending on the item so it was definitely sizing up a lot. I'm 5'4 and curvy, bra size 36 DD. The bottom fit perfect. I could've probably fit in the size smaller but with this size their was no pinching on my legs or tummy and it didn't leave a muffin top. I didn't feel like I was being compressed in or squeezed so I loved this fit for the bottoms. I loved how high it went up and it was really flattering. I would wear these bottoms with other tops as well. The top didn't fit as well. It's definitively a booby cleavage suit. Cups should be bigger with the wire but tighter on the top. The lip is a little open and doesn't stay up as well as I'd like. Being busty, my boobs didn't fit all in the cup, it wanted to seep under the underwire a little. and if I pushed it all above the underwire there was some definite spillage over. The ties were a little loose  so I'm a little nervous how water weight will pull it down. Overall I'm happy with the purchase with the price. The bottoms are a total win and I think with careful precautions I'll be happy with the top. More or a relaxing swim around the pool suit versus a boating suit.  Super cute and decent quality."
4.0,Fun assortment of bracelets to wear together or individually.
4.0,It's comfy to wear and comes in multiples. The only thing is that it rolls down when wearing it for long periods of time.
4.0,I like the cut and style of the dress. The material is soft and smooth too.
4.0,But work what I paid
4.0,Super cute on and my 6 yo loved it! There were def some loose threads I had to cut and I don’t think it’ll hold up after a few washes but for the cost it was def worth my daughter being excited to wear it to her Christmas program!
4.0,Loved it but snap on plastic back came off and broke but they were so cute
4.0,"The two zippers on the front side constantly fall down. I use to keep things in there, but would lose the items. Those two pockets are useless, and it is pretty annoying; however, it's a beautiful red bag. I love how big it is, and all of the pockets are great."
4.0,But they don't hold her glasses to well. Which was what I was trying to do. I noticed her glassed kept falling when she was playing on her tablet so bought these for her. But they help a little when there not falling out of place.
4.0,Cute . love this top I'm 5'3&#34; 110 lbs bought a small fits a little big in shoulders.
4.0,I just wanted to give it star ratings so I didn't need to see this anymore. Typing headlines and reviews is annoying.
4.0,"It's about what I expected for the price, but I was surprised by how very small the watch band is. The first hole makes the band small enough that it could fit on a toddler's wrist without falling off. I am not exaggerating. It does fit on my wrist if I use one of the last two holes.<br />The other issue I have is minor. The rotating bezel only turns counter-clockwise. It's ratcheted. You cannot turn it the other direction. Considering I bought this watch specifically because it has a rotating bezel, I am slightly disappointed by this, but I also don't know if that's a standard aspect of this feature, having never bought a watch with a rotating bezel before.<br />The packaging it comes in is not what I was expecting, but is a non-issue for me. I mention it only because I was surprised and others might not want this. It does not come in a box. It comes in a cheap ""velvet"" drawstring bag that feels terrible. Was shipped in a padded envelope, so it basically had very little protection while being shipped. This might be different with different sellers, though."
4.0,I do however wish they were a little longer on me. They are not super short I am just one of the ladies who doesn't like her legs .
4.0,"Nice, just wish they stayed closer together when doubled on my arm."
4.0,"Fun socks that bring back the golden age of gaming on an Atari 2600 system.<br />The freeway socks are quite a bit of a mess inside, the way they are sewn.. the fabric will get stuck on your fingers.. other patterns do not seen to be that bad."
4.0,"Although it was a few weeks late due to the first shipment containing the wrong shirt, my boyfriend loved his shirt. He's a big Star Wars fan, so it was nice to see it met his standards."
4.0,Love the value of this jacket. Bought them for our Scout Troop. Only imperfection was that the sleeves were too long on most.
4.0,Delivered faster than I thought it would be. Fits Perfectly. I thought there were two and only got one. Over all very excited and pleased with this item
4.0,"nice cross the shoulder bag for phone.  and has room for money, credit card, but not bunch of keys.  it serves my purpose well."
4.0,"The product is very easy to put on. It has decent coverage and does not roll up. I can't say that it alone has made me lose weight in the belly, but it holds everything in so I can jog without annoying jiggle."
4.0,Very cute but some sequences fell off
4.0,"I received this item at no cost as part of the Amazon Vine program. This program encourages honest reviews with no incentives for positive reviews or penalties for negative ones, my reviews reflect my own impressions. If my review helps you, please click the ""Helpful"" button!<br /><br />My head size is ~23&3/4"" (~60 cm) around, measured just above the ears & eyebrows. I wear a size extra-large hat most of the time, depending on the brand and style. I've got a pretty big noggin, a big face, and I'm generally a pretty big guy.<br /><br />These glasses fit me well! They have spring hinges. Spring hinges are always welcome and I don't typically see spring hinges on sport/wrap style glasses like these. Again, I've got a big noggin and the spring hinges help assure that they'll at least fit. These fit nicely and the spring hinges don't squeeze my temples. I would describe the spring rate as medium, not super firm or very weak. The spring hinge on the left side has a great deal of up and down play while the right hand side is less wiggly. The temple pads are a little loose on the arms and can easily be slid off of the metal with minimal force.<br /><br />The top frame is basically one piece of what they call ""Al-Mg metal"", perhaps Aluminum and Magnesium blend? Anyway the metal makes the glasses feel overall more tough and premium than plastic materials in the same price range. In spite of the metal design they still feel fairly light-weight and are comfortable to wear. There is no flex to them when grabbing either side and giving them a gentle twist and the lenses seem well attached to the upper frame.<br /><br />The measurements provided by the seller all seem correct to within ~1mm as measured by a digital caliper.<br /><br />I notice the bridge pads are fixed and do not pivot but I don't find them uncomfortable. They of a fairly grippy rubber and the glasses stay put on my face well.<br /><br />These glasses have more of a gray tint. They have a sport/fishing styling but typical fishing glasses I've used tend to have the brown tint and that's a little better (in my opinion) for inland (typically brown-ish) waters like rivers and creeks where I fish and crab in my area. These glasses are (again in my opinion) better for driving and cycling and around town than for fishing.<br /><br />The larger and wider sport/wrap style lenses don't allow a lot of light to creep in around the outside which is of course on the advantages of that design over something like an aviator style.<br /><br />The polarization is legit, as tested with their test card, my computer monitor, and some water on the driveway outside. There are levels to polarization quality and some of the cheapest can have visible lines or deformation in the vision. While I'm sure these aren't the absolute pinnacle of polarization tech, they are good with no visual distortions good glare stopping and generally clear optical performance.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the darkest I'd put the shade level around a 3.5. you could wear them inside without tripping over stuff but they are sufficiently dark for a sunny day. For me these are driving and knocking around town and cycling glasses, I'd probably go for something in a more brown tint for fishing or crabbing on the water and possibly a little darker.<br /><br />In the package the glasses are fairly well protected with a plastic wrap and an individual plastic sleeve on one arm (pretty standard). You get the glasses, a branded polarization test card (with warranty info on back), a generously sized microfiber and microfiber storage bag.<br /><br />So all together these get a 4 out of 5. They are great glasses but there is nothing exceptional or shockingly good about them (which is my barometer for a 5 star review). The metal frames are neat but the loose hinge and temple protectors worry me a little about the overall build quality. They are a reasonable value in the sub $25 price point at the time of this writing but not an astonishing one."
4.0,"This is a fairly basic bag, but with enough pockets and zippered compartments to make it practical. The back zippered pocket (behind the flap) is really perfect for my little notebook and a paperback. The inside pockets for pens, etc. are also very handy. Certainly a great bargain."
4.0,I wish i could of got all 100 but i am pleased with the ones i got
4.0,"Cute, my toddlers walk fine in them. No chemical smell."
4.0,I liked them but they are a little to small. I wish they were just a little bigger or the pieces you use to tie were a bit longer.
4.0,it's all plastic.
4.0,Gloves are durable. I use them for dish washing. They save my hands from the hot temperatures of the water when washing. The only issue I had is the gloves can be hard to take off.
4.0,"Purchased for my granddaughter, not quite as roomy as I would like, rather snug. They are adorable though & I love the non skid feature."
4.0,"Pretty color and material, but the fit was incredibly weird in the hips. Not the back, mind you. It hugged my butt perfectly, as well as my upper half. But the sides, my hips-upper thighs, it created these weird bunches of fabric. I almost returned it, but in a stroke of genius I fastened a belt around my natural waist. It pulled the dress a bit more snug around my hips which did the trick - no more weird fabric bunches! If I could have ordered XS, I think I'd have given that a chance, but all that was available was Small. I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 32a-25-34 if that helps."
4.0,"Hello readers ; it has been a while since I have called upon all my readers. This is not my typical amazon used item. It’s brand new one. Purchased for my mother who kept forgetting where she has placed her phone. To avoid that problem... I turn to this strap like wallet phone keeper!<br />Werid what could be a rite name for it? Phone leech or wallet strap? Or just a dog strap?!?<br /><br />Anyhow; my mom uses otter box case for her phone. The plastic adhesive pad is placed between the phone and the back cover where it did click into place after a nice hard squeeze. Thank god it did not break the glass. However it did made it thick at the base. That is alright since the strap holds the phone and phone would be kept near my mom all the right so no more loosing phone.<br />That kind of worked for few days until my little man came and pulled it from her neck! It broke.<br /><br />The plastic adhesive has a metal circle space where it would prevent any tear on the plastic but no match for my little man.<br /><br />Over all, great for elders and kids. However I wish the company would spent bit more money on the adhesive pad where it is much stronger than a plastic."
4.0,To large For my girls they r 11yr and 8yr but warm
4.0,"Light weight, good fit, good Sun protection with quick transition to shade, All I was after at decent price. Buy it"
4.0,Love these earrings.  Nice color to dress up summer outfits!
4.0,Very Nice.  This is a very good value.
4.0,"I love the shape, nicely fitted.  The fabric has a lot of stretch, so I could have done with a smaller size. I ordered XL due to my large 38F bust, but the cut is very generous there with the gathers on the bust. A Large would have been quite adequate, and I might even have been OK with medium as the fabric is so stretchy, but then it would have been very hot.  I am only 5 ft tall, so had to cut off about 6 inches.  I do love the dress though.  The buttons could be a little classier."
4.0,good summer top
4.0,"Really liked these sunglasses and they seemed sturdy and well made. I am sending them back, however, because I was looking for something a little bigger. They measure right about 44mm tall and were a bit too narrow on me."
4.0,I was a little disappointed that the colors and pattern were a little off from what is depicted BUT the dress was still just as beautiful.  I'm 5'5 and wear a size 4.  I bought a large and it fit perfectly (probably could have gotten away with the medium too though).
4.0,Was a gift. She liked.
4.0,"It was a nice looking jacket. Had to send it back because it was just a little to snug. If you order, go one size up. I had to get a 2XL...(its a Euro cut)"
4.0,There were a few places on the pocket that stitching was torn. I love it and can sew
4.0,I wear a size 9 mens and these work well
4.0,"I have wider shoulders and always have a problem with top. But this cardigan has some wiggle room that allows my shoulders to fit correctly. Arm length is perfect too :) the material is thicker, so it was a good buy for me! (It's mustard, so it looks darker than the pic)"
4.0,A little difficult to put in but otherwise I'm happy with these.
4.0,"Love the colors and the look. Haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up with weekly pool use but I like the support and feel so far.  It does run large and I ordered down a size due to reviews saying the same thing. Fits good but I almost could have gotten away with ordering down 2 sizes. I wouldn't recommend that though, it would be pushing it. I would order 1 size smaller than your normal size for sure."
4.0,"The swimsuit was nice quality, but ran very large. I will return and order a smaller size. Since I haven’t worn it, I can not rate beyond the looks."
4.0,"Came in a sturdy case. The flex hinge is great. My only issue was size. I was looking for reader sized lenses n frames, not glasses. Otherwise I have no complaints."
4.0,I love this dress but the chest is a bit tight.
4.0,It seemed a bit big for a 3T but she will grow into it better than being too small
4.0,They are cute but the crystal on the sun keychain is supposed to be pink according to the photo and the one I received is white. The crystal on the moon key chain does have a subtle blue hue to it but is also pretty light in comparison to the photo.
4.0,Very satisfied with procduct
4.0,"This is not the kind of hat I wear on constant basis. But, at the right situation (with presence of bugs and mosquitoes), this is the only hat that I would like to wear. The design of this hat is quite interesting, it hides the attached mosquito net in a zipper pocket at the top of the hat. So, the mosquito net is fully concealed when not in use. When I need the net, just unzip the pocket and pull the net out. The net is big enough to cover the whole hat, my face, my neck, till it reaches my shoulder area. No hole for mosquitoes or bugs to sneak in.<br /><br />This hat is a perfect companion when hiking in parks with big trees, like the Big Basin Redwood park in San Francisco south bay area, where mosquitoes are always around as big trees block out plenty of sun light.<br /><br />The brim of the hat is kind of soft and floppy. Though, per my personal preference, I prefer a more stiffer brim to keep the hat shape, I understand the design intend of the soft brim is to make this hat fold-able for easy storage (to pack it into the backpack) when not in use during a trip.<br /><br />The hat is made of light weight nylon material, again, for the purpose of making this hat pack-able. Nevertheless, the light nylon material gives you a cheap-made feeling. Though it survives well after two machine-wash cycles during my ownership, I still suspect the longevity of the hat. I guess this hat is meant to be used on needed basis. In most of time, you can fold the hat and carrying it in the backpack.<br /><br />All in all, this hat meets it's product claim well. For that, I don't have complaint."
4.0,"Shipped in a good amount of time, way cute! Tons of room for everything you'll need in your wallet. It's a good size, not huge like some of the other reviews said"
4.0,"I love these little earrings :) My conch piercing gets a little irritated with them, but that’s easily remedied by not wearing them. It’s a finicky piercing anyway. The flat piercing does just fine with them."
4.0,"Beautiful color.  Got one for me and daughter.  She loved it.  The chain is a little short, but you can purchase extenders cheaply from Amazon to extend the length."
4.0,"Very cute shirt, the colors are super bright and the material is soft. I usually wear a Medium, but this shirt was a little bit. I would order a size down."
4.0,"This was very dainty and feminine.  I bought it as a gift for a teenager.  She liked it, but it did come apart the second time she wore it. It was fixable, but still....."
4.0,Somewhat large my baby doesn’t like them because they fit little big but pretty sure once she fits it will be great. They have a great grip.
4.0,We love the little purses.  They are very little and would work for a young girl.  Room for some money and lip gloss.  They are very cute.
4.0,"For the love of all that’s holy, what IS this thing on the back? Horrifying Friday the 13th Jason masks and a skeleton on a dead whale? Grim reaper on a tiger? I’m stumped. If you are looking for a truly ugly sweater that will guarantee nightmares, look no further!"
4.0,Lightweight breathable and great for fast and in a hurry. Harder to forget it when you go into a place cause it's already on your neck just pull it up over your mouth and nose tada.
4.0,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband. I did take out of package to check out. Size is accurate and the material feels comfortable. he does a lot of hunting and will be great for snowplowing and outside with son for winter. will definitely buy again.
4.0,beautiful synthetic wig. the look is perfect and doesn't get tangled as quick. multiple uses.
4.0,"Smaller than I expected. Their ink is also on the blue side. My puppy was a lot more red in color and the grass was a lot brighter. I provided my original photo as an example. The chain is dainty but seems sturdy.  I also didn’t expect it too be a photo glued on with a flexible plastic coating. I thought it would be printed on the metal. I am satisfied with it, but it would be better if the color was more true and less blue."
4.0,The fit is great.  Just wish they had darker tinted lenses.
4.0,Beautiful blouse but material is not the best in the summer.  Definitely perfect for the spring!
4.0,"Cute, fits good. Great for twist your hair up and go."
4.0,This dress is not only comfortable but it fit great. I am short waisted and this fits very nicely.
4.0,"Excellent product but not as durable as expected. First set broke after one month. However, great lifetime warranty."
4.0,Wish it was bigger.
4.0,This is a beautiful dress. Easy to wear and comfortable. My only issue is the straps. They seem to be a bit too long and b/c the fabric has a lot of stretch to it the sleeves slip down. I feel like I have to wear something under the dress in case it slips down on accident. I will be adjusting the straps and making them shorter so I can avoid any mishaps in the future.
4.0,Gifted to grandson.  He liked it.
4.0,Not particularly fashionable. They don't look very chick but they are just nice enough for the price. Plain white color. Good to match with your white shoes or shirt.
4.0,"I am 5'10'' and weight 215lbs.  I wear a size 16 in pants and wear a 36 C bra.  I ordered a 5xl and the bottoms fit perfectly.  The top is too small.  Story of my life though, i expected the top to be too small.  The seller only has this in a set, you cant buy separates, so choose what you want to fit and order accordingly.<br /><br />The material is good quality and it is constructed well.  I am ready for swim suit season!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Comfortable and not too heavy.
4.0,"Lovely, nicely made, but too small. I usually take a Xl/1x but this was way too tight in the top"
4.0,"Great gloves for winter riding, with or without heated grips. They are a little thick and take a little time getting used to them. I cannot stress how amazingly warm these gloves are."
4.0,"Have activated the 2 large luggage tags, the 3 mini tags, and the 3 stickers after fumbling with understanding the process and terms.<br />Instructions on-line could have been more helpful - constructive feedback.<br />Have NOT traveled yet, so no knowledge there.  Hope I don't lose luggage, so I figure these tags are a form of insurance."
4.0,They are very comfortable and seem decent but they are not red or dark red. Mine came and there a old lady nail polish dark reddish mauve color. Not as cool as I had hoped.
4.0,Have tried once so far but could not tell the difference yet
4.0,"It's a very cute satchel, and the khaki color is perfect for summer. I'm not sure how long it'd last, but considering its price, I think it's a good buy."
4.0,I loved them but the backs are too loose anf lost 1 earing stud
4.0,My daughter is 10-12 in womens and I purchased a large and it was way too small. I believe the sizing of these is in Jr.'s and not womens. The fit is for a slender figure.
4.0,Wallet was exactly what I needed. Very Pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"I was not expecting this dress to be so comfortable. I thought the glitter material would be so scratchy, but it definitely is not. It is very form fitting and I did not have any issues with the sleeves moving out of place since there is no back to it. It is flattering! I will say that it is a little short so it's definitely a going out dress and not an event dress."
4.0,Otherwise it is very durable.
4.0,However the spec arrived with a hairline fracture about 2cm long
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot. The sleeves are a little tighter than a regular t-shirt, but the print is bright and hasn't faded at all."
4.0,"I am pretty happy with this purchase. As other reviewers mentioned, the shirts are a little on a large side so I ordered M while I buy L from other makers. They turned out fitting exactly as I expected. I really like the fabric (it is smooth almost silky) and  the thickness of it (it is thin enough to wear a T-shirt underneath and not to sweat profusely). I like it and I probably will buy more from this maker. The only drawback is that color pallette is a bit odd. Most of their shirts I would not wear to work because they are so bright but they are great for a more casual wear."
4.0,"They do a good job at blocking blue light. Very lite weight. What I don't like is, the reflect everything."
4.0,No earrings as pictured but beads are lovely.
4.0,I'm 5.4 and 165 lbs and this is a snug fit in a size large but not tight... I'm usually a medium in Old Navy.  I did deduct one star for the sizing being a bit on the Asian side.<br />But the jacket is thick and very well made.  I love the pockets...which holds my phone easily...<br />The double zippered front is useful and funky.<br />At 5.4 the front shows no skin on me... I'm well covered.<br />I did like it enough to purchase the pink one as well.<br />And you can't beat the $12 price for a sport jacket with pockets and thankfully NO hoodie.
4.0,"Color is great. Fit is ok, front is a little short. I’m tall so this may not be an issue for most but is an issue for me. I still kept it just because I love the color."
4.0,It's a little bigger than I wanted. But it makes a great Christmas gift
4.0,"These are on the thinner side. Not a bad thing, just something to be noted. It really depends on what you are looking for: thick or thin socks. These for me are the kind of socks I wear with dressier flat shoes, like oxfords, that I don't have room within for a proper thick sock. They did the trick. They were a little visible, but not horribly so. They come in a variety of colors, gray, black, white. I did not end up with holes after one or two wears and they washed well. No complaints."
4.0,I bought two. They are stylish and looking good.
4.0,NIce colors
4.0,These are really nice but for some reason the black lace ones gets holes easily
4.0,"I'm a size small, but ordered a medium just in case! It was still a bit on the small side, but sitll nice! This product is pretty but just not for me."
4.0,Looks good on him
4.0,Not holding up as I had expected.
4.0,a little smaller than I was expecting but a nice belt!
4.0,My grandson loves them. He likes how they fit and feel and how easy they go on. He often chooses them even when the weather does not call for it.
4.0,"You must order 1 size up as many have stated.  I bought but 1 and 2 sizes up as I wasn't sure how well they would fit.  2 sizes up looked ridiculous.  1 size up is perfect. The right pocket seems to pull and you can see the liner, but that may just be the fact that I need to lose a couple of pounds.  I can't wait to wear them in Munich shortly."
4.0,"This not a bad top, it just doesn't fit as well as it could.  It's very boxy and quite as flattering as I'd hoped, but it's comfortable and good for running round in a casual way.  If I pair it with and button down seater or jacket it looks great."
4.0,"Golden watch & bracelet set with reddish tones on the gold color.  The strap of the wrist is 7"", diameter of watch 1"".<br />Good as a conversation piece, definitely at telling time and adding some more blinks to your outfit. A distinctive set with crystals on the watch and & the four middle links close to the watch itself.  The double bracelet chains are a refreshing surprise in a time that people spent so much of their creative energy just to look different. Well, wearing this watch could give you that kind of feeling. The set is pleasant to the eyes and works well as your time telling device, too."
4.0,I love this dress perfect fit and comfortable
4.0,Logo is not fully represented
4.0,"I sized up due to other reviews.  It fit great and I didn't find the arms too tight at all.  Not nearly as crisp as pictured, but it's a very cute and comfy jacket.  Pleased."
4.0,"I have hiked, walked, swam, gardened, and used these as just an every day shoe. They are very comfortable and have an awesome grip. I like them so much that I just bought my second pair. I left just 4 stars because I did get some holes at the top and front at the area of my big toe. I'm pretty sure I've had my first pair over a year though."
4.0,"the purse arrived as promised, well packaged. It is an attractive purse for the cost. It will hold lipstick ,keys, phone and a card or two ,not much else. When more is put in the purse, the magnetic snap does not stay closed."
4.0,"The wallet is great my wife is going to love it, it was delivered very quickly plenty of time for Christmas. I was a little disappointed to open the wallet and find a price tag from Dillards for less than what Amazon was selling it for."
4.0,Pockets are bit shallow for Wallets.
4.0,if you are in between a size small and a size medium go ahead and pick up the small.
4.0,This outfit arrived quickly and was price friendly for an impromptu 60s- 70s party. Everything fit well though the pants were too long for my 5 ft 2 frame. Will need to hem.
4.0,Kinda cheap looking but I still really like it
4.0,"I loved this piece! But I didn’t expect its length to be so small. It is 7 inches. But I expected there would be a little bit of play in the length, considering the clasp. Turns out it was just too tight. It was actually uncomfortable. Unfortunately I had to send it back. Not for lack of craftsmanship, but perhaps for consideration for the average size woman. 7 inches is just simply too short, I think."
4.0,A nice pair of bibs. The legs are a little on the small side.  They tend to ride up since there are no grippers on the legs.
4.0,"Pretty cool like some other comments a touch small for male wrist and the bands need sorting. But, nice looking and you can't beat the price"
4.0,Love it. Super comfy too. Just wish the selves were a little bit longer
4.0,Hat did come fairly wrinkled and took a long time for shipping.  I do love the style and it is very cute so I am keeping.  I hope I can get the fold lines out!
4.0,Runs very small. I would say 2 sizes smaller.
4.0,Very pretty earrings.Got compliments on them.
4.0,"The magnetic clasp is very strong and holds tightly. The colors on the leather  bracelet  are true red, white and blue.  On the bracelet  I  received  there is flaw  where the dye  didnt take  I  kept the bracelet  because I  was  able  to move the metal  piece to cover the flaw"
4.0,"Really cute product, however runs small in size. I'm typically about a size 6. Ordered a large due to others reviews, and it fit almost snug. If you are looking for  a loose fit you might need to order 2 sizes up. Otherwise everything is good. It's a fluffy material and really cute. I had the unicorn/polar bear combo."
4.0,"Got this for my daughter and think she is going to love it. It has a cute graphic with a soft feel. The stencil is a little bit ironed on looking, but overall it is a cute shirt for a decent price."
4.0,Excellent quality and arrived right on time.
4.0,Good deal for the price.  Still using them.
4.0,"It’s a nice quality fabric. Note that there are 2 “belts”, one fabric and the other leatherette.  They attach in the back with Velcro to allow for a more flexible fit.  The top is a cross- over front, with a single ribbon tie on the outside to hold it shut, again allowing flexible fitting. It is NOT a quick outfit to get on, and it could be helpful to have a helper to speed things up.  I doubt that the belts will hold any weight, so if you want to hang a sword at your waist, you may have to add additional support."
4.0,Nice swimsuit cover.
4.0,"comfy, very thin but looks great"
4.0,Your coffee is good! Thank you!
4.0,"Looks great, wish it had a better patting on the inside, only thing holding it from being a 5 star."
4.0,"My daughter loved it, she said the loves the cloth that comes with it even more"

4.0,I washed them once and the printed shiny details became so dull. Hand wash only.
4.0,"Love this, but I had to exchange because the zipper broke immediately."
4.0,GOOD WORK
4.0,See to lose a little bit of elasticity after wearing a few times (similar to how stretch jeans do). They're fine. Good for bigger backsides.
4.0,Very supportive. Swelling and discomfort is noticeably better.
4.0,I got a medium and it is loose around the shoulders which is tough because then the straps fall down. I got this in black as well as grey and I got a small in the black and it fits perfectly. The grey is a bit loose but not awful. the back is very pretty. You can wear no bra but there is no support. If you get a small then it will be tighter so it held my goods in place. I am 5'5 and 135lbs. The material is not too thin where it feels cheap. Its light and breezy
4.0,Doesn't seem to fit as well as described.  Won't order from here again.
4.0,"It's got a lot of zippered compartments, and I hope the zippers hold up over time. I am also concerned that the interior fabric is flimsy and may not survive years of daily use, but fortunately the bag was inexpensive. My one disappointment is that the strap can't be made shorter. I had to use binder clips on one end to get it to a length suitable for my short frame."
4.0,"Wish they stayed in my ears more securely, otherwise they'd get 5 stars."
4.0,I am very impressed by this shirt. It’s a fun pattern but also super functional and moisture wicking for golf. I took off a star because of a stain near the front zipper. I will be exchanging it for a new one. Other than the stain I am very happy with the design and quality.
4.0,"Not as stretchy, but over all great for the price!"
4.0,......seeing the belt close up I would rather have the inside design of the belt facing out.....it really looks like a mistake.....
4.0,Looks elegant and comfy - surprised that it fits well.
4.0,"I need to pay more attention to the size information for products.  Although this is pretty, it is much smaller than I expected.  Giving as a Christmas gift so I hope they like it."
4.0,Love the item only the shirt is a little smaller than I expected but shorts fit perfectly
4.0,"Nice stylish watch, you can't beat the price. They come with a large band so you may have to adjust it"
4.0,Nice band.  Wish there was a half link to allow more flexibility in sizing.  All in all a good purchase
4.0,"This is a very cute shirt, fits well. Very soft. It is kinda thin material, but it was perfect for his birthday!"
4.0,It looked like it was black and white and it is actually black and silver. Looks cheap because of the sparkle. The band is thick and comfortable. The bands do not click into the Iwatch sides so you have to be very careful when you are wearing.
4.0,"I don't like cap sleeves on me, so I gathered them and  now it looks great. and fit a medium USA"
4.0,I love the dress it’s super cute and it has pockets so that’s always a win. My only grievance will be the sleeves are too short on my arms. I thought they would go down to my wrist but sit more like a 3/4 sleeve which I’m not a fan of. I am 5 ft 4” and I ordered a small.
4.0,"Although the material is a little thin, it’s not see through so that’s not a issue! Cute shirt!"
4.0,"A little snug,  but looks nice. Dressy enough for a wedding, will be cool 8n the summer and the color is good for winter too."
4.0,"They suggest using your bust size, but whenever I do that, the tops feel a little too big. And the sleeves are way too long. Other than that, it's a nice top."
4.0,Pretty decent leggings. I got them on sale and they were good for the price
4.0,Very cute dress. Top is very open and low cut as shown but can be easily closed with a pin.
4.0,"This dress is adorable. I love the fit, the length of the hem and arms and the scalloped edges. The material does seem cheap, but for the price and the look, I really like it. I'm going to order another color.<br /><br />Ordered a medium. 5'2, 130, 32DD. Could've went to a small, but I'm glad I didn't because the material is clingy."
4.0,"Seems to be a nice product, it didn't fit me at all. The reviews said it was way to big, so I ordered a smaller size for me, didn't fit and I believe it may be true to the size not big as others clients say.<br />It slippery too, could have a non slippery sole."
4.0,Nice looking and seems well made.  Can't rate above a 4 as I haven't worn it yet.  Size is in line with other belts I have.
4.0,"Cute top, perfect for a golf outing. Wish the material was a little more comfortable but still a great top for the price"
4.0,Enjoyed for the first few months but then it started to pill very easily in the back and front
4.0,Shorter than picture suggests
4.0,"Wore these to a costume barcrawl. One lace kept going in and out, but all in all ok."
4.0,"I love this color and style. the buttons on the back are so cute! however, the v-neck dips very low and the shirt is shorter than I expected. Still super cute &#60;3"
4.0,I like the dress a lot...however the top portion is a little sheer and it does not fit under the bust line as pictured...but I will still wear it and ROCK IT!
4.0,They were a lot smaller than expected but i like them. theyre shiny.<br />and i got a free gift. Though i wish they were a pair of guy earrings.
4.0,It is well constructed and because it looks so different it gets a lot of attention when I go to meetings and such.
4.0,Awesome to get my weeks groceries from the car to the apartment!! Would be good for any car trip with insulated room for the drinks.Take the place of suitcase?
4.0,"Very well made. Very bright and pretty. Arms are just a tad short but not bad.<br />5'4 , 110 pound"
4.0,The pink looks brighter in the picture. Us mire of a light pink
4.0,Very happy with my outfit!! Ordered another color..
4.0,"For the price, can’t beat it. Will be cruising in March, so well worth taking the chance ordering before trying on. Suggest ordering size up. Fits great - would recommend"
4.0,"It's a decent, plain apron. It's advertised as &#34;plus sized&#34; but the cute cross-back wouldn't fit over my girlfriend's large chest (38/40 G). This was disappointing. However, we simply cut the straps so she could tie them around her neck and it functions just the same.  Also, it should be noted there are no pockets. I'm not including this in my star rating though because I assumed this judging from the image. I'm just pointing it out because another reviewer said there were pockets, which is strange..."
4.0,needed to order more husband keeps breaking them
4.0,"Gran cantidad de deptos, pero se despego facil el material en menos de un año"
4.0,"I purchased a 10 and normally in shoes I wear a 9 or 9.5. Tens usually work fine for me with boots but these were very small and tight. I had to return them. They even look small for a 10. I suggest you get at least 1 size larger than you would normally buy in a boot. I would likely get an 11 myself and I have never worn an 11 in my life. I went to order another pair after I arranged the return, but the price was over $30 more so I didn't order these boots again. They are great looking boots and I'm sorry I have to skip the order. One more thing, the brown is more of a chocolate brown rather than the taupe brown that was seen on my computer."
4.0,"A little much for me, but I wear it with pride."
4.0,"Hmmm – maybe not the best thing to have these to be used as both bracelets and anklets as the sizing is so different then.  For bracelets the multi string ones are just too lose for me even as tight as you can pull them – if you have very wide wrists they would fit you, though.  They make better anklets because of that.  For the ones that are double string – which is most of them – they fit either as a bracelet or an anklet as they adjust all the way down to the smallest possible size by pulling the strings completely.<br /><br />The issue with the dual sizing is that you have a LOT of string hanging of the backend of these things if worn as a bracelet and they look super ridiculous and like a mess.  Personally, I am going to trim 3 inches off each double string bracelet (1.5 inches each side) and re-knot so that I can wear them as actual bracelets.  The wide ones are fine as is because I can only wear as an anklet anyway and you need the extra string to fit it over the heel of your foot.<br /><br />They are generally cute and a pretty good value for what you get.  I only do not like the wave one as the metal is too long and MUST lay flat.  Otherwise, a cute set – or eventually with some crafting to be done on my part anyway.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )"
4.0,the wife likes it
4.0,"Decent for the price. They are quite large so be careful of your surroundings.  I almost lit one wing on fire at a bar on Halloween lol. I never used the halo and after one use these wings started falling apart, feathers started to come off. I might be able to repair them to wear another time."
4.0,I am very pleased with the suit. The size chart is pretty spot on. Though I think the bust area is a bit larger then I expected it to be it's not really noticeable. The price also can't be beat for the quality at a vintage inspired suit. I will be buying for them again.
4.0,"This cannot be a ""standard gents size"" watch band. I would have returned it if my wrists were any bigger. This is a fairly small watch band. It didn't come with instructions but you can goto YouTube & type ""how to replace a Swatch Watch band"" in the search & it shows you how! An inexpensive Swatch Watch band, shipped very quickly (-1 * for being small like kids size)"
4.0,Look and feel great. Only downfall is that the instructions say do not put in dryer. Not that easy for some people to do..
4.0,"Figured I'd give this product a try, the price was reasonable compared to many of the other wheel cleaners out there. I wanted to give this a shot to use along with a waterless car wash, during the winter I tend to do more waterless washes rather than a full wash. I sprayed it on the wheels, let sit for about 30 secs (per directions) and wiped it off with one my towels dedicated to wheels. There was a shine to the wheel and I thought it looked better than before, not sure it's not that much of a difference from when I use an APC style cleaner on them.<br /><br />I don't see this replacing my higher end wheel cleaners when I am doing a full wash, but for a quick cleanup I have no complaints. Plus they include a free micro fiber towel, for 10 bucks not a bad deal!"
4.0,Ordered small & it’s humongous. Size down .  Amazon taking back. If you have Apple figure this may be pant for you.
4.0,"They are very nice.  I wish the description had been more specific in describing the glasses.  They are a little short from top to bottom, but work fine--just a little of my glasses is not covered."
4.0,"I bought them for Halloween. The socks fit perfectly they stretch a lot, very comfy. However if you have thick thighs the socks rolled off to my knee. You can used double sided tape."
4.0,Good quality but it doesn't quite fit.  The magnetic snap is not reaching.
4.0,"The fit of this dress is super flattering! I just bought it in the second color.  I'm 5'2, 155 pounds, with a 38DD chest and the large is perfect. I also really like the print. I would have given it five stars, but the material is a bit cheap/thin and the material around the collar isn't sewn down (you have to tuck it in or press it with an iron). If this were lined and in a different material, there's no way you'd ever get me out of this dress. Still a win as is though."
4.0,"This outfit is absolutely adorable!  Material is soft and comfy.  Only problem is the size.  The 4 months - 12 months size would fit a toddler!  We decided to keep this one and ordered the 0-3 months size because we like the outfit so much.  With my grandbaby being almost 4 months, we are hoping the sizes are still running large and fit."
4.0,bright red - great for a pop of color
4.0,they're pretty.decent size.my ears are kinda of petite so they're nice for me..i don't wear them but a few times a year but could more if i really wanted to.
4.0,"Looks just like picture. Material is soft and slinky. I ordered a Large and it fit me a little larger than I would have liked, but nothing I cant deal with. Overall I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,love the short. Heard it ran small so bought a size larger.  Should have bought 2 sizes larger.  But it is well made.
4.0,its a Christmas gift
4.0,queda un poco pequeño pero es hermoso
4.0,very nice and t hey do the job.<br />the shade of the lenses is good and allows for good vision.
4.0,"It's really cool, but doesn't hold a lot."
4.0,A bit too large but I still love it!  Very comfortable!!!
4.0,Stockings make your legs look tan.
4.0,They were a bit snug but I really like the style and am working on losing weight so I should still be able to use them eventually.
4.0,this duster is so cute fits well everywhere but the arm hole and across the back shoulder area I just wish it was a little bit bigger.
4.0,"I like these. They feel like a Cotton blend cardigan, and keep my wrists warm when I type. They are cut narrow, both on the wrist and palm.  I have really skinny arms and tiny hands so it works for me.  I bought some then liked enough to buy a second pair as a gift."
4.0,"I normally wear a size 4 in kids for every shoe, this runs a bit small (my toe goes all the way to the front with no room), I recommend 1/2 size bigger"
4.0,"I love the fit and how comfy these pants are, however, I noticed a hole in the material of one of the pockets. Still love these pants and would order again, but bummed they already have a hole."
4.0,Nice but not for me
4.0,I think they're fabulous. To avoid tarnish maybe apply a top coat to remedy but I will not spend a lot of money for the actual product lol
4.0,"Love this dress!  I ordered the red polka dot & loved it so much I also ordered the black polka dot.  I must say that the pockets are lower on the body on the black polka dot dress than on the first red polka dot dress...which is weird!  Not bothered enough to return it though.  I’m already wearing it ;). Shrinks up in length after washing, rest of dress stayed fit."
4.0,I got Sun poisoning and an allergic reaction to it this year. Need to be more protected when in the sun. I  have larger upper arms and these easily fit. They stay up well enough. Like I can be patriotic at the same time. They are the same type fabric as swim suit.
4.0,"I get lots of compliments on these. They are a little heavy and solid. I like them but the only set back is the hooks tarnish your ears, leaving a green mark, so I need to replace the hooks with real metal or silver that I can get from a craft store. But hey can't beat the price, cheap."
4.0,"I like them, and so do others, however, one of the lenses popped out and I gently popped it back in.I have this in Black-Smoke....but Just ordered this COLOR, but they're the same Style."
4.0,"Worked great, carried over 20k steps per day.  2+ small pockets help.  Seems more durable than other cinch bags I've tried.<br /><br />Cons- main pocket could be slightly bigger (doesn't fit in an extra sweatshirt well) and straps aren't easily adjustable."
4.0,Fits too big in the growning area
4.0,"Maybe a little large, wasn't quite the detail I was expecting, but still cute.  And the supplier was very helpful!"
4.0,"SOoo sad to have had to return this bodysuit as it had been exactly what I’d been looking for to wear under a vest as my work uniform to avoid the annoyance of constantly retucking all day long! The fabric is very nice and breathable, and it’s constructed very nicely. Only thing in the fabric is I was expecting the blue to be more of a powder blue, but it’s a bit more vibrant of a sky blue- but i understand this could just be because of my computer/phone screen. Still a nice blue, but would have preferred it lighter.<br /><br />I ordered a size 2 in style 9- both in white and in blue, and while everywhere else it fit perfectly, it was sadly too tight across the bust, causing the buttons to pull across my chest. I’m 5’7”, 115lbs, 33” chest/32D bra, 25” waist, 33” hips and am usually a size small in bodysuits& tops/0-2 in dresses/25 in jeans (just to give you a better idea about size& fit if you’re close to my stats). It’s sad because aside from the bust, the torso arms and shoulders may as well have been tailored for me! It’s a very nice, slim fit, but not so much made for curvy gals with larger chests- i was surprised to find the body of it so straight and without darts or anything to accommodate much more than minimal curves.<br /><br />Another thing to mention, is the length was pretty long.. i have a freakishly long torso- often times having to size up in bodysuits just to fit my torso length- and i surprisingly found this to be slightly too long in the torso by an inch or two. Not sure how the length differs as you go up in size, but may be slightly annoying if you’ve got a shorter torso.<br /><br />I may reorder in a 4 to see if the chest is better- hoping the torso isn’t much longer though! Hoping it fits because this is a great shirt/bodysuit. Just remember if you’re curvy or busty, consider ordering up 1 to 2 sizes!"
4.0,"Love the feel of them and look of them. However, I’m 5’7 and they are about a foot too long for me. So be prepared to hem them A LOT.<br /><br />However, don’t let it stop you from buying them. I bought another color two weeks later.<br /><br />First pair was a small & I thought the waist band was a little uncomfortable while sitting at my computer all day, so the next set I went up a size to the medium & I am literally swimming in them. So I wish I had stuck with the small on both sets. But again, wasn’t a deal breaker. They are so comfy I can handle the baggy medium set & will just wash in hot water to try and Shrink a bit."
4.0,I think I threw out the adjustment tool. I didn't realize it was in the box. Is it possible to adjust the watch without the tool?
4.0,"I really didn't know what to expect as I haven't worn a coat like this since I was a kid.  I ordered a 2x and it was true to size for me.  There is still enough room if I want to add some layering.<br />The hood, which is detachable, is very deep.  I had to pull the strings very tight and clasp them to bring in the hood closer to my head so I could see to both sides.  I'm not complaining, just observing.<br />The pockets are lined and very soft.<br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when the hood is detached, the neckline of the jacket is almost in your face.  I couldn't fold the neckline back because it would just pop back up.  I ended up folding it inside the jacket.  I am keeping the jacket and will add a couple of pieces of adhesive Velcro to hold the neckline back when not using the hood.  I am very pleased with this jacket."
4.0,"They're neat but too small to really show good detail, however I still like them, I'm a Whovian afterall."
4.0,Does what it's suppose to do.  I use it to organize loose items in my purse.
4.0,"The dress is very comfortable, the material is layered so no problem with being too thin.<br /> I loved my first order from Modenmiss that I end up ordered 3 more items and they all are exactly what they look like on the models. I will be ordering more from this vender."
4.0,Really like ti but appears a little small.
4.0,"The material looks stretchy but, it’s not. It’s more scratchy. Not itchy though. The waist band is too tight but, not in a control too way, the sewing will crack if you try to get into them. The hips are too narrow. These are smalls but, I can tell by the way these are made that they are cheaper than the Pants I usually buy from IUGA. The length for size small is perfect for short people. Any taller than 5’1 they would be capris."
4.0,It’s a good looking pair of boots. Fits as expected.
4.0,"This bra is comfortable,but it offers little support,as most bandeau bras do. So if you have large breasts and absolutely need a lot of support,you might want to consider buying a regular strapless bra. If you need less support,than this will work."
4.0,It's saddle soap.  This particular brand is nice and soft in the can and very easy to use.  The best part was the can is very simple to use.  I primarily own another brand with a small metal wingnut shaped piece you have to twist.  This can you just pinch at the right spot and it pops right open.
4.0,"Products cleans the shoes well, but over half of the liquid soap leaked out in the package. Manufacturer needs to put some sort of seal on the bottle."
4.0,"Easy to put on, great for adjustments on ears and face, breathing is easier and fun fabrics.  The only thing I would have like to see in the package is at least two plain scarfs. Like a white, almond or even black."
4.0,Clasp is hard to fit
4.0,My husband loves his. He works with his hands and couldn't wear a traditional ring. Wish they had half sizes. But I bought it a half size big and it stretched fine to fit him.
4.0,"Very comfortable, fabric is soft."
4.0,The band is a little too small for my wrist. It is tight too.
4.0,"Okay, so these earrings are pretty dang huge. Now, the measurements are right there in the description, so I’m not marking a star off for that. They’re prettily constructed, and SOLID. The wire used is the kind that will bend and hold its shape, so if you’re looking for movement, look elsewhere. The glue holding in the rhinestones is a little obvious, and the rhinestones don’t seat perfectly.<br /><br />If you’re looking for costume jewelry, want to cosplay as a specific type of elf, or maybe want to incorporate these into hairpieces, I’d recommend.<br /><br />If you’re looking for something a little more delicate for a wedding or special occasion, I’d look elsewhere."
4.0,I liked this product but gave it a 4 because they were a little bit smaller then I was expecting but they are nice.
4.0,"These work perfect for me. I can fit my phone in the pocket when I am cycling or running. They put a little flap on the top to cover the zipper, suggest they do the same for the bottom since it rubs against your chest. I put some soft cloth tape over it to prevent the tube."
4.0,Just a great piece to have in your closet. Make sure to wear underwear without panty lines since it's thin jogging material.
4.0,"I've been using this for a year. so far, it hasn't come apart ever unless i pull it apart on purpose. Not in my pants, or pulling it out of my pocket or dropping it. I'd say it seems pretty sturdy and works as intended. Expensive for such a small connector. Icon on the side fades over time as things rub against it."
4.0,Really like the wallet. The zipper sticks only concern is if will last
4.0,A little snug & thin material but I love the style!
4.0,Exactly what i asked for. Masks light up and look exactly like picture. Plastic is a little flimsy but all in all great buy for the price.
4.0,This dress fir great!  my only complaint is I am 5'6 and the dress is just a smidgen too short. I like my long dresses to my feet and this one hits right at my ankles.
4.0,"I do like them, but they can be a little uncomfortable since they have zero stretch to them. Mine fortunately fit me a little loose so it’s not a huge issue, I went ahead and kept them. But I would recommend to size up. Other than that they are cute mom shorts."
4.0,"Good quality clothing, but knowing how rough I can be with clothes I ripped the side of the front pouch :/ I still wear it becuase it's a comfortable and warm hoodie!"
4.0,Really nice quality shirts just runs smaller than expected. Order a 10/12 runs more like an 8 for example.
4.0,This prosthetic works better on older children or adults. Overall it holds its shape decently and attaches easily. Issues that I encountered were that it became much harder to use the second and third times and thinner material than expected. It matches a medium tone stage makeup but is too flimsy to cover if you don't like the color it is initially. Overall it worked well for our costumes.
4.0,"Nice quality, needed to return because too large.  would buy again."
4.0,"It's a nice blouse, but it was a bit short"
4.0,Very nice. They look great and arrived quickly.
4.0,"I like the style and comfort.  But I found the temple may slip off from the holder when you remove the glasses.<br />It usually happens only to one of the two temples, so I have not lost any of my glasses.<br />Also if you don't write the review right away, the seller will email you repeatedly、which was annoying to me, as I want to write reviews when I am available.  Otherwise it is a good holder."
4.0,This was great! Just like name brand
4.0,"I bought these boots for myself (an adult woman with minuscule feet), and they fit well. They are comfortable and easy to get in and out of, but I am not thrilled with the level of traction they provide. I was walking uphill in some partially-packed snow last night, and found myself slipping a bit. Also, I wish the laces were more functional, rather than just decorative."
4.0,"Very good quality dress, however - if bending over, will show the goods. Best to wear with very short shorts,  leggings, or opaque tights."
4.0,I really like the different designs
4.0,this set was just ok. I have purchased better ones for the price.
4.0,I absolutely love these earrings. They are so pretty! The only thing is that they are not as red as I thought they would be. They are a little more on the pink side.
4.0,"I ordered these to lounge around home in, they’re soft and comfy although the waistband is a bit thick/wide. My biggest issue is they’re quite long for my 5’4” self, so the cuffs drag unless I roll the waistband to shorten them. And the drawstrings are crazy long, not sure what that’s about. But they are soft and comfy for sure. May work better for tall people."
4.0,"Great looking shirt, just a little soft, slightly clingy. Ordered large."
4.0,"This is ADVERTISED as Murano glass, but when the package arrived, it states it's &#34;reminiscent&#34; of Murano jewelry. Of course, I suspected as much by the price. And it IS very, very similar and could easily pass as such. I'd have bought it anyway even if I'd known it was a reproduction.  I'd have given it 5 stars except for the false advertising."
4.0,I bought this shirt in 2 colors but same size. The blue shirt fits perfectly but the red is a bit larger. Still a nice casual top.
4.0,"I really liked the contrast of grey and hot pink (super cute!) and the design also has utility. Since it has less bulky straps, it allows for more breathing room & doesn't weigh you down too much when you're getting a solid workout in. I also appreciate the extra padding to give me that ""oomph"" for my smaller chested chicks!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress.  I'm taking it with me on our vacation to Punta Cana in two week.  The material is light and comfortable and the dress is so cute  With that being said, I do have to put a cami under it because the bust is just to tight to button.  I am 5'6&#34; and 170 lbs and a large usually fits perfectly, The rest of the dress is very flattering on."
4.0,Cute and comfortable. They are lightweight and don’t bother my ears throughout the day. I noticed that one earring is justly slightly more uncomfortable to thread through my ear than the other. I don’t have any issues throughout the day with them sliding around or anything. I think they are a slightly paler pink than in the picture.
4.0,Bought for a gift.  She loves it and the fact that it is so light and goes with many of her outfits.
4.0,Love the leggings oueen long sleeve top.
4.0,Great material and value. Odd neck flap however.
4.0,Nice shorts....they apparently run small...need to order a size larger than normal....
4.0,"I love the shorts, fit and look good. Only concern is that in the description, it states that it’s a 3 pack and I only received 1 pair. Definitely a misprint somewhere."
4.0,uncomfortable around the ears
4.0,"Nice quality leather. It does seem a bit tight when trying to fit cards and money, but I think it will loosen up when the leather stretches and breaks in."
4.0,The pattern is lovely and the colors are beautiful. It is a little too long in the back but I actually do not mind that much.
4.0,really long and the ides do a weird puff out thing but my mom is going to fix that and It was worth the money
4.0,I  like very thing about these
4.0,My 13 year old who is thin was not able to fit this size 14 suit :(  Nice quality but not a good fit for her
4.0,Good fit and warmth
4.0,The strap is good for a $13 strap. But its not as soft as bands costing $5 more. Ill keep it but wont be buying more.
4.0,Super cute. But VERY short it's good for a swimsuit  cover up.<br />To short for dress .
4.0,Used this to travel. The expandable zipper was a nice addition but also made accessing the main compartment a bit difficult as the top portion is still slim. Loved that this was a secure bag with very little risk of having anything pickpocketed in crowded markets.
4.0,"Amanda jeans are my favorite.  Fit, wear, look -- just right."
4.0,I would have gotten a smaller size.
4.0,"Good goggles, great customer service.  Had some problems with the curved lens and Aegend representative aided me in getting a pair of googles that worked for me."
4.0,I really like these. They don’t poke me in the back of my ear and are very comfy. The moons poked me and they don’t look right in my nose.
4.0,"This does not appear to be a mens jacket. Zipper is on the wrong side, typically associated with women's jackets. In addition, as an XL it's on the small side. For me, XL is normally a comfortable, slightly loose fit. Makes layering easier. This jacket is very tight, as in I would need to lose 10 pounds to get it to fit comfortable for me. The photo of it being packed into it's bag is misleading and not to scale. It does not pack that small. But it's still small enough to pack in a vehicle for emergencies, or in a backpack for hiking.<br />Material is as to be expected, typical nylon. Stitching is good and strait. Seems decently warm for late fall temperatures. Not sure how it would fare below freezing.<br />Not a bad jacket, but not a 5 star either."
4.0,Ended up fixing this outfit (it was ripped in package? and wore it for key west zombie bike ride in Florida . I live on this island this event I do every year<br />I loved how it looked. 5’9 ft. 205 weight❤️
4.0,Very cute but not for my fat foot baby lol I should have gotten bigger but I went by chart
4.0,It's very soft and pretty. Wish I would have gotten a different color. The white is more sheer then I would have liked. Very nice though.
4.0,They're super cute and perfect for 1 year old son. They adjust well but it's easy for it to be undone.
4.0,"Very cute, not as comfortable as the vinyl style and a little difficult to attach. But it worked and it's cute."
4.0,Very cute. Nice and roomy. But the material feels cheap.
4.0,I love the waist on these skirts but I am 5' 5'' and they were a bit long. But I love how flowy the fabric was.
4.0,"Not overly fancy, but are cute and can only wear for a short time since it is not a good quality chain, but fun to wear on occasion....."
4.0,"The chain that goes around the finger was broken on arrival. No biggie, nothing a pair of pliers couldn't fix. Two hours of wear later and the other side came apart. Again nothing that can't be fix with pliers but a little disappointing. Otherwise liked it and it looked good, perfect for any snake-themed costumes or outfits!"
4.0,This scarf is large and very nice but also very light weight.  I think it's nice as a scarf but might be too lightweight if you want to use it as a wrap.
4.0,"It's always a struggle to find sunglasses to fit my face.  Even though I'm an adult, I decided to try these, and I'm glad I did.  They fit my face really well and are super comfortable.  Not high-quality sunglasses, but I'm okay with that.  The only thing I really don't like is that the Juashine brand name is printed in small bright white letters on both arms. I get that companies want to feature their brand name, but if it has to be there, I wish it were in a more subtle print and on only one side."
4.0,Fit well and definitely made me sweat like crazy. Pretty good overall
4.0,"The color is more of a dark wine, not red. The fabric is a thin nylon, almost a nightgown material. But it fits perfect (I'm a solid size 14) and it will stretch to accommodate shape and curves. Thin enough to wear comfortably in summer."
4.0,Cute earring but some look funny on my ear
4.0,"This sports bra is good, but not great. I love the look of it, and it fits perfectly. It is wonderful to work out in and matches well with all of my black yoga pants. However, the padding moves around a bit, and that is frustrating. I like a padded sports bra, but it helps if the padding stays where it is supposed to."
4.0,Has some creases due to shipping but that's to be expected. Hat fits a little snug on my head but it still wearable. Very cute hat though
4.0,"These shorts are cute and stretchy but they are a little short in my opinion.  I am 5'5"" 185lbs and 36 yrs old with not toned thighs and I got the XL and I typically wear a 12 and sometimes a 14 depending on the brand and even a 15 or 17 in junior sizes if that helps anyone. I would prefer these to be about 1/2 inch - 1 inch longer but they work for cheapie summer shorts. I ordered them in the blue and gray denim."
4.0,"This was super cute, it was just too small. I am 5'7&#34; 150 pounds and a 36B and the medium was way too tight and short. I guess that was my fault for ordering too small."
4.0,The fabric is very slick and hard to walk in at first.
4.0,I bought this item thinking it was more of an Orange color as that what it looks like on Amazon but In hand its more of a pink
4.0,A little hard to put on but became easier with experience.
4.0,"Worked great for my costume, but I'm 5'2&#34; and 105lbs and the small was a little short when I stood up tall/put my hands up. It fit okay everywhere else, though, so I'm not sure if a medium would have been too big. Regardless, I normally wear a size XS, so I agree with everyone that has said to order a size up. Aside from the length, it was fairly comfortable. However, I only wore the leotard once, and it already shows some scratches in the shiny material. I can't see it standing up to long-term use, but it was perfect for my event. Overall, four stars--would buy again."
4.0,"large, but comfy so it's good pajama"
4.0,"I like this product I ordered two for a mismatch for a holiday party. Green top and red bottoms. Would be cool if they sold them separate but it’s whatever. It’s a cheap party suit, I’ll probally spill jager and tequila all over it but the material looks very liquid resistant. Going to try to steam out of bag, there are a ton of wrinkles. But overall very excited about this product and would buy again."
4.0,"I like how the shoes look just like the image shown, I bought size 13 and they were true to size.<br />My 6 year old daughter thinks that they were very comfortable."
4.0,"I ordered a medium. I weigh 135 and am 5'7"".  It would fit a bigger bust than my 36B. I had to take it in in the bust. The length was good. Length was only 4 inches from the ground with heels. Did not touch the floor. Beautiful lacy material. Came in good condition. True to color."
4.0,Good belt but not for skinny people.
4.0,these are made pretty well actually they have uv protection and medal hinges and mirror lenses what more can you ask for
4.0,"It's really pretty a little bigger than I expected but beautiful, got lots of compliments!"
4.0,Dress was a little too short
4.0,"These awesome 360 ties are true to it's name.  They're modern, classy, stylish and look good with a variety of outfits.  Quality is good,  durable,  doesn't feel cheap or flimsy.  Colors are statement-making without looking overly tacky.  I recommend them."
4.0,It is comfortable and delivered on time
4.0,Cute Halloween outfit for the price. Pants were a bit short in length but my 2 yo is tall.
4.0,"Beautiful, but tight in the arms and bust."
4.0,I would give 5 stars if they were not see through BUT once I hit third trimester I didn't care if you could see through them because they were honestly the most comfortable thing in my closet. I would wear with an over sized shirt or tie something around my waist to cover the butt. The pockets were very convenient for holding my phone and keys on walks. They washed well and I pretty much wore them multiple times a week. HIGHLY recommend. I sized up from my usual size and they fit from 20 weeks pregnant to 40 weeks pregnant!
4.0,"Very nice band, good value, would give it 5 stars except that we couldn't put it on my husband's watch and had to go to a jeweler.  It is very well made and he likes the fit and the button on the closure to open it. Looks better than the original band on the watch!"
4.0,"It's a little big on me but it's comfortable, I am 5 foot and weigh about 125 with a D cup. Going smaller with boobs as big as mine would have been a pain because the shirt is hard to get over my head already. But it is a pretty shirt, you just have to iron the v in the front because some of it buldges after the 1st wash."
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my grandmother because she loves those colors. I was worried because it’s a Young style but it worked great. Colors are nice, fit is a little small but nice if you order the size up. Also it’s a bit sheer so plan for an undershirt."
4.0,"Cute, casual, fit as expected. I am 5ft tall and it touched the floor."
4.0,I bought it as a Christmas gift so I really can't attest to the quality of it but I love the color and the material and the cute saying on it will be fun for the person receiving this as a gift.
4.0,"Theses hold your phone well and seem like a decent product, especially for the cost."
4.0,Felt good and was able to wear them for a couple of hours.
4.0,"It’s really a woman’s watch, however, the child who received it loves it, so that’s what matters!"
4.0,These were a gift and the person I got them for loved them.
4.0,They're super cute rings. The only thing is that they're kind of big. They don't really fit like knuckle rings on me but they're still super cute so I'm keeping them! :)
4.0,This bathing suite is cute. A little loose on the top but the bottom is fitted. Overall cant wait to wear it.
4.0,"Very nice top, but a little pricey for the material. It's a little bit small, but doable. If you don't like tops tight, order one size larger than you think you need."
4.0,Purchase for great grandchild.  She seems to like them.
4.0,Daughter loves it! Had to order more!
4.0,I saw a few good reviews on this product. Decided to purchase a small one for myself. I been working really hard to lose more weight and tone up my body. So far so good.
4.0,Meets as expected.
4.0,not as vibrant. still blue. still cute.
4.0,"Material is nice and I love the pockets. The polka dots are big and not really a navy blue like picture. I will still wear this dress, it is very comfy."
4.0,Order a size or 2 up. But still very nice
4.0,"Works on my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2. Very nice and breathable, much better than the OEM bands. They are a bit big though, so I have to have it tightened all the way down to be snug on my wrist. That's not a bad thing though, I do have small wrists. Overall would recommend, especially for the price.<br /><br />Edit: 01/13/22: After much use over the summer, the black band has decided it wants to become a totally different shape. It's longer or shorter in some places, like the elastic shrunk/stretched permanently. It looks totally wonky and doesn't stay on my wrist as well as it did to begin with. Luckily the grey strap is still going strong. Overall, I'd say they're still amazing bands, but I've reduced my rating to 4 stars, since longevity is clearly a problem. Still amazing value when you consider the price though."
4.0,"5ft'2 165 lbs 36B/C chest. Bought Large but probably could also fit a medium.  This is a cute dress but not too well made, some strings and threads loose. I think I paid $30 with the shipping so it was worth it.  The fabric is on the thinner side but it still hangs well. It is not lined and is very light weight, it will not ""hold in"" any curves or bumps, so its not a ""snatching"" fabric.  I am adding a belt because the waist sits a little funny but the style is so cute and I needed a halloween theme dress for the office and this is safe for work. Comes to just below my knees. I would buy another if they made it in orange and black but not for more than 30."
4.0,"this held up well, it didnt tarnish, very pretty, but easy to get snagged on clothing"
4.0,Great belts and very comfortable for big men
4.0,Good working bag
4.0,"I love how soft these are and how they fit. They aren't too tight but they aren't as loose as wearing boxers. The only problem I've had is after washing them a few times, the seam near the crotch comes apart on several pair."
4.0,"I really like this dress, except for the zipper.  It is difficult to zip / unzip without help.  It is just in a weird place (the side) Once on, the dress is excellent. I love the color, pattern, style."
4.0,I bought these glasses as backups for my normal reading glasses. They work great and the only negative is that I am not that fond of the bright colors.
4.0,"Really cute, I'm short so I liked that it wasn't long on me. Hit just above the knee. I ordered a medium,  a small would have worked better."
4.0,It's very charming and nice:)
4.0,really nice!<br />looks great<br />& seems to be high quality.
4.0,Love it. It is delicate but so cute.
4.0,The buckle part feel flimsy but other than that i like it
4.0,"I bought this for my husband who only occasionally wears his watch. I had read all the reviews talking about its noise so we set it up in the corner of my home office. We didn't need to worry; it is a very quiet little thing. A couple of times while I have been sitting at my desk I've had to look around to find out and then remember that it's there when I notice a tiny whirring sound. The only real issue is that the watch doesn't fit on the little pillow with the clasp closed. It's not a very large watch either, one of the older (medium by today's standards) versions. All in all, I'm pretty pleased with this winder."
4.0,"I took a chance on this after seeing it used in a tournament on TV.  I bought it for our lodge.  Many had never seen such a thing and doubted its value.  I can tell you now that most of us use it exclusively instead of the wooden rack and the racks are perfect.<br /><br />There are still some who prefer the wooden rack, but I have no idea why.  We just spent hundreds of dollars recovering the table with the best cloth available.  Why anyone would want to use the wooden rack is beyond me.  Our old cloth had ""tiger claw"" lines and if I see them developing on the new cloth, I'm going to burn the wooden rack.<br /><br />My only concern is that someone will be careless and crease it.  At this price, I'm hoping it will last forever if treated gently."
4.0,They fit like supposed to
4.0,"I love Bandolino shoes overall and these boots are NO exception. I love the color and the shape of the shoe. There are great for work (although I wished the heel was a tad bit lower), but I like that I can dress them up by wearing slacks or dress them down by wearing bootcut jeans. I am happy with the boots, and even happier I got them on sale!"
4.0,"They are beautiful, but smaller than expected. They were bought for a woman but ended up giving them to a young girl in the family due to them being smaller than anticipated. But, overall like I said they are beautiful and the young girl loves them!"
4.0,Not factory good but way cheaper than new sunglasses.
4.0,"Very pretty, especially considering the price. The posts were bent and the earrings wouldn’t latch, but it was very simple to fix them. For the price they are a nice option. I will wear them when I am going to events where I don’t want to wear my expensive jewelry, yet want to feel beautiful."
4.0,Product does glow in the dark like stated. The fit is ok they stick out a little so you can tell that they are replacement. Overall they will work. Price was decent also.
4.0,the blue is much brighter and so are the dots.
4.0,"The band is a little tight for the amount of compression it gives the girls (I'm a 36B for reference, I ordered a medium), but I'll work with it for that phone pocket!"
4.0,"The dress I purchased was pretty. However, the arm area was too snug."
4.0,"Very pleased with the quality and how unique these shoes are.  Looks just like the image. I wear a perfect US size 8, ordered size 39 and they are a little tight around the toes, wearable for awhile but more like a 7 1/2 than an 8.  Ordered these for a birthday present, good thing I ordered a month in advance as it took that long to receive them.  Customer Service was very responsive and helpful with some of my questions, will order again!"
4.0,This is a cute romper. I am 5'4 140 pounds and recommend a medium. I purchased this romper in black and now ordering another color.
4.0,"Good white silk bow tie. Feels smooth in one direction but is rough feeling in the other, true silk should be smooth all around. Other than that this looks like it is a good white bow tie. Very minor, but the notches for sizing aren't marked, so I used one of my other bow ties to get the same length"
4.0,"Thin casual pants. Will be good for summer. Very roomy and loose fitting, usually get plus but probably could have ordered regular."
4.0,Good product. I'd like it better if the 'I heart raves' label wasn't visible on the back of the boxers when flipped.
4.0,"Like the pants, they are cool in hot weather and the price is good. Only thing is I thought they were navy, but they are a little lighter blue than navy and don't match my uniform shirt. But they are a nice shade of blue, I like them and wear them off duty and at the gun range."
4.0,Liked everything about this dress except the neckline....it was too snug around my neck and I am not a big person...for this reason that's why I gave 4 stars. Will be returning.
4.0,The frames are heavier then most so more durable. They work well on computers. Only down fall is that the hinges tend to break after 6-12 months of everyday wear.
4.0,Am a 38ddd and 200lbs this dress fit as aspected. It was not to tight
4.0,Shipping was great. Item and color came as described. They are very light weight.  I wore them to a wedding and got a lot of compliments on them. They matched my shoes and clutch perfectly. Only con is that one of the the tassels fell off after 1 wear but it hard to notice the missing tassel when it’s on.
4.0,Great for blackberry bushes!
4.0,"Dress is nice, but the collar of this dress is big."
4.0,"This dress runs slightly large. I'm 5'5&#34; and it's just a little below my knees. I'm 180 lbs, 40 - 33 - 42, bought Large and it's slightly loose on me. It's also very stretchy so I could've gone with a medium but it's also very flowy and swingy. The quality is ok, so I'm gonna keep it but it's not my most remarkable purchase."
4.0,smaller than the iPhone bands but fits perfectly. Good value for the dollar
4.0,warm and cozy. good product
4.0,"Thick, tights like material with no logo, which is necessary for my uniform at work. I use these to cover my tattoos and they do that splendidly. I'll probably order another set as backup."
4.0,"The panties ran a little small, but I love the quality of the product."
4.0,"I looked the length of the dress with 2"" heels it was the perfect length.  I'm 5' 8"""
4.0,"I was a little iffy with the lack of reviews for this shirt.  I am always more confident purchasing items that have been tried and verified, but took a chance with this one, and it paid off.  I wear a large in most t-shirts, ordered a large and it fits comfortably.  Its a little on the bigger side of a large I would say, but considering I'll be wearing it at softball fields with shorts and jeans, its perfectly comfortable.  Another plus, is that the fabric is very soft."
4.0,"I was looking for luggage tags to make it easy to find my luggage when traveling at airports.  This tag is pure leather and has an extra long strap to fasten to your bags.  The Bible verse Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 says the following:  &#34;For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end&#34;.  The tag does not have this entire scripture printed on the tag nonetheless, this is still a quality luggage tag."
4.0,i have not used yet since i have not got it pierced yet but it is absolutely beautiful
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but with this type of material, if you have any bumps or bulges it doesn't hide them!"
4.0,Love this coat. The only thing I wish would be fix is the pockets. They're set way to far back.
4.0,"It is my fault for not reading the reviews on this and for ordering my normal size, a large. It fit so small I couldn't even button it up. I am 5'8, between 145-150 lbs, and while a size large may fit a little snug with some styles, I have NEVER had a size large top fit so small I couldn't button the thing up. I was very disappointed too because, wow, this shirt is comfortable and feels so nice on your skin. The velvet material is very attractive to the eye and should definitely bring many compliments and maybe a little bit of envy.  That's why I am returning the one I have and ordering another one two sizes up, because I don't think I can trust an XL to fit comfortably on me either.<br /><br />Update:<br />A 2XL fits perfectly! I ordered a second one in grey. Next time I'll be sure to check the reviews and make sure I am looking at AMERICAN sizing."
4.0,These are great. To he expected- his face stretches
4.0,"Little tight, with my water retention you sometimes are able to see the ring at the bottom of my ankle"
4.0,comfyyyyy
4.0,"They fit great and they’re very comfortable. Not see-through at all. Only thing I don’t like is that the fabric holds every piece of lint and hair it comes in contact with, so have a lint roller at hand if you’re going out in them."
4.0,"Pretty bracelet, great for a new nurse. A bit large for smaller boned people."
4.0,"Great purchase, love the skirts and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. The material wasn't what I expected, but I read the reviews before I purchased so I was prepared for it to be a little glossy but it was more structured than I expected. But it still moves with you and it's very comfortable.<br />It's also longer than I expected I've alway had issues with skirts/shorts being really short on me because I have long legs but this skirt came to my calf. I ordered 2 mediums and one is a little smaller than the other around my waist but thank God for the elastic waistband. Overall love them and would purchase again. I'm 5'9&quot; 175lbs. Waist is a 30. Med fit perfect"
4.0,Holy dinner plate!!!!! lol way to big and heavy ...I plan to make two necklesses with them. They are very beautiful other than that.
4.0,"Great, :-)"
4.0,"My first band broke after 6 months of wear, after writing a review the seller contacted me and sent me a new band ($0.06 charge). I am pleased with the replacement band I received today and customer service."
4.0,"Fit as expected wanted a looser fit. Only down side is there were no belt loops so the grey sash provided keep riding and bunching up. In place I used a leather belt. Good for the price. 4’11 and could wear it with 4 inch wedges and not need to carry it or hold it up all night. Not see through, pockets are not bulky. Lots of compliments!"
4.0,Fit just right for watch just like it came with it
4.0,"Dress is good, fall dress"
4.0,"Bought this for a 7 1/2-year-old who normally wears a US size 8/10. I bought the size 150, which supposedly fits ages 9-11... the bodice is fairly close-fitting and it hits above the knee, so I highly doubt this would adequately fit any 9+ year-old, unless they are very slim and petite. It's made out of &#34;bathing suit material,&#34; as the kid put it, so it does stretch, but I wish it came in a larger size."
4.0,The ring is attractive and well made but BE SURE you are ordering the correct size. To return the ring to the seller in India will cost as much as what you paid for the ring!
4.0,"The gator is light weight and fits nicely over my head.  It is not to tight around my neck when I place it over my nose.  I can breathe well when I wear it.  I wear this gator when I walk outside.  I do not wear this when I shop for groceries, only for outside activity."
4.0,"I really like the jacket, especially the length and the hood.  It's soft and comfortable.  I haven't had the opportunity to try it in rain yet.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is I had to return and re-order because the jacket runs small."
4.0,Great quality but there is no tip to the tail! It was flattened... I compared it to another tail
4.0,"THE EAR PIECE WAS ADJUSTABLE, BUT NOT ELASTIC."
4.0,"Husband loves these for his uniform. Last 9 months to a year before the retention knob tears the rubber. Better than shirt stays, easier to put on. Keeps pants and a large duty belt up while keeping shirt tight and in place. Does not pull leg hairs like the shirt stays."
4.0,"The lenses seem really cheap.  I got this as kind of a joke gift for my Fiance', but it turns out he actually loves them.  One of the screws was loose and also the lenses were crooked when it arrived, but I kind of expected low quality.<br /><br />I was happy about the case and microfiber, even though he will never use the case!"
4.0,"Great material, super comfortable. Fit great."
4.0,Love the material. Just a little tight around my belly.
4.0,nice fit and well made glasses
4.0,Runs small. Decent terrycloth basic robe.
4.0,"I like the feel of this hijab. Akthough the hijab is not as long in the front as the in the back, I can still wear this hijab and have good coverage. For full-chested sisters , a longer length in the front would be ideal. I prefer to wear Al amira, but with longer front coverage. I really would like to have a white one. A real deal would be for me to gift myself about five more!!! This type of Jersey is easy to wash and dry. It does not snag either. It is my go-to when I wear traditional business suits with lapels. I can also war this hijab inside my blouse for a safe and professional appearance. In or out is great. Smooth and soft to the touch."
4.0,"I love the shirt. It fits great and material is very soft. I've had it for a few months now and have noticed that the material is breaking down in the front. Almost like when you pull velcro off of something. I am not sure what caused it . . could be just normal wear, and for the price, it's really not a big deal."
4.0,"I live in the mid-west where winters are brutal and my husband comes inside with freezing hands after scooping out our driveway so I'm excited for him to have these gloves! I was a bit disappointed when they arrived to find that they have a big, clunky battery box in the wrist that takes 3 AA batteries each, so it takes 6 AA batteries to power both of these gloves. I would like them a lot better if they had a built in rechargeable battery pack so I don't go blowing through so many single use batteries. The gloves didn't arrive with instructions, but they appear to have 3 different heat settings. The high heat setting gets nice and warm especially in the palms of your hands, but not so much in the fingers. I love that these are touch screen compatible! Most warm winter gloves I've found in the past haven't been, so that was a nice perk."
4.0,Warning: it sheds glitter!<br />Not for big chested ladies as I was spilling out and the dress is a little long if you’re short like me
4.0,"We were happy with the masks, so was our 3 yr old son. He wore it today without issues while getting his haircut; impressed.<br /><br />Runs a little big, but not an problem for our little big guy. The looser fit might be why he likes it."
4.0,Strings are too long
4.0,Holds all my long thick hair up!
4.0,"It is a nice looking shoe, seems comfortable, I rated it a 4 because I didn’t read anywhere in the description provided that it fastens with Velcro and I am not fond of Velcro in shoes where pressure is applied in the fit. It just never feels snug and fitted enough. The description needs addressing."
4.0,Very nice mock turtleneck especially for the price.
4.0,Nice shoes good for soccer on artificial turf.
4.0,"Band at the top needs to be wider, felt like it cut into the stomach"
4.0,Pretty but the dress is like two sizes to small. I ordered a large and I need an xxl.
4.0,I loved the dress it’s just what you would hope for it to be.
4.0,Bought this watch for my cousin. Really beautiful watch.
4.0,Muy bonita y buena calidad pero el tono de rojo no fue el esperado
4.0,It's a cute piece. Lots of fun to be had with it.
4.0,"nice sewater, fast ship!"
4.0,"This top fits as expected.  The only issue I have and it is my fault that I bought it, is the material.  That kind of material makes me sweat.  I thought that by having no sleeves that would make the top ok to wear.  I haven't worn it outside yet and when I do, I will add to this review."
4.0,It is very beautiful but I think the zip has some problem!
4.0,"This is great with leggings, just what I was hoping for when I ordered it. I'm 5'5&#34; and it comes about mid thigh in the front and a little past my hips on the side. It's also really soft. Would buy again."
4.0,"Didn't work for me.  First off this arrived with a small hole in the fabric on the back.  But the return was smooth and accommodating for me.  Even without the hole, this didn't work for me.  I love bright yellow but the fabric wasn't very forgiving to every little lump and bump.  It very well could have worked in a different color but everything showed through the yellow on my plus size figure.  I may try the other colors later.  It was stretchy and the waist was stretchy and comfortable as well.  I got the xxl.  For reference, I'm 4'9, 195 lbs.  A 42 bust, 38 waist, and 50 hips.  This did fit although I'd need to hem the length as expected but I may try a darker color later."
4.0,"Easy to insert, but difficult to get back into original shape. Quality metal, doesn’t tarnish, or irritate my sensitive ears."
4.0,"3.25 stars average (3.5 for value, 3 for support). i ordered following the size chart but if you have a larger chest (i'm 36ddd) i recommend going down a size (maybe even 2 sizes) for more support because the bras are 92% nylon, 8% elastane so they stretch out from wear pretty easily. also the fabric content & washing instructions are printed in black on the inside of the bottom band & with the lighter colored bras it shows through to the outside so if you wear a light color top (& it's a lightweight/sheer one), you can see the black text showing through. the black spots & marks in pics are dye transfer from the black text that occurred during the wash (hand washed in sink, warm water & gentle detergent). comes w removable cups but the outline of the cups is visible no matter what (not just w sheer top) because the are a molded foam. i just don't use them for that reason. while the fabric strip behind the zipper is nice to prevent discomfort from zipper against skin, the triangular fabric covers at the top and bottom of the zipper are bulky & lumpy - visible under any top - so i will be cutting them off & hopefully that will resolve the issue. for the price, for a 3 pack, i honestly wasn't expecting much which is why even given all the above, i said they're a good value."
4.0,Will have to resew the garter after 2 or 3 washes
4.0,Comfortable but thinner and shorter than expected. I’m 5’3 and I expected it to go at least to the top of a pair of shoes or sneakers but it just hits my ankles. The material is also very thin so you need to make sure you wear something underneath or you can see right through it.
4.0,"This is a quality shirt with an accurate fit (as a large at least). The fabric is heavy enough to hang well, but not so thick to be hot. I'm not normally a short-sleeve shirt guy, but this is a nice shirt. It's fairly wrinkle-free (not super starched smooth, but not wrinkled) out of the drier and looks nice tucked in.  The inside of the color has a strange blue band that I find a bit odd, but overall it's a nice shirt."
4.0,Not as nice as I expected. Still pretty
4.0,"I would give this necklace a 5 star except for the clasp, it is really hard to open so trying to put it on is a little tough, I'm hoping that over time that it might loosen it up a little and be easier to put on by myself, I have to have my husband help me with it now.  The color is really nice and the gold tone really accents the other color. I thought it was going to be big and bulky but the size is good.  It really goes will with a lot of different pieces of clothing since the colors are pretty neutral."
4.0,Its a cute top. Just runs a little to big all over
4.0,Perfect gift for my mom!
4.0,The sizing is a bit off but I expected that so I ordered larger than usual.  I'd rather it be baggy than too tight. Cute shirt.
4.0,This material is a cross between athletic material and the extra soft boyfriend t-shirt material.  It isn't very forgiving and will show any line you have.  It is however the most comfortable sleep shirt / lounge around and veg shirt I have ever found in my life.  The color is a beautiful purple and again I will lovingly hangout in this for hours and snuggle to my hearts content.
4.0,it was gr8 until I bought a case it would not work with.
4.0,Arrived on time.  Fits and feels great.
4.0,"Nice boot, but not what I was looking for."
4.0,I like this item but I have no way of knowing if it is actually doing what it is designed to do.  It is soft and works well for my passport and credit cards.  Fits easily in my pocket.
4.0,too small for me but I gave it to my friend it fit her perfectly.
4.0,My daughter loved it.  Good quality for the price.  She wears it all the time.  Perfect size for her my pre-teen.  I ordered it with the 18&#34; chain.
4.0,"Palmtree is very pretty, brilliant color, & shine. The 18"" chains not as nice. I ordered a nicer, 20"" box chain 14k over silver. It's still worth the value."
4.0,(At 5’10” 170lbs) I ordered a medium & it was too small in the waist- but the right length in the legs. I then ordered a large where it fit on the waist perfect but it was a little long in the legs. Either way- it’s Ralph Lauren so it’s great material & I’d get it again! :-)
4.0,"I like the way it looks, not too thick."
4.0,Fit as expected and i love it.
4.0,"I was super excited for these.  One part of the description said Mens size another Women sizes. So I wasn't quite sure which gender I was ordering. I went with small. 5'4"" 115 lbs. I have big hips and the small was a little to snug. I should have ordered medium. Theses are Women sizes.  Awesome heat in the right spots! Battery is a little bulky  but you get used too it. I would have given 5 stars if the description had said deff Womens and no mens  sizes. Its a lot of money too spend on a pair of pants. If u work outside or in the cold, I recommend"
4.0,"Product is very pretty, and definitely has a lot of color to it. I’m yet to wear it. Over all the item itself is great but packaging that product came in could’ve been better and the shipping time was miserable I totally forgot I ordered it until it showed up at my house."
4.0,Out of all the bands only one did not fit.
4.0,Great Value. Although the colors didn't arrive as shown (mirrored instead of amber) they still are good quality.
4.0,i bought this to go under a rockabilly style dress but it hubg out of the bottom too much. Otherwise it was a decent piece of clothing.
4.0,Not see through and very comfortable
4.0,"They were a little shorter than pictured in the photo but I'm not sure if it has to do with body size. I'm 5'6 165.  They fall somewhere between the top of my thigh and my knee.  Aside from that, I was not disappointed. I have the yoga style pants in a few different colors and I'm very happy with them and the price."
4.0,Great for the price! Mom loves it.
4.0,The dress fit my wife great! The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because the grey looks much more like white.
4.0,This was a gift. The recipient was very enthusiastic about how easy it was to read.
4.0,"Great product, but yes a little on the thin side material wise, but very comfortable to wear. It is a little over size, but I like that it covers my butt. Color is just like picture (dusty pink)."
4.0,This is a pretty skirt.  It is a-line and come right below my knee. It will look cute with boots in the fall and winter.  I didn't really like the scalloped top of the skirt around my waist but I can cover it with a sweater.
4.0,"I ordered this after reading the reviews and I’m usually a medium and ordered a medium. I typically wear medium tops and 6-8 size bottoms. I’m 5’5”, 34D/32DDD, and weigh 150 pounds. Hourglass. The medium was a nice size in all the areas, hugged my top portion and hips nicely, and still gave my stomach some wiggle room. It hit somewhere around mid-thigh making it a decent length. I wish the fabric was better but for $20 this dress is a steal. Probably going to buy it in more colors! 4 stars because of fabric quality, but again, it’s a $20 dress."
4.0,Too tight on my chest and I am only a 36c
4.0,my daughter love them very much good quality
4.0,Nice glasses for the price. They do the job they are meant to while being sharp looking at the same time.
4.0,Nice shirt. Ended up giving it to my nephew cause of my man boobs.
4.0,Glass came in on time and in a case very well protected.  The lens are polarized and provides great eye protection.  The white part of the glasses that goes over my ear has already began to fade out.  Other then that they are holding up well.
4.0,"El empaque es burdo, y las gafas también. Baratas y malas."
4.0,"The armholes are a bit large, and my bra shows. But it fits well over the 6 month baby bump! I just layer a scarf or kimono over it to hide the underarm"
4.0,Not as wide as I thought but made of glass-like material they feel real and not fake at all! It makes me look like a 1960s FBI agent.
4.0,"Silky like material, rich colors. Beautiful, but the label said DRY CLEAN ONLY.<br />Cool and comfortable, the 2 year old loves it.<br />However; if I had known it dry cleaned instead of washing, I probably would NOT have<br />bought it.<br />Good craftsmanship in sewing, good material, great fit. Just dry cleans.<br />What a let down."
4.0,I bought one and turned right around and bought a second.  The first was for the beach in a pattern and the second was just a touch more formal in black.  I love clothes that are adjustable and customizable and I'm all about lightweight packing that doesn't take up much.  This is all that and a bag of chips.
4.0,"Just what I wanted - comfy house &#34;booties&#34; that are warm, but do not make my feet sweat.  These are holding up well and I have washed them a few times too!"
4.0,"I own 5 of these dresses from iconic luxe - 2 with 3/4 sleeves and 3 with short sleeves.  The dresses are comfortable, forgiving in fit, wrinkle resistant, and easy to care for.  The fabric is a nice weight and doesn’t feel cheap.  Also, a plus factor for me is that they are made in the U.S.  However, all the positive factors, other than where they are made, are only true of the floral dresses.  For some reason, the solid color dresses are made from a different type fabric which is thinner and clings unattractively.  The 2 solid color dresses I bought in the past were returned.  I really would prefer some solid colors out of the same fabric as the floral ones.  I’m not a huge fan of floral, but I am a fan of the dress."
4.0,Logistics soon
4.0,I really love the way it feels it's beautiful can't wait to see it on my little girl who has not arrived yet
4.0,"The cut and shape are exactly what you see in the advertising picture which I'm very pleased about!  I love semi-fitted clothes because they look feminine to me without being too sexy, so this top is appropriate for a work setting as well.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like about it is the sizing runs pretty small.  I ordered a large because I read the measurement chart and that's what it indicated.  I'm not a large by any reasonable measure, but whatever, it's their game.  However, the lower arms from the wrist to just below the elbow is so tight it feels like an ace bandage.  And the bottom area that fits around the hips feels like a compression garment.  Maybe if I would have gotten an XL it wouldn't feel so tight, but that being said, it's not a deal breaker.  Overall I'm very happy with top and will wear it on a regular basis.<br /><br />I received this top at a discount in exchange for an honest review which I have done.  I have included pictures to help you see how it fits so that you can gauge what size you should order.  I wear a 36&#34; band bra and wear a size 6 jean, so hopefully that helps you decide which size you need to order."
4.0,very cute keychain  for Van lovers
4.0,"This is such a pretty bracelet, but I have extremely small wrists and the chain that you use to adjust the bracelet was entirely too long after the adjustment to be attractive (my opinion). I'm returning the bracelet."
4.0,Very  Sheer  but  soft  and  comfortable
4.0,"I used these to see if I wanted to get a septum piercing. They looked exactly like a real piercing. However, after about 3 hours it starts to hurt the inside of my nose because of the way it pinches together. Its good for the price though."
4.0,"Am generally a 4 or a 6 and the small skims my 37&#34; hips. Am 5'2&#34; and had been worried that the dress would be rather long for me. Fortunately, it's not and hangs a few inches past me knees, about 2 inches lower than the photo. However the arm holes are rather large so if that's an issue, then this might be the dress for you. The dress is lined with some sort of cotton-cheese cloth type of material. Overall, bought it as liked the design and dress is as what it appears in the photos. Took 1 star off as it came with slight powder stain round the collar. Thankfully, that came off by using my favourite dish washing liquid. Got the dress at a heavily discounted price and can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"Beautiful high quality dress, my daughter wore for prom. The size we got was a bit too big and probably could have gone a size down, but we got it hemmed."
4.0,Made a 1950's 70th birthday party for mom and purchased this dress for that event! I changed the purple belt it came with to a white belt and it just made the dress pop! Perfect for the occasion! Dress material is thick and not cheap! I had ordered an extra large it was a lil big on her but the belt helped! FYI I did get a petticoat to fluff up the dress a bit!
4.0,"Fit well, not exactly perfect for running and the padding shifts when taking off/putting on. Ended up just taking it out since I didn't really see the point. But for the price, I can't complain."
4.0,THEY ARE GREAT AND YOU HAVE POCKETS TO CARY PHONE AND id HOWEVER THE LEG ARE LTTLE TIGHT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM SEAM DOESN'T RUN STRAIGHT.
4.0,"I ordered this for my grandson who is turning 6.  I bought a size 6/7 and while the shoulders fit fine, the body of the shirt is wide and shirt tail is rather long.  Other than that, it is a very nice shirt and my grandson loves it!"
4.0,"Tried it on, but haven't worn it or laundered yet.  Try-on was as expected."
4.0,LOVE  the looks of them
4.0,I have gotten tons of compliments on this bag.  Well made and looks exactly as pictured.  I wish the strap was longer.  Wear as a crossbody and hits too high in an awkward spot.
4.0,Not exactly like picture but still pretty
4.0,"I use these as workout gear and as a base layer when working outside. They seem well made and are very comfortable. I went by the size chart and it put me in the category of XXL. I'm not a large guy and I thought this was probably wrong and I really could have gotten them as L not XXL. I would definitely buy them again, just down in size"
4.0,As described. Nicely packaged. Fits well
4.0,I have thin legs and my granddaughter that I shared some of these over the knee sox with has model thin legs.  If these were purchased for someone with thicker legs they would not work due to the weave and the material of the sock.  They are a bit hard to get used to over the knee and eventually roll down - at least mine did.
4.0,Love this item but one of charms design came off within days. Band is really cute!
4.0,Very cute dress I wish it were a little more flared around the middle it's so comfy and silky though! Also stretchy
4.0,It was too small for my wrist.
4.0,"Extremely baggy for this style of shirt, and much longer on me than pictured. Also very loose in the neck and shoulders. For reference, I am 5'3 and 115 lbs with small shoulders. The shirt looked great in the package, it's just going to be way too big if you are petite. I got the small so can't size down, since there is no xs available."
4.0,"I only don't like tha that it has to be hand-washed.  I don't know why.  It appears to be color-fast, so why the cautionary statement?<br />I did dry it in the dryer and that was fine."
4.0,"Comfy & cute, this is the 2nd color shirt I’ve bought cause I like it so well. I will say one of the holes on the top by the chest is a little bigger then the picture but the others are fine. I’m 205lbs and 5,2 and I got a XL and it’s the perfect amount of loose!"
4.0,Be informed these are very dark. Good if you have to work out on the flight line
4.0,Not quite as comfy as I expected.  Also sizing ran big and that contributes to less comfort.  They look nice enough.
4.0,not sure if they're waterproof but they are comfortable
4.0,I received this compression sleeve quicker then expected.  I have tendonitis and when I type my arm sometimes hurts.  I've seen the Copper brand advertised so I thought I'd try this for size.  I purchased a large and it fit just fine.  It was very comfortable on my arm and did not cut into my upper arm flesh.  I was afraid my arm would feel too constricted and maybe get too hot but it remained cool and comfortable. I can recommend this sleeve because my arm usually begins to feel sore within 10 minutes of typing but with the sleeve the pain felt 60% better.  Any amount of relief is good!
4.0,"My wife likes these, they are easy to use and well designed, except there is no way to regulate the heat setting or turn the gloves off from the glove level, so you have to unplug the USB. Not a big problem, but would have been nice. We liked them so much we bought a bunch of these and the mouse warmers for our annual get together with my family (bought one for each family group, so that was 11 sets.). Price is great at &#60; 5$ so I definitely recommend them."
4.0,"Cute, comfortable, casual dress. Does run a little small so I would go up a size."
4.0,I have chronic dry eye and am on the computer a lot.  Have noticed it does help with eye strain.<br />Only thing to note is they can be a little hard to attach to top of existing glasses.
4.0,I bought this because of the high reviews. The seems are. Little itchy and it’s a little short. I’m 6ft tall and bought my normal size a 20w and it’s not made for someone as tall as me. It is flattering and looks cute. Held up pretty well in a chlorinated pool so far.
4.0,Was a nice quality shirt for the money.  Looks cute with jeans.
4.0,The shoes fit great.  I bought them a half size smaller than I usually wear.  They are comfortable.
4.0,Protect my fingers while golfing. Just what I needed.
4.0,"Like the material, fit was true to size. Although I could have went down a size for more tight feel."
4.0,Pretty good quality suit. Definitely worth the price. The torso is short though and it's definitely a little cheeky.
4.0,Great support... runs a little small./
4.0,i love the color and glitter
4.0,"Bra was very comfortable but the band was a bit too big for me, so there wasn't much bounce support. Cup size was good though. Customer service was excellent though when I did a return and I have another bra from them that fits fine so I'm willing to try them again."
4.0,"Nice band, but for the money expected a little bit tougher leather. Already shows creases where the clasp is on the band and I have only worn it like three times. Nice contrasting stitching and hardware, looks great on my military style automatic. Took forever to arrive. Very nice band, but again, for the money ($45), I expected a lot. Does fit my large (8 inch) wrist without the fold-over. Leather is much softer than original, factory Orient band."
4.0,Fits my son perfectly. Kept the hair off of him. Pretty tough material. Like the adjustable collar.
4.0,Kept me warm through cold winter vacations in NYC and Boston.  It's held up well and it's very cute :)
4.0,"This is a lightweight dress and a very pretty green color.  The advertisement photos are closer to the true color then my phone colors which makes it look somewhat olive/military green.  I am 5'9"" 180lbs 36/38B I have this in the XL and it fits me very well.  The material is not very forgiving and will show any flaws and panty lines.  I highly recommend wearing a shaper to smooth everything out. I like the length and cut."
4.0,Product fits great.  Somewhat loose.  All in all great
4.0,"I like the design of these shorts.  my first lafroi shorts purchase was a viking print XL.  i got the XL due to the reviews mentioning that these shorts run small, but they are too big for me.  i wear a size 34.  i have since purchased 3 additional shorts in size L and they seem to fit better.  i hope this helps."
4.0,Very pretty. Can be worn with a black tie dress or jeans and a sweater.
4.0,I love the saying on it but it's a little uncomfortable where the ring twists. That's the only complaint I have.
4.0,"I was a tad thrown off by the idea of plus sized earrings- not sure what that even means in the jewelry world, but either way, they are quite pretty. The reason I took off one star is due to the fact that the earrings droop down slightly while wearing them, I'm assuming due to the large size, something I can't seem to fix (and I am a plus sized girl). I likely won't buy from here again due to this. They are lovely to look at, though."
4.0,"Bought these for a Velma costume this year. The orange pair are very light orange, almost a gold color and the color was a little uneven, but they stayed up without tugging and fit comfortably inside a pair of ballet flats. If I were just rating them as socks I'd say they're a good value."
4.0,My Mum has a very small childlike face and these were perfect..
4.0,Great for the price but needed just a little support on the top.
4.0,sexy and very surprised with the comfort zone and how easy it was to walk in them with such a unique style of the heel -very sturdy... that is IF you are used to wearing heels this high. Only issue is: a bit too many straps at the top of the ankle...they are difficult to buckle if you have long nails...other than that...I'm pretty happy with them.
4.0,"Soft, but string keeps coming out"
4.0,Cute bracelet!! Not the greatest quality but adorable
4.0,The belt is just what I wanted<br />It is pretty I got the black and it is perfect
4.0,We'll see
4.0,Liked product it was just want I wanted
4.0,This shirt/sweater is really comfy and cute.  The fabric is not thick but not thin. Nice weight and quality.  Love the ruffle detail at the sleeves and waist.
4.0,"These are good quality material and very cute. I ordered a medium thinking they'd be a little small, but they are baggy around the needs when my legs are bent. I recommend going a size or two down."
4.0,"Quality is about what you would expect for the price. If you like a snug fit, the sizing seems right, but go up in size if you prefer loose fit."
4.0,Really like this top. It does run small but good quality.
4.0,The colors are really nice. It's a bit bigger than I expected and I wish the wristlet was attached to the zipper.
4.0,These are nice.  A little thinner than what I expected but still nice material & sewn well.
4.0,"My little guy is potty trained but has the occasional night time accident. We wanted to be done with pull ups so we gave these a try. For my son, his accidents are typically very small so this does the trick absorbing. And most mornings he wakes up dry so we just set the undies aside for the next night. He did have a larger accident one night and it leaked out and onto the bed, making his pajamas wet as well. So if you’re still dealing with bigger accidents on a regular basis, these might not be the best. But for small accidents or just as a little extra “just in case” barrier, they’re great."
4.0,Great costume jewelry! Wore it to a wedding! Unfortunately I think I should have ordered one size smaller.
4.0,"I chose this Halloween shirt for myself because it's a movie T-shirt and can be worn all year, not just during Halloween season. The pumpkin logo is the precise image for the 1978 movie, Halloween, and it's nicely printed.  I like that it shows ""Haddonfield, 1978"" on it as well.<br /><br />The shirt didn't fit me terribly well, but it was perfect for my husband, who thinks it's terrific and has been wearing it regularly. It looks great on him and it's standing up easily to washing and drying.  It's lightweight and comfortable. He loves it."
4.0,Some of them are a little big but I love every single one
4.0,"Fit perfectly, however now they sag.  Husband loves the comfort and warmth in the winter."
4.0,"Giving it 4.5 because unsure of the material (hope it will keep my body cool, I have hot flashes). I will find out this weekend (going to San Felipe for 3 days).<br />I wish it would be a little longer but I can wear shorts when walking around the market & for sure a bathe suit cover up."
4.0,Lo estamos probando
4.0,I embellish these cases with fused glass.  I had two special orders and re-ordered the cases.  They were less rounded than the first one I got.  Still a nice case but varied a little bit.
4.0,"I love them, they are very bright when they glow and are easier to find in the dark. I'll be happy to buy more stuff from you."
4.0,Its very nice on. little long for me and I am 5 ft 6in tall.
4.0,Lasted the season and were easy to get a good fit with the pump.
4.0,"It's a very good quality band, I'm very satisfied with it."
4.0,"Did what I wanted to do, a bit bigger then I thought but fine."
4.0,Worked great for what I needed it for. My dad had a bike and I was meeting him in Vegas for bike week and needed a helmet to ride with his group of friends.<br /><br />I honestly bought the cheapest one on amazon prime and was not disappointed. I have a relatively small head and the medium was the only size they had for prime. It was too large when we were on the windy freeway but after pulling over and wearing a bandana underneath it fit perfectly.
4.0,This is such a lovely top. I got a medium size and it fit me quite well. Fabric is smooth and quality was better than I expected. Comfy and color is exactly as the picture they show. I recommend it.
4.0,"This bag would have been perfect if it was anywhere near the size shown in the picture. I know, I should have checked the specs, but I ordered based on a few reviews and the picture. My fault. I'm keeping it because its my fault and the bag, despite its size, is decently constructed. The canvas is good quality and the stitching is solid and even."
4.0,bottoms r like a little weird/ the way they flap/elastic is on top but overall love!!!
4.0,cute glazed lady cat pendant necklace.  Looks exactly like the pic. high gloss black with black chain.  About 2 inches high
4.0,These are light and she likes them. Not sure about durability so we will see. I bought lock laces to put in them so we didn’t have to mess around with tying and untying them. She has a more narrow foot and these seem to work for her with the lock laces.
4.0,"I loved everything about this dress except the length.  I ordered the peach and the color was very pretty.  The fit is true to size.  The length was just  little short for me, mostly due to my age.  I am 5'9"" 155 pounds with an average build and the size large fit perfect.  My legs are long and I just felt the dress was a little short for a 52 year old grandma.  If I was 10 or 20 years younger I would have kept it.  The quality seemed good.  I would definitely recommend this dress."
4.0,"Arrived on time and in good condition. Cloth was soft after washing. Very little dye run off, but wash with similar colored clothing.<br /><br />My use of these are practical. Wiping my brow, blowing my nose."
4.0,5’6” 130 lbs 34 B bought Small.  Top fit perfectly but the bottoms are super high waist and uncomfortable
4.0,"Beautifull dress, color, size, all perfect"
4.0,"Love this dress. I am 5’4. 140lbs. 34b. I bought a small. The length of the dress is perfect, is not too loose or too tight. Fits my chest size and the cut of the top of dress is flattering. I would recommend it. I also love the pockets. I have 4 stars only because of the color. It’s a little off in parts of the dress."
4.0,Stylish and good quality for the price.
4.0,"This dress is darling but ran a bit small and so it didn't fit the daughter I bought it for.  It DID fit her sister but the problem that caused is not the maker's, it is my own!"
4.0,Good spacious wallet definitely not for smaller purses!! Overall I would buy again!
4.0,I wear a 2x in tops and got this in the xxl. It fits but it's not roomy so I will have to be careful when laundering it. Very nice cover up for the price!
4.0,Super cute!! We absolutely love it!
4.0,"My daughter wanted a 3 way bff necklace.  We bought this,  it's been months, and her necklace still isn't broken.  She wears ita few times month."
4.0,"Gifts, unique. Well received."
4.0,"I like the shirt which covers hip area well. It's a little drapy under arms.  I usually wear size 8-10.  Haven't washed it yet, so don't know if that will make a difference."
4.0,It fit perfectly but was disappointed that one of the straps ripped had to sew it back
4.0,A little big on me but they're perfect
4.0,These worked very well for my grandson who is sensative to noises. The only drawback is that the size is not adjustable.
4.0,Still getting used to this style panties.  Not used to the like wearing nothing feeling.  Wish there were a few more colors.
4.0,"Bought this as a gift along with the earrings, so I can't speak to their &#34;wearability.&#34;  However, I did remove them from the packaging to see what they looked like up close. The chain is more like a rope than a chain. I didn't look at the clasp due to how it was packaged, so I can't speak to that either.  The tree was smaller than I anticipated (which is just fine), but the detail is AMAZING!  They look more expensive than they actually were, which is also nice.  I'll update if I find out from the recipient about the wearability of the item."
4.0,"Great hat, comfortable and lets the hair breathe. The only thing that sucks is that the buckle on the back doesn't hold the strap well and it slips often. Other than that I love the hat."
4.0,"Better than I expected . Zipper  in the middle and 2  magnetic closure . Nice size but handles could be longer,"
4.0,Very odd material but the dress is nice and flattering.
4.0,"Decent quality, just 2 sizes too small"
4.0,Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend who loves The Dead. He likes then a lot but doesn't wear them that often because they are a little stiff.
4.0,It's cute. Fits loose but I guess its not a big deal.
4.0,This dress is beautiful. It was too small. I returned it for a larger size
4.0,"It fits as expected.  Love the stripes, which it came in red/white stripe!  I have gotten compliments on it. It is stretchy and thin, so good to keep the chill off in airconditioning, but not for warmth in cool or cold weather."
4.0,"This dress was adorable, but the chest was way too big. This is really odd because I have a big chest and this is a problem I literally never have. I so wanted to love this dress, but I had to return it."
4.0,"I really like it.  I'm not 100% sure it's new, as the ad says.  It smells like a thrift shop and has a bit of a worn-looking edge on one side. But otherwise it's nice, the right size for a winter wrap, and Is very soft."
4.0,Super cute and affordable<br />Made one as a Father’s Day gift<br />However looks like it may already start to peel
4.0,"I love these earrings although I think they're a silvery blue, much lighter than the picture shows.  They go well with lilac blue T-Shirts.  I gave them 4 stars as I thought I was ordering black cluster earrings!"
4.0,"The material was not what I expected, but it fits nicely."
4.0,Very cute but better suited to someone way hipper and cooler than me so I gave them to my teen niece.
4.0,"I bought a pair of these at Walmart and loved them, but the frame break in the first week. I found them on Amazon and bought them again, only to have the same thing happen. Too bad, because they are comfortable and the lenses are nice and clear."
4.0,Real nice and detailed..
4.0,very comfortable! Fit well - thought I am 6' tall so I think they might be a bit shorter judging from the length on me.  This really wouldn't be an issue except they ride up while riding and catch me right behind the knee and cut off circulation.  I have had to cut a split the bottom of the pant to allow extra &#34;breathing room&#34; for the top of my calf/back of my knee.
4.0,It cuts wind but not all of it like advertised
4.0,"This watch was a wonderful gift, it also came with tools that made it easy to add or take off the links. The only complaint I noticed initially is the blue face isn't as vibrant blue as it looks in the picture, without any light or without directly looking into the face of the watch it more or less looks like a deep blue/almost black."
4.0,"I bought this sweater in 2 colors, the white one was a little more stretchy than the other one. Love it and it feels and looks good."
4.0,"True to size, long enough to go over leggings."
4.0,I would recommend. It for nice and washed well
4.0,to small but granddaughter loves it and fits her nicely
4.0,"It looks great! The only reason that I didn't put 5 stars is because the zippers are stiff... Other than that, it's great and sophisticated."
4.0,"Love the top, but the bottom is a little small and coverage is not desirable."
4.0,"I'm a sucker for really good looking genuine leather wristbands, especially if it's brown/coffee in color. It fits great on my wrist. It's almost perfect if not for the fact that if snagged upon something they easily fall of the wrist. I would've preferred a more secure clap instead of the button one. Worn this two or three times and it has snapped away from my wrist each time."
4.0,Great jacket and super comfortable
4.0,NICE AND STYLISH
4.0,Cute and comfy. Just what I was hoping for! Pockets would have made it 5-stars.
4.0,It is good except the eyeholes are misplaced.  They are very widely spaced so you can't see out of them.
4.0,"Cute shirt, be careful because it does shrink when you wash it so order a size up!"
4.0,Like the print and the length.
4.0,Adorable dress that did not work for me at 5'7&#34;.  The slip underneath was incredibly short and didn't cover what needed to covered. Sizing is otherwise correct but this dress is really only for those who are 5'2&#34; or under!
4.0,"These pants are super comfortable, but the pockets in them are very shallow. I would not trust placing my smart phone in them. The lower pockets on the legs are deeper, but a phone drags the pants down."
4.0,"a little short, but nice"
4.0,Small & tight around thighs. Not for taller peole
4.0,"Nice socks; very warm. But if you want two pair, be sure to pick the appropriate color choice. I assumed I was getting two pair, per the item title, but only got one."
4.0,"The small size fit me very well and hits me just barely above the ankles. I am 117 (not curvy) and 5'8&#34;. There is not much give in the elastic waistband. The paneling is more like athletic wear than pleather. Overall, I am pleased with the product."
4.0,"I tried these but unfortunately I couldn't see very well with them due to my eyesight, not the glasses.  Seems I need prescription strength sunglasses. They were ok for the money - lightweight and as pictured.  I returned them and the seller was responsive - credit issued quickly.  Much appreciated.  Good company to buy from."
4.0,Somewhat large but manageable
4.0,"I really like this product.  It was a great gift on Christmas.  I liked it more than my daughter did.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because the plastic piece is really flimsy and throws off the overall &#34;goodness&#34; of the product.  It is also really loud.  It reminds me of the sound of money counting machines you see in movies.  Overall, I still like the product.  If you make those features better then you will have a phenomenal product."
4.0,Add more adjustment area.  The Release Mechanism is so small I couldn't get it off of me.
4.0,Good material and the color and graphics are great. The only issue is it is way too long.
4.0,I have a problem wearing there. The metal irritates my war. I've gotten other products from this company without this issue. Love the design
4.0,"This is the bar I put in my industrial, 6 months after I got it pierced.  I NEVER take it out, I go to school, work, sleep, shower, workout and swim in my barbell.  I get tons of compliments on the arrow because it's so unique.  I had it in for about 3 months when the bottom began to turn colors, I have now had it in for about 4.5 months and the bottom part of the arrow is now fully discolored :( ...The rest is still the original color and I call tell the actually bar and the pointed tip that you screw on and off is actually piercing quality steel.  I believe the bottom part was probably just metal-coated.  Anyway, very happy with it overall, but a little upset there is one small part that is not made like the rest (how much harder is it to make that part out of the same material?!) Still worth it for the price."
4.0,Beautiful shoes! Wore them for a wedding and got a lot of compliments. Hard to wear more than 5 hours though :/
4.0,"Thanks for the owl items, they are Christmas gifts and I am sure they will be well received!"
4.0,"Love it, love the look, but the fabric is so rough inside that is just not that comfortable. Looks great though. I'm 5'10 189 and the medium was perfect for me, but it's snug. Fabric doesn't have much give either."
4.0,"Good buy, the box was nice too. My 12 year old really liked it."
4.0,Had to wear all white to an occasion that came up fast( funeral)....Amazon delivery did well ( this time)
4.0,It's a flattering top. I'm using is as a nursing top and it works very well for that purpose.
4.0,It fits but I should have gotten a medium because the straps are very loose.
4.0,"I have been looking for a new pair of polarized sunglasses on and off for the last 3 years.  I have light sensitive light colored eyes where even cloudy overcast days can be painfully bright.  But, I also have a very broad face and 'a big ol' melon' of a head, making it difficult to find polarized sunglasses that fit and looked good.  I'd nearly given up on finding a pair that would fit me without giving me a headache when I came across these Corciova shades.  They fit like a dream, provided excellent protection from the painful glare of the sun, and the 'oversized' styling actually makes my face look smaller!"
4.0,"Size chart must be a bit off.  Shirt is big, wearable but bigger than a junior large. It fits me more like a woman's large. The color is rich and the fabric is comfy soft. I will order more colors just a size down"
4.0,Cute and comfortable open back tank!
4.0,"very nice thick & soft material<br />Well made<br />i am a 34 D , 5  4  135 lbs and a large is 2 sizes too small<br />also note it is a mini<br />I will pass it on to 17 yrs old"
4.0,"Cap is very comfortable, even with long hair.  Love the goggle storage case. But, the lenses scratch easily. The goggles fog up no matter how tight the straps are adjusted. Caution when removing goggles because it creates a suction on the eye socket."
4.0,Wasn't the easiest to assemble.
4.0,Super cute and very comfy! I bought it to have cute pajamas on vacation. However I bought this less than a month ago and have only worn it a handful of times and unfortunately there are already strings coming out of the top. For example - it looks like it has been washed and got caught on something rough even though I haven’t even washed it yet... I would recommend buying for an occasion but not for everyday wearing
4.0,Comfortable as shorts to lounge around in the home at night or early mornings before getting ready for the day
4.0,Good quality and flattery to shape
4.0,Material light and fits nicely.
4.0,It as a very nice bracelet. It was shorter than i expected but it was very pretty and the box was beautiful.
4.0,I knew this would be a gamble for a quick cosplay outfit. The skirt is see through and even with it stretched all the way out it was too small and was riding up but luckily I have mom who can sew and can let it out for me . Overall it could be worse.
4.0,"I wore these almost everyday during the summer.  They were extremely comfortable and looked great.  I got compliments all the time.  However, part of the treads on the sole started to come loose, the strap started to fray and one of the shoes got a hole in the toe area (it's mesh).  I think I'll try another style this year."
4.0,"My husband was looking for all cotton so I searched on Amazon, recognized the name Joseph Abboud and ordered them.  They arrived on time, individually wrapped, white cotton, put them in the washer on permanent press, dried on medium.  They dried nicely.  This is a good product, great price. dud not shrink.  Great!<br />."
4.0,Love the band just once in awhile it loosens and slips
4.0,"These are very comfortable, wick moisture well, and are nice for the price but they are not squat proof."
4.0,True to size. Very comfy. Only issue I have is the waist straps twist all day and I wasn't expecting that.
4.0,"I purchased this for a friend. She loves the style of the smocking and lush emerald green color. The fabric is more lightweight than I expected it to be, but she likes it also, because it will fit more easily into her weekend luggage. We did not realize that the zipper only goes half way down the front of the robe."
4.0,"Personally, the dress is really beautiful, but it just wasn't for me. I have broad shoulders, so it made me look really chunky and big."
4.0,Ordered another cap. Can be worn inside or out. Perfect for a quick cover to runout shopping. Very flexible styling.
4.0,"Nice smaller sized bag for the gym. Quality seems not too bad, could be a little thicker, but I don't think that will affect longevity. Wish there was maybe one outer or inner pocket, but definitely not a deal breaker. Have also been using it for short weekend trips, which is nice!<br />Colours match the picture as well!"
4.0,i wanted something quick drying for an overseas trip.  I like the shirts
4.0,Product didn't fit..... Needed 18 g.
4.0,Cant find much friday the 13th items in more variety but this one is good to settle to
4.0,Nice product<br />Great price
4.0,These are super cute game day leggings. My husband loves them on me. The are not very durable and are somewhat sheer. Don’t buy these for the quality - buy them for the cuteness!
4.0,Great glasses for the price. They take off the glare while  still being bright to view thru.. i am ordering more sets.
4.0,Beautiful piece. Couple stones arrived loose inside packaging.  will fix. No biggy .nice piece. Hope more pieces dont come off when wear it.
4.0,"What I needed, work well"
4.0,I'm a bigger girl. So I should have know that &#34;one size fits all&#34; probably didn't include me.. lol but I'll use it for motivation to fit into it because it's super cute and really soft! The color is beautiful and the material feels really high quality! It says for the Beach but I wouldn't be ashamed to put a belt and heels on and wear it out! It's that cute!
4.0,As an ex employee the shirt is great but runs small. Next time I'm getting next size up.
4.0,Bracelet came just like it looks.  It is just a little stiff so I'm hoping that will loosen up a bit with wearing.  Size was good and shipping was in good packaging and on time.  Good quality.
4.0,Me agrado la calidad
4.0,"I ordered according to the size chart and it does fit, my husband really likes it; is good but a little expensive for the quality of the fabric."
4.0,Took off one star for the fish smell! We had to was this two times to get the smell out 🤢<br />BUT very cute 😊
4.0,"I bought this because there are days I can pull off a bikini and days I need the tank over it. I have two complaints though. The bikini portion is adorable. However, you have to pull the top over your head. There is no fastening the back. I'd rather it cost a few more dollars and have a hook in the back. The tank puckers a lot in the back. I don't know if maybe I am too small chested for it, but I will have to have that looked at by a seamstress. Love the bottoms. I am not large but I do have child bearing hips and need a tie sided bikini. Most bikini bottoms do not have quite enough fabric in the front but this one does. The blue is a beautiful shade, but the tank pattern is pretty ugly. I am 5'4&#34;, weigh 130 and have a 34 B chest. The medium fit great."
4.0,"I love the birds, my friends and I had fun identifying them. It's comfy but has a tendency to bunch on the sides by the end of the day. But...IT HAS POCKETS."
4.0,"I like the pink and navy blue colors of the two different sunglass cases included.  It is a good value for the money.  The leather covering seems durable, but soft and flexible at the same time.  The inside feels like the soft cloth that I use to clean my glasses.  The case will easily fit in a purse or even a pocket as it is slim and lightweight.  My only complaint is that it says that it will easily open with one hand by squeezing the corners.  Both my daughter and I find it a bit difficult to open that way.  It was easier for both of us to stick a finger in the middle and then press the two sided to open it up.  You will not have to worry about your glasses accidentally falling out with this case!"
4.0,"Lovely necklace, but the engraving wasn't the best quality. The word &#34;forever&#34; had the last letter partially cut off. It gets the sentiment across, but I just wish it was aligned better. It was shipped loose in a plastic bag, a jewelry box would have been nice to use as a gift, but the item arrived in good shape anyway."
4.0,I love this but it gets quite warm to wear.
4.0,Very comfortable  when you take them off after my long hours of work
4.0,"Pleased with the jacket<br />Fits well, very lightweight, good for the warmer months because it’s a thin jacket"
4.0,These fit great and they are tight but kinda bulky that's why I cannot wear it under my shirt when going outside. I would wear them more often if it had a better design and wouldn't show as much. I also feel they are effective.I felt much improvement 6 weeks postpartum.
4.0,"I love the hourglass shape this coat gives. It is slimming, while still being a ‘puffer’ style. I would describe it as a light-medium weight coat. The material is a tighter weave than I had expected from the photo, which makes it retain more heat. The material has a sheen to it, but is not shiny like in the photos. The zippers on the coat are plastic and will need extra care when zipping so they wont be easily ruined. The fur on the hood is the quality you would expect. I am a Womens size 4, 125#, 34B, I purchased a small because it was the better price. There is enough space to wear a sweatshirt underneath. I could easily have sized down to an xs.<br />As a whole, this coat is exceeds my expectations. If you can get it for a deal, snag one!"
4.0,"Great look, love the screw on system. They're a little bulky and really don't look that much like wood. The black one looks like plastic and the mid tone one is almost as dark as the black."
4.0,My son wears this hat all the Time. Seems comfortable and durable.
4.0,Very cute and vintage
4.0,"Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.  I did think the material would be a bit thicker since I purchased a dress similar to it but, not a deal breaker.  I ordered a size up for a more loose fit to wear with leggings."
4.0,"This purse is much bigger than I expected and a kind of heavy, however, it is very well made.  I expect it will last a long time.  I got many compliments on it over the holidays."
4.0,Too skinny. Otherwise this is an awesome cheap belt that seems to have a sturdy buckle
4.0,"Nice travel case for the products in the bundle very sharp tweezers and nice blade, wish the blade wasn’t so ridged and could use better plastic material for a stronger hold but overall good product for the price"
4.0,Body fits well but shoulders feel tighter. But overall is comfortable and nice looking (bought white logo on gray)
4.0,Light Weight not heavy
4.0,I love this head band. It was cheap and it is really cute. I put it on as soon as i received it!
4.0,The goggles and nose plug are awesome. I ended up cutting the earplugs off the goggles because they fall out when you swim anyway. The cap is not waterproof and slides on when I swim fast.
4.0,"The tag on the side is the worst it is big and stiff so it makes weird lump on your side. I removed it and BAM a hole appeared right there after 2 washes, no I do not dry in the dryer. I won't re-order this one but I would by from the company again."
4.0,"The pattern is really pretty, just have to be careful with my rings so I don't damage the fabric."
4.0,"Overall, very good, provides high-visibility, and the flashing stripes on the back are great at night.  Three suggestions for improvement:  First,  the zipper on the front pouch is delicate, and it's easy to pull the slider off (good luck fixing it).  Second, the clips that hold the side straps to the front click shut easily, but they are a pain to get open.  Third, since the back has flashing stripes, some loops on the front to attach small flashing lights would be welcome."
4.0,"its cute, I wish it would support you more... there is this weird type of fabric on the swimsuit that helps hide the mommy tummy, but no one notices."
4.0,"Review for wife:<br />❤ Very nice bag. Looks like picture. It was fumey so, febreze it and then air it out for a couple hours."
4.0,The post was a little too short for my helix but it is still very pretty and I may try to use in future ear piercings i get. 4 stars cause the post is only 6 mm.
4.0,"The band is excellent, but the spring pins are just too short of 22mm to stay in place."
4.0,"Using the dress for a benefit.  I love the dress, but it’s real thin so had to buy a bandeau for a bra and under chest is kind of snug but acceptable.  The dress itself is absolutely gorgeous!"
4.0,"The color is perfect, just like in picture and the size is accurate.<br />I gave 4 stars, because it came with a defect in one of the strip of the right shoe and when I use it for long time it is uncomfortable"
4.0,Runs a bit big if you have a skinny child.
4.0,The jacket is a little off on the size but it is well made and a nice corduroy jacket. As for size I normally wear 2x but the jacket is tight around my torso so I would suggest going a 1 size up when ordering.
4.0,LOVE THE PRINT...HIDES THE JIGGLES ON UPPER ARMS...MATERIAL IS VERY THIN..WORE TO A PICNIC....SAT DOWN A LOT!  LOL
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:604b087db7b0c769dcd1e0f5a711bbb]] I like that they are small, the price is right,<br />And made well. I loose earrings all the time and with this price I won’t be upset when I do."
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but it had about 7 knots in it that took over an hour to get out.<br />The chain is very fragile and block is tinier than I expected
4.0,"Sizing can be a little off. I ordered this dress in two different colors, in the same size. One fit perfect and the other was too big. Overall it's a cute dress.<br />Oh and the color &#34;lime&#34; is actually yellow. I was a little bummed about that."
4.0,The stones are lively and the color attractive.  I have received positive comment when I wore it.  I just wish it was 925 silver.  I hope the chain and backside remains attractive thru many wearing.
4.0,"I love the bathing suit, just wished I could have sized the top and bottom separately."
4.0,"I ordered a 5.5, fit more like a 6- 6.5 would, so it is going back.  sad, because they don't offer a size 5."
4.0,These were very cute and fancy looking at a very nice price.
4.0,"Overall, it is a nice shirt. Thick material keeps you warm. I had to clean up a few stray threads, nothing major. The biggest problem was the insignia. The gold part had started to peel away in most areas and was completed lifted in others. I had to take some glue to it....and it doesn't look the best. I was issued a partial refund so I could order a new insignia patch to replace myself."
4.0,"Hard-shell is an understatement. Love the design and the shape but it's a strong case indeed. Doesn't open easily. Watch your fingers upon closing, snaps fast and hard!"
4.0,"Cute and fits, just have to put it on over my head. The middle won't come up over my hips. 5&#34;3 and around 130."
4.0,My son loves these. They are great for indoor turf work or winter workout programs.
4.0,"Love the color and style, supports the girls really well even though it's low cut. Overall it's a really cute suit, however, medium says size 8-10, (I am a size 8) and it was slightly too small. Also, the torso is quite short, and I'd say I'm of average torso size."
4.0,They look great. Like the style. I will order another pair.
4.0,Only criticism I have is the description says they can be cleaned in the dishwasher. The instructions don't tell you how to do that. I was hoping.  . .
4.0,"Cute skirt. It has a matte finish, so it almost looks like real leather.  You can pair it with blouses, sweaters, high boots, booties, and more. Very versatile. You need to follow size chart for the right size."
4.0,"My grandson loves these tees. The graphics are fantastic! The color on this one was darker than the picture, but I don't mind it. They do run a size small, but they don't shrink unless you over dry on high heat"
4.0,Flattering and so comfortable. I felt charming and feminine in this and loved wearing it. Wore it to a summer baptism and felt great.
4.0,Easy to put on. Zipper really helps. The socks appear to be doing the job!
4.0,Comfortable  and thin perfect for warm/hot weather!!
4.0,"Great royal blue color very comfy, it does run larger.<br />Im 5'9&#34; 165, 40&#34; chest and it fits like a large... Good enough for cold night .... Be aware if you have pets that shed this is a magnet to pet hair. I also ordered the maroon... Returning that one it's more of a burgundy color."
4.0,I have been looking for tortoiseshell earrings for my girlfriend and I found these! She loves them. Not heavy or too large.
4.0,"I bought these to use on an international trip. The metal strap on one of the tags came apart after about three days of being handled. The screw-down fastener did not unscrew - the cable just pulled out of one end of the fastener.<br />They are very nice otherwise, but if they fall off the bags, not very useful...<br />FOLLOW-UP. After I posted the original review, the company reached out to me and sent a complete set of new cables. I stress tested these and they work great. Super customer service!"
4.0,Just opened my mask and there is only one a tea filter where it says you get 2 extra filters. Smdh how hard is it? You had one job!
4.0,Great to sleep in as there is little support.  Very comfortable to wear around the house.
4.0,"Color is just the oddest thing when it comes to computer screens. I ordered the wine red in this shirt, which arrived in a blood red (think 1950's lipstick), but when I take the photo on my phone, it's orange red.<br /><br />Be that as it may, although I don't usually wear a deep red, it kind of works for me, and wonder of wonders, I ordered my normal size and it fits. I'm a size 8 Petite, and it's really a roll of the dice whether I get something that fits or not. The shirt is a bit boxy, but it's soft, which I really like, and comfortable. A good buy, as long as you're flexible on color."
4.0,Nice workout
4.0,I wanted a snug fit and that’s what I got!
4.0,Love the design. It was a little tighter than I was expecting. No biggie.
4.0,Can't wear to work because it's low-cut butveey cute for casual weekend. I got medium
4.0,"This was my first corset and i was expecting it to be ungidly uncomfortable, surprisingly it wasnt uncomfortable at all."
4.0,I loved this dress. It was the little things that made me frustrated.<br />1 the zipper was wonky for my dress. Im so glad I was able to slip on the dress with out having to unzip it because it was a real struggle to get that suckered down.<br /> 2The gems that came with it were broken.<br />3. the bows were sown on wrong!. Instead of facing out on the arms it was sewn on the sleeve facing towards my body. A detail that at that point is hidden because I don't walk around with my arms up lol. The cream lace in the front I wasn't the biggest fan if I had the chops and time I might have dyed it gold.<br />If your on the shorter side. I would recommend alterations even with the panniers on it was dragging a lot
4.0,"The shirt is soft and the design is pretty.  I was really surprised to see it was a little on the short, wide side - as opposed to your normal long, narrow t-shirt sizing.  Perhaps the measurements reflected that but I don't normally need to double check measurements on t-shirts.  It's not terrible and I can make it work, just a heads up for others looking to purchase the shirt."
4.0,Tie bar is a different look with dark colored ties and stands out with light colored ties. Clip holds the tie in place very well.
4.0,"This is like a night gown, the material is very thin and light weight, super comfortable.  Only complaint is the V neck is Way too deep,"
4.0,Nice dress fits well
4.0,"I purchased this handbag October 2015.  Today is my first day using the bag.  It is pretty, large enough for all of my necessities. I have this bag in orange and it is a good looking bag. The color is spot on, the size is spot on and it seems sturdy enough. But I've only carried it for the 1st time today. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I've gotten compliments on this bag and it came within 2 days (thanks to Prime).  I have no problems with this bag so far, will update if need be in the future. The leather is Pebble leather. The price is phenomenal for a leather bag. Looks like a more expensive bag. Gold hardware, feet on the bottom, nice long shoulder strap, inside pockets and a zip pocket outside.  As of now, I have no complaints and would recommend."
4.0,Great pair for the price
4.0,Very good essential for travel outside the United States. I wear anti Chaft cotton or modal biker underwear underneath. Cute and cool with flip flops and a T shirt
4.0,"For what you pay this obviously wont last forever, but it is still cute nonetheless!"
4.0,"I like this bracelet, but cannot figure out how to tie the stings so they aren't hanging and get caught in something. Do you have directions to show how t secure this bracelet I am going to have to return this bracelet. It truly is good looking, just need help how to secure with such long strings."
4.0,These run dark and I often have to lift them up see numbers on my dashboard.....they do stay up well in the flipped position
4.0,"These earrings are pretty-----the colors will go well with many things. The backs of them are black, but won't show when on.<br />C.Thomas"
4.0,"Really cool jacket - best feature is probably how THIN this jacket really is! Very comfortable and I can only imagine this would be a great piece to wear at a convention. Won't feel too hot in it, and the only small knock is that it does fit a tad smaller than expected. So DEFINITELY order a size up for comfort!"
4.0,"The dress is pretty, but the top portion is small. The sleeves and length are fine. Best to size-up if you are concerned about it fitting your bust size."
4.0,Gift for my teenage daughter and she loved it. Good price too
4.0,Nice product because it can not fade
4.0,Little big but looks great
4.0,Perfect for Holoween. or anytime really. Very cute. Got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"This little sun hat is nice, but not very protective from the sun. It fits to size, but the fabric is not as thick as I would have expected. It is a cute accessory item if you are wearing it for style, but if you are wearing it for protection from the sun, I would recommend additional protection."
4.0,"Warm, soft, comfy. quality material for the price"
4.0,My only problem is I cannot pry the band off to replace with something nicer.
4.0,"These camisoles are nice in material and colors (the blue is a really rich royal blue). The material feels nice and soft and the little bit of lace trim at the top on front is also soft and adds a nice touch. They do fit as expected in size, however, they run short in length. I have a longer torso so these come to just below my belly button.  Not quite a crop top but not as long as I would have preferred.<br /><br />Review of 3 PCS Womens Silk Satin Lace Trim Cami Tank Tops V Neck Camisole Spaghetti Strap Tops Sleeveless Blouse"
4.0,Warm and comfy but it makes my feet sweat and now the slippers stink something fierce.  Will wearing socks help with that?  I don't know.
4.0,"These wear out after about 6 months, but that's with me wearing them practically every day. But it's fine, I generally just order a new pair and I'm good to go. A great closet staple. And the elastic fits my wide feet!"
4.0,Very soft and i loved the color. The color came off easily though.
4.0,"Looks great, feels great just order a size up. I ordered xl then ordered 2x in other colors 2x fit's perfect."
4.0,"For the money you pay it is a great skirt, fits me true to size (I ordered a small and am 5'4).  However the material is a little on the thin side(doesn't bother me) and the skirt is definitely not as structured/narrow as shown in the pictures- I am probably going to take the sides in a bit.  Overall a great skirt, but just might need a little tweaking to fit properly."
4.0,Love the styles. But always surprised when I have to buy 2 sizes larger to fit right. Generally I find the tops are not meant to accommodate a larger cup size.
4.0,"I would have given this a 5 star but the color is more darker than the picture.I do like it,though and fits nice and the fabric is silky and comfortable.I ordered an XXXL and normally wear an XL and it fits perfect.Really flowy and nice.Just wish it would have come as the same color as picture ,but it still looks nice."
4.0,It is very cute but it is not big enough to use as a briefcase.  You can't zipper it with files in it and my computer that is 13x10 does not fit.
4.0,"The fit was spot on and I enjoy wearing it in the house. Honestly, the cup areas shift when walking which means I'm constantly re-covering myself. Any bigger, it would be too big. Any smaller and it wouldn't fit. So I definitely got my right size. Other than that, it's pretty comfortable and easy to uncover myself when nursing."
4.0,"Purchased this tie a couple of months ago and wear it every now and again. Good quality, good colors. Not too long or too short. Would buy again in the future (but since I like it, I'm sure they will stop making it; that always seems to happen to me)."
4.0,these work great better than laces but they do come out now and then about three times in the last 3 months
4.0,Beatifull but a little small.
4.0,I bought these aprons for work and they definitely get the job done. I was hoping for more water to be repeled but if you get a few drops of water on the apron it does usually roll off. Also about half of the aprons' pockets ripped after the first wash. Not the best quality but you get alot for the price.
4.0,"Really pretty, BUT, one stone was missing, although the stone was in the box.  Bride-perfect; a bit much for other attendants."
4.0,Looked like real pearls had some weight to them perfect length
4.0,My son loves the shirt!  Good color and size fits as expected
4.0,well made and very pretty.
4.0,"The black and leopard glasses are beautiful and fit great, the cream one is clear and so looks a little too big for my face."
4.0,"I used this product on several of my family’s sneakers, shoes and crocs.  Basically this will lift surface dirt off pretty well.  The only resistance I encountered was usually with the built in dirt in the white side walls of sneakers.  For that area I needed to incorporate a stronger bristle than that of the included brush.  This is a very economical and useful product.  I definitely will see much more uses with this cleaning solution and brush than say a canister of instant sneaker cleaner which I will go through with maybe six adult sneaker cleanings but this will easily take me to an estimated 50-70 adult and children sneaker cleanings, producing similar results at a much, much lower cost.  Just be sure to use a more abrasive rush for the white side walls and you will be pretty satisfied. The included brush is good for the upper surfaces of sneakers and shoes."
4.0,"I ordered this for a lounge set for myself.  It does fit as expected.  I am a 12-14 and ordered the large.  The material is super soft and comfortable.  I think it is priced a little high for a solid color 2 piece set.  This could be worn in public but to me is more of just a basic staple item for wearing around the house.  I didn't notice this is ""HAND WASH ONLY"" when I ordered."
4.0,"looks as pictured but the arms were extremely small, not a fan of the shoulder padding it doesn't stay put."
4.0,"The rings are very cute, but they are very small. I wear a size 8 normally, and there was no way that I could get these on my top knuckles. I gave them to my sister who wears a ring size 6 with skinny fingers, and they fit her top knuckles perfectly"
4.0,"Works well enough, ceramic plate takes a while to heat up."
4.0,Really nice.  Went well with the earrings I also purchased.  It did snag on fabric easily though so I had to be careful.  I can see where it may be too small for some people though.  I have rather small wrists (~5.8&#34; circumference) and it fit me just right but I'd say anyone with larger than 6&#34; it will be tight/the rows separate (it's elastic) which depending on your look may or may not work.
4.0,Pros -long/tall (knee length)<br />  Very Light weight.<br />  Color looks good<br /><br />Cons - not thick (good for normal cold  weather not warm enough for snow)<br />Weird collar.
4.0,"I purchased this romper because I loved the color and the way it appeared to fit – and it is exactly as pictured. The shipping took about 5 days, which wasn’t awful, and it was packaged well. I thought that because of the way it was packaged it would be wrinkled but it wasn’t at all. The material is pretty much just lace so it didn’t impact the material. I absolutely love the teal color. It’s even prettier in person than it is in the pictures. I felt a bit odd buttoning the bottom part – it reminds me of a baby onesie haha. But once I did, the romper fit my hips so much better and really did look good. My only issue is with the ties in the back of the romper. Because they are so low, its almost impossible to reach them and tie them yourselves. And if you want your significant other to be surprised by your outfit you can’t just ask for help tying it haha.<br />Overall, I gave 4 of 5 stars because other than the tying issue, I love this romper and am pleased with my purchase. The material is very thin which is common for outfits such as this. As mentioned in the description it will definitely need to be hand washed. I recommend this little outfit if you’re looking for something sexy, but also different than the average outfits. I did receive this romper for free or at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review and would never recommend a product that I wouldn’t use myself."
4.0,Was a little stiff but after a wash it was more comfortable.
4.0,This is so pretty and feminine and very well made. You will not be disappointed. I would recommend thid piece.
4.0,It is comfortable but not to go outside with.<br />High quality and soft.<br />You can wear it at home
4.0,"I am 5'3"" and the Capri is more of a high water pants on me; coming to the lower shin.  The other review stating that you would have a swishing sound when you walk, is correct.  The pants are comfortable, light weight, and made in China.  Due to the way it fits me, I would probably only wear it at home, or around family."
4.0,My size 34 waist fit great great. Very comfortable and warm. Seems to be a slight variation in side zipper pocket openings. Not a big deal though considering the price and comfort. Beware though there is much inconsistency in the sizing of all these companies that sell the same brand of pants. I ordered two more of the same brand and size from other companies and they did not fit. If you get a pair in your size that does fit consider yourself lucky.
4.0,Well I've put the disco ball looking ones on and so far so good.
4.0,"Great length, snap closure perfect, nice weight fabric content. Washes and dries beautifully. Traditionally, the curious design of these long lab coats is the seamed  opening by the side pockets. I believe this opening permits more comfort in seating and movement for all size girth of wearers - without the snaps popping open.. I appreciate  the design and I love the snaps and wear of the garment. This is a very reasonable price point. Thank-you Oasis for making this product available here on Amazon at a reasonable price."
4.0,"I wanted to post an accurate photo of what the 2g sized jewelry looks like. The metal surrounding the tunnel is thicker, which negatively impacts the design, in my opinion. Still a great option, though. Comfortable and easy to wear."
4.0,Glasses are really large.
4.0,The black tank top ripped under the arm as soon as I tried to get it off. The others fit and stretch just fine.
4.0,"Nice! Great colors & quality. A little shorter than I was expecting (don't come quite as far up my leg, as I would like), but there is still plenty of length to them. If you are wearing them with short boots, there are a few inches that are above the boot line."
4.0,I like how the necklace makes me look older and lik im a surfer. bUT ITS HARD TO LOCK it
4.0,"Pros:<br />Relatively comfortable fit<br />Very cool design<br /><br />Cons:<br />Strap was torn a bit upon delivery.<br />Bit hard to breathe in.<br />Spikes get in the way of my eyesight, thankfully they're removeable"
4.0,Super comfortable but totally tears up my Achilles tendon. Will probably not use these for exercise.
4.0,Worn with a Halloween costume.
4.0,"This shirt was a BIG HIT, my 3-year-old loved getting it and loved wearing it. We wore it about once a week for the past three months. Now the vinyl decoration is starting to peel off, and we are very sad. I still recommend this shirt for truck-loving kids, but this is meant to be a special occasion shirt not an everyday shirt."
4.0,Way Smaller Than I thought it would be.
4.0,I like it but I have one reservation.  It is not an authentic rose gold color.
4.0,"Overall, really great boots. They fit a little smaller than expected, but after a few days of wearing them, they stretched out. I wore them 10 hours the 3rd day and until the last hour, they were really comfortable."
4.0,Really cute but these are made of plastic and are not shells. They also have a plastic smell.
4.0,Pretty! Goes great with a lighter pink shirt or jacket.nice size.
4.0,Only thing I don't like about them is that they stretch out and don't go back to shape after wear. Haven't washed them yet so maybe will then.
4.0,Okay it's not the greatest quality construction but it is so cute looking!  Great for teens. I got a pink in for my niece and a white one for my nephew and the LOVED them!  It is also very easy to adjust the size
4.0,I like the pattern and fabric.  Inseam fit me fine.  They were a bit on the snug side where the long pants fit perfectly.  A bit on the snug side even if plus size.  I would buy them again.
4.0,Using right now. It makes me happy and protects my tablet. Longish wait time so if you're in a hurry this might not be the one for you.
4.0,comfortable soft material.....  arrived on time.....will last for years...<br /><br />good fit...that is the best I could say 4.0  good job<br />thank you
4.0,The dress fit my daughter perfect!!! The color is perfect ....!!! The ONLY issue I have is it arrived with a hole right underneath the breast area :(
4.0,Bought this for my daughter. It's a stretch material and she loved it.
4.0,Fits ok. Price fits quality
4.0,I bought these for my boyfriend but they are my favorite to wear.
4.0,"The beads are just as shown in the product photo: very pretty.<br /><br />However, my bracelet measures closer to 20 cm than 19 (as stated in the product description, although the labeled product photo says 7.9&quot;, which is 20 cm), and when you compress the space between beads to nothing, my bracelet has a gap of about 2 inches without beads. That means the bracelet's rotation on your wrist will be noticeable. So I'm deducting a star for the product photos being staged to look like the beads fill the chain.<br /><br />Some reviewers report receiving a lobster clasp closure; mine is barrel clasp.<br /><br />All the beads have a lot of texture to them, whether facets, small stones or the mold of the metal. Nice that they provide a silicon stopper to keep the beads on the chain when opened. The safety chain has solid, not clip-on, beads.<br /><br />Time will tell whether the materials wear well.<br /><br />I had placed this in my wish list, and the Amazon Shopping App notified me when it was on a flash sale. Hooray Amazon!"
4.0,"5’4”, 121lbs, ordered an XS.<br />These leggings are thick enough to remain squat proof even in dark undies (see second pic) and stay up well during a workout. Though not as “buttery soft” as the infamous lululemon or athleta leggings, they’re well worth the price.<br />4 stars because I ordered the color “Slate” which looked like a light green by the photos, but appeared closer to a periwinkle color in person. However, I like how this color looks too so I’m keeping them!"
4.0,"Just as described - bodice is made of a stretchy 'spandex-like' material and the underskirt is cotton. Has held up just fine in the wash (2x so far, hang to dry). It appears that it may also be sold otherwise with cape or something as ours has small clear buttons on the back of each shoulder."
4.0,I love the shirt. Wasn’t happy when looking at it from packaging. But it’s very cute. Super soft. It works!
4.0,only problem it ran small
4.0,The concho are a little smaller then I expected! I had ordered one in the same brand in black. The belt itself is beautiful.
4.0,"Normally I order a medium, even though the size chart says small. In this case, order your size. Small was correct. Great product.... but heavier than I thought. It does kerp you warm, though."
4.0,"Pretty chill cheap shades.  I have a fairly big head, so these are kind of tight but not migraine-inducing or anything like that.  I've worn them a lot so far."
4.0,Costume is more of an olive green then a gray. The hat is rubber and the Pom Pom was just safety-pinned on. That was disappointing. But construction of the costume itself is very nice and I look forward to showing it off.
4.0,"Looks Pretty, it feels a little hard on your skin but I didn't mind and fits a little short, so if you are tall size up. I am tiny 5ft and it fits me JUST right"
4.0,A little bit loose. Straps are not adjustable.
4.0,Well made.  Fabric has a lot of body to it with a little bit of stretch.
4.0,"Fantastic! I now own 5 different colors of this dress. It fits SO comfortable, and it has pockets!! I can actually fit my phone in my pocket. The cut is very forgiving if you’re dealing with some extra tummy fat, it hides it well. But they still look great when you feel skinny! Can’t wait for summer to come back so I can wear them again!"
4.0,Great product does not look fake and stay on secure
4.0,"Perfect fit just need to be careful if wearing any jewelries tends to get caught easily and runs..have to cut some strands while I was trying it on and after wearing it. Overall, pretty good deal for its price."
4.0,"I'll start off by saying how incredibly stylish these glasses are in person. I'm picky with glasses and I found no problem with it's design at all. Not only are they sleek in person and on wear, the build of the frames itself is solid. I was expecting them to flimsy but that wasn't the case at all. Not for the most important part. These arrived when I was actually mid game and was actually experience some eyestrain and I put them on right away to test em out. I actually liked em a lot during game and I was a bit more focused. I can't speak on long term but for my time with em, I enjoyed them a lot and definitely recommend them."
4.0,They keep your feet warm and have a cute saying on the bottom.
4.0,As advertised these shorts are buttery soft. They feel like you’re not wearing anything at all which is very comfortable. This light blue shade isn’t very forgiving if you’ve got any cellulite/dimples/ripples whatever ya wanna call it on the backside/thighs but it’s not see through as it passes the down dog test (aka you couldn’t tell I had a black undergarment on when I bent over).<br />As far as sizing goes I ordered a medium in black but I received this light blue/gray color without a size tag so honestly I don’t know what size I got. If I did get Medium they’re true to size. I’m a 27/4 and these fit me well. They have a lot of stretch to them so even if I was a size higher or smaller I think they would work!
4.0,Could be more generously sized. Love look.
4.0,"It's cute, just would prefer different material. Size 5/6 fits perfectly to 6 years old."
4.0,Got at a very good price and free shipping with PRIME.  Very happy with puRchase.
4.0,Very good value for the money. Good fit and finish. Ver comfortable and warming. Color  holds well after washing. Definite recommend to friends.
4.0,"This dress was absolutely beautiful on me!! I felt so amazing!! I normally wear a size 22/24 so.i went ahead and ordered the 4X. It was extremely tight in the chest on me, however, I have G cups, so I wasn't surprised by that. It was slightly uncomfortable, but not enough to deter me from wearing it for a night out. I'm 5'10&#34; and it fell below my knees. Very beautiful!"
4.0,These shorts are too long in the inseam but will do for wearing under dresses. This material really collects lint and pet hair like crazy. Will not purchase this brand again.
4.0,"I love these watches and they are really cool to put on. I had three previously and I wanted to buy another from amazon. When the package arrived, it unfortunately does not have the same face color like in the picture (white & orange). Instead, I received a white band with a black & white face. However, in my opinion this looks way cooler than the white and orange face on the picture! So if you are looking to buy this, just know that I didn't receive the same colored face in the description."
4.0,"it was great but my wife is 5'7 and weighs 115 and this was still kind of small, well not to tight just not long enough. But for what you are paying for it is good enough."
4.0,"This ring is beautiful! I bought it for my husband as a replacement for his wedding band that is worn out. I will say that this ring is very light, it almost feels plastic. I wonder about it’s authenticity. I gave four stars because it is very pretty!"
4.0,"I bought this for my wife after we were inspired by the wands at Harry Potter world in Orlando. The licensed wands are cast resin, which look and feel very nice, but I wanted a real wood wand. Since I don't have a lathe at my house right now, I took to Amazon and was not disappointed. My wife loves owls, so this was absolutely perfect. She was very happy to see this when she unwrapped it. I was worried that it might be broken after shipping since it had happened to a few other reviewers, but ours arrived in perfect condition. It's well-made, well-finished with a nice satin finish. It is a bit big, even to me, and I understand that the details would be difficult to get if it were smaller, but, the one in the picture does look a little more proportionate. Just something to consider.<br />It is solid wood (Terminalia chebula; an Asian fruit tree that I've never heard of, but seems to have a tight grain conducive to detailed carving) and has a good weight to it.<br />Overall it's very nice indeed, and my wife is ready to start collecting and displaying even more."
4.0,"The fabric was not as soft as I was hoping for, but the fit was nice. I am still planning on ordering another in a different color."
4.0,"Didn't fit as like I thought it would, but hope to fit in it soon."
4.0,Cute shirt but the size was a little off!
4.0,Very cute shoe but was a little loose. I also didn't like the fake buckle.
4.0,I ordered a size 5/6. Received a 6/7 - which wasn’t even an option when ordering. So they are too big to but they seem nice otherwise.
4.0,This dress is very comfortable. The color was teal in the picture but  more greenish in person but not a huge deal. I’d buy from this seller again though.
4.0,"Looks just like the picture but it’s more cropped than I expected , so I have to find a reaaaally high waisted jeans"
4.0,Very pleased with my purchase.  The music notes and clef add a nice addition to my bracelet and music background.
4.0,Cute and fits really well. The buttons on the front aren’t real like the other dress I have just like it.
4.0,Great peice to add for ur sublimation. Plus the socks as a added bonus to get u started right away
4.0,Daughter said they are very comfortable and loves the gold. They are rose gold not gold.
4.0,A very nice looking belt in a gift box and a thank you note enclosed. The belt looks well made at a good price.
4.0,"Quite great if it fits.<br />Size up, it’s quite tight, so my baby will outgrow this one very fast.<br /><br />Cheaper than other brands of bamboo clothing, but the quality is similar. This one is a tad thinner than others.<br />It’s also soft, and smooth as rhe other bamboo pjs, but quite tight.<br />There is another brand starting with letter K that I find even tighter, but probably twice the price of these.<br />Too bad don’t have bigger sizes, I don’t like the pjs fitting super tight.<br />Also sadly just one color. I’d liked different color options, could’ve bought many more.<br />Brown is really not my preferred color, but it’s really a great price for bamboo pjs."
4.0,"Fleece is warm but nice and thin.<br />I like the gloves and they look more expensive than they are. However, I still had to take them off to use my touch phone.<br />Also the fingers are on the long side so they were a little long for my short fingers, but I didn't mind that too touch."
4.0,"The photo “looks” like the band I received but there is a difference. I ordered this band because I wanted the attaching pins to be a part of the watch like the photo shows. But when I received it, the pins were separate. May seem trivial, but when your fingers don’t work as well as they used to, it makes it difficult to work with small pieces.  The band is very nice and I was able (after several times) to get the band attached."
4.0,"Lovely, leather gloves.  Classy looking."
4.0,Haven't had a chance to try it out but do think it was smaller than I was expected. Seems to be well made.
4.0,These are pretty but look cheap.  They didn't cost much so the price is reasonable.  I will wear for patriotic celebrations.
4.0,Looked great to the wedding I wore it to. Wish it was about 2 inches longer.
4.0,Colors are perfect for a rainbow unicorn themed birthday outfit! True to size. The bow came with a safety pin to attach where ever. You could even use it as a hair bow.
4.0,A little tight for a 73/8 head
4.0,These are snug and keep my feet warm and dry. Love ‘em.
4.0,Feels very soft and comfortable  just wish it came a length for shorter people. I had to hem but didn’t mind.
4.0,Really cute but took forever to arrive
4.0,"Perfect little cheap watch. Nothing fancy though it looks good, slim and light weight. The band is a little small, but I’m happy"
4.0,The additional filter made the mask safer but felt thick. The ear loops were adjustable so mask is eAsy to fit for anyone.
4.0,"I love this skirt, but I am 5'6 and it comes down to half way down my calf"
4.0,"Loved the dress, got a lot of compliments on it. The material is soft and has some give which is important for a plus size gal. The reason for 4-stars is because if you have a big booty it’s VERY short in the back. I couldn’t wear it without leggings. Everywhere else the fit was great and it was still a very cute outfit. Also, can’t beat the price! I WILL be ordering other colors and match them with leggings."
4.0,"So nice and cute,"
4.0,I'm in between a 10-12 so I purchased xl. Both dresses fit pretty good.
4.0,"This was a gift for my son who is stationed with the Navy in Virginia Beach, VA.  He is a tall big guy and he is thrilled with this sweatshirt. Since I do not live close by, I have no idea how it holds up to washing and drying. He specified ""preshrunk fibers"" and this fill the bill. I hope this sweatshirt holds up well for him."
4.0,"I like  tha length  and texture of tha  material, but its abit small,  even though I ordered  large, because  I wear extra large."
4.0,"For the price, much more than expected.. Love it. Would give five stars if it had a screw on core."
4.0,"Really beautiful dress, great fit, ok material ......much better than I expected!"
4.0,"The red bag isn't EXACTLY as dark as it is in the display photos, however it's still a pretty darkISH color. Depending on the light you're under, the color may vary as well. The length of the strap is pretty great. I wanted something fashionable yet sturdy enough for my Polaroid. It was a perfect fit, and I think they compliment each other very well. The only thing I might have to complain about, is the ability to stretch. I never had a leather type bag before, so I'm not sure if it's because of the material of the bag or because it's new but It's a little difficult to stretch open the main part and the extra pocket that's in the front. But I assume that it just needs to broken in. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase and will be taking it everywhere!"
4.0,"Beautiful chain, just longer than I expected. But, I will have 2 deal w/it. But I'm satisfied."
4.0,"It runs slightly small, but I love mine. It have been pretty much living in it since I received it. The hood is a nice size an l love the neckline. The buttons do come unbuttoned around the hips when I sit down quickly. But, I think it's because it's slightly snug. Overall, I really think it's a good value for the price."
4.0,"For the price, this a great sexy Sailor Mars cosplay. The skirt is very short, so booty will be showing, so this isn't going out in public. This sailor scout will be fighting the Dark Kingdom from the comfort of home!<br />The item came folded in a small bag, as all these types of items do, and looked terrible because of how wrinkled everything was, but having bought a lot of cosplay items online, I know items like this just need a good steaming before they can look their best, and it definitely made it look great.<br />You MUST MUST MUST take the bows off and steam them separately from the rest of the dress, the fabric the use for that is a runner and will stain the white top if you don't. I had already taken them off and steamed them on a towl, that's how I found out, and I'm glad I did it that way.<br />Paired with some white nylons and white elbow cloves for the ultimate drop dead look :3"
4.0,Good jacket and good quality ! Get your exact size if purchasing
4.0,"Looks cute on, gets dirty quickly hard to wash"
4.0,These are really cute! I did decuct one star only because the spaces are pretty far apart in the sandals and my son's tiny toes tend to fall out. I am hoping he gets used to it so I don't have to return.
4.0,Very pretty. Nice designs.
4.0,"I'm a 5'8"" woman and the men's medium fits me just fine. Its a pretty decent costume for the price, it includes pants, shirt, white coat, mask and head covering. The white coat looks and feels more like a long blouse than a lab coat though, but aside from that no real complaints."
4.0,zipper and snap should be on the same side
4.0,Love the vibrant colors! Nice and heavy too!
4.0,Im a 36C for chest and I wouldn't recommended it for someone larger.<br />Same for the bottom and Im a 37 for hips. Great cheeky look but its a size too small and gives more than just cheeky look...it gives some love handles.
4.0,Cool band. Interested to see how the stitching will hold up. Band is pretty stiff and a little itchy against the underside of wrist where the strap holders are. Assuming that will lessen when it becomes more pliable. Good value for the money.
4.0,It's a good fit; except the sleeves. Just count on it being a 3/4 sleeve or maybe even a 1/2 sleeve.
4.0,"Cute socks for flip flops. I wear an 11 womens shoe, so these were a bit small. I like V-Toes athletic socks better. A bit thicker material and a better fit."
4.0,We got this for our 8 year old niece for christmas and it was a hit.  Quality seems just right for the price.  The fact that it's magnetic is great for the kids or for traveling.  No complaints.
4.0,"Very good quality; well made.  I like that it is 88% cotton, as the other brand name dancewear sold on Amazon is 90% nylon and no cotton.  It fits my tall, slender 5 year-old daughter snugly now, but I was expecting there to be a bit more room, considering this is a size 6x-7.  Still, overall, happy with the purchase."
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments on this dress. The color is vibrant. However, it runs big. I sized down 1 size but could've gone down one more. The skirt has more volume than shown in the picture."
4.0,"These fit ok but were a little baggy in some spots and a little scratchy. I thought they might soften with some gentle handwashing, and they did to some extent, but not like I thought. I will see how well they last down the road. They are a very pretty style though."
4.0,The picture gives the appearance that the sweater is larger.  I do like it and will keep it.  I think it will be comfortable with jeans and maybe a short sleeve or sleeveless turtle neck.  I am praying that the weather here in Southern California turns cold so I can wear it!!!!  We are in the 80's and Christmas is just a few days away and I am hoping to be able to wear it Christmas Eve.
4.0,"Better than I expected and a good fit, easy to launder, too. I like them!"
4.0,Beautiful Jean's just too large for my daughter. Will buy a smaller size. However I had to pay for repackaging and label! Not cool.
4.0,"I saw 2 pictures. Believe the tomato red color,  I successfully changed the shade to 1 with no orange by using Tarrago Bordeaux shoe cream-self shining, which I use on my leather chairs, a dk rose,upon the advise of my shoe repaitman.  It also dyed the strings. takes 2 thin coats which also waterproofs. I also put in wool insoles."
4.0,Nice hat. Wish the forehead part was re-enforced. It is just cloth with no shape. Color scheme is very brilliant though.
4.0,I just ordered 6 of these swords and covers for my troupe.  They are very nice swords and all of them are perfectly balanced.
4.0,"Bought this for my husband and he loves it!! He used it for gym the very next day, will buy more.."
4.0,"It is nice, but little small."
4.0,"house shoes, do their job, slip on"
4.0,Beautiful sweater casual yet comfortable. It does run small though. I’d order up a size or even 2 depending how you like your fit. I’d recommend.
4.0,"I normally wear a 14 and some size 16, so I ordered the extra large. Long story short, it's not meant for my weight! LOL<br />You can go with an XXL but it's more of a bodycon dress. It's more spandex than what I expected."
4.0,It's pretty. The disc is thick and not too small. Thanks.
4.0,"Love this coat. The color is a beautiful pink.<br />I do wish it had more closures though. It fits well, but gaps open between toggles. I had to add snaps to keep them closed."
4.0,Nice picture and quality but I thought it had a nose piece and it doesn't. I have to have that for masks to fit me properly.
4.0,I like these gloves alot.  Their only drawback is the little cap that protects your thumb (the cap that comes on and off as needed) does not stay in place as effectively as the little hat for your other fingers.  I train dogs out in the cold weather and  having gloves like this lets me handle treats without getting frostbite:-)  It would be great if they could tighten up the thumb cap but it still works as is.
4.0,Comfortable fit with moderate support for full-busted women.
4.0,"I loved this neclace, it arrived a silver chain and a black color amulet. The pendent came out in the night and fortunately I found it on my bed itself. So I had to use pliers to tight the pendent ring that holds the thread or chain."
4.0,For a birthday present.
4.0,The balls on these things seem to be very easy to fall off. Could be user error though.
4.0,Nice fit and comfort is nice too.
4.0,I am normally a 6.5 in Womens but my toe rubs the end of this sandal. They’re fairly comfortable and light weight. If you’re in between sizes I would definitely size up.
4.0,"I love this cap, I'm not sure what it is about the material but when it arrived I was sure it was too big, as I've worn it a bit it has confirmed to my head and fits perfectly. I recommend it."
4.0,"Juniors sized, fit as expected."
4.0,"They were a little big on my 3 year old face but he’ll definitely grow into them, not bad for the price. Material is okay, soft"
4.0,"I love these earrings so much. Some people think I'm a poser, others think I'm smart for not ruining my ears. The only negative with these kind of earnings is that the do smell after a few days of wearing them. I feel like they smell worse than when you actually have gaged ears! I have to constantly clean mine with alcohol. --and the black band comes off easily.<br />I didn't know how big these where when I got them. I don't remember the size I said I got but they were definitely bugger than expected.<br />I want to order more. I love them."
4.0,Initially it wasn't comfortable and kept falling off my ear. Once I got it to the correct tension it is a comfortable fit. My husband had no problems.
4.0,The item was exactly as expected. My wife loved it!
4.0,"The product itself wasn’t centered if you looked at it from the underside nothing about it was symmetrical. It did it’s job on the left to take a photo of my son as grogu on Halloween and my husband as the mandilorian. But if you are an extreme collector or a serious Star Wars fan, spend a little more to get  symmetric product."
4.0,"Check your belt when you receive it for the correct size. The black stretch belt is about 8 inches longer then the gray stretch belt both being a size large. Another person wrote back to the seller (W. Schalk on October 25, 2017) with the same issue of questioning the belt size being accurate."
4.0,There are good product for the money.  Easy assembly.  Only had 1 out of the ones I used that wouldn't stay together.
4.0,The pocket already ripped and we've had it for less than a month. As expected when the white one gets dirty it is very noticeable but comes clean in the washer easily.
4.0,"Nice light weight hoodie. I live in tropical climate and can wear this comfortably without getting to warm.<br />I already have the same hoodie and use it for traveling mostly. Its easy to pack and keeps me comfortable on the airplane<br />and in cool temperatures. The hood is great for covering my eyes and taking naps on the plane, bus and airport. Like the<br />long sleeves with thumb hole. Not sure what type of material but it feels like your not wearing a sweater. It's also easy to wash<br />and dries overnight except for hood."
4.0,"Maybe I have a large head or maybe these headbands are supposed to be extremely tight, but it started out way too tight on me. I took it off and stretched it out a little with my hands and after that it felt much better on my head. I recently had my hair cut so now I have hair in my face a lot of the time. This headband really works to keep my hair out of my eyes even when I'm not doing yoga or working out. I use it while cooking, baking, crafting and sewing. The color is just what I expected and I love the coral color. It is sewn well as I can tell by the seams and finishing work. It will last me a long time. This headband is very versatile. I can use it while doing so many things. I can also fold it a little to make it a little thinner and go about town on errands and  other things. It is also super soft and doesn't make me want to scratch or rip it off, like many other headbands I have used before. Overall, I like it and will continue to use it daily! I bought this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all thoughts are my own."
4.0,These suspenders are comfortable against the skin due to the hook and loop system of adjusting the tension of the suspenders. The fabric is soft and comfortable as well. I've only worn a few times now and quite like it but I tend to like to wear it between 2 layers of clothing it's  more comfortable that way but it's still fine wearing it against the skin no problem. I recommend it.<br /><br />Update. These are real comfortable against the skin but I have one major complaint about these suspenders..the plastic gripper clips are rather bulky and as such they tend to irritate my skin after wearing them for a long period of time. I still recommend them but those gripper clips could be improved upon.
4.0,"I bought this fanny pack to use for work. It easily held Pens, work keys, my cell phone and glasses and I still had room. I would buy again."
4.0,"Great dress but runs small , sent back"
4.0,"I got this for my daughter to carry around her sketch books and air supplies.  Too many small crossbody bags can not handle a full notebook, but this one can.  Sturdy construction with reinforced corners."
4.0,"I would definitely recommend this undergarment. I became ill abruptly & lost over 20 lbs. in like 4 to 5 weeks! Most of the weight I lost took my youthful figure. My plump curvaceous butt has virtually disappeared which has really left me despondent about my body! My back side has gone from nice semi big & very noticeable to flat & deflated!! Due to sickness that gripped my body. I’m doing much better now but I have not regained all my weight back. I’m mobile again, dressing like a lady again but need help filling out my clothing. This works perfectly!! It doesn’t look fake & it makes me look well proportioned while I work towards restoration. I will probably buy one or two more to double up under my clothes & because with this particular undergarment there are no lines or seams showing anywhere! It’s worth the money & can be worn seamlessly under dresses, skirts, pants & even leggings! I’m pretty body conscious (or some might say vain…or I used to be) when it comes to my body. I was a gym rat & everything so how my hurt looks is important to me! Trust me this is a good piece of shapewear."
4.0,Shoulders were a little larger than I would have likes. Looked very elegant and super comfy to wear.
4.0,"Super cute, but material a bit heavy"
4.0,"I’ve been looking for some cute safety glasses for awhile. I have a very little vision in one eye. So I really need to always protect my good eye. I think these will work perfectly for protecting the eyes!<br />They are taking me a bit to get used to, as they seem bulkier than what I’m used  to. I normally wear curved snug to the face safety glasses. These seem to sit out farther out than I’m used to. But I think I’ll going to love them in no time. They are comfortable.<br />The side clear eye protective pieces do mess with my peripheral vision a bit. Makes it seem like a foggy area. But again, I’m sure I’ll get used to that in time."
4.0,"I'm excited about using these fun aprons in my new kitchen and the price can't be beat. I don't think they'll be with me forever since the fabric isn't that heavy and the buckles are plastic, but they are a real mood boost for my remodel and an affordable treat."
4.0,"These are my 'stand by' pair in case I lose my other favorite gloves.  The fit is perfect for my small hands.  They are slick and so not good for driving for me.  Also, the nice thing about these is that they do cover the knuckles."
4.0,Super thin material & mesh is obviously light - perfect for an Az spring!
4.0,Ther are pretty confortable. Just as I expected.
4.0,Bit of a snug fit due to the stretch of the material.  Comfortable.  Longer than I expected.
4.0,I needed replacement gloves for my Santa outfit.  These worked great!  The price was good and they shipped them to me on time for Christmas.
4.0,"I like this, cute color! Bottoms are a little cheeky like a thong. still a great purchase!"
4.0,"I'm 6'0&#34; 170 lbs. I usually order Medium but got a Large here. Fits well, although it has strange proportions compared to most of my other shirts. Sleeves are definitely on the short side, and I don't find the shirt to be particularly &#34;slim fitting&#34; — most of my Levi's &#34;slim fit&#34; flannels and shirts are much narrower in the chest, abdomen, and arms than this shirt. Although on the bright side, the weird fit does make it a bit looser and more comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Despite the fit, I really like the shirt a lot. It's a nice and light material, so it's perfect for wearing in the summer when I usually roll up my sleeves and leave my shirts unbuttoned anyway, so the strange fit and sleeve length issues don't really matter. I also love the wooden buttons and the lining inside. Can't argue with what you get for the price."
4.0,"Love these glasses , I have two pair ,only one problem with both pair , the nose pads come off too easily !"
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of sandals that would be comfortable.  My heels get sore when I stand for long periods of time.  These shoes are very cushiony and lightweight!  They have little holes in the soles so that if you walk in water, it will drain away quickly.  Lots of airflow gets to your feet.  They do not make that flip-flop sound, BUT they do make little suction cup noises when you walk on uncarpeted surfaces.  It isn't really loud, but if it is quiet, people will hear it!  My son likes to laugh at it.  The incline from heel to toe really does give your legs a work-out!  I wore my sandals to an amusement park yesterday and I could feel it in my calves this morning!  My feet didn't hurt at all, which was wonderful!  I would definitely buy these shoes again!"
4.0,"Fits as expected and really flattering.  Material is thin, but expected for the price.  Only thing is that the dress does not come with the thin belt as pictured."
4.0,"amazing underwear. soft. comfortable, great fit, and great quality...the reason i'm giving it only 4 stars is that the picture from the pack i ordered is misleading. i ordered the 6-pack that shows that shows black, grey, and white(2 each). i didn't like the shade of blue. so, i am a bit annoyed that instead of black, grey and white i got ""blue"", grey and white."
4.0,Beautiful but the earring clasp closure caved in
4.0,Product was of good quality just to large for a six year olds face.
4.0,Great fit but missing belt
4.0,"Love it, but the little ring that holds the claps on broke and the clasp came off. I do not like returning things, hardly have time, but I was able to bend it ba k together so it would hold."
4.0,I ordered these before in my size and they were too small. I had to order again and go the next size up. Other than that I like them.
4.0,"Beautiful , sexy and flows. Absolutely gorgeous dress!!! Fit perfect"
4.0,"They are what I ordered, but didn't fit. Never got to wear them"
4.0,If you want to cover up this is the suit for you. Doesn't have much breast support.
4.0,Would look cuter if I had fake/fuller boobs. Cute but weird looking at the same time. But honestly comfortable.
4.0,FABRIC LIGHTER WEIGHT THEN EXPECTED. BUT BECAUSE IT IS POLYESTER AND SPANDEX IT SHOULD BE WARM OF COURSE WITH LAYERS.
4.0,"color was true to the photo  very soft and warm.  ordered z large, which is my normal size, but didnt flare out at bottom, as suggested, next time will try 1 size lager"
4.0,The patches really dont make sense to be on there. They look kinda cool but aren't from the show. And the coat doesnt have pockets which is kinda dumb. Beyond that no complaints
4.0,"Good quality crystals and the metal work around them is very nice. In my set, the clear quartz is bigger than the rose quartz and amethyst which is cool. I only wish the rose Quartz would have come with some more pink color because mine looks like it's bleached from being left in the sun or something. A tip for new crystal owners- don't leave rose Quartz in the sun because it can take away the pink tones."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, of great quality also. Only problem... it's too big for a small size. And too long also, it looks like a mature ladie's dress. I expected it to be more juvenile."
4.0,"I like it but wish it covered my toes, too. Not the best comfort with them out but I like the support they give!"
4.0,"Elementary, but works."
4.0,I thought it was going to have more darker coloring to it. But the way it came and because I'm so pale it just looks like a bunch of bruises all over. Top fit perfectly and I'm a 38ddd but the bottoms have weird bunching. I can totally wear them separately but definitely not together or else it just looks like I've been beaten/jumped
4.0,Somewhat shorter than other tunics
4.0,Very nice tank top. I got an XL and the neck line was a little large though.
4.0,Bags like this more durable and better material in the 90’s cute
4.0,"I picked these up for a Blade Runner themed party and they looked great, even though one of the arms was bent at the hinge, which could have happened in transit. Easy enough to fix and didn't distract from the overall look."
4.0,"My brother asked for size large, and he's not a large guy.  After reading reviews, I was afraid he'd be swamped in a large, so ordered both medium and large to compare, and knew immediately he'd be lost in the large size, so gave him the medium and used the large for another gift.  Hope these sweatshirts don't shrink!"
4.0,I like just right when it rains.
4.0,"They look great, lightweight but dont stsy closed."
4.0,Definitely a teen size. The shirt material isn’t stretchy either. Be weary when drying for shrinkage. Otherwise cute.
4.0,A little small but that's just incentive to lose weight for next winter.
4.0,What I needed for a Halloween costume - just as expected.
4.0,"I love the color and fabric of this shirt. I was worried it would run a little small, but it fit great! I think this can be worn with jeans or dressed up for a more business casual look. I love that this comes in so many different colors from your basic colors to fun and vibrant colors.  My husband loves all of these and we have several different colors.  We have had no issues with washing them or them holding up.<br /><br />There is no price listed at this time on Amazon, but the tag on the shirt does say over $100.  I would not pay over $100 for a shirt, but otherwise these are perfect."
4.0,Same as pic nice
4.0,I was super excited to get this dress. Different from what I've been buying the last few years after putting on weight. I wasn't disappointed! So pretty! The midnight blue & red were perfect together! The summer temps were in the 80's so the light fabric was a great plus.  But was so sad when I put it on.  Too short & low cut. Really wanted it to fit so I could keep it! I thought a XL would be ok on me.... but nope. So its going back. It really is pretty though. And for a great price.
4.0,"The hats had the look and theme I was going for, and looked good once assembled. However, I hadn’t realized you have to put the hats together and stickers on yourself, which is a little tedious."
4.0,Nice product and a good price
4.0,"White earing arrived broken. The earing was not attacjed to thr post. Trying to figure out how to get that piece replaced without returning both pieces as the blue is functional.<br /><br />Update, they were quick to respond and sent a replacement."
4.0,"Nice coat, fit well except in the shoulders. Nice color. Suitable for cooler days but not winter. Washed well per instructions."
4.0,I have a round wide head and have always had a hard time finding glasses that fit properly.  I did some research and figured I would give these a try.  They are large so they are wide enough for me.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars it Im not a fan of the color combination.  I wanted black but they were almost $100 more expensive.
4.0,"I bought these to wear in a Mardi Gras parade, and I think they will work great.  The cotton is thin, but sturdy; the snap is a little sketchy.  You basically have to pop the snaps off, since you are wearing the glove.  I don't know how the cotton around the snap will hold up.  I will update after the parades.  The sizing is right on, these are snug but not tight.  They look great, with the three seams on the back of the hand.  I like how the gauntlet covers my wrist to keep me a little more comfortable.  I would have given them 5 stars, but for the snap."
4.0,"Authentic Nike t-shirt with tags. Exactly as shown. Quality, medium weight fabric. Regular fit."
4.0,"Kind of see through , but I love it regardless. Very cute and form fitting. Fabric is nice and soft."
4.0,Buen modelo
4.0,Purchased to help me see while driving at night.  The glasses do the job.  I can actually see the white lines in front of me now.  I have not been driving at night with rain yet.  I will re-rate after I have done this.  They will  definitely get 5 stars if I can see then.
4.0,way longer than the description says
4.0,"I love the look, the lightweight feel and color (true red). It does fit tight so for ease of taking on/off, be sure to order next larger size. I usually wear Xl but am glad I ordered 2XL for this.  There is no stretch and does wrinkle easily. I just hang up outside after use."
4.0,Son loves these for baseball
4.0,"appeared to be cheap quality when I first opened the package. The fabric is thin... BUT this jacket is surprisingly warm in cold off shore winds.<br />The pockets are deep which secures items from falling out. I really like it despite how skeptical I was upon opening the package.<br /><br />Only 4 stars however, because nearly an extra 15$ is a lot for the extra chest pocket compared to their standard jacket without the chest pocket."
4.0,Was for a costume party but fit so well I'll probably wear them to church ( in winter).
4.0,I really love the look of this coat! I only gave it 4 stars because it fits small. I and a lx in everything I buy and this didn't fit well.  I ended up wearing it anyways and just left to top buckle. It still looked nice. FYI:  If you are on the bigger side (over 160lb) the lx might not fit.
4.0,"Great watch, works just like I knew it would. only thing I don`t like about it is the numbers are to small for me. But I need glasses anyway."
4.0,"This is a great style swimsuit to hide the mommy tummy! I ordered based on reviews. I am 5'3'' and 145 lbs, size 34B, normally wear a size 6, 7 or 8 in jeans. Ordered a Large based on reviews (for sizes 6-8). When it arrived it fit fine and was please, but thought I'd order the size smaller (Medium) just to see and glad I did. The Medium fit way more nicely to my body type. Although, I bought because I thought it would have some tummy control which is doesn't. The bottoms are very high waisted though. The top frills definitely hide any pudge you may have so it's still worth the purchase. Great quality material."
4.0,"I was looking a good teacher bag. Fits my laptop, gradebook and accodian file. Can just squeeze in a lunch and small water bottle"
4.0,"Offers little to no protection if you wait 15 seconds and wipe your glasses like the directions say. But, if you let it dry completely it works really well. That leaves spotting but not too bad. I'm still experimenting with how much or when I can wipe this and still get good protection. Overall, though, I'd say it works as well as anything else I've tried, and the small bottle is handy for keeping in the car and using before I have to go in somewhere wearing my mask."
4.0,Good price for 3. About the quality you would get from a local hair store. Kinda stiff but functional.
4.0,I get so many compliments when I wear this! It is thick and keeps cold and wind out and it is a fun mask to wear. It is not however comfortable mostly because of the battery pack inside of the mask but also the material against your mouth/face is a mesh and it bunches up. I’m still glad I got it though. 🙂
4.0,"I received my watch and in a good  pack excited,can  not  wait to show  it off .I will  definitely order for  another for a gift."
4.0,"In general, I'm pleased. A few things you as a buyer should know. I'm a slender size 8. The size chart showed an 8 - 1O as a medium.  It's a snug fit. Knowing what I know now, I'd order a large. Also, it's a bit more sheer than I'd expected. Big plus was that it arrived much sooner than promised."
4.0,Tight through the bust
4.0,"Fits well, very lightweight and the optional mesh cover is great to have in hot areas. I didn't buy this for waterproof claims but when I've used it for the rain it tends to absorb water. On the otherhand it dries itself out very fast without any dampness. Good buy for the price as an occasional use hat."
4.0,"I got a small, because I wanted it to be tight I'm a 34C & its a little big but other then that I got sooooo many complements on it I love the shirt!"
4.0,Great dress...
4.0,"These pants are polyester with 5% spandex. The fit is actually nice, these keep your legs warm. These wre long on me at 5'2 by about 4 inches. I can make them work. I like them but I wouldnt buy another pair at the price, 2being in the south, they wouldnt be year round wear.<br />Purchased green to wear with a mardi gra top in large."
4.0,Very pretty!! A little smaller than they look on line but very pretty! You
4.0,Love it looks great will be buying more
4.0,All of my daughter ballet clothes fit in the bag just fine
4.0,"They fit fine and came sooner than expected. However, after one day of wearing them they already have snags all over them."
4.0,"I've had this ring for several months and wear it weekly.  I've had no issues with this ring at all and it looks like new.  It is a bit taller than I thought it would be, meaning it takes up quite a bit of room between the middle joint and the lower knuckle.  This can now be seen in the pictures included in other people's reviews.  In the seller's pictures, it's extremely difficult to tell that this ring is a closed circle.  I didn't expect the tip of the dragon's tail to be attached to the its body, which means it is not adjustable.  That said, it does fit well, it's holding up well, and I'm still satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,Almost 5 stars.. Im a smidge too big in the thighs so they get pulled down here and there. But I love them! So soft and warm and they make my butt look good. I'm 5'4. 162 pounds.
4.0,Fabric is kind of scratchy. A little snug in the shoulders and if you want to cover tummy don't raise your arms.
4.0,These leggings are super cute. They are highwasted but the do not have tummy control as it states in the description. They fit true to size!
4.0,"These are very cute socks, just as pictured. After one wash in cold water and dry on medium heat, they shrunk to one size smaller."
4.0,"This top is very sexy! I love the color! I ordered a medium and it fits nice; however I could maybe have gone with a large as I like my tops to be a little less form fitting. The material is soft and it is flowy in most areas. The only thing I didn't like is that the lace is a bit stiff and kind of bunches up a bit, so it's  not as flawless looking on me as the model, but overall very comfy and soft.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"IT LOOKED LARGER IN THE PICTURES, BUT IT IS CUTE.  GOT A LONGER CHAIN.  IT WILL WORK."
4.0,"It is a tad large for me but it is a Large/X-Large size so I'm not disappointed. Better than being too small. Really all around nice hat. I like that I can make it tighter so it won't come off in the wind. And the color is great (I got navy/green). And it's very portable. Mostly I got it for the sun protection, though."
4.0,it is exactly what I was looking for....
4.0,"I love this dress! Such a great find. I ordered a small- I’m 5’3”, 130lbs and have 32DD bust! The dress is very flattering and fits well. The color is great and material is good quality. The only thing for me is that the straps are a little big for me so I am having them altered. Straps are not adjustable. Not a big deal, I just need them to be smaller for my fit. Over all such a wonderful dress."
4.0,"This robe is cute, but the flannel is not a thick kind of flannel, so if you are counting on this robe to really warm you up like a fleece or thick cotton robe, this robe won't do it.  For a little bit of added warmth it is fine though."
4.0,Very good quality robe nicely priced. Washed up well. Nice and soft and sexily translucent. Would be nice if belt l loops were adjustable.They do ride a bit too high. Definitely worth buying.
4.0,"These earrings are different, the only thing is that the material they are made out of does not feel very durable.- I try to be careful so they do not break"
4.0,Very nice & comfortable. I gave 4 stars because for the short length. I’m 5’11 and although I’m use to my pants not being long enough these are shorter then most. It fits true to size & has a great stretch. It’s a very good product. I’d purchase more if I were short.
4.0,Soft & warm!  Love it.
4.0,Super cute and stylish! The lenses are completely mirror and the frames lay flat on your face.
4.0,The watch is working great and my kid loves it however the band has discolored from wear and now looks. Very discolored and dirty. The watch is still bright pink so the difference is obvious.
4.0,"I was a bit skeptical due to the price tag but in all honesty this saved me from losing my job due to always being late. To me it is absolutely worth the investment. The only problem I have with it is about 2 months in I can already see some wear on metal thingy, other than that absolutely worth it !"
4.0,"The bag is almost perfect. It fits an iPad Mini with room, but not an iPad Air. Getting a Rhodia 5.8""x8.3"" notebook in is awkward, but the slightly narrower Moleskine slides in. The trouble is that the bag's opening is encumbered with the bulk of the strap and zip and this narrows the opening to under 6"". Lastly, the strap needs to be 6-12"" longer for someone nearing 6' tall."
4.0,"My measurements are B/W/H  41/36/46, this dress fits slightly loose on the bust and shoulders due to the stretchy texture of the material. Ensure you buy for your waist as you can always dart in the top part for a perfect fit. The dress looks just like the photo (will upload later). Other than the slight adjust you may have to make for the bust depending on your chest size, this dress is darling, it has a full skirt and gives you a very girly feel."
4.0,These fit great and made my partner feel and look sexier. The visuals on this item are fantastic! ;)<br />Will buy more in additional colors. Would be great if the crotch had an opening.
4.0,Makes me want to lose a few pounds but the fabric is great and seems to keep it all in place!
4.0,Sandals are cute. If you are used to 4&#34; or higher stilletos you won't complaint. Good deal for what I paid.
4.0,This dress fits great! And looks amazing! I can’t wait to wear it out.
4.0,I bought these long thigh highs in particular because I saw that other thigh highs were a hit or miss in length. I wanted them about a quarter over my thigh or so but these go up really high. They go up too high on me but would be perfect for girls maybe 5ft 9 and up. I still like these though but they cinch my thighs too much :/
4.0,Just received the brown leather gold band.  The gold is probably 99% match to the stainless gold watch.  A very slight color difference but really not too noticeable.  The leather seems ok but kind of thin.  It does look nice on the watch though.  We’ll see how long it lasts.
4.0,Kind of flimsy- super cute.
4.0,"I like the way they fit, they are very comfortable. I ware them for swim shorts. I am 62 ."
4.0,"I like the color but the actual lanyard is not as wide as expected, about 1/2 inch wide."
4.0,"I love the beautiful shininess of the silver hut im a little upset over the moonstone. Its pretty but it has no colors of blue and peach, sometimes when i hold it a certain way in the light, i can see i think asmooth peach color as if there. Hard to tell. All in all its a beautiful ring and would buy again.<br />I have to take back what i said about the color of the moonstone. I have recently started using avocado oil and i put it on with my rings on. I was looking at my beautiful new moonstone ring and noticed a peach colored glow! That says alot!"
4.0,So comfortable!  Only problem is the dots are offline along the front seam. Not that terribly noticeable but I'd have marked it a 5 other than for that
4.0,"The dress is gorgeous! Fortunately, I read the reviews ahead of time and read that it ran small, so I ordered two sizes up. Two sizes larger was perfect for the fit I needed - for it to fit nicely, but not too tight or clingy!"
4.0,"cute :) i liked these! wore them to a music fest, and they worked well!"
4.0,"Holy cow, does my kid love these. It's a fight nearly every morning to get my kid into shoes. (&#34;Your teacher told me that you can't go to school if you wear slippers.&#34;) They fit as expected and haven't gotten smelly even with wearing them on his perpetually sweaty man-feet most evenings and every night until 855a when we leave for school. They seem well-made, but I haven't washed them yet."
4.0,Was not as pictured. The neck is trimmed in tan instead of being all animal print. Plus it showed it was a cold shoulder on one side. Extremely disappointed.  Am not sending back as housebound due to Covid.
4.0,good value for price
4.0,I like the variety and how it came with a case to hold them.  The rubber decal and plastic backing of these charms are a little lower quality.  Some of the charms have scraggly edges and the plastic backing is significantly thinner than what I'm use to seeing.  I remove the charms from my crocs often in order to clean my shoes properly and the thin plastic backing makes me worried that these charms might not be suited for that type of use.  Though since these are holiday themed charms I wouldn't be using them that often anyways.  I still think they were good for the price.
4.0,Awesome even better in person beautiful timepiece
4.0,"These are not wide width!  They are basically like socks with a soft plastic sole.  Because they are so flexible, they are hard to put on, but do manage to go on her little feet.  But reality is she can never walk in them as they are probably close to 1/3&#34; too narrow, her feet hang over on both sides of the sole, so they are just used to keep her feet warm.  She will need something else when she starts walking in the next month or two.<br /><br />I bought the largest size, and I would say it is a 5.5 or a 6 medium width toddler size shoe.  The vamp of the shoe is definitely too slim for a chunky little foot and is probably why it is so hard for me to put them on her feet.  Because the only store that carried wide and extra wide shoes for babies closed, I don't know what size exactly she wears, however she has the same feet as her 2 older brothers and I would guess she is a 4.5 or 5 extra wide.  I would venture to say if I got the size smaller shoe I wouldn't have been able to even get it on her foot as the shoe is made for a medium width foot, not an extra wide one that needs a high vamp.<br /><br />The shoe it's self is nice, but has zero support, and in actuality is probably really only suited for warmth and cuteness."
4.0,I gifted this little purse to a lady who love drinking coffee and loved this a lot.  The only reason I gave it a four stars is because of the size.  I personally would love it a little bigger but otherwise it’s a nice little purse
4.0,Good quality material for the price am impressed with this skirt.
4.0,It was given as a gift and she loved it.  I am very pleased.
4.0,Good value for amount paid
4.0,Tentatively rated  I will update after the first washing.
4.0,Thin material. Even though its thin my son still loves them.
4.0,"These are really cute. I was afraid the embroidery would bother me on the shirt, but it didn't. My only downside is I usually fit well in a large size and they fit almost like a medium. Hoping they don't shrink at all."
4.0,I read many reviews on this dress saying to order a size up. I ordered a medium but normally wear a small. Really wish I didnt. The dress is super cute and the material is good. Although the dress was definitely too big.
4.0,Love this shirt! I went by the size chart and ordered and xl. Arm holes hang down a little low but I can deal with that. I probably could if ordered a large and been okay.
4.0,"The material is nice and it’s very comfortable, but this is not the best dress for women with more cushion in the waist area. The material is somewhat thin, kind of like wearing a stretchy, flowing T-shirt. So it isn’t forgiving of a little belly bulge. The seam going right across the widest part/midsection just accentuates your gut. If you’re more of a rounded woman, avoid this one."
4.0,"It’s a great fit for my 3 year old, just a little narrow in back area. It will do for gymnastics though. Color is nice and washes well."
4.0,"Overall, I really like this dress. It was a bit large, but after washing it on gentle and air-drying it, it still shrunk some and is now a bit small, sigh. When I first tried it on, there was some minor gapping at the bust, but then I realized it had two buttons on the INSIDE which eliminated the problem. I got the dress in another pattern, and it DOES NOT have the buttons on the inside. I wish they didn't ship it in such a small plastic bag so it wasn't so wrinkled upon arrival. Really cute, though, I've gotten lots of compliments and dtill intend to buy it in other patterns."
4.0,"these run somewhat small, I would say a size smaller so order up one size.  They feel fabulously and wash up nicely.  I would not really call these compression but I like them.  Nice little summer tops for vacation and yard work and stuff.  Do not dry in dryer, always hang dry."
4.0,Shirt is made with quality material. I would size up from what you typically wear.
4.0,"Good sunglasses for the price.  Not real heavy duty or high quality frames, so I didn't go 5 stars, but then they didn't cost very much either.  Got them for my daughter and she loves them.  Glass states that it has UV protection so I'm glad to see her wear something to protect her eyes.  Had to tweak the nose pieces a bit for best fit, but that is normal with any frame you buy."
4.0,"Grandson loved!!! them, no real warm liner, but keep the feet dry"
4.0,Works well make sure to get a bigger size cuz they run small
4.0,"Looks great from a few feet out. Feels cheap, but not too heavy."
4.0,Is very nice just a little difficult to get the clasp open until you to a few times.
4.0,Super cute. Just as pictured. Ordered a 3T for my 2 year old and it fit more like a 2t.
4.0,Great product. Easy to customize to your size. I highly recommend this.
4.0,"I like the shirt, but it makes me look larger than I am so it's great to wear when I'm working from home. Very comfortable"
4.0,"Nice suit, sturdy material"
4.0,It’s actually very spacious inside I could fit my 3ds xl case and all a fidget spinner ear buds my wallet a jar type packet of gum my keys a lipstick 2 feminine products and my cell phone
4.0,"I am about 5'7&#34; so the socks are a bit shorter for me (only slightly above my knees), but the colors are as shown on the picture. :)"
4.0,"This is a fine dress, follow the size description accordingly. The only thing, the coloring of the print is much brighter pink than shown, and the print is not along the bottom of the dress as it is in the picture. After contacting the seller about this, they promptly responded and offered another item of theirs. Overall, I am satisfied."
4.0,Very nice.  Satisfied.
4.0,"ordered several different glasses since my son is legally blind,  needs this kind of glasses,  these are not heavy duty but are a good pair to wear every day,  for the money they are good Good tint. flexible​ sorta thin  Can't beat it for the price if they hold up at all"
4.0,I dig the knit pattern. Feels very fall. Is very warm. Almost a homemade feel to it.
4.0,"I tried this in a large to extra, extra, extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color."
4.0,"I bought a pair of Fossil glasses much like these in 2011 but lost them some years later. They were a clear to gray gradient and looked great. Without paying $180 for a pair of RayBans, these glasses are the closest thing I could find to those fossils and they are very comfortable. The only problem is the screws and nuts that hold the lenses on are wiggle loose as you clean your glasses. Make sure you tighten them regularly."
4.0,These choker necklaces are a little thin but good variety
4.0,I bought these shoes a size up thinking they come small living in the US but they fit to size.
4.0,"Fits well, like the style.  Would have like to have seen the tortoise shell a little more pronounced on the side as the picture would indicate.  Happy with the purchase for the $ spent"
4.0,Pants don't come with set. Rather costly for a set.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:8897cfb2a4c25b3decb94ebfa52b3916]] What I love about this outfit is that it hugs my curves. I’m 172lbs so I wear a large. This is a cute fit for a nice outing 😍 add a cap & you fire 🔥 boo.<br />What I didn’t like are the sleeves. They were kinda short so I had to improvise with the Apple Watch. But overall this is a must have in the collection 😉
4.0,"Wish that it had been 6 inches longer. However, it is a nice, warm, and cozy scarf."
4.0,A little too flimsy for my liking but they were cheap so it's not really a big deal. The mirrored lens does scratch easily but they came with little bags so that helps a lot. If you have issues with your eyelashes touching the lens of your glasses then these will work for you. My favorite thing about them actually. These glasses are super cute and comfy and I would definitely buy again
4.0,"I have ordered a number of pairs of these pants, and LOVE them. This final order was disappointing because I did not receive the correct item. Very unhappy to have spent money on an item I can't wear."
4.0,the hat still fits but I was sent the wrong size. I ordered the regular fit and received the large fit
4.0,"I am normally a size Medium, but I purchased a Large based on the reviews to size up. A tad big in the waist, but overall super happy with this skirt!"
4.0,This long-sleeve shirt has a cool leopard print on sleeve and pocket. It's a comfortable fit with a round neck.<br />I like that it's a lil stretchy and the material doesn't make me hot when I'm moving about.  I also like the length of the shirt which is long enough that it doesn't ride up on me in the winter.
4.0,"So I'm a woman and I am normally a medium/large in women's clothing and I got the medium and it's very big. That being said, I've worn this every day since I got it and would trade my human skin for the sweatshirt material to be attached to my body so I never would have to take it off."
4.0,I bought this mask for a company holiday masquerade party. It is very pretty. I only gave it 4 stars because I felt the tie strings are positioned a little too low which made it difficult to keep the mask in place. I will probably replace with elastic in case I need to use it again.
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but the stone in the owl pendant was scratched and the bracelet clasp doesn’t stay fastened. Love the overall look and it was perfect for one night of wear.
4.0,They are extremely cute and comfortable! I will be ordering other colors!
4.0,"Overall this cosplay is quite good! The fabric of the bodysuit, gloves and belt are great quality. The boot covers aren't great and the bodysuit is a bit baggy in some areas, plus the ribbon on the tail comes off super easily, but other than that it's a good cosplay!"
4.0,"Overall I'm a super happy with these leggings. Did my workout today in them and they held up well. Super thick and and stretchy, no issues with you booty showing through when you bend over during deadlifts or squats.<br />Only sad part is they are super short if you are a tall girl these will be highwaters. I'm 5'8&#34; and athletic build (meaning I have leg muscles and booty) and they ride about halfway between my ankle and calf.<br />Will order other styles because I think they are a great product."
4.0,I love the length and look but the elastic in the waist I a little uncomfortable. Material is nice and like the pockets.
4.0,"Looks cute, but pinches at the waist if you aren't proportioned exactly as they expect you to be."
4.0,"Very cute.  I received lots of compliments.  However, the lining at the V collar flips up constantly.  I will need to take it to the tailor.  Fits a little loose.  I ordered the 4/6 and still roomy (I'm 5'1&#34;, 34-27-34, 118 lb.)"
4.0,I wear this to walk my dogs and it keeps my head warm. Good for small heads. Good quality.
4.0,Overall good material. A little see through though.
4.0,"I really like this blazer and that surprises me since I didn't think I would.  Women's blazers rarely fit me very well and this one fits me very nicely.  I love the pre-rolled up sleeves (I have very long arms and most blazer sleeves are far too short), and the light-weight makes it good to wear even on summer evenings.  It will go great with skirts, pants and blue jeans.  I haven't washed it yet but since it's made out of polyester I'd bet a paycheck it won't shrink or fade.  It's got some stretch and does not feel binding at all."
4.0,I used to just drape my belts over my closet pole. Then I got one of those belt organizer that puts your belts in a row of slots with the buckles facing out. That always made it a little hard to grabe the right belt without dropping another or causing balance issues. my first ratchet belt was a mission which came with a single hook so I gota few of those but they started to take up too much space and I was limited to only getting mission belts since they use a slightly wider track. Then I found this organizer and I love it. It put your belts in a nice sleek row with slim design which makes it easy to see and grab your belts. You can also use it for other ratchet belts. I use mine with Marino belts and it fit my mission belts too.
4.0,Straight pegged leg with angle seam.
4.0,Can't see what my eyes see I love them
4.0,I hardly see anything in these sunglasses. But they are comfortable to wear.
4.0,My daughter was happy to receive the hoodie.  One for Christmas and on for her birthday.
4.0,"Kind of smaller than expected, but still very pretty."
4.0,"It’s a little smaller than I expected, but fits and is soft and light."
4.0,"I love this!!!! It fits great, just a little bigger than id like. But this is really pretty and can be worn dressy or casual! It's perfect. &#60;3"
4.0,Nice enough. Cute. A little on the bigger side than based on the size chart. Could have ordered medium but worried might be tight.
4.0,"I had this same bag about 5 years ago and if finally gave out.  I searched everywhere to buy this specific bag again as it fits perfectly in overheads on most airlines. I travel on more than 100 flights per year and have so for the past 10 years so carry on is very important to me along with quality.  I do agree that this updated version is not made as well as the older version.  Im finding with my other swissgear items once the name Wenger was added to the logo, the quality did go down.  The zippers are not as high quality or as smooth as they use to be and the wheels seem lower quality also.  The bottom pocket getting scuffed and holes in it I did encounter with my first one so I bought a tiny roll up nylon duffle bag and folded into and placed it in that pocket.  It not only added support and kept those scuffs from being as bad, it gives me an additional quick bag that takes up no space at all just in case I need to bring back more than I took with me.  I would continue to buy this bag over and over as long as the quality does not go down any lower than it has.  My bags take a lot wear day to day so I have to wonder about those who say it fell apart quickly how the bag was being treated from the start.  If it were checked luggage for 50+ flights I would agree it would not last as long but also consider the price.  This is an $80 bag that will do you just fine as a carry on bag and last for years.  One should not expect $300 quality at an $80 price."
4.0,"Very nice, i like it"
4.0,"was purchased as a gift and enjoyed very much!  Fast service, as promised"
4.0,I wear a large but I had to return and order an XL
4.0,A size too much
4.0,"It’s a little shorter in the back then I would’ve liked, but over all I love it. Looks really good from the front. The material is soft and light weight. Love the colors. Very good quality."
4.0,"This is a very nice British-style cap in a black rib knit, sewn brim, and contrasting herringbone interior that is soft and smooth.  The design is a good one as it doesn't have too high a rise, sitting flatter against the head, and the seams and stitching are nice and tight, pulling the knit fabric together in the back in a smooth, flush whole.  The brim is sewn to the body of the cap, not separate or snapped.<br /><br />The interior lining is in a soft wool blend, black/white herringbone, and is soft and feels great.  Really nice!  The label is a printed poly and can be cut out if desired.  Again, the stitching is straight and true, no flaws or loose threads, no crooked seams or bulky bar tacks.<br /><br />The only problem (for me) is that it's just too small, even at size L.  Perhaps my head is unusually large but this is not an adjustable cap; there is zero stretch, not extra fabric with adjustable snaps or buttons, nada.  So, if it doesn't fit, you won't get it to fit unless you modify it -- a possibility but not ideal.  If you have a large-sized head, this may not be the best choice.  If you're average sized, I highly recommend it as the quality appears to be first-rate at this price point.<br /><br />Nicely done, just a tad small."
4.0,fits on my bigger suitcase and definitely stands out.  should be easy to find at the airport.
4.0,Love them! Nice and light
4.0,I love them but I did not know you could see right through them
4.0,It fit a little larger than I wanted but I'm going to get it altered.  Overall it was a very pretty dress. Looking forward to wearing it once Its altered.
4.0,"they were good at first then after a while they were just okay, they are worth their value so i’d say for the price they are quite good, i’d buy them again just maybe not in the navy."
4.0,"These pants look awesome and stylish. However when it comes to accurate waist sizes, these shorts felt smaller than the original size. I am a 32 waist and these felt like 30. You would have to probably order a size 33 or 34 to feel comfortably."
4.0,"These are actually great for everyday wear - the legs are not riding up at all. They are the soft and smooth feel typical of micro modal. There is not a lot of room or support in the groin area, but it's not at all unconformable. The David Archy briefs and MeUndies are both thicker and I think a bit nicer and shaped a bit better, but these are still really comfy.<br /><br />I knocked off a star for the tag, however. Why - Why? After about an hour of enduring the feel of it right above the intergluteal cleft, I pulled out a seam ripper and removed it. There is no place scratchy tags anymore in modern clothing."
4.0,"The ""white/milk/yellow"" colored band is very nice and looks much more expensive than the cost. It goes with everything and is easily dressed up or down. Because it's resin, it is much lighter than ceramic would be but still looks sturdy and not at all cheap. I highly recommend this band.<br /><br />I took off one star because the regular release pins that attach the band to the watch were just slightly too long and couldn't be used. I had to use pins from a different watch band to attach this band to my watch, even though the description listed my watch type as compatible. If I hadn't had extra pins, I likely would have needed to return this band."
4.0,"The top is super cute! The cut is a little weird though; especially in the busy area. If the straps were adjustable, it would definitely take care of the cut. Overall, it’s a cute top."
4.0,Way too big for a newborns head. My baby is not born yet but I can just tell. I tried to untie one and retie it smaller and I messed it up lol. I am probably just going to fold and put two stitches in the back on them when baby is born so they fit and then as she grows I can remove the stitches. For the money they are very pretty and soft and cute. But you may have to make adjustments if you want them to fit on baby and not toddler.
4.0,Its like exactly whatz shown in the photo but its a little loose on my head the zipper fixes it a little bit and i would recommend this mask to anyone.
4.0,"These plugs are pretty great.  The flare on them is the right size that they're not really difficult and painful to get in and out of your ears, but they don't fall out, either.  Because they're open, they keep your ears aired out and you don't have a ton of gross-smelling build up.  Since they're small, you can't really see a design from them unless you're fairly close.  The reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 was that in the picture, the finish looks matte and dark gray.  The actual plugs are very dark black and shiny.  I was kind of disappointed in that.  I like the picture better."
4.0,"Great price and worked perfectly. I polished my Pandora bracelet and it sparkles now, so happy with this purchase! Great size and you cant beat that price. Sent link of the product to several friends!"
4.0,These leggings have great stretch.<br />These are more work out type leggings and they seem thick which is good. I feel like you can wear these year around.<br />They are that shiny are by workout pants material not a cotton type of soft material.<br /><br />I would imagine they are easy wash and wear.<br />They are nice and go up higher around the waist so they are great with a crop top.
4.0,"Roomy and pockets on front and sides give plenty of separation options.  Well made, good quality."
4.0,"exactly as expected, nothing fancy (which I like) fits well."
4.0,"This item arrived on time and in perfect condition. The material was of good quality and the patterns looked just like they did in the picture online. The zipper worked and easily opened and closed. The zipper does have material behind it however so if it is pulled down there is no skin showing, only fabric.<br /><br />The only issue we experienced with this bikini is that the orange palm trees and orange zipper of the swimsuit shown online was not depicted accurately. These orange parts of the bikini in the online photo look like a soft, lighter, almost peach or pink tone orange but the actual orange on the bikini and zipper is a very vibrant saturated shade of orange that I would compare to prison jumpsuit orange.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  Top fits as expected<br />  Top can fit a range of bust sizes<br />  Good quality fabric<br />  Comfortable fit<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Website inaccurately depicted colors<br /><br />Overall we thought this was a very cute swimsuit and kept it regardless of the color difference as it had a nice fit, cute design and was very reasonably priced."
4.0,Liked the style disappointed the strap was black an grey I thought it was white but still like it
4.0,Very soft material but got stained so easily and could get it out.
4.0,great yoga pant
4.0,"This Item is very comfortable, but I should have ordered a size smaller, but overall I love it."
4.0,I use this for lounging around my house; it's very comfortable. I gave it 4 stars because it feels a bit thinner than a similar Russell sweatshirt I got a few years earlier.
4.0,my husband loves these because they are solid rubber and he can use them when hes doing the animals with out them staying wet for long and leaving blisters he also has wide feet and they fit the best out of all other brands
4.0,"Thicker fabric and a well constructed design makes this very easy to wear without needing layering up underneath to avoid too much reveal or... I'm 5'6&#34; size 10/12/large and very athletic bodybuilder posture build with shorter legs. The dress hits me 5 inches above the center of the kneecap a bit too short for my taste but I'd still wear it. The construction is better than average for this price range and the dress has give in it for easy mobility while wearing. If it were 3 to 6 inches longer I'd order more. It's very, very far from my usual biker rocker NYC street style chick style but a dress at this price is a good experiment. My kids and guests in their 20's, did not like it at all but it does fit and flatter my athletic figure very well. The dress would travel well, impossible to wrinkle it, wipes clean if need be, hides a few possibilities and versatile enough for office or dressy event depending on how you style it with shoes and accessories. It's hard to find dresses that flatter the very athletic female body, this one does and would seem to flatter most with the color blocking design- but if it were knee length to just below the knee this dress would go from average cute to smoking hot."
4.0,"Cozy hat, warm and thick. A bit too thick looking for my taste on my big head but it's warm and has a soft material inside so I can't complain, stretches well enough, for $5 it's well worth it and stylish."
4.0,I use these for mowing my lawn and i love that it keeps the bugs out and i can breathe easy through them. Glad i purchased
4.0,I like this necklace but its been broken a lot and I have to keep fixing it.
4.0,Love this and it fits great
4.0,Muy bonito llego a tiempo 😊
4.0,"I love this ink pad set! The colors are pretty and vibrant. I like how they all stack together for easy storage. One of the cases did come completely broken so the pad will likely dry out but that's due to shipping, not the seller or product. It's worth the buy!"
4.0,This is a very cool night shirt but just way too small. I'm a 10-12 and ordered a large it should have fit but I looked and felt like a giant sausage.  It's was too great to return so I gave it to my 14 yr old size 6 daughter and it fits her beautifully.  She loves it.  It's her first choice on laundry day.  She says It keeps her warm but not sweaty.  And I like it on her because she can walk around the house in it and she's fully covered. She wears it on the weekends when she is home all day working on school projects.<br />But seriously the sizing is way off.  A large always works for me sometimes even a medium and my daughter is NEVER a large she is usually a medium (she'stall) and sometimes a small.  A size 6 person is not a large. I was very dissapointed that it didn't fit.  It has everything I was looking for- warmth and coverage while still being hip.  I'm not ready for those old lady flannels yet.<br />It was so small that even the extra large would have been too tight.  It was tight even around the wrists.<br />My husband loves the T-shirts made by this company and the mens sizing is true and the quality is great-I don't know whats going on with the womens line.<br />Dissapointing for me but glad it worked out for my daughter.
4.0,"Definitely get a bigger size then it says. I'm 5'6&#34; 140 pounds and I bought a lArge and it fits perfect. Cute style, love the way it fits on my body. Thin material, already have a tear on the side seam but can stitch up"
4.0,Like the color fits good.
4.0,"I'd wash them before using for this reason.  Otherwise, good price and seem to be holding together well.  No complaints, aside from the fuzz."
4.0,Good fit. Decent tailoring. Nice fabric.
4.0,"Lots of good things about these -- good support, adjustable, well made.  Unfortunately the toe post was really uncomfortable for me; it felt stiff and not in quite the right place.  This is not uncommon for my feet and sandals with toe posts to not work well together.  I tried the SAS Shelly with a toe loop instead of post and found the fit and feel just perfect."
4.0,"Took a bit to break in, but after a week or so they seem to be working."
4.0,"I wore this to a garden wedding and it was perfect.  A few complaints, which, to be honest I should not have for such a low cost dress.  It grew and grew during the day and got very wrinkly.  It fit like a glove when I tried it on and by the end of the wedding it was wrinkled and baggy.  But we were all drinking so only I noticed.  I am an hourglass figure, 5'5&#34; about 145 and usually wear a 6 or 8 depending on the brand.  The medium was what I got and it was perfect until it grew.  I plan to wash it and see if that cures the growing problem"
4.0,I ordered  M.  I usually use S or M size.  But I think this is L or even XL (my chest measurement is 36-37&#34;)
4.0,"Wonder if clasp will hold.  thought it would be lighter, a bit clumsy, but still very nice and great memory after visiting Hawaii where they believe the turtle is a sign of long, happy life!  Satisfied."
4.0,Runs a lot smaller than traditional US sizes.  Ordered a 4x because I wanted a loose oversized fit but this was more like a 2x. Fortunately the shirt fitbut not how I anticipated.
4.0,Face too small
4.0,"Okay cardigan/shrug. It fits nice considering it's for juniors. The color is spot on. However, it's a little thin and very wrinkled."
4.0,Nice I have 3
4.0,"If you’re looking for something oversized then ordered a size up. I ordered Med size snd it fits perfectly, but not at all baggy like I had wanted."
4.0,Bought it for my granddaughter
4.0,Jkknbbbbb
4.0,Pretty nice... but size is wrong
4.0,"Summary<br />Reusable grocery bags with structure and heft. Pro Tip: Bring into the store with you and place items in them according to their type, i.e. all cold in one, all cans and sundries in another, all soft stuff in the next and save one bag for check out. Dump one bag out and use the spare bag to bag and then move to the next so you keep everything organized.<br /><br />  Pros<br />Large and fits a lot<br />Sturdy material that I think will last a long time<br />Support on the bottom so you can hold heavier items<br />There's 5<br /><br />  Cons<br />The bag is almost too big, I wish it was the same height but not as wide<br /><br />  Verdict<br />Great for not using a million plastic bags and polluting and makes life easier if you do it right: BUY"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8f9e91ca372b13cf9c24764de4ffa2ac]] 4-star Edit: Reached out to the seller and they reached back out with in a few hours. They were able to send another one. Waiting for it to arrive now!<br /><br />3 star- So first big thing, if you are short like me, your knees will be on your ankles LOL but that's not the reason for my 3 star. I received it and was super excited to try it on to make sure all was good and there is a whole in the back below the zipper. The stitching is just completely falling apart. Unfortunately this was for work and having a hole on your behind isn't going to fly. Now I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a new one before Halloween :("
4.0,Closest thing to the original that came with the watch... according to a SEIKO Store this is one of the hardest bands to find
4.0,"I love this design, I will buy more in different colors, but probably from a different seller.<br />There is a little too much fabric on top for me, and it’s kind of pricey."
4.0,"The material is awesome, but the size is way off. I usually wear 20/22, so I ordered the 4xpluss(24-26) just to be safe. The dress was still a little tight. Due to time restrictions, I had it altered..length shortened and added a piece on the side.i would suggest ordering 2 to 3 sizes too big."
4.0,"This is one of my favorite bands for the Apple Watch. I've had all the watches since the gen 1, so I've had a lot of bands. There are a ton of repeat styles, but this one, to me, stands out and I like it a lot. The magnets are strong and I've never had it fall off. My only feedback is please offer more colors for the outer appearance, as I would be happy to purchase another or two in different colors. Reversing isn't really an option for me as it leaves the clasps facing outward and looks wrong."
4.0,"These pants are pretty decent for the price. The quality seems decent and it appears they will hold up well though they have yet to go through the wash. My only issue with them is that they're a little long for me at 5' 11&#34;, but they're designed to fit most heights for a given size so that's just how they are. I'd buy another pair assuming they hold up well going forward. 4 stars because they're not top quality, but a good value for price."
4.0,Runs small in the bust and shoulder areas
4.0,"The pants fitted pretty well, expected it to be a bit more loose but it's fine. I asnt that't thrilled about the elastic belt but it's ok I guess. What I was impressed by, is that it actually does pretty good in cold weather. Like in 35 degree weather it felt warm enough, but forget about colder temperatures like 15 degrees or lower."
4.0,"Nice slip, a little pricey."
4.0,"As soon as I took it out of the package the fringe came off but other than that I luv the purse and style, got a few compliments along the way. Thanks"
4.0,Perfect fit. Thin material.
4.0,They fit well.  They size is what they say it is.  They seem durable so far.  They don’t seem to wick moisture as well as my other smartwool socks.
4.0,"A little scratchy/itchy, but cute. Looks a little boxy on me, but it may just be my frame."
4.0,"My son loves the shirt. Perfect to wear under his football gear, but it is definitely small. I know it is a compression shirt, but he could have gotten a Medium and it would prob fit a little better. My son is 13, 5'2&#34;, 120lbs, we ordered a Small."
4.0,"I am officially shocked. 4 stars say i like it, the absence of the 5th says i understand what i have. Nevertheless, it looks good and still works."
4.0,Perfect pool shoes.
4.0,"I love these leggings, they are soo comfortable. I wanted a different design than the one I received."
4.0,I wear this often. It's a simple necklace perfect for summer outfits.
4.0,Nice sparkle
4.0,Very comfortable but the arch support not very high
4.0,Gorgeous purse! It is very small but gets the job done. Only complaint is that the top zipper is starting to unravel because it is sewn on with a plastic thread which is starting to wear down.
4.0,"This dress is just as pictured! The color is beautiful and the material seems nice. The ruffle detail at the bottom hem and on the sleeves are so fun! I'm 5'6"" 120 and ordered a small. Took a star off because it wasn't as form-fitting as I'd like, but the length was perfect."
4.0,They are just what I needed for an upcoming flight!  comfy cozy
4.0,Very nice and bigger than I expected.  I got lots of compliments on this piece
4.0,I love this necklace and try to wear it often.<br />I would have given a 5 star if not for the way the pendant<br />flips when I lean over.<br />It is a beautiful necklace.
4.0,goes very nice with a jumper
4.0,"Good quality, too small for what I wanted but will use it somewhere else."
4.0,"I thought it would be black, it's more like a tarnished black. Otherwise good value for this ring."
4.0,The dress is beautiful. It runs a little big around the arm holes. It may be because my daughter is a little more petite than normal kids. The only concern we have is the lace in the front is see through.
4.0,"Just got mine in, they were a bit larger then I expected them to be which is good. Large enough to see and all that. The plastic seems sturdy enough and doesn't feel flimsy at all"
4.0,I loved them but they started coming apart right after I got them not put together the best unless I just got a bad pair but they are extremely cute and im wearing them until they fall completely apart
4.0,"im a petite woman(5'2&#34; and about 110pds.) so i ordered size small, the quality of the coat was very decent for how low the price was.  but i was so disappointed cuz it did not fit well,  was too big in the shoulder n chest area so needless to say i returned it.  it was very nice coat though!"
4.0,Alot of extra pant around the ankles
4.0,"Perfect for what I need it for, but the light barely works"
4.0,Earrings are perfect size. Gave it four stars because of workmanship. The soddering on one of the hearts is not so great.
4.0,"Very happy with the outfit, the material is cheap and lightweight (as was expected) but that just means it’s extra flouncy. The only thing I was even moderately bummed about was the sleeves were way too small. I’m 150lbs with a very small bust and curvy on the bottom. I typically wear mediums to accommodate for my bottom half but I can usually wear a small for my upper half. Even in a medium, the sleeves couldn’t go an inch past my elbows. If you have any arm muscles in this top, you’re bound to struggle. Luckily enough the sleeves are pretty simple to detach by snipping a few threads. So that’s what I did and it still looks great. All in all, very happy"
4.0,Only one size (8) was available.  I hope I can buy a larger size next time.
4.0,Nice-- little to long  but otherwise great
4.0,"This watch is very unique, triangular in shape. Very heavy watch (6.38 Ounces). All functions are easily set. Remember to wind the watch twice a day. I should have chosen the black or red face because the hands are difficult to see. I chose this watch so that I would not need to pay to have a new battery installed when the battery died."
4.0,Cute I ordered bigger than my regular size.
4.0,"It smelled very thickly of chemicals when it first came out of the package. I wish I'd ordered it a bit smaller bc it doesn't stay &#34;closed&#34;; it spreads out. My 13-year old daughter says it look old-lady-ish but I like it and it's comfortable. I'm 5'7&#34;, and 130 lbs., DDD."
4.0,Very pretty and hearty. The captive ball is a very tight fit and it takes two of us and some pliers to get it in on both earrings.
4.0,"I really love this dress. Very formal, yet comfortable"
4.0,Nive color. Nice bikini. Its not really high waist like it said so keep that in mind
4.0,My six year old picked these out and while she likes the prints they are a bit snug on her face.
4.0,"Runs small like reviews said! I ordered XXL and it just fits! I have not washed it yet, but will definitely hand wash & dry flat ❤️"
4.0,It was so loose on my wrist. I ended up seam ripping it and adjusting to meet my needs.
4.0,"These are great, they fit pretty well, besides being a bit tight in the tummy area, but hey.. who's fault is that really..."
4.0,"It turned out to be a little longer than I expected, but I plan to use it as a gift to someone else.<br />It is still a good product and still recommendable."
4.0,"I'm 5'3"", 175 lbs.  I ordered XL which usually fits but this was a touch big.  I think a L would have worked and been a little more flattering since it wouldn't be so baggy.  I got the Round Flower Navy Blue.  Vibrant colors, more bold than I thought it would be but it's fine.  I like boho anyway.  Will be super cute with boots.  Not too hot or heavy."
4.0,Not sure if these would be good for working out due to them just being cotton. They are so soft and comfortable for everyday wear.
4.0,The lenses arrived clean and defect free. They are a hair different than oem lenses. Something about them affects my vision.
4.0,I love that this top hides your stomach.  Still looking for the perfect bottoms to go with it.  I was looking for top with removable straps and this is pefect.
4.0,"Love em, little bit big for my face but still love em"
4.0,Classy and sexy at the same time....a nice combination
4.0,"Perfect summer dress. Lightweight, cool and flowy material. I am 5'10 and hits me mid knee. I am pear shaped with a small chest and as others have mentioned the chest area runs small. I ordered an extra large worried that the chest would be too big and it was snug. Someone with more up top might find that it gaps. I also worry that about how secure the buttons are so I may need to wear some sort of a full slip underneath just in case. There were a lot of lose threads around the button holes. Overall adorable and comfortable dress. Would love it if they had patterns but definitely worth purchasing another in a different color."
4.0,It looked good and fit well.
4.0,"I do love this shirt; it's a little more fitted than I expected, but it is still one of my favorites."
4.0,"It really is a cute shirt, but runs small. I normally wear a large to an extra large and the T-shirt looks to me like it would fit someone who is a medium to a large. Too bad… Really nice looking shirt"
4.0,This was really big. So it set funny. Maybe I just have a small head idk. I’m a small female. So maybe for a big man? But I still think your head would have to be big to wear this comfortably. It just kept moving around on me and was hard to see out of. It did look really creepy tho which I loved!
4.0,"I like the suit. It is slightly short in the torso area (I have a long torso). The material is nice with rushing in the stomach area that really holds you in and is still comfortable.  It has a white liner on the inside as well, not sure why but you cannot see it. Overall the item is as expected. I ordered a XL and am 5'6, 170, with 38DD"
4.0,"Bit light weight, but I really like wearing it with other bracelets."
4.0,"Excelente reloj por un buen precio, este reloj lo recomiendo más para mujeres o hombres con muñeca delgada, ya que es pequeño , pero no es para niños."
4.0,I like my dress. its a bit tight...so if you have a pouch. it will most def show. I will be sucking my stomach in all night!! nice material. exactly like the picture.
4.0,"These shoes were decent for the price convenience. I was basically looking for some generic shoes that were relatively disposable (price wise) knowing that the kiddo would grow out of them - something of quality between name brand and store brand. These seem to be alright. I would say that the material used feels a little lighter than I expected. Also, the size seemed to be smaller than anticipated (perhaps I didn't measure the foot properly, but I think I did)."
4.0,"Very nice fit, comfortable and easy to do things whole wearing them. Not as warm as I hoped but they're nice."
4.0,Nice color. Well made. Good buckle. My new favorite belt for my jeans
4.0,"Don’t know why description says sexy as nothing sexy about it. But very comfortable, lightweight lounging outfit or pajamas. Material is more a stretchy knit rather than fleece or flannel and bottoms fit a bit like leggings With just enough stretch to be form fitting while still comf. Neck is rather wide and loose. That and crazy description lost it a star from me. 😜<br />Don’t know why picture is sideways. Wanted to show it’s plaid bottoms with matching pocket."
4.0,Terrifying mask! Very good quality! It is very large though wish they had a smaller size for a smaller head
4.0,"The pom beanie is by far one of the cutest beanies I own. I ordered the Lake Blue color and it looks like the picture exactly, the color is vibrant and very eye catching. The beanie is very nicely made up of a thick material that keeps your head nice and warm and is bound to keep up with long term use. The beanie is folded over om the bottom to keep your ears extra toasty during those cold days. The top pom of the beanie is made up of real raccoon fur that is actually really soft. You are able to detach the top pom since there is a snap that connects the 2, but I personally think it looks unfinished without the pom because there is a little hole.There was a slight smell to my hat when I received it, but it went away after a day of it being out of the bag. Overall the beanie is extremely cute and you can wear it pretty much with any type of outfit.<br />I did receive this at a promotional price so I could test and review the product, this review reflects my unbiased opinions and thoughts. They are my own. I do actually test the product and write the review accordingly. It receives the rating it deserves. I hope this assists others in purchasing decisions. I also rely on Amazon reviews when making my own purchases."
4.0,"love the material, fit, and everything but the stitching issue on the tutu.  we will have to try and stitch down for now"
4.0,Love the material. They do run on the small size. I’m 5’8” and they are almost too short.
4.0,"I appreciate how kind and attentive the seller is. The necklaces arrived earlier than expected, but still the seller left a nice note and two little bracelets as an apology for the long shipping process. The necklaces are beautiful, and the only reason I knocked off a star is because they're big. They're not the delicate little sun bursts that we see Tae Gong Shil wearing - they're pretty chunky, which isn't what I was looking for. I got them for my mom and I, so while we will both still wear these, I will keep looking for the right size."
4.0,Good size and solid and comfy.
4.0,My daughter loves this shirt. We recently got a boston terrier and this was a great Christmas gift.
4.0,I got this for my uncles iwatch because he thinks the watch band that comes with his iwatch looks too girlish so I figure this one would be more sporting looking.<br />It's very soft and rubbery and pretty loose. Like the packaging so perfect as a gift to my uncle. He said it was pretty easy to slip it in from the bottom.<br />If you have series 2 that is waterproof this will work perfectly for swimming with your iwatch.
4.0,"good, thought they were bifocal , my bad"
4.0,This dress is beautiful!!! It was everything I wanted! I ordered the dress two sizes up and it fit just right. The sleeves are quarter length not full. If you are heavy topped (large arms and breast) you should be realistic in sizing because there is NO give. The train on the dress is amazing. Definitely worth every dime. It heavy and well sown. I wore it for my engagement photos and it worked better than expected.
4.0,These are gorgeous and they perfectly compliment my engagement ring.
4.0,Its for a gift to someone else but it looks very nice just as shown
4.0,Had to send back and get next size up but then they fit perfect
4.0,Very cute little luggage tag that will help to distinguish your luggage from the others! Seems to be made of a good material that will last a while.
4.0,"Purchased this dress for my daughter for a wedding reception in Indonesia where the guests are requested to wear white (not easy to find short-sleeved casual dresses in white in the middle of winter in Minnesota!) After reading previous reviews, we went up one and two sizes from her normal “large”. One size up, “XL” fit her perfectly, and we were able to return the 2XL for free."
4.0,"I cannot evaluate the antibacterial/antiviral efficacy of these masks and am hoping the manufacturer is being honest. Research does indicate copper effectively kills viruses and bacteria. And let’s be honest, it better than nothing.<br /><br />I wear these everywhere, including intense intense workouts. Yes, they are a little small and do pull up at the chin and down on the nose. The masks are a little stiff and this creates small gaps on the sides. These facts lessen my confidence in the mask’s ability to effectively filter incoming and outgoing air.<br /><br />While working out, it does inhibit breathing to some degree. Sides of the mask move in and out with heavy breathing. This makes me more confident air is being filtered! I like the extra challenge and feel like I’m getting a little more respiratory conditioning.<br /><br />The adjustable elastic ear loops are a little uncomfortable when tight."
4.0,They're pretty good. I thought they were gonna be longer
4.0,Looks amazing along with other accessories. Unfortunately it broke very easily :/ but if you are gentle with it you will have a great accessory for the price.<br /><br />It is very small on my wrist. Just letting people know who see this that it is not a big watch (clearly). Just trying to help! :D
4.0,I was happy with the swimsuit.
4.0,Little big and stuff but overall good quality
4.0,You need this.  gets my gum soles fresh again.  I just wipe on cover with wrap and leave for overnight and my sneakers were brand new.  I also covered and put under my uv light.  will order many more for my large sneaker collection
4.0,Absolutely love it! Very pretty!  Color doesn’t match perfectly but that’s okay! I have a rose gold watch and the color of the band is like a tarnished color! But you can barely tell!
4.0,I ordered a size up and this it’s still very tight. I love the way they are made and look. Just disappointed they are made small
4.0,"This wallet is a good way to keep some of your winnings from going back to the House. I fold my bills once lengthwise, then again in half before pushing them into the wallet. If you are one of the lucky ones to win many times, best to put the larger denomination bills in the wallet rather than fill it up with 5s and 10s. :-)"
4.0,Nice fit. Very comfy. Nice material.
4.0,"The size chart looks like Barbie proportions. So, I sized up two sizes according to the measurements on the size table. But the shirt is way too large. I strongly believe that my regular size would have been the perfect fit. I even ordered the men's size in my usual size because it seemed like that would be my fit option but I wanted the women's shape and I liked how the colorblocking looked better on this women's version. Material seems like the typical performance, lightweight fabric. Looks good. Haven't washed or worn for any extended time yet but it is the same shirt ordered for others in my organization who have worn these for years and had embroidered logos placed on them. They still look great and wear well."
4.0,"This is a very nice dress, the fabric is wonderful and stretchy, with a nice thickness, and the detail is done well. There are two problems. The biggest problem is that though this dress fits me exactly right everywhere else, the waist is about THREE INCHES too high.  Such a pity because it's a beautiful dress, but if I go another size up, the waist and arms will be too big. (I am normally a 16/18, and this is an extra large)<br /> This second but more minor problem is that there is no zipper etc. you just slip it over your head. The gathers along the seam are not incredibly sturdy, so use caution."
4.0,"I don't think I will pay so much for an umbrella again but, you can tell the quality is what you paid for. I gave it as a gift and I'm satisfied so was the recipient."
4.0,It is what you pay for... cute and I gave it to my little grandson who only had a $1.00 to get mommy something.  It was fine for that.  But it will turn green if worn too much or gets wet.
4.0,The material is very cheap but for the price I suppose you can't go wrong.
4.0,"When you pay nearly $80 for an outdoor hat, you expect something special.  Thankfully, that is exactly what you get with the Tilley TWC6 Outback Hat.<br /><br />I did a lot of online research before purchasing this hat.  For an upcoming trip to Africa I primarily needed a wide brim, water resistance, sun protection, and a packable hat.  The attractive olive color with deep tan band was a bonus.<br /><br />My initial reaction was satisfaction with the excellent construction and top quality materials.  There are no obvious compromises with the quality.  For example, I could not find a single loose thread.  The hat looks good and feels good in your hands and on your head.<br /><br />The hat comes with an instruction guide (to indicate care and use tips, how to tell the front from the back, how to apply for repair/replacement, and more).  There is a small pocket built into the inner top of the hat.  Some use it to store money or ID.  I typically use it to tuck the straps into when I'm wearing the hat.<br /><br />The chinstrap is somewhat unique.  It is in two segments.  The rear portion is meant to be worn on the back of your head rather than under your chin.  It is similar to the trooper hats worn in some areas (folks from Maryland, for example, see this style on State Troopers).  Surprisingly, it actually works in light wind, up to strong breezes.  Once the wind really gets going, I switch to the standard &#34;under the chin&#34; part of the strap.  I have not  tried any tests to see how long the back-strap will hold.<br /><br />On the downside, I carefully measured my head before placing an order and I ordered the size recommended by Tilley.  Their web-site makes it clear that their hats are meant to fit loose, so customers should not be surprised when the hats fit relatively loosely.  However, my hat fits like a baseball cap (snug at the widest part of my head, just where my ears meet my head, if that makes sense).  Personally, I like the fit, but I was surprised.  I am very glad I did not order a smaller size as there are no sizing adjustments.<br /><br />I have read some reviews that claim the hat is too hot for high temperature climates.  I will have to see.  My experience is that any hat is too hot once the temperature gets above about 95-degrees F.  At least with the Tilley I can dip it in water and allow it to dry on my head.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great hat for daily wear and I hope it proves its overall usefulness.  Time will tell.  I have no reason to not recommend it.  The only reason I gave it four, instead of five, stars is the surprise snug fit."
4.0,Runs a little smaller that thought
4.0,"Very accurate mechanical watch. I do have to wind it manually before going to bed so it will run all night. It's a beautiful watch but the hands are hard to see at a glance (white and gold hands on a white and gold background). Very quiet watch, too I have had it for a few days now and it hasn't lost or gained a minute, which is remarkable for a mechanical watch in this price range."
4.0,Too fun.  Was a big hit at the bridal shower.
4.0,It’s a great fit and quality!
4.0,Watch was just what I was looking for.  Not a 5 star because despite the size of the watch itself does not include a large band.  Have to use the last hole on the band for it to fit my average sized wrist.
4.0,very comfortable  very cute  low cut just right above butt  they fit well
4.0,These are super thick socks. Wear only in the winter.
4.0,smaller than I thought but still love it tho
4.0,"Very sexy.  I'm glad that I bought it.  I've been into chockers forever, glad to see they're back in style ;)"
4.0,Good! Good quality!!
4.0,"I bought this bag to replace a LeSportsac that had fallen apart in a year's time.  My criteria were that my new bag had to 1) hold my laptop and/or my lunch/gym clothes 2) be durable 3) be affordable 4) be somewhat attractive and versatile.  I settled on this bag because of its many pockets and dimensions, as well as my positive experiences with other HOBO products.  Also, the detachable cross body and shoulder straps were a huge plus.  There's no doubt that this bag is classic, as opposed to ""of the moment.""  But, it is a well thought out bag, and I value that more.  It will be a trusty carry all for any buyer."
4.0,"My sisters and I got these for each other for Christmas. The pendants themselves are nice and shiny, however they are a bit pointy. The words are nicely laser engraved. The chain is adjustable from 17.5 inches to 20 inches and has a rounded lobster claw clasp. I found the necklace not comfortable to sleep in but I will definitely be wearing it in the daytime. I was happy to see that the swear word isn't so prominent that I couldn't wear it around children."
4.0,"Cute pattern, sturdy construction, but maybe a little too tight in the elastic.  On the loosest adjustment it made my ears pretty sore where it went over the cartilage while I was in surgery and couldn't make any adjustments."
4.0,Cozy and stylish
4.0,"I love the top. It is exactly as pictured/described. I did have to return it, though, as the chest was too tight. I would suggest ordering one size up if you're a D/DD, even a large C."
4.0,Was getting this for my daughter for Christmas.  I had looked at other jewelry but didn't like the cheap plastic look. This was metal and we'll made. Everything arrived on time. She loved the jewelry.
4.0,I really like it. Worth the money
4.0,"Super cute, love the multi-level hair spaces in the back, but it's def just a fashion hat and doesn't fit like a functional baseball cap does."
4.0,"Its a nice pants but short and im 5.9&#34;, the top is really short wont wear it"
4.0,"Mine actually had the black tips. They're the perfect size, you could see my eyes even though it's a black glass. I was a little effy about them but I actually love them!"
4.0,larger than expected nice quality
4.0,Looked nice she liked it a lot was a great gift has lasted awhile
4.0,The person I gave this as a gift said it's perfect. The cost was steep I thought
4.0,"I was a little worried at first because I usually wear a size 12 and the Xl says size (8-10). I purchased it anyways because I needed a dress for a wedding. It is a little snug but it fits and it is very flattering. I had to be aware of the dress underneath riding up a little bit, but I feel that may just because it was a little snug on me since I am usually a size 12.  The blue in the pic is darker than the actual dress. Its more of a ""royal blue"" than a ""navy blue"" but it was fine."
4.0,Very cute. Silky material. Was HUGE though so we will have to hold onto it for next year (or maybe even two).
4.0,A birthday gift to my Grand daughter!  She was very pleased with it!!
4.0,"I have only worn these shorts once, and they were very comfortable and fit as expected based on the sizing chart.  I believe they are worth the price.<br /><br />However, for me, I need more padding further up.  I ride a road bike and lean forward for the majority of my ride and the padding in these shorts stopped short of the area needing padding.<br /><br />I believe the placement/size of the padding is very common for women's cycle attire, though.  I don't think it's really a flaw in the design as much as a preference issue.  I believe these will work great for spinning class where I can easily sit up whenever I need to."
4.0,Great kick around shoes for my son who is hard on everything. We shall see how long they last but great value!
4.0,"Fits perfectly, looked nice, be careful it does not snag.  The color is a little darker than pictured and not as shiny"
4.0,I loved this dress. Better quality than I expected. I love the style and everything about it. I order two sizes bigger than what I usually wear because seller suggested it and most reviews said the same thing but it was really big. I ended up ordering the same size I usually wear.
4.0,"Is beatiful, but the color is not  champagne as I expected to be, is golden."
4.0,"I believe the sleeve to be well made. However, the compression is greater than expected so I have reordered the next size. People with short legs may find sleeve too long. Very quick response."
4.0,"I ordered the dress in style G-Black, black top with black and white zigzags on bottom, and size small.<br /><br />I wear size 6 dress, 32D bra, and 28"" waist.<br /><br />The waist was too big. I wanted it to taper in to accentuate my waist. I have the dress with the pink top and zigzag stripes in a size small also. The waist on that dress is great. I posted a picture with the pink dress laying on top of the black one to show the size comparison. Both dresses are marked size small."
4.0,Wore this during my pregnancy. It's a rather large loose fit but it did the trick
4.0,I love the dress. It fits perfectly and the quality is great.
4.0,Excelente calidad. Súper suave
4.0,As advertised although delivery a bit slow
4.0,"Good product, however, I haven't had a need for it yet."
4.0,Nice quality perfect color
4.0,Now all my clothes wont be in one corner of my suitcase when it comes off the conveyer belt.
4.0,A hair larger than expected.  Good quality.  I steamed it and should really have been pressed or irons.  Feel like the steam kept it too poofy.  Pockets were a plus!!!!
4.0,My husband and I have been buying these socks for a few years. Love them especially for travel. Seems we used to get a lot more wear out of them before heal wore through with holes. They would be excellent if heel was reinforced more!
4.0,"Great starting point, revamped the ribbon but used original ribbon flower.  Love the result.  Changing ribbon also loosened the hat so it fit and stayed on.  Thanks!  Happy with transaction and shipping!"
4.0,"Warm, soft, comfortable. Fit well, no slipping. Great for hikes, outdoors, etc. Good quality & well made. Really happy with these!"
4.0,"They are nice, but they are not 16g they are 18g. Other than that they are great worth the money just not gauge correct."
4.0,"Great fit, not very great fabric. It's my first time to buy this brand, I will try it then see how will it be after wearing and washing."
4.0,"Cute socks, bought for a Christmas gift. My grandson will live them, although I am worried about them being to big."
4.0,Bought this for my niece. It was what she wanted. Thanks for having it available!!!
4.0,"fits my needs; not spacious as description states; I fit into it the following items: collapsible 1 liter bottle; stacked snack unit/small; 8oz glass jar; napkin; spoon. It won't fit a lunch box or bento unless it's thin and nothing else is in the bag; it won't close . I keep it because I like the design and the feel. It for light eaters and those whose public transportation commute is long and you have to carry another bag. I am miss efficiency, so this light narrow thing works for me. I really appreciate it's lightness and texture. Keeps stuff in place."
4.0,"Happy with my purchase. My five year son can slip them on and go. Perfect for beach day, hanging by the pool. I'll purchase for both kids next summer."
4.0,It is nice wish it had more colors in them.
4.0,ORDER FOR GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS JUST WHAT HE WANTED
4.0,I love it and it nice to wear under a shirt if you don't feel like wearing a bra
4.0,"Great price, good product.  I was expecting it to hang a little lower in the back."
4.0,kf 95 make in china ok masks
4.0,This earrings are delicate and feminine.  They feel high quality and weightless.  They are a great complement to any outfit.
4.0,It fits a little smaller than expected otherwise a great shirt I wear it to bed and to the gym
4.0,"Cute dress. A bit thin material, but not see through.  5'6 210 and large fit perfect!"
4.0,"I like the design and color and it is also lightweight, however, it fits a bit tighter than I prefer. I would recommend buying a size up. I bought an XL so if I bought again I'd go for the XXL."
4.0,"It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I really do like it.  I didn't realize it was leather (guess i didn't read description very well). But after I got over that, it's good quality and just as pictured.  It looks good with my apple watch to even though it has a rose colored case on it."
4.0,"+Thin yet very warm<br />+Good price<br />+Fits my fashion needs<br />-Fits a little smaller than expected (I ordered a size up)<br />-The red hoodie is much brighter in person compared to the photo<br /><br />Overall, I really like it and may order a couple more in different colors."
4.0,Perfet i love it
4.0,Item runs small didnt fit my 36 DD chest. Pretty though.
4.0,Very cute tee.
4.0,"The material is very nice and I like the design a lot. I was expecting the zippers to be pockets, but they’re just cosmetic, the pants do have actual pockets, though, they’re just a bit shallow. I was expecting them to be a bit longer, but they might just be short on me because I have longer legs, otherwise they fit well, so if you’re shorter, you should be able to order your normal size."
4.0,Cute but runs small and has no give
4.0,Nice sunglasses. Good price!
4.0,Not sure how long lettering will last but it is a nice hat
4.0,I love the super soft fabric. I hadn’t expected the legs to be so wide but they are so comfortable that I didn’t return them just because of that. Great pants for a good price. Wish they were offered in a more trim (bootcut not bellbottom) leg opening.
4.0,Great gift for the price....
4.0,"Great except, could not see out of the eyes in the dark. If I would have had time to modify, it was the perfect mask."
4.0,"Pretty, not sure of the quality."
4.0,"The earrings are quite nice, especially considering the price. My ears typically get discolored quickly from anything other than high quality metals, but they didn’t with these. The backs to the earrings are quite small, but they latch nicely to keep them from falling off without pinching. The stones in them are super sparkly, but in a realistic fashion, not a costume-jewelry sparkle."
4.0,nice material.
4.0,"Great bag for beach or pool easy to clean! light weight and flexible to store anywhere. not five star due to shipping, the handles are mounted by plastic nuts and 3 were missing. found them in the bottom of the box it was shipped in. just about threw them away. PS...dont loose your nuts!"
4.0,"My wife loves it, very luxurious fabric but too thin to wear if company is about."
4.0,Good for a costume but they were way too big for my face. It would probably fit a man though.
4.0,I love the look of the glasses and the polarization is great as well as the bead work. The only disappointment was that they do not fit snug to my face through the arms so they tend to slide down frequently.  I would definately recommend they glasses.
4.0,Great costume piece. Worked great for a wedding I attended.
4.0,"nice pants, but 2 things I didn't love: 1) the slim is VERY slim.  They fit almost like skinny jeans, but that's a bit strange for linen pants.  2) there is no elastic.  That may sound strange, but the waste is actually quite large (particularly compared to the thighs), and I had to use the drawstring to get them to stay up.  However, since there is no elastic, this resulted in odd bunching of the material."
4.0,"It's a cute shirt and the material and quality is very good.  It runs a little big and the strap sometimes falls off but otherwise, a great casual shirt."
4.0,"Not as long as I hoped it would be, but it's great material and a cute simple design and the price was great."
4.0,"If you want it to fit/fit, size up one.  If you want a relaxed fit, size up 2.  Sleeves (on the long sleeve version) aren't proportionate, so skip if you have bulky upper arms.  Fabric is rather thin, but not too thin to wear. It's like a thin t-shirt.  Not bad, if you get your sizing right. Shipping was rather fast."
4.0,"Between old age and cataract  surgery  I really started having trouble  driving at night with the bright lights on the new cars.  These glasses have changed everything and I love them.  I drive a lot of back roads and even when there are no oncoming cars, I can see fine (unlike another pair I tried).  They are a little funky in the fit, in that the lens seems a bit close for my liking.  But it's not enough to be a deal breaker.  If you have trouble driving at night - get them, you'll not be sorry."
4.0,Pros:<br /> Pockets<br />Perfect length<br />Soft<br />Color as described<br /><br />Cons:<br />See through
4.0,I loved the way these shoes looked and thought they would be a great neutral for work. I ordered 8.5 since that’s what I wear in every type of shoe and they were so big I could not even keep them on my feet so unfortunately I had to return them. I would recommend sizing down a half to a full size.
4.0,"Good quality at a reasonable price. They are comfortable, lightweight and great for hikes in the summer."
4.0,"I am keeping these. They are nice but pricey. Being short, the waist hits me higher than I would prefer, and I will have to have them hemmed but that's the price I pay for being short!<br />I may see if someone can cut a few inches off the waist to make them hit a few inches below my belly button. The way the waist is sewn together makes the waist lay flat which is great, so a seamstress may not be able to replicate the way way they are made."
4.0,"I’m 5’ 116# and ordered small.  They were a little bit too small.  I wear small in all undies. They fit, just a little snug around legs .  Cute and well made."
4.0,i was disappointed that there was no option for selecting a width
4.0,"The fabric is a little thin and the folds could be better stitched, but it is a cute style. The polka dots are not at all over whelming in navy."
4.0,Sort shirt. Glad im wearing it under things. Would not work with an open sweater... belly would show. But very cute as undershirt. Versatile.
4.0,"It's a good mask, only complaint is that it's a little tight for me. The quality is great and very well made."
4.0,I bought this jacket on Amazon because of the way it fits the model in the picture. I am glad to say that it fit me perfectly also. This is definitely a good buy. Lovely jacket!
4.0,"Love the pattern and fabric!  Bottoms were a little short in crotch depth, otherwise good."
4.0,COOL LOVE IT
4.0,"These dresses definitely run small and short. If you’re expecting that, it’s a wonderful dress! I bought them for my daughters to wear as tunics with leggings and a cardigan, and the dresses fit the bill nicely. They hit a few inches above the knee on both of my girls. My 7-year-old is 49”, and she usually wears a 7-8 in dresses and a 6-7 in pants. The 9-10 fit her perfectly. My 3-year-old is 42”, and she usually wears a 4-5 in dresses. The 5-6 worked well for her."
4.0,The reflector part is on the inside too and that can be a little distracting I guess.
4.0,Super neat
4.0,"The band is pretty nice and looks great with my Samsung Gear S3 Frontier. Only complaint I have is now I cant take the band on and off because the quick release pin broke, the part you slide over fell out and it's so small I don't know where it went. I tried to take it off and put a scratch in my brand new watch (4 days old). So now tomorrow im going to take it by the watch place and have them remove the band. Don't know what to do now? Otherwise the band looks great and is very comfortable. My wrist is 7 1/2 inches and the band has plenty of room for a bigger wrist. Very smooth and feels well made......Other than the pins!"
4.0,This top is really cute but not very soft. It fit as expected and has a baggy feel to it. I wish the fabric was a little softer. I’m 5’6” and ordered medium which is my usual size.
4.0,Love them and they are so cute just slightly thinner then I expected
4.0,Nice looking 👌 as described
4.0,"What I love about this dress is that the arms fit really well and that the color is a really warm yellow that does not wash out a blonde!  You ladies know what I am talking about!  I was really fearful, because the picture has a beautiful gal with darker tones but I took a chance and it makes be feel warm!  That being said I have not really got the angles just right on this one yet!  You have to pull that shoulder just right and you only get a little bit of a peeker!  But the good thing is for a bustier gal like myself I can still wear a bra to keep the gals up!  So that makes me happy!  the ruching in the front is a little weak could use a little elastic.  The pleats in the full cover shoulder are nice.  The backside in not too forgiving might want to wear some spanx if that is your thang??? Overall it is a fun little dress, makes ya wanna shimmy a little!!!I am 5'10, 155-160, and 34D, I have a belly and booty!"
4.0,"After reading the other reviews I was nervous that these would be too small - I have larger hands for a lady and plan to layer them over armwarmers. Well, the cuff is a little tight around the wrist, but my hands DO fit comfortably in the mitten. I expect they'll stretch more as I use them. I deducted a star for the sizing as well as my feeling these won't last long... the outer knit layer seems loose/flimsy, especially since I bought these to replace a pair that got shredded on my keys after several years of use. But they are exactly as pictured and very soft.<br /><br />I waited to leave a review until I could &#34;test drive&#34; them in truly brutal Wisconsin winter weather. Yesterday we had a wind chill of -10 and I'm happy to say they did the job. I could tell it was cold but after 30+ minutes outside I could still feel my fingers! The fleece inner layer keeps most of the wind out."
4.0,Look ok
4.0,Loved the color and the material great bikini
4.0,Cute 3-piece but the bikini bottom is not crocodile print. The bikini bottom is basic black.
4.0,"Good material, soft and comfortable. It did shrink a bit in dryer so beware. Love this colour!"
4.0,Bought as a gift. Recipient seemed happy with the quality. I can not state whether it works well or not because I am not the user and the recipient lives out of state.
4.0,"The dress is very cute, but it is a bit too big for its size.  I bought a size 6 for my 7 year old daughter, and it's big on her.  She is pretty thin, so I would recommend it for a chubbier girl."
4.0,"I bought for my mom, but as most of the customers stated the legs were too long which made the feet not fit.  Otherwise she loved it and said it was very warm.  Great for these colds days on the Eastcoast.  This is why I give it a 4 star."
4.0,"It was a little big, like as thick as a real ring.  Wanted something a little slimmer since my job involves my hands and lifting.  The carbon fiber pieces kept coming off of mine."
4.0,"I prefer this style silicone band (with the ventilation holes), as it helps keep the skin under the band from feeling as clammy and sweaty.  I've never tried the Apple version of this band, so I can't comment on how similar it is, but it seems to be well made.<br /><br />My first concern is that it's a bit hard to get on.  Maybe ""hard"" isn't the right word, but I'm worried I'm going to break it (or it's going to somehow pull out of the watch case) when trying to stretch it to fit over my hand.  This may be completely unfounded, time will tell.<br /><br />My second concern is sizing, not so much for me but for others.  Using Apple's sizing tool, I'm right in the middle of a size 8, and my watch is the smaller one (40mm), so I ordered the band size M.  It fits my wrist just about perfectly (I'd say it's ALMOST loose, but not quite).  Problem is, according to the chart, this is also the size to order for someone who measures as a size 7 (with a 38/40mm watch), and I'm pretty sure it would be too loose for this person.<br /><br />I'm sure this is to keep costs down... it's a lot easier to manufacturer, distribute, and stock 6 different sizes rather than 18 (the number of sizes Apple offers), but it seems likely that for people, this coarser sizing increment is going to either force them to a band that is too tight or too loose.<br /><br />I do also wish there was a dark blue band with black accents for the holes (instead of white), as I like blue but prefer a more understated look (went with the black/black band here).<br /><br />Still, I like this band, and am satisfied with the purchase!"
4.0,"Very nice timepiece for the price that you pay for . I currently own many g shocks , seiko monsters , suunto cores and this watch has made its way to the top of the list . I love the perfect size of 46mm and the watch is super comfortable , my only gripe about the watch which is why I won't give it 5 stars is that the mineral crystal scratches fairly easy . I have owned the watch for maybe a month now and have plenty of small scuff like scratches , and that's with fairly light use , other than that for a daily beater it's tough to beat , but if timex where to use maybe a more scratch resistant glass then this watch would be a 5 star ."
4.0,These came quickly and were pretty decent for the price.
4.0,Beautiful shirt but it runs small. If you have a skinny child. This is for you. I have a chubby grandson 4 yrs old  50 lbs he needed the size 7. I will pass the size 5 to other family members. But it really is a beautiful shirt. I love it and so did my little guy.
4.0,"The kids think I look very chic.  It  is a nice alternative to a t-shirt and yoga pants.  The color makes me happy and the fabric feels smooth and silky.  The dress hand washed and line dryed well.  No ironing needed.  The only thing is the fit.  With a smaller bust, the dress looks a little frumpy.  But I enjoy wearing it around the house."
4.0,Very flowy and the waist ruffles stick out a good bit so definitely don't plan on wearing with a shirt over them...it would have to be cropped or tucked in.
4.0,Beautiful and good quality. Fit well everywhere except my hips. Returned.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter to wear to Disneyworld.  The group she was traveling with was Disneybounding as Disney princesses, and she chose Belle.  My daughter is very small, and the XS fit her waist perfectly.  I did have to get the straps taken in a bit.  My only complaint is that it was pretty long for my 5'2"" daughter, so I had to get it shortened.  But if you are looking for a knee-length dress, it would be perfect."
4.0,"Watch specifications are wrong. The case is approximately 46mm wide... not 40mm as stated (1.80""). I love the design and color of the leather strap. Although the watch is too big for my small wrist, I will be giving it to my grandson. Finally, the date is difficult for me to see and the instructions are confusing as they cover several watch styles."
4.0,It was a great watch. But the clasp came undone one day while I was in the mall with my kids.  I didn't notice until I got home.  :(<br /><br />It wasn't the first time it had fallen off my hand.  I wish the hold was more secure. Apart from that itshe great quality and I love the look.
4.0,"I have the same dress in another color, a print, and love it.  Feminine and gorgeous! Great quality!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the packaging was horrible.  The dress arrived a total wrinkled mess!  I spent 45 minutes with my steamer and it still has a way to go!"
4.0,I like them.  A little different style for me.
4.0,"Cute visor, a bit scratchy around the ear area."
4.0,This was a gift for my daughter she is loving it  Thanks
4.0,"I ordered this on Friday and it arrived on Tuesday, so I'm already pleased with the shipment.  The &#34;pleather&#34; loop looks like it would be too small, but it fits perfectly on my work belt which I believe is 1 1/2&#34;.  The metal clip seems to be well made and secure.  I'll know more once I use it at work, but as of now, I am pleased with this item.  The free shipping was a nice bonus as well."
4.0,"These are INCREDIBLY cute and they don't make your ears sore like most cuffs do. These can be work alone or stacked. They can be worn with casual clothes or for a more dressed up look. Great value for the money, would buy again!"
4.0,"I wear a medium in almost every sports bra I own, but these were a bit big. The material wasn't flush to my skin and puckered out around the armpit area. Going to reorder the small and hope it does the trick!<br /><br />That being said, I loveeee this material and the comfort of these bras. The matching biker shorts are incredible too!"
4.0,Just received them - appears well made product. Washed them before use and tumble dried them - drying took a lot longer than I expected. Comfortable. I hope they hold up long term.
4.0,"This was a gift for a big One D fan.  She was thrilled.  I thought that the lettering could have been a little clearer, but what do I know about the slavish devotion young people invest in their fandoms?"
4.0,I am in process of using it
4.0,the message your dad used to have three pockets now it only has two. I miss the third but other than that it's a wonderful bag
4.0,"Nice top, would recommend"
4.0,Good quality. Very cute and matches with a lot of outfits. They seem to fit very well and the sizes seemed pretty accurate.
4.0,"Very thin , good print"
4.0,"Good fot (lg for a size 10/11 woman) but high waist & long legs.  Warm, soft & super comfy - like more for weekends / or even comfy pj bottoms than for work in office (but could totally pair w/ a sweater & boots for work)."
4.0,Bellroy has figured out pocket storage with quality!
4.0,I normally wear a size small but I'm pregnant and was hoping I could use a larger size as a maternity suit. The swim suit fit great but had more cleavage then I am comfortable with.
4.0,If you don’t like the really small nose rings then this is what you should get . Some of em do look waay bigger than on the pic but they’re different sizes .. it’s shorter than your average L bar but they still stay in for the most part
4.0,"Very cute. My emoji loving 10yo loved them, but they are very thin and got holes pretty quickly."
4.0,"These are super comfortable, & I like the fit, although they are a little bigger than what I normally like wearing. However, I love the pockets, & I have no doubts that once the weather warms up (it is winter where we are currently), these are going to be one of my favorite pairs of shorts to wear for work. I do like the fact that these are swim suit material, which means that they are quick drying material, & they aren't going to be as hot as some of the fabrics that I have worn in the summer time. I also like how flexible they are, & how much movement they have. Plus, with the extra breifs sewn into the shorts, they have added protection (if I decide not to wear underwear with them, or if I should decide to wear underwear, knowing they won't be seen)."
4.0,"Pretty, large and easy to open."
4.0,"These are very comfy. I found the legs to be a bit larger even in my correct size. With how much the outside fabric moves, they aren’t the best for working out, for me anyway. Definitely a great lounge short though! And it has a pocket!"
4.0,The chain was too short
4.0,A well made product. My daughter says it runs a bit small.
4.0,I didn't know whether to 3xpect cheap plastic or a nice soft leather.  Since I got a different case right before that I was expecting to be smooth metal that was cheap plastic I was pleased with the nice quality plastic on this one.  It's very nice.
4.0,It is quite a large bag! Not meant for carrying around for day to day activities as a handbag. Very nice quality.
4.0,"Very attractive shirt. Fits my 5'9"", 188 lbs body perfectly. Very attractive. Seems to be well made. Machine wash & dry. Despite being long sleeve, it's still cool enough to wear in the summer.<br /><br />I docked it 1 star for the price, which for me is a bit high."
4.0,"Bracers are GREAT, I like that the set comes with multiple clips/buttons and the fabric is a good size.  Only negative if the edging on  the fabric is not sewn and is already fraying at first use, not a huge issue but will make this item require replacement sooner."
4.0,Extremely comfortable and stretchy.
4.0,"This ring looks exactly like the rings that you'll find at a jewelry store for a fraction of the price. The ring is true to size, in my case I wear a size 8 it fits perfectly. As others have stated, the rings flaw is the acrylic over the carbon fiber - it will scratch..."
4.0,I like it but hard to put on by myself.  Stiff but will probably be more pliable with wear.
4.0,"A few loose threads here and there + it came pretty wrinkled, but looked adorable once i ironed it!!!"
4.0,"These gloves are a great adornment for the winter weather! I just received mine in the mail and promptly put them on to walk my pup with the brisk, 25 degree Fahrenheit air biting at us. Lucky for her- she had her thick fur coat protecting her. Lucky for me- I had these gloves! Their thick, yet malleable fabric is what kept my hands from being amputated and my dog from missing out on her walk this morning. I give them a thumbs up."
4.0,"They are elegant and beautiful. I only have them 4 stars because they are not quite black they are more like a metallic lavender (purple). I wish they would have been black like the advertised. I will still keep them for my collection! Overall, great quality."
4.0,I really like this wallet and how its designed. easy access to card and the cash clip are great. My only grudge with it is the AIR TAG spot of the wallet the way it fits in actually muffles the air tag call sound which effects the ease of finding the wallet through the air tag but other than that a great product.
4.0,Almost perfect.  The pockets on each end are too small for water bottles.  What's that about?  Aside from that - it's a great bag!
4.0,Nice sweater. It fits me perfectly. The reason I'm only giving it a 4 star is because it looks very cheaply made.  Update to my review...washed it once and I even put it in a sweater bag. It ripped. 😐
4.0,Ordered extra large.  Shoulders and chest are xl but waist fits like a large.  Material good and good length.  Just odd in fit
4.0,"I like this, pretty funny jacket. It is a pity that the Mosсino inscription just looks like a cheap fake for Moschino - very in vain, because in itself a thing of normal quality and interesting."
4.0,This shirt fits my 11 year old daughter and was just what she was wanting to go with a certain flare skirt.  I only gave it 4 stars because if I had bought it for me I would think it was a bit small.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. Fabric does pill up a bit after multiple washes
4.0,"The sunglasses 🕶 are nice so far. The polarized lenses are very dark, which I like. Just wish they were a touch bigger, as that’s what I usually wear. Found some of the added items unnecessary (ie.sticker, wood guitar pick, rubber bracelet). Nicely packaged, with hard case, cloth bag, and cleaning cloth."
4.0,"Fits Husband nicely, a tad bit on the long side. He could have went one size down. Overall nice"
4.0,"The dress looks quite nice.  The color is not the same vibrant purple that is shown in the photo, which is a bit of a disappointment.  It's more like a medium shade of amethyst.  The cape has quite a lot of blue in it and is a different shade than the dress, but at night, it won't be that noticeable, and might actually make the dress look interesting.  It looks pretty stylish, though, so for the price, it's a good purchase.<br /><br />Caveat:  this comment is based on my just having tried it on when I received it today.  I haven't actually worn it out and -- and I won't have an occasion to until later in the year.<br /><br />By the way, this dress will pair well with drop statement earrings and bracelet; a necklace will not go well with it -- it's best for the dress to speak for itself."
4.0,Beautiful jewelry. I was sad when one of the opals fell off of the center piece
4.0,My fiancé loves these earrings. Have that unique rose gold/ black hills gold look. Even though they are plated they must have done a good because after a few months my fiancées ears are doing well when another manufacturers plating didn't hold up over the same period and were irritating her ears.
4.0,"Bought this dress for a wedding. It's a nice color, slightly different than pictured/advertised. Length was nice, as was the sleeve cut. It did tend to ride up a bit."
4.0,"This was a gift, it is a beautiful skirt, just below the knee.  A Princess skirt."
4.0,"This is a pretty necklace.  It's a little heavier than the other ones purchased.  For the price, it's what is expected.  It's like the cheap jewelry you get at the glittery place at the mall than say Macy's or something."
4.0,"The chain and the pendant was very cute, my only dislike was the chain, it was a bit thinner as the picture perceives."
4.0,Very cute pop of color.  Great value.  A little heavy.
4.0,It's pretty and I think my friend will like it.
4.0,Shorter Than Expected
4.0,As expected for the price.
4.0,"Great look for a night out.They are a little heavy and dramatic, not for every day wear unless that's your day time style."
4.0,"First, let's talk about the packaging. It shouts top-class and care. Nice for giving as a gift, and I'm giving a pair to my daughter (and ordered a different pair for myself). I'm always on the hunt for leg warmers - especially since my favorite pair is now torn beyond repair. It's been difficult to find replacements, but these gray ones, and the multi gray ones that are coming, will do the trick. What I have to comment on now is the solid color gray. It's thicker than expected and is good pulled up or scrunched down. The stitching is perfect, no places pulled loose, no hanging threads. A happy find."
4.0,Wish it was a little looser fitting and the fabric seems thin.
4.0,"i have very small wrists. this sits in the middle of my arm. i wouldn’t get this if you’re petite, otherwise it’s a very nice looking addition to my outfits"
4.0,These socks are very cute and comfortable.  Summer weight.  I need an additional pair of thin socks under them for colder temperatures.  Love the knit fabric with colorful details ... and the lace tops!
4.0,The material and fit were great! I sized up one size from my normal size and it fits well everywhere. I’m only 5’ 5” so I’ll have to take some length off.
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if the sizing were right. The quality seems very good, color and overall appearance is very true to the pictures, seems to be well made, just way too small. I normally wear an XL in most clothes, sometimes just a large, but I ordered a 3XL because that's what the size chart showed that I would need, and there's still about a 5 inch gap where it laces. I bought this for a renaissance costume so it will be going over another shirt, so I should still be able to use it even with the gap, but it's just frustrating... otherwise I like it a lot..."
4.0,Good light weight and fit perfectly  but lens not as good as other brand I guess u get what u pay
4.0,This cardigan has to be made for a petite person. Bought a size bigger and was still too small. Other than that it is good quality and hreat for someone petite. Was a gift for my daughter but she is thin and regular size.  dhe gave it back to me cuz it was short in the arm length and high on waist. Fits me great cuz im petite and wear a small. The item was ordered as a medium so order a size bigger even if your petite.
4.0,My 11 year old son wanted these and when he received them he was pleased.  The quality was decent and the fit was true to his size.  I recommend these at the price they are selling for.
4.0,"Nice strong fabric, lots of room, pretty print.  Black and white actually gray and white  Good value buy."
4.0,Well made but no variation
4.0,glad I ordered 2 sizes larger.
4.0,"Comfortable,  launders well, timely delivery"
4.0,Love this hat! It’s a little snug in comparison to most baseball styled cap but still very cute!
4.0,Very comfortable. I'm 5' 9&#34; I wish the pants were a bit longer. They are a bit snug but comfortable.
4.0,These are a little smaller than I expected but the do the job and the polarization is great. I do not blame the product however as I have a hard facial frame to fit. The sturdy case they come in really protects the glasses when not in use. The case is like a hard cardboard covered in a cloth almost leather like material it is a little hard to explain. for the price you can not beat the value. The cleaning cloth and the cloth case are a nice microfiber and the key chain screwdriver is awesome. Since it is on your key chain it is always available.
4.0,Still difficult to use!
4.0,"I'm a trans guy who is 5'5&#34; and roughly 130 lbs. I wear a medium in Underworks binders. I ordered an XL (which is labeled something like &#34;XL=US M&#34; ).<br /><br />As you can tell, I'm a smaller guy. My chest measurement is about 35.5&#34; - 36&#34;.<br /><br />The pictures above were taken while wearing the binder on the middle set of clips, meaning that there is room to adjust it to be a bit tighter AND looser. This setting is pretty comfortable for me and is how I prefer to wear it most of the time.<br /><br />I got the white one, and unfortunately it's somewhat see-through and is all polyester. The ones with two colors are mostly cotton, I believe.<br /><br />Just be smart and don't do stupid things with your binder: don't do vigorous exercise, dry it with heat, or wear it for more than 9-10 hours per day. Loosen it periodically to give yourself a little break during the day, if you must wear it for a long time."
4.0,"This is a nice quality zip-up hoodie. I really like the color and the fabric is lightweight but still thick enough to keep you warm on chilly spring mornings. The zipper is also of a good quality and I don't anticipate having any issues with it falling apart. Based on other reviews, I ordered this hoodie in a size up from my usual size. I'm 5'6&#34;, 128 lbs and a 34B. I got it in a size large and am pretty happy with the fit. If you're wanting an oversized hoodie, I'd recommend two sizes up. I might order another in an XL so I can have one that's oversized. The arm length is perfect and although I wish it fell maybe an inch longer at my hips, the length is okay and will suit my needs. Other than the fact that it definitely isn't true to size (obvious by reading the reviews), I'm really quite pleased with my purchase. All of this is based on before washing it so of anything changes after I've washed and dried it, I'll update my review."
4.0,This is real fancy!
4.0,Didn't get to use.  Will save them for Halloween.
4.0,Definitely runs small but I was able to make it work
4.0,Bought this as a gift & and it was SO WELL received. I give it a 4 star because I ordered up a size & it was still snug.
4.0,Like the description  -  a lightweight ski sock.  Great fro that purpose but not so good for a normal winter sock.  Very lightweight.  Good quality.
4.0,"After one wear, a small tear appeared under one of the arms and I wish I would have ordered a larger size."
4.0,present. ?
4.0,Grandson liked it!
4.0,"I got this as a gift, and it turned out great!"
4.0,"I purchased this item during a sale. It looks really cute on. But up close it just looks cheap. The pockets on the front are sewn oddly and are raw on the top.  I do like the high/low look. I haven't washed it yet, and probably won't because I'm not sure how it will do. Overall, like I said it's a super cute accessory piece, but don't look for great craftsmanship. I would have sent it back if I had paid full price."
4.0,The material mask is made of is very uncomfortable my face gets hot.
4.0,Nice but not that warm
4.0,"Great price, like it a lot."
4.0,"It keeps my head cool, the design is cute, the bill is long enough to protect my eyes from the sun. The only thing that I don't like is that the tag touches my ear and it gets uncomfortable after some time. Nevertheless, I love it."
4.0,I'm a watch fanatic and I'm very honest to myself in regards to quality of watches. My opinion on this Casio watch is that it fits the purpose for the particular activity I've gotten it for: gym<br /><br />I wouldn't use it for day to day as i have other watches for that. The only downside I found on the watch is the built in light. When I've tried to look at the time in the morning when waking up it's a bit difficult to see what the time is. It only lights up the left side of the watch with more clarity making it hard to tell the minutes and seconds. Otherwise I'm pleased with the watch
4.0,Bought this for my husband but didn’t realize it was all sparkly. It’s beautiful but it’s too big for me to wear and too sparkly for my husband.
4.0,"They are super cute! Kids loved them, they do run small."
4.0,"I like it. Ordered a M. Should of ordered a S. Kept the M, I make it work. To pretty to use for a workout.  I wear it with pretty bralette Jean's and wedges.  It's really cute.<br />Material is really soft."
4.0,Good item. Wasn't completely impressed with the colors & stuff. But I needed new piercings. So it was good for the price. Good for the stuff that it included.
4.0,"This is just an ankle sock. It’s a thin material but fits my 9.5 foot perfectly. I’m not sure this would fit most men’s sizes. I like that they’re not thick because my feet get hot, but there’s nothing much to them. If you want a basic ankle sock then these work fine. If you’re looking for cushion then this may not be for you. I marked these as smaller than expected due to it stating “men’s or women’s”, which I feel is incorrect."
4.0,"I loved this outfit, very floral for any themed event. However, I was not able to wear it due to the size issue. I ordered a large and it turned out an X-Large would've fit better. WARNING: Make sure to order a size up from what you normally wear, never say I didn't tell you! LOL ;)"
4.0,Would of given five but buckle is smaller than what i thought would be
4.0,Worked just fine for me.  Took a pretty long time to arrive but seem to be a decent product.  It is my first time using a foot thong and I am new to the world of dance so I have nothing to compare it to.  Worked great for our beginner routine that needed done barefoot.
4.0,"Very cozy and soft robe.  The colors aren't exactly true-- I ordered the burgundy and it was more of a fire engine red.  Then I ordered the gray, and it was more blue than the pictures showed."
4.0,Cute for different days and certain outfits.  always complimented about it.<br />  fits quite well and can't beat the price.
4.0,"Please see my review on the blue version of this for more detail.<br /><br />I like this set very much.  It fun, lightweight, easy to extend, atrention-getting, and inexpensive.  If you like big and bold, this is calling your name!"
4.0,"This is an interesting dress. It’s not a traditional dress. It is comfortable though. Got a lot of attention from people, not necessarily good ha but it’s a comfortable dress. Not the best quality but it’s ok. I would give it 3.5 stars I’ll round it up"
4.0,super cute top!
4.0,Only thing I would say is it’s see through so I need to get a slip. Next Amazon purchase? It’s so cute & I love the tie! Comfortable material that is nice & cool in warm temps. I got the dark green & like it.
4.0,Works out well
4.0,"I ordered a size small...I’m at 32D and a size 00-0 depending on the store. I found the top to be a little awkward fitting (small in some areas, big in others). The bottoms were too big. I would say they were mean for a size 2 or 4. Very cute though I wish they fit! :("
4.0,Gave it to a friend who was getting her citizenship; she wore it that day!
4.0,"I buy it for my mom who is 76 years old. She likes it because very soft, comfortable use it."
4.0,Hat fits as expected.  Decent quality.
4.0,leaves green ring on finger
4.0,"This is more like a shirt than a dress. It barely covers my daughter's booty. Sleeve length and shoulder wish and all that are fine, but definitely will need to wear with a bottom."
4.0,Nice Item Good Quality For The Price  A++
4.0,5 stars for quality and price.
4.0,A strong smell but well made
4.0,The product itself is amazing fit is TTS but it is very short. That's my only issue
4.0,Gran artículo medieval para disfraz.
4.0,"I was looking for a replacement for my Knix tanks that was more summer appropriate - spaghetti straps, breathable. This is it! The only thing I would Change is that the padding is very thick, narrow, and permanent.  I would actually like it to be permanent,  if it was thinner. I just wish I could swap the padding with something more appropriate for a D cup."
4.0,"The tools are very nice, everything you can think of needing but the case on the inside is falling apart."
4.0,"Great fall dress.  Fits great, but I'm tall (5' 10&#34;, 165 lb, 36B), so the waistline sits a bit high on me.  Impressed with how heavy the fabric is, for the price I expected a lot thinner material.  I've work in 4-5 times, and have gotten compliments just about every time.  (for example, after work I went to the supermarket, and the cashier said, &#34;love that dress!&#34; and asked where I got it.)"
4.0,"A pretty good strapless bra. Sizes was about tricky, but the company was great about returns/exchanges."
4.0,"I wanted briefs that had an open crotch so the boys could have their freedom while keeping my clothes clean. Upon first inspection these briefs satisfied neither of those needs.<br /><br />The fabric is sheer, almost see-through, so I doubt they will keep my clothes clean. However, they appear to be well constructed; no loose threads or irregular seams.<br /><br />The crotch has a band of material that frames the mesh pouch, but the pouch was too small. I wish it was because I was so well endowed, but I am an averaged size guy. I cut out the pouch and now the boys are happy. The fit is a little snug, but after cutting the pouch out they fit great and are comfortable."
4.0,"Nice dress.  Not see through.  Material is not stretch at all.  I got an XL, which fits me nicely (not tight at all).  I can move around freely after putting it on.  I have a large middle section (5'2.5"" tall, 170 lbs, 40 - 38.5 - 43).  The only problem of this dress is length.  If you are a tall lady, you may not appreciate of the length .  Can't wait to wear it next month."
4.0,i like the cut
4.0,"These are awesome shirts.  I bought several and it's the only bra I wear anymore.  Real comfortable and lifts.  Shirt does not ride up.  I did have to order one size larger than normal. But overall,  really love these.  I have 5."
4.0,The gloves are cute and I love the convertible part but I failed to read that the thumbs are still exposed for texting if you cover the rest of your fingers with the mittens.
4.0,"I love them they are really cute. The only bad thing is that in the picture shows 12 hats, but there are only 10 , I orderded two packages and insted of receiving 12 in each package there were 10 in each package so you owe me 4 ."
4.0,Fine build-quality. Looks sturdy.
4.0,Very cute swim suit.  The padding in the top seems to shift around a bit but otherwise it's a good fit.
4.0,"Great shirt but too small.  I am 5'6&#34;, 245lbs and normally order a 2X for loose fitting clothing but ordered these in 3X.  Unfortunately, they were too small. Color and quality appeared to be excellent but they just didn't fit."
4.0,"Order two sizes larger, little tight but I like."
4.0,"I would say this is a great necklace, it has a nice rose gold tone to it which makes it look very elegant. I wouldn't recommend it for women, it is quite small so its mostly for younger girls or little girls. Overall I do like the necklace, good design and color."
4.0,I like the necklace but the words are hard to read. It doesn't really take away from the quality of the necklace though. It also arrived almost 3 weeks earlier than expected!
4.0,I would order a size up if you want longevity. One wash and it will get tighter & tighter. Nice dress though
4.0,Good beach cover up! Runs a little big could size down
4.0,It's nice but tight on space. A little lighter than expected. It has a smell so it needs to air out.
4.0,"The pin looked wonderful, however,  the clasp on  it wasn't good."
4.0,"I like these. I have a big butt and so the length in the back is nice. It is pretty long in the back, so if your butt is more normal sized/smaller, it might feel too long. But for me, it covers my butt cheeks and about an inch past that! They are comfortable, high waisted and just loose enough to fit but be casual and comfy.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'5&#34;, 26 in jeans, and about 125 pounds. I am pear shaped with most of the weight in my lower half. I have a slender build. I bought a medium, and before washing, they got nice and loosely! However they are 100% cotton so I'm not sure how/how much they may shrink...."
4.0,"Simple, but needed inserts."
4.0,"If they hold up, I'll buy them for all of my shoes. They are affordable where others cost more than the shoes I put them in.<br />UPDATE: I now have 4 pair so I don't have to swap them around as much but I plan on getting at least 4 more for my other shoes."
4.0,"Fine product rwo criticisms though, it has no draw string to tighten the fit at the waist.  I ordered a medium which is the size I wear , 160lbs 5’9” and it fits like a large. Otherwise, well  worth the money, fine materials and well made. Ordered Feb 17 arrived March 2."
4.0,Higher waist than preferred so not quite as comfy for my child.
4.0,I purchased these for a girlfriend... She has tiny feet that get super cold. She absolutely loves them. The seem between the big toe can be a bit problematic/uncomfortable though and needs adjustment throughout the day.
4.0,"A little small for my fingers. Had to stretch it out before wearing it. Great for working out and coaching gymnastics though. Pretty colors, as well."
4.0,XL.. 5'6.. 210lbs.. This gym tee is good for people that are lean or skinny around  the waist area but not good for people that are not..
4.0,I like the whole look of them on and that I don't feel restricted.
4.0,"Really like the fit and feel of these pants.<br />My only complaints are:<br />1. as mentioned in other reviews, the from two pockets are only extensions of the side pockets.  I can't put a phone in there for fear of scratching it with the other junk in my pockets.<br /><br />2. The zippers on the side pockets are not good enough quality.  I can't unzip them with one hand because they don't glide smoothly.  That said,  I find the pants to be a good value for the price and would probably buy them again.  I would definitely buy them again if the issues mentioned were resolved."
4.0,"It is very beautiful but if you do not have many hips it will be loose, I do not recommend it for thin women"
4.0,"My daughter loved her gift, she wears it all the time. Just sad it showed up late for her birthday."
4.0,"Bought this for my son, it was true to size and fit him perfectly. I liked that the inside of the costume has a layer of soft fabric and no need for extra clothes to prevent itching form material. Be careful with the button, one of them ripped when I tried to unbutton the costume to put it on my son. Perfect for a cold trick or treat night , keeps them warm !"
4.0,Fit was lovely and worked very well as the underdress for my version of Claire Fraser from Outlander for Halloween
4.0,I like it less than I thought I would...
4.0,"It’s nice ,but a little smail"
4.0,"fit well, light and sporty.....only drawback is thin plastic easily slips free of the frame."
4.0,Run's smaler than expected.  I always werar an XL which is usally a little big but I like it that way.  This top fits like a large instead of an XL.  It is made of a quality material.  Make sure that you buy a larger size than you would normally.
4.0,"A little too big for my ankles.. I wear a 6.5, but I usually have to readjust cause when I walk, it feels like I am going to drop it cause it is losening.. but it gives a rocking look to your outfit, specially if you accompany it with all black.."
4.0,"Cute shirt, good quality"
4.0,Bought for my 9 year old. The gloves were just a tiny bit big but she can wear them. I think its a little bulky. The hat was much smaller than I expected. Very warm but I will have to get her water proof ones if she was to actually play in the snow.
4.0,these gloves are not very warm and you have to hold them up to the light to get them to really glow but they are cool either way  and the little &#34;grippys&#34; are nice. great for driving
4.0,My 4 year old granddaughter loved it and for her perfect.
4.0,"The earrings look like the photo, but they are smaller. The product is smaller than the picture that I included."
4.0,Shipping was fast from China to Wisconsin. The lens is slightly thinner than the Oakley lens. Fit the frame just fine. Worth the price.
4.0,"The ring is okay. You can barely see the cross or the prayer written on it without some type of light shining close to it. On the picture the writing looks very dark, however it is very light and you can barely see it when wearing the ring.<br />The picture I provided looks like the engraving is dark but it is not at all. I ordered it to wear it as a thumb ring and it rotates around your finger as described and I like the fact of wearing the Lord's prayer on my finger but I would like to at least see it when I look down at my finger 🥴."
4.0,"I bought this shirt for my 12 year old daughter, got her a small fits great, it’s simple and soft."
4.0,Nice slippers. They do the trick.
4.0,So cute!! I love the details and they are super soft!!
4.0,It is good but the sleeves are so tight
4.0,These are not expensive shoes but they fit the purpose of dress shoes for a growing boy.
4.0,Product is good.
4.0,"very good product for the cost, better than expected!"
4.0,I really like the look. Fit to the T... I should have ordered one size up. But I do like the look
4.0,Cute just not very stretchy I would definitely size up
4.0,"I bought this for my 6 year old to wear for a costume- it is so very small- it is more for a 4 year old. The color is perfect though, we are going to make it work- but it's nothing like the size in the picture."
4.0,It was a super cute going out purse but it was too small to hold my Motorola Style G Phone
4.0,"I have ordered more than one pair of these Capris, and none of them keep tight. They look awesome when I first put them on, but as the day goes by, they loosen up. I ordered them in a size 10, but also a 12. I am 5'7"", and weigh 158 lbs. The product fits perfectly when it first arrives, and after washing, but doesn't keep it's shape."
4.0,Matches the loops and hooks in my various bra brands. Delivered in a very timely manner.
4.0,"A little challenging getting adjusted to ensure tight, but once adjusted properly works wonderful.<br />Helps easily identify bags on conveyer at airport and ensure luggage is secure from thiefs and breakage."
4.0,"These are cute pajamas, fit normal. They had a funny, metallic smell in the beginning, took few washes to go away."
4.0,My wife loved she looks beautiful with that Dress
4.0,"I am 5”2 and this dress was way below my knees. I hemmed it a little bit to bring it to the mid of ny knees and it changed proportions and the entire look. Quality is great, so are colors. And pockets!"
4.0,"They are easy to put on your watch band but i had issues with them staying where they are supposed to be, it keeps sliding around. I might have to try gluing it to the band.  I didn't need to use the tool included to put it on the band."
4.0,a little larger then what i expect but still nice shirt
4.0,"Fit perfect, color is awesome and daughter loves it."
4.0,"Cute, skirt is quite big but sizable so will last some tims."
4.0,"They do exactly what they're intended to do. They reduce glare. If you're night blind like me, it's not going to do much to help that, but it's nice to at least be rid of the glare."
4.0,Runs small I need to go up in size so disappointed because I loved the PJ’s so much that their not available anymore so I could exchange them😢
4.0,"This is a very comfortable belt. Some are tight and rigid, but this has a nice give to it. I agree with others that the clasp seems a little cheap."
4.0,Only 4 stars because the material is see through. Other than that it fits and looks the the pic. I'm 230 and have DDD'S. Very dressy.
4.0,nice shirt but run small
4.0,"My daughter brought this because she is big on head wraps and especially during this time of quarantine. They are thin but great because it’s lightweight and the color is a true. She brought one yellow and one orange ones and loves them both  . She fold the scarf in half , then folded it again in half quarter of the way in order to be sure her hair wasn’t still seen under the scarf."
4.0,"Our three year old, loves Shopkins, she was so enchanted with them she happily played and studied them during a cross country drive from California to Missouri.<br /><br />This bag gives you a wonderful selection in an easy to see zippable carrying case.<br /><br />The case itself is functional, but without any real thought put into it, it folds in a fairly haphazard way, the openings are too small for an adult, so if you playing with your child, the case is something of an impediment.<br /><br />But on the whole this is a nice toy, and would make a great gift, I would happily buy it again."
4.0,looks a little baggy and cheap in my opinion  but I've gotten many compliments and had people tell me it actually looks expensive.
4.0,Got this for my daughter and it fits her great!  The top doesn't provide much support but the bottoms are just as high waisted as they appear in the picture and this suit looks awesome!
4.0,"(NOTE:This is not my final review, Will reorder a Bigger one) I am 6ft 2in, 235lbs, with six pack, muscular. Its everything it looked and felt, However its 4 out of 5, because it didn't fit.  Its a 2XL, it was tight around the biceps, upper back, shoulders, and chest. My shoulder could rip the coat in two if I flexed my muscles."
4.0,I am a size 14 this fits but is not as loose as I would like
4.0,Good boots for the price
4.0,"Good fit, Fast service. Great material."
4.0,My husband loves this for keeping the sun off his noggin and dips it in the water to keep him cool
4.0,"Super cute, sturdy hasn’t tarnished yet! It’s been a few weeks and I’ve worn it on vaca and swimming."
4.0,Just lovely.  They were just as advertised
4.0,No ajustó en la espalda
4.0,"I bought 2 of these for a dance performance. Just standing still, the dress shows flaws. The hem is uneven. The waist is a bit high. BUT in motion, this dress really shines! We received so many compliments on this dress after our performance!<br />Sizing: I generally wear a women's medium and my dance partner wears a small to a medium. I looked at the size chart and decided to buy myself an XL and my partner a L. The dresses were too big so I returned the XL and bought a M. Perfect. So I would order up 1 size from american. I'm 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs and wore the L."
4.0,"Well they did what I expected them to do,  create a barrier between the breast and the top layer of my shirt. The shape fit most of my sports bras and shirts that needed a removable pad."
4.0,"These jammies came and are just the cutest.  They package the printed picture on the front with tissue paper so it doesn't get messed up in the shipping.  My son is 4.  He runs small for his age on weight (18 month shorts fit perfectly around the waist, but he needs 4T for the length).  I ordered the 3T-4T.  It fits perfectly around the waist, but the shirt was quite tight, which is fine for jammies.  The sleeves and pant legs however were 3-4 inches too short.  I rated 4 star because I am just returning this set and ordering larger.  The actual product is very cute and I suspect will be softer with a washing, but I will have to wait for the larger size to answer that for sure.  Order up in sizing and these are adorable!!"
4.0,"The material wasn't quite as I expected it to be, however it is a very cute dress.  The small for me, was a bit more snugg, than my other size small dresses. Not uncomfortably small, just snugg.  While on the other hand a medium would be too big.  Overall I'm still satisfied!"
4.0,fit as it should
4.0,I bought to take to the superbowl..awesome bag and cheap!
4.0,"This is a very cute bathing suit.  I was worried that it would be sized small like most Asian products but I was pleasantly suprised.  I bought this for my daughter who loves anything remotely mermaid-ish.  It fit great and the scale print is a shimmery aqua that looks like it will last.  I have it has been washed and worn only a few times but I haven't noticed any shrinking or stretching.  The print had held up perfectly so far also.  I did take off one star because of a discrepancy in the top.  In the picture it showes a small strip of fabric holding gathers between the cups.  The actual bathing suit didn't have any gathers so there was just this weird strip of cloth between the breast.  I simply took the strip off and the bathing suit looks like it was never even there.  The cups still look completely separate with the vee in the middle.  It looks great, like that's the way it was intended  to be.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,It is long enough to adjust it to your needs.  the strap material is of good quality.
4.0,These OEM replacement always make my M-Frames feel new.
4.0,"So yea in the photos it looks like it goes all the way down to her shoulders and that's the farthest thing from the truth. But they're long enough and super cute so I'll keep them!<br /><br />The earrings do look like they will lose their stones and beads after time, you just need to take care of them and be gentle to avoid any damage. Probably shouldn't get them wet either.<br /><br />They don't weigh down your ears so that's good! Going to wear them to a festival so I'm excited to see how they hold up.<br /><br />As far as shipping goes, it came kinda quickly. I believe it took about 2 weeks."
4.0,Love them but I got the XXL because of reviews saying to size up<br />I like a snug tank for layering and should have gotten just XL
4.0,"Fit well, exactly what youd expect from the description. Developed a squeak within a few days ow wearing. All together holding well though."
4.0,"Cute, my dad loves it"
4.0,Comfortable but stated size runs just a bit small.
4.0,"YOU TOLD ME THESE WOULD BE TOO SMALL FOR ME BUT THEY FIT MY 42 INCH WAIST PERFECTLY! PLEASE REVIEW TH SIZING INFO YOU SENT ME, SAYING THESE WOULD BE TOO SMALL! NOT SO!"
4.0,Some has small smudges & scratches.
4.0,"Gorgeous necklace, but since I have a tiny neck it was quite bulky. If you have a nice long neck I'm sure it will look great on you :)"
4.0,Very sweet night gown... only complaint really is that I ordered the purple and recieved pink. Still pretty.
4.0,"this is a beautiful dress, the material is just right, I'm a size 14 with big boobs and I got the 2x, the belt sucks because its so frayed but the dress is perfect so I will just put another belt on. sorry I don't have pics yet<br />[[ASIN:B072HH69TM Mounblun Women's Classy Audrey Hepburn 1950s Vintage Rockabilly Swing Dress Yellow 2XL]]"
4.0,Cute and trendy
4.0,"I got the Jacansi Women's Fleece Long Sleeve Short Sweatshirt Hoodie Dress for my wife, because she is always cold, in Southern California, and I thought this would be a nice alternative for her.<br /><br />It is basically an oversized hoodie. And it is very warm. But it is way too short to be considered a dress. It barely reaches just under her hips. Sitting down, not gonna work.<br /><br />It is a light gray, lined and has a hoodie. Oversized, it feels warm and snuggly and resembles a pretty typical sweatshirt with a hoodie. It does feel a little thicker than most."
4.0,Love the color. Like wearing a blanket. Good price!
4.0,"Color lighter than shown, but ok.  Maybe my hat is from a different fabric lot."
4.0,The bottoms are tiny compared to the top. Had to get different ones but that was fine for the price. I'm large chested and the top supported me well and was easy to adjust.
4.0,"These are very pretty, but after a couple on months the gold begins to wear off.  For the price I would consider this a good purchase."
4.0,Good to have for camping and hiking
4.0,"I really like this cami.  I got two of them, one purple and one grey.  Both colors seem true to the pictures of them.  The only drawback is that they are VERY long.  I am 5'8&#34; and have found them to be a bit longer than I would prefer.  However, they are comfortable and pretty and fit snug enough that I can scrunch them up a bit to make them a bit shorter."
4.0,"Okay, these are gold plated, not gold.  Big difference.  But that means there should also be a big difference in price.  There is no price listed at the time of this review, so whether these are a good value is something you'll have to judge for yourself.  But I like these little earrings.  They are quite tiny, but I prefer small earrings for everyday.  The design, with the double hoop, is cute.  They are supposed to be lead and nickle free.  My ears are somewhat sensitive, and these have not caused a problem so far.  I don't wear my earrings overnight though; always take them off before bed.  And assuming that these will be prices like gold-plated earrings, there is no heartbreak if you happen to lose one.  I don't think that is going to happen because the backs fit snugly and these seem secure."
4.0,I bought it for work and it's good for what it's intended to do.  I recommend them for hold your glasses.
4.0,As long as you order the size as indicated you will be fine. I was worried that they would look too small but they fit well. A little longer than the 80's OP style and shorter than todays style.
4.0,"Came quickly and is a nice little helper.  So, I put my expensive Breitling in the cheapest one I can find, so what, I just want it wound!  =0 )<br />It's plastic, not too exquisite, but gets the job done and still looks nice."
4.0,Calidad y protección
4.0,"It's comfortable and I use it for my scooter, but nice for the money."
4.0,"It doesn't seem real... but I didn't know how to test for it. It's ok, not very excited about it!"
4.0,Adorable suit. My 3 year old loves it. Fits nice. She is tall and petite and we ordered the small.
4.0,this is a nice little belt it works well with what ever you want to use it with I got it to go with a coat I got and it does the job and was a good price
4.0,The material is a little bit thin but it fit well and for the price it's not that bad of a dress
4.0,"Got here almost to late for Christmas, ordered it the middle of November. But when I did get it the product was very good."
4.0,"I am not a small person but I have very average size breasts. I ordered a xxl to be safe and the material was amazing quality just what I was looking for lays very nice over waist and tummy, but my boobs are plastered, Guess I am going to have to work on my back fat a little because its so cute and I want to wear it!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:410d41b0565d57ad701f0038a0329d41]] The top part was not that stretchy and the bottoms were a little tight also I wish I would go got an xl to be more comfortable
4.0,I bought this for my daughter. It fit as expected and is very sturdy. I had to wash it twice when I got it because it had a terrible odor.
4.0,These are extremely comfortable socks. I hate wearing fuzzy socks because they make your feet sweat. But these have not done that. I have had slightly rough feet since winter started. These socks have softened them up in only 2 days. They are nice. That strap is not bothersome either.<br />The only issue is the rubber grippers on the bottom are peeling off already. Its only the second day and I have hard wood floors.
4.0,"I haven’t had a chance to wear my shoes, great stylish shoes for the price, looks just like the online picture, true to size. I can’t wait to wear my new shoes."
4.0,very small but beautiful
4.0,I liked them just fine
4.0,The material is not what I expected but it is nice over-all.  Very thin so make sure you wear undergarments that compliment.  I may post a picture later when I wear it.
4.0,Everyone I bought the sleeping bag as a gift
4.0,"Very pretty because of the glitter, but looks a little cheap. Nice for young girls/high schoolers. Doesn't shed glitter which is good."
4.0,These neck holders turned out to be the exact length that I wanted.  My sunglasses lay on the center of my chest with these holders.  They were a bit thinner than I expected but they hold up well on my fat neck.  Nice product
4.0,Nice light material but tends to shrink.
4.0,"Very soft and comfy shirt, but it was a stretchy material. I went bigger in size because i thought it was more of a cotton t-shirt material. I would have sized down to a medium if I knew that."
4.0,"This is a really cute top. Goes with my Bohemian style. It's light weight and material seems wrinkle resistant so a good option for travel. Fits true to size, good stitching, good color. Just wish it had a bit of a stretch but I really couldn't anything wrong with it per se. I really like it."
4.0,"The dress isn’t sewn very well and the fabric isn’t the best. Still, it has a really lovely graphic. It’s comfortable for lounging around and I would even pair it with some leggings and wear it outside."
4.0,Took a while for delivery but bag had HORRIBLE smell. I had to air it out for couple hours before use. I have gotten a few compliments especially on the colorful strap. I do wish it was more study otherwise I am satisfied with purchase.
4.0,"This product looks good, And good quality."
4.0,"The passport I received is a durable, well put together product.  It has many pockets to put your cards, visas, ect. I'm confident that m Travelambo passport will last me a very long time.  It looks exactly what the pictures look like, and the size is perfect.  I'm not so sure that the product is 100% genuine leather, as I work with a lot of real leather and this feels fake.  Regardless, still a good product for the price.  The shipping was fast and the product came in a protective padding wrap in a box.  I was given this product  at a discount to give my honest review of this product. I was satisfied, but don't expect real leather."
4.0,"Seems like a great top. Exchanging for a larger size though. Runs small. I ordered 1 size up the first time, just a wee bit too snug to be flattering. Sent back for a bigger one. If this one fits I'll be super happy because I loved the first one, just needed it a little bigger."
4.0,My husband likes it a lot.
4.0,"I like this dress..... but I usually wear a large, it was too big in the chest and I am not a busty women(36 B). I exchanged it for the medium. The top fits the bottom is tighter than I prefer. I am keeping it cause it is comfy and I can wear it in the fall with a jean jacket over it. 5'3"" 160"
4.0,5’6” 163lb. This is a really pretty dress that is very comfortable. I would love to wear a dress that’s this stylish but the dress clings to curves that aren’t usually a problem for me. Could be solved with a compressor but otherwise I personally cant really wear it.
4.0,"Super cute dress.  I’m 5’6”, weigh 170 and the large was the right size for me.  The fabric is of good quality. I have enjoyed wearing it and receive many compliments."
4.0,"I really like them , I bought 3 pairs and happy with my  Purchase"
4.0,"I love this mask and it is of good quality, but it came with only two filters.  The description said it came with six.  How can I contact the seller?"
4.0,"Super soft and comfy shorts! I loved my first pair so much,I bought another pair!"
4.0,This suit is cute. The only thing i don't like is it's not tight material like a swimsuit. My daughter swim's 4 times a week and it works just fine.
4.0,"Fits my 10 month old with comfort. I can tell he can't quite hear me when on the mower, so they have to be working... I mean he's not going to ignore me on purpose for a few more years...  Great value at $10..."
4.0,Muy vistosa pero pequeña
4.0,"Shipping took forever. Ordered on April 2nd and received on June 19th.  It did come from China, so I imagine shipping was effected by the pandemic.  The product is exactly what I ordered and am happy with it."
4.0,I like the earrings but the peeps who ship the product needs to package them better. Like some of the reviewers one of the earrings was broken on delivery.
4.0,"I'm rather small breasted and don't need any support from bras, so I decided to try out some silicon nipple covers to see if they worked and cut bras out of my life forever.  I ordered these and the DIMR nipple covers.  The main difference is that these have a slight adhesive (the instruction booklet says it's a medical grade adhesive) so they are guaranteed to stay on!  Plus I can wear them under anything (the DIMRs are only good for under more form fitting clothing).  The only downside is that it seems they are only good for 50 wears (the adhesive probably wears off or something).  But they are very comfortable, easy to use, and easy to clean!"
4.0,Cute just smaller then I expected!
4.0,"Just as I expected, it was the exact same swimsuit I saw at the local Target in a different color (same tags, packaging, etc.) I liked how it looked on me there but the price tag seemed a bit high, plus I thought that maybe a lighter color would be better. But no, unfortunately this suit sat worse than the one at Target and looked not as good. But it's not on the seller, rather just a problematic item in the Target selection."
4.0,"Really nice but a bit light, was expecting more weight ,but nice watch"
4.0,"This robe is soft, warm, comfy and perfect for my Big Lebowski costume. It'll definitely work great as a regular robe too. If you're in the market for a robe, this here is a fine robe."
4.0,These are probably the nicest quality out of all of the charms I have purchased recently from different vendors. That being said I really wasn't a fan of the messages. I feel like I kept them only for a few that I really like. Gave a 4 star because I really like the quality. There are little flecks here and there but they almost add to the charms character.
4.0,"This is one of my favorite caps to wear.  I like that it is adjustable and I am able to wear with my prescription glasses as well as aviators.  I understood that when I ordered this hat that it is not made for a woman's head.<br /><br />I gave 4 **** because I hope that a hat is designed to fit women's head shape as well as the Notches will accommodate larger frames  Overall, the hat is well made, colors are vivid, adjustable and it's one of my go-to caps when I need it."
4.0,"The item seemed like it was good quality with a rich deep green color, but unfortunately is too small so I had to return it. There was only a single size available with no option to get select a larger size. If you buy this item, keep in mind that this would be equivalent to the small band."
4.0,"Deceptively small, yet highly detailed. Using as a prop for D&D nights so it's all good still."
4.0,"Based on reviews I ordered a Large. Large is actually a little big, so I’m ordering down a size. I’m 5’4, 155lbs, 36d. Love the fit as it has more back & front coverage. Great for larger bra sizes!"
4.0,Comfortable  and easier than pulling on my big gear. Just what I hoped for.
4.0,"I love it. Who doesn't want the Flash/Reverse Flash as an option. Though, as expected, the logo is stiff and makes it stick out a bit. No biggie."
4.0,this bag is soo versatile.  I use it for files for meetings and as a cross body when traveling or doing serious shopping.  Beware it's all leather so it's a little heavier.
4.0,"These cheap panties are actually pretty good. I have a home in a pair or two, but that's it."
4.0,Bought a size 5 for my daughter who wears a 4 and they barely fit i want to exchange for a size bigger but she loves them too much 🤷
4.0,"I love it! Pretty and not cheap feeling/looking. My only issue but it’s really more personal, I use the 2nd to the last hole which is kind of loose but when I get to the last one it’s too tight. So sometimes the material rubs on my wrist which makes it itch. Overall it’s great."
4.0,"Although it was very comfortable for all day wear, unfortunately it is not made too well. After a couple of washings, the shoulder strap tore apart from the main bra. Could easily sew it back on, just expected it to last longer than what it did. Removed 1 star for poor durability."
4.0,"These are actually smaller than pictured and have a notch for the rubber band to catch onto and not move which is nice. All around nice guages, but the picture is misleading."
4.0,"Just received the dress this morning. I'm glad I checked the comments, I bought 1 size up ( i typically buy size medium - i'm about size 6-8) but ordered size Large and it fit nicely. Not too tight on the arms, good coverage on the bust, length also great - I'm 5'6"". It just skims the floor, but not a tripping hazard (barefoot). The only thing is I didn't receive a belt with the dress so disappointed with that.<br />Just FYI, the dress is not lined, the fabric is thin but not completely see through, but I wouldn't wear dark undergarments when I wear the dress. Lastly, as I just got the dress, I cant say how it holds up in the wash etc, i just wish I got the belt, it would have been full stars. Its very comfy."
4.0,"Luv the dress, could've been a tad bit smaller to give me the look I was going for.<br />Thanks"
4.0,"Fysa, these are the same insignia used in the original series.  These are also the branch of service insignia for the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Corps branch.  The photo shows the insignia upside down.  A simple internet search will yield multiple images of the same."
4.0,I bought a large which might be the cause of my issue bc I found it a little loose.  The dress is comfortable and soft.  It’s perfect for summer.  You can dress it up.  Great for women with disabilities who needs hip space and something to move with you and not confine you.

4.0,I bought for 50% off therefore that price it’s very good
4.0,Very tall and animation is pretty good
4.0,The band could be sturdier; but nice overall.
4.0,"It's a paper mask. I didn't expect much and I got what I expected. Worked good enough for my Halloween costume, The Duke Skywalker."
4.0,"I've been using this passport holder for a couple years, and I travel frequently. It's good quality and protects my passport well during travel. I also like that I can tuck luggage tags or other cards/IDs in the front pockets. It's a bit thick - almost a sort of puffy feel to it. No idea how it is on RFID blocking as I I'm pretty clueless about that stuff, but other reviews were good. Downfall is that immigration officers and airline agents pretty much always want the passport out of the holder when they scan it despite it being quite easy to scan still in the holder. I guess it's just more cumbersome for them. But the holder makes it quick to take the passport in and out, so it's not a huge bother."
4.0,"I keep these in my car.  These Tantino eye glasses are a great fit and shape.  I love the cat eye frames!  The fact that these frames are so light make them feel comfortable.  I have also found them to be durable, however not bulky which is a bonus for me.  I particularly like the polarized lenses.  I would recommend these as they look expensive, yet they surely don't break the bank."
4.0,"Satisfying heft, solid. Band loops don’t hold the band securely."
4.0,Very cute shirt. Fits great and as expected. Material is a little thin but it’s a great product
4.0,I love it!! I'm about 5'7 size 8/10 and it fit perfectly. The bottoms came up a little higher than on the picture but I think it looks even better. Quality isn't the best but better than I expected for the price.
4.0,"I use this hat on the field while working, loud enough for me & still able to pay attention to your surroundings. Downside was the beanie was stretching out a little loosing the perfect fit."
4.0,did not fit me properly however company resolved it immediately
4.0,"if you wear this to a party or clubbing, people will notice you. It is very pretty and if you have the shape to carry this look off, go for it. This is one sexy dress. You will probably want to use tape that is made to keep some parts in place on your body or you could have a big oopsie. And you will want to wear undies, because it is short. And with this much bling, if you fall or bend over, people will notice."
4.0,"Loved the dress overall, except for one minor issue with off shoulder design constantly kept rolling and bunched up and wasn't able to wear on shoulder became restrictive around shoulder and arms."
4.0,"It's ok but at front on buckle it stays little raised. It's nice and sturdy... by mistake I had put low rating, corrected."
4.0,"I ordered this product on the 8th of March and just received it today. Took a little longer than I would have hoped for but considering it was free shipping I cant complain. I'm 32C-28-38, 5'4 and 124lbs and I went with the medium. The bottoms fit well at my waist, they are as high as shown in the picture which is great and they hug my curves just right although they are a little tight on my butt cheek. Not too tight but enough to be bothersome.  As with the last swimsuit I bought, the cups still seem abit on the bigger side. I thought with the added removable padding it would help which it did somewhat, but it still doesn't feel secure I guess. I also noticed the cups are too far apart so I'll be sewing them closer together in hopes that the top will fit better. Overall though, I really do like this swimsuit. It looks super cute on and I cant wait to wear it this weekend."
4.0,Great dress for a wedding.
4.0,Pretty good for the money. One side was a little wonky.
4.0,Somewhat small (length wise) and not the best quality but I loved it anyway. Perfect as a beach/cover up  romper. Wore it on the 4th of July and got tons of complements.
4.0,Warming great for my daughter
4.0,It’s comfy. Pockets are pretty low and the inseam as well.
4.0,It is comfortable but I think it needs a belt.
4.0,"We use Nitrate Gloves when working on cars, the 6 mil is more durable than a 4 mil and can be used a lot longer before ripping.  This box was on sale so it was a good value.  However, for the type of work we use it for (cars), I'll probably go to 8 mil, as I tend to reuse the glove until it breaks."
4.0,"I love them! One thing I love is if the lenses comes out, you can put them back in easily."
4.0,The sizing is crazy. I bought a XL being an 8/10 but I could hardly put it on. I will purchase again but just because you order a XXL doesn't mean you are giant.
4.0,Very comfortable but I find little fuzzies on the ground everywhere from these. Honestly I would still probably buy them again anyway
4.0,"Thickness is nice, not see through or too clingy, nice dress for the price, I like it"
4.0,Over all I give this outfit a 4 outta 5 stars . I’m a size 14 and weight 191 with a lil junk in my truck.  I ordered a large but  it stretches a lot so I could of order a medium for a tighter fit. . The middle part was kinda saggy as well. I made it work Over all It’s a nice outfit I wore it for a wedding . So I would suggest go down size .
4.0,"Classic watch. Works well, lasts long."
4.0,"It was a good fit, but it was see through (i got white) but it only covered half my torso, but its a crop top. What should i expect :)"
4.0,"I normally wear a XL, I bought this dress in a 4X and it fit perfect. I am 5' 9&#34; and the dress is mid calf which is what I like. The fabric is nice, linen-look. I washed in cold on delicate and hung it up to dry nice distressed linen look. I am pleased."
4.0,"I was looking for a dress to wear to a wedding so decided to give this a try. It was a cute dress, just not what I was was looking for. Nothing negative to say. Just wasn't for me. I'm 5'1, 125 pounds and 36C and ordered a small. Hope that helps."
4.0,"it fits great, pretty good price as well. didn’t give 5 stars because the shoulder straps were super loose, like not tight fitting at all how its pictured on the model& the strap isn’t adjustable. easy fix tho. i used a seam ripper and gorilla glue to adjust them to fit snug. for reference im 5’7 my measurements are 34-28-41.got the medium. the bottom part is tight but that’s expected since i have bigger thighs &a butt. cant wait to dress it up in a few weeks :)"
4.0,"the color is great...haven't worn it yet, will wait for the fall"
4.0,"Darn Cute for such a low price point. Super Flattering. I just had a baby and this is a great suit to cover up my mid section. My chest is a 34F, and this doesn't quite fit but overall the sizing is great."
4.0,Both the flip mechanism and  attachment to the lenses seem sturdier than others I have used. I measured my lenses and purchased the corresponding size and the fit is exact. The only reason for 4 stars is that the flip mechanism is unstylish which is the tradeoff for getting a mechanism that will last I suppose.
4.0,NIce dress! A little small in the arms. But all in all a good dress.
4.0,"VERY CUTE DRESS BUT IF YOU GOT A BOOTY, HIPS AND THIGHS IT WONT FIT WELL. I HAVE A PEAR SHAPE BODY SO SMALL UP TOP BUT BIGGER BELOW AND THIS DRESS WAS SOO CUTE BUT IF I STARTED WALKING OR ATTEMPT TO SIT IT WOULD RISE UP.....ALLL THE WAY UP. SAD BUT I HAD TO RETURN"

The back is a little short, but I have a little bit of junk in the trunk haha, over all I'd buy this dress in multiple colors if available!"
4.0,"I really like this necklace,  just wish the pendant was a little smaller."
4.0,The length a little bit shorter than expected
4.0,"My 3 year old daughter loves these shoes. She fell in love with them before I realized the difficulty of keeping the laces tied. If it had occurred to me that the laces would be difficult to keep tied, I probably would have sent them back. But it was too late, she'd already fallen in love and would not take them off!"
4.0,I was fine. A bit big in the wasit.
4.0,"Works, but breaks pretty easy."
4.0,"The design is very nice and classic, very comfortable and the kid loves it.  The only thing is wish the friction for the bottom stronger.  When the floor is wet, get to watch out."
4.0,"Good hat, they are a replacement for my old ones."
4.0,"I am really picky about my gemstone jewelry, I was to see and touch it. But, it’s 2020 and I couldn’t get to my favorite shops. Took a chance with ease these Sterling silver amethyst Earrings and was pleasantly surprised. Good size and color, obviously not fake."
4.0,I am using mine as a surgery scrub cap and they are amazing. Unfortunately one was cut wrong and I can not wear it but the others are perfect and keep my hair from getting frizzy.
4.0,"This dress was very soft and comfortable, but the bust area runs very big. The tie is adjustable but if you tie it too tight it compromises the look of the top. So size down or expect to worry about it sliding down all day/night."
4.0,"I love this dress! The material is really nice and thick and it is well made. However, it does run a bit small. I got the 4/6 and it was a little tight across the chest area. If it wasn't for that, it would've been perfect!"
4.0,"cute, easy to pack.  There is some sort of wiring within the hat so you can shape it however you like.  I got it for the beach and I haven't gone yet to give it a try, so more information is coming in the near future."
4.0,Fit as expected and are very comfortable.  The slippers also appear to be quite well made.
4.0,"It was to big for my taste but,im not reviewing how it looked on me but how the watch was.Well Its a absolutely perfect watch,almost.The band was stiff but thats to be expected with a new croc leather band.The black Plate was the only thing that showed that this was a cheap watch,being that it was a pry off plate instead of a screw off.All the button functions work perfectly fine.Its a shiny watch which I personally didnt like and it being this shiny and have a jagged bezel makes people think its a diamond encrusted bezel in certain light ,and you will get people to look at it in confusion for a second before they notice its just jagged.The face is perfect no flaws in it absultly none."
4.0,"Overall, I like this top but had to make a few minor alterations. It's a lot longer than show - Definitely, not a cropped length which was what i was looking for. And it's SUPER flowy - I took a few inches off each side to get a more reasonable flowy look."
4.0,The product is good. Just be careful. I have had it for two years. There is a small screw that holds the ball to the display. It came loose. If you lose the screw you are screwed. I was able to fix mine. Caveat emptor.
4.0,"I am 5'10"", 160lb and found a medium to be a good fit and length. I have long legs, so I was worried about the length, but it was a good fit. The only reason I gave this a 4 star for comfort is that there is nothing stopping the shorts portion from sliding up, so I had to pull the shorts back down quite a bit. A larger size may have helped, but I didn't want the skirt too big around my hips. The look of the skirt was very nice and flattering."
4.0,"Fits perfect looks great on my wrist, at a discounted price"
4.0,Good fit light weight for those hot days
4.0,Picture is directly out of the box with no alterations or adjustments. I ordered large.<br />The actual costume material is of good quality. It’s comfortable and easy to move in. I would probably buy this set without the wig if I was to do it again. The wig is going to take some work to use or I may be buying another.
4.0,So cute and fits everything - smells awful!
4.0,So glad I bought these for my daughter! She loves them. The size is a bit wonky they run big I believe. But they work perfectly! Will definitely purchase more.
4.0,"Nice outfit, Pants come with a hike in the butt near the zipper. That’s an easy fix. Outfit does look like the picture. Pants will kind of fade when you put them on"
4.0,"I haven't used them much, but I really like them the little I have. I would buy again."
4.0,Great quality pajamas.  We love all of the PJ pals from Disney.  They look like costumes but are comfortable like pajamas.  My son loves them.  When they had pajama day and he wore the Iron Man version of these he kept getting asked all day where he got them; they're a hit.
4.0,works for the purpose I bought it for......... had to get a veil for it but was cheap enough bought together.
4.0,Very nice ring love it. Fast shipping  deff recommend
4.0,"They are exactly as stated, oversized.  I bought them as my daughter requested a larger case but her glasses float in them.  Otherwise, nice looking case and very durable."
4.0,Such a cute dress for the Spring/Summer! The material is nice and soft (almost silky even). It also fits as expected.
4.0,Four at this price is wonderful.  These are very nice.  True cotton fabric.
4.0,"I didn’t return them but I wouldn’t buy another pair. The material is more like that moister wicking material and I just don’t like the way that feels. They fit well though, high waisted and somewhat stretchy, just pretty long on your thighs."
4.0,"Lovely shirt. Light, casual long sleeve. Ordered item in red. The picture looks like it is red & orange w/ white print. Item came as orange w/ white print. FYI... Orange isnt an option of colors listed, but the one labeled as red is actually orange. Still cute. Keeping it anyway."
4.0,"I love the logo print on this shirt, the material is soft knit texture feel. However you will want to wear a white or black tank or cami under the shirt it's kinda see thru in direct sunlight."
4.0,Good fit and fun to wear.
4.0,The socks stay up after long walks.
4.0,I was very pleased with this purchase. I'm old school and remember when Gloria Vanderbilt jeans were much more expensive. These are the same genes as back in the day but much more cost-effective!
4.0,"It is a red shirt with a dive helmet on it, just like the product description says.  Not much else to add:)"
4.0,"would have paid more if it came with a vibrating box so you dont have to reset it every day, what a pain"
4.0,"I bought this for my sister as a gift. She loves it, but her only complaint is that the pockets don't lay flat. Otherwise, she says it's cute and comfy!"
4.0,These bottoms can fit up to a M/L (but for people that are Larger keep in mind it will be very fitted) I was super excited to find that these were pretty great quality for the price it’s at. We wanted to find something for a dance performance as mermaids and it fit all four of us. One of my friends has a larger backside and it still fit her. It was a little snug in the back but She said it also feels like it will stretch out a bit more over time. So that’s nice. Goes pretty much up to my belly button and is cheeky.
4.0,"I love the sweatband portion of the hat, but the brim could stand to be just a tad wider🙏🏼<br /><br />Also, the logo is hugely annoying. Put a tag on the hat or something, but get rid of that gigantic ""V""."
4.0,I like the wallet just wish it came n a darker purple. But I like it
4.0,"the shoe itself is a bit heavy, but it fits well on my son."
4.0,Its very beautiful wrong size but very well made
4.0,Good quality leotard. We have bought this brand every year at the start of ballet. The leotards always hold up and look great even by the end of the year. The material is soft and durable-holds up well after many washings.  Keep in mind when ordering that the sizing seems to run small. My daughter is very petite and fits into 4T/5T clothing and the 4-6 leotard fits her well. Seems like it would be too small for a girl fitting into size 6 clothing.
4.0,5'10&#34; 155. I usually get size 10 but last Columbia pants were a bit snug in 10 so I got 12 regular length. A bit too large. Luckily it has a drawstring. This same pant in boot cut 12 fits perfectly.<br />Super comfortable and thin.
4.0,"I love the dress. I received it yesterday and wore to work today. I am 5'3 and 138lbs and I got a Medium. It fits but is a little tiny bit big on me. I could have got away with s small. I have a very small waist and some hips on me ( not huge) . I want to order more maybe a red one but for some reason now it is charging $6 for shipping when I paid no shipping on the this dress so I will wait now. The only Negative was the shipping charge for the dame dress different color. Besides that I love it. Soft cotton material, very thick not see through at all and very very comfy for work"
4.0,Great find for work and dress up!
4.0,"Comfy material. The shoulders are tie straps. Not as flattering as I had hoped, for my body type. I ordered the XL but exchanged for Lg (Lg is what's pictured) I'm 5'4, 168lbs."
4.0,"For reference I am 5'2, 120lbs, 32 D, with a smaller frame. Got this in a small and wish it came in an xsmall or was a little more form fitting. Nice that you can wear a bra with it! Overall great dress;  just wished for a little more hug on the body overall."
4.0,"It is very nice, but I want one that is even slouchier. more like a beanie... maybe i just have too big a head!"
4.0,"My daughter, a nurse, loves this watch and has used it continuously since she opening the box. Perfect for the intended purpose."
4.0,"fit the glasses perfectly, could tell the lens was not as high quality as far as clarity."
4.0,If you dont have hips or a butt than order a size down...i didnt want to go through the process of returning the dress...so i got my mother to take it in on the lower half so it could fit like a bodycon dress
4.0,"The color of this bag is gorgeous. I didn't find any flaws anywhere, inside or out. It's very flexible and soft, yet sturdy. Tha handle length is good. The inside pouch is snapped in for easy removal or to place back in. The quality is amazing!<br />Personally, I would prefer to have more inside pockets for easier finding of common used items such as a cell phone. The only other issue for me, but may not be for someone else, is that when the removable pouch is in, it doesn't keep your items on the same side where you put them. Everything in the purse can slide under the pouch."
4.0,"I measured my nose and ordered a 7mm. When it arrived, it was way too small and felt rough when I tried to put it through my piercing. It made my nose sore and extremely red. I do think this is all due to it running small. The hinge works amazing and is invisible when clasped together. I have high hopes for this brand so I am exchanging it for a bigger size."
4.0,I got this to go with a specific outfit that needed a certain look. Although it was hard to decide which color I went with all black because I felt I would like it the most long term. It has a black studded cross and then several beads that are  woven together with a black material. It is nice looking and fits both large and small wrists. It has adjustable ties that you can pull closed to make the bracelet smaller or you can pull them open to make it longer. I have a 7&quot; wrist and it fits it fine. It is probably best for an 8&quot; wrist as the balls will hang a bit if you have this all the way on as tight as it can go. The beads alternate between smooth and beads that have black crystals all over. There are a total of ten beads in the bracelet and the cross in the middle. The black beads almost look hematite. I received this bracelet in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"Bell helmets, at least Bell bicycle helmets, fit my oval head much better that other brands.  Thinking about getting back into motorcycles, I thought a good start was to replace that 40 year old Bell Star.  I took something of a chance ordering this fit-critical component mail order, but my bicycle helmet experience paid off:  This one doesn't squeeze my forehead.  I am a little concerned the temple pads may need a little trimming to allow easier access for my rather flimsy wire-rimmed glasses.  Now, I just need to work on the motorcycle side of the equation...."
4.0,Color was way darker than shown in the picture but thankfully it ended up looking decent on my skin tone. Decided to keep it but it was disappointing how different shade the colors were in real vs the photo. However material is nice and soft and sizing seems accurate. I ordered 40 because I prefer loose fitting but 36 or 38 would have been just as fine as well
4.0,Very cute on my daughter. Definitely runs a little small.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but order a large if you normally wear a medium."
4.0,"I purchased these to use when running a weed wacker.  Usually, petite-size pants reach the top of my feet.  These are about 1.5 inches (right) and 2"" (left pant leg) shorter than that.  Similar to the photo, one pant leg is longer than the other.  I gave it 4 stars because all I use them for is weed wacking so I will be keeping them.  Next time I will be purchasing a regular-length pair."
4.0,A little pricey but cute!
4.0,I love this casual light sweater. It is comfy and loose fitting.
4.0,I like this top for a couple reasons. I was rhinking the lace was going to be a little transparent but thankfully its pretty thick. it is fitted but allows room in the abdomen to breathe a little and its a nice piece to layer or wear alone.  and for 5 bucks you cant beat it. 10 out of 10
4.0,"these shoes are definitely a bright red, and they are great so far just still a little bit to big. need a little breaking in."
4.0,"34"" waist and needed a large"
4.0,"Great product but not as sturdy as originally thought...... wants to close a bit offset and has easily made imperfections/wear on the outer part, but still very functional and still use daily"
4.0,Cute glass but pearl fell off before I got any use out of them.
4.0,The necklace part is very thin I know u probably get the for free but it’s so thin I’d rather not had it in the no at all because u can’t use it with the Heavy charm. I loved the charm looked just like the picture.
4.0,If hat wasn't coming with should have not put with a hat other then that I like the gown
4.0,"This Halloween outfit is exactly as described. But, a little pricey for the quality of material."
4.0,"This bracelet is great! My boyfriend really likes it. However, It is kind of difficult to take on and off. Other than that, I would recommend it."
4.0,Good fake to wear when traveling!
4.0,Really cute! The suspender straps were not the easiest to adjust and my son kept pulling the bow out of the little piece of fabric that kept it connected to the neck piece.
4.0,I bought these pants b/c a review said they had fleece lining. ... but they do NOT!<br />I'm keeping b/c they are super comfy
4.0,"The fit was a little lose, and I wish it was closer to knee length rather than mid calf. But all in all its a great dress."
4.0,"Excellent quality for the price. The red one came out exactly as pictured, but the green one actually arrived yellow...reading the description more closely, it just promised that I would get two colors, but not specifically red and green. I'll make use of the yellow one but am mourning the lack of a green one.<br /><br />As a confirmed, life long bibliophile, these necklaces are going to quickly become my favorites."
4.0,"5’3” 155 lb; Chest 40”, Waist 32” Hip 40.5”<br /><br />The dress is long, I couldn’t wear it with flats, but a low heel will do. I possibly could have gotten away with medium however the Large fits enough that I can make it work rather than risk exchanging for too small of a fit in the medium."
4.0,"Nice arm length, good quality material, but the color is not the same as shown in the picture."
4.0,"We ordered this for a gift.  He usually wears a large, but that was too big so we returned it and ordered two medium ones.  The brown one came promptly (within six days) and he says it is comfortable and fits well.  I subtracted a star as we are still waiting for the black one to come - it has now been over a month since we ordered it.  We keep getting e-mails that the shipping is delayed but, at this point, no date for it to arrive."
4.0,"Nice, but the strips of material across the shoulder are extremely loose.  I am going to have to make sewing adjustments to make it look right."
4.0,Today's two months since I got my nipples pierced and I bought these so I could change my jewelry and I love them they're just what I wanted and I picture
4.0,Very cute. Don't expect high quality. Which is obvious after seeing the price. Definitely a fun choice to try out without breaking the bank.
4.0,"My 17 year old daughter's first comment when she saw this was ""what a cute bra!"". It fits as expected. This is a front fastening undergarment with adjustable straps. The lace touches are pretty. She appreciates that the straps can be converted to a crossback style or traditional. It offers adequate support. The pink color is very light and it looks more like a nude color. Overall, she is pleased with it."
4.0,"I returned these because I couldn't adjust to the transition, but they are very pretty, lightweight and clear."
4.0,"Just got the slippers today, but they are comfy! Exactly as described and appears to be good quality."
4.0,"It is a beautiful prayer shawl for the low price.  Although I am not experienced with using  one, I love it.  I love the verse in each of the four corners and the lined case to hold it, is a work of art also.  The only thing I wish is that it had a translation of the words along the side of the shawl.  The only time I've seen one worn is in the DVD  The Harbinger Man and he is a Rabbi, preaching a sermon.  I put mine on as a &#34;sacramental&#34; to help focus on prayer, much as I would use a Rosary.  I love the &#34;Grafted In&#34; symbol on the case and the shawl.  Thank you."
4.0,VERY impressed with this ring!!! It looks exactly as pictured and it doesn't turn your finger green. I wear it daily and it hasn't turned pink nor has it tarnished. Its even prettier in person and when the sun hits it its even more impressive. If you like this ring don't hesitate to buy it because its beyond worth it.
4.0,"I didn't like the 2nd layer. It's hard to breathe when you are working. If you are stationary maybe it's okay but if you are always moving, the thickness will get you to catch more air to breathe and that's the problem with this mask. Overall, it's a good mask."
4.0,The sweat pants were super comfortable. The top was a bit snug and shrunk in the dryer. The material isn’t as soft as you’d expect. Overall not bad for the price.
4.0,Bought for a garden party; like the cut and print a lot! The material is just a little thin. Needed layers underneath to feel covered.
4.0,"This is a fresh shirt ,  I like to wear<br />walking through the beach nights ."
4.0,My brother gave it to me as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it. Very simple and classy.
4.0,"Love these! Good quality for the price, I love that they’re rose gold too!"
4.0,Love this hoodie just a little hard to size and wish it had a front pocket.
4.0,Got a small for my daughter so I feel like it is true to size as she wears XS/S in most tops. The hoodie is thin but let’s be honest you don’t buy a cropped hoodie for warmth. She loves it and has worn it a couple times. I’m curious how it will hold up after a few washes. My main concern is how much the fabric will pill and if the decorations will hold up.<br /><br />Update: The hoodie has held up well after numerous washes it doesn’t appear to be any noticeable pilling and the graphics are staying nice. The only issue she has with it is that she cannot wear the hood unless she wears a cami with it as it becomes too short. The hoodie also seems to be a magnet for hair.
4.0,Great quality and a great price perfect for dressing up or dressing down this shirt goes with everything
4.0,Great fit. However the material it's made out of seems to be wearing out rather fast.
4.0,"Rich color (I purchased the burgundy), thinner material than expected but has a nice feel. Goes great with tights or leggings, a colorful scarf, and boots. Comfortable that you can dress up or down without it feeling so fussy.  It's a fancy t-shirt dress. Great piece to throw on when you don't feel like dressing up but still want to look presentable."
4.0,"For those needing a clear bag for work that do not allow any portion of the bag to be non-transparent, be advised the bottom is not transparent and it is not a removable insert on the bottom.  It is a solid satin-type base, and it is not clear.  Other than that, I love the bag and wish I could afford to keep it, but need a new work bag and this bag will not work."
4.0,The importan thing is that the child is cheerful.
4.0,"It's beautiful and runs accurately. But the clasp comes undone easily, and the watch falls off often."
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece. In fact, I had to go to a professional to have my starter piece removed, and she loved it, stating how original it is. She'd never seen one with a black &#34;stem.&#34;<br />My only complaint is it's a bit short, so it pinches easier, but not enough to remove it.<br />I've received countless compliments in the days since I inserted it.<br />Finally, with the top jewel being the one to come off, it's much easier to remove, if I decide to change it out."
4.0,These were such a fun giveaway at my son's  8th birthday party. Great value and colors to choose from.
4.0,"They are quite large.. larger than expected.. you can tell they are cheap but I would say fairly priced for what you are getting...<br />okay so I just wanted to wear them by the pool and look like a diva boss like Ashley Longshore but for 1/50th of the price. I would not recommend them and would not buy again, but they will work for adding a little diva-ness to my pool look!"
4.0,"The fit on these is a bit snugg on the arms, shoulders, and chest. I personally find it a nice touch. My girlfriend likes the way it looks but hates me wearing them in public. The stomach has a bit of extra material so it's loose there on me. I've used these on morning runs and workout and they hold up well. With good air flow they stay dry and cool. Without air flow they do get sticky and feels like it holds in heat though. At the gym they tend to be really good as long as the fans are on. I also use them as a base layer under a motorcycle jacket and they help keep me dry and cool under the jacket well. Pretty close to near perfect. It for the price I still recommend. Only way you'll get something better than this is if you pay significantly more. This is a good deal."
4.0,Adorable socks but don't wash these with cotton garments or they will pill up. I guess extra fuzzies on your socks aren't the worst things (first world problems) but they just don't look as pretty if they have a bunch of fuzzy bits all over.
4.0,I love it. I don't like how the pins are loose and not part of the band or how hard it is to adjust but it's worth what I paid.
4.0,Nice enough gloves for the price.  Was expecting more colors but got 2 pairs of some colors.
4.0,Doesn’t feel sturdy enough but very cute.
4.0,Sorta big...or maybe it's just that I have a small head lol. Well I love it even if its kinda big
4.0,Super cute and comfortable outfit! I'm 5'1&#34; so it is too long and will need to be hemmed but I expected that and if you're short like me and plan on only wearing heels with this you won't need to hem it at all!
4.0,Luv the appropriate size.
4.0,At $0.01 its way over my budget
4.0,"I really like the shirt, I ordered a medium and think it Fit as I expected. Really cute!"
4.0,These shoes were really great for the price.  I like that they come in neutral colors that you can were with anything.  Very lightweight.
4.0,"I wear a womens size 6 and they were slightly large, but not large enough where they were unusable.  They worked just fine for barre though, and I'll definitely be using them again!  Also, 4 pairs!! What a deal!!"
4.0,My husband absolutely loved the bracelet. However it doesn't close tightly and it's already lost. We're both sad that it's gone because we both liked it very much. It would be better with a different clasp.
4.0,The wife really likes these
4.0,"Cute plated zirconia bracelet I got for my wife. Looks nice (while not being especially expensive) and suitable for daily use. Easy to snug up/losen, but given the mechanism to do so seems to consist of a silicone ring in an enclosure in a way I've never seen before, I worry about longevity. When it goes, this can't be worn anymore, and if you have moving/flexible silicone tools (like the oven mits, for example) you know that eventually they crack and the tear further from the crack area. Usually, catches\clasps are clever little hinged dohickeys, and I think this is engineered to fail in a 'it's disposable' sort of way.<br /><br />That being said, at the price it's a prerry, inexpensive costume piece, and I would still recommend it to others."
4.0,Very pleased. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the size runs small. I took the advice of other reviews and ordered up 2 sizes and it fits perfect.  It was risky with that in mind but I took a chance as it looked so cute in pictures. I will be wearing it with boots and leggings as it's perfect for that look.
4.0,Good quality I would say they are more like a women’s large than a unisex size. Would recommend but just be aware of sizing.
4.0,"The perfect pencil skirt. I want it in several colors! I've worn it for business, nights out, and work. The color for the gold is bit more mustard than the photo is darker. I love the fit!"
4.0,Warm and very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"I really like how this dress fits. The only reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it wasn’t as long as it is in the pic on Amazon. I’m 5’7 and the dress falls a little above my ankles. Because the dress fits wider in the hips, I purchased a small. I like the fit. It fits well across my bust line. I could do a medium, but this size is fine."
4.0,"I normally wear a women's 14/16. I am 5'5"" and 196lbs and wear a 40DDD bra and a size 9 shoe.<br /><br />I was worried about the size chart as it was all over the place!!! So I took a chance and ordered a SMALL and to my surprise 😲 it is pretty much on point. The booties run about a size 10 or 10 1/2. But according my my measurements the small is the correct size.<br /><br />It is a LITTLE roomy.. (I have a flat stomach and a good size butt). So if you are looking for more room.. I'd say order the medium."
4.0,"I was expecting it to be bigger but I love the blue, it's unique and makes it stand out more!"
4.0,I really like the dress it's just a little bigger and longer than it looks in the picture
4.0,They fit exactly like the should. The only reason I didn't give it 5stars was because I had to re-sew some stitching in the thumb area after a few wears.
4.0,Was not flattering on me.  Might look good on someone very thin because of it's cut.  It's meant to be baggy.
4.0,"I ordered a large and it fit well everywhere except the stomach.  While it was nice and snug in all the right places there was extra fabric in the middle of the dress (from the draping I'm assuming) and ended up making a kind of pouch in the stomach area.  I'm 5'8, 170 pounds and usually I wouldn't mind extra fabric hiding my belly but it just made the dress, which fit well, look like it didn't fit as good as it did.  Slightly disappointed but will still wear the dress, just maybe with some pins to hid the extra fabric."
4.0,Ordered a larger size as my feet tend to swell on occasion.  They look good and the lining in comfortable.  I made a good pick..
4.0,"This bag is ideal based on styling, color and above all it is trendy."
4.0,"This shirt is awesome! It does run small. I'm usually a large, I bought an XL and it fits like a fitted M/L size shirt. It's rather tight across my chest so order up, ladies!!"
4.0,"They were a little longer than expected, but still very pretty."
4.0,Great looking boots!
4.0,Just what I was looking for.  Very nice and the color is great.
4.0,"The Rings Are Beautiful! Solid , Nice finish .  my only problem is my customizations messed up my order ,  i got a 5.5 and a 12.5  when i customized them i out 10 for Mens and 8 for Womens , and the ladies isnt engraved like i ordered .  So they dont fit ..  Sucks  but they are Beautiful"
4.0,"Theses are decent athletic socks. I only wish they had cushioned soles. The material is thin, but wicks moisture well. The yellow is very bright."
4.0,"Love how that fit any sized hand, although some of the colors were not as fibrant as picture showed."
4.0,"They were too short for me, I am 6”1"
4.0,"Comfortable and love the colors. A little thin and see through when stretched, but worn with a longer top makes it fine. Would buy again"
4.0,This is a beautiful dress but the bustier you are the more clevage this dress will show and may be inappropriate to wear at certain occasions.
4.0,"Material was nothing like the photo, its a light t shirt material, not cozy thin sweater material as pictured so i was a bit disappointed at that but still a cute shirt, I still like it."
4.0,It’s nice but the chain broke kinda quick
4.0,This dress surprised me.  It's a cotton dress (for the most part).  It's very casual and the fabric is very light.  I like it.  It runs really small though.  I am 5'1 and weigh 135 and I ordered an XL and it fits well (kinda loose the way I wanted it). Nice summer dress; the price is perfect.
4.0,"I like the bracelet but I was not familiar with macramé bracelets.  I took “7-9 inches” to mean that the bracelet is adjustable within that range.  Apparently it means yoy will receive a bracelet sized somewhere in that range.  My bracelet won’t go smaller than 8”.  Seven would’ve been good, eight is loose but okay.  The stones are pretty and the bracelet seems well made, just the sizing is iffy."
4.0,Love the look but I can only wear for a few hours due to the weight.
4.0,Well constructed and handles great.
4.0,"The fabric is very soft, and it's easy to slip up to my face. The material does not stretch out after use, so the mask stays fitted, but My husband tried it on, but it was difficult for him to put it on. Don't recommend it for people with big heads."
4.0,"very comfortable and easy to clean, not too delicate."
4.0,"I ordered an XL based on my actual measurements in comparison with the size chart, but it's just too big. I may see if I can get it altered rather than exchange, but as is it just won't work. It's so cute, though!!! The material is swimsuit-ish, but now it a way that I think will be a problem."
4.0,takes a while to  get on  but  they help keep my legs from hurting  they are comfortable
4.0,"This wakes me up.  It's so amazing to me after years of buying the ""loudest"" alarm clocks to have them fail me, even with 5....  so I""m a heavy sleeper.<br /><br />The band broke though when I had it about two weeks.  Right at the clasp.  half the rubber that holds the bar that the little piece is that fits in the hole on the other side is split.  so it's held by half of that.  it has held so far...if it goes I'll be in trouble.  it's not a simple or separate band to just replace, it's part of the whole thing.<br /><br />So I love it more than I can explain, but I'm bummed it's broken."
4.0,I bought this for a good friend and she loves it!
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lbs and small chested and this fits exactly like it looks on the model. What keeps it from getting a full 5 stars is the material isn't necessarily cheap but wrinkles easily and definitely needs to be ironed every time I wash it. Also it's a little long. But it's as long as it says it is (I measured) and maybe I'm just a bit shorter than the model. Still love it and will be wearing it out to parties just a little more conservative than I thought it would be."
4.0,"These are nice joggers, but not what I had expected.  I thought they would be a soft sweatpant material, but they are more like a stretchy spandex material. They still look good and fit fine. I was just looking for a softer material. I wouldn't say that I have a particularly large bottom, but I feel they fit a little too tight in that area. I usually wear shirts that cover that area so it shouldn't be a problem."
4.0,"My son loves the size of this bag. It fits all his sports clothing, shoes, and ball. The side pockets for drinks is also an added bonus!<br />The only complaint he has stated is the draw string gets balled up sometimes making them uneven which effects the way the bag can be worn."
4.0,"The look stylish and the variety is nice, wish the pegs where a bit longer and thicker though."
4.0,Had to get get tailored
4.0,Not as soft thought would be like flannel pink
4.0,I used this as a summer cap. All is well. Thanks.
4.0,La mascara esta muy bien echa mejor q en la foto<br />Lo malo fue q al probarmelo los cabellos se le caian<br />Toda mi ropa y piso se llenaron  y fue la razon la q ya no lo quise usar y regresarla
4.0,"Great watch and band, but minute is hard to see if you aren't in bright sunlight"
4.0,Color is a bit strange more like a very very dark blue. Curious to see how they will wash. Legs are wider than my bf is used to but they were only $20 and the fit is good
4.0,My boyfriend really likes these shirts. They’re loose fitting and soft. They’re good to wear under another shirt because they don’t make you hot. The size chart is accurate.
4.0,would buy it again in a different color.
4.0,"I needed a head to toe body stocking I could paint (instead of painting my skin because that always flakes or smears off). I couldn't find a head to toe - inlcuding fingers one so I wound up piecing it together myself with gloves, tights and a nude crop top. These did the trick for my hands"
4.0,"They snag my bath towel, other than that, no real problem."
4.0,love this fleece
4.0,Dresses are cute. A bit long for my girls. Have to put a hem on them. Both sizes 12 and 7.
4.0,Some what small in the arms and very see through. I wear to bed for my husband. He loves it!
4.0,The straps & buckles could have been constructed better & made easier to adjust.
4.0,Gorgeous dress.  I bought an medium (size 8 ) and it fit has expected the only thing about the dress is that when it flared out it seemed a little long (see pics).The flare should be alittle higher so it doesnt look like you have a long torso. Look over the dress when you buy it because I found a few tiny holes. Overall worth the price because of the attention to detail. 😊
4.0,This product was pretty cool the only thing that got me to give it a four star was the top of the bottom grill the gold rubbed of and there is a brown spot where that happened
4.0,Great price and It worked for what I needed. Everyone at the party loved them. Will probably order at different one for the next holiday party.
4.0,"I previously gave Bonlavie a not so nice review because the bracelet was delivered late, and when received, was the wrong one. Furthermore, bracelet was a gift that the person knew about. Well Bonlavie went out of their way to rectify the problem, so I’m changing my review. Also the bracelet is very nice quality."
4.0,"I liked this insole, but it is not going to be one that I use on a regular basis.  I ordered these to go in a pair of boots that are just too uncomfortable without some extra help.  The increase is height was a big plus since I am short.  The insoles were comfortable enough but the front edge of them is somewhat thicker than I would like and you can feel a ridge from it that could become uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time.  This isn't a problem for me since I don't intend to wear these for extended lengths of time and will in the future wear thick socks with them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own."
4.0,I purchased this and the 90 Degree By Reflex 17&#34; Power Flex Capri. However this fit slightly bigger. The other Capri hugged my stomach a little better. I'm taking off a star because of the inconsistency. However it's very comfortable with minimal support and does not show skin when doing squats. I wear a medium and my waist is 30&#34;
4.0,I love it was a gift from my boyfriend
4.0,love this and it seems very nicely made....yellow is my littles fave color and it is hard to find sometimes so very pleased
4.0,This company was very prompt in sending the item unfortunately they did not fit but<br />it was the first time ordering this type of shoe and we were guessing on the size.<br />The return was super easy as well.
4.0,These are awesome but there is &#34;NO&#34; right or left. Kinda not cool but they look great anyway.
4.0,"Great shirt when it comes to style, but it runs way too big. I normally wear an L-XL, so I ordered an XL, and it’s way way too big. Returned to re-order a Medium."
4.0,Price is good but the sewn on ears fall off. Oh well. I will still but them again.
4.0,"Although I am a female (and this bag is described as a ""man's"" bag)...<br />I absolutely LOVE it so far! It is very sturdy and seems to be able to carry much more than just my laptop.<br />The additional pockets and compartments allow me space to store my work keys, badge, car keys, make up (lol! ) and a few other items with comfort & ease. I am more than pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"It was made of good material, soft and strong material. However, the straps were too long and provided very little support."
4.0,"Definitely not red, more reddish orange. Controls are easy enough. Mask stays in place well. The controls are almost a perfect length. Maybe a lil bit more wire to fit a tall man's body would be cool. But he's used to having tall man problems so he made due. Overall good product, especially for the price. Would have loved a more Red color to the lights, but still good."
4.0,I have big wrists and this watch is snug but not uncomfortably so.  Hopefully it will stretch just a little. Have gotten lots of compliments on it. I love it.
4.0,"Cute, but was to large. I had to return it. I hate it didn't work for me. Looks just like the picture."
4.0,"Love the shirt, just wish it was a little bigger"
4.0,This replacement band is not exactly high quality leather but it beats the cheap stainless band that this watch came with.<br />I appreciate that this option was available for purchase. It took a bit of effort to swap the pins but I could have used the ones it came with but they were not as substantial.<br />I would definitely buy this again but I would prefer a higher quality leather.
4.0,Very clean look. The towel bars snags a tie overall pretty good for the price.
4.0,"Scratch resistant, used to block computer glare."
4.0,"This dress !  I wore it for Date Night!  Many compliments!  I ordered the black dress with yellow sunflower.  The dress fits as expected It is floor length and the material is nice,  I'm 5'6  !/2"
4.0,"It's bigger than I thought it would be so it doesn't fit by bag right, but it's really pretty and is pretty flexible, it seems like it won't rip or break in anyway. I love how it looks on it's own, and it really stands out, so it kind of takes away from everything else."
4.0,Unacoo kids size large stripped pj's. Soft material and stretchy. Nice and comfortable and good quality. My only complaint is they are a little short like a few inches if your child is over 5'1 these may be short. Since they are pajamas I didnt care but they do run short. Cute navy stripes and the material is a medium weight. They did not shrink or fade after washing. Good kids pajamas.
4.0,The dress is adorable and has pockets a plus! The reason I did not give it a 5 star review is the dress smelled...it to me smelled like cigarettes. My husband thinks it may be the type of dye used. It smells fine after a wash. Other than that fits perfectly.
4.0,It wasn’t as big as I expected but it serves its purpose.
4.0,I like this a lot and it works with any top or outfit. It is just a little too thin if you are looking for something to keep you warm.
4.0,Was received damaged I contacted them & they told me to keep the old one & they would send a new one I'm still waiting on it patiently Bag itself is nice I'm sure once it is replaced I will be happy with it Hoping to get it soon
4.0,"Quite bright and kids liked them, we handed them out for Halloween.<br /><br />Just be aware 20-30% of the ones we ordered were dead on arrival between the two packages we ordered.  However, depending on the price this wouldn't keep me from purchasing them again."
4.0,"This is a very nice watch, especially for the unbeatable price. It looks great, with its vintage style and sleek design. It is also a great watch for smaller wrists, like me, being male, 5' 11"" and 125 lbs, you can imagine ive got some small wrists. If you are a big guy, you should probably go for a similar, larger model. despite my liking for this watches sleek attractive design, and simple, yet useful features, I have one disappointment: after wearing this watch for less than a week, a large scratch has already protruded across the screen (as a result of scraping the watch across the side of a pool) Overall, I love the look, feel, style and of course price of this watch, I just wish it were a little more durable."
4.0,"This card holder/wallet does what I need. I placed on credit card on the lowest sleeve, another card in the middle, two coffee shop stamp cards on the upper one. Also I carry about $60 cash and one more card. I place ID and public transportation electronic readable card on the transparent pocket. The wallet looks quite full and I do not feel like adding more cards. At least it carries everything which I need to carry day to day.<br /><br />The material is worth for what I've paid. This does not look like above $50 product, but at least it's not flimsy."
4.0,A little to old to be wearing these Jean Legging Thights Pants but I like them So I will wear them around the house with a long top.They are comfortable & cute on.I think younger women would love them I would recommend them to my friends
4.0,Feels a bit cheap but it is a beautiful necklace and I love the look and style of it.
4.0,good fit....
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my fiance. The look is great and it is of good quality, however it does require constant wear or else you have to rewind it. He doesn't mind though as he hates watches with batteries. I love how you can see the pieces in this watch, it makes it so much more unique!"
4.0,"The dress is lovely and nice and long for all taller friends (I'm 5'9""). I followed the measurement guide but it ended up being just a bit snug on the chest. I did fall right between the two sizes, so I opted to go down because I was worried it'd be too big and it'd look dumpy and I have a larger chest in general and things can quickly look baggy in the stomach area which is not flattering. I think if I had gone up it would have been fine. I ordered navy, and since it stretches in the chest area the fabric looks lighter. I just wore a cardigan and it was fine :) If you're in between sizes like me, I suggest going up."
4.0,"These socks are good for yoga since the honeycomb rubber soles really keep the foot in place on slippery surfaces. I also used them for running and they kept my feet from sweating too much.  The high back provides blister protection from tennis shoes that rub against the heel.  They run true to size and have the perfect amount of stretch. For reference, a size small fits US shoe sizes 6-8."
4.0,"As noted in several reviews, this is a light, polyester hoodie.  Good winter camo pattern, bright white with green needles, brown leaves, darker branches.  This is NOT a thermal layer.  Really light, low volume material you can roll up and carry in your pack for a quick cover-up when you are in snowy terrain.  Not intended to add warmth, but a great way to carry a different camo pattern without a lot of weight or volume.  I paid $18 and it was definitely worth it.  Based on reviews, I purchased it as a ""cover-up"" not a ""layer"".  Be aware, as with many products from China this is sized wrong.  I bought a 3XL size, when I normally wear XL.  It fits about like an XL.  I have had the same experience with previous camo purchases from China.  If you wear a 2XL or 3XL, you'll find this a tight fit, perhaps too small to use.  I'm 6 ft, 215 lbs., 45 in. chest, 35 in. waist, 35 in. sleeve.  I can use this over long underwear and a heavy shirt, perhaps a vest or light coat.  The hoodie would be a very tight fit over over any kind of bulky coat.  Be aware of the small size, but a pretty good product.  I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,"This is a nice, fairly dressy top, suitable for skirts or pants - dresses up a pair of white capris nicely."
4.0,It's a little bit tight but a very nice dress
4.0,After wearing a few pairs of Olukai's for a few years I switched to these Reefs. They seemed a bit narrow and short (not unlike many flip flops) but they broke in fairly quickly. I normally wear an 11.5 or 12 in Nikes and a 13 was the right fit with these (just like my Olukai's).
4.0,"This coat was an excellent value for the money. It was light, cozy and warm. It was below the knee and it didnt feel big or bulky. The hood cleverly looks like a big collar. It ran bigger than I thought based on reviews I went 2 sizes up when one would have been fine. I returned it due to being too large."
4.0,Finally I’ve found good quality shorts on amazon! I’ve never been able to find shorts that fit right. I like that these fit my hips on don’t give me a muffin top. I got a large Bc I knew I wouldn’t be able to find a right fit. They are a little big but if I would get a medium it’ll be too tight. I hope they shrink a little bit on the wash. I love the color and that they are not too short. And they have the right amount of distress.
4.0,"Ordered XL, and fit more like L.  Love the style, color, and knit.  Just go with a size larger."
4.0,"Overall I like the watchband, it stays secure, it is comfortable wear, and like the color.  The only shortcoming is the very plastic looking links where the band attaches to the watch. It is more a sporty band than a classy band, but overall it's nice."
4.0,Wish the seller would provide more than just size 7.  I need a 6.  The stone was a bit larger than I had wanted and the color was more blue than a tanzanite color.  But for the price I will keep and give as a gift to someone.
4.0,Very nice watch. Just didn’t fit me right
4.0,This watch faded to silver when it got wet..
4.0,"I'm 5'3 and weight around 125, I bought the x-small and it fits perfectly. Just don't dry it!!!!"
4.0,"Great glasses, but very hard to clean even with eye glass cleaner. Even the tiniest finger print requires serious elbow grease and still leaves a mark"
4.0,These are great. Wear easy and so beautiful!
4.0,SUPER CUTE just much larger then expected
4.0,just too sexy for me. i had to return<br />made well
4.0,The tie was fantastic and the handkerchief was a little undersized (9 1/2&#34; x 9 1/2&#34;) for some uses.  The quality of the material was very good and the cufflinks matched the set well.
4.0,Pretty colors. Fits well and soft material.
4.0,"Everything fine so far, except silver ring is having a bit of flaw and another ring is white with green glitter instead of mint green with glitters."
4.0,"Very pretty, fashionable and trendy!!"
4.0,Bueno y seguro
4.0,has done the job.. keeps my earrings on and is working as well as I had expected them to work!
4.0,"Comfortable shoe, stable not mushy like running shoes, unfortunately one of the lace eyelets tore off while lacing the shoes only the second time wearing them."
4.0,"The skirt is definitely not the best quality, but it’s what I expected for the price. Although the fabric is very thin, the elastic band isn’t flimsy and I love the print and pleats."
4.0,I GOT THE SHIRT IN SUPPORT OF MY SISTERS GREAT GRAND SON WHO JUST STARTED U OF CHICAGO LAB SCHOOL TO MATCH HIS SCHOOL SHIRT HE WAS HAPPY TO SEE ME WITH IT.
4.0,"Came in a quality box, ordered from a different dealer that had less quality to compare and this was the best of the two.  However all seemed a bit smaller than the movie portrayal. Still fits good on the dashboard like in the movie."
4.0,"I love this bra! Definitely take the advice of reviewers though and size up! I'm a 38D normally, and I went with a 42D. I even have to use the extender that comes with on the 42D."
4.0,"The top looked good but I feel runs somewhat larger. I bought XL, my normal size but had to return it as was too big."
4.0,"Comfortable, the design is more supportive than standard &#34;side attached&#34; nursing bras."
4.0,They are so pretty but too big for my daughter.
4.0,"love them, washes well and feels better after fabric softner applied. Will order again."
4.0,"Really comfy, kinda thin material but fits great."
4.0,He loves it and the pocket aka month holds his toy car perfectly
4.0,"These are super comfortable. The insides are soft and soothing to touch. And, they are decently warm. I could still stand a little warmer, but for normal cold days, these are great. I only gave 4 stars because 1) they are thicker and don't allow for easily operating tech, etc., and 2) I used them in super-slushy snow and they didn't keep my fingers warm. I will say that my fingers remained dry though and the cold was because of conductivity and not wetness."
4.0,But please be aware that these will not work with certain models of Raybans. They are just too small to slip over the ends of the ear pieces. Just way too tight to work.
4.0,I liked the construction of it but it was to large. I sent it back but it was made well and I would order again.
4.0,Its kool for the price.  All diamonds are in place. Does shine.
4.0,"These socks are comfortable and are supportive but, they are thick enough that they don't work so well with my dress shoes that I need to wear for work. I am wearing them right now but it's my day off and wearing jeans and sneakers. Nothing wrong with the quality of the sock at all, just too think for my dress shoes."
4.0,They came fairly quickly I look nice but I did notice that after a few wears it starts to tarnish
4.0,"Good jewelry for child. I ordered this because I only needed a dollar more for free shipping and it's very obvious why it's only $1.49. Don't get me wrong, it's very pretty and at good lengths, but it is very obvious that it is inexpensive."
4.0,"It's a very pretty festive band, just not as vibrant as I hoped it would be like the photo they show. Still comfortable and definitely large enough to fit my wrist!"
4.0,"My god honest raw option? It’s soft and comfy but it does jack nothin for the girls on top. It looks like a sleep nursing bra I have when I put it on. Which after having a kid I don’t expect the girls to be perky anyways but I was hoping it would be a bit more sexy for lingerie for shape. Oh well, at least the underwear is super comfy and cute. Don’t buy if you want the models boobs, you will be let down. Unless your blessed with great boobs then you might be fine but I don’t know how it will support you correctly to be honest."
4.0,Nicely put together.
4.0,"The weight is terrific for winter.  They are comfortable and look polished,  too."
4.0,"These are very pretty sheer hipster panties. There is a stretch lace trim around the waist and leg openings that lays really flat so no panty lines when wearing these. The crotch has a cotton lining. The panty material is a very sheer mesh as shown in the product photos. While they look nice on, I don't expect these to hold up to everyday wear since they are so thin. And what is missing from the product photos is the 3"" long fabric content and care label that hangs down the back -  it definitely ruins the look since it hangs so far down and is glaringly obvious. You'll want to cut that off ASAP. Otherwise these are pretty and nice for special occasions."
4.0,I like the look and the way it feels when I wear it. The only complaint I have is that over time it does start to change colors underneath I guess from sweat and getting wet when washing dishes and stuff like that. The top side is still silver. It’s worth the money and worth buying if your not wearing it every day like I do and keep it from getting wet. If you do that then it’s great.
4.0,I love the color and cut of this shirt.  I would have liked a little more length but overall happy with this.  Had a weird chemical smell when I first opened the package up but after a wash I haven't smelled it.  Does need ironing after washing.
4.0,"This is really cute but wow, that lace up front is lowwww cut! For that reason, I probably wouldn't wear it without a swimsuit or a sports bra underneath.<br />The cut is really cute though. The material seems to be of good quality and it's nice and soft."
4.0,"Gave ot to my Mom and she really likes it.  However,it does do premature opening.  The button is easily depressed and it pops open."
4.0,"I love these...they're so soft and light, breathable and perfect for everyday use, hiking, running, the gym. My only downside is that pads/pantyliners don't seem to adhere to the underwear- like at all."
4.0,True to size. I like this type of sweater. I wish they had more colors!
4.0,"Used on my trip to Italy. The wallet was small enough where I could hide it under my shirt, and it didn't look awkward. Safe way of keeping my most important items hidden. Would recommend."
4.0,It's  a little short for the shorts otherwise great. I would prefer longer 🩳 shorts . Colors are very bright.  Love it
4.0,Super linda y buena calidad pero corre la talla un poquito pequeña<br />Compré M
4.0,My gf used my account to order these. She seemed pleased with them.
4.0,I bought these to wear around the house and my property. They are comfortable but too short for my liking so I decided to return them.
4.0,This is a really beautiful necklace. Hoping it will last a while
4.0,"This does run small.  I ordered a 2xl because of other reviews and it fit great for the lost part.  I am only 5 ft 3, so the dress hit the floor.  I still need to hem it,  but when I do I know it will work great.  I love how flowy it is and how it fits me. The bottom hem looks unfinished anyway,  so it doesn't  bother me much that I need to hem it anyway. You always take a risk when buying online.  Had I spent $30 on it,  I may have been more disappointed in the fact thst the bottom looks unfinished.  I did have the opportunity to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The discount is obviously nice as you could imagine, but I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review, and in fact I do not leave a positive review unless it is deserved."
4.0,Very cute earrings for Valentine's Day.  The reason why I only gave it a 4-star was because the crystal rhinestone does not sparkle.  Looks more like plastic.  But that's okay because the red heart sparkles a lot!  I received a lot of compliments when I wore them.
4.0,"I liked the color selection..<br />Wasn't sure if it would fit.. it took a few tries.. but.. a few days later it disconnected form the sense..<br />Comfortable fits, easy to clean..<br />But i still like the item.."
4.0,Good fit reasonably priced
4.0,Cute dress! I am 5.6 and 135lb dress was too wide on the waist. The length was just below the knees.
4.0,Love the fit and look just wish it was available in precious medals
4.0,The bathing suit fit great!  My daughter is out in the sun at the beach or on the lake most of the summer so thus really helped keep the sunburn away.  The hat was a no go though.
4.0,"Item was ok. I did request to return it, not because of the quality but because of my own preference. I usually wear all real gold Jewelry and the color was a bit off so I didn’t like the look when pairing it with my daily necklaces. Overall nothing wrong with the necklace, just didn’t do it for me."
4.0,"I bought this to put my homemade perfumed wax in it and it works great.  Because of the filigree, the fragrance is free to roam."
4.0,"Pros: Nice material, length and love the pockets!<br /><br />Cons: Run small and wish they were more high waisted too."
4.0,Pearls smaller than expected.
4.0,Love the compression and style. Very annoyed that two pairs of socks on my pack are much smaller than the others
4.0,i like it but it did not fit
4.0,This is my second purchase.  I love this keychain but I have to super glue the crystals back on because they tend to fall off. It is very heavy so its nice.  Love it.
4.0,I am 5’2 156lbs the size XL fits perfectly. Color is not as shown in picture! It is mode peach than dusty pink
4.0,"Pros:<br />the sizing matches the size chart provided<br />roomy in the torso and leg but not weirdly baggy<br />leg ends right at the top of my foot (I'm 5'2"")<br />can be worn with the tie in the front or back<br />lightweight linen is great for summer<br />has pockets<br /><br />Cons:<br />has a hole in one pocket, after just a couple wears<br />thin straps (just personal preference; they function just fine)"
4.0,"Looks great! Really a pretty dress. My only problem with it is the zipper. It’s really hard to zip up, even my daughter had a problem helping me with it."
4.0,They are made with quality beads and arived on time
4.0,Super cute! It's noisy for sure so keep that in mind if you're annoyed by that kind of thing. It's not super sturdy so be careful with it.
4.0,"This suit is beautiful, I loved everything about it except the size was about two sizes to small"
4.0,Very pleased with this product will buy again in the future
4.0,Super cute but turned my ears green.
4.0,Like the shirt. Great buy.
4.0,Nice sweatshirt. Loose enough for layering.
4.0,Serves it's purpose.
4.0,"We went to Vegas this past weekend and I can attest myself that this little box is a must if you are to go to any casino and play for any length of time.<br /><br />LEAVE THE KEYS AT HOME - can’t stress this enough lol it will make you mad at first when you start stuffing bills but then you’ll be proud of yourself for growing a pair and putting away the money you actually won.<br /><br />I lost money in Vegas when it was all said and done, but even so I managed to save about $200 - money I would’ve for sure spent if it wasn’t locked up. So I guess it paid for itself on our trip.<br /><br />My only gripe is that I’m not sure how more than about 10-12 bills could fit in this thing..I folded everything up correctly and even so I found it tough to stuff bills after a few.<br /><br />Anyways, get this box if you gamble. The price tag is well worth it because unless you plan I’m taking a good sturdy screwdriver or a cutter to this thing it will not open lol it’s very high quality."
4.0,"I'd rather they just made the original sunglasses more durable, but.........As with the replacement temple pads, seems too expensive for a couple of dinky rubber things, but cheaper than a new pair of sunglasses, so I'm glad to have them. Appreciate Amazon having these available."
4.0,"I bought this purse and the matching wallet 2 years ago. I'm not the most gentle on my purses, so I knew it wasn't going to be perfect forever. But after two years, the material on the handles cracked a bit and a few spots have worn a bit, but nothing bad and great for 2 years of wear. I love this purse so much. Its so roomy and everything else is holding up so well. I still get compliments on it all the time. By far my favorite purse."
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Looks and feels well made. Large enough to be clear what it is while small enough to get away with every day wear. Only knocked one star because I wear a size 8 ring on my ring finger and it's too loose so I have to wear on my middle finger.
4.0,Light and nice design/color.
4.0,"I really liked the style and colors of this swim top.  I bought a size larger than I normally would and it was too large.  I normally wear a small or medium in Misses and a medium/ large in Juniors sizes.  I bought a large and it is a little big, I would definitely go with a medium next time.  It does still work, but its a bit baggy for a swim top."
4.0,Sweater was originally bought for my adult son but he hated the tightness & length of the turtleneck. The turtleneck is 10 inches long and has to be folded 3 times making it really tight. Since the price was really good I kept the sweater for myself and it's okay on me.
4.0,"I gave 4 stars only for the fact that the ball on the top of the hat is not really a ball. I had to med with it for quite a while before I could actually make it look semi-round. Even so, I really like it."
4.0,"More unusual, which I like. Also interesting color combos, esp for Spring. Good price."
4.0,Only use the for a week  Kind a thin but no problems with it.
4.0,this was a gift for my husband.  He was looking for an RFID card case/ wallet to safely hold his cards and ID.  It is not really set up to carry a lot of cash (who does this today anyway) but is more than adequate - would buy it again
4.0,I really like this belly button ring looks just like the photo. Glad I brought it and you can't really beat the price
4.0,Earrings are beautify and of great quality - just a little too big for its type of earrings.
4.0,Very much worth it
4.0,These are a good quality for the price point.  It is slightly less dense than the other ones I have.  But still felt as warm as they do.
4.0,"I have enjoyed biking in this jacket. It's a good weight for spring & fall and fits comfortably on the arms & shoulders. One surprise: although there is some elastic at the waist, the jersey is cut to hang kind of loose around the midsection, at least on me. (I am a 34&#34; waist.) So it doesn't have the trim fit of most jerseys I am familiar with."
4.0,the only complaint is they are not dark enough
4.0,Nice shirt - a trifle thick for tucking.  Washes well.
4.0,"Very stylish; however, the lenses are so dark that unless you are in a very sunny environment; it is difficult to see."
4.0,I got this for a baby shower and everyone liked it.
4.0,I  5 foot 10 and they're nice and long I just a little small but I just started waving to lose those few pounds so I can fit into it fabrics nice it is line halfway so you don't have to worry about a slip
4.0,Great belt but didn’t realize it was so narrow.
4.0,nice fit; good quality.
4.0,A little small even for a small/medium but works to wear it inside as a fashion hat or outside winter hat. Protects hair and doesn’t slip much.
4.0,Ordered based on the size chart which for me was a xxx-l at 5'9 165 lbs and a 36DDD its a great fit.
4.0,Great heavy solid quality but paint chips off once applied
4.0,Very nice carry on!!  Love the color
4.0,"The dress is cute, colors good and fits good."
4.0,"All the other reviews I read before buying this said it was poorly sewn and fell apart quickly, but I decided the cool factor of reversible sequins was worth the risk. I wasn't surprised when several stitches popped the first time I wore it. I don't have a sewing machine, but I was able to easily sew it back together by hand. Minus 1 star for having to do a repair, but I love this thing."
4.0,"Me encanto la tela me fascina<br />Buena cálida, tenía temor que no me gustara<br />Pero todo excelente, Gracias"
4.0,"Not as fantastical as the jeans, but I'm still pretty jazzed."
4.0,"They fit good and they look good, but they rip kinda easy. Just minor tears though."
4.0,"They're pretty nice quality! Their ""set"" size is around maybe a 6-7 (I'm not very familiar with ring sizing so take this with a grain of salt), Some are kinda fragile though so be careful with how much you bend them, I accidentally broke one. Otherwise they're a good deal"
4.0,they were perfect for my wedding however I always have trouble with length of chain..I did have to put extenders on...wish it came with a longer chain.
4.0,"The wallet is pretty good, however it has to little quantity of images on the amazon web site, which means you can not see all details you want. In my case, I thought that the card holder was separete from the wallet, which isn't like that."
4.0,"Nice stretchy cotton with lycra in it. Probably is dry cleaning only but a beautiful dress, for the price. Love the style."
4.0,"Dress is exactly what I had hoped, good quality garment, and it's so adorable. I usually wear a medium but China sizes can run small so I got a large and it fits well, partly because it has an elastic waistband, so that's a great feature. The fabric is a little itchy, but that's expected with this kind. The buttons on the top bodice are a bit far apart, so you may need some wardrobe tape. And the neck can be tight when buttoned all the way up like Wednesday had hers, so keep that in mind when choosing a size. For length, I'm 5'2"" and the dress lands about 6"" above the floor. Overall I'm very happy with it and plan to wear it as a regular part of my wardrobe."
4.0,Great boot for the price! They seem to run a little on the large side. I usually wear a 10 1/2 but I needed a 10 in these. Other than getting the sizing right the boots are great.
4.0,"Nice glasses,very comfortable."
4.0,"Really good, the strings I wish had a little clamp for tightness but tying it is okay too."
4.0,This product no fit with my size is a little big
4.0,My daughter loves the leotard. The only issue we had is it came a day later than it said it would come and my daughter was looking forward to wearing it to her class.
4.0,"Fashionable sun glasses with a cool lettering design. They are fun! Look fabulous on me, shipped nicely with no damage."
4.0,Did the job. Great thickness. Kept our hands warm for a full day of snow tubing.
4.0,"Definitely looks like the picture. Shiny. Seems like it runs maybe narrow and long. The material itself is not really super stretchy, it does stretch a little bit. The waist band stretches a lot but from a narrow base, it may be tight on some bodies.<br /><br />There is definitely a plastic like feel to the material but its glossy so that is to be expected."
4.0,Love the design! Tissue paper was struck to glue and couldn't be removed without damaging.
4.0,I love these sunglasses...
4.0,"It is a super cute maxi skirt! I will only be wearing it as a swim cover, as the slits are VERY, VERY and I mean VERY HIGH! Like borderline inappropriate for a mother (which I am) if used as anything other than a swim cover. When twisting/turning you can actually see your swim bottoms at the top of the slit. Also, the middle section (between the slits) isn't sewn in evenly, so one side shows more skin than the other, which is totally fine with me, since it's just for lounging around our pool. Yes, it would be cute (for any age!) for a beach trip, public pool outing or a pool party! I will do my best to get a photo posted for visual reference! Oh and, I am just under 5'7 and I really wish it had another inch or two on it! So basically, it just grazes the top of my feet."
4.0,"Spenco makes very good supportive slippers. These are very comfortable. I need arch support and a heel cup and these provide both very nicely. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the upper section - the only drawback in the design - is a little snug towards the toe. I have high arches and, while it has enough give for me, it could be better designed."
4.0,"Cute bracelet.  Bought it for a friends' Christmas gift.  A little shorter than expected, so I kept it for myself."
4.0,"Very cute, great price for two of these!"
4.0,"Felt like they were made stout. They were just alittle to big for my head, but I give to my buddy and he wears them all the time"
4.0,"I love the way this dress fits, probably because I ordered a size larger than normal (thanks to the reviews I read).  It is a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Really nice feel & Great price - but color is very bright! I would definitely say these are a jade color since I purchased another pair of Power flex style that are longer than these but that are also called jade. However, they are more of a teal and l prefer those. Even though the colors are both listed as jade & look the same in the descriptions they are worlds apart when you get them! So be forewarned. This pair is the lighter/brighter of the two & is more the color of a true jade stone you would find in jewelry. Both very nice just different colors people should be aware of."
4.0,Bought these pants for my daughter to wear with her softball jersey. They fit great at the waste but the cuff around the calf muscle is a little lose. Otherwise a great product for a great price.
4.0,it looks really warm. and looks cute.True to size.
4.0,"I bought these for my husband. He wears a size medium but after reading reviews and looking over the questions I knew I should get a size larger. They come in a pack of four in a nice gift box. My husband said they are soft and semi comfortable but very tight. These fit more like between a small and medium. I'm giving them four stars because he says he does like them, but they are pretty snug."
4.0,The color isn’t really gray. It’s more of a tan gray but still a nice sweatshirt. Not thick but comfy.
4.0,"The set is lovely, the bracket is a little snug. But I think it will be ok. The packaging was nice."
4.0,was a  little long  but nice !!!
4.0,"I'm a large, ordered a large, and it fits true to size.  This is a more fitted shirt, not meant to be loose- super cute tucked into high waisted jean shorts :)"
4.0,I love these earrings! I've bought a bunch of these in different colors.  I'm giving them 4 stars because about half of them are too loose and they have fallen out :( they are very unique and look very nice on though
4.0,Very impressed. They fit and I am not worried about loosing them!
4.0,My daughter bought this necklace in Lord and Talyors for $70.for me on Mother's Day The only reason I return it was because the chain was too short.<br />Finding this was great and way less. The only complaint I have is the back is stamped where the holes were for the stones. So two<br />of the stones are not as bright as the others but not that  noticeable. The chain is 18 inches which was perfect. Very cute necklace!!
4.0,Bought it as a gift for my brother. It seems well made and he likes it so I'm happy.
4.0,"It's REALLY STIFF.......I JUST need to wear it, to loosen it up!"
4.0,"Review of:  Havana Breeze Men's Regular-fit Silk Cotton Polo Shirt, Mocha M<br /><br />With a cut that is perfectly loose fitting and ‘classy’ enough to be worn untucked, a fabric that is as smooth, comfortable and lightweight, this Havana Breeze Regular-fit Silk/Cotton Polo Shirt will quickly become, as it has for me, your ‘go-to’ Polo shirt for everyday wear.<br /><br />My first impression upon opening the package was how soft and ‘silk-like’ the material was.  It simply has a nice ‘feel’ to it … soft and comfortable.<br /><br />The second impression was how nice it looked.  The horizontal weaving of the fabric adds some great looking texture and interest to the shirt that may ‘flat-looking’ shirts don’t have.  The extra ‘fancy’ stitching found around the shirt’s collar and sleeves is a very nice touch that adds a bit of class, a bit of extra detail to the shirt.  The squared off bottom of the shirt makes this Polo shirt one that you can wear tucked in or untucked and look good either way.<br /><br />The third impression was after trying it on; the fit, I found, was just right.  For a Polo shirt, especially one that will be worn quite a bit in the warmer months, I prefer a looser fit.  A fit that isn’t constricting at all, a fit that doesn’t ‘get in the way’ when moving around.  That’s what the Havana Breeze shirt was designed to give and that is what it delivers.  If you are looking for a tighter fitting Polo shirt you would most likely want to order one size down.  I’ve included a couple of pictures that show the shirt, a size Medium, up against a yard-stick to give you an idea of size.<br /><br />Finally, the Havana Breeze Polo shirt is machine washable.  Cold water and a delicate cycle got the job done for me.  It did need ironing, on a cotton setting, to take out the wrinkles to the point where it didn’t look slightly crumbled but that didn’t take a long time to do.  Still, I had hoped to be able to wash-and-wear without the extra effort; I may try hand washing next time.<br /><br />As of the time I write the review (late December 2019) I don’t see a price listed on the product page so I can’t comment on that but I can say that, if the price range is acceptable to you when it comes out, then you should most certainly keep this shirt on you wish list."
4.0,"I love these shoes! I’m an old soul, I had these my mom had these so why not my kids too??? Bought them for my son, they’re a bit wide, but children grow so that’s no big deal. More importantly, the shoes keep my sons feet flat. He tends to walk on his toes without the shoes so they help him to use his entire foot to walk. And they’re super cute! He has them in black and white. Definitely worth it!"
4.0,Tried it on. Seems substantial (not see through) and well made. Have not washed it yet so I do know its longevity.
4.0,"Mask looks exactly like how it does in the pictures, but the eyeholes don't give you any peripheral vision, not a very good mask for dark places."
4.0,I bought the tie-dye one and it's not as bright as the picture but it's still colorful and the only color that looks a little muddy is the yellow but it's comfortable!
4.0,The bottom does not have much stretch
4.0,"Not anti fog, I do wish the sides were a little deeper but good value still!"
4.0,The largest size was pretty small!
4.0,"Just love these earrings. Unfortunately, during the first wear, some of the tassles unraveled.  I was able to salvage them and am still happy with my purchase. Macy's has the exact pair for double the price."
4.0,"Comfortable,  great fit"
4.0,"It’s very nice quality. Well made and quite thick compared to Carters and even Hanna Anderson so I feel like my kid is warm enough. I’m taking off a star for two reasons.:<br />1. It’s kind of hard to get on - maybe this is because it’s a tight weave or a thicker fabric, but it takes noticeably longer to shimmy legs and arms through.<br />2. The mittens fold over isn’t big enough to keep wiggly fingers in. The mittens were the whole reason I chose this product. And throughout the night I’m stuffing my baby’s hands back in during feedings. This doesn’t happen with Carters fold-over mittens. (See pics)<br />Overall a nice investment. I think the quality justifies the price."
4.0,Bought to wear with leggings and it is perfect for that!!  Comfortable!
4.0,Love it fits smaller than pictured. But awesome blouse comfortable!
4.0,Easy to pull up.  Fashionable and breathable.
4.0,"These fit-overs are perfect and actually fit over my glasses nicely.  The directions on how to measure were great,"
4.0,"It's pretty, and it's holding up to the washing machine. It's not the softest material though, so 4/5. My daughter gets so many compliments while wearing it. Shes's 2.5 and the 2t fit great."
4.0,"Light weight hoodie- perfect for summer evenings and fall transition.. Marled fabric makes top easy to match with various colors.. Olive green has a heathered gray threading that mixes colors subtly- pairs with khaki, monochromatics, camo, cream, white, etc. Love the length! perfect for those who are shorter! At 5’2” (152, 36C, 31x29, 40+yr old) it is hard to find adequate fit thru the chest and not look like a disheveled mess drowning in fabric mess! This has a small inline taper from armpit to waist- eliminating a boxy appearance.. Mechanics of zipper work well and allow easy on/off access. Nice size pocket for cell phone or keys..<br /><br />I categorize this for daily fashion vs. athletic attire. Nice to throw over a Tee or tank but, can stand alone on its own just fine. A price point of $25 is reasonable for the quality to last a season or two.. Fabric is soft without stitching flaws or loose threads.. being a synthetic, Machine wash on cold and line dry only to avoid any shrinkage.<br /><br />Take note: measurements provided online are NOT 100% accurate! Ordered XL = 49.6” per listing- yet, actual top measures 45.3” on top received. I suggest ordering what would be your regular size and error on sizing up. (Per size chart provided I would need a M/L but, I ordered XL like usual and glad I did.. otherwise, it wouldnt have fit!!) Be aware + adjust accordingly. Hoping this info can help in your decision… Stay safe!"
4.0,"Nice quality, sturdy. Folds up and down easily to store flat and save space. One in my set of two had the handle stitched crooked--still functional and I didn't have time to contact the company for a replacement. Wish it had been replaced for one that is perfect but it works fine so I use as is."
4.0,I bought this for a destination wedding in Italy. It came just in time. The material is nice and I did receive a lot of compliments. I defintely plan to wear it again for another fancy occasion.
4.0,Very soft and cute.  However mine had a couple of holes in the pants on the seam. Not a huge deal since I can easily sew it and it's only pjs.
4.0,Very sparkly but a little small so really can't tell they are angel wings!
4.0,Cute but does not have the gold ornaments on the side as shown.
4.0,"Sequins larger than expected, but really fun to wear!"
4.0,Love the fit and price! Never ever slip off. After a few months of regular use holes started to appear in the toes so I’m giving them 4/5 stars.
4.0,Well made shirt for the price . Order your regular size
4.0,"I returned these, felt like they were tight in the waist and loose in the legs. I don’t normally have that issue with other joggers and did not feel like I could change sizes to make it right. The quality seemed nice."
4.0,Thank you 👍🏻
4.0,"I bought a small for my size 10 (kids size), 85 pound  son. And they're going to fit around the waist without any problem. Not really sure I've ever seen man as thin as my very skinny child. His size 10 skinny jeans require a belt.<br />I got a large for my 31 inch waist husband and it's going to be snug. I'm smaller than he is and they dig into my love handles. So if you have love handles maybe order up a size. :)"
4.0,"Absolutely love the shirt, band around pants are extremely tight. If sold separately Id buy another shirt!"
4.0,"Very pretty shirt, I ordered a large and it fits loose."
4.0,"When the came in the mail today, I was surprised at how small the heads were.  Honestly, I thought that they would be larger, but when I read the description, I realized I should have scrutinized the description.more closely."
4.0,Good quality & value.  These straps did have a strong rubber type smell but I let them air out & the smell dissipated over time.
4.0,"These are super cute and I've gotten lots of compliments on them. I love the oversized style because it physically blocks out so much sunlight. However, they're made of cheap and brittle-feeling lightweight plastic (they feel cheaper than gas station sunglasses), and they probably won't last very long, and the gold-painted squares on the sides have already started chipping away."
4.0,Great for the price. Best deal you’ll find. Great along my buddy’s little waist (32lbs) but a little too baggy around the legs (at least compared to pairs he’s had in the past)
4.0,"Great, lightweight fabric for spring and summer but needs to be ironed each time."
4.0,"Love the purse, perfect size & appreciate that the inside is open to carry more, rather than with dividers. Still missing cross-body strap, thus only 4 stars."
4.0,Perfectly.<br />Put on and go
4.0,people think I am gay because i wear such a small watch. However it is a classic and works perfect.
4.0,The wallet inserts are extra roomy therefore it can hold all my things....Love it.
4.0,THE MUDDER 360 IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND WILL WORK GREAT FOR ME!
4.0,This product is excellent quality.  I especially like that they do not have long knitted shaft protectors.  The only challenge is that the driver cover does not fit over the 460 size driver heads.
4.0,"Light and breezy midi dress. Functional buttons perfect for nursing mama's, like me.<br />Only down side is the buttons kind of make the front bunch. If you're super busty, this dress is not for you."
4.0,"The dress fit fine, has stretch in the material . It is wrap style at the top, very low cut, might need to pin it. Runs a tad big"
4.0,"I like the shirt and all but..... it's not the dark royal blue color advertised. It's more of a faded blue, still a great shirt though."
4.0,"Look exactly as pictured. Haven't worn them yet, looking forward to"
4.0,Son loves it. Washes well.
4.0,Comfortable but not the definition I expected.
4.0,"Ordered a size up. Fits well, although doesn't close in the front for me.  It looks just like the picture.  Good buy!"
4.0,"Adorable aprons. I can tell I will use these all the time. They appear to be water resistant. I mainly bought these so grease won’t pop my skin or clothing when cooking. They aren’t a thick linen, very thin, but they make up for it in aesthetic. I recommend if you’re on a budget."
4.0,"Nice, inexpensive watch.  Much bigger/larger than I anticipated."
4.0,"Very adorable, I wish the writing was not so fuzzy tho. Then it'd be perfect."
4.0,I thought the lens size would have been larger but it wasn't Still glasses look good and work great
4.0,Looks nice on my bracelet
4.0,I am 5’2 and the large fit well but my legs are shorter than average so I might sew it to make it shorter
4.0,It is really big but very cute and works well as a cover up.
4.0,Overall very nice product. Runs a little small. Purchased an XL. I'm 6'6 210lbs and the sleeves seem to be better than most shirts or jackets I buy. The waistline falls in question on if it will shrink a lot. Hopefully it does not because it seems almost short in general. Overall for price and sizing I would be likely to purchase again if needed.
4.0,Nice luggage but a little on the thin side.  We will see how it holds up over time.
4.0,My daughter loved it 💖<br />She loves Harry Potter and she has that quote on her wall :)<br />My only complaint was the words were a little hard to read but otherwise Beautiful 🙂
4.0,Quirky ornament and clock in the living room.
4.0,Fits great in the waist but alittle tight over my chest . I just unbutton and wear a white tank top under.
4.0,The dress was just not for me but it was made very nice and then material was very comfortable.
4.0,"The fabric is very thin, comfortable but I recommend wearing a slip."
4.0,"These are soooo cute. They are bigger than i expected but that turned out just fine because they look very nice in my ears. However, the posts separate very easily from the stud. I've already broken two pairs."
4.0,"Super cute and simple necklace, although the chain was a little cheep and easily broken"
4.0,"Cute top , but should have gone a size bigger."
4.0,"Exactly as the picture shows. Some people complained they got pink ones? Mine were red. The quality was good for such a low price. The only issue is that they make your entire field of vision red. They don't block the sun at all. They good for style, but useless on a sunny day. Plus, it's risky to drive with them too."
4.0,"Somewhat large in the bottom flowy part, but I got the mint color and it is striking. With a cute hat and some mirrored sunnies, I'm good."
4.0,they are very short even on kids
4.0,Nice dash of sparkle!
4.0,"I ordered a medium, I should of ordered a large. I like the print on the dress overall and since it is a little snu g on me it feels like a body con dress.I am very satisfied with this dress. I have such a hard time finding a nice dress that fits in all the right areas"
4.0,"For the price, these are the best gloves I've ever owned. They don't cost much at all, so they aren't finely finished or fancy, and some threads are loose, but they do the job.<br /><br />I worked in a cold climate where my hands would get cold and messy, so I wanted some gloves that would keep my hands warm, allow me to grip with my finger tips, and that I would not regret getting dirty. These fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Love them!"
4.0,Very comfy pants. The material was a little thinner than I expected though. Was looking to replace my Victoria's Secret yoga pants with these but they are a bit thin.
4.0,"I'm 39 and have plantar fascitis on my right foot, in the heel and underneath.  I didn't want to spend this kind of money on slippers, and they are not the most attractive.  They do help my feet a lot.  I wear them everywhere in the house now, and after only a week I am noticing a difference in my foot pain.  I don't have the pain nearly as bad overall, and it is totally gone when I'm walking in the house.  I am very happy I bought them.  They r warm and made well, just not very attractive.  I also would like it if the back was a little taller to keep my feet held in when walking."
4.0,"I was very pleased with the fit and the way it looked. I am a larger woman (5'5&#34;, 220lbs) and I like the coverage it gives me. It looks pretty on and the black is slimming."
4.0,Even though it is not an original it looks good with the rest of the other Pandora charms.
4.0,Easy to set the security code.
4.0,The belt is great and worked perfectly. It was a little big on me but Thera was an easy fix to making it fit me right. I do love this belt it looks so cute! And seems to be made pretty good to
4.0,"So comfortable and flattering to my shape! I would give 5 stars but the fabric is on the sheer side. Whenever I wear it I can see my tattoos through the material, so I just make sure to wear dark undies 🤣"
4.0,"They aren't bad..great actually! However, I could use a size down just in the waist area. They fit snug (as yoga pants should) from the ankle through the entire leg, but I have to constantly pull them up as I'm working out"
4.0,I like this purse it's not to big or small just the right size it do have a little red in it and the downside no shoulder strap
4.0,Extremely comfy but I don't like the drawstring placement
4.0,"Great for a light weight load, 10 lbs or less.  Easy to carry when not in use."
4.0,"Love this dress, however I wish the sleeves were a little longer. They are shorter than 3/4 length."
4.0,My husband loves his watch and wears it with pride
4.0,I'm 5'5&#34; tall and this dress is very long on me. I wore it with platform sandals and that worked well.<br />I received SO many compliments on it. This dress was very comfortable and adorable.
4.0,"The softest leggings ever. Does not have a color gradient like in the picture, just solid pink, but gorgeous and comfortable nevertheless."
4.0,Liked the overall style but was way too large. I bought a small and looked like I was a child wearing grown up clothing. I am 5'5 115lbs for reference and bought a size small
4.0,"What an interesting piece!<br /><br />It definitely looks more expensive than its price and is a pleasure to look at. The dragon is not very distinguishable but that doesn't bother me. I feel it adds to the charm. It glows in the dark - unsure what pieces glow but I was fascinated when I woke up in the middle of the night and saw moving pieces dancing in the darkness like a soaring dragon!<br /><br />I do not like that you have to wind frequently as I am not used to that. Plus they warn you that if you over wind it'll break the mechanism.<br /><br />Love it.<br /><br />Update: after about a month, this watch had trouble with keeping accurate time. Time to retire it. It was fun."
4.0,The zipper is backward and the size that is recommended to go one size up is a good recommendation.
4.0,A bit small but still fit. love the color and shape of the top.  I wish the back had a bit more staying power as I am large chested and it was riding up a bit.
4.0,Adorable ring!
4.0,For the price - GREAT!
4.0,"Ordered yesterday,  had one day shipping for a gold and white party, not bad.... I was a little scared after reading other reviews from other sellers, but I like it. I ordered two sizes up and happy I did. If you'reyou're a large you may want to order an extra, extra large. Here is my first try on- will be taking to the cleaners to get pressed before the gold and white party. Happy with the out come."
4.0,"Nice but still too short for a costume, at least for what we wanted. For something a little more private it would be good."
4.0,This dress worked perfectly for a wedding I attended. I needed a top that had coverage but also allow me to nurse as needed. I received many compliments. I added a skinny belt around the waist to add a little more definition.  I loved that it had pockets.
4.0,"This is a gorgeous, sheer and sexy piece of lingerie.<br /><br />The feel of the fabric is soft and breathable. The accompanying panties are comfortable and fit nicely.<br /><br />The ensable together is breathtaking, definitely will light a fire in the bedroom with it on.<br /><br />I am a size 12 and this fit me with no problem. It's body hugging and sensual. It made me feel like a goddess.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,"I ordered a small, I'm about 5'2 and weigh 125. The top fit perfectly. My bottoms on the other hand were too small. Everybody has different body shapes, so I guess it depends on your shape."
4.0,Beautiful watch for 20 dollars. Love the color. Only time will tell how long it will tell time.
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture, material doesn't feel too too cheap. Sleeves go all the way to my wrists. I usually wear a small but ordered a sized up to a medium based on other reviews and it fits perfect so order a size up for sure - I'm 5'3&#34; 120lbs. Only issue I have is the fabric wrinkles like crazy and the liner underneath is a tad short for me to wear it to work but it really looks great on and is as expected for the most part. Definitely a great buy for the price, I'll just wear slip underneath for work and go without on date nights! Fast shipping too, it took about a week to get to me."
4.0,They are really nice but the rings usually to tight to easily take off or to lose so they fall of when sleeping.
4.0,"I like the length ,color and tassles but the material was thinner than i expected ,it got caught in my velcro and has many small holes and lose threads now .DARN YOU VELCROOOOO other than that its a good scarf .keeps meh warm 🌚👍"
4.0,"Very high quality, just a little longer than I pictured !! I'm 5""3"
4.0,"I like it, I don't absolutely love it. It's long in the back but almost too short in the front.<br /><br />The material is a casual cotton like material.<br /><br />Color is great. I'll probably tuck it in with jeans."
4.0,Pretty good buy for the price but they definitely feel on the cheap side
4.0,"There are things I like about this dress and others I do not. I like how this dress fits, it is true to size. I also like that the dress is longer, it lands right above my knees. The blue color is also a perfect color. Now I do not love the top, which is what I found most appealing when purchasing this dress. The floral design looks very old, suited for an older crowd. Also, the top is very square, and I don't like how it goes out at my shoulders. It makes my top look broad. I will keep this dress because it is still a very nice dress, just not what I was expecting."
4.0,Very nice dress 👗 I received  a large and it fits perfect 👌 I’m 5’3  weighing 209 pounds. Extremely curvy woman sexy yet basic enough for the office 🤓😝
4.0,"The dress fits a little larger than expected.  The collar is a bit funky, and sometimes doesn’t want to lay flat.  The dress has pockets, which I like.  Makes me look a bit hippy which I do not like.  Material is pretty nice, and I have worn it to work twice with boots.  Length is good."
4.0,Like it a lot but it is snug after all. I sized up but not enough!
4.0,I have a little problem opening and closing the buckle
4.0,I love the way they look but they are thin and I would have to wear heavy socks if I wore them out on a cold day. I would never wear them on a bad weather day. I can't wait until it gets a little color in New England so I can start wearing them.
4.0,"Purchased for ski trips. It is thick enough to protect my face warm, soft to touch. Worked well for me."
4.0,"Super cute, fit all my fingers, I'm a size 6 in regular rings so these knuckle rings fit me perfect and so did the one regular ring. Arrived way sooner then expected. They Truly look how they do In the picture, very shiney."
4.0,"If you value looks over practicality, this is not the sweatshirt for you.<br /><br />Yes, it's ugly. Really ugly. But so ugly that it's appealing in a strange sort of way. I've always been a fan of the truly horrible looking Christmas sweaters, so I felt right at home with this.<br /><br />I like it since it's very thin, but still provides a good deal of warmth. The lining is a thin fleece and the outer material has a smooth silk-like sheen to it. The sheen adds to the ugly appeal and makes it really pop. It's very lightweight but, with a t-shirt under it, is warm enough as-is for crisp fall weather. It's also good for layering when dressing for the winter cold. Zero bulk but lots of warmth is a winner for me.<br /><br />The size is pretty true. I have the XL and the shoulders and arms fit perfectly. It's a bit baggy in the chest and waist, but that's typical for an XL for me.<br /><br />Build quality is mostly OK. I have concerns about the elastic on the cuffs and waist. It doesn't feel all that heavy-duty, and I expect it will loose some elasticity after several washes. So far so good, but I'll drop my rating a star for that.<br /><br />Some may point and laugh, but I'm warm and comfortable in it, so it's a winner for me."
4.0,"I am 4 months pregnant and was looking for a winter dress up dress that would accommodate my growing body and belly. I am around 160 right now and 5'4. My weight mostly in my mind section. Typically I would wear a medium but since gaining 20 lbs i decided to order the x-large. I guess I was expecting Asian sizing but that's not what I got. The dress is BIG. It's big on my chest, my arms, armpits, etc. I should have gotten the medium.<br />Also. Like the other reviewers said, there is another layer to this dress that isn't pictured. It's like a long ruffly under layer. If it were cut out, the dress would hang a lot better than it does with the under layer.<br />With all that said, it's a cute dress with potential."
4.0,Didn't last long.  The plastic clip on the neck broke. Very disappointed.
4.0,Although more than one polarized lens would've been appreciated.
4.0,I wish it was a tad longer. It sits above my belly button but still love it!
4.0,"I bought these on a whim, wanting something thicker than stackables. I really like the rings. The colors are great and they fit great. I may buy more!"
4.0,Got it for my husbands birthday and he loves it . It a lil tight on chest but I love it 💋💋
4.0,"20-1 mm thick, 20-2 mm thick, 4 each 5 color, 2 each 10 color, this makes it different to post to sell for the small time jeweler."
4.0,The product is very flimsy and cheaply made. After a while of wearing and it started to turn my finger green. If you're wearing it while sweating it will definitely turn green. Otherwise it's a really cute ring for the price.
4.0,This shirt looks great on my son.<br />Ordered size M and he wears an 8 in boys. I didn't have any issues when I washed it.
4.0,"Very nice shirt. Well made and nice looking.  It is snug though, order a size up!"
4.0,"I like the material and rich color.  The stitching looks to be high quality.  My only concern is the amount of ironing I will need to do on these shorts after washing.  Also, while the waist fits perfectly, they are a bit snug on my thighs.  Fortunately, the material is stretchy enough to allow for a comfortable fit."
4.0,These are great holders but they do wear out if as I do you use them all the time. I knew this before I bought them and that's why I got the multiple packs.
4.0,"Pretty colors, easy to put on, enough length for mid to lower back length braids however the quality is on the cheap side. Out of 3, 1 is already popping stitches and not just a few of them. Enough so that I can fit my hand through the new hole! I guess for the price, what do you really except?  Would I buy it again? In a pinch, yes, but if not, I'd looked for something with better quality."
4.0,lovely. glad I bought it
4.0,"These are very nice costume jewelry.  I am sure they are  not &#34;real&#34; Pearl but the size is good and I will wear them to work, etc. I think the $30 price is a bit high but not a horribly so given the construction of the earrings.  I found similar earrings at a local flea market and that vendor wanted $65/pr.  Yikes!"
4.0,"I am not much of a tie guy but have to wear one every once in a while.  This is a two set, and both look high quality that should last me a very long time.  The red stripped one is a little weird because it looks to have glitter on it (but it does not feel like glitter), but it is pretty faint and you have to be looking closely at it to notice.  I will probably be wearing the grey one a little more because it has the glitter.  But both will be going into the rotation."
4.0,"This was a gift. The necklace itself is beautiful, the problem is that it does not sit well while wearing. The recipient loved it though."
4.0,I love how it feels while wearing and especially moving around but it's such a pain to put on pants because the latch is too large to go through most belt loops. I still enjoy having it but it would be a better design if it were smaller
4.0,"Cute, but a little small and doesn't cover the top sides very well."
4.0,"My daughter loves the fit of these! They are super soft and stretchy. They wash perfectly and the bright colors do not fade. I just wish that I could find more options to order individually or to choose which patterns I am purchasing. In many of the 2-pack order options, one pattern is great and the other is...meh."
4.0,"The skirt was a little longer than my liking but it wasn't anything I was bothered by. The waist was a little larger than I expected and sat lower on my body rather than higher like I would like. I'm a size medium in most bottoms so for anyone smaller, this may not fit as well as those who are a M or L. There's an elastic band in just the back and the material is very stretchy for those who may be larger. Very light weight and flowy."
4.0,Practical  and nice sunglasses !
4.0,its fine and good size
4.0,Was worth it. Nice!
4.0,Width of frames was better than expected and block light very well
4.0,"I'm 5'9, wear a 8.5 shoe, and got the small/medium. They fit fine in the foot and might be a spec short on reaching my knee, but I can stretch them up. The foot fits fine and is actually like a normal sock, so if you want compression in the foot, these might not be best for you. I don't really care for the design with blue stripes in front and some sort of gray in back, but they will be fine underneath running pants in winter. I'm also using them under jeans when I work at my desk. I figure since I sit for long periods of time, these might be good for my circulation."
4.0,"Simple dickie's socks, great for working boots"
4.0,"great glasses, better than expected for the price point. compliments all the time."
4.0,"Great Saucony quality. So soft and comfortable. Great materials, you won't be disappointed. Only thing is the laces are so-so."
4.0,"I want to give these call 5 stars but the arms are a little snug and short against the back of my ears but these glasses came on time and properly packaged, with a soft drawstring case and lense cleaning cloth,& they are absolutely beautyFULL even though they are not prescription lenses I want to wear them like I need them! so0o0o stylish perfect for my diamond shaped face=-) worth the buy!!<br /><br />update..the screw was not securely intact if U buy tighten that otherwise they will soon fall apart"
4.0,Gliding up pretty well. One of the zippers in the big pouch is broke and we are only half way thought the school year. Other one is still working beside that seems to be good quality.
4.0,"Get a size up, they need to be pulled all the way up to work but my 13mo old was able to pull them off"
4.0,the bar is a little shorter but is easy to screw on and comfortable to wear
4.0,This was made of great fabric. But ran a little big for me. I was 200 pounds. 1 month post partum. I got the medium and It didn't tuck my stomach in as I wanted. I will order the small . I didn't return my product. I gave it to my sister who is 20 pounds heavier and it fits her perfectly. If u like it a bit snug go ahead and try looking.  Hope my review helps u in ur decision. Don't forget to click helpful if it was to u. Thank u.
4.0,Good Looking scarf.
4.0,"If you want it snug, order your size. If you want it a little looser, order a size up. It fits like second skin. It stretches and it's comfortable, looks very nice but if you remotely have a flaw to hide, go up a size."
4.0,"I have a lot of trouble with blazers as I have broader shoulders, which can make me feel restricted.  This is an unlined blazer that is super light and stretchy, more like a cardigan.  I wear a medium top, and often need to go up a size for blazers, but was able to buy this in a medium and it fits wonderfully.  I docked a star because some of the stitching is a little uneven in a couple of areas, but the way the front drapes means the imperfection is barely visible."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty but the material is not impressive. If you are looking for a cute inexpensive dress this is perfect. The quality is not fabulous, but it wears well."
4.0,I thought they would be bigger but I still like them.
4.0,"Fits well, I got a medium. Mine is missing a belt lope, so that irritates me. The length is good and I’m only 5’2”"
4.0,Great pair of boots. Stylish and durable.
4.0,"Honestly, this item is beautiful.  I don't understand how people have said that it is small, it is exactly the size pictured. The bust that it is pictured on is simply that, a bust.  It isn't supposed to go to your waist.  My onlyissue with this item is that the tendrils on each side are not of equal length.  Now, I'm rather endowed so it falls together more and isn't noticable.  If you were quite small in the chest department, it may be more noticable."
4.0,"I HAVE A VERY SMALL WRIST AND IT FITS FINE, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA STRAP. NICE WATCH!!"
4.0,Not what I was expecting but it’s ok
4.0,Sent as gift; young girls and their mother like the earrings and are pleased with them.
4.0,These came as expected.  I pulled on one to make sure they were sturdy. It broke but I wouldnt say they are easily broken.
4.0,"These are amazing! Warm, comfortable, and fit perfectly. Would be 5 stars but I still skip in them sometimes at work which defeats some of the reason for choosing these. Overall happy and may purchase again in the future"
4.0,"Not unexpected, but theres a small gap in the arm pit of the dress. A quick stitch will fix it"
4.0,This is a well made and functional purse.
4.0,was hoping for the pearl to b not so big  .. ... ...
4.0,Love the shirt. Collar will lay funny (corners have to be folded under repeatedly). I dried it in  a dryer and I believe that caused it to start fraying at the bottom. All in all a solid 8 out of 10.
4.0,Talla un poco pequeña
4.0,Great lightweight golf skirt. I love the length not too short. I would say it runs a tad large and I think it is best to have a bit snug so the shorts don’t move around
4.0,Really nice coat for the price. I read before purchasing thay it has no zipper or button. I don't really mind. Now that it is getting pretty cold I woll probably add a button to close it. I normally wear a small and am glad k for the medium. Only down side is the fur sheds quite a bit. It sticks to black clothes. I have also picked it out of my eyelashes and nose which does suck. I have had lots of jacket with fake fur and ita never been an issue. Other than that I really like it and it is comfortable. My boyfriend also said he really likes it and that it looks good.
4.0,"I’m a little over five feet tall, weigh about 165lbs, and have what I would consider a curvy figure. I wanted this dress for a work event so I picked the one with longer sleeves and opted for a medium. Right out of the packaging the dress fit fine, maybe a little loose around the waist and bust but the hips and arms fit perfectly. For reference, my bust is 36in, waist 26in and hips are 42in and I’m sure I could have fit into a small. Because I loved how comfortably the dress fit on my arms and hips (and I had a little bit of time) I took the waist in about an inch on each side. It was a tiny fix that took less than 5 minutes by hand and honestly was not that necessary. Overall I would gladly buy from this company again, the fabric is thick and has a nice stretch and the dress is flattering even without alterations."
4.0,"Love this purse. Would give it  a 5 if it had a zipper on both sides of the gun pocket so you could use it on either shoulder. Beautiful color. A little heavy, but all in all I am satisfied and get LOADS of compliments on it!!"
4.0,"I'm happy with this skirt!  The slit/cutout is a little wider than I expected, so I feel like I have to turn the skirt a bit from where it's supposed to go so it's not too revealing.  And the fit is a little snug.  Overall though I like it and I'm excited to wear it."
4.0,Beautiful pair of earrings they were easy to apply and are light weight.
4.0,"I have 3 of these purses, just the right size and the longer you use it, the softer the leather gets.  They are all beautifully lined and hold up really well.  This one....the color isn't as appealing to me as I thought it would be but I'm using it!  AND yet, I look at the picture of it and it's accurate.  I think I thought it was going to be more ""gold"" colored...it's sort of ""pea soup green."""
4.0,"A couple names were missing, but overall a great product. HUGE and a real game changer for in person drafts."
4.0,"Just as I ordered.  Pretty thin but only needed them for working out.  Breath well, very light.  Good buy, for sure."
4.0,It was a little bit big but because of the waistband it fit perfectly so it is a good dress for the price
4.0,"Purchased for my niece, she loved them. I give 4 stars because the pin that holds the earring in place causes her slight pain. The pin is like a first time earing pin."
4.0,Love the design but is a little tight on my ear. Cant wear it for more than a night out
4.0,SEMPER PARATUS
4.0,Beautiful product. Much smaller than I expected.
4.0,"nice boot, material could be better, fit and look are good though"
4.0,I wear this everytime I go out golfing.
4.0,"Perfect! All of my colleagues were asking me where I got this from. I liked the color, too. it was exactly as expected! I liked how i could place my ID card, visa, and money all in one place<br />However, i think the neck strap is a way too long"
4.0,"This is a cute bag and a good size. The leather coating on parts of the strap and some other areas wore off within a few months, but overall it's okay for the price."
4.0,It loos so pretty and fashionable. It fits me somewhat large but I usually have that problem with all of my clothing. I'll get it fixed.<br /><br />I ordered a size Small (I'm 5'1 and weigh 105 lbs)
4.0,"Love the comfort and style of this sweater. Minus a star because the sleeves are a little short, but that is almost always true for me. I added an embroidered logo to the corner opposite and it looks great!"
4.0,Arrived on time. Same as advertised. No complains until now. I am happy with this product. Normal looking product.
4.0,"This is a dope watch. Had some clasp issues, but the watch is so gorgeous."
4.0,Looking forward to wearing it. I’m tall so i may need to wear shorts. Not as long as I would like but really soft
4.0,"It’s a very cute and flattering coat for the price. It arrived on time and was packaged well. The belt does feel a bit on the cheaper side, but otherwise it feels like decent quality. My biggest complaint about the jacket is that it didn’t come with pockets. The pockets were completely seamed shut, which was frustrating because I had expected pockets. It was an easy fix after purchasing a seam splitter, but still upsetting that I had to do it myself. All in all, I’m happy with the purchase, especially now that there is pockets for my hands on chilly days."
4.0,"Bought it for a holiday party, and fits fine. Definitely cheap fabric. Set your expectations accordingly when purchasing this jacket!<br />5, 10"" athletic build, Medium"
4.0,Very comfortable.  It is well made and fits as expected.
4.0,It doesn't slouch as much as the picture shows.  Only complaint it is cute I get a lot of complements.
4.0,"Love this bracelet and have had many compliments.  I have worn it everyday for over a month in the shower, pool, etc. and it looks like new.  Only 4 stars because the clasp and hinge on  first one I received was super loose and easily opened.  I received an email from the manufacturer asking how I liked the product, and when I told them about this they sent me another one free of charge which is perfect.  I do have smaller wrists, so be sure to measure.  So 5 stars for the second one."
4.0,Looks and feels nice. Arrived quickly. It's a Christmas gift for my grandson. So we'll see...
4.0,"It shows up exactly like it was described, it coyuld of been bigger, but it was worth its price, it's a good buy."
4.0,UPDATE:  Scarf received in a very nice colorful envelope.<br />Good quality
4.0,Looks a little cheap but i guess too much cannot be expected for this price
4.0,"good design , easy to use, timely delivery"
4.0,Difficult to remove
4.0,Cute concept and good quality but vest was not flattering for my curvy shape.
4.0,"I ordered these in the teal and the sanddrift print. I got a large accourding to the measurement chart. The teal fit great, the waistband does slide a bit over time but they are very comfortable. I did have to wash them before I wore them because they smelled like vinegar. The sanddrift were weirdly large everywhere. I returned them"
4.0,"First of all I think watches are for telling time and not for telling people you can afford to spend a lot of money on a watch. That being said this watch is beautiful and does what I want it to do. It tells me what time it is where I am and expects me to know what day of the week it is, what the date is and what year it is. It also doesn't go to stop watch mode, timer mode, time 2 mode, military mode or alarm mode if I happen to bump it and have me spend minutes pushing buttons trying to get it back to telling me what time it is. A real throw back to happy day!<br />It seems to keep perfect time and I only fail to give it five stars because the hands are hard to see in dim light.<br /><br />Charles Leach"
4.0,The earrings are pretty I ordered them as a gift so I have not worn them hence the four stars. They appear that they will hold up just fine. Makes a nice gift at a reasonable price
4.0,My only noteworthy comment upon this product is that after a year of use back of pendant started to wear through to show cheaper metal beneath
4.0,Just fine.
4.0,"I have found these gloves very useful for above-freezing winter temperatures, and they are quite elegant and stylish.  The gray pair is my least favorite in the set because the two different materials are two different shades of gray — the microsuade part that covers the back of the hand is a purple-tinged solid gray, while the material that covers the palm (and all around the thumb) is sweatshirt-like, i.e. cotton and speckled.  The speckled sweatshirt material makes the gray pair feel a bit less elegant than the black and the mauve pairs.  However, all the pairs are soft, comfortable, relatively warm, and easy to handwash."
4.0,"One of the most comfortable watch bands I've gotten for my Fossil Sport. It's become my everyday band. The only thing is that if you have a smaller wrist, you might not be happy. I wear mine on the second to smallest hole and even that sometimes feels a tad too large. For a person with larger wrists, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Edit: 7/20/20<br /><br />The band is holding up fine, but it does look worn on the surface. It's not damaged, just doesn't look great. If you're using this for exercise and don't care about cosmetics, then you're fine. If you're looking for something that will continue to look good for a while, then consider something else."
4.0,Good quality for the price. An elastic band would have been nice. Fits adult head but probably too loose for little girls.
4.0,These socks fit nicely.  They don't slip in the back which is a MUST feature when doing pilates. I highly recommend them.
4.0,Comfortable and fast delivery.
4.0,Very comfortable dress. Sets of stretch..arms are deeper cut than normal. Could be exposing.
4.0,"Very Soft, I should have ordered one size smaller (XL) ... would buy again if I needed another sweatshirt for myself or purchase as a gift!"
4.0,This shirt definetly runs large so order a size down. It is pretty long as well so it makes a great blouse to wear with leggings or to wear over your bathing suit...
4.0,"I'm too tall and too fat for this. But it is really cute. I guess I can still use the skirt and bow. I feel like I might rip the top if I stretch. I should stop buying clothes online. I recommend you get this if you are skinny with smaller bust. I ordered xl and I am 5-10, 140 pounds."
4.0,Ripped the 2nd day. And black strings are fraying already. I still love it. But sad ar quality its definitely only gonna last me this winter.
4.0,Good material. Good for hot days working around the house or as a swim suit cover up
4.0,Great pair of shorts.  I little on the long side.  The belt is too short.  I bought size 36 but the belt seems to be for a size 32 or 34.
4.0,"nice but not as full as shown ,some strands were broken"
4.0,"It's great quality and cute. The waist is weird. It is like it should either be lower or higher. I'm also not crazy about the pockets. They add a little baggage at the hips/pelvis. I can make it work and won't return, but I won't purchase another.<br /><br />5'1"" 130 lbs 36D size small fit well."
4.0,I liked the material of these shorts. The overall fit was just too big in the butt and leg. That being said the waist fit. I am 5’8 and 160#. I ordered a large. The length of the shorts were a tad too long for my taste. The gray color looks exactly as pictured. I returned due to the fit.
4.0,"nice, good price, does the trick"
4.0,im a size 10. fits well a hair to big. its nice because its comfortable and stretchy.
4.0,like the cap however it is much too large
4.0,Fits great. Wish it was a little softer material. It digs into my sides when wearing it at work.
4.0,I like this shirt and bought it specifically to wear with my brown leggings. It’s a little longer than I expected and the material is more  polyester feel versus what I was hoping for (soft flannel or knit) but it’s cute and a little different. It runs a bit large and I ordered it in a size M.
4.0,I love it. It just took too long to get delivered
4.0,bigger than thought
4.0,I bought this item for my teenage granddaughter. She loved it at once but... the fabric of the collar (white) requires ironing every time. So you can understand that this is not for a teenager to do every time after laundry. She is almost not using it.
4.0,"I have had mine for a month and it's still working just fine. It's cheap, simple and great for everyday."
4.0,"Works pretty well on material sneakers. I have one pair of leather and don't recommend it on those.  I used a couple layers, letting it dry in between.  No rain spots or worry spots show up."
4.0,"it was the right size, however the leg parts we cut to make shorts because it was too short for him.."
4.0,material feels good. get your money's worth.
4.0,"They picture was not clear on whether these were the lenses with round sides or the angle side.  These are the rounded edges.  They are identical to teh original lenses but it does not say ""smyth"" on the lense.  They are easy to install and I like the color- its not too dark and not to light."
4.0,"Fits as expected but the box was destroyed for some reason (my daughter wanted the box more than the shoes, lol). They are very stiff and caused a little blister on the back of her foot the first time wearing these."
4.0,"I love how soft this sweater is, I was not too happy that it runs a little small."
4.0,The “gems” are pretty sparkly - just not sure whether the price is worth it considering they are not true Swarovski crystals.
4.0,"Dress fit perfectly, fast shipping, and it is beautiful. Thanks"
4.0,"Pros: looks nice, wraps around<br />Cons: the magnified strip on the bottom of the lens is pretty thin the glasses are pretty tight on my average size head,"
4.0,"This skirt is very beautiful and I love the material. The waistband isn't sewn the greatest. Just the way it's made is a little awkward, but it's not that noticeable."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, and the right size."
4.0,Order a size up. They do shrink a little. I love them so much i bought a large. Love them. Get complements on them
4.0,"A bit too shiny metal, but I liked that the necklace is adjustable."
4.0,Very cute and goes well with many different swim tops
4.0,"Got this as a gift, well simple and looks nice on."
4.0,Nice dress. Nice material. Reasonable price but it looks good.
4.0,"Soft, comfortable and slip resistant!!!"
4.0,"I really like this sweater a lot, however I got a bigger size just in case and I’m glad I did. It seems to run small. I also had to put it in the dryer with some dryer sheets because it came with a really funky smell. However I love the way that it feels and looks"
4.0,"Bandanas are nice and soft. one-sided print is a downside(screened and not dyed). As a screenprint, even though it's soft, it's not as soft on the head as a dyed bandana would be."
4.0,"These sunglasses are neutral enough to flatter many faces, yet are stylish enough to stand out a bit. One concern I had was that my glasses arrived with somewhat unevenly bent bows (ear pieces).  Apparently, though, this is something that can be easily fixed at most eyeglass stores, as they can heat the bows and simply bend them back into shape.  After this, the glasses fit me great."
4.0,"Really nice dress, my only complaint is the sleeves.  They are very tiny.  I was expecting them to be  a little wider, as shown in the pic.  Still worth the buy though.  Nice color. (I got the maroon)."
4.0,Doesn't stay shut very well. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Comfortable and soft. Also a good fit. Overall I love it.
4.0,"I bought this in rose gold and it's absolutely beautiful. It's so dainty, and the pearl adds so much beauty. Love it!"
4.0,"This dress is adjustable.  I'm 5' 6&#34; and this came to my ankles.  I wanted it a bit shorter, all I had to do was adjust the collar.<br />The color is bright and has lasted through a few washes.  This dress can be easily accessorized for multiple looks.<br />It is light and airy without being see-through.  This is a nice summer dress, but can be used in cooler weather with the right additions.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for a fair and honest review."
4.0,This is a great top but if you are large in the chest it has very little support at all.
4.0,"Nice quality sweater! Very cozy.<br /><br />The back is knit, not &#34;suede&#34; like the front. Also the &#34;shearling&#34; is only lined in the front if that helps."
4.0,They were to big but I loved the fabric. I also love the color.
4.0,"Had to bend the posts a bit to get them to clip, but they are cute and great for the price."
4.0,If you dont mind wearing a skirt with a tag that says youre larger than you are then this is a pretty good bargain.  I love the colors and having something a little different than everyone else on the court.
4.0,Was a gift and the little boy was happy
4.0,"This was exactly as described, and true to size. You could adjust it if it wasn't though. I love it! Such a unique shape!"
4.0,This lasted about 1 year for my husband.  It's ok.
4.0,"So I do really like these glasses and was happy they came with a case and microfiber cloth. I have a huge head and they are almost big on me. Not only do they fit big but the lenses are physically large as well. I wish they were darker as well, blocked out more light. You can see your eyes through the front. Overall great glasses love the design and skinny frames."
4.0,This tank was so cute and would have been perfect had it fit.  Only size small was available so I took a chance.  Would buy again if more sizes became available.
4.0,"It’s thicker than I expected. It’s not quite as light as the pic so maybe a few more washed and it will be. 5’9, 220lbs and I ordered the 2X...it loosens up a bit after wearing it."
4.0,Work a lot in the kitchen. (Not recommended with this watch). Broken seal? Loose bolt? Either way moisture got in some how. Probably my fault. No matter but definitely not for intense work activities
4.0,The colors are bright and beautiful. A little small on the inside.
4.0,The only dislike is the skirt part wrinkles very easily. Other wise I love it.
4.0,These leggings add a cozy layer over tights to help keep my legs warm during the cold weather while I sit at home and watch television.
4.0,Love the shirt. The material is soft. Like the heather look.  Just runs smaller than I expected it to.
4.0,"Enough support for the  physically active,  but comfortable enough to wear to bed."
4.0,"For my taste the case it's a little bit bigger that what I expected but overall is a nice product to have, if you match it with DG sunglasses make sure your eyeware aren't too big, otherwise won't close right and makes the case looks not ok."
4.0,Very warm and cozy....like the color. Great for colder weather!
4.0,The hat is adjustable so fit is perfect. Excellent quality. My only complaint is the color is more orangy- coral than red.
4.0,It works for when going to outdoor events. Just the print of the lace on it brings value down. Makes it look tacky. I will buy from seller another one but this time one that is of solid color.
4.0,This piece is simple but elegant. The only complaint I have is that is arrived with a dysfunctional clasp making it impossible to open/put on. The addition of a second clasp or a replacement sufficed.
4.0,"I love these pants but they're so tight. I got a size M as I usually wear it in pants, but these fit like straight up leggings. Would order up a size or two."
4.0,Really nice fit and very flattering.  I only subtracted a star because it is advertsed and looks like true white BUT it is winter white or ivory. Shipping was neat and organized and return was an easy process!
4.0,Nice accessory for a costume I'm using. Just be aware it is a small vial. (I could easily hide it in my hand). And the glow isn't very noticeable unless you are out at night.
4.0,"These pants are not see through, comfortable, but they do tend to fall down a bit."
4.0,Print smaller than in the picture.
4.0,Very comfortable and fit to true size. They do seem cheaply made but for the price it’s a good deal and will make good use out of them for the season.
4.0,"The shoe is broken after 1.5 months, however, after I contact the seller, they immediately sent me a new pair of shoes.<br /><br />The quality might not be as solid as other shoes, but for their price and customer service, I changed my mind and give them 4 stars."
4.0,The dress is very cute you need to have if you have any type of stomach at all you need to have a very heavy duty girdle on a sucking panty that will hold your stomach in other than that it's fun love the color and just a little tight around the waist in the tummy
4.0,Very lite and comfortable.  Almost like wearing pj's.
4.0,Cute sunglasses. Not oversized and fit my smaller face well.  They do seem quite fragile (thin arms) so the hard case they came with will be useful.  I bought two pairs. The gold frame with pink lenses darken things more than I like.  But the silver frame/lense are nice and not dark at all.  Great price for polarized lenses.
4.0,Cute top. Runs a bit large
4.0,This particular style is not designed for someone with a normal width foot. If your foot is average I would recommend getting the thong style.
4.0,Cute dainty
4.0,"Not as soft as I thought and I wish I had sized up, but very cute and still comfy!"
4.0,"Love the belt but I read the reviews of people who described that the belt runs small and decided to order a Large instead of a Medium.  I wear pants with a size 31 or 32 inch waist.  Those who ordered Medium explained that it's too small but too expensive to return.  The Large fits well EXCEPT that I need two more belt holes in order for it to fit.  Rather than put it in the donation pile, I did my best to make the extra holes using a sharp scissor and a corkscrew.  Surely there's an easier way to do it but, hey, it worked.  The Large would probably fit great for someone with a 35 or 36 inch waist.  Overall, it looks like a very well-made belt and it matches my cork purse (Yes, I'm a woman) perfectly.  Nice and lightweight with a sturdy belt buckle that looks to be high quality. And best of all, it's vegan!!!! If it fits you, you'll love it!"
4.0,"A little on the small side, but very warm without the bulk."
4.0,"I used this dress as a leaving my wedding reception dress. It’s super cute, matched my colors and all that. I’ve worn it a few times since for dates and such. Super beautiful and comfortable and the material is soft. Perfect for summers in the desert. My only complaint is I got a small which was the smallest size possible but it’s just really big up top. It comes with a tie tho which really helped! But you might want to plan on getting it taken in a little if your shoulders are narrow or your girlies are a B or smaller."
4.0,Fit right and stay up. They don't show when wearing my slip on sketcher tennis shoes. Just what I needed
4.0,These shoes were a bit big and bulky on me and did not look good in a business skirt but made me feel safe in any working environment.
4.0,Nice shirt just didn't fit how I expected. Fast and easy return.
4.0,These were the exact cut I've been looking for. I'm 5'3 with a short torso and other high waisted bottoms literally went up to my boobs. but these hit exactly where I wanted. They definitely run small which is my only really complaint. I haven't tried them on the ocean but I'm hoping thats where their tightness will pay off.
4.0,It goes well with leggings.
4.0,"Pros:<br />1.  Affordable.<br />2.  Good color and pattern.<br />3.  Good for daily uses.<br />Cons:<br />1.  Very light.<br /><br />Although it says ""genuine leather"" on the band and it smells like one but it doesn't feel like leather.  Very light and almost to a plastic texture at the underlining (where it says genuine leather).  I'm still keeping it for daily uses, for the price point, I give it a four stars."
4.0,Beautiful  dress fit great. Love the way it move when I'm walking
4.0,a little tight for size 11
4.0,I used these for an alien costume. They looked great but weren’t comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. Definitely worth the price to complete my costume.
4.0,"Its has a nice design, not too expensive and useful for every day use. I use a lot and I am happy with it."
4.0,"Pretty dress. Runs a bit long but you can use the tie to help lift it up for flats. Colors are vibrant, received lots of compliments."
4.0,"i like the feeling and the texture of this item. It is very smooth and it does feel really warm when you wear it. The reason i gave it 4 stars was because it did fit as expected but it felt kinda tight at the same time. I could still move around and do things normally, but it was kinda getting a little small  specially if you wear many layers."
4.0,Order second pair
4.0,"Cute, comfy and great quality."
4.0,Received several masks in 1 package. They fit well and arrived on time. Many complements. Dark saturated color with NO heavy smell like many things you buy from China.
4.0,Very pretty earrings. Just wish the post came out of the center of the back rather than towards the top. It gives the earrings a 'drop down' effect.
4.0,Love this product! It is the perfect size for everything i want to bring with me to football games!
4.0,"I love corduroy and this bag is exactly what I was looking for. The color is awesome and the quality is nice. I did have one complaint and that was that it smelled like a fish market, and I had to wash it twice before using it to get the smell out."
4.0,"They are made from the moisture wicking material.  They are not as wide as they appear to be, and they do not have neat sewn edges.  They are just strip of material sewn together and folded.  It would have been nice for them to have been neatly sewn on the edge and a little wider (per the photo)."
4.0,"there okay, somewhat tight fitting..."
4.0,"Really comfy and cute, but seems like they may fall apart quickly."
4.0,I like dresses with pockets for work. This did meet my expectations.
4.0,A good deal for a fun dress
4.0,Runs very large. I wear a medium or large and ordered a small. It fit perfectly.
4.0,Loved the colour. The colour turned out to be a prettier pink colour than shown. The proportions of the earrings were also much better than expected.<br /><br />On the whole a great buy at a great price.
4.0,"Only four stars they are so soft ,fit well but the little bubbles used for tread are somewhat too big or rather thick and cause pain to my diabetic feet. That's why I ordered them I normally go barefoot in the house but with the diabetes affecting my feet and legs now they do their job of keeping them warm so they don't turn blue and keep me from noticing if I step on something that might be dangerous for me. But the big bubbles on the bottom cause a pain of their own. I love to have them on sitting around or laying around the aloe really softens my feet. Now I need something similar for my hands at night."
4.0,"The purse was slightly smaller than I realized, but it has a really nice feel and I love how many compliments I have received since this arrived.  My only downside is not having one more outside pocket, but that's a personal preference for keys. For the price that I paid, it can't be beat, and looks much nicer than my former purse!"
4.0,My son bought this as a gift for a friend.  We didn't take it out of the package but it appeared to be of good size for a small person. It was true to the character and the material seemed to be of a decent quality for such an item as this.
4.0,"I really like the way the top fits my chest, it's difficult to find tankini tops with a flattering cut on top for small chests. I ordered a size 8 and I am 159 lbs, 5'7&#34;, 36B and it fits perfectly. I was surprised that the bottom of the tankini top wasn't more flowy, it is form fitting, but from the picture, it looks a little loose. The bottoms fit fine, but I am not sure I like the higher waist. That's okay though, as I just got this suit to wear the top with swim shorts that I already own."
4.0,I bought the black band.  It complements business and dinner out attire.  The fitbit doesn’t fit snugly in in a metal cage so it rattled a little when it vibrated.  When I added thin cloth inside the cage the rattle subsided.<br /><br />I liked it enough to buy the brown band.  Several other ladies in the office have purchased the band after seeing mine.
4.0,"Very cute, but a bit see- through."
4.0,Great dress. It's casual but not too casual. I am breastfeeding and this dress is very functional for that! I have Size 36EE breast and this fits well I thought I would need a 2x so I got that but it was too large every where else on me so I bought an xl. The only thing keeping me from going down to a Large is that since my breast are so large the dress pulls a bit away at the arm pits and I don't want it to look too stretched there. Over all a great dress easy to clean and easy to nurse in.
4.0,"Overall I was pleased with this product. However, I didn’t care for the boxey neckline, so I pinched the center and pinned it with a safety pin it into a V-neck.  It was way too long so I just laid it on a flat surface and trimmed the tulle. It was very easy to trim. I added a belt to accentuate my waist."
4.0,Super cute and comfy... But they were a bit big (I'm 5'1 100 lbs). They'd ride down when I would walk or sit down.
4.0,Beautiful 👗
4.0,"The ribbon falls is removable, which is a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it. It's a smidge loose on my head so I don't feel comfortable wearing it while on a bike."
4.0,My first set of crawling earrings they were really pretty but It just wasn't my style. Could see myself wearing them. STILL very pretty earring!!!!
4.0,Love it. Really big and roomy.
4.0,Like it.  Nice uniform.
4.0,Great product but could be a bit better if it had an extra piece to hold the extra pice of strap.  I would recommend product
4.0,Pretty style and fabric. Runs small.
4.0,"Very lovely dress however, runs large. I am 5 foot five and 150 pounds, medium to large"
4.0,"It was a very cute piece but unfortunately it was defective. I could not unscrew the ball, I tried really hard but never came out. I had to return it :("
4.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. I had been looking for a statue of an elephant with good luck raised trunk for her garden. When I saw this little jade elephant with upraised trunk,I tjhought it would do until I find a garden statue that I liked.. This is adorable. She liked it. I neglected to buy her a chain at the same time and she hasn't worn it, yet. I intend to get a chain so she can wear it.. It's adorable. I wish it had been a little deeper green jade kin color ismy only disappointment."
4.0,"I truly like the softness of the material, but was hoping for a material that was a little thinner."
4.0,Great for a quick outing not good for long term use because its shape in the back will become irritable
4.0,Bought this dress to get married in. It fit my large behind perfectly but was obviously made for a bustier woman. I had the top altered and zipper removed to slide it over my head. Cost me $40 but was worth it for the low price of this dress. It looked amazing and very well made for the price. Will find and excuse to wear again l.
4.0,I would give it a 5 if it fit all my Pandora bracelets. Great quality and looks even better in perso . Love the skulls!
4.0,"Nice but I recommend  to order a size bigger than your normal size, other than that, super cute and fresh for summer-fall time"
4.0,Great for keeping safety glasses close at hand
4.0,"They work well. I primarily use the clear glass one when I ride at night. The yellow is a bit too strange for me, but it's good for cloudy days. Blocks the wind adequately. This was a good deal. And, for the price, you don't have to worry about it. If they last one riding season, I'll be happy."
4.0,The outfit is amazing! Super cute and festive! The only problem is that it was about a size or two too big. We had to wash them with hot water and dry them in high heat twice for them to shrink some. One of the two outfits I bought ended up being the correct size I bought after that. The second one was still a size too big. We were able to make it work. Double check it.
4.0,Really nice design and priced fairly. Just order larger size
4.0,Very comfortable just took a bit to get use to the hood
4.0,Smaller than expected. Still cutter though.
4.0,"This dress saved me- I ordered it last minute (along with two others), had been searching for one for months for my boyfriends sisters wedding - I’m 5’ 10” so expected it to be a little short but it worked! It hit the floor if I was barefoot and hovered over with low heel.<br />The straps could have been taken in a little but didn’t have time to alter that - for the price the material looks fine! Just comes in a bag = wrinkles - so be prepared to steam it ! (Ordered the 12 - wore as wedding guest to Vermont October wedding)"
4.0,Wore these for the Color Run in Denver.  So much fun!  There were great.
4.0,"Hard to review since it was a gift for my sister-in-law, but she loved it"
4.0,I would order this item again. I use this to carry my ID and it is of good quality. People often comment and ask where I got it.
4.0,"I normally wear a medium, but I read the reviews and they said that it ran a small so I ordered a large, well now its too big, and I don't really want to wear it. A medium would have been perfect. Oh well!"
4.0,Super soft nice fit but not quite as pictured still nice purchase
4.0,"It’s a nice tie, but the actual color is more white than silver/gray and the blue is more of a baby blue."
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. It was light, comfortable, and cute. I have an hourglass figure at 5'3 and 135lbs., and it didn't look good on me. Had to return it. :("
4.0,"Got this as a gift, was surprised on how nice it was for the price. My sister loved it."
4.0,"I brought this dress for my daughters 9th birthday photos. Size 9/10, fit well. Only con is, it wasnt like the color in the photo. I ordered purple. It was a much lighter shade than what's on the model."
4.0,I ordered a size up. It fit perfect. I felt sexy. I did wash it and it didn't come out the best. I recommend washing alone & hang to dry. Or dry clean it. I would order again.
4.0,I decided to use it as a visor and took the top piece off only to find out that it's very uneven. Higher on one side and low on the other. It looks stupid so I just put the top piece back on. This makes it unnoticeable.
4.0,"I bought 2-3 of these for my mom over the years.  I love the large face & numbers - so rare to find that in women's watches.  And the colors and styles are beautiful.  The only con is that all of them lasted less than a year.  But for the price, I suppose that's to be expected.  I would buy some for myself if I wore a watch, but I haven't for many years."
4.0,Very flattering. Fit as expected. The inserts for the top can be seen through the bathing suit. That is my only complaint. Good price and look!
4.0,The only issue I have is I haven't found a single tag anywhere on the leggings and the front and back of them look identical so I don't know if I am wearing them the right way or not 😂. And if you are on the shorter side you will have to pull them up some so they don't bunch at the ankle but it's not terribly long like some leggings and pants I have encountered.
4.0,"Bought these as a birthday present for my bf, he is an avid fisher, so I figured he would get a kick out of these. He loves them and says they are actually comfortable. One thing to note is that these are meant to be more of a house slipper (just in case you were thinking of wearing these out lol.) The whole sandal is made of foam material and there isn't an actual sole, so it smooth and decorated all around."
4.0,"Cute for a costume, but very thin material."
4.0,I like but the medium probable been better.  The upper top is tight. So if you are not petite than go with the next size up.
4.0,"They are just what I wanted. They’re soft, variety of colors (though they are more muted colors in person than they appear online), decent stretch, and warm (don’t expect wool sock warm but they’re a decent thickness)."
4.0,Bag over all works well. The color on the piping rubs off after one plane fight.  So bag looks old and worn.
4.0,"Loved the skirt, it was really full!! Shirt could be longer its a crop top.. its really good quality."
4.0,"I really like these gloves.  But there are a few things you should know. They're a little big in the fingers.  I have very long fingers and the gloves are longer and have stuffing at the end of the fingers.  Also, I don't think you could drive comfortably with them.  Too thick and bulky.  But for shoveling and snow blowing, they're great.  Oh and the material on the outside isn't too tough, it rips easily."
4.0,"This dress was slightly larger than expected and very, very stretchy - I could easily have gone a size down, but was perfectly happy with the fit. I felt the dress laid nicely without a petticoat, though there is room to wear one. I would definitely wear and buy this dress again. It was a fantastic bargain. I normally wear 10/12 and purchased Size L. The only down side was that the dress came clean, but folded and heavily wrinkled - plan accordingly, this is not a last minute, wear out of the box dress. You'll need some time to either press or steam the dress, but for me this was no problem."
4.0,Was bought for my granddaughter. It was difficult to stay aligned on her head. We had to use hair pins to attach. Good quality and excellent price to play dress up.
4.0,It is a little deceiving and it looks better when your arms are down. When you lift them up you look like a bird with a wide torso. But I won't be lifting my arms up and down a lot in this top so I should be okay!
4.0,Fits great. Fabrics more mesh than dry fit so a different feel than expected but hey it does what it’s supposed to for the price.
4.0,"These glasses are really good. Not a lot of glasses fit me really well, but these do. My wife also tried them on and liked the feel of them as well. I purchased the ice blue version and they look exactly the way the image appears. The polarization is really nice and I loved the look while driving. The glasses pinched a little bit on behind the ears at first but seem to fit more comfortably now. I like how much light the cut out and the iced over lenses look good and people can't see your eyes. Anyway, I would give the glasses a 4.5 if I could but kept them from a five star because they pick up fingerprints very easy and the initial pinch and tight fit. I will probably buy the dark black ones next though.<br /><br />I received these glasses at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,It's a gift for a student. I hope she wears it with pride!
4.0,Good product for the money...
4.0,"Jockey underwear shows variations in size and material from different countries, but these ones made  in Thailand are good."
4.0,"Like the material, fits a little tight but it's great love Misfits"
4.0,"My first impression was how quickly the pendant arrived in the mail (it was literally only a week and a half for delivery to my door (in Australia) from Las Vegas.  Exceptionally fast!<br /><br />The pendant was exactly how it appeared on Amazon.com.  It was also quite light to wear (I hardly even notice it).<br /><br />I am completely impressed at the entire process from purchase to delivery.  Everything was fast, and most importantly, arrived in a perfect condition (as if I purchased it from any local store)."
4.0,"This watch looks amazing, but is easy to nick and scratch."
4.0,Fits perfectly. Little longer than expected but maybe it’s cuz I’m 5’1
4.0,Nice little watch. Did not come with any instructions.
4.0,Easy to Breath!
4.0,broken or I would have rated higher :(
4.0,This dress is amazing! Fit is perfect. The dress is comfortable and fashionable.
4.0,Work great they do what they’re supposed to do comfortable to wear I would definitely buy them again
4.0,"I don't care for the self-tie belt that came with the dress (it makes a great headband though), but with a wide black patent leather belt, this dress is perfect!"
4.0,I bought two. One for me and one for my husband  I like it cause my ears don’t pull and hurt after wearing it for awhile  Good buy
4.0,"Soft, flowing scarf, ear loops comfortable. Just wish there was a way to connect the back or tie the ends so it stayed around your neck when you are not using it as a mask and don’t have the ear loops on ears.  A cotton insert over mask part would make it suitable for covid but not much protection as is with a thin piece of fabric."
4.0,"I love this ring. It’s good quality and it is nice. The only downfalls that I had with this product is that the little gem on the ring came off and the ring is a bit too big, but overall it fits nicely. I recommend this ring if you love BTS."
4.0,I used this for a party. It was a hit but be advised it runs very small.
4.0,8 year old son loves them.  Easy to charge and great variety of colors.  Recommend for &#34;extra pair&#34; or for school.  Not sturdy enough for an &#34;only&#34; pair of sneakers.
4.0,"My 3 year old loves Captain America and loves wearing these. I ordered him one size bigger than his normal shirt size and that was a good decision because after they're washed they shrink a little and they are tight pajamas anyway. They are very soft and comfortable and slightly stretchy. The pants are tight around the ankle so doesn't matter if they're a bit too long. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because after wearing and washing only 4 times, the bottom of the shirt came unraveled, and a pair of pajamas that cost over $20 should be more durable. Nothing a few stitches can't fix, however, so overall satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,very nice but it was a little bigger than I needed
4.0,"Soft, comfortable they way you want a flannel shirt to be"
4.0,"Exactly as described.  Nice key chain.  Little pricy in my opinion,  but I liked the look of it and made impulse buy."
4.0,Super cute but runs a little small
4.0,Thought it was really cute. I bought it for my daughter’s baby gender reveal party.  Changed my mind thinking it was a boy! Turns out I would have guessed right to begin with! Pink isn’t really my color so I returned it knowing I wouldn’t wear it😁
4.0,"Cute shoes, I thought the soles would be a little firmer but over all I like the shoes for my daughter"
4.0,I like it a lot but the gold didn't last very long
4.0,Replaced some Haines with these and find no quality difference at half the price.
4.0,Good pair of earrings ..got them for my girl.. she loved the color..<br />The look good on olive skin tone
4.0,"I really loved this hat's materials and craftsmanship. It was very well made and stylish. Unfortunately, my teenage son's head was too large for the only size they had left, medium. I do not think it was missized, my son just needs a larger size. But if it fits you, I highly recommend. Lovely product."
4.0,"I ordered an L and it just fit. I usually get XL or L depending on the type of top. Other reviews said that's these are long but they are not. I have not worked out in them yet to see if it will ride up. Material is comfy and although not compression, it fits snug and I like how I feel held in. I wore one for comfys around the house and I liked it for that. I may get more in the XL."
4.0,"The sewing was good, my little girls loved them."
4.0,"Very comfortable to wear and makes my legs and feet feel less tired after working sometimes 16 hour days. I'm very petite and they came up to my knees but I would guess mid calf length on anyone else. Would definitely recommend if you are on your feet long hours! Kinda thin in the feet area, I would suggest wearing ankle socks with them especially during the winter."
4.0,It was the size and quality expected
4.0,My 10 year-old granddaughter purchased this for her mother and both were well pleased.
4.0,"I love these earrings, they’re so cute. They’re classy and great for minimalists. They are easy to lose though, one fell out of my ear on campus and I never found it, I had to buy another set. They’d stay just fine with some backs on them though."
4.0,"I adore these threader earrrings, they aren't too thick in the chain, so getting them on is fairly comfortable. They are very light weight, but have a nice amount of movement and the rose gold is very eye catching.<br />The price point is perfect, for such a great modern classic earring. They really go with everything!"
4.0,Very cute and exactly what I ordered.
4.0,I love the wallet. Matches my purse well. 4 stars because I paid for 1 day shipping and it did not arrive on time.
4.0,"GOOD SOCKS 10.5 &,11 WIDE  NEED THIS  XLARGE SIZE TO FIT"
4.0,This is one of the best trainers I have purchase. This holds everything just right I can wear it and still preform all functions I would on a daily basis . It came on time and was in great shape. Only thing I had an issue with was to zip it up on my own... Over time I was able to
4.0,Stretchy very thin material but comfortable already has a hole after 2 or 3 weeks
4.0,Quedaron perfectas para mi hija de 11 años.
4.0,Color was a little different than photo.
4.0,Very pretty but colors not as vibrant as expected
4.0,"The one thing this bag lacks is an outside pocket, large enough to hold a cell phone."
4.0,This is absolutely well made and a beautifulfit.
4.0,Cute but definitely made for smaller chests.
4.0,"Absolutely love the fit of this stylish tshirt dress.  Is perfect for causal setting, well made, fabric is so soft… love it!"
4.0,"Nice robe for just-out-of-the-shower. Lightweight but good quality for the price. Would also be good to get a couple either for a spare or for company,"
4.0,I like the fit although they are on the large side so you may want to order a size smaller that you wear. The mesh on the sides is great and helps keep me cool while wearing them. Unfortunately the mesh tore in a couple places the first time I wore them. I didn’t anticipate the opaque factor so be aware that you will not be leaving anything for the imagination when wearing them. Especially the white ones.
4.0,They were good just smaller than u expected
4.0,"This bag is so cute, I've gotten many compliments! Unfortunately mine came with a little rip at the seam but I fixed it with a quick sewing job. It also came with a scent that reminded me of Chinese food, but it went away after letting it air out"
4.0,"Cute shirt, but my daughter is a Med-Lg. We bought the large and it was very big and on the wide side.<br />She is slender. So, we will be taking tucks in the sides."
4.0,It doesn't come with the tools to put ashes in the necklace. Only necklace that makes me itch.
4.0,You cant beat for the price
4.0,Nice set. Shorts too Short  for me.
4.0,"Nice sweater, runs a little small but good quality."
4.0,Very nice vibrant colors but should have gotten a 1 size bigger.
4.0,Nice dress but it runs small so go up 2 sizes.
4.0,Hunting and hiking
4.0,"My husband was telling me that he wanted a pair of black earrings, so when I saw this set I thought it would be a good choice and that we would both appreciate it.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:<br />- Stainless steel and nickel/lead free... therefore good for people with sensitive skin, to avoid any allergic reactions.<br />- Different colors and two different shapes - great to alternate.<br />- In my case I will leave the round ones to my husband, and keep the circles for myself.<br />- 7 pairs is a really good deal.<br />- Good weight (maybe too much) and strong, resistant and durable.<br />- I love how shiny they are and I love all four colors!!!<br />- My favorites are the blue ones.<br />- I like how each pair comes individually packaged.<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE:<br />- They are quite heavy (I put it in my pros too, but wearing these for a long time could end up hurting your earlobes). I personally get tired of heavy earrings and don't like wearing them for too many hours. These are just OK, though I don't see myself wearing them for a whole day.<br />- They are quite difficult to put on. It took me a lot to insert the earring and find the exit on the other side of the earlobe. (And my husband had the same problem). Maybe if you don't wear earrings every single day, your holes shrink and these earrings have a thick piece and no point at the end.... or maybe it's just because the piece that goes inside the ear is short. Eventually you will get it right! ;)<br />- SO, if the posts would be slightly longer, I think it would be an easier fit.<br /><br />I believe that $11.89 is a fair price, especially because it's 7 pairs of earrings. I like the quality and the colors. Yes, I would recommend these!"
4.0,I use them everyday. They ar adjustable.  I never lose my phone and I am hands free doing almost everything else.  You will not leave your phone anywhere.  I also use one for my keys.  Love them.
4.0,ok so this shirt is made of a nice material and its wearable even in the heat. i had my fathyer try it on for size reference and he is a large and the shirt is a large and it fits pretty well. the only complaint he had was the collar was loose  guess he prefered a closer fit but that is just a preference. this shirt has a nice color its seems like a grey with a hint of blue and it will match with many color combinations. the shirt seems like a jean material so it will look nice when paired with jeans for that jean outfit look but the top is not made of a jean like material. it is not the softest feeling but its not very rough. it still has a relaxed fit. overall he sees pleased with the shirt and the option to roll the sleeves up or leave them down. the shirt is quality and thick but still light enough to wear in the hot weather. the shirt looks exactly like what you see in the display pic.
4.0,Very nice material and design...covers just enough.....;)
4.0,Nice tie. Perfect for Christmas. They say it's pink--but it's really more red with some softening white. Don't let the word &#34;pink&#34; scare you.
4.0,Bought these for a Christmas gift. They are an awesome silky and wicking material for working it which is great. I tried one on and they do not slide on the head.
4.0,Size runs a bit smaller then it should. Product also has a full finish but good value
4.0,Very cute and fit well. But they are so stiff! They are taking a  long time to break in and run my ankles raw
4.0,Used these for a wedding and they really helped not to sink into the grass we had to walk on. The only thing was at the end of the day the heel broke through the protector.
4.0,"Not the best quality. Color changes eventually, however they do look pretty when worn."
4.0,"This dress is very comfortable, except for a little itchiness at the hem.  It moves beautifully.  I like a tighter fit, but definitely benefited from the comfort of it not squeezing me to death."
4.0,The shirt comes a little small and shrinks.  It's not the best quality T-shirt.  Looks great though.
4.0,"Dress fits true to size and is very flattering. Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is due to the texture of the fabric. It’s not uncomfortable, and I can’t really describe it, but it’s what made me go down one star. I’d buy it again for sure."
4.0,I like this dress.  Great for even going to the grocery store.  Material is a bit thin but not to bad.  I'm large chested and the waste line rides pretty high.  I'm 5 ft. 7 inches and it's the right length for me.
4.0,"This was a very pretty bracelet, I love the combo of colors and charms! But the clasp was a little difficult latching by myself."
4.0,Love that it dresses up my Fitbit. It's really easy to take out links if it's too big. Each link unsnaps and you just remove as many as you want. I had to remove 4 before it fit me.  The only reason I did't give it a 5 is because it's a bit clunky and I tend to hit it on stuff. The rubber Fitbit band didn't do this but I also didn't look dressy enough to wear with a dress!
4.0,Same quality as Claires or Ice
4.0,"These are great!! I haven't been able to find anything close to the deal these were. The silicon flowers alone usually cost twice as much as this whole bundle!! EThe only unfortunate thing is that 3 of the ""pairs"" of pasties (the colored ones) were not actually pairs. They were the same shape (for example, two stars) but had completely different designs on them. So that's why I'm leaving 4 stars instead of 5. I'm not really too upset about it because the non-matching sets seemed to correlate with each other... so say there was a non-matching star set and another non-matching flower set. One of the stars and one of the flowers have the same design on them. So I can just mix and match to use most of the mismatched pairs. I'll attach pictures because I feel as though this explanation may have been confusing 😂<br />First photo is all of the pasties not including the mismatched ones. Second photo are the two pairs I switched up so the designs would match, and the last pic is the only pair that doesn't match at all."
4.0,My wife looks great<br /><br />This product works satisfactory and I am very happy with it and recommend to anyone who buys it will also be pleased to find that it was also shipped on time and in excellent condition.
4.0,"I ordered by using EU sizes, and It's a bill small, had to check with US sizes."
4.0,Nice bag. It was bought for a gift so i cant really say much about it.
4.0,Used for traveling on a plane but found them to be great for every day.
4.0,"As others have reported, these shirts are much smaller than expected.  Knowing this in advance, I purchased size XXL and it fits like a Large.  Very soft and comfortable, perfect for layering under sweaters and flannel shirts without added bulk.  I knocked off a star because of the inaccurate sizing, but once you factor that in, they are great shirts for the price (I got them with a lightning deal)."
4.0,They have started to fade only after 3 times of use. I also don't like that the top button is internally fastened.
4.0,Instant connection with it. Nice product.
4.0,"Works fine, a little itchy, but haven't lost a shirt yet!"
4.0,"Quality made product. A bit larger & bulkier than I was expecting, but still very nice. I gave it 4 stars because the design makes it a pain to get to your keys - undo the clasp, then unzip the pouch. Not very convenient, but definitely secure. Might work for protecting a car remote from the elements - it's certainly large enough to fit any car remote that I  have ever seen."
4.0,These are so cute… material isn’t what I expected though. I though it would be soft and stretchy but it’s almost more like business pant material.
4.0,"It's simple, doesn't distract, and does the job. It might be too large to wear at my waist, but fits around my ribcage which is what I got it for. The belt arrived quickly and in good condition, packaged as expected"
4.0,"The fit is perfect and they are really cute. My feet still slide, the grips are not as good as I hoped they would be. Using for barre class"
4.0,I bought this for my Granddaughter and it looks so cute on her.
4.0,i love them  delivered very very fast
4.0,"I like this cover-up.  I wore it over my skirted bathing suit and felt comfortable walking around even when others were not in swimwear.  The only issue I found with it was a slight tendency for the fringe to catch on things but honestly, that is inevitable with fringe."
4.0,The watch is great but the strap is terrible. I now have 6 of these watches in a drawer with broken straps.  They want almost as much for a replacement strap as a new watch. The watch keeps unbelievable accurate time.
4.0,"Comfy casual wear for home or to run errands.  You can dress it up with a jean jacket or any other cute jacket.  This color makes it slightly see through, but not horribly noticeable."
4.0,"It's the perfect mustard color I was looking for , for family pictures! It's a light material and fit my 3 year old perfect! Would buy more! It did have some loose strings 🤷 but couldn't beat the price."
4.0,"It's a cute shirt and the feedback suggested you order up a size, so I did and its still too small!<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/24/17<br />I received an email from Lily @ customer service and she sent me another shirt a size bigger, and it fits nicely.  Thank you Lily! I would recommend this seller to anyone, she went out of her way to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase! Awesome, and thank you again!"
4.0,I really like these they were light and delicate. Perfect and simple not too heavy on the ears
4.0,"I am 5' 6 135lbs. I purchased a large. The colors of this suit are vibrant and beautiful as in the picture. I normally wear a medium but decided to size up from reading the reviews. I do believe I have a long torso because even sizing up it still feels snug length wise. I decided to keep it and really like it and received several compliments the first day wearing it out. But it's not the best fitting suit. I wish the sleeves were longer also but I didn't see they were in the pics so that was also expected. It is a really cute, protective one piece"
4.0,"Order up at least a couple of sizes, if not more for this manufacturer.  Lots of variation in colors as well.  I got a pink and a white one, and the white one is MUCH smaller than the pink.  Also, when ordering different pieces from Doubliju that both say Indie Pink is the color?  They were not even close to the same color....so I didn't end up with a matched set of tank and cardy."
4.0,"Loved these earrings. Did have a mini heart attack though when I first opened them because they arrived with some brownish tarnish on one of them, but with a dab of silver polish it came right off :) they're pictures with the matching ring I also bought separately of Amazon"
4.0,I loved this dress. The only thing I had issues with is the straps were a little big.
4.0,"These are very good exercise shorts for women.  I received a XL size for review and they fit me very nicely.  I'm 5'9"" tall, 145 lbs and have hips made for birthing babies.  The shorts are soft, stretchy and have a pocket for whatever - usually a phone.  I washed them in the regular laundry cycle and they came out of the dryer nice and soft.  My only complaint and the reason for docking one star is that the elastic band in the waist is narrow and tends to roll over and needs to be rolled back and flattened before wearing.  A thicker elastic band would have prevented that problem."
4.0,"Love the outfit, but the pants weren't proportionate to the adorable hoodie."
4.0,The top is cute. It fits well. The material is thin like a t-shirt.
4.0,"It’s a really nice shirt, but don’t expect fancy material. Also sizes run a little small but still a good shirt unbuttoned ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
4.0,"I saw these at Lens Crafters and really liked them, my mom got a pair but I didn't want to pay full retail price of $200. So I seen these same ones on Amazon for $80 and figured what a steal! As others mentioned, you HAVE to make sure you check the seller to make sure they are giving authentic frames. I got this pair and another from the seller ""Sunglass Boutique"". Comparing these to the same ones my mom bought from the eyeglass store, they're definitely legit and real Coach frames. The nose pieces that come with them are not comfortable for sure, had to replace them with the softer silicone ones. Other than that they sit well on my face and what I like about these aviators is the full arm and not the flimsy metal one like most aviators. So it's easier to get adjustments for them to fit you better as well. I used these to get my prescription lenses in and got my lenses polarized so that is why my lenses may look darker in the photo. If you are wanting to use them as is for sunglasses they are NOT dark at all just keep that in mind. The stock lenses do not do much at all for sunlight and glare. If you're wanting a name brand frame at a good price this is a good bargain."
4.0,love it. BUY
4.0,Really like the bag. It’s color is nice.
4.0,Comfortable with needed adjustable straps to step in for casual wear.
4.0,Love it. Very comfy
4.0,"Cute dress and very comfy, runs a tad big"
4.0,"Love this, perfect to protect my natural hair"
4.0,What ever u hang on make sure it weighs a bit other wise straighten it out a bit
4.0,I really like the hoodie but it does have a few loose threads and is printed a bit cheap.
4.0,"My new favorite bra.  I am a larger (thicker) woman, size 14/16 in clothing and 44C in my bra.  I can never find a good demi bra, slightly push up in my size because society feels that if you are larger than 38C, you should strap your woman parts down and not enhance them.  This bra is comfortable, gives me the cleveage I want and has the larger sizes that most woman today are.  I would love it if they made it in more colors than just black and nude.  A great Red would be awesome (please)"
4.0,I like it. It helps me know what time it is nice..
4.0,g'son likes anything with batman
4.0,"Best of the winter headbands I tried this year, very good quality, it may be my head is a little flat (although Ive never noticed before) because it does have a tinsie tendency to slip."
4.0,"This Swimsuit is really cute, I ordered the black and white striped one. I purchased it for my teen daughter and ordered a size small.  It fit as expected.  She loved the swimsuit.  It provides just the right amount of cover (modesty).  The only thing we weren't 100% thrilled with was the amount of fabric at the front. The fabric that drapes, is just a bit much. It makes you look a little bit bulky and makes you look a bit thicker than you are.  Other wise this fits just fine and is very comfortable.  The bra top has adjustable straps which is a plus!! The bra also has removable pads and the elastic around the bra is thick and well sewn.  This product is very well crafted.  The suit came with triangle bottoms.  The panty has a side string closure, which I wasn't thrilled with, but is definitely a great thing when the fit needs to be customized. Overall, we are very happy with this swimsuit.<br />I depend on customer reviews just as much as you do and take pride in always being honest about my experience with products I review. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
4.0,It was a lil tight on my daughter she is pretty skinny should’ve gone a size up she just turned 7
4.0,Very comfortable and a definite plus for fishing.
4.0,The service from the company was fantastic.  the dress is different than what shows in the photo though.  there are parts of fabric that stick up around the hips that didn't look very flattering on me.
4.0,Love these! Not too small and the color is very pretty.
4.0,My only problem was that it was far too small.
4.0,"Face it, this is a cheap wig - and at least the one I received is pretty good for a cheap wig. It's a little nicer than ones you'd pay more for at a Halloween or party supply store. It is a little thin (hello, it's a cheap wig) and you'll probably want to trim the bangs or have someone trim them for you. It came in a mailing envelope, in a sealed bag. The wig was enclosed in a hairnet inside the sealed bag, which I think contributed to the wig's status upon arrival. I expect it to get messed up and not last long, but having it in the best shape possible to start with helps! I'd considering buying one of these again."
4.0,Very cute but def runs small
4.0,"Great quality. My daughter loved in. But it fit much bigger than expected. She’s in size 6-7, more towards 7, but this was about 4-5” too long."
4.0,Wears great! Nice accent pice......great price!
4.0,"I have full size shopping bags, but tend to forget to leave a few in the car.  These convenient bags (about the size of a plastic grocery bag) have a great little pouch and I always manage to keep on in my carry bag (I don't use a purse) and one in my car.  The colours allow me to save plastic for fresh fruit/vegetables and other goods, also."
4.0,"I've been wearing these Costco socks for years. They've always been too good to be true: cheap, warm, quick-drying. However, I noticed this latest batch I ordered off Amazon appears to be a little skinnier than my old ones.<br /><br />Note the side by side comparison with the old sock on the left and the new one on the right. Did they change manufacturers?"
4.0,"Too small, but otherwise far and away the best no-show flats socks I've found!  The inside of the opening is rimmed with a band of clear stretchy, rubbery plastic, which keeps the socks firmly on your heel ALL DAY, unlike all other flats socks.  The lace is really pretty, too.  They run really small (I'm a US size 9), so eventually some of mine developed holes in the toe area where the lace couldn't stand the strain; I'm pretty sure all the socks will eventually do this, but ce la vie - it seems like a fair trade-off for a sock that finally doesn't fall off my heel.  Summary: too small, but still worth the money!"
4.0,"This is actually the first time I purchased a hat to wear in the summer. I'm out with my dog everyday and go for long walks. In the summer it is brutal and annoying to lather myself from head to toe with sunscreen. This will help to keep my head, hair and ears protected. I do wish the size was a little smaller. The chin strap is just not for me. This is a very stylish hat and easy to pack and take with you."
4.0,"I have to be honest, I bought this set because it was one of Amazon's deals of the day and I've always been curious about CZ so I figured why not. I did not anticipate how stunning the pieces would be. I'm so impressed that I'm gifting them to my niece to wear on her wedding day. And I will keep this seller in mind. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is the presentation. It came in a small bag not a box...but for the price I get it."
4.0,"The quality is great except that the silk is very loosely wrapped around a thicker core which makes getting that divot at the bottom of the knot impossible to pull off.  Instead, wrap it around smooth and you are good to go.  Otherwise, a decent tie."
4.0,"I bought this (using my fiancé's prime account) for myself (170, 5'9&#34;) in a medium, and it fits great! It's a little bit tight in the chest but I think a large would be too big for me. Lots of compliments from my friends when I wore it, definitely worth $20. I like that they have free returns if it had not worked out. I actually spent more on the strapless bra I wore underneath!"
4.0,"These are nice earrings.  I got the 8mm size, and they are just right for me.  The &#34;pearl&#34; is not cultured--but it does look good. The earring length is right for my earlobes, and the back screws on securely.  Satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,The reviews stated that they ran a half size larger and that was true. Very comfortable
4.0,Its for a newborn! Fits great now and its so cute on my new granddaughter! May fit until she is about 6months!
4.0,"tend to loosen up as you wear them, but great quality."
4.0,"Good, simple watch.  The illumination function is not good at all, and only barely works, causing a 4-star.  For a $10 watch, I'll take that."
4.0,I got this hoodie for my daughter as a gift because we both love MHA.  She absolutely loves it and it came just like it looks in the picture. Does run on the small side but the image quality on the hoodie is great and the overall quality of the actual hoodie is good too.
4.0,"I knew from other reviews the fabric would be a little thin.  I ordered a large because I thought it would show every lump and bump and I'm glad I did.  It is loose, but drapes wonderfully."
4.0,Nice dress but not accurate to size. I purchased a small and it was a little big
4.0,Buen producto. Me gustó mucho
4.0,"The seaming on this top is very flattering as is the scoop neckline. The neck is low cut enough to show off a statement necklace but not so deep you have to constantly adjust your bra. The lace inserts are a nice timeless touch that dress the top up enough for work.  You definitely want to match your bra when you wear this as the straps will be slightly visible through the shoulder lace. I've worn it out dancing and I've worn it to the office with a jacket. Red is one of my favorite colors and this top is a nice tomato red with yellow undertones. Glad I bought this piece, its at home wherever I wear it."
4.0,The girls enjoyed the skirts and were amazed with the light.
4.0,Very durable headband.  I have handwashed this  item and its still going strong.
4.0,Beautiful shirt ... just a bit long for a short person like me.  Will keep and have it hemmed!
4.0,"I like this  anklet very much the only thing is the clasp is open and it falls off,  so you have to keep your eye on it"
4.0,It is smaller than it looked but I am sure my granddaughter will be happy with it
4.0,It was difficult to figure out how to put it on )) but it's a nice product!
4.0,I just find if you have glasses with larger lenses it’s difficult to roll up and snap shut
4.0,They came in fast and are just as the description said. Though I got the small size xD my friends say I look like a girl Harry Potter but it's kewl I still like wearing them tho maybe the medium would have been better? I'm honestly not sure because I don't want to send them back and get the medium and if I don't like the medium then it'd be too much so I'll keep them ^^.
4.0,"They aren't real stone, which bums me out. He said they felt too small to be the size we ordered. But that's okay, I resold them to my friend and she likes them."
4.0,"Love the fabric it is thicker than expected and has some stretch. Cute print, fitted feminine shape. I wish it was about 3 or 4 inches longer. It cones to my waist andI tiugged it down all day. It's a little tight in the waist. It's hard to pull on and off over head because it's fitted at the waist. But it's exactly the style that I like so I wore with a sweater, like I usually do."
4.0,"It's a good 4-5 star hat. Does sit down over ears when walking and being active. Only drawback is that fleece is only around the bottom third of the hat and it is lighter than expected. I'm bald and needed a hat that would keep the top of the head as warm as the rest. This hat isn't bad and so far with weather in the low 30 degree range, its kept me warm, even with the wind blowing. We'll see how it does keeping the top as warm as the ears when the temp drops and wind picks up."
4.0,"I got this watch because it's one of the only watches I've seen that isn't hideous.  It looks very nice, and is a perfectly functional watch.  I accidently dropped it into a swimming pool the week I got it, but it was still working fine when I managed to fish it out a few minutes later (there was some water that had gotten into the watch face though, but I put it in a bag of rice for a few days, which drew the water out).  It does pinch my wrist on the sides a bit, and it easily flies off, but, on the bright side, being flung through the air a few times hasn't broken it.  Altogether, I'd highly recommend this watch, as it fulfills it's express function and works as a piece of jewelry, but just be aware that that's all that it does."
4.0,"The top is very cute very flowing, fabric and perfect for spring or fall. Depending on which print you get, however, it might run a little bit small for us curvy girls<br />I order my regular medium size, but I think that I would size up so it’s not too binding for me<br />Totally worth the price. It’s the quality you get at a regular target."
4.0,"It was smaller than expected even though I ordered it a size bigger than I normally wear because of some past reviews but I bought some shapewear to go under it and it worked great. I was pleased with the color, length and quality of fabric. I wore this to my son's wedding and felt great! Thank you."
4.0,"Definitely cute but it does catch on things at times as it sticks out slightly. However, worth the purchase if you are looking for a cute represenation of your birthstone."
4.0,"I llike it better than I expected, especially for the price"
4.0,"Very nice, feminine, yet functional.  A good price for a great product.  Can be used with or without padding.  Very comfortable!"
4.0,"This jumpsuit is super tight! Fair warning, if you have a big butt, the zipper in the back will need a couple of extra hands, lol. Being that I'm not a big boob girl (32B) I had to tighten up the lacing in the front, but this thing fits like a glove, literally! try and buy a size up if you don't want this thing to look like it's been painted on you."
4.0,Beautiful and Quirky!
4.0,They are super cute!!!! BUT I wear a size 10 wide and these shoes are very snug and somewhat narrow. I'm about to start my day wearing them but I can already tell I will be hurting later.
4.0,"Nice size, nice leather, nice compartments.  It fits a small bag with a low profile.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when all the card slots are used, the snap has trouble staying snapped.  But I really like it."
4.0,Hats fit as expected.
4.0,"Great shoe! I purchased the gold but it is lighter than the picture. Almost a blend of silver and gold. The shoe is very nice looking. The back of the shoe does fit me a bit big but with a heel cushion they are perfect (problem I usually have when purchasing wedges) The heel is not high at all, more on the low side which is perfect for my sisters baby shower. Overall great buy."
4.0,It fit and my kid loved it.  Quality is typical of costume material
4.0,"I love love love this suit! I did have to alter it a bit in order to get it to fit because the bottoms were waaaaaay too big. I'm 5'6, 115lbs, 34 a/b and normally a size 7 so I ordered the medium. The cups were a little big too but that was manageable. The bottoms just fell off when I put them on &#62;_&#62;"
4.0,"Fits a little more snug than I would have liked, but it is very comfortable. More of a performance-type fabric"
4.0,"The style and the fitting, it makes my legs warm when I wear them."
4.0,"These are rather pretty gloves and have an elegant look. They are wool so they are quite warm and for the most part are not itchy (though if you are EXTREMELY sensitive to wool it might bother you). They are soft and fit well on your hands,, they have an area where you can use them with touchscreens but you have to learn the technique to do it just right, because it takes a bit of practice, definitely not as easy as one would like, overall though they are stylish, warm gloves."
4.0,"Nice dress, bigger than described. I had to alter it, but nice dress and it looks more expensive than it is."
4.0,Purchased for my daughter 16th birthday. I didn’t want to be snugged so it was perfect an age appropriate. She’s very petite but with curves so a medium fit her great.
4.0,"The shirts are actually a lot nicer than I was expecting. The fabric is very soft and the stitching is nice. I got these tops to wear under thinner/more revealing dresses and dress tops, and for this purpose they will work nicely. Now I kind of wish I could wear them by themselves but the cut is too revealing for me. (Tummy is completely uncovered.) Someone who is more fit may like that aspect. Additionally, the sizing runs a bit large so I would suggest ordering one size smaller than you normally wear."
4.0,"Pants were a little long for me, but I am quite short. They were a tad see through but nothing major. Very comfortable travel outfit!"
4.0,Love them! They look just like Celine’s!<br />They fit straight on your face and feel heavy duty as well.
4.0,"Nice boots, but brown stitching on black boots made them look cheap IMO.  Sent them back."
4.0,Love the earring and the look .. I think the earring should come with a rubber back for those that don't have a thick ear lobe. It will not stay in place without it.
4.0,Nice to have on hand for travel.
4.0,Exactly the quality I expected considering the price. This fills the need for a cheap pair or running glasses but nothing more.
4.0,It's ok I was expecting the material to have been a bit more thicker.
4.0,"I like it, however it runs small. Washes well."
4.0,"These worked, but it was still kind of small even after ordering a size up.  The crotch of the tights still came about an inch below where it should have been."
4.0,"I recommend these straps. The weave is fine as silk and they hold up. I hand wash mine regularly and it isn't fraying, fuzzing or pilling. Nor is it fading, shrinking, stretching or flaking color.<br />The color application gives away a cheaper coloring process than woven color, costing the star, but it is good enough. I'll consider another.<br />Pretty chrome buckle."
4.0,if you are into this style you will love it
4.0,"Beautiful costume jewelry. The colors are vivid and look stunning. Very nice bead detail. This is a statement piece, so this would look best as your main focal piece of jewelry. This could be worn to dress up a outfit, or it could even be used in a costume setting.<br /><br />The quality of the necklace is fairly good, as I said it is a costume piece. So far I have had no problems with it.<br /><br />This does have a adjustable chain so you can set this to your own fit and liking. My personal preference is to wear this almost like a choker.<br /><br />*Please note that I was sent this product either complimentary or discounted in order to provide my honest experience, thoughts and review."
4.0,"Yeah, it's cool."
4.0,"The jeans fit great and are very comfortable. My only issue is that they have this strong, offensive odor. I can't decide whether it is coming from the dye in the material or from the fabric itself. My friend said it smells like clothing that had been stored in mothballs.  I have washed them several times and the odor has not dissipated. That is the reason for just 4 stars."
4.0,"comfortable, minimal line-showing through fitness pants, like color variety"
4.0,The material is good quality. The fabric feels like Speedo sports towel. The sizing is way too big. It's probably made for someone who's at least 160 to 230 pounds and about 5.9  to 6.4 feet tall.
4.0,"Well made and gets the job done. In my boyfriend’s line of work, they lasted a month before one of the fingers ripped however can be repaired by seeing. I will buy again!"
4.0,These would be perfect if it wasn't for the back of the shoes digging into the back of my heel. I have slightly bigger calves from working out and the shoe kind of bends in weird places giving it a creased look. Overall i give it a 10/10 for style but 6/10 for comfortability.
4.0,"It’s nice! Would I say it’s amazing? No. But it is really nice and gets the job done. The material is like a short fux fur like material not so much a teddy. And it runs small. I am a very petit person and I wanted it to be pretty over size so I went with a medium. And I honest should of got a large. A medium fits me perfect but I wish it was a bit bigger. It’s cozy, and comfortable and lined with a liner, does not have fur inside. It’s nice if your looking for somethings inexpensive and cute. But if your expecting teddy quality sadly this ain’t it. 7/10"
4.0,Comfortable. So far I have not been sunburned.
4.0,I love this dress! I would have given it a 5 but I feel like it’s not quite “sweater” material. But still super cute and comfy! You can easily dress it up or down.
4.0,"I love this suit. I wasn’t expecting it to fit as well as it does but it’s almost perfect. I do think it could come up a little higher around the sides of my boobs, under the arms but it’s not a huge deal. I am surprised at how well it fits."
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments, but it's more casual that I was expecting.<br /><br />A plus for me is that I can wear it with a bra with straps, the straps on the dress are thick enough that a can hide them."
4.0,Love this purse. I finally found one I can easily put stuff in it and still have room for more without cramming stuff.
4.0,"I just received my watch today, and it is a LOT lighter than in the picture, but I can't say that I'm disappointed about that - it's super gorgeous! Just a forewarning for anyone who is expecting more of a black color, it is more of a medium-dark wood. Between the instructions that came with it and a quick YouTube video, it didn't take long to remove links to adjust it to size. If I have any issues with it I will be post an update, but so far, it's perfect!!"
4.0,"I have to say, I was surprised in a very positive way, even though the supplier is not in China the product is and so, I was expecting something of a lower quality.<br />Packaging:<br />The package is a plain plastic bag that contains the protective case, which I have to say is bulk but, it needs to be as it holds everything inside and it does offer a great protection for the frames and accessories.<br /><br />Quality of lenses:<br />Here's where they exceeded my expectations, I have a pair of brand name sunglasses that I use for driving, but no suitable for my bike rides as they tend to get foggy, so I liked these ones because of the vents on top, I've only used the polarized, yellow and clear ones, they all look great, I mean everything is much more clear, the yellow ones for evening rides are awesome, I also prefer to use them rather than clear ones because of the effect they have on car lights, you can see the light without all the glare that the clear ones will let pass, as for the polarized lenses are definitely for bright days rides, they're great to absorb sunlight glare, you feel a relaxation in your eyes while wearing them, I like them so much I now use them to drive as well.<br /><br />Quality of frame:<br />Here's where you'll see the difference between brand names and this ones, there are many corners and edges where you will find plastic flash, nothing that will get in the way of your view so performance is not affected at all, is just a cosmetic thing and you'll have to look closely to notice.<br />I cannot assure it but since they have no screws I'm afraid the plastic will wear out really quick and fall off, I guess I’ll have to wait and see, after only 3 days of constant use they’re working just fine.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />No instructions booklet, example, the frame for prescription lenses come installed in the regular frames and if you don't need them (like me) you have to remove them, by looking at them you can figure out how to do it but since there are no instructions and they're so tightly clipped in the frame it feels like you’re not doing it right and you'll break them, they didn't though :)<br />No maintenance, cleaning information.<br />The cord to hang them around your neck is of a very poor quality, they get loose and the sunglasses will drop, so avoid them!<br /><br />Overall the product is great, you get more than expected for the price you pay, yeah they probably won’t last as long as brand name ones but if you can’t afford more than hundred bucks in a pair of brand name sunglasses you’ll only use when riding you’re bike like me, these are definitely worth it!... just stay away from the neck cord."
4.0,The size is smaller than is supposed to be for man's braslet. My hand is not big but still it is too tight. The braslet itself is nice.
4.0,"Cute for teenage girls! Made a good, affordable cmas gifts for my daughters friends"
4.0,Got this hat for a Hugh Hefner costume!  It was perfect!
4.0,The black pair had a snag/defect across one thigh/butt cheek.  I should be able to cover it with a long top.  Otherwise they're just fine for the price.
4.0,I always buy at least 2 sizes larger. Will work for what I need it to do.
4.0,"It arrived much faster than most items I order from China. On the whole, for what I paid for it I am very pleased.  It is larger than I expected but just the right size for a key chain, I love the different colors and they all seemed in good shape, no cracks or missing pieces.  The material itself is so-so but remember your not paying a lot.  I would recommend this item."
4.0,My toe is getting tired but soft for planter fascitis
4.0,Great play sneaker. For the price
4.0,This purse is a perfect size. The color looks very similar to the online listing (maybe a tad darker; I got brown.) the only complaint is the smell. Other reviewers are correct about the bag having a fishy smell. I put dryer sheets inside and rubbed the inside lining down with them and then sprayed the lining with Febreze. The fishy smell seems to be fading a bit so hopefully it won't last long.
4.0,"1 came damaged, but for the price, not mad."
4.0,Very nice for price
4.0,"Super sexy, my husband was thrilled. A good time was had by all with this beauty."
4.0,"actually, they are great - they do not roll down - the waist stays in place where it should be and the support on the legs is just right.  And, they are smooth -- Hanes support hose are rough and everything sticks to them.  the only problem with L'eggs is finding the support hose to buy."
4.0,My only complaint is that the velvet kind of fabric on it holds onto hair.
4.0,"Ok, let me start by saying my other set is a Dainese.  It is not a Dainese, but for street riding, it's a lot better than jeans.  It's not a name-brand track suit, but it's decent for the money. If I could upgrade two things.  I wish it had belt loops and I wish the front button was more involved.  This would not likely stay fastened in a wreck.  Padding is minimal as can be expected at this price point, so plan to upgrade it down the road."
4.0,These pants are adorable but I'm thinking I should have gotten a smaller size.  It may be too late for me to return. :(
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this.  I needed to add a chain extender as I prefer longer lengths.  It should be handled with care but is well made.
4.0,Cute set! Lightweight and shimmer are the words that come to mind when describing this set.<br /><br />The earrings don't feel heavy and shommer when the lights capture it. Perfect length and a little bold.<br /><br />The necklace pendant is about an inch in length. The blue sparkels but the cubin zirconia that is around it make it look cheap. Odd shape but pretty.<br /><br />The necklace itself is quite pretty. I like the lobster claw hook.<br /><br />Overall it is a good value for the price. Would make a good Christmas gift.<br /><br />If you found this helpful please click the like button. Thank you!
4.0,"Cute pair of socks well printed & easy to see/read. I like the larger sizing options, as I bought these for a friend who has a hard time finding cute socks in her size."
4.0,"My son likes it, however I don't know how to tell if it's made with lead or not. The ring concerns me most, because if it's got lead in the coating, I don't want my son wearing it. Does anyone know where this was made and if it contains lead??"
4.0,I love this lanyard. Just wish it was thinner and smaller.
4.0,"Initially I thought this wold be too small but it does fit. The material is stiff, shiny and sheer.I wishs it were softer . lAlthough not soft and snuggly it is not scratchy on bare skin.  The pull through design works well although I wish there was more length. that being said, it looks nice on and dresses up an outift without adding bulk or warmth. Not my faorite mterial but it serves the purpose. 3.5 stars"
4.0,Pants were about 3” long but I fixed that myself. Overall decent after I fixed them.
4.0,"It's of seemingly nice quality. Gorgeous color. But super small, especially around the arms. I'm 5'11&#34;, 218lbs. I have a 46&#34; chest, and so I ordered an XL, it's still too small. I can barely fit in it, and CAN'T fit in it if the sleeves are rolled up. So go at least a size larger than you normally would."
4.0,I bought a different style LAI jeans in the same size and they were a little looser. These are snug. And quite a bit longer than the other pair in the same size.
4.0,I have not used them that many times so far so I really can't give an accurate rating.
4.0,"The idea of these dresses are amazing.  Ii'm pretty sure I have them a star just for being a cute halloween dress despite the issues. You look at it and you already know the material but you order it and pray it isn't that cheap stretchy material you use to find in dress up skirts as a child.  And then you open package and find that's exactly what it is.  Stretchy good, see through,  cheap,  thin bad. I have a side tattoo and you can clearly see it (in person) almost be able to read the words.  I could see my sister in law who is a teacher wear this,  or I will once this season... but it is not the black cats meow.  It isn't very flattering on my curvish figure, I'll attempt to sew some of it but am fearful it won't work. Good length,  not more cut at all.  Probably wouldn't but again."
4.0,Gift and she likes it.
4.0,I was having problems with the some of my medicine.  It made me sun sensitive.  I got these and they work great. They aren't hot to wear. I would recommend them to anyone ...
4.0,Great stretchy material but super long. I have to bring it to be hemmed.
4.0,I like it! It is very comfortable! My son like it so much!!!!
4.0,"Well, all I can say is this shirt is SO SOFT. However, I could not try it on because my dogs ripped into the box, chewed a hole in the back, AND my cat peed on it (that's the dark spot). That's what I got home to today :("
4.0,Cute and inexpensive hat
4.0,It is very cute onesies. The material is nice. My only complain is that it does not have a 2 way zipper. For the brand. I expect them to ha e a two way zipper which helps when changing the baby diapers!
4.0,"Very nice ring, I get many compliments"
4.0,My 2 year old loves her new mittens. She can get them on and off by herself. The Velcro is a little confusing because it wraps all the way around but seems like it should go through the loop and fold back on itself. With the black and purple they are kind of retro and I like that they’re unbranded. They have been warm enough for the below freezing (above 20°) temps here in Alaska. She hasn’t tried them in wet snow yet so I can’t tell about waterproofing. She has been playing with them inside and has a bruise on her arm where she accidentally zipped herself. I would give these 5 stars but since they are for little kids they should have more of that folded fabric inside the zipper that prevents skin zipping.
4.0,"These are great and exactly as pictured.  However, they look so much like real rental shoes that I was a little worried taking them to the bowling alley and then leaving with them!  I colored the bright white Rental sign with black marker and wrote my child's name on them."
4.0,The bracelet is very nice. I put it on as soon as I got it.
4.0,"I like the concept,it stays in place but it’s a bit snug and I have a small. Lastly I was a bit disappointed when I opened the bag to find a picture Durag not a black and blue like the picture 😒"
4.0,Love the piece. Ball was fairly easy to get on. It’s too short (and a bit big for my taste) for my tragus piercing but i use it in my cartilage. Still has all the stones. Doesn’t turn your ear green. Comfortable even in the cartilage while sleeping.
4.0,my daughther loves them and said they fit great
4.0,fit as expected had enough material to make a head band out of it.
4.0,"Very practical and cool pants. I have all three of them: Fire Dragon, Bones and Ghost.<br />Not the best quality / strength though: I teared apart one of them..."
4.0,After reading several reviews I decided to purchase this jumpsuit. You do have to go up a size or two. I have a small waist but big his and thighs so I needed a 2xl I love the fit around my bust which I'm a 40D an it fit perfect. This suit does give a little in the legs after movement if you are like me with wide hips and butt. I wire this to a outing with friends with some wedges. The belt runs a little thin and didn't fit my waist but u can slove that by adding your personal belt to add a little flare. You must purchase this for a dinner out with the girls.
4.0,Its a good watch. The only issue i have is it doesnt keep an accurate foot count on the app
4.0,"This was so cute! It is very warm which is great in cold Halloween weather.<br /><br />My only complaint is the fur, it sheds... A LOT!"
4.0,For a smaller face
4.0,"My 3yr old son really loved these shoes from the moment we began browsing for tennis shoes...he absolutely loves the fact that they are red because he wanted none of the other colors....with this being the first time he is wearing tennis from birth I love them for him because they are comfortable, he has made no complaints, besides the laces being a bot long he has decided to knot them his own way..."
4.0,"I'm giving this product four stars because the top was a tad bit small... The bottoms actually got fine.. I forgot to write a review when I got it, I'm going on vacation again and suddenly remembered how much of a hassle it is ordering swimsuits online... I ordered an extra large. I'm in a true 14. I'm 5'7 on this picture I was about 210. I've loss weight since then... Hope this helps"
4.0,"So they are not a perfect match, and feel like harder material, so what? The originals tore and wore out... Really want an identical match to those?  These are perfect for me. They will definitely last longer."
4.0,Very cute! A little too big for my liking but exactly as described.
4.0,"Great Socks, but the &#34;Large&#34; is too large, and with a shoe size of 13, I fear the &#34;Medium&#34; would be too small."
4.0,These fit great! I don't have to keep pulling them up in the back. Very comfortable!
4.0,"I bought this as a costume and glad it was for that purpose. The fabric is a bit shiny so it looks like a costume dress. I would not use this as an every day/ special occasion dress. Other then that, got many compliments as a costume dress!"
4.0,Wish they were darker
4.0,Cute top but I would suggest a size up<br />I’m a medium in crop tops but this top is alittle tight on me however it’s still cute and I’m still going to wear it 🌸
4.0,Adorable and nice soft material
4.0,"I runs very small.  I usually wear a M, ordered a L because of the reviews.  I am returning it because it was still too small.  Ordering a XL hoping it will fit.  Love the dress, but sizing is an issue.  Also, the dress is very see through."
4.0,"Great! Fits well. Just too forever to ship! And then the day after i ordered it, it showed up as available for Prime shipping. So i could have gotten it in 2 day vs 3 weeks... That's the only reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars. Otherwise it fits well and i live it! It is a little see through though... but only slightly. I wear shorts over them when i go running."
4.0,Able to use.
4.0,"Nice, but be aware it's much smaller than &#34;normal&#34; pandora charms."
4.0,Cute but a little snug. Should of went up a size
4.0,Good looking and comfortable. Lenses are light tinted.
4.0,"Pretty good material although it's clearly meant for larger heads. It'll keep your head nice and warm, and it looks as you would expect."
4.0,As long as you plan on wearing something underneath the skirt it is acceptable for the cost. It seems it was quickly made because the individual colors are not sewn together but it did the job!
4.0,Great color and pattern. I’m plus size and this fits perfect.
4.0,"This price runs small, so be aware of that otherwise it’s a good product."
4.0,Super Cute! But took a while to get here.
4.0,I really like it. The latch is a bit difficult to open and close.
4.0,this is a nice hat and well made
4.0,"Fit and color is nice, but be sure to order a size or 2 larger. I like the sleeves and shirt overall, but as another reviewer noted, the fabric is thin, and you'll need to wear a tank top or something underneath."
4.0,These are great but they need to come with the silicone backs so they don’t slip out if your ear.
4.0,Too thick. too tight for my head but it helps a lot especially on a very cold weather.
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, but the waist is really small for a large. I can wear a size 6 a-line dress so there is no reason why a large skirt wouldn't fit the smalles t part of my waist. The skirt also makes a lot of noise when walking."
4.0,"Nice shirts, feel comfortable"
4.0,"I like the bag well enough, it's just too big. Much bigger than I thought. Other than that, it's well-made with lots of compartments to store stuff."
4.0,Super cute for costume parties or Halloween. You can be the mysterious woman and with a flick of the wrist you are exposed.<br />When I saw this I wanted it for a wall deco we are doing and I thought this would add that certain mysterious look<br />I did receive this at a discount for testing purpose and for a honest review. Me and others around my house all love it!<br /><br />When it arrived I checked it over before my niece took off with it-<br />He stick is well attached but with a little work I can remove it when I am ready- It also has the strap if you prefer.<br />Feathers are fluffy and full!<br />You do get a little sweaty under it - Maybe some small peek a boo holes in it would help<br />Feathers are well attached and show no signs of coming off.<br />Really it is stunning and would be a great addition to your costume<br />They did not skimp on the feathers and rose on the side. I am going to add some bling by adding some Red crystals here and there to add some sparkle.
4.0,"they were too small for my nipples :(<br />not the sellers fault, i just have huge nipples. they're super cute tho, so they still get a good rating; i'll probably give them to a friend."
4.0,A little darker/&#34;bluer&#34; than picture. Maybe will fade over time.<br />Didn't realize upon ordering that the bottoms were not hemmed and frayed on purpose.<br />Good material.<br />Probably not worth 69 bucks I spent.<br />But I'm overall pleased.
4.0,Cute simple dress.  Would look good into the fall with a jean jacket.  Fits a little off under my arms but nothing obvious.  Going to try with a belt to give it some shape for versatility.  Good price and nice material.
4.0,I got soooooooooo many compliments on this outfit!!! The color is not as pictured. It’s more of a copper/Black mixture but still pretty.<br /><br />I took away 1 star because I did get 2 bruises from the fabric rubbing against my collar bone.
4.0,"Very cute, run a little small"
4.0,Cute and comfortable. I have had slightly better quality of material with others satin products but it is still nice.
4.0,Bought as a replacement for my spouse.  He likes it fine and it worked for his Oakleys
4.0,Got this leotard for my daughters dance class. It fit as expected and was exactly what I was hoping it would be.
4.0,"The bag is much bigger then it looks, not a problem at all I did want a smaller bag I have a habit of filling handbags to the brim. I may not have checked the size before ordering so thats my fault.The yellow stitching is bright but I think it adds to the bag.The only thing I found a slight problem with is when I opened the plastic the bag came in the bag smelled awful. I assume it was because of packing and the leather. Perhaps it was in storage a long while. I just sprayed the bag all over with body spray in and outside the bag. over all I am happy with this bag. I'll just have to order a smaller bag. What is one more bag to a purse collector."
4.0,Cool t-shirt with the wide neckline. It runs a little bit large.
4.0,Just like the picture.!The balls are small and unscrew easy watch out for that. Nothing broke or got caught so far
4.0,This dress is really soft and fit just right.
4.0,"Not the color I ordered.  I ordered a army green color and received a brownish tan.  I like the fit.  Was a little too long but fit good after a hem.  Thin material but good for summer.  I will order in black, I don’t think you can get black wrong. 😆"
4.0,"These socks were a great Christmas present for any pig lover! They were a little thinner than I thought they might be, but they fit and have cute pigs on them, and their breeds on the bottom."
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Used for tea party and the girls loved them. These are very small!!
4.0,"Love the way it looks, but the stands are pretty weak. Broke 2 while readjusting."
4.0,Perfect fit and made well. This hold you up and looks very goog
4.0,Arrived as scheduled and as described.
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and needed a large just so the sleeves wouldn't be too short. It's a little loose but the belt works. Its a great style and a very nice, light fabric."
4.0,Was okay and fit to size.
4.0,"Very cute design to this little raincoat.  The clear hooded area on top & the wings are nice little touches that take this from ho hum, to oh so cute! The vinyl is thin, but doesn't look like it will tear, it's just not heavy weight.  I think it's going to work great for the showers we get here on the West coast.  :)"
4.0,I like this pants
4.0,"This dress was very flowy, it was very nice & good material. Lasted all night till the strap broke ;("
4.0,Muy ligeros !!
4.0,"Just using as a fun play chef apron. but keep in mind it is plastic, so be careful if the young one is doing actual cooking/baking & near open flames/heat"
4.0,"Pretty clutch but larger than I expected. The upside to this, is that it holds a decent amount!"
4.0,It's nice but it doesn't fit me like the way it looks in the pictures. A little dissapointed
4.0,I like the fit. I thought it would be softer. I’ve had a lot of complements.
4.0,Product description states true to size. I usually take a small and I have very long and VERY THIN legs. I ordered a medium to ensure the inseam was long enough. The fit is snug for a medium and the thigh area is very tight. Otherwise the garment is soft and a beautiful shade of Navy.
4.0,Just what I needed and they came very fast.
4.0,Got this on time. It was more beautiful in person. I was sad that is was slightly to small so I would size up. The fabric is slightly see through but there is a mesh shorts part which makes that part not see through.  I'll definitely order a larger size.
4.0,Very pretty but a little cheap looking(but they were cheap so that was sort of expected).
4.0,Mask fits well.
4.0,I like the blue and green but wish I got grey instead of white for the third one. The pads are very visible so I’ll have to wear it without them
4.0,I am so happy with this baiting suit! I am 5'3&#34; and about 135 lbs.  I have a large bust so I got a size large and the fit is great! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is one of the straps is already starting to come undone (it's an easy fix) and I would really like it better if the bottoms were lined in the back.  I got the black and white striped pattern and they are very see through when they are wet.
4.0,"Bags a perfect. Was very happy when it arrived. I was looking for a bag that would hold its shape, with a handbag. I use them every day. Arrive as promised."
4.0,It's like a second skin and has shorter length in the arms.
4.0,"i bought this bracelet for my husband and he loved it.  It is surprisingly of very high quality, and looks sharp. The magnet clasp is very strong and attractive.  He wore the bracelet everywhere...even in the pool.  Big mistake.  After it got wet and dried out the first time, it shrunk a little bit.  He didn't realize why it seemed to be tighter and wore it in the pool again.  That time it got so tight he could no longer wear it.  We tried to stretch it out, but the weave is very tight and we were unable to do so.  Twice in the pool and it was done.  What a shame, it is a very handsome bracelet."
4.0,"Lightweight and kind of flimsy feeling, but held up to a 6-yr old's bday party"
4.0,Thank you very much. Grandchild was thrilled to receive it.  I was grateful I didn't have to make it.  Awesome.
4.0,Nice fit and easy to wear and use.  Works perfect for what I have in need of.
4.0,"Overall, I love this shirt and how it fits on me. My only complaint is that it runs a little small, as it’s a little tight around my arm pits. If you don’t mind showing a little bit of side boob, this shirt is perfect! For reference, I am 5’2, 151 lbs, and a size 34-36C in bras."
4.0,Love the dress. Wish I could order another one but they are now out of stock.
4.0,"Bottom to tight could not walk, but I took the seems out and made two slits down the sides and it looks great."
4.0,"I got the large,  and it fit great! (I wear a 36 G bra so that's saying something)<br />The material is very stretchy but also super see through (at least for me),  so when you wear it make sure you have something under it that's  not too loud.  The print on it maintains its hue and integrity even when stretched far."
4.0,"My daughter loves this Dino outfit, I thought was pajamas. That being said, she did say these aren’t comfortable in a way where she’d want to wear them in public, they just don’t fit her right, so she’s wearing as jammies after all"
4.0,"The skirt is super cute and the price is right, but the sizing is way off. It could be quality control and maybe you’ll get one that fits. I ordered a small and I’m swimming in it. I’m 5’6” and 120 lbs. The small fits me like a M/L would fit. There’s no way to keep it up, so I’m returning it."
4.0,"Absolutely love these!  Fit is perfect, comfortable enough to wear all day at work and I teach preschool. They do not look or feel like cheap shoes yet they were so reasonably priced. They only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they are not real suede and therefore not sure how long they will endure. Otherwise a definite plus to my wardrobe. LOVE LOVE LOVE the fringe"
4.0,I get lots of compliments! I was in between sizes and ordered up.  Should have got the medium size instead.
4.0,Really comfortable just too big.
4.0,"I love the way the dress fits, it hugs my curves in all the right places. It’s a true bodycon, and the best part is that the material has a little stretch, so you don’t feel suffocated while putting it on. I think the length is a bit awkward, It either needs to be a tad longer or a tad shorter (I’m a little over 5’5). Although I like the color of the dress, it is a tad different than pictured. I ordered the dress in the RED WINE color and It’s about a shade or 2 off, but again, I do like the color."
4.0,Not as warm as I was hoping for. Nice pockets. Comfortable
4.0,"I can't believe how many people are nagging about the size when it's posted right on the post? 12mm. If you're a guy like me & want hoops these may be a little bigger than you want, I went with the 10mm which about 1mm bigger than your average straw (to drink from) hope this helps."
4.0,"The dress is very nice, and is flattering! The fabric is not what I expected: it is a thin cotton. I chose to order a medium based upon the size chart, which indicates that a Medium fits a US Small. I definitely could have gotten a Small (my normal size) instead; the underarm area is a bit baggy on me. I ordered this on September 7th, and it arrived October 9th so shipping is slow as well. Overall, I am pleased with the dress and would definitely buy again, keeping in mind the timeline of shipping and the need to size down."
4.0,I bought the T-shirt in all the colors. I'll consider buying more Neleus T-shirt. If they carry a dark green or lighter colors.
4.0,"The leather is very good quality, the construction is very good. The &#34;vintage&#34; styling is a little bit over-done, I would have appreciated a bit more subtle detailing, but overall it is a good product. I would buy from this seller again"
4.0,The holes for the cards go all the way to the bottom so are useless as the cards slide too far down to get out.
4.0,It's not the best quality material but it's what I expected for the price. My husband likes it.
4.0,"A little bit sheerer than I preferred, but well sewn and fits well."
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 165 36D. Ordered the XL. It fits loosely with a little gapping on the sleeveless side, seems like a quick fix at the seamstress. Fabric is fine, will have it professionally pressed before I wear it. A crinoline definitely helps to make the shape of the dress pop. See pic for skirt length.<br /><br />The price point is perfect to justify any cost to have this dress customized. I approve."
4.0,"These are not bad! Not excellent...the clasp feels a bit flimsy and can be fussy to line up, but they look pretty good overall"
4.0,"Sadly didn't get the exact pattern I wanted for the colors so it isn't as a fiery as the picture on the website and I'm not a big fan of the adjustable cord style in the back, granted I like the way the necklace is knotted near the front. Other than that I was satisfied with the overall look and feel of the necklace. I already figured from looking at other necklaces of this type that the gemstone wouldn't be the exact pattern pictured on the website example just was a little bit disappointed it had as much white in it as it did.<br /><br />I also kind of doubt it is actual Orange Agate as I'm not sure most of their necklaces are true gemstones due to the prices and some of the gemstones used probably being more expensive for real ones, but I was buying this for appearance alone and even if it was only a replica stone it looks very nice."
4.0,Super soft but waistband is a lil snug... gotta loose a lil weight I guess lol
4.0,This system is a good way to pack and unpack when traveling.  I have recommended them to friends.
4.0,"I like this pack because of the color and the pockets, but I regret buying it on Amazon. I was tempted because of the steep discount on cyber Monday. I should have gone to a running store to be sure I got the actual product (I'm not 100% sure this isn't a knock-off, like so much of Amazon products from a 3rd seller seem to be), that it functioned well and that it was the right pack for me. When I replace the faulty bottle, I will buy it from my local running store instead.<br /><br />Like a lot of reviewers mentioned, the placement of the bottles is not ideal for the way women's bodies are shaped. I am quite flat-chested and even I found it a little uncomfortable. I don't think it's so bad that I'll return it. I'll just try to get used to it.<br /><br />The bag is very light weight compared to what I am used to. I LOVED that aspect. I have been running with a Teton Sports 2L pack for the last year, and this is definitely an upgrade in terms of weight and pockets.<br /><br />It felt true-to-size.<br /><br />I like all of the different compartments.<br /><br />The bottles were a bit frustrating. One of them performs totally fine and pops in and out as expected. The other is not very good- and was VERY difficult to get open. With both my boyfriend and I working on it, it took us several minutes to be able to pry it up. I took it on a run anyway, and it did OK. After about 6 miles it was back to it's original state. I am planning on replacing the bottles, because it turns out I like the long straw ones more. These guys don't easily come in and out of those front pockets, I think in part because of boobs."
4.0,The blouse is very pretty. The colors and pattern are just like advertised. The blouse top is very fitted....i should have gone a size higher. :(
4.0,"They are very pretty, they look smaller than the guide that showed the size but I decided to keep them."
4.0,This worked nicely and was comfortable but the hoodie was a bit small and didn't cover past my face enough. Liked that is came with a matching carrying case.
4.0,Gave as a gift but fit them small around the waist.
4.0,The only issue I had was they were too big for my 4 year old. Other than that they're perfect.
4.0,"It doesn't slide into my head easily, it slips off if I'm exercising with it on. Other than that, it's a decent hat."
4.0,very comfortable for ones &#34;package&#34; however being a tad chubby the waist band constantly folds over in half and is uncomfortable when it does so. Everything else is great and i have tried many micromodal underwear to include the tommy john brand and these are as good as any and better than most. I wish it was different color though.
4.0,Very good feel. Seems good quality. I wish the string was a little thicker but is holding up ok
4.0,I am loving them. I just wear one for now and I have the other on the side in case it breaks. It’s has some weight to it and fits my small wrist.
4.0,"The watch is perfect, the band is a little quirky."
4.0,"Nice quality for the price. The headband is perfect for me but I feel the &#34;height&#34; of the hat is a little puffy versus what I expected. Overall, love it and it's the 2nd color I've bought.....also got the khaki/beige earlier."
4.0,"This is an in-between shirt for me. It's not a dress shirt and it's not a casual shirt. I wore it with a suit top and jeans and got compliments, I also wore it with dress pants and got compliments. I have not been able to bring myself to wear it to work though (it's a &#34;t-shirt&#34; looking shirt with lace at the top) Great for weekends, not for a high-level office. I do like the shirt and it washes well."
4.0,"It's really pretty, but I wish the design was centered a little higher on the mask. When you insert the filter, the mask folds stretch out. It is so big that the cat eyes are on my chin, and the cat mouth disappears.<br /><br />It perfectly fits my 6'1 husband who usually wears an XL to XXL in masks. I'm a plus size gal with an oval face, but I don't have a long enough face to do the mask justice."
4.0,"Theses gloves arrived as advertised and are of good quality leather and the interior is soft and warm. Not sure yet if water resistant as I have yet to get them wet. There is a strip of the yellow leather that is the same as the outer shell of the glove sewn into the black wrist cuff for added strength when pulling the glove on when using the cuff instead of the edge of the shell, this strip has torn away from the edge of the outer shell on one of the gloves after the second use. It does not affect the comfort, shell or interior of the glove and you cannot feel it but its something that needs to be addressed or the black wrist cuff will come undone and pull away from the rest of the glove. I have some very heavy outdoor waterproof thread that I am going to use to sew this back together and reinforce the binding of the cuff to the glove on both gloves to alleviate any further future issues of this nature. By the way, I got some diesel fuel on the fingers of one of the gloves and the leather turned red on those fingers only where the diesel was."
4.0,Surprising nice for the money!
4.0,Earrings are beautiful but one of the gems fell out the first day I wore them. I'm crafty so I found a replacement. Other than that they are heavy but very nice.
4.0,"This is a warm, well-made British woolen sweater. It is not what I think of as an 'indoor' sweater, but rather one for outdoor wear. The sizing is just a bit small for us Americans, so I would think about ordering one size up.  Naval-style collar is stylish but I'm not sure how practical."
4.0,Me encanto mi set es precioso y  de muy buen  material
4.0,I ordered the dark gray and love the color and feel. I also love that it’s a little bit long. The only thing I don’t love so much is the pouf at the bottom of the sleeve. Doesn’t fit like is seen on the models. The pouf is a little weird but doesn’t take away much from the overall like-ability.
4.0,"I’m size 10/12. The XL fits with a little room. If you want it snug, go with Large."
4.0,"Nice! 180lb 5,5. XL. Fits well"
4.0,"I bought these to see if I could work with gloves on.  I can! and where I thought I would buy 'better' thicker ones, I am really happy with the size and weight of these. warm but not heavy, I could hardly tell they were there."
4.0,"Cute hat, well made."
4.0,"130 lb, 5'3"", 34B. I would normally buy a medium, but ordered a small after reading some reviews, and I'm glad I did. I'm short waisted, and the adjustable straps go short enough to make this dress fit me well. Coverage seems good enough to go braless. Pattern is pretty. Pockets are a bonus!"
4.0,mother absolutely loved and theywe're beautiful
4.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and 170 lbs; I feel as if it could be a little tighter to compress more but it's great. I plan to buy more in the near future
4.0,"Super cute, definitely needs ironing. My 1 year old wife the 2T"
4.0,"I ordered a size small even though I am normally a medium and this was somewhat too large ;  too big to wear comfortably to go out so with great reluctance I must return the piece ,  which is very nice ;  love the color block."
4.0,It is very long and heavy.
4.0,This dress is so cute & fit perfectly however the split in the front is dramatic so if you're not paying attention & a good breeze kicks up you may be showing off a little more than planned... Proper undergarments are a must!
4.0,The pint logo is plasticity.. and they fit big.  Size small fits like a medium.
4.0,These shorts are pretty comfortable but the fit was just slightly small. Not like a whole size small just slightly smaller. They're good for relaxing around the house or working out like jogging. The pockets don't zip up which is one of the only things I don't like about it. You can't really do anything athletic with stuff in your pockets. But they've lasted and haven't really gotten worn over the last several months.
4.0,"A thick and well made henley shirt for everyday wear, both as an inside or an outside layer of clothing. Regular three-button front with no collar. Soft out of the bag, it has a structure that will hold up for many wearings. It softens up with a wash and does not shrink. Size-wise, it runs a bit larger than expected, so if on the border between sizes, you might want to go smaller.<br />The oatmeal color looks good and it has a classic look that is functional and sharp. The weave is fairly tight and may take a few washes before it feels “soft.”<br /><br />– Comfortable and well made, a classic henley with 3 buttons<br />– Oatmeal color is attractive, looks solid and wears nicely<br />– Sizes run a bit large so size down if on the border between sizes<br />– I expect it will soften up after a few more washings, but it does not appear that it will shrink"
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter,  she loves them."
4.0,my daughter love this!!
4.0,"Cute, but I wish the beading was in both sides."
4.0,"Cheap an cute, fits comfortably. The only issue is that it did start to fall apart after a couple wears, but that's to be expected at it's price. Still a solid product, I'd definitely recommend."
4.0,"Had to size up for it to fit perfectly but for it being a white gown this is beautiful. I used it for my Halloween costume and received a lot of comments. It’s soft, easy to move around in and the best part is that it doesn’t require a bra."
4.0,"I bought them for 88 bucks here, but know they're discontinued so it might be a bit more expensive, but please, dont overvalue it! I got them and they fell from my bed and the hinge twisted as soon as it hitted the floor so they're not that resistent! Be careful buying these pair of glasses, anyways they're pretty cool and im definitely getting another one!"
4.0,I loved the color but unfortunately size M was too tight for my bottom and size L was too baggy around neck
4.0,These are colorful and seem well made.
4.0,"As others have said, definitely get a size up. Even then it certainly favors the slimmer build. I have a pretty small chest size and it was still felt like a race fit jersey. That said, I happen to like the fit and the rubber grippers along the bottom do their job nicely. As they should considering the price. Speaking of price, it's priced as a jersey that you should actually wear. This jersey is not just for cosplay, it's a very ridable jersey and feels like a quality jersey. The only gripe I have about the quality that had me knock a star off the review is the collar. It's really floppy in the front and kind of annoying at times. I never ever fully zip it because of this. The zipper itself I've had minor inconveniences with but nothing too bad. If you're looking for a jersey you actually want to ride in this is for you most definitely. I would recommend it as a daily driver jersey, not so much a race day jersey as the back does not breathe all that well. But at this price I wouldn't expect it to anyway, so it's not a big deal to me. I thought it was so cool to see a replica jersey of a show I love that is actually worth buying. Extremely satisfied with this product. If you love the show and you love riding, look no further. It's not too good to be true. Just get it."
4.0,"I ordered for a Christmas present. It said PRIME delivery but it actually took almost a week ford delivery. Nevertheless, the quality was great and my daughter loved it."
4.0,A little tight around the waist but still worth the purchase.
4.0,"Decent product, and fits well. The description says there is breathable mesh at the mouth, but there is not. It's solid rubber. Pretty difficult to breathe in. I'm going to make some holes in it and see how much it helps."
4.0,There isn't anything I found wrong with this bag. Hornet I did return it because it wad not exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"Pretty. I ordered these b/c I had a similar pair set in gold that I wore a lot before a few of the stones fell out. These will look better w/ anything Silver, but not in combination with Gold earrings. Also the posts are extra long at least for me. I find this especially bothersome when I have the phone up to my ear. Otherwise I think I’ll keep them though as they are really pretty. Nice bling."
4.0,The pad is like any pad I have used in thickness and feel. The print is nice and it looks very good. The only issue I have is it has a strong odor to it. I hope this will go away after a few days. I don't think it will be strong enough to bother me at my desk but Ill see this week.<br />If it bothers me and fails to go away I will update this review.<br />UPDATE<br />The odor has not been noticeable in the office and even putting the pad near your nose it is not nearly as strong as it was the first few days.
4.0,Cute but not a lot of variety
4.0,the style didn’t look great on me so i bought others and realized how much of a yellow tint these have! they were great at blocking the blue light but the yellow tint bothered me a lot.
4.0,"Nice shirt, fits well and is very comfortable."
4.0,Runs a little on the large size.
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful, but it took a couple months to get here... I almost forgot I had ordered it."
4.0,Small size is a bit big but feels very comfortable. After wash it should fit considerably better. Material use is quite good and is not the see through shirt
4.0,very soft comfortable vest that is reversible. Beautiful Lilac color but runs small. Definitely order a size up if you want to zip and feel comfortable.
4.0,The bottoms are pretty small and very thin. Love the top.
4.0,Good watch for the price. Light weight. Built in light is lacking.
4.0,"This tunic is very cute, the fabric is great quality. It's not as long as I expected, it only just covers my butt and I'm 5'5,  the sleeves are a tad long as well. Other than that I love it, just have to see how it holds up in the wash. I wear a M-L women's and I bought the 6x. Already planning on purchasing another in a different color. 😊"
4.0,"The green is much deeper than I initially expected, though this is no fault of the product, I realize now it's not the most appropriate to wear with anything red, at least not until winter. Such comfortable fabric, these fleece crews are what I'm living in these days and I can't imagine not having one on at every inappropriate time."
4.0,"cute, but for a small wrist (which i don't have). great price"
4.0,"Very different and distinctive. I get a lot of compliments on it, and people assume it cost considerably more (which is NOT why I bought it). It is a big watch, but I'm a big guy (6'4""), so bear that in mind."
4.0,"I am moving into a size large status and this shrug fits just fine. Buying it was a risk because the item pictured was red, and the description said maroon. I did not want maroon, I wanted a deep red, and I couldn't find any other buyers to vouch for what color the item was. But I went ahead and ordered it anyway, and it turned out my monitor was correct and the description was wrong. It is a deep red, which matches the dress I bought it for perfectly."
4.0,Don't fit as shown however I mix up with other pieces
4.0,Very nice and cute but 34 was more like 30 or 32 and not alot of fabric length wise that we needed otherwise perfect if petite.
4.0,I like the band but if you have thin wrist like me. You will want to cut some off. I didn’t like the extra hanging off. Just make sure you burn the edge a little so it doesn’t come unravel.
4.0,"I was worried about the fit but I’m a curvy girl, Im 5’4”, 175ibs and I’m a 36DDD and the large fit pretty good! However, the color was not as pink as the photo. More like a tan color. And a bit longer then I expected, came right to my knees"
4.0,"I loves this shirt.  The comfort and fit is perfect!  I have yet to wash it, however I do expect some shrinkage. I love the lettering on the shirt and the smile it brought to my boyfriend. Thank you for a great shopping  experience"
4.0,Very short but cute w bloomers. Ordered size 4/5.
4.0,"I love it. But I thought I ordered the bigger size. For the extra money, go for the bigger size. Also there's one black piece missing but I don't know if it occurred when I transferred it or if it came like that. The women's left hand is missing, but it doesn't take away from the overall effect."
4.0,A bit small but lycra makes it fit pretty well. Has lots of give.
4.0,Okay so - I waited 6 days to get this. I became super obsessed with having an all matching outfit that didn’t have a crop top.<br />So shipping was long. Boo!!<br />I got the outfit yesterday and immediately put it on. I ordered a M but a S would’ve been so much better. (I’m 31 years old. 5’6 and less then 135 pounds) I normally wear biker shorts so I expected them to fit like biker shorts.<br /><br />They’re a little loose and felt more like PJs vs a causal outfit at first. After about an hour I actually liked them. I wore them all day and it didn’t get any looser so that’s a plus!<br /><br />Now I wore mine outside yesterday (August 18th 2021) in GA so it’s VERY HOT outside.<br /><br />Even in the shade I was still sweating a lot. The material is just thick and has no air flow.<br /><br />However at the end of the night I realized just how much I loved this outfit!! For 10 bucks you really can’t beat it!!<br /><br />I am going right now to order another set.
4.0,"One has to love multi-use/multi-function garments.  One can easily use this as a scarf, shawl, swimsuit cover up, a head wrap, or for added color to a plain shirt or skirt.<br /><br />This is nice and sheer. It's very lightweight.  My husband's Aunt loves this.  She is completing her 2nd round of Chemo and Radiation and wears this as a headwrap and a scarf.  This would be nicer, if the buttons was the same color as the material and NOT white and stand out so much.  She says this is very breathable on her bald head. She likes this, but not a fan of the white buttons, either, otherwise she likes it.<br /><br />☆☆DISCLAIMER: I did receive this Simplicity women's convertible beach cover up at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"Very beautiful! Nice size, great sparkle!"
4.0,This is a very nice bag. The straps are very well made and the outside of the bad. The inside lining feels thin and cheap tho.<br /><br />The gun pocket zips all the way around giving you more flexible access to your firearm. However I want the option grab from the top and my glock 43 can only sit to grab from sides .<br /><br />I like that there is a pocket on the inside of the flap and place for a pen. My wallet barely fits in the main area.<br /><br />It is a smaller purse which I do like but I wish it was sliglthy taller and wider.<br /><br />Have to return it since it doesn't quite match my checklist. I have been on a long hunt for the conceal carry crossbody that fits my needs.
4.0,"I bought this for a theme party.  I wasn’t expecting to wear it again, but the quality is good enough that I might.  If you have the money and time, it might be worth it to try both the size you’re rated for on their scale (which I find big) and the size below.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. I’m 5’9” and it is definitely long enough for me.  Hits 2-3 inches above the knee<br />2. The fabric is nice enough that it doesn’t feel super cheap.<br />3. Cute print<br />4. Unique collar<br /><br />Negatives<br />1. I had to sew the button placket partially shut because of gaps.  This doesn’t make a lot of sense considering that it’s sort of too big across the chest.<br />2. I had to sew the armholes smaller.<br />3. The skirt is transparent enough that you need a slip or shorts.<br />4. The band at the waist has been sewn up towards the chest rather than down.  This makes an empire waist.  I was ready to alter this myself but it can’t be done without major surgery involving the zipper.  I tried tying the sash around my back after looping around the front, but the skirt doesn’t look right."
4.0,"This dress looks just like the pictures! It fits great, has tons of stretch too! It’s beautiful. Its also very long, so if you’re not tall, that could be an issue. Other than that I have zero complaints!"
4.0,"Nice brown color. Ordered xl, but seems smaller and thicker material but nice quality."
4.0,this was a gift. she loved it and still wears it.
4.0,"They fit a bit smaller than normal US womens sizes, but the shoes do look great and I'm still pleased with the purchaes"
4.0,"This is a great fitting casual blazer. It is well made and comfortable. The sleeves hit right at my wrists. If you like longer sleeves or a looser fit, I’d size up one. The only reason why I took off a star was due to the gathering at the wrists. I didn’t care for them all that much. The buttons cannot be undone. It’s just for looks. I am looking forward to wearing this to work."
4.0,"my job involves much driving on an ATV on dirt roads. For sun protection, I wear a hat with a wide brim. This  Bickmore Kahl liquid when applied to the felt will keep the brim from turning up. It took me repeated treatments but it works. As advertised, it does not affect the color of the felt. I wear Stetson XXX hat. I like it and will use it again."
4.0,"I have bought a few lace bralets and lingerie and this has fit my big boobs the best. The thong was not a great fit, the crouch strap is to long."
4.0,"I'm not sure that these help with my foot pain, but I was just trying them out without any expectations that they would magically solve my issues. The compression feels good, I do wear them often. It feels great to take them off and let your feet stretch and breathe!"
4.0,brought with on travel for an evening event
4.0,I got these for my daughter since her other ones were too weak.  These however are almost too strong in the largest size for a little girls ear lobes.  She started complaining after an hour.
4.0,"Seems to be well-made but runs a bit small.  My 12-month-old granddaughter normally wears 18-month outfits, but these fit her well."
4.0,This is a bit big for my daughter hopefully it will fit by summer. Material is good it looks well made. Fingers crossed it will fit by summer
4.0,Don't come up high enough over my heel but do not slip off. Would be better if they came up a little higher with a tab to pull on.
4.0,The smallest one is so hard to get apart. I spend a good 2 hours trying to get it apart.
4.0,Very handy got them for friends who use chapstick and they loved them! Now they don’t have to dig through their purse to find it!
4.0,Runs a little big but it’s cute and comfy
4.0,Great Apple alternative.  I have an original modern buckle in black that I didn't want to wear out so I sourced other vendors.  This band is true to the description.  The only difference that I notice between this version and an original is that the leather is slightly thicker and subsequently stiffer....still a great band!
4.0,Easy to trim and fit like a glove.  Love the racket style.
4.0,Esta buena pero me quedo pequeña
4.0,I DIDN'T ORDER THESE RINGS.  I'M RETURNING THEM.  NOT MY STYLE!
4.0,Great look. Love the warm and cozy fur lining. Good sole. Runs a bit small. I got a size 1 for my daughter but her feet are almost to the end. They will last the winter. She seems to like them.
4.0,"These are much nicer than I thought they would be, they are a nice material and comfortable to wear as well as stylish."
4.0,Look just like the picture. Came when I wanted it too as well. I look forward to purchasing more frme rare love.
4.0,BODY FIT IS PERFECT BUT LEGS DOESN'T MATCH BODY FIT WAY TO BIG AND LOOKS BAD
4.0,Was large and flowy - just how I like it! Material was a little heavy for Florida summers but nothing I can't deal with. Very happy with this top!
4.0,"They look good, are comfortable, but thin. Great price for 6, though."
4.0,theyre sooo cute and i do love them! just theyre bigger than i thought so cant wear more than one on my ear like i wanted. otherwise i think theyre great:) so detailed
4.0,Keeping my arms cool & protected from the sun<br />I have large biceps so I can only wear them up to my elbows
4.0,"my grandson loves it, he's called me using it, I can hear him crystal clear, nicely packaged"
4.0,Perfect fit bu tends to wrinkle easily
4.0,I liked the material however it wasn’t as long as I had hoped.
4.0,I’m missing the pink hat.
4.0,"Very see thru, but it was worn under a knee length dress so it served it's purpose."
4.0,"Good ,,"
4.0,Only complaint is if you move your arm / wrist to quick the band will pinch you cuz it is magnetic. Other than that I love it!
4.0,"Good quality, but way too small.  I'm usually a small size shirt, but ordered the small,  medium and large with no luck."
4.0,"Coloring is a bit off from the picture, but still very nice. Also it was delivered in a very timely manner, which I appreciate."
4.0,It is what is expected
4.0,"This was for my grand kids so I got 3 sizes. One would normally wear a size 6, those were out of stock so I went for 7/8. Glad I did, it just did fit, the bottoms are perfect, the tops are slightly smaller than expected around the shoulders/arms. Almost form-fitting. Regardless, they were a big hit and so adorable!"
4.0,what is not to love?
4.0,"My kid is thick so I was worried that her calves wouldn’t fit well in the boot, to my surprise they have some stretch. Very flexible rubber, and a good soul. Very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,It's a little smaller then expected but to be fair I have alot of hair. It's cute and i love it. It's a tad pricey but if you want a kuromi hat this is the best one
4.0,We used them for off roading during our vacation and they performed well!
4.0,Everything you need for the look is included.  Quality of fairly good for the price.
4.0,the wool is not itchy and it's nice andcwarm
4.0,I ordered an XXL because I have a large bust.  However this dress was too big in th waist.  I kept the dress and plan to have the waist taken in.  I love the fabric and the length of the dress.  Very chic.
4.0,"It is gorgeous.  The first one had a hole, but it was replaced and my first purchase was re-credited quickly.  I bought it as a gift for my small daughter-in-law.  As it fit her perfectly, I know that the one size won't fit me."
4.0,The owl pendant is very nice crafted but I had to purchase a different chain because the one that came with the pendant was not if sufficiently good quality
4.0,"Good quality lace, excellent for the price!"
4.0,For my daughter. She likes it a lot.
4.0,"Received the bag and put it to work immediately.  Nice size, fits in overhead bin easily.  Packed the bag with 2 large and 1 medium compression bags plus toiletries for a 5 day trip.  It was full, but very manageable.  I did swap out the shoulder strap for a more padded version, The straps would be my only complaint, but for the price and quality of bag and zipper, still a good deal.."
4.0,very comfortable fit for the price
4.0,Pretty necklace but chain is way longer than I expected and it only fastens in one place.
4.0,"Did the job. Pulled my hair a bit, but that’s to be expected when silicone is involved near hair."
4.0,Fits great.  Material is a little flimsier than expected so I have only worn it as a nightgown.  May try to wear it as cover up over swimsuit
4.0,I was looking for a special gift for my Nana and this bracelet caught my eye on a review site. I got a discount for my review. It came in on time and is really pretty. It ways more than I expected and the size is small.
4.0,perfect size for my nephews. stayed on his feet with minimum sand in his shoes
4.0,smaller than i thought but still very cool and sharp looking
4.0,"These shoes are darling, but caused blisters on the ankles where the strap connects, even while wearing tights.  We've learned to wear bandages and keep some spares with us.  Some things are just worth it. :-)"
4.0,"My wife has a different pair of Olieye sunglasses and they were a hit and now so are this new pair.  The navy blue frames are nicely offset by turquoise colored mirrored lenses and gold sidearms.  The navy blue adds a nautical touch that will look great by the pool, ocean, lake or on a boat somewhere or just driving to grocery store.  The one knock is that the frames seem a bit flimsy so they aren't going to withstand too much hard use."
4.0,"Good strong material, very cute"
4.0,"I love the cute designs and the non-skid feature.<br />I ordered the 1-3T. The fabric is on the thin side, and there are some loose threads inside the socks. But the price is right, and little kid socks tend to disappear, so you need more pairs of socks than you’d expect."
4.0,I totally love this top. Sizing is on point...it has a fair amount of stretch. It's short though. Little over my navel which is not a problem for me at all.
4.0,"I like this but it's more a top than a dress, I'm 5'7 and 175, 38 C I am more top heavy, I just was able to button and my arms barely fit, but I do have big arms. I will post a picture later.  You can actually tie the belt in the front or back.  I like the front look best"
4.0,"It was a nice dress, however it wasn't what I expected. So I returned it ."
4.0,good for the price..
4.0,They do run small more suitable for women sizing however they have a nice thick sole and heel so I'm hoping they will last as the popular brands have all started making their socks thinner and begin to develop holes in heels after a short period of time wearing them. These have a nice snug fit and don't seem to slip at all. Will need to see how they hold up over time but first impressions seem positive.
4.0,Love them. You might want to go up<br />One waist size otherwise comfortable.
4.0,Super comfortable dress! I'm a 34DDD and the large fits great in the chest. Also currently breastfeeding and this dress works great for feeding baby.
4.0,"This dress is great! Super comfy and fits great! Length was down a few inches above the ankle! Great with flats, heals and flip flops! Material was not transparent and not heavy at all! Definitely going to order it in a different color!"
4.0,"This looks like  standard wrap dress, but it's closer to parting at the belt near the middle. Nothing overlapped beyond the part under the belt o.O Had to return cause there was just not enough fabric to truly wrap around. Beautiful fabric though!"
4.0,Was everything I expected.
4.0,"They are nice material, easy to pick though"
4.0,"Ordered one for mother in-law.. she loves it, now I have to get one for myself"
4.0,Great support just inaccurate description.
4.0,They're a super soft material but they stay up. They're great for the gym or staying in bed. I love the color scheme. The only thing is they're kind of pricey but they're good undies.
4.0,I love this sleep shirt.  It's very comfortable and well made.
4.0,"I got this dress for a military ball. If you need a dress that looks expense for low price this dress is great. The material is very comfortable, very stretchy as well.  It was slightly heavy but nothing too annoying. I got a Lrg. I'm 5'6 and wearing flats it did not cover my feet. At any point if you are going to be walking through gravel or grass make sure you lift the dress as leaves and twigs get easily caught in the lace."
4.0,Pretty dress. I bought the red one which is really not a true red but more of a reddish orange. I loved the pattern and the fit plus the material isn’t thin so no slip is needed. The only thing that I didn’t like was that it wasn’t long enough. I ordered a medium and I’m 5’7/155 it just brushed the top of my feet. I’m keeping it though. I’ll just wear it with flats. If you’re under 5’5 you could probably wear it with platforms.
4.0,"These came a day earlier than expected.  We used them as one of the prizes in a pinata for a college graduation party.  They were a big hit!  They are cheaply made, but work well, and were lots of fun."
4.0,"Little tricky too open, and I am worried that closing them and then reusing again will make them bend too much out of shape.<br /><br />I did return these only because they weren’t large enough for where my piercing is. Otherwise, it seems completely fine, and the colors are true to the image. I really, really loved the rainbow one!"
4.0,seems very nice
4.0,The print on this mask is really cute and the lining on the inside of the mask is smooth and comfortable to wear for long hours. The only downside is that the filter pocket in the lining is really large and tries to jump in my mouth when I talk.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. The faberic is very sher and see thru. The sleeves are shorter than the picture describes. We are pleased with the purchase.
4.0,"So, I read all the reviews and decided to buy this dress anyway for my daughter to wear for her school's Mickey and Minnie Mouse show. So far I am very pleased with the look and quality for the price ($24 with tax). I gave this dress 4 stars because it did meet my expectations, I did not expect a Disney Store quality dress or a lesser quality than it actually is. I think this dress is perfect for a one time use but can be used multiple times. I was able to iron it (inside out of course) and it looks amazing on my daughter. The dress fit my daughter very well too. She is 8 years old and I usually get her 10-12 sizes in clothing but I decided to get the 7/8 because it was the largest size for the price. I am glad that it fit her perfectly. One thing I did not expect was the back of the dress having no dots, not a deal breaker, I just did not notice before I purchased. I liked that the dress comes with the headband too, it is what convinced me to buy this dress. The headband works well and I am pleased with it. Overall, If you are looking for a reasonable priced dress that looks good and have a decent quality, I would recommend this dress."
4.0,"This is decent, not something I'd wear if I were a male underwear model though. Biggest catch I thought was the stitching in the crotch area is a bit off. Not a big issue since I won't be showing this off. Generally, I like it, comfortable to wear and it is stretchy. Garter quality's nice and the material used is like a quick dry fabric. The cut hole for the legs are also appropriate, just like a traditional men's brief. I only got 1 and wish I got 3 at least."
4.0,"This was a little too tight around the chest, this can be attributed to the stretchy fabric in that spot. The stretch is there so that it can be situated for breast feeding and still fit snuggly as to not leave room for exposure when not feeding. It’s logical. But if you are big chested maybe order up. It was not quite as along as I expected.<br />This was very easy to breastfeed in. My favorite sweatshirt so far!"
4.0,"Almost as good as a fine couture line product, but much less expensive"
4.0,"This Salwar Chemise suit is beautiful, fits well, and my daughter loves it!  However, after washing it once the glue used for attaching the sparkle gems dissolved in the water and nearly all of the gems fell off.  I would totally purchase an outfit from this vendor again, if I new that the embellishment were more permanently attached to the garment.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the suit."
4.0,Nice even it was $40. Holds a deceiving amount. Would recommend
4.0,"I like the design and the fabric. Stitching is low quality; the pattern was developed in Asia. As the collar is too broad, sleeves are way too long, and it's too tight under the breast. It's kind of not proportionally measured. It's a common mistake of clothes are made in Asia and not purposely ordered for a euro market. I saw this kind of mistake in clothing when I lived in India. But I like this piece anyway, mainly for the look. If you are not tight on budget, look for something else."
4.0,I’m only giving 4 out of 5 stars because one of my bracelets didn’t appear to be completed? There were beads on one side but not the other? The other 5 are very pretty!
4.0,A little small but it was okay for my needs.
4.0,"The shirt feels and looks nice, but it runs a little small in my opinion. I like my shirts a little loose. I bought an XL but I’m returning it and getting an XXL and see how that fits. I’m not a big either. 5’10 200. If I were to have washed this XL, I bet it would’ve turned into an L. Material feels great and is a comfortable shirt."
4.0,This looks nice and is pretty soft as well.  But it is hard to remove once you get it on so be careful taking it off when you go to change them. Other than that really like the band.<br />Side note... this will not fit the S2 classic version.
4.0,"The dress is perfect for a date night type dress. It seems pretty plain but that's the beauty of being able to pile on accessories!! The deep V is not as revealing (at least on me anyway) which I actually like better so I don't feel like I'm exposing too much. It is a bit on the short side, even for a 5'1&#34; girl like me but it's not so short that I feel like I'll be sharing too much. I also love the fact that the ruched style hides my post pregnancy pooch fairly well. The teal color is a bit getting use too. Would have liked it better If it was more vibrant. To me it's a bit dull to look at.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review"
4.0,"I'm big in the chest. Glad I ordered up a size. Very sexy- not tons of support. Definitely more of a laying around, flaunting your stuff suit and not a splashing and swimming suit."
4.0,"Went up a size and it fits nicely. Material is a bit rough but whatever, it's a cheap, short sleeve shirt that looks nice."
4.0,"Fit the calf a little tighter than I would have liked, but they are super cute!"
4.0,"Runs a little small, but nice hat."
4.0,"Fit nicely, they feel good on.Being petite they are a bit long but that can be remedied. Other than that I'm satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"The D-Tasks Men’s Military Style Shoulder Bag was a perfect companion for my long weekend in New York City.  I was looking for something smaller than a backpack, but large enough to hold a light jacket, hat, my mirrorless digital camera, sunglasses, tissues, some medicine, and all the miscellaneous whatever you want to have at hand while touring.  This bag is small enough to hang on my shoulder, tucked between my side and elbow.  The strap was long enough to also hang crossbody (I am 6 feet/1.83m).<br /><br />The bag has one large zipper-close compartment with a few pockets sewn into the interior sides; and an exterior zip pocket the full size of the bag, which was great for storing papers and other flat items.  There is a fold-over flap which hooks shut and small zip or snap close compartments both on and under this flap.  The biggest issue I had was remembering which pocket would had the sanitizer and which my polarizing lens. At each end of the bag are small elastic pockets which worked well holding a water bottle and a mini umbrella.  The bag was small enough that I was not asked to check it at the several museums and theatres I visited.<br /><br />The minor points which prevent this from being a “5”: The bag cannot be secured with a small padlock, or the like.  The loop and metal hook which secure the flap are more cosmetic than functional; it really does not keep the bag closed.  And the water resistance will protect contents in the lightest of rains, but beware of getting caught in something more.<br /><br />That all said, I looked at over 100 bags online and selected this D-Task.  Given a second chance, I would do it again."
4.0,"I love this top..... I like the long length, and how it fits...."
4.0,"Looks great! The only complaint is that it runs on your motion, meaning that when it sits on the dresser overnight, you have to reset the time in the morning."
4.0,"I've only rated it 4 stars because of regional restriction around my country for shipping address mixup , nothing to do with the actual arm band ."
4.0,Took a little longer to get here but it's a nice hat.
4.0,"I bought these for a trip and unfortunately can't use them because they were too big. I read the reviews and bought a size 33. I am 5'3, 145lbs, waist 34 and hips 37. I don't have big hips or thighs. The crotch area was too loose and the top part didn't hug my waist because it was too big. It also didn't hug my legs. Hope this helps someone else."
4.0,"Decent material, not sheer, fits comfortably with an elastic waist, not too short."
4.0,"Great quality, and attractive. I have average sized wrists so the bracelet fits me quite nicely. I wouldn't recommend it for a woman having a larger than average wrist. The clasp is very secure and closes with a magnet. Very good quality for an exceptionally low price."
4.0,You get what you pay for. These are cute and with a nice pair of insoles they work well as my work boots. (I work in retail)
4.0,Can't believe I got compliments on my new belt!  Only reason rating is less than perfect is because female buckle receiver is about 1/8&#34; wider than leather belt and I would like the belt as wide as possible.
4.0,"I love this bracelet! I got some for my bridesmaids and myself. It's delicate, but not to where you're afraid it'll break and you have to stretch it to get it on, but it's as beautiful as the picture."
4.0,"Fits perfect, but the length is slightly shorter than expected! Doesn't cover the feet and I'm 5'4 175lbs (goes a little past the ankle)"
4.0,Great dress but I'd recommend buying a size larger than you usually wear. The fabric is a little see thru so you will need to wear some kind of slip underneath.
4.0,They're really cute. The soles are pretty hard.
4.0,Fits well and the material is great.
4.0,Very good quality for the price.  Fits as expected and looks beautiful with a petticoat underneath!
4.0,not meant for men with larger wrists.
4.0,"Wash it a few times and it will be much softer, it's definitely a strong material that will hold up in the wash too. A little tight but overall comfy, maybe order a size up if you are chesty."
4.0,"Great price on a great legging, nice and warm."
4.0,Wore these flip flops all summer through the early fall. Very comfortable.
4.0,"really stylish and seems to be well made, and will definitely get you some compliments! i'm a very thin fella and the small is long enough to cover my torso and the sleeves reach my wrists, but MAN it is tight - so much so, that I won't wear it unless I have a blazer or vest to add some bulk to the shape of my torso (skinny person problems). should've gone with a medium for a looser fit as that's my preference for turtle necks, but, it's still really stylish. i'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Good to find in dark, but the wristlet is too small around wrists and the band is easily rip able at least mines was within a couple days it ripped."
4.0,Love the belt. Not as thick as I thought it was gonna be is the only downside. Nice belt for the money.
4.0,"Had a small hole in the pocket on arrival , the first time I put my hand in the same pocket , the seam on the side of it started to tear. Otherwise it's cute and comfy. Not for really cold weather , not really waterproof."
4.0,they are adorable but just a bit tight around my daughter's calf with blue jeans on.
4.0,Its a nice hoodie but I think it's a little small.
4.0,"They're comfortable; a relaxing fit, and pretty good craftsmanship. The only issue is the thread in the seams. Anyone who spends time camping or using nylon rope knows the trick of melting loose thread ends to prevent fraying. That works here but be extremely careful. Polyester doesn't just burn, it also melts. But with proper care and safety these shirts look great, feel great, and last a good long time. Also make extra sure you check the fit of the shirt when it arrives. I purchased five shirts (in varying colors) and all but one fit perfectly. The fifth was marked the same size as the others but was actually two sizes smaller. That one I was able to return without any trouble at all and I'll be re-ordering that color soon."
4.0,not the best quality but great for a Halloween prop
4.0,"Great shirt, the colors are even brighter in person than they are on the computer. It was a little big, I got a small (I'm 5'3, 105 lbs) and it was kinda baggy. The front especially was big, made for someone with a large chest. I just tightened the strings so nobody could see down my shirt. I will still wear it."
4.0,"Bought for my 10 year old daughter.  She is of average weight but is tall for her age.  The length was surprisingly good but she complained that the waist was a bit snug.  They fit well enough that she wants to keep them, but the waistband does seem to bother her a bit."
4.0,"It is not to be worn every day, but it is good quality!"
4.0,"I purchased this to use in the hospital after delivering my daughter. It is quite thin, but it's great to use for nursing and I really love the color. The purple is dark and it's one of my favorite colors."
4.0,"I have recently purchased a few similar fashion women padded sports bras just like this one from Funky Outdoor Sports Cropped Tank Top, and I have loved them, and then I saw this pattern and style and wanted to get it for sure!<br /><br />I really love this sports bra, I was so happy when I felt the material because this bra feels so slinky and cool, it has a wonderfully stretchy spandex feel, feels cool and silky and it feels tight but not too tight in all the right places.<br /><br />The best thing about this bra is how unique the patterns are for these bras, I think they are very different as compared to sports bras found in the department stores.  I haven't seen things this much fun on bras before, and for a reasonable price. You can have a comfortable sports bra that is full of cool and crazy patterns and shapes that looks really unique and can really jazz up and be worn with a lot of different types of outfits - and for different styles!<br /><br />This one was my pick because I love the mix of the light pink and blue that melt into each other to create the night sky.  What I don't love is on the back of this bra, the silhouette of the buck is upside down.  Not sure why they did that?<br /><br />Colors are rich and vibrant, and the shapes and pattern meet at all the seams and edges, it does not look sloppy at all! I love that I can wear this under a dress or shirt and it just offers great coverage (I wouldn't say high coverage for running and doing a lot of movement activity, but for yoga, gardening, or other light activity, for my size, (32 A-B) it feels great). My fiance is a big kayaker so I plan on wearing this out on our kayaking trips, because then I don't have to pack a separate bathing suit, I can just wear this on the river, get it wet, and then it will dry quickly and I can wear on the beach, or under my clothes. I also plan on wearing this biking, pretty much for the same reason, it is super cute and performs the way it should!<br /><br />I have bought sports bras for the longest time, I played field hockey and lacrosse for years, and I remember when this type of material came out, all of the sudden, we didn't have to wear cotton sports bras that didn't wick away moisture, we could breathe! That is why I love this material, and I have bought other bras that are similar to these with the shiny spandex feel and they feel the same when compared to this one, and the higher-priced bras, I do not notice a difference. I have already bought a few different patterns and plan on buying a few more, maybe the black, white, and silver bra - because that will probably match with everything!"
4.0,"Good quality! The pockets lay well, no bulge on the hip"
4.0,"It was as beautiful in person as it was on screen. And the finish inside is as professional and tidy as anything I've seen. Excellent quality in workmanship and material!<br /><br />The sizing is a bit tricky IMO though. Because the top is very tailored, be careful measuring your bust for sizing, any space on the waist can be pulled in with the cinched corset. It was too long but most things are for me, so that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />I had to get extra material added to the flap at the back since it's cut to a triangle rather than a square and wasn't covering enough towards the bottom of the triangle."
4.0,"Works as advertised.  However, the pump action is not efficient and difficult to use."
4.0,I bought my son girlfriend this turtle bracelet. I thought it was the cutes thing i have seen in a turtle.
4.0,Very very cute but would not fit me in my chest area.
4.0,Works as expected...wife loves them!
4.0,Followed the size chart but it was still SO tight! Wore it anyway as it was just for a theme party. I did gets lots of complements!
4.0,"This is by far the softest Kimono I've ever put on. Sizing is on par with KNGZ Gi's. That's slightly above the average. If you're teetering between sizes, I would go with the smaller. I'll probably end up exchanging this down a size. The lapel tales are a little longer, which really help keep it tucked while rolling. Overall, if you're looking for a great comfortable basic Gi to get started, save your money and start here."
4.0,Nice fitting in the waist almost a tad bit loose in the top area
4.0,The clasp in the back to take off and put on is very strange and difficult to do by yourself or without a mirror. Don't understand why they chose that clasp but it's beautiful and I get a lot of compliments and still send people the link to buy it.
4.0,Slightly smaller fit then would like.
4.0,"Smaller than my thumb nail, but 925 silver stamped & super cute.  ( red enamel/bow)"
4.0,"There's not a heck of a lot to say about this; it's a glasses case with MOLL-E attachments.  That part is fairly obvious, and you can make your own logical inferences about how you might use it.  The one aspect that wasn't immediately apparent to me was the 'shockproof' aspect -- it's a semi-hard case; that's all that I was expecting in terms of shock-proofing.<br /><br />Actually, it has a flexible panel, inside, that anything (i.e., glasses) you put inside is resting on, and more or less cocooned by, once it's zipped closed -- it does a surprisingly good job of cushioning things.  In my case, I have a cheap plastic eyeglass case for the glasses I stick in it, but it's still got enough space to hold the entire case AND zip closed, while providing some nice security.  Since I have it hooked to a 'go' bag, I appreciate it being sturdy enough to not worry about bumping it into things, and the shock-proofing helps keep from having my lenses pop out or anything like that.  (It's not a hard-shell, so if you put your glasses directly into it you should realize how much protection you have and don't have -- me sticking another case into it, tho, leaves it pretty solid, for me.)<br /><br />As to the MOLL-E connections.. Well, I have it on a bag with MOLL-E connections, so I've got it connected several ways -- the strap AND the clip.  Is it necessary?  I'm certain it's not; I just like the extra security of the redundancy."
4.0,"I’m 5’2 and 130 lbs. These are the warmest stocking ever! The only thing is that they run really large. they’re a better fit for taller people, but I make them work. They also don’t hold in any tummy fat. Love them anyway!"
4.0,"I think the inner diameter is too big. I was using it on a t-shirt that was too big but it slid off while on a walk, just did not fit tight enough!"
4.0,Great socks. My husband is happy with them.
4.0,"The quality is mostly fine. It’s a bit lightweight in the material, and the logo doesn’t really look as if it will last for years to come. But, if you want a shootin’ hat, it’s fine."
4.0,"This is a great swimsuit.  The style is very flattering especially for my size 16 body.  It has a very supportive bra inset, which gives the full figured woman the extra support she needs.  I especially like the skirt like front which adds to the retro look of the suit.  The tucks around the waist are very  slimming and adds a lot of style to the suit.  The suit has a low back and a snug fit on your bottom.  The price of the suit is very reasonable for the quality.  It looks great in and out of the water.  I received this bathing suit for free or a discounted price for my unbiased review.  The suit comes in three colors.  I purchased the black which is very nice, but I like the suit so much, I will want one in each color!"
4.0,Cute little purse. The smaller pouch inside has a small opening so its harder to grab things out from there. Otherwise cute.

4.0,"This is a terrific bag with an unbelievable price.  It looks very much like real leather, and there was absolutely no unpleasant smell when I received it.  The only reason I didn’t give it 4 stars is because of the yellow drawstrings.  First of all, I think the yellow color cheapens the look of the bag, and second, the strings are much too long.  I cut them off to a much shorter length and tied a knot at the end.  That improved the look of the bag quite a bit, but there is still the yellow color.  I may remove the drawstrings altogether, since I don’t consider them essential to the function or security of the bag. I bought two of them with the thought of gifting one.  I will still do this, but I will probably remove the yellow drawstrings first.  Since I don’t consider the strings to be a particularly useful or essential part of the bag, I hope they do not deter anyone from purchasing this cute little bag.  Just cut the length of the strings or remove them altogether.  The bag is just the right size to carry the things you need to have with you, and the shoulder strap is a comfortable width.  The colors are beautiful.  I got the gray and the burgundy.<br /><br />If the manufacturers should happen to read this review, I urge you to stop using the long yellow drawstrings.  Instead shorten them and change the color to be the same as the purse.  I understand you want your purses to stand out from other bags, but I don’t believe using the bright yellow color is the way to go.  Maybe you could add a zipper logo fob or add a logo fob to dangle from the shoulder strap.  Also, you could guarantee an increase in sales if you would add a “key keeper” to the inside of your bags. There is not a woman alive who doesn’t want this simple little feature. Unfortunately, it is generally only found on high-end purses which are too expensive for most of us to afford.  If you begin offering a “key keeper” in all your bags and feature it in your advertising and descriptions, women will buy your purses.  If I had the wherewithal, I would  guarantee it!"
4.0,Good purchase. Wanted all occasion dress to dress up or down. Fabric a bit thinner than expected but falls nicely over body.<br />Olive green color is lovely.
