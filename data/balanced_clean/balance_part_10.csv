3.0,"I actually really love this dress, however, I have tried everything to get the wrinkles out that are set in due to packaging. So it now hangs in my closet until I can figure something out."
3.0,Size too large
3.0,Nice quality but tight around toes.
3.0,"Although I immediately fell in love with the anklet - It was super cute & looked great on, but it tarnished within a week. It’s almost like black & rusty now. I didn’t expect too much when I bought it for the price, I just wish that it lasted longer, Because there is no cleaning gold filled items. I would give the item 5 stars if it did not tarnish as quickly as it did bc I really love the anklet"
3.0,Not bad at all. Especially if narco trafficking is you preferred career path
3.0,Made decently. Too small for most of my fingers
3.0,Glasses are good. Earplugs terrible
3.0,"Comfortable, and helped with Plantar Fasciitis. However, broke after 5-6 months of continuous use."
3.0,"The piece is very attractive.  However, as the price indicates, it is cheap.  The chain was not well glued into the clasp so it fell off after the first time I wore it.  I do have a hot glue gun so I was able to repair it.  I fully expect the other side to fall out soon.  That being said, the metal is a heavy durable metal for both the earrings and the chain.  If the necklace didn't fall apart on first use, I would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,"Love the design and color!  The sleeves aren't snug like pictured on the model.  I have a few of these styles in different colors from a brand name store and this one doesn't fit like the ones I've bought.  I did get a compliment on this, but wished it fit better.  I usually wear a medium, but sized up 2x on this - ordered an XL, maybe the L would have sufficed."
3.0,This is more of a pale green. Not emerald colored.
3.0,Unfortunately it lost a stone today... It's only the second time I wore it.
3.0,"Size runs smaller than expected.  One button fell off after a few uses.  Havent put in washer yet, not sure how it will hold up."
3.0,The crescent could be smaller thickness wise and overall jmho
3.0,"I sorted out for Carhartt only.  This came up on the list and I mistakenly purchased it.  It is not too bad, but it is not a Carhartt.  I blame the Amazon for that.  I have it now and will keep it and use it in the barn.  I will go to the Carhartt web site and see if I can find a Carhartt."
3.0,The sandles fit fine but don't feel as secure walking as expected. They don't provide good sturdiness but they are really cute.
3.0,"Good product, just doesnt fit properly."
3.0,"I bought the black pair. They came in nice packaging and with some nice perks with the case, cleaning cloth and slip case. The glasses are indeed polarized which was what I wanted but the black lenses are not a black out lenses. My eyes are still visible and I did not like that aspect. Also, the frames are very lightweight and flimsy. Made of cheap plastic and not metal as I was hoping for. They're also a bit bigger than my other pair of standard aviators - which I actually didn't mind.  Overall though I'm in the process of returning them because they did not come exactly as I expected. If I wasn't so set on a specific style, I'm sure the glasses would be find to other people."
3.0,not good value for money!
3.0,"Fits on the smaller size. I usually can wear a medium in tops, I got a large wanting it to fit looser but its definitely not loose, the large fits like a medium on me. Also wrinkles pretty easily."
3.0,"It fits. But it looks somehow different from the advertisement picture...  just a normal dress. Not as exciting as I thought it would be. Oh well, I guess it’s ok for the price."
3.0,"Fine for the price. Had to add a hole to make it larger to fit my mid-rise jeans, but would have fit the narrow part of my waist. Not crazy about the finish or colors, but my tops cover them anyway. At least they keep my jeans from riding down!"
3.0,Necklace broke within 2 days
3.0,"I really wanted these shoes to work out because they are very cute.  I normally wear an 8M shoe and ordered an 8.  The size fit but they were way too wide.  My heel would slip in the back when I walked.  This is a slip-on type shoe that needs to be a little snug in order to stay comfortably on your feet.  The fabric is very cute and there is a good amount of cushioning.  Unfortunately, I will be returning them."
3.0,Comfortable but definitely go to the next larger size you normally buy
3.0,I really like the mask but I had to return do to the small size .
3.0,"I really liked it, but needed tools to put it back together after it broke after only a few hours of wear."
3.0,"I bought the circus monkeys, It's really cute in the picture when you clearly see the charm, but in real life it is barely the size of a dime, so writing is so dang small it's pretty disappointing. The quality is nice enough, for sure. ...just too much writing for such a tiny object"
3.0,Material is silky and not comfy.
3.0,Is way to short.
3.0,Kind of heavy for a low cut
3.0,It was nice and soft but the fuzzy ball broke off from the string amd could not be put back om whatsoever
3.0,"The dress itself was okay. It fit as nicely (I ordered a small and am 5'2&#34;, 130 lbs), and it was comfortable. However, the material seemed cheap and resembled costume velvet. I ended up returning it because it just wasn't what I wanted."
3.0,Doesn’t stay on. Pops off the side of watch..
3.0,"With a rating this high, I thought this tank would be heaven, but it wasn’t. I ordered my regular size medium. I’m 5’5” 148 lbs and a 36DD and this was way too tight! It cut in under my arms making it uncomfortable and the length hit just at my waist, making it a little too short as well."
3.0,"It’s super cute and arrived quickly. I ordered the kid size first as it’s for my teenager, but was way too small. Now got the adult one and it’s even a bit big for me. I’m just gonna do some adjustments cause it’s really only for her halloween costume."
3.0,Size 0 fits me well. I am 4'11&#34; weighs 88 lbs.  I ordered a black one and it's not see through.  I like this dress except for the bow on the top doesn't look close to the pictured model and that it is barely sewn on the dress.  I had to manually sew the bow to the dress so it won't look like barely hanging and about to fall off.  The design of the bow is not stylish.
3.0,"If this shirt were flannel as advertised, I'd give it 5 stars. It's a good-looking, mid-weight cotton shirt. It is not flannel, though, which is what I ordered."
3.0,Only certain colors are squat proof. I also only washed a wore once and then got a hole
3.0,"This product is cute, but small even for my 4 month old.  The waist is very tiny and I didn't want her to be uncomfortable, so I returned it.  NOTE - I do not have a chunky baby.  She's 65% in weight for her age."
3.0,Runs very small. I ordered up and have a hard time fitting my hips through the neck opening. It’s a cute piece but poorly constructed for practical purposes. I Normally wear a 6/8
3.0,"Extremely low quality. The biggest issue is that the metal is too bendy- the first time I opened the clip the spring bent, making it unable to stay on. This problem was easily solved as I was able to squeeze the entire clip and the whole thing bent way to easily to allow the clip to stay put. I foresee that this constant bending and unbending will cause it to break in a few months. Does not look nearly as good as the photos portrayed it and the gold paint does not seem like it will last. If it were $20 I'd return it but for $10 I've learned a lesson and will use it until it falls apart, I wanted a 1&#34; gold clip and no one will notice how cheesy it is."
3.0,This slipped out of my hand and broke into several pieces upon impact with the floor. It clearly cannot withstand any amount of force.
3.0,"I love how it looks on me! Very cute and comfy; however, the material is itchy. I’m returning."
3.0,It fits snugly
3.0,"Nice on picture,but when it is tried,it is not proportionate to the length.It is large but short on the length ."
3.0,Order this once and it was amazing. Wear for work. Uniformish at a spa. Ordered a second one and it was a completely different fit and stiffer material. Bummer. Would love to order another one like the first one. But don't know what you're going to get
3.0,Arrived with dead battery but everything else was perfect and as advertised. Batteries can be replaced-hopefully.
3.0,love them so far.. lets see how long they will least
3.0,Needed the flowers to be White - they actually have a pinkish hue to them
3.0,Very warm and well made. It was cut a bit short in the arms and the fabric is a bit rough. I expect it will change after many washings. Good for very cold nights.
3.0,"You can pretty much guarantee that if the model's head is cut off in the pictures, the actual product is not shown but rather its inspiration. So this top came very similar in color and knit pattern, but is wider and more boxy than the tailored look on the picture. The material is not sheer so that's a plus, but not as flattering and feminine as shown."
3.0,"When I tried this sweater on, both my boyfriend and my friend said it looked like a grandma sweater. I think its a good, cozy sweater, but it is just not very attractive. It fits me right, but it is a little long to be considered cropped. Super soft though!"
3.0,"Ended up returning as thentio part was too large and looked baggy. Small/average frame and the dress was too baggy in the top part. Pretty color and a nice fabric, but style not for me!"
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress! I ordered the navy blue with sunflowers, my favorite flower. I will say the sizing runs smaller. I am 5'6 about 180lbs and usually a XL/ USA size 16. I ordered size a 2X and I am glad I did it fits perfectly. I will note that the straps are very long, which would be fine if I was a person who likes to show cleavage but I am not so I will be altering the straps to make them shorter for a more modest look. The bust is very stretchy with a ruching style that makes it very accommodating for a larger bust. Also the dress has pockets! I love this dress and I look forward to wearing it this summer."
3.0,One of the diamonds isn't sparkly at all. Its really dark; its pretty obvious.
3.0,"The product was what I expected for the price, but seems to be pretty cheaply made. It was part of a birthday present but not sure how long it will last. It does come with all of the colored birthstones."
3.0,"The first watched I received was not working, even after taking to a jewelry store to have the battery replaced. The return process was easy and efficient and I was able to get another watch. The second watch works great. My biggest complaint is that the instructions for removing a link are very poor and it is HARD. So I've had to pay for a jewelry shop to remove the link."
3.0,"I'm 5'9"", a size 16/18. The shorts fit well, but are frumpy in the front, like you would be able to wear them either way and your butt would still fit. The top just barely  fits, but was short and was too tight to be comfortable and sleep in. The straps are long, adjustable. The fabric is kinda cheap, but  for the price I wasn't expecting much. Lace looks fine. I just tried it on and immediately put it back in for return."
3.0,It’s nice but honestly it’s way too long. Perhaps it is meant to b but I didn’t read it in the description
3.0,ok my grand daughter is saving them for halloween
3.0,But they do pop of your shoes
3.0,I disliked that it was wrinkled and looked used and thin.
3.0,Pretty but not for me!
3.0,"I seem to be the outlier, but I am very disappointed and I think this is FAR too big to actually use as a staff topper.  It's at least 2-3x bigger than I expected.  Generally I blame myself when something isn't the size I expect because most things have dimensions listed so if I didn't check then that's my fault... but this is being specifically marketed as a staff topper so I don't think it's wild that I just assumed it would therefore be a reasonable size to serve that purpose."
3.0,Glasses fit all crooked. Came with scratches on lenses. But for less than $9 you get what you pay for
3.0,My husband wanted one of these instead of a facemask. It serves the purpose of a covering over his face but it is really thin. Don't think it's really protecting him from anything coming in but may be protecting him from things going out? I guess.
3.0,The material is not high quality bit it should last 1 or 2 seasons if not dried on the dryer
3.0,"They were just ok, seems to run small. Material not breathable."
3.0,"Dress is VERY short, I am 5'8&#34; and runs at least a size or two small, however, it is beautiful, and makes a beautiful tunic top. The straps cover a bra perfectly and is not see through at all"
3.0,"It fit!!! I think this is the highlight. I'm 5'8"" and 250lbs, unfortunately finding items that fit this body is not easy. Nevertheless, I was able to find it. The only downside is the material, since it starts to curled up and this makes the sweater look overused."
3.0,It’s pretty but the leather outside will come apart in heat because it’s just hot glued together so be careful with the sun.
3.0,"These are good boots, but they’re to large and too<br />Wide. I had to return them."
3.0,Very classy was disappointed about how small it was were I received it!
3.0,"Looked good on the model, but not on me!!"
3.0,Good quality fabric and buttons but size chart has nothing to do with actual skirt. Ordered my “size” but it was 2 inches from buttoning.  Also really short.
3.0,My 3rd grade girl decided they look babyish and rarely wears them now.  kinda stiff. Not the most comfy.
3.0,"Slighty bent, but not too bad. Haven't tried wearing them yet, but they're somewhat heavier than I expected. We'll see how they go.."
3.0,"This is ok, I will use it for the birthday girl bc I'm out of time to return it... But it looks used? It's weird, it's smashed real flat and looks like the white parts is dirty/dingy as if it's been washed."
3.0,"Sleeves are short but overall, good product."
3.0,tight around shoulders
3.0,Great shirt kinda small for an XL
3.0,Good for layering
3.0,I got 2 pairs of these shorts.  They fit fine.  However they’re forever wrinkled!  I washed on cool & dried on a towel flat.  The cuff on the shorts never look perfect like this.  I Prefer Bayleaf.
3.0,Love the lenses and fit over glasses is great.  Only bad things are the sides.  Limits peripheral vision which is necessary for driving
3.0,I very much like the look and feel but after wearing it non-stop since the bracelet arrived (January 17) it has started to fall apart on one end. I work at a computer all day and feel that just rubbing on the desk has caused it to wear out. I was glad to have it for the three months but need to find something else now.
3.0,"BE CAREFUL.  THESE ARE FOREIGN SHOES.  THEY ARE NOT MADE OF GOOD QUALITY MATERIAL, BUT COMFORTABLE AND CUTE.  MY ZIPPER SPLIT AS SOON AS I UNZIPPED THEM.  IT CAME BAVK TOGETHER, BUT YOU CAN TELL IT'S CHEAPLY MADE."
3.0,"Somewhat thin, color is darker on one side than the other. Other than that seems to be fine. Takes a few washing's to soften up."
3.0,"I love the low profile of these over the toes.  I was able to wear them with my low cut flats without them showing. I also love how far these cover the bottom of the foot. It really felt good in my shoes much like a trouser sock or tights while looking barefoot. BUT, the back strap was very uncomfortable.  It dug into my skin and I had to adjust it several times throughout the day to find a &#34;new&#34; position. I wish they were flat and clear like another brand of toe cover I've tried.  Fix that back strap and I'd have MANY of these."
3.0,"I love these they are so cute, just wish they held up better. The inserts come off quickly."
3.0,"This is a nice pendant. It comes with a black rope cord necklace that is adjustable which is also very nice...but it is bigger than I expected. The only other disappointing thing is it is completely flat on one side so it doesn't lay against you well and when it flips it looks funny.<br /><br />The front is very nicely detailed and a nice sort of brushed metal pewter/silver. It is a nice piece to hang on the wall, but maybe not around your neck.<br /><br />It came in a very nice dark blue velvet bag as well."
3.0,Material is very thin and it would have been better if it had someway to adjust the neck size. Found it was less expensive to just go to Goodwill and make my own from a men shirt.
3.0,"It's OK,  had to assemble it. I ordered one with chicken on door. I received a star on the door mounted upside down!  Not sure how to rate it?"
3.0,"I thought I would love this dress, but the cut of the neckline was just odd.  I know that the cap sleeves are meant to sit on the shoulders, not up like a tank top, and it all did lay flat as it should, but instead of a proper sweetheart neckline with a little bit of a plunge in the center, it was rather highcut.  There's about a 2&#34; wide strip along the top of the fabric that wraps over the bodice and it was just odd.  Without that extra two inches, I might have liked the dress a lot more.  It still wouldn't have been revealing at all without the 2&#34;, but might have allowed just a hint of cleavage for someone quite busty.  This made me feel like I was going to church with my grandmother.  It just felt like a dress with an identity crisis.  I instead opted for a very similar dress with a boat neck.  Again... I'm not out to show off the girls, necessarily - I'm a mom of two - but this dress was just a little odd, in my opinion."
3.0,"This belt is good, but very short!"
3.0,I was expected a different type of material. It’s a cotton material and fits loose which is the look I was going for. Red isn’t my favorite but I’m sure the other colors would be super nice. The style is what I was looking for and it’s very soft and comfy. Will be a great addition for summer. Pockets are spacious as well!
3.0,my granddaughter loved it for school play but it was way too small for her
3.0,"I was expecting the slipper fit I had with my first pair of Hush Puppy slippers.  Didn't get the fit, the new slipper is narrower and longer than the previous ones.  If they stretch out a little, definately will be more comfy but could have ordered a size smaller."
3.0,It’s a cute jacket but I don’t know how good it is at repelling water.  The fabric is thin. There is a funny tie in the back.  The placement is weird
3.0,Thick fabric and good quality. just shorter than I expected.
3.0,Shrank to tiny size when washed.  Smell like fuel oil.
3.0,feels a bit snug around the neck.
3.0,"I like the way it looks, and the way it keeps time. I don't like that I am unable to adjust the size of the band, and it just hangs on my wrist."
3.0,"It is a nice belt buckle, but I was expecting much darker color (almost black), similar to the one in the product picture. Buckle does look like its description, i.e. &#34;Antique Copper Finish&#34;, just not what I expected and not what I was looking for."
3.0,It’s got a little bling but smaller than the picture and it looks different than the picture.
3.0,Fabric soft. I didn’t think the quality was good as compared to price. The fit was tight. I even ordered a size larger than I usually wear.
3.0,"Love the socks but realized I overpaid. I paid $24, but the packaging has an MSRP of $20. Not happy about being overcharged. Would shop around and not order these from Amazon again."
3.0,"This was made pretty basic.. doesn't really look like what the model has on but maybe it's because mine was too big. i would say if you get this, then order a size or two down."
3.0,"This was going to be a gift but it came crushed, was unable to use it as a gift!"
3.0,"STOP👏🏻MAKING👏🏻EVERYTHING👏🏻WITH👏🏻POCKETS!! I get it, but like come on. This dress would be SO much cuter without them. I know some people enjoy them but they make it so unflattering. Other than that - I do like the dress."
3.0,"It cracked the first time I bumped it on something and now there is condensation inside. It still works but its very difficult to see the numbers now.<br /><br /> It is quite large, i should hv checked the dimensions ....1.5 inch diameter.<br /><br />Its really really cute in a steampunk kind if way."
3.0,"I was really excited to get this & wanted to love it but will be returning. The pink color is a very, very light pink. As others stated, this does run big; I would size down one. The quality isn’t super & I felt it just looked frumpy."
3.0,Nice camo but not to thick but still warm
3.0,"I ordered a 6.5 but the sticker on the bottom of the shoe says 5.5. The box says 6.5. I'd send them back and order a half size up, but I'm not sure how I'd order it..needless to say, I'm not sending them back for only $16 and the rare occasion I'll wear them. My left heel hangs over a tad, but the right fits fine."
3.0,Did not look as good as the one shown in picture. It was okay
3.0,"First of all, this sweater is 100% composed of man-made materials. It's made in China and shipped to the US. If this were a quality American product made with wool or cotton, then I would think $31 is a fair price. But for some average made Chinese sweater, the zipper is on the wrong side, it's for a female not a male. Second of all, it's not warm since it is made of polyester. It does not feel that it will last up many washings. That being said, it is a decent sweater and at least tailored right, although it is missing sewn in pockets, they will flap in the wind. I feel this sweater should have been $15, not $32. I feel like I was misled as to the quality and craftsmanship of this product to pay a higher price."
3.0,I guess I expected the material to be a heavier weight than it is. These will probably be good for springtime but definitely not something I’ll be wearing when it’s very cold.
3.0,was a nice gift.  a little big. bought for a gift.
3.0,"I which the quality of the leather and construction of the shoes were better given the price. However, they appear to be as expected jus not worth the money."
3.0,"Toooooo simple! Maybe with more detail or flower can help to look amazing, the fit is perfect, to long for me."
3.0,"I bought as a Christmas gift and did not look at them thoroughly, my fault.  The earrings are for a very small child, 2 and under.  I bought for an older girl. I will be returning them."
3.0,The handbag is more deep than wide. Inside side pockets are not quite large enough to hold your cellular phone.
3.0,Really small. It's more of a kids bag. Mabe use as a wallet. Though it would be bigger.
3.0,"It’s gorgeous BUT the way it was shipped was a bit disappointing. It came in a bubble wrapped envelope so everything was squished, there were strands of hot glue everywhere and 1 of the feathers were not attached. Unless they change their packaging when shipping-expect to manipulate the feathers and flower to get it right. I love it though. It’s gorgeous."
3.0,Size 8 was a fine fit around the palm but fingers were too short and the wrist band part was loose. Feels cheaply crafted with quality material.
3.0,Required slight adjustment (smaller)
3.0,"like the color, and if the fabric was actually 95% cotton 5% spandex would like the fit a lot more. Pretty sure those numbers aren't correct though so instead of being soft and light its heavier than expected and kinda hangs there lifeless."
3.0,Kind of stuff
3.0,Sharp edges. Beware. Cut one of my nips when wearing but they are really pretty. AND they are small so if you have large nips they wont fit.
3.0,I got a small for my mom. It was way too big. The shoulders hung pretty low
3.0,"It wasn't OK. It still does not work, I have to take it for repairs."
3.0,The quality sucks!! The zippers stick and are easily broken. The lining tore within 3 days. Do NOT recommend!!
3.0,It looks a little bit &#34;rough&#34;
3.0,It’s a shirt.
3.0,I like the style and design of this too but the fabric is a bit scratchy and not soft at all.
3.0,Not as high cotton content polyester blend to the point of shiny fabric. Tag reads something like 60/40 - great for multiple washes.
3.0,Cute but way too expensive for what you get. You can get something simular at Wal-Mart for less than half the price.
3.0,Pretty much what you expect for the price. No complaints.
3.0,"The color doesn't match the one in the picture. I chose this beret to match an outfit I have. The color looks like a mustard yellow, called &#34;Saffron yellow,&#34; but it arrives as a bright tangerine orange. It's useless as a match for my outfit. Otherwise, it's okay, nice shape. But please rename it and photograph it correctly."
3.0,I do like the style and the use of space but getting into the various pocket could be made more efficient if the market has slanted the pockets toward the front.
3.0,They are really pretty but not compression at all and too big on me so I returned them.
3.0,"The item runs a touch small, and so I feel like I look sloppy in it. Just can’t seem to make it work. Material is very thin, which is nice for summer."
3.0,Love these. Only complaint if I put them up on my head when I go inside they get all stuck in my hair.
3.0,Meh...material is very thin and unlined. Print is as pictured. Pockets are convenient but ad bulk exactly where women don't need it. The fit is ok but a bit snug. Could use a belt. No tag so you get to guess which way to put it on. Both ways it just looks underwelming.
3.0,"Wish it had just a little more support, but I wear this around the house, because it kinda gives you the torpedo look."
3.0,Good except the connection points on the end of the chain.
3.0,"They look and feel nice, but I can't really vouch for their quality since I never got to wear it."
3.0,The flamingo never fully inflated and sagged it’s head no mater how tight we tied the cuffs.
3.0,Didn't even realize this came with ear rings. The ear rings are very cheap. However the knecklace looks really nice. Just hope the chain will hold up.
3.0,Shoe was about 1/2 size too small. Great shoe other than that.
3.0,"I really liked them , but I have a size 10 foot and I stretched them as far as they could go. One pair ripped. They stayed well on my feet, but not sure if that is because I had them stretched so much to accommodate my big foot"
3.0,"It's a cute dress, but it's so see through I can't wear it without a nude bra and underwear. I was hoping it would be thick enough that I wouldn't have to worry about that. Otherwise, cute dress."
3.0,"Very inexpensive & very cute, but lots of blisters maybe next summer they will stretch more and I can get past the blisters"
3.0,I like the fabric and I have the correct size but they are a little too &#34;cheeky&#34;.  Just a little more room in back coming out of the crotch piece on either side would be great for full coverage.
3.0,I'm a bigger girl so these gloves did not fit up my arms.
3.0,"Material is soft, a little on the shorter side than usually like . Haven’t washed yet so hopefully it doesn’t shrink up"
3.0,The bag itself is small for taller individuals with longer garments. It does offer great compartmentalization. Weak exterior handle durability as it ripped from the seam upon first use.
3.0,"its not turquoise, its a true green"
3.0,"I am 68 kg and size S that I bought is big for me, though sleeves are shorter then should be. Not flattering. Since I can't return it I don't know what I will do with it."
3.0,Pretty okay
3.0,Highly recommend to size up!  Material feels great.
3.0,"I liked this at first, but it shrunk in the wash and now my boobs don't fit :("
3.0,"Beautiful top and material. I did expect as a tunic top it would be longer and looser but luckily I can wear it, just more snug."
3.0,"These were sooo cut.  However, it was made flimsy."
3.0,"The material is good, the jersey looks as it should except for one major detail. The patch is upside down. I assume since that is the way it is in the picture, that is what I bought, so that is my mistake.<br /><br />I bought a 2X and it fits me like a regular t-shirt or dress shirt. If you wan't something to fit loose or like an actual jersey, go one size bigger.<br /><br />I really like the look and feel of the jersey but if I had noticed the patch, I wouldn't have bought it. i contacted the seller and the response was that the upside down patch is correct. Check the patch before you buy from here."
3.0,"The color and pattern of this dress were cute. However, the dress itself was much smaller than expected and the material was very thin and cheap."
3.0,"I wear an XL and upon getting this shirt, I see its sized more as a Medium.  Had to return."
3.0,"For me, they stopped working well after a month. Started falling apart after two months."
3.0,this advert was put in womans sizes. I am currently waiting for refund. they were cute though.
3.0,"Some feel tight, some are loose and some are just right. Had they all been consistently one or the other, I would have been forgiving.  That said, material is fine, medium grade, not light but not bulky.  Cotton is breathable and generally comfortable.  I washed all of them before first use and they stood up to the laundry machine well.  I line dry."
3.0,"Cute designs and truly no-show, however after first wash, socks look like they have been worn for many many months. Very bummed."
3.0,"Worked great for about 2 months, but beware: if you catch the band on anything like when you are working and whatnot, it doesn't take much effort to break the sliding silicon ring, rendering the entire watchband useless.  I switched to a metal magnetic one and haven't looked back.  Wouldn't buy again, but only because I'm working on crap in the garage all the time and my likelyhood of breaking another one is high.  If you are light duty, then I don't see a reason not to buy it.  It's pretty comfortable, that little band could be strengthened though, or at least come with a spare one."
3.0,Loved the watch but it stopped working within the first few weeks
3.0,"These are nice quality, but much smaller than the model iOS wearing. They’re tiny. They Lola nice, but the earring clasp keeps opening up and I’ve almost lost one several times."
3.0,"For the most part, it is a good anklet, but I am a very rough sleeper, and it came off a few times during the night, which honestly could be expected. Besides that, there are no problems"
3.0,"So it's warm, it's the right size, but NO ONE could figure out who I was. It doesn't look like Flareon at all. Mostly the tail, the tail is weird. It's also VERY orange and yellow but Flareon is much less bright. Also, you will get orange fuzz all over whatever you are wearing underneath. You must wear clothes underneath because the buttons gape open whenever you walk so anyone will see your underwear if you don't have at least shorts on."
3.0,Really small and poked a hole for no reason the biggest one hold a pair of pants
3.0,"Muy delgada la tela, aunque el diseño está muy bien."
3.0,"Was much larger/wider than expected. The material was heavier than I thought as well. I returned it. I may try a size down to see if it works as I liked the semi-cropped cut in the product picture, but I'm not sure it's worth it given the odd material."
3.0,these boots run way to small. I wear a 8 bought a size 9 and i can’t get them on . I’m having a difficult time sending them back . I maybe stuck with them
3.0,If you buy one buy a larger size than normal because it shrinks.
3.0,"This seems like a durable hat that would last a long time. The reason for three stars is that despite comments that it was a good size, my head felt like it was being held in a vise-like grip every time i wore it. While I don't have an unusually large head, I do have thick shoulder length hair. Granted, this doesn't apply to most, but hopefully it prevents someone else from ending up in the same situation. Because this wasn't a Prime free return, the appealingly low cost of the hat also makes it not worth the cost of returning it."
3.0,Quality was very nice but did not get the right size.
3.0,"It is a decent leather strap. Leather is soft and relatively comfortable. It hasn't stained my arm with black dye. It has a medium shine to it. The end strap is fairly long. I have just over a 7&#34; wrist and I'm on the 4th or 5th hole from the end, so the end part sticks out a little further than I'd like above the second o-ring. I don't like to fold leather nato's so it bugs me a little to be almost flapping around. In any case, it works, it's black, has a medium shine, and was extremely inexpensive. I can't say that I like it because I bought it out of curiosity over what an $11 strap might be like. It's okay - I have worn it a few times. I plan on spending $60-100 on a very high quality black leather nato, which I will &#34;love&#34; so this earns a 3-star rating. On a budget it's great for the money."
3.0,"These are nice looking opaque black leggings lined with a thick layer of seriously soft grey fleece. They are extremely cozy, but also verging on too snug on me, and I’m not at the top of the manufacturer’s suggested size range. I think describing these as plus-sized is a stretch since they are likely a good fit for U.S. sizes medium and large, but definitely not up to XXL as the listing states."
3.0,"For the money It's ok,really small. Should have purchased a bigger one.The blue bage it came in was beautiful !!!!"
3.0,"It was too big. Ordered size small, and it was not true to size. It fit like a medium."
3.0,If you have size 8 please buy size 10 because these shoes are very small. I mean  their size chart is for midgets probably.
3.0,One of our mittens came with the nose patch missing. Other than that these are a great option for babies. Nice and warm
3.0,Hard to see or know what you’re seeing. Disappointing
3.0,Not bad....maybe I needed to order a size smaller for the perfect fit.
3.0,I absolutely love the sweater but it runs Very Very Small.  I ordered a XL because I wear a 14/16 but when I tried it on it fit like a Medium.
3.0,SUPER long. I wish there were more petite options and these are kind of shiny. But they're very opaque.
3.0,"way too large,and bad quality, broken after wearing for 1 month"
3.0,"I bought the 0-3 size for my daughter who is 2 months and 10 pounds. The dress was great in length; however, it runs wide. There was a lot of material on each side to try to tuck back and secure with the ribbon. My daughter only wore this dress an hour before the beaded work started coming loose and one of the bottom layers was losing its hem. Too bad it didn't hold up better, it's such a beautiful dress!"
3.0,"Color was nice, but the Knot detail was weird--too bulky and awkwardly stitched.  I wanted to love it, but it was more like a flappy kangaroo pouch than a nice twist detail."
3.0,I like the sunglasses but need to use both hands to take on and off.  Not flexible enough and I've broken 2 pair.  Use both hands!
3.0,The material wasn't as soft as I had hoped it would be. They are comfortable.
3.0,I get lots of compliments on this necklace and while its beautiful it is very delicate probably more for a child but still a nice piece
3.0,"Like it, quality of the zipper is questionable,<br />Only using for a few days,<br />Will have a better opinion down the road ,"
3.0,These run really big. Comfortable but have to keep pulling them up.
3.0,"Very cute glasses, but the tint is too dark."
3.0,Bought two sizes bigger than I am and it was still to small
3.0,"They are polarized. They are aviators. They work. I don't hate them, but I don't love them. They block out a bit less light than I expected, but still get the job done. My only issue with them is that the plastic feels very cheap. Everything about these shades feels cheap.<br /><br />But for $20, I'm not really complaining."
3.0,I got blue when I ordered the multiple colors one but I still love them either way. Atleast they were the right size
3.0,"If you’re short, it goes to your knees cute in the picture if you’re 5 foot 10"
3.0,"I am 5'8"" 152 lbs and usually tops I am a medium. I bought a large because other reviewers said it runs small. Even the large was very tight around my belly.  The product is still good quality and comfortable. Just meant for slimmer people."
3.0,"The description said the colors were Bronzen, Copper, Gold and Silver but they are only one color: antique gold. But the gears themselves are nice."
3.0,I am giving it a lower rating because my label started to fall off after one use
3.0,"I liked the look, the fit, the pattern, and the price, but the material was good up to eight washes. Then they started to pick up lint. The material wasn't as soft. I've tried liquid fabric softener and both liquid and dried sheets. The pants still pick-up lint. I washed them in my friends new washer and dryer and still no improvement. The crotch area started to lose its shape. Started to see to much crotch."
3.0,"Pretty, but the color  it's different to what I imagined"
3.0,"I ordered 9/16 or 14mm. However, I received all of the pairs in size 5/8. I guaged up to fit them. The thin pairs are quite flimsy but overall they are pretty good for the price."
3.0,Beard was not curly. Just wavy.  Not very white.
3.0,Too small. I wish these cam in bigger sizes. 2x 3x etc.  Us bigger gals like foo-foo and comfort too.  I' m keeping these so IF I loose some weight I can enjoy them.  I must add that the quality looks great and is very comfortable to the touch.
3.0,Quality was good. Color was more bold than I thought it would be.
3.0,"They are cute! But if you have a small face, they maybe too big"
3.0,"These aren’t bad looking plugs, but they’re definitely not made of stone.<br />Material feels like acrylic."
3.0,They are not too large and lightweight but you have to slide them under a bra or sportsbra.
3.0,runs small in size. order at least 2 sizes larger than what you need.
3.0,This band is nice for the price. Examined closely you can tell this is foreign made and not high-prIced jewelry.  But for everyday use it is very good. Installation was pretty easy and it fits nicely to the watch.
3.0,This dress is nice. Material comfortable but its very thin.
3.0,The dress is pretty but I'm petite and it was just too much dress for me.  The green in the picture is much brighter than the one I received.
3.0,"After a trip to Disney, noticed they started coming undone around the ears."
3.0,"I'm 6' 184lbs with a 34"" waist.  These fit snug when I ordered according to their size chart.  I'd go with the large unless you like a tight fit."
3.0,"The extenders are fine, however they do not line up to my bra.  The extender is wider than my bra, so basically does not fit. So when you put it on it bunches up and really does not work.  Sorry..."
3.0,"The KYY Women’s high waisted underwear are decent, but not as high in quality as I expected.  I have other underwear that are the same style, and these are not up to comparison.<br /><br />I’ve worn and washed 3 pairs at three times.<br /><br />What I like about these underwear:<br />• They fit as expected.<br />• They are soft.<br />• They don’t seem to ride up. (until they have been washed a few times then they do)<br />• The colors are pretty, just like in their photos.  I got the 4 pk with 4 colors.<br /><br />What I don’t like:<br />• The wide waistband is only on the front, the back has just a thin elastic. This is visible in their photos if you look closely, but who looks that closely. (see photo)<br />• After 2 washings the elastic is already starting to ripple, it’s just too flimsy.(see photo)<br />• The material is too thin, that may be a plus for some, but I like a heavier cotton. (this is also somewhat visible in their photos, I should have noticed how much I could see the model’s skin through the fabric)<br />• The front would sometimes ride down; they didn’t always stay where they should.<br />• After wearing and washing one pair 3 times it is starting to ride up.<br />After washing they seem to be stretching out.  These fit me perfectly when I first got them, so I'm not stretching them out.  You can see the difference in the photo.<br /><br />I’m pretty picky about my underwear. I expect them to have a material that is thick enough they won’t wear out and lose their shape for a long time.  I expect them to stay where they should, and with the thick waistband I expect them to help with my “muffin top”.  These don’t fulfill all of those requirements.<br /><br />I’m giving these 3 stars because they aren’t sturdy enough to last."
3.0,They shrink. Be careful.
3.0,A bit too short for me.  Cheap material
3.0,Smaller than expected for sure - need to get one size big
3.0,They are slippery
3.0,"Normally I wear a Large went with one reviewers recommendation and did a XL and was still too small, so I went for the 2XL arms are still short and shirt is still small.<br />My personal recommendation is to go with a better company like Voodoo or Condor where the sizes are accurate."
3.0,"I bought this product for my daughter a little while ago. It was really nice, and came in perfectly as it is pictured. After a couple of weeks of wearing it though, it started to turn pink around the edges of the charms. While this is a great price and product, I only gave it three stars because of that."
3.0,Wow it's so tiny!!!  I am having to wear it as a knuckle ring
3.0,1.  Not as large as I expected.  2.  More brown than purple - and purple was my goal
3.0,"A little on the small side, but will work out. Thanks"
3.0,"I am 5’5 and 220 lbs and I ordered the XL, and it’s too big. The color and style is as pictured, but fits too big"
3.0,Not sure they're actually fleece lined. Kinda thin (we got the white) but cute!
3.0,"I am giving 3 stars due to fact it does HURT between Your toes , after wearing for a while. That and Beause they are Costly. I got these, and I made a Point of parking far from stores so I could walk a Little further to test them out.  I did ""FEEL"" it in the back of my legs, especially back of thighs!  I was Impressed.  But then I wore them On about an Hour long stroll around the park, and the Shoe on My Left foot starting rubbing a Blister between my toes!  Im Hoping My Toes get Used it to It.. Cuz these are really comfortable otherwise, and I feel they work.  Maybe becuase the material is that SHINY white......???  I May try Wearing a Band aid to Pad it some...  Also Im not real sure WORTH $50.00.  Should be More like $30.00!"
3.0,Like the coat but the zipper broke first time I put it on. Fix the zipper issue and it would be a great coat
3.0,Very nice auit for the price but you can almost see through the material when held up to light. Still debating returning or not.
3.0,Dress okay for the price but I got it with some beads off. Had to keep as I needed to give it to someone right away.
3.0,"To start out, &#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&#34;<br /><br />I bought these for my wife. She swam competitively from the time she was a kid until her first year of college. She swam with them for around an hour today and here is what she said. --  They were hard to adjust and kind of small. She has an average size head and these were extended almost to their max. --  They did seal well and had zero fogging issues but did leak occassionally while diving in the water or doing flip turns, they would work fine if you were not doing any aggressive movements under the water.  --  She also notice about 20 minutes ago that she has marks were the goggles were connected across the top of her eyelids. Not sure if it is bruising or a rash of some sort. (She does have sensitive skin so it might not affect everyone in this way.)<br /><br />So all in all I would say that these goggles are funcional and a good purchase for the price. If you are not planning on doing flip turns and dives."
3.0,"Its a great sweater, but I highly suggest getting a size or 2 smaller. I usually wear a meduim to large, I bought other sweaters similar that a large fit great, but this one I ordered a large and it is so so huge. Otherwise its great quality. :)"
3.0,I am disappointed that the packing cubes do not hold their shape on their own. You have to fill them and close it to achieve the advertised shape. They appear to be made well.
3.0,"This dress is not cut like the one on the blond model that you see when you click on a color.  The arm hole cut-outs are not cut into the dress as far (close to the neck) and the holes are not nearly as big. The strap area is wider apart and the arm holes are very small. My daughter is tiny and usually wears an extra small. I got her a small in this dress, and she still found the arm holes uncomfortably small. The rest of the dress fit well."
3.0,It was very pretty but the front split was too high on me probably because I'm 5'2 and the lining was showing around my chest probably because I'm a 38DD. Wish it would have fit because it is pretty.
3.0,"Shoes are ok, light weight, nice color, we just got them, not sure how long they would last.  My 3-star is for the packaging. We were not expecting heavy packaging, but they only came with plastic bags, no tissue or cardboard inside/out to at least to keep the shoes in shape, they came pretty flat-squashed."
3.0,Ordered wrong size. Needed kids 12-14 not adult
3.0,"Too small and cheap, lasted 1 month."
3.0,Material of these women's underwear is not comfortable or moisture wicking becomes very tacky  with sweat
3.0,Just ok. The quality is good but it looks cheap. I doubt I’ll ever wear it
3.0,Uhhhh you are definitely gunna need a waist trainers just saying
3.0,"I love how these look, the polarization is excellent. The material is grippy, I used these for snowboarding.<br /><br />What I can’t get over is how weak the arms are. I’ve snapped the arms on 2 pairs neither from any crazy activities. If the just put some metal in the arms!<br /><br />I say save your money buy something of higher quality. Coming from somebody who purchased these twice..."
3.0,"This bag is nice- not great- but does the job I wanted it for- which was a purse/diaper bag combo. It's heavy when packed, so I leave it behind when I need to run in a store without kids. I wish it were a bit bigger. The shoulder strap was poorly made and cheap and broke not a minute after I had it packed and tried it on my shoulder. I had another shoulder strap from another bag that I used in it's place. It's overall a good bag, but I will continue to look for a better fit for what I need."
3.0,"I bought the “yellow”, size Large,  with the buttons down the front. The color is like a mustard yellow, so not quite what I wanted. Loved the material. It fit perfectly except for over the chest. I am 38D, size 10/12 clothes usually. If it weren’t for the chest area, I would have kept the dress."
3.0,I liked the color and the fit was good but I did not like the material.  It's very thin and it felt like I was wearing pajamas.  I was hoping for something more dressy.
3.0,Cute for little girls.
3.0,"I was very pleased with the fact that there were two of these loupes for the price.  They each have their own small case, so I could put them in separate Christmas stockings.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are solid little loupes, heavy for their size, and have a strong magnification.<br /><br />The big downside is that they are tinier than I expected.  The lens is about the size of a dime, and do not seem like 21mm.  It makes viewing some objects very difficult."
3.0,Super cute in the model picture. I expected a more silky material... it's more light fleece like.  I am 5'3 and 124lbs and the small was on the larger side.
3.0,"Recieved it today, I had my daughter wear it and it's too big. I should have gotten her size (6yr) but I got a size bigger, so I'm sending it back. Overall the design of the jacket is cute. The material of the jacket is a cheap leather like material."
3.0,Do not like the back of crystal is coated I will return
3.0,"This product looks like the picture BUT it's not soft at all or stretchy. Idk what it's made of but it feels like it'll be itchy, rough and uncomfortable for a baby (or anyone) to wear. It's really tiny so you can't stretch it over your baby's head. I'm gonna keep it for when my daughter starts playing with dolls. She can use it on a doll! Lol It's so disappointing because it really is a cute hat."
3.0,"First, the product picture shows the ENTIRE MASK as purple, this is not the case. The top and bottom ""seam"" are white. I ordered these BECAUSE they were supposed to be entirely purple, different from other colored masks.<br />Second, they are thinner than most disposable masks, sure they are ""3-layer"", but thin layers.<br />Thirdly, they came vacuum packed, so any fold, wrinkle and indentation are permanent. So 12 of the 50 I won't be able to wear.  All of the above are very disappointing after finally finding a face mask seller that Amazon fulfilled so I didn't have to wait 2 months to get them. :("
3.0,Cute but inside liner ripped within a week
3.0,"I normally wear a L, and due to the reviews ordered an XL. The dress is a tad bit large. I'm 170, 5'5"". I would order the size you normally wear contrary to what the reviews say. i'm normally a 10-12. XL is like a 14. I'm going to have to pay to have it altered. Love the material tho. Washed it and unfortunately it didn't shrink :(."
3.0,"Runs small, or I did not understand compression.  :) If you want compression order true to size.  Id you want fitted but room, order a size up."
3.0,Fits great. Has a lot of stretch to it. I'm 5'2 180. There was a &#34;hole&#34; defect on the suit but the entire suit is holes. The hole just wasn't parallel to any other and it stood out on the butt cheek area.
3.0,The top is very small and has a deep scoop neck.  The bottoms are somewhat small but still work.
3.0,"Let me start off buy saying, I probably would have liked these more had I not purchased another brand for the same price on Amazon as well so it was easy to compare. These do block sound, but they aren't a snug fit. My 8 month old could easily get them off his head without much effort. They didn't necessarily FALL off per se but they just weren't a great fit. I am 28 and I also wore hem brevity do be able to give a good well written review. Unfortunately, they also slipped off my head pretty easily so it want just about my son being too small. I purchase these for only $15. IF my son had been sleeping while I had these on at the fireworks show it would have been better but I don't think the idea is to sleep in these. That said, I'm rating these at 3 stars."
3.0,"Good material, but small and tight."
3.0,"Should've gotten medium instead of large. Kept anyway. Lace edging along décolleté is scratchy.  Washing once didn't help so I carefully cut it off 2 of the 3 I bought. Maybe more washing will soften lace on uncut camisole but I doubt it—it's made of stiff synthetic, I think."
3.0,They definitely look a lot cuter on the model then on me. They run large for sure and the cute ruffle on the bottom is not as pictured. Maybe it was the color I got (black) it wasn’t for me and I returned.
3.0,Did turn after four months but not too noticeable
3.0,Fast shipment but kind of small for the boys they are a 2T and I ordered the largest size
3.0,The body fits well but the arms are too small.
3.0,I got all three of the same....was disappointed......
3.0,Nice dress - reason for 3 stars is that ripped in the middle of the back after wearing 4 times.  I am a small person - even ordered a Medium after reading some reviews with the same problem.  It is a shame because it is a nice garment for around the house.
3.0,"Tie looks good but the material leaves a little to be desired, not bad for an inexpensive tie."
3.0,For the price it's ok.
3.0,"I loved the band. It’s cute but I noticed after a couple days of wearing it, the design started to fade from it."
3.0,"I got this as a spare helmet for a passenger. While it's a fine helmet, there's a minimal amount of padding and I eventually replaced this with a full face helmet as it won't actually fully protect someone in the event of a crash."
3.0,Didn’t like that the dress wasn’t hemmed especially for paying that much for it but the fit was nice worked great for my Jessica rabbit costume. Everyone said to size down I didn’t and the only thing was the chest was a little too big but the hips fit great I’m happy I didn’t size down. I’m 3 starzing because I think the unfinished hem is unacceptable. The sequin strings will unravel and fall off
3.0,"Overall- it's fine and more or less what I expected.<br /><br />I normally purchase a size small in American sizes, but in this I wore a large. The sleeve length is odd. It's a little too short to be a full sleeve but too long to be 3/4 sleeve. The fabric is a little thin, but not awful. The colors are cute and it looks like it does in the picture. I would buy it again for the price..."
3.0,Really cute outfit... nice detail! My daughter is 5 and usually wears 3-4T. I ordered 4-5T and the shirt fits as 3/4 length. It supposed to be long sleeve and it’s not. The only reason I’m not returning it is because I love how the skirt fits.
3.0,Bought it for decoration. Expected it to be not just a slice of malachite
3.0,Got a large and they fit like a small. Need to lose weight or needs extra stretch. Unfortunately can't wear at all. Bummer.
3.0,There is a seam that was not sewn so I need to mend it before it can be worn.
3.0,the strings behind the dots get caught on my toes while trying to put them on
3.0,"This is a nice romper and fits nice, material is very cheap threads are coming loose on leg. I have one that I purchased in downtown Manhattan and its a way thicker/bodycon fit. This one is ok"
3.0,Loved the quote so I bought the shirt...but this tank runs very small. If you have any boobs go up at least 2 sizes unless you are into the belly tank ;)
3.0,Nice quality but the hat gave my son a horrible rash on his chin. I think it was may have been the velcro rubbing or could have been from the fabric. He has very sensitive skin. He can only wear the gloves. Both are nicely made and seem warm.
3.0,"Nice design for my 8 year old. I take 2 stars off because pin bent within 10 days. Bought new heavier duty pins on Amazon for about $6 so factor that price, hassle, and disappointment in when you're deciding whether or not to buy."
3.0,"The earrings are very pretty.  However, the post is not in the middle; therefore, the earrings won't stay straight on the ear."
3.0,The glasses are cool and I get compliments.  Only downside is that they are set really wide.  The nose piece is really long.
3.0,"After 75 days, I have figured out how to make this product work.  I bought it because the Samsung original would not stay clasped and this one has a positive clasp.  But loose or tight, this one kept releasing at the watch part so I have held it together with electrical tape the last 75 days until today I discovered that a round toothpick, cut to length, fits perfectly behind the two releases.  Now it works perfectly and if I ever need to change it, I can pry the toothpicks out."
3.0,These fell apart very quickly. Within about 2 months. I  going to try spending twice as much as see if more expensive shoes last 4 months.
3.0,I only wish they were a little longer
3.0,Fits very loose
3.0,"These were much larger than I had imagined. I still like them but I dont know how others would feel, they are really big."
3.0,"These are ok for the price, but they are not really great quality.  Seem to be a bit of a knock off, but you get what you pay for and for the price I am not too bothered.  I can't see them lasting too long though."
3.0,The skirt was ok. Looked so cute on my friend I got one too. I hate the material but it looks nice. Wrinkles super easy.
3.0,The dress itself is a bit stiff even after I washed it in softener. The actual color and flowers on it are cute. A bit low cut but I often wear a cami underneath. Though It fit I felt it made me look heavy.
3.0,It came really really wrinkled-which I knew would be likely due to reviews.  I suspect a steamer will help a lot.  Nice thick weaving for good sun protection.
3.0,Really big!!!! Does the job!
3.0,"too large for me I have a short neck, but very pretty"
3.0,"A testament to shirts coming from Asia. Most are smaller than us size equivalent, a few are just right, and others are 3x bigger than us equivalent. First shirt I order from them was great so felt safe in ordering a second. This time though the shirt is huge."
3.0,They are very cute to look at but not sturdy in my opinion. I tried wearing 3 different ones and each one popped easily. I didn't have them too tight because that would've been uncomfortable for me & I wore them around my waist (which is smaller) not my belly. I would've expected them to pop easily wearing them around my belly but I didn't so they should've held up alot better. I wouldn't purchase these again.
3.0,"This is such a comfortable dress, however, I had to send it back as the sleeves did not fit. If the sleeves were as flowy as the rest of the dress, it would of been perfect. I am 5’9” and ordered the medium which fit true to size on the bottom. A large would of been too big. So, if you are very thin through the shoulders/arms, your size will fit. Very disappointed as the pattern is much prettier than its picture."
3.0,the straps slide off my shoulders and its tighter than other bras of this size I have
3.0,These have a &#34;sticky&#34; feel when wearing them and they are an odd color (does not match my pale skin) but they were fine for the price.
3.0,Love the color and material. For a large it fit like a sports bar so definitely discounted it wasn’t a little longer.
3.0,"The material is nice and the fit is good, but the button fell off the first time my husband put them on."
3.0,Item smaller than size is stated on the page.
3.0,"It fits a little snug around my middle. Maybe I just have to lose weight! I think if I wear a scarf that hangs down the middle, it won't show so much. The color is a bit too bright. I thought it would be a softer blue than it is. I am still thinking whether to send it back."
3.0,"The phone bounced around to much ,not really a alternative to a armband"
3.0,Not super comfy and the fit is sort of awkward.
3.0,"Love the dress but it is ridiculously too long- it's so long, after I hem it I will have enough fabric left to make a top... and a head band."
3.0,There is no real way to attach tail unless you wear a belt. Wish it had something better for attachment
3.0,Very nice dress but sizing is off. Too small
3.0,"The material is lightweight, a little silky like it dries quickly and the light pink color is perfect. So far I've worn it a few times to go running; I wear it as a headband and pull it over my ears to protect them from the wind. I've also used it to pull up around my mouth and nose as a face covering, during Covid-19 living in California it's sometimes necessary to go for a run then walk back through populated areas or stop at a store where face coverings are required and just plane old considerate. The best way to wear it as a face covering is to pull up the seem high on the bridge of the nose, let the material scrunch a little and it will just drape over the mouth and nose (as opposed to just pulled it up- then its too taut and you can SEE the outline of your mouth.<br />I hand wash and hang to dry. It's a good product."
3.0,The top was way too small around the arms... Then the bottoms were way too large. It's like they gave me large bottoms and an xtra small top when I ordered a medium.... Oh well.. Guess I can make it work.
3.0,"Love the color, sleeve length perfect, shoulder area fit fine but chest down was almost two sizes too small"
3.0,"The sleeves are a solid red and the draw strings are white not black. Kakashi is in good detail, sweatshirt quality is extremely thin, good for brisk summer days. You get what you pay for."
3.0,The dress is beautiful but a little short. I wore with tights & booties. I received a ton of compliments but I wasn't very comfortable in it.
3.0,Ordered xl due to measurements on chart. Waist is tighter than expected.  Everything else is great!
3.0,"So friendly warning this is not jersey knit material, it is ribbed knit material so it stretches oddly by midday. I did not realize this till it got here. The colors are not quite right. I ordered light coral and navy blue. My light coral is bright orange and very grey medium blue. Not at all what I was expecting. The fabric is completely see through in the light color. Just not what I was hoping for. Pretty cheap quality, but for the price it isn't bad. The photo is on a black background to show the true colors."
3.0,El producto vino con los aplique de las mangas al revés.
3.0,Hat does not sit low enough on my head.
3.0,"I loved this band when I first got it, but now that i've been using it regularly for about a month it had started turning. It's really upsetting because the band was so comfortable and now it is like a brassy color. Very disappointed."
3.0,I was a little disappointed about how form fitting this too was. Size up if you don’t want it to be skin tight
3.0,This wasnt too hot which I liked but it still allowed UVB rays in.  I have PMLE and even when wearing this my arms broke out in a rash.  I would say this offers SOME protection but not as much as I had hoped.  Fit as expected.
3.0,"The size chart isn't right. It's too big. Also, it's rough as all get out and feels like sandpaper. Nice colors though."
3.0,I loved these earrings but One of the threads came loose the first time I wore them and the top tier just stuck straight out making it look silly. I also had a hard time keeping them in my ears during the wedding I was attending because the backs kept falling off.
3.0,"The top was pretty much as expected in terms of design, quality, style, length. It's definitely a tunic. I'm returning because it's too large. Based on past experience and other reviews, I sized up to a Large and it was way too big. The shoulders were wide, the sleeves were too long and just baggy all around. The fabric is on the thin side but overall I thought it was a cute top. Reference points: I'm 5'4, 34B, pear shape"
3.0,Looks great. But got condensation on the inside and the watch hands broke off
3.0,"I received the wrong style hats, So that kinda sucked and instead of the brown  bandanas coming with my brown hats, I got a assortment of colors.. It was too close in time to return them, so we went with it.. We took them to a rodeo. The fit was good for us all.. My boyfriend and two 10 year old kids.. Definitely not what some of the ""real cow boys"" were wearing but, they seemed like they were made well."
3.0,"Way to tight, not happy"
3.0,"First of all, absolutely check the size chart! Most of the time in dresses, my daughter wears a Large, sometimes even a Medium, but for this dress she had to get an XXL. The sleeves are extremely tight, so maybe size up one from what you think you need. Overall, it's a beautiful dress. Not quite the texture of fabric I expected, and it could be made better, but this isn't a complaint. Just some things to consider before placing your order. :)"
3.0,"I just ordered this swimsuit for my daughter. While it's very cute, it wasn't what was pictured. What I received was a seahorse shirt (as pictured) and solid bottoms. The bottoms match the shirt, but they're not nearly as cute as what is pictured here."
3.0,the lowest stud on the front broke off when trying this on the first time. still wearable but disappointing. this would be a 4* review if it wasn't for that.
3.0,"Most of the waters stays out but there is no true lining in the jacket to speak of, so I have to peel myself out of it."
3.0,"medium fits a 34b well. like anything without straps,it does need boosting up here and there but it is as advertised."
3.0,Buttons fell off in the first wash but very cute and fits perfectly.
3.0,Fits well but EXTREMELY THIN... so not sure if it’s worth the price. I expected it to be much thicker.  It’s basically a windbreaker with a tiny amount of lining. Ordered an XL
3.0,A little tight in some places. Thought it would be longer in length.
3.0,I purchased my sizing based on the sizing chart and taking my measurements with a tape measurer.  Completely inaccurate sizing.  Difficult return process.
3.0,This was very small for my husband. He runs a solid XL and this XL wouldn’t Zip.<br />Great product otherwise
3.0,So far so good. I normally wear large shirts and got an XL but it was still small. I understand its a compression but it is smaller than it should be.
3.0,"The white wasn't white, it's more of a cream color.  It fit different from the first one I purchased"
3.0,Started falling apart after 3 washes.
3.0,"I ordered the small size of this as a gift but the logo had been printed on asymmetrically, possibly because of the size but I can't say for sure. I ended up returning it because for this price I really can't overlook a misprint, but the quality and size were good."
3.0,"So I really wanted to love this bag, and I did love the color (brown), the structure, the pockets, the hardware.  But I found it way too heavy.  I was afraid that when I packed everything in, I would feel way too much weight on my back.  Like I said, wanted this to be THE bag, but it just wasn't for me."
3.0,"I dislike the shape, Jiraiya's fits to the head better but I know there aren't really any better ones out there.  But the horns...the horns are stuffed! They aren't metal, I really dislike that."
3.0,"For a matte finish it was still rather shiny. I ordered several to compare and this was my least favorite. Overall quality seems fine, though."
3.0,"My favorite sweatshirt is a many, many years old Russell Dri Fit.  It's ragged and stained but is the most comfortable one in my sweatshirt arsenal.  Really good weight and just oversized enough to look as comfortable as it feels.  So when I decided to add to my drawer I immediately looked and found the faithful Russell Dri Fit.<br /><br />I hate to say its not what my old one is.  Its comfortable enough... its over sized enough... the weight is almost as comfortably as heavy as my original; but not quite.  Its just good enough.<br /><br />I'll wear it in rotation buy it will never take on the battle scars of my original.  I have a feeling it won't last near as long."
3.0,These look nice but really don't keep the charms in place. They slide around so are not very functional in my opinion.
3.0,"The seams weren't lined up and you can see the glue leaking from the seams. Other than that, the details are nice and they feel sturdy. They are a little heavy that I'm sure after long wear it's going to be a little uncomfortable from hanging."
3.0,"1. It's wide for an 18mm band. I had to stuff it into the watch opening.<br />2. It looks like it's plastic to the naked eye. Somewhat cheap looking.<br />3. Very stiff, not much flexibility."
3.0,"I ordered a Reversible Black/Brown.  Received a belt with no black on either side. I received a belt that was brown on one side and a bright brownish color on the other side.  Regretfully, I'm sending it back. I need the black and brown. Too bad because I really liked the quality of the belt I received."
3.0,Pretty but could hold up to the New York rain storm. We bought 2 and used them for the first time in New York and they both got damaged in a rain storm with just a small about it wind.
3.0,"No what I was expecting. I know that it is a good price, but seems like plastic"
3.0,"Say they're a size 5 big kid, but r more like a size 2 little kid. But seller made it right."
3.0,Comfy but looked cheap. If your looking for Halloween or a costume it does the job
3.0,They are very obvious when worn. I would have liked them to be a little smaller and less obvious. Other than that they are great.
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01985HFOQ EVER FAITH Women's 925 Sterling Silver CZ Sweep Ear Vine Cuff Wrap Hook Earrings Blue 1 Pair]]<br /><br />I prefer longer ear vines. The stones and length of the ear vine were too small for me. I was concerned the back was too delicate to manipulate to put in my ear as ear vines do need some manipulation to insert and set on the ear.<br /><br />I am tempted to give them a 4 just because they are came in delightfully packaged. The box includes a silver protection bag, a silver cleaning fabric piece and a matching case. Ever Faith truly makes a beautiful customer experience with their package making an item a beautiful gift.<br /><br />I am returning them."
3.0,"straps will not support heavier breasts like a C cup and up, these are cute for A-B cups."
3.0,The top was a little oversized and the pants were not tampered like it views but I still liked the outfit.
3.0,"I like these gloves a lot, but some stitching has begun to unravel and I haven't worn them that often."
3.0,"When I ordered a 2x, I expected the cup size to be much, much larger. Instead is was a C at best. The size of the bra should match the cup size. My cup runneth over."
3.0,"These are nice looking....They feel nice and are a superior quality for the price and they fit well.<br /><br />They are not the best for wearing on a very bright day, the crystal lens catches the sun and blinds me.<br /><br />But they are super stylish and worth the risk....."
3.0,"The fabric is wonderful and really soft. The waist band on the pants was way too small and the neck of the shirt is really wide so it falls off my shoulders. I’m 130lbs, 5’2” and ordered a medium. If the pants were in better proportion to the shirt it would be perfect!"
3.0,The pictures no on this product had what look like a blue stain on it was really not happy as I was very excited to get this case huge let down
3.0,"I like the trim accents and the feel of material, was not expecting it to be made in China was hoping for USA. Also fits very well for me being 5'9 and 130 lbs, and getting a one size fit all."
3.0,"The shoe runs large, about a half a size too big. Sometimes that’s OK, but not in a sandal. My foot was just swimming in it!"
3.0,Good material but the fit was a bit small. A large is really more like a loose medium. Everything else about this shirt is fine.
3.0,I had to take it to a shop and buy a battery for a watch fresh out of the box. I like it now that it is working but that was disappointing.
3.0,This is 100% acrylic. NO COTTON as stated.<br />Looks a bit different than pictured- i Expected it to be more similar to almost a tight crochet type cotton sweater. But it’s just a very light acrylic.
3.0,"I wanted to love these so much! First time wearing was great! They are warm, hold in the tummy and cute! Then after one wash one pair Ripped at the seam and both are covered in lint and fuzz bc they attract EVERYTHING! They're decent for the price but not thrilled they ripped so quickly"
3.0,"Great polarization,  love the looks of them. My only complaint is that they scratch easy."
3.0,The fabric was a different texture but over all pretty.
3.0,"A bit tight on the temples, but I don't usually keep them on long, so they are okay."
3.0,This was too itchy for me to wear. I returned it.
3.0,"This is my 5th pair of Adrenalines. I love Brooks and this shoe. However, this pair has a defect. The right foot toe area is permanently dented in and the rubber is already peeling away from the shoe. I’ve only worn ghee about 25 times."
3.0,Cute and light but smaller than I thought. It was bought for a gift. I hope the person likes it.
3.0,"The picture is misleading, It appears to be able to be used with cufflinks however this is not the case. I was disappointed about this."
3.0,The sleeves were very short and the dress was nearly see through. It wasn’t very good quality.
3.0,I just lost this item because there is a little metal band o-ring but keep opening up and you don't pay attention it falls off I have to buy another one and this time I'm going to put that little bit of painters tape so it won't open hope the seller will improve this problem it's already five times that it's fall to the ground last night it was dark and I did not see it losing and up and falling down
3.0,"super cute but the fit of new styles changed to much more fitted, slimmer shape and for me, they did not fit comfortably, more restricted and not the same as original, relaxed cozy fit.  Disappointing!"
3.0,"There was not a lot of room in the heel, causing frustration as the sock slipped down on a constant basis.  Other brands off set this with an exaggerated heel.  The fabric does not have a lot of stretch in it, making them feel more like hospital socks than yoga footwear.  I think there are better brands available.  I would not buy this brand again.  However, for the low price I snagged these socks for on Amazon Deal of the Day, I cannot be mad at my purchase."
3.0,The color of lens and the stuffiness
3.0,"Way too small.  I am 6'2&quot; and I weigh 175-180.  I have a slim waist and a normal chest.  My shoulders might be broader than average, but this shirt was pulling at the seams.  Unless you are emaciated, buy larger than you normally would."
3.0,I must be allergic to it because as soon as I put it on my whole face will start itching. It's also way too big. Like made for someone with a big wide face. I do get lots of compliments on it though.
3.0,Obviously you can buy similar quality bags for A LOT LESS $$$! Keep in mind that you are PAYING WAY UP for the Lincoln Logo!
3.0,These were ok. They smelled like strong rubber for several days and had to keep them outside. They ran a bit big. But my kids wear them and don’t complain. Good for slipping on for the back yard.
3.0,It runs small so it just fits but it's tight on me.
3.0,"Does the job as far as a goofy prop but not as a movie prop, it is very small and lightweight plastic."
3.0,Ordered xl - waaay too small
3.0,"This costume was worth the money. It's not very thick, but full of itchy tule, the dress part like to come up because of the tule. The tights did not fit me. I am 5'6. They stopped at mid thigh. I cut the seem in the toes to get them up all the way and wore shoes."
3.0,I expected it to be more sparkly.  Like the black one and light blue one I previously purchased.
3.0,The chain that comes with is short. May need another . All in all was nice.
3.0,The over the shoulder strap tore off of the bag after 3 uses. I only carry sports gear in it. The backpack feature saved the bag. I can still use it.
3.0,We're not crew socks too long
3.0,"My daughter ordered this and she was sent a 2nd package because of a couple arriving broken. Bendable, removable, these aren't going to last very long but my daughter had fun with them. They're exactly what I thought they'd be for the price, nothing more or less. Since they were inexpensive, they arrived quickly, and were enjoyed I gave 3 stars. My daughter is 13. While they looked realistic enough for her purposes, if you're wanting an alternative to an actual piercing that'll last-look elsewhere. These are just a novelty item."
3.0,I returned the dress.
3.0,It's beautiful but beware of the sparkly residuals.
3.0,It would be great if the mask was separated from the top.
3.0,"It’s great to stick your Fitbit into, used it all the time stays pretty secure worth the money"
3.0,The top looks like a 3/4 but bittoms look more like 18 months. Bottoms are also very thin!! I got this to give as a gift. I'm not sure I will.  Also bows on legs are a brighter pink.
3.0,"Earrings are nice, but thought they would be bigger."
3.0,I would gave it a 5 star but I got it out of the package with a scratch on it other then that nice ring for the money
3.0,"Purchased these shorts with the intention of using  as an everyday pair of shorts. Overall quality wise they are nice. The shorts have two side pockets, a back pocket secured with Velcro, a fake drawstring, Velcro fly and a protective padding in the fly most likely used to prevent embarrassing moments from happening in the water. Now since I am using them as an everyday pair of shorts, I decided to cut that material out as it would make using the restroom a real challenge.<br /><br />My biggest con to these shorts is the Velcro fly. Now with this particular fly the Velcro consists of two small patches where the Velcro connects, leaving the rest of the fly open leaving your underwear visible.<br /><br />I decided to wear these out for the day running some errands. I had stopped to use the rest room and had dealt with the fact that the drawstring got stuck to the Velcro, so I yanked I guess a little to hard not seeing that the other end of the drawstring got pulled into the shorts to the point where I ended up pulling the entire string out of the shorts. Next thing I know I’m also spending 15 minutes trying to get these to small Velcro patches to stay together and finally got them to stay. Then later on as I was walking into a restaurant to meet a friend for lunch, I had my hands in pockets while walking in and I guess managed to detach the two small Velcro patches leaving me completely exposed in my blue boxers and apparently the stitching on one side of the velcro fell off.<br />It was literally mortifying as I had to hold the shorts up with my boxers in full view since the top velcro square material ripped off leaving nothing for the other part of the velcro to attach to.<br />I can honestly say it becomes a significant challenge to go grocery shopping when you have to hold your shorts up with one hand, push the shopping cart with other hand all this knowing that my boxers are in full view..<br /><br />So despite all of this I will keep the shorts but will have to sew a new velcro patch onto the shorts"
3.0,I used it for Plantar fasciitis and it made my feet worse. Did not work for me at all.
3.0,"I was so excited when I was offered this vintage beret for review - I mean, I really think I missed my decade because this style is so me!  Unfortunately, I was a bit bummed because it runs pretty small, so it looks ridiculous on my head.  Now for my kiddos, it looks great and super cute, but not quite the women's size I expected.  The style is beautiful, the black looks great with so much and the lace edging is wonderful.  There is a crease on the top of it that is a bit weird and since the material is so stiff, you cannot reshape it, but I suppose I could get over that if it had fit properly."
3.0,It’s not as strong as described and does not hold a charge very long.
3.0,"Beautiful bathing suit top, was so excited with it and fit perfectly, ordered a large, I usually wear a medium or large in shirts. Huge problem though , used it 2 times with no problem ,washed it each time, on the third time, let it air dry after wearing in the pool and colors bled, the bathing suit now has pink stains all over! :( Not happy at all! This has never happened with any of my bathing suits before!"
3.0,"This dress, while pretty, runs small in car chest area, also it is a little see through"
3.0,It's ok but too small for me :(
3.0,Gi top fits great. Pants are perfect length aswell. My only complaint after wearing once is that the drawstring on the pants is way too low. Basically when I tighten around my waist it pulls the pants up and they get tight in the crotch and butt area. Very uncomfortable
3.0,They are ok. Wearing them for work is fine. But they look fairly cheap. I don't expect them to hold up very well.
3.0,These frames are big and thick.  Very old-fashioned look without being a true vintage look that you'd really want.  My sister said I should get a giraffe custom to make them look better (I don't know if I should laugh or cry at that comment! lol)
3.0,"I'm typically a large, being 183cm (6ft) and about 90kg (185lbs?). Decided to size up to an xl, and glad I did. KTM's stuff typically fits a bit snug, since it's euro sizing. Also. shirt quality is not great, tbh. The material feels cheap, although the silk screen logo seems alright. A bit worried my nips night show through..."
3.0,Only complaint is the jacket is short in the body
3.0,Cute and dainty<br />Short chain and tarnishes easy
3.0,"Se me baja mucho, la cintura es demasiado floja."
3.0,"This is so cute! It did fit slightly smaller than I was expecting but not enough to need to exchange. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when it got wet, the pink bled onto other articles of clothing and towels. Ultimately, I love it though. And I get so many compliments every time I wear it!"
3.0,Super cute however they pop off your face upward. Not sure how to explain it but they don't just sit on your face they pop up if you move your eyebrows.
3.0,"Received as a birthday gift, looks cool, solid, strong magnet--so strong it ripped itself from the backing after the first use."
3.0,"Good fit, stitching coming out already. Bought in August."
3.0,"These earrings are very reasonably priced. They are made of very solid, strong, and not easy only malleable material. (Ie not easily bent out of shape) my concern on them tho is the star earring...the inside detail of the sequins are very jagged and uneven. It is noticeable upon reception of product but not noticeable to the point where it’s pointed out or thought about while wearing or seeing them on yourself. I have very sentive ears and can only wears 925, actual gold or bronze...true metals...so anything plated or coated irritates my piercings..unfortunately was the case with these as well, my son is using one with no issue though so I do believe it’s upon one self to said irritation. Over all the quality is great although the detail isn’t top notch. The price and shimmer of this product definitely satisfies my purchase in the end."
3.0,First of all they do not look like the picture. Size chart is way off.
3.0,Top was too tight
3.0,"Doesn't really look like the picture, an uncomfortable fabric, and too big."
3.0,It is too large than expected for the ave what I selected
3.0,It is what it is for a cheap necklace I’ll be surprised if I get five wears out of it. Might be a good idea to buy some necklace extenders.
3.0,I love the fit of the bra but I wouldn’t describe it as being high impact for a 38D. During my workout I felt like I was moving around more than I wanted. It’s still a great bra for the price.
3.0,Not crazy about material and too short
3.0,"I bought this for my husband because I loved how it looked. The only problem with this cuff is keeping it on. At times it will appear to be secure, only to fall off later and leave us hunting for it. If you are confident enough to come up with a way to keep this cuff on, than by all means purchase it and then please share with the rest of the class ;)"
3.0,It’s a basketball
3.0,"gems placed in an awkward position on post. Otherwise, the product is nice."
3.0,This is a light weight sweater. Love the fit. The color says lime green or light green. It is actually a bright almost neon yellow. I’m keeping it because I like the fit and the weight. May order another color.
3.0,"Very cute bracelet but, on the third day the turtle fell off. It is not holding up very well. It is a very cute bracelet."
3.0,Too small in Size
3.0,These are great looking but slide off my face really easily.
3.0,Really hard to get started. Can't get them to work on little wider band
3.0,"Pros: Fits my 36H size great, I like the shape it gives, I haven't had the underwire poke through at all and it’s a great price.<br />Cons: it’s VERY sheer and it’s not great fabric, slightly uncomfortable band."
3.0,These are great but some of the colors are off. They are OK because I talked to my granddaughter about princesses's changing this outfits.
3.0,"It's okay. It has nice pockets and size, but it is a cheap bag. It falls apart easily. The color faded very quickly. It won't last very long as an every day bag."
3.0,Gets tangled.
3.0,Cute but low quality. Already have a seem I need to fix.
3.0,Poor quality and tarnishes. Cute on first wear. Better for teenager and under due to cheap look.
3.0,"The length is good. The arm holes are slightly too small. The chest area is a bit big. I was devastated when I opened the package and tried it on initially, but I will update this review once the corset and eyelet clasps arrive in the mail. I'm going to sew the clasps to the flap of fabric on the back because it keeps popping out and looks wonky. The wedding is in August and this is the only thing I could find on such short notice the way everything is shipping..."
3.0,It is too loose.
3.0,"I will be sending these earrings back Only because they are so tiny you can't even see the ""horn"" of the animal. They Are real silver but they look too much like a horse."
3.0,"Fit is fine, but there were small scuff marks on the leather top just behind the toe (both shoes)"
3.0,"These definitely solved the issue of my toes being rubbed raw when wearing shoes without socks or stockings... but, the seams in the toe area are thick enough that they create their own issues. And, the strap that runs behind the heel is too thin—instead of laying flat, it tends to twist and dig into the heel."
3.0,The dress was too small. Loved the fabric and design.
3.0,Love this outfit! It looks absolutely adorable on my daughter! Perfect little lounge set
3.0,Just right. The fit is good however material quality could've been a bit better.
3.0,They snag really easily. The reviews said that they didn't slide up your wrist or down from your biceps. I use them for my entire work shift. They roll up and down all day. They have snags in the fabric and the grey one already has a whole in them. I drive a bus so my arms are in constant use.
3.0,I just wish it was longer. But good compression.
3.0,I don't for the pocket design.
3.0,I have a long torso therefore a really hard time finding rompers that fit. I ordered  a large and it fits comfortably but is too low cut and loose on top to wear as an outfit.<br />Works great as a swim coverup though!
3.0,By true size I am a medium. I ordered a large because I intended to use it to throw over my swin suit. The large was too small for me to even wear at all. I gave it to a friend who is a petite small.
3.0,Nice tribal statement necklace.  Comes unlinked but okay
3.0,Just didn’t like the overall fit. Neckline was high and tight
3.0,NOT REAL HAPPY WITH THE WATCH AS IT IS RUNNING SMALL AND NOT THAT PRETTY.
3.0,I did not feel very secure in these. They are probably sufficient for light yoga but I had to constantly adjust for a hot flow class. There is absolutely no way I would ever run or do any high impact activities in these. I am a 34c/d for reference and bought the smalls. The colors are nice though.
3.0,This backpack seems to be unstructured and really floppy any kind of weight in the top pocket makes the entire backpack fold over It has to be completely full to stand up it’s got a ton of useless straps the Molly webbing and color is nice though
3.0,I think this product is ridiculously overpriced. My son loves it. I dont think it's very safe compared to others I have bought. My son is stoked about wearing it so it stopped that battle of trying to force him to wear his mask at school. No weird smells like others we have purchased from other places. All in all I'm not complaining about product just price.
3.0,"This skirt looked soo cute! I got the blackish green.. but I’ll tell you now there is virtually no green.. it looks nothing like the photo. Another thing about it is I really expected a higher quality material. It looks like the nicer quality material used in a lot of skirts in dick’s sporting good but this was straight scuba/spandex material. Like what a bathing suit is made of. That I  turn made the skirt show every wrinkle underneath it from the pockets… it was too good to be true and rather cheap. Also to note, I fit into most bottoms in size large but this was mor like a large/medium, if you’re thicker on ur bottom half (butt abd thighs) it will b too tight, if u got a large rear I would size up for sure. It’s prob my fault for not checking the size’s measurement to be fair, but sizing aside I was disappointed in the quality of material for the higher price."
3.0,"Purchased this in a large as I wanted it to have a flowy bohemian look. It was to big! The arm holes were way to low, the dress looked more like a circus tent. Returning it for a refund."
3.0,"Cheap and costumish. Not quite as cute in person. Larger than I expected (and got a little heavy to wear),  which leads to the cheap look. Considering the price..im not mad I got what I paid for"
3.0,they are small for a kid
3.0,"Nice color and fabric, top is slightly small. Buttons came undone ok for a smaller breasted woman. I am 38c ordered larger, might order XL. Returned Item"
3.0,"the color is off from the picture, it's much darker in real life. and the inside isn't cute polkadot fabric but plain with the brand name stamped all over it. otherwise it's okay."
3.0,See-through top and print coming through the back. The skirt is lovely though.
3.0,"I ordered up a size for a roomy fit, and it is tight"
3.0,It's pretty but not sure how to use it when it has nothing to hold on to....
3.0,This bodysuit is a bit see through. I don’t know what under garments you would wear that would show through. Also the fabric is like a shiny swimsuit material. Not smooth and looks cheap.
3.0,I think it was too thin but color was great. Seem like it wouldnt make it after a couple washes
3.0,Runs small according to the description it should fit my 13lb dog.<br />However it’s too tight and he bit off the buttons.<br />Should not have buttons on it not a safe thing for dog clothing.
3.0,"Its okay, Very long. I'm 5 6 195 and the dress is almost to my calf. Soft material and coverage but a bit too long"
3.0,"Its cool and comfortable. It fits loosely which is really nice. The necklace is decent for being a free addition to a cheap blouse. Its an over-the-head type, without a clasp, requiring me to take my glasses off. But its a good length.<br /><br />Update: The blouse has no washing instructions. I washed it on cold with two other delicate blouses with minimal soap on light. It felt completely different. I mistook it for a t-shirt as it felt so incredibly strange. I checked again for a tag. No washing instructions. The tag I found might have been in French and wasn't enough to washing instructions. I can no longer wear it as a &#34;dress&#34; blouse as its no longer shiny.<br /><br />Update again: The material appears to mostly change back when completely dry. The tag in French has icon washing instructions that are strange. I'm unsure what to think."
3.0,I had to take the padding out out of the breasts because it fit VERY POORLY. Definitely not my favorite suit but a decent last resort
3.0,Product arrived missing stones so I had to return it. Other than that its super cute.
3.0,"Really liked these. I like the colorful design and they look good too. I keep them in my backpack in one of those cloth drawstring bags. Needless to say they take a beating. They lasted a while, but finally broke. I would order them again."
3.0,"Fabric is thin, very difficult to wrap and wear it like the model in the picture. I'm 5'1, 110 lbs, ordered in size S but still large and too long."
3.0,"The dress is okay but doesn’t fit as shown in the photo. The top is very loose so it doesn’t hug your chest, and it also doesn’t hug your waist. I ordered a small and I’m 5’7 140 lbs 34-26-34 for measurements sake. If you’re looking for a tight deep V look and youre of a smaller frame this dress will be too large."
3.0,"I like them, but the sizing is inaccurate, they are too small."
3.0,Part of it broken open after so long and was not able to fix it but was worn alot even in water.
3.0,"The quality is decent for the price and the bag is nice looking, but this bag did NOT zip over my 15&#34; MacBook Pro. It says the height of the bag is 12&#34; but the height of the zip section is much less. I didn't want to have to carry it open all the time. Also, if you pack this bag fairly heavy, the straps aren't very comfortable, though that's a problem with many bags like this. Could be a good work bag for a MacBook Air or tablet, but I'll be returning."
3.0,"They look great, but are so uncomfortable."
3.0,"Material is nice and the print is cute and looks just like in the photos. I’m 5’4” and found the sleeves just the right size, so a taller woman may find the sleeves too long. The main problem is the elastic waist is more of an empire waist instead of hitting at the true waist, so it just looks weird. It may fit a little better on a flat chested woman but if you have any kind of chest, I don’t think this will work. Unfortunately it has to go back. Too bad because I really like it, and would keep it if it was a straight sheath type dress."
3.0,Loved the outfit but it is for short people
3.0,"The pendant is nice, I will replace the chain though."
3.0,Was a little tight in chest.
3.0,"This lounging/jogger is the cutest! I got it for my daughter and it looks awesome on her. The size seems to be pretty accurate - she's 5' 7"", 140 pounds and we got a medium.<br /><br />There was one annoying issue that needed to be remedied. That waistline/elastic. First, it was oddly tight. She's thin in her mid-section and it was a tad tight on her (quite tight on me and I'm also a medium but thicker in the mid-section). Also, the elastic was not stitched in at all and got flipped. It was very uncomfortable. For now, we cut it and pulled  the elastic out and will eventually buy a wider, flatter string to pull through it. For now, she's just using the original string and it's okay.<br /><br />So, cute, but be prepared to make some changes to the pants."
3.0,Its not as good looking in lerson as it shows on pics hat looks cheap and delicate in person but will be an okay gift for christmas present
3.0,Not too bad. It’s a little flat in the face and the paint job isn’t the best. My biggest issue is that the lens on the left side is not attached to the mask it’s just sitting in the socket and can be easily popped off I can fix it myself but I shouldn’t have too for a brand new mask definitely not worth more then $30
3.0,I still love the look of these earrings but they stick out a lot further than I thought they would and I don't like that.
3.0,"I recently purchased this bag for a trip. It is a good size, and I love all the different compartments, BUT It is heavier than the other Travelon bags I have purchased. When arriving at my desination,  I dumped the contents into a lightweight bag for the sightseeing and put this bag aside until my trip home. The fact that it is heavier than my other Travelon bags was disappointing. It has been set aside and is not used.  I have several Travelon bags and this is my first disappointment."
3.0,Its cute only problem is it came with no Instructions how do u set the watch
3.0,"First of all the size chart is a bit off. I ordered a small when an extra small would have been better. Thankfully since it’s wool I was able to shrink it a bit. Secondly there is quiet a bit of extra fabric at the base. It tends to bunch up into a roll. Otherwise, I like that it is merino wool and not itchy. Also an affordable price. Just needs to be cut better."
3.0,"Not recommended for large busts. I normally wear 10-12 and bought 3XL. Stomach and bottom very flattering but the chest did not fit at all, i wear 38DDD."
3.0,Nice earrings but they do NOT huge around your earrings.
3.0,"Material is super thin, and it fits a little small, but for the price it's okay. Not great but okay."
3.0,Material makes me sweat and order one size larger
3.0,"This wasn’t what I expected. It’s a pretty color, but looks like cheap material, more like plastic than any kind of leather."
3.0,I bought this set for a Halloween costume - it did not last a full night before falling apart. The chains and clasps are very delicate and one of the handpieces fell apart when it got snagged on my top. The other when I reached into my purse and got snagged on a zipper. The necklace and earrings held up. You get what you pay for :)
3.0,"I bought Calida underwear from switzerland twenty years ago; Their underwear was beautiful and of the highest quality; it lasted ten years.<br />Unfortunately, Calida quality has gone downhill. This particular type only lasted three years and the looks is quite plain. Is it comfortable? absolutely! hence the three stars."
3.0,Runs small. Sizing would be better suited for a pre teen or a young teenager. Other than that they were made well. Took stars away for sizing issues.
3.0,"This bag is well made and attractive, however, it photographs as having a deep purple background when the actual colour is more like a muddy maroon that’s slightly faded; I suppose that’s because of the linen finish. I cant fault Amazon's photography as I took a pic myself, and it looked to have a more purple background in my photo too.<br />The embroidery however, is neat and beautifully done. Unfortunately for me, I got it as a gift for a teen who loves purple... and this colour combo seems to suit someone much older. It is a nice enough bag though, and someone who likes earthy colour combos would love it.<br />In future I think I will choose the silk/ satin items as they tend to photograph better so I should be able to tell the actual colours, I hope."
3.0,Not a fan of the fabric material used..would not purchase again. The print is nice...the material is not.
3.0,"The look and fit of the jacket is great. The only thing I did not like was the buttons, they are cheap and very light so they jingle every time you move."
3.0,"I bought this charger mainely to charge and power some of my electronics like it says it does just don't expect much from that considering unless your electronic devices require a very low voltage your fine and your cell phones were built in stone age ( when they first came out) other than that don't expect to be using this to charge newer phones whith this and finding adapters is next to impossible. However I did keep it torecharge my rechargable batteries as it describes. I do like the fact you can take it anywhere and charge my rechargable batteries if they start to die by the way is really nice to have on a sunny day out which most of us prefer to do anyway, downside you have to charge all 4 AA or AAA batteries at one time which is fine with me due to most of my stuff uses 4 batteries anyway. I do recommend this item if your looking for a great battery charger and to power your smaller electronics this is what you need but bigger items like a boom box and new cell phones thenthis is definately a NO buy. I hope everyone finds this review helpfull."
3.0,A little too shiny material for me
3.0,Very small fit.
3.0,The material is very paper like. Not very comfortable
3.0,This dress is very pretty but it was too big.  I normally wear a small but I would of needed an x-small for this.
3.0,"It's so cute and the material is really soft, but it;s also REALLY tight through the bodice and SUPER cropped. I could barely get it on/off. Returned."
3.0,"There ok, do what up expect as my pants do stay up ! Fit well but material could feel better."
3.0,I LOVED this shirt but unfortunately I was only able to wear this shirt twice. The first time I washed it the letters came off.
3.0,"While the body of this romper fits well, and as expected, the sleeves are several inches too long, making it look sloppy.  But I really like the fabric, with nice quality snaps."
3.0,I would like to recommend these but was sent the wrong color way twice. I won’t order a third item. The color and fabric look cold and comfortable. Wish I had gotten the right set so I could wear them!
3.0,"The bottoms have a funny cut to them, tend to ride up."
3.0,"Liked the material, did not like the neck."
3.0,"Made of high quality material. Some of the very tiny screws are loose, and unless your a jewelry there is no way to tighten them. The size is very wide."
3.0,"The fit was tight, but other than that they are fine - nothing special, but OK for pictures."
3.0,The fabric and the colors are phenomenal. It fits large in the top and long in the legs. I purchased this for my daughter who is 5'4&#34; and weights<br />102 lbs - she is going to keep it and I am going to try to shorten the straps for a better fit.
3.0,Good product just need a bigger size.
3.0,"It looks beautiful and was the favorite charm my girlfriend ever had. Then one day while washing her hands, she found out it's not water proof. So I ordered another one. Same beauty. After about a month though, the battery died and we found it impossible to find either a spare battery or a jeweler who was willing to open the fragile back to replace it. Finally found the rare battery to replace it and it was cheaper to just buy another new one. It looks nice but not worth the hassles. I would not recommend this product!"
3.0,Super cute and fit great but the fact that you have to unzip them to reach the battery pack every time you want to turn them on or off is annoying and very inconvenient.
3.0,Sad to say I ordered Brown and Black. I received two Brown please help me get the black.  By the way I love the belts.
3.0,I like the style.  I like the way they hang.  I do not like the material they are made of.  Listing said it was silver plated.  I know for the price you can't expect sterling but these do not look like silver at all.  The color is closer to the material dog tags are made of.  Stainless steel?  Not sure.  But I sent them back.  Maybe the gold looks better than the silver but I did not want to bother ordering again to find out.
3.0,I didn’t wear them for workouts.  They were cheaply made.
3.0,a pin fell out of the wrist band after maybe 6 wears.  not cool.
3.0,Nice bag but I question whether this is an authentic Coach?  It was not shipped by Coach and did not come with the usual Coach packaging or inserts.
3.0,"The strap looks very cheap, I think, but time will tell if it breaks down a bit with wear (to make it look more like leather). The face is very cool. Was a gift for my husband for our 5 year anniversary (Wood gift)."
3.0,I'm giving it 3 stars for two reasons: They are sized way too big. But also the insole wasn't secured on either shoe. This is ridiculous for a toddler taking their sweaty shoes on and off and have that come out along with their foot! I reordered in a smaller size because they really are cute and the mesh is great if you have a cute little girl with stinky little feet. If the new pair are made correctly with the insole is secured I might bump my rating up to 4 stars.
3.0,The torso of this cardigan is much shorter than I thought it was going to be- I thought it would be longer than what it was. I have long arms so the sleeves are short as well.
3.0,Stones fell out of the heart
3.0,"Just got my purse, quick delivery. BUT...The chain around the opening of the purse is a really thin plastic, so when i tried to close it up the two (2) pearls on tge end of the chain broke off. Not happy, but easy fix. Overall, it's still a cute one!"
3.0,Item arrived quickly and as described. Very tight at the top - right behind the knees.
3.0,I was lookin forward to these. They are thin { some what see through).<br />I like high waisted pants n shorts but these aren't so comfy.<br />I am keeping them because I love tie dye.<br />168lbs 5'4 I got an xlarge
3.0,No me agrado que no trae almohadillas para proteger el busto. No es plizado ni tan largo como lo hacen ver en la foto.
3.0,"I got two completely defective rings in the package along with the others. It’s a good thing that I ended up not needing all 50, as I would have been short. Also it was way over packaged with far too much plastic."
3.0,"Love the set, but have had to repair many parts."
3.0,I love the  tie and my cousin love it too.<br />I didn't received the tie for my wedding March 18th so I have to buy my cousin shirt and tie for the occasion.<br />I received the tie March 20th
3.0,"This sweater was a little boxy for me. The neck was higher than it appeared on the photo. I ended up returning it since it fit me funny. I did give it 3 stars though, as the quality seemed good. It would most likely fit better for someone with a shorter torso and more curves than I have!"
3.0,Received as a gift and returned it. It is rather cheap - basically Terry cloth. Also only a quarter zip- I prefer a full zip
3.0,"Vite dress nice color and print but I returned it unfocus the fitting wasn’t that comfortable, too tight on shoulders and to wide on waist, I got a small ( I’m 5”4, 120 lbs)  the extra small will fit my waist perfectly but doubt that it will fit on my shoulders :/"
3.0,"An odd hat. I wasn't expecting the material to be so stiff on top. Now I can imagine that it would be a good hat with snowfall for prolonged use outside IF the hat fit. But.. the band is very unforgiving if you have a little bit larger cranium and even then the top never really rested well. If I turned my head it would start to loosen and lift off. The BF tried it on and he has a smaller hat size normally. He kept mashing it down to stay on as well.<br />It's okay..but honestly I think that there's a bit of a design flaw of some sort for adults. That said, it does stay on my 9yo child, although it slips down over her eyes. Which I would expect since it's an adult size. However, it does stay on her, since it swallows most of her head."
3.0,This is very comfortable material. However the sleeves are a bit tight and made of a different material and sort of ruin the feel and look.
3.0,Not crazy about the feel of the fabric but love the pockets and has good balance.  I ordered a size larger than normal based on other reviews and it's still going to be snug across the busy when loaded up with &#34;stuff.&#34;
3.0,"True leather gloves and they may be very useful but I can't speak to that because these gloves sized Large were dreadfully small, I couldn't get my hands remotely in them. I wear a mens Large, these are far too small."
3.0,"I really like the idea of this but, it's not really for me.  the closure pops open if hit the right way.  since you're carrying this on its side when using the strap small items can fall out.  I would prefer a leather case"
3.0,"Purchased the large for my 24&#34; hardside suitcase per the product details. Though the cover looks great and just as pictured, the fit was loose and poor for my suitcase. My wheels tend to catch the material, and the cover ends up being dragged as I am walking.<br /><br />The cover serves its purpose to protect my hardside when I check my bag, but after only a few trips, its already looks worn and faded. I don't expect it to hold up very long"
3.0,"Too big :(  I'm 5'3 and 95lbs and it was about 1.5 to 2 inches too long and wide around the arms and waist.  Material was okay, round neck a bit high for my liking, but overall just didn't suit my body type.  I could see it looking very nice on others though!"
3.0,Esthetically pleasing<br />Real leather<br />But flimsy<br />Already stretching out also the extra string hanging over after placing on hand is often in the way
3.0,Stokes fall out even on first wear but cute
3.0,The gold color in the ring makes it look really fake. The ring is very sturdy though
3.0,This is just ok..
3.0,"The boots were amazing, the only thing was it was shorter l, we order a 11 size and we think was 10, probably asking for one size longer it will be fine.<br />We just returned them. Hopefully we get our money back"
3.0,It’s an ok shirt but the arms run tight.
3.0,This is ok but cheaply made. I was hoping for better. I cut off what was to be hair. Hated that part.
3.0,"Loved this romper, but it was too small.  I'm 5'4 and 145 pounds.  I also have a long torso.  Even though it didn't fit me it was beautifully made and the colors were great."
3.0,"The sleeves are huge get caught on everything, not happy"
3.0,"It's very comfortable, it's a lightweight the problem the zipper won't worked. I try to return it but I don't have label to ship it back."
3.0,The elbow patches are sewn on weird and not on the elbows.. more like the side of the arm.. I have to keep pulling the sleeve... Not very happy with this item
3.0,GOOD PRODUCT TO USE AS COSTUME ACCESSORY
3.0,Very pretty. I thought that it would be larger. I had problems putting them on.
3.0,Looks elegant online and then big and boring on
3.0,The price was good but not the fit
3.0,This was very small. I ended up gifting it to my 10 year old niece because I couldn't wear it. At least she's happy. haha
3.0,"Super cute, but too big in the armpit area. Disappointed."
3.0,I found the material very thin and no lining!
3.0,Too stringy. I gave it away. It did appear to be of good quality though.
3.0,Only giving 3 stars because the fabric is super super thin. I don't think it will do much to block out the sun. The sewing is fine but lots of left behind strings that we're not trimmed. Cute design and perfect for this year. My son is 9 months old so he'll only get 1 year out of this anyways but I will not repurchase again.
3.0,They are thinner than I expected and are small. Especially the waist and cuffs around the calves.
3.0,Very handy small purse. I wish it would last longer because it's already tearing apart and only been using it within 3-4 months.
3.0,"You will need to add more padding to it so that it doesn’t interfere with your eyelashes.<br /><br />I had to super glue a little chunk of sponge to the forehead so the mask wouldn’t push my eyelashes into my eyes.<br /><br />Other than that, no complaints."
3.0,It was very tiny.. not really worth the cost
3.0,work pretty good ...I have seen better but they do work......if you are really needing some then they may work for you but his neck is really thick and they do not extend very much.
3.0,Disappointed.  Came in folded and wrinkled. Material very thin.
3.0,"Bought one of these on a cruise liner (big mistake) and overpaid bigtime.<br />It is a lovely watch, great latch.  Wind it up fully and you MAY get two days out of it.  I have a ten year old automatic Seiko worth far less and will run for two weeks if you fully charge it.<br />Tested night illumination, big disappointment.  Left it in window so it would get 6 hours of full contact sun and within four hours of darkness, face was not readable.<br />Read a review that says they lose a minute a month.  No evidence of that yet."
3.0,"It a good price and cute. The fabric is a little cheap, but once again it was well priced for what was received. It does run small so order up, specifically if you are busty."
3.0,"I'm not sure if it's the color I ordered or just misrepresenting in the item, but mine did NOT have zip off legs. I was going to return them, but when I tried them on I realized they were nice pants. So, I kept them.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a nice, lightweight, pair of pants then these are a good choice. However, if you must have the zip off legs don't order these. At least in this color."
3.0,The zipper is really long
3.0,"These were for my 2 year old who wears a size 6 in all his other shoes.  I used the measurement chart and everything (his feet are are 5 1/2 inches long, so I bought him a size 7, which, according to the chart should give him a good extra 1/2 inch!!) and it's very hard to stuff his feet into them.  They will fit snug and only for a couple months, which sucks because it's winter, and I was hoping that extra room would make them last the whole summer.  Oh well, I know for next time. My husband wears Nike Jordan runners all the time, and he says he always buys a size up from Nike Jordan.  Otherwise, these look very well made, and the colour was a perfect match to my computer.  A great red!"
3.0,"I'm a tall person, so this suit is too short for me; but that's not really their fault.  I just can't wear it."
3.0,"They are nice but as I mentioned, one was broken.  Would like credit or new set of earrings for the same price"
3.0,A little smaller than advertised.
3.0,"The bundle arrived on time, it’s ok most of the colors are dark, which will pair well with winter wardrobe<br />FYI there is NO clear band in this hence the low rating."
3.0,I needed a black watch for work that had an hourly chime.  I received this watch on-time and well packaged and the seller was fantastic.  There was nothing wrong with the watch other than it was WAY too big for me.  It's my fault since I didn't realize how big 49mm would be.  Thankfully I also ordered a women's black digital Casio that also fit the bill and wasn't too big.  I would recommend this watch to a very large man or someone wanting to make a fashion statement with a giant watch.  ;-)
3.0,Love the boots very comfy but the liners came out first time I wore them. Guess you get what you pay for but they are pretty.
3.0,"Hat is very flexible, which probably helps with the fit as it seems to be one size fits most. Quality could be better; the brads where the lanyard goes through the hat seem to be a weak point. One of them has already become dislodged either resulting in or caused by a small rip in the weaving at that point. trying not to aggravate it and make it worse, hoping it will last the summer."
3.0,"My night vision is not the best. The glare of oncoming headlights has been a problem as well the the halo I usually see around street and traffic lights. Driving in rainy weather is the worst of the worst for me. I had toyed with buying night driving glasses for a long time to see if they would provide any real significant improvement. I finally took the plunge and bought these glasses. My expectations were low but was optimistically hopeful. I've been using them for a few weeks now. The only benefit they provide for me is reducing the intense glare of oncoming headlights. That's an improvement but I was still wishing they could do something about the halo effect as well. Perhaps if glasses of this type had some type of additional polarization that might resolve the halo affect I have. To get the full benefit I seek I'd probably need to get professionally made glasses from my optometrist  which would could big bucks. So for now, I'll stick with these and reap the smaller benefit and talk to my optometrist and see if a better solution can be achieved."
3.0,"This is beautiful, but I can’t wear it yet. I have to wait for the plain, black tank top dress I ordered comes in to put under it. The dress you get when you order this is 100% see through. Even where the sequins are. So order something to go under it at the same time if you want to wear it right away!! My tank dress won’t be here til JUNE now!!"
3.0,"Size did not correlate with actual product. Ordered a 3x in anticipation of needing a larger size, what I got was effectively a medium at best.<br /><br />The hoodie itself was pretty good quality and if it had fit I would have kept it. Truthfully disappointed because this looked incredible, felt great to touch, but the size can't fit my shoulders :("
3.0,"I'm 5'1, around 115 lbs, and 32C bust. I got this dress for homecoming because I wanted something casual, but I think it's a little too casual for homecoming so I used heels to dress it up. It's pretty short and goes down to around mid-thigh, maybe a little shorter. The top of the dress is loose, not necessarily the bust just the top comes out a little. It's much more dark blue than shown in the picture. The material feels kind of flannel and it isn't very stretchy. The back is really cute which, in my opinion, makes up for the cons. Also around the waist, it bunches up a bit, but it doesn't really look bad."
3.0,"Cute little necklace.  Is longer than stated,  and also has an extender which was not stated.  Lays very nice."
3.0,The jeans did not fit me and ripped pretty easily. 🥱👎🏾
3.0,"I got this for my mother, I did notice when taking it out of the package of a loose seam that caused a small hole. I can sew it up but if you’re unable to, you may want to reconsider purchasing this. But for only $14 I’m not really complaining or returning. It is a beautiful pattern & I like the material."
3.0,We were just barely able to get an XL to fit over a men's size 7 sneaker. It wasn't easy. Not sure we'll be able to repeat this feat very many times though without damaging them.
3.0,The strap broke and the quality was not good.
3.0,"Definitely too large for my almost 2 year old. Just slightly too small for my adult head, but I wear it anyways, because it's warm and nice looking."
3.0,Fits small so you should get the next size
3.0,"It’s run large...not really off the shoulder and made of a cheap polyester material. I am 5’3”, 110 and was swimming in a small. I’ll take it camping with me..."
3.0,They run very small!!! This is the first time that underwear didn’t fit and we always buy Boss.
3.0,This dress is adorable - I love the fabric!  The issue I had was way too small in the bust (I am 36 DD) but it fit everywhere else once I got it over the girls.  My co-worker tried it on and it fit perfectly so I've ordered a large (may have taken a XL or XXL but not available)  I am 5'2&#34; and 150lbs.  The length was perfect - it hit at the top of my knee.<br /><br />I hope this review helps!
3.0,"I loved these glasses. However, the plastic frame is very fragile and broke after a week of wearing."
3.0,I’m a 3x/4x 5’11. I ordered a 5xl because I wanted this to be roomy and long to pair with leggings. Disappointed it’s much shorter than it looks in the photos and definitely not as roomy as I expected it to be. Also color is a bit off. Quality is good- nice and lightweight but unfortunately I will be returning
3.0,"It's a little awkward in the bust area, but I wore it under a kimono, I made it work!"
3.0,"Caps nice but hurt my head a bit, too snug"
3.0,"I ordered this because the picture on Amazon depicted a definite ""V"" shape on the top which I thought would be slimming.  Actually, the bra top and the bottom are off kilter.  The bra top needs to be moved to the left to match the blue and black ""V"" shaped lines, if you can see from the photo.  I won't wear it, looks poorly made."
3.0,this is a lovely cuff but doesn't hold hair ties like I had hoped
3.0,Colorful but hard to match other clothes
3.0,"Going to return these and order one size down.  Usually a small/medium in leggings but i always order a large in shorts. So i ordered a large in these shorts as i Usually do. These are oversized and the scrunch does nothing for my shape unless i size down. My measurements are:<br />Waist 29""<br />Hips: 36""<br />Glutes: 40""<br />Thigh: 23""-24"""
3.0,"I saw these swim bottoms along with the top on another site and went online and found both the top and bottom on Amazon. Honestly, I was going to return both the top and bottoms, however I would have had to pay for return shipping, so I decided to just keep them and wear the swimsuit around my pool at home.<br /><br />I bought this thinking the bottoms had full coverage (based on other photos I had seen online of this swim suit), however it is slightly more cheeky than I expected. In the end, I can deal with the amount of my bottom it exposes. What bothered me is the pattern and the way the fabric is cut. The pattern doesn't quite line up correctly in a couple places and it makes the swimsuit bottoms look kind of off- centered when it is on."
3.0,Watch dial is bigger than it appears to be here
3.0,This dress is very see through! Had to make sure I wore white undergarments. I wore a cardigan and it worked fine.
3.0,Looks a lot nicer in the photos than it does in person...good for the price though
3.0,Looks good at first but the after one wash you can tell the material is cheap. Not going to last longer then this summer.
3.0,Not bad but not great. They are very bulky and do not block as much noise when running power tools as I had hoped. I still have to wear inner ear plugs with these if I am running a table saw.
3.0,It does not fit as well as I expected. I even ordered a size up . Not sure if I'll wear it or use it for fabric to make doll clothes
3.0,I love these a little cheap but they are too cute
3.0,"It's a pretty color and its warm. I wear a cammie under it, because the fabric is a little itchy. The bottom of the sleeves have stretched out a little. The sleeves fall down over my hands."
3.0,"This keeps happening to me over and over. I don't know when I will learn I always expect some thing larger than what I get from Amazon jewelry. I'm not going to return them. I am sure I can find times to wear them. But beware, often, earrings are smaller than they are represented to be."
3.0,I am not too happy with the purse. I needed to be a little taller and wider.
3.0,I really loved the way it fits and looks. Then I washed it and it got all fuzzy/faded. I feel total sadness. It doesn’t look good anymore. It looks embarrassing after that first wash. 😞  I’m returning it.<br />***Me encanto como me queda y come se me mira. Lo lavé y la tela se llenó de bolitas/pelusas/perdió el color. Me siento muy triste. Ya no se mira bien. Me da vergüenza ponérmelo después de lavarlo. 😞  Lo voy a regresar. ***
3.0,The necklace is really cute and pretty. My assume come with the caption on the header of the page. Is much to large for a girl.  We got this for our granddaughter. If you wanted to indicate a young lady then say young lady not girl. Not I have to scramble to get her another gift. As I said the necklace is nice just need to indicate it is for an old girl or young lady.
3.0,"Love the style, wish I'd chosen a different color. It's darker than the cream you'd expect, more of a tan/flesh color."
3.0,Love the frame but it hurts behind the ears after a while
3.0,"This sweatshirt is too large, I ordered some from other brands (size M too) and they fitted well"
3.0,The straps are a little thicker than I wanted but the material is nice.
3.0,Nice pairs of socks for the price. But there's no size to select. I think I was randomly sent size 4 which would be naturally smaller size because I wear size 9 shoes.<br /><br />However it is made of stretchable fabric.<br /><br />The cute thing is that it has a cat character that peeps out if you're wearing it with ballet shoes.
3.0,Cute but ears are a bit crooked
3.0,Little cheaper  feeling then expected<br />Quick delivery  tho!
3.0,But this is hollow in the back! Imagine my surprise when I turned the pendant over to find it completely indented rather than a solid or flat piece. I'm returning this.
3.0,"Not sure what I was expecting; however, this was not it.  It will do for the time being until I find something I like better.  The change purse in the middle only seems to add bulk to the wristlet.  The &#34;leather&#34; is ok.  I guess for now it will fulfill its purpose."
3.0,The socks are beautiful; and perfect thickness to my liking.  However the top of the socks are tight so they are too hard to get on to my feet.  And I am sure after a day of wearing I will have a big indention on my leg due to this tightness.  I will gift them to a friend with smaller feet.
3.0,Beautiful shoe but too small & didn't offer larger size.
3.0,More for guys in the height of I wouldn't go over 5 foot 10 anything more than that it looks small on the face
3.0,Being 5'9 with all legs and arms and this was not satisfactory for me. Sleeves are 3/4 sleeves on me but pants were long enough.  I ordered a medium but a large would not have made my sleeves any longer.
3.0,GOOD PRODUCT TO USE AS COSTUME ACCESSORY
3.0,"These are somewhat inconsistent. I bought two pair, a black pair and a gray camo pair. The black ones are perfect and comfortable. The gray camo pair are sewn unevenly such that the back seam is crooked and the arched seam is very obviously not the same left to right. It’s as if each half is a different size or one was cut incorrectly."
3.0,"Nice color, just very see-through thin material."
3.0,"I bought these in large to see if they would be roomy and comfortable just wearing around the house.  They are both of those, but I do not like them on me.  They stay in place and are not see through, but this color shows everything!  If you have an ounce of fat on you, do NOT get these.  I also ordered these in medium (my size) and they do the same.  I am NOT happy with this color."
3.0,"Super cute design, but poor construction. Son loved it and was disappointed when the hole appeared in the butt 2nd time he wore it (really noticable spot). We were able to repair it, but Im not impressed..."
3.0,"Heads up, this shoe runs big"
3.0,very cheaply made... not warm at all...
3.0,they fit BUT to tight not good as Hanes
3.0,It's good for women
3.0,I have bought 4 of these sleepshirts and love them.  This one has a saggy neckline so I'm not as happy with it as others.
3.0,"I didnt know that microfiber and spandex are the same thing. These are very spandex like. Not my fave, but I like the coverage. It's fine."
3.0,Definitely made in China and was delivered very wrinkled and smelled terrible. Can't beat the price but nothing exciting.
3.0,I liked them but there were too many duplicate ones. More original ones please
3.0,Good quality for a decent price but finish is gunmetal rather than chrome.
3.0,Key ring looks nice & is well built but when opening latch to remove from built loop it pinches your finger. Very painful
3.0,This cardigan definitely fits like a boyfriend style would and it is a nice color. Very heavy so it will keep you warm
3.0,Wore them once. Comfortable but already have pulls in them.
3.0,I really liked these pants but I'm sad on how tight they really fit. The size is small for a true size.
3.0,It seems more like a costume hat than a good every hat. It's OK for the price.
3.0,"Decent bathing suit, good colors, bottoms are a bit cheeky.. Don't go with this one if you like to cover up!"
3.0,"Two of the tanks started falling apart in the wash, very flimsy, thin material."
3.0,I was expecting the bag to have the strap that allows it to be attached to my luggage handle. Other than that it is a very nice bag.
3.0,"This dress for very well, just did not like the colors, hard to tell in the picture but just couldn't do it."
3.0,"The stone was not very pink, and it is not the best quality. Even though the size was correct it just looks small on my hand. It would be a perfect ring for a young girl!"
3.0,The middle of the bottom goes up too high for my comfort level and the sleeves are a little more baggy and so that designer feel was lost but the size was fine it just wasn’t my style
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  The shoes were worn out and needed to be replaced after two months, and no, my child didn't do anything in them except go to school."
3.0,My 3x Columbia  shirts fit fine. These fit tighter
3.0,well the charm off and its like a bronze color
3.0,"These look cool but these are the thinnest socks I’ve ever used. I mean these are ridiculous you cannot be serious? These will have a hole after one single use. These are a nice souvenir novelty item but not for every day use, or more then one day"
3.0,"I have to say it’s a cute loose lounger. It’s a nice cut, very flattering.  But... very poor fabric.  The<br />‘’ rayon spandex’’ blend is coarse and pilling after only 2-3 washings. It is cheap enough to just buy for an event, it’s so simple it can dress up or down and it can look pretty good.  Just don’t expect quality."
3.0,Seems very solid but it is not a polished finish ring it’s a dull graphite color
3.0,"Very pretty dress but it was too small for me ended up wearing it as a shirt with tights, still cute even though I recommend ordering a size up"
3.0,"These were my favorite yoga pants ever. They fit great at first, and they weren't see-through. I purchased them in September, and by November they have already become too stretched out and have several holes. I'm a big girl, and the seams have come undone where my thighs rub together."
3.0,"Very, very cute dresses, however this one color is smaller in the chest than the other 2 I have ordered. The dresses are SHORT so beware when bending over! 3 stars for those two reasons."
3.0,too small to be an anklet
3.0,"Cute but pretty tight on my normal sized head. To give perspective, I need to get kids baseball caps and this felt tight on my forehead."
3.0,I think they are great the concept is good but but if you bend over they fall off your face
3.0,The sunglasses are fine.  What is really fun is the hard case with orange zipper - so cute.
3.0,They were nice quality but didn’t fit me right. Weird hem line in the crotch area and not flattering for me.
3.0,"It's pretty, but it's too small. The chain is too."
3.0,Looks good smells funky. Good for the price
3.0,"I want to like this hat, but am having trouble getting the wrinkles and creases out. Also it was a little big for me."
3.0,"Not the SLab quality that I expect. For running in the woods there deffentally not durable enough to hold up to the occasional run in with brush...I have an older pair of SLab 12"" shorts that are a higher quality that's not available from Salomon today...I'll be sending these back unfortunately!"
3.0,"Love the outfit, but I ordered a size down as someone else suggested… got 2T, fits my 4 year old who wears 5T!!! Outfit is massive on my 2 year old!!"
3.0,"worn for only a day and the 'chain' broke - alas is was only a Halloween costume, and she can still wear it as a play-dress etc., but it just loses a litle bit of the goth."
3.0,Lenses are to larges to be 80s themed glasses
3.0,needed one size bigger
3.0,"My husband is a Medium but I ordered the Large because he will be using it while wave jumping with our grandson and he needs room to move. I buy him a Large in his golf shirts.  Unfortunately, the Large was too big in the shoulders and sleeves.  We couldn't push up the sleeves and keep them in place so I had to return the shirt.  The shirt is good quality.  Be advised that you will have to pay the postage if you return the shirt."
3.0,"good for simple things like ensuring something doesn't fall off / stays clipped. not for anything heavier than a water bottle cap or something, though. for the money, worth it to just have some for clipping keys to belt loop or something, but not for much more than that."
3.0,"This did not fit accordingly, but  (for the price), the fabric is good.  It also curls up at the hem when I tried it on. I wished it had worked for me,  but it didn't."
3.0,Good looking glasses. Too small for grown man. Should say - womenswear. Price too for its style and look. Should be about $10 cheaper. I had to return them. Too small for my face.
3.0,This was not a good fit for me. I ordered two sizes because I wasn’t quite sure which one I would fall under but both did not fit me well. The material I felt like was too heavy especially since I was trying to purchase for a beach vacation type of trip.... I thought the material would be a little softer... it was heavy and rough. I had to return.
3.0,There made from a matirial that gets snagged on everything
3.0,Not as long as in the picture. They go about 2inches from wrist
3.0,"Wow these are great looking desert boots , just like the ones I wore in the 60's. The color green is really cool as well.  ONE THING though they are awfully hard and stiff ???? What is your advice ,,,, keep or send back ???? How long will they take to soften up ?"
3.0,Its the best purchase in my life... I love it! I really love it. i can to recommend this item.
3.0,"Nice color, material seems nice, but when I opened it up it had a ripped seam inside by the arm that was marked with bright pink thread... Now I will have to fix that myself. What can you expect at this price?<br /><br />Loose and baggy by the waist and very tight around the arms, barely any shirt room."
3.0,I ordered a size larger than I normally wear.  The jacket fits perfectly but I need another size larger for the pants. Order accordingly if you have larger hips.
3.0,"Really cute and flattering, but found the material to be super unflattering. It was almost like a spandex-y material. Cute dress with potential but was not a fan :/"
3.0,Too big to carry in the bag. It is not pretty like photo.
3.0,"I'm 5'3 and about 120 lbs and ordered a small, the sleeves, bust line and waist are perfect on this dress but it's a bit too long for me but I guess I can shorten it easy enough.  Cute dress!!"
3.0,"The stitching is lacking quality in the area when the top meets the skirt.  I find it's ok for bumming around the house (for me), but not for work or going out."
3.0,Top quality. Long in the waist. Probably would work better on a larger woman.
3.0,Very cute dress but the fit was weird on top. Had to return it.
3.0,"I'm 5'4 sz 12 with 38DDD chest and a long torso.  I ordered 2. Xl and xxl. The XL was more flattering as it was more fitted... but... with both sizes, the chest was extremely small. The stretch would allow any size, but neither xl or xxl were going to come close to supporting DDDs. Even with the straps as tight as they can go, 80% of the DDDs spills over."
3.0,Just didn’t flatter my figure. A bit too short and young looking.
3.0,"I loved this ring to death, I wore it every day until the little jewels fell out and the ring got all twisted up, I only had the ring for about 2 months. I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't fall apart because it was so cute"
3.0,A bit small you can wear a camisole under it and leave it open
3.0,"Liked the fit, short and curvy here (5'3&#34;) but they developed holes rather quickly for wearing perhaps once a week."
3.0,It’s a loose sheath dress.  Material is thin with no body.  The opening at the declatee is too low for my taste.
3.0,Wouldn't say they would work at 35 below zero.  I work in a factory with no heat source.  Feet are still cold.
3.0,"It's made really, really well. Very beautiful and looks just like Catwoman's mask/cowl. But it's WAY too small to fit my head. I don't think I have an especially big head, but maybe I do because I was dying in this. Literally. I choked myself! And the chin strap squeezes you into the mask/cowl in a way that was so unflattering. I know it's the chin strap because other reviews complained of it being kinda tight and once I cut it, the rest of it fit comfortably on my head.<br /><br />But it IS overall the best one on Amazon, so I'll simply alter it a bit. I already cut the chin strap and plan on maybe hot gluing some stretchy fabric on either end of the cut strap. We'll see how it goes!"
3.0,Top of dress was slightly faded however the fabric is stretching so it’s a comfy dress to wear
3.0,"Cool... not as nice as expected, but cool."
3.0,"Cheap, fun party hat!"
3.0,Got a couple weeks in before it turnt rusty
3.0,I ordered my childs normal shoe size and these were to small. I was really disappointed. The part that covers the top of the foot was so tight.
3.0,"The jacket is well-sewn, good fabric, and the sizing is good.  (I generally get a medium -long- and I ordered the medium so that's fine.)  The problems are:<br />—It's much more boxy than the picture shows, and does not have a drawstring (on this model)<br />—The zipper is on the female side though i ordered mens.  I have the dexterity but it's not automatic<br />—The hood indeed does have a zipper, but it's the WRONG KIND.  It doesn't detach; just unzips like blue-jeans.<br />I've tailored it less boxy and I can deal with the issues, but it's not exactly what I expected"
3.0,"Cheap but still quite cute.  Great for a day where you want to dress up a casual bottom.  Looks good on camera but it is cheaply made though.  Strings had to be cut off and you can see the lazy stitching in person and up close.  Overall, i thought it was a worthwhile purchase"
3.0,It's cute but not fitting like I expected
3.0,Not what I expected. I chose this set because the pictures also showed the assortment with watch arms. I didn't get a single watch arm. Contacted seller and they made it right. Still 3 stars for misleading pictures. Positive is that these seem to be sturdy and I'll be able to use them. Just really disappointed my assortment didn't have even one watch arm which was the whole reason I went with this pack vs others.
3.0,I feel the corners were a little “sharp” and I don’t mean that it cut me. But that it was snagging one of my tops and frayed one of my shirts. I always love to wear my necklaces whether they are exposed or not and I didn’T want to keep something I can’t wear with everything. It’s very light in weight and thin. I definitely preferred this style opposed to the only other Gemini pendant I seen because I feel this one looks more feminine. I guess depends on the look you’re going for... and the length of the chain you chose to put it on. The star rating isn’t because this is a bad product just unfortunately not for me. Again I wish it would have. I inserted a picture with a it on a 18 inch chain.
3.0,I love the coat. But it came so wrinkled and I’m having a hard time getting them out!
3.0,"Very light, plastic posts are difficult to insert."
3.0,Too small!!  My husband's wedding band is a 10 so that's what I ordered and these are to tight to wear comfortably!
3.0,Just OK looks like Walmart cheap junk jewelry.
3.0,I ordered a 38B and found this style was rather tight around my ribs.
3.0,Idk if I just got the bad one of the lot but after I tried them on the lace in the back was frayed and made a hole
3.0,A little too big. I also have cats & this pair of pants collects more fur than my vaccuum cleaner...
3.0,"I like the fabric. Very wrinkly after washing...but it doesn't matter because it's stretchy when you put it on.<br />The white is very see-through, but I bought it to layer and not wear alone.<br />The sleeve opening is rather cut in towards the chest too, so no wearing this without something over it....unless you wear a halter style bra.<br />The only thing I wish is that the collar was wider. The collar is more narrow that a true mock neck."
3.0,It is a beautiful dress a little too tight around the bust area in a little too short above my ankles by 3 in and I am 5 foot 5 in tall I am also 39 inches around the bus thought it would fit the color was beautiful and so was the design
3.0,"The fabric is surprisingly soft. However, the seem does not fit under my bust, but rather right across it -making me look pregnant. Since it was so inexpensive I am just going to keep it and wear it on lazy days."
3.0,Liked the color quality poor after first wash
3.0,For the price  it was incredibly underwhelming.
3.0,"Loved the dress, but it is a bit too large for a one and half yr old toddler. ( I ordered 2t) But the dress is very pretty and nice material I’m excited for when it fits better!!!"
3.0,"This dress was very uncomfortable. I was encouraged to order two sizes larger than I normally wear, which I did, and that was a good advise, but it didn't fit right and the back of the dress is NOT at all like the photo. There is a big opening, with the lace up closure. The lace up closure is nice so it can fit better, but I did want a big, circular opening in the back. I wanted a closed back dress, like the picture.  I cannot use the dress for my daughter's wedding. It was very disappointing."
3.0,They are OK - A little thinner than I like.
3.0,"Cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. It's fine for a one or two-wear occasion."
3.0,I will wear it while golfing on particularly hot sunny days
3.0,It feels a little lessened in durable fabric so I tend to wear it less often then I originally bought the band for.
3.0,"I keep forgetting that the shirts from China run smaller and the fabric is like a polyester, it doesnt breath well, it just clings..."
3.0,Sliding clasp makes for easy adjustment - but a bear to get fastened.  A piece of clasp broke off and i'm taking to a watch shop to see if jeweler has a replacement clasp.  I really love the way the watch looks and would fit my small wrist  when clasp fixed
3.0,see through and didn't have a lot of movement
3.0,My 14 month old can still pull her earrings off with these backs. They did last longer than others but not 100% I have to check them multiple times a day
3.0,"It doesn't stiffen very well.  Slight discoloration on light colored hat.  I applied it to the inside, but it bled through."
3.0,Very pretty. Thought it would be more form fitting in the torso as the picture shows.
3.0,"I have super pale skin, so I really need a hat during our hot summers.  I'll admit that I thought this hat was a little bigger than this, but it really is more like a Fedora, in that it has an equal brim that is a little over a normal rim.  It was a little snug on my head, but I looked ridiculous in it--sadly.  Ugh.  My mother will love it, but I need to find a larger brim hat, probably without the bow.<br /><br />For the right person, this would be perfect.  It didn't work for me."
3.0,hmmm.. to large.. and it gets a little bit messy when washed.
3.0,They stretch to fit many sizes and aren't evil latex (I'm allergic to it) but two fingertips came off right away. I have many effective adhesives but it would be a big problem for people who don't.
3.0,Not as over size as I expected
3.0,Cute but the thing i dont likebis how see thru the pants are. They definately need another layer of fabric in order to wear them
3.0,"I’m a size 36D and got a large. I bought these because they were low cost and expected the quality to be kind of low... but the fabric and quality were quite a bit better than I expected. It is comfortable and fits well BUT these are listed as high impact and I would classify them as low impact. I used it during a kickboxing class and it didn’t even stand up to those movements. I could never wear this while running. If you’re looking for a yoga or walking bra, this will work, but for anything with vigorous movements I would not recommend this bra."
3.0,Ok for short time.  Very short.  Poor quality.  Wont stand up to the washer or healthcare.
3.0,Super sticky
3.0,Flimsy for money
3.0,This product runs SMALL.
3.0,I was so excited to get this ring and was so disappointed when it came. I loved the way the silver popped against the black background. My ring however was very faded without much contrast.
3.0,"Beautiful dress but the dress was wayyyy to big and small at the same time . My child is 3ft 2inches tall and 37 pounds, the top fit a little snug but the length was fine. The skirt was wayyyy too long and fit tight on the hips with no room if she grew. It’s a size 24 which is for 4/5 year old which I thought would be good for my child but definitely wouldn’t make it a year."
3.0,It was a gift for someone and they liked it.
3.0,sure.  meets basic expectation.
3.0,"I like the material it's made out of, but the chain and clasp are very cheap quality.  Unfortunately, it's a lobster clasp (which I knew when I got it but had no choice); they are so hard to open far enough to get around the chain; I hate them and don't understand why they are so prevalent.  So I really like the cord, but hate the clasp....  I wouldn't use this for a valuable pendant as I wouldn't trust the clasp or chain either.  That's why I'm giving it a 3 star rating."
3.0,They ripped the first time she wore them.
3.0,They are for my great niece and she is 10yrs old. Said they where okay.
3.0,"i don't want to give it TOO low of a rating, because the bra itself was adorable, the band size fit fine and it's made of a nice material. i'm sure for someone else this works perfectly, but sadly i am not that person.  i read reviews saying the cups were ridiculously small but took a gamble anyway because i loved the print, but they really were tiny. oh well :/"
3.0,they don't look like originals if they are....they look a bit abused.
3.0,Cute top but fits small. Returning
3.0,"It fits me too short, so I have to wear a rash guard on top to avoid flashing people. The skirt part is a nice length."
3.0,"A nice looking sandle, appropriate for a casual summer evening dinning outdoors, or a very short stroll in town. Beyond that it's poor construction and craftsmanship makes me cautious of stressing them with long walks or even anything longer than a very short jog.<br />I don't expect them to last beyond the summer."
3.0,"I love the shape of the dress, but it fits more like a large than an extra Large."
3.0,"Dress is beautiful for the price. I bought a couple sizes up based on the sizing guide (normally I’m a size 8 so I bought a size 12). The dress would not zip past my waist. The sleeves dig into the back of your arms.  Luckily, I do not need it until next Feb. and hope to lose a few more inches. You cannot beat the price though."
3.0,"The scarf, tie, glasses, and tattoos were great but the wand appears to have been spray painted it is very sticky to hold and the paint is coming off on our fingers. It was delivered quickly, but my son is disappointed that the wand is sticky as he is using it for cosplay."
3.0,It’s very pretty and seems like good quality but it runs quite small especially in the chest/armpits. I normally wear a medium and sized up to a large and it was still a bit snug.
3.0,"The last time I ordered, it was a different product which I liked better. They were not available this time."
3.0,Item just as described and very beautiful but the size runs very large that mixed with the weight of it makes it impossible to keep it on your finger sending it back and you might wanna order a size down
3.0,This is such a pretty pattern and I really wanted to love this suit. I ended up having to return because the bust part was too stiff. I couldn’t bend down at all or you could see everything.
3.0,"These are very cute, but the L bar is very short, and therefore it falls out easily. The heart is a bit on the bulkier side so it doesnt lay down daintily on the nose. Cute for occasion but would not recommend for long term wear"
3.0,I believe sizes change by using extenders. Poor fit cup way small.
3.0,Way smaller than i expected!
3.0,The color of the tunic is not accurate as to the picture nor the description. It is certainly not ivory. It is more of a tan color or beige. Ivory is more or less an off-white color. It’s much darker than I thought it would be therefore it will not work for me.
3.0,"Runs a little small, but the quality is pretty good."
3.0,Good watch for the price. Resizing band can be problematic if your not handy with small watch tools.......
3.0,"I love These glasses. They are very comfortable, don’t get caught in my hair, and super cute on. THEY IMMEDIATELY SHATTER INTO PIECES IF THEY FALL FROM LITERALLY ANY FRIGGIN DISTANCE. Like an ass I continue to buy them bc I love Them that much but for $10 a piece I’ve spent well over $150 by now. I still Love them lol but really wish they could be made with a stronger frame."
3.0,"Not the size as expected, but it work great on my friend"
3.0,"The fit was off for some reason. The bust was highly padded while the waist fit perfectly. However, I could not get the dress to zip all the way up, and I'm a petite girl. I would suggest sizing up. I got a size 4 but I should've bought a size 6. I'm probably going to return it."
3.0,"I like the colors of this watchband very much. I like the idea of a stretchy pull-on watchband.<br /><br />However, this watchband does not stretch enough to fit over my hand AND THEN fit my wrist (very skinny wrist). After I get it over my hand, I have the problem of trying to tighten the band while it is on my wrist - not easy.<br /><br />I find myself wearing a silicone band with a regular buckle most often instead of this pretty one."
3.0,"Its a different print of Elsa than advertised, it is very soft and the right size. But my niece would have liked Elsa with the braid like in the photo, thats why I had choice this one. If it would have been the right print than 5stars."
3.0,"I have ordered four pairs of joggers over a 3 month period. They fit as expected, but in the last two pairs I purchased, the stitching by the knee looks like some areas are not stitched well like some of the other areas. I hope they hold up and do not separate by the stitching. I like how they wear, and they are very comfortable."
3.0,"These are cute but not very soft, I have washed them many times but that doesn’t seem to be helping with the softness."
3.0,The pants slide down all the time. The crotch hangs down. I can't stand the crotch hanging.
3.0,"This dress is really pretty, and a great deal for the money. However, if you are tall, or, have a large chest measurement,  this dress will NOT fit like it does on the model. The length of the dress is super cute,but, the very deep V-neckline doesn't leave very much to the imagination, making the dress look like a string bikini with an attached skirt. Great craftsmanship,  strong seams, short midsection for the tall or busty. Might be great for a beach coverup."
3.0,"Looks good from afar but looking closer, its quite wacky and the quality of the band is quite low. At this price point you can get much better quality"
3.0,Super cute but also super tight I wear a size 9 and these are almost uncomfortably small
3.0,Great fit out of the box but too short after just one wash
3.0,"I had ordered a watch then I got a message from the seller that the style I selected was no longer available.  I was given the choice of a refund or a different style.  I chose a different style.  It arrived yesterday and it's lightweight , comfortable and cute but definitely not as cute as the one I had originally ordered.  Also, the ""6"" is upside down on the watch face too so the watch has 2 ""9""s and no ""6"".  I debated returning it but I didn't notice the problem until I had cut off the tags, removed some links to make it fit and activated the battery  so I didn't know if I could still do so.  The link remover was very useful.  The watch is really large- it was even too big for my husband.  I removed 5 links to get it to fit.  So all in all, I am keeping the watch but I am  not real thrilled with it.  At least it didn't cost too much."
3.0,"Comfortable, but targeted more for a slim figure."
3.0,The large size was more like a medium.
3.0,"Was quite disappointed as the quality looks much better in the picture, wouldn't want to wear it without a cardigan or jacket."
3.0,"I isi cute, but the zipper is hard to stay up.  It did not have a hook at the top of zipper. Had to use a safety pen."
3.0,"Cheap but cute<br />Would be better if it was all gold<br />Didn't realize band is silver , bee is gold"
3.0,"Nice bag, love the color, and the feel, but I've had bags before with the short handles, and the long handle?  Can't deal with all those handles ... wish it would have just have the shoulder strap."
3.0,"I absolutely love the look of this bathing suit and the style, but it was just too short. Having read the other reviews that it ran small, I ordered a medium and a large hoping one would fit, but even at 5'4, both were way too short. Such a shame!"
3.0,My second pair and still absolutely stunning ! Unfortunately some crystals had already fallen out and was laying inside the package when recieved or this product would be rated 5 stars
3.0,"This glasses are pretty nice, different colors and they perfectly achieve their purpose, unfortunately some of them were malfunctioning (not working LED)."
3.0,Great for winter robe.
3.0,Rhinestones started falling off within a few days.
3.0,I am 5'4&#34; and 110 pounds and ordered a small but I think I could put two of me inside.  Other than being too big the blouse looks nice.
3.0,Not bad for 5$. Too thin to workout in but perfect for wearing as leggings with LONG shirt.  Got a medium. I'm 5'6&#34; 140lbs athletic.
3.0,Just the style didn't suit me.
3.0,Beautiful dress . The fabric has a nice feel to it. but its a tad bit too thin for my liking  Its a little small for me and I ordered the xxl . My love handles protruded a bit and the fabric didn't really hid them... If your like me with a bit of pooch and love handles this might not be the dress for you.
3.0,Cheaply made and material is just ok
3.0,"Hmmm...it's ok.  It looks better in the picture.  The wrinkles are hard to get out, it's slightly stiff?, more sheer than it seems and I can't keep the sleeves rolled up!  The pattern looks the same."
3.0,"Shirt was cute, but way too small."
3.0,"Great print! The material is a little stiff though. I was hoping it would be a little softer, but after several washings it was still stiff and a little uncomfortable."
3.0,This item helped with headlight glare but not as good as I had hoped.
3.0,"The dress is nice, but I wish the underskirt was a bit shorter. Also, I think the V-neck could have been better with this style. It was too tight in the neck part. I had to return it."
3.0,"Cute earring, very small.  Picture looks bigger, it is hardly an inch."
3.0,Seemed like cheap material
3.0,These socks are made like tube socks so they are a little tighter on the calf than feels comfortable. They are very cute. I can't really comment about durability since I haven't washed them yet.
3.0,"Really like it, but it runs small"
3.0,This handbag has an old vintage finish to the metal and only time will tell if the handles or shoulder chain will break. The purse itself is very well made and the bead pattern gives the purse bling. The small inside pocket was an added bonus to fit a driver license and credit card. My 6 inch cell phone that is thick due to having a rubber protective cover fits in the purse with no problem. Great evening bag.
3.0,Crappy frame lenses popped out the day I got em
3.0,"I purchased these READERS mostly for computer use and over time I will see the difference I suppose...but the hinges were a disappointment, they have very little give to them and the LENSE part of the glasses feels like it could pop out at any time when cleaning them.  These glasses LOOK GOOD on (my face type anyway) but overall I don't see them lasting very long.  They are comfortable."
3.0,Great quality. A little bit of silly advertising as the hat is barely dark as it is bright and grey. Wouldve prefered it a little darker and blacker.
3.0,if your larger at the top go a size up ...no give
3.0,Bought the hat for my husband. Tight on his head. Made more for a woman’s head
3.0,"The warmers are made of pleasant material, and the paw pads are nice and squishy and are very fun to play with without fear of them damaging/falling off. They should fit anyone since they fit my somewhat larger-than-average arms perfectly :3"
3.0,Great color. But it looked terrible on me. I think you need to be tall and skeletal. There is no front closure. It's like a bathrobe. Bummer. Returning.
3.0,This is a great buy . The material is exquisite.i ordered size 14. My usual size is US12. Bust 36ddd.height 5  4. it was a little tight at the bust but verrry long.i just ordered a size 16 in a different colour. It should fit perfectly this time.
3.0,"it's an odd fitting shirt, it has length in the arms but the torso is kind of short, a larger size would have made it more loose fitting which kind of defeats the purpose of a form fitting shirt"
3.0,My daughter broke the Little Paper off within a week and then the handcuffs.
3.0,Also heavier than expected granddaughter lives in SC. She does love the beautiful Belle and the horse. So worth it.
3.0,Good material but the fit was to small
3.0,"I only gave this 3 stars not just because of the sizing issue.  It was't even as big as a smaller size I had of another brand jacket.  But what really got to me, was having the zipper on the left hand side.  While we in the IS are used to our zippers on the right, with women's jackets on the left.  I've come to learn the the left zipper is normal in Europe and Canada.  Sorry, it just didn't work for me.  BUT...it was a really nice, and well made jacket, with a great liner.  I gave it as a Christmas present to someone else....they loved it!"
3.0,My big boy worn the masks did not last after using it couple of times. the mask did not keep its shape and the wire Shift it and i wash it by hand and still collect lint balls.my big boy loved sonic he was sad to see it go.
3.0,"I love the material of the slipper portion..but the sole is uncomfortable to walk around on, and they are slightly too big for my size 5.5 foot."
3.0,Top is very stiff and bra-like.
3.0,Runs small bit cute
3.0,Look better on line then in person..
3.0,"Nice T-shirt, but it’s too wide and not long enough for me. The T-shirt is taglis which I liked, but it’s some generic T-shirt all that was printed was XX large shirt or something to that effect"
3.0,"This ring is ok. I was sent the correct item and size I ordered. It fits true to size. No defects with the ring at all. But….the gold color is a little gaudy and fake looking. It’s really bright gold colored, instead of a soft gold like real gold is colored. Because of the color I don’t think I’ll wear it much. It is heavy, good quality though, it’s really stainless steel, it doesn’t tarnish, nor leave any rashes or green marks on skin. Because of the color I wouldn’t recommend buying it though. Manufacturer of the ring needs to tone down the gold color if it, make it look more realistic, and it would be a perfect ring. Change the color formula of your gold plating."
3.0,the proportion is not accurate
3.0,"This dress fit perfectly and is very flattering. BUT as my husband said…it looks like it was made out of trash bags. I got the black one, so maybe another color might look better? Also, the chemical smell was over powering. I did size up one but i probably could’ve worn my normal size. I ended up returning it."
3.0,This came a bit smaller than I expected. Color was not as vibrant as shown in picture.  But on a whole it's a brooch.
3.0,It's okay... It's pretty big even though I bought an xs.
3.0,"Nice shorts, good material, good fit, looks very nice. Unfortunately all the pictures feature a belt, which was not sent."
3.0,"Good value, great colors but unfortunately no good for me as they are way too small. I am a shoe size 9 and after ten minutes of wear lost the circulation in all my toes."
3.0,The necklace is delicate. The chain broke the first time I wore when I went to straighten it. I didn't yank or pull on it. The earrings are heavy. They started to hurt after wearing them for awhile. The ring is OK.
3.0,Super cute but they run very small! I’m not going to dry them.
3.0,"These were okay- they dogged my glasses very bad and there was no real fix, so I stopped wearing them. Otherwise a good product!"
3.0,"The jacket is very stylish but is quite short in length in both the jacket and sleeves and once washed will shrink even more.  The pictures give an illusion that the jacket will fit a normal height teen, it will not."
3.0,"I have the red one in the same size,  and it didn't fit as thight as this black one did."
3.0,"It was just meh. Fit was too small and had to return. While its ok, it iust doesn't possess the wow factor like I thought the picture portrayed. Its nice enough,  but just not great."
3.0,These capris are a little snug despite buying the plus size. I am a size 12/14. I do however like the thickness of them and material.
3.0,The top part of dress fits awkwardly. Waist is to high. Everything else seems to be great!
3.0,"Fun beautiful girly dress. however small was too small, and medium was too big.I wear a size 4 to a 6 dress size. My measurements are 35-26-37. I am 5 foot 4 in so if you are too, you will need to hem this dress up a fair bit!"
3.0,These are a good price and they look great the first time you wear them. But they are a super itchy fabric and they don't hold up well in the wash - they pile easily. They are definitely not butter soft leggings!!
3.0,Thee  elastic stretched out and made the shirt too loose after only 3 hours of wearing it but the shirt is nice tho
3.0,"Very attractive watch, you will get complimented.<br /><br />However, the back lighting is hit and miss with these units.  After 2 or 3 days the back lit information began to &#34;scramble;&#34; portions began to disappear.  After a week, there was no back lighting at all.  Of course I can tell time by the hands and it seems to stay accurate, however I would have liked the functions for night time use.  Also, I thought the watch was rather heavy, but i'm not really used to wearing watches.  Seems to be a watch you would wear to church or special occasions, not a daily use watch."
3.0,"While the design is nice & the cap is comfortable, just be aware that this cap has NO BUTTONS for a mask to attach to. My fault for not reading the description closely, but it would be nice if they started with that. Masks aren't going away in healthcare, so pleasssssssssseeee, add some buttons"
3.0,"The design is nice, but the rubber band on the buttocks is too loose."
3.0,Nice shoe but much larger than expected.
3.0,I feel like I’m wearing a bed sheet. It’s very see through and unflattering on a full figured woman. It may work on someone with a smaller frame as it definitely adds some curves.
3.0,"Weird fit. The neck is really high and kind of small. The shirt itself is very soft, almost like a foamy texture. It’s comfortable to wear, except that I was trying to pull down the neck constantly. The fit is not long enough to wear with leggings and have it cover my bum, but I am on the taller side."
3.0,"Odd fit, really gaps in the back"
3.0,A little frumpy but cute style
3.0,"Liked the hat, wore out after about 2 months"
3.0,I would have given 5 stars but I ordered this mouse pad because it is sephia toned yet it arrived grey toned.  I kept it anyway but I would have preferred the color that was posted; A BIG DIFFERENCE!<br />Thank you...
3.0,One strap broke after only a few wears but the others have held up well to lots of washings. Fit is true to size. Removable pads make for easy washing. Comfortable enough for all day wear.
3.0,The ear wire quality is not as good as when they come directly from Silver Forest.
3.0,"So far, im not pleased at all with these. They are SO SMALL. It was a pain getting my toddler's foot in there, then it was so tight around his ankle it left indents. According to the size, they were already a size bigger then he wears so.... I guess I'll get maybe two sizes up? They are slippers, they shouldn't dig into his little baby feet that are tiny to begin with. However, they seem to be well made, and he loved them."
3.0,"Was getting this as a gift.  My mistake, I did not realize that Five months of prior year was included in this planner.  Its way too expensive for wasted pages.  Returned to Amazon."
3.0,there really needs to be an in-between size here. I tried both and neither one really works
3.0,They lens are angled strangely so you can look almost directly out the bottom of the sunglasses. If there's a reflection from something on the ground or dashboard in front of you then it can catch you. Maybe they fit different on someone else but that was a problem for me.
3.0,Didn’t fit as expected didn’t look good or flatter just ehhh
3.0,These were a good value. But supposed to be wide calf and they are not. I wouldn’t recommend if you have a very wide calf
3.0,A bit tight getting over my head and a bit hard staying on as a mask during Covid-19.
3.0,dont really like material but price was great.if you usually wear large shirt 3xl  would be better fit cause 4xl was big by armhole but length was great
3.0,This dress isn’t what I expected. The material is a thin cotton ? But not see through. It has pockets but cut on the larger side and a bit frumpy in my opinion. Returning
3.0,"It was okay, but a little bulky for what I needed it for.  It also doesn't open very well to hold bills or change, but I wasn't interested in that anyway.  I am not sure the purpose of the little cat ears.  From the picture I had thought it was a separate area for change, but it is not.  I guess it is just decorative.  I will still use it when I don't want to carry a full wallet, but it doesn't fit my needs for every day use."
3.0,Order for my son .I Love the style but they are too small. . . . . . . .
3.0,Wish it were not just fabric printed but more embroidered
3.0,Top part of dress material is cheap. Does not fit properly up there. Returning. Bottom is cute and comfy feeling though.
3.0,The material wasn’t what I thought but durable.
3.0,"I have purchased this same brand but the footless calf sleeve (nude color) in a size xxl and it fit perfect and comfortable. I decided to purchase this style, in size xxxl because it states it fits a 26in calf. When I opened the item and compared it to my footless sleeve I could tell immediately the sizing was off. I did try to put it on thinking maybe it would stretch but it didn't and it was too small, so I am returning it."
3.0,The fit of this dress was amazing. The only issue was the grey was more of a tan and the crotchet didn’t match the underlay even close... had to return. Maybe it would be on point in a different color.
3.0,Some of these do not bend Easily to attach to earlobe. Some are good. There are a lot to choose from.
3.0,Seems to fit pretty true to their measurements. However I got the black and didnt notice the flap it has. I thought it was just runched I dont care for the flap. Also it's super shiny and looks cheap.
3.0,Decent shows for the price. Not much padding you can basically feel everything your stepping on. They held up for about 2 months before I tossed them
3.0,Be fun to use as a gag
3.0,Ok very lightweight look pretty.
3.0,For the price cant go wrong just made cheap. My experience handle with care or it falls apart. I wont buy again that for sure.
3.0,Seller did not specify if this could be used for Pandora bracelets and the description was misleading.  No return policy 😔
3.0,"It is beautiful, one of the gems has already fallen out, and for being stainless steel, it is turning my daughters wrist green. Hmmm."
3.0,"The pictures are true to the product and the color matches exactly. The reason why I gave this only 3-stars is because of 2 reasons. First, the quality of the nylon was a bit more &#34;mass produced&#34; and more thin than I expected. Secondly, the strap was so long that I had to cut it myself and melt the end of the nylon to keep it from fraying. Not sure if other nylon straps are better/worse, but this is still my everyday watchband nonetheless."
3.0,"This band looks nice, but if you're a guy with arm hair, like myself, this band catches and pulls on it.<br />I would recommend this band for anyone who has little or no arm hair, or likes the feeling of having their hair pulled.<br />I would not recommend this band for hairy individuals because it will pull on hairs."
3.0,Link won't hook
3.0,"I liked the appearance, however the arm hinge broke within a month."
3.0,"I have short legs and most socks of this style I have ordered, I have to fold the top over as they are too long - these ones barely come to the top of my short calf, and therefore kind of cut in at just the wrong spot :("
3.0,Love the band. After just a few days it’s discolored and won’t clean up with anything
3.0,A Zombie necklace not a real hog tooth sniper necklace
3.0,I wasn't happy with the size and color so returned them.
3.0,These are very pretty earrings… Even prettier than in the picture. I gave it only three stars because clasp seems a little flimsy like it’s not going to stay closed.
3.0,"Loved them at first, super pretty but I haven't even had them for a week and two of them have snapped while taking them off. SUPER disappointing."
3.0,"Decent device to convert your SPD road shoes to accept MTB cleats.  The plastic is hard and slippery.  There is NO traction on tile floors or other similar surfaces.  Luckily, my wet weather shoes I use this on has heal traction.  I am going to try to apply some kind of rubberised adhesive to the parts that contact the ground.<br />Note, my intended use for this application is a road wet weather boot on my commuter bike with MTB pedals.  I use MTB pedals because the shoes are nicer to walk in when shopping.<br />This includes the threaded backing plate and all the screws you need to install the adaptor but not the cleat, you will have to use your own cleat screws."
3.0,Order size 2t -3t it runs very big.<br />Needs alterations
3.0,Really nice piece but very delicate
3.0,"Very pretty, but I will have to lose 10 pounds to wear it."
3.0,"I must say for the price these are glasses worth the purchase. I wanted some glasses to wear for work that were decent, polarized and priced to where if I loose them or scratch them it's not a wallet breaker. They fit comfortably and they have a decent polarization to them. I compared them to my $200 Maui Jim's and they have half the polarization. Not bad. I am actually going to order a another pair but a different style. Also look up the company who makes them."
3.0,I liked the look of the bracelet...I ordered 3 and 1 of them had broken leather straps...its only $1.95 so its not worth the time and effort to try and send it back...other then that its ok.
3.0,work decent. I would assume these are for special events rather than all day duty use. multiple parts have started coming undone from about 2 months of use
3.0,"I purchased this with the intention of wearing it with leggings.  I thought it would be slightly more loose fitting and a bit longer.  It is actually rather form fitting and hits right at my hips.  I still like it and have worn it several times.  I got this in size Medium, going by the sizing chart and suggestions by other reviewers.  I normally wear Small tops in Women's sizes and Large in Juniors.  I am about 5'9&#34;, 160 Lbs, and I had a baby in January."
3.0,"I have small hands. I ordered the XL. And they fit well. Good gloves, but not nearly as good as 1980’s Spenco gloves. The color fades on the spandex back very badly."
3.0,The shirt fit well but the material was too thin.
3.0,"The wide brim keeps the rain off the face. The only issue I had was that there is no way to secure the hat in a breeze. As long as it's raining with no wind, the hat is fine. Once a wind starts up, you have to hold on to the hat."
3.0,"They’ ok, but lack in quality."
3.0,"These were good as hosiery, but i could not keep them from sliding down."
3.0,"cute top... very soft and comfy.. but WAAAAYYY too big.  plus, it stretches.  for the price, it wasn't too bad.  I would suggest going a size or two smaller if you're considering purchasing."
3.0,"Wore these for the first time and got a hole in both the heel and by my toes. However, it served its purpose. My shins didn't hurt as much as they normay would."
3.0,This product is ok for the price.  My biggest problem with it is all the layers are sewn together so although the spanks attached stretch you almost have to rip the stitching to get it over the hips.  The layers should be sewn staggered on top of each other instead of all together.
3.0,The material is to thin.
3.0,Not impressed with the material but I’ll see how it feels after a few washes.<br />Colour fade is nice tho.
3.0,"Nice looking, but stiff.  Also, neck is a little too big around."
3.0,I liked design of ring. It’s costume jewelry so I know it’s not high quality. I gave three stars because some of the fake stone wasn’t completely surrounded with the silver border. It’s cute and fun. I bought to go with a turquoise necklace. It’s great for adding a little artsy funk to your outfit.
3.0,"For the price, they work! They’re a thinner material, and I was hoping for the thicker compression type. I’m also shorter so I didn’t like the extra length bunched at the bottom."
3.0,This romper is for my daughter and it does fit her well at 6'0. The material is a little iffy but she is okay with it. I probably should have gotten something cotton or knit. Otherwise its just okay....
3.0,I wanted to like these jeans but they just didn’t fit right. To loose at the waist and too baggy at the ankle.
3.0,Not to fond of the ear loops
3.0,this runs very small
3.0,Muy linda; pero demasiado frágil
3.0,Not as long as I would have liked..
3.0,We ordered this for our daughter for Halloween. She went as a mushroom. The quality was good. Just wish it was had a little poof to it. It laid flat on her head. We had to cut a small hole in it and stuff it with fluff to get it to stick up.
3.0,The shoe is a little smaller than expected. It is tight in the front and I would recommend sizing up.
3.0,"It’s cheap plastic, looks fine. One of the lenses felt off out of nowhere the second day using them. I was able to put it back in but God, really cheap."
3.0,The pannier was okay. The issue I have with this is that it doesn't hold up well when worn.
3.0,The dress is very pretty. A little short. It was sent late and missed the event. I asked for a return and now it’s pending review.
3.0,Smaller than the actual size. Too tight for my son to use them but overall great price and good quality boots.
3.0,These seemed very cheap made. Thin plastic.<br />They look cute but not my style. I gave them to my grand daughter.
3.0,Whoever did the sewing on this shirt needs to take lessons
3.0,I only ordered these for the blue pair and I received too green pair.  Very disappointed.
3.0,"I got this shirt in black to go with this particular skirt. The top has a seam right down the front middle and it had some weird gapping around my armpits. It was made fine, it just didn’t fit me right and I didn’t like the front seam."
3.0,Sent it back because it had writing on it. The pic showed black sweater. Other than that it look fine.
3.0,"Meh - see through, very thin material. Not as flowing as shown. -"
3.0,"I like the fit, comfort & price.  However... I have a pair with a hole in them already"
3.0,"This outfit is okay. Outfit came with 3 fishnet stockings (lol), they were white, not red. My biggest complaint is the top isn't like it is in the picture. Top is navy with red trim, not black with red trim as in the picture,, so it doesn't match the skirt. It kind of reminded me of an airline attendant lol. Honestly, it's ugly. It also seems to be a large, so it doesn't fit me (I'm 5'5&#34; around 110lbs, so on the skinny side). The skirt seems to be a small maybe even an x-small, it fits me and I'm mostly happy with the skirt. The emblem on the skirt isn't on the front, it's on the side, almost at the middle of my hip and you can clearly see the stitching line in the front of the skirt as the pattern wasn't matched up and from what I could read it says &#34;Ertsh Colege&#34; lol. Tie and collar are fine, though collar fabric is flimsy so it doesn't stand up like in photo, tie does say &#34;Police&#34; or &#34;POUCE&#34;, my husband pointed out lol. The G-string isn't wearable really either, it has too much in the crotch area so the fabric puffs out and it's awkward feeling when wearing it. Overall, it's good for the price, only thing I can't wear is the top."
3.0,The material is good but I received the wrong style. There is no zipper but my order was for a zip up hoodie.
3.0,Nice material but smaller than expected
3.0,"Love the color, the flow, the style, the fabric, but the size is way off.  3xl is probably a size 18 at best. Had to give to my daughter, not worth the hassle of returning"
3.0,Very soft and cute just a not best quality
3.0,"I washed it. It lost its rigidity and would not hold my gun up, it just kinda sagged there. I went to use the bathroom at a store and when I unbuckled, my belt was so flimsy that the weight of my gun started to pull it through my  belt loops and almost slid right off onto the floor. Spend more $$ if you truly want a good gun belt."
3.0,Very soft. Fits loosely. Very comfy. Stitching off in areas though. One slit on side is stitched shut and the other is open.
3.0,Cute  and ok quality but size runs small. Order a size up if you are a C-cup. Would recommend it.
3.0,"Super soft material, but the 2xl fits like a large."
3.0,It is super cute but the quality is terrible. My daughter had it for 1 week before the stitching started coming undone.
3.0,"I do not like the extra thin fabric and it is too long on me, but I will figure it out and wear it. I just love the lace on it."
3.0,I would have given this shirt 5 stars but after wearing it once and washing it.  The seam came apart at the shoulder!  Poor quality control!
3.0,The polka dots were pretty big
3.0,Pictures shows that it is stamped Pandora but it is not stamped Pandora. It is only stamped 925. Its more of a clear color rather than a light purple. Butterfly wings were not in sync with each other. Definitely not an authentic Pandora charm.
3.0,"The shoes looks nice, fits a little snugged around the top. The inside memory sole fell apart not even a day later.<br />Not as comfortable as in description.<br />Made my feet hurt more the more I walked.<br />Not too happy with these"
3.0,"I have one complaint about this watch, the strap was listed as Leather but it is tearing apart now and I have to find a replacement for it.  I love the function of the watch and the style but not the STRAP!"
3.0,It looks as though it was starting to change wasn't really package right ...
3.0,"This fit pretty well. However, it was torn throughout the garment when I received it."
3.0,"It is very pretty and long, but I have yet to wear it yet because it came very wrinkled and my iron isn't getting the wrinkles out."
3.0,Runs small but for the price its cute and love the color
3.0,I love the colors and print but the material is not so soft and very thin.
3.0,The top fits perfectly but the bottom was way too small. Luckily I have another bottom that will go with the top.
3.0,For some reason I do not like it as much in person
3.0,Very  thin however the price is nice for real gold; sadly they broke but I found a way to recycle them. :)
3.0,I didn’t like the assembling of the jewelry.
3.0,I thought straight leg would be more narrow through the leg but these feel wider than the boot cut.
3.0,It was okay I liked it but definitely not love. It did the job for pictures but I'm not sure I'll wear it again.
3.0,Not youth sized.
3.0,Purchased these for everyday and hunting.  Lasted maybe and hour before my hands got cold with temps in the 20's and 30's.
3.0,Me quedo bello y me sirvió pero llego incompleto. No trajo la correa.Así que lo devolví
3.0,It's kinda small but cute
3.0,Very nice and little things out  top. But nice style
3.0,"From the picture it looks more sparkly. Also, I either have no idea what a diamond looks like, or there are none on this necklace. Besides false advertising, the necklace is pretty and made my mom light up, so I don't have that much to complain about."
3.0,"Very stylish ( I bought the red ones), however one of the handles came undone before I had a chance to wear the readers for the first time.  I was able to repair it with super glue."
3.0,"Thinner than expected. Looks and feels a bit like gold-plated aluminum, with a stamped texture."
3.0,Very cool sweatshirt but runs really small
3.0,"This was nice, but too long for me. Better for someone with a longer neck. I gave it to a co worker. The stone that was supposed to represent yellow was more of a peach color."
3.0,It was ok but it stretched after washing and never fit right anymore
3.0,Cute designs. Eye opening too small. A little flimsy but good price and you can definitely make it work.
3.0,"I purchased an XS (I’m 5’4, 128lbs, pretty lanky). They’re fabulous for compression and running in very cold, rainy weather. The only con is that they’re extreeeeemely high waisted - like almost touching under my boobs lol. Not into that"
3.0,It did not fit my wallet because it was in the wrong direction for my wallet
3.0,I received a totally different dress than pictured. The dress was cute but not what I ordered.
3.0,Not great but good. The material could be better
3.0,It’s a pretty ring and well made.  I ordered a size 14 and it fits more like a size 12.  Runs small
3.0,"Looks like the picture but it’s SOOOO big. I got a M and it was definitely more of an XL maybe even bigger. And it’s poorly sewn, seems don’t line up anywhere on it."
3.0,"Quality is fine, but the pendant is smaller than expected.  It's a nice piece for younger girls, but I'd choose a larger pendant for an adolescent."
3.0,"I love these earrings--I think they're beautiful! But they are so heavy that they're uncomfortable! So I rarely wear them, and when I do, it isn't for an extended period of time. Such a bummer! If they were lighter weight I would give them 5 stars!"
3.0,They're not the typical nylon-ish workout leggings. I got the smallest size and they're loose around my ankles and too long in general. I'm 5'3. A little disappointed but they're so cute so I will probably keep them. I got the red ombré to pink.
3.0,"I didn't like these ties in reality as much as I liked them as pictured - the material does not seem high quality and there is a shimmery quality that I don't care for.  The price is good, but these are not going to get a lot of use."
3.0,"I did not like the fact that the pants looked as if they had been worn, they had dirt around the waist. There were no cleaning directions on the inside of the items, wrinkled very badly."
3.0,They are too large for my 150 lb woman’s wrist. I couldn’t use these although they looked perfect.
3.0,"I purchased this cardigan to match a pretty floral lace top I have. The color is perfect, not easy to accomplish when trying to match things online as colors are frequently not the same as they appear. However when I received the top it was squashed into a very small plastic bag and was incredibly wrinkled. Otherwise I am happy with this purchase."
3.0,It looks good and fit well. I bought it for someone else. They liked it
3.0,"They're packaged very beautifully. I was really hoping these would help with my post-lasek surgery- night vision problems. They don't seem to help me. Others said they helped them, so maybe they're not the problem."
3.0,"First off, the package arrived and looked greasy and full of grime, so who knows what bin this was being held in but not a good start if you're gifting this. If you wear these silicone rings and are an active person or work in a field that requires lots of hands on work this ring may not be for you. The ring thickness over all is the same as a typical silicone ring, but in reality to get the cool textured look it's actually a very thin inner ring ( yellow ) with a overlay on top to add the texture and appearance..So for a person like me who works outside a lot and does a lot of mechanical work I'd rip through this ring in no time."
3.0,Suit had a hole in the fabric on the day it arrived and it's not long enough for my body. It's meant for short people and doesn't have a great amount of stretch. I'm still using it because it's the only bathing suit that is gym worthy.
3.0,"I liked the fact that 2 pairs came in a pack for the price of one and they are very cute , however they were made hot glued together and they started falling  apart as soon as I unpacked them."
3.0,"feathers everywhere!  This was for a costume party so it was ok, but the rate in which they shed they won't last many uses."
3.0,Its really small but cute
3.0,"One of the necklaces was broken when I took it out of the box and the chain was all tangled up.  Cute jewelry, but poor quality control."
3.0,Packaging was great. It was beautiful but Too small and the gold is too thin. Sorry. I send it back
3.0,"Looks nice, but is not sturdy.  It broke on the first day my daughter wore it."
3.0,"The fabric is a little scratchy, but is lite and mostly comfortable.  Not sure I like the elastic band, while not uncomfortable, it tends to role up."
3.0,"Material felt like plastic, very synthetic, see through/thin and itchy. Has plenty stretch, fits well."
3.0,The arms are really tight and are especially small for the size of the shirt. I would not recommend or purchase again.
3.0,Only problem is the zipper won’t stay up.
3.0,Uneven hemline.
3.0,"The yfstyle Roman Numeral Stainless Steel Ring looked a little more substantial as shown.  Upon receiving this item, the quality of the Ring was not as shown & designed."
3.0,This bag was much smaller than I expected. True to the measurements. The strap looks very long in the picture but it was not long enough on the last notch. Quality is questionable. Buckles has a great antique look to them but felt as if they would break. I sent this bag back.
3.0,"The length and color were accurate.  The fit was okay.  The material was a little thinner than I expected and the pockets stuck out and made the dress look funny.  If you are wearing at home, casual, it's probably fine but that's not what I was looking for."
3.0,I love my earring but you forgot to include 4 backings for 4 earrings? is there a reason why i have two pairs without them?
3.0,"Smelled like mildew, when it arrived. I washed it, that didn’t help. Left it outside for a couple of days, smell is finally out."
3.0,Got the medium and was swimming in it. Size down.
3.0,"Was too skinny for most of the men. Love the color.<br /><br />NirV, Adventure Bible was perfect."
3.0,"Cute print, think material. I washed it maybe twice before I discovered a hole in the shoulder happened. Runs big. Im 140 lbs, 5'1. I ordered a medium but fits like a large."
3.0,Bought it for my husband but it runs so small that I ended up wearing it.
3.0,"I like the product since it keeps the mask off your face, but the smell of the material the bracket is constructed of is very unpleasant. Since I have to wear the mask all day I  take the face bracket out after a few hours."
3.0,"NOT real leather.  I've had the bag for 2 months and already the material has ripped to shreds along the outside zipper.  Real leather would not shred like that.  I am really bummed because versatility wise this bag has been great, but unfortunately now that it is literally falling apart after 2-3 months it is unusable."
3.0,"I’m not one, to leave behind reviews. But, I just had to make one. I’m very disappointed after looking around for weeks, looking for this mask, & reading a lot of mixed reviews about durability, smell, etc.<br /><br />Overall, the mask is strong (I gave it a little squeeze, to be sure). I have yet to open it up, so I can’t be sure if it has a scent. However, the mask isn’t the rubber material so I doubt it would have one.<br /><br />My main complaint, is the lack of paint. It looks like, whoever created this mask, was tired and gave up mid stroke 🤦🏾‍♀️! It’s a shame, I’m going to have to come out of pocket once again, for good quality paint to complete the eyebrows and mustache!<br /><br />Pros: Arrived on time, the mask itself; wasn’t damaged, the box wasn’t damaged, & issue with delivery driver!<br /><br />Cons: the poor coloring of the eyebrows and mustache"
3.0,I can't wear the lizard because his head sticks out way too far. I thought it would lay flat against my skin. The anchor catches on everything and snags my shirts. I love the spider and so does my 2 year old granddaughter.
3.0,"Sigh, I have naturally greasy hair and skin, in short order these glasses retainers got to slippery to work."
3.0,"Almost all of them broke within a week. However, the long bow necklace is still in use"
3.0,"I bought the same umbrella, only it was the cow looking one, and it broke the very day I got it. One of the pins broke and it's a really small pin, too."
3.0,"Size seems small.  Also after single machine wash on gentle cycle, they failed to regain shape."
3.0,"Love the style of this bra.  Reminds me of one I own from Lululemon.  The sizing is a bit off.  I ordered a large and it is VERY tight.  I have only worn it once for a two hours, so I am unsure it if will stretch out over time."
3.0,"Very nice: 8 pairs for 5 bucks! Great for someone who really wants pierced ears, but is just not yet old enough. Springs are temperamental or broken- stuck open or closed. Look and feel like real post earrings- even tried to go through my hole when I tried them on my ear to see if they pinched. Probably won’t last but for the price paid, they will work until we can upgrade to the real deal! Wasn’t happy with packaging- all loose in a tiny box with cotton."
3.0,"Very comfortable, but the color wasn't the color I expected base on the photo from this website."
3.0,My grandson will wear these because he's 2 and doesn't care but the overall quality is poor and in no way deserves a price of $25. I can shop name brand toddler shoes all day for $25 online.
3.0,The band wasn’t very right so the watch just spun around on my wrist.
3.0,Unfortunately I haven’t really grabbed for these to many times since I’ve had them. They’re just not the most flattering or comfy pair that I have.
3.0,still fairly thick...
3.0,"Nice pin, but it needs something on the back to keep the pin upright and not rotate sideways."
3.0,"The material is incredibly thin, and it feels really cheaply made. There's not much shape to it at all, it's just baggy and thin and weird."
3.0,"I like the colors but I don't like the material.  Also after washing, the pants got shorter and smaller."
3.0,It arrived rather quickly. It's a nice case.
3.0,Nice dress but the size was for toddlers and my daughter is 11 years old!
3.0,Loved the backpacks but the largest backpack I had trouble with the straps. I would adjust them to the size I wanted and they would go straight to being the biggest the straps can go. I used this backpack to travel so that was kind of a pain in the butt having to walk through the airport constantly adjusting the straps. I probably won't use it again if I can't figure out how to make them stay smaller...
3.0,"The rip part does not kay well and is itchy on the keg. Also, these run small in the waist."
3.0,"i ordered this based on so many positive reviews.  I love the dress from the front. From the sides and back, it's barely there. I felt naked.  I wish the sides extended just a little further because if it did this dress would be a staple for me, but it wasn't cut in a very flattering way and it made me feel so exposed."
3.0,Definitely on the small side and I ordered the largest one they had. But it's going to make someone else a nice Christmas gift.
3.0,"It is a very nice looking shoes, but if follow on the US size is way off, I think base the Inches measurement would be more accurate."
3.0,I wish this would have had buttons all the way down. The breeze blows the lower part and i always end up wet.
3.0,They were beautiful but returned them. They were a lot smaller then expected.
3.0,Very delicate lace. I put a finger hole thru each one on the first wear. They fit a bit tight but not too tight
3.0,"cute, just too small for the size they listed."
3.0,"I really loved the style of this top, however it slips off my shoulders pretty easily. I feel like I spend a lot of time fussing to keep the wrap feature in place. Also, it's a little long (I'm 5'4&#34;) - I was hoping for more of a tunic, but this fits like a dress."
3.0,"The dress is cute! Fits a little snugly and a lot of buttons! A very prominent ""denim"" smell...definitely need to wash 1st."
3.0,Looked cuter online
3.0,Adorable.  Runs small theough upper torso.
3.0,"Bought to replace my raybans. You get what you pay for - definitely not dark lenses. More grey/silver and way more transparent than I expected. Feel pretty cheap as well. Polarization is okay. Basically, good for the price, but definitely not as a replacement if you're used to brand name quality."
3.0,Really not true to the size whatever size you request up it about 2 sizes .
3.0,Wanted to give it 5 star because the ring itself was beautiful however the ball it came with was bad. I would strongly urge anyone that buys it to check & make sure that the ball screws and stays tight. Mine kept getting loose & i had to keep tightening it that i lost the belly ring after wearing it for one day. Huge loss for me...
3.0,"I love this, I bought it to match earrings purchased through Amazon. But I wore it twice and the tiny screw that holds the clasp fell out. It was cheap so what do you do."
3.0,Material is see-through.
3.0,So I got it and the little baby head wasn’t painted all the way and it was kind of like sketchy but it was all right and the beads were to like bright of a pink I like more of a baby pink and every time I tied it to like my backpack or my binder it would come loose so I just took it off and left it on my counter and I lost it would I buy it again no but it’s not that bad if you really want it 😬😐😶
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 35 hips. Normally this brand’s faux leather clothing runs a size small, so I opted for the size 29. It was a mistake, I should have gone smaller. This skirt definitely fits big. This size is too big for my measurements and you can tell as soon as I move in it. The skirt seems to be well made, it’s stretchy, and feels enough like leather. I wish I would have gotten a size smaller though because I feel like when fitting correctly this is a 5 star skirt. Bummer."
3.0,"Nothing bad to say, just a simple comfy shirt. Light weight. Good for under sweaters."
3.0,"The bracelets seem to be made out of cheap material and when you touch it, it feels cheap. For the price, it is kind of expected that they are made cheaply - but in my opinion, the price should be a little lower for the quality they are made out of. I would not recommend or buy again."
3.0,"The best thing to do is to buy a sterling silver chain and put the heart pendant on that. The chain that comes with the pendant is probably worth 25 cents, if that, and will turn your neck green"
3.0,The shirt is larger than I expected and I got a small. But I will still wear it.
3.0,Nice hat.  I wish they had small.  I am keeping it.
3.0,Quality is as expected. Too plain. Zero cuteness. Will not buy again.
3.0,"If you're looking for a slim, no-frills wallet for your cards, pick this up. I was looking to trim the fat off of my everyday carry since I carry no cash and mostly fill my wallet with pointless cards. This wallet does exactly that. 6 cards in the center with a convenient pull-tab to remove everything, and a card on either side.<br /><br />My only complaint is it's a little fiddly to get one of the outside cards out with the tab in the way.<br /><br />It'll really vice your cards in until it's broken in properly, but that's how all leather works.<br /><br />Update: After 2 months of daily use, the middle compartment has lost some of it's &#34;staying power.&#34; Unless there is a certain number of cards in the middle pocket, they're all liable to fall out. Not a huge hindrance, but it means I have to pay attention to how I'm holding the wallet and how it's seated in my pocket or bag."
3.0,It's nice. I like the back how it look. But the shoulder part will keep lifting. I won't say it's a comfortable cloth at all. The look it's nice. You will need to iron it if u want to look better. What a hassle.
3.0,Fancy for any outfit
3.0,Runs small. Would have gotten a larger size.
3.0,Some of the material is rough and it's uncomfortable.
3.0,Super cute but most of them came broken and unable to wear had to send back
3.0,"I'm somewhat disappointed with the hat. Arrived super fast from TGW. When unboxed I immediately felt how lightweight it is. Then I saw 2 puckers and 2 dents in the brim on each side, presumably from placement of the hat band. Also a dent above the 2 vent holes on one side. Given that the hat retains its shape, guess those issues will never go away. Many of the perforations are not open. Material is punched but still present on the inside, preventing air entry or exit in those areas. Edge of head band, and hat body it attaches to, are visible when wearing. I would have thought a hat of this price would be better constructed. Fit is as expected and, aside from the issues, looks good."
3.0,"It reminded me of a sexy nightgown, not sure how else to describe the material"
3.0,Replacement band that is not as comfortable as the original one.
3.0,"These are adorable t-shirts, but they run very small. Fitted might be the style they are going for, but it also makes them quite short."
3.0,"Great quality sunglasses, love that they are polarised and fit great. These are the perfect size for my 6 year old.<br /><br />Update:<br />After owning for a few weeks, I was cleaning off the smudged lens and one of them popped out. It was easy to pop back in but if my son pressed against the lens with his fingers when wearing, the lens would just as easily pop out again.<br />I'm disappointed with how flimsy it turned out to be."
3.0,"The overall fit is nice but the sleeves run a little short, it has weird proportions in regards to that."
3.0,At first glance the belt seems to be well constructed. The belt is very thick and sturdy. The buckle on the other hand almost seems to be plastic but it is not. The metal does seem cheap though. When The buckle contacts my skin out starts to itch so If you are allergic to cheap metals i would stay away from this belt. The buckle clamps right onto the belt and holds firm. The image on the buckle had great detail and looks great. I received this item at a discount for an honest review
3.0,"They're exactly what I purchased, except they fit me and not my little girl!"
3.0,Bonito pero muy pequeño
3.0,"Not a comfortable fit. Tighter than the pic shows. Regularly I wear a large top. Bought an extra large for the additional room. Still snug in the back. Will keep and use at home, won't buy another."
3.0,"Like the look, fabric, etc, but they run small!  Would not purchase again..."
3.0,It’s to big and to short
3.0,"Unfortunately, not the best material. I ordered another color and loved that one, not this one though!!"
3.0,"They don't feel like flannel at all, nothing soft snuggly about them. Pretty year round pajamas , just not what I thought they would be."
3.0,Plasticy.
3.0,This dress is made with an extremely high neck line. The advertised dress is not like that. Although the fabric and fit of the dress is good
3.0,"The fabric was thin, and ripped easily.  My 9 year old had it rip in the crotch after jumping in the bounce house."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d0292138833f8e61fdba239d3e99b28c]] SO small . Not the right size
3.0,"3 starts because the material is very rough and not flowy like I expected. Also, it's very tight! Rises up my neck and just isn't a comfortable fit. The style though, is as described. I'm a size 14, L/XL, 40DDD and I ordered the XL."
3.0,Delete this item
3.0,"Watch was perfect for the 1st few weeks. Just gotvthis January 3rd, Now it keeps unclasping on its own, it's not stainless still, started turning silver to pink or bronze and it also turned my wrist green."
3.0,The bracelet is nice but it falls off my husbands wrist easily. It needs a better clasp.
3.0,Disappointed. Looks longer in the pic.  Wish it was bigger. I ordered a 2xl and it fits like an extra large
3.0,While it is a good size. The product was shipped soaking wet inside it's sealed bag with a pots of mold forming on it
3.0,"The fit on this blouse was great...but it was missing a second layer.  If it was missing it all around, it might have been okay but there was a second piece of fabric around the neck and not anywhere else.  Just looked very awkward when I put it on."
3.0,"It's very sparkly and beautiful!! I got it for my mom's birthday. She loves it and so did everyone she showed it to when we went out to dinner. She has a BIG problem unfastening it to take it off. I wish there was something we could do to make that easier for her because she lives alone. That's why I only rated this a 3. If she could unfasten it easier, I would have rated this bracelet a 5. Please let me know what we can do to make it easier for her to unfasten."
3.0,The product arrived on time. Just be aware at such a low price the quality of the product may not be that great. The clasp was a slightly different color that the rest of the band. Which is not a big deal but some people might have issue with it.
3.0,"The headband ears were perfect. The tail was really weird, not really even sure how to wear it...and the dogs thought it was a toy."
3.0,Durable yet a bit small
3.0,"I am glad that Zaful was selling on Amazon because on their own website you can't return items that don't fit. I had high hopes for this based on the reviews.  Nice color and the bottom fit nice, but the top was snug and I'm a 34DDD. So I would probably need a large top and medium bottom but it can't be sold that way.  At least I know I'm a medium with this brand for the most part. I will try another style and see if that works!"
3.0,"I saw a deal on this product and thought what the heck, let’s get this. The material is soft but the look is not new, doesn’t look stylish either. I think I’ll use it at home as it’s not a going out skirt."
3.0,The fabric is what I expected it to be. The shirt doesn't fit me as well as I had hoped. If I got a size bigger it would be too big.
3.0,I ordered an xl and my frame on top is a size 16-18. It's pretty big but very comfy. Like a thin sweatshirt.
3.0,too cute but way too small for my needs.
3.0,The emblems start peeling off after a handful of washes
3.0,Pretty rings but the stones have a very unnatural fake color and the inside wording is crooked while you have to look extremely close to see the names.
3.0,It needs to be bigger to hold stones that are larger
3.0,"They're okay. Honestly a bit of a let down. The material used to make the printed/patterned pairs is different to that used to make the solid colored briefs, and the cut is . . . odd. They're big in some places and small in others. I like the patterns, but will likely not purchase again. I'd not recommend, just on the inconsistency in the various sizes contained in a single package of five. Equipo fit better and consistent. Will likely go back."
3.0,Very thin . It has no shape and just sort of flops on my head like a rag. My wife starched it but it did not help it<br />hold a hat shape.
3.0,COLORS NOT AS BRIGHT AS SHOWN...GOOD SEWING
3.0,Did not fit my body type but a cute suit for sure
3.0,Beautiful but very short.
3.0,"Was smaller than expected, but still worked to scare my guests."
3.0,"For $22 they're OK. They're good insurance against losing a pair of $300 glasses, but they aren't high quality glasses."
3.0,"So there are several misleading statements in the listing of this product.  First of all, it is neither Cotton, as the link says, nor is it Polyester, as the listing details say.  It is Rayon and Spandex.  This is a bit disappointing, as rayon shrinks and is very very easy to wrinkle.  As this was purchased for a trip, it falls a bit short of expectations.  The color is pretty close and the cut isn't bad, but the material is very thin and precisely what one would expect from a rayon/spandex blend. If you are looking for something very thin and clingy with a lot of &#34;sproing&#34; to it, this is fine. If you were hoping for a more substantial skirt that could be dressed up or down, this probably isn't for you."
3.0,"Looked great, but when they arrived, they were cheaper in appearance and had scuff marks. I love the tear drop shape of them though."
3.0,"Nice wide elastic band in the waist but it is not is not sewn in, just floating inside the fabric pocket. This causes it to fold over on itself and bunch. The fabric is pretty comfy though. They’re also pretty short on my 5’3” frame so beware to the over 30 crowd. They just became pajama shorts for me."
3.0,Nice looking but they are way to big for my face. They lay on my cheeks so not a good fit for me
3.0,"Love the shirt, but DEF upsize."
3.0,"The body part is cozy.  The arms are a quilted material and look a little funny.  I love the colors.  It runs about a size and a half too small and I wish it was longer.  I am 5&#34;7&#34; and a size 12.  The XL fit, but I wanted it to be really loose fitting and comfy.  I returned it."
3.0,Too bulky not flattering
3.0,"The sweatshirt was fine just too big. Tried to return but it seems the sweatshirt has not been received... so no refund. I sent it back on May 5. My return status says ""Return requested"" and ""the item is on the way back."" Can anyone help me?"
3.0,the shorts it is a little big I think
3.0,"I like the green lantern part, I like the stripes.  What I don't like, is how tall the hat is.  It keeps slipping up my head.  Also not a fan of how flimsy the bill is.  Its just a piece of flimsy cardboard in it.  I was hoping for a more sturdy bill, something I wasn't going to be concerned about bending if I packed it, but now I am."
3.0,I bought this dress in another pattern both were larges one of the patterns was white absolutely love the feel of the material and it looks really good on  but will exchange it for medium. however I bought another pattern in light green in a large as well and it was huge on me and it was too long so I’m returning it. I am 5 foot 11 and weigh 150 pounds hope this helps
3.0,"The fit on this is strange. I’m 5’10, 137lbs and I got it in a large. It’s oddly short and boxy. The fluttery sleeves (which I’m normally into) fall flat. I mean, I’ll keep it bc I’m too lazy to return it. The seam on the neck is on the top of my shoulder. Not the best craftsmanship but for the price you can’t expect caviar.<br /><br />All in all It’ll be fine for wearing around the house."
3.0,"The watch is beautiful and keeps good time, but the clasp is very difficult to work. Once we figured out how to use the adjustable clasp, we couldn't make it work with one hand while putting it on. It was very stiff and took too much strength to snap down enough with one hand to keep it secure. Unfortunately, I am returning it."
3.0,"Loved it. Made well and pretty.,"
3.0,Beautiful but too thin for what I was searching for.
3.0,Just didn't fit me right
3.0,Thick thighs is not it's friend
3.0,A little smaller and thinner than expected but still cute
3.0,Needs a little help. The item slides up and the arm pit hurts since it does not stay in place.
3.0,"I thought I'd wait a while to write a review to get the feel for them. I'm not 'over the moon' for these bras. I got an XXL and although it fits, I'm just not jumping up and down for joy. They definitely feel like a sports bra. I miss the support!!! Being busty, it's hard for me to find something I can agree on. The other thing is I want to wear low cut shirts and these just won't work for that. The padding does come out as well, but I see no point as it slips around everywhere in the bra. I'd rather try to find a padded low cut bra that has support for my DDD size. In the meantime, these unfortunately will have to do."
3.0,"These would be nice summer trousers, but they are too short for me. I usually wear inseam 33-34"". These palazzo pants were slightly lower than the ankle, which I find very unflattering for this style of trousers and impossible to wear with heels.<br /><br />I wish they had a longer version for ladies with long legs."
3.0,"Very pretty color , material light:thin. Def would need a cami under. Gave to<br />My sister to try."
3.0,"Very soft and comfy but it does looooove static. The ""pink"" is not pink at all so the product loses a few stars for an incorrect description. I expected it to be a dark pink or even maroon, but the color I got was closer to a brick red with more of an orange tone to it. It's still cute and I might even consider getting another but next time I won't have any expectations about the colors."
3.0,"I live those but after about 3 months, the knees start to loose their color and fabric changes. It's when u cross your legs the fabric changes at that particular spot. It is very noticeable when you stand. I still wear them but not out like at night or somewhere dressy like I could before during the holidays. It's too noticeable. I tried to exchange them at Nordstrom but they wouldn't take them back without a receipt or tags and I had paid cash for them so I'm SOL. I still wear them but not as often and only casual with long sweater and high boots."
3.0,Did not fit my daughter she is 5' 8' and has a short waist.
3.0,"Cute jewelry, but didn't fit my ear. Very disappointed..."
3.0,i washed the shirt first and that helped make it a little softer
3.0,"My body size is about M+, so I bought L of US scale, but it is too tight and the shoulders width is very narrow - for person who does regular ar light weight exercises like me, it s tooo small and tight!"
3.0,"Their super cute, but too big for my ears."
3.0,"Looks good and is very soft only problem is if you have a bigger head, if you have it wrapped around your head like a sweat band it’s very tight and uncomfortable. But still nice other then that."
3.0,This was even smaller than it appeared. The crossbody fit is great but the interior is too tight so you can’t put and retrieve things inside easily. The many pockets inside for cards being so close together created too much of a hassle.
3.0,"The set is nice, good quality.  All the pieces are well made and this will make a good gift. However the fact that it came in a plastic bag and not in a gift box or velvet jewelry box is a deal breaker. This is meant for a gift and I cannot gift it wrapped in a plastic bag. The hunt is on for a gift box now, sigh! Wish they sent it in a box."
3.0,Nicy formfitting. I love it
3.0,It runs big. More fir guys.It was to large for me
3.0,Way too small for my head and I didn't feel like returning so I gave it to my mom. Fits her great. The quality isn't great but it's a cute hat.
3.0,"Little ones were so delicate they snapped from getting picked up. The little rubber rings were mostly broken, otherwise the larger sizes are good."
3.0,I really love these glasses but am disappointed because they came with a fog on the right lens that cannot be cleaned/wiped away. I want a second pair but am afraid the next one will be this way too. Anyone else have this issue?
3.0,Band is too big for my wrist. Maybe should make different sizes since not everyone is the same
3.0,It was okay. Wallet would be better if top zip. Too easy to drop contents. Also wish purse part would've been a little bigger.  But it looks great and crossbody strap is a plus.
3.0,"Lots of reflection, not as clear as I’d like."
3.0,"I love the jackets. It will keep you warm on chilly days. However, the most disappointing thing is the pockets are too small! I have to force my hand in them and then hold on to the jackets with one hand while I pull the other out. I don’t get that at all! I did confirm it is an adult jacket and not for kids. 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,"I didn't expect a top-quality product for the price; and though they appear very light (material texture) and cheap, they work well. I had one issue with a zipper that split (before packing), but fixed and didn't have any issues while traveling."
3.0,"My grandson loves the belt, but after about a week, the inside lining is peeling."
3.0,"So... Still a cute jumpsuit if you are above average height! The material is more of a rayon, silky situation.  There is stretch and it could be cute if the pant legs were not so ridiculously long even w heels on (which I could just have hemmed) but the other issue was the crotch came up too high.  It was kind of an awkward fit, but again  it will look cute on some body types.  Just not all."
3.0,Runs really large I would have returned it but it cost almost as much as the shirt to ship it back
3.0,Not warm as expected
3.0,Didn't fit me well. The bodice seam is above the breasts which is uncomfortable.
3.0,Cute for a few pics but seams started to fray pretty quickly
3.0,Very bad quality!<br />Before first use!
3.0,Fine.  The fringe ravels too easily.  Color is great!  I get lots of compliments on it.  Beware the fringe.
3.0,"Very pretty dress, but was cut extremely shorr.  I am 5'4 and when I tried the dress on, you could literally see my panties in the front.  Too bad, because its a cute dress."
3.0,This hat might as well be for children. Very small.
3.0,Hat was a little small.
3.0,"Looks great, but didn't hold up the weight...and ripped off in less then  couple of months."
3.0,"Love this, runs small"
3.0,"Cheap, but OK for dog walking & such<br />Not really thick enough for fashion wear"
3.0,This was cute and I could see others liking it so that's why I gave it a 3star.  I returned it because it was too small for my head.
3.0,ok but small
3.0,Very light and noticeable which is what I wanted #excellent for southern california bike riding or n a light rain
3.0,"It's good quality but really small. I am no skinny girl but I am slim enough that in theory, this should've fit but it doesn't."
3.0,Only wore each shirt for a day and the lace around the bottom ripped. One shirt almost all the way around the bottom. Fit decently too
3.0,If you are a 36DD like me it’s not going to have the really good fit. I use this top more for mild support under a t- shirt or a comfy top when I don’t want to use my underwire bra.  I would NEVER wear this top by itself.
3.0,Roomy but only 3 stars because they didn't allow enough room for credit card pockets so disappointing!! How could you go wrong on that? Also main zipper closer is weak does not slide smoothly!
3.0,"Very thin material (see through) and no give to them at all; the waist runs small.  Once you have them on, quite comfortable but if you don't have the size right you won't get them on because there is no give to the material.  The leg panels are literally full width to the waist - if you stand with your feet together and lift the hems from the sides they will go all the way up to the waist eight creating a 1/2 circle.  I like these but they are thin and small."
3.0,I mean it works but its not steady. Always moves and looks ugly cuz its not snug.  At first  I thought I wont be able to use it but after some time ive managed. not the best choice but my boots are safe
3.0,Great for what we used them for.
3.0,It’s just okay. Kind of looks weird on.
3.0,A Little Small But She Looked Great In Them
3.0,"Cheaper quality than what I was looking for, so I returned it. Probably worth the price it is being sold for, but it's definitely not a screaming deal for an awesome product."
3.0,Wished it was longer and came down further on the neck. Had to wear a turtleneck to a costume party bc it didn't come down far enough and looked odd.
3.0,The only thing that bothers me about these glasses is how loose and semi-crooked they are. Maybe if I had a wider head...
3.0,It's pretty small. I orders a size 3/4.. my son is a 2t & small and it was tight.
3.0,The material is not comfortable. There is no stretch.  I went up a size and it doesn't fit the way I'd like it to.
3.0,it was beautiful till it tarnished..<br />1 month of daily wear!
3.0,"works fine, fits fine, but the description when I ordered said it was a pair, not a single."
3.0,"Very comfortable, but got extremely pill-y on the outside after only a few times wearing them. Not as thick as some fleece lined leggings, which isn't bad, just be aware."
3.0,"the items appear larger, but when I received it , it was smaller"
3.0,It looked a bit tighter maybe because of the lighter color than the charcoal ones I have.
3.0,"Super cute necklace. The only downside is its not the most substantial necklace. The material could be a little more sturdy, but you get what you pay for so no real complaints. I'd but it again."
3.0,The posts of both earrings were bent the same way as if they’d never been straight AND the finish was very tarnished and brassy not silver. The only part that looked silver was the back. The stones were very sparkly and the only reason I tried to polish and fix them. Edit: Added back on two more stars because they did polish up fine and I was able to carefully straighten the posts without breaking them; however I should not have had to do that with new earrings. I would not recommend them if you don’t know how to do these things and I may still return them as I don’t trust post I know have been bent not to break
3.0,"very cute style, but the fabric (which *almost* looks like paint) chipped off before I even began wearing them. I only wear my jeans over the boot instead of tucked into the boot because of such significant chipping. Other than that, they're actually pretty comfy, even if just a bit large"
3.0,"The strap is so nice, it even has a shorter one for smaller wrists. I have to return it. It does not work for my childs tick tock watch. It's too small :("
3.0,These are not adjustable. They are to tight and start hurting after a short while.
3.0,Okay but indeed a knock off. I could have spent $10 extra dollars and purchased the Authentic from Nike.
3.0,Glass broke so easily
3.0,I can not honestly rate this product.
3.0,Given as  Gift
3.0,"I brought these traveling packing cubes for my Orlando frorida Vacation. I am only gaving them three stars, because they wern't the size I expected nor were the zippers not the best quality. Otherwise money well spent!"
3.0,They a pretty bracelets.
3.0,Love this bracelet! I've been wearing it on and off for months!
3.0,Works but it’s a lil stiff u get what u pay for but my boyfriend loves it.
3.0,They are okay. My straps kept coming undone though. Not okay when you’re in a covid patients room 🤨
3.0,"I bought beautiful iron rangers in copper rough and tough.  My favorite boots.  After a few months I was told to rub this oil in.  It may condition the leather but be warned your boots will be dark, almost black.  Even after just one application and waiting 3 months with wear they are essentially ruined.  Why buy beautiful light brown leather and then be told to use this product that will ruin that look?  Very disappointed and feel mislead.  Be warned."
3.0,I like this product except for one thing..  the cord is way to fat to fit in the tiny little D clip on the side of my Canon 70D..  so I actually have to attach it to a clip made for full size harness rig I sometimes use..<br /><br />How are other people attaching this to their cameras?
3.0,Sizing was off. Too small. Daughter wore it once n then it shrunk even more when washed. 👎🏼
3.0,I ordered the red with black Thread.. it’s just a plain bright red. No black… I also ordered the grey.. both are totally different from the pictures. I like the extra long ruffled sleeves in the picture... these shirts do not have them.. the  Sleeves are tight fitting & not long‼️
3.0,"When purchasing do your due diligence!  Go the extra mile.  Read carefully, even though the name says Giant,  the 46mm is an Indicator that the watch is small,  if you have an average sized wrist  it will look fine e. But if you have a larger wrist like me. It looks small and kiddish."
3.0,"Horrible fit, too big. Im returning it. I may buy a smaller size, and if the fit is better, ill rework this review. For now, it wasnt up to par"
3.0,Cute but too bulky
3.0,They somehow run small. So I usually stretch them out a little bit before I put them on my son's feet. But they are very adorable. I am thinking about buying another set for my friend's baby shower.
3.0,Latch keeps coming undone every time my wrist bumps my slacks.
3.0,"dress I liked, but there was a small problem. In the seam where the zipper was a hole 😕. I had to give a dress in the studio."
3.0,"They are ok. Comfortable, but by the end of the day they are sliding off of my feet from the sides."
3.0,"Well the description says it's plus size long robe, so I ordered a large which is what I wear when I buy misses. The large on this robe is like wearing a1x or 2x for me. Although it is very pretty I had to return it and reorder another Style."
3.0,"The bracelet arrived looking quite beautiful. It looked great my wrist and the stone represented the birthstone fit my 2 oldest children, but after a week, the stone fell off bracelet (nothing happened to damage it) I found it and put it back on bracelet, and this happened 3 more times until I finally couldn't find where it fell off. As nice as it looks, it's cheaply made as it fell apart within a week of receiving. I wouldn't ever repurchase because I'm pretty sure of just end up with no bracelet again"
3.0,DUST MASKS I GOT AND UNPACK IT WAS MISSING PIECES FOR THE MASK. GOOD THING I HAPPEN TO HAD ANOTHER MASK CLOSE TO THIS ONE WHERE I USE THE OTHER PART TO THIS ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. GUESSING NEXT TIME MAKE SURE ALL THE PIECES ARE INSIDE BEFORE YOU SHIP.
3.0,It was too long but the fitting was good
3.0,"I was excited to get these when they arrived.  But, was unpleasantly surprised to feel how loosely they fit around the nose.  Thin material and a little small."
3.0,"Itchy, tight fitting"
3.0,"For what it was, I expecyed the shirt to be softer, and the shipping was like $10.00 - what I thought was a bargain did not hold up."
3.0,Texture of fabric feels a bit satin-like and had a strange odor.  Will need to be aired-out and laundered well for removing the scent. The sizing seems accurate.
3.0,"(68in 220lbs male) It's way too tight around the mouth region. I HAVE to take off glasses to put on, unlike other gaiters. I literally look like im being born..."
3.0,"You Always Take A Chance With Jumpsuits. This One Is On The Sheer Side So Be Mindful Of Your Undergarments Ladies. Also, Mine Tends To Ride Up In The Front. I Don't Really Know How To Correct That But Maybe Yours Will Not. Overall, It's Very Comfortable."
3.0,"Very, very cute, but snug. Not horribly, but I kept having to pull it down."
3.0,:( I wanted this to work. Ordered the xl but it’s like a medium in real life. I have a 40 inch bust and usually wear a large or xl in American clothes. Usually a 10-12 which is probably like a 5xl in Asia. This is going back. Darn my 5’7 American frame.
3.0,Runs 2x larger
3.0,Great quality but unfortunately fits me way to small normally im a size M-L decided to get an XL just to be safe and it turns out that I’m a XXL I had to give mine away
3.0,I loved this belly button ring but it broke after a few wears. I wish I could have gotten better quality
3.0,I Return The Item Back
3.0,The color was a different shade of pink than advertised. It was ugly and looked as if it was washed with something brown.
3.0,"These shoes were too wide, my son’s foot looks funny. Now after having worn them for a while he can very easily stick his foot in and out without having to undo the Velcro. Of course I try to correct that, and I end up trying to make them tighter for him but the width is not at all what I was expecting for a regular (not-wide) shoe. Attempting to make them tighter gets us nowhere. I don’t think they provide the support the foot needs when running, jumping, etc. The good; They’re still in good condition so that’s indicative that they’re made with sturdy and reliable material."
3.0,Didnt fit right. Biught a bigger size and still didnt fit
3.0,"Decided to try MK for the first time. I was impressed by the quality of the fabric and the pants construction. They look great, very stylish and really built for the outdoors. Unfortunately I did not find a size that was a good fit. I normally wear a 32W34L on regular or slim fit on other brands. The Camber 106 is a Classic fit (same as regular fit on many other brands, which is between their slim fit and relaxed fit). Tried the 32W34L and it had a bulk of loose fabric form around the crotch, while the waist was a little tight for a 32.<br /><br />I did not have any luck with the Camber 104 either (also a classic fit), as they basically have the same fit. I think these pants are worth checking out at a store where you can try them out in different styles and sizes.<br /><br />I also tried the Commuter in 32W34L, which was super tight at the waist and thighs. Tried the 33W34L and it was still very tight on quads and thighs, but bulky and loose at the crotch.<br /><br />I compare these pants to two pairs of Columbia that I recently bought, and while the fabric quality and construction seems better on the MKs, the Columbias have a much better fit for me. For about the same money, I would’ve chosen the MKs if they only fit well."
3.0,The shirt is very cute the pants are cute too but are cheaply made I got my daughter a 5-6 and it was way too small disappointed because it was for a matching outfit for my daughter's first birthday but still really cute just way too small
3.0,"Super fragile, but it's very pretty. Worth what I paid for it, worked for what I wanted."
3.0,"The measurement chart is off, I measured my hand as described and indicated I should wear a medium.  That's not correct, they are a little too small, I needed a large.  Overall quality is good, look more like driving gloves than winter gloves."
3.0,"This was way to tight it fits my 8year old son.. And he has a 5.5 inch wrist I myself have a 8"" wrist this should have been listed as an extra small or small it didnt even have a size on it :( very disappointed was hoping it was going to be stretchy so I got it. It is stretchy when you pull on it but it is a very tight pull and when on your wrist just wants to go down to its 1 & 3/4s"" radius.<br /><br />Easy to install"
3.0,"Bought this dress but could not fit, I gave it to my daughter and it fits her perfectly.<br /><br />This dress looks great, whole the material is not the best, it does give a great fit and is not cheap looking as I have read in some review.<br /><br />My daughter is 5"" 5"" and the dress reaches her knee so the length is good, she weighs 190 the XL fits her snug, so it doesn't seem to run large a some reviewers said.<br /><br />Its a OK purchase in my book"
3.0,Was hoping this bracelet would be alot more shiny. Disappointed
3.0,"Cute but tiny bottoms , couldn’t wear them.<br />Looks exactly like photo."
3.0,I thought they would be comfortable but the elastic is grating
3.0,"Muy lindas y las correas magnéticas son de buen material considerando el precio. Pero no lo recomiendo para uso diario , el case de la pantalla (negro) ya está todo pelado."
3.0,Product does NOT fit true to size
3.0,I've had isotoner gloves before. That's why I'm so disappointed these are irregular or just off. The left glove fits okay- snug - and my hands are small to medium. But the right glove - also snug - a couple of the fingers are twisted so that the grip lands on the side of my fingers not inside palm side.
3.0,Comfortable but not supportive enough. Disappointing
3.0,Did not think it would be as big and as heavy as it was. It is quite bulky for me. Would definetly not recommend for kiddos as they may fall over lol
3.0,"I ordered a size large. I'm a 36D, 9/10 in pants. The bottoms fit perfect, the top however was a bit small! :( No padding or anything in the too either. The material was very cheaply made and very thin as well. Almost too thin to wear as a bathing suit!"
3.0,"These are super cute and very soft, but the rainbow strip is just a piece of ribbon and mine wasn’t attached at all points. I can see so I just fixed it myself cause I wanted them, but if you can’t it might not be worth it."
3.0,If you’re looking for style and maybe not durability this may work for you. Mine were bent pretty quickly after getting them and then broke soon after.
3.0,"My wife is 172 lbs 5'6&#34;normally wears a 8-10 curvy thick thighs, she said its fits loose around the waist and the arms fit loose..also its more red than burgundy as pictured..after all this she still going to re order for she really liked the dress, she thinks the large would fit perfect.."
3.0,The finish at the ends of each seam was very sloppy. Some of the stiches were even loose. I had to catch them with a matching thread and fasten them so they don't run. Other than that it is a nice sweater.
3.0,It's comfortable but definitely for lounging at home only. The width or distance between cups is too narrow. It was as if the bra was attempting to give me a uni-breast. It's probably better for a &#34;firm&#34; nurser.
3.0,"Thin material and really small! I normally border between a medium and large, but read that sizes ran small, so I ordered an extra large...wayyyyyy too small!"
3.0,love the compression and the way they feel around my feet and legs.  I washed them one time and they seem to have shrunk.  They do not stay up on my calves.  Its very annoying to have to constantly pull your socks up.
3.0,"Overall, this body suit is pretty good. The material is nice and feels comfortable, and the embroidery doesn't look cheap . The sizing is way off tho. I am 5'2 130lbs with a small bust and I got a small and it was too big! If you are someone with a bigger chest, this will probably fit better on you. I wish they had an XS because i think an XS would have fit me much better. I may just get it altered because other than the sizing this is beautiful."
3.0,"I was kind of hoping the fabric would be heavier.  it is a this t-shirt.  I am sure there will be a time and place to wear this, but it wasn't quite what I was hooping for.  I am not returning it.  I just have to find the right pants because although it bunches at the bottom, it is not forgiving to where you might bunch at the bottom."
3.0,"The sizing of this product is much smaller than I would have expected.  My son just turned 3, so I thought the sizing would have fit better. Having purchased the Large 3T-4T. It was still a very cute costume and is as pictured. I made the length work by purchasing black socks that went over the legs to appear as if they were not short. My son is 31&#34; from shoulder to feet and the bodysuit is 29&#34; so it was 2&#34; too short. The muscle top was also too short and cut uneven.  It was ok if he didn't move but as soon as he did it would come out of the bodysuit. Luckily for us we live in CA and it was about 93 degrees so we took the muscle top off and only kept it on long enough for pictures."
3.0,Still trying to get this right.  It seems so small for my big neck.  Need to sit down and fool w/ it.
3.0,Okay. For costume jewelry
3.0,"It as expected. Unfortunately, I squeezed my large size into a medium size and didn't get to eat all day! Buy your regular size."
3.0,Nice glasses but the arms were uneven. Seller said that it was normal for it to be that way.
3.0,"Soft and fits nicely, but the image quality isn’t the best and the image is already cracking before I took it out of the bag :("
3.0,Not good quality. But good buy if you’re on a budget.
3.0,Likes- cute and comfortable fit<br />Dislikes- dog and moisture from breath after 10 min of wear.<br />My students could still see my lips but these are not practical for wearing longer than 5-10 minutes.
3.0,"There is a big ugly tag that says CASHMERE, but it is not clear if it is 100%. It is soft and lightweight. but the non-removable tag is a deal-breaker for me."
3.0,"I really like the colors and material, however it's too wide which makes it really puffy, and so I feel like it only works during cold weather.  I'd look silly wearing it with a t-shirt in cool but not cold weather."
3.0,"I ordered based on the measurements, and when I put it on and hold my arms out to the sides, it is a solid 3 inches too wide on either side. In the picture in looks form fitting down to just under the bust before flaring out, that is not the case, it tents out high on the bust and is not so flattering. Based on the overall shape I don't think a smaller size would make a better difference. I doubt it will shrink there's no cotton or rayon, may have to send it back."
3.0,"I bought a medium as suggested, so it fit as expected (x-small). It's a great length and is very warm, considering how light it is. I like that the hood is roomy and the collar zips high for warmth. The zipper is a little scratchy around my face, though. The color (wine) seems to get water marks in the rain. I had to knock a star off for that."
3.0,"The hairpins are cute but ahould be cheaper, the part that you actually pin to you hair is really all and cheap. Its glued with hot glue and comes off easily with pressure of trying to put it on your hair as another reviewer mentioned. It can be glued back on easily. But you have to be careful when putting them on."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but the bust area was too big on me which ill be getting altered, the sleeves felt alittle tight when bending my arms and the material in the sleeves felt itchy."
3.0,Super cute. Some of the screws are crooked but it's not the end of the world. Just don't try and screw them in further they will crack the plastic and break the screw.
3.0,Very soft and warm. I found them to run small. I wear a 9/9.5 shoe and one pair just fit. Good treads. The other pair was much smaller than the other making it uncomfortable to wear. I recommend them but beware of sizing.
3.0,"Received but, they were bent :("
3.0,"I really wanted to like this bra. The straps over the shoulders are comfortable.  The sizing is tricky. I ordered according to their sizing guide and still feel the bottom band is not tight enough. The cups have a removable pad which I like. But the cups are too baggy for a C size cup, so can't wear it with any tshirts. Maybe well endowed women will have more luck. The band is very uncomfortable around my underarms. Also the tag they have in the back is very scratchy.  I do not feel it helps with my posture or back pain. I have worn this & washed it, so no returning it now,"
3.0,"It's OK. I'll keep it, but the sleeves are not 3/4 and they are tight, and it hits mid-calf. With a jacket added, the top and sleeve length will be OK, and with a strappy heeled-sandal the distance between the hemline and floor will be OK. &#34;Otherwise, it's just a good dress to throw on when at home&#34;, says she who is heading into retirement!"
3.0,"I used the ""Cap Washer"" as intended. It performed as advertised, and was adequate for the task. I'm not impressed, but I'm not disappointed. Overall, I'm a satisfied customers."
3.0,Aibt got tii much to match
3.0,"Great looking shirt but too small. Ordered three shirts - two from another vender, fit great - one from this vender, too small. Returned"
3.0,Was not made well .
3.0,It had the “wish app” feel. I think it was cheaply made but good for the price I paid. Does not fit true to size. Smaller than normal sizing.
3.0,Had a hole...
3.0,Super cute and warm! Fits well. Giving three stars because two of the snaps (one by the feet and the one that holds the headpiece on) were broken when I got it. Both the female and male part of the snap was  stuck in one side... this meant I had to tie the bottom of the headpiece on with a rubber band for today’s trunk or treat. I’m hoping to find a better option for actual Halloween night due to this problem.
3.0,I love the fact that it’s not see through at all very nice material. I just feel like the way it comes down on my shoulders is a bit off but it’s something I guess I can grow to love. If you have a mommy pouch get good shape-wear because it will show. Or just stop drinking a week before to kill the bulge
3.0,I bought this five months ago and it is starting to split. I will have to buy a new one. I would buy it again though because it is a good price.
3.0,the suit runs real small. i wish i knew that before purchasing. couldnt wear it and im an extra small and it was too small
3.0,the way the ad was listed it showed 2 at one time and the listing stated Classic Bar and Shield which led me to believe it was 2 when it was only 1.
3.0,Buy a size larger than you would normally wear.  Definitely ok for the price
3.0,"Very thin, was under 1mm definitely, more like .8mm.  Overall dissapointing.  My pendant keeps flipping and it didn't do so with my heavier chain."
3.0,I wouldn't say terrible. Worth 4$. It's not small but also not as large as these reviews make it to appear. I've been wearing mine about 1 wk so far still in one piece.
3.0,"I was disappointed. I ordered in two sizes, Medium and Large, when I would usually wear a Small or Medium. You must have to have the perfect hourglass of the model. It wasn't flattering. The dress was too heavy and both were big in the shoulders and neckline and too fitted in the waist and hips. I had to return both of them."
3.0,Fabric is very thin for cost for 4’t docks.  Kids are happy but they won’t last long.
3.0,Neckline was too low for a short girl. Material felt cheap and faded after one wash. Using it as a swim cover up now instead of a dress.
3.0,"I love the fit and the look, but the quality in which it was put together leaves A LOT to be desired...where the top connects to the skirt the stitching left a small tear (wasn’t initially very noticeable) but of course when it was watched just one time follow instructions, the tear became quite large and I really won’t be able to wear it again which really bums me out :("
3.0,"Little smaller than I thought,, but good gift 🎁,,"
3.0,Bought this watch several times - each had its issues. Disappointed.
3.0,It's flimsy and it turns my wrist blue
3.0,to small of a fit .. should have gotten a larger size
3.0,"Before I got this I was using an old plastic shoe horn. It worked OK but it was plastic so when it broke I decided to get a better one. Well, this one fits the bill. I gave it  3 stars out of 5 only because it's a bit hard to get it to work. Still, it's better than the plastic one."
3.0,"Nice shorts but sizing is way off.  Go up at least one, if not two sizes on these."
3.0,i have no idea how these fit or function. my dog ate them before i could wear them.
3.0,"I assumed the seal would be raised. It was not and looked a little cheap.  They are very hot, so not good to wear in the summer.  I liked that they adjust to your face, they come with a filter and the material is nice!"
3.0,"I would not consider this a blouse, but more a sleeveless tshirt.<br />I didn't like the material, feels and looks cheap. Design is not as pretty as in the product description. The top is more like a boxy and shorter that in the description photos.<br />I think I got confused by the size chart, and maybe that's why is so big on me . But that not change the fact that the top I received is not as pretty as the one in the photos.<br />The only thing I like about this top is the v neck design. Probably if I take in a bit on bot sides, I'll be able to alter to fit my body and actually wear it."
3.0,"Nice material and cute design, but there are seems in odd places."
3.0,"They fit but more like a medium, I like room bc I walk a lot & sweat. They’ll go back. Size up!"
3.0,Way too big on the bottom. No room for breasts. Beautiful dress. Just strange cut when on.
3.0,"kinda floppy, the soles slide to the side and the back."
3.0,Looks nice but the clasp is so hard to take off. I have to use pliers.
3.0,I'm a Captain and use sunglasses that fit over my Prescription glasses .<br />The case is kinda snug for them.<br />Do you make a case a little bit bigger in size? Now I like big plastic zippers.<br />I'm in the salt water everyday the metal ones Corrode fast from the salt in the air . Do you have big plastic zippers for the case?<br />Now if your a land lover this case is great... built well too..
3.0,"Expectations: I purchased this for a Halloween costume. For the price I paid, my expectations were I would have something suitable for a costume but not Halloween store cheesy/cheap. I did not expect a work worthy, quality piece of clothing.<br />Size: L or 10/12 ordered an XXL -  Fit fine through shoulders and arms, which was a relief as my arms are usually a problem spot for me although I have slender shoulders. Was able to button, but barely. Could not wear with anything thicker than a thin camisole underneath.<br />Pros: Cut and style are attractive<br />Cons: The material is very thin and see through not at all the structure and thickness you would expect from a blazer.<br />Final thoughts: Despite the thin, cheap material, and lack of structure, I would order this in the next size up if it were available. For the price and for my purposes (costume), it would have worked."
3.0,"They're okay. The waist might be a little snug so I suggest to order a size up. Other than that, they're nice."
3.0,"I’d like to give it 5 stars but the color is soooooo off. Ordered the dress in army green color and the color is the main reason I ordered it. It came on time, packed well but it’s not army green. It more of the shade of dark jade. It’s still beautiful but I prefer the army green color."
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch that I really wanted to love but after having the watch for only 5 weeks it is not working like it should. I wear it every day but if I don't wind it it just stops working. I was going to return it but time got away from me and the return period has passed. I had a self winding watch many years ago and I was hoping this one would last me several years, I feel it was too much to pay for a watch that is not working properly."
3.0,"I wish i had really considered the dimensions.  Lovely bag, but too small for what i wanted to use it for."
3.0,Purchased this a few months ago and it already broke. Pffft!
3.0,"Light, pretty material. Definitely could've used a 2XL as opposed the large I'd normally wear."
3.0,"I had to send it back for another because it arrived with a large hole in the apex of the bustline seam. We will see how the next one arrives.<br /><br />It's just OK. My husband likes how it looks so I will keep it (the replacement.) It's not the most comfortable. It fits OK in my regular size but is a little tight in the chest and ribs and shows some bulges in the back around my bra line. If I lose 10lbs it probably will fit good.  I would like it better if the seam hit right under the chest instead of a little lower in the ribs. Note I don't have a big chest at all so if you do this will be tight or maybe just squish up a bunch of cleavage, or both. I'm not sure. I don't have any cleavage because I'm old and have kids. It's a cute enough neckline for what i do have, i suppose.<br /><br />I wish it was a little longer in the back. If you have any booty it's going to be short in the back. It's not too short (but note I don't have too much butt either...) but it's too short to function like regular in (meaning any sort of bending flashes everyone so you have to do the uncomfortable squat for EVERYTHING!)  I think I will probably keep it for a dinner out instead of trying to wear it as a daily dress. A little longer in the back would be awesome :(<br /><br />The material is heavy. It's not bad. It's not summery, but not awful. Nice for an evening dress because it's thicker kind of polyester feeling. Doesn't attract dog hair, which is really nice."
3.0,"Loved this keychain (for the week I had it). Unfortunately it came on a cheap ring which I should I’m have swapped out right away...usually my keys stay in my handbag at all times (My car is remote start). However when I had my car washed this past weekend, got my keys back and my keychain is nowhere to be found. Bummed. Replace with a better key ring and you will have better luck I’m sure."
3.0,"Used them for a cold weather ride, super warm and comfortable. Highly visible and worth it."
3.0,A bit short for my taste and the neck is very tight
3.0,I love it but it didn't fit.  I got the pink design with gray sides.  Mine did come with boy shorts.  I already have the green design that does fit correctly and did not come with shorts.
3.0,"Wife: I love these pajamas, I feel they are very soft like a nicer T-Shirt material.  But I saw they were made out of Modal, which is supposed to be more breathable than cotton, which I prefer.  I thought I would give them a try.  I normally get really warm at night, so I was hoping for something to keep me cooler than cotton.  I sweat more than I have with cotton.  I'm normally a warm sleeper, but this was pretty bad.  I really love these, other than that, but that was the purpose of me purchasing these, since I thought they would be better than another man-made material.  I am going to keep them, as they are great for lounging around the house.  I do like the color.  It is a more burgundy red, but more reddish.  At least the set I received were.  I think these would be great for a gift for friends, moms, wives, girlfriends, etc.  I would buy them again as a gift."
3.0,Don’t want to stay on my infant’s feet very well..
3.0,"I was drawn to this item because I wanted a simple, black, warm winter jacket. I liked the look of it online with the pockets and hood. However, when it arrived I was immediately disappointed by the feel of the material and sizing.<br /><br />The exterior material is very durable and waterproof, however it is stiffy and scratchy. This makes it not desirable for everyday wear as I had imagined. It would work great for the coldest and windiest days or for extended outdoor times.<br /><br />I order a Medium and it does not fit well. It is baggy and not flattering overall. The sleeves are wide and short on me (5'9"").<br /><br />Warm jacket, not for me!"
3.0,"These will work well for what they were purchased for but they do not fit as well as I hoped. They are very narrow on the face, fits more like kids glasses"
3.0,"cute and love it, but very runs very small.  i am 5 feet 2 and 149 lbs.  got an xxl and it was still small in the belly/waist area. it fits, just wish it was loser."
3.0,"This was listed as a xxl size. I normally wear an XL but swimsuits are always tight so I figured the xxl would still fit me fine, but this thing is way too small. I was barely able to squeeze myself into it and it was not a flattering look once I did (kind of embarrassed to post the photo). The quality of the material is really good and the print is super cute (it's women swimming) but I sized up and I think even thr 3xl would be too tight on me. I normally wear a 14 size pant. This must be Asian sizing..."
3.0,"I thought at first this would work great, I love the idea.  I think however it is made for people with very petite faces because this is just not giving my husband and I enough space inside the mask, which is why we wanted it, to keep the fabric off our faces.  Maybe a size large would be nice.  Even our teenager ended up taking it out. Great idea though!"
3.0,"A little larger that I was hoping for, I can't use the cubes, but otherwise awesome! There hasn't been any tarnishing, they don't come off, and the gems are sturdy!"
3.0,Somewhat on small size.
3.0,Not to bad tho it needs ear metal support?
3.0,band leave's alot to be desired but watch is nice
3.0,"The description said wine red but is it actually a red red. If I had know that, I would have chosen another color. Pretty cheaply made, especially the Lace part of the sleeves, but also a cheap price . I will keep it for causal wear. Size was correct"
3.0,"Looks pretty and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. However, it doesn't snap into my Charge 2 completely on one side. It still works, but I expected a more secure fit for the price of this bracelet."
3.0,Hits at an odd spot on waist linr and the bottom of the dress the fabric is very thin and see through. Tights or panty hose are recommended.
3.0,Not sam coler in pic !
3.0,"They are pretty,  but very small.  Size was not given in description,  so I judged size by earring in model's ear and it looked bigger than actual size."
3.0,It was ok but kind of cheap looking.  Didn't really look or feel like pebbled leather.  I sent it back.
3.0,"Completely different color green than pictured. I wanted a hunter green shirt, this is more like teal."
3.0,"The fabric was thin. Nothing too terrible, but for the price, I decided to send it back. I did order the correct size though-- 2XL. I'm 5'0&#34;, 210 lbs, size 18/20 in the waist, and a 40D in bras."
3.0,"I have bought two- black and white. They are clearly labeled MEDIUM. This is not one size. It you have larger hips or thighs its a struggle to get these on and off, because the elastic band at the back is thick, but well made. They fit great one you cut out the lining, if you don't need it. The lining  makes the item feel hotter."
3.0,The material is VERY sheer. Does not appear that way in the pictures. May not work for what I bought them for but we'll see.
3.0,It is very cute and looks just like image. It is a little snug around the hip area though.
3.0,"So far I am not allergic to the ring and bracelet. I was told rose gold Can be warn by those allergic to metal and this is a stainless steel frame with rose gold overlay so that helps too. Also, the engraving is stylish and a good reminder of healing journey.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are: 1) the ring is thick- it took a bit to size it right, but even then when my fingers clinch together I feel like the bone in my ring finger is getting hit and It’s a bit painful... and 2) when I sized the bracelet down (again it took some doing) it became somewhat lopsided and I can’t figure out how to make it more even."
3.0,These may be good for windproof but they say waterproof that is not true . Was up and Grayson Highlands Virginia and got soaking wet when I wore these. They are comfortable but they are not waterproof. So if you were looking for something that is totally waterproof this is not it ..as far as wind protection and holding in warmth.  they did well
3.0,"Soft, cute but didn’t like the neck line"
3.0,This sweater is really cute but it’s not very soft on the inside which I’m all about cozy factor and this didn’t have it as much as I thought it would fit well though.
3.0,"Pretty belt and non metal buckle, but the belt material is very stiff"
3.0,"Really pretty, but it does run small"
3.0,It is a bit short for a 6 foot tall person. Not so happy about how the way the groin protector hangs. The shoulder protectors feel like they had not been made for this vest do to how they link togeather.
3.0,"Great packaging. Problem is, the reader section of the lenses is about 1/8 “ high, so you have to pull the glasses up to look at anything."
3.0,"Sweet glasses, but Way too big for my face. I don't know if I missed it, or the ad didn't state it.  These are oversized.  Wide frames for a bigger face. They look good, just didn't fit me."
3.0,I really didn't like the top and returned it. I ordered a M based on reviews (I'm between a M and L) and it was skin tight. The straps didn't seem very comfortable and overall the material was too thin for my taste.
3.0,cute and sexy a little big but okay
3.0,the bottom fit nice but the top was way to big. not sure if you can order separate sizes. I got an XL which fit my bottom but my top I could probably fit a Medium or Large
3.0,Cute item but the holes are too small to use it on most things
3.0,They are smaller than the display shows.
3.0,Dress is cute but scratched my arms up with the material
3.0,"Cute mitten, nice fit...weird smell wont go away..."
3.0,"I was so excited when i opened this. It really is cute.  I have another adar top thats similair but one of the snaps is broken. This top has the option of adjusting the waist so i tried the snaps on the smaller option. As soon as i did, the button broke. Adar, youve got a lot going for you, but these buttons have to go. They suck!  Im going to wear this top today and i still want you to send me a new one. This is the 3rd button of yours that ive had to wear in this state. Why dont you charge 5 more dollars and get some that dont fall apart? Grrrr."
3.0,"Really cute, but really over sized. I normally wear a medium and bought a medium. Really boxy and long"
3.0,"A grain of salt for this review: I’m in my 20s and live in a cold climate. I’m 5’2” and 110-115lbs (more around 112-115 right now). I was looking for something moderately cute to wear under clothing.<br /><br />If you don’t care how this looks under your clothes, this would be great. The fleece lining is great and the quality overall is okay (the stitching seemed a bit off in some places, but it could have been because I have a 32DD bust, which is large for my size and can make some clothes sit funny on my chest). I’m pretty picky about quality though. I tend to buy very nice clothes and expect them to be pretty perfect. I’m sure others would say it was good quality. The fabric is decent, I just didn’t love the stitching or the lace. The lace isn’t the best quality, and doesn’t sit flat, it kind of droops away from the body around the sleeves. It’s not as bad around the chest.<br /><br />It’s hard to find fleece lined camisoles with thin straps and these are workable - they won’t be seen under short sleeve or even some sleeveless/tank top shirts. The neckline is low enough to not be seen under blouses and shirts - HUGE bonus points. The shelf across the bottom stretched large enough for my chest, though would fit smaller busts as well.<br /><br />I have two long-sleeves of very similar material. The outer layer washes differently than the fleece lining, so they kind of shift over each other in the wash. This was really off-putting to me at first, but once you put them on they stretch to fit and work just fine! That said, they are very much undershirts to me and I got them tight so they would sit flat under my clothes.<br /><br />It fit pretty well - I am 112-115lbs and 5’2”. I ordered a medium. I have comparatively long legs for my height. The top was slightly longer than I’d like, but nothing crazy. It’d work on a longer or shorter torso just fine. It wasn’t completely skin tight, but as I said, I like my undershirts very tight so my blouses, etc glide over them well. Aka no wrinkling or anything like that. This top had some wrinkling but it could have been the length.<br /><br />The color isn’t pretty, and the padded insert makes it horribly unflattering, but it’s removable. It’s not the best, but it’s better quality than everything else I ordered. I considered keeping it but am going to try moving on to non-prime options. If you don’t care about the color, this is a great option. It’s definitely a mauve color which might work great for some. The lining is a dark gray. Would be nice and warm for winter, early spring, or fall."
3.0,"This shoe looks good and the material is certainly of high quality. But it is very wide, even wide feet may swim around, and there is no arch support either. The outer sole does not have enough traction on uneven terrain so it's not really an outdoorsy kind of shoe. I expected a bit more from the Timberland brand."
3.0,"This is a nice strap. But if you have a 16mm watch, chances are you have a pretty small wrist. I am 5'8 and 150- 155 pounds, this strap will go around my wrist 2x. Other wise it's nice."
3.0,Little bigger then I'd like for a hat. But it did what it needed to do while on vacation
3.0,"These are nice knit, but the bands to hold them up are thick and WAY too tight ... might work well for some very skinny legs, but for a normal person they would eliminate circulation in the limb."
3.0,When I purchased this item I could not tell from the picture that the sleeve at the shoulder is poofy. That look in my opinion made this sweater look too &#34;junior&#34; for me. The sweater was very soft and did seem to be good quality. I ultimately returned this sweater due to the unflattering sleeve.
3.0,Fits tiny wrist I’m a nurse so the side silver band keep pressing side button that can alert police so I can’t wear it to work it’s more of a party band
3.0,"These are cute and all but they don't look like they'll last. It is a good value for the price, but keep in mind that you'll be able to wear these once or twice each, if lucky.<br /><br />Anyhow, I do like the variety! Would make a nice small detail gift!"
3.0,"LOVE THE STYLE AND COLOR BUT NOT VERY WELL MADE. I'D STILL RECOMMEND BUYING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORN EVERY DAY. IN FACT I PURCHASED IT IN PURPLE, FUSCHIA, YELLOW, BROWN AND RED AND REALLY DO LOVE THE COLORS. I DIDN'T ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE COLOR BECAUSE AMAZON HAS SO MANY MORE TO CHOOSE FROM."
3.0,"Nice, but bulky & heavy."
3.0,😟😟😟
3.0,Not a nice fit at all /:
3.0,"SO huge, but nice.  Ended up using on the couch and the plaid was a nice winter touch"
3.0,Super cute but the color faded after 1 wear and the top is too big. I have 38DDD so I wasn't expecting that.
3.0,I ended up giving it as a gift considering I ordered large
3.0,"THEY'RE BIG NOT LITTLE, CAN'T WHERE MULTIPLE WITH THESE."
3.0,"Stunning piece of jewelry, there's a lot of detail for such a small piece. The only issue is that it tends to pinch a bit when the charm moves around, and will grab hold of jeans when you stand up after sitting for a while. Still worth it, though, because it looks so great and is really high quality."
3.0,"Did not fit my Jetta 2014 - Rear camera is mounted just above - had to install without the frame ..<br />also<br />Make sure you read .. its a single plate , I live in NJ we need 2 plates , i didn't read and only ordered the single :("
3.0,I bought this for my father-in-law who has a cap from the same company. I purchased the same size as the other cap he has and it when it came in it was smaller than his other cap.
3.0,As soon as we got this scarf it pills up. It fell apart pretty quick.
3.0,Despinta cuando te cae agua
3.0,Chain is a little short.
3.0,this is kinda cute but extremely thin ( cheap ) material. the white is def see through so you have to wear a slip underneath
3.0,Shirt fits well to size. My only complaint is that the neck hole is a bit tight.
3.0,Purchased as a gift for someone else. Loved the pockets and fit well.
3.0,It was kind of big and eye holes were hard to see through so we cut them out a little more. It was good for a Halloween mask.
3.0,"Shorter than I had expected and fairly sheer, because of how short it is there would be difficulty finding a slip that would help with the sheerness."
3.0,I used these for a Halloween costume. Soft and comfortable but have a blue tint to them in the white part. Worked great for my purpose though.
3.0,"Ehhhhhhhh. This skirt is a mixed bag. I love the idea of it, and it was full as pictured but it was too short. I am only 5'4'' and the small came up two inches short when worn high waisted. The waist band barely fit as in it was almost to big...I will have to belt it to truly make it fit my waist. Some other people have suggested ordering a bigger size to fix the length issue but I was worried about the waist being even bigger. Still unsure about if they only difference between the sizes is indeed the length."
3.0,Way too short and tight across chest
3.0,These were too big and even heating them up and boiling them didn't help mold the plastic at all. They are a fun cheap favor but are useless if you want to use them for vampire teeth for a costume.
3.0,"Shorter than expected, see through.<br />I was hoping for something longer and not super holy!  I have to wear an undershirt.  I am short,  5'3, so I am not used to having a clothing too short issue."
3.0,Really nice and soft shirt but it runs too big. I ordered a Medium and it looked like a Large
3.0,"To heavy for summer for me.  I'm sorry but I need until Monday, June 10, 2019 to return.  I got it and tried it on only.  I had 2 emergencies come up the same day and had to rush over 400 miles.  One for a gallbladder that had gangrene.  The other had gone into sepsis.  They told me she was just hours away from dying.<br />I don't normally mail something back passed the deadline but as you see I have been a little preoccupied."
3.0,"The front V hangs a little long, but i'm only 5'2&#34;."
3.0,"Runs large - was hoping for a nice, snug fit to keep my feet warm while lounging and offering a little support (because of the soles) while<br />cleaning/cooking, etc.  They run large in length and width.  There is a nice foam layer which should offer the ultimate in comfort, yet my feet wobble side to side when walking.  I really wanted fall in love with these slippers but I'm not sure even ordering a size smaller would meet my expectations.  I would have ret'd and ordered a smaller size to try but I threw out the packaging/tags too soon and didn't want to be bothered with trying to return.<br />I keep them by my couch and just wear for &#34;warmth&#34; while watching tv"
3.0,I like the extra compression of my clothing providing a tighter fit. These did not and they were not long enough.
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34; with average size calves (120 lbs) and I am pulling them up all day. They don't go to my knee. Also, the ones with white background turned gray after a few washings and that is using hot water and washing only with whites. Otherwise, the level of compression is good."
3.0,"Fine for everyday use. Note, these are not 100% cotton socks. It's a cotton/synthetic blend.<br />Do not use them where 100% cotton socks required. It won't work."
3.0,Too flimsy material and a little large.
3.0,Won't but again. Size is just too small.
3.0,I love the necklace but the length it's  too short.
3.0,"I love the colors and pattern, I bought the grey and white. It is very very very high waisted on me. I am 5’4” and it hits just under my chest.... I usually like a high waist but not that high. Lol"
3.0,"This t-shirt is a little firm and not very stretchy at first but after a wash and a while of wearing it it's starting to break in.<br />It does run a bit snug even if I got my usual size. I really shouldn't have to break a t-shirt in and it should be soft and comfortable, that's why I'm not giving it a higher rating. It is a nice color and it does look nice but it's not very soft and stretchy like a good t-shirt should be. For the price it's not bad. It's a good value."
3.0,"Tight in the shoulders and belly, but large in the length! Fit so badly! I thought about getting it tailored but didn’t have time!"
3.0,"I would rate this purchase...less than gratifying.  First of all, it took more than 3 weeks for the Earrings to arrive.<br />Next was the quality of the product, &#34;acceptable&#34; quite feminine, but not a good value for the price.<br />I would not go thru the gut wrenching problems of returning these sets, but I for sure am not buying<br />any more jewelry for awhile as I feel I am not a knowledgeable buyer.  Once stung....yadda yadda yadda....."
3.0,Cheap wig. But fine for a simple costume party.
3.0,"Purchased for my 11 year old son. The eye stitching broke after one month. Other than that, the hat is good thick quality."
3.0,These gauges are super cute. The size is a bit off tho it’s just a stretch too big to be 11 mm
3.0,"I had problems getting the fabric up over my nose, it kept getting bunched up and caught at the neck line.<br />I use it anyway but a bit disappointed that I can't use it with out the nose cover up."
3.0,Some unraveling on the design.
3.0,"It’s well made so I’m keeping it, but the feathers are not what shows in the picture-they’re only about 3 inches long. Disappointing and that should be noted in the description. They definitely don’t stick out past the hat like shown"
3.0,Esta bonito pero el material no era lo que esperaba aparte muy pequeno
3.0,It was nice just really small. It's for someone under 14.
3.0,no a big fan is to short
3.0,"If you order one size up you will be pleased.  Reason for the 3 stars:  My son was very disappointed to find them too small in his size, as he absolutely loved them.  And even more disappointed to find out they do not have the next size up.  And mom was disappointed with the misrepresentation on Amazon of &#34;Free Returns&#34; which was untrue.  We had to pay 10 bucks to return these.  What a bad taste that leaves behind; Amazon did not represent the return policy correctly and now we have to pay the price.  This does not make a loyal customer like myself wish to use Amazon in the future.<br /><br />4/15/16 update:  Under Armour contacted me and will be refunding the return shipping cost. So I am a happier camper now.  They have removed the &#34;Free Returns&#34; tag from the product page, I see."
3.0,"Style is nice, but a little too sheer."
3.0,A little big and seams coming apart just from washing before wearing
3.0,"To soft of a material but, comfortable around the house."
3.0,I had to return the watch bands. They were to large for my watch and I could not get the band on.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this set, but the top fit weird.  The elastic in the back in the top was also odd.  Sadly I returned."
3.0,"The stones were not washed out, as sometimes happens with this kind of product, but the size of the ring is ridiculous! I couldn't close my fingers when wearing it, and it sticks out so far from my hand I was worried about snagging my clothing."
3.0,"So, where to begin. The design is absolutely beautiful. How ever. The shirt is very short, it looks cropped almost, secondly the fabric is very very thin and cheap. It would make a good summer shirt but it is not an “oversized tshirt” style."
3.0,"Product fit well, but the lenses were blurry. I don’t think the prescription in lenses in correct."
3.0,Really cute.  I just wish there weren't so large.  But I do love polka dots.  My adviice to the the seller is to put the glasses on a model so people can see how large they are
3.0,"Great craftsmanship and materials but two things bring it down for me.<br /><br />1. The second clasp is a little too loose and the third is a little too tight so I cannot wear it. So it either falls off or strangles.<br /><br />2. It really is a pain to put on. Took me about a half hour the first time I got it on and I had to take a few breaks to shake out the hand cramps along the way.<br /><br />That being said, it felt great the brief amount of time it was on. It was comfortable and the weight was great (lowest weight). It’s really a bummer I can’t use it or that they have an option for shifted clasps."
3.0,"Very cute but faded alot after washing , even in cold with darks.."
3.0,Dislike the fact that the pads are not secured and they fall out while being washed.
3.0,Most of them fit but they run small
3.0,A little too big in the bottom.  Top fit good.
3.0,"They work, but they don’t work. These are good in a pinch, but they’re not a long term solution! There’s a lot of glare, and they’re very flimsy! When I bought them the ad said “polarized”… I really doubt that"
3.0,Buttons are not tailored for proper spacing
3.0,"I like them, however the color scheme is the same one every pair so it is difficult to find outfits to wear with them. Some are also heavy for my ears."
3.0,Runs a little small and material is very thin
3.0,I am a small person and this was just not meant for me.
3.0,More pink than red.
3.0,"My son loved this bracelet when he got it for Christmas, but just like everyone has seemed to comment in their review the chain broke almost immediately. Now I have to go find a new chain for it at a craft store, which is so irritating. So count on that. Otherwise this could be a great product."
3.0,Originally bought this for my husband but it wouldn't even go over his wrist so I wear it. It does not have any elastic as I thought it would.
3.0,I only had the band a week or 2 before I noticed that the black paint started to were off and the silver underneath started to show through
3.0,Brike easily but its was nice
3.0,The slipper feels comfortable but it feels like my foot cant go in deep enough.... it doesn't come up high enough by the back of my heel besides that it feels good
3.0,Sleeves are not full length I wish I knew before I bought.
3.0,It is only too large because I overestimated my size! Well-made and cute.
3.0,"I love the clarity of the view, but I should have measured my head. They hurt my ears a bit because the frames are too wide."
3.0,"Holes in every pocket,  poorly stitched"
3.0,They were broken at the bottom on both sides
3.0,"I nearly gave this a fourth star, but then I remembered that part of why I knew this product would work well for me was that I do pointedly read reviews and, in this case, the bad reviews were quite helpful and encouraging. Many people find these to be too small. Since I have narrow feet and high arches and tend to lace my shoes tightly, I knew these would work well for me. They do.<br /><br />But if you don't like a tight fit to your shoes, belive me, they will not, which is a shame. I bought the kind for regular tennis shoes because I was tired of the silicone kind's lose fit and the ends pulling out (and eventually one broke) and these are very well made. For those who do find these to be too tight, since these are fabric they should loosen up in time, but I definitely understand why anyone would not wish to wait so long. Even when yo do order the size that coordinates with your shoe size (I fit snuggly in the middle of the size range for mine), these do have quite a tight fit. Even I would not want them to be even slightly tighter, and I /like/ a tight fit."
3.0,I got a large in this and it fit like a small. The material is also very heavy.
3.0,"I got to say first of all, service was great and I received the watch in the expected time, however I don't think the photos do honor to the  color it really is, the real thing was a bit of tone towards the rose, and the leather strap felt cheap, as for the watch itself it has some nice weight to it and the glass is massive it really looks like a high end watch, it looks however a bit too flashy for what I was expecting.<br />If you like a big heavy nice looking watch and don't mind about it being flashy and replacing the belt at some point, then I would say definitely go for it."
3.0,Scratched on but no time to return it since it was a gift.  I am going to see about engraving something on it to cover the scratch which means I will be spending more money on this gift than anticipated.
3.0,When I first received these pjs I was instantly in love with them! Very cute and fit just right but after a few washes the cow on the tank top was basically gone despite how careful and thoroughly I followed directions on how to wash them :( the bottoms however still fit nicely and look the same as when I first got them.
3.0,"Cute, but not really slouchy & not very warm."
3.0,become larger after first use
3.0,"Much smaller than expected, my bad for not realizing it but the photos were deceiving in my opinion."
3.0,"The diamond one and the opal one are very hard to open once in your nose, I kinda hurt myself trying to take the diamond one out. The braided one is perfect. I will say they are all great quality and very beautiful just wish they weren't impossible to open once in your nose."
3.0,"Took way too long to arrive. The elastic is flimsy, and I'm waiting for it to break."
3.0,Legs are too short.<br />Crouch is at your knees.<br />Not cotton.<br />Not breathable.<br />Zipper is too short.<br />And what’s with the bag shaped head?
3.0,Way too small. We only kept them because my 14 year old granddaughter wanted them.
3.0,"My son loved this watch and I like the price.  Although he is a very active boy and came to me 1 1/2 months after we bought it with a broken band.  I looked it over and saw that he had just pulled the band/strap off the watch and the pin was still there.  I told him, no problem mine does this every now and then.  So I got a little screwdriver and put it back on.  Well, it didn't last another 10 mins.  After further inspection, I noticed the case was made of hard plastic and not stainless steel like mine.  The hole that pin goes in had wallered out on one side and it couldn't hold the strap on.  Oh well, it was only $5.00.  I splurged and bought him another brand for $13.00 here on Amazon that has a stainless case."
3.0,"Bought as part of a Halloween costume.  The sleeves were SOOOOO tight.  I bought the next size up for my older daughter and those sleeves were no where near as tight.  Just something to think about when you purchase. Otherwise, quality of material was great."
3.0,I like the outfit pants are just to big in the front
3.0,The strap was damaged when I received it! I didn't have time to send it back for a new one!
3.0,Wanted to love it but weird seaming right in the front was not flattering.
3.0,The top is great but the bottom's strings ripped out on second use. I had to re-sew them back on by hand.
3.0,"This hat is incredibly cute, but it needs to be stretched out to be functional, and would not be good for winter use, as the material is quite thin."
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I wear and the shorts are still tight in the legs. Other than that I think they will be okay.
3.0,Very pretty. Hard to get over my large hand. Fits fine when it's on.
3.0,"I was disappointed by these gloves when I tried them on and rode my bike for 27 minutes under 10 degrees weather and of course, counting the windshield that comes along riding a bike; my hands got cold under the 10 minutes that I was out there and I was really hoping to still feel my hands once I got to my destination."
3.0,They’re very thin
3.0,"The picture indicated that there was a carbon filter in the mask. There is no filter in this mask nor is there a pocket to put one. I don't think that a regular dust mask is worth a full $20. This is false advertisement. I’m updating my review because even though there is no filter pocket as described, my son loves this mask and wears it everyday as his first choice."
3.0,"Rings are larger than in the pictures. Definitely check the measurements. It is still cute though. My main issue was with the scratchy chocker material. I have returned the item, but if you are okay with large rings and are not overly sensitive to material this makes a great necklace for the price!"
3.0,I love the pattern but these are entirely too short for me...Might just make it into a skirt because I love this pattern.
3.0,"I've purchased and worn Birkenstocks for years and love them! However, I'm having a problem with the divider on the right shoe hurting my toes. This may not be a fault of the shoe but rather a change in my anatomy as I have arthritis in my feet.  These are so pretty, my favorite color...turquoise...and I wish I could acclimate to them as well as I have other Birkenstocks I've purchased. I think whoever purchases these will be happy with them if they don't have my foot problem."
3.0,looks nice but it doesn't work
3.0,"Nice fabric, sizing is off"
3.0,"They were a good heft and nicely made, but you do have to dead stretch with them when you want to wear them."
3.0,I ordered this for a gift so I'm glad that I received it thank you very much..I'm sure she will like it
3.0,It look gorgeous..
3.0,"This jacket came quickly and it is okay for a lightweight emergency. The material is extremely thin and the hardware isn't very high quality. When I put on the jacket and zipped it up, the zipper immediately got stuck.  I did like how the bottom has an adjustable cinch and the ends of the sleeves are cinchable as well.  The jacket also came with a nice little pouch that the jacket fits easily into to make it easy to carry. I plan to keep this jacket in my car so I can easily grab it if needed."
3.0,"It looked a little too off white, more off burlap color"
3.0,Returned the first one because it was too tight. Had to also return the second one because even though a bigger size it was too tight on my neck. Felt like it was choking me. Had to return both.
3.0,"I really wanted this to work, but I ordered the wrong size (buyer beware) and decided not to return it for the correct size.  That's on me, yes."
3.0,"Update!<br />These didn’t last too long, shrunk to the point they were hurting my toes."
3.0,Elastic is black not good for big hips
3.0,"I bought this costume for my (tall) 4 y/o. He wears clothes size 6-7. I ordered a size 150 but a 130 or 140 would have been better. The baseball cap arrived dirty. It has velcro and fits well. The green gloves can't be used. They are deformed, the fingers are too long and skinny, not sewed well. The jacket has small pockets. I was expecting something of a better quality for the price but should be good enough for Halloween."
3.0,"Love the colors.  However, the shorts fit snug. Before I knew they fit snug my granddaughter already wore a pair for 2 hours so now I can't even exchange them."
3.0,"Very cute rings, but don't with stand day to day wear in the medical field. Lasted about a month of wearing it and fell off mid day wearing it."
3.0,"Fabric holds heat against body, so I wouldn't work out in these unless I was looking for a rash."
3.0,"It fits a little tighter on my legs than I wanted it to and than I thought it would. Overall, it fits but it’s doesn’t look as comfy/cute as I wanted it to. I’ve been looking for a black jumpsuit for awhile so I’ll keep it and probably just wear it around the house. The material also is not very soft."
3.0,Not suitable for chunky legs
3.0,"Good silky material.. washes fine and no crinkles.. however the pants run short .. i am 5'4"" and bought M.. although shirt i sloose and long, the pants dont tocuh my ankles!"
3.0,"Looked nice, but wouldn't connect properly to my watch and kept disconnecting. And yes, I ordered the right band"
3.0,I ordered a larger size to compensate for my larger arms it's still a little tight but I'll be able to wear with a tank underneath and get the look that I want
3.0,It’s for a wedding but it’s too big and I am having a hard time returning it with the label you sent
3.0,It's really pretty but I think it's too big to actually wear!
3.0,The fabric is no longer a nice sweatshirt quality material. It is a lightweight flimsy version that wouldn’t keep you warm on a beach in Southern California.<br />Very disappointed in quality. Will be sending to sister who still lives in So Cal but lives in the city where it’s warmer.
3.0,the font is TINY. Can hardly see it.
3.0,"I can only give this three stars. It is a pretty cover-up but it isn't like the picture in my opinion. The sleeves are too long and are cut extremely tight. The cover up itself, although I ordered the largest size , which should have fit based on the measurements given , was really sized smaller. I personally am unable to comfortably wear this cover-up but my 8 yr old daughter wears it and likes it. The picture makes the cover up appear sexy but in my opinion it really isn't. The cover up is see through lace with a pretty floral design. If you are looking for a simple cover-up I would recommend this but please be aware that it is made alot smaller than expected. It's atleast two sizes smaller.<br />I received this item free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and Unbiased review. All opinions are 100 % my own."
3.0,Ordered two. One did not work out of the box. Returned and ordered second one. Would be nice to be able to use refund from bad one to pay for replacement but they do not allow that. Second one worked.  Used pennies instead of plastic tokens for a school carnival game - pennies marked 1-2-3-4-5 based on prize they could win. worked great.
3.0,Love the dress but the sleeves are too tight. evI ordered an XL in 150lbs
3.0,Fits as  expected however material is very slippery and thick.  I prefer less shine in my pants.  Not worth the price but keeping.
3.0,Order a size larger than your normal shoe size. I barely could fit my toes in this shoe even with them curled up.
3.0,This is not a smoothing garment. Just keep that in mind making a decision.  It will hold you in...  but there will be bunching.<br /><br />Please give this review a helpful thumbs up
3.0,Love it. It's basically a cross body. The storage part is bigger than expected. But I love it!
3.0,"This is cute, not very durable. Got a lot of compliments, i definitely need to order more, it surely won't  last."
3.0,Don't remember purchasing
3.0,Not a great fit for me but it looks good and feels like good material
3.0,GOOD FOR MY BIG HEAD BUT THEY DON'T SEAL AROUND THE EYES WELL NEED SOFTER FOAM
3.0,Very cute blouse but is very small!! I got an Xtra large and it was very tight in the chest.
3.0,It didn’t look how the picture is it look like a real thickness jogger suit like I thought it was Gona be but it fool me it’s crazy we spend i hard money on stuff for something that don’t look right this my first time buying outfits from y’all but I am Gona start getting some simple for now on tired return stuff some of simple be to high that should not be
3.0,"Th start with, I don’t really care for the fabric. Probably should have ordered a pair that was all cotton. The elastic in the waist is inadequate and the drawstring being on the inside rather than outside of the pants makes it difficult to tighten."
3.0,Too long.  Not a great fit for petite.  Otherwise fine.
3.0,Love the dress but waist is a bit short for me-i'm 5'8&#34; and it HAS POCKETS!
3.0,one glove shorter and smaller than the other. Could not use
3.0,"I really, really wanted to like this bra. I love the wife band and the shape; however, I had to return it because of the side boning sticking out weird. It didn’t lay flat and gave me a weird “bubbling” which made my waist look smaller but that’s because it made my side look fatter. If I could have removed the boning that caused that issue then I would have kept it."
3.0,"ordered these for my sons, they each now have a pierced ear. not my cup of tea but they say its still cool"
3.0,They're average cotton undies. Probably more suited for a teen/ young adult. But good overall.  That is all i have to say.
3.0,"So, we ordered 2 pairs, one for our little boy, and one for our little(r) girl.  The boys size was 11.5-12.5 M (shown as 30/31 on right), while the girls size was 9.5-11 M (shown as 28/29 on left).  Somehow, and I promise it's not a mirage, the smaller size is slightly larger than the smaller size. Now, we love the shoes, and don't want to return hers since she'll grow into them. However, we're to unsure as to what size to now order.... the same size which might be (correctly) smaller, or, a smaller size that might be correctly... well... too small.  Ugh!!!"
3.0,"This is thin, poly material like a nightgown. There is no shaping to the dress - it fits like a nightgown as well. It's OK with the shrug and comfortable."
3.0,Very comfortable but not the most flattering. I’m 5’6” 150 lbs and ordered a medium. Fits well but is frumpy.
3.0,"The first set of Pearl's I got, I wasn't pleased, there were tiny holes in the pearls, so, I ordered another pair but accidentally ordered two. I was able to get a set I liked this time. These are worth the money, but that first pair wasn't nice close up. My daughter didn't want either of the extra earrings so I had to returned them."
3.0,"When I think of a scarf, I think of a long thin rectangular piece of material.  This scarf is COMPLETELY SQUARE.  I saw the word ""square"" in the title of the item, but I guess it didn't register, as I have never seen a square scarf.....and the picture is a bit misleading.  It was delivered promptly, and it's very soft, very pretty, and light weight....I just need to figure out how to wear it!"
3.0,"Very nicely made skirt.  It’s definitely not lightweight though.  It’s described as lightweight, but in reality, is very heavy with a thick lining.  It’s also not a midi length.  I had hoped the length measurement was off, but indeed it wasn’t.  I’m 5’4” and the skirt hit my feet when worn very high.  Might work best for really tall girls.  This is way to thick for me to consider wearing in the hot, humid summer, and too long on me, so I’ll be returning."
3.0,"I love this mesh metal style band. I’ve used them for years. Eventually the finish starts to rub off and a new band is needed to look nice. I read reviews of people saying this 2 magnetic closure system sucked, I thought they were being babies. It really does suck. Hard to get on.  Hard to get a tight fit. My entire watch flew off my hand once while taking my shirt off. It’s just not good. If you can find the old style that threaded through one side, it is way better. The look and color are what I wanted."
3.0,The color changed from tri-colored to 2 colors but they are still pretty. Also the hook had to be put on when I received them but they are really cute!!!
3.0,Quality wasn't that good as I expected but its good enough.
3.0,"Too tight/form fitting for me. I'm 5'6"" 45"" bust x 41"" waist x 49"" hips 205-209 lb and the XXL hugged my curves way too much than I wanted. Showed my back bra fat and belly fat, its where I carry most of my weight. Does not match the sizing here plus the packaging states it is 3X but the tops are all XXL. Should be 27.8"" long but it's actually 26"". Should fit 44-46"" chest but it's really 36"" (18"" halfway in picture). It is stretchy, shiny material but not that stretchy, hence why it hugged my curves too much. Sadly returning."
3.0,Original was a better band.
3.0,Size larger than expected.
3.0,For the most part the watch is ok. The one dislike I have is in the picture the hands on the watch are black but the watch I got has gold hands and they are very hard to see .
3.0,"Nice lenses, only problem was they fit too tight against my head, behind my ears, and I have a small/medium size head."
3.0,It is nice and pretty I only gave 3 stars cause I suppose of got it on the 17th but I got it on the 26th.
3.0,"The shirts came out very dark maroon, navy, and gold. Pictures looked red blue and yellow.<br />Good shirts though"
3.0,Earrings are cute but the are way to big to be studs.  They weight ear down.
3.0,The pattern is pretty and vibrant but the product is not cotton and the straps are very thin.
3.0,"I bought this watch as something for every day - that I could get dirty or bang up, and it won't matter.  It's good for that, it's bigger and heavier than I expected, not really sure if it's really a woman's watch, it's that clunky.  Also, after having it for only a few hours, the second hand stopped working.  It just kind of flops around the dial however I move my wrist.  The watch itself keeps time just fine (despite the second hand) and the date seems to always assume it's PM when you adjust the day, so it changes after 12 hours.  Nonetheless, it still serves its purpose, keeps time fine (just minutes and hours, seemingly) and is durable when gardening or washing dishes."
3.0,"Haven't worn it in the water yet, so I can't speak for any of that. Just from trying it on at home, I can say it has a loose fit and the length is a bit short for me."
3.0,"they are comfortable and for a size 9 slightly large.  What I was not happy with it they are not water proof at all.  Very warm, but water can pour into around the seams on top of foot."
3.0,Okay... looser fit... Fabric is ribbed... printed tie dye is a bit shiny. I’ll be returning. Not worth the money.
3.0,"I can't use them, try to walk and use them for a week but the feet go forward and hurts.  They look good and may work for someone else but not me.  I don't know it is because they are wide but doesn't work."
3.0,"Beautiful. It fits me and my 11yo son, but not my husband, who I purchased it for."
3.0,It looks great but it starts to peel off the bottom due to heat.
3.0,An average bag that is too large for my purposes to use as a carryon.  There really is nothing in the design that makes this bag stand out.
3.0,"Let me start by saying that I used a promo code which saved me a substantial amount off of the retail price. I had such high hopes and had it shipped to my daughter for her birthday. She sent me the photos posted in my review and asked me for the info to return it. 🙁 Even with the hefty discount, I felt that this box wasn’t worth what I paid. The items inside were cheap and there was a very strong chemical odor that was overwhelming and unpleasant."
3.0,Took a while to get but it’s ok
3.0,I didn't love this like I thought I would. The necklace  is stiff but I love the color.
3.0,"I gave this shirt 3 stars for the simple reasoning of how absolutely shear this shirt is. You must wear something underneath which makes it weird because it's an off the shoulder shirt. Wearing something underneath like a spaghetti strap tank top is silly because then you see the straps up on the shoulders. The concept itself is great just need better material.<br /><br />**** I did not receive this product at a discount/free cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

3.0,"Breathable neck gaitor that can be worn a variety of different ways, very stretchy and soft material that feels nice on my face and neck and does great when I need to protect from mosquitos.  I use it for fishing, but it would suit any outdoor activity."
3.0,It is O.K. Very cheaply made.
3.0,"These are good for parties, but probably better for little kids. They were a bit too small for our mouths."
3.0,"Cute shirt, fits well but the burgundy color is actually red and looks weird with the design."
3.0,My 10 year old is typically true to size. This was way too loose on her. Cute suit and good quality though!
3.0,"I returned these. They were really pretty, but smaller than I wanted."
3.0,"First of all you as one commenter said, need to order one size up. I’m normally an XL and glad I ordered a 2XL. Only drawback to doing so is with it untucked hangs too low (below my butt and crotch). Need to tuck it in to make it look decent. Good, thick material, feels like it will hold up, and hope it doesn’t shrink when washed."
3.0,Lining baggy
3.0,"Would have loved it, except it is hopelessly small. And we bought the biggest size possible. It's been passed on already..."
3.0,"Ordered the gray one in XL (I am a Medium-Large). Maybe I should have gotten a large, but it felt like it was an ok fit. The hand openings were huge. Quality is satisfactory however it is much looser than what it appears in the photo. Almost felt like I was wearing a trash bag. The COLOR was a joke. The photo shows gray, I got a sweater that looks like it used to be black, then someone through it in the washer with a sock that had bleach on it and faded the black. It is warm and it looks like it will last a very long time, but not what I expected unfortunately. Also it looks nothing like the photo in the other review."
3.0,The dress wasn't as pretty in person. Plus is seemed very large in the waist.
3.0,Excellent usage for sewing caddy to carry to and from quilting classes.
3.0,I ordered two sizes larger and it was still too small!
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but the lace is really scratchy. It caused my skin to chafe where my underarm touched it, while trying it on. There’s no way I could wear this for hours at my sons wedding. Back to the drawing board for me."
3.0,"I liked the colors.  The top fit fine.  The pants are too long, and the fabric is very flimsy.  Maybe they’ll shrink a little when I wash them."
3.0,"I would give this more stars if the description were more accurate.  I like the item, but it is NOT a blazer. It is more like a cardigan, a thin cardigan. I'm keeping it because it's under $20 bucks but don't buy this if you're looking for a blazer. It is cute and looks like the picture but the material is thin (almost like a t-shirt)."
3.0,"I love the jeans they fit perfect I was given a three rating because they put in a very cheap zipper that wouldn't stay up otherwise I would have given a higher rating, considering I had to pay extra to put new zippers in"
3.0,"The top is very soft and comfortable. However, it is much longer than expected. Would look cute with leggings possibly but looked strange with shorts or jeans."
3.0,While it looks great and works great the one complaint I have for it is it keeps snapping on my clothes and causing runs. So don't wear with clothes you don't want damaged.
3.0,"They are very soft, but they were huge."
3.0,"My solid blue tie (Nautica brand) was MIA, and I needed one in a pinch for a business trip, so I gave this one a shot.  You tell the difference between this tie and other name brand, more expensive ties (fabric quality, which has effect on the tying of ties, ties ability to wrinkle and/or withstand wrinkling, etc, as well as, stiching...long-term durability/use), but for the price, it's a decent serviceable tie.  It's currently serving it's purpose for me (worn 3-4 times at this point), so...3 stars."
3.0,"I love it buts it runs big, I’m gonna have to get it altered because I have no time for returning"
3.0,The sleeves wee very cheaply made. I ripped them off. Otherwise the jumper was cute.
3.0,for the price okay
3.0,Really cute dress but the quality of the straps is terrible. The straps are attached and adjusted with plastic pieces that are very low quality. I'm afraid to even wear this until I alter the straps. I'm worried that the plastic will snap under any amount of stress.
3.0,the fabric is too hard and not soft enough.
3.0,The product itself was well made. The 2 pompoms were too close together. It looked weird. Really weird. I returned it.
3.0,If you want more comfort buy one sise up
3.0,I thought it would be much bigger. 🤨 It should fit a girl or a small woman. I wish it came in larger USA sizes. Nice price though.
3.0,This necklace is nice material but the &#34;stone&#34; is plastic
3.0,"These earrings are cute, but just a little big for my taste (12mm is max for me), is probably a 16-17mm.  If you like the earring to surpass your ear, then this earring is probably for you.  I decided to keep it anyway, just in case I ever need a little bigger studs."
3.0,I do like them alot. Now what I don't like is the size 16G. I wish I could of gotten a 14 or 12 or 10.  It was a little thick for me. And hard to put on with long nails.  Love the colors and price.
3.0,Fits like a large and makes me look like a stuffed sausage. Definitely first like a 12/14 not a XXL 20/22. 😬
3.0,Was much shorter than expected. Well above my ankles and I am 5'4''.
3.0,"It looks plastic with a flat rather than glossy appearance. Not much light passes through so it's a little darker than the pic.  But it's passable, and not worth sending back for the price."
3.0,Sturdy and will protect your glasses. Hard to unzip while driving.
3.0,"I bought these for my 1 year old and they are a little big, but not bad.  They are very cute but pretty pricey for the quality, and they came with one earpiece bent."
3.0,Don’t waste your money. I started to send back. But decided to give away. Material not at all what I expected. It’s a silky type  nylon or something. Will not be buying again. Run small.
3.0,it was too small. I didn't like the pattern. It looked muted in the pictures but  it wasn't. That ruined the look for me. Quality was good.
3.0,Nice Quality but the jacket could be a bit bigger I wasn’t worried about the pants because I knew it wouldn’t fit me because I’m a bit heavyweight not saying I’m displeased but just minor like complaints jackets arm keep me from reaching forwards normally but I like it for the most points. But I can’t wait wear it on Halloween with my friend and maybe figure out a way to make the jacket more mobile for me for most part.
3.0,Going to return and try again. Crooked skirt and the skirt pattern is upside down. I LOVE my other styles of this dress though.
3.0,"These feel like they would fall apart after about 2 wears.  Very thin paper like material.  I got these for my grandson, but I don't think his mom will be impressed.  The free socks that came with them were of better quality than the shoes."
3.0,"a very nice hoodie, but order one size larger than you want."
3.0,Nice dress but this is not a size 18 maybe more like a 14
3.0,"I really like the color and fabric of these shoes, however, I bought them because I have flat feet and shoes often hurt, if they have too much arch. After reading the reviews, I took a chance and bought these because they looked comfortable. They arrived and the insert inside the shoe, hurt my foot so bad, I could barely walk to the kitchen and back. The insert was a hard plastic and inflexible, where the arch was. So it was painful and I couldn’t wear it. I did however, take out that insert, and insert the regular shoe floor, that also came in the box. It was not like “walking on air”, but, it didn’t hurt my feet and was more comfortable, than the inflexible plastic. So, I think I will buy a nice soft pair of inserts to put inside the shoe, because I really do like the shoe."
3.0,it is good for our show needs
3.0,these ear rings were bigger than expected but my Queen said for the price perfect..lol
3.0,Did not get all of the pictured flights. Somewhat disappointed.
3.0,"Just like the title, material is very thin and transparent, but other than that, very cute."
3.0,I really wanted this rich dark purple but got a light purple the salmon color mask I'm so happy with the color description
3.0,Zippers don’t open or close easily. Not sure if this is the norm for the brand or if I got a defective one. Like the inside packets
3.0,"Didn't fit me as expected, but worked for my pregnant body"
3.0,"Didn’t fit under aisle seat on United 737-300. Did fit under aisle seat of United 767 (overseas). Was a pain to fit in car w/ four other folks & their luggage. Frankly, I missed the duffle bag I’d always used as a carryon/under seat before. Would be okay for an overnight trip."
3.0,Unfortunately won't be enjoying these as other customers have. I received them in a timely manner but the fear that they'd be too small for was confirmed
3.0,Product was okay. Fit like a tshirt
3.0,Not nearly as cute as I imagined… the pockets for cards are difficult to access. No room for Keys :(
3.0,"Pretty color. But VERY VERY big!! I ordered a medium because I wear a medium in just about everything and it looks like a lg/xl. Just a heads up, order a size down! But got here fast."
3.0,cute.  But the quality of the product is too expensive.
3.0,Havent used it yet. BUt in trying out the face masks not liking the small eye holes looks like will be very Hot.  But the rest seems great and cute
3.0,"Good quality hat, however to make it fit you have to pull strings inside the hat, but there was no sort of stopper that would hold the strings at the right spot. Returned."
3.0,"Purchased for my birthday dinner. Arrived just in the nick of time for the celebration. But I was expecting it to be all black, and the lace was a navy blue. Kind of disappointing, but still liked the dress. It does also however feel kind of like a swimsuit, and its very bulky so I cant even wear it if its very hot out. Like it, will continue wearing it, but would not purchase again."
3.0,It is not a great fit. Most M fit me but this one is slightly tight at the shoulder and sleeves; otherwise good fit. You may want to go a size up and the fit may be better.
3.0,Cut shirt. Quality seems nice but it is very big. I can't justify keeping it and I  like my tshirts to be on the bigger side.
3.0,"T-shirt fits, yet is too short for my long torso. Material is soft, but definitely not regular jersey T-shirt material."
3.0,This dress is extremely short and extremely thin fabric. Also there is a huge slit by the chest with ties to tighten it but kind of gives you this Old Maid look that I'm not too fond of. Wish I would have returned it in the 30 days because it is still hanging in the closet
3.0,Don’t size down like some reviewers recommended. I listened to that and now can’t wear them. They run small
3.0,"I bought this a while back, I had it for 2 months and one of the little stones fell out. It is beautiful but not very durable. It never tarnished, and I got lots of compliments. I was just disappointed when the stone fell out."
3.0,"So far so good.  Just wonder how long the plastic will hold up if I take it on a car trip or on the boat.  It is much bigger than I thought (size of a small carry-on for an airplane.  But, if I'm going to take a carry-on onto a plane, I want the biggest one I can take on legally.  So, it's too small for that.  Maybe I could stuff a purse into the carryon  or into my luggage and use this as my &#34;purse.&#34;  Ha, ha.  Anyway, after a cursory look, it's not the smaller make-up back I could stick in the back of my car for those days when I'm running late and don't have time to do my make-up at home.  But I'm not sending it back because I can use it for travel."
3.0,Picture gave off the impression that the sweater was long and the sweat barely reach my waist. I'm already short so I was expecting the length to be extra long but it was the complete opposite. Very disappointed and wish I received the product that was pictured.
3.0,OK hat
3.0,Did not like the material of the bracelet and the edges were square and flimsy.
3.0,This dress runs large and shows stains anytime it comes in contact with water.
3.0,"I ordered this dress for a photo shoot and it worked great for that purpose but I would never wear this in public. I'm 5' and this dress was short on me. It came up to mid to high thigh. The dress is also see through in the sunlight. I'm about 100 lbs and the fit was great, except for the length."
3.0,"Was cheap, looks cheap. Good for stocking stuffer but took FOREVER to get (coming from China, always good to know before ordering)."
3.0,"Drop it once about 2 ft. the one of the silver piece from the frame popped out and got damage. Otherwise I would give this a 5 star.  Yes, it is my fault for dropping it, but I dropped many other shades and nothing comes off. I owned about 10+ shades ranging from $7 - $200."
3.0,The look and got is good but the fabric is stiff and not very soft or stretchable. Hoping it will soften up with a few washes but definitely a stiffer fabric. Tight around the arms which is great and not too slim in the mid section.
3.0,"My stars, this is a very unusual garment! The fabric is a slick, thick, noisy, stretchy, heavy... I wanna say canvas. Except it's stretchy in each direction. It's weird. It reminds me of the girdles my mom used to wear in the 1960s.<br />The tacky buttons on the sleeves have gotta go, but it's easy enough to find some beautiful, less obtrusive buttons to replace them with.<br />I need to lose a little more weight before I'll be happy with the way it fits. It would be unfair for me to judge the fit at this point.  The bizarre inverted pleats in the center front and the center back pop and protrude like crazy if you have any trunk at all, let alone if you have any junk in it. I hope they'll lay flatter when I'm closer to my goal weight.<br />Despite all the above misgivings, I have high hopes for this dress. It will be warm in winter with such heavy fabric. The beautiful deep blue looks striking with a rhinestone starburst brooch I have, like a night sky. This dress shouldn't be over- accessorized (should anything?) because with such unusual tailoring, insets, pleats, etc. it can become cluttered looking pretty quick. I might get a crinoline petticoat to fluff out the makes-a-girl-wanna-twirl skirt a little.<br />I'll edit this review when I fit into the dress a little better if it changes what I think."
3.0,Very costly for a child's slipper.
3.0,"Is smaller than expected, and thin"
3.0,"Since I'm slim with a 34"" inseam, it's hard to find sweatpants that fit well. These were the right length, look good, and feel good but the zipper is so poor quality they are annoying to put on and take off. I still wear them since they are fine otherwise, but the zipper will probably give out at some point. I might buy a new version with a better zipper."
3.0,Band came with one end that slides into my watch bent . Luckily I took an end off of another band to use . Fast shipping . Packed well .
3.0,"it is  adjustable and  clean made but is too thin and does not come with the filler, so I had to add it myself. Also had to adjust the chin part which was large for my petite face. I wish they would make it like the nose part so it is easy to adjust withoout need for alteration."
3.0,"It says it’s oversized, if anything it’s smaller then others we have have."
3.0,"This is okay. I'm using it as a cover up or a house dress. I wouldn't really go anywhere in it, but it's fine to be seen in it. The fit is weird. I feel like the top part is supposed to be more fitted, but it's not."
3.0,"This item is precious! So very tiny and cute! My daughter loved it, until it left a greenish run around her finger. But for $13 it’s cute costume jewelry."
3.0,I didnt know it was all these keys. wow
3.0,The top part is heavy so it keeps falling to the side. This belly ring won't stay straight.
3.0,Terrible cheap fabric. Looks a mess. More like a cheap lab coat than something to wear out of the house. Might make an ok summer jacket but it's just a little strange and cheap. Overall very odd quality.
3.0,"My son got this ring for Christmas. Only having worn it a few days, it is turning his finger black (although the description says it will last years without tarnishing)."
3.0,"I really like the fabric, it is lightweight and feels soft.  However, it was too big for me and would not stay on my face so I could not use it as mask for which I purchased it. I wear glasses which also complicated the fit.  If it had fit, I would have given 5 star rating."
3.0,Not really what I was expecting. The bottoms fit but it you are a curvier girl like me they don't really hold you in very well. The top was way to big... hard to explain but there was no way I could wear it.
3.0,"I'm not sure if I'm convinced by this product.... Would I buy it again? definitely not, I will keep looking for something else.<br />I was looking for a product that makes your jewelry as shiny as if you just bought it and the result wasn't there."
3.0,"I love the style of the shirt, it is a little snug and would love for it to be a tad longer."
3.0,Bought 2.  One arrived broke.  All in all I like it
3.0,I like the amount of heated air it blows but the arms are irritating they don't stay up. I'm surr some of them will stay up but mine doesnt...still dries your shoes
3.0,It was a nice necklace.  Well made.  It was a bit too short for me.  It is very shiny.  I did return the necklace because it was a bit too small.  I had my refund in 3 weeks.  Nice company.  I would buy from them again.
3.0,Going to return this because it did NOT come with panties. Instead the 4th piece was a pair of little nylon booties. ??<br /><br />I would have kept this if it came with the panties. The material feels amazing.
3.0,Pretty colors and well made.  They keep your ears adequately warm but do not pull down far enough to cover my ears.  They are not at all adjustable.  Marked down for that.<br />Very fashionable and cute on a younger woman.  I am 70 years old and just plain look silly.
3.0,"On my body hour glass shape, it fit a little to snug across the bust. Comfortable other wise. Nice to have pockets."
3.0,"Good size, however, they made my ears itch and made the holes in my ears bloody when I took them out!"
3.0,It isn’t as non slip as I had hoped. My hair is thin and it keeps sliding. Kind of frustrating.
3.0,"This leggings is super stretchy, but stays in place at the waist. However when I received mine, there was line where the threading was undone, so was a bit disappointed."
3.0,Nice pj’s but they run small.
3.0,Cute But easy to break arms are not attach well
3.0,Beautiful watch but NOT water proof.
3.0,"The top is very cute, although a bit small.  It seems very poorly put together but what can I expect from a $3 shirt?!?"
3.0,The wood breaks very easily
3.0,"To small,"
3.0,I was hoping for mens socks with beige in the pattern. What looks like beige is really grey.  The socks will work with grey pants.
3.0,The material was not fleece but polyester. I was not pleased
3.0,It was nice but after a week of using it the band tore on the side and then broke leaving me with all my cards in my pocket till I got home
3.0,"We did love the product and he looked adorable holding the box. However, the sun glasses were broken when it arrived, and we were not able to get the airpiece to stay in his ear."
3.0,"I am 5'1 117 lbs and ordered an XS. This dress was enormous on me. The sleeves are too long, and the deep v-neck goes down to my stomach. I'm disappointed bc the colors and patterns are gorgeous!"
3.0,"Ughhhhh! I give up on sports bras.  I read the reviews add decided to order a 38DD, I where a 38D.  Wrong! It’s so small.  Seems like a well made products but I’m done with ordering clothing."
3.0,Had a very bad odor like a gasoline smell for a few days. Then it smelled fine. The bottom corners are already wearing away. That's a little disappointing. After a month. It's a cute purse through and I do get lots of compliments. Just pricey for it to be wearing already.
3.0,comfortable did not flatten or slide
3.0,"I was so excited to order this umbrella. I will say the print is soo beautiful, I love that it is on the inside of the umbrella. It works great to get in and out of the car. Yes it works great even with the wind, super sturdy...On the other hand, it does not fold very compact, as it will not fit in your purse and (I always carried my umbrella in my purse). I also find it always takes me about 2-3 attempts to lock it in the open position. I am not sure if I would buy it again."
3.0,Not long enough which makes the boobs look strange. Has a bleach stain.
3.0,"Hi, i like sturdiness of material and size perfect but zipper scared me. I packed stuffed and i just didnt like zipper, It got off track a couple of times and i wasnt sure if it would hold. If you purchase please do not stuff full.  Its merely a carry on"
3.0,Poor quality fabric. Cute dress. Especially the detail on the shoulders. Fits as expected.
3.0,"So these leggings fit wonderfully and I'd recommend them as long as you dont get the plaid print, which looks nothing like the photos and looks like someone spilled water on a newspaper."
3.0,"The pearls are not as described. There are blemishes and the gloss is not as advertised. The fastener claims that it is 925 silver. I doubt it, the metal is silver colored with a stamp of 925. The pearls are cool to the touch and warms to your body’s temp and cools quickly after you remove hem.The packaging is very nice but I rather have a better quality product than pretty packaging."
3.0,"You have to be careful with applying this case. I ended up scratching my phone on one of the edges. Once you out the phone in the case you will see that when you pick up the phone the case feels substantially cheap. The interesting thing is that it is beautiful, but once the case goes on dont try to open it again because you will compromise the snaps."
3.0,These are cute but they are HUGE. You can untie and adjust size but I couldn’t get the bow to look good again. I personally didn’t like that you have to readjust the size. Not small enough for infant. Maybe a toddler
3.0,I love it but it can 2 weeks later then it said it was so make sure to know that it will not come at the right time
3.0,"was looking for a small wallet to fit my small purse, simple wallet design, however sometimes i have a hard time taking my card out of the inside most pocket which is quite tight, have to fumble around with it. also the little zipper pocket which i assume is used for coins can be hard to put/get coins in and out of. Cant carry too many bills with this wallet either but it's a simple little wallet"
3.0,Stiff as a board and rough around the brim. Ouch. 😡
3.0,"A bit flimsy. I guess I was expecting something a bit more solid, less cheap plastic feeling."
3.0,"Cute, but runs two sizes smaller than size listed. Buyer beware."
3.0,Rather tight and more like an elastic hair band or waist band material.
3.0,"As far as sticky bras go it is ok. Has all the problems all sticky bras do. Loses stickiness over time not very comfortable, but does the job"
3.0,"Bought an XL, but it's a little large on me. Also, the backing on the shoulder falloffs is not the same material, it's white, so it shows alot."
3.0,"It’s a cute set but it looks pretty cheap (obviously it was) chain is really thick and gawdy and the fur is really shiny, almost looks like it has sparkles in it. I would spend a little more next time to get a better set."
3.0,"Dress was comfortable and soft.  Fitted at top.  Loose and flowy at bottom.  Pockets seemed a little to high.  Neck seemed more boat neck, had to do a little adjusting/pulling to get it right."
3.0,"The sleeves seemed to be like they were stretched out and worn. The fit is perfect, the only thing I didn’t care for was the sleeve cut."
3.0,Nice wallet but getting cards in and out is a pain. Way to firm and no place to hold your ID. Overall an ok wallet. Hopefully it breaks in
3.0,My 8 year old niece loved these but could not wear the due to not being real.
3.0,Flower comes off
3.0,Only issue I feel is the length of the shirt not that long.  made for people who have a 30 inch waist versus those with 40 inch waist looking for something to work out in.  Not what i expected.  5'7'' 243 and 3xl does not fit.
3.0,"Looking at the picture it seemed that the pendant was small! But it pretty big and it's not my style. Unfortunate the picture did not correctly represent the actual product that was sent to me. The chain looks very cheap. I am not happy with this and will return it. People who would like antique jewelry may like it, this is not what I expected. Thanks"
3.0,"One of mine broke within a few weeks. Other than that, super super cute :)"
3.0,Some of the keychains are frayed
3.0,This is cute but thin material and super small. Not going to be able to wear it so gave to a teenager who is about 3 sizes smaller than me.
3.0,"I got this purse because I needed something big enough for myself for an evening bag, but small enough to not be dragging my actual purse along. Well, first of all, I didn't realize that this was see-through. This was not something that I wanted. But the size was perfect and I had a couple of events to attend, and this did go really well with what I would be wearing. (Both events were cancelled just as a FYI.)<br />But what really burns me is that the cell phone I have now doesn't fit in here. I had a little tiny flip phone that fit in everything, but last fall when we were all made to go to smart phones, ALL of the purses that I had worked on downsizing myself into are now too small. But literally, the phone is nowhere near close to going in here, so it's a total loss for me now. (So is the dress I bought for the events, too! AAaagh!)"
3.0,"Love the bottoms, not so much the top. The top fits but the strap is too long. I normally wear a 32/34DD so my bust is not so small."
3.0,Too large & item didn't look like the picture
3.0,"Like another reviewer who was also a size large, the dress just didn’t look right on ME. It looked great on the model, but looked frumpy on me. The zipper was cheap, and although the material had a very nice stretch, it’s texture was rough and itchy. I’m sad because it’s such a cute dress! So maybe only thinner/taller people look nice in this dress."
3.0,Quality of the lenses are in line with the price paid
3.0,Very pleased with the look however the &#34;gemstone&#34; came off the setting after the second wearing.
3.0,I'm gonna give this a try. After I have tried it for 30 days I'll come back to update my review.
3.0,OK gave away to a teenager
3.0,"I have using this MD product in a past. And keep re-ordering it, but this Cham I did not get the same product. Feel like being with the off. Not as the original item I used to get."
3.0,The stings was pulled out when I received it. Also the material is super thick.
3.0,Doesn’t look like the pic exactly . But it’s cute nonetheless
3.0,I love the fabric and the fit. It's thin but not see through. The only problem is that the pattern on the neckline is off.
3.0,"I was excited to see this after all the hype from IG and FB.<br />I'm a 32C and don't enjoy wearing bras, like any other girl here, so I bought a pair.<br />It was very easy to attach to the breasts and it stayed on, however the bra attached to the sides and the valley of my breasts felt like they were slowly beginning to lift and I can feel it because the inner side of the bra is very sticky. It also makes your breasts sweat so it seems like a good idea, but when it gets sweaty, you feel extra sticky.<br />I've used it 3 times after I bought it, and have washed it as directed (with warm water and soap), but the sticky part on the outer side of the bra started to peel after 3 wears. I'm not sure if I have a defective one or if it really just only lasts 3-5 wears.<br />If it states it's reusable..it at least has to last 10 wears, so I'm a bit disappointed."
3.0,"nicely made, delivery a little delayed due to virus not there fault. however, filter falls off and the material kinda hot. have to remove if its a hot day. like that its washable. stands up to wash just guessing may have to remove filter first."
3.0,I like the material but it doesn't stay in place well when I wear my clogs.
3.0,"A visor that connects to glasses is a great idea.  This one needs to be 1/2 inch wider and 1/2 inch larger to provide better shading to the eyes.  The elastic that fit over the glass frames are small and will likely wear as a result of wrapped around large frame.  Still worth it for the price.  I suggest the company consider making a few models that vary in size and recommend a sizing chart to fit to different frames.  Narrow, Medium, and Thick."
3.0,For that money it should have been embroidered!
3.0,Smaller than all other panties I've purchase in the same size.
3.0,Smaller than size stated<br />Had wash many times before the fabric stopped giving me a rash. I do not have sensitive skin
3.0,"Its ok but I thought it world be a little bigger since it didn't say it world be small, but it is very small but still handy for a few things like lip gloss money and cards"
3.0,"gloves were nice except that it's hard to tell on the pictures that the stitching is on the outside, which is a little atypical and looks bad.But the leather was supple and lining was soft and warm.<br /><br />The only other complaint i have is that I measured my hand based on the sizing chart provided, and the gloves that came should have been on the small side, but instead were excessively large. There was almost an inch of empty glove at the end of my fingers when i put them on.<br /><br />Overall; if you're willing to send them back once or twice to get the right size or are feeling lucky, they are pretty nice gloves. Otherwise get some from a store where you can try them on first.<br /><br />update: upon looking closer, I was actually sent 2 different size gloves. They're still nice gloves, but frustrating to deal with things like this when it's 5 degrees outside and I have no gloves."
3.0,"At first, I was obsessed I loved this so much... however the pendant fell off after two weeks."
3.0,"Returned, didn't fit."
3.0,"Very nice looking hat, just wish it was bigger."
3.0,These are really pretty. My only thing is they run small on some of the bracelets and too big on others. It looks odd because they are all elastic bands. Also all of the metal beads are faded and scuffed up. The idea of them is really nice though!
3.0,"Bought this as a color apron for myself. It’s HUGE!!! I’m A pretty petite gal, 105 lbs, 5’4” and am swimming in this. I can wrap the waist straps around my body and clip them in the front with plenty of strap to spare"
3.0,"They fit nice and tight. Exactly what I’m looking for.<br />For some reason the color is peeling right off the orange one.<br />Other than that, for the price, not bad.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />The color is peeling off ALL of the rings.<br />Oh well."
3.0,Blower doesn’t work
3.0,"Good material, lightweight and breathable. However this thing fits very tight for me. I’m hoping it will stretch a little to a more comfortable fit."
3.0,I'm in a band and ordered (2) packs of two and only got three hats. It looks like one of our band members is going hatless for New Years....
3.0,"This is such a pretty bead! It looks well made and so girlie cute! I was so excited to get it for my new europa style bracelet. However, it got stuck on the clasp of the bracelet because it wouldn't screw on all the way. I wish I hadn't tried to force it and maybe it wouldn't have gotten stuck and I could have used it elsewhere, but regardless, now I have 1 bead on my bracelet. Sadness. I'm giving it a 3 star because I&#34;m the one who got it stuck, but the bead is the one who has a threading problem. It really is beautiful. And I got it moved enough that I can close the bracelet, so technically I can still wear it... Just not collect charms. Oh... and the little gold you see at the bottom of the castle is a little gold crown with a pink stone in it. It is really cute;)<br />I received this product sample for testing so I could leave an honest review.<br />Thank you."
3.0,Pretty difficult to close to make the ring tighter. The paint also chips off after a couple days of wearing any of the rings.
3.0,Runs smaller than advertised. Otherwise they are great
3.0,Eh. Im not too pleased with this purchase. It runs extremely big and the material is on the super cheap side. I ordered 3-6 months but my little guy wont fit into it until at least 12 months.
3.0,"First mask we ordered had a broken strap, but no issues getting a replacement. These are definitely adult size masks though...too big for my little Cars fan."
3.0,I bought this green dress because with showed the model with hands in her dress pockets. The dress I received does not have pockets. The main reason I bought it was to have the pockets. So I’m pretty disappointed. It is a cute dress but will probably return.
3.0,String broke after first day so we had to sew it back. But I guess it's what I expected for the price
3.0,I'm 5'7 and the XL came a few inches above my ankle. Great quality.
3.0,The dress is well made looked great on my friend a size 22.
3.0,"Light stain barely noticeable on shirt, however significant because it shouldn’t have any stains. Quick shipping. Stretchy material, so it is comfy. If your 2x go up a size if they have it."
3.0,Fits like an XL so runs a bit small and the color is almost purple-ish. It's stil looks brown but just a weird shade.
3.0,It's a real sword. Roughly finished and with a bit of surface rust but for the price it's a good deal.
3.0,"I read that this top fits small so i ordered a medium. I always wear a small but decided if this many people said it fit small i needed to order up. the bottoms fit perfect. The top is HUGE. i am 5'7, 126 pounds and a 32C. it's too big to wear, i will have to alter the top on my own. disappointed in the product but for the price i will not return."
3.0,These are best used at dusk or dimley lit areas. It definatly helps drivling at night. Just not as drastic as the TV commercial implied.
3.0,This vest looks cool as ever but the quality in the stitching isn’t there. If you catch the vest on anything it tears very easily.
3.0,It does not stretch so it has to be exact size
3.0,"the holder is slightly too big so the airtag will be uncentered sometimes. it won't fall out it just looks a little weird. the design side looks cool, but that uncentered airtag might throw someone off if you are obsessive of that kinda thing."
3.0,The material is no what I expected.  For the price I believe the dress was a good deal but it was just not for me.
3.0,inexpensive ad looks it
3.0,Nice ring but feels like some sharp edges here & there. Not super impressed…
3.0,"Socks were much thinner than I expected for cost, but will be fine in the summer months."
3.0,"Sizes are not correct, a medium is like a x small"
3.0,The leather is soft - too soft. Tremendous amount of stretching has occurred and has required more holes to be punched.
3.0,"I bought these because other buyers said they helped keep their hands warm for typing (I don't know why there isn't a good glove specifically designed to keep your hands warm while typing).  Anyway, I've had these gloves for a couple weeks now, and I wouldn't say that they keep my hands warm (maybe I just have exceptionally cold hands).  The material seems like a normal breathable material that isn't going to insulate your hands.  And since the fingers stop at the first knuckle, they don't really help your fingers very much at all.<br /><br />The product itself is well made, that's the reason for the three stars.  They fit well without cutting off circulation, and they cover the wrist bone (but just barely).  The fingers are stitched around the ends so there isn't any fraying, which is better than many other gloves.  The fabric itself doesn't feel cheaply made or anything, and it's thin so it doesn't inhibit dexterity.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend these gloves for anyone trying to keep their hands warm while typing, and I'm looking elsewhere to find something that will.  (I'm not bothering returning the gloves since I paid so little; it would be more of a hassle than it's worth)."
3.0,"Not crazy about this muscle shirt.  I got a medium and it fits me too big.  (Maybe I need more muscle, LOL).<br /><br />The material is good and the workmanship is also well done.  It's just that the fit does not work for me.<br /><br />Additionally, the main reason for not liking it is that the buttons are on the side typically used by women's clothing."
3.0,Outfit does run small. I'm usually a large & I went up to XL. I'm 5'3 160. Loved the outfit on but as soon as it was on the waist band ripped. Like other buyers have reported. So when trying it on don't tug on the waist band. Sadly will be returning it.
3.0,"The material was very very stiff, but thin, at the same time.The shirt fit, but it was a little tight around my bust  I ended up returning the shirt."
3.0,I returned this item because it was as long as the pictured described. Came mid lower leg and I was looking for something to the ankles.
3.0,"I only needed it for one night for a group (ensemble) matching outfit. I bought it mostly because I needed the black tie and a white collared shirt. I wore it under a pantsuit so it served it purpose for me. However, the shirt does run small and it’s off white, not white. If I hadn’t planned to wear it under a jacket, I would not have worn it as it’s too snug of a fit to wear alone. I probably will not wear again."
3.0,I like the look of the band and it fits nice but the one I got just wouldn't stay latched. I'd look down and the snap would be unsnapped. Thinking about trying another one to see if I have the same issue.
3.0,I am not crazy about the material it is somewhat flimsy.
3.0,I am 5'4 and ordered a medium. The spandex is stretchy but it is too small. I can stretch it to come up my whole body but the crotch area never reaches my actual crotch haha. It stops around mid thigh. I am assuming if i got a bigger size this problem would still exist and I would have bunching in that area. I'm debating about whether to keep it or not because it fits everywhere else good just not the private area.
3.0,The dress was disproportionate for the size
3.0,Comfy pattern if different than shown. For the price they are good
3.0,"The shoulder/arms are disproportionately large compared to the body. Love the way the body fits, but I feel like it looks dumb bc the arms (from elbows to shoulders) are almost like... baggy batwings. Great for wearing around the house, but I don't wear it out."
3.0,"Maybe my head is shaped weird, but this never lays flat on my head no matter how i try and wear it.  It's either my head is shaped weird, or maybe it isn't tight enough?<br />I don't think I would spend this much on a head band again unless i knew for sure it fit right."
3.0,"My 1.5 year old has very chunky feet so I needed a shoe like this that was very adjustable. While the fit is PERFECT, I can tell unfortunately the back velcro strap won’t last long. We’ve only had these shoes 19 days and he hasn’t even worn them daily, the threads are already falling apart. Because they fit his feet well and stay on I don’t mind buying another pair since they’re inexpensive..but just keep in mind the quality isn’t amazing."
3.0,It was a good buy but don’t wash it at home the color washes out and the greens are different shades. It’s still a cute dress even though he color didn’t hold
3.0,Didn't fit as expected. Too tight and see through. Really high neck and sleeves were annoying. No worth keeping and will be returning.
3.0,"I paid attention to other reviews and ordered two sizes up. I'm usually a medium top and large bottom but went with the XXL. As long as you don't let wearing two sizes up get to you, it's a great fit. It's a very flattering swimsuit if you're a little self conscious of your hips, like I am. I'm giving it 3 stars because as cute as it is, the quality isn't great. The seams of the rouching pull easily when you're taking the bottoms on/off and the underwire of the top started poking out after one wash."
3.0,Def not a dress. this is a longer shirt. would be great for maternity!
3.0,These were lower quality than anticipated and it sat higher on the ankles than I wanted them too. Also “high rise” was more like mid rise<br />Won’t buy again
3.0,its super cute but the bottoms are a little baggy and the fabric is cheap so it's a little see through.
3.0,"Cute, but not for the large chested. Top becomes sheer with the gals pushing on the material. Bummer."
3.0,I LOVE these but I really had to stop using them. I thought I had a faulty charging pod for my AirPods… I was cleaning the contacts and cleaning the contacts and even still they weren’t charging. I was ready to contact Apple. Just on a chance I didn’t use the chain on my AirPods for a few days after cleaning and successfully charging …. and … no more issues with charging.<br />My GUESS is that the substance the wonderful lil’ grippers are made of coat the contacts on the AirPods themselves … then this gets transferred into the charging pod contacts.
3.0,"It is good, but the silver get so dark really quick, and gt broken so easily. Not worth it."
3.0,"I gave this bra 3 stars because it's made well, nice design and I love the colors. I so wish it fit! I got my true band size because I like a snug fit in a sports bra but I should have listened to the other reviewers and gone up a band size. It was VERY snug. The support was also pretty disappointing. I wear an F cup and there was looooots of movement when jumping or jogging. It was definitely not an improvement over other bras I already own so I decided to return it."
3.0,Dont work like indicated
3.0,"Though the ring itself didn’t cause any irritation to my nose, the double hoops were uneven and it looked a little odd. And then, with the way it’s made, it was so hard to take off 😭 At least in my nose, it didn’t rotate at all, and I had to get elbow deep in my nostril to pop it open lol but maybe you won’t have that issue!<br /><br />Single hoop was totally fine!"
3.0,Had watch two weeks; still don’t have the moon phase synced. I even read the directions.
3.0,Pretty good quality- runs very small!
3.0,Creates a nice shape for my body. Not the nicest material but it's comfy and easy to throw on for a night where you want to be a bit more dressy without all the effort. Works for the price.
3.0,It's a cute concept but the only problem is where it meets in the middle there is a big gap with loose threading I am thinking of putting a pin brooch or showing up better there. It is comfortable I'll probably wear it around the house more than anything else I'd wash it in delicate inside of hey washing bag cold cycles. I left it in my washing bag to dry it and looks the same . I've heard this up with leggings and it looks nice I'm just still debating on whether I like the part where it meets in the middle it really should be paid more attention to when they were making it .
3.0,Runs small and the color is teal no emerald. The skirt is short and the slip underneath is about 4 inches shorter than the skirt.
3.0,"First ordered the L, sent it back way too small. I ordered another in XL because I liked this dress. I received the XL today and it's a perfect fit.<br />The fabric is very thin.  I will need to wear a tee and leggings or shorts with this one.  Never the less, it is a cute dress. R. Vivimos I love your styles"
3.0,"I usually wear medium, bought a large to be loose but yet it fits very snuggly.  Also the texture of the material is very rough."
3.0,"One of the chains was detached and one of the chain circles was broken so it took me a while fixing it. But I fixed it so I hope it won't fall apart again. It is cute though. It seems pretty fragile, but maybe because mine came a little broken. It looks pretty and shiny for now."
3.0,"The wallet itself is great - nice and big, plenty of space and pockets to organize everything I like to keep in my wallet. The color however, was not at all what I ordered.<br />I ordered the bright Aqua, and was sent a seafoam green wallet - the color I was sent isn't even an option to choose from when purchasing.<br />It worked out, I like the color. It just isn't what I ordered. Happy accident for me, but if you're a stickler for color, this would be problematic."
3.0,Bulky but cute
3.0,Teeny tiny compared to others I've found in vintage with regular bracelet width.  But she liked it.
3.0,Shoe seems cheaper made than other vans I've purchased over the years.
3.0,Not bright enough orange!
3.0,I bought these for my daughter in February and the durability is definitely a con. The lights stopped working about a 2 months later and they started looking very worn as well. However even with no lights my daughter gets compliments on her shiny gold shoes! It makes her feel so proud of herself! So they get 3 stars solely on cool points!
3.0,Super dark is correct.  So dark you get some reflection from the rear via the inside lens.  Too dark for driving but otherwise okay.
3.0,If it isn't put on tight enough the snake turns and gets cought. It shipped to late to complete my costume so I most likely wont wear it all but it would have gone great if it got here on time.
3.0,The sizing runs really small
3.0,Love the look  but runs small  go I size up also  very  stiff
3.0,The pin keeps falling off the band. It doesn’t stay in place like the vinyl ons which makes it easier to change bands daily. These elastic ones are easier to wear once you have the pins and slot in place but I would not recommend for us adults who have a lot on our table.
3.0,This is such a cute bracelet but it broke several times since I've gotten it. Seems kind of cheaply made.
3.0,I have mixed emotions about this set. I had no idea it would be thermal on the inside. Im a woman that sweats as soon as the heat hits me so this wouldn't be good for outdoor wear if your hot natured. Also the waist was a bit snug.
3.0,"Decent glasses, nice small clip (does not flip up) but way too big for my glasses. You do not need to add 5mm to your lens height for these clip-ons. Just use the actual height because the clip on these does not keep the lenses higher like most clip-ons."
3.0,"This baby bootie looked promising, but I had to send it back. Loved the quality, and the thickness of the fabric. The problem was that the stitching that holds the bootie to the top cuff was tight and made it impossible to get on my chunky baby’s ankle. This may not be an issue for babes that aren’t quite as big as he is but for us, we couldn’t even get it on. (For a size reference, my son is 2 months old, in size 6 month clothing, in 99th percentile for weight)"
3.0,They pinch a bit but look very real.
3.0,The clear plastic part is kind of like wearing a shower curtain. It’s wrinkled and distorts your vision. No what o was expecting at all.
3.0,I have a thin waste but a B cup it look like if have massive boobs and I feel fat and gross this puppy flattens me out but still makes them look like boobs
3.0,"The sleeves are super tight, cannot pull up at all (like to wear as 3/4 length). Stitching is showing at the seams because the sleeves were tight (my arms are not abnormally large or anything, probably on the small end)."
3.0,Overall it's a cute belt. The material is kind of cheap but doesn't really look it. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because unless you have a bigger waist the to ends of the belt will sort of wilt over. I cheated and put 2 black rubber bands on both ends of the belt to tuck it in so it does not sag.  Haha overall love the belt style!
3.0,"Needs to consider larger chest women. Other than that, looks nice"
3.0,Runs to small and causes the shirt to roll up.
3.0,"Im usually a LG as I have a larger vust area but the pleats make me look really wide and its very loose, so I need to size down."
3.0,"This ring looked like it might be interesting in the photos on its Amazon details page, but it also looked like it might be rather toyish. I decided to order one and see how it looked in real life.<br /><br />Well, in real life the ring is more subdued and tasteful than it looked in its pictures. See the photo that accompanies this review. Still, I waver between feeling that this is a toy versus feeling that this is a real piece of jewelry I'd want to wear in public. So I'll give it 3 stars."
3.0,Not the colors I wanted
3.0,"Item is as described and is made from cheap material and craftsmanship. I am 5'4&#34; tall and it does not reach the floor. I am also 165lbs and it will stretch to fit, however, the slit in the side leaves a big open gap instead of closing together. Overall good for the money."
3.0,"The lens is okay and is clear, but the problem lies in the photochromic material used. It takes a while to start to darken and when it does it really is not that dark. This is a great late evening lens, but would not recommend it being used for bright daylight conditions. But honestly if you are expecting more from a sub $20 photochromic lenses you might want to spend the money on the OEM stuff."
3.0,It's soooo cute
3.0,It was okay. However it's hard to say if you should buy a size up. I bought a size down from what I usually buy and it didn't fit very well so maybe buy the size you would normally buy. Also it is generally shapeless.
3.0,Beautiful dress but not true size as advertised
3.0,I got a lot of compliments on these earrings. My issue is they are to heavy. I had sore ear lobes the next day. If that doesn't bother you buy them.
3.0,"Cute summer dress! However, I’ve only worn it twice (washed on gentle cold cycle in a delicates bag), and sadly, the color already appears to be fading and not looking new or as nice anymore. If produced in a nicer more durable fabric I believe it would last longer."
3.0,"The design is beautiful, but I don’t wear it often because the clasp is not secure and comes undone. I purchased two different colors and both are having the same problem."
3.0,A very lovely addition to my pin collection.  Lots of sparkle and a decent amount of weight.  Does not weigh the fabric down and does not create large holes in the material.  A bit disappointing in the clasp however.  It is weak and will break when moved clipped often.  If the inner prong is not bent enough it will come undone and poke.  Very painful actually.  If you purchase this pen I would recommend making sure the clasp if bent far enough to enclose the pin so it doesn't easily pop.  But it truly is a lovely design and the brooch itself is very durable.  It looks excellent against darker material and will definitely shine proudly.
3.0,big size
3.0,I will exchange for a smaller size.
3.0,"The dress is cute - very comfy - but the fabric isn't great.  Hard to get the wrinkles out, no matter how long I steam-iron it"
3.0,"looks like the picture, but the fit is awkward.  the bottoms were tiny, and the top was huge!"
3.0,It’s a good lightweight bra with nice fitting pads. Much wider and a tiny bit fuller than those paper thin pads. I bought the small and couldn’t get it on sent back and got medium. It too is small but it works. I really like it but will order a Large next. This is how small I am and would fit in a Large. 5ft2in and 112 lbs. build is small and athletic like yoga slim not bodybuilding athletic. Still worth it if you get the correct size. I'm a 34A at best. I really couldn’t see this for big breasted women although there were several reviews from bigger women that loved it.
3.0,These didn’t fit over the toe of my daughter’s size four western boots. Disappointing.
3.0,Came on time nice a long but the straps aren't sown on great 2 already unattached from shirt from the sewing not being good
3.0,Won't hold the adapter but it's great to move and travel around with.
3.0,The shirt printing is of OK quality but the shirt is very thin material and low quality.  It is also short in length.
3.0,Cute but elastic in waist is twisted & wont untwist so she doesn’t wear it much because it looks weird.
3.0,"The pictures depict more flare than the top actually has. Otherwise comfortable and soft, good quality material."
3.0,"I bought, I returned. It looked like cheap fabric and little-girl quality and style. Not the sophisticated look I was going for."
3.0,"I ordered it too big and had to take it in on the side by cutting it down, but it looks nice with tights.  will order a smaller size in another color."
3.0,"I needed black pants in a hurry, that is the only reason I bought these. They are way over priced. You can find better quality ones for 1/4 the price."
3.0,I ended up returning the sunglasses because I didn’t realize how humongous they were. If you would like extremely large sunglasses then these are for you!
3.0,Cute but too small. Not a goid fit
3.0,It’s like wearing another top.
3.0,"Super cute and sturdy.<br /><br />[Edit: the strap broke ;___; Definitely not sturdy, I would recommend this for something you're not going to be placing a lot of things in.]"
3.0,"I bought the yellow - just to have an over-the-knee sock to wear around the house.  I am female 5'8&#34; and size 10 shoe (This would be comparable to a man's size 8 shoe).  The foot is just barely large enough and I stretched the fabric as taut as possible to get the top of the sock above my knee.  Then it was so uncomfortable that I ended up rolling them down below the knee, thus defeating my purpose in buying them.  They are of good quality, thick socks.  The description with the picture says they are solid cotton.  The details say they are cotton polyester.  They feel like pure polyester...do not have the softness of cotton.  Nowhere does it tell you the percentage of each fabric.  The packaging is all in Chinese, so that doesn't help.  Reading the other reviews, it leads me to believe there is no standardization in the sizing.  One person said they were 6' and theirs fit ok.  It is ridiculous to believe that &#34;one size fits all&#34; from a girl child to a male adult.  There should be at least 4 different sizes.  It also would be nice if things sold in America were in inches instead of cm so you don't have to go to an online converter to figure out the dimensions.  I will not buy these again, but will try a &#34;knee warmer&#34; sock that I can wear on top of my knee socks."
3.0,"For the first wearing, they were wonderful. Then...they fell off my heel after washing. Will have to throw them out. Tsk Tsk"
3.0,descent glasses
3.0,Cups fit weird; they are too tight around the breast and too long at the same time.
3.0,Great product just a little tight around the biceps.
3.0,"Sizes ran way too small. I'd love to have worn them, but they didn't fit."
3.0,"Nice looking shirt for a party, runs small"
3.0,"too wide for me, but qualify is good"
3.0,I love the was they are made  and they are different but I'm afraid they are going to easily come off.One did one day when I changed my top.I have trouble getting one on my right ear
3.0,Queda más pequeño de la talla correspondiente
3.0,Not quite the quality I was hoping for but okay.  Rather stiff on the wrist.
3.0,"Cute but a because it's somewhat smaller than I expected it looks a little tight around her neck. Doesnt have the low hanging easy going flow I was going for. And, of course, cause its tight she immediately took it off when I put it on her to see how it looked.<br /><br />So Im sure it will be an incessant struggle with her pulling it off and me putting it back on when I do decide its outfit day for it.<br /><br /> But she'll ultimately win because suffering for fashion should be a choice right?!?! Lol"
3.0,Not flattering in the waist.
3.0,"I ordered a size Large & they were HUGE on my husband.  He always wears a Sz Large in this type men's pant, but there's no way he can wear these I ordered here.  They're not only too big in the waist, but the crotch area & length.  Very disappointed as this was a Christmas present!!!!  they were supposed to be Hanes Brand."
3.0,"it's way too small for the xxl. I do like the style tho and I gave it 3 stars because instead of buying bigger clothes to fit me......now, I will try to lose weight and actually fit this one."
3.0,Good quality and taking the wear and rear of daily wear for work.  NOT WATERPROOF
3.0,Lil big n awkward
3.0,"I loved that you got a matching wallet, small crossbody purse, and a small clutch or pouch type wristlet as well. You get a lot for the amount money you spend. The quality is decent, I take care of my belongings though so I've never actually had anything fall apart on me. The big tote purse does tend to fold in when it's standing upright so it kind of has a slight crease in the middle."
3.0,"They feel pretty flimsy, definitely made of plastic (even though they are advertised as having glass lenses, they are made of plastic). I will still wear them, but I'm not sure if I would buy from this brand again."
3.0,Broke within a few days. Probably not a good idea to buy for an 8 year old.
3.0,same
3.0,Lovely earrings. Be aware that they are heavy and the lever backs don’t hold. The click-in lock of the back is too loose.
3.0,"It’s pretty but it isn’t cashmere it’s acrylic. Poorly made, arm cuffs are uneven. Overall it fits ok but smaller than expected."
3.0,Dress fits as expected. The only thing is the split is entirely too high and almost show my underwear. This is not the look I was going for.
3.0,The fabric is too pliable. Almost like wearing pajamas.  The seams turns.<br />Nice design and great fit.
3.0,"Im not a fan of the pink tie, but ill still rock it.  It has some sparkle lining and it feels like the material on the pink tie is not as good as the blue checkered design which is more smooth when gliding your hands through it.  These ties are thick in material."
3.0,"material wasn't what i expected, however it was fitting for dress price. ordered XL (im a 12/14)  it fit great in some areas however i felt like the proportions were off as some areas were WAY too large"
3.0,Really cute outfit...well made..nice material.  My grandaughter will be 2 in march. I was expecting the outfit to run small so bought the next size up.. 4-5 years. The outfit received would fit MAYBE a 6 month old. Very small.
3.0,"Nice, for the price. It was not as shiny as the picture shows."
3.0,These are super cute slides but they are very heavy and my 5 year old grandson will not wear them.  They seem to be very durable but if I tell him to put the on I’ll find them in the yard and he’ll be barefoot.<br />They are colorful with a dinosaur on them and arrived quickly but are of no use if he won’t wear them.
3.0,Really  and not a mrsh material but sitll a decent product.  I got them for the zip up feature and these definately can not be dried.
3.0,Wasn’t this shade of purple
3.0,"These were cute but not very fluffy/soft so don't really mold to your ears, they kind of just sit onto of them."
3.0,It's just ok . I'm 5'5&#34; 130lbs and I bought a large. I suppose I could've gotten a medium but  the dress was just ok . Dislike the white buttons and after I wore a few hours the bottom popped off.
3.0,"I normally wear a size 10. Taking the advice of others, I ordered an 11 in these sandals and they fit fine. The arch support is substantial and takes some getting used to. Now that the sandals have broken in a bit I'm enjoying them more. They were somewhat uncomfortable the first several times I wore them."
3.0,"These did not have the indentation for heel that provided more arch support.  I had to return them, but if you just want your basic flat soles, these are fine."
3.0,"Has Assymetrical Rooster-y Crown Thing going on up top, clearly by accident.<br />See I mean to explain I expect the top to be hemisphere, not &#34;unique&#34; or factory 2nd -esque.<br />I am ok barely with it.<br />Catching a dose of smurf rank outs at work, but whatevz.<br />Warm enough and a good wind buffer too."
3.0,"I'm not one of those ""Waaa I can't breathe with a mask on!!"" but it would be nice if this weren't polyester. It clings to your face and it's not a breathable material."
3.0,Bulky and runs small.  Much nicer than some of the other armored clothing Ive tried on.  I did return it because I didn't think Id wear it.  But it was still a good product.
3.0,"While the product looks great, the rigid edges are a little too big for the size and we had to alter them to fit."
3.0,Nice pair of  eyeglass frames but the style did not fit my face well. I returned them.
3.0,"Simple dress,. I ordered a sleeveless one and instead was mailed a dress with sleeves with the arms now too tight, which was the reason for me ordering one without sleeves. All in all a cute simple comfortable wear."
3.0,"I was very excited to order these, but I am super disappointed that one of them came broken. I think they should be shipped wrapped in bubble wrap so this doesnt happen. Other than that they are very nice, but seem kinda small. I wear a 00 g and I’m afraid these might fall out of my ears and get lost."
3.0,polyester...
3.0,Way too big from the upper area and that’s that I am a double D and then way too short and I’m 5’2
3.0,"My wife bought this for her third trimester. She likes the length bc she can wear leggings with it, but otherwise says it’s too large. She ordered a large and says it fits bigger than an XL. She still wears it, she just doesn’t love it, but might order a smaller size after having the baby."
3.0,I did not like the material the pants did not flow like the picture As they would if they were made out of a better quality material. I did not like the quality
3.0,"Chamois is too small; doesn’t fully cover in front or rear. Chamois is very uncomfortable to stand in or walk in. However, in the saddle, there is no discomfort and I bought them to ride in, after all, even if I have to stand or walk in them briefly or for short distances."
3.0,Dress is ok. Definitely nice for the cost.
3.0,These shorts are nice for the price.  Fits as expected.
3.0,"I ordered these shoes because they are cute but the fit was off. One shoe felt 1/2 size smaller so one peep hole was bigger than the other. Two of my toes came out of one shoe and NONE and the other. It looked funny. I really wanted to keep them because they cute. Okay now,the ONE shoe that did fit. Comfort was there, width was fine, the only thing is the strap in the back of the heel hurts. It's stiff,I'm thinking it will soften up a bit with time. I'm fighting myself in ordering them and giving them a second chance. They are cute and look better in person than the photo. If you have the time and patience then I would get them. Good Luck:)"
3.0,opened the bag and the tread was following off returned them the same day I got them. Funny how the return is Free UPS but being shipped is by the amazing crap USPS where they throw and trash your packages. Keep up the great work.........
3.0,"Love the boho look, and love how this shirt looks to seamlessly hang off a shoulder. However, the shirt is low quality and oddly stitched together. Some points are seam inside out and others the correct way, the fabric already feels cheap and the seaming I just could not overlook. The shirt also does not hang off of my shoulder."
3.0,I returned it....too tight.
3.0,I brought as a gift for my best friend
3.0,30 degrees outside and my hands got cold on my quad.
3.0,My spouse loves it
3.0,These feel nice on the inside with a layer of fleece and are extremely long.  A decent set of winter socks for those cold winter days ahead.
3.0,Bit big and wouldn't stay in my mouth
3.0,"Like the scarf, but it's not beige. The beige part is a light blue, just like another review said. Otherwise it's fine. Nice cheap price; lightweight so not overly bulky blanket scarf. Will wash to minimize any fuzzies. Good design for fall."
3.0,Heavy fabric. The sleeves are odd. And the bottom is kinda tight.
3.0,The blouse fit somewhat small.
3.0,"It was okay. Not what I expected, but I got what I paid for it."
3.0,Has a stain on the chest pocket. Thought I spilled something but after I washed the stain was still there. Wasn’t worth returning for a $12 shirt… can hide with a pen in the pocket. Other than that loved the color and shirt fit great.
3.0,"Purchased for our 14 month old. She previously had the typical Carter's brand one but I lost them somewhere! Those fit well to give reference on her head size. I bought the smallest size of these as it is indicated they fit younger children like that. While my daughter loved them when we tried them, they were way too large. They would slide off her face with the slightest of movement.... and she moves. A lot. So we sent them back. If they fit your child, then I say they would be wonderful!"
3.0,"Should be a fun shirt for a casual workout but not good for serious exercise enthusiasts or cosplay.<br /><br />You're not getting big name quality at discount prices, you're getting discount quality at a relatively fair price.  You're probably better off going with something like C9 if you want value.  Not a lot of stretch to the fabric for a compression shirt.  Feels very cheap. Print quality isn't terrible but detail and colors aren't exactly good.<br /><br />I normally wear a S casual t-shirt and  a  L compression shirt if I don't want it too tight.  This in M feels about like a small loose fit casual shirt no compression."
3.0,Similar to silk one i t is not like those that we were buying before but it is good if you does not seen perevious fabrics
3.0,"The size was ok, but the color wasn't as vibrant as I would have liked. They're also kinda cheap looking, but I'll keep them in my jewelry collection."
3.0,I loved these so much when I got them they are a awesome high waist & I ordered another pair but after a month of wear they are stretched out and dont hold shape anymore. Disappointing but for the price not awful.
3.0,"Tarnished quickly, should not have worn in water."
3.0,"The dress is close to ill-fitting.  There are assymetries (sp?) in the cut.  It is wearable, but I don't think I'll be showing it in public in the light of day."
3.0,It fit fine except was really short.
3.0,"I received this lapcloth quicker than was projected!  It matches my black lace hankie to a ""T"" and It is more than big enough to serve as a lapcloth!  However....the material is very sheer.  My hankie is an opaque satin.  This would be fine if I was sitting somewhere at a service and I was already behind another row or pew.  Yet,  being in several instances  where I may be on the front row, unless I already have on something black, it may not serve its intended purpose.  I am considering ordering another one and just sewing them together.  We shall see."
3.0,"These are cute, but they have a fixed headband so if you have a rather large head then these would not be worth getting. They have something in them that I didn't notice in the picture and that is little gold threads or tinsel like strips in them. They are warm and the fur hangs down past my ear lobes, but that won't help if it's windy out. They aren't tight and I tried putting the band on the back of my head and they started sliding down. At least they won't give me a headache. I will recommend them with reservations."
3.0,"It was honestly my fault, I was lured by the number of items vs. the price, so  I though I was smart and I'm such a sucker for deals! But unfortunately I really did get what I paid for. These bands are made of elastic that is hard for adults heads let alone babies heads! My baby was 6 months old when I purchased this and she didn't get to wear them not even once because when I tried them on her, they left red marks on her head. However, if youre not too picky, or your baby's head is small (less the 7 inches in diameter) they look pretty and they arrived in perfect condition. Do not recommend."
3.0,"Nice John-Lennon-like reminder, hippy-like necklace. However, too big, long, and heavy for my neck."
3.0,Cute but somewhat see through. A little more clingy than what is shown in the model
3.0,"I ordered this skirt two sizes larger than I normally wear because I've had problems getting the sizes correct when ordering clothes online.  I think the sizes may be the European size and not US sizes.  However, this is a beautiful skirt.  The ruffle in the front makes the skirt elegant.  The material is stretchy material and I was hoping it would fit.  Just make sure the size is US size before purchasing."
3.0,I was sad it didn't fit because I really liked it a lot.
3.0,"For $20 these are really nice glasses. They look and fit great and are polarized. They came with a hard case, a microfiber bag and cleaning cloth. Great value for the money. The only problem I had was the lens got a scratch on them fairly quickly and I only had a couple of weeks use out of them. I recommend them as a backup or an extra pair to keep in the car but if you’re like me and wear your glasses each and every day, I’m not sure they’ll hold up in the long run."
3.0,"I ordered this blouse to wear unbuttoned and tied at the waist over a tank and thought the large would be more oversized.  It's really short, boxy and fitted though. There was no size chart anywhere so I just guessed and am really disappointed. The material is very STIFF and scratchy too..not what you'd expect from looking at picture and reading reviews.  It looks lightweight but it's certainly NOT. I really think that the sellers are inconsistent with products and we all get something a bit different so it's hard to judge by reviews...double disappoint.  It's too much trouble to return so I will just make it work. Hopefully washing and fabric softener will help with the comfort part.<br />Think twice about this one. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want a fitted scratchy blouse."
3.0,"They are pretty small/tight for my 7 year olds. Maybe better for toddlers.  Thin and breathable, average quality - look like they will fall apart in the wash"
3.0,It was all around weird. I would size up for one. The color was is off and did not come in the greenish color presented. It was also made of a weird material. I had to return it.
3.0,EXTREMELY hard to set.  Lousy instructions!!!!!!!!  Still not working.
3.0,Glad they actually come  in a size that I can wear
3.0,Pretty dress. I am large busted. The dress runs small on top. It is pretty but if you are larger on top like I am you will have a tough time getting a proper fit. Unfortunately I had to return it.
3.0,Made for very small women from Japan!
3.0,"I ordered this dress from 3 vendors on Amazon because I am a tough fit in clothes (and really wanted to look fantastic as Khaleesi this Halloween!). I am 5’1” about 125lbs and hourglass figure (30DDD, small waist, fuller bottom). To be fair - all 3 versions made me look frumpy because the waist could not be pulled tight and the fabric is loose and flowy on all. This version had the cheapest fabric and used a delicate foam material for the belt and shoulders (although slightly stronger than the 550 version). I imagine foam would be soft against my skin but would tear if I pulled tight to show off the small waistline. The bustline was the 2nd most modest (not very plunging) and, although all dresses were very large, this was the 2nd most form fitting yet was boxy. The length was fine. The gold print on the dress is interesting - there are random triangles and stars in the gold cow print (like the 550 version) If you want a basic version of this costume and don’t need to pull the belt tight and maybe are a heavier-set short person - this would be the one of the 3 Amazon versions I’d recommend for you."
3.0,These felt different than the other ones I have got before and they had no give.i gave them toy daughter and she loves them so it was still a good purchase
3.0,Really liked this but too small.
3.0,I bought these for my daughter's bday. I opened and the first and last was the correct size witch was an 8 the middle one was a 6.
3.0,XXL Not true to size.
3.0,I like the design all together<br />I didn’t like that I double checked the size chart which<br />Indicated sizes run small so I order the next size up &amp; they were still to small
3.0,Smaller then we thought
3.0,"Nice summer sweater, but it arrived horn and damaged.  I had the sewing skills to repair, but we couldn't agree on the discounted price. Se la vie!"
3.0,"Pros: very comfy.  I can wear these in the summertime for sure.<br /><br />Cons: definitely not long enough for 5'11.  Fabric is very thin.<br /><br />Overall, these pants will not serve the purpose for which I purchased them (wear to work as a teacher OR wear to the gym for working out) but they are perfect lounge pants at home.  Due to the length, I'll wear sandals.  I'm not disappointed simply because the price was so inexpensive."
3.0,It’s just ok.
3.0,Fabric is ok. I am 5’2” and it’s a little too long.
3.0,It's a super cute swimsuit but I ordered a size large and I think I should have gone up 2 more sizes.  I wish it had fit it would have been my favorite suit.
3.0,This was the best option I could find for a disposable bikini top for spray tanning but the tan lines are not ideal.
3.0,"It’s more of a wrap than an actual shirt, you would absolutely need to pin the v cut or wear a tank underneath!"
3.0,"The rings are true to size per diameter and the gauge. The metal isn't heavy and has a nice shine to it. The disappointing point with these rings is that they easily pop open. With the slightest tug, the ring pops open. It really doesn't take much for them to pop open. If the designers can tweak this issue, these rings would be perfect!"
3.0,This a  very comfortable  sandal. The wedged heel is just right! I’ve worn them for 2 weeks to work and I do a lot of walking. I was saddened to learn after 2 weeks  The bottom is peeling off from the toe.<br /><br />Fix that issue and this would be a great summer sandal. I really like it.
3.0,Only wore these gloves for a couple of hours and the seams in the fingers started coming apart.
3.0,"I loved this bag- it was roomier than you'd perceive it to be, and the color was beautiful. It does NOT do well with daily use, though- the strap easily ripped off one of the loops on the bag, and some of the stitching on the back came undone (but not enough as to where it'd be a problem). For tamer days, though, definitely a good bag for its price! (One like this from Nordstrom is over $1,000, so this was kind of a steal for me.)"
3.0,I'm not sure where all the 5 star reviews came from. I have small wrists and literally have to have it as tight as it will go. Which makes it difficult to put on and take off daily. So people with small wrists beware!
3.0,"Decent enough for a Halloween costume, but if you’re wanting to use these multiple times, they very well may disintegrate into more ashes than Tom Holland did In Infinity War.<br />——<br />Also when I ordered these the first time, I got two left hands. You guys had one job."
3.0,"The mustache came in and is the correct size and color. On the thinner side and is attached to mesh. Came without adhesive. So, not sure how I should attach it for my costume. Overall, decent purchase."
3.0,"Pretty ring, although the gold looks too gold...meaning not normal.  I am betting it will flake off.  The ring is pretty though."
3.0,"The fit, color and feel of the fabric were all exactly what I was looking for. I have to wear dark gray polos to work and it's been hard finding ones that fit well and that I also like the look of. Most of them are really ugly, so I was happy with this one.<br />Except.<br />It snags! I don't even know if this is happening while I'm wearing it or if it's happening in the wash, but after only 3 or 4 wears and washes, both of the shirts I bought have little snags in them that are creating very obvious horizontal lines all over. They look terrible. I don't think I can buy this shirt again which is such a bummer because I liked it so much otherwise."
3.0,The product definitely works but it's still kind of a pain in the ass.
3.0,Didn’t really glow very bright.
3.0,But the chain was too long. One of the tentacles broke almost immediately. I got what I paid for but I would try my luck with Hot Topic next time on this one.
3.0,Not functional at all. Don’t waist your time. Does not cover full belly and has a gap. Too tight and not stretchy at all.
3.0,"The writing is so small on the charm, you can not see what it says."
3.0,Not as high quality as I had expected.
3.0,"These are great to wear under pants. However, you absolutely must secure them or it will be a disaster. I bought calf compression sleeves which do the job great. I wouldn’t even think to use something loose to secure these. Once you sweat a little the slide right down. But they do look great when you have them on secured well."
3.0,Blouse is not long enough for me to wear with leggings and is about half a size smaller than expected.
3.0,"I was really excited for these, unfortunately they are not for wide feet and ended up giving them away."
3.0,the quality is the same as his worth
3.0,"I don’t know how to feel about this clothe, it looks really nice but the color come off on the shirt at the end of the night the white shirt was red. The material was so cheep I don’t think it will survive washing. It was kind of shrinking when it comes but I wasn’t able to iron it The material is really bad specially the skirt. Over all if you want it for special occasion I think will work for that. I love the shirt but it’s ruined by the skirt the red color."
3.0,I love these pants!  They are warm and look nice.  They run big and after wearing them for an hour or so they stretch out and become bigger.  I spent most of the night pulling them up.  I am 5'5&#34; 172 lbs.  I typically wear a size (L) or a 12.  I probably should have bought the (M). I wore them on a cold night and they were very cozy
3.0,Had to super glue the design on sandal's after the 1 time wearing them.
3.0,"I bought the big since I had previously bought a tall set that while they shrunk the length was way too long (I am 6'3&#34; - 196 lbs) and a little big in  circumference.  I thought the big would  be just the right length and would be just right in circumference after shrinkage. The shrinkage worked great on the length but it shrunk a little too much in circumference so that I cannot wear it.  I do wish Big/Tall would sell pre shrunk tee shirts.  After buying two sets of each, neither of which worked out in good sizes after shrinkage, I think I cannot  afford to buy more B/T tee shirts (the shirt construction is excellent - just what I was looking for - especially the hems which do not turn up on themselves after washing)."
3.0,There’s a gap where the slash is inserted upon wearing it.
3.0,"Nice pants but it's a bit tight, feels like it may rip if I bend over......."
3.0,"These are cute earrings. However, some of them were messed up regarding to the pictures being smudged."
3.0,The product is too tight and I am a thin person
3.0,The watch seems fine but the box was in such bad condition that I couldn`t give it away as a gift.
3.0,I love this dress but I bought it to big. I don’t think they had her size. So hopefully she’ll fit right into it next Christmas
3.0,"I have this shirt in black and love it so I wanted the same one in another color. The maroon shirt is a different fabric for some odd reason, and is low-quality and wrinkly."
3.0,Too small specially in the arms!
3.0,Too small (and I bought a Large size). Beautiful top though. I'll be returning it.
3.0,"The look is perfect but the size is really small. I usually wear small to medium (34 B), since other reviews said it runs small got it in large and still I wish it was and xl but that size was not oferd when I bought it. Ended up giving it away because it would look better if it was lose."
3.0,"This would get five stars except the rough part of the velcro was sticking into my foot and making it very uncomfortable. I eventually solved that by filing it down with a nail file. The memory foam makes these quite comfortable otherwise. The soles, however, are of a substance that tends to rub off my hardwood floors and also does not slide, so I find myself nearly tripping unless I am very careful about picking up my feet."
3.0,"Classy, sheer shirt. Yes, it’s a little bit see-through. Wear a camisole underneath and you’ll be ok. If it weren’t so see-though I’d have given 5 stars, but having to double up is sort of irritating. That said, it IS a cute top and the material is nice feeling and it fit well."
3.0,Sweater isn’t bad however the reviews are accurate . Not good quality . I wear at home when it’s really cold .
3.0,"I don't know, this product might be good for the price but it is really too large, so I recommend buying at least one size smaller than your usual one.  moreover, it does not live long since the materials is very thin."
3.0,"The colors are not varied to the extent as shown in the picture.  The product arrived intact, no missing stones, however the stones are all a bright/royal blue, None of the sky blue.and those 'white' stones are actually inlay rhinestones.  If I hold the necklace up to the light, I can see that different types/paints were used on what was to be the lighter sky-blue intended stones, but in 'normal' light, they're just swirls in the same blue as the rest.  Not a high dollar expense, and my expectations were not high, but I do want what I order to arrive looking like the picture.<br /><br />If you're looking for a royal blue necklace with a few rhinestone embedded accents, this works.  I'll give it an OK, but what I really wanted was the versatility of different blue colors that unfortunately I didn't get,"
3.0,"Ok, but the buckle broke after 6 months."
3.0,Way too big. Not true to size. Material is very thin. Only reason why I didn't return them is because my son already washed them.
3.0,"I gave these pants 5 stars before. They fit perfectly, were the right length and felt comfortable. BUT, after I washed them a couple times, the waistband lost its shape. The waistband was no longer flat but wrinkled up. Uncomfortable."
3.0,fits way too tight but it is a good product with the exception of the fit
3.0,The vest isn’t well fitted. Kind of boxy but works for warmer snow play
3.0,Looked nice but too small for my cell phone
3.0,"The adjustable size doesn’t take into account the metal. So the smallest it goes is actually 21cm, 17cm for the cord and 4cm for the metal part. It’s nice and I like it, but it’s too big."
3.0,Looks somewhat cheap. Fit was small
3.0,Cute jacket. Will work for 20 degree or warmer weather probably. I always wear an XL but ordered 2x as recommended. It’s huge on me. I’m pear shaped & it’s giant around the middle & bottom. Normally wear a size 18 in jeans.
3.0,The metal is bendable and not as sturdy in person as in the picture. I would have liked a sturdier setting.
3.0,"This is a loosely fitting top, not tight. It's very soft and a good but borning basic. I found the material surprisingly warm for a soft, thin fabric. The mesh is a nice detail but not very noticeable."
3.0,"Purchased for my wife. She likes the design and it arrived in a timely manner, however, it is a bit large and the fixed clip seems not to be adjustable.  In the slightest breeze it would blow off of her head. Again, she likes the design of the visor, but as it fits too loosely with no way to adjust it's snugness, I can't give it more than a three star review."
3.0,"Didn't realize it was see-through, so I returned it (I'd ordered it for a Halloween costume). If I hadn't cared about that, it would have been fine."
3.0,"Little on the small side, I have average size hand/arms"
3.0,"cant be worn with a toe sock. foot has a tendency to slide, particularly when you wear it with a sock."
3.0,Very cute but runs much larger than expected
3.0,cute and It fits well but a pressed  edge line remains in chubby baby feet
3.0,Colir is ture rose gold
3.0,Oakley Sunglasses golf polo fit more like an 2XL - -but nice polo.
3.0,Hard to set up.
3.0,Runs small have too go up one size  most of my dresses were medium but have to order large nice dress really like it
3.0,so pretty - fall out so easily...
3.0,"These days, wherever I go I have to wear a face mask.  These face mask are ok.  They do cover my face and neck well and keeps my face warm.  The only issue is that the strings to keep the face mask on without falling off is a little uncomfortable after 10 minutes of wearing it.  If I loosen it, it will fall slip off my face.  So you will feel the string on your face while wearing it.  Does what it suppose to do.  It's ok.  I'll keep it and will use it once a while."
3.0,"Ok oakley holbrook imitations, for the price you can't beat it"
3.0,"If you're someone who struggles with the arm flab and has muscular arms, I wouldn't recommend this product, it's too tight on the bicept area."
3.0,"Gloves are good, but I put them on at the Rocky Mountain National Park and the zip fell apart in the first use."
3.0,"I picked these up alongside a few other pairs of &#34;high-end&#34; socks for a backpacking trip through southeast asia. After reading through nearly a hundred different sock reviews (exciting I know), I finally decided on my final 3 pairs:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00B5J8E94 Darn Tough Vermont Men's Merino Wool No-Show Light Cushion Athletic Socks, White/Gray, Large]]<br />[[ASIN:B009SN7FHQ Drymax Run Lite-Mesh Mini Crew Socks, Black/Grey, Large]]<br />[[ASIN:B0023TRMM0 Thorlo Men's Experia CoolMax Micro  Mini Crew Sock, White/Black, Large]]<br /><br />I was trying to find a supersock that could:<br />1. Withstand daily use through hot and humid climates<br />2. Was comfortable enough to do large amounts of walking including mountain trekking, rock climbing, and other active sports<br />3. Endure long periods of use without smelling<br />4. Wash and dry fairly quickly/easily<br />5. Wick away moisture to keep your feet dry and cool<br /><br />It's now been over 1 year since I purchased these socks and since then they've been used extensively throughout all types of climates throughout the world. Here's how these socks have ranked out over time:<br /><br />COMFORT:<br />1st - Thorlo Experia - This sock has padding in all the right places and the form fitting design makes the sock hug right to your foot. Probably the most comfortable sock I've ever worn.<br />2nd - Darn Tough Wool - These socks are soft, thick, and comfortable. They offer plenty of padding when walking for extended periods of time. They do feel a bit bulkier than the Thorlos though, so they're better suited for cold weather than active use<br />3rd - Drymax Run - The material in these just doesn't have the same softness or padding as the other socks. The fit isn't quite as form fitting, and the cushioning feel thin when walking for extended periods of time<br /><br />DURABILITY: This category is a bit tough because all three soc have held up well over time. I still have yet to find a single hole, but I have noticed some thinning in a few areas.<br />1st - Darn Tough - These socks are darn tough. No kidding. They are very thick and have a durable construction. No doubt these socks can last through long periods of use and abuse.<br />2nd - Drymax - A bit thinner than the Darn Tough, but still resilient none the less. The elasticity of the sock did seem to wear out a bit over time though, so they felt a bit looser after owning them for a long time<br />3rd - Thorlo Experia - It's tough to rank this one third, because I still have yet to wear this pair out. The only reason for this ranking is that the material in these socks is thinner than the other two. However, since these socks are padded in the toe and heel, these likely won't be wearing out any faster than the other two.<br /><br />COOLING ABILITY:<br />1st - Thorlo Experia - The sock's thin material came through as a major plus in this category. These socks are both incredibly comfortable and incredibly breathable. They do a great job of wicking away moisture and keeping your feet cool.<br />2nd - Drymax - These socks also do a fair job of keeping your feet cool and dry, but their thicker design means they feel less breathable than the Thorlos - as a result, they just don't offer the same level of comfort and cool<br />3rd - Darn Tough - I was actually a bit disappointed with this sock. Due to the sock's thick construction, it doesn't feel nearly as breathable doesn't do a very good job of keeping your feet cool.<br /><br />DRY FACTOR:<br />1st - Dry Max - Once again the sock manages to live up to its name. These socks were able to dry faster than the other two and were easiest to wash and dry than the competitors.<br />2nd - Thorlo - These socks also did a very good job of drying. The main body of the sock would actually dry out faster than the DryMax. However, the padded heel and toe would take a bit longer due to their thickness.<br />3rd - Darn Tough - Very poor performance in this category. When these socks get wet, they stay wet. Whenever I would sink-wash these socks, it would sometimes take almost a full 24 hours before they were completely dry.<br /><br />SMELL FACTOR:<br />1st - Thorlo Experia - The socks thin construction plays to their favor again in this category. Because they are thin and breathable, the socks are able to ventilate better than the others, allowing for less build-up of bad odors.<br />2nd - DryMax - These socks did a decent job at remaining odor-free. Because of their faster drying ability, they were good at preventing the build up of foul odors, and were very easy to wash and dry. The didn't ventilate quite as well as the Thorlos though.<br />3rd - Darn Tough - Again, poor performance in this category. Unfortunately, moisture wasn't the only thing that they held onto. Due to their thicker construction, they did a much better job of retaining bad odors - even after sink washing them. I eventually had to give up on trying to wash them, and just hid them at the bottom of my bag until I could get them to a proper laundry machine.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />1st - Thorlo Experia - This sock gave the best overall performance by far. These ended being my go-to sock both while traveling and when heading to the gym at home. They offer exceptional comfort and cooling ability, and despite the 3rd place durability ranking, they are built to last. I would hands down recommend these over the other two brands for both travel and athletic performance.<br />2nd - Who cares? - Do you really want to buy the second best sock? Just buy three pairs of Thorlos and save yourself the headache of having to read any more nail-biting reviews about socks."
3.0,Very cute. The only reason I gave this a three is because the ribbon that ties the tail on frayed immediately.
3.0,"These socks are wonderful in that the come in 48 pairs. However, the first wash elastic acted as though they were worn every day for a lifetime. The socks run big so they slide down in the boot but they are soft and do keep feet warm. After the third or fourth wash on came a part at the seams."
3.0,It's a nice and large bag that can hold a lot of stuff and that's what I love about it but I didn't expect it to be so plastic-like.
3.0,Difficult to use!  A screwdriver works better!
3.0,Had to cut the holes a little larger so my daughter could get them over her foot for acro class after ballet/tap.
3.0,Poor construction. It smelled horrible when I opened the package. It fit well and looked nice so i washed it as per instructions on label. A seam on the lining came apart and a seam on one of the pockets also unraveled.
3.0,Amazing I love it along with many other.<br /><br />Great for a wedding or a school gathering or date night. I found it very comfortable and great to wear with a pair of cute sandals.
3.0,Top fits fine. Bottoms are not full coverage. Kinda give me a wedge when I walk.
3.0,Looks longer than it actually is
3.0,"Cute and funny, but definitely runs small. Order 2 sizes larger than your normal. I went a size up and glad I did."
3.0,"The shirt is made out of spandex wich is fine , but the front of it isn't as dark as in the picture, it more of a dark redish brown than black"
3.0,"The stems on the plugs are a bit too long and stick out of the ears, if u don't keep pushing them back in... Also, would have liked a larger variety of colors."
3.0,"It's not bad.  Looks sort of cheap, but I felt okay when I wore it."
3.0,Cute pattern! But that’s where it ends. Dress fabric is super stiff and wrinkles the second u sit. I wanted to love it but sadly I do not. Also after washing it the dye faded in some areas.
3.0,"The swim suit part did have some problems. The buttons are a bit loose and one of them came off. One of the bra pads wasn’t sewn causing it to move all around when wearing it. The kimono piece had dried blue ink dye. I could possibly try to fix everything that’s been mentioned before, but I wish there wasn’t so much issues. What I’ve seen with reviewers is go up a size so I did and it fits fine. The only problem is I’m big-chested so it looks weird. I’m definitely wearing something under the bra piece to support my chest. Not really worth 36 dollars."
3.0,Another item that did not go under a real industrial inspection. Left cuff is missing some stitching on the inside.
3.0,I like but when I recieved the glasses right side come off the lent no scroll I have to improvement and buy scroll but no work property as you can see. I call and text to this Companie and never have answers at all.
3.0,"I bought 2 of these little clutch purses and love them!  However, one came with a wristlet and the other did not.. otherwise I would have given these fun bags a 5 star rating."
3.0,The purse is great but a little small
3.0,"Don’t buy these if you have pets. While they are comfortable, they collect lint and fur like crazy!"
3.0,"Purchased for a photo shoot - Normally, I'm a small in everything. This was waaaaay tooooo small. Bust area was about 6&quot; too small. I am a 34DD. My suggestion: if you want it to close as the photo shows - purchase 2 sizes up. I returned and ordered 2 sizes up - waiting on new arrival. Also the ribbon to tie arrive damaged - you can't tie it because it tears off. I believe the lace is too thin &amp; not fitted on to the piece properly."
3.0,I like the color and the weight but honestly it's super cheaply made upon closer inspection. You could probably go to a Joanne fabric store and get a yard of rayon or polyester/cotton mix for like $5 and see it yourself.
3.0,"I used this product for my ears. One earring did arrive broke. So, I had to fix it with glue."
3.0,These fit super cute and the design is adorable. But after washing and drying they no longer fit. And they’re wrinkly as ever. I know I can steam them but more heat may shrink them more. Disappointed I can’t wear them anymore.
3.0,"The item was beautiful! However, it did not work for an all white event it was ivory.  there is one hook so you don't have to hold it around the shoulders.  The size was nice it almost looked like a coat.  I tried it on with my bridal white jumpsuit, but it was not close to white.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were white."
3.0,The high pitched noise coming from the battery lack is real .<br />And kind of annoying when it’s quiet around .<br />Also prevents anyone from using it at full strength light .
3.0,Not long enough and too bright. Silver looks better.
3.0,"This sweatshirt is comfortable, however it has shown some wear after just a few washes."
3.0,"I ordered the mask as New from the seller Flower Sea9 and had the order fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />I was a bit disturbed when I pulled the mask out from the bag it came in and it appeared to come with tiny hairs on the inside of the mask as if maybe someone had worn it previously or maybe it's hair coming from people along the production of the mask. Just in case, I washed it all over with soap and water. Other than that, it's a nice mask."
3.0,"After reading reviews, I decided to size up from my usual medium to x-large.  It is still a bit too small.  However, this shirt is pretty good quality and the colors are true to what is depicted in the product picture."
3.0,"size XXL is a size 12, that is too small for USA so I had to return the dress because i'm a size 16<br /><br /> In the USA XL -16 and XXL is a size 18"
3.0,"Very comfy and looks professional, but developed a hole in the seam of the crotch after 2 wears easily repairable, but I don't think these are going to hold up long"
3.0,"I love the color of this dress! Shorter than I thought it would be, but may be perfect for someone who doesn’t wear dresses below the knee."
3.0,They don't stay on my hair
3.0,"Decent for the price, nothing to rave about. I’ve seen better from other brands. Good for lounging not heavy lifting, or sweating."
3.0,Very attractive but small fitting.
3.0,"Nice airy sundress. My only issue with this is why, why, why would anyone sew the seam down the front of this instead of the back (yes, I checked where the tag is located). If I wear it at all, I may wear it backwards."
3.0,Pretty for little girls but the adhesive agent is not strong enough to me...will fall off quickly
3.0,I would have like the fabric to feel thicker not so sheer
3.0,"Dress would be really pretty if it fit properly. The bodice is built for a very strangely proportioned person....I ordered a large and my chest is just exploding out of it but I'm pretty average being a 36-C. There are seams in places that make it impossible to fit properly, given the material is non-stretch."
3.0,Costume quality product. Much too large for a child. Adult size.
3.0,"Not the greatest quality. Striped pieces on chest do not lay flat, bundle together looking messy"
3.0,Too big for me... looked a bit fake.
3.0,"I bought a size bigger because majority of the reviews said the suit ran small, but it was way to big!!! I'm 5'2"" 125 lbs.<br />It looked really cute hopefully they can exchange for a small."
3.0,I thought they would be tighter. would go a size down than what I got
3.0,The front of the shirt was too short. If it was the length of the back of the shirt it would actually fit instead of having your stomach hanging out. The pants on the other hand fit perfectly. So the 3 stars are for the pants.
3.0,"The premises of these 'Wear Over Prescription Glasses&#34; sunglasses is great, but, unfortunately for me, these glasses do not fit really well over my prescription glasses.<br />I bought these glasses to replace a 10-year old pair of &#34;Bobster&#34; brand, 'Over Prescription Glasses' sunglasses.<br />When these new glasses arrived, I quickly realized that these glasses DO NOT FIT as well over my prescription glasses as my old &#34;Bobster #BOG201Y sunglasses fit.  Since these glasses do not fit as well as my old pair of 'Bobsters', the wind bothers my eyes when it blows around these glasses while I am riding my Harley.<br />I am keeping these glasses, because 'THEY ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING', but, if/when i can find a Pair of Bobsters #GOG201Y glasses, I will no longer wear these glasses."
3.0,Wallet is okay but a very snug fit for money plus a card
3.0,No experience
3.0,"It's a really nice band & well made, but it's just a tiny bit too wide and extremely difficult to get on & off the watch, plus one of the pins malfunctioned the 2nd time I wire it and the little lever thing broke so I had to cut the silicone to get to the pin and then bend the pin with some needle nose pliers to get the band back off scratching my watch... not really worth it."
3.0,It was hit with the kids
3.0,"I love the design of the bracelet but I wanted a full 8 inch bracelet and it is only 7.5.  The back of it is not polished as are all my others from different places. The clasp is truly my biggest problem. This is more of a necklace type latching and it sits high off the bracelet. Because it is a lever/knob clasp, it is hard to put on especially as it is not 8 inches. I have had the bracelet for 3 days and it  has come unlatched twice, once in the car and it fell between the seat and the counsel and happily onto a piece of hard advertisement so I saw it. Then this evening while watching TV it again came unlatched and I am sure it is because of the type of latching as well has the lever portion sticking up higher. I am not going to return it but spend some additional money to have a jeweler put a lobster clasp on it. . Also I find no little tag as are on my other silver bracelets that say it is Sterling. I have to just take the mfg's word for it.  Just be wary of the clasp catching on your clothes and you loosing the bracelet.  Looks fine!"
3.0,"I bought this dress in a small and XL to have a mother daughter dress with my daughter. Very cute on her, very short and unflattering on me. The length was the exact same on XS and XL.<br />This dress will flatter a very short person with an A or B cup."
3.0,The insert can be thick and much longer.
3.0,So cute on my little man. I had a black pair which he broke same brand which he broke after weeks of having them. I bought another just because of the price and delivery time. It is summer and I want his eyes to be protected. Maybe because he is 7months and knows he can take them off so he does do and tries to chew them and I'm scared he will poke himself with them. I will be purchasing one of the rubber ones as soon as he fits into them. These have little screws like adult glasses do and since I know one pair broke I don't let him wear them unless he is facing me in the stroller or sitting in front of me.
3.0,"These are comfortable and very warm. I like the color and the material, inside soft fleece, outside thick wool.<br />But they don't look very flattering at all, rather orthopedic, like a cast or similar."
3.0,"These were smaller than I had expected, and was under the impression that they'd be a little small on my wide-ish feet. I was hoping that they'd stretch well over my ankles, but they just barely reach. I wear a standard size 8.5 shoe, medium width."
3.0,I bought the wrong strap the cured end doest fit
3.0,Very cute earrings. I bought them to match my rain cloud out fit. They looked amazing with the whole fit but they broke when I first tried to put them on. It was slightly annoying but luckily I had super glue on hand in my purse. Now they're fine 🙂
3.0,"If you wear these on your natural waist, you will have a ""Y"" in the front. If you pull them down below your navel, you'll still see bunching in the front. Poor design."
3.0,"I travel for work and leisure 4-5 times a year and packing cubes and the only way to pack are with cubes!  The color was beautiful and it was very light. Unfortunately I found the material of these too thin and flimsy, I prefer cubes with more rigid sides as they hold up better. Ended up giving these to my sister and bought another set from different brand."
3.0,"It's cute. It's fairly lightweight. Makes a charming keychain. The watch, which is what it was bought for is not as charming. The hinge is awkward and hard for my mother's hands to operate. We've had it only a few months and already it is no longer keeping time. Could be the battery but that seems doubtful."
3.0,Fits as expected but the material wrinkles a lot.
3.0,Too small for my hips. I am a size 12 or large.
3.0,"The piercings are great, as I expected. We’ll see if they stayed screwed on. I’m giving 3 stars because the company didn’t send me everything I ordered. They actually literally sent an empty baggy that should have contained two more rings. So that’s not cool."
3.0,"a lil snug, but REALLY cool. Oh and the color of the fur is more brown tan gray, so I spray painted black... Worked great"
3.0,They are a little bigger than I thought but all in all they are okay.
3.0,Ordered a small but they were too big on me and I wasnt too fond of the material.
3.0,"Received in timely manner and the material is very durable, but the 2nd day using it I went to hang purse on the back of a chair and the hook on the strap broke off and my pocketbook fell to the floor."
3.0,Sizing runs small so if your kid is anything larger then a small sized 9-12 year old they won’t fit in it very long. Bags ok not great quality
3.0,Cute but I’d suggest ordering 2 sizes up
3.0,Looks gold plated. Too yellow gold.
3.0,"I bought as a gift and my friend loves it. Although, it does look cheap."
3.0,Nice.pin but small and took forever
3.0,"The picture puts you under the influence that you review hearts for every size, you don’t. Other than that, I’m enjoying my kit. They organized everything by sizes for you. WHICH I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR!!!"
3.0,"We travel a lot and needed a &#34;one holder for all&#34; our hotel, airline and cruise line member cards."
3.0,"Updated:<br />After a couple months the hardware on the bag is beginning to some wear and the gold plating is rubbing off on the clasp. For the price, and the reputation of Kate Spade products, I expected the bag to hold up a little better. The seller was great but the bag could be better.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />Very cute and well constructed."
3.0,"Only about sports. I wish it had more info about Detriot, not just sport."
3.0,"It as expected. Unfortunately, I squeezed my large size into a medium size and didn't get to eat all day! Buy your regular size."
3.0,"Was for children for sure did not see that ,my bad .I do have plenty of grand daughters so will order more for them .I would like one adult size for me now ."
3.0,"stretchy and comfortable but a bit cheap looking. Large, unattractive strap adjuster."
3.0,Very average dress. It’s also see through in the sun. Wouldn’t recommend.
3.0,"Cheap fabric, plastic like. It makes you sweat"
3.0,Very sheer and the fit is a little weird. I definitely could not wear this alone. I purchased a cheap white slip to wear with this and now it is appropriate to wear in public. Without the slip you would definitely see my bra and through the dress (even with nude underwear).
3.0,"Came with all pieces. Color in person is a little off, but overall good"
3.0,"I ordered this mat since I was moving to a smaller desk and couldn't use my old gaming mat. I went on Amazon and saw that this mat was only 30 inches in length and thought that it would be perfect since I was down-sizing. However, that was not the case. When I opened up the package and put it on my desk, the mat looked a little longer than 30 inches so I measured it. Despite being advertised as 30 inches in length on Amazon, the mat I received was actually 35 inches in length. This is weird since another user complained that the mat they received was only 30 inches.<br /><br />Since I couldn't use the mat, I had to return it. Buying this item seems like it is a waste of time since the manufacturer cannot get the mat to be measured the right length. I do not recommend this mouse pad whether you want a 30 inch or 35 inch because you might get the one that you don't want.<br /><br />Aside from the sizing error, the mouse pad does look okay. The quality isn't the greatest and seems like it should only be priced at about $5-10 and not the full $16."
3.0,Love the color and style but not true to size
3.0,"This pants are cute, but the fabric feels rough. And they look dirty..:("
3.0,"One of the earrings was broken upon receipt... I went and bought lever backs and switched them out...other than that, excellent"
3.0,Fits small across the chest
3.0,We like them but they are only printed on one side.  Otherwise they are a great size and color.  Thank you Lisa Barnett
3.0,I would definitely size up if you’re more than a B cup!
3.0,"They recommended one size smaller then usual. So I ordered medium size, but they got me a large size. So it was too big for me."
3.0,"I have been purchasing a number of overall/rompers for summer of late and as many are designed like overalls, a simple top is needed beneath them. Thus begins numerous reviews of varied tops I’ve purchased, and their respective overalls in the hopes that my experiences will help others may informed choices.<br /><br />I will rate each item of attire, purchased with the following criteria with the intention of better informing future customers.<br /><br />Size:<br />Fabric:<br />Construction:<br />Color (true to image):<br />Washability/ease of care:<br /><br />With this knit T-shirt/tank/top, I found the following to be true.<br /><br />Size:  I found this top to fit rather boxy. The side panels do have a small slit which causes the top to have a more polished appearance. This polished look does allow the top to be worn partially tucked in or loose. Thiss top ran nicely well to size if somewhat boxy in appearance. A smaller/slighter woman might find this top overly bulky. I wear Med/Lg - and order large (if I wish to wear them looser or over leggings). This top worked well concerning both areas even though the heavier weight fabric is bulky when worn partially tucked. Although it is not my most attractive top, it fits as expected. I recommend buyers purchase their usual size.<br /><br />Fabric: This fabric is a polyester/cotton blend and while it washed up well, it was borderline too much thicker weight polyester for my liking. Cotton drapes softer in my experience and this top did not drape easily. Polyester/cotton weaves also tend to run warm especially in the summer in my opinion,  so this top most likely will not be worn during 100 degree days. The fabric itself, has an interesting inside weave, that of French terry as can be seen in the 2nd image (the color is not true in the lighter colored image as ‘flash’ engaged during this shot, please see the 2nd image for true color-the one with the black stylus in the mid-lower right corner ). While the fabric content is spot on, please remember poly/cotton is not 100% cotton. It does not have cotton’s breathability/drapeability. Order accordingly.<br /><br />Construction: Well constructed as can partially seen in the image. No loose threads or unseen seams were found in this top, even after washing. A positive, to be sure. I have no issues regarding construction. Seams are smooth and stitched neatly presented.<br /><br />Color (true to image): This is where my opinion of and rating lowered. The image shown online is that of an almost chambray/faded, heather blue color with a slight texture look of well worn fabric. This top was neither. As can be seen in the 1st image, the color top I received is one of a light blue-green. The texture and color is smooth, there is no evidence of the washed out/heathered look shown in the description. While color differences are somewhat understandable, texture differences are not. I ordered this top expecting it to look as the image shown, with its heathered or “washed faded light denim look”  not one that with a solid color in appearance. Note: the blue square in the quilt is a washed out/worn chambray blue, the stylus a solid black. The top presents as a blue-green, not a true pale blue as pictured.<br /><br />Washability: This top washed well the 1st time. It was washed in cold water with 5 minutes dryer/hanging damp to dry. I cannot comment as to longevity of this top but I will edit this review if anything changes.<br /><br />All in all, given the fact that the color was off, the boxy cut & this poly/cotton top presenting as heavier than expected, I hesitate to recommend this top. I have purchased other sleeveless t-shirt style tops which are cooler in terms of temperature and truer to color than this top was/is. It’s difficult enough purchasing items online, without discovering your item is not true to the image shown. I expect items I have ordered to match descriptions/images shown.<br /><br />Note: I strive to write honest, frank, true to life reviews in order for future readers to make informed purchases. I do not and will not write false reviews for items that do not meet up to my expectations or needs. My reviews are my own opinion, honest and to the point."
3.0,Runs very small.<br />Material thin and very stretchy.
3.0,"The mask is only one size. One size is suppose to fit all, and though if my six year old is standing still it will stay up, that is never the case. It is too big. I asked if they had any recommendations on what I can do to fix this. They seem to reply to their questions often, but I received no reply. Return!"
3.0,So cute but black runner band fell off after first normal wear
3.0,I love the purse it’s everything i wanted... i wish the coin purse didn’t dangle... but it’s not a problem now! The reason i gave this 3 stars instead of 5 is the smell ! It’s horrible! As soon as i took it out of the bag it had a horrible smell and it won’t go away!
3.0,Should be longer
3.0,I ordered a med first and it was too tight then got the large and it was perfect. I typically wear xs or s but a med in PB. I havent washed yet and hope to be able to keep it clean without putting it  inthe wash due to the other reviews about color bleed from the buttons
3.0,"Very interesting style and fit. The material is VERY thick for a dress with such a summery print. Sizing is off. The large fits a woman with a larger bust. 38C. However, the waist is disproportionately small. It seems like it would fit a woman with a waist of about 29”. You’ll see in one of the photos that there was a gap by about 4” where I couldn’t even zip the dress. Hips, well the dress is an “a line” and fits any size hip. Overall, pretty dress but not practical material above 60 degrees F."
3.0,Not 10mm wide
3.0,The ball falls off too easily.Glad it came with two but I’m so worried I’ll lose the ball again I haven’t worn it in a long time...
3.0,"I really love the look of these, but one if the pendants is missing stones"
3.0,"I enjoyed these glasses, they look nice and seemed to be sturdy. Unfortunately they metal rim that held the lens in place fell out a bit early in its life span, not so much so that I wouldn't purchase due to the great price alone but it would have been nice to have for a little while longer."
3.0,The soft pink was just too see thru for my liking. A darker color would have been best
3.0,I ORDERED A 2 X( I WHERE A SIZE 2 X AND MOST OF MY JACKETS ARE 2 X) AND THIS JACKET WAS NICE BUT UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT FIT...
3.0,Super cute but the material is thin and it runs small
3.0,"I got this pretty necklace thinking that it would look like the picture I'll dazzling beady you look sharp wearing it with anything in your wardrobe. Boy was I wrong, this piece was another disaster looking piece. If only they came like they what did the picture I would be a happy person. Because I do love some necklaces.  I know it's costume but still the same when you get it you expect it to look like it does in the picture.<br /><br />This was another disappointment in the books. I would not recommend this necklace anyone, in fact it is still brand new and I am thinking of returning it because of false representation of not getting what the picture shows"
3.0,The coat is very nice but the size runs big also if you touch the coat many times your hands gets darker.
3.0,"print a little smaller and harder to read than expected, but still cute"
3.0,"I have other compression leggings but these were a tad too tight in the waist and thighs. These also did not pass the squat test, unfortunately. Would definitely have fallen victim to the &#34;free underwear viewing&#34; if I had worn these to the gym on leg day. I ended up returning this product."
3.0,"These are comfortable but thinner fabric than I expected.  I don't think I would wear this with any short tops that didn't cover my butt.  I imagine they are see through when stretched like bending over and such.  They fit well and look attractive on.  I do prefer the thicker more compression style fit around the hips with pockets, so I probably would order these again, but I will keep these in the rotation.  The color is nice a nd the bootcut flair provides the business causal look I go for ate work with tunic style tops.  It you prefer shorter tops, I would recommend selecting a different pair than these."
3.0,"On a scale of one to ten, I will give this a 7. I don't love it, but I don't hate it either , so I wear it occassionally."
3.0,I guess this style is just not for me but I can work with it.
3.0,"El producto de ve bien,pero viene muy arrugado dentro del empaque,he buscado la manera de quitarle las arrugas! Tendré que pedir otro similar de otro brand"
3.0,It is not over the shoulder it looks like a regular sweater. It’s too small for me so I just gave it to a friend.
3.0,Great concept but very difficult to see out of. It would be better if they had a non flimsy shield. This one you can’t see clearly out of and causes me to get dizzy.
3.0,Seams went a lil quickly
3.0,It was ok I will wear it. I just thought it would be a little better quality.
3.0,5'8 207lb DDD36 and the top didn't fall as much as I wanted it too so maybe if I got a size bigger it would have looked cuter<br />Kinda See through in the butt and they remind me more of a P.J material<br /><br />Deffently will only wear it to bed cause it is comfy
3.0,"Material not as expected, really cheap material"
3.0,"I got these for my nine year old son. I'd say for his size they're a little small, but not too bad just for Christmas, they'll do. If you're considering these I'd recommend one size bigger. The flap in the back just for show too, not a real one. For the price I wouldn't buy these, you can get something similar at your local ""Mart"" store for less."
3.0,"Super cute! But the are really big, I love the oversized glasses look but these are BIG. They fit a larger more oval face better."
3.0,These pants don't clinch well at the waist. I find myself pulling them up constantly.
3.0,"Looks great, but has a really large circumference, too big for my teenagers wrist."
3.0,"Overall nice earrings, but it took quite sometime before I received them."
3.0,never really use it. too hard to put on
3.0,Great jacket. Tight fit.
3.0,I was excited to get these shoes. But the quality is not great. Keeping it because I really wanted a pair of white boots.
3.0,It's ok. Like the chains but the lock looks cheap. It'll do nicely for the price.
3.0,This is a beautiful dress and it has a lot of 'give' so it would be forgiving if you got a smaller size AND if the waist stretched at all...but it doesn't!  As big as it was we were unable to wriggle into it due to the tight no-give stitching at the waist.  We sent it back because going to the tailor to restitch it seemed foolish.
3.0,They are fun but really heavy. Can't wear more than several hours.
3.0,"The colors are a little off, I got a red instead of maroon like in the picture and the plastic part that locks to the watch feels cheaply made hope they do hold."
3.0,"This is a nice top but it was a bit to large for me. I purchased size small and went by the size chart. I'm 5'2, 126lbs, 32D and I should have purchased an xsnall instead. It doesn't fit like the model and is a bit to boxy for my liking. The quality is nice and shirt is thick, not see through at all. I'm returning for the xsnall."
3.0,"Light material, ok belts. The belts does not slide easily on the buckle as you try to to tighten and get to the correct hole."
3.0,"CONTEXT<br />I had a bunch of mismatched clothing items for pajamas and when I decided to move to a capsule wardrobe, I decided to get rid of it all and purchase matching sets.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Honestly, having matching PJs feels really good. As funny as it sounds, I feel really put together when I wear it. LOL.<br />- The shorts are very comfortable!<br />- I like to wear my bottoms high-waisted and I am petite (4' 11""), so these are perfect for that, but are not too short.<br /><br />CONS<br />- The ""rise and grind"" text on the shirt is poorly done. Rather than clean lines on the font, they are sadly quite jagged. :(<br />- The top is a bit small for my liking.<br />- The boat neck makes the shirt fit a little weird, so I try to use it as an off-shoulder instead.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />While these PJs are cute and I do like them, I highly prefer the shorts to the top and am looking for a replacement top to still match the shorts."
3.0,This is super cute BUT it’s misspelled. It should just read A instead of An. To be fair it is that way in the featured picture. They were great about refunding though.
3.0,I love the earrings but this is my second set and both have had one earring back break off!!!
3.0,"It was much larger than I expected.  I was buying it as a Christmas gift for my friend, fortunately my daughter loved it and I was able to give it to her.  I like it but it was just way too big!"
3.0,Nice looking shoe and comfortable
3.0,Nice necklace but hard to clasp
3.0,"The keychain ended up being smaller than I thought it would be. Otherwise, nice. Just small."
3.0,Small & way to Short in front  ..so I took it to a Alterations place to have  Material added the length in front & a little more in the waist & love it now
3.0,"The sunglasses are okay for the price. The left hinge doesn't function properly on the pair I received. Other than that, they are lightweight. The bag that comes with the glasses is good.<br /><br />The lenses are not very dark so other people can see your eyes during a conversation. Overall good pair of glasses for the price."
3.0,Way longer than expected. I'm not short either.
3.0,This was way too big and I am tall!!
3.0,Extremely thin my wife says
3.0,Love the pattern but kind of tight. Very soft better than Lularoe
3.0,Not what I expected. Did like that it was like a booklet at the end.
3.0,"Somewhat small but, still good buy."
3.0,"This is a lovely key chain in my opinion.I honestly adore its design.Unfortunately,just under two weeks after receiving it a part of the filigree detached from the outermost portion of the butterfly's wing.It hasn't taken much abuse since it's been kept in a small pocket in my purse.Overall I wouldn't expect this to hold up for very long."
3.0,"Disappointed, am I.<br /><br />What I ordered is not exactly what I received. Two features stood out from the photos: low rise, and narrow in the middle (between legs). While they are low rise (as so many are), they're just as wide in the middle as any, touching both legs.<br /><br />Also, inside the mailing bag was another bag, indicating the size I ordered: ""M"" (for medium). Then, inside that each pair was individually bagged, instead indicating ""S"" (for small, and tiny they were!). And so back they went."
3.0,"I am 5'2"" 140lbs 36D and the Medium fits perfect. The fabric is very thin and cheap but well sewn.  Length drops down to the knee. I got the navy blue dress with pink/light blue flower pattern and it started to fade after one wash. Cold water, hang dry. After the second wash it has faded to the point that it seems I have worn it many times. I think this would be a great dress for a summer event but don't expect to wear it very many times since it fades so quickly. That was a disappointment. Had I known that it would be good for one event I still would have bought it since it is a decent price and looked great on me. Fit perfectly in all the right places.  I will still wear it as a run to the store dress or a house dress...but not to a gathering, just too faded now. The other dress patterns that have a white background and then flowers on it fade also but you can't tell nearly as much, I will buy more of those."
3.0,It is a very nice tie but it is not as bright as the picture indicates.
3.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 150 lbs, 34 DD chest and bought the XL based on reviews. The shirt is not as pictured-- the slit in the front is only a 1-2 inches, while in the picture it is at least 4 inches, the color is navy, while I thought it was black, the sleeves don't have the slits and don't bunch they are a button down sleeve and fall perfectly at the wrists with 2 buttons. For me, the shirt fits well, but looks like a button down I could buy at a discount store."
3.0,"They look great, but one has fallen apart after very little wear. I do like the look so hopefully the others last longer."
3.0,"No parece original además que viene muy amplia la talla M, le queda más a un L"
3.0,"I've now purchased and have either kept or returned 4 pairs of these: 2 of the Heather (Hunter Green and Grey), Black, and Space dyed Magenta. I've got some pieces that I LOVE from 90 Degree by Reflex and some that have fallen flat.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The Heathers are nice and thick. Not compression, but not see through. They're listed as 87% Nylon 13% Spandex. They do show sweat rather easily so be aware if you're doing something super sweaty like Cycle.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Black...the fit was horrible, the cut was off and they're the material that attracts lint faster than you can say &#34;but I just lint brushed them&#34;.<br /><br />The Meh:<br />I just received the Magenta space dye (90% Polyester 10% Spandex) while the waist band is nice and thick, the capris are thinner and the calf area runs much tighter with the hips and thighs running too large. These WILL show undies if you bend over (tested with black solid ones). They're a much more vibrant and vivid color in person and they're really pretty, but the feel of these is a much cheaper fabric quality.They're too stretchy almost, and are very thin. I'll probably keep them though since they're loud and don't turn white when doing squats (my pet peeve are leggings backed with white that change colors when you move in any way). They appear to be colorfast as well."
3.0,Well made. Looks really nice.
3.0,I liked the jacket but had return it. It ran small. I’ll order another.
3.0,Not quite as warm as I thought
3.0,"The detailing is great, way better than expected. I was surprised with how large it was. When trying to put it on, the space to fit my head through is too tight. And it keeps riding down so I can't see out of it."
3.0,"Great pendant however the chain broke the day we got it, a bit of a cheaper chain."
3.0,Love the hoodie it’s just not the color represented in the pic of the item. More neon pink than I expected so it didn’t match what I needed it for
3.0,Super cute but shrunk way too fast after I washed it a few times!!
3.0,Didnt quite look like the picture.  Returned.
3.0,"I looked at ~10 of the Amazon recommended options when searching for a silicon ring to wear this summer as my pregnant fingers no longer fit in my rings!  I wanted something thin and jewelry colored, so I purchased the rose gold, bronze, silver, black pack of these.  They are so cheap looking - they remind me of jewelry you played with as a little kid.  However, I think it was $7.99 for the pack? So...you get what you pay for! It would look just as good to wrap a thin hair tie around your finger a few times.  In hindsight, I would have just bit the bullet and bought a $30 Qalo from my local jewelry store."
3.0,Sleeves are way too long. Color was not as dark as the photo. Buttons felt like they’ll pop apart. Meh.
3.0,"Material could be much better, but they get the job done."
3.0,The color is beautiful but the fabric isn't so great...loses its shape. Recommend going down one size as mine is very big.  (I'm always a medium and it's big.)
3.0,"These thangs are teeeeeenie. I have size 11.5 feet (because I have large genitals) and these bad boys barely fit on my tootsies. They ok, I guess. Whatever, they're socks."
3.0,Es lindo pero es muy pequeño
3.0,Cute top/bra but with my belly I couldn't do it... If you've the confidence go for it girl!
3.0,"Very thin material ,they feel more like lingerie"
3.0,This item seems more designed for a smaller adult or child than the listing depicts.  The cut of the size of the apron itself doesn't cover the wearer as presented. Don't trust the sizing examples shown.
3.0,It's almost like one of those necklaces you'd get out of a quarter machine.
3.0,"The product itself is way to large. I usually were an XL (Carheart, Under Armour, North Face, etc) and XXL in Nike. This product I would say to order at least one size smaller. As big as the product was, I could definitely go large or maybe even medium. The sweatshirt is thick and warm. The quality is very good for the price. You just have to remember that the sizes run more like big & tall sizes."
3.0,The strap's metal clip broke off the moment I tried to snap it on.<br />I have been using it without the strap anyway.
3.0,"Unfortunately after wearing for about a month and a half , I developed Plantar Fasciitis due to no arch support. Purchased another slipper with arch support and the pain is almost gone after wearing the new slipper with support."
3.0,I've only had this purse for about 2 weeks and the strap has already broke.  I wouldn't recommend this purse.
3.0,Excellent quality but extremely too large
3.0,I wore this for about 2 weeks and the starfish fell off. Besides that it was really cute.
3.0,"The color isn’t anywhere near the blue jean color shown. It’s a strange and unattractive mix of slate blue grey and dirty teal. It’s so weird, in fact, that other than white, absolutely nothing looks reasonable with it. They were inexpensive so I’m keeping them, and I’ll probably have a little fun with Rit dye at some point. Super comfortable."
3.0,"Not bad at all,...but rubs small on me...please work on the length..the beauty of jumpsuit us the length..tnks"
3.0,too small- not sure if I would like them if they fit correctly
3.0,"very, very small"
3.0,"I love the light blue jean color. I like them... However, they are really itchy and make my butt disappear!! That's why I'm giving them 3 stars."
3.0,"Not great quality. The eyes look like they could fall off in a strong wind, but it served it's &#34;stupid hat&#34; purpose. Color is true to image."
3.0,They run very small. For example a person who usually wears a Medium with a snug fit I would recommend an Extra Large.
3.0,Bought these for my daughter for her birthday! They are true to size but I only received 3 pairs not 4!!! I'm missing the black ones!!
3.0,Chain for Necklace is really short...it's like a choker
3.0,"the flip sequins are great, colors accurate on the computer.  my daughter says the slippers are cozy but the actual shoe is a little roomy causing her foot to slip off the back sometimes.  she's a size 3.5, i bought the 2/3 because i figured the 4/5 would be swimming on her.  her heel sits about 1-2cm from the edge of the slipper, she tells me the foot bed is comfortable.  i would recommend if you're looking for a cute slipper to lounge around the house."
3.0,I have a small wrist and hands but yet the ring portion can only fit my ring or pinky finger and the bracelet is tight/uncomfortable on my wrist. I'm trying to figure out who I can give it to or what I wrap around because it's scratchy. Shame because it's beautiful but I bought it mainly for the necklace and bracelet
3.0,Size was very small. Quality was good and writing was perfect
3.0,"This is a very cute septum clicker, but after a while, it started smelling like metal and when removed, there was green around the hinges. It's cute, but it's not good for long-term wear."
3.0,Cute but they tore and the unraveled the first time I put them on.
3.0,This was a reorder for me.  I was expecting exactly the same glasses.  They were very very close but not identical.  The frames were more square than the picture shows.  That may be fine for some people but that wasn’t what I wanted.
3.0,"picture is better...they don't stay up, do not care for the slouchy look &#34;Personally&#34; just my own preference."
3.0,Not a lot of support. A liitlebig
3.0,"It’s a very decent saber and the hilt design is purely gorgeous with sturdy materials. The feel of the hilt has a nice texture for grip and the exposed crystal just makes the design even more flashy! The sound fonts sound like extremely well made as the eco smooth swing sounds almost as good for being smooth swing. The blade colour is nice and bright while it has some good effects such as stable, pulse, and unstable. This saber is well done considering it’s price!"
3.0,"Very nice looking laces, but don't get them wet...even a little. The wax will wash right off. Maybe that's why they come as a 2-pack"
3.0,Bought these 2 sizes bigger than what I would normally wear and they were still too small.  Returns were easy and I got a full refund.
3.0,No pego uno cuando pido ropa 😰
3.0,"Shirt fit as expected- ordered a large, fit like a large. Body of the shirt is a nice material, but the sleeves and neck are a weird synthetic. The color ( ordered the red/black plaid with deer silhouette) was more like a fluorescent orange/red. The white backing on the cowl neck makes arranging the neck more tedious. Does have nice side-seam pockets, and sleeves are a good length). Cute casual top, don’t know how it will look after washed.<br />Update Feb 2019 - I ended up putting a few stitches on the cowl to hide the white backing and help it sit well. Works! Has washed well, but the deer decal is showing wear (I use the washer & dryer)."
3.0,Just a little smaller than expected but all and all these are fine maybe just size up one.
3.0,The only downside to the dress was that the straps were way too long and caused the dress to look frumpy. A quick needle and thread fixed that.
3.0,"Nice fit, material okay fit..."
3.0,"It is very, very thin. You can see everything underneath. I will be keeping it because it was a low price."
3.0,"This bag looks nice, it’s roomy and I’ve got several compliments on it. I like the cross body feature. However the handles on one side with the hardware are shabbily made a broke within the 2nd week of use. I’m hoping to use some strong glue to fix it."
3.0,"The fabric felt quite plastic-y, and I didn’t like that the white of the back of the fabric showed through when it was stretched"
3.0,"likee the style but not the fabric weight, very thin and had a sheen, not what I was looking for exactly"
3.0,"Rose-gold-colored chain is and looks lightweight, though stones are sparkly. Pulling the clasp to back of my neck the first time I put it on pulled a link out of its neighbor, and I don’t have two needle-nosed pliers to fix it. Will return."
3.0,"This is a very cute, thin sweat shirt.  I love the design but it fits small.  Definitely buy a size up."
3.0,I put on several coats. It did not make the hat stiffer and stained the crown
3.0,When I first tried this on I thought that they were going to work pretty well and I’ve had this brand before. Unfortunately they really are not a great third I can’t explain exactly why but would not purchase again. The denim is decent quality but certainly not premium.
3.0,Size is considerably smaller than other size 7 rings that my wife owns. Looks and feels as expected. Center stone is a little lighter than the Marketing Photo.
3.0,"Small was too large, normally I would buy a small or medium.  And one arm hole was oddly larger than the other."
3.0,"Ordered size 9.5 and it was way too big (fit like a 10.5). Sent those back and got a size 9; still way too big. So sent them back and am now waiting on size 8.5.  I'm sure that once I get a proper fit, I could rate it a 5 star."
3.0,I like wearing these rings with t-shirts but they tend to slide and I’m constantly having to reposition them so they don’t slide completely off.
3.0,Just smaller than expected
3.0,Design is good but item quality is poor.
3.0,Cheap construction.  I'm beginning to realize...don't buy anything from Allegra K.  Buy G2 instead.  :/  Looks cute in the picture though.
3.0,Shrunk after one wash in cold water.  Not impressed but liked the style. Maybe next time I'll air dry.
3.0,"The band itself I have no problem with, it's more to do with the way the Samsung designed the strap connectors. These connectors are very prone to pressure (unlike Samsung OEM bands) and the Gear Fit 2 will come off your wrist. However, that's a small price to pay for actually having the device on my wrist! I'm happy overall, if the connectors were a little tighter, it'd be another star."
3.0,"It’s not flattening and is very snug tight but stretchy . I use them under shirts now because they show my muffin fat (don’t laugh) the material is soft and clings, is fitted. Just hope this review helps someone."
3.0,"I am absolutely addicted to Lily and Laura bracelets. They're a bit pricey for me (especially since I want a large collection of them), so I was excited when I found these at a fraction of the cost. Due to a shipping/delivery issue (with the post office, not the seller), I received my bracelets much later than expected and ended up returning one set of the two that I ordered. The seller made this process quick and easy.<br /><br />The pros:<br />Much more affordable than L&L bracelets<br />The seller was super-easy to work with.<br />Perfect sizing.<br />They can be worn so many ways.<br /><br />The cons:<br />The colors and patterns you receive are left up to chance.<br />The quality isn't quite as good as the L&L bracelets. As an example, in a solid color bracelet you will often see a bead or two that are a different color or shade."
3.0,Is very heavy on your head for a long time.
3.0,Cute but HUGE. I’m 5’3 and 140lb and got a medium and it was seriously massive. Not sure I’m gonna get a small just returned it cause small might come out too big as well.
3.0,Like the colors and design. Bought another one with the same design on it but a different style and it was a little big also.
3.0,"I like these but I didn’t get 21 butterflies, only got 20. I’m big on reading descriptions and getting exactly what I paid for. If they can send me the 1 butterfly I’m missing then I would give them 5 stars."
3.0,"The price is right, but the links are already falling off even while being careful with it."
3.0,Writing/item was much smaller than depicted in the picture. Was a gift.
3.0,The fabric is nice and silky. The bra itself is a bit uncomfortable and a bit small. I think if I had ordered a size larger then this would be just fine.
3.0,Item as decribed and arrived as expected
3.0,Nice but smaller than I anticipated
3.0,"Had to return this item. Quality was what I expected (as in not that great but ok for the price) as I have another pair of vinyl boots made by Pleaser. However if your calf is over 16inches, I do not recommend. My calves are 17inch and I could get them laced up but the tongue is so narrow that I have to lace them extra tight so skin wouldn't show. Not only was this uncomfortable but it was an obvious strain on the hooks and I doubt they would have lasted an hour. I estimate a 16in calf would fit decently. So good luck!"
3.0,Doesn't fit any of my sunglasses but will hold on to them in case I get different glasses.
3.0,"Love the fit of this. Super comfortable. Handy pockets. Great length - hits right about my knees (I’m 5’7”). But after wearing and washing a few times, I noticed the top half seems to be getting more and more sheer. Like no matter what color undergarments I had, you could see them. So I wear a tank top underneath now. I bought it in black."
3.0,"I love how it looks but when I picked it up to try to put it on it’s broke immediately. Easy fix, but annoying."
3.0,Product is okay for the price. Delivery took 27 days.
3.0,To baggy.
3.0,The buckle that I received does not look like the one that I received. The color is totally different.
3.0,"Love the shirt, shipping took weeks"
3.0,Nice quality but colors way off
3.0,"This was much smaller than expected. Wires for the heating are a bit thick/uncomfortable given the thin nature of the vest itself. It does look and feel well made but it is thin. For anything more than an early autumn evening you would want the heating element. Does not come with its own, so keep that in mind. I feel anything but a very small heating pack would really weight down the pocket, again due to the very light nature of the piece."
3.0,"These pants are way bigger than I expected. I still like them and think they have a good style and I like all the additional pockets. I typically wear a 30-30 and the waist fits me fine on the ones I ordered however the length is so long that I have to pull them up over my belly button to get them to look right. I think I'll keep them though. It's not a deal-breaker.  Also, delivery took forever."
3.0,It looks nice but it is not to help keep you warm. I got it for my son and he can only wear it for style. He says it does not keep him warm.
3.0,"I love this shirt. The color, material and ruffles were perfect but the damn thing is entirely too short.  I wear a 14/16 on top, 38DDD bra size I ordered the XL.  I love this shirt so much I’m gonna find a wear to wear it with high waist jeans or something or maybe by another one so I can add more material lol 😂"
3.0,"It had a tone of languages but when you shine the light, they don't come out clearly"
3.0,"These dog tags are of great quality, but they're very thick (much thicker than real dog tags). However the chain is absolutely too short for the average human. I had to use the chain from my &#34;real&#34; dog tags too fit around my head.<br /><br />Definitely consider the small size of the chain before purchasing!"
3.0,review said buy regular fit but it is tighter fit then expected....i would buy a larger size....
3.0,"Replaced twice. Got large, too small. Got xL fit tight but &#34;worked&#34;"
3.0,"Very pretty, but definitely pink and not “rose gold” as advertised."
3.0,Seems like a good quality mask. Just did not fit properly. Perfect for females or guys with a smaller face. Is 4 layers so the nose area may seem rough/thick.
3.0,Fit a little goofy but do the trick
3.0,"Purchased a 6 month old size for my son, (he's 4 month 16 pounds) it ran REALLY small... OR maybe my son is just too BIG (LOL) either way, it's an absolutely adorable outfit. Fabric is breezy and light.<br />My ONLY 2 problems were:-<br />1. I wish the buttons were snapped<br />2. I wish the buttons went all the way down."
3.0,"The fabric is cute, but you basically have to be flat-chested to wear this shirt. The color is gorgeous though, wish it had fit me better."
3.0,It definitely has a big face and is best suited for teenagers.  For $5 it's worth it and fits about any size wrist.  Scratch what I said before... the battery went dead after 2 days.  I chucked it b/c a replacement was more expensive than the watch itself.
3.0,I'm sure my daughter will like them; they are pretty but the material is cheap looking.
3.0,"I usually wear a small in shirts, and 26-28 in pants. I ordered a size small and the crotch turns into a major camel toe. I am also 5'6/115 pounds and somehow this made me look really fat because of the placement of the waist line (way too high)"
3.0,"Neat looking item and cheap, but you get what you pay for. Low quality material and poor stitching. Came folded horribly misshapen and even ironing it repeatedly couldn't quite straighten it out."
3.0,"What i like was it was the exact skirt loved it , just didn't fit as expected!"
3.0,"The shirt is a fine rayon, brightly colored and lightweight, with a breast pocket - exactly as we like them.  However, the 4XL size doesn't fit around the belly of my 4XL guy (although other 4XL shirts do).  It does fit the shoulders, so if your 4XLer has a lean body, you're probably good to go.<br /><br />Too bad, we were otherwise so pleased with this shirt!"
3.0,Quality is average. Only one trip and the small bag is already falling apart. In fact has a hole on the side. The other two are doing fine so far.
3.0,They arrived on time. There was also the amount that was stated.  They fit my piercing but pulled out to easily.  Would not stay in the piercing and was swallowed.
3.0,Pockets are very poor quality
3.0,The tank tops are fine and seem like decent quality but they run so small. I wish I would’ve ordered XL when I’m typically a L. They will prob end up collecting dust in my wardrobe
3.0,"This is a beautiful ring. I never take it off. I’m wearing it as a wedding ring. I wish it would come in half sizes. I wear a 7.5 on my ring finger and got it in an 8. Because it’s slightly big, it slipped off my fingers after washing my hands and hit the bathroom tile and it chipped the turquoise. Bummer! Now it’s not available in the solid turquoise."
3.0,I usually fit into a medium for women but this looks like it was made for men
3.0,Came with one of the snap ins damaged... Don't want to go through the hassle of returning it...
3.0,GOOD BAG BUT WORKMANSHIP A LITTLE ROUGH
3.0,Not a lot of sparkle.
3.0,"I think these were so cute! they fit very well and I love the colors. I was a little disappointed because on one of the jumpers the snaps will not stay snapped. my son is only able to use one. so I am a little disappointed about that. otherwise If all the snaps worked I would give this a 5 star,"
3.0,Fits like a shirt ...not a dress
3.0,"I bought as a gift.  I was disappointed that it was not orange with a white T.  It was black with an orange T.  It was too late to exchange, I needed a gift.  He didn't know any better so liked what I gave him.  I was disappointed."
3.0,"Purchased and this looked so cute on, but the first time I tried it on, one of the under wires popped out.  Sent back for refund, just wished  it was constructed better"
3.0,Not big enough for a size 13 foot.  Fall down too short/small
3.0,"Not for larger chested women and provided no support. Kinda flattened my chest actually. Also, the drapery in the front was split and wasn't like the picture where it covered. Instead it should way more cleavage that I was wanting. The print was the same though. Cute, but not really what I was expecting."
3.0,"Loved the color, material but couldn't get them to my hips. Was supposed to be<br />one size fits all. Should be a larger size."
3.0,"Great gift. Recipient loved it, but it broke within a year."
3.0,"Pretty earrings; however, they just weren't what I was looking for to wear on my wedding."
3.0,fit is a little tight even after multiple washings
3.0,"So, the band itself is scratchy plastic and is super terrible. But the adapter pieces are small and awesome for making your own custom bands! So, 3 star review for being both terrible and also useful when removing the part that’s terrible."
3.0,Not exactly what i expected  .tthe gold color does Look cheap . It is ok if you aré looping for something informal
3.0,"I love this dress so much, but it runs EXTREMELY small!"
3.0,The top looks nice enough. I ordered one size smaller in black and it fits fine. Unfortunately the dye bleeds onto my bra every time I wear it.
3.0,It’s a nice hat... but it’s not a large according to their description. Too small to fit my head comfortably.
3.0,"I love the way they look in one, however after having it 30 min on is so painful to keep on."
3.0,Didn't like the &#34;cone boob&#34; fit.
3.0,"Comfy soft shirt, just don’t dry."
3.0,"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly &#34;pretty&#34; aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad."
3.0,"I purchased this mask because it looks as if it is a deep green velvet with the dragonfly on it, so pretty.  It also looks as if it is the smooth type, face formed type.  Instead it is a silky polyester material that is dark green in the center and fades out to a lighter green on the edge.  There are 2 folds similar to the surgical mask style.  The dragonfly is colorful however.  The style is fine if you were expecting it, I was not.  I fell in love with the picture, not so much with what it actually is."
3.0,Cute and perfect size but didn't come with the smaller makeup looking bad just the big tote so the descriptionis wrong.
3.0,They are thin. Wears as PJs ...too thin to wear in public
3.0,This shirt is an adorable shape but it is definitely tight around the booty area!!! I can tell the fabric won't hold up well either!!!
3.0,My shoe size is closer to &#34;8&#34; than to &#34;9&#34; and the shoes are still too small.  They went into the &#34;Purple Heart&#34; or St. Vincent's collection re-allocator.  I think some re-evaluation of size comparison procedures should be looked into.
3.0,Bought this in March 2016.  At 1st I really liked it but it just broke.  Only had it 3 months.
3.0,"It is a nice looking helmet but crushed slightly on one side. Also, chin piece was crushed in and seems to want to hold that shape now. It appears the box it came in was just to small to fit helmet properly? I'm going to try and fix it on my own."
3.0,"These are strictly spa slippers, not slipper slippers. Learning curve for me. So I am giving them to my daughter as she has pedi's all the time. They are nice for that!"
3.0,Pant are very thin
3.0,Putting away for Xmas...to be determined
3.0,Great. Overall the stand adidas youth &#34;feeling&#34; is ok but she. It comes to size is extremely big. Get a smaller size then you ideally are. (Id recommend)
3.0,They were a bit tight ( i have a slightly big head )  more adjustability would be nice
3.0,"didn't really look like the picture, seems lower quality than shown, did arrive on time."
3.0,Same vampire teeth from the 80s. Nothing has changed. They do the job.
3.0,When this shirt arrived I was actually pretty confused because I didn’t remember ordering this only to find out that I did but it’s just completely different than I was expecting. The shirt itself feels great and is a great fit but I was expecting a tan shirt based on the pictures and it’s literally white. It’s extremely see through which is annoying because I didn’t want to have to wear an undershirt. The screen printing portion of the shirt is very badly done. Don’t get me wrong it looks great from far away but once you get close you can see how badly distorted it is. Like someone downloaded a fuzzy image from google and hit print. The white portion of the words has a speckled brown dye in it which I think is it their way to make it look rustic but it honestly just looks like dirt or mold inside of the letters. I would still wear it with a denim jacket or something but I definitely would not go out of my way to purchase this shirt again. The quality is just not there.
3.0,Came with a hole in the armpit
3.0,It was thinner than I expected but it works for what I need
3.0,"Size of the dress fit, it was too tight in the arms."
3.0,They are a little bigger than I thought. Took forever to get here- almost 2 months.
3.0,I would have rated this much higher had they used a more 'sweatshirt' like material.  the print however was nice.
3.0,Like a lot. Just wished it was a tad bit longer
3.0,Product as pictured .
3.0,Arm bands to big
3.0,"Fits as expected, I got a Large and I wear a size 14. They should describe this color as peach.  I thought it would be light brown or beige ."
3.0,"I should have read the product description more closely regarding mat size. On my slightly oversized Matthew ends of the Velcro lack two or three inches of even meeting. Not sure how secure it would be on even a standard sized mat.<br />Attractive, seems like ok quality, but I am not sure I understand the logic of how the ends are put together. I don’t like it."
3.0,"Feels good on the face, but snug fit. Pulls on your ears."
3.0,Like the skirt but fit small and tried to exchange and couldn’t so tried to return but cost was more than the price of skirt.
3.0,I didnt take a pic but I should have. Came in cheezy box and looked like i bought them at the dollar store
3.0,"The purse is cute & I really would like to use this, but attachment for the straps is EXTREMELY awkward, so I will no longer be using the purse."
3.0,Too high priced for the quality of the product. My Grandson absolutely loved them tho! I guess that's worth the price.. and the wait!!!
3.0,Cute but cheaply made. arrived broken. One of the chain loops was open so the three strands were not all attached. I was able to put back together but I don't see it lasting long. Daughter is happy with the necklace though.
3.0,"The top on this is nice. It covered my size DDD/F boobies and felt fairly stable. The bottoms are completely unlined. So, it created a serious camel toe. The search for a comfortable modest swimsuit continues..."
3.0,I bought this for my hiking trip in New Mexico in the mountains outside of Santa Fe. I Loved it for the first 3 nights. And then some how during the 4th night of my 7 day trip of wearing it the glue holding the speakers came lose and it was all over then.<br /><br />For total disclosure I sleep sideways in my hammock. And I may have rubbed the speakers off. But it was useless once you could not keep the speakers by your ears during the night. They kept moving around in the beanie.
3.0,It was nice ... couldn’t wear it as planned. The strap wasn’t sown well from<br />Belt to tulle
3.0,A gift! A little small
3.0,"it came very wrinkled and smelled kind of weird . I bought this for a costume several months age. After flipping it upside down and inside out and keeping it next to my shower, the steam took away a lot of the wrinkles and has given it more poof"
3.0,fabric very thin.
3.0,"The dress was cute but the arms were too tight. Also, there was a strong chemical smell, so beware."
3.0,Really not that flattering. Maybe it's the pockets or where they hit - I feel like it's tough to screw up a maxi dress but somehow this one accomplishes that.
3.0,Don't like it. Too thin.
3.0,gets a little tangled and only looks good with hair parted down the middle but very pretty
3.0,Mot sewed correctly
3.0,The shoes are not as nice as they look in the picture. They go too far up on the leg and that makes them look less attractive and very cheap looking. Hoping my husband will like them for date night at home.
3.0,"Its not steel boned. It does fit pretty well (2x but ordered a 4 as per sizing chart). I have a long torso, so the fit isn't perfect. It pokes at times. It does make my figure look nicer so I'll keep using it. Probably wouldn't order the same one again."
3.0,"Material is nice, but shorts are short, short! I don't like having to dig my shorts out of my ass! If you're used wearing thongs, you'll be happy with these shorts!"
3.0,"I usually wear a 36/38 D bra but ordered a 38 DD….it barely goes around my chest and the girls are so close to spilling out the front.  If you have extra “flesh” at your sides, this bra does nothing to disguise it or hold it in.<br />I don’t recommend this bra for a person that needs a cup size larger than a small C."
3.0,"These are quite similar in shape to my lost Adidas Polarized sunglasses.<br />Here are the Pros : Not Expensive, Polarized.<br />Cons: Too Brown, Frame doesn't look high quality.<br /><br />Would I buy one again : No"
3.0,Waaaaayyy too small.  I needed like 2 sizes bigger
3.0,"Pretty,but poor quality."
3.0,I received the slippers and I had purchased to wear in hospital. When I put them on yesterday at hospital I thought they felt funny.  Looked at them and they were both LEFT slippers.  Somewhere out there is a package with both RIGHT slippers.  I can still wear these and just need these to get around as I had total knee replacement and cannot send back
3.0,Intended to use as a board short liner. Seemed like a quality product. Just not comfortable enough for me.
3.0,These earring are nice but the magnets do not hold as well as what we thought they would. They tend to fall off. Some are stronger than others. The roses are a little too heavy. You have to find a matching pair of strong back magnets so you don't loose an earring. Be careful so you don't loose one. We had ordered the other set of gemstone earrings and have plenty of magnets to choose from.
3.0,The wig was not adjustable and the hand guards/gloves were different sizes. Also the stockings that came with the outfit wouldn't stay up so I had to improvise with a pair of boots. All in all this was my 1st cosplay and even though there were many issues with the pieces I loved the outcome.
3.0,The belts are pretty but they are very flimsy.
3.0,"This looked great and fit fine (I have very small wrists), but the silver-tone plating wears off almost immediately. First, the little ball on the hook turned copper, then the edges, then the inside. The outside is still okay and if you do not look closely, you won't notice that it looks like it is ten-years old rather than ten days."
3.0,"It's a fairly cheap piece of jewelry, but doesn't come across as too cheap. I have fairly small hands so I need to alter it a touch. It seems like it would fit average size hands lol It looks pretty cool though!"
3.0,I really like this dress. It’s beautiful and it fits great. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because some of the tiny black polka dots came off after I wore it for the first time.
3.0,"The dres It's OK, but you sent me another dress, with no sleeves.....and it runs small.....my wife is 36-28-39 and the dress does not fall correctly on the hip....and almost can not close in the back......."
3.0,"It’s like a hit or miss when you order online. This was a miss one because the color wasn’t as advertised. I thought I was getting a burgundy red but it was more like an orange red and the gut is a little irregular but I didn’t have the time to return it. So I’m stuck with it so that’s why I say surprise me because you never know what you are going to get when shopping online. You take a chance that the product is represented as advertised meaning color, fabric, and quality for the price. That’s the chance you take when shopping online. Good Luck and Happy Shopping!"
3.0,They don't work as well as the manufactured ones you have to stick them out your window to get them to work they do not work from inside the car
3.0,"I love the necklace and im a huge fan of Fairy Tail, I wouldn't recommend buying this though unless you have some backup chain hooks though."
3.0,stitching coming apart in som areas
3.0,These are functional although I wish they weren't as long...using to hold my sweaters more closed.  One of them came missing a rhinestone so I'm not sure how long they'll last - but they do look nice.
3.0,"shame, as I wanted to keep this, it's cute... but again, with clothing made in china, they never seem to accommodate for arm width, even when it's an XL size.  this was supposed to be one size, that fits L-XL (they say), but pretty small all over.  make more than 'one-size-fits-all'!"
3.0,"I have been wearing X large clothes for many years and they always fit fine.  These shorts are really nice, but they are simply too tight.  I returned them."
3.0,Very cute design but they are extremely small.
3.0,"These aren't really designed for girls with bottoms. Overall, I'm an average size (5'4"", 135 lbs). The waist is comfortable, and I like the length, but they are really tight around my butt, creating a tightness in the fabric that just doesn't look right."
3.0,Fitted great but could not stand the material. Super thin! Had to return the dress just because of the material as the dress was for my holiday party and it would of been too cold!!! Super cute design just would of been great if a different material.
3.0,Color isn’t fading
3.0,They look great but the soles are very slippery. Not good for kids.
3.0,"Thin material, the crotch area is weird but decent for the price"
3.0,zipper don't work well.  Like the coat nice and warm if you wear sweater underneath. zipper gets stuck at the bottom
3.0,"Daughter was pleased with the item.  She explained Curved studs were hard to insert, which I didn't know. Item arrived promptly."
3.0,Beautiful color fit as expected I would have give it a 5-star if it wasn't on the thin side.
3.0,It didn't stretch at all around the seams. Seems like it was made small.
3.0,Super cute but the buttons made my boobs look huge. I’m a 36c cup :(
3.0,True to image. Well made.
3.0,It was much bigger than pictured. Then add the handle and its even bigger. Sent it back.
3.0,Too big and very cheap material but my daughter does like it.
3.0,"The material used is very synthetic and not comfortable or stretchy at all. It’s like pleather, cheap and tight and smells of chemicals. I’m pretty sure this was not made in the USA."
3.0,When gloves arent available these are just OK. Will not be reordering.
3.0,"Nice, but I have a short torso and its getting a bit up there, not recommended for regular to longer torsos. Color is a lot darker than n the picture, more dark tan than the light pink color it appears"
3.0,"This dress is good for the price. The material is thick, and not transparent. I’m 5’2” and it came to just below my knee, so if you’re also short I’d plan to wear at least 3” heels. The sleeve comes to just over my elbow, and is slightly loose. The sash around the waist is a little bit weird, and not as flattering for a full chest as I thought it might be; more like a sling than a belt!"
3.0,Broke apart and was difficult to wear.  But I used the ornaments to make other pieces of jewelry.
3.0,I love the look of this bracelet but it has an strong odor of leather that you can't get rid of
3.0,This sweater is good quality but the sleeves are too short. It’s also not as loose fitting as you’d imagine.
3.0,It's nice but not the fabric I was expecting according to the pictures. It runs about a size bigger but it's still a nice two piece.
3.0,Nice simple bracelet! My wife likes it. There were issues with shipping but the customer service was almost the best part
3.0,"Cute swimsuit, love the style, just runs a little small."
3.0,The fabric is very soft but a bit thin. Do not put in dryer! I did after the first wear and the wide elastic waistband twisted so much that they are now unwearable.
3.0,It's kind of form fitting but doesn't meet the definition of a compression shirt.
3.0,"It’s perfect and cute. My gardening outfit, but after first wash it started unraveling at seems. Just like last outfit I ordered from amazon. Lesson learned on where not to buy cloths from. Won’t last long"
3.0,cheap and poorly made.
3.0,Charms came on time.  They were smaller than anticipated with blurred detail.
3.0,The shoes are cute but the unicorn’s fell off before my daughter could even wear them. I tried to use super glue and a hot glue gun to stick the unicorn back on but it would not stay
3.0,"When I opened the package, the socks felt thin and not thick. I only tried on one sock and it fit weird on my foot. Don't really like them."
3.0,Nice shoe overall but kept falling down my leg
3.0,"This 2 pack sunglasses are nice, but the nose pads on the star pair fell off already and they are not very sturdy at all. Also other pair are decent and I will wear them when I ride my motorcycle. I'm glad it came with 2 pair so I can use the other pair. I wouldn't recommend these sunglasses."
3.0,"ISTA Round Rose De France Miligrain Pendent with CZ in Rose Gold Plated in Brass & Chain for Women & Girls<br /><br />Not so much women, but would be perfect for a little girl. Definitely not a high quality piece of jewelry. I would not recommend buying this for anyone you are trying to impress. However, a young child would probably love this necklace. The chain is 16"" long. Pretty short for most necks. Three Stars. Hope you found this review helpful!"
3.0,Way too small made for stick thin people
3.0,Do not stay upright.
3.0,"The dress is so lovely... but it smells so terrible. Seriously. Like fish oil and chemicals. I would love to keep it, hopefully some airing out will help."
3.0,I love the quality! It was much smaller than I was hoping for though. It was about the size of my finger nail.
3.0,Material feels great & fits as expected. I usually wear medium but i ordered the largest small measurement that this shirt comes in & it fit as if it was a medium...my wife loves it.
3.0,It's nice but barely tall enough for a standard size shampoo and body wash. Best to use the travel size bottles. I like the colors.  It does have the hanger and it will work. It's very tight to zip.
3.0,I gave it to my sister.  It was way too small for me and I was really looking forward to wearing it is so flattering.it fits my sister fine.  She is a size 12.
3.0,This dress is a really light fabric and is perfect for summer but there are rogue threads popping out along the seam stitching which is a little annoying. I am 5’6 and this hits me right at my knees. I’m about 200 lbs with a big butt and hips and a smaller chest so the bottom portion fits just right but the top is too big to the point where I have to add a small square of Velcro to the inside portion so I could secure the top down. I got a large on sale for $18 I don’t know that I would pay full price for this though.
3.0,"The earrings are really nice. However, the backs are uncomfortable. You have to screw them on and they hurt your ears when trying to put them in. I figured they are made this way so that the back is fastened tightly but the round gritty edges are really painful. Prefer the smooth ones. Dont know if i'd ever wear them. Its a shame because I really liked them and thats why I purchased them."
3.0,"This is very cute, not very high quality, but also didn't pay much for it either."
3.0,"I love the lens on my polarized pair. I am very picky on lens color, too dark I can't stand. But they r cheap frames. I am afraid to adjust them bc they feel fragile."
3.0,Fit a little small for the size
3.0,Too much trouble to get ready for use<br />I am 5’4”<br /><br />I weigh 135<br /><br />This chart was hard to use for some reason
3.0,They seem fine but I wish they would have come in nicer packaging than a ziplock bag because it was a Christmas present.
3.0,I didn’t like the pockets at all. It doesn’t work for this kind of dress. when I added the belt it pushed all my belly fat down. Made me look unnatractive
3.0,Decent gloves. I’m just used to nitril and not a blend. I don’t have long nails but the tips of the fingers break easy. Not recommended for hard work for many hour. They aren’t durable. They break at the wrist also when trying to apply and worse if reapplying.
3.0,Knocking off stars because of how hard it is to get the bead in. They look sweet though. But I’ve never worn them again because of the trouble.
3.0,"Ring is ok. Looks good. The ""hidden compartment"" is worthless. Was going to use for emergency medicine but even though my pill is tiny the compartment is not hollowed out. Pretty much flat inside. Really couldn't hold anything. So unless you're getting just add a novelty don't waste your money."
3.0,It doesn't fit but it stops the blood.
3.0,I like the resemble it has.
3.0,"The bans is great and everyone else who sees it would give it a 5 star based off seeing it on my wrist. Literally, everyone loves it. But there was a kink in the metal when I got it and now, several months later it is still there... and I still see it. No one else sees it. But since I wear things to look and feel good on myself, I need to drop a star for that. Also, it was super tough to change the band on my gear s2 classic. I won't be changing it very often.. It would be nice if the mechanism was easier to work with.<br /><br />I might be being a little unfair here, but it is what is in my heart"
3.0,"The dress is very pretty, good quality and the colors are vibrant. It looks like the picture.<br />However, I am 160 pounds, 5'2"", 36 DD and curvy. I bought the size 10 and it was too large. I could get away with a medium. I returned. I am afraid that the medium will be too tight on my arms..."
3.0,"floral print was diff, and it just looked bad on me. but the fit was great. I'm 5 ft 11 and wear a 16 Jean's. DDD bra. I bought XL and it fit good."
3.0,"I got a size bigger and cup bigger than I usually wear like it says to do but I needed to go 2 maybe even 3 for cup size, also It shows like it’s pink, blue,  purple and white, but it’s pink, purple, blue and yellow and not very cute, looks like it’s been in the smoky house"
3.0,"Logo isn't as bright as pictured, and smaller than other XL's ordered at the same time. Thin jersey like material, so comfortable. Will wash to prevent shrinkage otherwise the shirt will be too small to wear comfortably."
3.0,The earrings are dissatisfying since they are not as nice as the picture shows.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:878be3b74fe38cca454e79ae50a6515c]] I give this a three because I really like the product idea and comfort but it’s a PAIN to remove the links! 1 sa=tar for removal 1 star for install. The link remover constantly bends and I had to find pliers to re-bend it back in line. When that completely broke I had to use the metal tool and try and press it on the floor which is not safe. (as seen in video) Hopefully if you purchase this product you can find better tools to remove the links :( If you have a large wrist then it’s probably already pre-sized for you! PS- you can take it to a watch place...
3.0,These shorts are comfy and durable.  They’re a little thicker than typical gym shorts- imagine sweatpants thickness but cut 2-3” above the knees.<br /><br />If you workout in them- their thickness And cotton material prevent them from drying quickly so you’ll be wet for awhile.
3.0,"The arm hole isn't as big and low as the picture shows, I'm a typical XL from normal stores.  This shirt is about a size smaller than I would have liked."
3.0,"It's ok, a bit thinner than I expected from the picture but the price was decent. My child likes it."
3.0,They don't fit like the black pair I ordered with the same company.  They fit more like tight leggins instead of yoga pants.
3.0,"Very comfortable and very cool in 100+ temperatures. However, after the first washing the placket would no longer lie flat. I'd probably not order this shirt again."
3.0,They fill a little cheap’<br />They don’t change with the sun light’<br />But I don’t like how they look’
3.0,"All of it is beautiful but the dress is longer than it seems, went past my knees"
3.0,Material is see through and too big :( will be returning
3.0,"Don’t get me wrong, this is a handy road trip companion, but the photo clearly shows the purse next to, supposedly, an iPad Pro.  This picture is not accurate, because I looked up the size of an iPad Pro and it is larger than my iPad, and my picture clearly shows my iPad NOT at all fitting in the purse.  I also show how much actually fits in this supposedly high capacity purse, and it isn’t a whole lot.  After I put a water bottle, my sunglasses, and my small wallet in there, it is pretty much full in the main compartment.  It does have handy smaller pockets and I love to be able to organize my little things like hand lotion or pill case for easy access.  The front pocket is just large enough to get my phone in, but it’s not exactly an easy in and out, which I prefer on road trips because I take a lot of pictures.  The zippers glide nice and smooth, but are also very big…just an aesthetic observation.  The strap confuses me…it is almost as wide as a seat belt and looks and feels like one, too…the strap is adjustable but the buckle slides because the strap is too smooth, and this also causes the purse to slide right off your shoulder if you don’t want to wear it crossbody.  I don’t understand why it needs to clip on, I thought maybe this was to give the option to wear it around one’s waist but it would be much too long for that.  I do like the color, I have been looking for a gray purse like this, but I wish it were large enough for my iPad, and I wish the strap was the same material as the rest of the purse.  It does feel sturdy and will hopefully hold up well, I will probably only use it when I go on road trips since I only take minimal necessities with me when I do, and that is also the only time I wear my purse across my body."
3.0,"Wrong color, too big, fits very different from the picture."
3.0,Was not happy with hem wanted straight across not a big slit and round bem
3.0,pretty but very artificial! not good quality. do not get it wet.
3.0,It doesn’t fit my face cute concept but looks like child size
3.0,"The only problem that I have with this necklace is that it I hooks very often, other than that it is beautiful"
3.0,It is a beautiful item but not made well. Mine broke within weeks. I have to restring it.
3.0,I really likes the fabric it was just like a T-shirt but this v-neck was way way to deep. Lower than my actual cleavage. Nope. This is for a certain body type not all types
3.0,"A little disappointed I though it was going to be a little bit longer, fits more like a shirt than a dress, also it does not have side pockets like the description says. Misleading!"
3.0,"The 2 masks are a very nice looking light grey color. The material on the outside and inside is very soft but there is something very stiff about them. I’m not sure if it’s the material between the 2 layers or what but even after washing twice it’s still stiff.<br />The masks had a terrible smell, like vinegar when I opened the package. After the first wash the smell was almost gone, and after the 2nd it’s no longer noticeable to me.<br />The mask sits just below your chin (I’m averaged size) so it feels a little small to me but my other masks I own are shaped bigger so that might be why. There is a adjustable nose wire and ear loops to help tighten the mask. I noticed that when I tighten it the mask tents out further away from my face, making it look weird.<br />I’m not sure what the copper compression is all about, I don’t notice anything different.<br />All in all it will be a good back up mask to keep in the car but not my daily choice."
3.0,"the waist band was riped and material is more of a satin, but it is pretty fabric"
3.0,"Cute dress and good price. But, the top fit strange. I'm 5'2"", 36C and there was too much gaping and side boob going on for me. So much so I couldn't even wear a strapless bra with it. I had to return it"
3.0,Waist is very narrow on the light blue with hearts compared to other patterns I ordered.
3.0,Love the ones that are the correct size but would expect that all the bras were the same size and not multiple sizes in the same order. I had ordered the full pkg to be 40DD. But yet I got 2 that were 38DD. When I tried to just exchange the 2 Was only given the choice to return all .  I can't return because I needed the ones that fit.
3.0,"It s a very pretty outfit, unfortunately it was too small"
3.0,Quality is a little less than ideal. Does the job.
3.0,"Very stylish,comfortable,and speakers sound good..when connected to my husbands I-Phone. Unfortunately I bought this for Mr and I have an ANDROID phone and it DOES NOT CONNECT to my galaxy s5. Sadly I'm having to return."
3.0,I’m 170 5’4 and the xlarge was a bit small also the shirt is like a crop top. The shirts fit nice though
3.0,"Looks great on, but the magnet is super strong and is a bit painful"
3.0,was expecting this to be China-sized but it is actually normal American clothes size
3.0,Really don't like it.  Has weird gathers on the sides that make your hips look huge and I don't even have hips.  Would not recommend
3.0,"Cloth bag with head hole, very basic."
3.0,"WARNING: If you have a fully developed adult skull these will make you look crazy. For the price and idea they are fine. Packaging was stellar, colors are indefinitely cute- they feel sturdy enough - but they are very small on an adult head lol."
3.0,"Run a little small and its thin at the toe, so I don't expect they will last very long. But the grips stick to my heel and it does the job of being worn with boat shoes"
3.0,"These earrings are perfect in size and weight, however has a flimsy hinge...it's endless but probably  won't last long. I was happy with the 2.75 size and the polished gloss finish, but am afraid the hinge will break. I love bangels, been wearing them a long time so I won't return these because I don't have any this size. Wish someone would make a true endless hoops starting from the inside of the earring, not a hinge!"
3.0,They are not as rich looking in person. Very much costume jewelry.
3.0,"The stitching doesn’t stretch like the rest of the material so it made unflattering dips around my hips and thighs, sorry"
3.0,"The ad says “true size , order your usual size” THAT IS B.S.!! From what I can tell the 2x fits about like between medium and large. The sizes aside I gave the one I ordered to my roommate and he loves it. It’s a good product just a horrible description on the items size."
3.0,"The plastic part is a little cheapy but overall it's good. However it is too big/loose on my small wrist, not like a regular scrunchie."
3.0,"These earrings are very tiny, and better suited to a small child."
3.0,Not impressed with the material. The red looks cheap. It’s a ok skirt.
3.0,"I love this bra. It very quickly became one of my favorites after I recieved it. It is extremely comfortable and very cute. However, after only having it for a month and a half-ish, and taking excellent care of it, the strap started to break (as shown in picture). This was really disappointing to me because now I can't wear it without fear that the strap is going to break and expose me..Super unfortunate."
3.0,Pretty dress I got olive and it was not olive but more like a ashy green. It was riding up the shoulders. The arm holes are small. Got it to wear to a wedding but didn’t wear it.
3.0,To small reson for cancelation
3.0,"According to the size chart from Fanhao my daughter needed an XS so that is what I purchased.  When she tried it on it was very apparent she would have needed a small.  The dress is beautiful although way more cream colored than the picture makes it appear.  We loved the back of the dress and the off the shoulder aspect.  Its a beautiful dress but runs small and is not actually white, more of a dark cream color."
3.0,"I just received these bags and they seem to be very good quality, however the sizes are inaccurate. Each bag is 3&#34; taller than advertised since the measurements did not take the wheel height into account. This is particularly worrisome for the carry-on size, which is 23&#34; inches tall -- most airlines limit carry-ons to 22&#34; or smaller. While the bags are nice, I will be VERY displeased if I am forced to check my carry-on bag due to it being too tall. I specifically looked for a set that included a carry-on since I dislike the fees and the inconvenience associated with checking a bag.<br /><br />UPDATE: While the bags are quite nice and roll well, I was forced to gate check my bag on one of my flights this weekend, which resulted in a delay getting out of the airport due to having to deal with baggage claim. This inconvenience is not worth it to me, so I will likely return the bags in favor of a different set that follows the airline's carry-on size requirements."
3.0,"Nice top, but how it falls it gives a pregnancy look"
3.0,Thicker than i thought and much bigger
3.0,"These shoes run SMALL, order 1-2 sizes up from your child's usual size."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and soft, not too heavy. I don’t like the extra wide elastic waste band, it’s too bulky. I probably wouldn’t have gotten these if I knew they have pockets because they never lay right. I got a size large which turns out to be a 14-16 and I’m normally a 12. The weird thing is that the ass seam rides up and I only weigh 150. So if you’re truly a 14-16 and weigh more than 150, you’re going to be uncomfortable."
3.0,"The fabric looks fancy, the blouse has a beautiful shape but did not fit, it was smaller."
3.0,Would not button across my chest without pulling.
3.0,Cute to look at.  Straps broke snd had to be repaired.
3.0,"The bracelet is cute, probably not really silver, possibly a thin silver plate, and a person has to be pretty careful not to let it fall off the arm. But I got it for my adult daughter, and she seems to like it all right."
3.0,"Bought it as a gift, so not sure how durable this one is. Liked a picture and overall feel&look, but overpriced."
3.0,The bracelet itself looks great but clasp broke the first time I tried to put it on. Suggest that clasp needs to be larger.
3.0,"They are a little difficult to put on, other than that they do raise my feet off the concrete. I think I personally need just a hair more arch support and more relief on the ball of the foot. But I do like this shoe so far."
3.0,Most of the rings didn’t fit past my second knuckle so they were basically all knuckle rings
3.0,This is super cute and the sequins on the ears are gorgeous in the light! I rated it 3 stars because the bow had a stain on it that I couldn't get rid of. A little disappointed by that but don't want to go through the trouble of returning it.
3.0,The design and fit was excellent but the quality of material was disappointing very thin and see through also had a spot on the front. Hopefully comes out in the wash.
3.0,Buy this product because I saw the dress and I thought it was really cute. I was very disappointed when I got the item and I came to notice that it is completely see-through.
3.0,It's really sorter than it looks in picture
3.0,Fabric is soft but the collar is not assembled properly.  This may be a return.
3.0,"I like the look of the item, but the quality is less than desirable. First locket received broke after opening the clasp only twice. The metal is soft and therefore the clasps bend easily and don't lock back into place once that happens. The replacement item received is still just as vulnerable, but I have not opened it since I added the ashes to the urn and placed it inside the locket. Considering the sentimental nature of this item, the quality needs to be improved. It is not something that can be easily returned or replaced once you have added ashes to the vial....."
3.0,very long and very tight do not like them at all
3.0,I like the design but the bag was much smaller than it appeared in the ad.
3.0,Order size up but other than that cute
3.0,"I've purchased 2 all black, Large 4 packs, a few months apart. The first set are amazing and fit very well - snug in every way you want, without feel tight. The second set, however, do actually feel quite tight. Not sure if they accidentally sent the wrong size or they're just not consistently sized. Unfortunately, by the time i figured out what was going on I missed my return window. Be cautious"
3.0,Took a very long time. At least 3 weeks for it to arrive..I didn't realize where it was coming from which was China..The product itself is a little tight maybe too tight around the eyes.. All in all it was a purchase made for my son for a comic con..Regardless it was what he wanted and I think he is okay with it..
3.0,Great classic watch but the band is extremely small.
3.0,I like the material and the jacket style . But it does run small . And the jacket had holes in the pocket areas . I can fix it but still didn’t think I would have too . It also runs very small and if you are a girl buying this and have big boobs I recommend getting the biggest size because I am a DD and this was super tight on my chest area .
3.0,I like the color but the material is thick and hot.
3.0,I had to buy a new dog tag chain within a day. It broke hanging around my son’s neck. But he loves it!
3.0,They're alright for the price and look cool
3.0,"Comfortable, however the fabric started to pill after wearing them twice."
3.0,I ordered these socks after seeing an ad on TV. They are not as comfortable as the medivens that I have. I can't find any benefit to the Copper that is supposed to be woven into certain areas of the socks. I will not order these again.
3.0,This black Submariner Homage watch looks good.. very good.  The only real  visual flaw is the lens for the date does not line up with the numbers.  That is an indicator of the general attention to detail in this watch.  This is not a hack-able movement but this is a very low priced watch so that is not really an issue...  The band latch is nice for a low cost watch and has a side safety lock on it.  The crown is not of the screw down type but for the price not a deal...  The band fell off before I put it on but that can be fixed...  Perhaps the pin was not installed correctly.  The knurl on the crown is a little smoother and a crown a little smaller than would be ideal...  Why?... Because unlike a quartz watch if you put your automatic watch in a drawer and don't wear it for a week you will need to spin the crown to advance the dates....  Maybe spin it a lot.....  The lack of grip and the stiffness of the movement mean the job will go slowly as one finger will not easily spin the crown.. it will take 2 fingers which is slower..  The back of the watch has a window to see the movement and it is a very nice looking movement.  The back does not appear to be a screw in but a snap in....... This level quality of watch is really better as a quartz movement watch...  But an automatic is fun.  I have a Rolex and many Invicta watches.  The Invicta automatic watches are an incredible deal and worth the extra money in my opinion.  But this black watch is stunning for less than $40... You might be wearing with the date set wrong!  With some minor changes the crown issue could be fixed by the manufacturer..
3.0,Material was strange.
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress, however I am going to try and return it (I say try because note this ships from China, and it may be way to expensive to return).  I feel the dress should be titled “junior dress”. It seems more like a dress for a young woman or older teenager, more than a “Mother Dress”.  It looks great on the really thin model in the picture.  I just didn’t feel that comfortable in it.  Also, please note the picture of the back of the dress.  I was most surprised that it is not a zipper or buttons, but laces.  This is a good concept for fitting, as it makes it adjustable...  but you must have someone to help lace it up as you cannot do it and then put it on, and then help needed to lace it down to get out of it too.  Overall it was an inexpensive dress and it does appear like an inexpensive dress."
3.0,"Not the best fitting gloves, but OK for my purposes.  I needed a soft glove to wear on winter days to block UV rays on hands treated for skin cancer,"
3.0,It is a bit smaller than it's specs.  Gave them to my wife.
3.0,Thin not going to last that long but they are cute and my daughter loves them.
3.0,"I love the variety pack. That being said, I am disappointed that a couple of the earrings are unusable as the balls won’t budge, not even with pliers."
3.0,Love the shirt but too big
3.0,Same as other necklaces that I have received from the same Co.. Chain work is not strong and brakes very easy.
3.0,Really good quality bathing suit but go a size up when you order
3.0,Looks alittle cheap but the box was nice so it was a 50/50 situation
3.0,"llego desprendido del botón, y se debía pegar con goma."
3.0,"The straps are sturdy and help to customize the fit of the glove.  I ordered a child S/M and it is big on her, the finger length is about 1/2 inch too long.  Her glove measurement is 5 and 1/2 inches circumference.  The lining is warm and soft but it is not sewn into the glove completely, it is loose and the tends to come out of the fingers when she pulls her hand from the glove, so therefore I only gave it 3 stars.  Overall very warm gloves."
3.0,"Eh. It’s a cheap, silicone band. Nothing special. Color is pretty spot on though."
3.0,"its ok, worth the price I guess runs small ish"
3.0,The fancy hats are cute but the are way to big for a toddlers head. The girls thought the gloves were fun.
3.0,velcro come loose pretty easily
3.0,The fabric isn't holding up too well.
3.0,I wear a medium but I wanted it to be loose. Um it isn’t exactly loose. I guess it is more fitted and form fitting than I expected.<br />It is soft besides that and I love the saying. It was a great price just a bit small good thing I ordered 2 sizes too big. It is wear able because I ordered it 2 sizes bigger
3.0,"I ordered these in the black canvas along with a couple of pairs of the suede strap Capris - the suede fit me perfectly, but these were much too long AND wide.  Part of the problem, I'm sure, is that I'm really a half size, which crocs, annoyingly, doesn't make.  Just be forewarned that these run a bit big.  I had to give mine away because they were much too large, but they were very comfy when I wore them around the house."
3.0,"Charm is about 1/2"", was looking for something bigger. Will return."
3.0,I normally need a size large but these are quite loose on me. I would order a size down. Quality is nice
3.0,"The design of this is very cute, but I had to return it because the fit was bizarre. The bottoms were slightly tight and the top was doing super weird things to my boobs. I am a 38E cup, so I know clownboobs are my fault, but I had to send it back. Love the concept though!"
3.0,Smaller fit I honestly ordered them too large looking for a loose fit but ended up being just right
3.0,I had to return because I have a slender bottomed these pants are meant for an ample one.  Otherwise they seemed fine.
3.0,"Loved the swimsuit, colors were exactly as pictured. Fit was very comfortable."
3.0,card board
3.0,The dress (I ordered orange) is A LOT more orange than it looks in the photo above. It’s not any kind of like burnt or even slightly darker orange. It’s straight up traffic cone orange. But the dress itself is cute! I’d order a size below what you think you’d need though. I’m always a XL and it fit like a 2X.
3.0,Great design but won’t stand on its own. One side bent less than one week of using it. Love the color.
3.0,Very cool watch when you want to switch things up a little.  I've worn it a few times and received nice compliments.
3.0,Dress fits very well. The material is very soft. Only thing I didnt like was the pockets and color. The pockets make the dress stick out from the sides and the color isn't as dark and vibrant as the picture. It was more in the full side.
3.0,"Cute shirt, but a little small and not very flattering on me, but I carry my weight in my hips."
3.0,I really did love this ring. It’s cute and dainty. The only problem I had was part of it (on the side by the stone) turned copper looking. 😩 I forgot to take it off while I was cooking. I’m super bummed now.
3.0,I would recommend ordering a size larger. I found the dress to be too small as I ordered the size small according to recommendation. The fabric is thin as well.
3.0,"Of the two pairs I got, one worked fantastic, wear them everyday to work. The other pair came defective; customer service was very nice, but never sent me the promised replacement.  That was 4 months ago..."
3.0,Ron's just a tad small but it could be because it is spandex by it a little bigger than you need but is cute
3.0,It runs small I got a 3x and matching it up it's more between xl and xxl so a size and half off smaller. The colors are not as bold as the pictures and quality not that great  I'll keep it but wont ever order these again
3.0,2 of the zippers broke off in the first 30 minutes but its warm and fits ok so its not bad
3.0,I bought these for my wife who is a hairdresser and has to wear a mask due to covid 19. She's petite and these were too large for her to wear. They're probably fine for an average size individual.
3.0,"I wanted an oversized thick shirt for the fall/winter season, but this was a miss. The listing has this shirt looking very oversized on the model and I wanted that. Unfortunately, I sized down according to their size chart and I was wrong. If you want the oversized look, like the model in this listing, go up a size. At the end of the day, I unstitched the sleeves and cropped the shirt to fit my proportions. I am satisfied with this decision because the crop is subtle which I like."
3.0,good for what it is
3.0,I washed my hands for a couple of times and the colour faded. That sucks.
3.0,"(I’m 5’5 and usually a Medium everywhere.)The fabric felt nice, but the proportions are weird. I know the top is supposed to be larger/off shoulder, but it was VERY wide and looked huge. Meanwhile the elastic of the shorts felt a bit tight. I missed my return window, so I’m selling this elsewhere. Just looked messy and not cute on me!"
3.0,Super cute swim suit but had to return it since it is not made for busty girls. Real bummer because it was beautiful and seemed well made. I am 5F1 weighing at 115lbs  with a 32 DD bust. The body fit perfect but the girls just kept falling out :(
3.0,Runs small. I bought these because the previous brand I bought last year was not available. They are made smaller and shorter.
3.0,"I love the concept, just need more practice to be able to be move more smoothly"
3.0,The product is so cute but it took forever to get i the mail so if you need it by a certain date I suggest buying it from somewhere else. I got the 14&#34; and I'm very tiny so it hangs like a 16&#34; so if you are small I suggest buying the 14&#34; if you want the look of a 16&#34;
3.0,it ok still not sure if I am keeping it or not. its cute just not me
3.0,Does leave marks on the skin and the silver coating appears to be fading rather quickly. love the design but want better quality.
3.0,"You get what you pay for here. They were really cure while they lasted, actually became my favorite jeans for about a month but the zipper broke."
3.0,Fake leather style shoes. They feel very flat when wearing them. Sort of like wearing plastic shoes. Stylish though!
3.0,I like the design but it does not stay put around my ear. I have to check ever so often to push it back into place.
3.0,Bought it for a wedding. A medium wasn’t available. Got a large. It was too big. The style was nice. The length was great. I’m 5’6 and<br /> 160pds and I didn’t want my crotch exposed. It delivered on that without being being matronly. The quality was decent. Color emerald was pretty. Overall I think I was mainly disappointed with the product for the price. In my opinion way overpriced for what was delivered. I returned based on sizing and price.
3.0,Runs big. Soft and the navy is almost black.
3.0,"These are being used as PJ'S for my 6yo daughter. I think they are cute. I like the 2 pack option with the colors of pink and purple. She was happy to receive them and wore both pair already. The fit was a little tighter than I expected. She is in between sizes 8 and 10 depending on the brand. I was sure that she would have plenty of room in the size 10/12, but it fits pretty snug. Lastly, after wearing one pair overnight, I found a huge hole in the sleeve  the next day. I'm disappointed that I found a hole and I'm afraid the other PJs will not hold up well. In theory, this is a great value, but due to the hole I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"These feel great in terms of the sole, but are way too small.  I ordered one size up, and should have ordered three sizes up for it to fit.  I wore them around the house but they just didn't work and returned them.  I to be fair... I have a very high instep and have trouble with non-stretch shoes."
3.0,It is a little long and narrow.
3.0,"The sock is what I would classify as mild compression. The length is just right and the material is very nice. It is a very thick sock and I will not be able to use this as a running sock. Under a pair of boots they are nice and the fabric blend seems very good. Wool is wonderful for cold weather and this seems to be a quality blend. They do  stay up but I intended to have a nice pair of wool running socks with compression qualities and this doesn't work for that. In addition, the sizing is big. I ordered a med. I have women size 8.5 running shoe and these have room in the foot which is odd to me."
3.0,"The top of the dress is pretty.  It is stretchy and fits nicely for someone with a big bust like me.  The fabric on the bottom is not what I expected at all.  Kind of a cheap, stiff feeling material.  It wrinkles very easily.  You get what you pay for I guess.  I wouldn't purchase again but it will work for the price."
3.0,Average product
3.0,Junk made my finger itch fake metal
3.0,Love the socks but the toe wore out after 6-10 wearings .Will not buy again
3.0,"I love Verdusa and have gotten a handful of their clothing. However, this dress was the only thing I had an issue with. The seems that should run straight down on your sides were crooked. One side started correctly on the side but then creeped forward and ended up on the front of my leg. I had to return.<br /><br />But I have to say that everything else about the dress was great. The softness of the material was nice. I'm 5'3 and it fell around my ankles. I loved the neckline. It wasn't sheer. I got compliments the time I wore it. It wasn't too tight or loose, but still showed off my figure. Great skims dupe!"
3.0,Pretty but big
3.0,bought as gift and is literally the most plastic looking
3.0,"The Best:<br />They are really cute. Overall they fit my hubby,  me, and my 20 month old pretty well and looked adorable.<br /><br />The Good:<br />High quality, soft,  sturdy, stretchy material. The top is cut well for Women's and Men's.  Pattern is nice and design is cute.  The pants are nice and long for the taller folks, but can alternatively be worn higher on the waist for shorter folks.  No noticeable shrinking with first wash.  Held their shape.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The pants are a little weird.  I don't know Iif it's the cut or the material or the combination, but I wouldn't buy them by themselves (even if they were $1 at the dollar store).  Baby pants run big, but the bodysuit runs a bit in the small side of true to size.<br /><br />The Worst:<br />I washed all three of our tops together in as cold load, by themselves, and the white got murky from the black sleeves.  It's not awful,  it's just not bright anymore.  I imagine the black arms will bleed again with every wash until the white part looks like a muddy grey."
3.0,"Came early, was supper excited to wear it but it turns my neck green , have to put clear nail polish on it so it doesn't stain my skin."
3.0,The detail is great but the button to hold the band onto the watch was broken. I was able to fix myself as I didn’t want to return it and loose out on having this watch band. So buyer beware!
3.0,"These are cute, but super flat - there's no cushion at all, it feels like walking on furry cardboard."
3.0,Kind of worked
3.0,"This dress could have been much nicer if the waist hadn’t felt so short, and if it had been made from a nicer fabric. I was really surprised by the fabric. It feels crisp and uncomfortable. If it were more relaxed and stretchy, the dress would have fit perfectly. I’m reluctantly keeping the dress, but I won’t wear it much. The fabric is not user friendly."
3.0,"Great if your nose piercing is lower toward your nostril. Not so great if your piercing is higher like mine. Gave them to a friend with a lower piercing and they fit her perfectly. On me, they were only just slightly too small and tight."
3.0,"These are so cute!! I worry a little about the color, but so far so good. Wish they had come with instructions for those of us too tired to figure things out with no pictures, though."
3.0,"They look good, but one of the glasses was missing parts and was crooked. The rest are good and will wear them."
3.0,"I enjoyed the like of the watch, but was disappointed when I open the package and the face was cracked."
3.0,Don't use the waist sizing chart. Go up at least a size if you dont want your junk totally smashed.
3.0,"These are wonderful gloves -- warm, strong, etc.  However, I'm going with 4 stars because on my first ski trip with them, the sewing of one of the wrist straps, with very little pressure, came undone so instead of a wrist loop I just had a long piece of elastic hanging off my glove, and the elastic then started unraveling.  I didn't even consider sending the glove back.  I fixed the strap, and added a bit of crazy glue to the sewing of the other one, just in case.<br />=============================<br />... sigh.  OK, so I downgraded them again, to 3 stars.  When skiing, I almost always take 2 pairs of gloves, as I did in my recent trip to Breck (a.k.a. BreckenFridge).  I wear one pair, and hang the other pair, clipped together, over one of the straps on my Camelbak.  The day turned out not to be as cold as I'd feared, so I never put on my lovely Empyreans.  At the end of the day they were gone.  The clip & strap to hold them together must have been as weak & cheap as the wrist straps.  I've never had this problem with any other gloves, and I've been skiing for many years.  I have nothing to show to the manufacturer to demonstrate that it was faulty design/workmanship that caused me to lose them, so all I can do is post this review.  !@#$%^&*! -- these really were beautiful gloves, but I'm not buying another pair."
3.0,the button at the neck falls in a very odd spot .. not attractive at all
3.0,Super cute print but way small size.  I ordered and XL and it was cutting off the circulation to my thighs.
3.0,I loved this item upon arrival and thought it was a great item for the cost and well worth the value.  However after five month the color started to fade to a Bronze
3.0,"The sweater looks great online but in reality it is Small-Medium size. It is rather short too, not the baggy one I expected to get and wear on casual Friday’s in the office."
3.0,Gave these to my boyfriend. Though they looked large but wondered would they shrink in dryer. Answer was no. Definitely sized for men.
3.0,"The watch came in pristine appearing condition. No marks on the body or glass.  The battery, unfortunately, only lasts about 4 hours and goes from 30% to 0 % almost immediately. I have had Apple watches since the series 0, always purchased as refurb. This one I bought for my wife because her Fitbit Charge 5 was burning her wrist. She loves the watch, hates the battery life. I'm heading to the Apple store for a new battery tonight. The watch has turned out to be a bunch more expensive than I expected."
3.0,"its clearly a costume but thats what it is, but it is sized very small, I am a size 0 normally and the extra small size was very tight, i felt like a blimp, lol. i would go at least a size higher than usual!"
3.0,"Nice hat. Flag was not sewn on, Just heat tape and started to peal after a few weeks."
3.0,I did get my headband 😢
3.0,Looks cute in picture but it’s way to short. Looks more like a shawl
3.0,"It’s cute, but the fabric is cheap and it flares out a bit around my hips. I’m 5’9 160 and ordered a large."
3.0,It’s decent for the price. But I am disappointed that that image doesn’t match the product quite right. The side panels are way too narrow compared to the image.
3.0,Seems well made but runs a bit small. Overall a good value.
3.0,We bought as a gift for a niece.  Bracelet is nice for the price.
3.0,Good material for the price. But I am 5' 1&#34; and 110 lbs. and a small was too big.
3.0,perfect for lounging around the house.  sizing runs a little small so won't be wearing mine out in public.  the material is a good value for the price.
3.0,"Undersized by a factor of three or so. Lovely fabric, though."
3.0,Good quality but  size description misleading
3.0,"I returned, it didn't fit me, but was a nice dress"
3.0,Cheaply material but doable since I purchased to wear with a specify outfit
3.0,"Skidders make a great product - they produce a non-slip sock for toddlers, which is great for when they’re first learning to walk and run. But their sock patterns are so so ugly. Why not make them in black or gray or blue solid? These patterns are so lame."
3.0,The quality is not great. When I got it it was all wrinkled and the front part was bend.
3.0,"The sleeves are just too puffy for me, and the fabric once you’d be caught up with sharp edges surely it’ll easily break apart. I have worn, & washed it 3 times already—and dried it on the machine, the gold prints are starting to have some stricks as if they are about to come off. So I suggest just wash it by hands and let it air dry. Otherwise  it will last a little longer"
3.0,"This product is quite small for the sizes given. The quality of the material is not good, either. Returned."
3.0,not for florida. its to hot
3.0,"Expected these to be ""high quality"" cotton for winter. They're definitely a blend material for warm weather. Should have actually checked the actual material % before buying."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and soft and thick, I like that.<br />The down side is that the bottom of the dress is a little bit to wide, from where the pockets are.<br />Love the fact that it ha pockets but a little to wide.<br />The top fits perfect."
3.0,"The earrings didn’t come new. They have tiny scratches and were not in a Tiffany box, or bag or individually wrapped or packaged like other Tiffany jewelry I have purchased."
3.0,No lining so was see through and rode up when walking or moving. Runs size smaller than normal
3.0,"I loved this suit for my active 7 year old swimmer. We have had it now for 3.5 months and no problems until yesterday, when all of a sudden the material of suit lost its durability and everything sagged. Very sad that we only got use out of it for a few months."
3.0,"I own several pairs of these gloves, at least 4 or 5. I love these gloves, the look, the feel and the grip. I get complements on them all the time. When you first put them on they'll feel very tight, but after wearing them for a few days they'll loosen-up, but then they continue to loosen-up, a little too much. They also don't last very long. The rubber grips pop off like crazy on the palm and the fingertips get holes very quickly. I would say that if you wear them pretty exclusively throughout the winter you can expect to go through at least 2 pairs."
3.0,Fits well but the color is not as vibrant as the picture..
3.0,"It was smaller than I thought it’d be. The clasp is tiny, so it’s hard to put on."
3.0,It is what it looks like
3.0,"Would be cute, but I ordered a large and it fits like a small."
3.0,It’s beautiful looking just like the photos in the listing.  After only 2 weeks of wearing it the finish has worn off and turns my skin green now.
3.0,Funky...i am fairly flat chessed so it worked for me...but in general not a proper shape..rear end is funky and the girls dont stay put well...thought i bought wrong size so bought a second one...not gonna lie still use em both but need i will keep shopping til i find the perfect one
3.0,The fabric was too thin and had  shorts sewed inside. Didn't like that.
3.0,"I needed a bag to take with me to Europe but this was so heavy on it's own, once I started to fill it with my things I knew it would be way to cumbersome for the trip. It was also missing a D ring on the back so I couldn't even turn it into a backpack."
3.0,"Really cute and fit really nice, but clasp on top broke the 2nd time wearing it."
3.0,"This is a beautiful hat, but the white color is more ivory than white. It will not match anything I wanted to wear it with."
3.0,"I can't get the snaps closed over the ankle of my short boot.  Or indeed, my thicc ankles. But I can get the bottom two snaps done up and will use a rubber band to hold the top together, hidden under my pant leg. So it's okay, but not perfect."
3.0,Not What I expected.
3.0,Bought this for my Sonia Blade costume. They are comfy but a little thin for working out in my opinion.
3.0,"Well I LOVED it when it arrived. After using it for about 5 days, it became discolored or dark in one area.  It looked as if I brushed it against something dark, but no idea what that would be and it shouldnt have happened no matter what it was. So I returned it.  I also didnt like the cloth handle, though I probably missed that in the reviews so my fault. But I still would have kept it."
3.0,I'm usually a size large and that's what i ordered but it was a little loose. I believe it's because of the fabric. It stretches but over all i liked it.
3.0,"As soon as this set was washed, it shrunk about a size. Sad, because my 3 yr old loved it and got it for her birthday. She was only about to wear once at 34 lbs"
3.0,"Its soft, well stitched and as pictured. Came packaged well. Shipping was very fast. All in all a good purchase. However I feel like it should be priced at around $5 for what it is. It was the only goofy one of could find on here so I went with it. If goofy isn't a top priority for you it would suggest buying the mickey mouse 4 pack for $10 as its the same material."
3.0,It fits great just the material can get a bit hot in the summe
3.0,I like the way these are made but they are at least 2 sizes smaller than size stated.
3.0,Wasnt quite what I expected
3.0,Its not sensitive on the ear
3.0,"Helped a bit, not enough to improve posture or tiredness, in fact, back muscles hurt so much, I needed an Aleve every day for 4 days??????"
3.0,the color is not accurate.
3.0,"I had to return mine because the zipper was broken upon receiving. The material is on the thin side, it's more of a shirt material than jacket. It was also a little smaller than expected. I probably would have kept it if it wasn't for the zipper, because I run on the warm side but if you are looking for something that will actually provide a little warmth this probably wouldn't work"
3.0,"This sweater is well made, but shorter than anticipated. I’m 5’1” all things are long on me. this sweater isn’t even tunic length. The neck is tighter than shown.  I also ordered the wine red and was clearly sent the brick red. Hopefully it will hold up to washing. It’s still pretty just not the one I ordered or as vibrant as I pictured."
3.0,"Pro: Beautifully printed.<br />Fabric is silky/cooling to the touch.<br /><br />Con: Sizing is not youth, but larger adult-like. Large shirt almost fit wife who wears women's 2x."
3.0,Kidd glasses<br />Kids glasses<br />Kids glasses
3.0,cheap  - torn with wind
3.0,Was amazing when I first got it and I loved it so much. But it VERY quickly changed color and started leaving a green residue on my neck even though I never purposely got it wet and only wore it on certain occasions
3.0,"As others have said, the edges are sharp, and it feels like it could use a light sanding, but I decided to man up and keep wearing it. Within a few weeks I noticed the black filler, which felt almost like a rubbery wax, was falling out bit by bit...now it is almost entirely silver with no black fill. Still not a bad cross for the price, and I feel like some black colored epoxy will fill it in just fine. Overall 3 stars"
3.0,Love the fabric and very lightweight. The color is too pink. Pepto Pink. Pants and hoodie together is a bit much. Either wear as separates but I Will return.
3.0,Super cute but the lacey part was too itchy for my daughter so unfortunately we had to return it.
3.0,They bend. Bad quality.
3.0,this watch is for kids
3.0,"They're okay, but it's very small on me. 6&#34;0 215 17/M for clarification"
3.0,"I really, really liked the material, the waist and the ankle cuffs of  these sweatpants.  If they had fit, I would have ordered several.  I gave 3 stars because of the odd inseam sizing. I usually fit a large, but both the large and xlarge were the same length, and too short for me.  I normally wear a 32"" inseam, and both pairs were about 30""!  The only difference between the two sizes was the material in the hips.  I was swimming in the XL, the seat fit correctly in the L, but both were way too short."
3.0,"Wanted a comfy pair of athletic style pants (non-jogger style). These almost worked, but I didn't care for the lay of the pockets. The sagged down, bunched up, and looked sloppy."
3.0,Fit a little big.
3.0,I like how this PJ looks on me but the material is so rough it makes it uncomfortable to sleep in it( I got the blue one) As a lounge set probably is more usable especially the top. In overall you get what you pay for. Lesson learned.
3.0,Too short in the back. Not for ladies with lots of curves ;)
3.0,"Headband is adorable. The tiara is a little too heavy for the width of band, however."
3.0,I ordered my usually size which is the same in the size chart provided. I had to send the dress back 2 times to get a smaller size. I usually wear a 2x and ended up getting a large.
3.0,"The umbrella is not designed to auto close, but the description says it is. Amazon, please edit copy for this item only."
3.0,very delicate they rip easy.
3.0,Lemme start by saying I love Thinx. The peoducts are generally quite good and reliable. However…I ordered a large and it fits like a small. It is a little painful to squeeze my lard-like flesh into something that is labelled as large but turns into a muff-cutting piece of dental floss in under a minute. It absorbs blood very well.
3.0,"Skirt was completely see through, and was a bit too tight. Material was also slightly uncomfortable but overall it was really cute if the skirt wasn’t see through!"
3.0,"For the price I paid, I expected a better material and quality. The material is a very simple cotton. I am disappointed. I have received the package very quickly, however, the wrapping was tore-ed or used. There was no receipt, catalog, or return package/instruction. I found it later, at the store, for half the price."
3.0,"Leaked from the bottom of mask for me , son and guest - gave to Goodwill"
3.0,"These are well made, but simply too small for a man to use.  Tight, uncomfortable and leaves mark on wrist - should be OK for children and those with smaller wrists, but unusable for those with larger wrists."
3.0,"Cheap and cute but come packaged in such a way that material is folded/kinked in certain areas. The clasp and chain were on opposite sides in my case, but even on the smallest possible option, they are still not as tight as they should be on my neck."
3.0,"I loved the shoe, unfortunately we won’t be able to use both pair we bought. My kids both used them one day and they both got blisters on the back part of their ankle. It’s too bad as I really liked them."
3.0,Super sheer and comfy
3.0,"It’s an adorable dress.  It is thin, but the cleavage was way too much for me so I wore a tank under it anyway.  I doubt it will last more than a couple of seasons.  I wear 18W jeans and a xl fit fine."
3.0,Looks nice<br />Maybe not worth the price
3.0,Runs small. Size up. Otherwise really cute
3.0,"It is sewn unevenly, and looks to be poorly made.  Has an odd fit - using the scarves at all pulls the hood over eyes, making it not functional.  Really wanted to love it, but just doesn't work."
3.0,The pocket is on the waist and is almost useless. I was a bit disappointed in the pocket.
3.0,you can not adjust the arms to fit your head.  they are like aluminum bands that just flex.  i have to keep pushing them up my nose. annoying.
3.0,Lots of room. But straps broke within 3 months if use and that was the end for me.
3.0,"It looks cute on the model but it kind of hangs off your body and the whole dress is kind of &#34;heavy&#34;.  I really wanted to like this dress but it just didn't sit right on my body- I am 5'0&#34; tall, short waisted but curvy.  It kind of hung on me instead of fitting well.  Basically- I needed it to be more fitted at the waist so that the fabric would kind of sit on the hips.  Rather it hangs from the shoulders and makes for an unflattering look.  I'm ordered it in a small and an medium and both fit the same way.  Oh well- I had hopes"
3.0,"In terms of quality, it's not but all the same it's ok"
3.0,the back is sharp and will cut anyone that wears it. and it is very thin and poorly made.
3.0,"Colors are completely off. Doesn't look like a luna moth at all, very blue ans purple instead of green and burgundy. Works as a very pretty set of blue and purple moth/butterfly wings if you're not specifically looking for luna moth, though. I ended up adding ties to attach to my hands and also replacing the tie in the front as it's black and stands out somewhat. Also, there are not defined tails in the back as seen in the photos."
3.0,"Much narrower than pictured, and very flimsy. Certainly not worth $20! Wouldn't buy as a gift for anyone. Probably shan't wear it much (it won't be very visible even when I do)."
3.0,This was not true to size so it was much too small in the chest area and way too see through. Needed it for a beach wedding but too thin of material for me.
3.0,Not great quality. The material pills easily.
3.0,Super pretty but we can’t make the image come out forward. It says the message backward or it has the bracelet blocking it. Kind sucks but it’s cool enough<br />I think the Stone was put in backwards
3.0,"So pretty, tried to use for my conch. Bar length is perfect but the actual butterfly is too big. Unless your tragus is massive, this is too big :("
3.0,Frames had ridged edge that scratches
3.0,"Material is not like original unfortunately. Also the one I received did not have the adjustable loop like the original, but it shows both types. Idk if you had to specify you wanted the original or if there was a choice. By it for the price you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Really not very excited about it by the time we received it. Shipping took awhile, packaging looked like actual garbage/recycling.<br />The sweater looks even cheaper than what I paid for. The color is much less vibrant and the material seems very loosely woven, feels like a breeze runs right through if you walk briskly."
3.0,I had such high hopes for this ring 😔 it was so cute in the pictures but you have to check the size of the Ring before buying it it's not slender it's very chunky and the only way for someone to wear it is for a guy  but the only good thing if you're a lady it's good for a pendant if it was slender I would give it five stars .
3.0,Way too long. Theres no way for you to adjust the length and it ends up getting tangled.
3.0,I am keeping it but it is too large and does not fit the body like in the picture.  It is not cut the same as in the picture.
3.0,"I ordered x-large but should have gone with a large. They are silky and soft wearing, almost completely no panty line and have held up through several machine washes. They don't have a cotton lining, only a small piece of fabric. They stretch out about a size too big quickly. The waist band is thin and comfortable but the buttock lining stretches out and sags to the point you can grab an entire chunk of fabric. They don't ride up which is a plus but overall not what I was looking for. Will not be repurchasing."
3.0,"These leggings are cute, I really think I’m just not built for them. I’m 5’7” and the legs on these leggings were perfect!! They were snug but not too snug and long enough they hit right above the ankle but the waste was just way too awkward on my body. The “compression” band actually hit right and my ribs above my belly button, if the compression band was wider they would be perfect! I’m more of a straight shape less of an hourglass and these were definitely made for more of an hourglass shaped body if you don’t want them cutting into your stomach!"
3.0,Fit beautifully. Just wished the threads were more float but overall they looked great on me.
3.0,Good for price I just don't like the size thought they would be bigger but hey they look good and are really cool
3.0,Nice design but could be a little bit bigger!
3.0,Had to change out pearl way to big for ring
3.0,"el vestido se ve mejor en la imagen que en fisico, parece una tela diferente"
3.0,"The attached picture is from January 8th... The looks like that for a week already before the picture.. I gave these to my child on the 25th of december... These did not last nearly as long as I had expected.. I figured at least 3 months, not 2 weeks.<br />Only been worn inside on a new laminate floor.<br />We love them super comfy and very cute."
3.0,"Just OK, considering that the two cell phone pockets I purchased each has a hipklip that doesn't securely lock. I email hipklip.com hoping they have a simple fix for a clip that has a &#34;soft&#34; lock."
3.0,Had to send back for larger size..but its a cute top.
3.0,Fue devuelto.
3.0,"I should have listened to the other reviews and not ordered it. I normally wear a small, so I ordered a medium (due to the past reviews).  I never thought I would need a large!  Disappointed!  Too bad because it is a cute top!"
3.0,"I like the way the ring feels/fits, and it has a little less of a tacky feel than some other silicone rings I've tried. The 2-layer construction leads to it being hard to keep clean, as does the infinity logo.  The biggest issue however is the color, which was pretty close to the listing picture originally, but after just a couple weeks it has changed to more of an army green, or at best a patinad copper (see pic)."
3.0,---------
3.0,cute but broke easily
3.0,"Very cute gloves, designed for looks ONLY, not designed to keep your fingers warm. Not a true winter glove, use them during late fall."
3.0,Definitely way too small. Not stretchy at all. I would not call these high waisted at all. They are very thick fabric with no loose strings and very well-made buttons in the zipper. I got a size bigger because I thought they were from a different country sizing from China or Japan and I believe that they are so I should’ve got two more sizes bigger than my normal size. I’m 145 pounds and I’m 5 foot three I normally wear a size 5.  I will be returning for a bigger size because I do like the jeans they’re just extremely small.  I just moved into my house so I needed some work clothes so these were great as business clothes and or casual clothes
3.0,The grey and the black rings are pretty cool.  I liked the silver metallic the best however after only 1 week the silver started to rub off.  I did no gym work this week.  Actually I didn't do much other than drive around.  This is disappointing.
3.0,It runs big. Trying to shrink it because I do like it. The colors are really nice.
3.0,5’2 223 ordered size 2x fit perfect
3.0,"I wanted to order one, but see no need to hassle with photos. A simple size chart would work, if only there was an option for that."
3.0,its good but the size is 1 size bigger than expected.
3.0,Too small for adults. Ok for kids.
3.0,"I am 5'4"" and weigh 145 lbs.  Depending on the brand, I normally wear waist size 28""\5-6\or Medium.  I had to lay down to get them buttoned but wasn't able to get them zipped.  I returned it and ordered a Large."
3.0,"The quality seems to be fine, but was very disappointed in the actual size/diameter of the whole loop.  It appeared to be larger than it actually was.  Disappointed."
3.0,"the map is very blurred, wasn't clear from the picture, otherwise nice wall decoration"
3.0,"Nicely made watch with a great look to it, but it shouldn't be listed as a boys' watch at all. The face on this watch is huge; way too large for any young boys I know. We bought this for our son (10 year old), but ended up returning it because it was just too big."
3.0,"I hope it will stretch's,"
3.0,It was ok. I tried 3 brands and this was my least favorite.  It is more vegetable than beef for the beef flavor.
3.0,I ordered kids large and they are too big for me.  I wear a women's size 6 shoe.  The socks are fine otherwise.
3.0,I really like this but the first time it was used the strap broke. Not happy.
3.0,NOT REAL LEATHER. MADE IN CHINA. NOT FOR WIDE FEET.
3.0,Was cute..cheap material..but u get what u pay for... my only issue is being naturally top heavy 40DD..and this gives no support at all
3.0,"I returned the dress because the thin clingy fabric would only look good on a model. Cute dress, but not for me. Size large was the right size though I normally wear medium. I knew this before I ordered because I paid close attention to the size chart."
3.0,"The pants are not like its pictured. and once you get it home, the zippers are not made well.  The fit is exact, but I will keep, I am sure the zipper will break soon though."
3.0,OK top. Fabric reminds me of scrubs. Not very well sized. I wear a 6–8 and bought an XL. It barely fits.
3.0,Looks nice. But it is definitely cheaply made. Pulling on and off already could here the seems ripping.
3.0,this was an oversized 2xl; even exchange requested fo xl.
3.0,"Product came in a large manela envelope and not in a box so it was already broken on the top half when I opened it. Bad packaging. Order another from another company and it came in a box, much better and not broken. It needs some extra glue in places but it is a pretty mask, definitely different."
3.0,I don’t like the glare on these
3.0,cute but it was tinier then i expected
3.0,"Arrived on time and as made from what appears to be very nice material, but they seem smallish.... As I lose weight, I'm hoping that they will fit better... so, not a bad product, but order your size accordingly...."
3.0,The chain is the worst quality. There is no way it won't snap after a few wears. Also the pendant is significantly lighter than pictured. Id prefer the pink vs the milky tone it looked like
3.0,"There's no bra shelf inside of it, it's just a shirt.  Not helpful for swimwear.  Smaller than expected, def size up."
3.0,very cute but runs lage.
3.0,This is ok
3.0,"Beautiful but dulled sooner than expected, sad"
3.0,"I got my regular size but these fit small. Not sure if real or fake, but definitely not as comfy as previous New Era caps I've owned. Looks good and keeps the sun out of my eyes though"
3.0,Very cute but can’t seem to gut them to stay on in the correct position. Guess I’ll just need to pierce the top and sides of my ears.
3.0,Not so slouchy!!!
3.0,Very pretty but VERY small. Doesn't even fit around my 15 year old daughters wrist.
3.0,Cheaply made but to be expected at this price point.
3.0,The hat is comfortable and keeps my head warm.  That to me is where the good ends.  The speaker quality is poor.  The battery life is only okay making this a poor value. No matter what an item costs if it doesn’t deliver what it is designed to do it is a bad buy.  If the speakers are low grade and the battery life is not great price doesn’t matter.  This cap doesn’t deliver in any category.  Look elsewhere please.
3.0,Such a cute band. I was unable to get a good fit though. It was always either too tight or too loose. Could never get the perfect fit. Gave away.
3.0,"This infinity scarf is made in China of 90% polyester and 10% linen. It is a very nice loop scarf and looks good on me. However, it is a bit itchy and it is too warm for the summer.  Otherwise, it is very attractive. I rated this 3 stars due to the itch and the fact that this is labeled a spring/summer scarf when I feel it is more fall/winter.<br /><br />This pairs exceptionally well with this [[ASIN:07PWVVL89 accsa Women's Fedora]]."
3.0,"way to big, snet them back, but didnt get credit for the return... this is the 3rd product that Amazon has lost or not checked in on their end. Product seemd like good quality, but not made for smaller people."
3.0,"Nice flannels, but ordered a size up as many recommended. Mistake!"
3.0,The lenses don't soften the glare of the sun. Style us great though.
3.0,You get what you pay for and these all ran differently. If you bend over your going to show everyone your business. Very thin material. Might be ok for outdoor walks but not for Zumba or high impact cardio. Wished my review was more positive but I have to be honest.
3.0,"I just love this watch, but the low price is a little misleading. The said nothing about the self-winding part of this mechanical movement, being a guy named Pedro. It cost me another $200k to build an addition to my house for Pedro to live in so that my watch would stay wound. That kind of hidden cost would have been a deal-breaker. However, I found out if I sent the watch back they would not have refunded the $4.99 shipping, so I kept the watch. Also, Pedro has turned to be a pretty good dude."
3.0,i wear it as a shirt
3.0,"I wasn't very satisfied with my slippers, they are already starting to come apart at the seams"
3.0,Very cute but the sleeves are way too loose.
3.0,good quality earrings.  i wish that the pictures had accurately shown how the different sizes appear on the lobe.  long back of the earring makes it difficult to stop the stud from hanging down on the ear. arrived on time
3.0,Like the product but it ran VERY small. I returned.
3.0,When I washed it the size dropped by 2 sizes. Very thin material. Would not buy again.
3.0,"Juggles around a lot, not the most secure. Would probably work better if there were two pins in back holding it in place. I got it for my work vest at REI but it was too floppy and awkward due to the size"
3.0,Super cute shoes with great fit!! But the glitter get everywhere! We all know how we feel about loose glitter!
3.0,"It is a very cute outfit, but I feel like the straps are a little on the long side. I also wish it had snaps at the bottom to make diaper changing less of a challenge."
3.0,"Soft fabric and great hidden pockets. Love the style and pattern, however the skirt is see through.  Even when loose and flowing undergarments are visible.  I was required to wear shorts under to avoid any embarrassing incidents."
3.0,"Though I looked carefully at the pictures, it looked smaller in person. I’m sure the size is accurate to what’s listed though. You can tell it’s a heart with a stethoscope from further away but you’d have to be close to see the EKG lines. One thing I didn’t like was that the red was not bright and shiny like in the pictures. It was a darker kind of red and looked dull. Bought this as a gift because I thought it looked shinier and classier than the other models on here but it wasn’t the case in person... It did come with a microfiber cloth for cleaning though."
3.0,I would have given it a 5 start if it didn't come chipped. I would have returned it if I wasn't worried about getting it back in time for a Halloween party on the 28th. It works well and is what I wanted but the chip in the casing was disappointing
3.0,Ordered sweater to wear for a Christmas wedding. Ordered my normal size and it was huge on me. Too late to exchange for a smaller size so I wore it but it was way too big!  Otherwise nice sweater.
3.0,"So small. Lovely craftsmanship but it's tiny tiny. My coach wallet just barely fits, forget much else maybe a few things like gum and lipsticks a phone and some keys.  My daughter plays with it mostly."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:59498805d32a3ce76975f010d2f4df2c]] Easily ripped but was cute tho
3.0,"&#34;Style 1 Dark Red&#34; was unbearably small. TINY for me. I wear a size 14 dress size, so I was skeptical of the &#34;one size&#34; approach. Low and behold this dress is fit for a doll, not for an XL like me. And I'm not kidding-- no chance of getting my arms in it, even. I'd say this dress would fit a size 8 top at most.<br /><br />It's too bad because the dress is adorable. It's not made very well, but that's not obvious. It's so cute. I would absolutely keep this dress if was anywhere near fitting me."
3.0,"These where very long in the front and would be better if they had a higher heal. Beautiful shoe, but order smaller as the length looks a tad silly if they are remotely up sized.  Craftmanship is lovely so I'll be gifting these to my mom who can appriciate a longer toe in a shoe as she isn't going to wear them with skinny jeans. A wider leg pant will look more appropriate."
3.0,"Suppper hard to put on , I used it for my rook and the bar isn’t long enough or something it took forever to put on. The sun one wouldn’t lay right either, I just didn’t have the best of luck. Super cute though."
3.0,"Very cheaply made and looks it, but decent for a summer evening cover up."
3.0,Slightly loose in the top and waist area
3.0,Runs very small. Size up!
3.0,Color is not the same as pictured.
3.0,The chain broke on mine and the box it came in the plastic part was falling off when I got it.
3.0,"Dress runs small, especially through the hips, I will be returning it."
3.0,"The vertical front seam is directly down the center (that should be in the back) and the front neck line has the tag on it. I fixed this by chopping the tag off and it looked amazing. Butttttt, then the higher bottom of the dress was high in the back instead of low. Which is annoying, but now the top looks like it actually fits correctly. Shaking my head. Someone really designed the pattern backwards! So bad. Fabric is great though! Professional sheen, and not a knit fabric. No pilling. Good as a house dress."
3.0,"The dress is nice but I had to take it to my cleaners to have them sew the slits a bit and bring it in. When I put it on it looked like I was wearing a ballon however after my small adjustments it was perfect. The fabric is nice and soft and has a quality feel. Since the dress is so cheap, I would say buy a size bigger to have that drape look and it fall off the shoulder, then get your cleaners to tailor it for your body. it cost me an extra $20 to do so."
3.0,"Hook itself is of good quality, the attachments feel like plated plastic. Considered returning but decided plastic bits can go & it’s no loss, liked the hook"
3.0,"I ordered this purse for the style and liked the two handles and straps.  The leather is fine quality for the price, however the brown liner is loose, thin and hangs in the middle of the bag not making my items accessible."
3.0,one of the rings broke off as soon as I was about to take it out its a cheap material other than that its decent
3.0,"Cute design, runs small"
3.0,"Ordered this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it.  It fits her pretty well.  Unfortunately, after only a couple days of wearing it, the top part started to come away from the skirt.  I'm sure it wasn't meant to be worn for hours on end, was probably supposed to be worn just as a Halloween costume.  But, my daughter loves to dress up so much that she wears it constantly.  Luckily, the tear doesn't bother her and she only wears it at home.  Looks nice, but be prepared that it won't last for too long."
3.0,good quality fabric and stitching. should last
3.0,Don't recommend driving with these since its very dark. Great to wear at the beach.
3.0,It's cute just a little too big! Sticks out too much!
3.0,"Got the job done for 6 months! Good enough for the price! I work at the airport and I am constantly moving around trying to look posh and practical at the same time. One of my straps broke today as I was checking in bags at the ticket counter. These DO keep your shirr tucked in and I love them! I ordered another pair as I had a lot of wear on these ones. Good price, decent quality. Curious for these, buy them!"
3.0,I hate how the inside is white and can seen my makeup all over it.
3.0,I would have given 5 stars but the tools broke while I took out links.  Had to pay a jewler to remove links.  Person loves the bracelet style.
3.0,Flannel-like lining much too warm & heavy. The sleeves are also lined. Would be ok for someone who wants heavy warmth.
3.0,LOOKS NICE.
3.0,Like a more substantial material. A little too long for my 5’4” height.  Just my oreference
3.0,It is a very nice hoodie but way to small for my 11 year old who fits small/med adult mens clothing. I bought the 11/12 year old kids & let me tell you... WAY to SMALL!! So exchanging it for adult.
3.0,"I did not have the problem most reported of a size issue, however the skull print is off (its similar but the lines don't look as defined as the image), the seams are mediocre (there's a small piece of fabric that just won't sit right as a result) and there's no care label on the garment. They so tell you in the description it's hand wash, but when I'm sorting laundry I usually look at tags, not the posting on Amazon for instructions."
3.0,Not a great buy. Made cheap and very uncomfortable
3.0,A beautiful piece.  However I looked through my jewelers magnifier and could not locate a stamp that certifies the wing is .925 Sterling Silver.  The chain is coated and the description does not state what kind of metal the chain is.  I am skeptical that the Wing is Sterling Silver as all .925 Sterling Silver pieces have .925 stamped on the items.  I hope someone will clarify this for me.  In the meantime I am going to take this to my Jeweler and have it appraised.  I am allergic to all base metals except for Sterling Silver and Pure Gold.  If I break out I will know for sure. I sure do hope this beautiful item is Pure Sterling Silver.  Has anyone else been able to locate the .925 stamp on the Wing?
3.0,Too large and too heavy
3.0,The shirt was ok in size but my problem was the color. Does not look like the pictures.
3.0,"I like the pattern, but the material is a strange polyester. I think it's cute enough to keep and wear with a denim jacket. I'm 5'10"" and it's long enough to be appropriate for work. there is a hem that was not sewn correctly / completely, so I'll need to fix before washing."
3.0,"The fit is perfect, not to tight not to loose. I guess my expectations were a bit to high as I would assume this ring would like nicer in person as the picture. But sadly painting with gold paint onto of the black ring just looks cheap. Especially when the gold doesn't cover the entire ring,  as there are some parts in the ring that I suppose need another coat of gold. Overall it is a great gift for any potter head like myself. I would just note that every ring would most likely be different."
3.0,Well made heavier fabric nice color but too small
3.0,Material quality was a little thin. Sizing was waaay to small. Would not recommend purchasing since there are better quality items available for the same price.
3.0,Neck to wide
3.0,Way too small. Returning now. Will see how a size bigger fits.
3.0,Ehh the picture is much prettier than the actual bracelet I didn't approve.
3.0,"The shirts feel nice but the sizes were all wrong. I ordered size large, bag states large, but there is 1 small and 4 size medium."
3.0,"The watch is pretty itself but the face is to small for me , I prefer big face watches which I thought how it would look from the pics"
3.0,Bust area to small. But a very nice dress.
3.0,"I like it, but it's very thin and mostly see through. It gets snagged very easily too."
3.0,"Beautiful skirt but it is way too big. Definitely size down. I am 5' 3&#34; weigh 130, waist 26&#34;, and hips 39&#34; (big butt) and bought the small and it is loose (material is stretchy so being only a little loose means another person could fit inside of it) and it comes down three inches past my knees. Nevertheless it's so pretty I have to keep it."
3.0,Watch will not run continuously after it was wound per its initial useage. The clas does not always release without a struggle!<br />I will return it for a credit.<br />A D SCOTTO
3.0,I should have ordered a size up.
3.0,Lighter color green than the picture portrayed.
3.0,Love the colour and softness but it's absolutely shapeless. I wear it with a jacket/cardigan
3.0,I didn’t like how it fit. I returned it
3.0,Way too small... thankfully my wife can use it.
3.0,I was hoping for thicker lenses but that is not the fault of the company.
3.0,"Quality material, not cheap.and flimsy,.  My less than stellar rating is due to the writing being.so small it is difficult to even read."
3.0,"People are complaining that after washing it is ruined. Please read the instructions for washing, this is a hand wash item.  I loved the way it fits.  However the tassels are a little long.  Once they got wet the were coming apart.  I cut the tassels and retied them so they are short."
3.0,"The earrings are cute, but larger than I expected and rather heavy.  OK to wear for patriotic holidays, just not an everyday item."
3.0,"Nice,but small for a 2 xl"
3.0,"For some reason these Truity womens legging in a medium seem to run big for me!<br />The tummy control did nothing, and the material is thinner then my other leggings i have, and I’m not a fan of the color blue for<br />These.<br />The bottom of the legs where even big, but I do have slim legs.<br /><br />My daughter is heavier and taller then me and she likes these, and they fit her better then me. She will be wearing them.<br /><br />I’m almost 5’2, 130 lbs, if that helps."
3.0,"5'5"" 120 lbs Ordered Small.<br />With my height, I thought I could get away with wearing this dress but with the fabric being so light, it flies up in the wind, so I have not yet worn it. Also, the waist is located higher than expected. Not sure when or where or if I'll wear this dress."
3.0,"A little tight at toes.  But  I was very dissapointed because  I received this shoes with  sponge glued at the inner parts<br />and when I took the sponge out, the glue remains at the inner walls hurting my toes skin."
3.0,"It shrunk the first time I washed it. Still fits but not like a tunic, more like a shirt."
3.0,The copper colored ring with hard glitter scratched the silver ring. They were packaged in the same bag. The other two rings were packaged separately so they are scratch free.
3.0,"This dress would have been perfect if it had fit.  Really lovely.  Well made.  I ordered XXL  I wear an 18 and it was a size 6, maybe an 8 on a good day.  All the girls at work loved it and it would not have fit anyone here.  Make the sizes true and I'll order it again!"
3.0,"Fur on detachable hood wasn't shown,  didn't like the look of the fur when I received it,  vacuumed packed so very wrinkled"
3.0,"much bigger than i need, but made well."
3.0,"Somewhat thin material, not a true wrap, and a little long for my 5'2"" self. Very cute design though, otherwise"
3.0,"Nice shoe, but received the wrong size. Fortunately these are for my 2 1/2 yr old son and has room to grow into them"
3.0,They were great until the rubber around the eye area fell off and got lost after about two weeks.
3.0,The scarf is too long
3.0,"The glasses were good, but I didn't receive the American flag pouch that they're supposed to go in!"
3.0,This is a beautiful necklace I just wish it wasn't so small. The chain is small.
3.0,Did not receive this particular watch.
3.0,"Ordered a medium. I’m 36c, 27 waist, 140 lbs. The top fit ok but the bottoms were just a little baggy for me."
3.0,A bit small... They fell out all the time.
3.0,This shoe is not true to size.  It fits extremely large.  I ordered a girls 4.5 and it fits like a women's 6.5/ 7. I'll need to order a 2.5 for it to fit correctly.
3.0,"This is an update to my original revue. While the sweatshirt is made nice and fits well, after only being laundered a few times it started to develop pills in the material. Not real happy with it now and will probably relegate it to around the house use only."
3.0,A little snug great price
3.0,"The product itself was fine.  No flaws noted, but what appears to be a cream background is really a pale green, so it definitely did not work for my setting."
3.0,The suit looks nice but the top is too small for me. I wish it came as separates.
3.0,This belt was great until the ratchet mechanism stopped working after about 3 months of actual use over a 6 month period. I have no recourse but to junk it.
3.0,well the material its fine
3.0,Cute shirt but runs small. I'd size up 1 for a slim fit or 2 sizes for a slouchier fit.
3.0,These took like two months to ship. I love them though. They’re a bit too big and slide down my face constantly but they’re really cute.
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes up thinking that these would be too small. They were just way too big and baggy.
3.0,cheap fabric. doesn't seem very well made.
3.0,"The fit is as expected, however the material is not. It is dull and looks washed out. The colors are not at all vibrant. I'm disappointed. :-("
3.0,"Pretty, but rather weak magnets. I wanted them to experiment with potential lip piercing, and they did not magnetize through my (normal thickness) lip."
3.0,"Cheaply made, cheap shoulder strap and buckle which comes apart unexpectedly.  I returned."
3.0,I wear XL in most shirts. This one was more like a L size. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"I ordered according to the measurements given by the seller and the skirt was still too small around my waist and hips and way too long. The material looked beautiful but there was absolutely no stretch or give to it At All. The skirt was also way too long (I'm only 5'2"") and I could see how it would be difficult to have this skirt hemmed. Such a bummer."
3.0,Was much better than I thought.. fits wonderful.
3.0,Smaller than anticipated. Quality was fine.
3.0,"Evidently they didn't like my review already wrote one but didn't post it. I have been carrying this bag to give it a chance. Wasn't watching to late to send back. Very disappointed in this. It would be a good all around bag if there was a little less material. Has planty of pockets and room, but my problem is there is so much material your contents get lost. You have to really dig to find your keys or anything. When I would zip it up the material would get hung in the zipper and I would have to work with it too get  to work."
3.0,I like the outfit I think it's cute but the tutu is not as soft as i expected and the tutu was also very wrinkled and crunchy if u kno wat i mean lol i am going to try to fix it by soaking it in fabric softener hopefully it will b fine for my daughter's birthday .... If anyone is knows a solution to get out the wrinkles and crunch please let me know. Again this is very cute but could have been packaged better to actually look like the pictures (wrinkles and crunch free).  I was hopeful it was smooth and soft lets see what snuggles can really do 🙂
3.0,Doesn't last long
3.0,Quality not as I expected
3.0,"I am 32 DD, 5'1, 128 lbs.  The length is perfect but the chest and arm area is a little snug.  You have to wear something as a shirt otherwise you will show!  So I usually wear like a white band to cover my bra and wear the dress that way.  I wish it had a belt.  The waist sits high, close to up to the ribs."
3.0,Looks good but poor quality
3.0,I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for my wife when she saw the shirts. So far she has been relatively pleased with the quality but the sizing diagrams provided by the seller aren't up to standards you would typically expect. The dress isn't tight by any means but it's very short and she'll most assuredly have to wear leggings beneath it when she does wear the dress.
3.0,"Size is more for a baby or toddler, not a kid."
3.0,Very cute but snug. Also rather sheer on the top
3.0,"I think that this beanie is cute and soft, however I do strongly feel that it's over priced. For about the same price I can get a 3 pack of name brand beanies. Sure their not as soft but there's many more patterns and options to choose from at a much cheaper and viable cost especially considering the fact that I personally don't use beanies too often and babies grow so fast. I did receive this at a discounted price so I really can't complain but I would not purchase this at full price."
3.0,Pretty color but too small in bust.<br />Returning for larger size or different style.
3.0,"Very soft.  Not cashmere.  fit is okay.  not as long as I thought they would be.  thumb hole definitely too small.  will have to cut it or return the items.  Was able to wear for about 5 minutes.  they would be nice and warm, but the small opening started to cut off the circulation to my thumb."
3.0,Not easy to put on or take off. Once it is on works great!
3.0,"Too small, thought they were bigger,pretty tho."
3.0,Item was to big so i ended up keeping lets be honest who returns underwear
3.0,Nice but small and short
3.0,"I ordered x-large, usually wear large and it was still a little short on sleeeve length. Otherwisw ok."
3.0,Its cute but it is not for weather below 30 degrees as the wind bites right through the fabric. But for the price its cute for fall early winter.
3.0,"Bought this dress to be a costume, the dress itself is not very covered if it is very transparent so if in a bright light you can see through it. The dress is proper size for the bottom half but for top half if you have a bigger bus you might want to go up a size. The dress length for me who is 53, and 147 pounds fit as expected but top half was tighter than expected. However the dress was great I bought a size 8 typically I am a size 6."
3.0,"It will serve the purpose. However, I was looking for something a little more flattering"
3.0,"Pretty watch, but band was thinner than I expected."
3.0,"The photos on the sales page make these look much nicer than they are. The garnets are not set evenly. The teardrop is way &#34;flatter&#34; than I expected 9I expected a rounder drop) and the teardrops are cloudy...far beyond shown in the pics. Seeing them in person, I feel they were worth maybe $8-10 not $22+"
3.0,"These shorts were returned.  They seem to be pretty nice shorts and fit as expected however the HEAVY fabric was not what my husband wanted.  I had hoped that the description ""summer tactical"" would have been a lighter-weight cargo cotton and quick-drying fabric."
3.0,Looks exactly as pictured. Clips are kinda  flimsy and string is a little short for my liking. But it does the job.
3.0,"I’m disappointed cause I really wanted it, but I got Apple Watch Series 3. This band was for different smart watch"
3.0,"The top was loose and did not look good on me. I did not keep it, wish it would have worked out.<br /><br />The shorts are a good fit and super cute, so still giving stars."
3.0,"This is a nice watch, Comfortable, and I get a lot of compliments on it but… The watch hands are gold and thin which makes it hard to read."
3.0,These were very easy to install after removing my scratched Costa lenses but the quality definitely doesn’t compare. These lenses seem to get dirty and smudged easily. I feel the need to wipe them down with a cloth every time I put them on which I didn’t have to do with the costa lenses. I was hoping for slightly better clarity too but there not terrible given their price.
3.0,"Fits okay. Not true to color though. Not a solid black, more like washed out black"
3.0,"Check the other reviews on sizing.  The other thing that is somewhat of a pain is trying to connect the clasp.  You almost need to sit down to get it threaded through.  it also is a bit loose but not sure if that affects the Apple Watches' ability to read your heart rate accurately. Other than that, it's feels good on the wrist."
3.0,"Love the weight and are warm, but after a long cold winter they seem to lose their elasticity"
3.0,The lace is easily tore
3.0,"The sizing is way strange here. I ordered a small from the numbers supplied and my usual size as a reference. This dress is way wide and very short. I am going to be able to use it with a belt to cinch the waist and some kind of tank behind it. It does not look like the pictures this way, but kind of makes a 'Ariel wrapped in a sail' look."
3.0,What is with everything being a crop top lately? Too short to wear out of the house.
3.0,"The earrings are much bigger than I anticipated.  However, they seem to be made nicely.  If you don't like heavy earrings, then I wouldn't purchase.  they weigh my earlobes down, which I am not a huge fan of.  But overall, very pretty!"
3.0,"This was super cute, but I had to return it because it was too small.  I always buy this size, but it was wayyyy too small."
3.0,Size is smaller than expected. My daughter could not fit it but is very cute.
3.0,"We were not able to wear this... My head.. average size woman, my husband, or our sons head were all to big. However it seems to be very durable and we have actually decided to hang it on the wall for a decoration."
3.0,"Cute.  Nice colors.  A bit larger than I expected, but my fiance likes them and says they're perfect for him and his groomsmen.  They're all pretty fancy, so the boutaneers are a good match for them.  Also, shipping was quicker than expected."
3.0,I loved this keychain for my boyfriend but it did tend to get scratched up easily and the letters fade away a little bit but other than that it’s pretty cute
3.0,It’s cute though it’s a bit unflattering. I was also under the impression this dress was embroidered a bit but it’s not. Still cute and will still wear it.
3.0,"Really cute dress but it's too small.  I should have gone with a medium but I looked at how people rated the fit and ended up with a dress that is too snug to wear.  Wish I could exchange it but that does not seem to be an option, too bad I'll have to return."
3.0,It would be better if the star cluster was not a sticker.
3.0,"The idea was cute but the bow tie was literally a tie around the button, my LO would have broken that instantly. Plus it did not not sit straight."
3.0,"On-line reviews said it ran large, so I ordered a size smaller.  It is so long though that it drags the ground.  I<br />I'm hoping after its washed and dried, it shrinks."
3.0,"I like the Masks appearance but the elastic bands that wrap around the wearers ears, although adjustable, were too tight and ultimately I had to replace them on both masks."
3.0,I bought a pair of blue ones from here that I loved! They hit over my belly button and at my ankle- which is hard to do since I’m 6’1. Unfortunately when I ordered the gray pair they fit differently. They went barely at my hips and above my ankle line.  I’m not sure why the same style and size would make a difference?
3.0,This looked better in the pics online than it did in real life. Fits well though & good quality
3.0,They are just wide.
3.0,Shirt is cute but runs small. I ordered a 4T for my 3yo so she could get more wear out of it but it was too tight. Should have ordered a 5.
3.0,Love this dress....but the material sucks.....
3.0,"looks great, i just hate that even when the straps are tight they keep falling of my shoulder, and when you move around you hear a weird squeak. the bra itself is pretty cute."
3.0,It’s a very cute shirt but was too small based on my usual size. It’s also a little more see through then i expected it to be based on the pictures.  i got a size M
3.0,"The metal cords that these fasten with do not fasten securely enough. We attached these tags to our luggage before our last flight, and every single one of our checked bags was given back to us without these tags. I can only assume they came undone and fell off during transit."
3.0,"A little disappointed in these pants. They are more of a jegging than a jean and its pretty obvious to others looking at you that you're not wearing &#34;real pants&#34;, also I know that the pockets/seem placement is supposed to be flattering, but it seemed a little awkward to me how they ended up on my frame. If you're looking for more of a jegging then this would work well for you, but I guess I was a little disappointed since I wanted more of a real pair of skinny jeans"
3.0,Arrived broken not worth the hassle of returning
3.0,kinda short. kinda wide. not as fitted as in the picture
3.0,"I ordered in tan and pink. They fit, but I just did not like the style on my body. They seem well made and the fabric was not see-through."
3.0,"This is a really sweet rose gold necklace that I wanted to love. I had plans to wear it with jeans and a t-shirt and with a more dressy outfit on those rare date nights. I tried it on and was delighted by the real look of the metal and small but glittery stones. Alas, this love affair was not  meant to last. Within a matter of minutes of wearing this necklace the two strands twisted into a tangled mess. I've tried several other times to get this little beauty to stay put but without success. On the positive side, the presentation, complete with a pink jewelry bag, iis lovely, the romance card is a nice touch (although it's printed so it opens the opposite direction of traditional cards, and  the price is ok. Too bad it's annoying to wear."
3.0,Doesn't help you track the ball any better.
3.0,Tiny studs instead of dangle earrings but was packaged nicely and came with a hair accessory. Description needs to be updated so customers know what they are receiving.
3.0,Runs very small! Order up a few sizes.
3.0,It's nice but it fits larger than expected. It's long and goes past my butt because I'm short and busty
3.0,I very much love this dress! I ordered the black and gray and was disappointed that it was a eggplant purple with light purple sleeves. I love the thumb holes I always cut my shirts to have them. Would be happier if it was black but whatever it is what it is...just be warned it's not black even though the picture and description says it is.It is still adorable! I also ordered a small it's just above my knees and I'm about 5 ft also if you have big breast area then get a medium.
3.0,Cute but they only sent one zero and three double zeros and the smaller sizes broke in the mail
3.0,The emblem is smaller than I expected.  The ring is comfortable and durable.
3.0,"it is ok, for the price. There was a small stain on the side, it is not visible when i wear it but it is still a stain on a new cloth.."
3.0,"Love how I can style the straps how I want. You can see side boob with this jumper but it's not too bad. I'm 5'7&#34; & 130lbs & usually i wear a S or M. I bought this in M & it fits great.<br /><br />02/07/17 was saving this for my January trip to Puerto Rico. When I put it on, the seam was ripped on the side. Only way I would be able to cover it is if I had my hands by my side the wholenight. I can sew it myself, but I'm disappointed that I have to alter it before I can wear it & disappointed I wasnt able to wear it in PR for my birthday."
3.0,"It's a good design; however, the strap is built for a tall/larger person.  It doesn't adjust (enough) for a short person so I had to scissors, needle and thread to customize it to fit me."
3.0,Pretty dress that hugs curves nicely.  Just a bit baggy around the arms and sleeves. Received many compliments.  My jewelry attached to the dress and pulled runs all over it.  Unfortunately it was a one time wear.
3.0,"Fun, easy hat. Bought in black. Very comfortable but faded so quickly and really lost a decent shape after a couple weeks."
3.0,Got a 5x because I like my hoodies really baggy. Fits like maybe a 2x
3.0,I needed inexpensive black leggings with pockets for wfh/errands.  These were good enough for the price but you get what you pay for. It doesnt have too much compression or as high waisted as i'd like.  It also has a wierd elastic waistband but nonetheless comfortable enough to sleep in/do housework.
3.0,Looks like it will have more structure but it is really floppy.
3.0,"It's okay. My Puff fits nicely in the cap, but despite how much I adjust the tightness it's still loose around the ear area.  Color is as pictured"
3.0,glad the XS fit my lady. She's in good shape. has nice size tits but the shirt still fit her.
3.0,"ZI could not tell if the watch was made in Japan or not. The owners book had Made in China but the watch Had the word JAPANESE on the back. I want one that is made in japan,"
3.0,"The material is really thin so it does show all your curves or in my case, fat rolls. Also fits a little small. It is very long and went past my feet but I was ok with that. I'm 5'5"""
3.0,Very low waisted so I would size up.
3.0,"I like this but sizing seems inconsistent -- regular size (L) was too big, but the medium received appeared was wrinkled and not properly folded in the plastic bag..It appeared to have been worn (sleeves turned up) and washed and had shrunk (?)."
3.0,"See through, buttons don’t button, not very soft"
3.0,"I LOVE the footbed but the top strap is much too big, the shoe will fall off my foot. I tried putting layers of moleskin inside the strap but not enough. Very sad I have to return. This applies to both pairs I ordered. I wish the straps were adjustable!"
3.0,This dress is like wearing a tshirt that bunches on the sides. I wasn't happy with the fabric or the fit.
3.0,Still on the fence about these pants.  the way they are tailored is just all messed up.  waist is fine but long and baggy.  the knee pads are more like shin pads and way to far down my leg.  i can pull the pants up higher to adjust knee pads bc there is no room in the crotch.  unpleased about all that but they are a cool design just don't know if ill actually be comfortable when using these....
3.0,"Comes with a lot of pouches but the belt fell off of it. For this price, along with the pouches, it is a hood addition to your survivial kit. I mostly like the pouches, but pack has lots of space, good for clothes, a truck bag, or anything that's not ultra heavy duty"
3.0,"I can't figure out how to post a picture with it but this romper isn't really like the picture at all. It's a thin cheap material and it's bright white. The buttons are also very cheap. Overall it wasn't horrible, definitely wearable, I just didn't like the colors so I'm returning it"
3.0,"It's ok, I guess. Pretty. Just not at all what I expected. It's a lot smaller than the picture alludes."
3.0,"Beautiful feathers, but when they arrived there was a whole section about a centimeter long of one of the feathers missing like it was cut out :( For the price not bad though, I'm still going to wear them. I just wish the one side didn't have a missing chunk."
3.0,The size is much smaller than expected
3.0,"Good price, bought for my husband. Perfect for what I was looking for but the sandals’ sole was scratched, maybe in the warehouse? It was a gift so I am disappointed because they almost looked used. My husband still likes them but they should take better care before delivery."
3.0,"Not the best quality, can't really complain because the price point is more than reasonable."
3.0,Love the look of the bracelet but the hair on it falls off quickly with use and then it doesn't look so hot.
3.0,"I ordered 18-24 months and as soon as i tried them on on my 18 month old he cried that he wanted them off, they were too tight."
3.0,"You just can’t compare this to a Nike or UA sweatshirt.  That’s what I was doing.  It’s fine.  He wanted a pink and a teal sweatshirt...he got them.  Different brands, but both of same quality and price.  It doesn’t launder especially well - but you get what you pay for.  If he didn’t loose so many things and when he starts to take care of it more I would spend more money on special colors.  Right now I do that for Black, Navy, Grey and Reds.  We also live in the south - so a hoodie is basically your jacket down here which is why they have so many."
3.0,"First off, this vest is HUGE! I'm 6'2"" and 225 lbs and this vest drowns me. I had to adjust the straps all the way in and it still barely fit over the top of my waders and jacket. It's a big vest! The second issue I had is that the center zipper opened up from the middle (not the top or bottom) the first time I used this on the river, and the side zippers wouldn't stay up so I lost an expensive fly box when the pocket came open. I really wanted to like this vest, but it is cheaply made. When I went to return it I found out that I was responsible for the return freight to China which turned out to be nearly what I paid for the vest. On the plus side, all the pockets are very nice and you can store a ton of gear in this vest, so if you're just looking for an entry-level vest for a very big fisherman, this might be right for you."
3.0,"Beautiful mask with bold graphics, BUT breathing and speaking through this material? Not so much. This material has little ""breathability""  so the airflow will just go around it or even worse you'll suffocate......"
3.0,"They seem comfortable and well made but are way bigger than the sizing indicates. My son has been solidly in a size 4 for quite a while now but he couldn’t even walk without tripping in these. I measured his foot beforehand and compared it to the chart and it seemed like we would just be getting some room to grow, but they ended up unusable."
3.0,Nice shirt I wear it as a sleep shirt way too big for a cove up
3.0,Love the colors but top itself seems to be made for petite height person. Kind of short on my 5'5 torso.
3.0,"my wife and i use them when driving on just out on sunny days and one of them, on the left side you were not able to read anything."
3.0,Lens are perfect size for my glasses.<br />Connector clips are somewhat large and annoying to vision.
3.0,"Fits a little snug, completely see through. Not made great, the stripe across the front is crooked on mine"
3.0,These do not fit small glasses at all. I had to cut mine to fit which makes it a safety issue so that makes them absolutely useless.
3.0,Low price cheap quality
3.0,Leather quality is fine but lace is a smaller less robust lace than from other sources.
3.0,You get a lot of them for the money  however I don't like the material it looks like they had some leftovers and made them. But my  daughter  likes them for her baby so we kept them
3.0,"Nice concept but too cumbersome, hangs too low and too big"
3.0,Originally ordered a Medium and it was too small. The shirt is cute and good quality so I decided to order an XL. Hopefully it will fit much better because I really like the shirt.
3.0,Its a good fit and the print is vibrant but its 100% polyester which is not the best for a night dress
3.0,This dress is something I would not wear in public it is more like a nightgown and shorter than I had anticipated
3.0,pattern and color as pictured. Sizing overall ran large but especially so in the bust and waist. length is as listed.
3.0,"I wanted to like them, but the crotch hung an inch or two lower than I liked, and the waist was a little large (me: 5'3, 118 lbs, 25&#34; waist), and there was a little too much flow for my taste. The length was perfect, as other reviewers said was good for shorter woman. I returned them."
3.0,NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE
3.0,These are the softest leggings I’ve ever worn but they are definitely thin and see through. Will have to wear something to cover my butt
3.0,The new edition of this shoe is definitely for narrow feet unless you go up 2 sizes. Then you have a chance of the fitting. I like the originals. Please bring them back.
3.0,"I did not love the fabric, plus the sleeves were too tight but the hips were too big."
3.0,"Didn't care for the shiny material, and there is a strange brown squiggle over the design that makes. no sense. Well, it was cheap, will do until I find a better looking one."
3.0,Item arrived on time. I love the color but the end of the band doesn’t stay secured in the circle band holder. The band that has one metal stick in the clasp stays secured better.
3.0,"I purchased this last year for a Walking Dead themed Halloween party and the product didn't really excite me as I had been hoping. Yes going into it I knew it was a prop, but overall the quality of the hair and design looked very fake and felt like a waste of money. All of my Walking Dead fanatic guests barely acknowledged it as something relevant to my party decor because it screams random fake prop head more than it does Hershel."
3.0,Definitely Okay for lounging… or something quick to throw on to run to the market.
3.0,Go a size up from what you think will fit you. I ordered a large and need an xl.
3.0,theyre ok
3.0,Legs are too long.  I've cut them off and will re-set them.
3.0,My only complaint and reason I returned this shirt was the collar. From the picture the shirt I ordered did not have a mock turtleneck. Unfortunately the shirt that delivered had a weird collar design. The fabrics was really nice and color was beautiful.
3.0,"I thought this product would be amazingly comfortable, but my foot slips forward and therefore it is not comfortable, fI would not recomand it."
3.0,The pants are like leggings but have no grip to stay up. They constantly ride down and i had to keep pulling them up. Frustrating
3.0,"The shirt is a bit of different color, Instead of being as baggy as the image shown, the material is thick. It looks ugly when i don't wear it but it's alright and bearable when I put it on, damn I'm sexy."
3.0,"Size 9 but the heel keeps coming off, the gel doesn't help."
3.0,"Fabric light weight, did not lay correct for me, thought the pleat in front would cover my belly but it layer right on it. Size was good, not the fabric."
3.0,The leggings fit great size large. The only thing is the bra top fits too big on the crisscross it droops instead of laying flat.
3.0,It was somewhat small but my baby loved it and it was so warm :)
3.0,Pictures of sweater are very cute. It’s in person looks a little cheap.
3.0,"These shirts are HUGE. It's only a small exaggeration to say that you could use one of there as sleeping arrangements on your next camping trip. I Ordered the XL (I'm 6'2&#34;, 215, and some of my XLs fit a little small) it was very baggy. The amazon size chart put an XL at a 44-46 chest. This XL is a 54-56 chest."
3.0,"Very cute however, there is brown glue on the yellow suede, unable to replace (for esthetic defect from manufacturer, or wash off defect at home) as my size was sold out when I received them, had to wait for nicer weather to wear them (which surpassed the 1 month return policy), have worn twice now and the sole is coming unglued from the shoe, and the strap around the ankle is much looser on the left shoe. For $40, I'm disappointed. On a positive note, the materials feel a little more legitimate than my last attempt at buying Amazon shoes (returned immediately ) which were $45 and made from craft foam"
3.0,"This was beautiful,  but the chain broke 5 minutes into my Halloween party.. i had to tuck it into my bottom the whole night. Really a shame beacuse the whole ensemble was beautiful."
3.0,"The color is more blue than green and it is pretty flimsy. Fits Ok. I wont wash it,as it doesn't look like it will take a washing.....a one time wear probably~"
3.0,"The print is nice and clear, quality is as expected but it's a bit snug. One size will not fit all."
3.0,The Stones are so tiny that you can barley see them! But great price.
3.0,I have a D-cup chest and I ordered the CO and it was too small. Fit extremely tight and not comfortable to run in at all. Also see-thru.
3.0,"I like the leggings, they're soft and comfortable, but I ordered three black and got only one pair black and the other two are blue and brown."
3.0,"I'm 5'5'' and for me this dress is a bit shorter than I expected, and with leggings underneath it just looks odd. Will keep it though, but to basically wear it around the house."
3.0,It was huge
3.0,"sleeves are tight fiting, color is good, not as soft a chenille as i was hoping for"
3.0,"I'd have given it an extra star but it came with a huge hole in the seam of the arm. Luckily it can be fixed so I won't need to return it, but I'd expect better quality for the cost."
3.0,I purchased this dress at the recommendation of a plus sized fashion blogger. I loved the look of the dress on her and figured that it would look great on me too. She posted her size among with her height and according to her information it she was the same size as me. I ordered it thinking it was going to fit. That wasn't the case. This was a tent. It was HUGE. I mean falling off me. I am a regular size 22. I'm 5'7&#34; and 272lbs. ( yes I'm a big girl) The length was perfect (falling just below my shin). The color and fabric are great. But the XXXL (3X) that I ordered wasn't the right size. I would love to return it but I wore it already. I would recommend ordering 2 sizes down. I plan to reorder a different size.
3.0,They are very warm but definitely need to be worn over socks or leggings to stay up on my legs.
3.0,"Looks better on the model than me. The one on the model seems to have a much better fit, especially the neckline. At 6'2&#34; 220 lbs I was just glad the size 1/2X fit at all.  I bit short for me and my bare ass hangs out.  I bought some ruffled red panties to cover my bare ass.  The lack of any sleeves is a bit bothersome too, as it looks a bit funny.  I do not have enough time to get some fishnet to cover my arms.  But Halloween only is one day.  It will do the trick.  The biggest problem was with the red bows. The white stocking are not included.  The bows are very flimsily attached to a safety pin. As you can see by the photos it does look better on the model.  Still waiting on my fake boobs and red panties.  I am hoping boobs will fix the neckline."
3.0,"The design is adorable, my only issue is how the nose metal doesn't stay centered, it kept moving and it doesn't quite block smells, because  how the thin the material is. Although, great for breathing if you have to do a lot of physical work."
3.0,Good case. Design is exactly how described. Good shipping. Only problem is it breaks easy and is hard to remove. Overall it's a alright case.
3.0,"Ordered a Xlarge, it's more like XXlarge. Folds from shipping require a iron. I have washed it two times. They are still very deep."
3.0,"This shirt is made super small. I ordered 2 sizes up and it just fits when layered. I do like it and the price was not high, so it's worth it. I don't mind the neck being cut sideways because it lays as it should off the right shoulder. The sizing is the biggest issue. Shipping was not too long either. It arrived within a week."
3.0,"This dress is not bad. I mean, it's not super great, the fabric is a weird quality but not necessarily bad. It's very long, which could be good or bad depending on what you prefer and the ties allow it to fit properly at the waist and at the bust, which is rare for plus size clothing. The thing is, i think women have just been starved for cute plus size clothing for so long that we're willing to lower our standards on quality. If i'd seen this dress in a shop for $30.00 I wouldn't have bought it but if you're looking for a one time wear to blow people away at your pool party or whatever, you won't be disappointed."
3.0,Too small and shows up my cellulite lol
3.0,It's nice but I am not happy with the sleeves they are not puffy like the picture...not at all!
3.0,Love the design and fit. The only thing is the wiring running down the sides is very uncomfortable.
3.0,Not that crazy about it.
3.0,"Very nice quality, but had to return because they sat too close to my face"
3.0,It's OK for what I needed. The zipper sometimes gets stuck and you have to really work with it to zip. It does have a smell. I guess that's why it came with a sachet. But doesn't last long.
3.0,a little tight but it should do as long as I don't gain weight
3.0,should have adjustable band
3.0,The hat seems beautiful and very well made!<br />I read the reviews that these tend to be small so I chose the Large size for my 10 year old but it is too small for her. Not sure how the manufacturer does the sizing.
3.0,"I like to wear my skirts high-waisted. I'm only 5 feet tall, so that's not hard to do. This skirt was to short even for regular wear."
3.0,"Looks good, but the Quality not as expected."
3.0,Great awesome only little longer for me but it's ok
3.0,Like the shirt but to long. Did not see it offered in petite sizes
3.0,"These are extremely comfortable. 👍 I was hoping to use these during my period, but the pad's adhesive doesn't stick to the fabric. Another draw back is that the fabric seems to attract lint and pet hair.<br /><br />Fit: I'm 5'8&#34; and very curvy. In pants I wear between a 10 & 14, usually a 14. I ordered xl, which is comfortable and works, but I probably could have gotten a large and been fine."
3.0,Too short and jean material seemed thin
3.0,"The photos look great. The tie is well enough made. But the actual gold color is a fairly dark, almost orange color. If you want a golden yellow, this isn't it."
3.0,"I have three other pairs of these shorts in size L, 2 Black, 1 Navy and they fit fine.  Love the feel and fit for running. Ordered a gray pair and the fit is tighter.  Could be the material is not as stretchy as the others.  Was a bit uncomfortable so I sent them back."
3.0,"I got a 3xl it fit a bit lil on the tight side, this 3xl feel like a 2xl but"
3.0,it broke very easy. only wore it once :(
3.0,"This is a cute little top and the color is 100% true to the product image. I really like the cold shoulder design and I think the length is really nice too. I do think that it's a little boxy in person, which is the reason for my three star rating. It's just not as flattering as I was hoping."
3.0,"I absolutely love the look of this purse. It's exactly the right size, has good sections and the charms are cute. I especially like the rings on the straps. That said, I'm extremely disappointed in the lining. I've only been using this purse for a week and I've already got holes in the lining in two places and the threading creating the inner two pockets gave way so now it's just one pocket that is so loose anything I put in it should out into the main area."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:5177362bde8511aaf660f2c61e74230f]] Soft material but it definitely runs true to size and maybe a little bit bigger since it’s stretchy. I would have kept it had it been a little bit more form fitting.
3.0,"This is a great-looking watch. Some of my friends are ""watch guys"" and have commented on the sleek style and color of this watch. However the clasp is pretty bad. If I hadn't paid so relatively little for this piece (considerably less than they're offering it here), I would be steaming mad. The problems are the following: 1) The clasp is very difficult to get on/off for adjusting the band. I took it to three professional watch people and two of them gave up, while the third had a heck of a time getting it on and off; 2) More annoyingly, the clasp releases much too easily. The buttons which release the clasp are quite large (the largest I've seen on this type of clasp) and so when one bends his/her wrist the clasp releases way too readily.<br />If the clasp were just a wee bit better, I would give this watch a 4 or 5.<br />It's still not bad for the $200 I paid for it."
3.0,"I find the fabric very uncomfortable and in need of constant ironing. It is also not the best fit for me,"
3.0,Does not appear as it do in the photo. The bottom of jumper is too wide to fit inside of fitted boots. And the crouch is loose not tight fitted like the photo shows. Upper area is fine and fits perfectly. I would not purchase ever again
3.0,Quality is all right. It is easy to use hand get its job done. Each small section is spacious enough to fit all my glasses. A small complaint though is that the box cannot stay open due to its loose linkage.
3.0,"Son loves the shoes, fyi color darkens in wet grass."
3.0,"The description says there is a pocket, but there is no pocket. Very disappointing!"
3.0,"Product was as described. I ordered a size up based on prior reviews and it fits well in size. It was shorter than I had anticipated. Due to the material type, the dress is constantly riding up."
3.0,Colar looks worn and stretched out.<br />Material is thin a somewhat rough.<br />I ordered an xl but looks like a M/L at most.<br />Order up but I definitely recommend finding a different seller to get shirts from.
3.0,"This ring was a little bigger than expected. I am on the smaller size but, when adjusted to as small as it would go it was still loose on my thumb. Also, the plating on it gets snagged on clothing and eventually breaks off, so it's not the best quality, but it is pretty and I still like it,"
3.0,"These came fast and are about what I expected, however, they are advertised as a cashmere blend. They are not. As you can see from the tag in the picture, they are mostly sheep wool, not cashmere as cashmere comes from a specific type of goat. I thought with the price on these, it was a great deal. I guess it was too good to be true."
3.0,We bought a matching pair.  The fit was awesome.  Just adjust as needed.  Didn’t pinch.  But mine scratched very easily.  I didn’t wear it for long because of the scratches.
3.0,sleeves were too short so mitts squashed hands otherwise a nice warm suit
3.0,Several of the stones had fallen out of the set!
3.0,Doesnt look great on me anyway.
3.0,Blue looks a little different in person. Ok for a fun look
3.0,It’s okay for the price.
3.0,"Bought this dress for my daughter - typically a size small.  Order the small but was way too small (almost an XS) I say. Exchange for a Medium, was able to close the zipper that goes to her waste. Front fitted well, although a little big in the bust area (nice built in bra) but the amount of fabric from back of shoulder on both sizes too small to close properly with ribbon included. Had to return. Very disappointed could not wear. Unfortunately had to return both."
3.0,"They're comfortable, but  tend to slip off when walking around."
3.0,I bought this towards the end of June 2018 to use as an everyday purse. The knit developed a small hole in Sept which had steadily grown larger over time. I really liked the color and the size but I think I would have liked a thicker strap as well.
3.0,color and style
3.0,This is great but a Marine is not a Soldier.  Only mend and women in the Army are called Soldiers.  Marines and Marines.
3.0,I'll keep it short and simple.the wallet looks great in my opinion but it's simply way too big. I used it for a week and couldn't handle it anymore.
3.0,"The wire post began to tarnish about 30 days after I bought these. The look however, PERFECT - larger sized than most drop earrings.. I get compliments all the time."
3.0,"The top itself is fairly cute, however, the fit isn't the best. It's just kind of big and boxy without any feminine fitting to it. The material is kind of weird and didn't seem very breathable. Runs large. Overall, it was too large for my thinner body and didn't fit me flattering, so I returned it. I think for plus sized or larger endowed women, it would fit much better. Wouldn't buy again unless they started using better fabrics and started tailoring the fit better to accentuate the feminine shape more."
3.0,It's cute but too small. Like it looks better on my 4 year old.<br />Update:<br />It wasn't so bad after all. You just got to stretch it out a bit then it's fine. I thought about returning it but in the end it worked out.
3.0,"Transaction was smooth, arrived quickly The purse is cute but overpriced for what it was."
3.0,Material is rough and scratches
3.0,"I like the silk material it keeps the moisture in your hair but there is not enough of the material to properly cover your hair. Cap slips back leaving your hairline exposed. For the price I paid, I expected more. cap keeps shape when washed but I feel like it shrunk after the first wash. The cap should be redesigned with a wider band around the edge, more room in the cap and longer material left off at the ends so you can tie the ends at the front, which would secure the cap even more. cap is best for very short hair styles."
3.0,"I am in love with this bag, but had to return it because the buckles rub against the inner arm...other than that, it seems to be of very good quality and big enough to carry my phone and cards."
3.0,"This is a good piece, but I expected more.  It doesn't lay on my neck as smooth as I would have liked and it looks cheaper than it shows in the picture."
3.0,perfect for teenage daughter
3.0,"This Bellivera sun hat is nicely constructed. They used quality materials and the stitching is great. The band is comfortable and the tilting hardware, though a little stiff at first, clicks into position as it should. Unfortunately, I don’t like the visor itself. Once you remove both sides of the cling wrap you’ll see that the visor slightly distorts your vision. It’s not bad, but it’s noticeable. The visor also reflects back what you are wearing so you’ll have random colors flashing in front of you. As someone who is sensitive to the sun, the uv protection on this is minimal and I definitely felt the sunlight glaring down on my face."
3.0,"Unfortunately, I had to order these twice, before I got a satisfactory pair.  The first that came were nice-sized, but rather a dull gray color, without the green/blue iridescence that I was expecting, in order to match a necklace that I already had.  Also, one of the pearls had dent-marks, which, while not super-noticeable, was not the quality I had hoped for.  The second pair that came were considerably better in terms of color and condition, but the pearls themselves were somewhat smaller.  I understand that with a natural product like pearls, the objective is to match earrings by the pair, so that some variation between pairs can be expected.  However, I don't get why the backings, especially on the second pair, were SO tiny and flimsy, that you could barely pick them up.  Fortunately the posts and the rest of the gold on the earrings seemed sturdy enough to hold up to wear, but I will probably use another set of gold backings with them when I do.  They do have a nice, dressy look when worn.  Overall, okay for the price, but not too impressed with having to order twice to get what I wanted."
3.0,The outfit is cute.  It is very thin material.
3.0,"Super cute but way too short, even for sandals! I’m only 5’5”"
3.0,"I really want to like these. But the waist band pulls in to to tight. They are so comfy with the legs , a little long but the waste elastic is so uncomfortable."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but you could literally see all of my underwear."
3.0,La correa se rompe rápido
3.0,"Beautiful and well made, but HUGE.  I mean touch your shoulders they are HUGE. Yet, unbelievably light and  very well made.  I purchased to wear daily, but I cannot even make these work on the weekend and I love statement earrings.  If the seller could make them 2-3 sizes smaller they could work and be amazing."
3.0,"It’s a pretty dress but the top is thick and in summer it’s hot, also not a fan of the silky odd material for the bottom. A bit snug as well.  However it still looked awesome just wish the material was more of a softer stretch cotton material."
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these, one in XL and one in 2X. I am 5'4&#34; and 163 lbs. I usually wear a large in tops. My first impression was disappointment, as the dresses I received (except for the stripes) look nothing like the one the model is wearing in the photograph here on Amazon. They are cut strangely and rather than slits on the sides, they have these huge, almost silly-looking U-shape cutouts. They have ordinary boat necklines, and if your shoulders aren't too broad, you'll be able to pull it down off a shoulder, but unless you're truly tiny, it will not hang way off the shoulder like it does on the model. The XL fit me well and looked slenderizing on me. The 2X did have a little extra fabric, and was baggier and less slenderizing on me than the XL. I gave it to a relative who is about 40 lbs heavier than me, and she fit it, although it doesn't really hang off her shoulder. I noticed that both the XL and the 2X have exactly the same size neck opening. I also noticed some sloppy stitching and broken threads. Only because of the very reasonable price, did I decide to keep it and wear it around the house. I may even get a couple more, (at this low price), because they do make nice house dresses and the fabric feels soft and comfortable."
3.0,"I measured before I ordered it,and thought it would be fine, but it still was too small. My mistake. This opening, to the female end, is 3 cm. All of my equipment have 3.5 cm openings. Seems really short. From end to end, the STRAP is 11 1/4 long. SO will return."
3.0,This dress is true to size but the color was so off.
3.0,not as good as I expected
3.0,This is my second time ordering these. The quality is not as good as it was previously.
3.0,ok rings
3.0,This product is thin and appears to be made by cheap materials. Bc it’s light weight it may get more use... but I’m concerned about the size. I would’ve returned it for a smaller version but they don’t have any in stock. Does not shrink when washed.
3.0,The fit is not quite right. The top is too short so it feels like a crop top. Also the fabric is like a cheap polyester and not comfortable for sleeping. I went ahead and returned the item. Too bad because it was cute.
3.0,"This shirt is super cute and fit great. I only wore one time and noticed it is already falling apart. I'm scared to wash it now in fear it will fall apart. I guess it is ok for the price, I just expected it to last a little longer...."
3.0,I really liked the cute print on these PJs but I find that the material is cheap and they stretch out tremendously even after just a short time wearing. Wound not recommend and will not buy again. Disappointed.
3.0,"UPDATE: After the last time I updated my review, the company contacted me again, and offered to send 2 new crossbody straps, as well as refunding the original purchase price.  In the meantime, the &#34;lost&#34; strap showed up.  The 2 new straps took a month to come, instead of the 1-2 weeks I was promised, but they did eventually show up.  So now I have 2 purses, and three intact crossbody straps.  So far, none of the newer crossbody straps have broken, but the look like they are all made the same, so I am living in fear that they are going to break again.  At least I have extras for now, and a free purse out of the deal.  Not sure I will buy from this company again, but since I have a free purse, and extra straps, I can raise my rating to a 3.  They try to make things right, even if they take a LONG time to do it, but I wish they just made a better product.<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I like the style of this purse, but I have had a time with it.  The purse came in a timely manner, and I liked it right away.  It holds everything it should for a &#34;mom&#34; purse.  The problem is that in just under 2 weeks, the clip on the crossbody strap broke.  After leaving a review here, the company contacted me, and offered to send a new handle.  Great.  Except that a week later, it still hadn't shown up.  When I emailed them, they took a day to try to track it down, found it was lost, and offered to replace the entire purse instead (I'm assuming that their stock of complete purses is easier to get to than just a strap).  The new purse came this morning, and I immediately put the new strap on my first purse and left for a day of things to do.  As I was getting ready to head home for the day, the clip on the new strap broke in the exact same spot.  Grrrrr.... The only reason I am not returning this is because I had a hard time finding this purse, and don't have the time to look for a new one.  I use a keychain to replace the strap.  It's pretty sad that a keychain will hold better than the clip that was on the purse!!!!!!!!  I think the &#34;metal&#34; of the clip isn't strong enough.  Maybe it's not even metal, I'm not sure.  Now to just figure out how to manipulate the broken pieces left on the purse from scratching up my hand all the time."
3.0,"The stones in this product is a little dull, does not have much shine to them. The fastener needs to have more mass. It is a little difficult to secure the earrings."
3.0,Don't like the fit
3.0,"Not what I was expecting. I was hoping for the same rich color in wood but they were so dark it was almost black. The wood was fine though, nice and smooth."
3.0,"Not bad, but definitely not the big fluffy bathrobe I was hoping for."
3.0,"Nice quality, but if you are over a size 11M I'd pass. They run tight to size."
3.0,These envelopes were pricy since I didn't use them often.
3.0,"These are really cute, but they have quite an odor. They smell like plastic, probably because of how they were store. Unfortunately, washing did not take the smell out. I may try vinegar next time. Thank goodness I have a spare."
3.0,The length was a tad inappropriate for work
3.0,"I was looking for a beanie that can light my way in the dark when I go outside and shovel some snow or do some night work around the house outside...<br /><br />Thought this was pretty good and for the price it beats others...<br /><br />Order it up and it arrive fine...<br /><br />There is quite a lot of flaw to this design and I hope they improve it..<br /><br />LED: The 5 leds....what can I say, they are those mini LED that stick out in front of the hat and looks just plain in the way. There was nothing to hide . They need to make them flush and hidden inside the hat...lol<br /><br />Battery compartment and Wire: Both of the wire and battery compartment are house right in front of the hat, it just fold inside and nothing else.<br /><br />The wire that hook up to the battery is not well build, you might have to go in and solider those wire in solid.<br /><br />Lighting: You turn the lights on by press a hard to find switch in front of the hat.. As for finding your way in the dark, this LED would just blind you and you would likely trip and fall. It can't even light anything or spot light your way.<br /><br />A very big disappointment!<br /><br />They only good thing is it's made out of wool and I pretty much use it just as that...I took the battery and wire out, might have to get rid of the led and make myself a little mini led night light for xmas....LOL&#62;"
3.0,"I liked the fabric, it was really soft. The cuff on the bottom of the pants was very narrow. If you have skinny ankles you will be fine. Mine are normal size. The cuff on the bottom of the legs was like a banded cuff you find on a jacket sleeve sometimes. Other than that these ran a little tight but not too bad; except the ankle area. If i bought again I would be a size up so when I​ cut the cuff off, I could hem it."
3.0,"The romper itself was cute and good quality, but way too short for me. I read the reviews and others my height (5’ 10”) said the length was great on them. If you’re not as tall as me you’ll probably love it."
3.0,This is really an amazing skirt for events and festivals. But the white slip that's sewn in is not flattering at all. They really should consider a multicolored slip or not having the slip at all. I ended up cutting out the slip and just wearing multi colored leggings underneath...
3.0,Bands are cheaply made. The blue one still works. The pink band broke immediately as I was trying to put it on my watch. Not the best purchase I’ve made.
3.0,I haven't worn it in public yet because I don't like the fit. Nice material though.
3.0,Too short.  Doesn't come down far enough to your pants.
3.0,So soft! Good weighty material and super comfy and long! Love the pockets. My only complaint is that after a couple of wears the decorative straps on the front have all come off on one side. They could be redeem or cut off without interfering too much with the look of the dress but that’s a bit disappointing. Still love the dress!
3.0,Im 5 ft 9&#34; and weight approximately 160lb. I ordered the large size and it feel a little to big. It feels more like an extra large. Although it feels a little big it's also good since ok able to also wear and extra sweater underneath.
3.0,They are nice and cute and all but they don’t stay in place on the kids faces. They slide down because they are silky soft.
3.0,"My five years old daughter likes the feel and design of the shirt.  However, the sleeves were way too long.  I do not know if her arms will grow into it before she becomes too tall for the shirt."
3.0,The entire reason I bought this tshirt was because it was Dri- Fit and it does not feel like dri- fit and has nothing on the tag indicating that it is a dri- fit.  It feels like a plain old cotton tshirt. - Update - I suppose it was ok - it just doesn't feel like a normal dri fit tshirt.  It is 50 cotton 50 polyester so that is apparently what gives it a dri fit name.
3.0,"Arrived quickly.<br />Got a size L (I’m size 12/14), it fit nicely. The material is very thin though. And it’s a touch shorter than I thought...however I think it’s because of my backside that took an inch away from the length."
3.0,"It is warm and nice, but awkwardly shaped. It isn't quite slouchy enough that it looks purposeful, but isn't tight enough to stay in place if you try to wear it closer to your head."
3.0,pant are very wrinkle when you wash them
3.0,For small heads only
3.0,The size are about one size too big. It is also a little see through.
3.0,"The size was just right for the more modern, rectangular shaped glasses.  The clip actually fits on my metal frames - so many other designs just ""float"" on the glasses, move around and come off at the drop of a hat.  I like the brown color; it seems to block more sun for me.  And most importantly, I don't look like a great grandma wearing these.  Comes with a nice storage case, although it's a little big for putting in your purse.<br /><br />Updated 6/14: After 8 months, I went to put them on and both lenses had somehow just fallen off the clips.  They're relatively inexpensive, but didn't last long enough for just occasional use."
3.0,"Pants were too warm and generate a lot of static walking in them. I ended up donating these after a few weeks to Goodwill, just didn’t work out for me."
3.0,"Fit great after washings, got 3 star as colors fading even with cold water washes (the trim washed out first)."
3.0,The material of these pants is what's making me think about returning. It's like thin thin pajama material. They fit ok. I'm 5'2. I knew I'd have to roll it. I got a large but possibly could get away with a medium. For sure have to iron but they will wrinkle right away anyways. Idk. They were 10 bucks. They aren't gonna be high quality.
3.0,Quality is good however I ordered a large (usually wear M) think I could put a shirt under it and it is too small. I probably needed a XXL (US) the way this shirt fit.
3.0,Disappointed with where seamline fell under bust
3.0,The material is kind of cheapie just really thin not a lot of structure. They look was way off do not look anything like the picture. I felt like I was putting a nightgown on and just trying to dress it up with the belt but even then not really happy with it at all
3.0,It is not as good as it is shown on photo. Color is little dull and material is not very good quality. All fits well but sleevs are too long. Finally returned.
3.0,I just got these today I needed something more comfortable to wear to work and they feel like they are going to keep me cool but the only thing is that they are slightly short but I think I can make it work
3.0,"Like the light material and ruffle, don't like that the waist was to small"
3.0,"It was very low cut. I’m not sure if it’s because it was too big, but all my breast was out. even with a plunge bra, my bra still showed."
3.0,"Comfortable to wear, but going to the bathroom in this is a pain! It is not as easy as it sounds...you really have to stretch the damn thing down and pray you don't pee on the fabric...."
3.0,"It’s a nice style, perfect size. Material is cheap, poor quality. Nice for few times only"
3.0,Bit to tight and don't fit well on my shape
3.0,I so wanted to wear these cute shorts. They are very sheet if you hold it up to light but honestly if they fit I would have kept them. Super cute but way too small. I normally wear a large. I ordered a large and XL. They were both way too small and there is absolutely no wiggle room. If you are a normal size small you could fit in these..
3.0,My daughter complains that her ankle bone shuts the lights off when she walks
3.0,Didn’t like the fit or the little cap eyelet sleeve.
3.0,Love the color and all the pockets but 1 of the seams had already started to come unsewn when I got it so that the front flap was coming off. Luckily I have a sewing machine and think I can stitch it back because I don't want to hassle with returning it and reordering it etc...
3.0,"I’d like to give this strap 5 stars for looks and quality construction. However, the metal rivets above the strap loops concerned me enough I didn’t want to chance scratching up my ordered Fujifilm XPro3 camera. Once the camera arrives I may test it out by ordering another one.<br /><br />I guess I could have taped the rivets, but that seemed a bit odd given the good looks of the strap. ONA makes quality camera goods, but the design made me return it unused."
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 120lbs, 32DD, and generally wear an XS or S in tops.  I ordered this in a small.  It fit ok, but not great, it was a little snug in my armpits.  I'm returning this one and going to try a medium."
3.0,"Definitely can be for men or women. Not fitted. But a comfy zip up. Tried to shrink in wash. No luck. I'm 5'2 120-130lbs. Great color but more causal like nighttime walks, or camping as opposed to wearing to work or going out or putting under a jean jacket. Too bulky to layer under jackets. The red bled and the white part faded to pink after being washed. I recommend washing solo for the first couple washes. But overall, I'm glad I bought it."
3.0,Arm opening is a little too large but overall nice dress.
3.0,I suggest two sizes up. Cute but way too small.
3.0,"Bought this for my 6 month old. Material is medium thick cotton, average softness. I liked that it had the features I was looking for- 2 way zipper, fold up footies, organic, but the neckline is so oddly large looks like it's a stretched out scoop neckline!"
3.0,The material is filmsy... should have made attention to the material!!
3.0,"Runs small, otherwise it’s a nice outfit."
3.0,I sized up 1/2 size and they smashed my toes still. The toe box just wasn’t right and they slip some when I walk because you can’t adjust the laces. I really wanted these to work because they are so cute!! But they weren’t right for me so I returned them
3.0,"The design of these leggings are breathtaking. The blue tropical print in a diagonal swath, followed by black mesh, is really stylish. Since getting them, I've actually worn them more as a fashion statement than as exercise clothing! To review them properly, I did make sure to exercise in them, and they're both comfortable and stretch to fit all my fitness needs. However, there is one warning I will give in this review: these leggings aren't going to last. When I bend my knee, the blue print stretches, and I can see the white fabric underneath. With enough bending, stretching, and washing, it's only a matter of time before these leggings look faded and stretched out. Also, I had a rough cuticle and nearly snagged the black part of the pants. If you're in the habit of buying new athletic clothing often, you might not mind, but I'll be disappointed when the vivid blue color fades and looks worn.If you do want to get yourself a pair, these leggings are true to size. I am a true size S in pants, and they fit me perfectly. My measurements are 36-inch hips tapering to 9-inch ankles, and I'm five-feet, two-inches tall."
3.0,"This is not a paid review. Before I purchased this bag I read most of the reviews.  The big question that seemed to be whether or not it was actually leather.  It turns out it's both leather and pleather.  The exterior is pleather but it is fused to a leather backing which allows it to be advertised as leather.  I also agree with several other reviewers that there is an annoying smell but it seems to be getting less over the past three days.  That said, even though it is not solid leather, the detailing and workmanship is very nice - better than some all leather bags I've purchased in the past. I purchased the larger bag because I plan on using it more as a briefcase to carry my computer and handout materials when I teach.  I've only had the bag a few days so don't yet know how it will hold up to steady use.  Because of the fused material and the fact that it is not entirely leather, I'm not expecting it to age like an all leather bag would. At this point I think it's a nice bag and would recommend it if you're ok with it not being entirely leather."
3.0,"I got these in the blue and black color, both the same size and both from the same place but there was such an inconsistency in the product it’s insane. The blue one fit me perfect, but the black one was so small it didn’t even go past my butt. Being thick thighed with a big butt, it just wasn’t gonna happen. It really sucks. If you don’t have big thighs and butt then these may be perfect for you, but my thick girls are gonna find some inconsistencies."
3.0,Están bien grandes las mascarillas. NO QUEDAN PARA UN CARA PEQUEÑA Y NO ME REFIERO A LA DE UN NIÑO.
3.0,"Dont look real at all. A student opened it up, and said it was fake..."
3.0,Too small for an adult with average head. Hair falls out easy. But beautiful colors.
3.0,ordered large - fit more like small/medium.. used as a present
3.0,My great granddaughter is a perfect size 2T and this set was a bit small on her.  I suggest ordering a size larger for a long wear time.
3.0,Clasp was broken when received
3.0,its is pretty but is to gold looking and does not look real.
3.0,"I purchased these in a medium and one was not a medium. Two were fine but one was super big, Large or X-Large although the tag says medium."
3.0,Just glittery on top layer.  Does not last wearing it.
3.0,ok quality but it is very fashionable
3.0,A little bit heavy.
3.0,Much smaller than expected.  Beautiful though.
3.0,Light weight but could be a bit thicker fabric. Hoping not to tear. Will have to use for light items
3.0,"Good quality for the price, mine did have pockets. I bought a size small and it fits me big. I’m 5’1, 110 lbs and a B cup. I wish smaller sizes were available because it is a cute dress. I will be keeping it because I figured I could add a belt but I wish I could just simply wear it without one."
3.0,"I thought an Angel mask would be cool to have, but it's not a great mask outside of aesthetics...and even then I have some issues with it.<br /><br />It's nice that it has a bendable nose piece, but the way the fabric is cut it's not form fitting to the face, so the fabric bunches and crinkles which messes up how the mask looks. I tend to lose the spots above the fangs due to bunching. I do not have a small head/face and this mask is still large on me.<br /><br />The thin ""filter"" inserts are a joke. Leaving them in, you end up with a weird looking, stiff, flat panel over your mouth. Leave them out and you still have that unnecessary extra panel of fabric bunching up under the mask.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what this fabric is, but even though it is much thinner than my cotton masks, this silky mask is harder to breathe through and fogs my glasses more.<br /><br />The ear pieces are adjustable, but the elastic is so thin I worry about breaking it if I mess with it too much. Over all, not a mask I end up wearing too often if I want to take my health seriously."
3.0,Obviously I'm a larger lady. This was super super tight. Now I understand it's spandex but holy crap the 3x fit like a 1x. Not only was there a permanent wedgie but the fabric was so thin anything underneath was easily visible. My son was so excited for mommy to be spider gwen with him but I just couldn't wear it knowing it'd rip at any second. Luckily I was able to get a gwen hoodie and spiderweb skirt and make due. I was so disappointed.
3.0,Product is a bit big for an average American head . Felt like it was stretched out . Great price and product for a edgy event or costume.
3.0,They are ok colorful wise but some don’t match what is pictured. The purple is too light for february and june. I thought july would be more red than pink. They are still nice as is.
3.0,"I used it as a cover up, it's see through and the cut is so high I can't use it as a dress unless I have shorts on. The fabric isnt great quality but I did enjoy the look. I could imagine this would look cute with some shorts. Also, if you have big breasts, these will truly expose your cleavage. you might want to get a safety pin to cover up the boobage a bit. Well mine sag a bit so Its just personal preference on how you handle the booby part."
3.0,The regular (unadjustable) Olukai flips are much more comfortable on the top of the feet- you decide which option is best for you.
3.0,I use it everyday and travel with it although I need a larger one now. The ziper pulls come off easily though
3.0,I don't like how it releases. Awkward. I stopped using them. I gave the second pair to my co-worker. He likes them.
3.0,"This definitely looks better in the photos. It was a ton of fabric, it almost felt like a monk costume. Returned it."
3.0,"I got this in a medium when it was priced low. The medium was too big for me though and I returned it (one of my photos shows a yardstick measuring 20&quot; across the front to give you an idea of size). Moreover, the material is very thin; I could hold up the shirt and clearly see my hand through two layers of fabric. The lime color is cute as is the front zipper. Lastly, shortcuts were taken in construction which you can see on the hem in my other photo."
3.0,"Sits well, needs a little extra squeeze but nothing above average."
3.0,I liked everything about it but it didn't fit. Runs small.
3.0,No as it is in the advertisement
3.0,Arms are a little small and the rest of the tunic is a little loose.
3.0,I dont like the fact the faux fur is not detachable from hood. Concerned about how jacket would look after it is washed. Material seems cheap.
3.0,It a great top its just a little to booby for me maybe more coverage
3.0,very soft and comfy but wayyy too short. I typically wear a medium but got a large anyway.. I got this shirt for work but now just use it for sleeping in because i can't even lift my arms over my head without it going past my belly button. The image displays it as pretty long but it just meets the hem of my pants.
3.0,"The bag is nice enough but the shoulder strap was tacky and did not fit and was already coming apart when received. I bought many similar ones for my friends with rave reviews, but I was embarrassed when I gave this as a Christmas gift and had to take it back for return."
3.0,"This romper is adorable! However, it was too short for my daughter. The crotch gives her a very unpleasant wedgie (in the back AND front) and she's actually pretty average height for her age. Disappointed!"
3.0,"The bathing suit is super cute, however, it is out of proportion, top is giant, and bottom is small. I ordered large, bottom fits well, but top is so big. I am going to keep it as it is cute, and hopefully top won't fall off in the water."
3.0,I personally did not like this dress. It was way to long for me. The material felt really heavy and thick for a summer like dress. If it had sleeves it would be a great winter dress. I thought it would be softer but it was a little it itchy for my sensitive skin.
3.0,Beautifull watch that I get this time.<br />I use every day isn't the best but look good.<br />This still is good although of time that I bought.
3.0,"This coat was well constructed but way too small. I am 5’ft. 7” and weigh 165 pounds. I read the other reviews about it being too small so I ordered up and believe me, I should have ordered up 3 sizes. An extra large was way too small, even in the sleeves.<br />The seller did make return easy and painless."
3.0,Most hats are too small for my head. This one is too big. Pushes my ears out like satellite dishes. Nice hat otherwise but it should be fitted. Adjusting the strap doesn't matter as its the depth of the hat that can not be adjusted.
3.0,super cute bathing suit.  i'm 5'5 and 130 lbs.  bottom fits great but the top was way too large in the small I ordered.  if you're small chested the padding isn't in the right places to enhance your breasts.  definitely more flattering for full B cups or larger only.  since i ordered with prime it arrived quickly and on time.
3.0,actually has image of a leopard occasionally on the belt - didn't expect that.  I can work with it - but would have been better without it.
3.0,Purse is okay cheap lining on the inside of purse.
3.0,Not one size fits all. I have size 10 feet and only wore these a few times before they busted 100s of beads everywhere. But they were cute and comfortable to wear.
3.0,They are smaller than shown.
3.0,Cute shoes and run true to size. Seams cut into my feet. I have narrow heels so I put in heel pads so they wouldn't slip. They help but aren't that comfortable. There isn't much for arch support.
3.0,Just not a flattering look and they pop off easily. The metal part in the middle is just a big no.
3.0,"Perfect for a one-time wear, but after it was washed, it shrunk even more and got holes in the seams. Looks a lot bigger in the picture than in real life."
3.0,It’s an okay bra
3.0,It is very light almost impossible to conceal your underwear and not for the very hippy. But the style is lovely.
3.0,"inexpensive, but looks good"
3.0,I loved the first pair so much I ordered a second pair in a different color.  Same style but it is a thinner material and I do not like them anywhere near as much.  Very weird to me....
3.0,It is not as well made as I expected and the material is thinner than I anticipated.
3.0,"Ordered size 12, we're way too small"
3.0,The shoes are nice and my little boy loves them. Only down fall is that plastic on the shoe looks like it has been melted and glue spots showing on inside of shoe.
3.0,"Was what was advertised, just arrived late for our Halloween Contest"
3.0,"It’s a really cute band and seems to be made of good quality materials, but it took forever for me to get it to fit on my versa. It should only take a few seconds to pop a band on and off, but this one took me 20 minutes. It seems like the side with the holes for the clasp is too big. The leather was in the way of the pin and wouldn’t let it snap in. After a bunch of maneuvering, it finally went in."
3.0,"Love this ring, I wear it everyday! Unfortunately the ""pearl"" finish has started coming off the fake pearl. Super disappointed."
3.0,It fit fine till I washed it. I now have to pass it on to my granddaughter.
3.0,Thin fabric and bright colors!!!<br />Not a great quality.
3.0,"I love this dress, I love the pockets and color, everything except it fits tight and shows all my belly rolls, I wanted flowy and breezy for these southern summers, it also drags the ground and I'm 5'4&#34;. I would not buy this dress again"
3.0,turn black right away
3.0,"Loved the print, it fits nice. Hated that it had no slip underneath"
3.0,"Was originally looking for non elasticity waist, this was not it. The elastic is super tight."
3.0,Runs small. Buy 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,Nice color but huge size .
3.0,"I bought these to use between the house and the hot tub walk. Needed something to quickly slide in and out of. I have a small normal/skinny width foot and they barely fit. Based on the measurement chart on Amazon I determined to by size 6 and my toes and heels come to the front and back of shoe, with very little to spare. If you have a wide foot this sandal will not fit!! They are rubber, so they rub across the top of the foot if warn for too long. They work for my purpose, but wouldn't wear them all the time."
3.0,This is a interesting top. The blouse was big at the bottom. I had to get my serger out and take in 1 inch on each side<br />to hold the shape. It it was made out of rayon instead of linen I probably wouldn't have taken it in. The linen fabric<br />is some what stiff.
3.0,"It's a truly nice product but if you're planning  to swim or do water aerobics, do not get a swim suit with a skirt!"
3.0,"Like the style, not crazy about the material. Wear a 9/10, ordered a large. Fit perfect,just wish the material was different."
3.0,The color (purple) is not like pictured but more of a pastel purple. The fit neck line looks more like a turtleneck like color but it not and lays flat on my collar area. The sweater is soft but if you want to over sized look then you have to order a size or two larger than you'd typically wear. I may wind up sending it back because of the price and it does not not like I expected (per the picture).
3.0,It was too small and not as poofy as i thought.
3.0,It’s very cute just thinner than expected
3.0,"Too small in the shoulders, but still cute and wearable, as long as I don't have to do any crazy moving or reaching."
3.0,"These were odd. The pair with the black beads are a little larger. For some reason that made them harder to close. If you bend the wire to thread it into the closure, it doesn't match up to meet the other end. I lost one within 2 days of getting them. The silver beaded pair are smaller and for some reason easier to fasten. I'm currently wearing them and have had no issues with them. Not even when I sleep with them on."
3.0,"I liked the variety and the price of these mustaches. I also liked that they came with the different types grouped together and not all jumbled in the package. However, the paper backing was difficult to peel off and I ruined some while trying to get this off. They also had a strong chemical smell straight out of the packaging."
3.0,Dress fit perfectly and the lengths was also perfect. The strap broke when I washed it
3.0,"This shirt looks as it is in the picture, my husband truly enjoys it. He likes the style and the cut, the folded cough with at it design makes the shirt even more special. He enjoys wearing the shirt and thinks that it looks fantastic. I would have given this garment more stars, however the material itself is very corse. It is not a soft cotton but it is a bit itchy. Other than that, the shirt is nice."
3.0,Very cheap headband but I gave it 3 stars because it does look good once you put it on.
3.0,"I got this during Prime Day so I can't remember if I actually read the reviews because afterwards I saw similar complaints. This is not what I was expecting. It's not a smooth chiffon finish. It's a rough polyester material that  people wore back in the 70's. It reminded me of some of my grandma's clothes. It's not a wine color, it's a bright red. However, because of my chest size, I need an XL and it does  does fit nicely, so I am going to keep it. I did wear a neutral colored cami underneath as it is see through. I do like how it fits and looks on me it's just the material and color that is off."
3.0,The shirt felt see through and very flimsy. I would not purchase or recommend.
3.0,"Loved the color, quality, and they make your butt look amazing but omg… they are mid to low waist and way too small in the torso area I guess because they give camel toe regardless of sizing or any way you adjust them! Honestly I’ve seen reviews where ppl say they have camel toe and I figured it must be an issue with their um.. anatomy.. but this is not the case here! I’ve never had this issue with any leggings and these are so bad I can’t wear them! It’s a bummer because they are really nice material and like I said, make your butt look great 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,To small. Get on size larger
3.0,Super cute Betty Boop design but unfortunately outer case is made of fabric. Snags & tears easily in your purse with keys & whatever odds & ends your carrying coming in contact w/ it.
3.0,"Pretty good, but cheaply made. Not unexpected for the price."
3.0,"This purse is a lot of fun for anyone who wants the unique privilege of wearing a chicken on a strap. I got this for my daughter, who is having a lot of fun with the novelty of having a chicken purse. The fun and novelty are the chief reasons to purchase this bag, as the materials used to make it are quite cheap. The purse is a small zippered pouch sewn inside the chicken, so there is not a lot of room inside to store more than essentials. Still, it's a chicken purse, so there's that."
3.0,"The shirt is very cute, but the fabric is way too thin and transparent! I bought it to wear on the 4th of July, but I doubt I will ever wear it again."
3.0,This is a lot of dress and it runs large
3.0,"This is a BEAUTIFUL  bangle, fit is perfect!  But, it fell apart in 6 months!  One of the hinge pins fell out...just glad it fell out at home...could have lost my Fitbit!!!"
3.0,You must to choose correct size
3.0,"Good scarves for spring and fall.  They are very light, The colors in the picture are somewhat inaccurate, however.  Unfortunately, I was most looking forward to the turquoise, and it came as light blue."
3.0,"Liked the color and material, The size (3xlt 50-52) was way to big.  I'm 6'6' and to 270 the shirt is about 4ft long."
3.0,"My 8 year old daughter is a huge Tsum Tsum fan. Unfortunately, the beanie doesn't fit her well, she says it's too tight. Very cute though.."
3.0,Gloves work fine after gluing the tips on with silicone based glue.
3.0,"The straps didnt seem very secure, as if they could bust at any moment. The slit is also pretty discreet if that's what you're looking for. Bust fit pretty big as well"
3.0,Love that this is furry lined so it's warmer but the gray doesn't seem very gray to me more like a gray blue.
3.0,Fits small and the material is awkward for me.
3.0,These are so cute so I wanted to love them but they have their issues- they weren't really secure to the foot so my little one (whos just learning to walk) was tripping over them. They ran large so I ordered a smaller size and it still was too big. If you are just buying them for looks they are adorable but if your baby is learning to walk these probably aren't the best.
3.0,"Looks good on a picture but not in person, very cheap, don't like it, its going back."
3.0,I am ok with this but I am not inspired to use it.  It gets lost among all my other things.  I am planning to just use this for a figurine on the shelf.
3.0,"Overall, the product looks fine and does make for a fun outfit around Halloween. However, the button on the pants was missing upon arrival and they don't have belt loops. Makes it challenging for a suit without loops."
3.0,"Bought a pair for my 4 yo son. They look cute, but unfortunately all 4 upper holes for laces are crooked and don't match on the outside and inside, so you can't pull laces through. Returning them."
3.0,The arms are a bit tight but otherwise pretty cute ;)
3.0,Showed up looking a lot smaller and much less sturdy than I originally would've thought. However that's kinda what you walk into with cheaper jewelry. Ultimate it did what I needed it to do but no real complaint. You kno what you're buying when you get stuff like this
3.0,Super cute dress but does NOT run TTS. This was very small and I couldn’t wear it. I’m very disappointed.
3.0,"I would size up ...I bought a medium and they are way too small. It also took awhile to get the product, though I already knew that when I ordered it. They did wash well though, in case I can lay off the cupcakes and lose some weight and they'll actually fit me."
3.0,"Cute purse, nice color.  Cheaply made.  Shoulder strap broke first time I used it.  Purse is extremely small.  You can only put a flat wallet, maybe your phone and definitely no makeup bag.  Not only did the shoulder strap break, the plastic holders for the hand straps loosens, causing the straps to fall off.  I waited too late to return the purse.  AMAZON, you've got do better than this with products being sold.  This is ridiculous."
3.0,Look and feel cheap and does not wear well
3.0,The top is too skimpy.  My daughter is a somewhat conservative young teen and liked the fabric.  She won't wear the top.  It is too low cut.  I thought it might have pretty good coverage with the huge fake implants that are covered but it doesn't.  Definitely only for hoochie mommas.
3.0,Love the look ...but Lense popped out after couple of weeks and will not stay in.
3.0,"Nice bag.  However, the chain broke the first time I used it."
3.0,Fit me too big.
3.0,I feel in love with the look of this goody when I saw it so I had to get it. There wasn't really many reviews but I got it anyway. It's really soft and comfortable but it is thin. I still like it though and plan to wear it. Wont work once it gets really cold though
3.0,"If you wear a 38, buying a 42 won't make it. This is totally wrong. It runs very small. Excellent quality."
3.0,"Fitted me well, but I was a bit disappointed by its near-fading colors and its not-so-rich textile"
3.0,the socks are cute on the outside but there are so many strings on the inside from the embroidery that they wrap around your toes and hurt
3.0,"These glasses are cute, and I will wear them. I wish I'd realized that the ""rhinestones"" aren't actually stones... They are painted indentions in the frames. I blame myself for that! They seem sturdy enough for the price."
3.0,Ordered a medium for my average sized nine year old and it was quite big. Had to pin it for her program. The fabric wasn't quite as nice as I hoped but it wasn't terrible either.
3.0,"I have a few different pairs of bike shorts that I own and have worn over the years ranging from pretty pricey to pretty cheap.  These shorts are definitely in the cheaper side of things and I will compare these to other similarly priced bike shorts that I have worn.<br /><br />The overall material on these is not too bad.  Pretty stretchy and comfortable for the most part.  They are also not too thin either.  Some other shorts in the price range I have used were a bit to thin and revealing for my comfort.  These were adequate in that regard.<br /><br />Padding - I have seen many reviews stating that the padding is too much.  For this price range the padding is generally not going to be as nice as the fancier shorts that use more of a gelly type padding.  This is your pretty typical cheap padding that is going to be a bit thicker than your more expensive padding to get the same effect.  The thickness of the padding will not cause any performance issues while riding and you wont notice the thickness at all; however, when just walking around in these shorts they might feel a little more awkward then some others.<br /><br />Sizing - The sizing for me was just not right.  I got a large (which is about what I normally wear) and I am 5'10"" 195lbs with a 34 waist boarding on a 35 waist.  These were too big and baggy for my liking.  Not so bad that I can't wear them but definitely not my ideal fit and would opt for a medium if I could do it over again.  These shorts also have to much material for my liking as I can pull the waist all the way up past my belly button and a quarter of the way up my back.  I personally do not want my shorts to go that high but I feel like I have to pull them up that high to get the padding tight on my body to ride.<br /><br />Overall, for a cheap pair of shorts they are not awful.  I personally would spend a few more $ to get something that is better fitting and has better quality padding."
3.0,"Very see throughout, but cute"
3.0,When I put it on it almost covered my eyes. It was too big for my face. The picture was beautiful though and material good.
3.0,Nice tee shirt for under shirts or sweaters but thin on it’s own.
3.0,"really really tight on my average sized legs, not really sure what i could wear them with. kinda street makes you look like a street walker"
3.0,"The gray sweatshirt is more of a brown. Definitely not as shown Yet, still cute and comfy."
3.0,"So these are super cute and I do get compliments wearing them however the lenses are weird like they are dark but like a shadow dark, like a painted dark then a tint dark"
3.0,The shorts fit nice but I wish they were a tad longer. If your thighs rub together a lot then these shorts are not for you!
3.0,Design wasn't as bright as the pic otherwise pretty much what I expected.
3.0,"This Brand has nice quality suits. I purchased a large in suits from this brand before and I was so happy with the fit and quality I wanted to buy more. However, this cut runs BIG. This large is for size 14 or something. I’m 5’5 and 150 lbs and this is way too big on me. I look like I’m playing dress up😒😒😒. I will reorder in a size small hopefully it will fit. If you are a small person this isn’t cut for you. Ok so I returned the large and ordered the small. I love the way the jacket fits but the pants are a little snug in the waist. I will keep it but I won’t order the other colors in this cut"
3.0,Super cute! Bottoms run small
3.0,I will wait and see on how it turns out.
3.0,"I bought M since you’re never really too sure if the material will be too stretchy or not, or if the M listed actually is the China size M which is sometimes like an XXS. Turned out that this was one of those times when the M was more like an Old Navy M where the size was double what an M normally would be. I also decided to get M because my bra size is 38D and I am quite chesty, but again, way too big. The material is really nice and the refund process was very easy, so I went ahead and ordered the pink and another blue in a S. Will review those when I get them!"
3.0,Nice necklace but  not as seen on photo.  Its different colored metals not gemstones as seen in photo.
3.0,"nice bracelet but very small. more like for a young girl. also, the crosses look black in the picture but they are not. very hard to put on because the clasp is so small."
3.0,"They're ok. They fit as expected. However, I like my socks to have more stretch so they cling to my feet."
3.0,"Didnt like these they aremy correct size but they keep rolling down. Luckily I bought these and another kind from fruit of the loom and the others are great so I dont have to wear these. Its like underwear are never consistent, I bought the same cut, same brand, same size, the seamless ones fit perfect and these just sucked. They will not stay up and just keep rolling down under my Jean's. Annoying would not buy again."
3.0,These are not polarized like I thought they would be.
3.0,It is as in picture. So it poufs our around the headband just like this. It does not lay flat.
3.0,These are nice but I thought they would be bigger really they don't seem 10 mm maybe 8-9 but they are pretty and quality I just wouldn't have paid so much if I knew they weren't going to be the size I was looking for.
3.0,"I wanted to love this tank!  It was everything I was looking for, pink, fun strappy back, open back.  The only problem was that the shoulder straps are not adjustable and the bottom of the built in bra only goes down to the middle of your breasts.  2 downward dogs and you would be falling out of the bottom.  Believe me I pulled and tugged hoping it would stretch, but no luck.  Otherwise the fit was perfect in every other way.  I ordered the Small and I usually wear a size 4 top.  I suppose if you have a very short distance between your shoulders and the bottom of your breasts than this is the tank for you."
3.0,"I wanted to love it.  Arms were far too tight, and waist was too loose. Chest was good though. And the color also wasn't that great on me. Is more of a champagne than a gold.  But the fabric was nice,  and it seemed well made. Debating buying the red one to see if I have better luck."
3.0,5'1 and 108 lbs and it's pretty tight
3.0,"Cute style, decent quality. Love the color"
3.0,This bathing suit is ok. I don't think I would purchase again.
3.0,Was too big for a child and fit me an adult.  cute... and warm but not breathable
3.0,"Forget the touchscreen function. The leather’s too big, or the inner liner layer is too small. The glove’s fingers will be well past the end of your own digits.<br /><br />They keep you warm, as advertised.<br /><br />So warm, that in warmer weather, you’ll be sweating inside of them."
3.0,"Before ordering, I read reviews and saw it was made of acrylic. I wanted cotton but realized that I have other acrylic sweaters that are nice. However, this acrylic sweater is really thin, made of cheap material and already showing signs of stretching. Style is nice and color is nice so I’m debating keeping it but I like thick quality sweaters that last a long time and I don’t think this will last long"
3.0,"Wand was a lot of fun for my 4-year old daughter for Halloween. It has held up with her playing with it. It does have small parts that could break off easily if it were handled more roughly. I would not recommend it for someone younger, but for her it was a perfect addition to her ""princess"" costume."
3.0,"Perfect size and great color, but it does not seem to be real jade."
3.0,"There were only 37 pieces and six of them didn't work(luckily only needed 30).  They arrived packed in a small yellow envelope, loose in it and two of them were stuck in the &#34;on&#34; position so they were glowing through the envelope."
3.0,I really like these socks. I bought for my 3 year old. She is a bit short so right now they are more like thigh highs then knee highs but she will grow into them.
3.0,"Cute tank top however, got a small and it's still too big."
3.0,Very cute top but fell apart by the second wear. You get what you pay for it guess!
3.0,"Overall nice sweatsuit, but the only issue I had was that the actual color of the sweatsuit was grey and  COBOLT blue versus the grey and NAVY Blue that's shown in the image on the website."
3.0,Very short. Probably best on men under 5’10”. Nice fabric.
3.0,"I was hoping my socks would be more like the picture, but just as everyone else has said :( they look nothing alike. See picture below!"
3.0,Beautiful blouse and very cute design.  However - I had to return due to wierd sizing.  I normally wear an 18 - so I ordered the XXXL - the problem is that the shoulders and arms are not sized proportional to size of blouse.  So disappointing because it truly is beautiful.
3.0,"Cute costume bag, but not for everyday. Very cheap."
3.0,"The bottom fit as expected , the top was way too small. Love the pattern but just not able to get the top to work."
3.0,It runs a bit small in the top area but material is super cute.
3.0,I wear a 9 1/2 - 10 in most shoes.  These 9-10's are constantly falling off my feet (could also be how lose around the ankle).  I do ike the color and the padding on the bottom.  I'd just get a smaller size next time.
3.0,"they were beautiful. but so small. so if you're using these for young children, go for it. but if you're older, half of them won't even fit."
3.0,"it is nice, and fitable"
3.0,clasp came off of it first time wearing it.
3.0,The pants are comfortable I ordered short and they are to long darn
3.0,A little loose for compresaion socks
3.0,I like them but the quality is a bit poor...Seam is ripped in a couple places
3.0,Thought it would have been smaller. It's much too big for my three month old.
3.0,Every person looks for different things in their purses. This did not meet my requirements but that does not mean it might not work for you.
3.0,Liked the dress but a little too short for my liking..
3.0,My girls have rooms to grow in this dress...
3.0,"This is a very high quality Seiko automatic, and has the blue dial color that is very unique among the Seiko &#34;monster&#34; line.  There is, simply put, nothing wrong with this watch.  It tells good time, is well constructed, and very well finished considering the price.<br /><br />But personally, I have difficulty warming up to the Seiko &#34;monster&#34; style case.  It's a love-it-or-hate it design.  I respect the watch, but personally, hate the design.  Your mileage may differ."
3.0,"Very thin, the plain images like the paint drip and galaxy were fine but the skull images were freakin YUGE!! (Seriously huge) it's sooo odd looking and doesn't match up with your face at all..."
3.0,The padding is kind of weird but I like it for a sexy top with jeans.
3.0,Cute… but a lot smaller than I thought they would be.
3.0,Nice bracelet. A little uncomfortable and bit too small.
3.0,"I purchased this wallet because it is supposed to be RFID blocking.  So to test this, I placed my proximity employee badge inside the wallet and swiped it at the reader at my work.  All the doors opened without a problem.  I even moved the badge around different pockets within the wallet to see what would happen.  All the doors still opened.<br /><br />On the other hand, the wallet is made exceptionally well.<br /><br />Hope this review helps.<br />."
3.0,"Cute dress, but material is very thin."
3.0,"This item is not match description, is not cotton material, is polyester. Is not comfortable. This seller provides wrong information misleading customers to purchase. I don’t want it. refund has been issued June 16, 2022 never back to my credit card. Is too bad."
3.0,"I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! I'm 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart I'm large but is way-way too big on me, I'm returning this item."
3.0,The diamond Kind of big
3.0,"Expected for teenagers to wear on their head .. much too small, maybe for a Barbie doll  or on a headband for a 3 year old .. very cute & well made .."
3.0,I thought it was going to be smaller but I guess that's my fault for not reading. I feel like flavor flav with it on
3.0,"The image is adorable but after only 1 washing, it is coming off. Fits a little too snug as well."
3.0,I ordered the leggings in a small based on the reviews that they were true to size or even baggy. For reference I am 5'6 and 118 pounds and found them way too small. The were short in both the ankles and too low on the waist.
3.0,"very hard to see the writing on the hair ties, not really happy with them"
3.0,The bottoms fit my gf well. The top on the other hand could be better. She is a member of the IBTC and she does not fill the cups out so every now and then she shows to much out of the sides. Would not recommend the top for the ladies that are part of the IBTC.
3.0,The earrings are way larger than you might expect.
3.0,it gets worn out after a while
3.0,I love the fabric of the underwater but they run really really small. I typically wear a small and I would probably need an XL from this company.
3.0,"It only came with one keychain. For the price i assumed it was both shown. Its ok, not as cool as a red glitter one i had in the early 90s. These are getting rarer and hard to find. Being an 80s baby i love glitter and the pink keychain i recieved had pink tiny balls the size of cake decorating beads-balls, actually not any glitter at all. Ill keep searching for a real glitter with water keychain."
3.0,Just bought 2 of these the other day and i received them just now. The color of the gem isnt the same as the color posted in the pic. Its like a light baby blue color.  Misleading. It doesnt sit in your belly button like the normal ones the peircers give you. Guess ill have to get used to it.
3.0,Very comfortable but the degree of polarization isn't as &#34;strong&#34; as other polarized lenses of other brands I own.
3.0,The frames were bigger than I thought they would be.  My glasses are medium and the glasses stated they were mediums but they are large.
3.0,"I love these!  Sadly, the stitching on one started to fray after 7 weeks."
3.0,"This bracelet is more impressive in the product profile pictures than it is in real life. The quality of the materials make this bracelet look like a toy. The chain feels like plastic, the beads are cheap-looking, and the rock is plain and fits the holder oddly. The clasp was difficult to figure out; one of the pieces had to be bent open."
3.0,Otherwise the suit was nice.
3.0,"Being 5’1 and larger on the bottom I often struggle to find pants that fit well. Unfortunately, these were no exception. They fit great through the leg but bunch a little at the ankles. If only my legs were 3 inches longer! When I stand, the top of the pants fit great, but when I sit the top rolls like an old pair of pantyhose. I ordered the Large and the tag inside says 10. My advice is to order up a size. Overall, these are nice pants even though they don’t fit me the best."
3.0,The XL is not a typical XL. It runs a bit small but I can wear it.
3.0,"I wear it occasionally, the arms fit tighter than I like.  Since it's a one size fits all, it looks kind of like a maternity shirt on me and makes me look a little heavier than normal."
3.0,"It's ok but I wish they were at least one inch longer or other than that, they could have different options on the length. It does stay in place when I am playing tennis but,<br />It's a little too short for I to wear it with normal size short sleeve t shirt."
3.0,so pretty but had to order 2 sizes up. sizing does not match their chart
3.0,"Love how they look, the quality feels nice but when wearing its a different story. You cannot look at your device screen when wearing, all 3 pairs give device screens a rainbow affect and looks like your looking through a kaleidoscope. I had my husband put them on and he said the same thing."
3.0,The headbands are definitely soft but may have been a bad choice for running indoors. The band is so wide it covers my ears and that made me really warm during my workout. Would love this in a medium width rather than wide.
3.0,Not great quality and runs big
3.0,The tassles fall off really easy. Other than that it's such a cute romper.
3.0,"Size is good. Can’t sit or lay down, if so the dress has wrinkles."
3.0,Fabric a bit thin
3.0,"I like the materials, style and fit.  Large size goes over my amble nose and over my chin and does leaves plenty of room for mouth movement.  Bridge clip works well.  Very comfortable especially for long periods of having to wear.  Much too thick for workout outs.  Breath does not enter and exit mask easily and quickly became saturated with moisture and sweat.  The Mission masks are much better for workouts, but not as comfortable."
3.0,"This scarf does not behave like natural fibers. It was giving me electric static weeks after the arrival. I really wonder if this is hemp+silk, it feels more like synthetic thing. The color is nice, muted yellow. It is very large."
3.0,"the material isn't as expected, kind of shiny.  Other than that, it's ok."
3.0,The shorts fit as expected and true to size. I would have liked a better (looser) fit around the hips. OK for hiking but not for climbing as the shorts simply do not have enough give for long leg stretches.
3.0,"This is a mixed review. Stats: 30FF (Freya) to 32F (most other brands) with narrow shoulders. I really wanted to like this bra. The straps are thick as to not dig in but not so thick as to feel cumbersome. I think they would stay in place on me.The band could fit a little more snug as I fear after a while it will stretch out. Right out of the package, I had it on the tightest hook. The cup wasn't really a cup. It gave the uni-boob. It smushed them down so that I was &#34;stable&#34; but threatening to spill out the top. This was not as bad as some bras. The lack of molding or underwire caused the breasts to be smashed together so that I felt that if I worked up a sweat I would have so much sweat in my cleavage and possibly chafing. I thought about just trying it out and shoving a paper towel in my cleavage to absorb the sweat but who wants to do that? If you are a small band larger cup, this is a good sports bra for yoga (not hot yoga) or any exercise where you will not be sweating a lot. I even though I could run in it but for the sweat factor. If I was not a sweaty workout person, I would have kept it. Closer than most but still a bust (ha ha)"
3.0,"The Sunglasses look very slick and well suited for strong sun. They were a gift for my husband, however, he wears prescription glasses and the sunglasses do not fit over his prescription glasses well even wearing them with just the straps. They pinch his face too much and make it uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,Only complain is that it fit me big but the quality is great
3.0,Great cut and style. Runs small. Fabric feels like cheap tablecloth. Returned.
3.0,Nice simple dress. Not enough structure for my needs.
3.0,"This is a standard black polyester dress.  I don't really know what would make this stand above the millions of other standard black inexpensive polyester dresses on Amazon (of which I have many).  The only plus for me of this dress is it's American sizing, not Chinese, so if you are a large, order a large and it should fit, you shouldn't have to order up by 4 sizes.  But to me, despite trying to pair it with pricey jewelry, a designer scarf, or even a super nice sweater, it still looked cheap and thin.  It's also that type of material that your BO and deodorant clings to no matter how many times you wash it.  So if you are in a pinch, don't have a lot of cash on hand and need a fast LBD, this will do it!"
3.0,"Love it, but is a little snug for my size"
3.0,"I love this shirt.  Its so cute on, but I had to iron it and starch it.  It come wrinkled and balled up in a plastic bag.  It wrinkles terribly when you wear it. And it was faded in spots. The fabric is ....I dont know what it is!"
3.0,"Cute, but the front of the dress is way too short. I have to pair it with pants."
3.0,"I do like the look and feel of the robes. They are very pretty and feel nice and love that they have pockets. However, they do run on the smaller side and kind of wish I wouldve ordered a size up for all of them, seeing as I bought 6 all at once for a bridal party. There seems to be loose threads hanging off the robe all around the inside of it and some on the outside as well. I hope these hold up and give enough coverage during the getting ready process on the day of the wedding. They are not terrible, but not that great either."
3.0,"I like the design, it breathes well. The elastic band is itchy, so 3-stars (cause comfort is worth 2-stars). It's now my ""painting-yardwork"" hat."
3.0,It's a good shirt feel like it looks a little different from the picture.
3.0,The swim suit is cute but it runs short. U have to have a very short torso
3.0,It's okay for the price!
3.0,"Smaller than I thought it would be, but they're warm."
3.0,"Everything fit pretty well, except the butt area. Size large. But not large enough for those big booty Judy's."
3.0,I bought this anklet as a birthday present for a friend.  It came in very good condition and looks great.  It is very delicate.  I just hope that the young lady (15) will also like it.  Her birthday theme will be butterflies.<br />I think it looks beautiful and very feminine.
3.0,"I ordered according to the directions and these would not even come close to fitting. Definitely not plus sized. Also they were not the color that I had selected. However, had they fit, I think that they would have been great as they were a nice material and cute."
3.0,Too short around the midriff for my taste.
3.0,"I didn't realize that the sides of this case were white. Didn't find it as visually appealing when it arrived. It also looked shinier in the picture than it seemed in person.<br />The two main problems I had with this case were:<br />A) I felt that it wasn't as rubbery around the corners and edges, as I'd hoped for, to give my phone more protection against falls<br />And<br />B) The volume button was nearly impossible to access. I prefer the protective cases where I can easily find and turn up/down the volume buttons. With this case, I had to search for it every time and really make sure that my finger (or even fingernail) was on the right one."
3.0,"Look cute and they are soft ,but super flimsy so the bow end flop down. I have more expensive brand and they don't do that. So if your budget is tight ,but you still want a stylish babe then these will be fine. However,  if you want something of higher quality these are not them."
3.0,The boots are beautiful however I'm a women with muscular calves and they wouldn't zip :(
3.0,"Due to spills, i thought I would try this bib similar to one I'd used for my children, years ago. There is absolutely nothing of consequence wrong with it. It is reversible. It comes, as described. What is omitted?<br />The adjustable snaps allow for only two adjustments, both too large for me. (I am slim and petite.) The neck is way too wide. I must place something between my neck and the top of the bib to prevent food spills down the inside of bib. The curved part at bottom, ostensibly to catch spills - on terry side or on wipable side, is too wide, and open at the corners. The bib I wish I had now is the one I used for my children years ago -- a very soft moldable one-piece plastic that caught every crumb and chunk. I've made every attempt to tell the reader in search of such a product just what to expect. I spill more, not because I am ill, but because I watch news on my laptop and sometimes need to lean to change programs."
3.0,Colors are not nearly as bright as the photo and the material is weird and shiny.
3.0,"Typical, average pin - good value for the price!"
3.0,"Image shown appears to be rough cotton and a combo camo pattern of faded pale white and black.  Item received was very smooth material and only had black camo so it actually looks a bit strange.  Im going to turn it inside out and rough stone it then probably sponge a precut camo pattern with bleach to add textured layers.  Outside of that, fit well.  Im a US Natural Born Female; Commonly Medium."
3.0,Not as soft material as I wanted.
3.0,Doesn’t suit our needs. My kids have thick wavy hair and this headband is way too thin and flimsy for their little heads. It just slides off and gets tugged easily. It is more of a distraction having to readjust the band.<br />But it’s well seen and cute.
3.0,"The dress seemed pretty nice overall, though it was made our of some unique heavy, yet stretchy, material. It looks cute in the picture, but when my wife tried it on, we noticed the off-shoulder strap is made of what seems to be some kind of elastic and we just couldn't get both straps on the same shoulder to sit right. It's hard to explain, but it was like one strap would bow out, slumping down in one spot and poking up in another and the off-shoulder strap just looked saggy or out-of-place. We may have just gotten a bad one, but sent it back and went be ordering another. We got medium, burgundy."
3.0,"Love the pattern and thickness of these. However they are really tight. I bought them for myself (female size 9 feet, not large calves) knowing that they’d be big. They are pretty tight on my calves tho, I know my husband would not be able to wear these."
3.0,overall im happy with the hoodie but it does have a thre small issues<br />my hoodie came with the draw strings for the hood untied and with out any plastic protectors on the ends so the ends were a little frayed easy fix i just put a knot at the end<br /><br />also the hood seemed a little &#34;short&#34;  whenever i put the hood up it pulls the back of the hoodie up so i guess the hoodie is made for people with really short necks?<br /><br />the hoodie is made out of a thin material compared to other hoodies<br /><br />like i said over all its a nice hoodie but it does have some issues
3.0,Way small. I've never worn anything larger than a 10 and can wear as small as 7.5 EEEE but I couldn't get my foot nto a 10 on these.
3.0,Good quality but expensive and sized very small (XL more like M).
3.0,It came very wrinkled and was a very weird material. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"Yes, it is lightweight.  And clingy.  And hot.  It's a shame it doesn't come in a cotton blend; this thin poly stuff looks cheap.  Too bad."
3.0,Runs small. I find they make me sweat but ok for the price. Fast shipppng
3.0,No me an llegado
3.0,The shirt and quality is nice but the shirt runs a size too large in my opinion!!
3.0,"Arms a little tight, fabric thin. Otherwise, a cute fashion statement!"
3.0,It’s beautiful and handy but I thought it would be a little bigger
3.0,I was super excited to get these but they don't look like potatoes and that's unfortunate. I could've painted them but it wasn't worth it personally.
3.0,The product was super cute and exactly what I was looking for except the fact they ran about a size too small which stinks because my niece was so excited to have them. Will probably be ordering her another pair though but definitely recommend sizing up.
3.0,Dress is huuuuge! Order 2 sizes down.
3.0,The material they use is very thin & looks like it won't hold up.  I will let you know by updating this review after I wear them
3.0,"Not as long as I would have liked, and I'm not very tall (5'4)"
3.0,"Not bad but I got the large and the bra was still tiny, doubt I can wear it because I'll be self conscious the whole time."
3.0,"Cheaply made and so long, if I had it hemmed I can make another dress out of the left overs.  Big in the bust but tight if you have a wide hips.  Sending it back"
3.0,"Overall this dress fit correctly to size but with the large slit in the front I felt every time I would take a step it was riding up to the point I kept having to shimmy it down every little bit, such a hassle. Maybe if your not as “hippy” you might not have that problem. Besides that it really was a nice looking dress though"
3.0,Shorts fit to size but that shirt way to small.
3.0,"This dress is nice, soft however the fit could be more refined. Its a bit big and it doesn't lay on the curves, if you have a butt, the back rises. Fabric is too loose. Not what I thought it would be at all."
3.0,"Purse had a chemical smell to it. Overall quality is good, but nothing to rave about"
3.0,Cute but rattles some when you get an alert.
3.0,"This wallet is really pretty, I have 13 different cards in it and that number makes it hard to snap, every now and then the coin purse part pops open due to the number of cards. It's suppose to be able to hold 16 cards with out a problem. I'm disappointed in that. I'm hoping once the leather gets broken in from use it will stretch and hold better. But at least the one I've received dark brown really pretty for sure but I wouldn't recommend more than 9 - 10 cards."
3.0,"The quality of this ring is acceptable. However, it is not a true comfort fit ring with a comfortable rolled interior edge. Should not be advertised as such."
3.0,These boxers do not perform well for active living. They constantly run up my legs and get full blown chewies I work out. As regular boxers they work ok.
3.0,The design looks nice but the clock stops randomly.
3.0,"The bottom seams ripped after a couple of months, I had to sew it back."
3.0,To big if your a 10 order a 9.5
3.0,"I ordered a few of these dresses and this was my least favorite. Fabric is a little stiffer than the others but still good quality. I ordered a small (usually a 4 or 6 in dresses) and the top was much too small. All the others I ordered in small fit well or slightly snug but doable.  Also, the skirt has a seam down the middle and I did not like how it made a thicker black line where the check pattern lined up"
3.0,One of the slices was dirty and I washed Other wise is nice shirt
3.0,It’s ok but not like the picture. The sleeves are tighter than the picture shows while the skirt is longer than the picture shows. I will still wear it but it’s not what I was expecting.
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34;, 114#. I got XS/2 because that is what the model is wearing and I usually wear that size. The sleeves are too short. Maybe it's my long monkey arms. The sleeves come midway between my elbow & wrist. The blouse itself fits well. It is see-thru, however, so I'll need to wear a tank top underneath. The length of the blouse looks similar to the model. Like I said, maybe I just have unusually long arms and that is why the sleeves don't fit the same."
3.0,I love these but the propeller broke off after only a week of wearing it.  The return was easy though and i would order again - just not one with a propeller.
3.0,The design on the top is super cute. I ordered a medium. The straps do not adjust. It comes with cups inside the top. The inside of the top has a thin thread line to keep the cups in place and does not seem sturdy. Mine even had a loose thread. The bottoms are much better quality but are small and tight fitting. They are also very &#34;cheeky&#34; bottoms. The double side straps are sturdy but do not adjust.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review.
3.0,"Love the shirt, but first wash and the tug on the zipper came off. AND the shirt is very wrinkled. I have another color of this shirt, and it came out great. Did I get a defect?"
3.0,Was a bit disappointed that the bracelets are different in size and the one is very tight and small.
3.0,Very thin and fragile.  Wasn't impressed.
3.0,Pretty but took a lot of effort to straighten out the folded creases.
3.0,"The dress fit nice and I like the color. However, I am only giving it a 3 star as the first day I wore it the seam ripped under the zipper. Easy fix and I'll wear it again."
3.0,Very nice quality but the size ran very large.
3.0,I like the color and quality but it’s much smaller than what I expected and I didn’t even receive a ring to attach it to anything. Disappointed 😔
3.0,"It's ok, but feels a little small."
3.0,Really cute piece of jewelry. I am not sure what it is made out of but I had a reaction to the metal when it started to tarnish. I broke out in a rash and had to throw it out. It is very cute. I'm not sure how long it will last. Mine lasted a few weeks before tarnishing.
3.0,"Good quality, doesn't pull too hard on your skin when you take it off. If you're bigger up top like me, I don't recommend. The D was still small. It will work for what I need it for, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
3.0,"The legs were way too long, I wish there were more descriptions."
3.0,"We live right next to the lake and have a pool a block away. We spend a ton of time swimming since the kids love it. I like having a nice variety of swim suits. This particular one appealed to me because I can wear it alone without a cover up. I didn't figure it would be one I'd want to swim it, but I could wear it out boating just in case I decide to swim or ski. Here are some brief thoughts:<br /><br />-Bottoms: This fit pretty well. I ordered this in a large since I'm a size 8. I feel like a have a big bum, so since I could either go medium or large at my size, I went bigger. The shorts are too tight or too lose. The waistband is a little odd. There's elastic inside the band which shifts and flips, so when I'm taking them off or putting them on I have to make sure I don't let it shift. The color is much lighter than the picture, which was a bummer.<br />-Bra: This is the worst part of the suit. This has absolutely no support. The elastic on the bottom is super loose, so my breasts could potentially fall out. Maye I needed just this piece in a smaller size for my 36B chest. I will never wear this without the black tank, which is annoying since the versatility of either the top alone or with the black tank over gives me options.<br />-Tank: This is decent. It's cut nicely so you can see parts of the bra underneath.<br /><br />-Material: This isn't the highest quality material, but given that it's $18.99 for three pieces I wouldn't expect extremely high quality material. The colors aren't nearly as bright in the one I received.<br /><br />Overall, this won't be my go-to swimsuit, But it will be good for days that I want to take the kids to the pool and I'm not sure I want to get in. It leaves me covered a bit more when we're out boating as well. I am bummed that I can only wear it with the tank on, taking away the versatility of the outfit. I was sent this for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of the swimsuit, this is my honest opinion."
3.0,"Talla S y es super grande, tal vez deberian hacer uno Talla XXS"
3.0,Listed as large but still way too small<br />But the quality seems good especially for the price<br />But order the next size larger
3.0,"It's pretty cute and mostly appears as it does in the picture, except the sleeves aren't exactly the same. If you want a jacket that will keep you warm and dry, the material is very thin and won't do the job. It would only really be useful in maybe slightly windy weather.<br /><br />There are three sets of draw strings: one at the bottom, one around the waist, and one for the hood. The ends of them aren't sewn or sealed in any way and seem to be on the verge of fraying already; I suggest stapling or coating the ends in a clear glue to keep them from fraying. (I already stapled the one in the picture.) The jacket is overall cheaply made, and I wouldn't recommend it for anything but fashion. The skull pattern on the back is very pretty. I'll be keeping it because it's cute, but for those considering buying this, just keep these things in mind. Not sure if it's worth almost $20, but I can imagine wearing this with a lot of different outfits.<br /><br />It's okay overall."
3.0,I bought this for my boyfriend who loves the Raider's. He absolutely loved the shirt but not the size. It took a lot longer than expected to get here. Instead of returning it I just kept it because football season could be over by the time I get a properly fitting one back. I do look good in it though.
3.0,Size is way  smaller than what is described . RETURNED
3.0,Its a bit dangly and thin but the layers are ok
3.0,I have this suit in black and white and thought this suit would be as flattering. Nope.  It was not a good fit at all.
3.0,it broke after the 2nd time wearing it
3.0,"The pants really aren't that bad. The material has some heft to it. The pockets are terrible though. They don't lay flat, but that could be just mine.  I think if the opening was placed not at the leg seam, they would be fine. The electric blue color is as shown, which I love. The belt isn't attached and isn't as long as shown in the picture. However, could be they make the same size belt for all sizes instead of making them longer as the sizes go up, which they should work on. I do wish there was at least a single belt loop in the back as well.  They sadly have to go back, because even though they zip up, I think they'll be too tight for work.  I really want to keep them though, the design works for my shape. But give them a go! It's only 3 stars because of the pockets and the belt."
3.0,Cheeeeeeeeeeeap
3.0,thin and over priced.
3.0,"The  pants were extremely baggy.  I was expecting them to be a nice slim fit like they looked on Oliver  queen,  but they were gangster baggy.  I took them to an alteration shop to make them slim fit  And I got quoted at 150$!  Nearly the price I payed for the whole costume"
3.0,Worth it for the price. It looks a little cheaper but it is cute.
3.0,"It was too small. I’d say order 2 size up. Otherwise, it’s a good looking shirt with nice material."
3.0,Fits great and is comfortable but material is see through! Good for bathing suit cover up.
3.0,Size was off even when tightened all the way need two sizes down to proly get the full effect of the corset. Length was good as well as quality. Just need smaller corset
3.0,I ended up having to throw them out. The inside seam and around the private area was unraveling which can't happen when working out. I have a black pair which are just find so I think I got a defective pair.
3.0,They are thin. I will probably return.
3.0,Nice dress but not true to size
3.0,"Let me start by saying that unless you are in the 1% of the population that has the perfect shaped head for this mask, you're going to have issues with it and need to modify it. The space for the head is huge. I can only assume it was designed that way to accommodate for girls with really long and voluminous hair. If you have short hair, you should plan ahead to have to pad the inside or else it will dent in. I used Kleenex with a wig cap.<br /><br />The chin strap on this thing is awkwardly made. It should have been designed to fit under the chin, but instead it is manufactured to rest on the chin. If you try to put it under your chin, the mask will crease awkwardly. I ended up cutting it off, which of course then created the problem that the mask did not want to stay on.<br /><br />You will sweat if you wear this mask for any decent length of time. Not surprisingly, when you sweat, it will slide up on your face. My biggest battle with this mask was keeping it in place. I was constantly having to pull it down.<br /><br />The back of the mask has a slit down the middle so that it will fit over your head but no way to keep the slit closed once the mask is on. If you don't want it flapped open awkwardly, you will have to install some type of closure. I used velcro, which I don't recommend because it didn't want to stay a lot of the time. If I had to do it over again(which I might next year), I would use a hook and eye closure system.<br /><br />Also, the back of the mask does not go down all the way onto your neck. The bottom of your hairline will show. Depending on which version of Cat Woman you're doing, this is fine. Since I was going for the Michelle Pfeiffer look, it was a bit irritating.<br /><br />I have to give this mask 3 stars just for existing. If you're into cosplay, it will save you a lot of time designing your own mask, but please know that you will still have to work with it a bit."
3.0,"Edit:<br />After one wash, sleeves shrunk to 3/4th length and collar wrinkled up. Pretty poor quality IMO, removing a star.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I Ordered my normal size small, and it is smaller than expected. The sleeves are slightly short and the torso is short, but that actually makes it great for layering under my sweaters. The material and appearance reminds me of the base layer athletes wear. It is comfy and Stretched out slightly through the day."
3.0,"I’m 5’4, 138 pounds at 31 weeks pregnant and a small was still too large and also too long for me. It was a pretty dress, just not for me. Was planning on wearing it to my baby shower, but you couldn’t even tell I was pregnant."
3.0,"Loves how this product fits. It is so figure flattering for curvy girls! The only down size is when washed, the color bleeds. I won’t be able to wear again."
3.0,"I like the robe, I just wish there were loops for the belt on the robe itself; the belt tends to migrate with a lot of movement. Other than that, it is very comfy!"
3.0,The fabric was thinner than image.  I liked the cut but would have to wear a camisole or sports bra under it.<br />Returning it because it's too sheer for me.
3.0,They fit good if you like a tight hugging feelings that will suck you in a bit. doesn't give weird lines around my crotch. Definitely going to order more
3.0,"The sleeves at the watch ends of the bands are barely large enough to get the pins in.  Otherwise, OK"
3.0,Fits fine but came with a grease stain on the back. Wasn’t worth returning
3.0,"Beautiful and good quality. Runs small snd ford definitely bot fit all, as the description claims. I‘d say it’s a small medium."
3.0,They really are oversized.  Gonna keep them cause I need them.
3.0,I didn't like this dress so much on me but it is cute.
3.0,Really nice shoes but they are too narrow even though I bought the wide. Sadly I had to return them.
3.0,The earrings are cute and durable but they turn my ears green and the gold parts go green after a while as well...not a fan of that.
3.0,Not us .sizing even though order bigger size ill give to my granddaughter.
3.0,Very thin material don’t stay up I had to cut ear holes. Other than that they are ok
3.0,Bag is larger then expected
3.0,Very pretty necklace but arrived with a broken lobster claw clasp. Unwearble in its current condition.
3.0,"CON: Kind of thin, Pad was thinner than my other brand shorts. First time wearing them for a Sprint and got a rash. It does say they are not for Chlorinated pools, but they don't say why. Not ideal if your only choice for swim training is in a pool.<br /><br />PRO: They are comfortable, the back pockets are great"
3.0,Ordered according to chart but they still came a tad smaller than chart says.
3.0,"ORDERED A LARGE THEY SAY TO SIZE UP I AM 5'4"" WEIGH 120LBS AND ITS TIGHT ON IF I GAIN A COUPLE OF LBS IM IN TROUBLE I LIKE IT I NORMALLY WEAR A 4-6 SIZE SO IT WAS UPSETTING TO SEE THAT A LARGE WAS TIGHT"
3.0,It does not have real look
3.0,Love the look but too big to wear on a everyday basis
3.0,"Super cute great fabric, fit good only down fall if you got some big boobs there isn't much support for them,"
3.0,"Very pretty and delicate little necklace, but did not stand up to daily usage. Even though I typically remove it to sleep, half of the chain has still faded to silver. It’s so delicate that it’s still wearable but i’m not convinced it actually is gold fill."
3.0,"The dress is pretty and fit as expected but the inside of the dark fabric is white, since it is a high low style you can clearly see the contrast at the bottom making it look cheap."
3.0,"No eres lo que esperas,"
3.0,"Ordered the same size I have ordered for other brands.  These were so tight, I can hardly wear them.  The sock seems to be well made and survived my attempts to pull the sock up to my knee.  But as mentioned, it was too tight so had to fold top down below my calf."
3.0,"Really small like for a child. The fabric is beautiful,<br /> delivery took a very long time"
3.0,Is hard and not so comfortable. Not getting another one
3.0,a little bit small for my face. But overall they are good for the price.
3.0,Kids happy
3.0,Small around arms. Digs in up into my underarm. Okay material nice print.
3.0,You will need to ask my wife
3.0,My son loved it as soon as he saw it.  I wasn’t expecting it to last more than a year but the clip is Very fragile and didn’t last a couple of months from my boy’s backpack.
3.0,Extenders work very well. The snaps don’t hold onto the boot very well and kept coming off and bunching up. I actually superglued them to the inside of the boot and now they work great
3.0,"Not bad...but not great. Good style,Not well made."
3.0,Cute but tight on arms
3.0,You really can't put your cell phone in it because it is to heavy & hangs down.
3.0,This is a one size fits all but it was too big--it made me look sloppy..  I am a size 10.
3.0,The panties band doesn't hold well like the other products made. It's just loose. Not a good plus size product.
3.0,As good as it cost.
3.0,"I'm not crazy about how the fabric hangs. It fits well and launders nicely. I wouldn't buy another one. I'm 5'7"" and 130 lbs. I have a couple similar tunics that drape well."
3.0,"I got this shoe for my (at the time) 6 yr. old son to wear to school everyday (we wear uniforms). I was attracted by the good looks - they really are a handsome pair of shoes. However, they did not last long. Throughout the school year they had to be taken to the shoemaker twice to sew up the stitching at the toe area  - they kept opening up. While these would be great for occasional wear e.g. dress up or church, they do not make a practical everyday shoe for a boy."
3.0,"Wonderful ring, but fits like a 7 when I ordered an 8. Other than that my little brother loved this ring."
3.0,Cute shirt. Ordered a small but fit like a large. I had to return.
3.0,"To those complaining that a round filter won't fit securely in a teardrop-shaped nostril: nostril shape varies by race.  I'm thinking that maybe asian nostrils are rounder inside than caucasian nostrils.  The lady in the photo seems to have fairly round nostrils, anyway. This product was designed by a Japanese company, and I'd guess it sells largely in asian markets.  So, yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised if caucasians have trouble making it fit. And if there's even the tiniest gap for air to leak through, all the air will squeeze through that gap, bypassing the filter.  I've seen pictures on the web of a flexible filter from Bio International Japan (the same company?) that might work better."
3.0,A bit weak...
3.0,"Not overly impressed. I usually purchase medium tops, but I ordered the small, and it was a perfect fit. The material has a nice heavy t-shirt feel. My issue, is that the side seams flare at the bottom. Looks cheap. It will only be worn around the house."
3.0,Not as good looking in person as on Amazon site
3.0,"I love the patterns and the quality of the actual cloth material was about what I was expecting for the price. Fit is likewise good for my 9mo old. However I am disappointed that most of the non-skid dots are falling off with thr first use... See the picture with all the little white dots? Yea, thats from my daughter just standing on hardwood floors at the hospital while visiting relatives there. She hasnt learned those dots even exist yet, if your wondering if she picked them off...no those came off with normal wear. Makes me sad because that is a important feature for us as she is learning to walk and its winter..not sure what I'll do now. Maybe return"
3.0,This is a pretty dress but some of the decorations started to fall off within a couple hours.
3.0,"I liked this dress however it was way too small and I was unable to zip it.  The colors were very pretty and the dress seemed to be good quality.  I didn't like the apron and thought that it would be too hard to get all the wrinkles out after being folded up during delivery.  Overall, this dress would be just fine for an Oktoberfest party or Halloween party but it's not top quality."
3.0,"I loved them so much and hoped I could make them work but the thigh was way too big. I'm 5'6 and about 130 lbs and average build, and even with jeans I could not get the thigh part to stay on my leg. I would walk only a few feet and they would start to sag and fold completely inside out because they were too big- even with the elastic. I wish they had more of a drawstring type design where you could tighten or loosen to make them fit your leg properly. Sadly, had to return them."
3.0,"The glasses are a good size and feel like good quality for the price, but there's one major flaw. The clip is too large and prevents me from pushing my glasses all the way up, which causes my glasses to slide down my nose. I've never had this happen with previous clip ons. It makes them almost unusable."
3.0,Loved the style but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. So close though. Ran big so it didn’t fit my usual 30 waist and I found the material a bit strange. Otherwise nothing wrong with it all.
3.0,This head band does not fit like a regular one it's a little tight.
3.0,Very pretty and stretchy fabric but the top was way too big and the straps were too long
3.0,"I ordered three of these, and each one fit different. My favorite one had the flowers splashed across the chest in an unflattering manner. The second one was a good inch shorter than the first. The third dress (the one I am probably going to keep) is tighter in the top than the first one, but has good flower placement. I am 5'6 and these hit the floor in the perfect length."
3.0,The heart ones where it dips in the middle irritate the nipple but the other one is good
3.0,I liked the sequence.
3.0,"You can definitely tell it's not real, but it gets the job done."
3.0,"Color is spot on, it's beautiful for fall. I found that this is a tad short, but, will work great with leggings. it's comfortable and well sized. Fits true to what you'd typically wear in sizing."
3.0,Looks nice. But the ring is not too strong. Also the purse hoop broke after use in few days.
3.0,"Nice looking, but does not fit my wrist.  Only made for small people."
3.0,"I would buy them again... but here are some things I wish I had known before purchasing<br /><br />~ theses are in no way compress shorts.  I run and have a variety of compression gear and these don't meet the minimum requirements. The fabric is too thin and the fabric blend isn't compression. These are more of sporty boxer briefs. Because thinness of the fabric I also worry about the longevity of the product<br /><br />~ the pockets are large (7in x3.5in). The duel pockets are actually the reason why I purchased these. I have a note 9 (aka huge phone) and it fits easily.  Unfortunately, the lack of compression and fabric blend allows for a bunch of stretches (thus movement) when doing high-intensity training. Not nearly as comparable to having the phone in a pocket but still enough to make me worry<br /><br />~ these run incredibly large. Normally a US large is a 34-36, I'm a 33-34 which according to their pictured chart is a medium. I ordered a small after seeing they ran large and the small that arrived are still pretty loose (thus making the lack of compression even worse)<br /><br />~ the crouch is cut pretty low. It's not a huge problem but this allows for some extra movement when paired with the fabric blend and thinness of the material<br /><br />All this said, I would probably buy these again if they made them in extra small (I'm 6'3. 200lbs... it's laughable that XS would be the right size). Removing the expecting of compression and hoping the extra small would stretch the fabric enough to cut the movement in the pocket these would be ideal underwear<br /><br />~6-month update: I bought another set as these have become some of my go-to underwear (they are not compression shorts). The pockets are still holding there shape and for now keeping my big heavy phone in please on runs and workouts"
3.0,Not as comfy as I hoped it would be..
3.0,"Very thin and no ""compression"" at all, constantly having to pull them down as they ride up!"
3.0,"So far so good, but the left glove seems to have a small wire looped in the palm of the hand. I tried to call the Volt folks and got nowhere so I emailed them and got no reply, really bad customer service for an expensive product. I still have a little time to return them if necessary so I will continue to use them. They do work as expected and I was aware they would be a little bulky and heavy but the good news is that my hands are warm. Would have gotten better rating with better customer service."
3.0,Too big for a woman’s wrist. Thug size.
3.0,"advertised 25 inch head .  came smaller.  just fit my head--tight.  i wear a 7 1/4-that is 23 inch.  fit the sister-in-law.  so gave it to her.  good hat, great brim size, great coverage for working outside"
3.0,"I really wanted this skirt to fit. I read the online reviews and ordered an XL nd could not get it over my hips. The material is only slightly stretchy and shiny. It has a short zipper. I bought the same skirt, same company in black and it fit fine. It was more stretchy and I probably could have fit into a large in that one. I will be sending this one back😢. I would suggest ordering 1 or 2 sizes up. On the positive side, nice fabric and well constructed.  If it had fit, I would have kept it."
3.0,Por el precio esta más o menos aceptable.
3.0,"After a few washes, the socks are not soft and get misshapen."
3.0,I had to return because chest area was too tight.......and I am not large in that particular area. I would have preferred the whole set to fit a bit loser.
3.0,"The prayer shawl is find.  I think they should be in wool or cotton materials, but the shawl is good and I like the ideal of it."
3.0,"It's hard to tell from the pics, but the beads on this are tiny TINY and the whole thing seems rather fragile. I was expecting beads the size of, say, the beads on a lightbulb pull-chain. So far it hasn't fallen apart, though. We'll see."
3.0,Let me preface this by saying I am a 65 year old male who has been wearing compression socks for a while.  I love these compression socks.  Best I have ever purchased.  BUT......Amazon is way overpriced on this item.  I bought 2 pair on Amazon and paid $33.57.  Found the exact same ones at Walgreens.  Two pair at Walgreens $19.89-a savings of  $13.68.
3.0,Ok to use ..but doesnt have alot of grip on the fingers..
3.0,"The dress was pretty! The green is a beautiful dark emerald color. The fabric is a bit thin, but I expected that. The length however is very short. I'm 5'8 and I tried the medium and large, both sizes the dress ended about 2 inches off the floor with bare feet. I was looking for a dress that skimmed the floor while I had 1 inch heels on so I ended up returning these."
3.0,Heavy duty and good build quality... just too dang small! Sizes definitely not fit to American sizing standards. Most certainly asian sized. Asian XL is approximate to US Small. I thought they sent me a child's jacket.
3.0,"I love that these are quality cargo shorts, but I'm sure they're a mens fir. The inseam is huge, and have since bought actually marketed mens shorts that the inseam was shorter. Great quality though. I wear an American womens size 14 and bought a 2x, probably could've bought a 1x but everyone was saying how small these fit."
3.0,"I did not like the wavy neck line, sleeves, or hem of the dress. The buttons were not centered properly on the dress. The material under the lace was a satin material which made the dress look fancy. the dress is knee length.<br /><br />I returned the dress."
3.0,They are beautiful but very heavy.
3.0,Cheaply made but what do you expect for such a cheap price? They're cute but won't last long.
3.0,"I love the Esenchel brand and have other styles by them.  This one was a miss for me.  NOT because of the quality (which I rave about) but because of the style.  I am a mature woman (meaning thicker body) and this was too body hugging for me and just looked nasty on me.  Because it is a slim/close fitting style it has slits on both sides and yes, my hips pulled them open and that made me look even bigger than I am (5'4"" and 136lbs.). Couldn't get it off me fast enough!<br /><br />I didn't want to give this a 1 star rating because I don't want to bring the brand down (I love my 5 or 6 other pieces from them and think this brand has terrific quality) but I do want you to know this style is unforgiving."
3.0,"Runs extremely small, loved the style but unfortunately will be returning."
3.0,The fabric is quite thick/heavy. Almost like a sweater. I was expecting a thinner shirt.
3.0,I didn't like Mitch match socks and wanted to be able to reach in and grab out a match. I have three girls.. perfect. I will order a larger size for myself
3.0,"Dress style was fine. It’s hard to see in the listed photos, but there is a gap in the top below the tie. At the bottom of the dress, there was large 5-6 inch rip as pictured. Fabric is very sheer and could only be used in warm weather situations. Ended up returning because quality was not as expected."
3.0,"I purchased set A. The pointer is missing, they are now out of stock. I can not find a way to contact yiwong directly."
3.0,Pretty but runs small. Not the most durable but pretty.
3.0,The watch looks really nice but it seems the leather strap quality isn't that great. The strap may tear if not used carefully.
3.0,"A bit small.  I expected more flowy.  This is more like a typical tank top.  Otherwise, it’s cute.  I’ll be returning it bcs it’s not the fit I am looking for."
3.0,Fit smaller than expected. Good quality.nice look .
3.0,I usually buy size L but based upon the comments it runs big. So i ordered a M it fits good on my arms but its long. Color is nice.
3.0,"As another user described, the fit really is like scrubs. There’s something not cute about that that I can’t put my finger on, so I’m returning it. Also I bought it a little too large, with 6 extra inches to the bust. But the fabric is nice and smooth, feels comfortable"
3.0,It is soft and comfortable and it fits great but unlike the description it isnt a jacket its more like a light weight sweater and on the tag it say 100 % polyester so on that part im a little bit dissatisfied but other than that its good
3.0,"I am a slender man, 6'1 and at the moment am probably 165. These are super tight, probably wouldn't be good for a person with more size. I just wear em around the house so its not a big deal really. Quality is about what you would imagine for the price."
3.0,"I bought one of these scarves in a color that doesn't appear to be offered anymore, but it was grey with elephants.  At any rate, the scarf I received was cute.  It was true to the picture.  I didn't expect the huge amount of fabric that composed the scarf.  While a light fabric, the scarf does become the center of attention.  I had expected something that was something a little more subtle in its size.  The quality of the piece is not what I expected; there were loose strings throughout the piece.  The piece on a whole is fine, but I'm uncertain whether I would purchase another of these scarves in a different design."
3.0,"The tiara is well made (just the band, no comb to set into hair, but we used as a cake topper), and my daughter loves the necklace.  Our biggest issue was with the wand.  One stone was loose and fell out right away, and a couple hours later, the main stone fell out.  They are just hot glued on, and I guess they weren't adhered right away so the glue hardened without good adhesion.  I can fix it, but I shouldn't have to.  Be careful with a toddler under three."
3.0,"This sweater is well enough made, but I did not find it flattering. I’m 5’10 155 lbs 36 DD and size small fit. So it runs quite large! The extra material and fitting at the hip area was not flattering on me"
3.0,I have a size six foot but these are closer to a size eight.
3.0,The sizing was absolutely not 18GA so order a smaller size. My nose still hurts and it’s been a week
3.0,It was fun for my daughter but the bangs stood straight up. I had to pin them down and that didn't last.
3.0,It is much smaller than I thought it would be. I’m also having a hard time getting the shoulder strap on. It’s okay.
3.0,I love the ring but it only last for month. it broke. I will order another one.
3.0,I guess I should have read the description a little bit better but all it is is a handbag I thought it had a long strap for shoulder to
3.0,The chain is cheap. The links stretch and come apart.
3.0,"It technically fits, it technically is what it supposed to be. However, it is not comfortable. The fabric does not feel good on skin, and since it's tender skin, it matters. For the price, it was okay. I just hoped for a little more."
3.0,"This dress is sized way big. I usually wear a 12 and ordered an 8 based on reviews and size chart. It was still too big. It's also mesh and see through on the back and anywear that doesn't have lace. If I were going to a different function, that might be ok. But, I'm going to a catholic wedding and don't particularly want my rib tattoos on display. Overall, disappointed because I really wanted to love this."
3.0,The wave cap stretches out After a couple of weirs and it Don’t  fit your head anymore
3.0,For adults only. It did not fit my 7 year old.
3.0,Just note the bands are true to size if you have a small wrist get small otherwise you’re gonna have a difficult time adjusting the band also they tend to get caught on objects and come apart probably after you’ve worn them a while
3.0,"It’s a cute seat, but it still didn’t make my bike seat anymore comfortable. It might work for some people, or even work better over a less rock hard seat. But alas, that isn’t the case for me."
3.0,"I am a 36DDD and got the XL. The cup size on the XL would maybe fit a C, but the band size was too big for me, so sizing up isn’t an option. These are lovely and seem to be good quality, but it’s yet another example of bralettes that promise to accommodate large busts, but don’t deliver. I so want to be able to wear a pretty bralette, but I think such a thing just doesn’t exist for anyone bigger than a C. Boo :("
3.0,"They are ok, and the fit was good.. however they are kind of heavy and bulky compared to my other fight shorts by hyabusa.. also the waistband is not very flexy in comparison to others I own its a bit stiff.... Not bad but could be better."
3.0,I bought this for the beautiful gradient & sunset hues. It’s a lot darker than what’s pictured and completely missing the yellow. The dress fits nice but not what I wanted.
3.0,"I really like the pattern and style, but it was bigger around the waist than I realized.  Ended up returning it."
3.0,The size was great. The fabric is nice and soft cotton. The stitching isn't the best. Within 2 hours he had a small hole in the crotch. Overall we are satisfied.
3.0,Runs way smo
3.0,"Cumbersome, stiff.  BIGGER than expected."
3.0,"Very soft and comfortable, but they do shed/pill! So, they look kind of ratty after wearing them only once. I haven't washed them since wearing them, so I'm not sure how they will hold up after washing. The pic on the far left is new from the package and the other two are after wearing once for about 8 hours."
3.0,"Decent quality, but a little small."
3.0,"I've used these tights 1-2x a week for a semester and they are coming to an end in their usage. They worked well during, though. I got a size S/M and am 5'6"" (116 lbs) and I felt they were a bit small in length. I could stretch them over my waist, but the crotch was lower than I would have liked."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, but I found it fit tighter than their other dresses. I bought this dress in my normal size and it's too tight on my arms and waist. I'll size up next time and see if that makes a difference."
3.0,I know this was only $9.99 but the chain already had tarnished parts on it. The heart itself was perfect. I will stick with Baublebar!
3.0,"the waist is tight, I love these yoga pants and I first ordered a medium an it was tight so I ordered a large an they feel the same!"
3.0,size is big for a necklace
3.0,Super cute! But it fell apart after a few weeks
3.0,delivery was so fast and the dress fit so perfect
3.0,"These yoga leggings are just okay. They are super cheap, and can go in the dryer, but the waist isn't very comfortable. I am in between an XS and a S, neither one of them fit just right. The fabric is moisture-wicking but really thick for hot yoga.I would recommend the Yoga Reflex ones instead for a few more $."
3.0,"Wow, this runs small.  I knew it did so I ordered up and I’ve worn it once but woah....talk about tight!!!  Also, major uniboob 😢"
3.0,Like the cloths but it was to small for my 9year old even is a size 16/18
3.0,"Fits well, but too heavy and the tongue too large that hurt my ankle....I dislike it.....I try once. But no more....Converse-all Stars is excellent to play basketball....sorry ."
3.0,"It was s sorry for little ones, creepy for older ones but hard to see through"
3.0,It looks pretty much what I expected.  I like it.
3.0,Cute too but order atleast two sizes up if you're a DD or bigger
3.0,The zippers are constantly getting stuck.
3.0,"I purchased this item for a Christmas gift, but decided to keep it for myself.  When you go to wrap it, it's more like a scarf than a wrap; covers the tops of your shoulders, but gathers mostly around your neck.  I can wear it to work since it gets cold in the office. Still shopping around...."
3.0,"I was torn on this review. I did not receive a band like the picture or that I ordered, but I love the way the band fits. It is SO MUCH DARKER! I do not love the color or pattern, but I do like the fit. It fits my Apple Watch series 6 40 mm perfectly. This is the most comfortable band to sleep in. I love the stretchiness and how it just slips on. I wish it matched the picture. If it did, this would have been 5/5. If I would have known it would look like this, I would have chosen a different pattern."
3.0,I like the top. It is a bit sheer and you can see through it.  I will have to wear a camisole underneath the top.  A little disappointed. I may decide to return it.
3.0,not bad but a bit smaller than expected
3.0,"It is nice, but I can get better ones for half the price. I didn’t like that the back was hollowed out"
3.0,This item runs small
3.0,Not as great as I thought it would be it's kinda ugly
3.0,These ran a bit small despite selecting the size the fit chart said would work for me.  Unfortunately being too small with this kind of design made them quite uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,Meh. Shorts are way too short. Cute but not what I hoped. Went for Diff style same brand I ordered and like better. Won’t order these and may donate as I’ll prob not wear them. May as well walk around in undies for the lack of coverage shorts offer.  Permanent wedgie not my jam
3.0,I sell laser cut jewelry and these used to be my go to cords for my pendants. The clasps are cheap and some have detached during wear. I take a pair of pliers and do an extra crimp to secure them.<br /><br />The last batch had this terrible and strong metallic smell to them though so I'm wary of re-ordering.
3.0,"NICE FEATURE, THE MATERIAL IS GOOD AND RESISTENT. BUT THE BUTTONS FALL OFF EASILY, I ALREADY LOST FOUR OF THEM, THE ZIPPER IS NOT VERY DURABLE, AND IT IS NOT WATER RESISTENT."
3.0,Don’t get me wrong it’s cute and I wish it would have fit better. I typically wear anywhere from xl-3x depending on brands and this pretty much fits with the exception of the odd rounded hem under the chest. While the piece looks plenty wide from the first pic I have in the second one I show the inside which has an elastic band sewn in that cuts so much off the side. I put my hand in the picture for a size reference. This elastic band sits right under your chest and it’s also the only part of this whole piece that’s to tight for me to the point that the rest of the cover up rides up.
3.0,"I really like the bag, it is bigger than I thought it would be and super cute. But the button clasp on the front separated from the material within the first week of use, so it feels less secure to use."
3.0,"Being unisex, the sizes are large. I'm 5'3 and 125lbs,this shirt came almost to my knees. Everything else was great. Soft, comfortable and got me through my first few weeks after shoulder surgery."
3.0,"Unfortunately, I'm still trying to figure out how to perk up this fascinator like it was in the Urban CoCo photo.  It came in an envelope; it's smashed flat and all of the feathers are bent.  ???  The pink color is beautiful, just as shown in the photo, so I'm going to try to make it work."
3.0,They earings are hard to stay on. They easily fall off. I ended up just getting my ears pierced the day after these came in cause they wouldnt stay on.
3.0,"The logo on the cap was blurry, in the amazon picture it is very sharp."
3.0,I was expecting more support.  But it was loose fitting and I didn't like much my breasts moved when I had to jump around.
3.0,"The chain broke the second day I had it and one wing doesn't want to open easily. The watch itself is keeping time, so you get what you pay for."
3.0,The skirt came quickly! It has pretty bright colors and looked like it was going to be way too small~ but low and behold it actually fit but did not drape out as the photo suggests. And it was too short. I am 5'8&#34; tall and wear a med to a large (depending on the garment).
3.0,"Bought to wear to school. It is very light weight, wore it once to school and was self conscious about it."
3.0,"another reviewer commented on how orange it was.  Spot on.  If you are looking for something the shade of the pic or your actual Burberry items,  this isn't it."
3.0,Too small for what I need it for<br />I’ll donate them to the kids next door
3.0,Based in the sizing I went up one size just to be safe and it's still snug. It fits around me but the cups squish my boobs. Other than that the material feels nice and it seems to be constructed well.
3.0,"These are cute, In the pick it looks like these are round ,  they are not took off two stars for tat .  but they are cute I just wish they were ROUND"
3.0,This was much smaller than I thought it was going to be.  The pattern is really pretty though.  I gave it to a coworker who was admiring it because it was too small for me to use and I didn't want to send it back.  She was very happy!
3.0,Many of the jewels were breaking and coming apart when installing. Just pay more.
3.0,"Love the colors and shape, wish they were cork screw though. The short stud sometimes almost feels tight and has fallen out a couple times pretty easily."
3.0,The pack and the order stated there were 20 charms. Only 10 were in the pack .
3.0,"I like the hat but it is a little smaller than I expected but for the price it is ok. It is a little thinner than I thought it would be, I suppose it will be ok."
3.0,"There are three black masks with the HS company logo in this package and all of them fit well but are loose in the chin area.<br /><br />None of the masks have a filter pocket or bendable nose wire. They also do not have adjustable ear elastics.<br /><br />The masks almost fit me perfectly if it were not for the loose chin area. These are still usable but are not yet perfect. If they were from fitting all over, this would have received 4.5 stars from me. I personally do not like having a company logo on a mask.<br /><br />In summary, these are not my favorite masks since they do not mold to my face but they are still functional. The current price of $29.99 comes to $10 per mask which is on the high side of competitively priced."
3.0,These horns are light weight and the headband itself is thick and comfortable to wear. I would suggest re-gluing (with super glue) the gold tips and studded ribbon. It’s cheap-ish but perfect for a few wears.
3.0,I originally ordered a size 11 but that was too small so I ordered a size 12. Well I will be returning that one also as it is too small also. In fact it appeared to be the same size as the pair of 11's I had returned.
3.0,Run small and not very flattering
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 120lbs so I ordered a S/M. They are not that tight, but are still completely see through. They'll be great for yoga at home, but these definitely won't be leaving the house"
3.0,"Gave to my son, he can wear them"
3.0,"I was hoping to receive the same thickness leather as my original belt, but it was much thinner and flimsy."
3.0,a tad bit flimsy
3.0,The product unravels at the seams. Would be great otherwise.
3.0,"Extraordinarily stretchy like a nylon stocking.  But real issue is the White fabric one, it permanently stains so easy and cannot wash them out, looked so bad had to toss out."
3.0,"Items only exist in small and super large. I'd expect small to be too small for my hands, but I knew extra large would be.<br /><br />Small fits like a lg in most other gloves, there's about 3/4"" past my fingers. I want now realistic sizing"
3.0,Cute a lil big too
3.0,"These are very beautiful, but the pin is incredibly thick. They leave large holes in certain fabrics"
3.0,"runs small, material has no stretchability"
3.0,"Smaller then I had thought and not as defined as advertised, but still cute. I still like them, but I guess I was expecting more."
3.0,"They fit, but:<br /><br />* They're just hard plastic, not rubbery like OEM<br /><br />* They don't stay on. OEMs press into place and don't come off without being pulled off- these almost fall off just taking the glasses off."
3.0,Ran small and the material is like spandex. Was really difficult to put on and my child did not like being in it for too long
3.0,"If you are looking for something to wear underneath your jacket in the winter these are fine. They are plain, but the quality is good."
3.0,"I order my size and it is a little too big. So I would recommend ordering a size down. You obviously can't through this in the dryer since it is a delicate material. Not bad for the price, but I will give it 3 stars For it not being true to size."
3.0,Decided to keep item
3.0,Good fit overall. The jacket is good for the price. Just wish the zipper wasn’t bad. It takes a few trys to get it to go down. It seems a little fragile so I hope it won’t break.
3.0,"First time I wore it, I am like WOW I am walking on a cloud. It was so soft. But on a long walk I felt pain right below the toe. It might be because of the excessive softness? Anyway it is very stylish and it even has a secret place to stow your valet keys when you go for a stroll in a beach!"
3.0,Great color as expected but it arrived with a larger snag in the back. :(
3.0,"Fits very well, but it faded after only one use."
3.0,"Def a santa costume. Gloves are cheesy, beard was rough,  but it was cute"
3.0,Super narrow.  Really tight and narrow.
3.0,They were really cute and great quality but super heavy for your ears.
3.0,"It's not entirely as pictured, it's much shorter. The ends sit about at my hips rather than knees as pictured. The material is fairly cheap I've worn it a few times and it hasn't fallen apart yet. It looks nice on and isn't uncomfortable. The maroon color is a bit lighter than pictured too."
3.0,"On true smaller size and clings in all the wrong places. I’ll still use it to run in but not in public!<br />If you have hips or any form of “mom tummy” or bloating, it’ll cling and accent that area."
3.0,This is a very nice mask but has a strong chemical smell that gave me a headache. Having an all cotton mask is counter productive if you coat it with a chemical. It might be the silicone coating which may prevent moisture but would make it harder to breathe.
3.0,For A money I pay is good dress<br />I'm 5'6 190 lbs ordered XL looks ok.<br />Color not what I was thinking<br />Is good for work not party with some scarfs or necklaces gonna looks good.
3.0,Good ring. The stones come off very easily.
3.0,Very very sheer so will use as bathing suit cover up instead of dress. Too hot in TX to layer it enough to not look like you’re not wearing anything
3.0,I got the yellow and was unexpectedly thin. Anything worn under is going to show through it.
3.0,I didn’t know it had no buttons. Would of liked to button up
3.0,Most of them broke apart while trying to place into the holes on my Crocs!
3.0,It ok could be better
3.0,Ordered the medium petite and the sleeves were about 4 inches too long. I really doubt it’s even a petite even though the tag said it was. It was a little too big around the body also.
3.0,"Cute and snug. Should have listened to the reviews about them being small. They are comfortable, just not a pull on type of sock if you have larger than a 7.5 foot. I wear an 8. Definitely not for Winter bc the fabric is on the thin side. If you like a tight thin sock then they are for you."
3.0,Lovely colors in the stone.  It arrived as pictured.  There is only one problem ... the size.  It is difficult to put on and take off.
3.0,The shoes were nice. I was very disappointed due to the back ankle wrap over strap was way too big. Didn't touch my ankle at all. My foot wouldn't stay in the shoe.
3.0,It says white but I received cream colored gloves. Needed white gloves for a parade and could not wear them. They fit well.
3.0,Cute design and fits well. But the fabric is tacky and not breathable. Looks cheap.
3.0,I expected the material to be of a better quality
3.0,"Hole was very small and hard to fill. One of the four I ordered, had a hole drilled clear thru. Disappointed we couldn't all fill these at same time."
3.0,Runs small. Had to pass it down to my preteen niece.
3.0,Attract all any any fuzzy things and gets caught in fabric. Won't buy again
3.0,"I received the item quickly. I wear a size 16 and the XL fit me. This costume-quality dress has a nice style but is made cheaply. The slight V in front of the dress is off-center. The shoulders are much too large and the dress gaps as a result. The white ""underskirt"" part sticks out in front of the ""overdress"". The silver belt is sewn to the front but not the back of the dress. The fabric is ok. I bought this dress for a summertime event, and I appreciate that the lightweight fabric will not make me overheat.  Overall - this costume should be priced cheaper for the quality."
3.0,"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing these pair of boots.<br />I normally wear size 6.5-7 but bought size 8 because these boots run smaller, which mean you'll have to go up a size.<br /><br />I didn't expect these boots too be THIGH THIGH HIGH! Im 5'3 and the boots goes all the up to my upper thigh and is actually 3 inches away from crotch.<br /><br />Overall, fast shipping....very comfortable But My only wish is that it wouldnt be sooooo thigh high :( It'd better if it stopped around my midthigh area."
3.0,"Length was good, but the strap seems like it was made for someone who has problems with large amounts of fluid build up in their feet."
3.0,You strap them at the points that the skis are balanced. Then the front strap slips to the binding throwing the balance of and making it uncomfortable to carry.<br />If you do use them you need to put the strap on tight.
3.0,The plastic lens has popped out of these classes three separate times in the past first week that I've owned them  😖
3.0,"Cut the buttons off and replaced them to try to perk it up, but donated it anyway. Not worth the $."
3.0,The jewel in the middle fell off as I was removing it from the package. I used gorilla glue to secure it. Loose stitching.
3.0,This tshirt is more of a juniors size XL; definitely not woman's XL
3.0,Not quite  right for my grandson.
3.0,"Looks nice but is a little too small to fit money in the zipper and the part that clips to the lanyard came off the hole, and this is pretty cheap and not quality."
3.0,Too bulky to be comfortable
3.0,Still a great Quality shirt - will buy 1 size up in future.
3.0,"The hat itself is ok, but it sure isnt an XS for kids.  Its an adult size I received."
3.0,"When I first tried on the sweater I noticed that it constantly felt like it was going to fall off my shoulders. The cut is something i had to get used to. Once I wore it for a whole day, I got used to it. The material is very soft and thick. Overall I like it."
3.0,"Upon receiving the strap I could tell it is a good quality strap. The leather wasn't extremely pliable but could tell it would loosen up after a bit of use or working it a bit. I unfortunately decided to rate it a 3 and return it as it was too short. I only have 7 1/4"" wrists but it barely went around.  The tang was in the 3rd hole and the tail just barely went to the 2nd keeper (the loose one) so it was basically useless. In addition, the loose keeper was too loose but would have been ok if the tail would have been longer. A good strap but just too short to be a great strap."
3.0,"The packaging was excellent and it wasn't damaged. AlThough, I'm afraid it was too small for an Adult male."
3.0,Works just fine but is a little overpriced
3.0,"I was really excited for this coverup to come. Material of it was nice, although seemed it could rip easily. I was quite upset when I put it on because it was huge! Much to wide and it came down to my knees. I got the medium. I am 5'6'' and 160 pounds. Will be returning this item."
3.0,It is very big.but beautiful and well made.
3.0,"Material is great but too small from the arms and too large overall, weird fit"
3.0,Cute skirt but small and extremely short on me... and I'm only 5'2&#34;!
3.0,The dress is made like a huge tent not fitted on top as shown. Not form fitting just wide n straight down dress!
3.0,"too loose, I wish it is a little tight and stay where I like it to be."
3.0,"Fit well, launders ok, decoration is great, it's just a tad wimpy in the thread count, a little too almost see through for me, especially for a pale color. I still wear it, but I layer for comfort."
3.0,The clasp that you pull the strings through has lost its grip in less than a month of wear and the bracelet keeps falling off of my arm!
3.0,"They were bigger then the picture. I was actually surprised when I opened the box. I thought they were more silver and it was more pearl type look. I know it says pearl hoops bit to me it looked like silver balls.<br />They do look a little cheap to be honest. Not sure if I will have anything to wear them with. Pearls se traditional, yet they are so big... a strange combo."
3.0,"Pay attention to photo of sleeves, they are like salsa  dancer sleeves. Also, mine was defective in armpits, was very tight and gap noticeable even with arms closed. Lastly, for a warm weather design fabric was very thick. Return cost not worth it, seller was willing to give a small return. Will try to remember to upload picture of defect.  Will also try to remember never ever get tops that don't have free returns,  not worth the risk. It might look decent if I cut off the attached sleeve fabric, and God willing if I ever find the time use that fabric to fix the armpit gap...or just call it a loss and throw away."
3.0,"Beautiful, awesome stretchy fabric. However, I wear a 14, but sized up to a 2XL because of my bigger chest.. the waist sits up almost comically high- I don’t think this was made to ever accommodate anything over a B cup."
3.0,Short is a nice fabric weight and beautiful color Kind of a burgundy cranberry color. The shirt was in a sealed plastic bag and when I open the bag and took the shirt out it was an overwhelming smell of cologne or perfume or something that the shirt has been washed in our sprayed that was terrible. I immediately put it in the wash after I tried it on it was a little oversized when I put it on washed it in cold water hung it up to dry tried it back on you can still smell the perfume on the shirt. The shirt actually shrink a little bit. So it’s no longer oversized. I was very surprised it shrank at all having so much polyester in it but it did. I’m not that worried about that part just the fact that whatever was sprayed on it or if it was worn and washed and returned.
3.0,If you’re looking for something to where in the yard it will work but it looks and feels cheap.
3.0,The color and length are not as depicted.  It came to the top of the calf not full length.
3.0,"I thought it would look like the picture, like a stone, but it’s just plain purple. The plus side is that it came with another earring as a gift."
3.0,Adequate but the material is much too thin.
3.0,Little smaller then thought .. Not as soft as thought .
3.0,Overall I thought this was such a beautiful dress but it ran to small.
3.0,It will fit fine once I'm not pregnant but it definitely doesn't fit as described.
3.0,The bottoms are not true to size
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet but very delicately linked together, first one broke so had to by daughter another"
3.0,I’m between sizes so a small would be to short for my torso and a medium is a tad too long for my torso. The cinched waist definitely helps with it looking better and is very comfortable
3.0,Please be aware that the product is not leather and the pink beads do leave a stain on your wrist.  I believe the beads are loosing the dye ???
3.0,This seemed to be a little shorter than I expected based on the picture. Also the top part was not flattering for me. I felt exposed more than I expected Also my breast are not so big but it still seemed they could easily pop out. I was not comfortable with it so for that reason I sent it back.
3.0,"I worn it one time and where I washed it, it ripped. Regret this purchase"
3.0,"I really like this pretty chain but after taking it on and off almost daily it broke after three months.  If you’re going to get this, just keep it on or get a size you can slip over your head."
3.0,I really wanted to like this little clutch.  It has zippers on both sides and is the perfect size....BUT the zipper is horrible.  It sticks and skips.  It's awful.....I sent it back.
3.0,Took forever to be delivered and is smaller than size indicates
3.0,"Would call this a mid- to heavyweight waffle robe.  One-size fit is roomy.  The quality of the fabric is good; ordered it specifically for the color-matched velour contrast fabric on the sleeves and shawl collar.  However, the finish work is poor - it arrived with the inner velour sleeve lining detached in places.  Fabric edging around the inside of the collar is inadequate and fraying.  A good buy if you don't mind getting out needle and thread when it arrives.  You get what you pay for, I guess."
3.0,"This thing is super thick, but the spring bars are terrible. Replace those and you have yourself a decent strap for 11 dollars"
3.0,"The denim is a very comfortable stretch, very smooth, not at all abrasive,  and the wash-out look is happily customary.  Somehow the lengthwise stitching is made to look worn, but it's a talent all jeans makers seem to have mastered by now.<br /><br />But here's the odd part: I'm an exact 32"" waist going back many decades, so it was odd to have this pair of jeans promptly slipping down my waist toward a butt-crack, plumber-style stasis. The length (30"") as marked is about right and will be worn with boots.<br /><br />In reassessing the cut and the ""skinny / slim"" claim for these jeans, it seems more to be about halfway between ""regular"" and ""slim"" than to be ""skinny"" or slim. The ""skinny"" cut seems apt at the ankles, but definitely not at the waist.<br /><br />The pockets are sized just right, and there's even a coin pocket (hence the ""five-pocket"" description).<br /><br />I may have missed it, but I couldn't see on the tags where these likely imported items were manufactured or assembled.  Some consumers like to know (e.g., preferring Bangladesh or Pakistan over China).<br /><br />This may be the only pair of jeans in the wardrobe which is unwearable without a belt, except perhaps as part of some cross-gendered version of a belly dance, the audience for which is ever-diminishing."
3.0,"I used this product for CrossFit. It works well for lifting, however, I bought them to be able to tighten and loosen as needed during a WOD.  They are made well, but the material is stiff and does not loosen and tighten easily. I washed them hoping the material would soften, but it did not."
3.0,Cute dress but way too small. Very high waisted.
3.0,I expected the material to be more durable but it's pretty flimsy and seems to run small. It looks nice but in person it looks more like a sneaker rather than a boot.
3.0,"I used their sizing guide. I’m a 38D, so I ordered a 2X. It was too big."
3.0,The were smaller than I thought they would be. It barely fits my 5 year old. The size is suitable for 2-4 year olds.
3.0,"I do airbrush work with lacquer. I was looking for a low cost mask to use that would block the strong odor of lacquer. This one does great. While doing airbrush work I do not smell any hint of lacquer at all while wearing the mask. My biggest complaint is the lack of a way to purchase new filters. Oh, be prepared for the bands to come lose while tightening the mask to your face. Once you get it adjusted they do ok."
3.0,They’re super cute and my daughter recieved multiple compliments on them but they are not durable at all... I bought these not too long after quarantine started so we haven’t been many places... just simple small family functions and they’re already coming apart smh... she’s 3 so these are the very 1st pair of shoes she’s ever owned that are coming apart unfortunately...
3.0,"I am only giving less starts due to sizing.  The quality of this is decent for the price and its a very cute style however I ordered nearly 2 sizes up from what my child would normally wear and it's pretty much an exact fit (She can typically wear a 4/5 easily at the store, I tried the 8 and there is no grow room at all)  I wondered if it would be itchy but the inside is lined and my daughter says its soft enough on the inside that she can wear though any smaller and it would probably rub; the zipper works well and is needed as there is not much stretch. All in all, this is likely a 1 time wear for us and will work for the price & what we needed- good for costumes, a theme or party as long as you order a generous size!  I am considering returning if a next size up is available in time for when we need it (meaning my daughter who is typically 4/5 would be wearing a 10)  My daughter does love the look of it though and didnt want to take off after trying on!"
3.0,"Liking this watch a lot - beautiful color and design. I wish the bands around the strap were metal though...every leather watch I buy, those skinny straps always end up breaking...this one seems pretty sturdy, I give it a year and a half.<br /><br />UPDATE: The battery died out super fast, in two months, or less. 😩"
3.0,"Very pretty, but much heavier than I thought it would be."
3.0,"I bought two of these, the teal and the peach. The colors are beautiful. The fabric is just weird, though. It's very thick and textured. It looks like someone took a lovely shade of silly putty and pressed it onto a rough surface. I don't want to wear it anywhere."
3.0,very pretty but it came with a broken piece off.
3.0,"Love very much how they look,but they run very small."
3.0,Love how easy they are to put in. But mine seem to pop out ocassionally. Already lost 1 immediately and the gem in one has already tarnished :/
3.0,Cute...but barely fits my phone.
3.0,"This will be a gift for a 12 year old and I think she will really like it.<br /><br />The clasps work well and there is a tiny little ""crystal"" dangler attached to each clasp, which is cute.<br />They both have adjustability.<br /><br />Don't expect this to look like ""the real"" thing. It is about what you would expect for the price point.<br />I would recommend this for children."
3.0,"Gorgeous top, but WAY too big. I'll give it to a friend."
3.0,"Nice item for price, a little small."
3.0,Super cute dress. It did not even close in the front.
3.0,Cute skirt great for little girls my 11yr old got med fit great. 28inch waist. 4'11 came right above knees.
3.0,There aren't any choices for sizes like men's 13. They should be available.
3.0,"These are okay, but they are for a tall lady.  I'm 5 ""6 and I would need to hem them up at least 5"".  They go way under my feet."
3.0,"I normally wear a small or medium so I bought a medium in this... luckily, I wasn't planning on wearing it buttoned anyway. Runs a little snug. Otherwise, great top. Love the color. Just couldn't fit over my boobs."
3.0,I wanted to love this suit. Butttt being large chested it just didn’t fit correctly without the straps turning and making it uncomfortable. I was sad to have to return it
3.0,"3 stars because the rose quartz one came with the stone out of the mermaid, and is currently precariously set back in place via the little hole y'all had to pin the tail to the stone. These were gifts..so I'm a tad disappointed by that but they are still beautiful and aside from the cheap setting they're exactly what I wanted, a little bigger than imagined but I prefer them this size as apposed to what I had envisioned."
3.0,I wear 36 and ordered a large because their chart suggested it. Was way to small and had to return.
3.0,"Not stretchy, fits small... I wear large to XL and this fits like a medium and I ordered a 2X to be safe. Fits fine around busy and waist , hips are huge so not so much. I was hoping for float material.Oh well, gotta get smaller right!"
3.0,Pretty but tight.  They're smaller than 7 inches. It might've said this and I just didn't pay attention.
3.0,"cute sandal, however, my pinky toe keps sticking out as much as it can! It is soooo annoying"
3.0,Didnt see the soccer ball. Or any for boys
3.0,"I wore this as part of my Marty McFly Jr costume for Halloween 2015, and it looked awesome.  But this is largely because I invested a good 4 or 5 hours making some alterations on it (after investing another hour or so into learning how to sew in the first place).  The sleeves have a ton of material in them, as a byproduct of their being 'extendable' like in the movie.  But the jacket only has two small weak Velcro straps to hold up this material on each sleeve, which is insufficient: the excess accordion-like rolls of fabric bulge out awkwardly.  The sleeves were also far too wide for me."
3.0,"Pretty stretchy and thin.  Definitely not for high impact if you are bigger than x-small.  But, very comfortable- great for running errands or hanging around the house.  Would recommend,  just not for anything too active."
3.0,It looked really cute and the quality seemed okay but it definitely ran small. I normally wear LG but being chiffon I know there is no stretch and ordered an XL but still couldn't get it over my chest.
3.0,Left seam from waste band down separates. Has happened on all pairs and all colors.
3.0,Almost wouldn’t attach. The part that connects to watch is too thick afraid it’s going to come undone.
3.0,I have a hard time keeping by boobs from popping out the top. I ordered a size bigger because I had originally ordered the correct sized and it was small. Needed to by double sided skin tape to keep from falling out.
3.0,"It was very cute bbuutt VERY small!  I usually wear a large (size 12, in most stores) but ordered an XL. It looked like a small. I could not have gotten it buttoned to save my life, there was at least a 4 inch gap!  Even if I could have gotten it buttoned it still would have been too short to wear as a dress. It barely covered my bottom.  Super cute but runs VERY small."
3.0,"The grey and red pair fit great but even though the black pair’s tag says it’s a medium, it definitely is not. For the price, I’m ok with just two pairs. I’d rather keep the two than return all three."
3.0,Would like it if it were a looser fit.  I ordered larger than I usually do due to the reviews but it still was snugger than I would prefer.
3.0,"Good to look at and Good fit too, material is not soft !!"
3.0,It isn't as long as shown! I was expecting to get an over-sized sweatshirt but I got a crop top. Its still cute and that is my only complaint but just know that it is very short!
3.0,I would not buy it again. The photos don't tell the true story
3.0,Chest fit weird and elastic road up
3.0,Hard to see due to enormous glare against the glass. I do like the band and the style.
3.0,Loved the xolor and fit was fine...except the rhick elastic band. Super uncomfortable and looks terrible.
3.0,"I bought a large and normally wear between a  med to large, but these were really tight, so going to return for an X-large. I'm not fond of super tight yoga pants. They did have good stretch and I was able to get them on with a lot of pulling.  I like to be able to step in and pull up, so tug and tug to get them up. Length was good I'm 5.5ft."
3.0,Not the quality I had expected. Pretty color.<br />On the small side.  White elastic shows on the red glove
3.0,Nice bikini but it's too small. Had to return it.
3.0,They fit as expected but slid down as I walked.
3.0,I returned this. Fabric was very thin and it was cheaply made.
3.0,"Some of the sequins were already missing and they kept catching on each other, but needed it for wedding next day so it worked."
3.0,"I like the 90 degree brand but these don't stay up on my waist! they constantly fall down, but I do like the fabric and the hold."
3.0,It just really didn't look good enough to be given to anyone other than a child
3.0,"The initial letter of the key chain is very small (see attached pictures) Other than the size, the letter looks pretty decent."
3.0,"Love the idea, but the face of the moon is designed to show a sharp edge, and it's rough so you lose that silvery shine.  That takes away from what would have been a great piece."
3.0,Good and cheap pants. I use them when I travel for work which usually means I get dirty and need all the pockets and rings too. I especially like the ring by the belt loop for clipping my camera to. The pants are lightweight so that is another travel plus. My issue though is with the button to close the pants. They are the old style snap buttons and didn't snap when I first tried. Next I tried hammering on it to help widen the female end but the button unfastens easy now. No happy medium so I just wear a belt all the time to keep the pants from popping open. Also luckily there is an interior sewn on style button to help.
3.0,Not warm at all and not sure about the waterproof claim. I have only been about to wear them outside for a short period of time outside so could only really use them for driving.
3.0,Good price for quantity but some of them have imprint defects.
3.0,I love the fit of these leggings. I am 5’5 160lbs athletic build and the medium fits great. The pocket is awesome and they are squat proof. The issue that I am having with these leggings is that the color bleeds and stains my legs even after washing the leggings.
3.0,"The fabric is kind of stiff and very wrinkly--it will surely require serious ironing, so likely won't get too much wear here."
3.0,My usual XL is too big.  For the price I MIGHT reorder in a medium. It has to be fitted or it won’t look right. It will droop on the sides. Keep your bra size in mind.
3.0,I normally wear an extra large or large in women’s gloves. I ordered a large and they were huge! I liked the color and outer feel of the gloves so I ordered the medium they to were too big. No small available. So disappointed in the sizing but must say the gloves themselves are nice and feel as though they will be warm. Definitely a man’s glove.
3.0,"The flower patches aren't placed very well. The back is a little awkward as well, but it's still pretty cute"
3.0,Just didn’t fit and was slightly see through. Should’ve sized up.
3.0,The look; the fit
3.0,Watch band seems well made. Only wore it once.  Very comfortable.  Disappointed it is only 21mm wide versus advertised 22mm thus leaving a gap when installed and exposing the pins.
3.0,I will say the pendant part is nice
3.0,My daughter loved these shoes when we got them. It's not easy to get to the charger port. They stopped working in 3 weeks.
3.0,Great product.  Size run a little on the big side.
3.0,I love them go a size up they are so cute
3.0,Very small earrings!
3.0,cool hat but the brim was smaller than average hats
3.0,Not happy with lack of firm waste band.  Tends to roll down
3.0,Socks were not the best quality and didn't last through too many washes.
3.0,Although handling and shipping was excellent the product was Not what was expected..
3.0,"The material is of great quality but the sizing is very off. The arms were tight and the back couldn't event zip closed so maybe if I would order this again, I would go up two sizes"
3.0,Very pretty ring.  Should make in half size.
3.0,Just okay the fit was kind of award. The belt was cheaply made
3.0,"This is a really nice blouse.  I really love how the material feels and it has pockets!!  However, it is not true to size.  I've ordered clothes online before and I always tend to order tops 2-3 sizes higher than what I really wear.  I ordered a 2X (I wear 16-18) and it still was really tight.  Otherwise, it is a great blouse."
3.0,"I bought these explicitly because there were multiple reviews talking about how long the pants were.  I'm 5'10"" and they might have worked with flats.  There is no zipper, it's an elastic waistband.  The pants are  much baggier than the photo suggests.  Think palazzo pants.  They are embroidered and the design is pleasing, but the colors are muted and the embroidery is spare.  The absolute deal breaker though was the rise was much too short.  The waistband did not reach my waist and I normally don't have issues in that area with pants that are not a tall size.  Even had they fit properly, I don't think the price is justified."
3.0,"This dress was pretty, with bright colors. It fits true to size. I ordered this dress after I purchased 2 other tank type dresses. I did not like the shiny material. It would snag easily and it tends to hold in the heat."
3.0,"Beautiful leather handbag, better than what I've found in stores for this price range. The only issue I had was with the zipper in the middle which I fixed myself."
3.0,Glassed very clear and fit nice.  I assumed when they said XL they meant field of view.  My bad. These are NOT large lenses but they do fit my 7 5/8 noggin very well! Guess that's what the meant by XL!
3.0,"I had to give 3 stars because I did not get the dress in the picture! The dress they sent is super cute. I love it , it’s just not the one in the picture . I liked that one because it was more of a Christmas theme with the deers. But, I love the one I have for my baby."
3.0,"I guess this was supposed to be a choker but I like my necklaces to hang a little lower (as pictured) so I got a similar bracelet to add to the 14"" length. I love the chain but it's a bit substantial for the small heart pendant. The lobster claw is small and delicate for the size of the necklace links and it was hard to clasp."
3.0,Wife really likes this purse and the only complaint is that it tore after 6 months of use. No my wife isnt hard on purses and she doesnt stuff them either.
3.0,"The outfit is pretty cute however the screen printing is cheap. The wording comes too low so part is hidden by the pants. Mostly, I was disappointed by the quality of the screen printing. In several spots the lettering was not heavy enough so the red is still visible."
3.0,"If your more of a heavy chested woman I could see this fitting great. The material was nice although a little see through at the bottom, you would want to wear tights underneath it. Ended up giving to my friend."
3.0,"Fits well but a little on the smaller side, not oversized as I was expecting (I even sized up). It’s a good product but the material is a little on the cheap side, if it was $10 cheaper I’d be okay with it but it’s a little too expensive for the quality."
3.0,"It’s cute, but the fabric is not very soft."
3.0,Super cute but hard to put in
3.0,Runs big. Nice heavy t-shirt material. Lace is only on the front.
3.0,I did not receive these plaid leggings.  I received a pair of brown hued leggings with horizontal designs.
3.0,These are super flimsy and cheap. But ok for the price I guess. I wouldn’t buy them again though.
3.0,"If I paid closer attention to the photos, I would have realized this... but the shorts are pretty short. I’m not a short shorts kind of person, so I gave them to my father. Easier than returning."
3.0,Not all fabric wandering  how it will hold up in the wash
3.0,"Although the dress looked cute, I did not like the material.  I returned the dress."
3.0,It's a very soft nice shirt but it fits tight on my son.. It doesn't fit like a size 12 should..
3.0,"Nice shirt, but sleeves are too skinny for a size Large.  Either that, or my upper arms are too fat - and I don't want to think that's the case."
3.0,Cute style. Runs super small. I ordered 2T for my baby who wears 9-12 months figuring she would grow into it. It just fits her now. I also had to rip out the zipper at the bottom. I put my hand inside to feel it and it is super scratchy and seems like it would be super uncomfortable for the baby. I replaced the zipper with buttons. I recommend changing the zipper and going 2-3 sizes up.
3.0,"For the most part, great quality. My only issue is the white band inseam of the skirt is a little ruffled. Not providing that flawless seamless look around the stomach area. The arms are SUPER snug and I ordered a Medium. Honestly, though the fabrics good quality did surprise me."
3.0,"No pockets, no pee hole, and the lace is for show and doesn’t wrap around the band like it should.<br /><br />If you just want some Star Wars fabric sewn into the shape of pants, then this is your new pair of lounge pants?  If you want any features from the list above, pass.<br /><br />3 stars for Star Wars."
3.0,"Very cute, but a tad snug. I have to lose some weight before I can fit in it. Next time I'll know to order a few sizes larger."
3.0,"As someone who loves high waisted pants— especially for working out— these were disappointing. They were higher in the front than they were in the back and within a minute of virtually no movement, the front rolled down and then the back followed suite. Not ideal for working out."
3.0,Cheap  but cute
3.0,"I usually wear a medium in most things, but I ordered a large that would not zip (fabric has no stretch). I just ordered an X-Large so hopefully that will fit."
3.0,"Awkward fit and has the material of a beach cover up, not a quality dress. Not terrible, just not the same look as the picture. My normal size is a size small and it felt big in the chest area (if you turn the wrong direction it’ll show your bra) and it felt like it hugged a weird spot around my waist making me look bigger than I am."
3.0,"It’s a pretty dress, just have to make some adjustment so I will<br />Not look like I’m pregnant,<br />Lol!"
3.0,"These harem pants are thin and not as baggy as advertised. I ordered my daughter’s size and these are not long enough, but the waist is huge…and do not stay in place. She’s actually wearing them lower on her waist, so I could get a better picture. I expected true harem style like most adult ones. Not a great purchase if you’re expecting a particular look."
3.0,It is a good quality material not see through however im 5&#34;7 and its wayyy to short to be a dress but to long to be a tunic...
3.0,"I have a similar skirt that I wear all the time and wanted a different color. That one is a faux wrap, with a zipper in the back. This item’s photos show a zipper on on the back, which is why I bought it, but there is no zipper. It’s a true wrap skirt. It’s cute, and I’ll keep it, but I feel mislead by the seller, which is why I’m giving 3 stars. It’s probably 4 star worthy if you know what you’re getting…"
3.0,Why not taking time to pack something good? The sneakers arrived like a truck passed on top of them.
3.0,"The fabric is not too thin, 100% cotton. Nice patterns. They are smaller than the typical bandana. If you intend to use as a bandana, they could be to small."
3.0,Hope it’s longer little bit
3.0,"I don’t like that the fabric  magnets all the dust, hair and fur."
3.0,This product already shows signs of tearing after just 4 weeks of using.
3.0,Quick delivery and they are good looking but I just didn't like them for me. Will be returning.
3.0,"-If your slim, the strap will be too long.<br />-The zipper will flip all the time making it hard to grab (unless you take a minute to flip it back- not easy or subtle)<br />-still gets wet"
3.0,"Looks nice but runs small height wise, which makes it look very awkward."
3.0,"I love the keyboard, but these palm rests are so big that they interfere with my ability to type. I press the space bar by sliding my right thumb down off the bottom of the button in between n and m. this pad prevents my thumb from sliding off the button and I experience considerable resistance while typing.<br />For most people, this is probably a fine pad, but I would like premium pads that are integrated in to the palm rests."
3.0,"Material is flimsy, not well made"
3.0,"This top runs small so I sized up one size and it fits.  However, the fit is somewhat unflattering - I can't pinpoint exactly why, but the top and bottom are a little more fitted with the middle being loose so it hangs funny.  The neckline sits very hit which I didn't expect. There is a seam down the back and the flowers do not line up AT ALL.  Looks cheap from the back; however, it is cheap so what can I say?  It's ok, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
3.0,"This dress if really pretty but if you have a large chest like me (36DDD), you will need to order a size up in the dress. I am about 165lbs, 5'1. I order a size 12 but a 14 would have been better and then just have it altered in the waist."
3.0,"These are cute and I love the pockets, something many maternity leggings are missing. But I am constantly hiking them up. The black pair fits perfectly, but the blue is constantly sliding down."
3.0,"The watch feels sturdy and fits well, but I ran into a few issues that were not expected. First, the hour hand and the minute hand were not in sync. For example, I could not set the watch to exactly 12:00. If the hour hand is directly over the 12:00 mark, then the minute hand is 5+ minutes off. Secondly, with the dial being on the right side of the watch, it seems to be designed to be worn on the right hand. I, being right handed, tried wearing it on my left wrist, but the dial kept irritating the back of my hand and would often change the time as well. Its a really good looking watch, but it's nothing more than that."
3.0,Return them.to small
3.0,"I bought a 3x and it is a bit snug on me.  It works for what I need it for, as an undershirt, but is not something I would be comfortable wearing in public as my only top.  That is probably due to my size and shape as I have large breasts and a belly."
3.0,"The dress appeared to be well made, but the size M did not fit.  I normally wear a size 8 in women's clothing, however, this dress would not meet in the middle and I had to send it back.  Also, about the material, it is most definitely a polyester.  The material had a very slick feel to it.  The pattern was very pretty and the color was true to the description.  If you plan on ordering, order up a size or two."
3.0,This is a mans hat - not women's<br />Quality is ok
3.0,After 2 wash shrink. And the waistband is 1 inch elastic and digs in and flips inside
3.0,"gave them to my sister as too small for me, she likes them"
3.0,"I wear medium so they must run big but i bought 2 other dresses in medium too from the same make and it fit fine, I am so cufused lol"
3.0,"This mask looks like a bra, and with those 2 fittings you look like a crow. Im not in love with it because those fittings for the filter gotta be very tight if you dont want to lose them. I do like that has a strap around the neck and mask is not tight on your face.  Even though you can’t adjust the ear straps it is comfortable not too loose not too tight."
3.0,These are super cute but beware they fall out easily.
3.0,"I am disappointed as this shirt appears to be a bright yellow on Amazon, however when received in person it appears that it is more brownish yellow, not bright like you would expect."
3.0,"Material is super light. I got a med and it's little big in bust, waist area. The sleeves are attached and very puffy, the elastic isn't tight on arms so that's good. The flower design is a decal and the neckline is crochet.  It has pockets!!! I rated 3 because the price. This isn't worth almost $50. If it were made out of a heavier material like cotton and had Embroidery design with more detail than it would be worth the price. Will have to be careful because the way it was sewn in the back seam design part, it isn't sewn close enough and will easily come apart. Apron is cute and light."
3.0,"This product would be 5 stars if the cap portion of the hat was more sturdy. When it says extra wide brim, it definitely is.  If you want a lot of sun protection, you get it with this hat"
3.0,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas along with the costume, wig and some other items - she loved all of it. The wand itself is kind of cheap, but she loves it anyhow."
3.0,"cute, but you can definitely see through the white one. also, the neck isn’t taught, it sags, which makes it look ill fitting/cheap<br />I imagine someone who has sewing skills could add a snap on the neck to make it look better but as-is you will constantly be pulling this up"
3.0,Fit well and looked great to start. They pulled up quickly. These were used for a costume so it was fine for our purposes but otherwise would not be happy.
3.0,too sheer - white leggings
3.0,"I like these but the posts are way to long and they stab the back of your ear when you lay down,.. so cute but not real comfy honestly. Do not recommend napping with them in."
3.0,Shirt fits fine but the skirt is huge
3.0,I have multiple Champion Vapor shirts both long and short sleeve.  They are great because they are breathable and perfect for any exercising or sweat producing activity.  The drawback with this one is that it has a pattern that you can feel in the material.  Also the pattern is pretty odd looking.  If you can get a good deal on it then it is worth it.  Otherwise go for the plain material.
3.0,"1 of the 3 tops in my pack unraveled in the first wash.  I thought the seam came out, but upon further investigation, it was just not sewn properly and the edge of the exposed material, outside the seam, it unraveled and then wrapped around various other clothing being washed.  Was a real pain.  Nearly returned the whole lot over this.  I have these laundry protectors, that zip, so started using these to protect the rest of my laundry."
3.0,"Cute but too big, they sent the wrong size. I'm glad she can grow into them but wanted her to wear them soon."
3.0,The material doesn’t stretch if you have hips don’t buy medium get larger
3.0,I gave it three stars because it did shrink alot when washed!!
3.0,Super Small
3.0,I had such high hopes. Fabric was weird and the belt wasn’t attached. Ran small. Returned the item.
3.0,Felt cheap and id saying the color was off from the picture
3.0,"At first when I took them out of the package, it looked like a little kid had taken scissors to nylons. After I started putting them on they looked nice though. Be aware though, they are nylon and stretch so part of these can get worn out fast. However, for 5 stockings this was a good package deal so I kept the 2 I liked the most then regifted the other 3. They are really comfortable to wear and fit me! (short curvy woman)"
3.0,"Works O.K., maybe a little better than the others I have tried....unless you happen to sneeze or are breathing hard...seems to be most effective when applied 3x before going out.  I will shop around for competing products next Winter."
3.0,Fit as expected except the cut out for the arms was a little small and the neck was pretty high. Only wore once.
3.0,Ok i will get more
3.0,"Mealiya creates some sexy outfits. They are smaller than normal U.S. clothing, however. Make sure you check the sizing chart or you will not have that sexy look you want when you are out clubbing or at a pool party. The sheerness is lovely."
3.0,"It's ok, doesn't look quite as nice in person as on line"
3.0,I bought this for my LV Berri MM but it was too wide for the bag. It made it look bulky and made the bag not keep it’s loose relax shape.  I should have bought a smaller size.  Definitely love the pockets and the inside of the organizer.
3.0,"Initially worked very well.  The back clips only lasted a month though.  Now, it’s mostly useless.  If you buy this, also buy repair pins and clips.  The fabric is comfortable and will last a long time.  Overall not bad, but probably not a good but unless you are willing to repair it yourself."
3.0,I don't know if i should give a 2 star review or a 3 star... but the charm almost does not fit my pandora bracelet. it went on okay but not smooth. and  it's very hard to smoothly take it off the bracelet. So i ended up not using this charm. I really wanted to like it. I think i should contact the seller about this.
3.0,Quality of the product is average for the price.
3.0,Cute and served its purpose.
3.0,"Like them, but cheap plastic. they got stuck on my ear and had to cut them off."
3.0,"These are really really tiny.  However, they look lovely in my second hole with my new very short hair cut.  They are so small however, I thought they might go completely through the hole-they didn't.  I also almost lost it when taking it out.  I think the quality is good so I may order a larger pair."
3.0,The color of the metal on these earrings is not rose gold-as advertised.  However the earrings themselves are very pretty.  Can't wait to wear them!!
3.0,"I ordered this suit for an upcoming trip, it's so cute was excited to be able to wear it. It arrives and its almost a size too small. Bummed. Otherwise the suit seems to be well crafted."
3.0,The faux diamonds around the colored baguettes look to cheap and fake. The colored baguettes look elegant
3.0,"Looks nice, but is very easily broken."
3.0,Queda muy apegada pero de largo está bien
3.0,Very short. Lace on the top and back fits a bit weird. The arm holes were too tight. Not very good for big bust.
3.0,"Provider called saying he could not supply the exact product shown. Described the new model, wich had bronze lettering instead of the silver shown. Agreed to have it sent in replacement to the one I had ordered. Watch is oK but the color doesn't really fit with the casing. Too bad because its a gorgueus watch. It would be better to have the casing and internal writting the same color (for my tast). Presently trying to get a jeweler to electroplate silver on the letters (been told it can be done).<br /><br />I have another watch for Adee Kaye and it is a wonderfull piece."
3.0,"I've had a slightly mixed experience with this product. It is very comfortable except for the band going over my ears, but I haven't found a brand that won't do that. The eye parts are extremely comfortable and are convex to give plenty of room for the eyelids and lashes. I love the material and so does my wife.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the inner lining comes away from the foam in the middle. The seam starts to pull off on the nose area and then continues on around the rest. It started after only a few weeks of using them on both pairs. I contacted the seller who promptly sent us a replacement pair, no questions asked. But that pair did the same thing. So I contacted the seller again, and they gladly refunded the purchase price.<br /><br />Now, we've still been using the eyemasks and are comfortable in them. My wife just pulled the whole inner lining off hers and is fine with the foam on her skin. I'm still using mine with the inner lining partially attached, but I don't notice it much when it's on.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied since the seller very easily rectified as much as they could. But I do think the product can be manufactured better. I'd definitely purchase a new model if TravelSnugs comes out with one."
3.0,"odd fit. short not long sleeved but not 3/4..odd<br />pockets are decorative (knew that from reviews).  collar looks ok, if you don't fold it over. folded has a weird looking seam & doesn't look good.  I don't care for this at all. will probably donate."
3.0,Arms are tight. Otherwise comfortable.
3.0,I like them but bulky. Good to keep your glasses safe for sure.1 of mine was stitched wrong and doesn't like to unzip though.
3.0,Much thinner than I expected and doesn't fit snug. Doesn't seem very protective. Probably going to return
3.0,"i’m 5’8 and typically wear a size s/m, so i initially bought a size m. when i tried it on, the costume fit too awkwardly and the arms did not reach my wrist and the feet didn’t properly stretch all the way down. i ordered a size up and the cosplay still fit horribly length wise, and was way too lose as well. i’ll  just have to cut off the feet part and alter the costume myself."
3.0,Its a beautiful well made belt but the image colors advertised are way off. I received it as a gift as it was on my wish list to match my boots. If it were the color depicted it would have matched much better. The inner leather is closer to the color I wanted even. I may see if I can get someone to stain it closer to the true brown.
3.0,Was not as insulated as expected and was too big for my hands
3.0,The dress is nice but run very very small
3.0,"The tank fits as expected, however, I really wish it had more spandex in it.  It's not as stretchy as the old ones I'm replacing but since those are falling apart from age and wear, this one works for my purposes (wearing underneath a casual top which is too low cut).  It's the length I wanted, which is slightly above the waist, so it doesn't hang down below my other top."
3.0,"It is a beautiful color!  I wish it was a better quality purchase and was more akin to the advertisement.  You can see straight through it...and it was too short for me.  Afterall, it is a maxi dress."
3.0,So let me begin by saying I LOVE THIS THING! It's the perfect fit for a lazy day or a dressier look too! That being said... mine came with a hole in the sleeve. It is an incredibly thin and loose stitch so I'm guessing this wasn't hard to accomplish during packaging.
3.0,Material is light and comfortable but go a size down than you would normal get
3.0,Not as pretty in person. you get what you pay for. Ok for costume jewelry...but don't buy as an everyday wear.
3.0,"Seeing as how the covers could be folded away, either on the inside or outside, I was hoping this could be something I could continue to wear inside, but it's too poofy and big to be casual enough to continue wearing indoors. I assume most people won't want to wear it indoors so that won't be an issue for them, but it is for me.<br /><br />It looks and feels really decent and kept my head and ears plenty warm, but the winters in Florida aren't that extreme anyways."
3.0,Fit was a little odd and larger than expected.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d8133b99612ab748dd2177818bd9c7b]] The cut of the dress is flattering.  It is not a true wrap dress — the tie part is only decorative. Hence, you need to nail the sizing because you can’t cinch the waist in with the tie.  I’m 5’5” and 150 pounds. The medium fit with (maybe too much) room to spare at the waist. The black fabric is polyester — the shiny, stretchy kind.  From the photos/video, you can see it holds wrinkles."
3.0,I wouldn't recommend these for kiddos with wide feet
3.0,"It won't work well for someone who is an A cup. Cute swimsuit, but wish bra cups were adjustable or padding removable. Good price."
3.0,teeny tiny- really not a lot of visual impact
3.0,"Very nice but had to get real raybans, good fakes but too dark for driving, would be goid for men too big for a woman's average to smaller head. Size does matter. Lol"
3.0,Love the shirt but I have to send it back. I’m a large and the XL was really small.  If you’re a petite person you can wear one of these tho!
3.0,"Was looking for crisp starts, this pattern was a bit more like watercolor"
3.0,"Not a bad pack. Seems to be made well, it was just too small for what I needed. It doesn't really fit me that well either. Otherwise, not a bad choice and my results may not reflect yours."
3.0,"Overall I was satisfied,  but it came slightly smaller than expected."
3.0,"After wearing it a while, it started to pill due to it being completely synthetic. Also straight out of the bag it was static cling central. Admittedly I don’t shave above my knee so if y’all do you might not have as big a problem with that. Otherwise it’s very comfortable and makes for a great house lounging dress."
3.0,Broke easily..not really kid durable
3.0,"slight defect on the prong of earring but still wearable, still ok"
3.0,Hat is adorable but fits small. My son is 3 and quite fine boned (does not have a large head) and hat barely fits.  Seems better for 1 or 2 year old. My boy loves it though so I won't be returning it.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:4a4d93be686bd0571a243ae03a780f29]] They are super cute but I got thiccc legs and they roll down sooooooo bad. Get garters. (I’m looking at some on here that are faux leather with heart shaped o rings and studs. 🥰)
3.0,little snug in the toe box -- usually th have plenty of room -- hoping they stretch
3.0,Adidas Originals Women's 3 Stripes Skirt-Panton/Black-XL . Skirt-Pantalon ????? This is just a skirt. How about pantalon ??I ordered it thinking it is a pantalon under the skirt but NO! It is a simple skirt.
3.0,"Not bad quality for the price. Bill doesn't keep shape though, and it's a bit bigger than normal."
3.0,"Pants are cool, I’d buy again. They’re not great quality, they fade after you wash them. But they’re good. The cotton gets those little cheap balls on them you have to pull off. I’d say they’re overpriced for the quality."
3.0,"The size was right and the length was good, but these had a strange fit.  They sort of pooched out in front below the waistband instead of being snug against the lower belly.  I though it looked weird to have that loose fabric there, so I returned these."
3.0,"Decent shirt, nothing more.  The material seems a little flimsy, like a cheap undershirt.  And the V-neck opening is quite large, leaving a lot of bare chest showing.  The shirt actually fits very well, but these flaws definitely prevent me from buying another.  A shame, too, since I like the fit and the color."
3.0,"I wear an XL in leggings however these felt a little but too small for me.. luckily they're leggings so they stretch. But it's not very comfortable. A size up would've been nice. Also I can't pull them up over my belly button. They aren't long enough. And I'm only 5'3.. if I force pull them up I get camel toe lmao. I know you wanna look as cute as dva but for us plus size girls, I highly recommend you avoid these.  Sorry ladies :c"
3.0,"Cute, but very small charms.  The do not fit over the clasp of most chains.  I needed to use jewelry pliers to attach to the necklace."
3.0,"This top is nice but it did not fit me like it did the model in the picture.  It is shorter, the sleeves are shorter, and it was smaller than expected.  I am donating it.  This is OK for someone else."
3.0,"Very cute outfit with vibrant colors. However it is so big. My daughter is on the tail end of 18-24 month clothing and this was pretty big, will have to wait to use it. I was excited to have her wear it for a trip, but maybe next time. I would prefer a size down."
3.0,"Doesn't really have any shape to it and I found that the dress length was much too long for the size I purchased.  The dress definitely looks cheaply-made, but you definitely get what you pay for."
3.0,Cute charm but it's top heavy so it always flips up side down.
3.0,Whereas this bag has nice designs and colours...I found the zips were not as durable and did not last very long.
3.0,It’s super thin and isn’t really off shoulder. Gives more librarian look than anything. But it’s still something I’ll keep in the closet
3.0,Part of this is totally on me. I had searched for flannel shirts and expected that's what I ordered. Probably should have read the fabric description a little closer. The sizing is small. I normally wear a medium and ordered a Large. The large is still tight in my arms- not usually something I have trouble with.
3.0,"It was very cute. I'm a size 7-9 in bottoms and M-L in tops. The bottoms fit but the top was way too small for my chest size. I'm a 38C and I could wear it, but not comfortably."
3.0,I normally wear xl. I ordered 3x and fit
3.0,"If you are short (I'm 5'1"") they will need to be hemmed unless you want to roll them.  Other than that, super cute look."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8c3b3529103d2de98b6804c990c9edf0]] Love shoes so at this price j expected quality and not  for the buckle to look glued underneath. Nice concept, pretty shoe, orange bottom is slick and not constructed well underneath with slight imperfections. The shoe size is shown on the bottom in white if you're okay with that. Way Overpriced-"
3.0,Not for wearing for long periods of time standing or walking.
3.0,It was alright. The gem in the middle was a little bigger than expected and fell out after a month of wearing it.
3.0,"Nice quality for the price, but the sizes were different. Two pairs fit (women’s size 8.5), but the other four pairs were really large."
3.0,The cost of this offering included 12 pieces which would have been a bargain as I’d just returned from Paris in 2019 and knew what I’d paid for 1 Eiffel Tower replica that I’d given to my granddaughter.  She attached it to her keychain but it fell off and was lost.  She wanted a replacement and although I only needed one I bought the 12 piece package because it was cheap enough.  When only one piece arrived I kept it and replaced her lost one and just ‘wrote off’ the cost of the fraud in the advertisement.  So just beware of the situation.
3.0,"This dress is very pretty, however I did have two issues. One, the Small was loose enough to be a bit gappy in the back, so I had to have it altered.  The second issue is that it is a cheaply made dress with no lining, and there are very large scratchy seams in the middle of the dress.  They stand out and are very uncomfortable.  If I had thought of it, I would have had fabric put in over top when I got the dress altered.  I guess you get what you pay for, so I can't complain too much considering the price, and I did receive compliments.  The style is very flattering. I would recommend the use of bra tape for the open back."
3.0,Runs a bit large in the sides. But otherwise it is super cute!
3.0,works ok but to small
3.0,A bit to snug
3.0,Best thing about this is the packaging....otherwise a pedestrian product
3.0,"I'm a big fan of Cadillac leather lotion, and had high hopes for these at this price. They do work pretty well, but their lifespan seems less than other brands where you can see some liquid in a window. With those, it also seems that pressing down on the sponge allows some additional liquid to flow onto the shoe when you want- doesn't seem to be the case with these. They indicate 60 uses per sponge, which is great, and the price is right, but not my favorite in this catagory."
3.0,"They are giant and are good for the price, but they are very cheap looking in person. I'll only use them for the pool, never to actually go out in."
3.0,"Hubby likes it for the price, But it took way too long to finally arrive!"
3.0,I loved the look & feel of band. But it caught & snagged certain fabrics.
3.0,Not as cute as the picture and way too small to see the actual studs unless someone gets really close to you. More dull in person. Returned and sticking with plain gold bar earrings
3.0,"Glasses are fine, however I ordered them to fit over my dad's Rx glasses but they were too small, so they didn't work for what I needed."
3.0,Never used product. Returned.
3.0,"Comfy enough! Disappointed with color, is more mint green than the deeper emeraldy green the pic looks like. The shorts are a bit too short for a larger size. Sized up so is loose enough. And the neckline is higher than in the pic so a little uncomfortable for me. I like a looser neckline. For the price its okay enough overall."
3.0,"must lower cut than I wanted, but overall a good product."
3.0,Starting to fall apart and I've only worn it 6 times. Super cute tho!
3.0,I was looking for an inexpensive sports bra for aerobics. This isn't a bad option
3.0,I really wanted to love this bag!! It was a great dupe to a lot of designer bags!! But after wearing it a few things I’ve noticed is it’s a very flimsy bag. The chain isn’t sturdy and the hooks on the bag that hold chain are like plastic!! Under the quilting feels like thin cardboard!! I’m going to carry it for now but if I don’t find something soon to replace it I’m sure it will break on me!! Not worth $30+ dollars
3.0,"I really thought these would be great. I was looking for socks I could slide on after moisturizing my feet and heels at night. I specifically got these because they didn't have toes. They are MUCH thicker than I expected or wanted, essentially like tube socks without the toes. They come up higher on your leg, too, and are very tight, even in my narrow feet. I really can't see these being useful for much, honestly. I kept them for winter use, but don't recommend."
3.0,Fits nice but It’s a little longer than I would have liked. I’m 5’3” and ordered a small.
3.0,Wore three times before holes started to form.
3.0,"I bought this for work since I work out in the hot sun on boats. As a 5'3"" tall woman with a bust between B and C, the sizing was not great. If you've ever bought clothing on here that's from China and you can tell it's sized more for a slender, not curvy figure, then you know what I'm talking about. The length is quite long for what's needed, and the buttons feel like they will pop off around my chest area."
3.0,Excellany
3.0,Probably will not use it a lot.
3.0,Product was nice but way too small.  Looked like a little kid shirt
3.0,Nice sweatshirt a bit small
3.0,Good price for the wallet.  A little hard to get cards out without messing all them up. Wish it had a clip instead of elastic strap.
3.0,"Based on all the reviews, I ordered 1/2 size larger.  It is a little big, but if I ordered my true size it would have been too tight.  With 1/2 size larger, the front was still very tight, due to the padding.  The upper leather is hard and hurts after a day at the office.  Overall, the shoe is okay.  There just isn't a lot of black pumps out there, so I'll keep this one."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:8307d3363a52198a0f831dc12e3b1597]] Way to big for a mans pocket
3.0,I have not used yet. I'm somewhat disappointed that it's not copper infused and not just the color of copper woven throughout the fabric. Your description and ad is somewhat misleading. Thus only 3 stars
3.0,Really cute but it's soooo heavy to wear. I wasn't expecting it to be quite so big.
3.0,"This shirt is super cheaply made. Beware it has a band of material at the bottom that's cut small, you cannot see this band in the pictures."
3.0,"Ran extremely small and was extremely see-through. Gave it to a friend who thought it was okay, but seemed pretty cheaply made."
3.0,"it is definitely on the heavy side for handbags.  I think it looks much better online than in person.  The handles are a bit small for my taste.  I'm sorry, but i'm returning it."
3.0,It was disappointing to me.  Perhaps it is the Color Combination???  I love Pink but it doesn't go with the trim color of the watch.  My Opinion!
3.0,Gave to my granddaughter she wears them all the time.
3.0,Seems cheap. Shirring in back is uneven. Material is very thin.
3.0,"Fitting to the text on the face of it, this watch has been stopping and starting since I received it, so it does not tell time consistently. What can one expect for under $10?"
3.0,Can tell its cheapish. Looks like picture.
3.0,"Over priced for what it was, you can go get one at TJ Maxx for 2.50! Thought it would be a littler thicker and be more substantial."
3.0,"Beautiful purple color, soft & fluffy, but fabric was a little too lightweight for me, I didn't feel it would keep me warm enough, I returned it."
3.0,"Too much of a cat eye for me. If you like the very high points, they'll be really cute. I'll be returning mine. See picture"
3.0,"The zipper was messed up when we tried on this dress on her for the first time right before her B’day party. Toddler was very upset she could not wear it. Only reason I did not give it a lower star is that it is a beautiful dress. Also, she just started wearing 2t’s & it was too snug at her waist."
3.0,When order said will be delivered by 12/24 was a Christmas gift for my daughters and at this time the package is no where to be found just got an update saying might be here by 12/28<br /><br />The item did come was Perfect and what I expected but not happy with the late delivery as mentioned was Christmas gift for my kids
3.0,The bag has a very weird smell that I certainly hope dissapates with time. It is a bit large. It has a very flimsy feel and does not hold its shape.
3.0,"I am a flight attendant. This was the perfect bag for work and travel. Plenty of compartment and storage. My only problem is 4 months into having it, it began tearing apart. But if the durability was better, it would have been the best bag."
3.0,"most  beautiful &#34;ice queen&#34; dress that I could find- very nice fabric in person, size 110 fits seems to be a true 4T. The sleeves are beautiful and train is gorgeous also although a pain when out of the house because my daughter has to carry it so it doesn't get dirty. I braided her hair to the side and she really looked like Elsa walking around the house. 3 stars because the fabric frayed on the front waist seam after one wear- not sure if the fabric tore or it was poor construction- easily fixed by machine but annoying"
3.0,"Very pretty, but one kept falling off every time I wore it."
3.0,"To all of my fellow stubborn snorers, DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO REPLACE THE NEED FOR A SLEEP STUDY. If you have sleep apnea, you must have a sleep study and have it treated by a doctor. Yes, it may keep you from snoring, but it won't keep you from having a heart attack from not being treated properly. Now for my review.<br /><br />I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine. Lately, I have noticed my mouth and throat were extremely dry when I awoke. That was due to my mouth opening while I slept and the CPAP was running. I pulled out an old chin strap and fixed the problem but I wanted something that fit better.<br /><br />This item fit a bit too snugly. My head is not abnormally big (please don't ask my wife about this) and I found the strap barely long enough to secure the velcro without having it uncomfortably tight. I used it in connection with my CPAP and it seems to slip slightly but it did its job all night and never came off.<br /><br />I will use it but continue to look for something a bit longer. It will also be good if I need to take a nap in my chair and don't want to startle others with my snoring. Yes, it can get so loud it wakes ME up.<br /><br />If you are reading this far you must be a snorer. I encourage you to have a sleep study. A CPAP will give you the best nights sleep you can remember and you will have more energy. The newer equipment is small, quiet, and hardly noticeable while you sleep."
3.0,"Took measurements and went by the size-chart provided, however, the chart indicates a larger size than my typical size. Not knowing for sure the origin of the product I went with the suggested size. It fits a little large at the torso. Other than that the quality is good and the dress itself is beautiful."
3.0,Not fun can only hold two games. Love the changes for lol dolls but she was bored next day
3.0,I have been waiting for you to refund the purchase price to my credit card that was used to purchase this item; instead you have indicated that you set up a gift card for me. I did not use a gift card to buy this and I do not want a gift card now since it has been returned. I would not have needed to return it except it came apart when I tried to open it. Please refund my money to the credit card used for this purchase.<br />Thank you.<br /><br />Cee McAdams
3.0,The color is not the same as it is in person it’s not like that type of punk/purple in person it’s more of a magenta color like but still cute. Fits very well. A little flare in the front<br />Dislike: it doesn’t cover your tummy it’s not a crop though for big girls like myself if you want to cover your belly a little this isn’t it but if you don’t mind it a little buy if<br /><br />I’m a 40DDD 14/16 I got an XL fits pretty decent.<br />I would recommend it :)
3.0,Material isn’t what I expected but the shirt is still nice
3.0,Pretty. I ordered a 9 but it fits like an 8. Runs small.
3.0,Era mas ancha de lo que la necesitaba y no explore la opción de la devolución
3.0,The fabric was nice and overall the product was good.  The listed size must refer to oriental where the shorts were manufactured!
3.0,Looks great but gets scratched easily and runs a little too big
3.0,"haaa, it's pretty short on me"
3.0,"Is nice, looks good, is plastic and feels cheesy. But good product overall for the price."
3.0,"I bought these for my kids goggles at the lake. I tested them out in the pool and they seemed to work fine but i think the lake water, with its choppiness and the weight of the goggles was too much. They were the face mask type goggles so heavier than sunglasses.<br /><br />These may still work fine for lighter goggles or sunglasses but they don’t work for heavier goggles."
3.0,The neck is way too tight
3.0,"It took about a month to get, it arrived yesterday.  It fits nicely and I am pleased with it.  I ordered a large and it fits nicely.  I am 5', bust 41"", and 150 lb.  Normally wear L or sometimes XL depending on cut.  L was just the right size in this item."
3.0,"I'm currently 21 weeks pregnant and finding a dress that fits good it's a little hard to find especially for a wedding. I'm 5'4, 163 lbs and wear a 36C and decided to get a size medium in royal blue. The dress itself fit beautiful, not see thru at all, covered well in the bust area and made my baby bump look cute. However, when I tried it on, I noticed I tiny rip inside of the dress so I had to return it. I wasn't sure if the dress I got was a return/exchange but I just wasnnot comfortable wearing a dress that had a rip. I'm sure I could've sown  the tiny hole but if I'm paying full price for a dress I want to make sure it has no rips etc. I gave this item 3 stars because the dress is very beautiful, it fit really nice,  the royal blue color stands out beautifully but it's just unfortunate that it had a small rip. If it wasn't for that small rip I would have given it 5 stars. I've attached two pictures. One that shows the tiny hole, and the other to show the color of the dress (I turned on my flash)"
3.0,I liked the pattern and fabric. I ordered a medium which usually fits as depicted on the model. But it was skin tight. I haven’t decided to return or exchange. But at 5’ 8” and 140 lbs this shouldn’t have been that tight :(
3.0,Had to return because it definitely isn't made for wide feet. Bought the unisex ones and they were perfect. If I had narrow feet then these would have been perfect they were very cute.
3.0,Pretty but 2 came broken
3.0,"My 8 year old is pretty average sized, active, and athletic.  She wears a size 8 normally.<br /><br />As a burgeoning horror fan and goth leaning, she was excited to get this dress in time for school picture day.  Unfortunately, the elastic waistband is huge.  We had to pin it in a good four inches.  The entire dress is a large compared to her normal 8s, and she'll grow more into it in every way except the huge waistband.<br /><br />So she and I were both a bit disappointed because it's so hard to find an 8 year old nice Wednesday Adams clothing."
3.0,"Average quality and a bit smaller than I expected, but reasonable priced"
3.0,These ran a bit large.
3.0,"Super cute, but started pealing slightly after only having it for a month with my keys. I don't recommend you put it with your house/car keys, because it will probably/scratch away the picture."
3.0,"Love the look, chain stays tight but the finish tarnished after 2 wears. Cute for an event but not practical for daily wear! Layered it with a couple other bracelets and was perfect!"
3.0,I bought these in January and used them during the cold winter months which was through March and started using them again this November and started feeling something inside the right insole. Pulled it out and it’s got a hole in the fabric which is synthetic. If the inside was a wool or wool blend it would probably last a long time. I wish I could get the insoles replaced. For what these cost they should be better quality as far as the inside. I found a similar slipper that uses a wool blend for the inside at half the price. If Orthofeet replaced the insoles when needed or even during the first year that would be much better.
3.0,Its a pretty thin fabric and you can see through it.  I wish it was a little bit better from a fabric point of view.
3.0,Son loved these but he snapped the arm off already and I can't fix it.
3.0,"This is a real Coach bag, but it's the outlet version of the Edie and not nearly as nice as the retail Edie. This version has no feet on the bottom, does not come with a dust bag, and the leather isn't as yummy. It's a lot less money, though, so it depends on whether the trade-off in quality is worth it to you."
3.0,Way smaller. I usually wear a med and would need an xxl to fit right. So I just wear these as a.pj top now.
3.0,Great watch for the price. Love the design
3.0,"I really, really loved this at first - until I realized that the little strands fall out. All I did was sit at my desk and turn around in my swivel chair a few times...and one of the strands ended up on the floor. I have to constantly adjust them since they get caught on fabric and move around. Also, when I received it, the setting for the crystal was lopsided. I had to bend it to get it to lie flat. It's a really pretty piece, but I'm afraid to move much in it. I give it three stars because it wasn't very expensive, and I'm sure the strands falling out can be fixed with a little ingenuity."
3.0,Makes a great 10 to 15 years gift if they are into Doctor Who.  Even though it is a good time piece can there is no way to keep from depressing the button and setting off the sound.
3.0,Great tote for work
3.0,Doesnt hold a charge very long. Some lights stopped working after light use by a 1 year old.
3.0,"Definitely not water proof, maybe a few drops of rain they can resist. They do run small, about a size and maybe a half I wear a L got a XL they r a bit tight but fit. They are also a bit stiff. Tried them outside it's a out 40° out kept hands. Not for freezing though. Other than that. Good for 7 Bucks."
3.0,"Tossed the earrings and kept the necklace! Fun, but cheap accessory."
3.0,Slightly tight fit. Seems to run small.
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it fits fine in the body but the arms are very tight.  I can only bend my elbow to about 90 degrees.  Unfortunately, the arms are so tight I can't wear it.  My arms are not small but they aren't disproportionate to my body so I'm surprised it didn't work since the body of the shirt fit fine."
3.0,"The storing space is very good, including one pair of shoes, but the handle is not properly tight and twists a little when carrying the backpack on all fours wheels."
3.0,Size chart inaccurate. Runs small but is very cute & soft!
3.0,Very weird fit. Waist was way too large and the space between buttons were too long. Felt like there was too much skin showing in between.
3.0,"I have a big head, size 7-5/8 fitted hat. Was torn between ordering the XL and the XXL. I got the XL and it’s big even for me. I imagine the XXL must be comically huge. We’ll see if a wash & dry shrinks it up a bit, didn’t cost enough for me to bother with a return."
3.0,"I purchased these ponchos for my family, we live in an area that rains pretty regularly  (Washington state). I thought these would come in handy for us, there are some days you just Really don't want to get wet.<br /><br />They will work. They do their job, but they will not last long. The plastic is very thin, and not sturdy. A garbage bag is thicker...<br /><br />I do like these, the kids like that they get their own color, and they are effective. I just wish they had been a little thicker so, we could get more use out if them.<br />One already has a weak area in it... where it did not rip yet, but the plastic has been pulled thin.<br /><br />These would be great for a rainy day, when it is not as often as here. Less rainy states :-)"
3.0,The material and fabric was awesome…. But the length definitely came up short … no pun intended … Lol not a little above the ankles .<br />I’m 5’6
3.0,"It's ok chain is too long constantly in my shoe, i guess you get what you pay for it."
3.0,"way too pink looking through them for my taste, will try a different color"
3.0,"I am 5'1 and its perfect length, BUT way too big in the top area. I have to return or get altered..."
3.0,Fit everywhere but was tight in the arms. Returned it.
3.0,It's ok... I don't like the fabric on the top.
3.0,"These gloves are ok, but not really comfortable and not really durable. They came with a scarf/mask which suddenly with the pandemics became a useful feature."
3.0,"I only wear 100% cotton crew socks.  They are becoming almost impossible to find. These are organic cotton, so I thought that would be a plus.  I found them to be scratchy - not soft and thinner than regular crew socks.  Also the elastic in the top part is tight around the ankle and leg part.  I am a normal weight person.<br /><br />3 stars for 100% organic cotton and a good try"
3.0,Slides off the arm when wet
3.0,"It too big for my taste. I have worn it for two days and it is hazy. I did as suggested and painted it with clear nail polish on the outside, but honestly I think I will carry it with me and not wear it. It's okay looking, but looked better in the picture."
3.0,This dress is super cute but there is a big problem.  The color of the buttons and trim aren't consistent.  The color ranges from maroon/wine color to a bright red.  The images I  added show the difference.  You may not get what you want.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  I have a larger bust area (38H).  I typically wear size 14 or Large but going by the inches for the bust I ordered a 2XL.  It fit but was a little too snug for my tastes so I reordered a 3XL.
3.0,I really liked them but they were too short and small. I wear a 12.
3.0,"I love the fabric, which is soft and light and has a lovely hand.<br /><br />The fit is weird, as others have said. I'm an athletic 5'9""/135 lb, Icebreaker size S stuff normally fits me great, and in this shirt a size S was boxy and hung off me.<br /><br />The color is almost aggressively neutral and bland, fine if you like that sort of thing. But I was disappointed and am returning it."
3.0,"Unlike the cadet-style caps from Goorin Bros. and Outdoor Research that I bought to compare, this model from Stormy Kromer seemed more unisex in its styling, with rounder edges and more volume in the crown. It's a style that many may like. I did not. I returned this and the Goorin Bros. versions (the latter being too light-weight) and kept the Outdoor Research cap."
3.0,Love the blue. A little thinner than I thought. Fair for the price.
3.0,"Genuine leather..questionable..!  Having said that, it feels n smells more like leather than the blk silver punk rock cuff.  More pliable off the rack (on first wear) size the same 1 1/2 in., snaps n stitching, passing.  Again, works for me."
3.0,Got a hole in the toe after one wear.
3.0,I like these but they are not for long term wear as they are painted. Pretty but not super ethical.
3.0,I ordered the small for my 26&#34; waist but it was too big. I like the pattern however so I will adjust the skirt.<br />The skirt also has a sheen to it that cheapens the look of the skirt.
3.0,They are super warm and great price. They just dont stay on like they should they slid off with little to no head movement
3.0,Had to send it back. To big. But beautiful Ring.
3.0,Much shorter than pictures and I'm only five foot.
3.0,It's good for the price but the color of stone is not light blue it's more like royal blue
3.0,"This dress is adorable, but the fabric is very thin and flimsy. I would give it more stars if not for that. Plenty of room in the bust. I ordered medium and it covered my 30K boobs just fine. Just wish it was made of something more durable."
3.0,"I like the socks, but my product did not come when it said. I had to wait an extra 6 days for it. Thank you"
3.0,Bands are nice just too long and they don't stay under the hold down. Worth the money
3.0,"I ordered orange, and the tag on the package says ""Orange,"" but of course they're a bright kelly green.<br /><br />Fit: I wear a men's 13, and these size Medium socks actually fit my foot just fine.  They were just a little too short up the calf, so the L would be the right size for me.  If you've got small feet, think hard about the Small.<br /><br />Comfort.  They stretch well and are not uncomfortable anywhere.  The size M sock on my size L feet and calf is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so; I think the Large would fit very well.<br /><br />Documentation: You get a sticker on the outside of the plastic bag with the item's details, and an insert in the bag saying ""Keep Calm and Play Soccer.""  And they're made in China.  And that's it.  No manufacturer contact info.<br /><br />Price: strangely enough, the green sock in green currently is unavailable, so I can't get it's price.  Other medium socks place this pair at right about $11.  That seems a bit high for me; I was placing these socks in the $8-10 range.<br /><br />Bottom Line: these are okay-fitting athletic field socks--not just soccer.  They seem slightly overpriced.  And be careful what you order as what you may receive be a different size or color."
3.0,"I love the style, but this one came alittle bigger than the one I previously ordered in a different color.<br /><br />Must of been a return...the button that holds the back together is missing.<br /><br />I would exchange it but I’m still contemplating since my trip is next week...."
3.0,Very nice hat but I Returned this one because the front top where the logo are did not lone up with the bill; it was off center and looked stupid.
3.0,Slips off my heel.
3.0,The hole where the ponytail goes is quickly unraveling after 1 week of use.
3.0,It was wide but short wierd sizing. I'm 5'8 and skinny. Would work for shorter people. But super cute.
3.0,"I bought this as part of a costume. It was cheap so I figured we would try it. It fits well and has held up after two washes. The sequins on the top portion fall off and rub my daughter’s arm and irritate her. But, it’s a good buy for a costume."
3.0,Material quality is nice and thick ...love the style and great purchase... but I ordered a large and received xxl.. was very disappointed
3.0,"I am 5’ 4”. Tank gapes in armpit. Guessing it’s made for much taller women. Fabric is is good as is graphic print. Manufacturer in lower left side of tank and size tag in neck are made of, what feels like, stiff paper. They can be ripped out but a portion remains in seam causing skin irritation. I wound up having to take out portion of seam where tag is located on the side and then having to restitch. In my opinion, this makes the tank low value for the money"
3.0,"They work, but they aren't the same size as the more sturdy ones I got direct from the company.  This model doesn't cover the lenses as well as the model which isn't &#34;ultralight&#34;.  Maybe that's one of the reasons they cost less."
3.0,My daughter loved them.  After only wearing them 4 times one of them broke.  She was very bumbed.
3.0,I was not disappointed but I was looking for the one that fit the M65 Field jacket I made a mistake other than that it worked for me in Germany with the Phil Parker
3.0,"Not true size, very narrow"
3.0,"I adore this dress, the print is cute, the quality of the dress is great, the length is good. I just don't like the way the bodice fits on the upper half of my body. I actually had this in a large and bought a medium because I thought it was just because the size I had was too big. The neckline feels like it wants to sit on the edges of my shoulders, but won't stay like that so it sits awkwardly where straps sit. So I wear it with a sweater over the top because it's still a really cute dress!"
3.0,Color is NOT white. It's no where near white. It's extremely dark ivory. Cute shirt but very disappointed it's not white. I had a whole outfit planned around it being white.
3.0,I had bought this cardigan in yellow color. I really loved it. So decided to buy the same in white and black but the size seemed different. And the white one has a kind of bluish tinge to it. It’s not perfectly white.
3.0,Very beautiful but runs very tiny
3.0,"they are alright.  you definitely get what you paid for.  my pair has something on it.  i dont know what it is, but it wont clean off.  but still, they arent all that bad.  just got these so i dont get pissed if i lose them.  my oakley holbrook's on the other hand, i would go crazy if i lost them."
3.0,It’s very cute but not for the curvy women and it’s backless. Definitely cute as a top even though I wore it as a dress. The print disorients after putting on the dress but nonetheless I still have it
3.0,"I bought these because I had been wanting a good pair of fitness shorts, but I didn't want to pay for the Gymshark label. Overall, I like them! They do run a little small, so I would size up. In Gymshark I am a small and most of the smalls fit me well."
3.0,"I thought there were red socks in this package.  To my surprise they were pink. Need to list colors in description. If they did, I missed it."
3.0,"What I like about it:<br /> - the design<br /> -  the size<br /> -  the colors<br />What I don't like about it:<br /> - the smell (which I guess can be fixed by washing it)<br /> - the material/feel to the touch - it reminds me of a table cloth made of synthetic material - rough and not soft<br /> - bag is too small relative to how many times you have to fold it to put it back into the bag<br />Overall - main attraction is the messianic symbolism - if not for that I would pass on this item - that said, I did order another one as a gift but only because of the messianic message of this product"
3.0,"At first I wasn't going to keep them because I thought they wouldn't fit.  Should have gone a half size up.  When I tried it on, I barely got my foot in, but it was in there, so I kept them. Cute shoes though.  I wore them anyway!! :-)"
3.0,"I'm not sure who designed the waist on this, but it is small.  Like I ordered a size larger, and it was still really &#34;snug.&#34;  Its well made, and I love the pockets, but also, it seems much longer in person than on the model (maybe the model is really tall?).  Its a nice skirt though for the price."
3.0,Very hard to get on
3.0,The material was thicker than expected.  Def too hot for Dubai...where it was 104!
3.0,Bought two of these for my wife. Both are tight! I recommend buying at least 1 size larger than you normally do.
3.0,"Well, I like the dress but it requires lots of wearing n stretching as the fabrics oddly thick. Cute style. Warning- w Allegra K I always make sure I get an XL, cuz that will equal a regular american Medium. So to wear this as a dress, grab the XL. Otherwise itll b a shirt! Lol"
3.0,"Practically have to squeeze into them, they have a pretty tight fit, nice socks though"
3.0,Im in my first week and the patteren is wearing off. I have small wrist and the excess band pops out alot and it is really annoying. Ill be getting a metal band that i can set the links on for everday use and keep this band for running only. It is comfortable though.
3.0,I tend to get fog with my surgical mask on
3.0,"Cute socks, but very tight on the foot. They are soft and the patterns are cute, but they are not mostly cotton which would make them more absorbent and less likely to make my feet sweaty. I bought three bundles: one for me and one for my daughters for valentine's day. I think they think they are tight as well."
3.0,"I love this dress, I had one in black and I wanted this color but it came damaged and had to return it."
3.0,The item is good i guess but they are wayyyyyyyyyy smaller than i expected so i'm very sad about that... I live in The Bahamas and have to ship through the Fort Lauderdale so it's not easy or cost effective for me to send it back...
3.0,"The streamers were nice, but the edges are not fused. They shed fine threads and tangle."
3.0,I MUST SAY THESE EARRINGS ARE OK . I WILL GIVE THEM AS A GIFT NOT SOMETHING I WOULD WEAR.
3.0,"Tight fit as expected. 5'2"" got a small.  Sleeves were a little long and werent tight at wrists. I would have kept it and altered the sleeves if the dress wasn't too sheer for me. You can get a slip but that would require a larger size. I didnt want to go through the process and alterations. But really liked the look/sleeves!"
3.0,"Nice quality, size large, except for elastic waist, a bit tight. Despite pull strings it cannot be adjusted."
3.0,"For the price, the watch looks nice for a couple of wears or a night out. It fogs up very easily and once it does it’s impossible to de-fog. I had planned on giving it 2 stars but my husband really liked the band material."
3.0,Two different materials do not seem to work well together?!
3.0,"There are many reviews telling buyers to pick another size, I did not and these are too small.  They run 2 sizes small.  You wear size 34, buy 36's.  Period.  You will like the quality for the price."
3.0,"They are too large for me, however they are fashionable.  They are also a bit tin like, not a nice earring finish.  Disappointed."
3.0,Would be a better buy if pin clasp were stronger. Adding a place to make it a pendant would make this an exceptional buy because the colors are wonderful.
3.0,"I'm 4'11"" and about 100lbs. I ordered the xs/s and these leggings are still way too big and long. I tried them on and had to cuff them and fold the waistband. From behind they looked really good but the tummy and crotch area were super loose. It's a shame they didn't fit because they're super comfy and warm. I think I'll keep them to wear around the house in winter."
3.0,Loved the dress! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the white portion of the dress turned red once it was washed. Still cute however.
3.0,They look small but are true to size.<br />Love that they are truly high waist but they’re not the most comfortable.<br />Not good if you need them for high intensity training or yoga. The best use is only for weight training or just to go out for a walk.
3.0,"Not bad, but strap is way too long. Long enough that it made me not want to wear it. :-("
3.0,The material surrounding the snap closure tears after about a month of use.
3.0,"The bracelet is cute as a button, I thought I had ""average"" sized wrists, but I dont guess I do.. the top of the bracelet would fit a very skinny wrist better. Overall it seems to be good quality."
3.0,Pros: super cute and soft! Ordered 5x and plenty of room<br />Cons: it’s too short! This is easily a 29” in length and this gal is 5’11”<br />I’ll keep it just cause it is cute but I’ll have to wear a long tank underneath
3.0,the picture shows a very flared airy bottom and snug up top but it is very skin tight. its a very stretchy material so it will fit but its not as airy as it appears.<br />oh and the material is very cheap looking the bottoms literally look like they were made of scraps from the nightgown.
3.0,Easier to get keys on and off. My fingernails are much happier!<br /><br />Annoyingly scritchy. My ears are much unhappier.<br /><br />I ended up going back to regular keyrings.
3.0,"This is a little big on me and the fabric is itchy. The inner sides of this keep rolling in on me too. It looks okay if I keep the hood on, but the itchiness is way too much of a bother..It looks alright although you can see some of the material fuzzing out on it? I really like the color of this grey, so it's a shame. I will say it looks pretty but will cost you your comfort. Also size down."
3.0,"Love the colors, but these socks are SUPER thin and one of the socks arrived with a small hole. I suspect, after wearing a few times, the others will follow suit..."
3.0,"I bought the blue in a size small and the bottom (waist) was way too big and looks very unflattering the way it flares out. I'm 5'8 105 lbs with a 26"" waist. This crop top comes down to my natural waist. It is a quite stretchy, thick (durable) material. The blue is true to color and very pretty."
3.0,It's not really made for short girls so be prepared for some drag. I love maxi dresses so I immediately fell in love with the dress. Back is a lot lower since I am a lot smaller. The arms and neckline are fine it's just length was not on my side. I am debating getting it hemmed.<br /><br />Disclaimer I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.
3.0,"I havent worn these yet. Bought them for fishing.  Ordered a size larger than I normally wear 38 and they were really tight in the legs. Once I unzipped the side pockets, the leg area loosened up-zippers go up and down.  Other than that they seem comfortable.  I will update after I test them out."
3.0,"Longer than expected. Fits comfortable, material is soft and not too sheer. It's kind of box shaped, no curves. May reshape after and wash and wear."
3.0,"It was cute, but some of the lines didn't quite line up at the seams, which is a huge no for me. It was a little too tight, too, so it's going back."
3.0,I ordered a U.S. Medium. This seems more like an XLarge!  I most likely will have to take the sides in by 3-4 inches on each side.  I wanted<br />a natural flowing casual dress....NOT a tent!
3.0,"I returned this chain because it was just blah. It wasn't attractive or pretty in any way. Though it was well made. It was on the longer side, which was nice and probably would be perfect for someone else."
3.0,Cute just not very long
3.0,Not as shiny as thought would be
3.0,Shirt shorter than I like. Shorts also shorter than I like. Maybe made for short people.
3.0,It's tight! And I got a M
3.0,Great color. Fits like a large not extra large.
3.0,half sad. not happy I like the color the size and width but it seems that they can be folded easily
3.0,"Just not my style after all. It's very shiny pu leather & the gold chains are bigger than I thought & brassy looking. I got it forcan evening bag, but could not feel dressy with it. It's just not for me. Not my style."
3.0,"Thought this would be a somewhat loose fitting shirt. Seemed to be more of an undershirt when i received it. I can still use it and make it work with certain outfits, just wish it was a looser fit."
3.0,Got for my niece who is really into Dr Who. Item is nice. Detail good. Could have been a little nicer but price is good
3.0,They would have been awesome but they are way to small. I would order two sizes up
3.0,They are easy to use and work as advertised but expensive for what they are.
3.0,"The embroidery that's part of the design is not noticeable on the bracelet... It looks faded. I contacted the seller and they were ok to send me another on, but they explained that each one of them was exactly the same.  So it's not exactly what you would expected because of the picture."
3.0,"Cool, but cheaply made."
3.0,Fabric very thin. Bought them to relax in not to wear in public. So I happy with what I received.
3.0,Front part of design works well. The back zippered pocket. Do not put much in there. It rips easily
3.0,Nice color very cheaply made but that's what's expected.
3.0,"The back straps are smaller than those on Honey Love so I returned it.  Good quality, soft material,  but didn't fit me as well as HoneyLove bras do."
3.0,Very small..
3.0,Just ok material quality not great and color was not a true red. I am returning.
3.0,"This fits beautifully and the chromatic beads along the neckline are such a lovely touch. The front is double layered, the back is a thin fitted layer and the sleeves are sheer without being see-through.  (my colorful 1/3 sleeve tattoo didn't show at all) I would give this 4-5 stars but the beads are already shifting (they're held in place by the equivalent of thick fishing line), so I'm not confident they'll survive another wash. Also, the sleeves are extremely short, and I've never had that problem before. They ride up 2-3 inches every time I move my arms, an odd length occurance made even more perplexing based on their ability to stretch over my hands completely when pulled there. If you have a naturally elongated frame, I'd advise against this top. It is true to color and length and fit. (sleeves aside)"
3.0,Lots of pretty colors and designs. No replicas. But they break very easily. The top ball cracked on 4 of them already while I wore them.
3.0,These are a wonderful idea. However they make the piercing larger and as such we couldn’t even put the earrings in my daughters ears.<br />If your piercing is slightly stretched out they would work well.
3.0,"So cute, but they run small y’all! Order a size up for sure in this brand."
3.0,Plain hat with writing on it.
3.0,"The smallest size was still way too big for me (I’m a 34B, 5’3” 115lbs) which was super disappointing because it’s a beautiful top otherwise"
3.0,"I used the size chart which was inaccurate. The large was so tight in arms, underarms and chest. Earlier I sent back an XL that was huge."
3.0,Sleeveless shell too heavy for a summer wedding!!
3.0,Such a cute necklace but it gets tangled.
3.0,"These socks are a good length with plenty of the traction tape on the bottom to hold firmly when you're moving on the yoga matt, floor ... but I find they twist on my foot when I'm working out and can make it necessary to stop and adjust the fit on your feet frequently.<br />They're not overly big or sloppy when on - so I'm not sure why.<br />The colors are versatile and length are good."
3.0,"I have several pairs of ankle & legging yoga pants by this brand! I love them because of the price point, they’re always comfy & fit true to size. However, this is the third pair I’ve received where the rear-end stitching is off & doesn’t align properly. I’ll keep buying more because they’re so darn comfy but the crooked seam does drive me nuts when I’m working out."
3.0,"when my purchase arrived, it was missing the bracelet, I contacted Amazon Customer service and they offered me 2 choices of resolution, I took the one that would work best for me and the problem was solved.  I had purchased this set for my soon to be daughter-in-law and was disappointed because just the necklace and earrings will have to suffice for her 'something blue'."
3.0,The straps were too loose and caused the top to sag and reveal bust. There were snags in the dress when it came and no tags attached.
3.0,They are ok but not style  expected
3.0,Product was cute but didn't hold up very long. I wore it every day for about a month before it started falling apart and changing color. But not bad for the price.
3.0,For starters not really worth 28 dollars it took a long time to deliver but delivered on time so that's cool i had gotten 2 for me and my friend it's not exactly what I expected its a flimsy silicone rubber mask so it's got... THAT smell but it has a nice black mesh that covers yours eyes and mouth easily without getting rid of much eyesight or have any breathing problems just for the way it's made I don't think it's worth the price I could probably make a better one for less it's allright though
3.0,Fit a tad too tight and not very stretchy. But very cute!
3.0,"These pajamas were very comfortable, soft and for well AFTER I took a seem ripped and removed the scratchy rags from them."
3.0,Not bed quality
3.0,"It’s pretty long, I should went down a size!! But, if was perfect for a Hocus Pocus party!"
3.0,"This shirt is very nice. I love it. Problem is. My man is a large. I saw reviews where statements said too small. So, I ordered an XL. Still too small. This shirt is not true to the size. Returning and ordering a XXL."
3.0,I ordered a 2x when arrived it showed 2x/3x so of course it was tight but I can't complain because of the price
3.0,"I have several pairs of yoga pants from 90 Degree and I love the fit on all.  my issue with this pair is the fabric shows sweat, gets darker in sweaty spots, not very attractive since typically the first place to sweat is your crotch area."
3.0,"Lovely sweater, but it's amazing how snug the arms of it fit near the wrist.  It's doubtful that I could wear any type of a heavier shirt underneath it because of this, and I am a small woman."
3.0,"It is a nice coral necklace although some of the Australian corals look even more bright, saffron colored with even color saturation.<br />The best part is the turquoise pendant which in real is even better than it looks like in the picture. It can be taken out easily without having to disentangle from the hook. It slides just slides out which you could use with some other (especially pearl) necklace.<br /><br />Good buy although I feel price is a bit high. (Not evaluated though)"
3.0,"The last couple of these I've bought (I've been wearing Casio watches for many years) were the larger, bulkier ""Sport"" models, which have larger, easier to read screen, and a few more features -- but much bulkier, and the straps were always oversize for my small wrists. Maybe that's one reason the bands never last long? But my guess is, poor Chinese plastic & quality control. My last two watches still work, and keep perfect time -- but it's a real pain to change the band. So when it broke, I thought, hell with it. For ten bucks...  These would likely fit women too, who prefer this style of watch.<br /><br />It is absurd to have to toss a perfectly good watch (w/ a 10-yr battery!) in the drawer, b/c the new band costs as much as  a new watch! It is also annoying that each different  Casio module has a different  time-set sequence. This one is even LESS intuitive than the last. Bah. I just attempted to link instructions on how to turn off the annoying hourly ""beep"" -- since the instructions Casio supplies flat don't work. So I guess you're  on your own. Hint: boxerwatches[dot]com instructions do work. Black mark to Amazon for blocking my comment!"
3.0,Not as good as Oakley lenses. After a month they are scratched already. I take good care of my glasses using special lens cleaner and cloth and putting them in hard case when not using. I really only wear them while driving. Had my original lenses 4 yrs no issues after 5 had some scratches after 6 time to replace sadly Oakley does not make replacements. Tryed these the 1st set they sent me one lens was too big to fit the frame. Customer Service sent me a new set and everything was fine. Did take a while to get my lenses from the time of order til everything was straight. When I replace these next I think I will try Fused lenses instead.
3.0,"Bought this as combination was good , skirt is good, top design is nice but the top fabric is not good and the top lining quality is poor. Overall look is elegant."
3.0,"I would give this 4 stars but it came with solid black pants instead of the striped ones as pictured. After looking through costume options with my 7 year old son for his upcoming pirate birthday, the stripes were kind of a deciding factor for selecting this one. He is however, still really happy with it and it will serve it's purpose. Quality is poor, but I didn't expect great quality for the price. The belt is nicer than I was expecting."
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, but it's too much for me. I looks like I just got off the boat from Africa.. and that's ok if that's the look you are going for but I wasn't..."
3.0,the stockings were of poor quality and didn't last very long.
3.0,"Amazon was nice to allow me to keep the item and refund me back; however, I really like the color of the bracelet, but the circle part was missing and looks like glue is left in there. I like Tom+Alice’s products and the ones I have are still in good condition. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get it fixed, but maybe, take out the circle part and add another piece to it. This won’t discourage me to buy from them. They have a lot more intriguing bracelets to own!"
3.0,I wouldn’t say this is true to size. Definitely smaller than ordered. I suggest ordering a couple sizes up.
3.0,"It's cute, looks just like the picture.. there were several strings coming undone from the stitching that I pulled and are now unravelling. There was also 2 blonde hairs inside the hat, so I obviously wasn't it's first home."
3.0,"The length is around 6.25 in., width 2.75 in. My glasses aren't oversized or bulky, and are rather compact folded. They fit in this case, but only just. If you want extra room, have glasses with large lenses, or have glasses that are bulky in general, look elsewhere. The print is not as clear as the photo; it's slightly blurry."
3.0,The pendant is really thick and clunky. Looks cheap in person. I planned to use it for a gift for my niece to ask her to be in my wedding but gave it away instead and ordered something else.
3.0,Did not like how it hung on my body. I recommend sizing up. I did and it fit just fine. Just didn’t like it for me.
3.0,"Bought bigger on purpose, it fits like the picture instead. So thin, it could be called lingerie. So poorly sewn, it needed an entire restitch on the chest and neck."
3.0,"In spite of the sizing guide, the size purchased was too small for the intended wearer. The shirt also had a strong &#34;chemical&#34; smell too and will definitely have to be washed before being worn."
3.0,"Pretty, but a bit shorter than it appears in the photo. I was hoping to wear it with leggings, but it's only really long enough for regular capri's and such.  I wish clothing makers would add inches to the bottom of the larger sizes so the proportions of the top would look right. Also, the pleat at the v-neck line is bulky and a bit odd."
3.0,"Fake fur is matted in all different directions, and not as luxurious as shown. Material is pretty thin with a large weave (much like a very low thread count sheet or cheesy sweater). Really not impressed. Would be happier if it was lined or had better faux-fur or something."
3.0,This dress is fire beautiful in every way however<br /> It’s too long I’m 5’8-  Nothing some heels won’t fix..The Chest & arms are way tooooo small I’m very disappointed I  reordered a size up hope it fits<br />If ur top heavy go 2 sizes up remember the chest n arms area on this dress run very small
3.0,The flare on mine was pretty big and could be a hassle to put in and remove everyday. I stopped using them
3.0,I wish they didn't ride up. Maybe I should have bought a size smaller.
3.0,"They are very light. They will come off your nose because they are so light. Not much sun block, when looking through them its not very clear."
3.0,Perfect for business cards!
3.0,"The socks are slightly large in the foot area.  I have a bunch of excess material in the toe area when I position the heel where it needs to be.  The leg part pulls up nicely to the knee, so this part is fine.  What I'm truly disappointed in is the quality and/or craftsmanship.  There were &#34;snags&#34; in several places on the socks (more so on the butterflies) upon receipt.  I've worn them twice and more of these snags are showing up for whatever reason.  By a snag, I mean the material is pulling out and looking unsightly.  There are also actual threads coming out where the heel color of white meets the sock color of lavender.  I most likely won't be re-ordering."
3.0,Sleeves were tight and it was a bit small. I returned it.
3.0,it looks small but is very large in person. they gold clasp does not stay closed and keys keep falling off. I read reviews on lilly pulitzer website and they said the same. It is cute though
3.0,"Other reviews were correct that these are VERY small.  It is difficult to do more than read with these.  Trying to watch TV and read at the same time is difficult because of the edge of the lense.  I was going to return them but the cost of returning was almost what I had paid.  So I put a pair in the car, an extra pair at work, etc.  There is NOTHING functionally wrong with these."
3.0,With this kind of fajas it is hard to find or get the perfect size.  Quality it's very good.
3.0,"Very useful product, exorbitantly priced with perhaps the slowest delivery in recent memory."
3.0,"Poor quality shirt, good quality pants. So I gave 3 out of fine."
3.0,I liked these. They fit well but fell a little short unfortunately. Easy return.
3.0,It is very pretty but when I opened the bag the smell was horrible. I don't even no how to describe it but overall it was put together nice no rips or stains.
3.0,"Nice, but not fashionable with the bands that come with it. You have to wrap the bands at least 3 times which makes it very bulky. If you do buy this product, buy thinner smaller bands, similar to small plastic hair ties."
3.0,"Nice product. Lace and lining of satisfactory quality given the price. However, better suited to curvy/voluptuous bodies. Sizing (Small) was fine, but style does not suit slender women. I imagine this dress would be very elegant on curvy women and looked even sexy in pics in black or red, but navy on me looked too prudish as it covered too much skin and there were no contrast between the lining and the lace (both navy). Perhaps if an XS was available, it would be ok. Also, not evident in the picture is a bow at the waist, which may be good or bad depending of your taste. I don't like bows! =]"
3.0,Good quality but I don’t like shirts with a lot of ink on the front. It makes it heavy and sweaty.
3.0,"They look cool and somehow helps with the glare, however, they makes everything darker. Not really useful in the fog. Arrived without fiber bag."
3.0,Wasn't expecting much from Amazon clothes but thought I would give it a try as it came decently recommended. Pretty colors and the material was comfortable but I hated that the sleeves were not long enough and it ran pretty short for my average size daughter.
3.0,Should have gotten one size smaller
3.0,"These sunglasses are the epitome of chic vintage. The only problem I had with them is that their size is a little small for my liking, however it is an okay size. The color I got my lenses in were the blue black color. The problem I have with this is that when I have them on they will suddenly turn a lot darker, and so I cannot drive with them. however, I still love the look of the sunglasses and the case is so cute."
3.0,"Style is awesome, but the quality of this product is poor. Definitely see thru on the bottom half, could use a liner. Lots of unfinished thread throughout the jumpsuit."
3.0,"Cute, but cheaply made and a little too small. Will probably last one or two Halloweens before completely falling apart."
3.0,"Cant atand that the lid doesnt fit securely in place, if i dont wanna use the bag i ahouldnt habe to put rubber bands around it to hold it on there, should prolly keep metal handles instead of the plastic idk whos idea it was to add plastic to it"
3.0,"I've purchased grace karin in the past and this shirt was just not up to par. It is cute and the fit is fine, but the material is thin and the buttons weren't even sewn on straight. Not worth the hassle of returning but overall disappointed."
3.0,The fabric on the dress was not as nice as expected. I know it is an inexpensive dress but it looks very cheap in person.
3.0,The material is a little stiff.
3.0,"I like the fit,hence I bought 3.But for the price,I expect it to have better quality check.lots of extra thread that I had to carefully cut .like it was hurriedly made and pack to shipped with no quality control. Disappointed ..."
3.0,"Cute tanks, but they are see through and make you somewhat boxy."
3.0,The material is very heavy and thick. It was heavier than I anticipated. Food pants but not suitable for Florida weather.
3.0,"I expected something a bit classier & just, &#34;nicer&#34;, maybe more sophisticated. I will still wear for a casual event, with jeans & shirt."
3.0,I expected the bottom half of the dress to be black and the over all dress fabric to be different. It fits nice but now I have to figure out how to make it look a bit more expensive
3.0,"This was advertised as a tshirt, the material is a shiny polyester, graphics and fit were good but I wanted a washed out tshirt as depicated"
3.0,The necklace is fine but the bracelet kept falling off my boyfriend's hand because it doesn't lock.
3.0,"According to size chart i should be able to fit a small confortably.  I decided to go with a medium just in case, and am glad I did.  Even though it is bigger than usually get, it is still very tight across the chest and shoulders."
3.0,There is no indication on the leaf itself that it's sterling silver otherwise it looks good
3.0,"These headbands fit my 18 month old daughter perfectly, but the back of the flower is stiff, so she will not wear them! I love the bands, they are adorable. As someone else said, the flower color does not always match the band color, and so some of them look a little strange. Overall, it is a great value for the price."
3.0,"Alright, I was having a pretty rough day when I did this original review, so it wasn't up to the quality I would have wanted, so I'm coming back to revise it so I can make my initial point more clear and I also found another problem I didn't notice at the time. So  I bought these to wear with some church outfits that needed belts or for tops that needed to be dressed up because I wanted something that would be neutral with my various new docs and their buckles as well as my jewelry  So, I personally probably would have liked these better of they had a matte finish instead of a high gloss shiny one, but that is not the reason for my rating.<br /><br />My first issue is that the lips on the closure for the leaf belts (in both silver and gold tone) is too shallow and the two sides can come apart with movement.  The lips on the rose belts are much better and that isn't an issue on them, just the ones with leaves. I have attached a picture of the two closures to show the difference.  I think they need to make the leaf belts lip closure as long as the rose belts.<br /><br />My second issue I discovered this morning.  There are tarnished areas that will not clean off on my two gold tone belts.  I have attached a picture of the worst bit of discoloration, it is on the gold rose belt, which I have not worn but more then 3 seconds to try on.  There is less noticeable tarnish on the leaf belt, which I actually wore for several hours today.  I think the tarnish issue is a cosmetic problem that could be problematic if gets worse, or if the belts you get should have it on more noticeable spots, such as the rose or leaf clasps.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are just ok.  They will work for what I need them to, the one I was in for church today felt comfortable enough, and I definitely like the fact that it is stretchable because that allows it to move with me when I have to chase after or lift my son.  Plus, I just really like things that feel less constricting.  So, just a heads up on the clasps and the possible tarnish."
3.0,"The eyes are not properly sewn on so on the whites there's visible extra black thread, they're also loose, I will have to remove them and resew them. The claws and feet are also separate which make it difficult to keep those bits on a wiggly baby."
3.0,"These are pretty glasses, but the size is more suited for a child."
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for. These are a little on the light side as far as thickness. My girlfriend loves them though. I love the design
3.0,"i wish the tag were sewn on the OUTSIDE of the jammy pants.  I want comfort when i sleep, and the tag is always a bother :(.  I was hoping these kind of particulars would be flushed out since they were pricey.  I love the cotton feel and the design."
3.0,Order one size up! Very well made but sizing is off. The top is too short for what should be a plus size outfit.
3.0,size was weird. fit me across shoulders but too tight in the armpits.  Arm length was perfect so larger size would have been to long.  material was thin and limp but maybe could have worked with starch and ironing.
3.0,Loved the picture but was smaller than expected
3.0,this hat  ran very small
3.0,The swimsuit is so cute but it is really short in the torso. I don't have an exceptionally long torso but this was fairly uncomfortable. I constantly had to pull it up and then that in turn made me have to tug it back down. It was a back and forth thing that was really annoying. I love the look of this and the coverage but if you are even moderately tall I don't think this will work for you. I would only recommend this for petite sizes.
3.0,Not for bustier women; would work for regular to small busts though
3.0,Nice craftsmanship and design. My only issue is the leather is brushed suede so taking the wallet out of my back pocket is a little difficult if I don’t want the whole pocket liner to also come out of my pant.  I have this issue with slacks and some of my golf pants.  I’m going to buy a different wallet since I wear these types of pants almost daily to work.
3.0,Neat idea but the directions weren't very clear.
3.0,"This is a casual hat for shoving in your purse when rain is expected. The crown is large so big hairdos will fit. The hat has a type of bow accent on the back to distract from its plain style. The hat is not water repellent and does not have a lining so do not linger in the rain without an umbrella. The hat is thick and flexible so it can bend and be pinned to create a style. I am going to keep it, but will not buy another."
3.0,My daughter loves the bag because of the pretty colors but it’s really not that functional for her as she has to adjust the straps every couple of mins as the silver keeps moving. Other that it is an okay bag
3.0,Cute short romper.  Love the color and material however it has been stretching out since I wore it a few times. Doesn’t hit well on my waistline so then it hangs to low in short area. The tips part is great!
3.0,"They're really cute, but they hang really far forward due to the weight being only in the front. I'm going to take them apart and hang the crystal through the tunnel so they hang evenly in my ears. Super cute though!"
3.0,"I am 5'7"", 135#, about a 32B and ordered the Medium.  It's a pretty dress and everything fit well from the bust down, but the arm holes were uncomfortably small.  I'm returning."
3.0,The rivets broke within 3 hours on 2 of the bags.
3.0,*Updated review* I was really shocked how well this bracelet was holding up for the price but one of the charms had fell off its not a big deal you can put it back on put the charms are fragile.
3.0,Very cute but sadly to small. I wear a size 8 in tennis shoes but due to my wide feet I wear an 8 1/2 in a dress shoe so that's what I ordered but they were still too tight. Not sure even going up to another half size would help as the toe area is very narrow and just not made for feet like mine. Had to return them
3.0,Negative: Somewhat difficult to clip onto my glasses. After 10 uses the mechanism broke.<br /><br />Positive: Took only a minute to get used to seeing the clips on the periphery of my vision. Used the glasses to play tennis. Did not affect my ability to track the ball.
3.0,These belts are not to bad if all you need is something to hold your pants up. I bought them as an inside belt for my range belt and they just aren't thick or stiff enough. The buckle also does not lay flat when wearing which is more of a personal thing than a functionality thing. Pretty much it goes to say you get what you pay for.
3.0,"They look different, and not sure if they are true to size, I’m thinking they run smaller then the size they say it is"
3.0,Collar chokes and the shoulders fit weird. But warm.
3.0,"This Pendant is big and the concept is really pretty, but the execution is not that great. The piece that I received is not great quality, actually it is far from it. The metal is iffy at best; the clasp is easy to break; and the &#34;stones&#34; are not stones, they are plastic that is glued into the metal and the glue is squished out all around the &#34;stones&#34;. The &#34;stones&#34; are also not set evenly which makes this piece look even more cheaply made than the flaws in the metal and the glue smooshed all around the settings. I really wanted to like this Pendant, I really did.... There's just too many things that are not up to par even for basic costume jewelry for me to give this more than 3 stars. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
3.0,"Nice style/quality, but too short on torso."
3.0,They are ok and decent for the money. Not a fan of the pink color tinted ones (daughter likes them). One pair broke taking them off while wearing helmet.
3.0,It was a nice fitting dress until I wore it for a few hours. I think bc the material was so heavy it gradually started to stretch and get longer through the day. What started as a mid-calf dress ended up being an ankle dress within a few hours. I would not recommend this dress as it does not seem to hold well.
3.0,"I bought these for work. Unlike a similarly styled glove I had purchased earlier, these seem to work as advertised. I was a little worried after a while when I noticed a bit of layer scraped away on one fingertip, but they still seem to be completely waterproof. They seem to be permanently discolored now, but that is okay.<br />Unfortunately, backsplash often gets water inside the gloves, especially if I fail to straighten the cuffs or keep them straightened (which can be difficult). Removal is a little more difficult than I like. I probably want something longer.<br />EDIT: A hole ripped in one less than a month after I got them. I am not sure if it happened during use or during storage and transport (the latter of which is very likely with me)."
3.0,"Thin material, a bit see-through"
3.0,didn't fit as expected
3.0,I have had a horrible time finding a gaiter that will stay up on my face.  This slides right down.  still deciding if I will keep it and sew the back seam or send it back and try others still.  Youth sizes are too small also.<br />It is very pretty and comfortable so its a hard decision.  I do recommend it though if you are not a petite female.
3.0,"Bought 2 sets of these- one in 8g and one in 6g.<br />The 8g are the size of my regular 6g tunnels and the 6g are about a 4g. I'm not talking about the flares either- the entire plug is waaaayyy off in size.<br /><br />I ended up using the ""8g"" in my 6g holes and they fit fine. I have only had them at 6g for a couple months but was able to use these as my first set of double flared plugs- I just slid them in sideways and then pushed and they kind of popped through the back. Although the give of the silicone makes it easier since they are double flared it also makes it kind of bendy to put it since they were small. It took me a few minutes to get in. Lube just makes it harder with the silicone. I've also noticed with the silicone that my ears are less cheesy and gross- not sure if it is a coincidence now that they are healed more or if i am allergic to the O-rings on my metal ones.<br /><br />The product itself is well made and durable and comes in a box. My only complaint is that they were both the completely wrong size."
3.0,not too happy with the material I also expected navy blue and it is more a royal blue color/
3.0,"I knew it was small, but very difficult to put on."
3.0,didnt stay in my foot after a few washes
3.0,"Super cute, works well to accent my drab work clothes, but poor quality. Bow came off after about two weeks, had to glue it back on. Haven't worn it in a while because it needs to be reattached again. Looks nice, but isn't made well."
3.0,"So the bust part fits fine, but it puffs up at the waist. It's a bit weird like I should have a extra injected fake kardashian juicy booty or something. I would need to wear a belt with this to make it look flattering on my body otherwise it just looks off. The fabric is that stiff cotton."
3.0,It's a nice looking bracelet but it's either too tight or too loose...needs an intermediate link to split the difference.
3.0,"I got an XL thinking it was by US standard. The top is a bit snug and the skirt certainly was way too small. For me to return it, it would have cost me the same amount to ship it back. Do not buy unless you have a smaller frame."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and the slit was up to my hip....way too high unless you want leggings, your underwear, or wawa showing. Too bad I don't sew or else I would sew it up a little. Also, material not breathable at all--wouldnt wear in hot climate."
3.0,Very disappointed All the feathers trim and Veil were crushed. Not worth the price
3.0,"I ordered a 2xl in hopes of having it fit bigger than needed.  Definitely not the case,  it fits more like a medium at best. My teenage daughters are now wearing it and love it, but wish I had one as well.  Gave it 3 stars because I like the brand and know it's well made."
3.0,"Extremely cute sunglasses. Unfortunately, one pair showed up broken and after two weeks with the other pair the lense randomly popped out."
3.0,"I ordered this small, square tote bag, but received instead, the small bucket/half circle shaped bag. It's fine, as it will suit my purposes just fine, and I do like how these bags hold up over time. It's also an improvement from my last order of small, square tote bags - as the first round of orders never showed up."
3.0,The hats are very sweet but all the decorative flowers fell off the first day they were worn. I glued them back on.
3.0,They are HUGE.....however if you are having a bad day or hungover they work!
3.0,"Very cute but I ordered a small and the product that came in was huge. Couldn’t wear it, I gave it away"
3.0,The reason why I m giving this product 3 stars is because the chains would break easily but otherwise they are amazing
3.0,It's somewhat small but I'm happy that I purchase it.
3.0,"Very awkward fitting. They sort of pouch in the front, like you have them on backwards. They're actually sort of comfortable though. Some of them the elastic has already started to wear after just one wasg. i bought them to use as postpartum panties, so looks and durability weren't important to me."
3.0,"First good and nice, fell apart after 6 months."
3.0,"Reasonable price, works like it is suppose to.  However, due to it's weight vs. the necklace chain I was using it with, it tends to spin towards the front."
3.0,"Beautiful pants and wonderful quality, but I wish the discription would of said more than just color:Stone. From the picture they look black...No they are Navy! Still love the pants, but bought to wear with black..not navy. I suggest a better discription."
3.0,Top a little loose but okay. Rear is too big but bought a skirt to cover. All good.
3.0,"Once i got the shirt, wasn't too fond on the fabric and design together."
3.0,I'm 5'1&#34; and weigh 112 pounds.  I bought the medium tall based on other reviews and struggled to get them on.  They're a very tight fit but have a nice look.
3.0,"Very comfortable, great arch support...but after a week the fabric on the inside is now so thin it's about to tear. Wish they were better quality for the price."
3.0,If your a plus size woman like I am it’s not made for us so it’s learning experience but it’s beautiful for a smaller person not for a 3XL
3.0,The dress came without the belt
3.0,"It's pretty but the slit is very high when standing. When you sit down it's exposing. For reference in 5' 7"". It's not wearable for me because of the slit ... The slit doesn't stay to the side as you move and sit, it moves directly in the front and exposes everything. This is was bust in my opinion."
3.0,Beautiful dress but came with stains and a hole. Not what I expected for a dress that’s $168 retail.
3.0,"This is a cute dress, it just did not fit right on me."
3.0,Decent slippers. Hoping that it lasts long.
3.0,Product was nice but too big and I didn't realize I had to<br />Pay return postage so it is unworn.
3.0,"Arrived bright and shinny, really nice looking. Turned dull and sad after a few weeks.  Had to take it off my bracelet.  It was a shame really.  It looked so nice at first."
3.0,"I ordered this with high hopes but if you are a petite woman, I would reconsider this dress. I'm 4'11 and 98lbs and the smallest size practically fell right off me. Good quality material and a pretty dress but not made for petite women."
3.0,they are not the  greatest pair of sunglasses but for the price they are cool enough!
3.0,"I have 3 girls ages 5-6.  They really wanted knee highs and I thought that these socks looked really pretty and were in their favorite colors.  These socks do not stay up and the girls get tired of pulling them up all the time.  For that reason, I am not crazy about them. They do not look pretty all bunched up around the girls ankles.  Wish they would remain on or slightly under the knees."
3.0,Shoe for great but has not held up to my active girl. Her toes are now poking through after only 2 months
3.0,"cute dress but if you have a bubble butt like me, order a bigger size."
3.0,This item was previously opened and was not repackaged properly. The lenses are plastic and are not clear enough to be most effective.<br />They are also wider than expected. I will not trouble myself to return them but am doubtful that they will become a happily used item.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this strap, but it is poorly made. The strap and its lining are not firmly attached to each other so the prong caused fraying and had to be coaxed to protrude completely thru the holes.  The strap did not fit well around the wrist and kept listing to the left.  This hampered my Bradshaw smartwatch from properly responding to wrist gestures. It is leather and looks good but using it is problematic."
3.0,very nice and pretty however it runs small with no stretch
3.0,"Arrived quickly.  Nice looking, like old Hollywood 😊.  Keeps the sun off my face and the back of my neck, just as I hoped."
3.0,"the color is distorted in the image, the color was much darker in person and is not what i was looking for  great product though"
3.0,Very cute. Bottoms very low if you have any volume in the back. It will not cover.
3.0,The bands were simple enough to change. My biggest issue is that the bands started to pill and looked worn after only a day. Spend a little more for better quality.
3.0,REAL NICE BELT BUT...THE STRECH MAKES THE BELT FEEL LOOSE AND I WAS ALWAYS PULLING UP MY PANTS. THAT GOT PRETTY ANNOYING
3.0,The frames are not sturdy
3.0,for the price its a good biking backpack.  I find I have to make the strap pretty tight and it would be nice if there was something to store the end of the strap in as it waves around a lot while riding a bike.
3.0,They work OK.
3.0,"The gloves looked nice, but did not fit very tight. I was hoping for a tighter fit. I have slender fingers, so perhaps that is why. Also, I wore these to New York earlier this month, and they did not keep my fingers warm at all. They look nice, and the touch screen finger tips were very helpful, however would not recommend these if going in the cold, cold weather."
3.0,I returned it right away after i fitted it cause the beads are falling off and it is also very long that almost 1/3 of the skirt needs to be cut off/shortened.  It is a very nice dress but the quality of the product is not that good..
3.0,Good size but very cheap looking. Oh well.
3.0,Ordered a large. It’s very small. Cute shirt.
3.0,I ordered the wrong size. Really great shirt I just hit the wrong size when ordering. But...I sent it through a couple of heat washes and shrunk it to the perfect size!
3.0,"Its ok - definitely ""costume"" jewelry,  It served its purpose for a New Orleans Saints football party"
3.0,Nice material just wasn't long enough.
3.0,The bra padding looked funny.  I used some from a sports bra and it looks nicer.
3.0,Cute Suit but too small
3.0,It stains clothing
3.0,"You get what you pay for! It’s not perfect but it’s cute and matches a lot of what I own. I found the sleeves to be a little too short and I wish I ordered a size up! I’m 5’2” so I normally never have the issue of things being too short for me but besides that, I do love this sweater and still wear it!!"
3.0,"I normally wear a size Large so when purchasing these ""slim fit"" type of shirts I usually go a size up.  This time was no different.  I ordered a size XL figuring it would fit just fine.  Unfortunately, ordering wasn't enough because this came in fitting like a Medium.  This shirt is definitely for those that want to show their muscles (if they have them....LOL).<br /><br />The styling is nice but the fabric is a little thin."
3.0,"It's okay. I did find that it sort of rides up when I am walking and becomes too short, so I am constantly pulling it down."
3.0,Little small in waist and pouch.
3.0,This is s nice scarf if your planning to wear it as a accessory. I bought this scarf to wear at night to protect my hair and it will not stay on.
3.0,The earring back is too loose. I put the earrings on and they fell off because the earring  back had fallen off. I will have to purchase tighter earring backs if I want to wear these earrings.
3.0,This was not super flattering on me and the tie on the bottom doesn't lay right.  This top makes me look heavier than I am.
3.0,"These were a big hit with the kids though they don't stay on the little rubber bands very well.  Quite a few of the lights did not work, especially the red ones."
3.0,The shirt is not bad.  The sleeves were a bit tight.  The flow that it gives in the picture is not completely true.  It is not fitted but I would recommend one size up to b completely comfortable.
3.0,these earrings are so tiny they could be worn by infants...they are barely visible and way over priced...gave them three stars because of the black enamel and silver!
3.0,This skirt ran a little big for me..
3.0,Overall the pants are smaller compared to the same XL size in USA national brands such as Underarmor or Hanes.
3.0,"ok for the price. but if you are looking for something that looks not flimsy or cheap, don't get it"
3.0,looks and feels cheap.
3.0,It's cute and all but it looks nothing like the picture. So I'm kinda pissed. Wish I would've got what I paid for.
3.0,Really cute but really wide
3.0,Material is nice and soft.  Fits fine but not as flattering on my curves as a flat front pants are.  Will be nice option for dressy cold weather events.
3.0,"Was a little disappointed with the quality, otherwise ok."
3.0,As a woman with medium hands these are still too big.  Bummer
3.0,"Low quality, awkward fit, runs large."
3.0,"I like the skirt, but it fit strange and was a bit small."
3.0,Not what I rxpected.
3.0,"I loved the way the dress looked but do not be fooled by reviews that say this dress fits true to size, that is not true.  It runs about two sizes small."
3.0,A little smaller than what I thought it would be by the size I ordered
3.0,I just had a baby a few months ago and still have a “mom belly” these shorts really amplified that belly. The outfit is super adorable though.
3.0,"Seems like good quality. However, the strap is much darker than what the product photos show. It’s more of an orange color, especially when placed right next to the leather of my purse. Will probably return."
3.0,"I am 5'10&#34; and weigh 159 lbs.  Bust 36, waist 32, hips 38.  This top fit me like a sack.  If you are looking for something light, airy and loose it would probably be the top for you.  I don't particularly hate the fit, it would be nice for lounging around the house on a hot summer day but not a good fit for me to wear to the office.  I prefer something that follows the line of my back rather than draping amorphously.  Because I would rather have something with a more flattering silhouette I will return this and order something else."
3.0,"It says one size, but runs small. I am usually between a medium-large, and I had a difficult time pulling it up."
3.0,"I've had these boots for a little over a year and a half now. My first comment is that I really like the style as I receive compliments every time I wear them. However, they had a horrible smell when they arrived that did eventually go away in approximately a month AND they are not leather as claimed in the description. I am posting a picture to show how my boots are peeling so badly I no longer wear them unless I'm wearing pants to cover the peeling. This is unfortunate as again, I really love the style and the comfort of the boot."
3.0,Good enough for photo sessions.  Acrylic yarn is not the softest.
3.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; but I'm pretty thin so I ordered the medium, but it was too short :/<br />Will order a large in red and see if that's longer."
3.0,"This is very comfortable..HOWEVER, it is definitely not for high or even medium impact. I should have followed what the reviews recommended."
3.0,"Picture looked way better.  Not form fitting at all, comparable to garbage bag tailoring."
3.0,Strap tore off after one use. Disappointed.
3.0,"This belt works great. It makes it a lot easier to buckle up and adjust the length. However, the buckle broke after 6 month of usage."
3.0,I like the gown but one of the buttons came off after wearing it like 3 times. I’m disappointed.
3.0,"This dress is beautiful on, a little see through though witch was a bummer, but with nude underwear I think can make work.<br />I am 5’4 and average weight. this dress was just long enough to the point I was stepping on it, but throw on some wedges and problem solved if don’t want to hem.<br />Also the chest part is weird. Lots of side boob hanging out and even a strapless backless bra peeks through (solution) : shorten the neck straps by sewing new hem."
3.0,"Saw reviews that said it ran a little small so I upsized and it was perfect, nice beach dress for my little one"
3.0,Scratchy fabric but cute
3.0,"The fit was good for me. It's an adorable shirt to wear to the office. One thing that got me is that I thought the bottom of both layers were attached to each other, they are not. The lace has elastic at the bottom, and it tends to ride up."
3.0,Pretty looking but kind of rough material and the top is very short
3.0,Material doesn't stretch at all
3.0,Bought this top in medium and i am usually that size however it fits somewhat large.  camisole  required.
3.0,Good enough. liked it.
3.0,"Fit well, but the pockets made it bell out in a weird way at the hips. It was okay, but wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,I loved this except the fact that I was using the tool when I was sizing to my wrist. The pin would only come out so far and it was way too big to wear. Good thing they accept refunds
3.0,"Not terrible quality, but very short and very tight for an XL. I can’t imagine after washing. Had to return."
3.0,I liked but material shrink when you washed 😡
3.0,Pretty. A little flimsy but cute.
3.0,"I like the appearance of these inexpensive earrings--particularly the teal pair. They are light-weight and are easy to put on and take off. What a fun way to add some creativity and flash to an outfit. Here is the sad part: these earrings are too long, The bottoms of the feathers closest to my head end up resting on my shoulders and I don't have a short neck. Another problem: the wires of the ear hooks have a lot of discolored spots on them. Not sure what is up with that, but it doesn't bode well for the future of these earrings. So I'm disappointed that I can only rate these earrings 3 stars, because I wanted to love them."
3.0,"I like the color, length and fit. But the criss-cross straps at the cleavage  weren't evenly lined up, and I had to sew them into a better position or return the top.  I wanted to keep it otherwise, and couldn't find many red tops that fit that well, so I just dealt with it myself. But it kept me from ordering it in other colors...."
3.0,"Something is not right about the fit on this sock.  I thought it was the same as my other darn tough socks that look identical in the picture, but these feel oddly tight on the front of the ankle. idk why they are this way, but I do not like them.  I also wear a size 12 boot and got the xl size and they seem short.  These must be 2nds or something because they are not the normal darn tough fit."
3.0,He likes the fit and weight but the pockets tear easily and he keeps having to order more.
3.0,"Very cute. An adorable jacket, it just doesn't withstand. I've had this jacket for about three months, and it has torn on the inside twice. I've been able to sew up the tears to get more life out of the jacket, but this definitely isn't ideal. It's also not very warm at all. It's basically just two layers of thin fabric. Cute if you're looking for something to wear a few times, but not if you want something that lasts."
3.0,"Cute, but not as strong with the chain as I like... Super cute though! Bought because of the two '''' My heart &amp; my Lovie."
3.0,But i love it! Perfect for the summer outings
3.0,Pretty big. Doesn't leave much room for flexibility. Slightly uncomfortable. Looks nice but reminds me of wearing a neck brace
3.0,Runs very small. Cute dress but I will probably regift. Its a costume so it will damage easily.
3.0,just ok looks picture looks better than in person kind of cheap looking
3.0,"As some of the other reviewers pointed out, the pattern is off so I was pretty disappointed about that - but then again, it's $19.99 so don't want to hold it to a really high standard. The white areas are slightly are through - I can see the tag on the side and the bottom of my bra. Overall though it's a cute flattering spring dress and I'll get some good wears for $20. I consider this work appropriate with the right bra and would look great with a blazer as well. I think it does run a little small if you don't want it skin tight - I'm 5'8&#34;, 150 lbs. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large based on other reviews and am glad I did as it's form fitting but not skin tight."
3.0,"Purchased one for my girlfriend she loves it, but they are not solid stainless steel. The pieces with Han and Leia are starting to show the copper base beneath."
3.0,"I found head band elastic was too tight, in fact I got a headache wearing the cap. Other than that, I tought quality was good and material looked great.<br /><br /> Sent back for refund.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend do to tight head band."
3.0,this is not a very comfortable bra
3.0,"Didn't fit well, partly because it's too small, but it also doesn't have any give in any of the right places. Even if it were a bit looser, I can't imagine I'd be able to lift my arms!"
3.0,Very cute costume but runs small
3.0,Not as pictured I hate the big goofy circle emblem it makes it look less elegant and more like a diaper bag. This bag is exactly like a small diaper bag you can actually fit two diapers in the back pocket. I am not in love with the bag as the little side pockets are not very functional. I haven’t tried it with a baby bottle because I don’t currently have one but I think a tall narrow baby bottle could potentially fit in the side pockets. A traditional cup does not.
3.0,"Fits tight, more of a medium than a large.<br />I like the feel.<br />It washed well, however, the printed tag came off in the wash."
3.0,"They are poorly made, the zippers are terrible"
3.0,Color not as described
3.0,"Not very good quality, but good shipping. True to color & size too. Is not durable. Rips easily around the zippers. Bow gets dislodged at times. Stitching even lower quality on the inside. Looks so pretty, but I really don't like it because it doesn't hold up."
3.0,Very small but my wife likes them
3.0,The color was not what the pictures looked & the quality of the material was way off. The dress was so wrinkled & I pressed it several times & still couldn’t get the wrinkles out. Over all was just not happy with it.
3.0,I am a size 8 bottom and 36D top.  Top is too small in that my breast hang out the top and bottom at the same time. Bottoms are fine in size but poor stitching.
3.0,"I bought a small thinking it would fit based on the size chart and they don't have an option for extra small, but the dress was larger than expected and I cannot wear it. I am 5'2 and 125 pounds normally wears small"
3.0,"This band is difficult to adjust if your wrist is small. Also, the picture made it seem like it was going to come with a matching case for the watch (to match the band) but it did not."
3.0,I'm a size 4. It's baggy in the shoulder blades area and under your arms so you can see your bra. I'm 5'8&#34; and it's about 2 inches too long for me. It's beautiful though and feels very nice. I just wish it fit right. I followed the chart so maybe order 1 size smaller if you want a tighter fit.
3.0,"It's pretty, but the chain clasp came broken."
3.0,"This is a beautiful bag, but the measurements listed are incorrect. It is actually 16 inches in height not 13 inches. I have requested a return because it is too big for my liking. If you are looking for a large tote bag this bag would work."
3.0,"This is huge Macy cube size xl<br />When I ordered a medium<br />I’m 5’2” 125-128 I am curvy<br />It needs to be tapered down by several inches width wise<br />I’m an express 3/4.  I have kind of a gut from having kids that I call saggy balls..,,, even then the dress is four inches too wide without a stretch. I wear a medium even in target brands for tops  And run between banana republics 3/4-5/6.  And even wear a medium in Nike leggings and nearly can’t fit a small in Nike leggings (I suffocate) still this was gigantic to the point even zipped will fall/drop straight off"
3.0,"I really liked the way these looked, but they kind of fell apart. They did look hot!"
3.0,Fits two sizes smaller.
3.0,"Gloves were comfortable but didnt hold up. After one day on the ski slopes, gloves had multiple rips on seams."
3.0,Print done cheaply and will erase with the washes.
3.0,"Sizing is totally off. These ship from China. They are not &#34;American&#34; sized. I am 5'9&#34;, and wear a dress size 12. I ordered an XL, based on the reviews to size up.<br /><br />They are about 6&#34; too short (the length falls mid-knee, not mid calf.) and they're all around too small.<br /><br />I gave them to my petite daughter. She wears a size 2. The XL was slightly big in the waist, but totally wearable for her. If I were to order specifically for her, I'd order a size L.<br /><br />The quality seems good and they are very cute leggings! On my kid. :/"
3.0,"These masks are incredibly soft and are the perfect size for our 5 year old. However, as mentioned by another buyer, the colors we received were definitely geared more toward girls (pink an purple). I will be giving them away to friends with girls. Too bad, they are otherwise very nice."
3.0,Material is cheap. Not true to size.
3.0,"Tried a large , then X large fit ok but still a little tight in the shoulders. Hope it doesn't shrink in the wash. It didn't, cold wash cool dry. Like it!!"
3.0,"These earrings showed up on time there was no damage. but I want to start off by saying these are not your typical earrings. Looks are deceiving by all means. The earrings are square maybe rectangle shape  not your  typical round tip that you would Have on ear rings. At first when I noticed the unusual shape I didn't think anything of it into  began to insert the earring in my ear.  Now your typical earing is a lot smaller and round tip Then this is square rectangle shape that begin to quickly stretch out my ear hole.  I thought it wasn't so bad I figured my ear would get used to it.  Then the earring wouldn't clamp in the back it's not the typical ear ring where it  clamps easily on. Of course!  Nooo, this is the kind of ear ring that where you have to separated the ear ring and insert it in the little hole and it became extremely painful since my ear hole was not used to being open so wide.  I do wear the earrings for a couple hours and my ears hurt for two whole days afterwards.  My personal opinion only because I think my  your holes are not used to being spread  that why if you have wide your holes these hearings are perfect for you.  So warning'warning must have  wide earring holes for these kind of earrings otherwise that you're going to hurt for at least a while into your ears get used to them."
3.0,"The sleeves on this are stiff and uncomfortable, restricting rangge of motion while sleeping so that I feel trapped in my sleep while wearing it. I didn't realize it would be such an issue, but in the future, I won't buy a 3/4 length sleeve gown unless it's made of stretchy material or has a more generous sleeve that allows me to bend my elbow easily when I'm sleeping on my side. Because it's so stiff, I avoid wearing it. It does fit and is warm and fairly comfortable when I'm upright."
3.0,"Cooking apron is overall nice, but quite short!"
3.0,"Looks nice,but alot smaller than what I expected"
3.0,"I was pleased with the length and width of the product; however, quite disappointed with the print I order an animal print, but I received a polka  dot print."
3.0,This top is tight and the button/chest area doesn’t lay like it does on the model. I’m a full C cup and it still doesn’t open like it does on the picture. The material is nice and I like the muted ribbing but overall it’s just not the fit I was hoping for.
3.0,"My waist is 25 inches and i purchased a x small knowing that it should fit  but do tell why y'll would make the chest 32-35 (going random) and then the stomach the same that is BS. Bo everyone has a big belly , i really want to return it looks like i ate a watermelon"
3.0,First of all the things I wasn't as excited about. I wish it was just a tiny bit shorter. And it kind of looked to me almost like a bathrobe kinda.  I was set to return it (honestly though I hate the hassle of returning things) when I talked myself out of it because of:<br /><br />the things I liked about it!<br /><br />I love the color.  It's a really pretty blue.  And it was really comfortable.  And the size I ordered seems like it fits as it should.<br /><br />I will keep it but don't LOVE it - if I'd gotten it only for the purpose of wearing around the house it would perfectly fit the bill but to wear it work it's iffy in my opinion.
3.0,Just cut akwardly not sure how to put it.
3.0,Some of the rhinestones were gone when they arrived. Forgot and ended up keeping them. Very pretty.
3.0,"I love the cut, length, fit and quality of the dress, however the material was too see through to wear the pink dress without something underneath. Maybe black is better..?"
3.0,"I like the glasses and the way they look.  I use them for driving and just handling them in and out of the car sunglass holder resulted in a scratch lens almost in a very bad spot, meaning in the position where I view most of the time."
3.0,"This is a large and heavy piece of jewelry, the clasp that holds it to the chain is cheap and bendable, the chain is beautiful and good quality and the pendant its self is heavy and seems well made, for size comparison the pendant is almost ad long as my pinky finger. So if you are looking for dainty this isn't it."
3.0,too short.  good quality and price
3.0,however the clasp is not as rugged as the wallet. It cracked in my pocket
3.0,This mask looks ok.  It was expensive for a Halloween mask.  The smell inside was pretty gross.  We bought it for a Michael Myers dummy that we had out in our yard on Halloween so the smell wasn't an issue for us but I feel bad for anyone who planned to wear it.
3.0,Lovely dress. Fits as expected<br />However when i washed it the burgundy ran on the cream. so thts the end of it
3.0,"Very small, not true to size, very short.  I purchased a medium for my two girls.<br />I have requested a replacement for larger size."
3.0,"This bag was ok.  It was stiff, but that's to be expected with the style.  It was roomy, I wouldn't have had a problem with my phone and other essentials fitting.  I returned it because it had a little extra glue or something on the material.  I didn't try to get a new one because I found something else instead."
3.0,Pretty but extremely small
3.0,"The beard part left hair on my face. It's very cute, kind of comfortable but it took forever to get here."
3.0,Holes wear out quickly making the bad fairly insecure.
3.0,Was replacing a much loved one-that was lost. Literally wore this TWO DAYS and the chain (VERY FINE and shiny) broke- not even being snagged or anything. Chain was VERY weak.
3.0,"This is a decent pair of gloves. I had hoped the leather would have been thicker on the palms due to the 'Protect the King' hype but wasn't too impressed or reassured to be honest with you. The finger Kevlar carbon protectors aren't that adequate but the knuckles and wrist ones are. It has great grip on the throttle as well as fit well if you stay true to your size. They're worth the 50$ but would expect them to hold up past 50mph to be honest with you.<br /><br />Two month update: I had the pleasure, or demise depending on how you look at it, with dropping my bike at 45mph with these gloves on. I was lucky enough to have my full gear or and walked away with literally no injuries. The gloves however, did their job. Unfortunately, they didn't make it past the wreck.. the palms were completely gone..knuckles though did an amazing job protecting the back side of my hand. If you're looking for a set of gloves to race with, look else where. For cruising the streets, they're  a damn good pair, they just won't hold up past a wreck."
3.0,Make sure you size down with this item
3.0,i mean they not bad. look real enough for a quick snapchat video or something lol
3.0,Nice hat but too small for my head
3.0,"Fits a little strange, but looks pretty much like it does in the picture. Perfect length with heels (I'm 5'2&#34; with 3&#34; heels on). The grey dress has some weird brown flowers on it that my daughter thought were baby poop smears... Great quality and material, just not quite my style."
3.0,One eye works great. Nice and clear. Other eye can't focus. Always used over the counter readers. A little disappointed.
3.0,"It ran small and feels slimy.  Maybe all jerseys feel like this.  I cant wear it and threw the bag away, so will gift it."
3.0,"Too small, order two sizes larger"
3.0,These are nice dry fit tank tops but they are not a compression fit or cut. I bought XS and am usually an XS to a S in size…and currently on the larger end of that spectrum. These are definitely not compression
3.0,"Run a little small. Material isn't great, but ok."
3.0,Way too thin and see through unfortunately. Might be good to cover a bathing suit?
3.0,"Purchased this for my boyfriend, doesn't fit his head very well. Only one speaker, really needs one by each ear in my opinion, he gave to me and I just use as a stocking hat."
3.0,"I have been using a pair of these daily on either side of a fanny pack, forward where I can easily open them. I keep four or five dog treats in each while hiking. For this size, this is the best designed and manufactured pouch I have been able to find, but after daily use for a year the belt loop gave way on one and the corners started to separate on the other. I’m buying another to replace the torn loop and if I can find something better I certainly will."
3.0,"Color nice, style ok, size: big on top and ok on the waist . Dress is stiff : it stands on its own."
3.0,A little shorter than I like my scarves to be
3.0,"The bottoms were tiny with zero butt-cheek coverage.  The top is very cute, a little small, but I still wear it."
3.0,Love the face of this watch.  The band was not quite what I was looking for.  A little plastic feeling imo.  Would pay more for a stainless steel version.  Had to return.
3.0,The only thing that I don’t like is the quality pants.
3.0,"I was hoping to Receive two different earrings as shown in the picture, but instead I received two the same kind , they where nicely packaged , in a little box and each earring in its own tiny bag .they are cute but I wished to have gotten the two different earnings as shown in the picture ."
3.0,Fits tighter than you would expect. 150lbs and 5’4 A large was almost tight. The lace color is a beige/peach
3.0,"Accidental bumping easily changes time.  That said, big numbers make it easy to read .. can switch-on lighted numbers also making it easy to read especially in dim lighting conditions."
3.0,"This is an ok top.  It's thin so don't think it will keep you warm in the winter even though it comes up under sweat shirts.  I thought the color was grey & black but it's actually a purple shade.  Not quite what I was expecting, but not enough for me to send it back.  What ever happened to soft fluffy sweat shirts?  Maybe I need to do more looking at other products."
3.0,"The kimono blouse itself was nice and the embroidery details were just what I was looking for, but unfortunately the fit was not what I was anticipating. When I received the kimono I immediately tried it on and realized that the length was much shorter than the stock photo showed, I'm 5' 2&#34; and the lace trim on the bottom barely covered my torso. If that is the fit you want then I think it could be a good buy, but if you are wanting something longer, look elsewhere."
3.0,I found them too small for my medium sized hands. They were too tight.
3.0,Not fleece.
3.0,Rubs a bit big but nothing too terrible! Gave three stars because one of the eyes was oddly shaped
3.0,Somewhat smaller.then expected
3.0,Product as advertised but they stretch at ends perhaps a stitched edge would help
3.0,"these socks seem to work ok for my wife  not for me.. I got the largest size available  , however I could not get them on, the area for my calf  was made for a stork  way to small.. now my wife likes them but the foot size is way too large  they need to make it so that you can actually pull them over your foot and be comfortable on your calf<br />I would not buy again unless they changed  the top part of the sock."
3.0,"Merchandise was used for a wedding in Atlanta.  The quality isn’t so good, you get what you pay for..."
3.0,Not what I was looking...shares the  name  but not the performance
3.0,"Really beautiful coat; unfortunately, the shoulders and sleeves are cut very tight. I had to return mine.  Order a couple sizes larger than you normally wear."
3.0,"I don’t like the fabric, the shirt isn’t breathable and the image pixelated. It’s not cheap but I hate to make this a bad review but just not a comfortable shirt."
3.0,"This necklace is very beautiful. I like the pendant, however the chain is very cheap and broke after wearing it for one day."
3.0,basically returned as was not to my liking
3.0,"Sooo cute, but easy too long. Is this a short 3 or dress?"
3.0,Está un poco grande el small quizá extra small hubiera sido mejor
3.0,These truly are the sweetest little shoes... but not so little. I purchases size 12 at the same time I purchased 12w in Hush Puppies (black maryjanes). HP fit appropriately. These are so large I would say at least 2 whole sizes too big. I will send them back :(... so pretty!!
3.0,I ordered an extra large which I gave this to my wife who is small and it fits her perfectly.
3.0,"So I ordered both the white and the red and they’re completely different shirts.<br />Different material different design different texture.<br /><br />I was really searching for the white one and I bought the red one because it was such a good price but I actually prefer the red one’s quality design and material over the white one.<br /><br />They are pretty small and very huggy. And as you can see from the pictures, even though they are both smalls, the white one isn’t the same kind of small as the red one. For the price of $10 I guess it’s fine. But pretty disappointed that they aren’t the same. I am sure they will shrink to so I will hand wash.<br /><br />The white one also isn’t square next AND square back. It’s just a square neck with a small scoop back.<br /><br />Pretty bummed."
3.0,The size was to small
3.0,The rib on the sleeves are tight.  Had to cut them off.
3.0,This runs pretty small. But overall it is nice I sized up 2 sizes and it was still a little snug.
3.0,Very cute but almost impossible to get into!
3.0,IT WORKS...MAKE LOOKS PRETTY CHEAP THOUGH....
3.0,Looses its appeal after a week. Not practical.
3.0,"I think I should've gotten a bigger size.  The material is nice and the color is pretty.  But I just don't like how it fit on me.  I had hopes for this too, but it's okay.  Maybe that's the wind telling me to go and lose more weight.  LOL.  It's still beautiful, but not for me (at this time)."
3.0,These are very comfortable but the cup inserts do not stay put.  I ultimately just removed the inserts and am using the bras without them.
3.0,Well... my boobs still flopped. Maybe for smaller unflappy breast. But definitely not working it for me.
3.0,Love the scarf..light weight and looks exactly as shown. Thanks!
3.0,"My pics show the front and side views as best as I could do with my tablet camera. This thing is very, very long, I'm 5'8&#34; or so and it sweeps the floor unless I pull it up over my navel...attractive. It has four big, thin, chiffon like panels that are evenly gathered around an elastic waist band giving a nice round barrel look. Forget that sleek, flattering look you see on the model, you won't get that. It could've done with 2 to 2-1/2 panels for the skirt to look like what's actually pictured.<br />I like the color and pattern, it's see thru fabric but has a non-see thru built in slip below the knee. And it is fixable if you're good at alterations. But that's not why we BUY our clothes, is it? I can alter it but I'm not sure I want to bother. I'll mull it over some since it's winter and this is definitely a summer skirt. On the bright side, if your 5-11, 6 feet and you love ruffles, this is the skirt for you."
3.0,"Size runs large, I got compliments on it when I wore it. But the metal was more copper than rose gold."
3.0,"This was supposed to be a gift for my daughters friend, but due to the tacky ""refund policy"" sticker on the back I think it looks too cheap to give as a gift. Disappointed.  :("
3.0,My crotch isn't 6 inches towards my knees. Other than that it's true to size. I would buy a man's suit if you are tall though. Would it kill them to put a sipper at the ankle?
3.0,Comfortable but too short for length.
3.0,"Its ok, kind of itchy and pretty see through (you can see the holes between knitting). doesn't lay on my body as well as some nice cardigans do. Not really worth it in my opinion."
3.0,"I bought these to wear while teaching yoga since I'm not too keen on being barefoot on gym floors. I'm a women's size 9 and these are a bit too small for me. The grippy part doesn't extend to my heels and the sock rides down my ankle when I start moving around. Despite that, I haven't slipped in them and my feet are covered from whatever nasties are on the floor, so I will keep these until they're worn out and buy a different brand next time."
3.0,"5'4"", 145lbs. Too big and show every flaw on body."
3.0,"I really like this, however, it's a bit to long and makes sitting rather uncomfortable."
3.0,good quality but it was way too large
3.0,Not what I thought.  They were too big and shiny.
3.0,I thought i ordered it with my rank on the left side of the hat. That is all that is wrong.
3.0,Looks used.  Other than being scratched looks like good quality wallet
3.0,"Very thin but fir the price, I'll add a slip under it. It does show all of your curves."
3.0,Ok metal. Nice colors as indicated in pic.
3.0,It actually looks nice but the ribbons were too short to wrap around my head and the eye holes were small and kept poking me in the eyes. i will be returning these.
3.0,though very pretty . the hole for the chain does not line up well and is too small for even the finest of chains to get through
3.0,"This belt is pretty and nice quality. It however runs at least one size small. I usually buy a large in stores, ordered an XL here and it just fits"
3.0,I bought this bag Oct. 6th and I love it it's not to big or to small being a mom of two little boys one 8 months and one 3 years it fits all the needs but today dec. 25th 2016 my zipper on the main part broke off  made me so sad because I loved this bag
3.0,"It looks very nice. The photos do wear off after some time, but it is a nice product for the price.<br />Just don't were it 24/7."
3.0,"Could have been better quality, small fit"
3.0,"Its great for the price. My bra size is 34D so I went with a size medium. The cup size is good, but I'm going to have to do some altering on the band size because it is too big around. Also one of the jewels on the strap was already falling off when it arrived. But what do you expect for $15.00. It can be easily glued back on. Can definitely use this as part of a costume in the future."
3.0,"THIS PENDANT IS VERY PRETTY, BUT DOES NOT REFLECT LIGHT LIKE I EXPECTED IT WOULD.  I LIKE THE COLOR, WHICH IS UNUSUAL, BUT THE SHAPE IS A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN EXPECTED.  EVEN THOUGH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE REFLECTED IN THIS REVIEW, FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES LARGER JEWELRY, IT IS A VERY NICE PIECE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT AND IT MAKES A NICE GIFT."
3.0,These were for my husband. He said that they made him really hot and he felt that they weren't as breathable as he thought they'd be. They also rode up on him a little but they sure did look good on him!
3.0,"It said that my Mom and Dad would die in a car accident on July 14 but it was wrong, they died in a car accident on the July 12"
3.0,"Me gusto el color dorado ,pero,tiene un Fuerte olor ,a metal."
3.0,This came 4 weeks earlier than expected 🙌🏽 so don't let the expected delivery date discourage you.  Honestly it looks pretty cheap (not in a tacky way) but for the price that's fine. You can adjust it to fit your wrist as needed. It gives off chill hippie vibes if that's what your into so that always good 💁🏽<br /><br />Update<br />So the first day I decided to wear it out it broke 😅.  While it seems to be something that can easily be repaired I can't be bothered. I more or less may have been a little to rough with it (treating it the way I treat my more expensive jewlery). So if you're wearing it be cautious of that 💆🏽
3.0,Very nice and soft loved the lace top fit good but pants were a little big
3.0,I like them and ordered an club because I like a lot of room in mu pj's but these just fit
3.0,I bought these earrings as a gift. They're beautiful and decent size for a stud earring. The quality is comparable to a mall purchased earring set. The turquoise is blue not the seafoam green color in the photo.
3.0,I only got to wear it once and as soon as i washed it the criss cross straps broke. I washed it on gentle super bummed loved this shirt.
3.0,WAY Smaller than ordered. I actually ordered an XL the largest size they had. It will fit my 12 year old granddaughter. :(
3.0,Way too small!<br />Nice sweater but had to return it and buy a bigger size
3.0,I got an XXL. I wanted an XL.
3.0,"I had to send back and reorder a bigger size. I went by the size chart and the first dress did not fit. I could not zip it all the way up. I just got the new size, one size up, and was able to wear it. Although the top is now a bit large. (See pic, where it kind of gaps when i move.) It wasn't available in my original color, kind of disappointed about that. The material is alright and the zipper is cheap."
3.0,"My bad, I didn't even consider it might be just a bit short for my waist.  Guess I'll have to lose some lbs."
3.0,"Returning this jacket. Fabric not flattering on my body type. Size fit, just not what I was looking for."
3.0,"Arrived fast, put it on and set the time. Then hit the light button and my light is broke it only lights up a small part of the screen. Disappointed but what can you expect from a $10 watch"
3.0,Waist band too wide for my liking.
3.0,Very nice jacket. Runs very small.
3.0,"This shirt is ok. It's a bit thin and kind of see through. I love the color, the material just seems to be a bit cheap. Still a good shirt."
3.0,Cheap made but got the job done
3.0,I found the armpit area on this tank to be very large and bulge out. It’s too bad because the rest of the tank was cute. And it wasn’t due to breast size (I’m a 34/36 C so I would think that’s pretty in between and on neither end of the large/small size range).
3.0,although the material wasn't what I expected the dress fit great.  I returned it because it had a couple snags in it.
3.0,Watch band was very hard to put on I actually broke ny nails and the face cover didn't come close to fitting. Disappointing 😞
3.0,A little disappointed the colors look totally different than in the picture
3.0,"I was so in love with these shoes when I opened the box last night, just had to plug my nose to get around the strong chemical SMELL! I put dryer sheets in the box overnight hoping it would help alleviate the strong SMELL, it worked to some extent but not all the way.<br />I was super excited to wear the wonderful shiny Gold Platform Nature Breeze Size 6 Shoes to work this morning! they fit great and were, for the most part, comfortable although the sides of the shoes felt sharp on the bottom/sides of my feet. After the first hour that seemed to go away.<br />At 10:00 AM P.S.T. I'de been wearing the shoes for about 3 & 1/2 hours and the Bottom Insole of the Left Shoe Started to Bunch Up and Come Out Through the Toe Area! Not to Comfortable!!<br />As I Tried to Straighten it out the whole thing came out, so I super glued it back in, I mean what am I going to do? I'm at work I can't run around barefoot or with one shoe! Hopefully, the glue holds and it doesn't happen to the Right Shoe!<br />I Would Give a Higher Rating Otherwise! They're Super Cute but boy do they SMELL!! and now they have super glue SMELL added to it!<br />I'm pretty sure that I would order from Nature Breeze again, Hopefully, the next ones won't SMELL!!"
3.0,It was nice put it dont stay on
3.0,Not satisfied with the quality
3.0,"the sleeves and shoulders are a bit too tight for it being large, it fits like a 10 on me (i am usually a medium), it helps that it's a tunic the stomach area is roomy. the button is made of what looks like a coconut shell. the white is not that white to me.  the creases and wrinkles are not the seller's fault, it came nicely folded but I didn't hang it after opening."
3.0,"Very cheaply made. The pink gemstone was off one earring when I took it out of the bag. The pearl fell off the ring within a couple of hours. Even still, those are easy fixes for me. What I dislike most is that the pink gemstones are screaming &#34;I'm plastic.&#34; Now, I didn't expect an actual, real gemstone, but the quality of the stone (like 25 cent machine rings) didn't seem to match the quality of the pearls. The pearl part is beautiful, but the gemstones bring the whole set down a lot!"
3.0,Will constantly keep the side button pressed calling sos services. However for smaller versions it fits perfectly. Very comfortable and convenient pop in/out design. Loved this band for my previous size watch.
3.0,"I'm not super impressed.  It cam packed all nice and neat but it was so wrinkled.  The cut is flattering- i love the neckline.  It fit ok and material has some give but pretty snug in the hooters.  I had some serious pancake boob.  I think after i hit it with the iron it could be ok.  Does have a small snag in a seam but i dont think it will be an issue.  Siry the picture isnt much help.  The lighting sucks in here.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I test every product before reviewing.

3.0,Didn’t expect to be so big
3.0,"UPDATE:<br />The original product listing was confusing, leading many to think these were the heated version.  I informed the seller and requested they update their listings, which they did quite promptly.  So, kudos to them.  I docked 1 star for that issue, and since they've fixed it I will give it the full 3 stars I rate these particular socks.<br /><br />ORIGINAL:<br />Product title reads:<br />""Heated Socks, Thermal Socks for Men Women, with APP Remote Control Electric Socks Rechargeable Battery 5000mAh Extra Thick Winter Warming Socks Fit for Outdoor Working Skiing Fishing""<br /><br />Item received is neither heated nor remote controlled electric socks.  These are just socks.  So, this review is limited to plain old socks.  I am not a fan of these socks, for their design, materials, or length.  Failing to be clear in their product description also costs them some stars.<br /><br />Bottom line: for the price and construction of the black&white&grey one size selection, they're fine and I would give it 3 stars - neither horrible nor great.  But I dock it 1 star for the confusing and incorrect product description.<br /><br />Personally, I would not recommend this to anyone I know, but if you're into these type of socks then they're okay.  They're certainly cheap enough.<br /><br />So, I will give it 2 stars"
3.0,I like the bag but the back is scratched up
3.0,I use 6.5 and ordered a 7. Fits perfect. The leather is good. Was a good purchase
3.0,"Love how this watch looks and fits. Very comfortable band and great clasp device. The included link removal tool worked perfect for removing one link from each end. This watch looks and feels like a much more expensive watch! I would have given it 5 stars without hesitation but the stop watch timing hand no longer resets back to straight up 12 O'clock. It was working perfectly but suddenly now malfunctions. I really like this watch and am returning it for a replacement of the exact model which is no problem with Amazon, their customer service is phenomenal! I've been an Amazon Prime Member going on three years and will be for life."
3.0,I'm normally a medium or large in tops and I ordered this in a large. I definitely think it runs big. It's pretty long as well and I think looks better tucked in. The material is ok. It is lightweight and I like the print. I just think I could've sized down for a better look.
3.0,Comfortable and do the trick as far as padded shorts (if you don't want tights). Padding however is pretty thin and doesn't really improve comfort by much.
3.0,"Date setting is a little difficult to adjust but great looking watch. Not a long band for man, on the last notch."
3.0,"It's cute, but way too short and very thin. There is no liner under it, so you can see straight through, and since it's so short, I can't find a slip that works with it. I just decided to use it as a swimsuit cover up because I can't wear it as a dress."
3.0,"The shirt was very cute, but I ordered my normal size, XL, and it was slightly large. But possibly how it was supposed to fit? When I went to pull the strings in the side one of them pulled right out. I sent the shirt back. Disappointed in that part of the quality as the rest seemed good."
3.0,"Not comfortable and fits oddly on the face. Got this for my mother, for going out in public. Watched her out it on and it almost pinched her face all the while."
3.0,The concept is great. It is very cheaply made. Mine has glue globs sticking out all over it. It is also bigger than it appears. The packaging was cute though. It came in a pink tulle bag.
3.0,Extremely thin and short but cute. Nice for summer time
3.0,"Fit a little awkwardly and slides up on my head constantly because the fabric material is rather slick. Also when it's folded over like it is in the photo, it completely HIDES the bass logo which is really the main reason I bought this. I wanted to show off the bass clef logo as a bassist but if I want to SEE where I'm going, then the logo disappears under a couple fold overs ---- soooo much fabric."
3.0,"It fit pretty well, surprisingly. However, the first time I went to wear it the straps ripped off while trying to tie the halter around my neck. I guess I'm glad it happened then and not in the pool, at least.<br /><br />If you're busty, definitely reinforce the straps with some extra stitching."
3.0,The shirt was cute but too small.  The large fit my daughter who wears a medium in all other tops.
3.0,"On the small side. If you choose a style that is mostly white, the material is so thin that it is see-through. Overall, ok for the price. (It was around $6 when I bought)."
3.0,Order two sizes up for a fit like in the picture.
3.0,"Just bought it, but it's not a purple color like shown. Even though it does say black. Very misleading!"
3.0,It's pretty and all but the bar could and should be a lil longer. Very tight and a tidbit painful.
3.0,"Not for big heads. I have 7 3/4 and its tight didn't fit me at all, gave it to my son"
3.0,Fit is fine. The top piece bad a medal choker that is very small and uncomfortable. Also the top does not cover much. But bottoms fit well.
3.0,"Shrinks a bit after washing, so buy an extra size larger.  Still fits good, but it got a little shorter and doesn't overlap as much when closed.  Has some loose threads, but overall a decent robe and the fabric feels good and the way it drapes on your body feels like a good fit.  Could have probably been a little cheaper for what it is."
3.0,Dress is cute but you need to wear a slip under it because it is see through.
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful, however, the chain was tangled."
3.0,"I wanted Love this, it’s super cute and soft but just too small for my football player body. Just buy a size up and you’ll be fine!"
3.0,too long formy taste
3.0,Bought 2-3xl. They run small. Definitely not a real 2x
3.0,Cute boots but the smell is so strong. I stuck them outside for a few days and it has helped but I can still smell the strong marijuana like essence on the inside 😂 I washed them and stuck them back out it hopes it dissapates a bit more.
3.0,Demasiado corta
3.0,Decent but very thin
3.0,Very long shipping time. Cute and cheap.
3.0,"Works pretty good, but seems to be on the small side. It’s pretty tight on my armpits & tummy. 😕 Size up!"
3.0,Fabric for the wallet was really cheap. Felt like every time I unzipped it would break. The purse was cute but on the smaller side
3.0,Work for their purpose but they are too tight on my head and give me a headache
3.0,I like the wallet but it looked like more then it actually is.
3.0,Cute but very revealing.... not what I thought...
3.0,"I love these pants but damn it gives me some mad camel toe. For that reason, I simply can not wear them in public. Damn it."
3.0,"The print is exactly what I wanted but there is a lot of scarf here, even though the material is very thin and lightweight.  I guess I didn't read the description close enough because I didn't expect it to be 72&#34; by 42&#34;.  I wanted it to be an accent to a nautical themed outfit but I never did figure out a good way to tie it around the neckline without it being way too much material and being bulky looking."
3.0,"The wristband for this watch is the worst I have ever seen, with plastic so inflexible it's hard to put it on.  Also, the ring around the outside which has the minute numbers on it (10,20,30,40,50) turns and never stays in place.  The face is nice, the construction sturdy and it keeps good time.  Just be prepared to buy a different band if you want it to be at all comfortable."
3.0,Little to much and I am a large woman.  Keeping it anyway
3.0,"Nice scarf, but the color is quite a bit lighter than pictured. That's disappointing because I was looking for a medium green."
3.0,Not bad for price but can see the difference in quality.
3.0,"This strap is good material & quality. The color representation is not accurate, the #36 that I ordered is more of a blue/orange instead of pink/purple as appears in photos.<br />Please indicate if review is helpful or not."
3.0,Adorable. I don't like not being able to pick my size bottoms and top.
3.0,Pretty dress cheaply made
3.0,Only plays one short tune.<br />The young boy I bought it for only played with it for a day or two and put it aside.
3.0,The ball on the top doesn’t close correctly. It turn and turn and never tightens. I only had it for a couple hours
3.0,"The shirt fit well, but the colour is off and looks nothing like the picture. I typically buy more expensive brands but decided to try this because the image looked so good. The saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; definitely applies here."
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous and based on the reviews, I just went ahead and purchased.  I was very disappointed when I tried on the dress and on the back where the pleat is in the middle was just sticking out!  I convinced myself that maybe it was wrinkled and it will flatten out BUT NO!  It looked like I had a tail on my back.  Maybe I got the wrong batch because it looked normal on the pictures I saw."
3.0,I like them but the are a little large for a women.  Fabric is soft and nice.
3.0,"Belt seemed to be of good quality, but the &#34;tan&#34; color was not AT ALL as pictured. It's much lighter -- closer to a dark khaki color than the brown that's pictured. FYI."
3.0,"Very pretty, looks exactly like pic. in discription.  Feels light and possibly a bit cheap material but only a little time will tell?"
3.0,Though the bracelets looked beautiful the fit was so tight!  I will probably cut them appart and restring the beads  so I can wear them.  The wrap bracelets were adjustable and quite pretty.
3.0,"I got this for a decent price so I can’t complain much. They shirt is really cute and fit well but the shorts were a little large and thin, even see through. Looked cheap compared to the shirt. I bought it for my son who wears a 3T.  All in all, I was fine w the purchase. May just throw out the shorts though."
3.0,I really liked these glasses. They are light weight and clear. They are a bit flimsy though. I got these Sept 22nd and the arm broke off. I was at work so I just had to deal with it. If you use them frequently I would look for a stronger kind. That's really to bad because they are so comfortable.
3.0,I have a petite 3 year old who still wears 2T-3T clothing -- I ordered the small and it was a bit tight on her -- beautiful quality but unfortunately needs to be returned.
3.0,They ankle bracelet broke really fast wire them only a few times. One of the toes rings dulled after on week on vacation. Ugh. They were really cute I just wish they lasted longer.
3.0,"I love it's functionality, but the buckle will wear out within about 4-7 months. I have ordered 4 (maybe more) at this point. It's a 5 star product with 1 star build quality. Would love to see a metal buckel, or any other material on the buckle that could last for a few years. Until then, I guess I'll just keep buying a new one a couple times a year."
3.0,I have too much room behind my ankles and the edges &#34;bubble up&#34; in between the lacing holes on the top of my feet. They are cute though and have a good heel height for me as I don't like them too high.
3.0,"I really wanted to love these shorts because I am in need of some comfortable, flattering shorts. Unfortunately, I don't think these are it. I'm usually a 6-8 in clothing, and while the waist of the large fit well, the leg holes are absolutely enormous. I easily have 4-5 inches of space. While I appreciate this from a comfort perspective, they're not exactly flattering. I'm waiting to wash them and see what happens, so I may update if washing them makes it better"
3.0,"Me gusto mucho el articulo, el único detalle fue que traía una de las tiras del pantalón suelta y una costura de la misma tira despegada y como era un regalo que tenía que enviar a Venezuela en una encomienda no podía pedir el cambio del articulo por eso solo le doy 3 estrellas.."
3.0,"I have a lot of “dupes” so can always tell which ones are good and which ones are alright. This looks fine aside from the placement of the logos and the straps are pretty thick in comparison to the other dupe I have. At first glance this is fine but once you get a look at it, you can definitely tell it’s not authentic. I would include pics but I don’t want the listing to get taken down!!"
3.0,"It's a cute dress, but definitely size down. I'm typically a L in dresses and this was wayyyy too big. The pickets were SUPER deep too, and stuck out on the edges. I almost could get a S but maybe a M would work. Very soft though"
3.0,Super pointy toes! You can't tell in the photo how pointy they are. Also are narrow.  Seem to be good quality and if you want pointy boots these would be great m just not what I thought they were.
3.0,It's ok the blue isn't rich in color and material is heavy but attracts lint
3.0,"The design is pretty cool and I liked that I could insert filters and adjust the ear loops, but the mask wasn’t always the easiest to breath through despite allowing water to pass through it when I washed it. Also the mask would fog up my glasses constantly whenever I used it. Anyone looking for an affordable cool looking mask this one is good, but you will get what you pay for."
3.0,"Very cute design, but super thin material; feels like a polyester blend. I'm guessing it's not going to hold up well to washing, but time will tell."
3.0,They are great. Served its purpose. Like most I've brought they tend not to stay intact for long. I do feel they are over priced by $5 or so.
3.0,Very nice necklace but for the mystery metal chain that irritated my skin. Strongly recommend replacing chain.
3.0,This hat looks weird on my babies head. Especially top . But it’s very soft and nice quality
3.0,I thought the $29.00 case I bought for my sister would be better than the $6.00 one I bought for my self. They are identical. The sleeves inside are cheap and flimsy. It was a $29.00 rip off. For anyone reading this I suggest the $6.00 case is just has good.<br />Deborah
3.0,"I got the watch and immediately put it on and loved how it fit on my wrist and the way it looked.  Everything worked great for 2 days when on the third day I look down and the second hand is spinning whenever I move my hand.  Its like it has come off the center cap.  While I don't really care that the second hand doesn't work as it is a digital/analog watch, it just doesn't look as cool and I wont be bragging about my watch to anyone."
3.0,"It's a pretty bracelet but fir the money I paid i would've thought the silver colored parts would've been some sort of metal, not plastic."
3.0,Nice belt for the price.  However I ordered it in a size 36/38 and they mailed me a size 50.  Now have to return it.  But would order it again.
3.0,Mas o menos pero le gustaron y muy caros
3.0,Disappointed in sizing of this item.  I have just lost 35lbs and ordered a size 3X which should have been too large but the dress was somewhat tight.  I kept item because I love the dress look but will need to lose another 35lbs to have it fit better.  Would not recommend this manufacturer to anyone that is not a size 8 or less.
3.0,Alot smaller than I expected. The stones in two pairs have fallen out.
3.0,Very thin cheap material. So flimsy and the lining shows in some places. Very cheap
3.0,The shirt is not exactly as pictured.  The shirt arrived with a 4 inch wide piece of lace down the middle of the front of the shirt.  I think that I can remove it easily.
3.0,"OK jacket, nothing special in terms of quality. They screwed up the right pocket and sowed in a left pocket so I can't use those at all but other than that it is fine"
3.0,These MENS joggers are tiny! I'm a 5'4 woman weighing about 150 lbs and a men's large jogging pant swallow me so I ordered a medium. They look like extra small. The material looks okay but can't wear them to tell for sure. Upsize a lot!
3.0,Bought this is a 3-6 month size and it Feinstein won't fit her until the spring. 🤦‍♀️
3.0,NICE FOR KIDS ART AND CRAFTS
3.0,"I have the same issue as the previous reviewer.  The earring pack shipped is not the one pictured.  The one I received is Loungefly as stated as has a sticker on the back showing the &#34;Dark Side&#34; pack, however the earrings were not actually the &#34;Dark Side&#34; Pack.  Darth Vader, R2D2, C3PO, Stormtrooper, StarWars, and Boba Fett.  No Imperial Symbol, Dark Side or Palpatine.  Bummed : ("
3.0,"Fits my glasses okay but I think the cord should be an inch or two longer.  Some things I wear, the cord has a tough time getting around the collar without the glasses being right under my chin when they are not on my nose."
3.0,"Overall they fit fine, a little snug but I usually like my underwear like that. The high waist was nice for some tummy control. They do sound a bit weird when walking around in them almost like diaper sound or like I’m going to start a fire in them. No leaks though but I wore them during a light flow. I don’t think I’d purchase again if they also make that noise though.. my entire family would hear me coming through halls and stairs."
3.0,"The picture is not the same as the item I received. The straps come in a lot more narrow towards the middle of my collarbone than how the picture portrays which is them coming out near the shoulder like a normal spaghetti strap dress. Pretty dissapointed as it cheapened how the dress looks and would have been cute had the straps been normal. I sized up to a large but it seemed big in the back elastic area causing a lot of sagging. Not too short but cute. The side tie gives the option to loosen or tighten on the waist. I’ll reorder in a medium and hope for normal straps and a better fit. I’m 5’7, large 34DD, 150lbs. Usually a medium."
3.0,"Great color and very soft. This runs small compared to the fit of the picture. I am 5’ 1” and ordered the small and the sleeves are too short so I find myself pulling them down all day. Length overall is okay, just shorter than the picture so size up if you want that look."
3.0,It is very cute but material is pretty thin with no lining. My daughter wears a large but the large was way too big.
3.0,The strap used to make the belt longer does not stay connected so I cannot wear it it pops open
3.0,Cute shirt but cut a bit small.
3.0,bought these for grand kids. most worked but a few were dead or switches didn't work
3.0,Not as cute as I imagined. Wouldn't have bought them if I saw them first. I should have bought L not XL. I'm usually between the two.
3.0,"First of all, it is not a ""dress"" as you described!! Unless you are a very short person!! It is a top, blouse or however you want to call it, but it is not a dress!!<br />The workmanship was good,  the fabric was a little disappointing.  I'm concerned about how it will hold up after it is washed.  I've learned my lesson. No more shopping online for clothes!!  Delivery time took over 6 weeks."
3.0,"The quality was great but unfortunately the hat fit much larger than what it looks like in the picture. Too bad, it was so cute. Had to return."
3.0,"Great quality. Unfortunately, I had to return due to being too small."
3.0,Was small and not great quality
3.0,"Dress looked just as described. However being 5'9 it was too short. The dress came a few inches above my knee and while it could still be worn, for a wedding it was too short. So I had to return it. Otherwise cute dress!"
3.0,Cute. Look great in the front. If you are more than a size 4 they look sloppy from behind.
3.0,I realize it's supposed to be oversized but how large this scarf is its ridiculous! I could use it as a blanket rather than a scarf! When you try to wrap it like it shows in the picture it's so big it covers your face! Basically looks like you wrapped a regular sized blanket around your neck and called it good. Also there is a neon yellow in the fabric that is hard to tell is in the original picture. Not super happy but at least I have a blanket even though that's not what I wanted.
3.0,At 30 degrees I had to use glove liners<br />Cheep China. Bogus advertising
3.0,"It's adorable, but too tiny (miniature), the reason why I kept it was because it is cute and I hate returning."
3.0,"There really isn't anything special about these. They aren't real, but they look nice. They aren't as bright as in the picture but they are a nice stud when I can't find anything else to match."
3.0,"The product is really well made. The quality rates 5 stars. I had to subtract one star because while size L is labelled 29-41&quot;, My 34/36&quot; waist is definitely the limit. I had to take another star off due to a major design flaw....<br /><br />This jockstrap makes me feel like a porn star because my equipment simply doesn't fit into the pouch. I'm a little puzzled because my equipment matches my height, 80th percentile. If it weren't for that one design flaw, they'd be perfect. Unfortunately, I simply can't wear these."
3.0,"I love this hat, but it is a little snug."
3.0,Not the best fit. A little tight around the waist and not the softest or best stretch but I’ll use them.
3.0,Decent quality. Don't expect much or for these to last long
3.0,I have trouble finding any thigh high socks that fit my thighs right. They always fit my calves and not my thighs. Not the sellers fault.
3.0,I bought this based on previous good reviews but am sad to say I didn't find mine particularly nice. The leather strip is overly firm and rather inflexible...it's coated/finished with something that reminds me of a very cheap belt. I expected it to be a bit softer like nubuck. Threading it through the clasp is challenging and the leather &#34;paint&#34; coating is already scraping off the edges. The clasp is truly the only interesting aspect.
3.0,"nice tank  Im a Large, ordered xl and its too small !!"
3.0,"So here i freaked and got 3XL because I read reviews about the &#34;asian sizing&#34; (groan) and freaked out. Its way too big for me and I probably couldve gotten away with an XL.  Other than that, my only complaint is that the material smelled soooo soooo bad out of the package and had to be washed right away. Honestly, I dont have anymore issues, but I just think this is a 3 star product, you know?  Not bad and not great."
3.0,"Fit my toddler well, but we ordered navy and were disappointed that they are actually purple."
3.0,It works but wasn't exactly the same shape as the original lenses.  It is a good price though.
3.0,A lot smaller than I thought it would be and very very little weight like it may be more plastic.  It is very pretty.
3.0,Nice colors.  Very com table.  Not long enough for a dress but good overblouse
3.0,2 of the items have strings coming undone.
3.0,"Size up! Material is thin but, comfortable. I felt it wasn’t flattering to my curvy figure at all."
3.0,"A few months into owning it and the hanger strap tore off. I would attribute it to weight except it’s for my preschooler and she barely carries anything at all. (Change of clothes, pencil case, foam letters, 2 folders). Upon further inspection I notice it tore off because it wasn’t sown into the bag properly. The bag is cute, the pattern is perfect for my daughter, and I even had it personalized for her... but now I have to decide if I try to repair it (knowing I would have to do it by hand) or just get a different bag. I have two other bags same brand/style but different patterns for two of my other children and they seem to be holding up fine."
3.0,My husband wears a xl i wear a medium.v these shirts were moor like a lg.
3.0,"Crappy material, ears are weird. They don't look like mickeys ears."
3.0,With the rings were a little bigger. You really just get what you pay for with the quality of the jewelry.
3.0,Pink bracelet is huge. Black bracelet is tiny. They don't match at all.
3.0,"I loved all of these in the pictures—the colors are bright and the style appears that r would be easy to wear dressed up or down. However, the color is a cheap screen print on thin white fabric and looks it when worn. I’ll be adding this to the “house dress” pile as I certainly won’t be wearing in public."
3.0,Nice silver piece and fit my Pamdora bracelet fine.  I should have paid better attention to the size.  It is VERY tiny!
3.0,"I like it. The colors are good, but it is much more sheer than I thought it would be, almost a chiffon. For the price, it is a nice scarf, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,Rusted quickly.
3.0,"It is soft, warm and cozy. But it has a hole. 😭 I have not contacted the seller, but I will."
3.0,They are good. I wish it had some cotton in it. Also the neck is kind of bulky for me probably because I am a short person.
3.0,Did not really care for the individual toes on the socks
3.0,"OrderEd this since it was inexpensive and I needed a swimsuit just in case for vacation. Has a really strange smell to it even after washing it didn’t really help. Will air if out, if smells still there will n returning. Fit wise it was alright just your basic black swimsuit with not a lot of padding. If you’re looking for something a bit more sturdy on top id spend a bit more money for quality."
3.0,does not give enough support.  the design is cute !!
3.0,"Very pretty, but they write non skid in the description- there is nothing on the bottoms that would make them non skid"
3.0,"I was so excited for this bag to arrive, however it was a huge disappointment upon arrival.  The bag was packaged folded in half which makes an extreme crease that I am not sure how to remove and to even get the bag to stand up on its own.  The bag is much smaller than pictured.  The measurements in the description do match HOWEVER the pictures they use make the bag looks as if it is a beach bag.  This is too small to be a beach bag but could be used as a handbag. I do not think the quality is there either, seems cheap.  You can find similar bags at discount stores for about the same price.  I really would not waste money on this."
3.0,three stars instead of two because how much can I really complain about booties that cost $15? They look like they cost $15.
3.0,"I love the style it's pretty I have a small wrist I like that you can adjust the size  and it's very comfortable. It's kind of annoying to open, and it has small snaps in the leather  on the top on either side of the fitbit holder and one of the snaps keeps popping open. I'm not sure how many times I'll be able to wear it before the snap wears out. If it weren't for that I would've given 5 stars."
3.0,"The shirt was nice, absolutely no problem with the shirt, good product for the money, but because we live overseas it did not arrive in time for the event it was needed for, I should have ordered it sooner."
3.0,"They'll work for my theatre, but they shed a lot of feathers."
3.0,Purchased the product as a gift... Was extremely liked but right away the handles started fraying very badly. So that's the sole reason why I'm giving the product only 3 stars.
3.0,"Should have read reviews before buying. It broke after 4 weeks of light use. Lie the appearance, but is now just a ring that can be bought for $.25."
3.0,this item is not true to size was disappointed
3.0,"The length of the shoe is true to size, but the area along the top of the toes is super tight, like abnormally tight. For $9.99 i figured i would try and cut off the piping around the toe area with a scissor, and it worked, and the shoes did not fall apart and look totally fine, they just have a curvy look to them now, but they fit comfortably. Had these been more than $10 i would have returned, but for so cheap i took the loss and just altered them to fit with my little ones dress up clothes. Wouldnt recommend for anyone to buy them with the intent of an every day shoe."
3.0,"Dress was very pretty, excellent quality.  However, the dress was too revealing for my busy line liking.."
3.0,"About what you'd expect for 10 bucks. I wouldn't cry if i lost them tubing. They are pretty big and the lens quality is blah.  But, you know...they were $10."
3.0,"Hat is really cute but it arrived missing the shamrock that was supposed to be glued to the side. I don’t have time to deal with returning it for another one, so I’ll glue something there. Would’ve been nice if whomever packed it had noticed it."
3.0,"Nice gift, came quickly and in good condition. However, I expected a transparent heart-shaped disc which would protect the photo. If you buy this, plan to replace the photo depending on the amount of wear your key chain receives."
3.0,"I didn't like it. It broke in pieces, the first time i wore it."
3.0,"I am 5'11, weigh 165 and have hips and a butt. Because of my shape I bought a size Large and it was way to big.. I should have bought a size Medium. I have a wedding on Friday so kind of in a bind and will have to wear it too big.. Don't have time for alterations."
3.0,Socks with blue are wonderful. The socks with gray only fit very tight at top so gave them away. I do not have large legs: the banding at the top very tight. Too bad the package does not contain 2 pairs of the socks with blue. Person I gave the gray socks to had same complaint.
3.0,You can definitely tell its not quality ring but again you get what you paid for. Definitely not a steal if your thinking that you got a deal for $499.
3.0,"Love the look of these earrings, however, they're a little on the heavy side."
3.0,"Love the protection these glasses offered until the frame snapped right near the nose. I have tried to super glue back together but they still break. Well, they were amazing until they broke from light normal use."
3.0,This T-shirt is lovely. It ran small. I gave it to my daughter. It fit her perfectly. I guess it was meant for her. She wore it on picture day.
3.0,"I LOVE the fit, but the zipper broke the first time I pulled them up.  I like the fit so much, I'm going to have the zipper replaced.  I'd say they are true to size (others said they weren't)."
3.0,I ordered an extra large. I would normally wear a large. I actually think I could’ve used an XXL. These run very small.
3.0,I have a similar dress that a different brand made and I prefer that because of the way it is cut. This one is okay.
3.0,"This wallet ended up being a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I would never put this in my front pocket. The material is high quality, but it is very flexible and I am looking for something a little sturdier. Nothing wrong with it, just not really my style."
3.0,I really like this item. I love to pull it on and go. The scratch is very forgiving. I took off a couple of stars because the shorts on the inside don't stay down very well. Otherwise I did buy a couple of them
3.0,"Was poorly wrapped. The item was inside a thin plastic which resembled a cleaners bag.  There was a ribbon that should have been wrapped around the robe, instead it was under.<br /><br />The robe also has a stale odor. Had to wash. I feel as if I purchased a used item.<br /><br />I washed, dried and folded my somewhat new robe. Now my robe looks and smells great. I think I need a commision.<br /><br />Overall, it's a beautiful robe."
3.0,White shirt was dirty/stained when it came in
3.0,feel is good however the socks get &#34;stuck&#34; on these for some weird reason...which makes it very awkward.  I wish they had a leather top so it would have the feel of work shoes that I needed to put these in.
3.0,"cheap feeling fabric, and the front hung way too low, and i am fairly tall- returned. i did like the color ."
3.0,"Pretty earrings, but they can be difficult to put on because the post can easily get stuck sideways and not go in straight."
3.0,Tassels fell off pretty quickly but it was very pretty and bright.
3.0,Just a weird mix of tightness on top and uncomfortable looseness at the bottom. Maybe I just needed a bigger rear end to fill it LOL too big on bottom too small at waist
3.0,There isn't enough slots for cards.
3.0,"Its a cute hoodie, love the star design, but the material it's made of is super bad. After washing it and line drying it, the material balled up in to those little lint ball things, they aren't easy to get rid of either, even with a delinter"
3.0,Its Ok but definitely nothing special.  Fabric is a little thin and I think it runs just a slight bit smaller in sizing that other brand similar items.
3.0,Not great but ok.
3.0,"Comfy and cheap, but the drawstring broke after a couple months."
3.0,Love the material but it’s too big
3.0,Smelled kinda funky out of packaging but ok after the wash.  It will help keep me warm which is the purpose.
3.0,"Really cute outfit, but 1st the shirt was too small looks more like a 18-24 month shirt not 2-3 year old. 2nd,the pants were too big or long and my daughter is in the 90th percent for her height so she is tall and these where kinda baggie on her. 3rd the headband does not come as shown, it comes undone and you have to tie it up which was pointless.<br />but over all super cute outfit just not good sizing"
3.0,"I got this band to hold my bangs back.  I use it myself, and got the girls size hoping it would stay better than the other bands I have tried.  It does pretty good for the most part.  Having it tighter does keep it in place better.  I found that if you have it on your forehead, below your hair line, it stays better."
3.0,The earrings are beautiful. My only complaint is regarding the backs of the earrings. They are pretty loose and fall off the stem.
3.0,I wear this on a daily basis and overall it has kept its elasticity but the colour fades and the material loses its vibrancy. one or two doesn't really stretch the way it should.
3.0,This are comfortable and have good stretch.  They are a little to  short for some people.  Need to be an inch longer
3.0,I am a size XL and I purchased an XL. My daughter who is a size Small fit into these. They run super small.
3.0,These shoes are made small
3.0,"I purchased this for my daughter to try. I read reviews and found a cheaper version of the same brand on another website, but reviewers there said to purchase them on Amazon for better quality. I bought her a pair to try and the protection to the back part of the waistband is not there, just like it was stated about on the cheaper versions on the other website. I feel like I paid more for a cheaper version. We were disappointed and won't purchase any more of this brand."
3.0,I love the color of the watch. But at certain times of the day it's really hard to see the time or date or anything as far as the digital part during certain Times of the day. I'm keeping it because the blue in it matches my Mustang
3.0,"The pj set is very nice looking to wear around the house, but for me, the fabric blend makes it unbreathable - therefore I get pretty hot in the night.  I would recommend for lounge wear, but not for sleeping."
3.0,"I love the color and general fit, but it is not as flattering as I thought it would be. The neckline and silhouette are a little conservative. I wanted a fall/winter dress for work and I got it."
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, but it broke after about 5 uses."
3.0,"This set of 3 hats was a good deal for about 10 dollars. However, I ended up returning it since the velcro closure just wasn't what I needed. At time of purchase there was no clear photo showing the back closure. There was also a pretty strong chemical smell when I opened the package, so I didn't want to risk any reactions with my sensitive skin. It may be a good purchase for others. Maybe just air it out and hand wash these hats before wearing (not sure if colors would bleed in the wash either)"
3.0,Never found a pair of skinny jeans that really fit and these are no exception. Not as low rise as I’d hoped.
3.0,Did not fit on my 6 inch wrist! So I sent it back next day. I almost auctioned it off for a profit!!
3.0,I am not sure what to do with the small sized zip pouches that come with the packing cubes.  I gave them to children.  The company could consider providing another packing cube or two and keeping the zip pouches for a more useful value.
3.0,Does not look like the picture. I was Expecting it to be a more soft material dress. The cut does match however the material does not.
3.0,"Not the best googles, they fog and feel kinda cheap. But for the price it works!"
3.0,Nice feel to the material. Pretty design on material. My complaint is it was not true to size it was very<br />Small. I gave the pj’s to my grandaughter.
3.0,They were beautiful bracelets but the string or elastic string wasn’t good quality at all. They broke in two weeks.
3.0,"I really like the bathing suit, just disappointed that the top is sewn crooked"
3.0,"Love the style and color and texture but I'm usually a size 4 and i ordered a LARGE. It's not too tight but since the material doesn't stretch, it feels like it's too constricting. I like it enough that I'll order another color in XL next time."
3.0,Not bad but showed off my fluffy waistline. Fabric is thin and didn’t do much to hold anything in.
3.0,"I liked this fanny pack, the material was thick and durable. Water resistant for sure! But it was way too large for me, I had to wear it over my shoulder- that’s why I gave it three stars."
3.0,I have a yorkie and i brought this in a size medium and it does not cover her all the way
3.0,These earrings are very pretty
3.0,The bag is very nice but too small for what was needed.
3.0,It got the job done but the quality isnt what I expected
3.0,"This dress is pretty, it fits like it should except in the arms.  If you have a little more upper arm then a very thin person, the arms are going to be too tight and uncomfortable."
3.0,"What I expected for $10.00, bill has a bit too much curl for my taste but it got here fast, in time for Veterans D and fits OK. Made in Vietnam, kinda found that ironic. It'll do till i get a better one."
3.0,"I wear an XL (16) shirt...and the largest size of these are too small on me to be comfortable...and SUPER short.<br />Which really sucks, because the material is really nice and they're made really well."
3.0,RThey are good but I wish for the price they would have been a little larger.
3.0,"Cute Boots, but they leave scuff marks everywhere and are not warm at all. I have scuff marks from one end of my building to the next. I guess they'll be good for picking up the dog poo."
3.0,It's too expensive.
3.0,Looked great in person.  But I am tall and the front was way to short. Uncomfortable short.
3.0,"The idea of these is great; however, the product is flawed in a number of ways.  Of course, they're one size fits all so you have no choice in that matter.  I wear a 7.5 shoe and these liner socks squish my toes.  They need better quality control as out of the 4 pairs I received, 2 of them don't match as far as the lace is concerned.  They're totally different.  Also, the first time I wore 1 of the beige pairs, I already got a hole in it and then it came unsewed along the big toe.  (And it's not because my toenails were too long!)  The one good thing is that they don't slip off your heels like other liners.  Just wish they were made better."
3.0,"This was a little on the expensive side, but looked fine."
3.0,"If you wear a large to XL, it may fit snugly."
3.0,Sizing said 11 to 13.  These are more like 13 to 15.  There were like clown shoes on my size 11 feet.  I ended up giving to a friend.
3.0,They do not block all light. But from what I have read about other eye masks none do. So they are a good price and comfortable. When your eyes are closed under the mask it is darker than without the mask.
3.0,"Very lightweight, a little stiff material, and a bit on the small side.  Very short groin/crotch area - and a little on the short side inseam-wise.  Decent enough quality for the price, but would suggest spending more and getting a softer/better cut pair."
3.0,"You’re paying for the Star Wars name. This gun is cheaply made and it is immediately obvious. It’s dirty, paint is thin, the strap was put on wrong. If it functioned it may be worth the price, but it literally is just for looks, but the looks are lacking"
3.0,"Came wrinkled (shipping hazard I suppose), I left it hanging to see if the wrinkles will fall.  It's a tad larger than what I expected."
3.0,So bummed this sat on top of my hair & looked awkward all day. Stopped shaving my hairs a few months back & was looking for something that can hide the times I don’t feel like dealing with my natural hair. This looked super promising but sadly it felt short & awkward. Can’t speak of the absorbency as I only wore it twice to work. Love the packaging & the little note the seller sent me.
3.0,Loved it at first and then first wash the ties on the inside got ruined and now won’t do the bunching in the front.
3.0,Beautiful but no support in the bust. I am a D cup though so ladies who need support may want to look elsewhere.
3.0,Very thin. I hope they last.
3.0,Its good but too small
3.0,"The same cap in black is 22&#34; around the bottom edge.  The blue cap is 20&#34; around the bottom edge.  The black cap fits great, the blue cap is a bit tight. If the VENDOR reads this, please send a blue cap that is 22&#34; around the bottom."
3.0,The top was nice.  The pants looked homemade.  I am a person who sews once in a while and the finishing on the pants was terrible.  The casing for the elastic is too wide so the elastic rolls and twists. I also don't like seeing the hem with serger threads sticking out.  Doesn't take much to turn in the hem and give it a proper finish.  Stitch the elastic to the band or turn under the edge so the serged edge doesn't ruffle.  Won't order from this company again. I can make it better myself and have done so.
3.0,Thin but nice colors
3.0,"Very cute! i had no problem with it so far and for the price I had to buy it, but it is a little to small but I managed to put them in."
3.0,It is nice but personally I don't like the fabric that much but my son loves it .after wash anything wrong happened with fabric and print .
3.0,strap broke after 2 uses but it looks really cute.
3.0,"I ordered the red because I liked the photo, however it’s definitely a primary red and would be suitable as a Little Red Riding Hood cape color.  It’s very long and if you were walking around outside it would quickly be shredded at the bottom.  It’s very thin and cheap and it’s going back."
3.0,"Read the directions before you touch anything.<br /><br />Dealing with remotes before, I never thought I'd have to read the directions. So, my instinct was to put on the metal clips as soon as I saw them detached from the unit. Without thinking, I slid them on.<br /><br />Then I realized that the area to program the remote is UNDER where the metal clip covers. And the clip mechanism makes it impossible to remove the clip again from the remote. I tried to pry and force without damaging the product, and couldn't do it.<br /><br />So, I just wasted money. These remotes are unusable because I can't program. I can't say it's the company's fault, although it would be nice to have the ability to remove the clip like other remotes. It's my fault.<br /><br />But, these remotes are useless now, and I guess I have to buy them again."
3.0,"They are pretty good sock, well made, comfortable, light weights, but they definitely sooo inside my Steve Madden slip on sneakers"
3.0,"A well made shoe but I found it to be a lot less comfortable than I would have liked.  I wanted basically a sneaker feel to a warm boot.  What this is, is a sneaker look to a stiff, winter boot.  Not what I was looking for.  Not a terrible choice, but not what I had expected, and less than I wanted."
3.0,"This product would be SO much better if it were also slimming in the muffin top area. The small/medium gets stretched out and i'm a medium sized girl with 38 inch hips! It does extend the top so I like them, just don't love them..."
3.0,"I ordered one of these for my daughter and her name is Elise, not Olivia, so I now have a rather useless piece of jewelry.  I believe one of her friends is named Olivia, so I guess Elise will have her next birthday present ready to go.<br /><br />As far as the quality goes, it is pretty good for the price.  The chain is sturdy and the name is large enough to be seen from a reasonable distance.  It is a shame... my daughter would have loved it."
3.0,One broke within 2 days... still cute but....
3.0,"I was looking for down coat with no fur, no stitches, not puffy, but to be warm to wear minimum layers of cloth underneath.<br />this one caught my eye immediately. and it  justified my hopes &lt;3<br /><br />only arms are somewhat small, I mean they feel a little bit tight on my arms with 1 thin sweater on. I am between M and L (171 cm / 68 Kg). but I guess I will not need any thick sweaters and cardigans under this coat as it really feels very warm.<br /><br />So, definitely, Yes to the Coat!<br /><br />UPDATE (on Jan 2015): I guess I'm going to regret this purchase, because the coat is too warm, i'd say hot, it does not ""breath"", it keeps all the warmth of the body and when i'm walking I start sweating (my other coats do not make me sweat). and it's not only me, my friend who purchased other orolay coat (Women's Thickened Down Jacket) experience the same issue. Really disappointed :(<br /><br />I gave it 5* when purchased, but now I think it's just 3*."
3.0,Didn't care for them just not what I was looking for but they are beautiful
3.0,Some of these are the cutest earrings I own and others are hideous. Overall you are getting what you pay for.
3.0,The reason I have this 3 stars - the shirt neck hole was way small. My son that loved the shirt and shorts was in years trying to get it to go over his head. No give. Shorts were perfect. I have had to do some major work so he can use the shirt.
3.0,I thought with all the 5 start reviews i couldn't miss on this one but it was too long for me and didn't' compliment my thin figure. For reference I am 5'5  115 lbs and 36D. Had to return
3.0,Not bad for the price. Only Bummed that the purple peeled off within the first week of wear.
3.0,Dress is cute but I’m 6’ 1” and although other reviews made it seem like it would fit - it barley hit my ankles. Bummed I have to return.
3.0,"Madeline Kelly panties are my absolute favorite. I've learned from past experience that they run a little large. I would normally go for size large, but medium typically works great for me in this brand. That said, I learned with these that I don't like the wider band as well. I think for that reason a large would have been more preferred, though I don't know that I could stand them to come up any higher. I also don't like the ribbed fabric as well as the smooth. These are a bit irritating for me to wear. Even though these particular undies aren't my favorite, I still love the Madeline Kelly brand, just with the thinner band and smoother material."
3.0,"The style of these pants is cute but the fabric is more like tights than like leggings.  Plus they do not tell you that the bottom part of the leg is fishnet which I found a little strange.  These are not bad, but not great."
3.0,"I found the 1"" size to be too big and heavy for me, and the chain too long. I returned it and got the 1/2"" size."
3.0,I wanted a dress to wear during pregnancy and the cross front will be great for breast feeding.  I found it fit larger than I was expecting.
3.0,Decent buy for the price.
3.0,Runs small and flattens bum. Cut really weird and lining is too thick. Returned.
3.0,"This is a very basic, functional eyeglass strap.  Seems okay for daily use.  However, I don't know if the strap will hold sunglasses well for an active day at the beach and in the water, as a slight tug seems to release the strap from the arm of my glasses."
3.0,"I'm sure the tag probably says to only wash in cold and let it dry by gently blowing kisses at them, but who does that for gym shorts. When I first tried them on they fit, not as relaxed as I'd like and they did bunch a bit in the front but it was find and I found them comfortable.<br /><br />Then I washed them... Now they are too short, sit too low, and ride up. Plus, the camel toe is extreme... nope no longer wearable after one wash.<br /><br />So unless you plan on line drying your loungey gym clothes, either size up so they have room to shrink or look elsewhere. Too bad too because they seemed well made and I really liked the colors."
3.0,"These fit everywhere else but the heel. I went down a half size thinking if I did, my heel would not slip out but even though the rest of the shoe fit, the heel still slipped. I have narrow feet so maybe this shoe would work better for someone with wide feet. It is a shame because it is very comfortable other than the fact that the heel slips."
3.0,"Lenses were pretty easy to put in. They are good quality polarized, but have a little distortion to them."
3.0,Not as nice as I had anticipated.  Was thinking they would be a little more plush than what they were.
3.0,Beautiful color<br />Sized smaller than expected and fits snug rather than drapey
3.0,"Low quality, thin material"
3.0,"It's super cute, but smells musty."
3.0,"They look really pretty although I have worn them for a couple of days straight and now they started to make my skin green, I guess for the price that is to be expected."
3.0,"I liked the shape and all, but it was way to big for me, I thought they were going to be smaller. And they slid right off my nose, I mean I have a small nose but those rubber stoppers should do the trick, I think they were just too heavy."
3.0,"Pretty handbag....Un fortunately not leather. Also not big enough for me,  so returned"
3.0,"The watch keeps good time so far, HOWEVER, I bought it mostly for the glow in the dark minute and hour hands but, no matter how much light you shine on them, they DO NOT glow. Just be aware. Q"
3.0,"the fit isn't good, and the material is weird and seems to stick to my skin. I like the color though."
3.0,"I like it BUT if you are wearing a shirt that is not tight fitting this will let them loose the way the bra is designed. The nipple covering pokes so it the bra is visible unless you to is thick and tight fitting, Your outfit needs to hold it down. It works great other than that. It does lift nicely and give good cleavage."
3.0,"This is definitely not the length that it shows in the photos.  I'm 5'7"" and it was basically just a shirt length.  The arms are also super tight.  The material is thick, but has that woven almost ribbed feel/look to it.  I'm returning it."
3.0,"Cute earrings with good wires, but very thin silver. They don't show up as well as other, heavier silver wineglass earrings."
3.0,Looks bigger online then when it is rec'd.
3.0,"My coat came with some issues. One of the sleeves is missing a snap.The fit across the shoulders is tighter than I expected for a 2X. The pockets are rather small as well. Difficult to keep gloves or keys in.<br />  On the plus side, it's a nice fabric and very warm. I needed a coat now, so I decided to keep it, but it's not as comfortable as I would like, thus the three stars."
3.0,"Nice, simple bag. When I got it, I didnt like the way it looked, color is kinda blah. Works good as a laptop/work bag though."
3.0,"Looks a little cheap, too &#34;fat&#34; to use, should have been thiner."
3.0,a nice bath suit but was a little small.
3.0,"Super cute and soft, however. The red is SUPER see through!"
3.0,"Arrived on time they fit and look nice, although Its not really a variety pack because I received 4 of the same medium knit even though the picture says &#34;small knit, medium knit, circle knit, and large knit&#34;"
3.0,Hairs are loose and shed easily
3.0,"These have fallen apart somewhat.  They are fantastic, and my wife loves them.  They are easy to wear and super light.  Unfortunately, they have fallen apart rather easily."
3.0,Was not big enough as per my daughter.
3.0,This bathing suit is made for someone shorter or a smaller torso.  Meaning the straps cut into my shoulders and the bottom rides up the butt crack.
3.0,"Laces are very light weight....lighter than I expected.  They function fine so far, but as light as they are, not sure how durable they'll be."
3.0,"Seems to work if it's put on perfectly. Also if the fog is really bad it seems to just ""thicken"" it."
3.0,Ring is not the same color as advertised. The picture shows black accent stones but they are actually pink.
3.0,Very pretty! Nice quality. Even though the size was included they were smaller than I wanted. The blue is beautiful. They would be lovely for a child. I would give them a 5 except for the size. If I had a little girl I would definitely order again.
3.0,The shirt was smaller in chest area
3.0,I actually like this a lot but unfortunately the neck area is a bit tight and the seam that should hit under the breasts hits right in the middle cutting the out poorly.  If the seam was lower and you add a belt it would be perfect.  Lucky for me I sew and will be adjusting the neckline to actually fit me as well. If you are smaller it would probably also fit perfectly and look adorable.
3.0,Simple yet good
3.0,"One of the button springs popped right off second day of use it’s hard to believe they were authentic, still worked fine just that issue"
3.0,"These sunglasses are not bad.  They do have an ombre type of lens (lighter at the bottom) which was not made clear in the description.  Actually, not much was clear in the description, but it was a fun read.  They also arrived in a padded envelope rather than a box.  I will probably give them away to someone who likes “clout goggle” style, since I am looking for darker lenses.  The seller needs to get an English speaker to help with that description.  Seriously."
3.0,Actually I loved it but I just wasted it once and got smaller..
3.0,This was too small.  I ordered according to my actual size.
3.0,"It wasn't exactly white like the picture, more of an off white or egg shell color."
3.0,Its good but the quality isnt that much good. Easy to take anywhere because the wheels are really smooth. I wanted to say 50-50 but there is no way I can give 2.5 stars.
3.0,Love the shirt but oddly wearing it makes me feel like it should be a PJ shirt instead of a casual shirt.I do love the colors and pattern
3.0,"Wish it was slightly smaller, but worked for what I wanted."
3.0,"Got these and there's lots to like, like the fabric choice and the pocket size. There's also one glaring problem. The bottom of the pockets needs to be redesigned. They form a weird outpooching on the side of your leg, like those English riding pants. If you have generous thighs that fully fill out the legs maybe they won't be noticeable, not sure. I'm keeping them to wear around the house for chores, and hoping they redesign that pocket bottom."
3.0,It looks great but my wife wears a med but they were sold out so in order a lg I think there kid’s sizes because she could barely fit in a lg and she’s not but 5 ft tall and a 110 pounds
3.0,OK hat.
3.0,"First and foremost, this dress is soooo comfortable, and the material is really soft. I'm typically around a size 14, and the 2XL was the right size for me.<br /><br />However, the skirt part of the dress is really thin. The transition between the lacy top and the plain skirt is just a flat line across my stomach and is really unflattering on my body. I'm 5'4"" and 190 lbs, and I have a bit of a belly. The thin skirt material form fits to my muffin top, and it just doesn't look good."
3.0,"Shorts were small, my daughter is a 7/8 and she couldn’t get them buttoned ..  disappointing because they are super cute!!! So definitely size up!!"
3.0,more black looking then purple. color is not even close to the picture. also the bar length is longer than listed.
3.0,Looks nice. However putting it on was a hassle. Way to tight and the design on the bottom was annoying trying to get it to look like the picture
3.0,The shoe it’s self is really cute but it’s hard to put on chubby feet. The elastic it has on the front to keep the shoe on doesn’t have much give. But if it was more elastic the shoes wouldn’t stay on. Wouldn’t buy this type of shoe again.
3.0,THe watch is good but the strap is too short
3.0,"Its a nice dress, but as others have said, it's not the best of materials. I did have to do some adjustments to the dress (hemmed, ironed and tightened the arm hole a bit) but once I altered the dress to fit me, it looked really nice! Would recommended if you are a DIY kinda girl!"
3.0,I love the shirt. But it's alittle more snug then I expected. Also the fabric is thin if you don't want your bra to be visible needs a tank top underneath. Still a nice short though.
3.0,"I purchased these and although they are okay, You get what you pay for. The overall BRIGHT burn time was about an hour and then it's just a dull light. They were okay."
3.0,Quality was good.  Sizing runs small though.  It was too tight for my 12 year old and didn't seem to stretch at all.
3.0,One of the eye pieces is soldered wrong so the glasses look cock-eyed.
3.0,Large but short in length and I'm average height
3.0,Fits much more tight than I expected and no real way to loosen it and I've really tried stretching this thing. I have woken up with headaches or had to remove in the middle of the night from just being too tight on me. Disappointing because I absolutely love the color
3.0,"Looks like the description pictures but...Design is dulled by the stretching of the sock, sock looks vibrant when not being worn."
3.0,"It was cute, it was a little tight then I expected so maybe I would go up a size."
3.0,"I ordered this top in white and found it to be too thin and see through. The material is lightweight and comfortable, perfect for warm-hot weather. The cut and style fit well, but I’d recommend ordering a darker color."
3.0,"Most of my jackets, coats, etc. are XL (the same size as this one was supposed to be) & they all fit well. However, this one is a little bit small & I won't be able to wear it with much more than a T-shirt (but for the price, it's OK)."
3.0,They changed it from one piece sole to 2-piece and the sandals don’t fit as well as my old pair.
3.0,Can't get wrinkles out
3.0,"The socks are warm, but much too small., only around ankles. Will not purchase again."
3.0,Pants were a little big and shirt a little small???
3.0,Not at all what I expected. So small. Difficult to shine/clean
3.0,They are not lined on the inside as other gloves do.  So once your hands are wet you can not put them on and hard to take off.  I used them 3 times I do not have time to monkey with them.  Would not buy again
3.0,Cheaply made. I'll use it as a cover up
3.0,Too tight for 5’6” 135# with strong quads.
3.0,tight on the top part. close to the sleeve area
3.0,"Very nice set. A bit on the cheap side, but functional."
3.0,"The top fit fine, but the material was very thin. It looked a little cheap. The neckline also had a flap inside that wouldn't stay tucked in. It drove me crazy when I was getting ready so I ended up changing. Unfortunately, it was not for me."
3.0,This fit me as a crop top not a fan.
3.0,Love the print and colors. Dislike that there’s no memory foam or thickness to the soles. The top has all the cushion. Bottom has none.
3.0,"The style of this dress was just what I wanted, however I did not care for the material. It's very thin and slinky, so you can see every bump and outline. I bought this for a tween and she liked it because it twirled, but I thought it wasn't very flattering with its clinginess and how heavily it hung."
3.0,"It's pretty comfortable. But, it doesn't fit nicely. I do like the color."
3.0,"The product was great. However, runs smaller than I would have liked.  My other pants like this I get a small and they are fine. They fit, but a medium would have probably been easier to fit into. Once the pants are on...they are on haha 😄"
3.0,I really liked this sweater but was too big. I’m 5’0 155 with a large bust. I went with my original size but the sleeves were way too big and long.
3.0,These are OK. I had high hopes to have my elastics stop cutting off my circulation. But these just fall off my wrist and add clunckiness. And the elastics still fall off a lot
3.0,"Cool idea, very heavy and hard to wear for a full night of trick or treating.  Bought it for my 10 year old boy and he wore it about a third of the time."
3.0,"The pendent is real sterling, but the chain is plated sterling silver. I only gave it a 3 star rating because of the pendent. My daughter has an allergic reaction to cheap metals. It turned her neck grayish black and the chain did the same. Good for a cheap kids necklace, but not real sterling silver like they claim."
3.0,Product is really cute but sizing is WAY off. This shirt says on it that it's for a &#34;Grammy&#34; so why is it junior sizing and runs VERY SMALL.
3.0,Cute shoes but not comfortable!
3.0,It works to take to work however it does have a tendency to get stuck and stop
3.0,Fabric and Quality is decent. Sizing runs extremely small.
3.0,Wasn't expecting the collar to be so heavy and clanky.  May have been due to the size being bigger than what i needed.  Girlfriend liked the design
3.0,Runs a little big. Order down.
3.0,tore up fast but it was fair - I put alot of wear and tare on it though
3.0,"Good quality, but fit a little tight and I like them a little loose from the hip. The length was not long enough."
3.0,Not ideal for curvy women - looked like a maternity top/was not flattering at all. Returned.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed by this hoodie. It’s a really thin material that reminds me of Halloween costumes. I thought it was going to be like a normal hoodie. If you’re wanting something warm this isn’t it, but if your teenager is want some cool then this is it!"
3.0,Unfortunately the soles came out after a week or two on both sets for my twin girls. Very disappointed 😔
3.0,Dress is super cute. Material is very thin. This would rock if it was of thicker material. Wear a body shaper under it.
3.0,"These are nice, and I suppose they are exactly as stated; however for me, I don't need the Pushup part, so my fault. I was only looking for a Tee-shirt (modesty) pad."
3.0,My daughter was not happy with it as it was too short. We should have bought a size bigger
3.0,The picks are an add on but are super cheap I just held one in my hand and it broke. I should have spent more on the strap
3.0,Very cheap. Perfect
3.0,"I'm 5'2"" and believe me when I tell you that this dress looked like a literal nightgown on me. If you're tall or if you want this dress to reach your knees, buy it! Everything else about it is great, and it's not see through, but it's huge on me."
3.0,"The pattern is cute. I like the breakaway features at the neck and the fact that you can  remove the keys easily and reattach them.  The clip to hold your keys is so super flimsy, mine ripped apart when it caught on a box.<br />This was not an inexpensive item and I don’t think it should be that flimsy."
3.0,"They do not work with very small binding as I had hoped. They don't lock. But I did not buy the cord usually used with them, so I will have to try that before my review is complete."
3.0,"Received item on time, except some of the gauges were broken."
3.0,The material is great and the 2 pockets is nice. My only issue is the seams don’t line up right. The outside seam runs down the middle of my leg and I have to pull on them to straighten everything out. They’re fine leggings for the money but I would re-purchase.
3.0,This bag is cute but it came all creakily and it has been very hard to de-crinkle it.  It is also very wrinkly the material is just weird. For what I paid I expected a higher quality bag not a wrinkly crinkly mess.
3.0,To cover my face. Did not know these were made in China.
3.0,Light comes from one side and is so dim and turns off right after pressing it. Wish it was delayed and brighter
3.0,"I am 5'1 and 130lbs. I got a medium and it did fit for the most part except the sleeves are a little small. The ends of the sleeves also look &#34;cheap&#34; like they'd rip easily. I gave this 3 stars because other than that, the rest of the dress is put together nicely. I'm not going to wear it to go out, but it is a decent dress for the price."
3.0,"I have purchased four of these dresses so far.  The size small fit perfectly for myself (5'8&#34; and 130 lbs)<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Fit is very flattering, the slight amount of spandex in the garment gives it enough flexibility to not feel restricting in the arm pit area but is also not baggy over the chest<br />-Length ends up being just above the knee which I like<br />-Has held up through multiple washes<br />-Doesn't wrinkle easily (likely due to the high cotton content)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-One of the white dresses I received had obvious brown stains on it.  This could have easily been caught by the seller if they performed a 5 second inspection the dress (which I'm guessing was returned in this state) before selling it again.<br />-The dress I purchased in the color &#34;Army Green&#34; does not match the color in the picture nor the description.  The color is more of a yellow green which if I had known I would have never purchased in the first place."
3.0,Its not perfeclty made.
3.0,"I loved this dress, but I accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrank! Big time."
3.0,Pink was the chosen option and when I got it the stone was actually white. Still very pretty though
3.0,Smaller that anticipated
3.0,These were extremely large. I wear a size 8 standard width. The toes were very long and boxy. It may be because I have fairly short toes though. So far only one type has fit well and those are discontinued. They may have fit better after washing. I didn’t want to risk washing them and then not be able to return them because of it.<br />Thanks to Prime it was super easy to return.<br />They seemed to be decent quality so looks like they would have lasted a long time if they fit.
3.0,"Ordered an XL based on size guide and it's a bit too big for me. It is also longer then I expected, but I think the larger sizing is part of the reason. I'm 5'8 and 175lb, normally wear a 12 or L.<br />The drapeing on bottom is a crooked, and the side seams at the pockets are a bit bulkier then expected.<br />Overall I was disappointed in the sizing and shape, but chose to keep it for the price, and the hassle of returning. I've worn it once and felt very frumpy but the fabric is very soft and cozy, so that kinda made up for the frumpy feeling. I would recommend ordering your normal size unless you are especially busty or broad shoulders/thick arms."
3.0,I love the look of this bracelet but it doesn’t stay closed. It randomly pops off all day long.
3.0,"Pretty good, but I need more compression where the ankle is and this is more just for the calves."
3.0,The post sometimes shows to the front.
3.0,This is pretty but has some weight to it. I didn’t use it because it the bride provided us bridesmaids with large earrings.<br />Had we only had matching stud earrings I would have kept this beautiful necklace.
3.0,"These boots are super cute, and I really want to like them, but unfortunately, they are just a bit too small for me. I typically wear a size 8 or 9 dress shoe, depending on the style, and when I can’t try them on, I almost always opt for the larger size. So, when ordering these I decided to try a 9.5 just to be safe. Unfortunately, that is still too small and the toes in this shoe are extra pointy, causing my feet to be squished up and uncomfortable. I tried to make it work for a few minutes but walking in these was so uncomfortable that I had to get them off my feet. The heal is so high you are basically walking on your tip toes, and when your toes are completely squashed it quickly becomes unbearable. If you’re used to this kind of torture and are okay with sacrificing bone and muscle structure for beauty, then these really are a great boot, but if you need just a little bit of comfort, I would suggest looking for something else."
3.0,"When I’m on the hunt for something particular, I want exactly what I want. So this scarf is not all black and white. It has a brown stripe and another lighter stripe color. The scarf is soft and lovely but it’s going back."
3.0,"Gloves are overall ok. I bought these for LE use because I hate touching gross people and it's cold outside. I got these because the rubber grip was interesting for holding on to id cards and firearms. I found that when I take these gloves off they scratch the heck out of my hands. It's the hook side of the velcro strap that causes this. I fixed it with some medical tape for now but its annoying. These will likely end up as back up gloves because they are too bulky to carry in a pocket and they are thick and hard to feel things while wearing.<br /><br />I think these gloves have interesting qualities, might not be for me or most cops."
3.0,"I'm 5'10"" and this thing went down to the floor. In the photos it looked like it is mid-calf length, but in reality, it's much longer."
3.0,"This shirt was ok. It fit kind of large on my daughter. She is 4ft11 and to me it looked kind of large. It was made from that material that if you didn't wash first in heavy fabric softener it would itch you to death. Also it does on stretch or give. The crochet lace made it hard to put on with fingers and jewelry getting caught in the loops. It was way too small for me to wear being over weight. My granddaughter is about in between us both and wore it fine but was still too long on her. This shirt is not &#34;one size fits all or fits most category&#34; Didn't have a to big of Wow factor with us but it was still passable for a medium built.<br /><br />**I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased, honest opinion. I am in no way affiliated with the company that makes and or sells this product. The thoughts and opinions here are my own, and I never guarantee a favorable review.**"
3.0,not as nice looking as i thought it would be
3.0,The material is kind of heavy. Looks pretty
3.0,The games that were advertised were not on the watch
3.0,"THEY'RE FOREVER BRAND. So, if you, like me, have ordered this brand in the past, find their shoes to be cheaply made, uncomfortable after long periods of wear, and now actively avoid purchasing this brand, be aware that is exactly what they are. As are the boots on 3 or 4 other pages selling the exact same boots without disclosing the brand.<br /><br />They are cute boots, they look nice on. Which is the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But they are cheaply made, not very comfortable, and the page conveniently omits the brand of the boots."
3.0,Very cute but run a littke small and a bit short.
3.0,not as pretty in person
3.0,"Once they are on they are delightful, but then you gotta get them off. Ugh!"
3.0,"Unnecessary use of plastic packaging.  The wasteful packaging is not as bad as the PED socks but not as good (earth friendly) as Dr. Anison socks.  The Dr. Anison socks came in a simple thin cardboard box.<br />Other than the plastic packaging, which we should all take issue with, the socks are ok."
3.0,Very nice item. Silver covering on plate scratches off easily revealing copper/brass color. Took it off to keep from ruining it altogether. A bit disappointed.
3.0,They are too silverwarish for me.
3.0,This is a great looking tie bar. But it snagged two ties and ruined them. You need to be VERY careful putting it on.
3.0,It’s really small for 22 bucks but kid likes it 🤷‍♂️
3.0,VERY VERY SMALL.  Pretty sure they are made for children.  But I have learned a valuable lesson.  Measurements measurements measurements.
3.0,Was not what I expected. Ordered for my son to use in cold weather for riding but they aren’t what a true motorcycle person would use. Will return and try again.
3.0,Fabric much thinner than anticipated<br />String provided for lacing wasn't long enough<br />Fit was otherwise fantastic
3.0,Causes bumps for those of us that are allergic  too fake material.  Can only wear white gold or silver products.
3.0,"The quality of the material isn’t great & the print on the dress is not as nice looking as the photos listed. I was going to return it, but missed the return window."
3.0,I got this sweater for my granddaughter for Christmas. She absolutely loved it it fit her perfect. But one of the sleeves was not sown together. So we had to have it altered. That is the reason for three stars.
3.0,"I like this watch, however at times it's hard to see the time.  The white on white background is a little difficult to see for me, but I get a lot of compliments on it.  I just wish the battery didn't die so fast."
3.0,"I loved this fabric and it's lovely fit and color, but I had to return as there were a bunch of unfinished seams- I might try to buy it again and test my luck."
3.0,These fit like clown shoes. They shed sequins like crazy. They were for a Halloween costume and I had to see them to keep them from falling off. For a one time use it's ok.
3.0,"I use this eyeglass holder fairly often; however, this one loosens easily so that I have to constantly check and tighten the coil to the loop.  Otherwise, my glasses tend to back out of the loop and fall from my neck if I am not careful, meaning that I can very easily lose my glasses."
3.0,Decent jacket for the price but I was disappointed that it didn't have pockets. I usually wear a small but decided to order a medium because I don't like my jackets too tight. The medium turned out to be pretty snug. The sleeves were the right length though so I'll keep it.
3.0,"First and foremost, NOT LINEN. The label says 65% cotton 35% poly. Feels like viscose. So that was disappointing (linen is my favorite for hot weather--no AC). But I still really loved this dress. It was very flattering and stylish, with both a true wrap skirt AND an underskirt, so you don't have to worry about flashing anyone on a windy day. The color is rich and bold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it shrank at least a full size washed warm and dried cool. I live in country, and I think dry cleaning is<br /> too expensive/environmentally iffy, so don't keep anything in my wardrobe I can't machine wash (that includes my own handspun, handknit sweaters and even commercial cashmere--my frontloader is gentle).  Now it's tight and ill fitting. It shrank in both directions, across the hips and now the waist is rather too high. I'm keeping it for now because I've been slowly trimming down over the last year or so, and it may yet look good on me, but it will probably go in the donation bag. I you intend to machine wash, size up, and know you're taking a risk."
3.0,The material is on the thin side so I had to wear spanks but got a ton of compliments at the office
3.0,The band itself is OK but I was disappointed with the narrow width on the 44 size watch.  It looks less substantial on the watch and wrist than I inferred from the photos.  It is less wide than the nylon loop band that comes with the watch from Apple.
3.0,Looks great band doesn't seem like leather though.
3.0,I almost think it’s just this color that has this material.. but I got the camo black. It’s the type to fade a bit and get a little fuzzy overtime. Idk just not my favorite material for these. & the zip pockets up front definitely feel on the flimsy side. For record though I’m 6’0 185-190lbs. Mediums fit me just fine if not a little short.
3.0,"I knew the earrings would be small, but not as tiny as they are.  I did not realize the  band was only about 1mm wide, making it difficult to see the zircons.  They fit as expected, just around the earlobe, but the narrow band is just too small.  The description did not include the width of the band.  I will have to find a child with pierced ears to give these to.  I regret the purchase."
3.0,"I have a small feet, but for some reason some of these socks are too small and some are fit as expected. I’m still able to wear some of them. The patterns of these socks are cute which I like. I would recommend these if they can fix the sizing. I couldn’t return them since I washed them right away when I got them."
3.0,Better shirts out there
3.0,It's ok for the price !!!
3.0,The collar is loose after 2 x of use.
3.0,"I am 6'-1"",  250 Lbs, and I usually wear XL, but this jersey is just too big, It's a little bit wider than other XL jerseys I have bought before, and the sleeves definitely need to be shortened down a bit, I am returning it and having to buy from a different seller because they are out of stock on a size Large."
3.0,"Very comfortable tri short but after 1 wear and 1 wash, I noticed the inside of my leg was already wearing the color away. Not the happiest customer about this but they are super comfy"
3.0,"This shirt looked really cute in the pictures, but in person... It's really hard to describe. The material feels really cheap and weird. My daughter told me she thought it was some kind of swimsuit, and then my husband came home, he also said it looked like a swimsuit blouse until he got closer and then he just thought it looked like the fabric mumus are made out of. It also slides completely off of one or both shoulders. I am pretty disappointed about the fabric because the pattern and colors are actually really cute and I would normally love it. I also discovered that you can see through the white parts. I was wearing a very light pastel lavender camisole under it and you could see the color through all of the white areas. Ironically, I will probably end up wearing this as a swimsuit cover instead of a blouse because I like the design and colors too much but don't really want to wear it as a shirt now."
3.0,"Pretty, but too big. I followed the chart, too. I had the laces as tight as they would go, and the top was still way too loose and baggy. The top layer of fabric was also a lot longer than the lining. I’m 5’6”, and even with 5” heels, the fabric was dragging the floor. I’m returning it."
3.0,Very nice for the price.  Not sure if it is an everyday necklace
3.0,The pocketbook has no give and no interior space say for a cell phone but so cute!
3.0,"Its cute, just make sure you read the description to the bottom! DOES NOT COME WITH CHAIN. Lol woops!"
3.0,"Other than that, there's nothing really special about it. The fit is okay and the look is okay."
3.0,I just never fit properly in these because they came a bit too small.
3.0,Can only be worn as a top and not a jacket.  I should have ordered two sizes up. Will keep it as I am losing weight and it will eventually fit as a jacket.
3.0,"Great pattern. The shirt is very see through, it will need a tank underneath. I ordered a small & the shirt is very big on me. I'm 120lbs."
3.0,Pretty earrings but backs didn’t fit
3.0,"Material is like more like tweed/than wool and everything sticks to it, too thick and warm for using for working out or sport, runs very small.."
3.0,"The purple pair isnt as bad, but the pink and orange are pretty see through. You can see crack and tat and all. NOT SQUAT PROOF!! I wear them with big shirts on arm days and just prayyyy that I dont have to bend.<br /><br />The colors and fabric are super cute, not very shape flattering on the butt. Very comfy!<br /><br />The do roll down on the waist but not too bad considering the price."
3.0,"Love the shirt, but this one fits smaller than the other colors I’ve purchased in the same style."
3.0,Would have been five star if I would have actually gotten assorted colors as expected. Only got black and gray...would not have paid for that if I knew.
3.0,Hard to put on and feels cheap. But it’s what I expected.
3.0,"Pretty, but not sure it's really gold plated.<br /> My daughter reacts to anything other than gold and she had a huge reaction. Still a decent price for 3 pretty earrings."
3.0,Took four weeks to receive.<br />The blue matches the photo but the silver in the middle has a yellow tinge to it.<br />The fit is like a normal ring although it is a bit thick and heavy.
3.0,"Nope. I mean, they stick on...and maybe don't pucker too much if you practice putting them on, but they don't lift enough.  It's like walking around with these things sort of hanging on. And, I'm a B cup, at best..probably an A.  I bet I could duct tape them 'up', but at what point are they no longer strapless?  I practiced a few times, but never felt 'held'. Maybe it's the type of tops that need this type of bra, but just not enough support for me. Maybe I'm too old (50).  Maybe there should be a 'suggested age?'  :)"
3.0,Small and see-through
3.0,"The print was fuzzy, plus the shirt was too small even though I went by the sizing chart provided. It’s wearable, just a little snug."
3.0,The right sleeve & cuff was sewn on wrong
3.0,"Just okay. I was looking specifically for Daisy earrings, and these were the closest thing to what I had in mind. Decent size, not too large, but the quality and coloring could be improved."
3.0,"Chart is Way to  big. Had to cut off excess. If u don't have a lot of room to hang, don't buy."
3.0,"Fames seem a little cheap. But look, fit, and lenses are as expected. At least they came with a case so I you can protect the delicate frame when they arnt on your face. I will say good deal since I tend to break sunglasses anyway and was waiting the ray ban style without the cost"
3.0,leather is not as good as I expected
3.0,One don't snap
3.0,Not happy with the materiaL.
3.0,I returned the item that I purchased and was never reimbursed.
3.0,Seems like it is for a child of about 8-10 years old
3.0,"It did not fit as a women's small, rather like a junior small"
3.0,"I,as a parent, liked that it is durable. My son liked thebsize and thatit seemed real. What I didnt like, nor my son, was that it didnt come with the wooden block that its pounded on.  Would have made it more complete."
3.0,The blouse was elegant beyond what I expected. It tends to run about 2 American sizes to small.
3.0,Pretty disappointed that this hat is an iron on decal and not embroidered or a patch.  Probably going to return…
3.0,"It's kind of low quality, but I got what I expected for the price paid. The pants are simple cotton fabric. My biggest complaint is the pockets, which are not really pockets but sort of like shallow grooves in the pants that end up folding themselves out and looking weird. Other than that, it's a cute outfit. The headband was way to small for my 3 year old's head, but she has an abnormally large head (sorry honey but it's true and I love you)."
3.0,"It’s true to size, breathable and comfy."
3.0,"Panty is different than shown, and runs smaller than usual. Nice soft material."
3.0,This was too much curve for my feet which tend to be low arch. They're fine for sliding on to run outside for a minute but not for walking any distance if you have very low arches.
3.0,"A coworker had a pair of these.  She lives them.<br />I ordered 2 different styles in the same size range.  Once pair is too big, one pair is too small.<br />I wish there was a store where I could try them on to find the right fit for each style.<br />Now I have to pay almost $12 to return both pair."
3.0,It's looks like more of a white fleck on the nose than colorful opal like in the photo. Also a bit too thick. I thought it was 18g.
3.0,I didn't quite like the fit it was just right in some place but other places it was too big
3.0,"I bought this dress with Hope's that it would be long enough but when I put it on its was fine forthe most part. The straps where a bit to long so to pull it down where the straps met was way more revealing that I wanted. The dress I'd beautiful however it didn't fit as snug as I was hoping for. I didn't even have to undo the zipper to get it on or off. The length was ok, but with heels on it would have been too short as opposed to every other review I read they said the length was too long."
3.0,the red isnt as dark as the pic. the earrings are still pretty though
3.0,Lighter weight than what I was looking for.
3.0,The face of the watch is really nice chrome looks good it’s built pretty well so far I like it but it said it was leather band and it is not it is more of a suede material which is disappointing
3.0,"Nice ring, but stone sits higher than it seems like it would. Great for the price .haven’t got it wet yet to see if it stains finger."
3.0,"The proportions of the dress are a little off. The bust is too large. I would go for a size larger than you need, but expect to alter the bust size if you are a size C or less."
3.0,"Took forever to arrive, and the floral layer had little snags in it. I kept it I didnt really want to go througj trying to return it."
3.0,Its alot bigger than what u think lol
3.0,"Shirt was a little tight and not long enough. I would suggest buying one size larger. The material was a little thin also. I like shirts a little longer and looser. The shirt was not terrible, but I would not purchase it again. The style of the shirt is cute, just not exactly what I expected."
3.0,Product arrived on time. It fit smaller than expected.
3.0,They are very comfortable and super cute. They fit a little small.
3.0,"When it FINALLY arrived, 3 days past the promised delivery date, I opened the huge envelope and almost tossed the plastic packaging away with all the debris in the envelope.  Talk about tiny, You almost, and barely can see the Red, White and Blue design on the pendant!  It is a small, small charm to best describe it.  I think making it a little larger would have been easier and cheaper to make. Won’t be buying it again.  Need something to see when wearing the bracelet.  Save yourself some $."
3.0,"I am returning this handbag, there is nothing faulty on the bag but it is too large for the person I was giving it to."
3.0,Pocket flaps are weird. Fit as expected.
3.0,Nice material and good fit but if you’re looking for compression order a size smaller than you normally would.
3.0,They do the job but if your baby has chunky legs they roll down
3.0,Holds cards well enough. The money clip was garbage. Didn't hold bills and eventually snapped off. I don't often carry bills so it hasn't been much of an issue for me personally.
3.0,"It is a normal size infinity scarf, however the lace on it is a different color white than the whole scarf. Wish it was the same color - still looks nice though. When wearing it you can't tell a lot of the color difference if you twist it around."
3.0,Okay. Work fine. I like the attachable sunglasses lenses.
3.0,too small but i gave it to my daughter so it worked out
3.0,"The earrings are just as pictured! They even looked great in my daughters ear, but it is only for a 1 day wear, do not sleep in them! the edges cut into my daughters ear to the point her ear was bleeding and had scabs the next day."
3.0,I like the straps except the grey one. The peg came off the grey strap. I would like a replacement for that strap only
3.0,Just little bit small I wish they have sizes to choose and more colors to choose.
3.0,Make sure you're completely bald ouch it not suppose to be hair stobble removal
3.0,Cute pajama pants
3.0,It's so tiny. I expected it to be much bigger. Smaller than a dime. And even the chain is tiny. One of the pics is not accurate at all
3.0,The dress is cute but cheap material.
3.0,"This shoe is overall good. It heightens me by 3.5 inches (NOT the advertised 5 inches) AND YES, I measured.<br />The downside is that it is very uncomfortable to walk in. Imagine walking on high heels. pretty much the same.<br />Still it does the job and makes you look taller, so cant complain too much."
3.0,Really cute but too small they cut off the circulation on my daughters feet. The quality is great but the elastic ankles are so tight I can't put her in them. I am so sad because they are precious!
3.0,"The shoes are very cute, but large.  I measured my daughter feet and ordered according to the size chart.  The first pair was way too large.  I returned them and got the size down and this pair fits much better, still a little big though."
3.0,very light. see through. not stretchy at all. Very cute style. not true to size; runs small.
3.0,Bought the shirt and pj combo that I tho if not said “dreams loading” but it came in as “dremas loading” I have no idea what dremas is but it was too comical! I kept the combo bc it’s only pjs and won’t go out in them.
3.0,"I looked at the size chart. I sew, so I know measurements. I ordered a large accordingly. The item says large on it, but it is a medium. I may have to exchange it. Other than that, it is well made. This matters a lot, because you never know what quality something will be when ordering online. Also the lines and patterns are particularly cool looking; it is better looking in person than the picture."
3.0,It's ok nice watch but sorta on the cheap looking side
3.0,"It would be nice to know what height model they use for &#34;over knee&#34;. I'm 5'8&#34;, and these are comfortable as knee socks, but if I try to pull them above my knee, they aren't quite long enough."
3.0,very fine cotton fabrics. But it's little bit in loose side as opposed to size M
3.0,The shirt design is nice. it is a very casual shirt. If u pick one size larger than what you are - the shirt will droop down.
3.0,Really like the bag and it's look but beads started coming loose after first use.
3.0,They are just ok. Fit weird in toe box… support ok.
3.0,it's good to hold your key but the hook did not last long.
3.0,"This item was very cheaply made, but you cant expect too much from something that costs a dollar.. still a pretty cool piece for the price"
3.0,Not sure if it’s the type of fabric or what…but I first tried this on at Tillys and the bottom half of the shirt was stretched out. Bought one on Amazon and the neck is stretched out after one wash.
3.0,"The key finder is a good idea however, I tried it on two different purses and both times it fell out and off my purses"
3.0,"I’m 5’2” and got a size small, it ran a little large and didn’t really sit right."
3.0,too low in my waist.
3.0,"Does the job as a white work shirt, but I really don't like it. Stick with George whatever brand that is. The collar is not thick enough, and I almost have to shove the tie in it for it to not stick out. The sleeves are baggy and weird to roll up. Not a fan, for 25 a pop. Also it doesn't seem to be wrinkle free, like my other white shirts."
3.0,"I purchased this cosmetic bag in the beginning of September and took it on a trip in October. It was a great size and I loved the way I could hang it up and see the items inside.  When I returned from my trip, at the end of October, I noticed that the netting on one side of the bottom section had separated from the seam. It had not been manhandled or abused on the trip.  When I tried to return it because it obviously is defective, I was told that the bag had a 30 day return policy so I would have had to have returned it before my trip.  When I looked for a way to contact MaxFly to make it right I was unable to find any contact information.  If this product had not been defective I would have given it 5 stars. I am very disappointed."
3.0,Glass broke quickly
3.0,Purchased for my son's halloween costume.  It's cheaply made and you have to stuff something inside the hat to get it to stand up.  He also said the hair kept shedding.  It's ok for a short term costume.
3.0,"Runs small, sides are SUPER see through. Comfy material though."
3.0,"Beware that if you need 100 pieces exactly, you may want to get extras. There were only 98 in my pack and 3 of those were broken or bent. Still a very good deal for what I needed since I didn't need that many."
3.0,Wide but too short for my 18 month. One of the shoes keeps falling off yet his toes are hitting the front of the shoe. They look comfy otherwise but just not working for us!
3.0,"Like this, and it was cute for awhile until it broke two weeks of having it...."
3.0,Quality not great but good for the price
3.0,"Ignore the size rating above. The legs are snug, but an odd fit. The wast is very high and very chunky. The price is right so I will be cutting out the chunky elastic, and altering the waistline."
3.0,"The shirt was true to size and picture,"
3.0,"Very pretty wore it twice,  the white material  gets dirty easily"
3.0,Looks great but one of the hip straps broke after the pool. The quality isn't the greatest but the price is perfect!
3.0,"This fit beautifully, was good quality material, but I ultimately sent it back as it was too frilly for my style."
3.0,It’s super long I’m 5’6 and no matter how much I pulled the legs up i kept stepping on it
3.0,bought them for my daughter for christmas..  who would have thought that poop would have been this big of a thing
3.0,It was a bit larger to my liking
3.0,"Nice stones and color variance. The chain and size of pendant are bit too large, but I was able to make it work. You will most likely have to reglue the stones on, because the adhesive is not very strong."
3.0,"the style is not quite for me, but they are cute on my Granddaughter"
3.0,"The fit is a little tight, but wearable."
3.0,Just smaller than the size so ordered a bigger size
3.0,"My son's baseball team each bought one of these necklaces.  The plastic clasp is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well to use.  I've had to create a new tie on it so he can continue to wear it for the remainder of the ball season.  Otherwise, it's attractive and the boys love wearing them."
3.0,"Really liked them the first day, but they pilled between my thighs just wearing them around the house for a couple hours. Fits nicely at 5'3&#34; 145 lbs. Since they are so ugly with pilling I now just wear them out in the woods and riding my horse and the fabric withstands the wear and tear except for the cosmetic damage of the pilling."
3.0,"update! My daughter love it!. One of the shoe light didnt last long, quick refound!"
3.0,"Love exoficio , but always forget the sizes run so big.and there is NOT a smaller size in this skirt. Otherwise, it would have been great!"
3.0,"really cute earrings but they sent me the wrong ones! no emperor, darkside ones ,imperial symbol instead i got c3po,r2d2 and star wars . ;-;"
3.0,Great design.....horrible quality shirt. Too bad...I really wanted to wear this but it's not made for one who is rough.
3.0,"These exercise pants might be fine for people with somewhat skinny legs. I am not one of those people. I had to do considerable pulling and tugging to get the lower part of the pants over my calves. It is not something I would want to do in order to use the pants. Other than that, the pants seemed OK. Possibly a larger size might have solved this problem."
3.0,I really liked it at first and held up for like 3 months until the part that tightens the main big pocket to the backpack fell apart so the only way to close it is by tieing the strings together which doesn't really work as well. It was ok just didn't hold up long enough for my liking but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Ordered size L, looks more like a M.. The material looks like it may stretch to fit."
3.0,"I love the pattern of the vest. It seemed cheaply made, though, and was bigger than I expected it to be."
3.0,"I wanted to love these leggings so much, but they gave me an awful camel toe. The actual fit everywhere else was great, and they were really cute. I just wish they would have work for me."
3.0,The package came missing a Magnetic iwatch Band ( the black )
3.0,my first impression was that this was a cute necklace set. After I used it for a while it started to turn green. This necklace set broke apart in a few weeks. Do not waste your money on this set.
3.0,love the watch but the seller had bad batteries in the watch. had to replace them
3.0,Was not what I thought! Very flimsy.
3.0,Fall down super easy. Constantly pulling them up
3.0,It's very cute but very heavy. Don't think I'll be wearing it all that often which is a bummer.
3.0,I have not had a chance to wear this jewelry but I like the look.
3.0,"I really loved this when it arrived.  It looked like the picture.  Very pretty, romantic and yet professional too. I was concerned because it was thin and after one use the seam in front let go. So I got to wear it once and don't think I can sew it due to the thin material.  I really liked the product and was happy on how it looked on me. ( I am a plus size 2x).  I never got a chance to wash so I don't know how it holds up after washing."
3.0,I like the dress and its comfy but the material is see thru thin
3.0,"Its a quality product, but the title &#34;Wallet&#34; is misleading. I returned it. This is a very nice money clip."
3.0,Shorts are very thin. Almost see-thru. Don't like them because of that factor.
3.0,"These did not fit as expected.  They have very little elasticity and did not allow much freedom of movement.  Also, the left pocket had a hole in it.  I agree that the material feels nice and soft next to the skin.  Best for slender athletes."
3.0,The fit is perfect based on their provided measurements. The material is VERY thin and will be seen through. Luckily I picked the light grey colored gress which didn't show too much of my pale skin where as the black dress would.
3.0,"Run large. Otherwise, decent quality for the price!"
3.0,Wasn’t super impressed with these. Had to return as they are  Definitely a little on the big side.
3.0,"This case is soft & nice looking. However, it's 17x17, an odd size and no pillow fill is sold in that size. So I needed to sew ut smaller to prooerly fit over a 16x16 pillow. Extra work but still a good buy."
3.0,"sufficient for the price, would've been nice if we could've inserted the battery ourselves, because there is no telling how long that battery has been in there or how long it will last now, since it's been running since manufactured??? who knows."
3.0,"They fit well on med/large, but do not have any compression whatsoever. My hand swells from daily activities and these gloves do nothing"
3.0,"Pants are a decent quality, medium weight fabric. Pockets are cut small. Fit well when on, but not enough elastic give in waist to get over hips/butt....it might be a me thing, but they're cut pretty tight through that area."
3.0,"This is a really nice bathing suit, however, you'd have to be very short wasted for it to fit. What I didn't like was having to pay for the expense of returning it in a way that had a tracking number. It cost me about half of the price of the suit."
3.0,I haven’t put them in yet but they seem like good quality and are nice.
3.0,Cute shirt but fits a little small
3.0,"ok for the price, 100 % cotton"
3.0,"Ordered medium classic fit, runs very small"
3.0,The right pocket just came apart from the jacket over time.
3.0,Emblem broke off quickly.  Now they look ghetto
3.0,Material was too sheer; (thin)
3.0,"It is super cozy sweater. One of my favorite sweaters but beware, it is super flammable. I was cooking and my sweater no where near the flame and it started to burn. I wish they still had the olive green one in stock so that I could replace it."
3.0,"A few were broken apart or didn't work. But the rest working amount was enough for me.<br />Just consider that if you need exactly or around 40 - you ll probably need to order an extra bag for such case.<br />They are cheaply made, but the price is good anyway."
3.0,"Great shoe, seems very comfortable, super easy to get on and off because BOTH sides have the hook-and-loop closure. I gave three stars because after about an hour total of wear, the hook-and-loop closure keeps coming open, causing toddler boy to lose his shoe and sometimes trip and fall."
3.0,Came very wrinkled. Not sure if it can be thrown into the dryer. I normally wear size 0 or xs in clothes and this was a bit large on me. Length was okay (I'm 5'4).
3.0,This insert is better than having nothing at all in the bottom of my purse. I wish it were a little wider and a little taller. But it is ok.
3.0,"It came a month before expected and that's great , they just sent the wrong one. it was a clear basic tumblr looking one. Either way it was a gift for my sister so I ended up giving it to her not my style but she LOVED IT SO It was worth it lol"
3.0,"This is a little different.  I thought that the arms would be sort of flowy too, but the arms are flowy around the shoulders and underarm area, but then get tight from the elbow to the wrist.  It looks and feels al ittle awkward.  I hope I get used to it."
3.0,These are very nice but way smaller than stated not true to size.  Overall Quality is Marginal.  These are all lace!!! and visually tasteful.<br />These have a large elastic band at the top.  Stitching is marginal.<br />if you found this helpful please indicate...
3.0,This ring is absolutely gorgeous. I loved it! Until one day I looked down and saw the area where the ring was on my finger was green/grey. I take it off before showers and before I wash my hands and it still turn my finger green/grey. Great ring for the price though.
3.0,Cute but no photo protector included in locket
3.0,"They really are no darker than any other glasses that I have bought. I bought because they said they were super dark. Nice glasses, but no dark."
3.0,"Totally not for working out, but flattering for a nice night out"
3.0,I'd give it more stars if the length was consistent. The red is shorter than either the black or green.
3.0,Fits a size and a half too small or maybe it's supposed to be super snug. Idk.
3.0,Wud av been better if it was cotton..or a bit thicker
3.0,These shoes are so cute and fit great and seemed comfortable for my daughter to wear. The Velcro on them isn’t very strong. They stopped staying latched after a couple weeks.
3.0,Ordered white and you can see right through it. So you would have to wear something underneath.
3.0,It fit as expected. However I ordered long sleeves and received short sleeves.
3.0,Great material. Sturdy yet classy and delicate. Looks bigger in the picture.
3.0,Runs bigg and not best uality
3.0,Product is sized small
3.0,"I would like to say this is a great product..however it is to big for my 5 almost 6 year old. It falls down off of her nose and mouth and obviously during ""COVID"" times this is unacceptable.  The print is adorable which is very unfortunate, she was very excited to wear something more comfortable to school."
3.0,"Looks great and my wife loves that. Clips that took to fit 2 are another story. Silicone is good, and the colors and design are holding up. However, I have had to screw the clip back on to the band 3 times before adding some glu."
3.0,"Bought the ombre grey pair and at 5'9&#34; was seriously disappointed that the light grey reached up to my knees. Not quite the ombre I expected from the pictures. As for quality, they seemed nice albeit a little small. Returned item."
3.0,"Good light for the money, my only complain is the rubber cover for the charging port does not fit that snag."
3.0,It’s not very thick at all
3.0,"I gave this to my Grandson, it’s nice looking but didn’t come with any information or instructions on how to use the features!"
3.0,"Not great, but OK"
3.0,Material is quite scratchy and stiff even after liquid fabric softener
3.0,I had this for about 1 month when the chain broke off it. The topper that holds the chain broke off and felt like cheap metal.
3.0,Buyer beware it’s not noticeable in the pictures but the shirt is definitely for a 2 year old and has twos all over it. Not sure why it comes up when searching for a 1st birthday outfit...
3.0,"I like these sunglasses, although they can be big at times. Not sure if my head is stretching them out or what! I have to bend them slightly to make them fit, i snapped my last pair in half by doing that (totally my fault). I wish they were a bit smaller, but they are cute and get the job done!"
3.0,"As noted in the title, I was very surprised when I pulled these out of the box. They seemed alarmingly large, based on the stated size. I purchased them as stocking stuffers (no pun intended) for relatives and haven't heard any complaints - but my relatives are nice, so probably wouldn't complain to me. However, I suspect that the socks may stretch out over time and become uncomfortable. They also aren't very thick and cushiony. I think that, next time, I'd spend a bit more money and get a more substantial sock."
3.0,I can deal with the funky material just because it’s such a cute design but it’s too short. I’ll probably return it
3.0,Read reviews before I placed my order and it’s too small. The sizing is China sizing so order a size up. I’m a medium in everything and ordered a medium and i couldn’t get them over my thighs they seem cute though. Also no stretch to it.
3.0,Look nice but didn't fit my child
3.0,"Fabric is pretty thin, and it had a weird smell to it. All over good for autum/spring weather"
3.0,"Just ok, I ended up returning it."
3.0,I usually wear a small and this shirt I ordered a large and it fits perfect. Very thin though and cheaply made. But I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Adorable little teddy bear charms good for earrings or to make key chains.<br /><br />Still cute but one of the teddy bears did not have its match :(
3.0,I followed the size guide and this item fit much too large on me. Material is very comfy and stretchy. The pants would have needed to be hemmed quite a bit as well. I ended up returning this item as it was too large and did not look flattering at all.
3.0,Shrank down two sizes when washed in cold and dried on medium.
3.0,This top runs very small. I take an dog and this did not for at all.
3.0,The shirt fit right but the pants fit great
3.0,Cute but the fabric was thinner than I expected.
3.0,I loved the way the dress fit and looked but even with tightening the straps I had to pull it up constantly. I loved the dress as long as I didn’t move lol.
3.0,"I purchased other brands at the same time.  These were cute, but very small and uncomfortable."
3.0,"I ordered the orange rose color so I could wear it during the fall season as well. The print is pretty and the color looks exactly like the pic. But, for a kimono the fit is small-- it does not fit loose like the picture if you get your normal size. I should have gone up one at least a size, maybe two for a more kimono fit. The material is also very thin, which is fine for summer, but the quality is sub-par. For the price I assumed the quality wouldn't be great but I must say this is worse than I expected. I have purchased chiffon clothing pieces from Target or TJ Maxx for the similar price but better quality.<br /><br />I am torn about whether to keep it as I really need something for a cover up option as I burn so easily and summers in Iowa are horribly hot and humid..."
3.0,"It’s a very small pin . Other than that it’s in great condition brand new and arrived on time ,packaged well."
3.0,"It was quite the hassle to fit this watchband to size. It was supposed to come with a card to help with the pins but it did not. I used a thumb tack which was also a hassle. I have arthritis in my hands and it was difficult to line up the band, pin, and watch; plus use the thumb tack, at the same time. After a good 45 minutes I finally got it to size. I do like this watchband and it looks very nice with my Moto 360 watch. I wish I could have ordered it to my wrist size instead of doing it myself. There is not much room for error if I would have cut too short."
3.0,I love the idea of this mask. My son has to wear masks at school still and we wanted something that shows his face. He only wore it for 20 min at the open house and it fogged up all the time and was completely covered in water droplets. He did not want to wear it again.
3.0,Too big. Oversized.
3.0,"Cute, but you cannot call these light gray. They have cream and tan thread, so more of a tan, actually. Okay, but disappointing since I purchased light gray items to match."
3.0,"Ordered my 5 and 8 yo sizes.  The xs would fit my 8yo and the 8yo size fit me.  Sent back, easy refund.  I didn’t like the material either."
3.0,"I was excited when my friends said this is a good product and holds a lot of pens but honestly too expensive and didn't really work for my needs. Its a great product, just not for me. I did like the little ape/gorilla."
3.0,These are totally cheap but I bought them to go with a costume and so really didn't care at all. It only comes with the ears and tail. I attached the tail with a safety pin. The headband was the cheapest part and the ears were crooked. Oh well.
3.0,"Great design but a regular, basic baseball tee ): could have gotten a higher quality tee to print this !"
3.0,Not happy with zize
3.0,Great sunglasses but through normal use the clip broke and now the arm doesn't stay on. Which is a bummer cuz I liked them for running and cycling. Lasted a year.
3.0,very large but still okay as a line
3.0,The gnomes on 6 pair are fuzzy and lack clarity...print is smudged
3.0,The fabric quality is poor and too large through the chest.
3.0,Wish it was better made. Just arrived and had a hole under arm.
3.0,"saw a picture of rihanna rocking what claims to be this chain in the pictures of this item. I wasn't sure if the style would suit me or not but it wasn't a bad price and riri looked great in it so I went for it. I've had experience with other similar body chains before so I knew that the chain was easily subjected to breaking within the first few uses, and that if it got wet it would have a bit of a metallic smell. in addition to that I'm not so crazy about the way the chain hangs, but that may just be for my body type. all in all, its alright for the price."
3.0,These earrings are absolutely gorgeous.  The only downside is that they are on the heavier size and do not sit straight on the earlobe.  They tilt a few degrees.
3.0,Are these infant sizes?  Unwearable unless you are about a 3rd grader.
3.0,"It looks better in the picture and in real life the beads are uneven especially for the fringe. I'm going to ""make it work"" for my Halloween costume but it's pretty cheesy in real life."
3.0,"Bought it based on all the good reviews.  It is marginally than the $7 pair from Toysrus.  Light shake of the google dropped the eye piece, all scratched.  It is definitely not up to the hype as some/most of the reviewers rave about this goggle."
3.0,Bags seem sturdy enough but there is not bottom width to them.  They are like oversized plastic bags but more sturdy.
3.0,"It's ok, about what you would expect for the money."
3.0,"I bought a red pair and an orange pair and got an orange and yellow pairr which is not what I asked for, but they're still good I guess."
3.0,Turned my fingers green but awesome designs worth the money still. Makes for good gift
3.0,The size is not the same as other suppliers. It’s about 2 sizes smaller.
3.0,A little larger that I expected. But it is very pretty and will make a wonderful gift
3.0,Material thin & slinky.Not for Large women with bumps & bulges.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:142fac47e6f789ec56b57e93f18f1101]] This purse is very cute in person.  It's rather small and definitely a versatile purse for a concert, play, brunch, dinner or whatever.  I, personally, am not crazy about the glitter part of the flap being exposed.  I am not a fan of the glitter &#34;shedding&#34; and I definitely did not like the rough feel of the glitter.  The shoulder strap was lighter than I expected, but I'm also not using the purse as carry-on luggage, so the shoulder strap should be sturdy enough to handle light items like a cellphone, small wallet and keys, for instance.  Do note that at the time of this review, I've only had the purse less than 24 hours, so I have not had an opportunity to give this bad-girl a run; however, I think it could definitely get the job done."
3.0,"I LOVE Kerrits products! This vest is what I wanted - except all photos, of all colors, show a double front zipper. Including photos on Kerrits' own website.  The vest I received (12.12.18) only has one front zipper.  A fluke perhaps? But I purchased this item specifically because it had a double front zipper.  *UPDATE* Spoke with Manufacturer. The photo was a prototype taken months prior to production. Manufacturer made a mistake and only put one zipper on all of these vests from 2018."
3.0,Love the look and bends easy but I can't wear more than a day because the metal it's made of irritates my nose very badly. Also the ends are quite jagged so it hurts a bit going in.
3.0,Very difficult to get screwed together but finally got them. Price is high though because I thought this was for 4 pairs of earrings but it’s for 4 single studs. Disappointed with price but like the earrings so far. Four of the sets I ordered didn’t come put together and the pieces were all just loose in the plastic envelope.
3.0,Very plasticky feeling. Not big enough for me so I returned it
3.0,The gray knit is way too tight.  Maybe if it had more stretch from the patterned material on down
3.0,The band is cool. The only thing is that the leather is not good quality.
3.0,Returned it. It was too big on me and I didn’t like the high neck. It was nice fabric and was a good length but it just didn’t work for me.
3.0,"Bought these for my daughter and she likes them. They seem super thick to me, should be nice and warm.  They are really high waisted, like more than what the usual trend is these days, but she says that is fine.<br /><br />What is not fine is that the elastic band in the waist is not attached inside the cloth waist enclosure in any way what-so-ever. This means that the 1.5-2"" elastic band turns and twists inside the enclosure.  Super annoying.  She wasn't wearing them because of this.  I fixed them with  little DIY freehand sewing.  I should not have to do this.<br /><br />Good pants.  Major flaw takes them from a 5 to a 2 star and I would not buy again knowing this problem, unless the price was more reflective of the cheap design."
3.0,The sandal looks good but I had to send them back since they run small.  since they ran out of the larger sizes.  I haven’t been able to reorder them. Hopefully they will restock and offer more sizes
3.0,Looks great but the gem inside the teardrop had fallen out. Nothing a drop of super glue won't fix.
3.0,"Our daughter didn't like all the threads on the inside...they are thick and overall nice, but we have to turn them inside out because it bothers her."
3.0,I believe I received the one that is 'One Size Fits All'.  No size label inside.  It is cute but fits a little too snug.  I will make it work since I am putting a blue jean jacket over it.  I am in my 50's and wanted something fun for an event.  Took a while to arrive but did.  Definitely order 2 sizes up and hope you don't get one that is a one size fits all because it doesn't.  lol  Cute print!
3.0,It's not bad for the price but the top strand does not look like the picture. The chain it's self is a little thicker than I imagined.
3.0,I love the looks of this dress and I ordered the dress size I currently wear but it was way too snug.
3.0,"Good quality material, but totally not sized correctly. Way too long for petite and a bit too small for width."
3.0,Very narrow. I even went a size larger since I'm 8.5-9. I got 9.5. They're super cute but way way to narrow.
3.0,It has a drawstring no elastic!  That's the downfall it needs elastic in there! Other than that they're great!
3.0,I bought a similar pair that is no longer available and they are awesome.  This pair the waist was large and they are kinda loose fitting.  I like tight exercise wear that can stretch with you not leggings that I have to keep pulling up.
3.0,"Have always worn a Mickey watch and in current political clime thought that the illustration was perfect for the way I feel most of the time.  The fact that it was a Nixon watch was the ultimate irony. It came and is nice quality, except for the obvious... the illustration almost completely hides the hands that tell the time and I find it almost impossible to know with any certainty exactly what time it is.  Funny that a watch I bought because of frustration has only added to same. This seems to be about the way it goes these days. I'm wearing it just the same. Maybe I'm too OCD about wanting to know what time it really is, but as that is the function of a watch, I can only give it three stars."
3.0,"Cute luggage tags, I’m not expecting the highest quality so otherwise they look cute and are fine. I believe they’re made in China as I saw they were also being sold on AliExpress. The flap can get annoying but if it’s what you’re looking for in a luggage tag, it should be fine for you"
3.0,It was cute once I tied the belt on. But without the belt it looks like a Moo Moo.
3.0,"Halloween Scary Zombie Latex Mask, Walking Creepy Dead Creepy Horror Full Head Mask for Men Adults<br /><br />First impressions: Well, you get what you pay for. First off, it looks more like a mummy than a zombie. Latex is thin, came in a plastic bag laying flat so there are some bends in the latex from folding. Those can be eased some with a hair dryer.<br /><br />Installation/setup: Took it out of the bag. I never actually put it on, I took it out and stuffed it with polyfil and stuck it on my scarecrow.<br /><br />Notes: I got this to put on my scarecrow. I have a few masks, I’m not anywhere near a collector, but I own a couple of professionally hand made latex masks. I’ve done some repaints and painted some blank latex masks.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This is nowhere near a quality professionally hand made mask. That said, the paint job isn’t bad, the sculpt is ok and it works for what I need. If I keep it past this season, I will need to paint it, there are a couple places that bug me.  I wouldn’t expect this to last more than one night of wearing as a mask though, the latex is that thin. If that’s what you need, then go for it lol<br /><br />⭐️1 star - I don't recommend it at all, poor quality.<br />⭐️⭐️ 2 stars - I don't recommend it, it has multiple faults, or a very high price.<br />⭐️⭐️⭐️ 3 stars - It's passable, It has some faults but the quality-price ratio is ok.<br />⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4 stars - Product quite acceptable, it does what it promises.<br />⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 stars - Product that I totally recommend."
3.0,Really thick material. I would not wear these out. They make you look bigger in the butt.  I would not buy again
3.0,It fit great at first but after the wash it was smaller. (And yes we followed the directions)
3.0,I read reviews that this ran small so I ordered a large. I normally wear a medium. The large was too large so I had to return it. I needed this for a specific date so I couldn't do an exchange but had to get a new top somewhere else. Too bad.
3.0,Wig was too small. Couldn't wear. Squeezed head too tight.  Probably better for smaller heads or kids.
3.0,Great bag really did carry everything I used it when I took long trips or was going to be out all day. love all the zippers but not easy to open top zipper while carrying. Got stuck alot.
3.0,No elasticity around the arm sleeves keep<br />Coming down
3.0,Great top but a little too big for me. The bottoms fit perfectly except I'm usually a medium and ordered an extra large after reading the reviews.
3.0,Very nice &#34;ugly&#34; sweater however it could be a bit larger. The one size fits all is not a good idea for this product.
3.0,Nice the chiffon crepe material is a little cheap. You need to go a size up if you wear a large you need an extra large and so on
3.0,"Nice necklace, but was disappointed that the chain goes through the heart, and is not affixed to the sides. Pic depiction isn’t 100% correct."
3.0,"They fit well in the legs but in my opinion the waist emphasized my post baby tummy. They’re cute with longer tops, but I can’t wear with normal tank or T-shirt until I lose weight"
3.0,Ordered for a 11 year old size boys large. My son is average height and weight. Way too small. Returned and ordered men's small fits but can barely get feet through tight leg opening.  Good customer service but took awhile coming from Europe. Matching shirt order up as well. I will order local next time easier to return.
3.0,Very long and scratchy
3.0,The dolls robe had a hole in it.😬
3.0,Now ripped off first time I wore it so I glued it back on with fabric glue. Otherwise cute belt
3.0,I ordered the XL and had to return. It was super cute but being a bigger girl the dress was just too short for me
3.0,"Fabric and design awesome, I can't even say enough positive things about the beautiful deep navy color and the fantastic floral design but then we come to sizing. I ordered an extra large which I have no probs with ever. This was not even close to the right sizing.  I would have exchanged it except because the sizing was so wacky I wasn't sure if I would have to order &#34;elephant tent&#34; just so I could get an extra large"
3.0,"Expensive for how little this set is and does look kinda plastic, very glossy shiny.<br />Very petite jewelry.<br />Paid $48<br />Should have been $30<br />But dont feel like returning, will keep."
3.0,This product snatched the waist... but it has hard panty lines if you have a nice size booty 😩.. looking to get something that goes down a little further to nix the panty lines!
3.0,Wrinkled easily.
3.0,"The idea is cool, other than that the hat feels of low quality."
3.0,"they are pretty but fall out really easily. i loose them in the shower, when im sleeping, anytime i forget to take it out before washing my face. but luckily there are 40 of them."
3.0,My daughter loves this so I am happy with it
3.0,"While these are lovely earrings, they are rather large and heavy.  A smaller knot will look better on most ladies.  If one has large ears and a heavy face, they will look lovely.<br /><br />They are made very nicely and in appearance they are perfect.<br /><br />The clutch is much too small for easy installation."
3.0,"Shoes is beautiful, however thigh band is too small, I'll have to figure out how to add some elastic on it."
3.0,"Very cute dress! I intended to use it as a blouse with leggings...unfortunately it was incredibly small; so based in my experience, I recommend you order multiple sizes up."
3.0,It's way to long! It looks exactly like the pic and the eye is beautiful!
3.0,"The fit is fine, fabric is the same stretchy poly knit as most dresses of this style on amazon.  The colors are glaring though, really bright yellow and orange. Decided to return and maybe try a different color combo"
3.0,I liked the fit was afraid to wash over and over elastic very thin
3.0,The XL size fits like a 12-14.  Not a 14-16.  If you plan on using them for working out then you'll need to size up as they aren't squat proof.  They don't seem see through but I normally wear splash colored underwear.  They'd be fine for lounging but not the gym/lots of movement.
3.0,The shorts waist band fits too tight and it’s uncomfortable but the fit is awesome I just suggest to get a size bigger than your usual. And for<br />The band to be more elastic and stretching on that area of the shorts .
3.0,Okay but not well made. Lots of loose threads. Disappointed as Charter Club products have been better quality for me. Above the knee.
3.0,Need next size up
3.0,"The material is nice and all but if you are anything bigger than a medium or have any bit of extra tummy on you, these will roll down like crazy. They also almost go up too high. I’m disappointed because I tried them on with the high expectations and now I can’t return them, I’ve wanted high waisted underwear to have with my leggings but these sadly aren’t it. Someone else might like them but not this mom bod /:"
3.0,"This dress does run small.  And not one size but maybe two. OOORDER UP... Now with That being said...I’m speaking to the ones that may be looking to purchase a L-XXL . If you are wanting a look like the model and say you typically wear a xxl without the flowy look , this won’t do the trick . This fits like any other T-shirt dress with maybe an inch or two of added fabric. There’s a woman who posted a picture above with a red dress  on.. another woman with a grey one.... it fits just like that. I have not decided if I will return them ( foolishly I purchase 2) or just figure out something like gifting it , yet"
3.0,"Nice hat, the flannel is soft and very comfortable as well. The green satin under-bill is a nice touch. The strap and sweat band do not look or feel like genuine leather though."
3.0,"We had to take the sole out for it to fit my daughter...even then it was a challenge to get it wrapped around her ankle.  Cute, but not the right fit for her chunky feet."
3.0,The charm was very pretty but the chain seemed cheap and was not long enough. If i had kept this I would've gotten a more substantial chain for the charm.
3.0,"This dress ended up being too small on me. I am 5’7” and 185lbs. The size large was tight in my arms and all around unflattering! If you have larger arms, I would recommend sizing up as the lace doesn’t provide much stretch.<br />Other than that, the quality was OK. The fabric on the “skirt” part of the dress looks a little cheap and wrinkled easily. The lace was soft enough that it wouldn’t be irritating to wear and provided a little stretch (just not enough for my beefy arms)! At this price, it was worth a try, but mine will be sent back."
3.0,Not really impressed with this. It wrinkles so easily after wearing it for a couple hours I feel kind of redicilious. Could be cute but the material is just not right
3.0,"The fabric is pretty color. I am 5’8 and typically wear an 8 or a medium. It’s a good thing these stretch. However, I will have to wear boots with these as they come up above my ankle. Probably a good 2-3 inches above. However they’re still workable."
3.0,This dress was cute but wayyy too tight in the arms and chest. I’m a small B so I thought a Medium would be perfect. It was a great length (just above knee) but if I had gotten it in a Large it would’ve been too much material. Wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,"This one I'm sure is going to come down to preference. But for me... it was a big no. If you have moderately larger thighs, the leopard print makes them look huge.<br /><br />The quality is great and the fit was good. They just do not look good on!"
3.0,This was a gift I bought for someone. Im glad I had it sent to me first. The horns were attached to the head band unevenly so i had to do a bot of crafting to try to hide the flaw. Other than that its a cool item. I will be buying another. Just wish the plain version was a bit cheaper.
3.0,A little smaller and thinner than expected.
3.0,"They run small, and are not quite as &#34;cushy&#34; as I'd hoped. But it will break the wind from slicing through. Seems pretty well made."
3.0,"Thinner material than I thought it would be, almost see through. Definitely cheap made."
3.0,Somewhat small making it an awkward fit. But the print looks different in person.
3.0,"Loved the shirt in pictures. Thought it would be a lot longer. Nice fit and loose in trunk area ..fitted on arms, which I like. Wish it was about 3 -5 inches longer"
3.0,"Although this bag is lovely, I didnt find it be worth more than $40-$50!  I was excited when my bag arrived and immediately after opening it, I noticed a sour smell coming from the bag. I checked the purse thoroughly and didnt notice anything wrong, so I filled my bag. The next day, my make up bag and vitamin container smelled like the purse. This fishy-like scent was too much, that after spraying with Febreezer and letting it air dry for 2 days, the scent has started to fade.<br /><br />It is very spacious and can hold a lot of stuff. I really liek this bag and it  would've gotten a 5 star review, but that darn smell was such a  turn off!!!!"
3.0,"I actually bought this pendant for my dog, so wanted something that was affordable in case it didn't last long. I wasn't expecting real Swarovski crystal for under $20. When I first got it, I separated the star from the dainty necklace, attached the star to one of the D rings on my dog's leather collar with a couple of tiny steel split rings, and gave the chain to my youngest adult child.<br /><br />My dog is a 12 lb Pekingese with a spaniel coat (the original, not the 'bred for poofiness' coat). The star hangs to just above her chest bone. At first it looked gorgeous, and the ""crystal"" would catch the light perfectly! 2 months later, and the iridescent  AB coating is scraped and chipped off in places. I mean, it's on a dog, so I expected some wear and tear. But any real crystal wouldn't be coated in it's coloring, would it? The color would be IN the crystal itself I believe.<br /><br />Anyways, I'd pay $10 or less for this item knowing its quality now. It'd undoubtedly last longer around a human neck, too! I don't know if it's glass, crystal, acrylic or what, but it definitely was pretty at first, and after 2 months, it's beat up. It's important to note that the pendant never fell off of my dog, never touched the ground or pavement, so I can't figure the cause of the chipping."
3.0,"Only had option of 5 or 6  ( the wife wears a 6 ) ordered the 6 but it is a little small, if the ring set came in a 7 would have traded."
3.0,Ended up returning this bc the color wasn't as pictured. It's a dark red.
3.0,"Great, funny SW themed shirt. I first bought the medium, but it was too large. I returned that and got the small, which is a little too small :("
3.0,"Well . . . it a lot . . . um  . . . bigger than I expected. I'm sure I'll figure out someone who will wear it, but it's not particularly, um . . . delicate? Folks who like gawdy will love it."
3.0,"Doesn't come down as far on my thighs as it does in the picture. Needed it to be longer. Material is comfortable,  though."
3.0,"I had already bought this bag in navy blue, and love it so much that I then ordered a black one like it, as well as a brown one in a different style.  Tossed the two new ones in the closet, and wanted to use the black today.  That’s when I noticed the strap was sewn twisted. Rather than mess with sending it back, (never did find their customer service info) I snipped it, then untwisted the strap and zigzagged it together again.<br /> In spite of that,  this is a great bag! But, if you order it, look it over well right away."
3.0,"Very pretty! Runs very small, but good length."
3.0,"Love this dress! It fits really well - at 5'8&#34; and 145 pounds I bought a medium and the fit was perfect. The fabric is thin enough to be cool when wearing but isn't so thin that you can see through it. The dress is adorable!<br /><br />Update: I have now had to return 2 of these dresses because the elastic breaks in the shoulders the first time wearing it. Too bad, it's a cute dress, but I won't be re-ordering."
3.0,Nice pattern but thin. not for winter.
3.0,My hubby likes it but said its weird that the dial is on that side. Thedial is also kinda big.
3.0,Good quality but flared out weird by my hips. Ended up returning.
3.0,Def not rated for -30 degrees worn out in 11-20° weather hands were warm for about 45 min at max
3.0,"Size up as this shirt will shrink when washed. I wash in cold water and hung this shirt up to dry and it still shrank. On the plus side, it's a nice soft cotton."
3.0,The bottom split which would pinch my daughters foot. I ended up removing the face and gluing it to another sandal.
3.0,"Was cute! Only giving it three stars tho cause the outside of the pouch felt really rough, did not like"
3.0,"I bought two of these watches. The first one I bought was in perfect condition and very accurate as well, it only gained about 5 seconds a day. I was so impressed and liked it so much that I bought another one as a gift for someone else but the second one I received had numbers on the dial that were crooked! I didn't test the accuracy of the watch as I immediately sent it back but was bummed that I couldn't give it as a present anymore.<br />Other than that, the rotor is loud and the band needs to be replaced right away. The one it comes with is rough and uncomfortable to wear and continually sheds material... Like a dog shedding hair, which is really weird. Anyway I changed the band and I can live with the loud rotor.<br />Definitely a good watch if you get one without any quality control issues but due to the inconsistency I can only give it a 3 star rating overall."
3.0,"Cut is nice. Fit is as expected. Material feels good. The zipper pull stands out because it's so dark compared to the white material. They should consider making the pull white. I would have kept this, but the color isn't exactly white. It's more of a vanilla."
3.0,It's a very weird material that is very noisy when you walk. I sized up and it was still a bit tight.
3.0,"While the stainless steel wolf's tooth is awesome, the 23&#34; necklace is a cheap rubber material of some sort and there is no way to straighten it out flat from being folded up in the shipping process. It is permanently curled even now after a few weeks. Not sure what to do with it but cut it off and use another chain. . . would be a lot better and worth the price if there had been a different chain. . ."
3.0,They are Stunning  but runs about 2 sizes to  small.
3.0,The suit fits pretty good but the top is loose on the sides of the breast. The pads that came with it have to be removed because they are perfectly round cups that show underneath and make your breasts look strange.
3.0,It's super pretty and I give it 3 stars for looking exactly like the photo but  I got a really bad allergic Reaction! sucks that I had to return it but my skin looked awful after just a few days of use.
3.0,"Quality isn't that great, style is good but not very comfortable for my daughter"
3.0,Pants way to long
3.0,Not exactly what was thinking it would look like
3.0,I love these but I need the right size.
3.0,These are fine for the money.
3.0,Doesn't come with new pins...yes it says strap only but I figured they all came with new pins. Live and learn
3.0,It doesn’t look very stylish. Had to buy another belt to make the fit look perfect.
3.0,"Ordered two pairs of medium in black, and a medium and large in green. Received one ruffly shirt (?) and a pair of black pants, labeled medium. They were very skinny in the waist and made of slightly different fabric than the green ones. Plus, they were much smaller than the green pants labeled size medium. I tried the medium and large in green, which were nicer pants (3 star pants for those who only care about comfort!), however they are very short (I have an inseam of about 29 inches and the mediums barely came to my ankles. The waist area wasn't as wide as I'd hoped either, so it either cut my tummy in an odd spot or wasn't very flattering if I tried to wear it around my natural waist. The large...I gave up. The bag came without a zipper and I didn't want to open it then have Amazon deny the return.<br /><br />Pants:4<br />Me: 0"
3.0,"It looks as pictured but the fabric is SUPER thin so you can clearly see the print of whatever you’re wearing underneath. Also, I’m typically an 18 and the jacket fit (there’s some stretch) but the sleeves, especially the cuffs are ridiculously baggie! Overall it’s fine for the costume and what you get but be prepared. Also, the glasses don’t have any lenses which I thought was weird and the scarf foryour hair has wiring in it, which I thought was pretty cool."
3.0,"Good quality, but it's too smal"
3.0,"Good points: Nicely made, very comfortable, well stitched, can be dressed up or down, and cheap.<br />Bad points: Actually, just one bad point. They are too large. I am 5 ft 6 in, 125 lbs. I bought size small and the waist is too big on me.<br />I would give 5 stars if they fit well. I recommend getting a size smaller."
3.0,"The Album is preety nice, Im am happy that I bought it. It has 48 big puckets which can fit any size of bill. Nice quality. BUT the big disadvantage is you can not add pages to it! So as you keep collecting bills, you run out of space and you shoud buy a new album."
3.0,"Super cute print but cheap material, not comfortable, runs small.."
3.0,"I like these glasses, and they look like your average round glasses. They don’t have a prescription so it can be used solely for fashion."
3.0,I should’ve just ordered an extra small like usual.  The previous reviews made me order a small instead.
3.0,I wear a size 9.5 - 10 shoe so ordered a Large (size 10) and the fit was a little snug especially with socks. If the seems hold up they should break in just about right.
3.0,Loved these- but they broke after 2 months 😞
3.0,The color is nice. I bought a large and I weigh 190. The pants were a bit difficult to get into but they are long and very high waisted. It’s not too tight to be uncomfortable but I feel I little compression at the top of the band.<br />I’m a 36DD and the large top was a bit big even when I adjusted the straps. The top has padding as well. Overall it’s really an ok buy for me. Doubt I’d use the top because I need some kinda support but I’d be def using the pants which might take me a lil time & energy to put on.
3.0,The features that were supposed to be black were actually silver. When you looked at it in a certain light the looked black but otherwise it was silver.
3.0,Texture of the fabric it's not nice
3.0,"These bras are cute. They do run a bit small, so my chest is almost too large for them. It looks stylish and sexy but does not offer much support. I have two and wear them occassionally, but only for short periods of time (usually when I want a boy to see it on me... like lingerie;)"
3.0,I got the black color and it looks like it's faded (old) right from the start.
3.0,"I love this designer but the main zipper on mine was broken. Luckily my mom is a manic lady and she fixed it, but if I didn’t have her, I would’ve returned it"
3.0,It's rayon. The print is nice though.  It's not maxi length.  I'm 5ft 2 and it is midway on my calfs. It has pockets. It's nice not impressed or displeased.  Will order again
3.0,"I would have given it 5 stars, but it's not real leather"
3.0,Wish it had been more giving.
3.0,Bought these for my elderly mother who wanted “undershirts”.  She needed 3x but these were too tight and small for purpose.  Had to return.
3.0,Ordered a small and it fits like a c cup
3.0,"Cute and fits as expected, but after a few washes, the design comes off."
3.0,"Very cute! But the stone walls out within 3-4 weeks! I put my second one in 3 weeks ago and it fell off yesterday! They leave a very weird feel in your mouth after! Ordering new rings now, but not these! Sorry!"
3.0,Didn’t really fit well
3.0,Kids sized
3.0,"I only marked three stars because while this was a very pretty bracelet of good quality for the cost, it came broken in two pieces with some of the rings missing to put it back together.  Luckily I have a little bit of jewelry making experience and was able to modify and fix it.  Had it not been for that and the inconvenience of this broken pieces I would have given it a five star rating."
3.0,Quality is okay. I would not spend too much money on it but for the price I bought it for it was fair. Full price no way. We have worn a few times and it has not shrunk and colors have not faded. Its holding up well but more something you donate when done then hold onto.
3.0,decent but would be nice to have a little thicker terry cloth material.
3.0,Frames are lightweight which is great.  I've had the lenses and screws pop out three times in 3 months so I have to keep spares with me at all times.
3.0,Beautiful cover up however a bit large for my petite frame.  I'm keeping it anyways.
3.0,"Although the outside skirt material is good and the skirt fit is good, the inside shirts is of absolutely no use.  It rides up like a panty and dies not serve its purpose.  Will not buy again"
3.0,Compared to all the other similar tunics on Amazon (I have bought many) this one is not true to size so go up a size or two. But it is very pretty.
3.0,"The quality of the bag was nice, sturdy, I was really excited-<br />but the purple wasn't at all like the picture, which was really disappointing."
3.0,I don't like them they are very small do not hang off your ear dainty nothing wrong with them just not for me very pretty I just like more of a full on saddle that hangs off
3.0,Returned and customer service took great care of us.
3.0,"Fabric is horrible to the touch, but it’s at least fresh for summer. Fit and sizing is perfect"
3.0,It would look great if you already have a big round one. Otherwise I think it looks like trying to look like you have a huge round one. Thin material.
3.0,Cute but much too large and the tag had been removed. I dont think this was a XL more like a 2x or 3x. I think I  received a different size than ordered.
3.0,Nice necklace but was not the blue color in picture.
3.0,"I bought a large because a ton of the reviews said it ran really small, I’m generally a medium, 5’8”, 150lbs and I was swimming in this! It seems like it’d be a super cute dress and is well made but the sizing is way off"
3.0,"Doesn't look as nice in person. I'm going to keep it anyway and I'm sure I'll have some use for it, but was hoping for a little better quality."
3.0,It looks better online than in person.  The color is very bright green and I'm not in love with the feel.  It's still an interesting scarf but probably would have preferred it in another color.
3.0,"well let me start by saying that this shipment came much before than expected (loved that) I took it out of the packaging and the material is see-through so you'll have to wear a tank top under. But I don't like the fit (I purchased a S) I guess I should've gotten an XS but they didn't have any in stock. The shirt is cute, a little long for my taste too. Cute design, the shirt is okay for the price. Free shipping so you can't really beat that."
3.0,"These are soft and warm. Price is affordable.  The negative is that they are a bit too big for me, and slide off my ears and down to my neck. I am a female with an average head size."
3.0,I just bought a couple of different hats on Amazon and out of all of them this one was my least favorite. Just seems to be lower quality material than the others.
3.0,"seemed a little small up top, but the fabric was really weird, so I sent it back"
3.0,seems nice except for back pack straps they come out of a compartment that cant zipper back up so when in back pack mode and its raining out that compartment will fill up with water
3.0,I ordered the smallest size and they are just too large. I am 5’4 and weigh 118 they just are made fir a bigger person. Other than that the quality is good.
3.0,its a 20 gauge not a 22. also no plastic retainer came with it.
3.0,Love the fabric and dress overall but the fit is off. Order a size larger.
3.0,"This item is a Stretch fabrics (""elastomerics"") such as spandex or elastane..which makes it run small.."
3.0,Awesome comfy clothes. Soft. Good fit. Comfortable. Feminine.  Good value for price. Really like it. May order for Xmas gifts.
3.0,made me look pregnant
3.0,"Unlike the pictures, there are no straps connected to the end of the wings so they had to be safety pinned to move when my arms did."
3.0,Soft but run small
3.0,I like the feel of the material. It looks good w/ jeans or slacks.
3.0,Material is super soft!  I got a small and the dress is still HUGE!  The color was beautiful and I wish it were smaller because I would have purchased in multiple colors.
3.0,Yes they do what's expected (organize your packing) but they are expensive for what you get. I would not choose to buy them again.<br />The largest size included will fit basically everything in your suitcase so not sure what's the point of that one.
3.0,"Fit is perfectly fine and they're not too thin, but unfortunately the beige is very dark. It's a medium brown, and definitely not suitable for caucasians. My legs looked significantly darker than my arms."
3.0,Nice little robe especially for price
3.0,Cute top... Too small...
3.0,"I can't say I don't like this keychain, but I don't love it.  I expected it to be much smaller than it is, and although it is pretty, it would be much nicer if it were not so clunky and heavy."
3.0,"I thought I was getting an Alex and Ani product.  Disappointed, but it is a cute bracelet."
3.0,Broke within a year
3.0,"Very cute, but not as well designed as I expected.  I got this for swimming/ diving and for the coverage.  My only gripe with this is the clasp in back.  It is a kind of hook clasp and at the end of the day with all the activity I had done . . . it had almost come unhooked!  It didn't, else I would have given this 1 star!  I am wondering if I had gotten a larger size it would not have been an issue,  but since I went with the recommended sizing . . .oh well.  The fabric is a little stiff so it doesn't seem to give as much.  Maybe it just needs a break it period.  We'll see, if it improves with wear I'll come back and update my review."
3.0,The fabric is really weird. It feels awkward on the skin. Definitely doesn’t fit like the photo.
3.0,"So...I payed for a wool hat (100% felt wool) but instead I got straw?<br />Now over all it’s an okay hat, the jeweled band is just as pictured, but the hat itself is not the same as the picture. I’m just a little disappointed because I have a lot of straw cowboy hats :(. I definitely wouldn’t have paid $40(shipping included) for it. $20 maybe because of the craftsmanship. I can’t say if that’s a fair price but most of my straw hats were about $15"
3.0,It’s good. Stops me from rubbing my eyes. And reminds me to clean my hands first. But not anti fog.
3.0,Fine for the price however the green of the stone is dull compared to the bright green in the picture.
3.0,"The waist line is cut for tall people, if you're short it's going to try to cut you around your belly."
3.0,Esperaba algo más
3.0,"I was disappointed at how much larger this dress was than I thought it would be. Love the color, but it somehow made my high waistline look even more non existent. :("
3.0,"Fits pretty well and looks neat.  Material is thin, so not a cold weather sock."
3.0,Would have been 5 but it smelled so bad and buttons kept falling off
3.0,"The shorts are absolutely adorable. But the sit at my natural waist which causes them to ride up the back and show some cheek. If you have ""junk in the trunk"" these are not for you, sadly."
3.0,Much thinner material than I expected. Smaller than  I hoped too.
3.0,The glasses are fun they're bright and colorful but they won't last past the day they will break so easy.
3.0,The larger stone is crooked; it is not too bad that I would return however.
3.0,"This watch is definitely sturdy, but a little heavy. The edges of the bracelet links are rather sharp and can dig into your skin.  I wish they made a titanium version!!"
3.0,"It is cute and soft but arrived with huge hole in the front. Its not a rip, just wasn't stitched properly. 200 lbs bought large and it fits perfectly because it stretches."
3.0,Super warm. Cheap zipper. Snaps spaced too far apart. Pockets are small. But really warm!!!!
3.0,Even after a wash and hot dryer the nightgown is a bit large.  Still very nice fabric and lovely color.
3.0,This is not as soft as the solid ones are.
3.0,Well I had to give it to my niece look like for a young version of me
3.0,Xoxo
3.0,The XL size is the largest size I saw and they are to small for my hands. They need to offer a larger size lke XXL.
3.0,its a cute little purse and have been using it.  but lots of string that were detached
3.0,I would give a better review if I would have received all the colors that was supposed to be in the pack and they are super super thin and easy to poke a hole in them other than that they're pretty good socks
3.0,They feel and look cheap. They are also hard to snap to my vest.
3.0,"Not sure if this is supposed to be a child's pack or if it's small by design. Not talking about the compartments or load capacity, it seems to be able to hold quite a bit. The shoulder straps seemed to not quite fit right, like the pack is too narrow to begin with. The waist strap however did not fit around me at all (6'2&#34; 225lbs) so it's not like I have a huge gut. I ended up giving it to my 8 year old. Looking at these packs on here, they all seem to be the same. Kind of makes me a bit gun shy about ordering one from another manufacturer."
3.0,Definitely not high waisted. These are going to fall in 1 second of movement. Doesn't show panty line and not see through so yay for that.
3.0,Thick material- thicker than expected. After washing it gets very wrinkled and did shrink even though I didn’t put in in the dryer and I washed it on cold. 5’7 and 160 lbs I bought my usual size large but I wish I had sized up to an extra large
3.0,Was a little tight around the back
3.0,"I really like the style/appearance of this cardigan and the quality of the material.  The quality of the craftmanship was just ok--attention to detail wasn't there.  For instance, there were several &#34;hanging strings&#34; and one of the pockets was sewn over so you could put your hand in it.  Be very cautious with sizing.  I usually wear a L-XL in shirts/sweaters and I ordered the largest size available for this sweater (XL) and it fit like a small (L).  Quite tight and &#34;form fitting&#34; which isn't really my thing with sweaters.  All that being said, if the company offered an XXL I would probably give it a try as I really like the look of this cardigan."
3.0,Love them but I’m 5ft 2in and they were really long
3.0,It is a beautiful dress but be very careful when picking your size.
3.0,Dislikes sleeve material
3.0,Cute but to large
3.0,"My husband loves the look of the watch, but has to reset the time with each wear."
3.0,cute and firm but the ears pull away and fall off almost instantly
3.0,This jacket does have shoulder pads and you cannot remove them unless you rip the inside and try to take them out. I do like how it looks on me. I’m not sure to return it
3.0,Looks great but it often falls off
3.0,"The photo makes it look glossy and luxe, almost pearlescent --  but the one that was shipped to me is very flat in color, almost like a bright Crayola crayon Dr. Seuss green. It looks kind of cheap and way too bright. It's not ugly per se but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble to return it."
3.0,scratch easy.
3.0,Ear muffs sucks<br /><br />But every thing else is awesome
3.0,"Love them, but way too big for my two year old, that has a good size foot."
3.0,"It sits weird on my chest area. I wear a size C bra,if you are larger chest i would advise not to get it. Other than that very good quality and very pretty. Also i dont have a waist so i could have worn it as a dress."
3.0,I normally wear a Medium or Large. I am a 12 ish in women's. I bought an XXL and I can't even pull them up 😒 TOO SMALL
3.0,"The shirt is okay. I read a review that mentioned it is not oversized so I ordered larger than my actual size. It's very loose and oversized now, but because it's a larger size in general, the arms and wrist area are huge. I'm debating if I want to keep or not. The material is super soft so for that reason alone, I might keep for around my house now that I work from home. I'd say to order your regular size because of the sleeve size, but know that it is not as loose as pictured."
3.0,Strap sized for a woman or child.  Too short for me. Would have been almost perfect.
3.0,"Was a little smaller than I expected, but it's still cute!"
3.0,"This was purchased less than a year ago.  The overall design is basic.  The feel of the material is somewhat cheap.  After having this for only a couple of months, I noticed that the backside of the snap seemed to be bending when I opened the wallet.  This weekend, the metal snap broke completely in half.  Way too expensive a wallet for something like this to happen.  I won't be purchasing any more products made by this company."
3.0,"They are almost 1-piece molded plastic. The quality of the band itself is okay, but if it breaks, you aren't fixing them. Noise suppression is fine for my shop."
3.0,"The color was ok. but the fit was awful, maybe i got it too big, but i'm not sure. I'm 117 lbs. 5'1 the fabric weighted down."
3.0,Cute. But the lace ripped after 2nd wear.
3.0,It looks a little cheap but is according to the price you pay
3.0,"I would like to see more current color tones and shades as I feel the ones provide now are out dated.  However, know that this was adorable to wear and was easy to pack.  I would buy again if it came in better fabric and colors but with that said it also washed well in a sweater bag and I air dried.  The pant was long but I wore heals so again it worked well.  I really liked the ruffle and wide leg pant cut.  It would be easy enough to return so I vote to order and try it on if you're not sure.  I ended up keeping my green jumpsuit, packing it, and wearing it for a business conference.  I recommend wearing shape wear underneath if you want zero lines showing."
3.0,Major discrepancy in size of coat to pants. Coat runs a size plus big and pants a size plus small. I have to put a fleece neck warmer on my little guy to keep rain from soaking the neck area bc it’s so roomy. Pants are somewhat tight and he’s on the smaller end of 2T.
3.0,"The one thing that could have been added is an elastic band to snug fit the hat to a person's head. For this reason, I was not able to wear it with a 7.4 size head. otherwise, it is a great hat."
3.0,Cute coin. VERY cheap chain.
3.0,"Expected more of these Gaiters. Love the pattern,  after one wear the edges fold over and it is not as secure around the face anymore. Bough 6 of another brand for the same price and it actually had the edges sewn an elastic type band much like the N95 masks around the ears."
3.0,This product isn’t terrible it’s much smaller then I thought it would be and doesn’t keep my belly button open as much as I wanted. I used a small marble then tried this. Now I am using a small stone which works much better to keep it open. The belly button tries to close to it’s important to have something that works in there and that will stay in place. You don’t know if it falls out because your stomach area is numb and you will be on your faja. I recommend not wasting the money on this product and using a small stone or marble. Hope that helps
3.0,fell apart not to happen all the money i spend on them the melt tip came off
3.0,Returned because it wasn't exactly what I wanted
3.0,"Bag is adorable. Shoulder straps are way too short if you are above 5'4"" tall"
3.0,"It's very pretty, but it is so small. I'm 5'7&#34;, normal weight. (Size 10) and it won't fasten on my wrist. Seller should note sizing issue to buyers."
3.0,"Kept me warm.  Looks nice at first, until all the feathers started to shed out from every seam possible.  Do not try to wear over a black sweater, you’ll end up looking like you plucked a chicken for dinner."
3.0,the fit is great in this dress but the material is stiff and smells of plastic shower curtain. I will wash it and see if it doesn't improve. the skirt has a lovely swing.... and the scoop neck is low without being obscene.
3.0,"I chose my size by my bust measurement, like they said to, and got a large, but the top is not as A-line or butt covering as the photo leads you to believe.  However, it does fit and nice for the price so I will keep it.  If I order another, I will get an XL and see if that will work better."
3.0,"Runs big, these seem to be taken from Costco and re sold. Only $29 at Costco."
3.0,Never received a warranty card
3.0,They aren't the softest but they are soft.
3.0,Had to return and order a larger size. I like the design and the fact that they are made from recycled material and in the US.
3.0,"I wear a medium/size 8.  I have muscular legs and I must say they do run on then smaller size.  They fit me too snug, they are see through.  I'm still debating if I should return or just give to my teenage daughter"
3.0,"This is the color I ordered,  when it arrived it was pink. Luckily, my mother loved it anyway."
3.0,For size large it’s small !
3.0,Straps are really loose my foot swims in these.
3.0,Child loves it. Doesn’t glow in dark
3.0,"I'm a size 16. I found this quite narrow through the hips, rather like a mens t shirt.  Unfortunate.  Quite heavy material, nice grey color."
3.0,"Got it for my husband for Valentines...It’s very thin and almost see-through. Otherwise it feels soft and comfortable. It Might be cool and breathable in warm or hot weather. Also I got him the xlarge, which is huge. I wasn’t sure if this would run small or large and for some reason I though it would run small. But it actually looks like it might run about the right size or a little big. And I’m comparing shirts that he normally wears comfortably. And then I compared it to one of his shirts that is too long for his plaid shirts to wear stylishly with."
3.0,They slide down to my elbows
3.0,No pleat in back of shirt to allow for freedom of movement.
3.0,These don't seem to be made any best than a Walmart pair of house slippers. But my husband likes the design.
3.0,"I like these rosaries, but they break way too easily."
3.0,Very cute suit but I am 5'10&#34; and the suit was not long enough for me-had to return
3.0,"Loved the shirt, loved the material! But it fit a size smaller than it should of"
3.0,"I only gave 3 stars as of now because it did not fit my daughter. It's a hit or miss for her if a 16 or 18 fit due to cut. The 16 was too short (shes 5'6"" at 12), so if length is what you need, go a size up."
3.0,Pants are nice style.
3.0,I Received Both of the sweatsiutes and they both were to small one had a hole in the crouch of the pants but customer service helped me with a refund being that they don't carry a 2xl
3.0,"Nice dress, however, the zipper was of very cheap quality.  It broke apart when gently zipping it up only about 3 inches!"
3.0,It leak from the top around the edge. It will be better if it had rubber seal like one for Kurig 2
3.0,"It’s not my favorite purse, but it works. The inside pocket is already ripped and I’ve only had it for 2-3 months."
3.0,It says one size fits all but it's pretty big.
3.0,"Not exactly the material I wanted, more of a thin tshirt material. I was hoping for dressy. But nice shirts. Fits well, nice colors. You need a sports bra instead of regular bra so the straps don't show.  I may have missed that in the description.  The shoulder area contours to the back like a racer back style. But it's ok."
3.0,"They're a bit short and tend to bunch under my knees but then again I have a 34"" inseam so who knows. Everything else is fantastic. I'm 5'11"" and 220 and I got the XXL. They fit well and holy crap, pockets."
3.0,"The shoe is too small, my daughter is 9 and it didn't fit on her, if she wants the same boots l think she will need 10 or 10.5"
3.0,"Wore one pair once and the second time there is already a hole in the toe seam. They fit well and I like the style; however, I will return if another pair gets a hole."
3.0,It fits good and I like the material but it’s started to pill and look bad after 2 washes
3.0,"Overall the ear cuff is good for price and detail. It does dig into your ear in the beginning. Not sure if you get used to it, or the metal wears down. But, it becomes more comfortable to wear after time. I have a 13 year old wearing it."
3.0,Felt a little too tight for what I was expecting and the material makes me itchy. I would buy one size up for future reference
3.0,The hole where the material crosses in the front is a bit wide.  It looks like the shirt has an unintentional hole in it.  It's okay though.
3.0,Returned these tanks 2 times because I originally ordered a size 8-9 years and kept receiving 6-7 years. So the sizes are a deception. Other than that they a good material and fit great.
3.0,Its a cheap quality and took forever. But it was a nice touch to my outfit
3.0,The items are about half of size of y other AS Top key chains
3.0,the pants were way too small more like a medium instead of XXL.  Took weeks to finally arrive.
3.0,Fit is big
3.0,"Shorts are kinda short, too fits great!"
3.0,they're nice but too big for my wrists
3.0,Very cute but too small not a 4T.
3.0,These are ok especially for the price however I could not get them on...my earlobe is too fat I guess.
3.0,Loved this shirt but the fit was too small. The return was quick and easy and our account was credited within days.
3.0,Came smaller than expected. Haven't worn them for this reason.
3.0,"Yep, 12 bandanas all right.. All the same color, but definitely not uniform in size.  Only a problem if you are going to sew them together -- as I did.  It just means going the extra step of cutting them all to the same size.  Not a huge problem as all were approximately the same, but more time I didn't want to spend.  I couldn't find 12 banadanas locally in each of the 3 colors I needed so Amazon to the rescue!  For all I know, any I buy locally may not be uniform in size either.  Thanks."
3.0,You get what you pay for - cute but the bottoms are basically cardboard
3.0,"These are okay but sizing is very hard.  I got the 2XL (I'm a 32&#34; waste) and they're a little loose.  Also, these are really high wasted.  Also, the pouch is kind of low (not as much lift as I like).  Material is nice though."
3.0,Just didn't fit me well
3.0,"the slippers are fine, but you can find a better deal right on Amazon.  look for those."
3.0,Doesn't seem to be quite symmetric on the different panels but it serves its purpose
3.0,"Really nice plugs, but they were too big. I went up a size and they fit perfectly."
3.0,It was thinner than I thought. It's kinda a weird material. Sorta itchy.
3.0,"The straps are uncomfortable in your armpits. Fortunately, this is only a Halloween costume for me. I wouldn’t recommend it for anything else."
3.0,"Seems like a nice shirt, but runs small, requested to return to seller 2 weeks ago, still have not heard back, so I guess I’m stuck with a shirt that is too small"
3.0,Arrived super fast and did what it was supposed to. Loved it when I frist put on the necklace but the extender broke the first time I used it.
3.0,Dress was too small. Sizes run small.
3.0,Just fit oddly on my body.  Returned it.  Lovely fabric.
3.0,"This is not adjustable and is definitely for an adult.  When I tried to adjust the clasp broke :(  My son is disappointed, but I also should have paid more attention to the length"
3.0,"Just ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. Just an easy to wear dress that doesn’t look too cheap."
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these, one in white and one in black and they are different. The rib is thicker on the white than the black. The black ended up being more comfortable"
3.0,Not for plus size feet
3.0,It tends to slip off my scrubs unless I have it clipped in a certain way and the white butterfly piece broke off almost immediately after I opened the package because the adhesive used to hold it to the metal did not hold.
3.0,Nice design but very complicated to set up. Several people have attempted to set it up unsuccessfully.
3.0,"They’ve really cute, good fabric and well made.  This particular style of mask doesn’t fit me as well as pleated masks"
3.0,"I liked the look of this watch when I saw it online. When it arrived however, I found that it is much larger than I thought it would be. I'm a normal size guy but this watch would probably look better on someone closer to an NFL lineman. It's big! I do like the design though."
3.0,"It's pretty good. My only complaint is that the first layer droops down too much and I can't adjust the hook to make it fir more like a choker. I wish the beaded necklace fit more like a choker like the picture. But I'm pretty sure the picture (w the model) is not actually this exact product, I've seen the same one with a bunch of retailers."
3.0,"Really, really cute but has A LOT of stretch! Size down for sure. Also the holes frayed and opened up a lot after a few washes. Eventually I had to throw away. I got a few months of use out of them."
3.0,order a size smaller if you want them to fit now.
3.0,"It was supposed to be a slim fit sweater, but it was regular fit. But I love the color. I made it work."
3.0,Got black after wearing only 3 times
3.0,A decent neck wallet for the price.  Got us through the mean streets of Paris and London :D
3.0,"Disappointed, had to return"
3.0,"Cute boots, but there is no way the pair I received is a size 6.  They are either mis-labeled or there is something wrong with sizing for this particular style.  I couldn't even get my feet into them.  The old pair pictured next to them are a size 6 Ariat.  I will be returning these, unfortunately."
3.0,Relatively cheap but cute
3.0,Not as bright of a purple as pictured. Kind of a faded dark grayish purple. Disappointing
3.0,"We're Boggle addicts, and we purchased this for an international trip, where we obviously didn't want to tote the full-size game. It met our needs, but we found it a bit frustrating to use. The plastic cover that sits over the letters is permanently attached, which means when you're playing, the corner/seam on each side of the cover blocks your view of some of the letters. Also, the timer is only one minute, so you have to keep more of an eye on it, and flip it a couple times to get to three minutes.<br /><br />That said, it's very compact and it's handy that the timer snaps into the main gamepiece, so you don't have to worry about losing any parts. We'll continue to take this on international trips, but will use our regular game for home and road trips."
3.0,"I am missing the 6th bra! I have the black, white, green, blue, and pink but not the nude one!"
3.0,"When I took the gown out of the bag it looked like it had been balled up and stuffed in the bag. It was very wrinkled and had an odd smell - not bad enough to call it an odor, but odd for a new garment. I washed it before wearing."
3.0,Very happy with the quality of the items but we are missing the pony tail holders 🤔
3.0,"The print on the visor is a bit thick and cheap like paint, and visor Is a tad large but decent hat for the price and the right outfit"
3.0,The beads are beautiful.  My son really loves it.  The only issue he has is that it does not stay tight on his wrist.  The beads are pretty heavy and he is constantly tightening it.
3.0,"It's made out of nice material and didn't have smell like others have mentioned. However, it doesn't cover my mouth and nose as expected because of it being too large for my head. I tried to adjust with the strings but it doesn't hold very well and just goes right back to hanging under my chin. Definitely not what I was hoping for. Maybe I had the wrong idea of how this thing was supposed to work - so that may be my own fault completely. Either way, not pleased with my purchase. I think this would work better for a bulkier man than a short semi-petit woman."
3.0,"Cool style, bad cut for the pattern."
3.0,2nd try at these type pants. I'm a 38 waist and I ordered 40s. Still a bit tight and the front zipper broke almost immediately. Just split apart. I'll keep since this is just to walk my dog in the colder weather other wise I would return again. Previous pair was a different manufacturer but the same issue. Too small based on size. I'm also 6'3 and the inseam is too short too for a good fit.
3.0,"This shirt was about an inch shorter than the other Polo shirts that my husband wears, which made it seem smaller than the large that I ordered."
3.0,Nice stache. Wish it came with adhesive or spirit gum
3.0,I ordered red but this robe is a beautiful bright pink... almost hot pink (see picture of robe next to a red shirt). I got this for my son and pink just won't work for him. luckily I can give it to my niece who will love it.<br /><br />The robe is very soft and cute.  The shark part on the hood looks a bit cheap but I don't really mind that.<br /><br />I'd definitely give 5 stars if I would've gotten the right color.
3.0,"While the bag is beautiful and a good quality, the blue is a much lighter color than is seen in the picture. I bought it because I liked the combination of colors. The lighter blue does not go as well with the other colors."
3.0,The product is made of what it states but the size is not accurate and the skirt is not nearly as long as pictured.
3.0,Too small it does not fit my 17 years old daughter .nice shoe but..
3.0,"The picture provided must have been enlarged and enhanced over 1000 times. This was a mistake purchase on my part, but it served it's purpose (trying to get a visual of how a cartilage piercing would look). Glad I didn't spend a lot."
3.0,"The length for the arms are good, but, the length from the front and the back is somehow short"
3.0,Ok fades fast.
3.0,Thin material and runs small.
3.0,"The bag itself is well-made, but I'm super disappointed in the quality of the Velcro that is supposed to hold the bag shut. No zipper at all, and just some flimsy strips of Velcro that will most likely lose traction fairly quickly.<br />Not much in the way of interior compartments, just a small zippered pouch, but would work well for books or a small laptop.<br />Would not have purchased if I had known about the Velcro, but I think I can add my own snaps to make it sturdier."
3.0,Very pretty color and flows nice but it is quite large. I should have ordered a size down.
3.0,Stones came out
3.0,Turtle started to separate  from ring
3.0,"I liked the heart, the chain was not very good though. I have put on sturdier one"
3.0,"After a month, the top part of the P cracked and fell off the back window of my car. It was not snagged by the windshield wiper either. Not sure what happened."
3.0,"Came detached..... Thank goodness I had a jewelry making kit (Jump rings, tweezers) to put it back together. Other than that it's pretty and compliments my outfits."
3.0,Runs very small. No stretch or give at all. But it's beautiful.
3.0,The dress was cheap and appeared cheap.
3.0,"I liked the cushioning on this, but unfortunately the arch ridge did not hit my foot in the right spot, so they weren't comfortable for me to use."
3.0,Very cute but 2 rings didn’t work
3.0,It fits fine but I didn't like how it looked. The front draped a little too much so it looks like my belly is hanging over my pants.
3.0,"The fabric is not a heavy cotton rip-stop as most mil-spec are. This is a super, super lightweight poly blend. Don't place it in the dryer or on hot wash if you don't want a bunch of melted, shrunk material. It is beneficial if you are layering or in a hot climate, even using it at  night. Not a fan of the 1/4 zip collar, but that was the only option. Overall, two-stars and buyer beware. I wear a medium to large in US sizing and they shipped a XXL which fits me perfectly. Sized for smaller males."
3.0,"This is a fun cute bathing suit, the bottoms fit pretty true to size. I bought the top to hide my stomach a bit but it was a little long (even with ties at the sides) and came past the bottom half, it made me feel like my stomach so bigger-but I was looking for something super specific so give it a try."
3.0,I only gave it 3 stars because it fits kind of tight - so I would say these shirts and the material run small for a tighter than usual fit. I usually wear an extra large and have purchased dresses from this same company in extra large that fir fine. The shirts I guess just run small.
3.0,"Not super warm, my little one always complains that his hands are cold."
3.0,Since the size chart doesn’t show measurements I had to guess and it ended up being too large. The fabric is very sheer so you can definitely see color/swimsuit lines when wearing the cover up. My main complaint and reason I’ll be returning this is that the picture shows the lace detailing with a fabric backing when the actual product does not have any backing. You end up with a see-through lace stripe down the center of the cover up which looks cheap and unflattering.
3.0,Great pants but it’s about 1-2 sizes too small
3.0,Nice for the price. Didn't really like the fake diamonds which are hardly noticible anyway. A quick accessory.
3.0,I like the fit ... if you are comfortable wearing shirts that are too big for you.
3.0,It's a bit too yellow for me personally
3.0,Beautiful bra but scratchy. I start to feel it wearing on me after about 20 min and end up taking it off. Now it just sits in my drawer unfortunately
3.0,"The style is super cute, but the fabric feels and appears to be really cheap.  It's imperative that you hang dry this top. Otherwise, it will turn into a shriveled mess in the dryer.  I love the fringe on the sleeves, but I'm just disappointed in the quality."
3.0,A decent back up pair of glasses. They work.
3.0,Zipper handles fell off shortly after use and feels cheap. Zipper does work however needs a tie to use. Good room inside for my mat and water bottle
3.0,Wish they were smaller
3.0,These boots were cute but small. Returned for a larger size.
3.0,I tried them on and absolutely loved them. I am 5’5” and 128 pounds and a small fit perfectly.  Before I wore them I washed them and they are covered in pills. Absolutely everywhere. I followed the cleaning instructions and didn’t even dry them. I have to return them 😔
3.0,"Nice color and fabric not thin, but the sizing is off. Definitely size down. The dress was too big and the ruching was off"
3.0,"Great skirt, but within a few times of wearing it, the thread keeping the hem up started unraveling. I still wear it, but it quickly started looking less nice because of that..."
3.0,"This is a really warm hat, super cute and great color. It's a little too big though at least for a woman's head."
3.0,The fabric is very shiny which is okay if you like shiny shirts. But the biggest problem was that the bottom button struck right at the belly button and does not fit like a regular American shirt.
3.0,The logo started to wear off around day 3.  And I would imagine if you wash the hat it will totally disappear.
3.0,"A lovely shirt purchased for an adult as a gift at what would ordinarily be the correct size.  However, it was too small.  A medium is actually like a small.<br /><br />Chinese manufactured clothing products marketed to the US should be clearly identified with a size chart translated from the Chinese version to the actual US equivalent, the same way shoes are identified with US and European sizing."
3.0,"It's something I would buy for a child of the ages 10-14. I bought it for mother's day and didn't actually give it to my mom. For the price it's great, just not what I was really looking for."
3.0,"I like this dress and everything about it. It’s fits perfectly.. how I expected it to. However, the color of the pink in the picture is not the color I received. The dress itself is pink but a different shade of pink. It’s not as dark as shown in the picture. It’s more of a blush pink."
3.0,"It seemed like good quality but fell apart after about four months. Oh well, it didn't cost much."
3.0,"The date, and time are not showing."
3.0,I wish I’d liked these but I just can’t find myself wearing or ordering them again.  The material is harsh against sensitive areas and the fit is somewhat small after washing and drying them on medium heat.  The length is okay but they tend to ride up on the inner thighs.  The waist band is as wide as most brands tend to be but it’s tighter than the measurements suggest.
3.0,"They look beautiful in picture but is awful and low quality. Not worth the price. This was a gift for my boss and I cannot give it away because I don’t give away something not good enough for my self.<br /><br />The finish is rough, shiny less and looks like I cost no more than 10 bucks"
3.0,Very glad with the product!!
3.0,"Cute set. But at 5'1, the shirt is a little short. The elastic band on the shorts is a little tight and annoying. Not bad for the price, I wear it, but find myself reaching for more comfy pjs."
3.0,Came in complete. Other than that my grand nieces loved them.
3.0,If it wasn't for the defected charging port this would be the best way ever owned
3.0,Two came in messed up and it came with an extra piece other than that they are beautiful and worth money
3.0,It is a nice material and feels great against the skin but overall it fit smaller that what was shown in description. I had gapping at the breast but still like the blouse overall
3.0,"I bought these to embellish a jean jacket pocket. They are cute, but not made well. The posts are glued on and don’t hold up well. Too bad."
3.0,"I like this hat, it is very cute, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. I wore it once and the flowers have come away a little already. There is a red woolen thread that sticks out no matter what I do and is pretty obvious. Why in earth would you use red thread on a gray hat?"
3.0,Leather not as soft and supple as expected for full grain leather. Color is also lighter than it appears in the image.
3.0,Agree with previous reviewer that nose clip is less helpful - should be longer and more bendable<br /><br />Real issue is the chin - it just doesnt fit right. Masks with a seam at the chin fit better...
3.0,Very disappointed in this piece. The hook is too wide - keeps falling off. Therefore unable to wear
3.0,"Good if you're looking for functionality and not much style! Looks waterproof and durable, but very crinkly and makes lots of noise. I returned it since I was looking for a main purse - but seemed like a good product for the price. Would recommend a baggalini if you're looking for more of a ""purse"" style tho!"
3.0,"very pretty. nice colors, but too small for me."
3.0,"I didn't get the same pants that I originally ordered the ones I got are a brand called bailydel. They fit ok but do sit a bit high they are nice for around the house but I probably won't wear them to the gym, they are just not the fit I prefer. Very nice colors. I got the black grey and black combo. They are a little bit shinier then I usually pick but are thick enough that they are not see through. I would have given 5 stars but I didn't actually get the pants pictured. But all in all they are fine enough for the price"
3.0,the hat looks good but the &#34;snakeskin&#34; part that buckles the hat in the back is just two pieces of snakeskin-printed cloth glued together and they came unglued within the first few days so now when i wear it it flops around
3.0,The fit was not as expected. The shorts are more boxy than the picture (less of an upside down v shape like in the picture) so not great for curvy figures. The thighs were too tight and the waist was too loose.
3.0,I wanted dry fit shirt.  This is more a cotton shirt that dry fit.
3.0,"I was hoping that I would be able to wear this necklace myself, but I ended up having to give it to my 5 year old daughter, because the chain is only barely long enough for her to use. The chain length should be provided, prior to purchasing this product. Also, don't order it if you need it within more than a month. It literally took almost 6 weeks to receive this purchase."
3.0,Has the kookband feel of plastic
3.0,"These shoes are great but the insoles that come with them move around way too much inside the shoe. I had to constantly adjust the insole to make them more comfortable. Putting something on the underside of the insoles could work but I replace them with Dr. Scholls gellin' insoles but they are a little thicker and heavier and they have grip on the bottom (silicone) so they stay put and are comfortable.<br />Great shoes, insoles need to be anchored or replaced immediately though."
3.0,"They glasses are fun but the pic was different from the true product, but there fun!!"
3.0,I have a big head and this sucker is huge.
3.0,Pros: comfortable to wear. Not too tight. Buttons on the side for holding mask if you don't like behind the ears. Nice colors<br /><br />Cons: Same buttons doesn't allow clearance to keep mask from rubbing or pressing down on ears. 2 pieces sewn together which occasionally rolls downward. Not as wide as others I have bought.<br /><br />Still decent head bands
3.0,"wouldn’t buy them again, but they were okay."
3.0,"I'm giving it to my mother because I'm a bit taller. I'm 5'7 and my arms are long so just keep that in mind, this is an Asian site so just keep that in mind or look at the sizing."
3.0,I sent the first one back hoping the 2nd would be better.  It was off center too.  Too busy to return.  Sad because the pendant is cute.
3.0,"They they are a little big, but roomy,  but these are not high waisted at all."
3.0,It is good material not flimsy or heavy. The color is good. It is a breezy shopping dress. I gave five stars because somehow I feel it is ill fitting. But best for the buck.
3.0,"Most XL fit me very well, but this one seemed a bit tight, mainly by the armpits. Also the material used for this looks and feels different from what is in the picture and what is written on the tag. It literally feels like I am wearing a scrub. Also I thought that the buttons were usable, they're not. The lace string on the neck is also not usable either. Bit disappointed. Color was pretty and same as photo though, so I'll give it that. I won't be returning it, but will gift it to another.<br /><br />Is it worth buying? To me no.<br />Is it a big loss? No."
3.0,Tight in the legs area
3.0,"The hem is lopsided, other than that it's a cute dress. Definitely too short to wear without leggings or shorts if you have any kind of booty. I'm size 16 and 5'5"" and it came just below my butt."
3.0,lightweight plastic nothing fancy
3.0,Lots of fun wearing it to a party.
3.0,"It definitely holds my bra straps up and prevents them from slipping off my shoulders. There are two problems with the product, though. The first is that it's difficult to get it on thicker bra straps without feeling like I was going to break it. More importantly, I could not get it on my bra straps by myself. I tried putting my bra on backwards, attaching one side before I put it on, etc, but could not do it. And no matter how carefully I took my bra off, I couldn't get it to stay on for the next wear. Needless to say, my bra straps only stay up when my husband is around to put these on for me."
3.0,"Too small, order one size bigger."
3.0,It does run a bit large but that's not a problem. It's very cute and lightweight however it is see through! I purchased this to wear to a family outing and didn't notice it was see through until I was in the sun. Had I not worn it I would have definitely sent it back it wasn't appropriate attire for the occasion. With that being said thank god I had on black boy shorts and a bra!!! So as long as you're aware you can hide your parts :) I think it great for a night out or whatever but I'm disappointed and embarrassed that I did not know it was sheer!
3.0,Ok but ran really small
3.0,Decently made but not flattering in the least.
3.0,Not as  great quality as pandora so I don't want it on my bracelet but I would consider putting it on a bracelet by itself
3.0,DO NOT BUY! BROKE AFTER 10 MINUTES OF WEARING. AND CANNOT GET REFUND.
3.0,"a bit too sheer for me but it's used as a swimsuit cover up.  fit is as expected.  I got this one in black.  bell sleeves, kimono style, tie front."
3.0,"I couldnt really get past the fact that they werent all real, but its still acceptable. the necklace is bigger than i would have wanted."
3.0,"These are beautiful, but they’re both suppose to be stainless steel. I’m a bit confused."
3.0,"Was hoping they would be a lighter weight, fit was a bit too generous"
3.0,"Nice tank tops for working out, but very thin and see through. No compression by any means."
3.0,could be more rhinestones
3.0,The 4yr old and 7 yr old loved them. But after a few times opening and closing the lens I noticed one lens was loose and fell off. We could snap it back in place but it kept coming off. Big disappointment.
3.0,This dress is cute but it is so sheer and see thru. I wanted to love this dress but unfortunately it’s not as flowy as advertised in photograph. Truly not the same dress.
3.0,This is the third hat I've ordered. The first two (other brands) broke or came broken). This one came highly recommended but you need A VERY small head. I could barely get it on; it was way tight; and the speakers were behind my ears. Returned immediately. 😥
3.0,Sized best for a teenager
3.0,I had to selled to someone else
3.0,"These turned out to be way too big for my face so they weren't my favorite but they may work out better on someone else. (I'm a 5'5 male, 160lbs to give you an idea of my frame)."
3.0,"These pants were OK. No back pockets and the front pockets were actually on the side, not in the front. I would not consider these low rise. They were mid rise, and the front was a bit higher than the back. Not fond of that. However, the color was nice (I ordered a blue) and they were very soft. The fit was good also.  I returned them because of the rise, but might have kept them otherwise."
3.0,Cute shoes. But got squeezed in the package which makes me disappointed
3.0,Too busy for my diva rear end.
3.0,"Not as flattering as I anticipated.  The material is nice and thick, but the elastic band is tight (even though I have the right size it is very &#34;elasticky&#34;).  Also the waist cuts off just below the bust which is not flattering. Just makes me look dumpy with not a good waistline and my body type is not too bad honestly."
3.0,Very warm but really stiff
3.0,"This anklet is pretty for a once or twice wear.  I received mine in the mail yesterday and it came shining and in a pretty pouch. I opened it and it has knots in it. Please see the pics. Once you put it on, you can’t see them as much, however you know they are there.  Take a look at the pics and you can see the knots on pic #2.  Overall I give it 3 stars out of 5 because it got me though the day.  If you are looking to have something to wear more than once, I would not pick this one."
3.0,DID NOT LIKE THE MATERIAL.  SIZE RUNS LARGER THAN EXPECTED.
3.0,They fit fine in smaller sizes but as the size increase they become too wide
3.0,The star is very small and hard to tell it’s the Northern Star.
3.0,Very lightweight plastic the feel is cheap. They are basic the size is great!
3.0,"It is so cute and I felt like a sexy princess when I wore it,however it did tarnish quick. I'd buy another one but I would have to put a clear coat of nail polish on it."
3.0,"Good quality product, just not my style when worn in person, too &#34;blingy&#34;, would have rather had a brushed or pvd finish."
3.0,"Feels nice. Knit is a nice gage, but if you want black and white, be aware this is Grey and White."
3.0,"The outside color is beautiful and I love the texture. The only problem I have is with the inside, its like a vinyl material and stinks. Not to happy with the inside but I love the outside of the wallet."
3.0,It is Ok.
3.0,there was a red stain on my shirt when i got it. super cute fits perfect but really bummed that it has a stain
3.0,I gave this sweater to my daughter and she complained me saying it is very itchy to wear and rough. Fitting is very small for my daughter and she is 11year.<br /><br />The color is not bright for kids especially for girls. This color may be good for boys.
3.0,"sizes run small, a 3x I ordered was maybe an Xl."
3.0,Lasted a day...then somehow broke...
3.0,I ordered the black but was shipped another color. I like the material.
3.0,"The white is a little close to feeling like you're playing out the scene in ""Risky Business"" where Tom Cruise's character dances around in a white button down, socks and skivvies.<br /> Anyway- I purchased the white in a size large (I am 5'7"", approximately 175lbs. and my measurements are 36DD-33-44 1/2 before shapewear) because the seller stated over and over ""runs big!"" but the size chart doesn't give waist or hip measurements which REALLY would have helped since, on me, it pulls at the hips so the buttons gap and pull slightly even with shapewear but if I had ordered an XL, it would have been too large everywhere else. Lastly, I like the off-center design of the buttons but my buttons went straight down so I feel like I lost some of the aesthetic with that.<br /> On a more positive note: the material felt thinner than I expected but very nice- soft and sleek while sturdy enough to not pill or snag on every little thing, and for a white dress, surprisingly not very sheer.<br /> On the whole, I really, really wanted to like this dress. I was ready to order two more- one in light blue and (of course) one in black but after the fit of the white and reading other reviews, it seems like there is no uniformity in sizing. (I'd attach a picture, but I don't have full length mirrors in my house. I have one mirror that reflects head and torso just above the waist.)"
3.0,Pretty dress but to long.
3.0,It was inexpensive so I purchased it to try it out.  It seems okay but the color isn't as brown as I had hoped or what it looked like online.  I probably won't wear it unless I purchase something that would match this color.
3.0,It’s a cute romper but the legs are not as loose and flowy
3.0,"The holes for the drawstring have no seams, and they began to fray after the very first washing. An unacceptable flaw in such an expensive product. Sent it back, hoping the lack of seams was limited to the specific pair of shorts I got. If it's a universal design flaw, I'll demand a refund and look elsewhere."
3.0,These mittens are awesome. But the part to tighten on one at the wrist broke after 3 uses. I’m hoping to find a way to fix it. But for something of this quality I was kind of hoping parts would not break this fast. Maybe mine is simply a dud or something?
3.0,"the stone was glued off center, but it is beautiful."
3.0,"There is no ""Wideness"" to the inside pocket, love the style just no width to take items in or out. Just need to add at least 1/2 inch  or 1"" would be great"
3.0,Hard to get my foot in then too big once it was on.
3.0,"These bands are cool, but I noticed that almost evertime I try to stretch them over my wrist the adjustable band slips on me.  I switched back to the traditional clasp for now."
3.0,"Pants are made well, however they are giant, even elastic waist doesn't help. Also has one of those drop crotches that doesn't allow you to kick freely... makes no sense to me..."
3.0,"Went off the sizing chart and reviews. I'm 5'2 120lbs, athletic shape. Got a small and it was too small. I also found that it was too long for my torso. The top of the cinches had to be left open for my boobs to fit through which gives an unflattering look. Seems like it's good quality and would be nice had it fit."
3.0,The set was a nice quality but too large and I thought the duster was too long. I  returned it.
3.0,"had the images been up to date, I would have not purchased.  much smaller than pictured"
3.0,"A little smaller than expected but not too bad. It has that fishy smell to it when you open it, and the worst thing is that it squeaks like crazy"
3.0,It's a nice case but kinda on the flimsy side.
3.0,This plate isn't worth the price...it's a good idea but far to costly for a thim plastic plate and the mat is almost a joke!
3.0,"This product is simple and does the job - the only problem is that you absolutely are getting what you pay for. The product feels and looks cheap. Its so thin and light that its hardly absorbant, so if you're looking for heavy duty sweat absorption, look else where. If you're like me, and just want a simple and cheap sweatband for you head to keep your hair from flopping all around, then this product is for you."
3.0,"I would have given them a 5 star rating if I hadn't already glued back on 3 of the flowers, within the first week. The kids love them."
3.0,"Sorry folks but my particular item only stretched the hat to barely 7 3/4, & tight fitting at that. Certainly will not go to 9 1/2."
3.0,"Cute fabric- I  liked the cut and pattern of the dress, but it is too small. Ordered 3x and it fit more like a 2x."
3.0,"It is seriously lacking in form and fit, and seems very cheaply made to me. It's not totally horrible, but I rarely wear it"
3.0,"This watch is beautiful, however the color started to rub off immediately. I won't be purchasing another."
3.0,The bar is small not long. This would be for someone who have tiny nipples. It doesn't provide any room. Worn once and never again.
3.0,too large but if just looking for a simple wrap sunglasses...then these will work
3.0,The shirts are cute but so small. I sized up 2 sizes and they were still too small. Size 12-14 fits like a 5-6 in US kids sizes.
3.0,"This body is very thin, the border is not nicely finished. Fine if you only need it for an event like I did but wont endure much use."
3.0,"The ad is misleading.  The ad clearly says ""8 pack Adjustable Reflective VEST.  Ad should've stated ""2 Pack""!"
3.0,I don’t like the built-in panty
3.0,Kinda cheap in the inside but I like how the outside looks!
3.0,Exactly like the picture. Exactly what I wanted.
3.0,"You get what you pay for- it's a cheap costume hat. It does fit quite a few different sized heads so that is good. Me, my husband, my mom and my brother were all able to wear it.<br />When it's in good condition it looks decent but once it gets crushed or smushed at all the hat is pretty much done for- even once I pushed it back into shape there were still wrinkles and bumps that wouldn't come out (see picture).<br /><br />I received a free hat to review but all opinions are my own."
3.0,Cute but not newborn size at all
3.0,It shrinks in length a lot  it fit great and at first then washed and shrunk in length. The two pairs where also two different sizes in length.
3.0,"I kept this bag even though I'm not really happy with it. It's difficult to zip and has an indention or pulled in area on one side that seems permanent. It came folded and packed flat,  bad idea for this type of bag. The shipping was slower than I expected. I do like the color and it seems sturdy. I'm not sure what it's made of,  the tag on it says leather."
3.0,"This was kind of a letdown, but it did the job.  I was expecting the hat to be a little more satin'ish material because of the picture, but no biggie.. it is more of a cotton.  I got it for a trip to Disneyland for my son that we took in September.  The quality was not great, as I could see where the ears were sewn in but not pushed in all the way so it popped out (and looked terrible, if really looking at it) but the size was right, and adjustable.  My son (3 years old), daughter (8 years old), and myself rotated wearing the hat as it was hot out and we had to take turns letting our head breathe. I posted pictures, I will look for the hat and take pictures up close showing the sewing quality. Again, it was a cute hat, and I love the style, I just took 2 stars off because of the ears not being sewn in properly."
3.0,I'm 5 ft and S sizes while pregnant and this fits a bit too big for me! But I can still make it work bc of the adjustable straps!
3.0,Loved this but it broke within a month.
3.0,"My 87 year old dad cannot put these socks on by himself.  They are so tight.  Once they are on, he says they feel good.  Due to swelling after stent surgery in his leg, the seams leave indents in his legs."
3.0,"Bought this and it was so tangled when I get it, it was awful! Looks ok but tangles a lot when you wear it!"
3.0,This dress is not well made and is looks cheap.  I am thinking of returning it if it is not too much of a hassle.  I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Nice set but runs small for size.  Shinks after washing
3.0,The dress fits good. The material quality is ok considering the price but I was disappointed to realize the top is not lined at all so another under garment will be required.
3.0,The stone fell out within 6 weeks of purchase.
3.0,"Pretty sweater but weird fit and the fabric was much heavier than advertised, it is soft fabric though. Unfortunately returned since it was really big on top but tight fit around waist."
3.0,"Product was exactly what was listed, but I guess I just have small ear lobes as the ring looked like a regular hoop on me rather than the ""hug"" of the ear lobe which was supposed to happen. Oh well! Guess I've got my girl's next present a little early! haha"
3.0,This is a really nice little projector.  It displays the images nicely on the ceiling.  The moon and stars are clear and the colors are pretty.  I really like having the option to have it sit stationary withe the dome on it and use it as a night light or take the dome off and make it rotate with the images shining.  I was worried that it might be too loud according to other reviews but the noise isn't as loud as others made it out t be and it does not really bother us because we have a noise machine/air cleaner on in the room for white noise.<br />The only down fall I see to this lamp projector is that there is no on and off button.  I have to actually take the batteries out of it to shut it off.  No clear instructions so I may be missing it.
3.0,the button broke off after 2 weeks
3.0,Color was true to image and I liked the length. The bottom has WAY too much fabric.
3.0,I like the fit but the material is too thin in my opinion.
3.0,the zipper scratches me all the time have to keep zipped up so cause less inside bts still cuts me thi
3.0,"It's cozy and very soft but the sewing isn't great. The drawstrings on the hood, the bottom lining and the seams around the zipper are all fringed. If I wasn't lazy I'd send it back but for the price I guess you can't expect perfection"
3.0,"The bra fits a little small, not enough to exchange.  Nice quality!"
3.0,La chamarra le quedo muy bien .... el pantalon es un poco pequeño
3.0,"Good quality for the price, but the color is off. Red looks more like a maroon or deep burgandy."
3.0,The fit is perfect but I hope the garment is thicker.
3.0,"At first, this is a pretty nice coat. it's warm and I liked the color. The design of it is very pretty. A quickly started noticing several loose threads all over the jacket and it looked sloppy. The hood also has more of a &#34;sporty&#34; look. I wanted something more polished, and something that didn't looklike it would unravel in a few weeks."
3.0,Fit was pretty good. A little tight through the shoulders.  Had what looked like an ink line on the front.  Small but noticeable
3.0,Don’t like the rubber
3.0,"I do really like this jumpsuit, fits just like the picture- my only gripe is the way the neck sits after its tied, it's a bit loose but still cute"
3.0,"I really like this necklace and so does my fiancé, but three of the stones on the silver piece have already fallen out even though I’ve been very careful with it. I don’t know where they went so I can’t put them back in. Seller hasn’t offered to replace or repair yet, but hopefully they can. Amazon is only giving me the option to return it, which I don’t want to unless I know it can be replaced."
3.0,"Two of them fit normally, one is small and is child sized. Do not machine dry, air dry/hang dry only or the stiching of the design will come loose."
3.0,"Works fine, a little smaller than I thought"
3.0,Overall Bracelet looks ok but string is coming apart after two days of wearing
3.0,I bought the blue in large and the red in extra large.  The large was too small.  I'm a size 10!  Order up!
3.0,I love the band but my only problem is that on the site it shows it being really pink and my wrist band looks more like it’s white with brown and greenish hues to it...I have a marble phone case and the I picture it shows on amazon would’ve matched it perfectly but this one I’m just not so in love with. I’m gave it 3 stars because it’s color is not true to the picture of the one i specifically bought.
3.0,Ordered 2 sets only 1 arrived mirrored other clear was a costume deal kinda a bummer but otherwise good product for price
3.0,"If you decide to purchase this item please order 1 size bigger. The sleeves are tight, if you have any definition on your upper arms like myself, you  may have issues with the fit. The t-shirt is well made as well as the design"
3.0,I ordered the darker jacket and received the lighter one. I am normally a small/medium. I got a large per reviews. I probably should of gotten an xl to be able to wear a sweater under it but it will fit a long sleeve shirt fine. Disappointed because I wanted the darker one but the lighter one will do.
3.0,They are plenty big alright but thats what i wanted ( maybe a little too big). Almost too big but lenses seem to block sun well have only used once will work good for fishing.
3.0,"Was advertised as a 2 pack but came with only one band. Glad I bought 2, however wanted 4! For $9, would not have bought only 1. This slap band is what I am wanting but a bit high for only 1. If it had 2 as advertised I would have rated at 5 stars."
3.0,Fits weird. Crouch is odd and the shorts are long. Makes you looks short. 5’6” and 150. Got the medium.
3.0,These earrings are cute but the quality is terrible.
3.0,"Made for a long-torso person, which is not me! Too long in the armpit area and the lace backing gapped big time. A friend wore the same one to the wedding we attended and she looked stunning in it... She's also very tall and very slender. I'm 5'4&#34; and muscular. It was not made for me!"
3.0,"Cute ring, a bit thin in substance (thought it would be a bit thicker, but for a novelty ring it's just fine).' My only complaint is that it Runs a bit small in size. Ordered 2 different sizes (according to my husbands measurment from a jewelry store and 1/2 size larger) and neither fit. Having to return which is a very easy process! The sizing and returning is why I could only give 3 ⭐️, other than that (like I mentioned) it's a cute ring for a Zelda enthusiast!"
3.0,"I had ordered the blue shirt like this one and wear it all the time. Decided to order one or more in different colors but they don't fit the same even though they are the same size. Had to return this one, very unflattering."
3.0,They are cute but to stretchy. They are definitely not made for toddlers. I actually ended up gifting them to adults.
3.0,Very nice but very short.
3.0,"The sweater is good, kind of a felt material with elastic at the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the sweater.  However, we didn't receive the wig at all. It wasn't in the package. We weren't really planning on using it, anyway, but we didn't exactly get everything we paid for.  Since I was just after the sweater, it'll do."
3.0,They're kinda small & cheap looking. Maybe cool for a kid but Im not that pleased at how small the chain is & the skeletons aren't that big either.
3.0,I was in love with this coat until the zipper dismantled within a few uses.  Onto Carthartt…
3.0,Cute!! I like it because it was cheap...lol
3.0,"Good polish but a very light tan, not brown at all"
3.0,Its not at all the color that it looks like in the picture. I was expecting more of a tangerine and its actually bright almost neon orange. It generally fits ok but the straps on the top are kind of weird. Some are super loose and dont quite lay right unless you keep pulling it down. But otherwise fits fine (I'm 5'9 weigh 145 size 34D and got the Large)
3.0,This is smaller than I expected. My checkbook will not even fit in the zipper part.
3.0,Is nice... but I bought small size and is too big and the back is not like the picture the bands are too high.
3.0,"The good thing about this is the extender part is on there, and I will use it as an anklet as soon as I find a heavier gauge for a bracelet.  This is very thin, almost childlike."
3.0,"These socks are so cozy, soft & warm but do not hold up well after washing and drying. They are now my daughter's size. A good buy if you don't dry them."
3.0,"The colors are pretty,the ball size was a little bigger than I expected"
3.0,"When I received it, it was already worn with armpit stains and all. I still tried it on and realized there were no frilling in the back (disappointing). If the frilling was also in the back and it wasn’t previously worn, I’d probably keep it."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Ok quality.
3.0,"The great design of the mask was marred by the slick, unpleasant fabric. Cotton would have been perfect and would have worked well for the filter pocket."
3.0,"It’s a pretty skirt but the elastic at the waist line is way too tight and it makes the whole skirt blue now so it’s not a good look, I think I ordered two sizes up also"
3.0,Tried them on when they arrived and they are lightweight and comfortable. I washed them on delicate in cold water and I didn't put them in the dryer. They did shrink a little all over. Haven't worn them yet.
3.0,"Received three 12g and only 1 14g, luckily I was able to get a 12g in one ear and only needed the 14g for a few days in the ear that had closed up a bit smaller than the other.  The smaller gauge spirals are definitely more fragile, but I had no issues with catching or breakage."
3.0,"This is an update. Customer service did their best for us. It was purchased as a gift. It did take forever, the seller resent item.<br />Review from recipient:<br />Review:<br /><br />This dress is a very light weight, soft material that is good for summer heat.  It is hand wash or dry clean only which is not ideal for a new mother, but at least my child will be stylin and comfortable.<br /><br />This dress is a very light weight, soft material that is good for summer heat.  It is hand wash or dry clean only which is not ideal for a new mother, but at least my child will be stylin and comfortable."
3.0,"Great product BUT in order to register, you must belong to Facebook.  I do not.  This diminishes the value of the product for me."
3.0,"It's very tent-like.  It won't hug your body.  The quality of the shirt is pretty good, though.  It uses fabric similar to those super-smooth, sweat-free shirts that athletic companies use, if that makes sense.  But it looks just like the picture, and I find cats dressed like people HILARIOUS! lol"
3.0,"Really beautiful and very dainty and delicate, it runs small and tight, but it was a good fit for a petite friend."
3.0,"The case itself is beautiful. However, the screen protector that came with it was opaque within a week."
3.0,"Unless you are shaped like a tall pencil, these may look strange on you. Even my daughter, who is 5’7”, and a size 8, but not a stick, had a hard time figuring out how these would work. Denim is mid-weight. Quality looks fine. Just a strange fit that doesn’t allow for for curves or short people. I am 5’4” and a size 10/11"
3.0,"These are huge glasses, I'm not a big sunglass type of person and with these on top of my regular glasses they look very big. Maybe my face is just too small for these. They are nice glasses but just too big for my taste."
3.0,"I really like the dress!  The cut is flattering - the color is rich - the value for the product ratio is excellent.  The only problem is that it is too small.  I wear a medium and I noticed comments said the dress runs small, so I ordered a large - well, nope... It doesn't fit.  Size large is actually size small. Duly noted for future purchases."
3.0,"worth getting, was a bit small."
3.0,"They mixed up my order, so that’s why I gave it 3/5 stars (I ordered these before as well)<br />Other than that it’s great!<br />Pros:<br />-fit well<br />-I can flip it in and hide it in my nose for work<br />-paint stays on and doesn’t chip<br />-easy to put on, the screw is on the ring part and insertion is on the ball<br />Cons:<br />-the gold and the rose gold both look gold<br />-if you shower with them, they will start to rust where the screw is ( but it can still screw on)"
3.0,"I ordered this piece for a day party. I received it in the mail rather quickly.  The fit was a bit snug for me.  the length of the pants was 2"" shorter than I anticipated.  I was unable to wear it to the day party but it makes for a nice pair of pajamas for me."
3.0,"decent quality, nothing spectacular."
3.0,"The size is just like the description I bought and XL and fit great... I change my review since the blouse colorfast, it ruin my best bra."
3.0,These pajamas are cute and comfortable. However I would not recommend them because they are supposed to be machine washable but hang to dry. Really? Who wants to hang to dry every day pajamas. I intend to throw them in the dryer and see what happens.
3.0,"I opened the box and saw how huge they were. I assumed from the picture they would be slightly larger than a regular nose ring, but these look like earrings. Even the bar is thick...it looks like 16G based on thickness.<br />They are pretty, but am returning"
3.0,"It's super cute, but the other person who purchased it and wrote a review was right. I had not even had mine on for 24 hours and one of the parts fell out."
3.0,I ordered an XL based off their sizing chart ( I usually wear a medium). When I got it it was so big I could slide it right off without unzipping it. It was cute but I sent it back and ordered a different style
3.0,"This item is ok. I don't like that you can see right through it, but other than that I love how it fits and the dress flows very well."
3.0,Purchased for my son's 8th birthday. They fit about half of the kids
3.0,I like the style they have and they cut the sun. You can tell these are not expense by the feel but they do the job and do not look bad.
3.0,"These are nice earrings: perfect for when one doesn't need to look sophisticated. Only problem is that the size that I chose was too small, and the photos available do not give good representations of the correct sizes."
3.0,"Overall, I enjoy some of the pieces but not others. Each piece is different.<br /><br />SKULL FANG:<br />This piece is simple and hangs well from the ear.<br /><br />TIGER CUFF:<br />To make this stay on my ear, I had to bend the tail into a slightly different position so it would curl around my ear. It doesn't hurt and was easy to adjust.<br /><br />HANGING ARROWS:<br />This piece I also had to bend slightly to make it fit on my ear. It's interesting to feel the arrows swinging as you walk around. If you were too energetic they would probably come off, but if you're going to class for the day they'll probably be fine.<br /><br />GOLD SQUIGGLY THING:<br />This piece I actually had to bend the stem completely to the side and wear as just an ear cuff. It was definitely designed for small ears, so people with normal/large ears will either have to bend it somehow or get rid of the earring part as I did.<br /><br />HANGING ICICLES:<br />This piece hangs in a strange way, and it's the type of cuff that you have to bend open and closed. It doesn't fit well.<br /><br />SPIKES/CHAIN:<br />This actually fits really well. I have short hair, so I had to use a bobby pin to make the hair clip stay in place, but it feels really cool to wear and looks great.<br /><br />OVERALL THOUGHTS:<br />These pieces are mostly good, but overall they're meant for smaller ears. If you have normal/large ears you'll probably have to resize them a little bit. They did come in a small pouch, but I don't think I'll use it for storage because I would be worried about them tangling."
3.0,Stripes didn’t line up right. Had to repurchase  Its very long; great for tall people
3.0,"Very pretty dress, sizing is way off... I ordered a small and it was more like a large. The return process was very easy."
3.0,The black covering is a see through mesh.  I am nearly 70 years old.  I don't need a see through top - that's why I bought this.  Otherwise it is a very nice top.
3.0,Nice but was a little bulky for my finger
3.0,"Overall I like this top okay.  I'd say it runs just a bit large, although the sleeves are quite short for my long arms.  The color is very different than pictured.  Mine was much more of a pinky mauve color than the wine shown."
3.0,"Charms or nice but I would like more of a variety instead of just flowers. Also, some charms (the butterflies) require glue so they can stick inside the holes. Otherwise, good product"
3.0,I did not like that the design is in the front and the back of the sweat shirt.  I also thought it was black but it's really blue.
3.0,These are very pretty earrings. My only complaint is that they are a bit too small.  But I tend to like long earrings because of my hairstyle. I do recommend them to women who like smaller earrings.
3.0,Not only are these great gifts for the groomsman. They are so cool and make for a great photo opp!!
3.0,"No shape, very cheap, need to wear a belt with it for any shape. Really wanted to love this dress…. Loved the versatility with the sleeves, it could be off the shoulder or on the shoulder.<br />The dress runs very large."
3.0,It does look good but the sleeves were a bit short and the fabric doesn't feel great.
3.0,I wore this once under a vest and it worked but I wouldnt buy again
3.0,"this is pearl like beads sewn onto a ribbon tie sash,  it was kind of stiff.  We returned it"
3.0,"Pros: the fun print, sizing seems ok.<br />Cons: the material is not cotton, feels cheap, shorts fit weird.<br /><br />I'm 5'7 and weight about 166 pounds. Waist 28 inches and hips 45 inches  I got a large."
3.0,Pretty good gloves for cold commutes. They wear kinda fast but for the price they are good. Don't wanna rate too high as they aren't the best gloves I've used but they've seen plenty of mtb and commuting use and they lasted almost two seasons and I'm just now ready to replace them.
3.0,they worked great but the ball and threads broke off after a while
3.0,These are very cute but I would not recommend wearing these too often or to the club unless you carry around gorilla glue<br />Or something lol
3.0,"It fit well, but I didn't like the way it looked overall. I felt very costumey, like Dolly Parton. I tried to tame it with a black cardigan and waist belt, but it just wasn't for me. The sequins made layering awkward and uncomfortable. Maybe if it were sleeveless or the sleeves were non-sequined in a contrasting color or black, that might be better. It was also very heavy and scratchy. I read some reviews saying it wasn't scratchy but I found the interior of the dress under the lining to be very scratchy and uncomfortable in the short time I wore it to try it on. There were also some snags in the lave overlay, and one very scratchy thread sticking out of the sleeve. The fit was god though. For size reference, I followed the item's size chart and got both L and XL to try. I'm a 38D with a 35ish inch waist and 40ish inch hips and a slight pooch. The L fit quite well. The XL was too roomy. Both were a good length on me, at 5'5&#34;, 150lbs. I like the way the skirt fell, and the sleeves were a good length and fit around my thick arms. I personally liked the idea of the sequined dress better than I liked the actual dress, but someone else might like it just fine."
3.0,Loved it but it broke after wearing once
3.0,"they are so pretty but still irritated my ears, gave them to my daughter who does not have nickel allergy"
3.0,It’s cute...not as big as I thought it’d be and there were a few small marks on it so going to try and clean with a wet wipe but it’s definitely cute for a night out
3.0,"I was pleased to receive this belt, however it is a yellow color, rather than silver.  I was rather disappointed to discover that it was made in China.  In addition the way the buckle is mounted on leather would make it difficult to transfer to another belt material"
3.0,I brought this for my 2 month old baby i got a 3month old in size and it's too small. I this not return  it because i don't have the time  to bother; but wish it was bigger .
3.0,"I don't mind the product. It fit well, but started to fall apart a couple of months after purchase."
3.0,"I bought these for my boys... Who have very different body styles.  My 10 year old is TINY, only about 60 lbs, very long and lean. He can wear between a 6 to an 8. My 7 year old is 80 lbs, stocky build, wears a 10. I bought up a size (10&12) but it didn't matter. These shirts are VERY slim fit and a bit sheer. Wasn't impressed. Returned them both."
3.0,Loved it exactly what i expected.
3.0,Wish the seller would consider making a sturdier version available even if it costs a little more.  I am a bit concerned about the clasp and how bendable it is if pinched.
3.0,Didn’t like the color too bright and shiny for camouflage. Like the little pocket for the filter but materiel seemed too thick.
3.0,The pin one 1 side is too short! I sent the 1st one back and got a replacement. The replacement had the same issue! I eventually replaced that pin with one I had at home but I had to cut the band slightly  to do it! I do like the color of this band and it looks nice on my wrist!
3.0,I love these boots but unfortunately they ran super small and the inside flap was very irritating.  Not a big deal boots are hard to order.
3.0,This purse is very beautiful but it seems to peel after a month material is slightly week
3.0,Had it for about a month & lost 2 stones.
3.0,"I find the bill of the hat kind of long which makes it look a little funny, too bad because it fits great and is cute!  It is warm though"
3.0,Color was more white then beige.
3.0,Poor traction for walking but keeps our sons foot warm
3.0,It’s a lot smaller than I thought.But my 6 year old loved it.
3.0,"The picture that you are showing is not the Tunic I ordered.  It did not have a scarlet bottom. This Tunic had a straight bottom. It was a little too long for me, but I loved the 3/4 sleeve. I would like to have bought the Tunic that is pictured here."
3.0,arms are very tight .....
3.0,I got this for an ex but just gave them away to someone they loved them I wouldn't do this again it is good
3.0,The bathing suit was just very big. The bottoms looks like a large diaper. I would recommend getting one size smaller. I had to return the bathing suit because it was just too large.
3.0,It's a pretty ring but the ruby is not ruby like color when it's in light! The ruby is more like kinda orange/red like...but I Like-It! O:+)
3.0,"Cute I guess, but I am unable to get the backing on one of them."
3.0,Not a nice fit at all /:
3.0,"Comfortable and breaths well, good for hot days. Crotch is not well shaped, so you can’t spread legs too much without the crotch likely just splitting open at the seams, so for example I wouldn’t be able to ride a bike or anything without tearing them open, running is questionable."
3.0,"The material is ok ,"
3.0,The waistline is sewn crooked.  It is higher on one side.
3.0,Would have been a keeper had this been in Rose Gold.  The Gold Tone is too brassy and takes away from the color scheme.
3.0,Very unusual color ring for me. I like it.
3.0,"I bought this because the picture showed the bead as quite red and gold. When I received it, I saw the red was very muted and the gold almost non-existent. I returned the bead and bought a different one."
3.0,"From the waist down the dress fits beautifully.  The top is another story. The straps are more than 2 inches too long. The bust is sewn crooked and fits really weird.  I am a size D and the top fits rather big. Very pretty dress though. I am going to try to fix it because I am out of time for my wedding. I think it will look fine in pictures. Also, this dress shows ANY fat you have on your back. I  am buying a shrug to minimize that look. If you order the dress buy a size up and order it in time for alterations."
3.0,"ok mask, not great for in-gym usage."
3.0,"The fabric and style of the dress is great but the dress runs small. I wear a size 14 -16 and brought size 1x so I can have the loose feel,  the dress actually fits tight not loose. I will keep it because I like the style of the dress."
3.0,Cheaply made broke in a couple of days
3.0,It would fit perfect if they made the cups bigger to fit a woman's large chest. If your cup size is DD or larger the bathing suit top probably won't fit you right.
3.0,I love all these styles and the Matte finish on them. I just hate that water gets inside making it damn near impossible to use unless you take it off every five minutes to dry out. Good to dress up but unless you don’t wash your hands often you’re going to get annoyed.
3.0,"They’re ok, my daughter like them, however on the first day at school (1) the pineapple key change was damaged, the top part is made of paper or carton and the top rip off where the keychain is connected.  I was able to glue it back.<br /><br />I will not recommend this product"
3.0,It was more form fitting than I expected.
3.0,"Lo malo es que no puedes pasar por agua porq se humedecen adentro , pero si quitan el frío y son cómodas"
3.0,Cute but cap not large enough to fit adult.  Plastic “pipe” is cute.
3.0,Served it's purpose for a Halloween costume but super thing.  Very see through.
3.0,The only drawback is the cups in the top are not attached. The don't stay where they're supposed to. It'll be necessary for me to alter the top to ensure the cups are placed where they belong.
3.0,Very flimsy and a bit big.
3.0,"Too tight at the top for me, but I’m sure they will not be falling down . The elastic needs to be wider to be comfortable. I will keep but may never use. I have athletic legs. They will work better for a thin person but then they may be to loose at the knees. I get sun rashes and was hoping to use for golf under my Skorts.  I thought they would be cooler than leggings. They are a little on the long side. I am a 30” length inseam."
3.0,shrunk after 1 wash
3.0,It's a very cozy robe..BUT...it runs small...
3.0,Would have like it a little bigger buy with same type of strap
3.0,Only had this for one day and the battery was dead. Replaced the battery and it only lasted 3 weeks. Make sure you don't leave it on or let it roll over and turn itself on. Quite costly for what it is.
3.0,"Overall nice hoodie. Fit was good.  But very disappointed there is no drawstring even though it's in the description.  The drawstring comes in handy when it's windy, even though it looks dorky when tied."
3.0,It's beautiful but a little flimsy but for the price it's good.
3.0,"It's a neat item.  For the price, you get what you pay for -- one size fits all (I'm a smallish medium, size 6-8 and it fits well enough), and it's not super well-made, but looks like the picture.  My PRIMARY complaint is that the print on the back *is the same* as the print on the front.  So, while the print falls about right across the front of the body, the skeleton design is awkwardly shifted down across the back of the body.  Nevermind that you have something that resembles the front of a skeleton on your back.  I wish the makers of this suit had just made the back solid black."
3.0,"Very cute leggings.  Does run large.  I still wear them,  just have to keep pulling them up."
3.0,It broke the same day I wear it
3.0,"I really really wanted to love these slippers. The design and quality is high. They are plush and very soft. The fit is terrible, however. I wear a women's 8. I order a womens 9-10.....and they are so small! It fits more like a size 7/8 at best. I'm so disappointed. I really wanted these to fit. I would size up a couple times on these, because they do not fit as expected. They are beautiful but run very small."
3.0,The lining is very thin and feels cheap and the zipper keeps sticking.
3.0,Not a prom dress at all but is a comfortable casual dress
3.0,"Not what I was expecting, I assumed these bands would have a buckle but instead they have a snap closure. The snap closure gives them a cheap and casual look, a buckle would’ve given the more classy look I was looking for."
3.0,"The fit is appropriate in Medium, but my husband is 6&#34;3&#34; and the pants had to be shortened 2 inches. They are on the thin side but can't complain because of the price. We needed tan pants and couldn't find any others in a jersey. Don't think I'd buy them again, however."
3.0,Don't work well in gold weather.
3.0,"This is a cute dress, comfortable, and fit true to size.  However, it was a little too girlish for a short, pudgy, 50 year old woman such as myself.  It looked like I was trying to dress like a schoolgirl.  Someone taller, slimmer and/or younger will probably love this."
3.0,"Flimsy, not best quality. Big for me"
3.0,Not as described at all<br />Would need another top under or you could see right through
3.0,"This is stunning.  I'm 5'3-5'4"" shorter torso with longer legs.  This didn't quite hit the floor with flip flops so good length for me.  Only 3 stars because I wanted one that tied closed, not buttoned all the way down or pulled overhead.  When you pull the drawstring, it gathers  in the front and only closes right there, for about a minute.  After that the gathered part loosens and it ends up pulling away from the tie, so you're left with a tie across your belly button with the gathering on your sides, totally exposing everything you are trying to ""cover up"".  IF it stays tied correctly, it only closes where the drawstring is so when you walk the whole cover up is open all the way up the front except for your belly button and your whole chest down to the belly button.  Basically it's a waste of a tie.  I loved the print so much that I decided to keep it and I added 4 hook & eyes in strategic places so when I walk, the opening up the front only goes to mid thigh and the top hides a little cleavage to be able to wear it into a public place."
3.0,"YRW MEN'S LONG SLEEVE SHIRT is open collar. The Review Shirt is NOT button down style.<br /><br />At first glance the shirt has nice material, bright color and attractive in my observation.  When looking at detail of manufacturing I found quality moderate to poor. The pattern of the wide strips do not match on front, back or at cuff area.  The most distracting to me is the misalignment of pocket on front of shirt.  The Review Shirt has hanging threads throughout, double stitching at many places, short/long stitches in same run plus not straight. I liked the material and Steam iron on cotton setting removed wrinkles.<br /><br />My opinion of use is as cover for Beach or Poolside. Fit of the XX-large shirt seems on small side of that range. I normally wear large or extra large and experience this shirt slightly larger. The product site DOES show a shirt with mis-matched pattern of the pocket on the shirt and shirt arrived as shown… mis-matched.<br />Three ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Star<br /><br />I appreciate your time looking at my Review. It is hoped you found it Valuable, Informative, Useful and HELPFUL. 😃"
3.0,The quality and look of this robe was perfect. But the sizing is way off and I had to return it.
3.0,"I found these pants to run small, but I am tall.  There is very little stretch, if any, and that accounts for some of the fit.  Fortunately, I ordered a L and an XL, and I will be returning the L.  Thank you Amazon for making Returns so easy."
3.0,"The product is really well made but the sizing is a bit off. I bought the 32DD, the band felt more like a 34 and the cups were absolutely massive"
3.0,Good cap but did not realize they shorted the passage by a verse or two.  Guess it can start a conversation...  Hat itself is of good quality.
3.0,Perfect Basic Black Triangle Bikini Top
3.0,"This dream catcher is absoltely beautiful, however the accompanying  chain is terrible.  Mine came kinked in too many places to count, however I was able to unkink all but one link, but still looked unsightly.  It would be better to have been strung on a snake or link style chain.  I've reordered it because the pendant is exactly what I want.  Hope there is better luck.  Just want the manufacture to rethink chain"
3.0,Wasn't exactly what I was expecting.
3.0,"Very cheaply made, the hat had exposed metal framework upon arrival.  Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; scenario."
3.0,"I like the way it looks, but it fits a little weird around my torso, and a little tighter on top. Overall, worth it for the price."
3.0,Arrived stained. Have not try it on. Decided to try to remove stain but wouldn't come out
3.0,Cheaper as expected.
3.0,This dress was cute but runs very very small. Had to return
3.0,It was hard to understand how to pick different colors. I wanted the aqua colored one instead.
3.0,"I recommend ordering a size big.  These definitely run small.  The material is a little thinner than some suits, so it does have a little more stretch, which is good because of the sizing issue. The breast pads move all over the place, so it's probably better just to take them out. They are cute and look good thiugh, and I would order again, but in a larger size."
3.0,Didn’t fit like in the picture but it was cute. Gifted it to a friend
3.0,"The color is misleading in the photo. I thought the blouse was a tan color.  that was my fault for not reading thoroughly.  The description says pink,  it is NOT pink, it is lavender."
3.0,"I am nearly B cup, and this only covers a portion of the front of my breast, leaves a lot uncovered on the sides.  And there is padding, so makes it bulkier than expected.  Bought a similar one in black and no padding, so much lighter.  Fairly comfortable otherwise, but had to make sure it didn't move around too much under clothing, as felt exposed when it did."
3.0,More pajamas/lounge than casual
3.0,I ordered the right US size (sz11) but I not true to sz.  They are smaller.  They fit like a sz 10 than a sz 11. I would like to exchange for next sz up
3.0,"This a pretty good-looking bracelet. It was too large for my wrist but it was pretty easy to untie and take off a couple beads to make it fit. However, be warned: the stain/dye bleeds like crazy. If you sweat any then you'll end up with dots of red on your wrist. If it rains, then it will get everywhere. It doesn't help that it's red and looks like blood..."
3.0,"Cute print, but really icky-feeling fabric. Also sort of see-through."
3.0,"Nice enough shirt, great pattern. I'm normally a Large or XL. 2XL was only option. I can barely button it. Not sure if I'm going to keep it."
3.0,Shirt is exactly like pictured. The smell on the other hand is so strong/bad that Im embarrassed to give it as a Christmas gift.
3.0,Bought a medium and it was a little small
3.0,Cute shirt. Not as long as it looks on model.
3.0,Nice looking but runs small—too clingy.
3.0,"Way too big.  I guess there are women who can wear such a large frame. I am rather small, so it swallowed me up."
3.0,"I am 5'4"" and 160 lbs, usually wear a size 10. I ordered a large, and they are super tight.  Although plenty long,  they pinch around the waist.  Order up.  Otherwise seem fine,  but I haven't washed them yet."
3.0,The XL is tight. narrow
3.0,It's too loose and the slit is very big.
3.0,"1st time I ordered packaging was great but for some reason this 2nd purchase was packed different. all 3 were in a ziplock type bag but for some reason, the color yellow had its own plastic but why though? thought that came to my head was the other 2 were used/returned and just repacked."
3.0,Sunglass is not dark at all... just yellow tone...
3.0,"Way too large, returned"
3.0,i ordered a medium but it was too small
3.0,"The dress came with some minor flaws that I am sure I could have exchanged however the material around the neck was extremely itchy and couldn't be worn. It is super cute, looks great."
3.0,"I loved the mask until I washed it and the color started coming off, so now a lot of the pattern has come off!"
3.0,Super cute but not for a woman 5'6 with curves.  If I was shorter it would have been great.  I like it but my torso was too long and I ordered it twice.
3.0,"4 pair for such a cheep price, look great, but had to buy extender for the chair so it would fit around my ankle"
3.0,The graphics are good. size runs a little small.
3.0,"If you're like me where you need wood or bone gauges due to sensitive ears,  don't get these. They said they're wood but they are not.  Otherwise they're definitely beautiful!!! Makes me sad I can't wear them."
3.0,"i loved them, they just broke after the 3rd wear :("
3.0,Super cheap material.  Would be cute if thet made it out of better material.
3.0,Top was very pretty and comfortable but fit to small
3.0,It has an openback to resize but is still far too big to close down to stay even on my thumb (I wear a ring size 6.5 or 7 on my pointer finger normally). The upside is that it looks very nice as a bracelet on my small statue of a frog doing yoga. He is quite satisfied with my purchase.
3.0,"The top wasn't as pictured, supposed to hang at bottom. But had elastic band at bottom. Also arms are a bit large ordered a medium so I thought it would fit just right, but it's a little big."
3.0,I haven’t worn it yet I am trying to decide if I’m going to keep it or try to give it away I like it in general but it’s snug!
3.0,"I'm disappointed because these are really very nice ear muffs, but they are just a little too big for me. I've tried wearing them several times but they don't fit snugly and slip down when I move my head, which means I'm constantly adjusting them. I am a woman with short hair and the last sized hat I bought was a size 6 3/4, so if you wear a size small and don't have much hair at the neck, you might have trouble with the fit too."
3.0,"I bought these to just wear aroumd the house and to bed in winter (now). They just fit weird. I prefer to sleep in mens pajama pants, they are just more.comfortable but these have an odd fit."
3.0,"twin Niece love them, but cheap looking to me!!"
3.0,"For the purposes of this review I am 5'8"" and a 36B, I typically wear a size small in women's sizes. So when I was offered this BETTE BOUTIK tunic shirt in wine I thought I would try it. Now I should have ordered the size medium as that is what the chart indicated I should order, but I instead got a small because I wanted it to be more fitted than what I saw on the model. That was my mistake (I did take into account other reviews that mentioned problems with fit and went ahead with it) and you don't need to repeat it (also not why I marked it at a 3 star shirt).<br /><br />This shirt *almost* fit me, the body of the shirt does stretch and I'm not large chested, but it did sit awkwardly in my chest area AND the sleeves are terrible. I believe that if the sleeves had just a tad bit more room the shirt would have actually fit me as it would have allowed the chest area fabric to relax. Sleeves are FAR too slim, and I have very small arms. They were so tight that they stretched the boat neckline of the shirt so it didn't fit right and kind of stood up awkwardly. I felt like my arms put on a very tight pair of jeans that didn't quite get up past the thighs if you can relate. The sleeves are what made this a 3 star shirt for me not just because they were so tight but they are made from a fabric that doesn't stretch much at all so it was uncomfortable to wear, and it's kind of like a non-stretch spandex so also not breathable. It's a cute design but the fit is definitely off for me.<br /><br />Positives: If I had ordered a medium I'm still suspect about the sleeves but it would have fit *better*, the sleeves were definitely long enough on the small for me (long arms here). The shirt had no manufacture flaws that I could see and the body fabric was soft and comfortable feeling. So if the shirt does fit you, you will probably like it if you also like the way it fit the model which is more of a boxy/boyfriend style, just make sure you order per the size chart or size up as some have suggested."
3.0,"I bought a 3 pack and they all were different sizes. My fiancé is no small dude and one was too big for him. These masks are huge but do have the elastic toggles to make smaller. Even with the toggles, I can’t wear these masks. I’m super unhappy how much I paid for them."
3.0,"Deswpite two requests, I received no manual or warranty docs.  This is a self winder that needs either a wearer in perpetual motion or you will have to reset the time and date on a near daily basis.  I was about to just wear it because it looked nice, even though it was rarely correct, but I have some inexpensice watches for that.  Too bad, I got lots of likes."
3.0,"Great shirt. Just runs really, really  small. Bummed that it doesn’t fit."
3.0,There is absolutely no way to zip and UNZIP by yourself!! I had to get my neighbor to help me.So sorry. It's very cute but very impracticable!
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for - this was cheap and it shows. It is really transparent and one size does not fit all. But in fairness I do have a large chest. It is a cute design but I gave it to a friend. I should've known better.
3.0,"Bathing suit is cute, quality of suit itself is good but not the mermaid decal. Ended up removing it."
3.0,"They come in great packaging, pretty decent durability for construction work and good visibility for fishing. They lose a star because the rubber inserts fell out when I had to wash them off. I've had them six months, I'm hard on everything and no scratches. The lenses don't fall out,they're not bent yet. I'm a happy customer."
3.0,I love the bear itself. Very cute bit I put it on my keys and the metal link broke that day cheap metal
3.0,"As this dress was extremely low priced, I didn’t expect excessive quality. It was purchased for a person who would normally wear a size 16. I ordered a XXL in anticipation of it running small. I was not disappointed. She could barely move once it was on."
3.0,Super cute and soft but too tight to be comfortable in. Ordered a size 9 and they were too small. I recommend going up a size.
3.0,"very cute keychain, doesn’t light up :-/ not sure if i have to put in batteries myself or adjust the current batteries after pulling the battery tab"
3.0,"These shoes are cute. I got the green ones, which are more of an olive green, that's what I was hoping for. I usually wear a 9 and should of gotten a half size up. Width was good, I have wide feet, however, length wasn't. Toes came to the end of shoe. Recommend ordering up for length, otherwise, they are a fun shoe."
3.0,This is cute but it is huge!
3.0,"The chain is too long yet the pendant is kinda big, if you know how to shorten up the chain and you like big-standing-out pendant, go for thiss"
3.0,Very soft but the rubber on all edges to stay in place irritate the front of my foot
3.0,"This is an okay cap.  I ordered a large and received a ""one size fits all.""  Definitely not the same.  This was a tight fit, so it does not have the same look on me as pictured.  I am keeping it because I need a hat to cover my hair during the quarantine."
3.0,larger than i wanted
3.0,It broke after a week of wearing it but it was really cute before that!
3.0,Very pretty shirt that my hubby loves but the sizing is a little snug. I would recommend you order up 1 size to get the fit you want.
3.0,"These masks are cute but the wires poked through almost instantly. I hoped it was just the first one I was wearing, but nope, the wires poked on all of them. It was easy enough to simply pull the wire out and wear without."
3.0,These earrings were small and not as bright as they were pictured.  They were given as a gift but I haven't heard if she liked them or not.  ?
3.0,The fabric is soft and cheap looking. I don't expect that it will last long. I go to the pool for Aqua Aerobics twice weekly and this swim suit likely won't last through the summer. The padding in the breast area is a bit thin. But the price was cheap and I shouldn't expect anything but a cheap swimsuit.You get what you pay for.
3.0,"This jacket is way too small, I will be returning tomorrow for a much larger size because I do like the style my grandson wears a size 10/12 he is 10 years old"
3.0,"somewhat small,"
3.0,I gave this a 3 star because it's really pretty and I absolutely loved the packaging box however; it's just too long for me and what I needed it for so I had to rerurn it 🙁
3.0,Received these a little bent but still super cute.
3.0,Cute bathing suit. Fit good everywhere except in the chest. I normally wear a B so I wouldn't recommend it for smaller chested women.
3.0,"It's fine, but was disappointed that it was more t-shirt material than like a sweater.  From the photo it looked more sweater like."
3.0,Slightly tarnished
3.0,"I like the length of TVs dress. However, the back Velcro’s instead of zips and the Velcro constantly comes off. Every time I bent down it came undone."
3.0,The bluestone has no glitter
3.0,"See through, not great quality."
3.0,"Unfortunately, the earrings weren't symmetrical. In the picture, the one on the left is perfect/as advertised, but if you notice (at the top of the crescent) the right earing seems a bit off in symmetry. If they were for me, I wouldn't mind, but they are for my daughter."
3.0,"Not so comfortable, a bit scratchy according to my daughter. I couldn't tell from the picture, but there is some odd lettering on the side of the picture, maybe English lettering of Asian words but unclear. Not a big deal but the words look out of place and don't seem to go with the image. Probably wouldn't purchase if I had to do it again."
3.0,Quality was not as good as I expected.
3.0,"I have a small face for an adult and my optician suggested these frames.  They're beautiful, but I felt like I was wearing child sized frames instead of adult ones.  The lenses were way too small and wouldn't have offered enough protection, I don't feel.  I did try changing out the lenses and it was a simple process.  These came with two cases, a soft one which doubles as a cleaning cloth and a hard case which has pockets to store the extra lenses which also came with them.  They also came with an extra set of nose pads.  I would have loved these if only they were more appropriately sized for my face."
3.0,"thin & cheap, if you order, order according to your measurements & 1 size up"
3.0,"As others have mentioned, the one I received does not look red as pictured. It is mostly white with some red streaks. I'm okay with it but beware that stones rarely look exactly as pictured."
3.0,"Previous Casio watches I have owned had a much larger display and a night lite. This unit lacked both of these two features. If I had known this, I would not have made the purchase."
3.0,"For a medium - it was smaller than I expected, though it is slim sized. It's comfy and price was appropriate."
3.0,cute but was sent 2 sizes to large ordered a 6 got a 8
3.0,Pretty. Very light. Smallest set of chains too small.
3.0,They begin to hurt your nose after a while.
3.0,Thought it was sweatshirt material. It is not. Fabric is heavy so it droop’s. Not figure flattering. Heavy weight so warm and will be an “ around the house shirt”. Would not buy again but it’s ok for the price.
3.0,I had no idea shirt was so thin and clings to your skin.
3.0,"They were very soft but way too thin.  Also, although the length was perfect (and I don't often find that to be the case!) they ran much smaller than expected."
3.0,"Very lightweight (which is nice). I didnt like the view, it was too dark without that nice polarized view that I'm used to"
3.0,"I love vero modo and was sad that they stopped shipping to the U.S. when the pandemic started, so I was ecstatic to come across these pants since I have an old pair from when I lived in Denmark. However these pants are very long compared to my old pair, which sucks because if they weren’t so long I would of kept them."
3.0,Snug fit.  Synthetic materials
3.0,This dress looks just like the picture and comes down to my knee caps and is 3/4 length sleeves. I love the pattern and the color is a blue blue and the white is more slightly off-white than a snow white. When I pulled it out of the bag the first thing I noticed was that the outline/cut of the dress resembles the curves of your body. The dress does have some stretch to it. The only thing I didn't like was that the patterned stretched so much at my chest line (i'm a DD/DDD) that the material stretched thin and the pattern distorted.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fabric has stretch<br /><br />Cons:<br />If fabric stretches too much the pattern becomes distorted and thins.
3.0,"It meets my requirements and for the price you can't go wrong. It's not the high quality, but for dog park purposes it works fine."
3.0,Very affordable for so many choices. Giving three stars because I like the cute piercings and it’s worth the money for this much piercings. Only cons is that some of them break off easily but that’s also common with a lot of piercings though. So I think three stars is fair - it’s not the best but not too terrible!
3.0,Nice small piece
3.0,"If your going to order these, order the next size larger, other than that they are very warm, just order larger"
3.0,Not too bad just not long enough
3.0,I thought these were going to be a little sturdier. Also dirt and hair stuck to them so much.
3.0,"My wife did not like it, but it was very nice."
3.0,Doesn't fit very well even on a small ear.
3.0,Disappointed the zipper does not work
3.0,"The shearling on these is beautiful,  and the rubber pads on the soles do prevent slipping,  but  the<br />pointed toes push in on my big toe.  The  soles are thick stiff leather that does not flex at all,<br />and they are flat with no arch support.  They  do make noise to ""clop"" around on the wood floor.<br /> But  again,  they  look  very  high class  and stylish."
3.0,"Looks cute,  fits perfect,  nice material, doesn't look like it's made to last with a playful 8 year old.  But,  she loves it!"
3.0,I like the way this dress fits everywhere but in the bust area. I was surprised since I wear a 34DDD bra. I like the color so much that I decided to keep it and have the side Sean taken in at the bust and add a dart.
3.0,The material is flimsy
3.0,"Dress is really cute. However, not made for any woman with any kind of chest. This didn't come near going to my waist like the picture. I guess I filled out the top a little too much as it made the dress look like an empire waist & too tight, yet the rest of the dress was WAY too big on me through the hips. It is also longer than the length stated in the measurements. If I bought the dress to actually FIT my chest, the rest of it would have hung like a big bag. Returning..."
3.0,"Cute, but dug into the front of my girl’s legs if it was pulled up to cover her top half all the way.  Based on the size, the suit should have been a little big on her but it was almost too small."
3.0,"Looks exactly like the photo, but runs a bit on the large size."
3.0,"Unfortunately I returned this. I ordered a small (I usually wear a size 4) and it was too big. I know these things are supposed to be a little drapey and roomy, but the way it hung wasn't super flattering for me. I think if I were taller I may have been able to pull it off, but I'm 5'5&#34; and it came to the middle of my shin, which combined with the billowy fabric and high neck was not the look I was going for ;)"
3.0,"I loved it but it tarnished too soon, that made me sad, cause I really wanted to wear it for a long time."
3.0,"I love the look of this band; however, the band doesn't stay clasped so my watch fell off and hit the floor……"
3.0,"I bought a pair of Puma Turino FSLs from another shoe retailer last month and figured I'd give them a whirl as my ""summer shoes"". The shoe itself was the right size, but was very tight in the front. So much so that the sides of the shoes bulged a little and I couldn't get them on with winter socks at all. Only anklet/ankle socks. Which was not a problem for me since I bought them for simply wearing while walking around the block or summertime shopping anyway.<br /><br />Rather than go through the hassle of returning them, I figured I'd just stick with them and see how they go. One month on, the shoes seem to have stretched a little and are at least a little more snug than when I bought them.<br /><br />The tight fit aside,  I do love the classic Puma styling of this pair of shoes. The material is high-quality and the soles are extremely comfortable. It feels like walking on air when wearing them around the block! And the ""old-school"" cotton shoestrings on these shoes are the perfect size and will not constantly untie on you or be so long that they dangle below your shoes and cause you to trip like the long nylon shoestrings on so many other pairs of modern-day sneakers do.<br /><br />All being said, my only quip with these shoes is the narrow width....which seems to have become a little less of an issue after breaking them in. Otherwise, these are a fantastic pair of sneakers and have served me well so far!"
3.0,Exact style looking for--just too uncomfortable in toe area.
3.0,I order a size 14 and the tag says 13/14 but definitely not a women’s 13/14. My 12 yrs old daughter fit into them perfectly. They are also not white but a light grey with pink. It does come with thin hip pads which I wasn’t expecting.
3.0,"The product is ok. I was expecting it to be a bit bigger for what I was looking for, but otherwise nice and cute.<br /><br />ON A SIDE NOTE: I tried to return the product as it wasn't the right size I was looking for, and I KID YOU NOT the seller got extremely rude towards me, saying I should've looked at the description (which I did). I'll be honest: I don't know measurements very well, if at all. I saw the description. I ordered it. Got it in the mail but it wasn't the right size I was looking for. Did a return request and the seller basically said they shouldn't have to accept my return because I didn't understand the size. The seller ended up saying it was my fault for not knowing the size. Isn't this how returns are supposed to be? Where if we aren't satisfied with something we request a return, ship it back and get refunded? No, this seller was rude and said I could return it but they don't want me to. So I ended up with either returning it (and having to pay shipping to return it), or only receive a 10% discount. I don't mind losing out on the money, but the seller should've been nicer and not assume/accuse the buyer of not knowing measurements."
3.0,Small for size description
3.0,"very comfortable , lot of comments"
3.0,For the price I am satisfied with this product<br />Thank you!
3.0,"Good looking mask and super light, but it sticks to your nostrils whenever you breathe in. Drives me crazy."
3.0,"The belt looks nice on the Website, but it looks cheap when you have it on.  Personally, I don't think it is worth the money."
3.0,"Beautiful, and made really well. My only complaint is that they run almost 2 to 3 sizes small."
3.0,"It's a spandex material, good quality. I ordered my usual size and it's a bit snug, but over all a good purchase"
3.0,Perfect for what I need. Will order again. First and second time I ordered these I recieved with screw caps as well as the sprayers. The third time however I did not receive them. Not consistent. Bottles are also different than what i ordered the first two times and not what I was wanting. Disappointed in my last purchase.
3.0,These shorts are ok they just run a little small.
3.0,"Look just like the picture, but be warned if you're wearing them as ear piercings that they can be a little uncomfortable due to their thickness (though they go in fine), and the backs are difficult to twist on while they're being worn. Otherwise great earrings.<br /><br />EDIT: After writing this review, I realized that one earring was faulty—the front screws off instead of the back, meaning the earring has to be inserted through the back of the ear (which is inconvenient and annoying)."
3.0,It is OK but definetly not 5 star quality and worth the prize because:<br />1. Leather is thinner than it looks in picture<br />2. Beads are not in flower shape. They are simple tiny beads.<br />3. The way it was tied looks very unprofessional.<br /><br />Sorry! No bracelet from this company anymore.
3.0,Very cute and looks just like picture! My only problem is it does fit a lot smaller especially the bottoms!
3.0,"For the $16 or $17 I spent, this watch works well for the price. It keeps time pretty well and I like the quick-release tab on the band. It also came with a band-adjustment tool to push out link pins as well as a cleaning cloth. Unfortunately, it has some drawbacks. The date (at least on my watch) does NOT roll backwards, so if the date on your watch happens to be a day or two ahead, you have to roll through 30 or so days worth of winding to set it--pretty annoying. The knob is also extremely touchy, so setting an accurate time is delicate work. The links seem a bit wide; if I remove one link, the watch is still too loose, and if I remove two links, it's too tight. A little more size customization would be nice. But again, this is an inexpensive watch. I basically bought it so I'd have something to wear on my wrist with a suit."
3.0,NO AJUSTA LO SUFICIENTE
3.0,They are way to big
3.0,The colors are NOT right and the bottom gems do not unscrew
3.0,great cap but wrinkles easily. I had a hard time trying to iron out the wrinkles. I would not repurchase.
3.0,3 stars because they came quickly and were what I ordered but didn't fit.  My husband is a 2X and these 2x shirts were way too large for him.
3.0,She liked it well but only one side was available.
3.0,"Using the Cottonique sizing chart, the bra fits well.  My usual size is 34DD.  In Cottonique I am 34B.  However, throughout the day the bra rides up under my bust (the band under the bust curls up) so I have to pull it back into position periodically.  The fabric is soft cotton and it does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin at all.  Due to the racer back the shoulder straps are closer to the neck which shows when wearing V-neck and scoop neck knit tops.  I will use it as my weekend bra around the house.  The Cottinique bra liner is the way to go for me.  I can wear my non-hypoallergenic bras over it and it works great."
3.0,Beautiful top.  Somewhat slim around the hips but very pretty.
3.0,"Super cute! Came early too! but sadly not the best option for us girls who are thick in the thighs. They roll down a lot, but honestly i love them otherwise. : )"
3.0,Rather well
3.0,Pretty but gets stuck on everything and snags my clothing.
3.0,"I really like how affordable these hiking pants were. Though they are not the best nor made in the USA they hold up well. I hike about 2-3 times a week and have been very comfortable. What I did not like is that there is not breathable pockets in the pants. I found them to be drenched in sweat after my hikes, plus I thought it could use more pockets overall. What you pay is what you get overall for these pants and I hope they hold up for least a year."
3.0,Dress is beautiful but runs extremely small in the bust area. I am going to have to alter it and put in larger cups so if you don’t sew please be warned it runs small!!
3.0,Not thrilled with this dress. Maybe I'm too tall for it. Tight in chest and uncomfortable. Probably works best on small petite body.
3.0,"If I wanted earrings for a party dress or to go with that ""little black dress"" that I had when I was much younger, the pearl drop earrings that a couple of others also received, rather than the more tailored gold earrings we ordered, would have been welcome. As it is, I don't have any use for them! If I had ordered these and had occasions to wear them, then I'd give them five stars because they are pretty, but I think it's appropriate to review how an order is filled, whether it is appropriately packaged so it doesn't break during shipment, and for sure, whether it is even remotely the same item! Yes, these are earrings, but that's pretty much the only similarity with the earrings I thought I would be receiving. So far, three people got these earrings and I believe two people got the ones pictured. That says that when you order here, it's pretty much up to chance as to what you will get. Not a good sign unless you don't care."
3.0,cute but somewhat too small for the size stated. my daughter only wore it once and seems no more chance to wear it again!
3.0,These happy socks are just the cutest little things ever. I was happy to find some no show socks for little kids. They work great with my daughter's vans. They stay up well too because of the little rubber piece on the back of the heel. I do wish that there was some non slip rubber on the bottom of the socks as well...  but other than that I am happy with these socks.
3.0,"May need to size up on the band a couple sizes- I usually wear a 38, and ordered a 40- still tight even on the loosest setting. Also, not a good summer bra- they are heavyweight and in 90 degree temperature you'll be sweating and uncomfortable quickly. I had to change within an hour. Bra is very supportive and straps stayed in place."
3.0,Shrunk in cold water can't wear now
3.0,Sizing is a bit off.
3.0,Haven't had these very long and multiple eyelets on the left shoe are already coming out.  The top one is completely out.  Not exactly what I would call Indestructible
3.0,Ripped after 1 month of passing league and 2 months of regular season. They worked well when they were not ripped. The gripping was nice and sticky.
3.0,The belt was practically beneath my breasts. Means the pockets were riding up as well. Didn't fit as in the picture. Material is transparent too
3.0,"My boobs are on the smaller end, so I don't need serious engineering in a bra, just a little support and comfort. I didn't need a bra until after nursing, so for the first 30 years of my adult life, I was relatively braless and thus have an especially low tolerance of uncomfortable bras.  Even when I'm wearing a good fitting bra, the odds are high it will be very uncomfortable by the afternoon. Many bras only make it a couple hours on me. This one is comfortable enough to make it to early afternoon before I start complaining, so that's better than average, but not good enough to be an everyday bra for me. But the fit is good, and feels comfortable early in the day, and the bra is very pretty and flattering, but eventually gives me a tightness in the middle of my back.<br /><br />I do really like the matching undies in this set, and both pieces are very flattering. So I'd recommend it for special occasions, or Sexy Grownup Time--or for general wear if you have a lower threshold of bra comfort than I do."
3.0,Little shiny but they will work.
3.0,was a little small
3.0,From the pictures I thought I might get some different charms I hadn't seen before. Well that was the case on a few of the charms but I really didn’t want duplicates of that charm!  I ordered 2 sets hoping one set might prove to be better than the other. I was wrong! I got 19 spoon and fork charms in each set. One set I got 15 different charms out of 100. The other I got 20 different charms. As far as quality they were OK. Some charms were not painted. Unsure if this was intentional or not but the fish look better unpainted in my opinion.
3.0,This darling shirt was to fitted for me. Buying blouses are a crapshoot for me! Many I must return or later give away.
3.0,I liked it.  Not that thick of a weave but will be nice to use over a sweater or under a coat. Feels a touch small but I am 5'7&#34; tall.  I will enjoy wearing it this Winter.
3.0,Doesn't exactly fit like it shows in the picture. Same style but a little different when you put it on
3.0,I really like the bracelet but the attachment point is with cheap metal & broke within minutes of attempting to wear.
3.0,Nice shirt overall.
3.0,"It always fit well, however I have lost 2 stones on it and don't know how to replace them."
3.0,"Faint odor when package was opened, but washing removed the smell. Fit was as expected and comfortable."
3.0,Not the same as the other soft touch comfort piped tanks that come in 3 packs — these are ribbed and not as comfortable — sadly I bought a 3 colors of this twin pack and am only on with them —<br />Especially the cost
3.0,Not for newborn heads.
3.0,"I gave these three stars because the material these are made with is brittle.<br /><br />I really enoyed these readers, however my first pair broke after a month of wearing at the hinges where the screws are.<br /><br />I hve purchased a second pair I hope this pair is more durable."
3.0,It fit fine but it was pretty cheap fabric and it was very sheer.  If it wasn't so sheer I would have kept it.
3.0,Price and fit is good but seams have stitching that constantly poke into the skin. Starts off lightly so you don't notice at first but after several minutes skin is irritated.<br />Other shirts by the same company have the same issue but with fewer seams and linearly less irritation.
3.0,Es muy pequeña le queda en media cabeza de mi hijo
3.0,"I really liked this apron. However, it’s kid sized and a title less bright than I had hoped for. It’s super cute. Better sized for a very petit women or child."
3.0,Not the best bustle but you get what you pay for. Mine keeps folding against me and not staying stuck out so I'll have to do some smart adjustments to get it to act right.
3.0,"I bought the medium size because others said they ran a bit large.  Nope, should have got the large size."
3.0,"The skirt is mediocre, nothing special and I wouldn’t have bought it if I could have tried it on first. The elastic waist band is really small. I’m very thin (size 1 or  24 in jeans) and this skirt manages to make me have a muffin top, so I wouldn’t be able to wear it with crop tops as planned. The yellow is much more mustard colour than shown in pics. I’m 5 foot 4 1/2 inches tall and it’s a great length for me - it hits at the bottom of my ankle bone."
3.0,I bought it for a 12 small child and it said runs 2 sizes small but actually about 3x smaller
3.0,"The dress fits great and works as the wedding guest dress that I bought it for. HOWEVER, in the picture, it's shown as a maxi or at least a dress down to almost ankle length and I'm not sure if it's missing the last row or what happened but it's only three ruffles in length instead of the four shown in the image. I'm a bit disappointed because it's for a late fall wedding and again NOT what I intended to receive but not my size is out of stock and I don't really have the patience or time to order a new one."
3.0,They are cute but way too small and hard to even see them on my ears unless you look really closely.
3.0,"Cheap materials, already coming apart in some places."
3.0,I dislike that the long-sleeved shirt came to big and I didn't knew it came out like that or else I'd have size down I ended up reselling it to someone else.
3.0,Happy with order. Product of good quality.
3.0,"The product is fitted but the material stretches a bit. I ordered the color Mocha and it’s not as bright as the picture above, so I wouldn’t get too excited. It’s long for me, a 5’ 4” woman without heels. It comes just brushing the floor. It’s high waisted which I like. At 172 lbs, it hugs my hips well but I’d like a bit more give. It came as “one size”. Material is thin and matches the price, I suppose."
3.0,the product is see through and there is no underwire. had to return because I can’t wear it out
3.0,"Ever been enjoying some fries at Burger King and think &#34;They're ok. But they could be better if they were like McDonald's fries.&#34;<br /><br />That's this shirt.<br /><br />This shirt would be great if it were just a tad bit bigger and just a little bit better material. I have an awesome similar raglan baseball shirt from Old Navy. This one was cheaper and offered a light grey Old Navy didn't have.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie: I'm chunky. If I were describing myself, I wouldn't say pear shaped. I'd say butternut squash. I'm 5'3,190lbs and I carry all my weight in boobs and abdomen. So it's important that my shirts don't hug up on me. I love the XXL Old Navy one, mostly because it's the perfect workout shirt. It doesn't fly up or anything in Yoga, but it also doesn't hug up on the rolls. This one though: Not only was it super sheer, it was clingy because the material was very thin. It was tight through the arms, but I figured it would be. Overall, it was a BK shirt. I'd rather spend the extra couple of bucks and get a Mcds one."
3.0,I liked the sweater very much it fit my daughter perfect the only part was it came with a weird smell
3.0,It came and seemed way bigger then expected. It didn't fit me. It was way too big.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:1d38b1dda0fb54d4ddcf4c7848febf62]] I ordered up a size, tried it on and wore it around town thinking, “maybe it’s like new shoes wear them a bit they will fit.” Wrong, I am going to wash it then return it. Sorry but, it strangles at the knock. Hood is huge though."
3.0,"The designs of each of these 2 pair of ArtGully Gold spiral earrings are distinctly different, making them a suitable gift, though possibly not a widely versatile one. Additionally, each earring has a protective rubber back to serve the purpose of securing the earring to the ear. Those, I believe, are the positive points.  A disadvantage, however, is that I didn’t find either of these designs simple to attach, meaning that they would not be ones you could plan to put on if you were in a hurry. Also, in the circular design, the part of the wire attaching to the ear is somewhat fragile. Having to repeatedly adjust that curve would eventually affect the integrity of the design. In summary, these earrings are adequate costume jewelry for the right situation."
3.0,I ordered a XL and was sent a 3XL. It’s looks amazing but too big. Don’t wanna deal with the return so just gonna gift it to someone.
3.0,I liked this product much but they are Little too light that the skin is seen.
3.0,"They're just ok.  Kept my hands warm which was the main goal.  The inner lining is not attached to the outer lining except at the cuff, which means if you're not careful the inner lining gets bunched up when you take them on and off.  Also, the gloves are difficult to dry out after they get wet on the inside (when snow falls through).  They do seem waterproof from the few hours that I used them."
3.0,its cute but don't like material for shirt and straps don't actually the..
3.0,Son lindas. El color no concuerda con la foto y quedan un poco largas
3.0,"They work, not as heavy duty as i thought they would be but they work"
3.0,"Not exactly the fit I hoped for. It is very cute and fits great. Quite see through and the neckline is VERY low. I'm 5'6"" ~170lvs athletic build, 40 C bra size... The neckline doesn't allow for a regular bra and a bra is needed unless you're not bashful. This is an at-home dress only for me."
3.0,I ordered a large which usually fit me but the one I got fit a little small.
3.0,They look great but they are just black foam. Very thin and on the small side. But are good to go over a nother mask
3.0,"I ordered three different dresses. Overall, they are okay. The fit is right and the dresses are comfortable and I’ll wear them at home.<br />However, I was disappointed with the fabric itself. I had thought they’d be a cotton jersey knit but instead they are made of a synthetic silky fabric which looks a bit cheap. My fault. I should have read more carefully."
3.0,Kind of what I expect for the price I suppose. This is a classic &#34;you get what pay for&#34;.
3.0,The color is not the same as pictured.
3.0,These are way bigger than I thought they'd be
3.0,"It is a little bit bigger, must be made for babies with wider feet and ankles, my baby is just real petite"
3.0,A little scary in person
3.0,The bands are tiny and the face cover doesn’t allow you to use the buttons on the side
3.0,Size 7/8 girls was huge!!!
3.0,"I liked these socks ok,but they were VERY difficult to get on my feet, no matter which method I tried. I was afraid I was going to scratch my hands with my toenails! They did work as intended overall. i slept in them overnight on a 2 week trip to Ireland and they kept the swelling to a minimium in my feet, legs and ankles."
3.0,exactly like the photo ordered a large for precaution. Normally wear a medium. Suit is a tad large but can still work with it
3.0,"Beautiful! I loved it. However, I had a hole in it within an hour. :(<br />It's extremely delicate and will rip VERY easily."
3.0,I am 5' 7&#34;  and cape is too short in back.  Doesn't cover my backside.  Will give it to shorter friend.<br />Otherwise good quality.
3.0,Great quality! After putting on a pair they are smaller than they should fit. I ordered a lg/xl and almost feel like I got the small/med ones.
3.0,"These are very well constructed shorts.  The fabric is lighterweight than some other brands but ok for shorts.  The size I got was XL and its says in the description that they are 39-42 inch waist....that is way off.  They are more like a 39 inch at the most waist down to 37 if you use the if you use the sinchers on the back.  I normally wear a size 40 in brands like carhart, wranglers, lee, faded glory and compared to those brands these would be like a 38/39 in the waist."
3.0,Too large for my 10 and 8 year old grandchildren. Slick material comfy but slips down easily
3.0,"I bought this as a spring maxi to wear in my 3rd trimester (31 weeks now, 5'5 and around 200#) the fit of the XL was nice, it was super light and comfy, but the neckline + hem length made me feel a bit dowdy sister-wifey if you catch my drift.  Returned as it wasn't the look I was going for."
3.0,"I the Body Shaper didn't come up as far as it looked in the picture. It comfortably came to my waist and my belly hung over.  So I pulled it up higher, then it was riding up a bit, I must be long waisted.  I am keeping it because it was nice but I would have liked it to come up further without feeling too snug in the crotch when I pulled it up to where I wanted it."
3.0,Fit is a little small. But I wanted to lose a few pounds anyways.
3.0,Well you get what you pay for.. it is not bad but won’t put this for any glamorous event..
3.0,Fits great however the arms are like spandex not happy with that.
3.0,"They're cheap, not much more to say.  They'll do the job.  About the same as you'd expect to find in a dollar store, probably cheaper there.  Giving it three stars because it's to be expected at the cost.  No surprise -- either way."
3.0,The product had a hole in seam on right side of leg. Fits ok otherwise
3.0,It works ok don't use it much..
3.0,Soooo i mean its cute but id totally flash someone if i wore it out . I removed the pads too . For reference im a 36ddd . It fit kinda but if i moved nip slip lol 😂 i guess cute for pics
3.0,True to size. Dont lobe the fit but its waerable.
3.0,very comfortable and soft but it doesn't fit as loosely as I'd like
3.0,"I usually wear a 34DD and I ordered this in a 34DD. The fit is fantastic- just as well fitting as my favorite Chantelle bra. It provides great support which is one of the hardest things for me to find and breathes well. I also love that it's pretty and sexy. The adjustable straps are a feature I always look for, both because I usually need to shorten the straps to begin with and because it gives a longer life to my bras as the elastic stretches in the straps. My biggest complaint with this bra is that over the course of the day it becomes uncomfortable. My Chantelle bra I forget to take off- this one gives me a red line where the band sits if I wear it for more than half a day. I think part of the problem is the place at the bottom of the bra. If they could fix this issue this would be an amazing bra. But considering the price it's definitely one to try."
3.0,I don’t like how they fit. They don’t stay up and really sag in the crotch. The color is muted. Didn’t realize they weren’t full length. Wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,This dress has the weirdest fit I've ever seen.
3.0,Smaller then they look but really adorable and my 4 year old loves them
3.0,"The dress is nice but the material is very thin in the skirt part you can see right through it. You will have to wear something under it. overall the dress is not to bad, I only wish it was lined."
3.0,It was really cute but I couldn't even get the sleeve all the way up my arm.  Definitely runs very small.
3.0,"I love the feel of satin boxers, but these tended to shrink rather severely and dont wash well, little snags and shrinkage have occured within the first wash although the fit prior to washing was great. I would reccomend that if you purchase this item that you purchase at least 1 size larger than you normally wear"
3.0,Now that the world is almost back to normal this product was a waste of a waste of my money I didn't even use it then I can't return it it's it's in my house as a prop when I did wear it it fold up so bad that you couldn't see so you had to remove it anyway but they got a lot of colors in the colors are cute but I wish I would have never bought it
3.0,"Too small for a guy, or at least me"
3.0,Comfortable shoes for sure. I bought 3 pair because it’s hard to find shoes that fit my stupid feet.<br />I bought all 3 pair June 23 and I rotate each pair every time I play golf. It is now July 13 and one shoe is already separating. Just not cool. I thought montrail cared more about its quality but I guess not.<br />I’ll glue these and make do but probably will go for Salomon next time for trail running shoes.
3.0,"Def gives camel toe because of the placement of the seam between the legs. The pants just aren’t very flattering, they are high waisted but they’re not a strong material. There’s too much give for them to hold your tummy in. They do have pockets and hold up while running, but you will have to pull them down every so often"
3.0,"This swimsuit is adorable, seems well made and the best part is that it's lined. BUT, if you are anything above a C cup, do not buy this suit. I am a 34DD or 36D and holy side boob. It looks like they're trying to escape out the side of this suit. This would be adorable if the cups were a tad larger. I do crochet (barely) so I'm going to try and figure out a way to modify it. If you're above a C cup and just want to lounge by the pool (or in the pool) this may be ok. But if you're actually doing things, I'm afraid I'm going to flash people."
3.0,I like the material but the chest area is tight compared to a standard medium sized dress.
3.0,"Soft and have a more substantial sole than other Snoozies. However, these run very small. I ALWAYS wear a 7.5 and the medium (shoe sizes 7-8) was too tight. I don't care for the decorative fur thing - it is easy to remove, in case you want a more simplistic look."
3.0,I got it for my 4 month old baby and the outfit looks like it could be 3t.... super cute just wish they had made the size clear
3.0,Beautiful but way too slender. Couldn’t even put them on my little one
3.0,I ordered a XL but wear a LG and it still fit snug. the reflective strip feels tight around the chest. I'm glad I only paid 10 bucks
3.0,"These are only okay.  The pattern is pretty, but like other reviews stated, they wear more like pajamas than palazzo pants.  I think this has something to do with the material.  I love palazzo pants and all of my othersl move/flow very nicely at the bottom (ankle area), but these do not flow like palazzos.  I would wear them around the house but will likely never wear them out.  I kept them because they are comfortable and still cute - for house pants! :)"
3.0,for the price its ok..i have seen better products but if you dont mind the fact that its kind of cloudly you are ok..hopefully no one will get that close to your ears to notice the fakeness
3.0,Was looking for a gold band.  This has a pink tinge more like rose gold.
3.0,"Ugh, what an ugly shoe!!! But this seems to be the current style, so I thought I'd try it. Fit was good enough and as expected. The arch support is never high enough for me, but I know my arches are high.<br /><br />Quality is on the lower end, but it is a lower cost shoe. I have decided I don't like this sock like shoe style. Cheeper to make? Yeah, but it does nothing for fit and comfort. Still had to cut gussets in just to get the durn things over my heels and into them. It's amazing that engineers who should know physics can't understand that a 10.5 foot will have an ankle to match AND that ankle combined with the heel needs to be able to fit through the top of the shoe. I don't care if straps of steel are put on the front and back, you can NOT fit ten-eleven inches through a seven inch hole.<br /><br />Wearability: For moderate work this shoe could be all one needs. For someone who does six plus miles per shift I wouldn't recommend it. I can get away with it for now while I save up for a better pair of shoes, but these puppies will go away in less than a month because they hurt too much. Not enough arch support, the toe box is a bit cramped and the memory foam flattens five hours into a shift. The only good thing is this has put me over the edge about taking a gamble on cheap work shoes. Won't do it again."
3.0,These shoes are adorable. Super cute for my little princess in her first pair of high heels so she can be like mommy. We were disappointed because they are very small. We actually ordered a size up because others reviewed them as a small fit but I wish we had gone up 2 sizes so she could wear them longer. They are already too small after just a few months. I would definitely buy again but at least a couple sizes up
3.0,"When they say that XXL is the same as US sizes 10 to 12, believe them! This was way, way too small for me. And I got the XXL. I wear about a size 18 or 1X and this was not even remotely close to my size. It is to bed though because this really was a very nice shirt and I would love to have it if it only fit me. If you are a size 12 or smaller I highly recommend this shirt.  It was nice material, stylish, and expensive looking."
3.0,"The charm is beautiful, unfortunately on a bracelet is gets caught on everything and the clasp is too weak to hold.  Would be much better for a necklace."
3.0,"Tight so I returned it. Had to pay to mail it back. Never got my refund. I had to keep watching forever but when I reached out to Amazon, I heard from someone with a company and they processed my return quickly after that. Not exactly worth the hassle."
3.0,I chose this bag as a work/ school bag. I love the style and the pockets but I was displeased with the fact that the leather was scratched and had marks on it upon delivery. For the cost of this bag I expected it you be in better shape. There was no return label or shipping information inside the package to request a new one. I wish I knew that the bag had scuffs and scratches in the leather prior to ordering. If it didnt have any cosmetic defects I would love this bag.
3.0,Es para algunos en muy delgado
3.0,I am only 4 foot 11 and it took a lot of stretching of these hose to get them on. And because of that they are not going to be very comfortable
3.0,We received the back pack yesterday and when we opened it up it was wet inside. For some odd reason or another. And it stunk like mildew. Other than that it’s a great bag.
3.0,Pockets make your hips look extremely large
3.0,"This fit me so great and we’re comfortable but oh lord I have a hard time finding a good pair of yoga shorts or pants that don’t give me a camel toe! Ladies if you’ve got a bit of a pooch down there, there’s a good chance you’ll see a camel toe. For me it was vague but I could notice it and I just know I’ll avoid wearing them. But the shorts fit well even on my biggish thighs. I’m 173lbs and 5’6”"
3.0,Its Comey. My daughter wears it for dance class
3.0,Would be cute if it was smaller
3.0,"It fit as expected and the color is nice, just as pictured. I really wish it wasn't as thin. Wearing an undershirt doesn't look that great under it. It's just going to be an around the house and bedtime shirt/dress for me."
3.0,I should have read the reviews.  Paw prints are sooo small that you can't even see what they are.  :(  Disappointed.
3.0,"They're bigger and gaudier than I anticipated. Also, the stems bend easily and there is not as much actual flower detail as I thought there would be. When in your ears, they just sort of look like large somewhat-shiny/somewhat-sparkly blobs of shape - not obviously cute flowers like I thought they were."
3.0,"I was looking for a large ring to replace one I had recently lost.  I bought several from Amazon, including this one.  The design is much smaller than I expected.  Lesson learned:  see jewelry in person before buying."
3.0,"The timepiece is attractive and easy to tell the time.  Also,I thought the whole watch is too bulky and the day feature is extremely small and nearly impossible to read.  I am not satisfied with the watch and plan on returning it."
3.0,More orange than it looks.
3.0,I love this style of dress and as a result i have purchased it in different colors (not all at the same time)<br />The first ones were a length similar to the photo's shown (above the knee) and i think this is a very flattering length on most women... however the latest dresses i got have been way longer!!! To make it worse the length now is a dowdy length hitting just below the knee which is very unflattering with this style!!!
3.0,"I bought an extra large as I'm typically a large or extra large in most shirts. This one is clearly designed to be a bit baggy but the extra large was huge. It's a nice, comfy shirt and will be perfect for a day out running errands, a trip to the movies, or just hanging out at home. No real complaints about it!"
3.0,I bought another polo from Burberry through farfetched .. This one was not like that one .. I kinda think this one was a knock off. It will do though...
3.0,Screw came undone within the first 2 weeks of wear and the lens popped out...
3.0,"They’re ok for the price. Originally I ordered a size up after reading some reviews. They were too big, so ordered my normal size and they’re a little small. I’m afraid they’ll slip out easily."
3.0,It's too small than I expected
3.0,"After an initial incident with my order (that was never resolved,) I reordered this product for a trip back in October.  While I loved the clutch, it barely made it 4 months before the zipper stopped staying closed.  While this is not a super pricey clutch, I would expect that it last longer than this.  It's too bad.  I have another one in a different color & am disappointed to know that it won't last long either."
3.0,"The item was not exactly what I was expecting, but it arrived promptly"
3.0,Perfect size and color was great but didn't even get half my cards in the and the snap wouldn't stay closed. Had to return it!
3.0,"Thinner than I expected, very nice looking, but does not hold it's shape very well at all. WIll be nice for traveling occasionally, but not for everyday use."
3.0,"Not the best quality, but good enough for the price."
3.0,Love the details and quality.. But it did not fit. way too small.....sad<br />Medium is not 8=10 as chart said
3.0,"The watch itself is cute. However, it was missing two rhinestones when I received it. My only complaint is it is not adjustable at all, and it's big on me. But, you get what you pay for. For the price, it's cute and does the job."
3.0,"Make sure you order 2 sizes larger, especially if you are larger than the normal person."
3.0,"This is a nice cotton gown, but it does not give, feels and sounds like flexible paper"
3.0,They where to big for me
3.0,Doesn't seem to be leather.  Can hold a few credit cards besides ID
3.0,These are good except they are slightly see thru and the mess on the side of 1 pair is all pulled already and have only worn a couple of times.
3.0,The inside fabric is super soft on my feet. And the memory foam does feel good but the padding is not that thick which gives me concern that it may wear out. The shoes are stiff around the ankles so the shoe doesn't feel so good.  It's a function slipper but it doesn't give me the extra support that I was looking for around the house. It does keep my feet warm.
3.0,For the price it's ok.  The edges are a bit sharp and need to be polished.
3.0,Great quality belt my husband loves it
3.0,Bought this for my son's beach wedding. The dress is beautiful and I did get alot of compliments.  However I would NOT recommend for beach.  Very comfortable
3.0,way too thick. looks cheesy and cheap as a jewelry piece. these start to look like a beaded necklace rather than ball chain. well at least now i know. this is probably more useful and stylish as a utility chain rather than a jewelry piece. i would much rather go with the smaller ball chains to wear.
3.0,The color is much more green than shown. A little disappointed..
3.0,Asian female: bigger than needed. Needs to be ironed or steamed before use which is annoying. Suppose to be hand wash only.
3.0,"The original mask l received as a gift looked similar to this one and fit like a glove. Unable to find the vendor of the original masked I purchased this one, only to find the it's slightly smaller. I ended up giving it away to someone with smaller features and they love it."
3.0,"The Bottoms fit great, but the top is a whole different story.  I will just have to invest in buying another top and mix and match.  The top does not support women of larger breast size. I am a 34DD and there was no way I could have went swimming with this top."
3.0,The dress looks great and I love how they feel.  I bought two of these dresses in separate sizes for my flower girls.  A size 8 and a size 12.  My only problem with the dresses is that they were too big.  The size 12 was only slightly off in size.  The size 8 was way off and I will have to try and get it taken in so that my daughter can wear it for the wedding.
3.0,A bit big for my 9-month old
3.0,This band is fun but the pin keeps coming undone from the watch.
3.0,Pretty and cute but way too small.
3.0,These are great and I like the different  styles in one order.
3.0,This product is absolutely junk.
3.0,This is a really tough one too rate. The costume itself was fine but the sizing was just way too small.
3.0,The only issue with this product is it slides when on the face.
3.0,We got a size 8/10 for my 8 year old and the gloves are huge on her!!
3.0,"These ran large. They also look pretty cheap. They were fine for my 5 year old’s ballet class, but more serious dancers might not be satisfied."
3.0,"I fell in LOVE with this swim suit... and I thought the white sides would have a slimming effect (I'm 5'4&#34; and 200 lbs).... Well, FYI, it can't hide the bulging tummy... It enhances it. --- I don't know why since it appears there would be an &#34;optical illusion&#34; to it... But the quality was great and I think if you don't have a large protruding stomach it would be flattering on any body style.  But it does not help &#34;slim&#34; the tummy as some styles do.  And in all fairness, it never claims to... It was just MY perception that it would. :)"
3.0,Good quality and easy to put on. Only drawback is the waist is too tight even when expanded as much as possible. The max waist length is not proportional to the max shoulder length. Im a slim guy but it's annoying how tight it is around my waist.
3.0,"The ring is close to what you would expect. When first opening the bag I noticed how shiny it was, obviously it’s the steel it’s made out of and over time it will start dialing it back a bit. It fits as expected and really the only issue i have with it is how light it is in comparison to other rings of this nature and the images are very hard to read on the ring, just not a great “stamp” I guess you could say.<br /><br />Over all, for the price of the ring, I’m not upset with it and will wear it.<br /><br />Edit* after a few months the ring now turns my finger green."
3.0,"my foot feels warm but then it gets wet, how? I have not the slightest"
3.0,Fabric is thin and neckline is loose
3.0,Too big on me so I returned it!
3.0,"I thought they were going to be more reddish orange than orange. Also the triangle part at top does not sit straight, it bends inward."
3.0,This sweatshirt is made out of very cheep material and it came smaller then I thought. I got a medium because I usually get a small and I wanted it oversized but it fit like a small instead. It’s very cute but already has lots of pills and such stuck to it. I’m not sure it was quite worth $25
3.0,lovely dress but it was really tight for me.
3.0,The color is more pink than red. Would not buy again.
3.0,Size did not match product description.  However the colors were vibrant and washed very well.
3.0,"Adorable print and very soft, but I was surprised that the belt was not attached. For a newly-turned three-year-old, this seems like both a recipe for it to be quickly lost and a strangulation hazard. In fact, the first thing she did was wrap the belt around her neck and say it was a scarf. I will sew it on myself, but I wish this was already done as with other kids’ robes I have purchased."
3.0,"So the butterfly earrings are complete crap.  They are cheap, soft metal, and I'd be concerned to ever wear them, because I'm afraid they might give me a rash.  Or worse.<br />The simple cuff and chain set is stainless steel, and the earring itself is solid.  That thing isn't gonna fall out.  I tossed the first pair."
3.0,"Reasonably good quality, comfirtable fabric. DO NOT SIZE UP. I have a 34 inch waist and sized up to XXL (usually wear L-XL depending on fit) and it was MASSIVELY too big. Completely unwearable."
3.0,fit was a little tight
3.0,The length is way too long!
3.0,Nice and attractive set.  First time we used it the zipper broke.  Now have to spend money to go have it repaired.
3.0,"I wish I could give this show a 3.5 because I am on the fence about these shoes.<br />First, the shoe is narrowly cut. I have slightly wider feet but I usually wear a size 8. I should have purchased a size 9. I like the overall style. The shoe is easy to slip on and the straps on top of the foot are a good width. They lay nice and flat so they do not cut into your foot. The center part is a little big so it really spreads your toes apart. The inside part of the sandal is a comfortable material. This shoe holds true to the name flip flop because you can hear the flips and the flops when you walk. I have to really walk lightly or work hard to keep the shoes from banging too loudly when I walk.<br />Overall, these are a nice pair of sandals for quick trips from the house, some place where you will not be moving too much, or to wear to the pool or beach. I would probably not wear them all day or when I have a lot of walking to do.<br />In compliance with Amazon policy, I would like to disclose that I received this product at a discounted price with the acknowledgment that I would leave an honest review. The review above is my unbiased opinion after testing the product myself. I hope you found the information helpful!"
3.0,Very beautiful! Smaller than advertised. I have a small wrist but this is more child size. So I was disappointed.
3.0,Had to return because it is way too tight and shows every single flaw.
3.0,They looked exactly as they appear in the photo and is a nice quality.but the back is a screwback and is at the end of the stem.so the back does not touch my earlobe and therefore the earring is loose and keeps falling forward.spoils the whole effect of the beauty of them and is also annoying.I had to get backs for them.I am slightly disappointed.
3.0,I like its style but too hard to hold and had my daith earring cut. Yikes
3.0,"These jeans fit nice. They are a little on the small side, but still fit and look good. I ordered a 27 and probably should have gotten a 28. I'm 5'7"" 140 lbs and the length is great. The thread used to stitch is very rough on the skin. Almost like it is plastic, but I know it isnt. I would not buy these again at the $60 price tag, but I have them and will not return because the do look nice. My advise is buy BKE or Silver brand jeans. Much better for the cost."
3.0,Trails behind instead of wrapping around could have made it fuller.
3.0,I love the style and it runs a tag large but the material doesn't hold up. It has faded some. Love the length though. If you or anyone in your family has long hair it sticks to this material.
3.0,"Holds all the cards I need, but is not very convenient to pull out cards as you need them. But it is small and compact. Better than carrying a wallet."
3.0,"The bead strands are just what I was expecting—<br />simple seed beads on a strand. The problem is that the elastic strap that slips onto the glasses is impossible to tighten. This means my glasses are constantly sliding off the bead strand. I wouldn’t  buy these again as they don’t work for holding my glasses, which was the reason I ordered them in the first place."
3.0,To big for my children. Bought for a 2 year old and a 6 year old. They actually fit as a tight shirt on my soon to be 2 year old. Bought because children are supposed to wear masks at 2 while on flights and still too big for 6 year old.
3.0,"This is a mostly positive review. Loved the fit of the dress it was very flattering and feel like it would work for any body type. Arms weren't tight at all either which was great. I'm 5'6 and the length was perfect on me, I wore it was flats. Only negative I have is that after 1 wash the bottom of the dress already looks super faded and kind of cheap looking. Very bummed about that. I got the black and rose flower dress for reference. So if you need a cute dress for a special but casual occasion...this is a great option but if you're getting it with the expectation that you can wear it and have it for a few years...this is not a great option. You get what you pay for and this is definitely fast fashion."
3.0,It is not comfortable and has no cushioning at all. It is like having cardboard for shoes.
3.0,"This dress is cute but I would size down! I thought a Medium would be fine since I’m normally a M/L but I could probably fit a Small! The color is also red, not burgundy."
3.0,"Turns skin green in about 15 minutes, cute design though. Will have my jeweler make one for me. I do have very sensitive skin, so if you are able to wear costum jewelry, it should be great."
3.0,I got the owl socks.  They are very cute but they shrunk after I washed them
3.0,"The design and the material is good. I ordered the small size, however the shirt is somewhat large for me. I always wear small size since, I am 5 ft and 115 lbs. I wore it in skinny jeans and looks baggy but okay. Next time, I make sure I order extra small. Hopefully that will work for me."
3.0,Not reaaly what i was looking for..this is kind of a empire waist with ruffle bottom. Lobe the floral pattern just not the cut for me and my body type. Will return. Because if the material it hangs heavy.
3.0,"5'5  130lbs I ordered small and the length is really small, it sits on the belt arena, a medium would not work because the chest and sleeves wouldn't fit then. Im assuming this is for kids, this would be good for kids. Material is good and collar is firm and nice. if only it was 1 1/2 inches longer for the length, it would be good"
3.0,would not recommend to a friend
3.0,"The XXL fits as if it's two sizes smaller. It's a very nice looking and feeling shirt. It's quite thin, though, so be prepared to wear a tank top under it. I gave it three stars because the fit is way too tight. But it's also a very attractive shirt."
3.0,Im new to this whole compression thing.  I ordered these because i liked the print and looked like normal sock.  The socks are super cute super soft an super Tight!  I’m 5’7 wear a size 7 and have 13” calves.....BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE PATTERN IS SEWN INTO THE SOCK CAUSING PRESSURE INDENAtions
3.0,"We live in a cold climate. The coat is great for activities like sledding. The coat was not good for ice fishing. The thickness of the coat is lacking and didn't keep my son warm. This was with many layers underneath.  The quality of the cost seems good, but time will tell."
3.0,I liked the fit of the cup but found the band to be smaller than advertised. The patterned material near the top of the cup shows through shirts so I returned it.
3.0,I wish it came with some bloomers. Came a tad smaller then I thought.
3.0,Long and pretty
3.0,"They are nice, but they are enormous."
3.0,I over this  dress 👗 and couldn't wait to put it on... sadly it was too tight on me... I usually wear a size M so I got a M... should of gone up a size... still very pretty dress and material is not see thru.
3.0,"These are absolutely adorable. I love how cute they are, but not impressed with how cheap the chain looks. I would reccomend getting a different chain. All in all, they are worth the couple bucks..."
3.0,Bled through. Too expensive.
3.0,"Just as pictured on line, very cool. However they came a bit scratched but people won't notice when I wear them."
3.0,very small  earrings it's best for kids
3.0,Was not as long as expected
3.0,"Stretch blazer in bold fuschia color, just as it appears in photo. Shoulders and arms are a bit on the slim side. I wear a 6, I ordered a 6. Can't wear anything but a camisole under this as it is slim. Bummed the sleeves are so short. Hits above wrists for sure. Going to see if seamstress can lengthen, otherwise I will have to return as I look like I'm wearing a petite sized blazer (I'm 5'8""...not petite)"
3.0,Has an orange color from the weathering process that sticks out way too much. Looks like you accidentally poured bleach all over it.
3.0,This shirt was super cute so I was extremely disappointed to find that it was too small. I even ordered a size up from my usual size because I wanted it loose fitting. Unfortunately the shirt clung to me in all the wrong places. It does not fit anything like the picture shows it fitting. I ended up returning the shirt.
3.0,If you can make my package holder lager a bit you might be a thong millionare.<br />I took and rinsed and stretched them and 1/2 fit now. I like them but no package room for me even soft!
3.0,"Okay, so the dress is absolutely beautiful (I purchased the green one). The stitching looks lovely and the colors are perfect for the fall season. That being said, it is too small which is hugely disappointing. I am 5'6&#34; and weight about 200 lbs and I typically wear an XL, so I went with the 3x just to be on the safe side. Unfortunately, the top of the sleeves and the chest area were still tight despite going up 2 sizes. The rest of the dress fits great. I'm going to keep it in hopes that I will fit in it soon or that I may be able to take it out slightly in those two areas. They did have very fast shipping, and it is a good product - just be careful if you are big chested or have thicker arms!"
3.0,The purse is cute and compact. I wish i'd purchased a larger size because I carry a lot of items in my purse
3.0,Great Fit. Nice Color. Kinda thick material. Def wont be wearing much during the summer.
3.0,The top was a little bit small but overall cute set
3.0,This sweatshirt is very thin. Not what I was looking for. Do like the color.
3.0,"It exposes too much cleavage and because the back is low, you can't wear an undershirt without looking weird"
3.0,I like this shirt as it's really comfy fabric and fits exactly as size chart says. However after the 3rd wash the design begins to peel off....for that reason i wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,Usual down sizing on the tag.  Go up one for a more comfortable fit.  Small pouch up front.  Love the nearly naked minimalism. Colors are great.
3.0,Nice look but cleats were small compared to other shoes my son has on the same size.
3.0,Recieved with a tear on the side of one of the slippers.
3.0,"Pros:<br />1. Perfect fit in accordance with the size chart<br />2. Good glove traction<br />3. Warm for running at temperatures as low as 15 degrees F<br />4. Good finger tip sensitivity for touch screen devices<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. (Big one) Sticking at the base started to unravel after about a month of regular wear strictly during running (see picture). Low durability is regrettable.<br />2. Zipper on gloves catches frequently and is a bit of a pain, especially for zipping with non-dominant hand."
3.0,They look pretty awesome but their too wide and do not hold at all.
3.0,"I looked forward to getting this night gown. I love real silk, and I am willing to invest in it. It keeps you warm or cool, as needed, and feels good. Mulberry silk is thicker which is great for a night gown. I picked the neutral beige color, which was actually uneven brown instead. While I am normally a Medium or even Small, I wanted something more roomy. It is quite big, but not in a nice loose way, just bulky. The fabric is probably silk, but it feels rougher than normal, some left over fibers, I wonder.<br /><br />The description says it is handmade. Well, it is not about it, ultimately all of the garments are made by someone’s hands to some degree, with a help of a machine. The point is they are constructed to fit well and hopefully flatter the body, and they are well cut considering the thread direction in the fabric, and the stitching is good, so they last. While silk fibers are long and elastic, this fabric feels like they are made of coarser shorter threads. This one is not flattering.<br /><br />I will try to work with it, steam, fix a couple of shape issues in a hope to get a decent nightgown. I do not mind trying a few alterations, but I generally expect the piece to look as advertised.<br /><br />Do not recommend, nowhere close to the expectation."
3.0,Didn't stay blown up well! Design was great for our monster truck loving son!
3.0,The dress is cute but not on me. It was too small on the top then too big below my chest.
3.0,"Got the dress last night. When I tried it on for the 2nd time to show my husband, the zipper split open.  Disappointed because the dress is adorable and I needed it for an event this Saturday and there doesn't seem to be a way to contact seller."
3.0,Odd feeling material. I'll pass. Used once removed quickly. Donated.
3.0,Love the dresses fits comfortably true to size fast shipping
3.0,"They're very pretty, but honestly it's SO HARD to get the earring to close and be secure. After 30 minute of trying, it's just in my cartilage unclasped. Good thing it came with 2 in case this one falls out!"
3.0,"I am 5'9"" so I am use to maxi dresses not being long enough for me. The dress is nice but not ideal for hot weather, polyester to the 10th power."
3.0,"This swimsuit is beautiful and fits great. The only complaint is the band on the bottom of the tank is very stiff. I couldn't get it over my head without hearing ripping in the lining. Once I got it on, I ended up pulling the lining to losen it up a little. The bottom of the tank needs to be reinforced with an elastic band."
3.0,"I ordered it on October 6 didn't get it till November 9th. Feels real cheap, very thin material. Cute design though."
3.0,"The lamp itself gets five stars, but the &#34;belt&#34; is a flimsy piece of crap that doesn't stay snug. I had to secure the belt at the proper length with a piece of duct tape-- otherwise, it would've worked it's way lose and fallen off."
3.0,Bottoms seem sized smaller.
3.0,"Not bad, but had to remove the very uncomfortable nose piece and snap off the post it sits on.  The nose piece sat very low on the nose, which caused the glasses to stick out away from my face.  They aren't very comfortable."
3.0,"material is cute ,fits as expected.Downside is the stitching is not so good.. The stitch has started falling apart"
3.0,"I’ve had these for about two months and I have already worn holes in all of them. They’re adorable, but not the greatest quality."
3.0,MOST of the earrings worked but not all. some wouldn't even open without breaking... just glad i was able to use 2 pair effectively
3.0,"I ended up giving this to my niece.  I got the XXL size and I'm 5'2 and so the length was good.  My best friend buys this dress a lot, and demanded I give it a try.  I struggled with it.  It wasn't as comfortable as she said it would be, and one side looked so much better in it than the other.  My niece loves it and so she has it now.  i'm glad I didn't have to goodwill it."
3.0,Daughter loved them but flowers fall off
3.0,"The suit is OK, but it is no way to put the top on (specially if you have a bad shoulder) it’s no fasten to use, with so many straps it mission impossible to get it on.  I’ll return it."
3.0,"I love 90 degrees products BUT! When they're dark they look great, with light colors unfortunately you can see everything. Every little imperfection you're trying to hide - it's there in your face, not to mention the shape and color of your underwear. So unless I order 1 or 2 sizes up, to avoid stretch, light colors are not for me. I'm 5'4&#34; and wear size 12. Dark ones fit and look awesome though."
3.0,Had a hard time getting the lenses to snap in and now there is an indentation around my frame from trying to snap them all the way in.  Still couldn't get them snug leaving a gap between the lense and the frame.
3.0,Loved it but it broke within 2 week :(
3.0,I ordered the size I would normally wear but it was too large. Also the material is not very thick so with the pink you will have to wear something under it. I returned this piece & looked for something different.
3.0,"I wish I listened to the other reviews.  This bracelet is exactly how it appears but the fit is awkward on my wrist.  It doesn't fare well being loose so I have to roll it up a little on my wrist to make it look right.  I felt like I was constantly fixing it.  Maybe after a few wears, the material will relax and take shape.  I will update if that happens."
3.0,They charged me twice and wouldn't give me a refund. And its great the sizes are a little smaller then expected too.
3.0,"I can fit a size 34-36 small dress shirt very well in the chest but this shirt fits a lot tighter than the dress shirts in the chest. I chose the upper end of that (small 36) The shirt is slim fit so it is expected to not be &#34;boxy&#34; but the chest was still slightly small. If and when I order again, I'll have to choose the size 38 option.<br /><br />As others pointed out, there is a few small strands of thread that hang loose on in the button area."
3.0,"These do look much prettier in photos than in person. However, they do look cute. I needed something simple and inexpensive for work, so i'm pleased with them in that regard."
3.0,"If you like to have your socks and underwear in a particular place in your luggage, these packing cubes will do the job.  The zippers are good and the mesh allows you to see what's in the cubes.  I found the cubes took up more space in my luggage than if I merely placed the items in the luggage.  I guess I'm just not that neat or organized."
3.0,When I use them in my tanning bed it it’ll bright red almost a pink hue. If I close my eyes it’s beyter.
3.0,Logo was too pronounced and the fit was too tight.
3.0,Have to return. Had a hold on the side of the top.
3.0,Cute dress but size up. Typically wear a M and it was way too short and much tighter than expected.
3.0,Dress fits great but not a fan of the shoulders. Might return.
3.0,I live the size of it. The price is cheap and I love the color of it. But the only thing I don't like is that it's hand is too light like grayish and the numbers are black too  that I can't see what time it is.
3.0,"I like wear crew necks because they are usually thick and soft on the inside and I expected this one to be that was as well. I really like the marble like pattern and the style of the shirt but it is very thin. The other issue I had with it is that the material felt very stiff and it was not very soft on the inside, more rough than anything. I may need to wear another shirt underneath it, I just wish the material was better and it would be a nice crew neck sweatshirt."
3.0,"These are ok, there aren't great and not even good. I should ha e waited till later in the year to order these. Of the 3 pair of lenses 2 lenses of each 2 different colors have pretty significant distortion in them. Sadly I didn't need to wear them until after the return window closed."
3.0,"While it is a huge improvement from the original band, it is a pain to try and get off. I read a previous review that said the guy planned to switch between this and another but once he put it on decided to just leave it. My opinion is he decided to leave it on because its nearly impossible to get back off. The tabs to pull off are also steel, and it just feels like they do not move when attempting to remove. While this is a fitness watch, its not very feasible to have a steel linked band when working out. I have yet to get it off, but will continue to try. Wish me luck, and take heed.<br /><br />The look is great, I got the black steel and with the black gearfit 2, and it looks fantastic. Really just sucks to workout or sleep with."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this dress but when I got it it was way too small it said true to size and I wear a large, really recommend to get a size or two bigger. I wear a large but the large was way too small😔"
3.0,I returned them.  They were uglier in person and I think I am more stylist than these shoes.
3.0,"As described, but even bigger on the face than I expected."
3.0,Ordered recommended size and fits everywhere but the chest and shoulders. It’s tight. I’ve ordered similar shirt and same size this material isn’t very stretchy
3.0,"A lil snug fit... but overall.. they fit well n arent TOO warm, which was something i was worried about."
3.0,"This is an undergarment. I would never wear it as a top. I'm only keeping because I am actually in need of a dark camisole to wear under a couple of sheer tops. Also, it's very long. Too long."
3.0,"Ordered my typical size Medium. Wanted to wear these under my scrubs for work. What a joke, these shirts just ride up right to your belly button with any bending or twisting.  I even tied my waste strings tighter to try and hold in place and it snuck through. Can't imagine they would stay in place for any workout. I even have. Short torso, so anyone with a long torso might find them to short in length. Better products out there. But hey for a price for 3 it might work for some but didn't for me. I returned them and would not recommend."
3.0,Looks nice but a little cheap.  Doesn't fit my mother's Brighton bracelet.  :(
3.0,"Somewhat small, but wb losing weight, so sb fine.  Love the print and style!"
3.0,"Cut & style were great! Material it's made of, not so much."
3.0,"The product is nice. It doesn't work for men with full on beards. Might be better for someone with a very short, manicured beard. It does breath well. Gave to my wife."
3.0,"Sizes run super small my son 5 yrs old  have no room inside the shoe , size 12 was too small compare to is regular shoe wich is 11 or 12 sizes."
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 198 lb and 40C. I bought the XL and it fits ok, I can lift my arms without straining the buttons, and the space between buttons does not open, which is rare for women my bra size.<br />The problem with this blouse is that it is just too short, it gets just to the beginning of the hip, making it impossible to wear inside a skirt or pant. Besides, it has a lot of loose threads and the fabric is kind of flimsy."
3.0,Super cute but the quality is cheap so dont expect to wear it but once or twice before the material comes apart.
3.0,"I obviously dont get measurements very well, this is so tiny.  Couldnt even get it on the end of my pinky.  What is this for?"
3.0,"This is a very nice hat.  I was sad when I found out that it was too small by mere inches.  The bow is nice and stiff so there is no worry of it flopping around and it is pure wool to it is thick enough to keep wind out.  This is a beautiful hat, but because it was too small I have to send it back AND I have to pay to have it sent back, which is a little unnerving.  I would recommend this hat to anyone that is a fan of cloches like me, but pay VERY close attention to the size so you don't lose a few more bucks to send it back."
3.0,"From this brand, I get a medium. Medium fit very well but I guess this is button down, it fit smaller. I would get a L for button downs"
3.0,Nice color  and style but material are somewhat cheap
3.0,"the hematite stones are beautiful quality, but the stetchy string it is made from is so flimsy i can see it coming apart already, and i just received it in the mail today. the string used for the other gemstone bracelets is very durable, why is it not used for the hematite, which is a much heavier stone?"
3.0,wish it was a little longer for wearing with sweaters
3.0,Item is bigger than I had expected and looks a little funny on the small diameter chain. Overall I am happy with purchase.
3.0,Bought the shirt in xxl and it fits ok around the chest and arms but it’s WAY too long.
3.0,"I bought these as part of a surprise anniversary outfit I put together for my husband...I'm glad there was two pairs because the first pair ripped immediately while I was putting them on :( I know fishnets aren't really made to be durable , but this wasn't my first rodeo with them and despite going very slow to put them on they still ripped :( really glad i didn't spend too much on them...not sure how i'm gonna fix the 1st pair but I'm gonna try..."
3.0,"Cheap but cute! Perfect gift for a child. Very difficult to put a picture in, we had to use glue."
3.0,I like the feel of this cardigan and fits nicely for the most part. Sleeves are too long for me though.
3.0,"I love Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and have worn them for years. These jeans are too small and the color (spring hydrangea) is not as blue as it appeared on internet; it is more of a light periwinkle blue. I will exchange for a size larger and hope that they will not be too big in the thighs. Also, may order the Geranium color or the Aqua Sky color. These two colors looked pretty online. The Amanda style is the only jean I wear; I have it in nine colors. It fits at the waist ( not a low rise), fits in the rear, and is the perfect length. They hold up well after many washings and they do not fade. I wish sizing could be consistent; it is too expensive buying and returning."
3.0,"I received this product in the color White Leopard.<br /><br />Packaging<br />The glasses arrived in a timely manner and the glasses were neither damaged nor open upon arrival.<br /><br />Style<br />The glasses are very feminine and beautiful. I really like the leopard design as it really brings out the beauty of the glasses. Bear in mind that the lenses are non-polarized, so they do not block the glare from reflected light; they only block intense light.<br /><br />Sun Protection<br />When purchasing polarized lenses that is one risk the consumer will never have to worry about because they offer 100% protection against UVA and UVB rays. That's one big difference between polarized and non-polarized sun glasses. These glasses are non-polarized, so I'm not 100% sure about their ability to protect the eyes from the sun.<br /><br />Comfort<br />Although the glasses look great, they aren't very comfortable after wearing for a long time. I would recommend that you wear these for activities that don't require long-time wear.<br /><br />Durability<br />The material of the glasses is quite strong.  It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy at all.  This surprised me as the lens and material are said to be made of plastic.<br /><br />I don't know if it's just the color I got, but if you're someone who likes sunglasses because people can't tell what you're looking at, these aren't for you. They are very, very reflective. I personally don't mind this, so this was not really an issue for me.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discounted or free price for evaluation purposes in return for my unbiased review, which I have provided here. I do not have a relationship with the seller or company, and have not been compensated for my review. The opinions stated here are my own and based on my personal use of the product."
3.0,"I ordered a size small and the waistband was way smaller than it seemed like it should have been based on the size of the rest of the pants (hip and butt area was very large). In addition, the waistband did not have much stretch to it, so they would be very uncomfortable to lounge in. They were also much more on the side of “high rise” than I had anticipated. The meterial is soft and seems to be of decent quality, but I will be returning these because they do not fit like a typical small."
3.0,"I have received the suitcases, and while they seem nice, on the big suitcase, the zipper is pulling away from the hard case… I plan to return it, however I will buy another one, and hope it is not deffective as well"
3.0,Great graphics but runs small and the material is cheap.
3.0,The sewing quality is great! The sizing isn’t based at all on the chart provided.
3.0,I ordered a 2x-no way were these a normal 2x.  I couldn't even get them over my shoulders.
3.0,Out fit was so cute. I got it for my 1 year old is is almost the perfect size for a 1 year old girl but the bow wouldn't fit it was like it was for a new born. Other than the bow the out fit fit as expected.
3.0,"I bought three of these as costumes for some high school students and the reviews warned about them being small so I bought one size larger than they wore. That was not enough. I had to return them all and reorder larger sizes. These were not for overweight girls either. One girl didn't even weight 100 pounds and she took a medium. Once you get one that fits, they look gorgeous and the girls said they stretched and felt good while they were dancing.  They wash well also. So, I would have given the review four stars with a simple warning about the size issue, but one of them started ripping after only being worn twice so I took away one star. If you are reading this and considering them, buy two sizes larger than you wear. They are worth the money since dance costume are usually expensive - just buy them big."
3.0,"A little too big and very sheer, works for the beach but not as a skirt"
3.0,"I had to make some alternations, the straps on the bottom were too long for my head"
3.0,I used this about three times and the third time one side kept sliding off. I got my normal size B so I would suggest going up a size
3.0,"I'm a 12/14 size normally and 5'6 and got the L-XXL. I like how thick they are and the waist band is perfect. They aren't see through at all. But, I can feel the fabric pull around the upper thighs. I wouldn't expect that in this size. I'd order up a size next time. I will not be surprised when they get a hole in this area. I do like the thickness and length though."
3.0,This dress is pretty but the picture is a little nicer than the product. You can tell it's not a high dollar dress but it's still pretty. We bought a small and it is closer to an average medium so I would probably try to size down. Small was the smallest they though. The top is completely see through so you would either need a full slip or a tank to wear under.
3.0,"Pants fit fine, but they fall down a lot, so would not be suitable for exercise or work. I will continue to use them for around the house tho. Need more support for the top. I wear size 12 and got the large. Maybe medium would have been more sufficient?"
3.0,Love the material and the length.  It was short in the waist.
3.0,This shoe did not fit properly :( . Even after reading reviews and went up in size still had to return them.  Good quality though.
3.0,"Its a nice shirt, but the sizes are off by a lot I ordered an XL and its more like a Small."
3.0,"The fabric is soft and the material of the quality seems good. On the inside, however, the inside of the hat has lose strings. I would have liked for the thread work to be done more carefully."
3.0,"I've had these for a year now, and initially I loved them.  They're really comfortable and well-fitting, but I noticed after a few months the cup padding started to come apart inside the bra (I had never removed them), leaving the cups looking lumpy and uneven.  For clarification I am not someone who is in the gym everyday and these are not my only sports bras, so they were each worn/washed no more than 5 times before the cup padding started to fall apart.  I've actually just had to order padding replacements that cost as much as the bras to avoid having to throw the bras out.  Not a good value when you have to purchase replacements for part of the bra."
3.0,Very basic - material is thin - not a good glove for outdoor activity.
3.0,"It's really pretty, but I can't yet wear it. I tried to follow the sizing guide, but I didn't have luck with it. I still think it's pretty, so I decided to keep it in the hopes of losing a bit of weight so I can still wear it."
3.0,"The material is very thin, but workmanship is fine. Runs a little small, but overall, they are a good value for the money."
3.0,Love the earrings and they are super cute! But I had re glue the post on the earring bc it fell off after a couple uses did not get wet
3.0,"A really nice looking watch, especially for the price, but a pin came out and the watch fell and shattered on the ground. Don't do anything too strenuous while wearing the watch because the quality is not that great."
3.0,"I have a 7.5 inch wrist, so I had to extend the “adjustment clip” fairly close to the watch face, which means the band on that side is doubled up and sticks out awkwardly on my wrist bone and the watch face will not sit flush on my wrist, it sticks off to one side.  That also means that you have to take one side of the band off in order to charge your watch which is cumbersome and will only degrade the clasps on that side.  I ended up purchasing the same band from another seller, but with a real metal clasp instead (that sits underneath my wrist instead) and that one works beautifully and lays correctly."
3.0,I had to glue some stones back into these when they came. I also didn't end up using them because they were too heavy to dance in. Very pretty though!
3.0,Wrinkles easily. Runs large.
3.0,Seems a little undersized order the next size up from your normal size
3.0,"The fabric clings to your body and it conducts a lot of static too. I would suggest buying a bigger size if your chest is big, it just flattened my chest."
3.0,The bra has no support for larger top.  The material shows everything and there is no padding nor can you insert padding.  Would not recommend to wear during a work out.  It is okay to wear around the house with a heavy thick sweatshirt.  The description does not note the lack of padding.  This would have been helpful.
3.0,"Seems a bit flimsy, but it is a fun way to stay dry and see where you're going...Paris!! - definitely a fashion umbrella - and you will not be tucking this one in your backpack."
3.0,"Tangles very quick, even when wearing it.  Pretty"
3.0,"Beautiful braclet, I loved the design.  I only have 3 stars because the fit was small."
3.0,Hat is very big and the vest is very  small
3.0,"I purchased this to wear to a costume event. Overall the quality is ok for a mass produced product. My biggest complaint is the nose piece for the plastic mask. The nose piece is solid so if it is smaller than your nose it will squeeze your nose shut, or partly shut, while worn. This was uncomfortable and made breathing through my nose difficult.  If the nose piece was wider it would have worked better and I probably would have given it 4/5 stars."
3.0,"Not good quality, but needed a gift right away, so we made due"
3.0,"Fuzzy and soft! Not durable stitching on the zipper, it came apart at the bottom right away."
3.0,"Thought this would be a sweet idea for my husband because he constantly travels, however, this keychain is super tiny.<br />I mean SUPER TINY! You can barely see the words on it because the engraving is in light grey color not black."
3.0,"Cute piece, but I have a long torso and the fit was all wrong."
3.0,"While the shoulders, arms, and bust fit, I am 5'7&#34; barefoot and this drapes on the floor. Would need to be hemmed or wear very high heals."
3.0,Very cute and comfy. After a few wears the plastic coating peeled off the rose gold.
3.0,A little tight around my eyes to a painful degree. Gave it to someone else and she did not have that problem. It ia a beautiful mask.
3.0,"These would be perfect for a kid or a woman with a little head. I am a normal size woman with a large-ish head and these barely stay on my face because they slide right off being too tiny. The lenses are small too. They look perfect on my 9 year olds, who don't need reading glasses... Don't buy if you have a relatively normal or large noggin.  Definitely not for men."
3.0,Enormous. Asian clothing is either too small or too large. I will stop buying them.
3.0,I got this for my dad.  I wanted to separate a cute saying we made up for each other and the words I love you dad. I submitted it with both sides to be caved in.  Came with only one side carved with both sayings. A little disappointed
3.0,Es demacrado ancho
3.0,"My grandson who is 6,  loves this suit. My only hesitation is that I originally order his size off the Amazon size chart, only to find it was too small. After sending it back and reordering a size larger, I found that although it does fit him, it JUST fits and will probably be too small at summers end. I would suggest if you have free returns, place an order two sizes greater."
3.0,"I am differently shaped than the model, but this fit more like an empire waist. I'm 5'2&#34;, and ordered a small. It fit, but not as I expected. I am large chested and it made for an unflattering fit. I wanted to love it, but ended up sending it back."
3.0,"The appeal of this sweater is the rosy color – it’s stunning. It’s really a beautiful color against any skin tone. This sweater is soft against the skin, almost like a form of cashmere. This sweater does run VERY large, I’d recommend almost sizing down almost two sizes, it’s very baggy. This sweater doesn’t shrink in the washer or dryer – so, you’ll want to size down to find the perfect size for you."
3.0,"I bought this for my seven year old niece. She loves it but it’s a little big, and it already looks dirty."
3.0,"I loved this at first, but after about five wears, the seams up top are ripping."
3.0,The grey mask is thicker than the black one.. they are comfortable and keep your face warm when it’s cold.
3.0,"The picture showed the hooks to be metal, so I returned them because they came in plastic."
3.0,"I was drawn to this bag because of its size and zippered compartments. The coin purse has also come in handy. However, on my third day with this bag, one of the zipper tabs came off!<br /><br />Deeply annoyed, and considering returning for a sturdier bag with more comfortable straps."
3.0,The actual fish was too large.
3.0,"My 12 y/o daughter loves the design, but the material feels like cheap polyester. It is not a fuzzy, soft fleece as one would expect from a hoodie. The body of the hoodie is a bit long and the hood itself is very small and fits tight if actually pulled up over her head."
3.0,Did not receive the brown that is pictured. Received a dark chocolate brown.
3.0,pockets are sooo small also the tie not made for American must be Asian size
3.0,"It's pretty, but very lightweight, and the quality isn't great.  Good gift for a young teen perhaps."
3.0,Demasiado delgada
3.0,"These sunglasses are as pictured and are incredibly unique. However, the sizing is a tad different than what I expected. It is very skinny and only fits specific face shapes."
3.0,Cute dress shoes. Too big and had to be returned.
3.0,"I wanted a hat to wear in my convertible other than a ball cap.  When I saw this online it looked somewhat more of the style I was seeking...a hat with a feminine touch since I have short hair.  I guess my head is considered smaller than average (mine is 21.5"" around) as most hats seem to be more for 22"" or 23"" inches minimum and adjustable to make it larger.  Upon receiving the hat (the seller was great by the way, prompt delivery, great pricing, and secure packaging), the quality seemed very nicely made but it was too big for me.  Instead of a dainty hat I looked more like a milkmaid as all you could see were my glasses peering under the rim...lol!  Anyway, I sent it back and have once again resorted to wearing my ball cap.  Nice touch with the chin strap which was the clincher in me ordering.  Oh well."
3.0,...somewhat of thin material... need a long sleeve shirt on underneath for warmth.
3.0,"The dress is pretty and fits nice but the color is misleading.  I ordered the dress that is red with white flowers and wanted to wear it for Valentines Day with a pair of really nice black boots that I have.  When I received the dress, it actually has LOTS of blue flowers in it too.  They are VERY hard to see in the image but if you zoom in (now that you know there is blue), you can see the blue.  Cute dress but will not work with the nice black boots I planned to wear so now I'm back to square one.  Will keep the dress to wear another time though."
3.0,It’s not as vibrant as pictured but will work for its intended purpose.
3.0,I would recommend going a size up than normal. Also the coloring of the shorts and shirt was really different colors of blue.
3.0,"Thicker and larger than expected.  Didn't really stay on my glasses, but the closest thing I could find to fit."
3.0,"The small piece on top of the gem is very crooked, and the gem I received was clear, not blue like in the picture. Mine was a nice speckled bronze, and it does look kind of old. I'm probably going to do some form of modification to the gem to either add colour or to make it look old."
3.0,Had to return these socks ... were way too big for my grandchild.  But looked to be of very good quality.
3.0,"The connectors feel cheap and are hard and sticky to turn.<br />Colors are ok, (no blue or pink) but the difficulty of tightening them makes my decision not to re order.<br />You get what you pay for."
3.0,First off the key chains are tiny. Smaller then you would even expect them to be. The quality on the picture is was more upgraded then the item itself.
3.0,it's OK
3.0,This band was good for a few weeks but has already broke. It doesn't seem like it was built for every day use and to be taken off regularly. Nice band while it lasted though.
3.0,I guess I didn't pay attention to the size and they were larger than what i wanted to use them for. Pictures can be deceiving so don't go off of that. They are nicely made and look good just bigger than i wanted.
3.0,Very soft and I like the color. It arrived with a small tear but it is not noticeable so I will be keeping it. Don't want to go thru the hassle of returning it. Other than that very cute scarf.
3.0,"Launder well for 2 washings- seem to soil easily. Not sure if that is good or bad. Good , if they have less synthetics and chemicals in them."
3.0,Love the fit and elastic.  Bow fell off after wearing one day so need to figure a way to put it back on
3.0,"Overpriced for quality, just okay."
3.0,"It is a very comfortable ring, but the paint inside the LSU didn't last with daily wear.  Now its just a purple ring.  The yellow part is on the inside and the ring is not reversible."
3.0,I bought several packs of these to hand out for teacher appreciation gifts.  There weren't enough backs in one package and too many in another. Only 6 plastic backs for 8 pairs.  But they are cute.
3.0,I didn't like them as well as the High rise pair
3.0,Doesn't look like the picture!
3.0,It's ok but Much greener then picture indicates. Picture looks more turquoise hten green
3.0,I wouldn't consider this a top for regular wear. It is large and thin.  The vinyl print seems very cheaply done and feels large and bulky on the thin fabric. It's fine to wear over a bathing suit.
3.0,"Nice and warm, but they  do slip and I have to pause and adjust them. I'd get some in the future with a different fabric covering."
3.0,"Lenses and overall fit are good, but one of the nose pads has already been dislodged and lost."
3.0,They fit and feel about as expected but the red color is more Christmas red than maroon
3.0,It was okay. The packaging was dusty and looked old.
3.0,"Got 2 of these for a stay in a very wet climate.  They are pretty good, but they do start to rust.  Should be made with stainless steel.  For $30 each, you would expect non-rusting!"
3.0,"I bought a small. It was still too big. The strap that goes around the neck was way too long and the breast part was just a tad too big. (I'm 4 10, 95lbs, 32C)"
3.0,The costume itself was fine but the cord on the fan broke and had to be rewired.
3.0,Doesn’t feel as well made as other Haix boots I’ve owned.  To be expected because of the price.
3.0,My daughter wore to 1 swim lesson and there is a huge amount of pilling.
3.0,The velcro holding it together is a disgrace in my opinion...it scratches the crap out of your neck. I did however remove the velcro and added a snap clasp. Learned to sew while doing so. Much better now.
3.0,3 stars because buttoning this thing was like rocket surgery.0
3.0,Tight in hips.
3.0,"Cute, but really see-through. Returned."
3.0,"No insulation, even with wool socks. My feet were cold all the time."
3.0,"I watched videos online of this solution removing ridiculous stains and was fooled.  I tried to wash my shoes with this and it did an alright job, it barely removed many staines and I had to spend close to an hour scrubbing."
3.0,"If you measure your child’s foot the sizing is as stated on the page. These shoes really are absolutely adorable on and my daughter seemed to find them comfortable. The quality is severely lacking. The crystal strips are glued on with glue that doesn’t hold, it was peeling off when I opened them. All in all they’re gorgeous from a distance and fine for one time use (like a wedding). Expect what you pay for 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,Kind of small fly me
3.0,"This nightgown is super comfortable but a little snug and I bought a size larger than I normally would to try to avoid this. I love the pockets it has though and I could totally where it out and about if I wanted to, but won't do to how snug it. Is."
3.0,"Runs small, as everyone previously had mentioned. I usually wear a large or maybe XL, but I bought the XXL and it does fit, but barely. The material is thin, stretchy kinda polyester, pretty cheap looking...Which I guess is to be expected with the price. I'm in my thirties and I'd say, ladies - leave this for the younger crowd."
3.0,"Baggy fit, runs big"
3.0,"I received this product on 2/3/18 and wore it probably 15 times or so in the less than two months I've had it, but the cord on it broke yesterday. I thoroughly enjoyed it while I could and would like to think I took decent care of the necklace by not tugging on it to turn it and by not sleeping and showering with it on. The cord broke about an inch away from where the closure loop is, so maybe it's just weak string. Not sure if I'd order another, but I plan on going to Michael's or Hobby Lobby to buy some cord and attempt to restring it myself."
3.0,I guess it makes sense why this was priced so low. The graphic is printed off center. I imagine it was not meant to be sold. Shirt is soft and comfy but I don't really want to wear it in public because of this flaw. Didn't notice until after the first wash so I didn't return it. Sizing is accurately a men's medium.
3.0,"Good quality, but the size chart must be corrected. Bought a 4T for a 3 year old, in hopes of having it for a while, and it was too small for him. Disappointed"
3.0,"no noticable change in energy but a nice looking ""fad"" piece. no benefit noticed in an extended period of time."
3.0,I Love the shirt..very cute. But runs very small!
3.0,"The fit is as expected but I am not thrilled with the fabric.  It is the same material that a dress slip is made of, or at least that is what it feels like.  It doesn’t look like the casual shirt in the picture.  I don’t care for the feel of the fabric on my skin, and it looks cheap.  I don’t see myself wearing it in the future, but I will try to find it a home with someone who likes this type of fabric and style of clothing."
3.0,"Box is beautiful and deserves a &#34;5 star rating.&#34; However, it lost that rating with me because it is not wide or long enough for most jewelry which either doesn't fit or gets kinked up.  It is a five star for smaller necklaces with lots of flexibility...necklaces that are not wide."
3.0,Stiffer fabric than imagined and tighter fit. Returned dress.
3.0,Looked just like the photo. Fits really small. No breathable room. Fitted my young granddaughter better.
3.0,"Glasses received were gray tinted, not brown as indicated in the photo."
3.0,it's not too bad.  the uper part fits a little tight but not unconfortable.
3.0,"Cute earrings, but they are difficult / awkward to close.  Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Warm yes but it is a hair magnet.
3.0,a bit loose
3.0,For the price it's worth it. Nothing special but didn't expect more.
3.0,It is all cotton so it has to be ironed which I am not happy about.
3.0,Good Quality but it's just toooooo small.....
3.0,"These are so flimsy, the one on the left with the half moon off... It came in a plastic baggie in a box, that ought to say it busted by putting them together in that bag to put in that little box. I'm  sure they didn't do it on purpose.<br />But....<br />The 2 on the right are a little thicker not much, but yeah, I'm going  to try to return them.<br />I'm afraid if I open and close them for fitting on my wrist they will eventually give way and bend to break.<br />So if your a Gentle person this might be for you if you're a little Rough they won't last.<br />You will find yourself outta the cash, and wasting gas and your time to just return them on the principle of the quality.<br />It's a cute concept, but they should of put a little thought into the quality in making these Gezz. Not sure about these!!<br />Lol, I'm going out of my way to try to return them, and waste my time because it's just not right. Made too cheaply.<br />(Principe of the fact, they sell these)"
3.0,This is a cute skirt with nice colors. It is just a but see through and thin. I'm not sure if I will keep it or send it back💜
3.0,"Very quiet running so far.  We'll see in a couple months/years, how motor holds up, especially with larger/heavier watch.  It spins at an angle, which could cause stress overtime.  I put a 45mm watch in it, and it just clears glass/plastic (whatever it is).  Any bigger watch, and this may not work - there is no clarification about that in the product description.  Parts, and mode switch on the back feel very sturdy and well crafted.  The manual describes four modes to select for turning/resting.  You have to work the math if you wish to know the approximate turns per day (TPD).  They are probably a little on the high side per day, unless you go with 4th setting, where watch rests for 9 hours.  I need to make adjustments to my watch bracelet (make smaller), and I hope watch pillow still grabs enough surface area inside ring to stay put.  The material inside the case is described as velvet.  This does not appear to be any type of velvet I've ever seen - it looks and feels more than a faux leather, or vinyl.  It does it's job well enough.  The fit, finish, and English details in description and manual leave a little to be desired.  You get what you pay for, and again, this is not bad for the money."
3.0,The dress is a soft material and fits well but is very snug where the slit begins. It will work but really would like a little extra room in that area for comfort. It is definately a mermaid type fit and light weight. The off shoulder is complimentary as I wanted to avoid a sleeveless dress for summer graduation. It is an xxl...happy with purchase.
3.0,"I wanted to love this suit. The color and quality and cut are so cute. Unfortunately it wasn’t long enough for my torso despite being a size 10. The fit everywhere else was great (bust, waist, etc). It is only the length that was too short."
3.0,Love this product but both of my necklaces broke :/
3.0,"The shirt is a pretty color, but very flimsy and see-through. It will be suitable for me as a running tank worn over a spirts bra, but I would not wear it for anything else."
3.0,Its a thin cap with the saying just glued on.
3.0,"Bag is super cute, but the zipper busted first trip out. If this feature were stronger I'd bump my review up to a 5 star!"
3.0,A very awkward fit.
3.0,Its atleast 1 to 2 sizes bigger than expected
3.0,"They're not particularly comfortable, nor will they really keep out the dust at Burning Man, but great for a steampunk costume, whether on your face or fashionably up on your forehead."
3.0,"I give 3 stars because these earrings is smaller. The pitcher is looking much bigger. I a little bit dissapponted ,"
3.0,"Nice dress but I ordered according to the size chart, and that thing was tiny!"
3.0,"If you want the dress to look like the picture, order it a size larger.  In reality, it looks like a tee-shirt and doesn't have the dropped shoulder look.  The fabric which is supposed to be 95% cotton and 5% lycra (or something like that) feels more like polyester than cotton.  After washing, I will reevaluate and see if it feels more like cotton or if it shrinks (which will be a problem)."
3.0,Super small don't buy it.
3.0,"Haven't worn it yet...it feels cheap but I'm interested to see how it wears. It isn't flat as appearing in the picture, the top of the necklace rests against the neck like a chocker."
3.0,"Nice for the beach, however shorter than expected."
3.0,"I gave this three stars because when I received this not only was the chain busted but it was also rusty.  While I was able to repair the broken chain I was not able to remove the rust. The pendant, on the other hand was perfect. So, overall this wasn't a bad purchase. Considering what you pay, a broken rusty chain is nothing. If you add a black ribbon necklace to the pendant and it looks awesome. Keep in mind if you do buy this the pendant is about two inches in length and slightly heavy."
3.0,I wish I didn't purchase.  I wash my hands a lot and there's always condensation under the crystal.  I'd advise to keep looking.
3.0,Love this bag for travel. However only been used 3x and the pocket in the top has already ripped. Disappointing.
3.0,"No me impresionan, comparada a la foto. Los diamantitos blancos demasiado pequeños y parace soldaduras."
3.0,More of a washed out navy color not a really nice material
3.0,We love it but it was too small. You need to make bigger hats!!!
3.0,4t is way too short for a 4 year old. Read the product description before purchase. It does say it's not 100% cotton and it's comfortable but I didn't like the cloth and cant let my daughter wear it.
3.0,"These sweats are nice enough. The complaint I have is that they're too short in the leg and from the crotch to the waistband, also too short. Other than that they're a good deal for the money."
3.0,"Cute, but waaaay to small!! I'm 5'3 150lbs, curvy and its waaay to small."
3.0,"Get what you pay for, drove around with them at night nothing special, however they are worth 20$ I would say"
3.0,it didn't really feel like it was 100% cotton.  some of the sizes were different....inconsistent in the materials as well.  just a lot of inconsistencies overall with each mask.  but my daughter really liked it so we just kept it.
3.0,mediun
3.0,"I like the idea of these little pouches - will fit into smaller spaces that the traditional eye-glass holders and will also hold larger pairs of classic sunglasses, HOWEVER - the drawstring is pretty much useless as it does not stay drawn. Not sure how I'm going to tackle that bit of issue, but otherwise, good for what I bought them for!"
3.0,I love them but the shorts are way smaller than the top .
3.0,"Good quality fabric and nice shape, but the torso was very short, so I had to return."
3.0,I love the mask only if they came with the little rubber thing to adjust the mask.. would have given it 5 stars. So now I use rubber bands to tighten the mask.
3.0,"This shirt was too tight in the chest even though I followed the size chart. The green is much darker also, almost a black. Returning. Shirt does have a decent shaping, not too baggy on the bottom. I ordered the xl with a 40” bust."
3.0,It is a nice dress but too snug not enough give have to send it back.
3.0,"These are not corduroy but rather velvety because they have a smooth texture but not actually like true velvet. I'm normally a 30&#34; waist but sized down since that size wasn't available. They're a little tight so I'd say they run true to size. The boot cut is very minor, I'd call them straight leg actually."
3.0,Would have been a 5. But the bar is not long enough.
3.0,"The bottoms were perfect.  But the top was no where close to being a Large...not in America, at least.  So, I love the pattern but not sure what I can do about a top.  I'm going to have to spend more money to find a plain top to go with the bottoms, which my really bums me out.  I loved the print of the whole suit."
3.0,If your bigger than a 32a forget it
3.0,"Bought it on a lark. Seems overly bulky, and screams look at me. I do not wear it much, but did today. I noticed it is losing time, not a lot, but noticeable. May give it to one of my nephews, it is an okay watch, rugged, but not very classy."
3.0,"Sift smooth material, thin for cards and dollars.no pocket for change."
3.0,"I purchased a size 7/8 for my 6 year-old daughter knowing that she typically fits in size 6X/7 because she is slim and tall for her age. However, this bathing suit was too tight and not long enough. It's very cute, but beware of the sizing."
3.0,"love the pattern and shape of it, but was too small."
3.0,"I love the graftobian modeling wax have had it before and it is great. However it's not what I ordered. I ordered the thick blood/scab blood. It's pretty confusing to me as well because in my cart, orders, and even writing a review right now it has a picture of the blood. However if I click on it it'll show up as the modeling wax. It's still an amazing product and will use it but it's not what I was looking for/needed. Also it had delays getting here but it came before Halloween so I'm fine with it"
3.0,It was honestly pretty good
3.0,It’s not stretchy like most sweatshirts are. I usually wear a med or large depending on what kind of clothing it is. I wanted large to be a little baggy or atleast stretchy. It fits a little tight with no stretch.
3.0,"These bottoms are just a bit too cheeky for my comfort level. I wrote a more inclusive review on this set on the raceback top to it - as this set has to be purchased separately. I ordered these in a size medium, and I am 5'6"", 135 pounds. I don't like that there is too much showing in the bikini area, and wish that the front was slightly wider because I am not all about showing that much, especially in public. I also feel like the back will ride up when wearing this throughout the day, but if I ordered the size large, the top of the waist would most likely fall down.<br /><br />I do not feel like this was made for real bodies. I would still recommend the set and the brand because the quality is amazing, and the color is gorgeous!"
3.0,The smell is incredibly awful like chemicals even after multiple washes. They have a long crotch so it looks saggy if you don’t pull them up constantly
3.0,Photo of actual size would show how small it really was.
3.0,I should have ordered a smaller size
3.0,"Maybe i have a big head or something. But these pop off super easily. I have really curly hair that needs to be kept out of my face when I work out. But after 30 minutes or so, these usually pop off/slide off.<br />Okay for the price."
3.0,"Too long, couldn’t wear."
3.0,They meant it when they said order up. I got an XXL and it's *maybe* a size small/medium by US standards.
3.0,Listed as one piece but 2 piece with skimpy bikini bottoms. Not for fuller busted women.
3.0,"I've used a deployment buckle for years. This one is mid-grade, in terms of quality. The clasp is a bit flimsy and doesn't align perfectly when I buckle it, so I have to fiddle with it sometimes. And I don't love the texture on the rubber band, as it get dirty and I have to scrub it to get the grooves clean."
3.0,"The material is good and comfortable.  However, I ordered a large (I'm usually a medium), and there isn't much room in the pouch.  If you have an average sized chunk, you won't fit in this."
3.0,"Advertised as over the calf, but at best they come to mid calf and then fall down over the course of a day of moving about. The center sock was black and only one was striped. Disappointed."
3.0,"The description clearly said leather gloves, so NOT leather! But still cute."
3.0,"I did not like the material that it is made out of and the turkeys were bigger than I expected.  It was nice, but just not what I expected."
3.0,Have a tendency to slip. Colors are great.
3.0,"It's cute or whatever.. BUT I absolutely HATE the fact that they are gym shorts with 2 stripes down the side. The fit is extremely small, ordered a 2x and it fits like a Smedium!"
3.0,"I ordered the XL and am 5'5&#34;, 180 lbs. Dress hugs all your curves and hit below the knee. No need for shapeware, material will smooth out any imperfections on your booty/thighs. Will stretch and distort the color of the black and will turn gray in your boobs/booty. Looking forward to wearing this in Vegas."
3.0,Whoa.....this dress was huge!!!!!  Beautiful dress though.  I match my granddaughters measurements and weight.  Kept because she will eventually grow into it.
3.0,Slightly smaller than the dress I ordered previously even though it was the same style and size.
3.0,"The dress is very elegant, I like the fabric fit very nice to your body but the dress is poorly sewed.  It came with two holes on it."
3.0,Stone looks cheap but nice set overall.
3.0,"I bought the exact dress from a different company that had better quality. This one came with a hole in the pocket, and seems thinner. Love the color, which is why I got This brand."
3.0,"Dress is just ok, I bought it for my wife. The fabric is  thinner that I would have expected."
3.0,Back is extremely tight.
3.0,So cute but fell apart after one river trip.
3.0,See through but still cute for home or swim cover up
3.0,"I'll still wear it, but it wrinkles weirdly easily. Like, just from a couple of hours of wear. Also it shows that you have shorts on from behind. Only the front looks like a skirt."
3.0,What I liked about the hoodie was that it fits my niece and she was comfortable.
3.0,Very sensitive. Beads fall off very easily
3.0,"I wanted to love these sunglasses...but sadly they just didn't work for me. I have a small face and they looked kind of cartoony on me. They appear well made and the packaging/extras (case, cloth and screwdriver keychain) are a nice touch, but sadly they didn't work for me so they are being returned."
3.0,"Does what it says,  nice control panel. But very noisy. Compared to Rapport and Volta."
3.0,"Bracelet itself is very nice. Reason for 3 stars is because it comes undone very easily. Just from regular wear, the clasp becomes undone. Might need to update the clasp. My fiance loves it besides that issue."
3.0,"Like cheap polyester pajamas from the 80s. Very high rise and I hope you have no midsection flab otherwise that muffin will be beautifully showcased like an overstuffed sausage. No stretch whatsoever so order up a size if you have hips, booty, or belly. Also, swamp ass city in this utterly non-breathable fabric. But hey, the print is cute."
3.0,"I wore the band only about a week when the metal bar inside the watch band at the end broke.  How this could have happened is unknown as there shouldn't have been any stress on this piece and it's not even visible when installing or wearing the watch.  I was able to get a refund without any issues, so happy with the outcome even if the band wasn't for the long haul."
3.0,"Watch is probably great, I was replacing one I'd had for years. Just be aware it is sized for a slim wrist, not a man. The resin strap is rubber. Going to return but after having to pay return postage and hassle of going to PO its not worth it, will gift to child."
3.0,Weird fit. Very short. A bit puffy
3.0,"It's considerably bigger than I thought, it hung almost to my lip, my husband said it looked like I had a golden Hitler Stache."
3.0,Arrived with 3 missing buttons
3.0,I like the fabric but they are way too small. And I even upped a size. I needed these for a vacation I'm taking in 10 days and looks like I'm stuck with them because I know I won't be able to exchange them by then. So you may need to double up in size. But the quality is nice.
3.0,"Having purchased a pink for a photoshoot with a breast cancer survivor, I am disappointed that the color is actually coral. I will have to manipulate it in Photoshop, but I just wish it looked like the sample images. And the length is nowhere near like the pictures make it seem to be.  I wanted to wrap it around the cancer survivor to make it into the shape of a support ribbon, but I am not sure it will cover what I wanted.  Still very pretty, and very soft, but just not what I expected."
3.0,"The price was right, but they have too much material for my personal taste. I'm sure they're great for others, I just don't love much around my neck and was hoping these would be less fabric than they are."
3.0,"This fit bit band is SUPER comfortable. I barely noticed i was wearing it, which i loved. Once on my wrist, it never rolled around, rotated, it stayed right where it needed to be. It was snug, easy to get on and off, but unfortunately only lasted about 4 months before the stretchy band started to wear out. It's somewhat loose now, and gets caught on things and rolls around on my wrist. Besides only lasting a few months, this is a great watch band. Unfortunately it just has to be replaced sooner than i expected."
3.0,"Hmmmm...it not too bad; however, the pocket is weird. The pockets are too short but the coat is cute"
3.0,I'm about 5'5 and 115 pounds and this was too short. I don't have a long torso but still had to really stretch this to put it on. Had to return.
3.0,Can’t breathe
3.0,Nice material for warmth.  Does not wrap and cover comfortably.  Very open at the neck.
3.0,The design of the earing is absolutely beautiful. It was a gift to my sister and she loved the design but the quality was poor. The pearls were put together oddly and they were loose.
3.0,"The square is too small to stay put in the breast pocket. It keeps sliding down, out of sight. If they doubled the size I'd give it five stars."
3.0,"Not super happy with these. They seem much harder to clean and get smudges off than the originals. Also, I feel cross-eyed while wearing them. Could be a result of the polarization. If I had to do it again, I'd go non-polarized."
3.0,Over a short time band started to change colors.due to wear ...
3.0,Shirt is cute but it runs super big. I got a small and it’s still really loose. I’m 165lb and I got a small. Wish I would of did xxs
3.0,"After only a month of having these, the pearl on one of the earrings came undone on one of the earrings."
3.0,Small and doesn't stretch
3.0,"I followed the sizing info where it said to order "" one size up"" . So I ordered 36 instead of 34 and the belt is too big. They did send a tool that I'm supposed to punch a hole but can't figure that out. The belt itself is nice though. Too much trouble to send back."
3.0,Not a dress to short looks like a shirt
3.0,"Needed these for when I would have to run with my training class in the New England winter.  However, in the first two steps the battery packs flew out."
3.0,quality isnt as good as the picture depicts. they fray out eazy. Could be alot better. the threads arent sewed in properly
3.0,"I like its quality is good, but too difficult to wash"
3.0,"As others have said, the sizing is off.  For an xl, the waist was just too tight for loose, casual pants.  I would have bought these in other colors if the sizing were right and worn them all summer long.  Also, the elastic waist, as noted by others, would tend to twist.  Just a couple of tweaks and these pants would be perfect. Seemed good quality for the price.  I am 5”6” with a 28” inseam and these were perfect length for me as ankle pants to wear with sandals. If your legs are longer then they would be “crops.” My advice to the seller is make more sizes and you won’t be able to keep these in stock!"
3.0,"These are well made glasses and come with a nice storage case to keep them protected when not in use. I think the little ""glasses"" attached to the inside for polarization is weird...just polarize the whole lens or don't polarize it all. This piece can be taken off easily, though.<br /><br />I have a men's medium sized head, and these are bit wider than I'd prefer...they stick out too far on the sides of my face."
3.0,This tennis skirt runs on the small side. I should be a comfortable medium but this is snug at the hips and tight around the waist. I have to move the button to fit better.
3.0,Nice material. Vibrant colors. Didn't hold my side-boobs in so it was returned
3.0,I returned this item but it was mostly my fault for not paying attention to the color description.  I was looking for something with a bit more of a mustardy yellow color but this ginger yellow was just too bright for me.
3.0,ok bright no on off switch one level of brightness
3.0,"These ace Men's running rocks are really comfy once you're wearing them. They were great when I went out for a jog this morning<br /><br />However, they're really tight on the leg.. Which isn't uncomfortable when you're wearing it but that does make it difficult to put the sock on in the first place. I hit my foot against a table trying to get my foot inside the sock, twice. Maybe they'll loosen up over time, but for now, that's a major downfall."
3.0,"A little skinny for me, they're good sized and look good. They also feel good to wear but when I look in a mirror it's slightly out of my taste."
3.0,"Great little cap, works as advertised. Only downside is that it feels cheaply made and will for sure start unraveling soon. You get what you pay for is the moral I guess."
3.0,Very pretty but doesn't hold essential oil scents for long.
3.0,I love the hat except it came with a hole in the seam where the hat meets the brim. Unfortunately it can’t really be fixed without the hat losing its shape. I’m really disappointed because I like the hat in every other aspect. Still going to use. I figure it’s just another 2020 heartbreak.
3.0,Looks pretty but runs small and thin material.Its going back
3.0,Lenses are a bit bigger than the size I was looking for but overall they’re cool for the price. I’m trying to figure out how to return mine they have a scratch on lens and frame unsure how that is possible I bought them new.
3.0,Very tight in the calf area. Kind of looks like a diaper. Material isn't bad for the price.
3.0,"Using the provided size chart I ordered a large. I usually wear size 7 jeans, weigh 140lbs, and have issues finding things that fit due to my butt. The large was good. Deff wouldn't go smaller. I do think they make my butt look weird but I think it's just the texture from the sequins. They do zip up on the side. Not a lot of stretch."
3.0,Lightweight and cheaper quality but that’s to be expected for the price.  Cheap reading glasses and serves their purpose.
3.0,Colors is great but it’s super stiff and has no give . Had a hard time fitting stuff in it which is crazy because this bag is HUGE
3.0,Hat too deep for my head 😏
3.0,Arms are very wide and sloppy.
3.0,I am hoping I can sew it up. I only had them for a month but the crotch broke out a hole. I like the color and style of the pants but the hold indicates a very cheap method was used for sewing them together. I do not put any excessive stress on the crotch area as I only wear these for lounging - NOT for exercise etc. I am going to try to sew it up myself but it is still a sign of very cheap manufacturing that this happens after only a few times wearing them.
3.0,The necklace was to short in back. I had to add links so it could fit.
3.0,"I bought these straps to replace worn out straps on a tote.  Although they will do, they are very rigid and uncomfortable."
3.0,"Good fit, nice material but legs roll up with riding… hate that :-("
3.0,"it was small , but it will still probably work"
3.0,They are okay.  The lens aren't that dark.
3.0,The suit is very flimsy.  The color is outstanding.  Loved that but the material is very flimsy and thin.  I wouldn't buy it again.
3.0,"Fits good, but the torso area is pretty short. It is very comfortable but very thin material. Arrived in mail almost 2 months after ordering it unfortunately."
3.0,"Very spacious,inside zipper seperated from netting on the first use,was disapointed.other than that good product,great organizer,very convenient."
3.0,"Horrible smell and it doesn't go away, and was spedting a darker color."
3.0,They looked nice but they were too tight for my granddaughter who is 14 and not heavy at all.
3.0,They roll down when you move around. I ordered according to the size chart but they are a bit to tight. Not sure if the will roll if you order a size up.
3.0,"Only wear every so often, print only lasted a month"
3.0,I'm not saying they aren't right BUT I am saying that the top of the waist is tight.  I wear them to workout in but I don't weart them for any extra amount of time.  Other than the top band they fit true to size.
3.0,"I LOVE this ring, but it arrived with minor damage. The silver had detached under the stone. Possibly a fluke."
3.0,It took a million years to get here and I wish it didn't have as much piercings for tongue. I would much rather have nose studs.
3.0,Got a 2T for my daughter and it fits like a 4T very big and cheap material but it’s cute for the price
3.0,Beads were falling off returned item
3.0,"It was a little longer than I anticipated, but it fit and wore well."
3.0,The stones don’t look like different colors as pictured. Black bracelet only. Functional but not as pictured
3.0,These are cute earring fun to wear . I only gave it 3 starts cause one of the cobweb earrings was broken .
3.0,Did not work well at all!
3.0,"great product, just too small for what I needed"
3.0,Some earrings are hard to get on.
3.0,A little small for size description and shrunk a tad but compression effective for my kiddo
3.0,Can easily be stripped of over screwed
3.0,"This is extremely small, barely fit my daughter and it was an awkward style."
3.0,"My wife really like the sleeves, and the top half of the dress is great, true to size and color as shown. The bottom half was a bit of a problem, more bubble-shaped than we had thought. Instead of going flat down like in the picture, it shapes in and was tight at the hem. This made it look weird and feel very uncomfortably form fitting in the wrong places.<br />Perhaps on someone else it would be more comfortable, but it wasn't my wife's style."
3.0,"These pants are so cute I wish they were true to size and fit me. I usually wear a size 27/28 in pants, and I ordered a medium but I had a good inch and a half gap on the zipper. There was no stretch in the waist line either. Such a bummer as I loved the material and the style."
3.0,Cute and comfy. The zipper at the butt broke immediately. And the whole outfit is obviosly huge as I expected. Not bad for the price but I doubt it will make it through the wash many times
3.0,I expected this dress to be somewhat loose but it was surprisingly tight around the bust and when I sat the area under the bust was snug as well. Very disappointing. The material was all right and I liked the color and length.
3.0,I couldn’t tell from the picture that the strap is a brown leather. It makes an otherwise cute purse very unattractive and ruins the “special occasion” look I was trying to gift my niece.
3.0,You get what you pay for in this case...
3.0,"Super cute and exactly what I thought they’d be, but one of the earrings tarnished on me after a few days. The others haven’t tarnished at all so wondering if I just got one defective one."
3.0,"I so badly wanted to rate these 5 stars becuase they fit well and are really cute! The charms do not move which works well for my ears , and normally a bar with a charm is $10 alone! only reason for 3 stars is I only got 5 bars! I got all the ones with charms still worth the price and I love them super comfy and cute and it doesn’t spin around or slid!"
3.0,Very cute top if it was a little longer .....more of a crop top then a t shirt.
3.0,I ordered 2 different sweaters. After reading they ran small I ordered the a large for my son who wears a medium and a xxl for myself who wears a xl.<br />The xxl size arrived first and was skin tight on me but for my son perfectly so I cancelled the other order. Now my son has a cool sweater and I don’t :(.<br /><br />Seriously if you wear a xl or xxl do not order these as the xxl fits my son who wears a medium size....
3.0,The bust to big
3.0,Lovely material bit jist huge<br />.definitely go down a size
3.0,I initially loved the feel and weight of the sock.  Unfortunately they are not that durable.  a couple of the pairs are starting to unravel mid-foot.  I am not understanding why because it is mostly on the side of the foot an not in an usual wear area like the toe and or heel areas.
3.0,I expected better quality for the price
3.0,It looks to big on your arm.
3.0,Kid like button small for the price
3.0,Liked the look of this pant until I washed it....
3.0,Odd fit. Way too large and no curves to the dress. The fabric was stretchy. Overall (and sadly) an extremely unattractive dress.
3.0,Not made of huge quality. I had purchased this for a gift and it is kind of chinsy.
3.0,"These pants are NOT high waist, I would classify mid to low. Short in the crotch area, not reinforced.  If you are dead set on high waist, I wouldn't recommend these. Material very thin, so if you are looking for a heavier test material, these pants are not it.  Design is cool, I think these will be fine going into summer."
3.0,these show every little dimple and bump on my imperfect body. I was hoping because they were lined that they would camouflage a little better but no
3.0,I wish the legs were maybe 1 inch longer. They ride up and turn into briefs. Work well in the heat of early summer
3.0,Like the design but the material appeared faded which was disappointing because the design is beautiful
3.0,The pants fit well but the material is thinner than I expected. A better weight for warmer weather.
3.0,"I bought a large. I'm 5'8&#34; 138 lbs, 38 inch bust with a long torso and it's a good fit.<br /><br />Now, some reviews said the white isn't see through. That's absolutely not true. It is see through.<br /><br />Some of the edges of the flowers aren't very secure. Definitely not the best quality but okay for the price. Very cute but wouldn't buy again due to quality.<br /><br />I'll update with a photo and update on how it holds up in the wash."
3.0,"I got the matching hoodie to these Adidas girls ombré gradient leggings and I absolutely love the colors! There such pretty pastels and the colors are just as vibrant in person as online. The colors really are gorgeous!<br /><br />However what I do not like is how ridiculously thin these are. You know how thin panty hose are? That’s pretty much the thickness of these leggings. What’s odd about this is that the matching hoodie is super thick. Why would you make a matching set of paper thin leggings and a super thick hoodie?!?!<br /><br />Fit wise these seam just very slightly smaller than other girls Adidas pants and leggings that we have. Not enough to say that you should size up, but if this size is just barely fitting then it might be a good idea to since the do run very slightly small. Overall it’s a shame that these are so thin because they are super pretty!"
3.0,"This was an attractive inexpensive purchase, marked down from $100 to $39. I am a frequent traveler and needed to replace my small over-nighter carryon. Functionally, this works great for a two-night trip. The inside is just what I needed. My issue is the handle is flimsy and the wheels are not up to par. The bag likes to go it’s own direction sometimes.<br />Today is my first trip with the new bag, I’m not impressed, but I guess for an over-nighter it’s just okay. I wonder how many more trips until either the handle or wheels break."
3.0,"I bought mine in store, not on amazon, I have had them about 3 years and they have held up great. With that being said, I am fairly flat-footed, and the ""arch support"" is created by the bottle opener. Well that area has absolutely NO give, and after 30+ minutes of wearing them it really starts to hurt your foot. If you have a high arch, they might not bother you. After 3 years of heavy use, the arch is still just as hard as the day I got them, and honestly, who is going to use a bottle opener from the bottom of your dirty shoe??"
3.0,Attractive design but way too small. Not meant for anyone with even slight curves.  Straight up works best here.  Returned it.
3.0,one size fits all runs way too small
3.0,You just have to guess what size might be appropriate. Reading reviews leaves you little wiser but does tell you that lots of people have the same problem trying to figure out size. Quality seems fine; just wondering if I have to buy all sizes to figure out the best one.
3.0,This was precious when our daughter openeded it up. She loves frozen and calls it her Else necklace. It's well made. Study. Hasn't changed her neck colors nor has the jewelry itself become tangled or dinghy. It's a really good bet for the valvue.
3.0,"I really liked the style of the jumpsuit, however it did not fit me properly. Also the color description for red was not truly accurate...it’s more of an orange-red."
3.0,"Don't trust the sizing chart completely. It will be large. Also, the design is under some transparent polymer, so the pictures are not what it looks like. It has a far cheaper and less luxurious look to it. Makes a good thumb-ring though. Hope it doesn't scratch easily."
3.0,"I was way too short...I'm 6'2""."
3.0,"Its worth what you pay for. Its a cool design,but the clock does not work."
3.0,"This dress fit as expected but was very short. I'm 5'9&#34; and I wouldn't wear this without leggings, which I don't think goes well with the dress. I ended up returning the dress mostly due to the length but I didnt find the style/quality to be attractive overall."
3.0,Nice piece but the way you connect it is a bit weird.......but overall looks good
3.0,"We were concerned that this hat would not get here on time for the event it was ordered for, and extremely happy when it came just in time. (1 month exactly from order date.) The excitement was short lived when we opened the box to find the pink instead of the white. Too late to order another, so completely useless to us. It’s pretty, well made, and well worth the price, but of no value if it’s not the right color. Hence, the mediocre rating."
3.0,It is a nice looking belt but after a few weeks of wearing it for work it started to unravel.
3.0,They are about a 1/4 inch shorter than the originals below the eyes. I can tell they are not of the quality of the originals but for the price they are ok
3.0,Way too big for my 4 year old grandson and I had to return them.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but really cheap.. They didn't last more than a handful of wears."
3.0,"They are well made and stylish, but does not change color at all..."
3.0,they fit true to size but the tops are wider than what the picture shows
3.0,"They look great but. However, when I tried them on they will not stay up. Also, the elastic part around the thigh is too big for me. Sending them Back. Might work better with thicker thighs and legs."
3.0,"I had my piercer put one of these in right at my six week mark. He had a hard time screwing the diamond in because of how little it is. I had it in for 2 days and my lip started to grow around the part in my mouth. I went back to my piercer and he said the bar is too short. So, I am unable to wear them. However, for the week that I wore them I loved them. Very small and pretty. Good material that didn't irritate my skin. The description says the length is 10mm but that is not true. It is actually 8. So, I did some research and the one I was pierced with was 11mm and these were 8mm. Just switched to a 10mm and it's a little long for my taste. Wish I could wear the 8."
3.0,"Might be a bit flashy in color, my grandson does not seem to like them"
3.0,nice fabric and design
3.0,"it was ok. I got it for surfing and it was too big right when i tried it on. it might have worked if i went for a smaller size, but it felt cheap and i found something else in a store that worked better.<br />it didnt feel like it would actually stay snug while i was in the water, so i didnt bother with an exchange."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress with nicely draping fabric, but it fit oddly.  I ordered my usual size and it was too tight in the chest (and I'm not what you would call overly endowed) but fit fine in the waist.  I considered returning and sizing up, but then I think the waist would've been too large.  Sadly returned."
3.0,"The shirt is super cute, however it is WAY too small and the fabric is WAY too thin."
3.0,"Very soft, however fits much larger in size"
3.0,"I haven't tried this on my 10 month old son yet, but it appears to be a true fit, so there's that. And I love the pattern, very different. HOWEVER...the description says &#34;cotton blend&#34; and if you view the tag in the picture, it says 100% cotton. It's not. It's bathing suit material, so some sort of lycra/spandex material. It was very inexpensive, so I knew going in there was a chance I wouldn't get what I was expecting, so not terribly disappointed, but be aware that it's not a soft cotton as the tag/details would make you think. It's basically a full body bathing suit for a baby, which isn't altogether a bad thing. I think I'll use this not as a traditional outfit but as my son's pool outfit, as this will cover him more against the son, so it's not a complete loss."
3.0,"This necklace was cute, 11 year old granddaughter loved it, but the chain was really short.  I could barely get it fastened around her neck.  Unless you want a choker-like necklace, I would only recommend this for younger girls."
3.0,"Beautiful print, didn't expect the material to be so shiny. Fit larger than expected."
3.0,It looks like a watermelon
3.0,"This was supposed to come in a size Small, but somehow we got a XXL, but my wife enjoys oversized clothes anyhow so it worked out. That being said, it may not work out for everyone who could come across this issue, so it's not ideal. The coat itself is nice for wearing around the house to keep warm in the winter but I would not recommend it for being worn outside in cold weather. The material breaths easily so it's not sweaty to wear inside, but it doesn't really do much against the cold wind in the winter time. The material might be itchy or irritable to some people, but it is nice and soft. I would recommend washing it with a good fabric softener before wearing,"
3.0,Bought as a gift for my wife. She's about 5'8&#34; and usually wears medium to large sizes depending on the brand. This cardigan is almost exactly what she wanted but is on the small side. It's soft and comfy but not lose yourself in line she wanted.
3.0,Despite being cheap this turned out to be really cute.  I have a cat lover sister and child so I got it for them - they seemed pleased.
3.0,"My daughter loves them, but the shirts shrank right away and are impossible to get on her.  She's 2 and I bought 3T.  The pants are fine, I had to buy plain tShirts to go with them so she could keep wearing 1 part of them."
3.0,"Pretty but the gap between the dress and the lace was too big, and the dress runs small especially in the chest."
3.0,"This is a Christmas gift, so don't know yet on fit."
3.0,The charms were super cute but I did not receive all 30PCS Shoe Charms so I had to send them back. I am going to re-order and hope that the packing contains ALL charms!
3.0,Cute and nice feeling material just wayyy too small. I’d probably have to up at least two sizes for these to fit.
3.0,"Great for athletics, not so much for healthcare."
3.0,"I guess this is what I ordered. But the sequence are larger than they appear in the picture. And as another review mentioned the sequence are scratchy and that would have made me uncomfortable. So I returned it. However, the dress was cute. And it fit. Just not as comfortable as I would have hoped. So again, I returned it."
3.0,"This jumpsuit fit me perfectly;however, it was a bit thin and slightly see through for my liking. If they change the fabric it would be perfect."
3.0,"This necklace really caught my attention, but I did not know it was plastic. Still nice, but hopefully, no one touches it...lol."
3.0,"Cheap materials: very thin, no leather.<br />Order one size smaller, as these run large."
3.0,Fabric is a bit flimsy. And I would’ve preferred it to be a thong back.
3.0,Too big for women
3.0,Just carry bag will serve its purpose it looks and feels cheap
3.0,"This umbrella was great, and it lasted fine for just about a year. But it's now literally falling into pieces. I had high expectations because it has a double layer and generally seemed sturdy. But though you can kind of use a normal umbrella even if it breaks a bit, this one is completely hopeless."
3.0,"The gloves arrived with a very strong odor which did not go away after throwing it in the washing machine. Furthermore, it is not very comfortable, even though I ordered a size larger, it feels very tight and I can barely move my fingers. The touch functionality is affected by the fit. Aside from comfortability, they do keep my hands very warm in 20F weather."
3.0,"The sides were too loose by the chest, and I'm a 38D- returning item. Might be better in smaller sizes"
3.0,"My grandson loves it. Too bad he can’t wear it. It’s a child’s size and I didn’t know, but it’s exactly what he wanted."
3.0,Top fits perfectly. Bottom too small
3.0,These are much thicker than I thought and kind of uncomfortable
3.0,Love the product took a long time to get
3.0,A heavier weight fabric than I expected...I definitely prefer a thinner sock for warm weather running.
3.0,I ordered an XS and they were huge. Other than that the material is high quality and the colors are right on.
3.0,"Unless you are a jeweler, a surgeon, or a bomb tech, do not buy this. Carefully dissecting tiny springs that launch across the room and bending and unbending tiny metal tabs and using tweezers to do all this make it not worth it. Also the black should be matte like the watch body, not semi gloss. Not worth $80. I’d say pass due to headache and overpriced."
3.0,"A little itchy but otherwise, a decent bra."
3.0,The length and cut is super cute however lint sticks to this so badly. No matter what I’ve done or how I’ve washed it.
3.0,"This is a really cute “dress,” except as a dress, it doesn’t really cut it, imo. But pull it down and wrap the “top” over half-way to the inside, and you’ve got an awesome skirt. Colorful, swirly, and way too much fun. A big hit with a twenty-something young lady.<br /><br />Donate to your favorite charity by using Amazon Smile (smile.amazon.com) when you order.

3.0,"This skirt is very cool, unfortunately it did not fit me well.  I am on the short side 5'4&#34;<br />I liked the quality and the fringe was not tangled.<br />I definitely recommend for someone on the taller side."
3.0,"These shorts are fairly comfortable, though are a bit thicker than I like."
3.0,"Beautiful fabric, soft to the skin, length is good for me.  I am tall 5'11&#34;. Will definitely order again, just a size smaller."
3.0,"The dress fit well, but the ruffles were not in a good place for my size/chest.  I thought theyd be more to the sides,  but they stuck out in area where i didnt want extra attention.  If the dress didnt have ruffles (part of why i I liked the dress) it would have been a keeper."
3.0,Pretty but doesn’t have AB stones as pictured.
3.0,Was too small for what was ordered.
3.0,Gold plating arrived with a few bubbles in the coating. Otherwise ok for the price.
3.0,These are nice but they look cheep sure not like the picture
3.0,Not good for workouts.  It’s cotton and the fit is wrong
3.0,"I love the look and style of this watch. It goes well with a professional or a casual look. The reason why I gave it three stars is because I find the band to be quite uncomfortable. Even though I have worn it many times, the band doesn't bend right. The straps want to stay flat, which makes the face pop up a bit. I thought eventually the straps would adjust, but they haven't. It really irritates the sides of my wrist. I have tried bending the straps but it hasn't done much but cause some visual creases, but not enough to make it less irritating to wear. It's disappointing because I do really like the look of the watch."
3.0,Christmas gift. Concerned it may be too large.
3.0,"I like this necklace very much but when I took it out of the package, the top chain broke right at the clasp. Luckily I have some crimping beads and jeweler's pliers. I fixed it myself."
3.0,"Good product, suggest longer  length."
3.0,"Item was shipped as promised - I bought this for my daughter.  After one trip to the mall, the handle broke off.  Not happy about that."
3.0,"Cute dress and fits perfect on me, but but very cheap fabric.  Would give it 5 stars if the fabric was better, also it won't fully iron.  Other than that the dress is nice looking.  I'm afraid to wash it too being that I read reviews saying it will make the fabric look even worse."
3.0,"This dress is so cute!  Super soft and fresh feeling.  I am size 8 and bought Med.  The bust and rib area is very tight, and the waistline is so high that it almost is empire.  It's not flattering, because if you have any tummy at all it makes you look pregnant.  Too bad because it's adorable, and the tie die is trendy."
3.0,It is a very cute shirt but sad it emphasizes my belly. I wear a medium and am 5'4 and 165 lbs... I got a 2x based on reviews and was sad it hugged my belly... the part I don't like showing. I got the shirt to wear with yoga pants but after trying it on... I will only wear with shorts because the shorts will hide my gut more.
3.0,"Super comfortable, but mine had a 3 inch hole below a pocket, a handful of unfinished threads and had stitching. I ended up fixing it myself because it is cozy."
3.0,"The hat is nice, But the size will not fit someone with a smaller head."
3.0,Not the best fabric however the visual effect is quite nice.
3.0,Adorable and great quality did fit a little small however
3.0,Shirt very soft hope the screen print does not peal off.
3.0,Smaller than expected. Does not hold a binder along with other school material.<br /><br />Material is durable and is significantly better crafted than the satchel purchased last year.
3.0,"Size runs small - definitely order up. This is a pretty dress, but by no means is it elegant!  The material is a heavy cotton - that is not elegant. Nice to wear to church or out to dinner, but not to a formal affair. Customer service was very good!"
3.0,This dress is see thru
3.0,"The hats are as I expected, however, no real of hanging wire was enclosed as indicated on the order."
3.0,"The shirt shrunk after washing , pants fit fine"
3.0,"Very soft and cute. Does run a little small. It’s almost too short in the arms. I’m 5’8, 160 lbs. fits great every where else. Does leave a red stain on clothes you wear underneath."
3.0,"did not fit well, I had to wear it backwards"
3.0,Didn’t arrive but cute
3.0,These are really nice shirts but make sure you read the description. They are NOT US sizes. I bought 2 4X’s and they look like a cross between a med and large. Very disappointed cause they are nice shirts. They just run incredibly small. Just a heads up.
3.0,I wish they offered wide widths.
3.0,skirt to big
3.0,"I'm 5 ft. 2, so I bought the petite, but it was a strange fit with the pockets too high. It's great, but I wish I'd gone with the regular."
3.0,"I suspect this mig.ht be a girls watch, not a bad watch but feels pretty girly to wear"
3.0,"Runs small, especially around the arms. The material is not what I expected. I should had returned it when I had time. The dress is in my closet and never worn out of the house..."
3.0,I bought these for my elephant-loving daughter. They were a beautiful deep blue color. She wore them one night and when she woke up the next day the blue had faded. It has faded a little more each time she wears them. The elephant pattern is great.
3.0,"i remember this clock when i was young<br />nice item<br />small<br />the set up is still that same, 25 years ago<br />remember a lot things<br />no have extra battery<br />no have tools to change battery<br />but got the stand to hold it"
3.0,????????
3.0,This shirt runs small. The struggle was real getting it on.
3.0,not quite sure yet if I like it. quite constricting on the calves for running.
3.0,"LOVE the finish of both the gold and silver. The clip ons themselves are comfortable and I can wear them for hours. However, they are tiny compared to the picture advertised! I set my watch next to them for a size comparison."
3.0,Very cheap quality but worked great for family pictures.
3.0,"I usually wear a size 8 (medium) in women's clothing, and for chef's coats, I wear a small (unisex) or medium (women's).  Based on others' feedback of this coat, I followed the sizing guide and purchased this coat in a U.S. woman's large and was afraid it might even be too small (the sizing guide actually recommended an XL, but that was not available).  I just tried it on, and the body is huge!  I could easily grab an extra 4 inches of material in the back when I tried to see what it might look like tailored.  The shoulders and sleeve circumference fit me perfectly, but the sleeve length was pretty short.  I am 5'8&#34; and usually don't have trouble with sleeve length, so that was disappointing.  The color was very pretty, and I liked the design and the easy closure on the front panel (no buttons - just snaps).  I'm returning this coat and will order a smaller size, but I am concerned about others' comments that it shrinks when washed.  I just doubt that the large size will shrink in exactly the places I need it, so I'm going to try my luck with a smaller size first."
3.0,The colors of the mask are awesome and I love the vibrancy and styles.  But they are huge. It covers most of my face and goes way under my chin to my neck which is a bit much to me I have to fold it under some.
3.0,The shirt is paper thin and very snug. I ordered the size large and it fits snug. I normally wear a medium.
3.0,"I like the shirt it's comfy but I don't like the way it fits, but that's just me. I use it for a pj top to sleep in."
3.0,The length of these shorts was too short for me! I returned them.
3.0,The color of the tie is much darker than the picture shows. It is a lovely tie but not the color I wanted.
3.0,"As beautiful in person as online; however I thought it had sections on the bottom that each stretched. The top & bottom are each one piece with nylon line connecting them. Makes it extremely difficult to put on yourself, since there is little &#34;stretch&#34;. Should have been made as a hinged bangle. I'm keeping it only because I have jewelry experience & will make it into a hinged bangle. Also because it really is beautiful. In addition, the plated areas need to be clear coated so they don't turn your wrist black."
3.0,Wig fell apart
3.0,The green isn't green like the photo it's brown but altogether rest are nice.
3.0,"I ordered the legging and the long sleeve top. the long sleeve top was a perfect fit, great quality! however the leggings didn't fit well. I am 5.5 120lbs ordered the XS because i have a very skinny waist. the waist is too high and tight that it creates a a small belly under the waist band. retuned it."
3.0,This earring fit my cartridge perfectly however I cannot close the clasp because it’s just slightly bent I’ve tried so many times and even tried wearing it without closing it but it’s useless. I didn’t return it because I put it in my ear and thought that would be gross but a working replacement would have been nice.
3.0,"Calling these leggings is a stretch (no pun intended).  They are opaque, a bit thin and should be called footless tights.  I am keeping them - can wear them under jeans or really long tunics but would not order again or in other colors."
3.0,"I followed the size chart and I should have gone a size up. The top is so tight I need help getting it off. I’m 130 lbs, 5’3 and typically wear a M-L — but the large was too small for me. Fit more like a S-M"
3.0,"I bought the XXL size hoping it would fit, but it’s just too tight. The rest of the dress fit wonderfully but I felt like one sneeze and I’d rip the dress wide open."
3.0,"This shirt runs small, order 1 to 2 sizes up. Overall it's adorable and comfortable and lightweight, stylish too. You'll need an undershirt or a sheer/nude bra."
3.0,The wallet was too small for my preference.
3.0,"Love the gloves, soft, warm and cute but the touch fingers don’t work."
3.0,These are comfortable. Love the pockets and colors. The waist unfortunately slides down and these aren’t as firm fitting as I would like. I will use for lounging but not for walking or exercise.
3.0,"Thick and warm, but I took off a star because the workmanship is not as fine as it looks in the photo, and another because of the oily &#34;factory&#34; smell. .. Add the price of &#34;dry cleaning' to it's cost."
3.0,"The mask material itself is good rubber and the detail is great. However, the eye holes were way uneven. I had to reshape them with some scissors to get even symmetry. I have a small head so I had to fold and tape the back to get a snug fit on my face. It works for what I need."
3.0,"Es un buen material,  para clima frio, antiadherente,  pero es muy ancho, y largo lo hice perfeccionar en la costurera"
3.0,"Ugh! When I first tried them, I got dizzy--the adjustment from bifocals to progressive lenses was most difficult when walking and moving about. Now, I've had them two days and find the high magnification area at the bottom of the lenses isn't adequate for typing on the computer. The focus isn't good, or the area is too small; I'm not sure which, but I've switched back to bifocals for writing...and will use these evenings when viewing video or doing digital puzzles for relaxation, but not for work. Disappointed."
3.0,"It's a cute cover up, very soft material.  However, it has snaps on both sides, neither of the snaps actually snap closed so it just hangs open."
3.0,"cups are small, size up"
3.0,"Loops ripped out before the dress was even laced up all the way, the first time the dress was tried on. Nice quality otherwise, but it still cannot be worn, even one time, without repair. Very disappointing, we were going to buy several for a wedding."
3.0,not the colour pictured
3.0,"not the best belt I have purchased but it does the job. The leather looks cheap, not very leather like. It's good with jeans but I don't think it will last long."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this a lot, however, I have sensitive skin on my wrists and I ended up with a rash every time I would wear it for a period of time. Also, I found that putting the fitbit in the watch was not as easy as some other watch bands. It didn't ""pop"" in like others and requires some force, however, then it still doesn't feel entirely secure in the watch. It was very attractive and the links were simple to remove to adjust the size to fit."
3.0,Little short n small
3.0,Clinton was too small usually fine
3.0,"It’s a very cute shirt. Very soft material. Runs very large. The sizing chart is way off. I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I would normally order, going off the sizing chart provided. In reality I should have just order my normal size."
3.0,I like the pockets.
3.0,"They are the closest dupe to the real YSL’s as I ordered some from other sellers, HOWEVER, they smell extremely strong like chemicals or paint thinner. Not like a new product smell but like I said a really strong chemical smell. I have had them sitting out on my coffee table the last 9 day’s and they still smell so strong that it’s hard to even wear them. I’m going to try and wash them with soap and water although I don’t think that will make much of a difference. If it doesn’t, I will end up returning."
3.0,there does not seem to be enough room  in the toe area.  I am a 9.5 in length with pretty narrow feet.  There is not enough height to the toe area toes feel a little smashed.  Ok if I wear without socks but I would prefer to wear socks.  I am sure the will stretch and give with some use.
3.0,I like the color black best  and the style I needed was plain  the price was not expensive and the page we're easy to read I enjoy shopping online with Amazon apparel's
3.0,Ran smaller than described but will just be using it while taking my walks at night.
3.0,I was so sad this didn't fit. Size runs so small.
3.0,"I had a much more expensive crystal bracelet (should have never let my grand baby play with it) that i was trying to replace, but i can't help comparing the 2.  So, it's cheap looking compared to the one I got on sale for about $50.  The crystals are too far apart and the bracele'ts a little big, too 'one size fits all'.  But for the money, it's a fair purchase."
3.0,Work well except for dye problem.
3.0,tight through the chest. I am only a flabby c cup and struggled pushing them puppies in there.  do not get if busty. cute dress though. nice material. not very much give in the material.
3.0,"Adorable shoes, appear to be well made, but WAY oversized compared to normal. My daughter wears a 3 in normal youth shoes and the 2.5 in this shoe is incredibly large for her... she won't be able to walk in them without tripping. we will need to return. But I don't see ANY of the Hot CHocolate children's shoes in size 2... that's odd. They all skip from 1.5 to 2.5 :("
3.0,The opening on the arms is HUGE!  I wouldn't wear it without a jacket or cover up of some sort.
3.0,"It's cute but I got a large so it would be a bit baggy. I am usually medium and it fits like a medium. Also no tag so it's difficult to distinguish front from back. But, whatever it's cute."
3.0,Ok for the price but the ear pieces are quite tight and if I wear them more than about an hour I have a migraine.
3.0,"Too long, but I'm only 5'1&#34; so it just went to an awkward place past my knees."
3.0,"Very pretty! But the title is deceiving. Has cotton in the title, so this product came up in my search for cotton masks. Alas, it is 100% polyester. Anyone with allergies must be aware."
3.0,"purchased 14-Tall/Long:  My favorite jeans were discontinued a few years ago (Claiborne original) -- and I have been searching in vain for replacement jeans that fit gals with a straight figure (less than a 10"" difference between the waist and hips -- and I think most women fall into that category).  I wasn't curvy as a size 6 and I'm not curvy as a size 12-Tall.<br /><br />So Gloria V's jeans:  I hate a tight waist, so I size up to the 14 so that when it shrinks, it still fits.  Sometimes the waist shrinks more on some pairs than others.  Sometimes the waist is a different size before washing.  Any GV 14 pair that fits my waist perfectly after washing, has the downside of getting super baggy in the legs and tush after a few hours.  I have one pair that literally will fall down to mid-hip by the end on the day (thank goodness it's only the one pair out of the many others I have bought).  I have some Amanda's size 12's with a too tight waist, but since they fit great everywhere else, I leave them unbuttoned.<br /><br />It's not just Gloria V -- it is almost all jeans makers that think we all are curvy waisted."
3.0,Did not understand that product was made from Polyester
3.0,"These earrings are so cute! But I was disappointed because one was missing a gem, I hadn’t worn them or anything, this was literally sent to me with one missing. Luckily it was towards the bottom so it’s not very noticeable, but it makes me question the durability of these earrings."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt in the purple color and I love it, but it developed a hole at one of the seams after two washings. Not great quality."
3.0,These are the perfect size! But because they're not exactly l shaped(more wide open) it looks like you have a lil booger in your nose. But besides that they're great
3.0,I did like the short however the legs were a bit wider than expected.
3.0,Son was happy but broke after wearing the necklace twice
3.0,"These ear muffs are adorable! Not the greatest quality but for the price, I wasn't surprised the fir came unsewn. It was in the seam between the band and the ear so easy to fix"
3.0,"Like the fit but first washing they got fuzzy. Like I had washed them a lot. Hung up to dry, no dryer."
3.0,"i LOVEEEE this skirt it’s so cute, however it was unfortunately on the shorter side :( despite that, super cute"
3.0,"It's a cute idea but it doesn't fit adult heads, the face veil hardly reached my eyebrows let alone covered my head from the headband itself :("
3.0,Very pretty but broke almost right away
3.0,"Overall I like this watch. I wanted to love it, but I'm disappointed with the durability of the black PVD coating.<br /><br />The watch looks great. It's unique and I've received several compliments. My problem is the band is easily scratched and is showing wear after only a week of daily use."
3.0,Kinda cheap for the price.
3.0,Material very thin. Run large.
3.0,Suit.is wonderful just alittle small. Not true to size
3.0,The size was perfect my complaint comes in with the material I actually really like this material but when I put the dress on and make me feel like a Halloween costume it just didn't feel like an everyday dress or should I say it every weekend dress
3.0,Thought it was better
3.0,"I have large square glasses.  These cases are too big for them.  I bought it because it said, ""Eyewear Eyeglasses Case"" in the description.  If my glasses shake and bang around in there, I can't imagine what works in these other than some gigantic sunglasses.  So, these are more for giant sunglasses or generally anything you might want to have a zip case for.  For that, it's useful.<br /><br />I returned mine.  They are nice looking for someone looking for a large case.  They seem well-made.  The light zipper looks like it might break in about 2-3 years.  But, you never know... this does seem like quality."
3.0,Distorted proportions - large bottom - short legs - overpriced!  Glad for Amazon's return policy!
3.0,It said XL but it was smaller
3.0,"Reviewed as a 3star because although the dress was beautiful and well made, it was not true to size, at all. I ordered the 10-11 years old, for my smaller/average sized 8 year old daughter, and it was definitely too tight."
3.0,Colour is as shown but cannot go out in cold weather depending on it as it not fitting and coming off  almost immediately!
3.0,"While this The GLD Shop 5MM Miami Cuban Choker Necklace 12""-14"" Adjustable Length- Gold is a nice chain while it lasts I believe it is a little over priced for the lack of time before it started to turn tarnished."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:ff52e635f0b8382880e5ab951f08dfbe]] Comfy great material just gave me wrong size but I liked the baggy fit so I kept them. I ordered a medium but got an extra large
3.0,The necklaces are very cute. I thought it was one necklace that appeared to be 2. But it's 2 separate necklaces. Which I think my daughter might like more! Overall good quality from what I can tell.<br /><br />Update: both necklaces broke within a week she wore them maybe 4x in that week
3.0,A little tight on my 5 year old. He snapped the first band trying to adjust it in the arm.
3.0,They are good but I find it stretches too much.
3.0,"These sunglasses are OKAY for the price. The little nose pieces in my opinion do a terrible job keeping them on my face. I constantly have to slide them up my nose, which means I never wear them."
3.0,Seems a little deceptive to have the ears up in the picture. They don’t stand up at all. It would be helpful if there was a string so you could tie it on. For the price it isn’t really worth it
3.0,Mine isn’t a 3 part zip. Only two. The color is way off. It’s like a brownish pink rather than a light pink. I like it. But really wish it was the color I wanted. And wish it was 3 zip sections.
3.0,I like the socks but they seem to be a little larger than I need. I wear a 9.5 shoe size so I ordered a large. I should have ordered a medium.
3.0,"These do not look oxidized, they were shiny. Much smaller than they looked in the picture, you can barely see the tiny filigree detail."
3.0,"I was so disappointed when I received this bag.  The quality was fine but the bag was so small.  The zipper was weird and almost pointless.  I was looking forward to this dupe since their were so many good reviews.  Not keeping, cute if you want a TINY tote not a medium size tote."
3.0,They are ok. Fit is adequate. They don't go over my glasses really well.  I can live with it. The plastic seems a little weak. Tint is slight darker than I think is good. Over they are decent. Worth the money.
3.0,"I thought they would look as expensive in reality as they do on the website but I was a bit disappointed. The are very long weight which is good ... No one wants their ear lobes weighed down by heavy earrings. The gold strip a the bottom of 2 pair is on one side & to me that takes away from the ""look"" or value of the earring. They are ok overall but I won't purchase them again. I'll shoot for a nicer earring."
3.0,rolls down but managed to deal with it.
3.0,"This jacket looks excellent - vibrant colors, no loose threads, and the patches are sewn on nicely.  The sizing definitely runs small - I normally wear a Large (6'2&#34; tall x 200 lbs) but had to send that back and request an XL.  So why only three stars?  Hmm. Two reasons - first, the quality just isn't there. At $200 it's priced like a brand name mesh jacket but it doesn't feel nearly as thick or protective as a Joe Rocket or similar item. Second, the arm length is short. Admittedly, I have full-length monkey arms which make sizing tough on any clothing *sigh* but these ones are even shorter than usual.<br /><br />Since I'm no expert on wear resistance I can't say it won't hold up in a crash, but I wouldn't like to find out. It sure is pretty hanging in my closet, though!"
3.0,Very pretty but earrings wear a little heavy.
3.0,I gave it away. It works better then some but not the best.
3.0,"I got this shirt for my son as part of a costume of Carlos from the Descendants. The shirt is on the small side. It looked great when it came but it did pretty noticeably shrink in the wash and the material looks very wrinkly and worn after just one washing. Carlos has a worn look about him so the shirt was still fine as a part of a costume, although thankfully most of it is covered up with a jacket."
3.0,It is to small and I will be returning it
3.0,"It's taken me awhile to review but I got this dress awhile back and I can't even wear it. It's way too small even though I tried to order the largest size possible just in case it ran small. I'm a big girl (size 22) so I know that going up in size is needed but even this made me feel like I was freaking huge. To top it off, I didn't even get the right color. I ordered the blue/black & white dress but ended up receiving the Purple/Black & White one. Frankly, I've read that these dresses are hard to return and due to the low cost, I figured I might as well keep it and either I'll gift it to someone else or hope that I'll be able to make it work once I lose weight. Gave this three stars because if it had fit, I would've been happy. The dress isn't bad it just isn't what I was hoping for."
3.0,"This is a cute dress but the buttons were falling off after the 1st washing, not even worn yet. Its cute and fits well, but you should expect to sew in reinforcement of the button threading or the buttons will literally fall off on 1st wear/wash."
3.0,Was as described except it didn’t fit my 8yr olds head so I returned it.
3.0,"I love everything about these earrings, the shape, the weight, the gold trim however, the color is not as represented,  I ordered orange and received a pair that's color is closer to coral."
3.0,"The set is very thin. It also runs small. I wear size 14. For this item, i ordered 2X. The pants fit but the jacket was a little snug around my back and shoulders. I have to wear the jacket open to be comfortable. There is no lining so dont wear anything bright colored underneath. Its thin. U will be able to see it. I ordered the pink and yellow set. Type A"
3.0,"Tough to put on because the clasp in the back are in two sections.  The bottom section is really hard to reach and hard to put on.  I'm really flexible so if I struggle, I think most people would.  I love everything else about this bra though, once I have it on.  Just takes me several minutes to get it on."
3.0,"Fabric is cheap quality, but it looks all right."
3.0,it was much smaller than I expected - looked bigger in the picture
3.0,Nice looking but Shimano makes better breatheable fabrics.
3.0,"Works well, seem well constructed, and reasonably inexpensive.<br /><br />  Thought they are worth the money, I'm not sure they were worth the 6 week wait for<br />them to ship from China."
3.0,Cute but itchy on the side of my face.  That’s not really a problem with the earring but just the way they sit on my ears. And some of the material is peeling away on the multicolored ones.
3.0,"I wear a size 8 and they fit a lil snuge however huge emphasis on lil not painful , heel is nice and small so you won’t be in pain after a long wear ! Good for the price !"
3.0,"Quality of graphics is ridiculous and poor quality.  Its a cute shirt, but doesn't look as sharp as pictured here."
3.0,"Appear to be reasonably well made, but returning because they shipped the wrong size.  Ordered XL but received a pair of 2XLs. At 6'1"", 170', the 2XLs were snug, not baggy, but far from compression."
3.0,It fits WAAAAYYY tighter than I thought it would. Absorbs sweat well though
3.0,One of the socks came with a loose thread around the nexk. Not super thrilled.
3.0,we had the problem with the zipper fixed rather than return it as there were none available to replace it.
3.0,loose elastic and the red color faded onto the white
3.0,The red white and blue did not have adjustable straps
3.0,"I liked this eyeglass chain/lanyard. It was convenient and looked pretty. That said, it broke fairly easy. I was at the grocery store and I pulled my glasses down since it was on the chain. Then one side of the chain broke. I got almost a month's worth out of it and I have no regrets. I just wish it hadn't broke because it was very convenient to have."
3.0,It's simple but short. I will wear but leggings are a must.
3.0,"I like that the suitcase is lightweight and a spinner.  I like that it’s not black.  I bought it before the pandemic, then had to put it in the closet.  On my first trip post pandemic the suitcase was ripped.  I am so disappointed.  I should have purchased a cheaper bag."
3.0,"Not a horrible piece but definitely cheaply made.  Colored stone does not hang as shown in picture, hangs rather awkwardly.  Not bad for price it is but has that gumball machine trinket quality."
3.0,"When I had first gotten these I had some sizes missing while others were triplets of the same size. I've only gotten them to see how big I wanted to go, so I'm happy with my purchase."
3.0,"They actually look great on my butt, but they are SO incredibly thin that I’m convinced they’ll rip on the first wear. I ordered the green because it looked like a green/grey in the picture, but beware it’s more of a light month green. It’s still a cute color, but these are literally the thinnest material you’ll ever see. Not only will they rip, but they’re also see through. I’m returning just based on that."
3.0,"Daughter didn’t like it, we returned."
3.0,"I like that the bag has a lot of pockets, I only wish the straps were longer and they had additional colors."
3.0,Has a good color and the material feels very smooth and comfortable. It does get a little sloppy at the connection points. They snap on securely but the silicone nearest the to the watch is not very precisely cut. The silicone is cut larger than the watch's mold so it doesn't match up right. Ends up looking  cheap compared to the OEM bands. You get what you pay for here.
3.0,The dress arrived late and it was see through.
3.0,"Cute soft shirt that runs at least a size small. I wear an XL usually and that’s what I bought. It was TIGHT and short. I’m 5’9, 255lbs"
3.0,This band was not compatible with my Versa. The new band was minus the pins used to attach the band sides to the Fitbit. However: I would like to try another.
3.0,"Bigger chested ladies be ware! I wanted to love this dress, but despite listening to other reviewers and ordering a size up, it still didn't come close to covering my chest. For reference I'm 5'9 usually wear a L/XL top, size 14 pants and 36 D bra. I'm disappointed because it really is a beautiful and unique dress, just definitely not made for a curvier body type. Slim, smaller chested women would probably look great in it. I nabbed this for only $9.99, so I might keep it and find a camisole to wear under it rather than return."
3.0,"Not as big as i would have liked,made it wok barely useing space bags.."
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" and 215 pounds. This is what the shirt looks like on me.<br />It really bothers me when people dont give real reviews, it would have saved me from buying this shirt. It is super cute, fits great, perfect length. But as you can see in the picture, shows my bra strap. Which means if I keep it, I have to buy a beige bra. I'm still not sure if I will be keeping or returning. Just hope this review saves someone the hassle."
3.0,Good price and quality but run quite big and leg’s are a little baggy
3.0,"The arch support seems fine so far, however the insoles are so noisy. Every time I step my heels make a loud crunching sound."
3.0,Runs small on top and arms and about 3 inches too long. Will have to alter
3.0,Love the colors  just too small to get over my breast size D  cup . Gave to my daughter  size B cup fit here fine . She wears small to medium on tops . I wear large on tops .
3.0,"So you get what you pay for and overall it's not as bad as some people have said it is. I did want to say that some people were saying that the vent is not safe when around other people cause it doesn't have a filter, well that's not true and I wish more people had common sense. So my filters came with a little filter piece you push out to put the vents through, well take that little piece and put it in the bottom of the vent piece that goes on the outside of the mask and now it has a filter and works the same way."
3.0,"Pin is nice with good color but small. should be twice the size and that takes a lot away from it. also due to it,s size which makes it a bit too much money."
3.0,Love it except it's not really warm enough. More like a late winter outfit
3.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 132lbs. Hourglass shape. Bottoms fit okay; a little loose in the torso for a medium on me and there's no padding anywhere. It's soft but flimsy. The stretchy top provides zero support for my size 36D chest. It's very slippery and my boobs just flop in it. I can't wear the top but I can use the bottoms with something else and maybe use the top as a headdress to make it all match. Also the design is pretty on point but the colors are more faded than shown they obviously upped the contrast for advertisement."
3.0,Not all masks came with adjustable ear lopes. The ones without adjuster were about 2 inches shorter then the other set. They are so small in order to use I will have to replace the elastic.
3.0,Love the look it  fits nice the material is soft
3.0,"The coat is fuzzy and cozy and if one were wearing skinny jeans it would probably be darling. For me, a lover of these fuzzy, teddy bear style jackets, it looked and felt too much like a bulky bathrobe. I pondered over whether to use it as a robe or return it... I returned it!"
3.0,"For the price, I was very impressed with the quality of the material. I ordered two different suits because the first one I ordered was too small. The second one was then too big in the chest. Maybe it's the way I'm proportioned. Otherwise it was a nice suit for a great price."
3.0,"Very pretty, but really poor stitching. Fabric is super thin, which is nice for the summertime, but you definitely have to wear a thong with this or go commando because you WILL see everything.<br />Wore it once around the house to see how I liked it and the seams started to fall apart.<br />I returned it."
3.0,If you aren’t into name brand this is for you. I needed a Jagdtasche (hunter’s bag) for bird hunting. This fit the bill and the price tag.
3.0,"Super cute print! The style and fit of the dress is great! The only complaint, colors do run after washing. It is still wearable, but the print consistency is noticeably compromised by color streaks. This dress still makes one little girl very happy!"
3.0,this is very hard to get a credit card out of the pockets
3.0,Was a little lighter weight than I thought it would be but I love the color!
3.0,Arrived early.  Not oversized as I hoped; wanted large frames.
3.0,These are all made for skinny folks.<br />The largest size is a medium (us)  at best.
3.0,The green is not an emerald/jewel green as pictured (at least what is pictured from my phone). It’s more of an earth tone green with grey undertones so not nearly as vibrant as I wanted.
3.0,They look good but that is about all. I tried them for 3 months.
3.0,I ordered this for my son and ordered him a size up just incase because I would rather it be a little big than have it be to small on him and the size up was still very small....he never was able to wear it unfortunately because the legs kept riding up because it was just to small....I ordered the 12-18 months and I would say that would fit a baby 6-9 months. The material was thin which was nice and super stretchy which is also a plus so your little 1 can move around comfortably but it runs very very small so if you do order this make sure u order it atleast 2 sizes bigger than what you usually buy. Overall it's really cute!
3.0,This is not good. I have similar shirts with softer fabric and wrinkle free.
3.0,I received these and the sequins were coming off before I got them on my feet.
3.0,"Liked material, fit and overall look a lot but the v neck was too deep and I normally don’t mind or can stitch it an inch to give coverage but can’t with the neck cut on this one - I would have to wear a bandeau top under or be ok showing a lot. I’m a smaller chest (34B) and it’s just too low for me but otherwise was adorable. Red is pretty! Hated to return."
3.0,"I love the shoe itself as I have had a few pair from JCrew that were wooden; however, these run a bit small so get a half size larger.  Also, the black is difficult to tell it's black but it would not be enough brown to wear with Navy clothing.  I think I can get a pad that will help with the sizing but the shoe is not a favorite."
3.0,"You get what you pay for-- I love the look of the watch, however when I received it, it was much lighter than I expected. The materials seem cheap and the watch overall does not feel well made."
3.0,I didn't think that it would be so heavy and big. I wanted to wear it on my name badge at work but just didn't work out. P.s. it didn't protect me from evil energy.
3.0,"The small was way to big. I am 115 lb, 5'3&#34;. But they had really good customer service."
3.0,it was a little to big for me.
3.0,"Well...The bag was actually white with silver on the raised areas of the texture, if that makes sense, I thought it was solid silver. I will keep it as a work bag...BUT not what I expected."
3.0,Very difficult to put on even in the largest size.  They also slide down after walking in them for a short distance
3.0,The dress looked exactly as advertised.
3.0,"I ordered the green socks and while they’re comfortable, they’re not like pictured. They’re darker and more of a forest green than in the picture. Also when they’re on your ankle/ leg they stretch and white elastic shows through looking like a white and green striped sock."
3.0,"Runs a little small, or at least mine did."
3.0,The zippers ravel within a week of use.
3.0,Purchased these at target. Way smaller esp in the shirt than expected. But material is nice.
3.0,"The design is very cute, but the style not so much. Its huge on me, I am 5 ft tall at 150lbs. It's also long on me, goes way past my butt. I might try to find a way to shorten it & make it smaller somehow. At least it wasn't expensive & with a little tweaking I think I can make it better."
3.0,"Bought these for my daughter to wear under dresses and they are really perfect for that application.  However, other pairs of bike shorts she has double as short under longer tees.  These don't do the double-duty because the waistband is made like underwear.  Also, they are a little thinner / silkier than the bike shorts we've been buying.<br />I would highly recommend these for leggings under dresses."
3.0,If you have semi thick nose this is not good. Where the gem is doesn't allow the rimg to go through the nose all the way.
3.0,"It was really pretty, but I ordered 2 sizes up and it still didn't fit. I kept it and gave it away as a gift to someone one size smaller than me and it looked great on her. Really a bummer."
3.0,"These earrings do not look the way they are depicted here. More silver than marcasite. Loved the picture, the real thing falls quite short."
3.0,Nice shirt.  Nice material and color.  Runs very very small.  No way was this an XL>
3.0,"Much smaller than I expected. These are fairly  tight-fitting, and very thin material. I ordered large. I am 5’7 and 145 lbs. I look much like a sausage in a large, but I think an XL would have an odd fit do to the cut. For me, they are on the short side, but the arm holes are large, if that makes sense."
3.0,Charm was beautiful but clapse broke first time wearing it.  Now I have to buy another chain
3.0,Didn't fit as expected. I'm a 34 C and the cups were way too close together. It couldnt hold anything up and it let too much out the sides. Would recommend for flatter girls.
3.0,I was really excited to give this to my husband as a gift but was quickly disappointed. Poor image quality but considering it's for a mouse pad it will suffice.
3.0,Great for credit cards. Not great if you want your cash inside the case. I do not like my cash outside in the band where it can be lost.
3.0,Heavy piece but not really my thing
3.0,ok but bunchy on sides most likely a night gown not a dress.
3.0,Very Cute. But the chest area is a little exposed. Also smaller than expected! But everything would've been good if the chest area fit... I'm a 34B and I couldn't find a bra that would work and I couldn't go without cause the fit would've exposed everything.
3.0,"I’m not crazy about the fit of this dress. It kind of looks like a nightgown on a curvy shape like mine. The plates in the front would make it a great maternity item. It just doesn’t work for my shape except for over a swimsuit or to sleep in. Material is kind of cheap, But again good for a beach cover-up."
3.0,"The hat is fine, but the size itself is much larger than I expected"
3.0,"Adorable however, this is more of a novelty item vs something with longevity. Strapped popped within 24 hours at the time only mints and dollars were in it. Oh and chapstick and ID cards"
3.0,Cute outfit BUT it says the outfit must be DRY CLEANED!  WHO dry cleans clothes for an infant unless it's a baptism dress?  Not me!  May return....haven't decided yet.
3.0,"Looks different from the picture, material feels cheap"
3.0,I returned it. Fit loose and nice in the front but tighter than I preferred in back. I didn't find it comfortable. The return process was super easy.
3.0,There were no instructions on using the charms. I thought they would fit my bracelet. Very disappointed.
3.0,"the rings are really great . i loved them , but i didnt get a couple of them . some where way different than what i was supposed to get"
3.0,Material gets damaged easily.
3.0,They are really cute but tarnish within a week
3.0,The bear looks very strange in person cuz it's hat makes it look like it's missing a chunk of its face.
3.0,I disliked the quality of the product.
3.0,"These do not work well--as you are exercising they slide off --I use them to walk around the house now. Pilates no, yoga maybe?"
3.0,This product will pinch your skin a lot
3.0,Fit perfect right put of the pack but shrinks a lot when washed. Material is also on the thinner side.
3.0,"The hat is really nice looking but I thought the forehead of the cap would be firm as it looks on the photo, unfortunately it is not. Out of that everything with this cap is good, color, material and size is really good. I wish the forehead would be firm and keeping its good shape, then I'ld give 5star"
3.0,"There’s not really anything wrong with it. It was more snug than I wanted, and it definitely shows its price tag in the materials and craftsmanship. But who can really complain at such a low price tag. I did return it because it wasn’t for me."
3.0,They fit ok but we're a little short
3.0,Cute but not true to size runs small
3.0,"The right shoe was larger than the left (which fit perfect).  The base/sole is the same but the strap across the foot is noticeably larger.  It was my second try at the shoes, the first time I ordered and received the size I normally wear was huge so I returned.  I didn't want to go to the bother again. Otherwise they are very comfortable and just what I need for around the house."
3.0,cute but very short
3.0,I love hoyt hats usually but this one has a cardboard rim and a plastic mesh inside that made it look wierd on my head I had to cut it out but it looks and feels good now
3.0,"Cute dress but not for me.  The skirt part was stiff and I'm not used to that, I like swishy but it's a well made dress.  The fabric seemed to be on the heavy side which I thought odd for a dress but you definitely need to go at least two sizes larger than what you normally wear, at least two sizes."
3.0,"Fits just as I'd hoped. Only one pair, not 2 pairs as the title says. Very soft and high quality though."
3.0,"The outfit is definitely sexy as hell!!! I purchased it for my boyfriend’s bday party. I ordered the XL, it fits small in the bottom area, but I have a plump butt. The other issue is that the silver attachments fell off from the time I removed it from the package. Also, while I was wearing it they were popping off as well. But for a one time possibly 2 or 3 wearings, you’ll have gotten your money’s worth."
3.0,The marterial is thin. Whatever top you wear underneath needs to be made with a thin material aa well.
3.0,Cheap. Not good quality. My daughter loves Sailor Moon so she still likes them
3.0,Great looking!  But even for me!  Small wrist!  Don't fit!!!!!
3.0,"It’s cute, but very thin material and the sizing and cut are odd (it’s really boxy). I’ll keep it and hopefully she can fit into it next year for pics, but it’s not something I’d let her run around and play in...may fall apart."
3.0,"The dress is cute but there are lots of strings coming loose, it’s also kinda smaller than expected."
3.0,Love this dress. Fit is true to size. My only complaint is that is arrived with a rip at one of the seams.
3.0,When it arrived the material was a bit itchy and not very soft or comfortable. I washed it in cold water and dried on low and then it was much softer and comfortable. I like the shade of pink but I don’t really like the fit. Could look cute with the right outfit though I think!
3.0,This necklace is a nice length but very basic--  I'd much rather have a gold plate but they didn't offer it---I wish they faux diamonds showed up-- That would make it much nicer
3.0,its pretty but too small for the average woman.  I am 5'4 and weigh 140
3.0,Just ok...
3.0,"So I made the mistake of buying a large. It does run small from your typical size,  but they provide measurements, trust the measurement. If anything,  pay close attention to the waist measurements. That's what matters the most because the material does stretch,  so the hip area will stretch.<br /><br />Also the material, I can't find the word for it but everything I sit on,  ill slip off. And if I put things in my pockets,  it'll drag my pants down and I'll have to pull it up every second.  Also it's sheer so be careful what you wear underneath.<br /><br />But it has nice deep pockets ♡"
3.0,The socks are a good fit for my flats but the heel tends to slide off into my shoe. Uncomfortable.
3.0,Were tight around the lower part of ankle
3.0,"It’s cute, but I sent it back as you can get the same item from SHEIN directly for half price"
3.0,Fits well<br />Smells really bad
3.0,"This is an okay top for the price, unfortunately I had to return it because it was too small. The product photos make it seem as though there is some kind of stretch to the material but there is not at all. I couldn’t even get it on, so make sure you are taking that into consideration when buying. Otherwise it is a cute simple top, good length and material."
3.0,The jacket fit OK. I just don't like the  2 Zipper front
3.0,Shorts fit great. Top was way too small (short). I’m not the type to wear crop tops. I have 3 kids and a saggy belly lol
3.0,"cheap feeling, ok looking sun glasses. I use them for driving when I am on work travel and don't want to risk losing my good pair of glasses. They do the trick, but don't necessarily look super stylish or cool while doing it."
3.0,"Maybe I have a big head, I don't know, but the elastic in the bonnet (size L) was too tight. I used it one night, but I slept very little and awoke with a headache that lasted all the next day. Also, it didn't seem to do my wavy/curly hair any favors. The bonnets seemed well made for the price, but unfortunately I had to send them back."
3.0,"Looks great, but can't wash it will get destroyed."
3.0,Nice Belt  ...  but  the  advertised  42 will fit  40  is a misnomer  !!  maybe a 44 fits a 40  but My window returned by the time I opened the  package weeks later .....<br /><br />Any chance I can return for a 44 .....??<br /><br />Only opened the bag to try on once still in pristine condition  // never worn.. !!!
3.0,Runs wayyy too small. I wear a medium large and ordered a xl. Too small. Will need xxl and I'm a 28 jean
3.0,Great for a one time wear. Some of the edges under the hat could have been stetched better but great for a party. The adjustable plastic clasp worked well to fit large and small heads. I had the servers wear them along with train aprons I made for a dinner theatre event.
3.0,"I love this dress but it's way too short. I'm 5'8&#34;, 125 lbs, ordered a medium and it barely covers my thighs. If I had ordered a large it would've been too big and I don't know if it would be much longer. If you're over 5'3&#34; I wouldn't recommend it for everyday wear."
3.0,"I got these to match the cute top that seems to kinda go with them. The print does match, but the quality of the pants is much lower than the top and the material is totally different. These are so thin they really can't be worn out of the house if you want to be decent unless you're wearing a really long tunic or dress. I'm kinda disappointed that they are such a poor match to the top that seems like it should match. I wear a size 16/18 and bought the 2xl in these, they fit fine, but the already thin fabric is stretched so thinin the thigh and butt area that they just can't be worn anywhere. I'm using then as pajama pants."
3.0,Runs quite small and not stretchy material.
3.0,"I love the print and the color! The torso and hip area fit well, not too tight or loose, which is a great for me because I do have wide hips and a fuller waist. However, the bust was way too big for me. I am in between a B and C cup, and the bust for the XXXL(12-14) was more like a full D cup. I am going to reorder in the next size down and see if it will fit me better in the bust area."
3.0,A little too large in the width in the front
3.0,Beautiful color.  Didn't fit me well likely because I'm a petite.  It fit my taller sister so the blouse is now hers.
3.0,These were ok. I expect something different I guess.
3.0,Just not a good fit
3.0,"At first, I really didn't like it, but it's grown on me. The material is a bit stiff and the inside is kind of like that inside of a bathing suit - at least, that's what it reminds me of when I feel it or see it. I bought a large and it fits me perfectly (though typically I get a medium in sports bras so these run small comparatively, but true to the size chart provided). It mostly keeps everything in place for the works. I do have to adjust it now and then, but I'm not surprised by that based upon the material. All in all, for the super low price I paid, it was worth it."
3.0,"It's ok, I swear a little. Not too much sweating."
3.0,"I wanted something soft and cozy and sized the largest in hopes for something loose. It's def soft and cozy. But fef runs small. I'm normally a side L/XL which would be 12/14 usually in size. And I got the size 18. It fits like a size 12. I'm still gonna wear it cause it feels nice, but wish it wasn't so tight to the body."
3.0,Great jewelry.  Although i was under the impression it would be an assortment.  I only received curved belly button bars.
3.0,"Breaks easily, beside that it’s a great suit"
3.0,"It did came as a pic but it was damaged. Also, it doesnot look good on my figure ( I am medium)."
3.0,very disappointed. picture looked better than the actual bracelet. if it wasn't so cheap I would definitely have returned it.
3.0,It was not a very flattering fit. Not sure if it's because of how it was made or if it's just me.
3.0,Gives a false sense of security and strong workmanship.  Closing clasp rivet lasted ten days.  Leather loses its integrity.  Way too thick....probably a personal preference thing.  Trayvax strikes me as a fair outfit and for this i did not rate this as one-star!!
3.0,I received many compliments on this dress.  I bought this for my Sister's wedding.  It fit great I wear 2x in US and it fit with room to spare.<br /><br />I give this 3 stars because the picture is deceiving in the fact that you need to wear a strapless bra to cover the shoulders.  It was bit big in the underarms.  If you are attending an outdoor event the lace will grab everything from loose grass to sticks.  I will not be able to wear this again due to the fact that the lace is destroyed on the bottom.
3.0,"This truly is a full “real” costume, but it is HUGE. Over a foot too long. I followed the sizing instructions, but it was also at least two sizes too big beyond the excessive length. Good quality fabric (heavy!), although the sleeves are a lighter color than the rest of the dress, which is a bit odd. I returned because it would have required substantive alterations, which just wasn’t worth it to me."
3.0,"Material is thin, about what you exspect for the price"
3.0,"I've only wore it once and it is OK.  We have not had much rain in California lately, but these duck boots looks really sharp.<br /><br />Cliff"
3.0,"My head circumference, measured exactly as milliners recommend, is 22.5"", corresponding to U.S. hat size of 7-1/8.  I have thin, straight hair, so almost no added bulk there.<br /><br />This hat, while really cute, lightweight, and with a perfect brim width, is described by the seller as ""head circumference of this bucket hats unisex is 21.6-24.5in"".<br /><br />After adjusting it to max circumference, I can barely get it on my head, and it is quite tight, enough to give me a headache.<br /><br />It's a perfectly nice hat, just made for small to small-medium head size."
3.0,sizes from else where are very different then they used to be ;(
3.0,Too loose for me
3.0,"This is a beautiful sweater. It's a very pretty pink and sooo soft. Unfortunately, while I thought I was getting a large, I got a small which is definitely too small for me. My mom tried this on and it fit her pretty well ither than it could have been a little longer. (I know she can wear smalls, I'm just not sure if she normally wears smalls or mediums.) I'm a 34DD and she's much more smaller chested than I am. I can't really say anything more other than I wish I had gotten the right size because it's such a beautiful sweater. 😭"
3.0,Pretty but I thought the would be bigger
3.0,"This is the 2nd one I purchased that does kit look anything like the color advertised. Apricot was not and bright as the picture and the beige is actually white.. Although it is very comfortable, you are advertising false colors.  So DISAPPOINTED!"
3.0,Well designed but flimsy
3.0,"I thought I would like the adjustable strap, but I found it uncomfortable. Cute, but wouldn't order again."
3.0,It was too creamie to match my white boots but a very nice coat!
3.0,The waist is cut a little small but that will give a reminder to work more on the core other wise love the fit it is a true maxie
3.0,"Nice hat, but I woudl not consider this very low profile as it is described."
3.0,Fit good but cleaned with glass cleaner and the tint wiped right off .
3.0,"This is very small. Its for a 4 years old gilr. Very good fabric, that is good, the color the same that amazon shows"
3.0,Didn’t work well as a tennis skirt. Maybe it was too large and it was a struggle to store a ball in skirt
3.0,These are good compression shorts and really good for exercising. The first time I put them on the stitching broke that holds the elastic making it raunch. Other than that the rest of the stitching seems to be good.  Another thing...the raunch isn't that great but can't really expect it to be considering they're compression shorts.
3.0,I ordered this in an XL and are 5’6 and weigh 171. I could’ve ordered a L for the back was gaping. I returned the dress because I ordered it in white and the whole top is see through.
3.0,"Expected better for the price . Good build , but too tiny even for women ."
3.0,very cute but it's top heavy- it's always upside down. Some heavier feet on the chair would make it better
3.0,"The only down side of the belt is that it runs small.  I wear a 34 pants and so I purchased a 36 belt, as you normally do.  The belt fits like it is a 35 vs a 36."
3.0,For reference on a dress size 16/18 and a 42D and I just really was not impressed with this dress. I feel that it ran a little bit too small and did not hang on me like it shows on the model. I get that the model and I have different body types but it’s quite clear that it’s a little bit bigger on her than it was on me and my own size.<br /><br />The material I also found to be thinner than I had hoped. If you choose to get this maybe going up a size would be a good idea and you would definitely want to wear tights with that and maybe a tank top or a Cami or some thing up underneath.<br /><br />As far as washing it I have wash it on cold and hang dry it or tumble dry low.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
3.0,"Very, very thin material. A couple of pairs already had runs in them."
3.0,"I got this for a graduation present because I love the sentiment. I was surprised and disappointed at how lightweight and fragile it is. In fact, as the recipient was placing this on her existing key ring, the round inscription tag fell off because the bail was loose. It was able to be fixed, but I just expect a key chain to be more sturdy so that it lasts."
3.0,Not as warm as I imagined they would be.
3.0,It's OK...will work with leggings as intended.
3.0,"Very nice quality and good looking glasses. However, they are more for children at the age of 56 or seven rather than toddlers."
3.0,Very cheap material so wont last long.
3.0,Still not sure how to install them. Glue?
3.0,"I did not realize trunks are shorter than boxer briefs. I really like the LUK boxer briefs but the LUK trunks are too short. Also, they run large so they don't fit properly."
3.0,This is comfy but not something I would wear out side of my house. Works well as nightwear.
3.0,It was beautifully made but too long and unflattering.  The material was fragile. Returned.
3.0,This product is cute but I was expecting it to be larger. That is my only disappointment about it
3.0,"I like the style and fit. However, I was disappointed when after the first time wearing them I realized there was a hole in the front pocket. The hole is bigger with each wash because I haven’t been able to repair them. Just disappointing when you spend money on clothing and it immediately starts falling apart."
3.0,"I get that it’s compression, but it was seriously too tight"
3.0,Product as shown but the pin broke after two weeks
3.0,I love my dog who’s a lab. I thought it would be nice to wear a cap stating as such. I had hoped all would have been embroidered instead of stick on or iron on.
3.0,Very small and cheap....pin is very flimsy
3.0,"Wood chip spur, rough finished. Request replacement with exact same item, as advertised and described, from Amazon from whom I placed and received the ordered item, or directly from the seller."
3.0,"It's an o.k bra, just doesn't fit me well.  The cup size is smaller than it should be; felt more like a b cup than a c and the I had to undo the straps almost too the bottom.  Also the little tiny front clip is really not easy to use or I need to have my close up glasses on to see where it gets put back in.  Otherwise, it's a nice regular bra, if it fits you."
3.0,I ordered gray and received white.  It was also a lot shorter than shown.xsh
3.0,Good looking and fit well. But I'm taken aback at how much we'll pay for a piece of lightweight plastic. They claim to be ANSI Z87.1 impact resistant but are not marked as such. So their impact protection is a question.
3.0,"Works like it is suppose to,  but is very uncomfortable."
3.0,"It took over a month to receive necklass & Pendant on chain was much bigger than expected but my daughter said she liked it. I reckon after the initial shock of the expected delivery date and the fact that the company would not cancel my order only 15 minutes after I had ordered it, I suppose it was worth what I paid."
3.0,"Metal frame so they're heavy, but look good"
3.0,Simple and cute. Hard to put on so I figured they’d be safe and secure but I lost one the first day. Disappointed.
3.0,Seems well made. Didn’t come with the wallet like in the description.
3.0,Very slippery ! My daughter kept falling so many times that I stopped putting those on her!
3.0,"They are so cute, but super thick and cheap. The edges were rough and it took an act of congress to get in, but i've had no problems since. I've showered several times and the colors have yet to tarnish or fade."
3.0,"I bought one ball for my grandson for his 15th Birthday. He loved the ball, however it was losing air when we received it. My granddaughter also wanted one for her birthday. I ordered it and it was shipped deflated. I am returning it as well and hope the new one comes inflated. I would not recommend this basketball to anyone."
3.0,It wasnt elastic is the only problem I had with the belt
3.0,"The first time I ordered a size large (I am 5&#34;7 and about 128 lbs) it was HUGE! I sent it back and re-ordered a size large again, because a friend who bought the same jersey said she had the same issue, and after she re-ordered the same size it came back a more accurate fit. The second size large I got fits much better, but the sleeves are still too big. Also, the color is not a bright white, more of an off-white color. It is not a high quality jersey, but then again, it wasn't very expensive either. I guess you get what you pay for..."
3.0,It's Okay not the best not the worst
3.0,I bought 3. 1 has a crack on the glass. The problem is none of the batteries work. The watches are nice though.
3.0,"The style look nice ,but the material I don't like."
3.0,About a half size too small.
3.0,Too light but pretty
3.0,"At the time I ordered this, I didn't realize the trunk sleeve was so much longer than the other sleeve. Now I see it specifically says &#34;Irregular sleeve&#34; in the product title but it doesn't in my order history so that wasn't just a very obvious oversight. So that super long sleeve is just very awkward and I honestly don't understand the point of it. It would be perfectly cute for the sleeves to be normal lengths. The tail is kind of weird too, just a piece of yarn hanging there. And the brown part on the ear is weird too. I don't know. It looked better in the picture, I suppose. Decent material and quality though, it's just strange to have a sleeve that long."
3.0,"The old cork flops were the best.  These provide decent support, but are way less comfortable.  They are hard and not soft."
3.0,took a minute to figure it out but it turns rusty fast & eventually broke :(
3.0,First pair ordered were to small. And were suede. So I ordered again. New pair are not suede.
3.0,Para mi
3.0,Bracelet is good quality. Packaged in thin envelope. It had blown across the yard when placed wroth other boxes.
3.0,Very pretty dress only let down was I ordered the green one and I  was expecting the dress to be an emerald and it was less intense. I still like it but I was expecting it to be like the picture and it seems more faded to me.
3.0,"Measured and ordered according to the size chart, and they are a lot smaller than expected."
3.0,"Great Quality for the price, but it runs too small, if you wear XL just do nOt buy it. If you wear S buy L."
3.0,"Pros: The color is beautiful. The material was comfortable. I like the shape, that that back is longer than the front... it creates a nice shape. The size fit was as expected.<br />Cons: The material was thin, it was like a knit sweater, but there were tiny holes between the knitting that you would be able to see through (wear an under shirt). The sleeves stopped about an inch from my wrist (I'm 5'8 1/2"" tall). The collar was pretty loose, it stretched across far enough that you could see my bra straps."
3.0,Nice but a little hard to charge
3.0,Shirt runs really wide. I paid a few bucks to get it tailored on the sides to fit better. Other than that I like the quality of the shirt. I do not dry this shirt in the dryer.
3.0,I like this top but it runs a little small.  Size up if you want oversized.
3.0,"I bought this box mainly to hold my lunch in it since my job requires me to travel around a lot, and I am tired of spending money eating out everyday.  I tried the 10 hours challenge with half of them being frozen bottles and half of them being room temperature water bottles.  at the end of it, they were all warm.  I also tried the 5 hour challenge (how much it takes from heading out the door in the morning to my lunch time), by the time it's lunch time the food that was cold is warm.  Now I do need to point out that it is left in the car during that time, and has been 80-82 degrees this week.  But still, I use 4 bottles as cooler for keeping the food and snacks (yogurt, fruit) cool but it didn't work for me.  I guess it might work better if you have a FULL box of cold stuff.  Although I still don't understand the science behind it since it is not airtight (when I cleaned it, water were leaking out) how will it keep the items cold?  Anyway, I will just stick with my $10 wal-mart cooler that is relatively airtight and maybe give away this $30 box to someone else.  Could be I got a defected one as well I guess.  Either way not for me."
3.0,Needs a slightly larger insert pad.
3.0,"This does glow in the dark, however the stone is much smaller than it appears in the photo."
3.0,i'ts okay
3.0,The dots on the bottom bother my feet. I donated the socks to charity.
3.0,The glasses are fine but don't really look much like wayfarers.  The frames are too thin and the lenses are too big.  They shouldn't be described as &#34;wayfarer style&#34;.
3.0,"The bra is basically comfortable, but the sizing of the cups is wrong for an A.  It is cut for much more volume and coverage in the top area of the breasts than is necessary or even attractive.  I am 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs with a normal, athletic figure.  I bought a 38A and while it does not fit perfectly, I kept it because it is so hard to find a good 38A."
3.0,"if you have a built upper body, this shirt is going to be extremely tight on you regardless of what size. first got the XL, then XXL and they were both super tight.. ended up returning both items.."
3.0,"I bought these in teal and purple. The tint is not as dark as I would like, and the colored frames fluoresce in direct sun - which sort of defeats the purpose for me. But, they are stylish as far as fit overs go - so if you wish to look good, as opposed to seeing well, these are great. They fit over my rather large, rimless glasses and are not heavy. I will save these for those cloudy-bright days,"
3.0,looks awkward
3.0,So I normally wear 10-11 depending on the shoe and these were super big on my feet. They were cute though! I prob would have kept them if they weren’t so large.
3.0,"String protrude from back and press uncomfortably against wrist.  Bulky, thick.  Adjust from large to medium.  Good looking, well made"
3.0,"I really like these shades, but there super wide on my face.... I feel like I'm wearing men's shades, but when I ordered them, I ordered women's shades..... I still like them,  they seem really sturdy."
3.0,I purchased this for my wife who is 5 months pregnant. I purchased the medium it fit fine. However the material was thin and revealed everything underneath. As well as the shoulders are oddly shaped.
3.0,"The men’s swim shorts were too small even though I sized up one. I wouldn’t suggest buying them for men because there is no netting or additional layer for coverage. They will become clingy and see through once wet. The women’s swimsuit is cute though, nice fabric and covers appropriately. I would size up one."
3.0,"I absolutely love this bracelet. When I first bout it I thought the bracelet would be separate pieces but came as just one, I still love it."
3.0,"I have ordered this style from another vendor and it fit perfectly. However, this version is too long. It makes me look dumpy (which is challenging because I'm a size 4 / Small, 5'5"" and 130 lbs.) I bought three of them in different colors; will take them in for alterations! (I would do it myself but the thin knit material is a bit tricky to work with and my sewing machine isn't great.) Otherwise, I really like this style; feminine & flattering without being frilly."
3.0,"Love the print, but it honestly looked like a night gown."
3.0,"The material is what I was looking for however, the crutch is not reinforced which I would have expected for any leggings but especially ones made for children."
3.0,"It's kind of a pain to get it wrapped on the luggage, but does the job once its on.  Also, a thief could in theory loosen it, and then open the luggage, although in practice I think a thief would look for an easier target."
3.0,"Since  my glowing review I have worn these about 6 times and the seams in the crotch have holes (like others have reported). The material has stretched and is noticeably  thinner, especially  around the ankles. I'm 5-8 and size 12 so can't  say they're being stretched  too much. Really disappointed  because the idea is great."
3.0,pockets are also a little small
3.0,"If you have hips, the pockets stick out. The top fits well, I am very busty."
3.0,"Casual pants/trousers. More trouser material than relaxed lounge pants. The polyester makes them kinda rough. Also, the elastic at the waist is one of those wide types that cinches the waist. I had to stretch the pants out all around the waistline to feel comfortable. Definitely not summer wear since you'd be too hot. Would work for fall but only around the house or quick errands. It doesn't have much of a shape though the pockets are handy. The length is fine, true to size. But overall it feels tight at the waist so you'd have to stretch them out or size up. But sizing up would make them even more baggy around the hips so you're stuck not knowing exactly what size to get. I was hoping they'd be softer material .. the way they are, I'd probably use them in colder weather with a pair of soft tights underneath. The material is a bit itchy when you sit."
3.0,Not horrible but definitely not as cute on...
3.0,"Size is smaller that chart indicated.. Gave to a friend,  it fit her better."
3.0,"Light button pretty much doesn't work, but the alarm and stopwatch work well, and it tells the time."
3.0,I didn't like the armholes and the material was not very soft. I returned it.
3.0,"Shirt is comfortably soft & looks like the picture, but runs very small. I can easily wear a medium normally, but bought a large that fits like a ladies small at best."
3.0,"Teenie Tiny!! Very nice panties but run VERY small, the medium fits like a small, the small probably fits like an extra small. They are very soft though and sewn well. I will order more in a large."
3.0,"Like reviews said, it runs large. I'm 5'3"" and 170 lbs. I usually fit a size L/XL, but ordered a M and it was still too big on me. Also, the material was not as soft as I had hoped. The drawstring pouch was a nice addition."
3.0,The tassels came off right away and I had to re-glue them. Otherwise I love them!
3.0,Seem more stiff and narrow as compared to the Spanish brand logo. Not as wide. Wear size 8 and got size 9 but should have went with 10. The arch is kind of tight.
3.0,"I really like this case when I got it.  Put the fabric smears if you touch it.  Not very durable.  I can see the covering pealing off eventually, but for the price I will just by another.  I keep up with my case so much better."
3.0,sent the shirt back.  Ordered a x large and it fit snug.  Sent it back awaiting a refund so I can order a xx large. Other than that the shirt was well made and well tailored.
3.0,"Not stainless steel!  Beautiful ring but turned my finger green in a few hours of wear, I was so disappointed."
3.0,They are ok but kinda dark metal
3.0,"Fairly good quality shirt. The material is thin but that was to be expected. I normally wear a small and in reading other reviews, I ordered a medium. The medium however was baggy and too long."
3.0,"So the clasp that holds the two ends of the necklace together was broken on arrival. Which isn't the biggest deal because that chain was garbage anyway. The charm itself is satisfactory, however, and  I'd recommend buying it only if you &#34;have to have it.&#34; And you plan on buying a chain separately for it."
3.0,"I'm 5' 5&#34; tall and weigh 175. After carefully reading reviews and the size chart, I ordered a 2XL, but it is way too baggy. I'll return for an XL and adjust my review if the exchange goes well."
3.0,"Don't use it as much as I was expecting to.  It's actually a little more cumbersome than just throwing all the items into a bag, but I do have a good bag."
3.0,I looked at prior post for shoe sizes and did go with the recommended size but shoe was way too big for my daughter when received.
3.0,This is a very nice length necklace and well-made. Problem is the main stones do not match so it does not look good.
3.0,Cute and good material but runs really small I even ordered a size up!
3.0,Super cute outfit and love the thickness of the top. The skirt is light and falls perfectly. The only thing is we found the suspenders were broken when we opened up the package.
3.0,Nice watch but it stopped working already.
3.0,"I loved the dress, although Care is a bit difficult as it is hand wash and do not soak...But, although I used the size chart and reviews when ordering, was very tight and constricting across the chest. ( I know, a good problem to have, in some circumstances 🙃)<br /><br />When I contacted seller about exchange, I was told there is a $20.00 shipping fee. Not worth the price of the exchange! I guess I will keep the dress and give it to someone else, although I was looking forward to wearing it.<br /><br />The label says Ihot is New York, but I am guessing it is actually from China or somewhere else."
3.0,Wanted to love this dress. The top was very nice. The bottom was terrible. Made me look at lot larger then I am
3.0,Looks great but it broke off easily. My other keychains are still on my rings but this one broke off easily and I couldn't tie the rest of it back together.
3.0,The dress was small and the material was of a really low quality
3.0,"The sunglasses are great in decreasing the glare from the sun! However, they are listed as womens sunglasses but the lens are quite large for my face. I will keep them because they help with driving but wont be a pair I wear in public."
3.0,"tight at the top--otherwise ok, but not good if you swell after being on feet a while"
3.0,I did too much and with the main pen. Scabs all over the place. Please test before doing a bunch of points. What a mess. I am sure the product works fine but use slowly. Really stupid on my side.
3.0,"Came in handy for a while and then the velcro got a mind of it's own. Picked up lint, snag on my hair and eventually lost it's hold, making it impossible to secure."
3.0,Not oem broke same day i received it although very fast shipping
3.0,It was a little too small for my 5 year old. I was still able to make it work but it's most likely going to be a one time wear.
3.0,Nice dress. Unfortunately arrived with a stain/mark on it. Hopefully it will wash out.
3.0,"I believe I got what I paid for. The bracelet is large, better for a guy. The beads and charms are fine, but the knot elastic thread has ends long enough to stick out from the bracelet. Will restring to make it smaller."
3.0,"Not very flattering, pockets hang weird giving me extra in the hips.  I wouldn't wear it out.  Makes a great housedress/gown though since it is soft and comfy."
3.0,"I love the back, keeps the pressure off my neck.  I have bought 3, one each year.  However the underwire pops out after frequent use, lasts  about a season and a half."
3.0,Nice light material
3.0,If it fit properly it would be super cute but it doesn’t if you want it to be over sized I recommend you going up at least 1 to 2 sizes
3.0,"Cute shirt but not true to size, was about 2sizes smaller than expected. Made a good gift for a friend. The colors were nice!"
3.0,"A lot of reviews had said to order up one size.  I did so, and they will fit but will be snug.  If you want a bit looser fit, order up 2 sizes."
3.0,"Unfortunately, these shorts were a bit too tight around the thigh for me."
3.0,"I loved the silky feel and the fit, but am disappointed in the seams started pulling apart on my third wear.... Part of the stitching on the pocket has already come undone."
3.0,"This is a cute dress, fabrics thin needs a slip for coverage."
3.0,"I love this watch so hard, but it has zero lasting power. I've gone through 4 of these. The little rubber pieces on the end always break quickly, 6 months to a year. Possibly quicker. Then it's uncomfortable to continue wearing the watch without the rubber comfort grips. If this watch wasn't so delicate, I'd have continued wearing it. But due to it so easily breaking, I've gone back to Timex and Armitron watches - half the price and doesn't break so easily."
3.0,Did not fit well.
3.0,I usually wear a 2xl in boxer briefs so I thought a 2xl would fit me nicely but when I got them it’s like they were too small. This being around the legs was way too tight and In the crotch area is tight as well.
3.0,She likie
3.0,"I actually love them and am happy I got the brushed metal ones. However, my ears do not. Metal sensitivity is annoying. But as long as I take them out at night it isn't so bad. I did get the 'silver' backings not the rubber/plastic ones with mine- perhaps that is not a good thing. They are tiny, darling,  and fit my 2nd or 3rd hole nicely. I like wearing them facing into my head rather than out; but, at least someone was smart enough to realize this design aspect."
3.0,"The quality of the gloves is not as good as I was expecting/hoping for.  Some of the gloves were already coming apart as I took them out of the package.  The only reason they get 3 stars is because I didn't pay very much for them.  But next time I want to buy these gloves, I'll likely look elsewhere."
3.0,why? just why?
3.0,"Would be fine for USA shoe size 8 or below!  My shoes are USA size 10, and these shoe trees are too short for my shoes, thus loose, and do not provide support to keep my shoes in shape.  Very disappointed, as - except for length - these shoe trees are exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,Nice fit and great price
3.0,"Mine arrived today.  The hat, itself is okay but the logo is pretty cheap looking.  It just looks hastily painted on and the wording beneath it is small and hard to read due to the letters being too close together.  Also, I requested the logo and words to be gold but got yellow.  Not a big loss for the $6 and change I paid for it but not what I had in mind."
3.0,Thought these were bigger.
3.0,They are on the small side and tight around. My baby isn’t very chubby so she was fine but if your baby is chubby they’re tight around the stomach. My baby wears 3-6 month clothes. I bought size 3-6 and they’re already to small
3.0,"good fit, comfortable, pouch is a little loose and my package can easily slip out.. could just be what I got.<br />Overall highly recommended.<br />the hole for the pouch does seem to vary in the size of the opening, seems there is no 2 that are the same size"
3.0,Really cute but wasn't the material I thought it would be it was more of a silky material and it runs really small
3.0,It is shorter than I thought.  It looked longer in the picture.
3.0,It's smaller than I thought it would be.
3.0,Only suggestion I would make is have removable pins on both ends for applications with double loops.
3.0,"Ok so here’s the issue first off, the product image does NOT depict the colors correctly. I can tell even from only ordering the black that I’m sure your experience will be similar to mine with any color you choose. It may just be a preference issue and you may like it the way it is, but the product image depicts almost a shimmery metallic black. This is not the case. It’s black and white and to be quite frank, it’s more white than black as you can see from my photos. This was the first disappointment. I thought with it being a metallic acrylic weave that the crochet would be a bit thicker and more substantial. It’s very very light and very delicate. The upside is that it’s comfy and it does flow nicely but I’m mostly bummed about the color and the photos make it look much more expensive than it looks in person. It’s a little cheap looking TBH. I also think it’s a little pricey for what it is. It does have a tie to wrap around if you choose and may work nicely as a summer sweater for when it’s a little chilly in the AC or evenings. I would set the price to more like $17.99 and than maybe one could make this work."
3.0,"The embroidering is spot on but the size not so much. This hat is a bucket hat. If you fit in Large hats, this may be for you."
3.0,"I bought this pair for my wife as an alternative to yoga pants. She liked the material, but the legs were too tight around her thighs so I ended up returning them."
3.0,"This product, although very pretty, isn't as nice as I thought it would be. I'm looking for more of one that ties behind the neck and has loop ears. This was too tight of a scarf to be able to tie behind the neck. The breathability isn't as good as I thought it would be either.<br />Just not the best."
3.0,Larger then I was expecting. Also the nose part is pretty wide so they slide down my face.
3.0,The glasses really help soften the impact of oncoming headlights.  My eyes were more relaxed and able to drive longer distances.  My main complaint is the size. They are made for a much larger person.  The earpieces are adjustable so they don’t fall off but they are clearly made for a large person.  Don’t buy these if you are smaller to medium size.
3.0,"Cute little dress, but the biggest drawback is the fake pockets. I intentionally look for dresses with pockets because my toddler LOVES them, so this was definitely a let down."
3.0,"WAY too small. I have slender feet and wear a size 8.5, ordered these in a 9 and they were way too small. I will give them to my 23 year old daughter who wears a 7.5, 8 and they will fit her perfect."
3.0,could not get top to stay in bottoms did ok
3.0,This product has a weird cut and isn't for me. It wasn't what I expected. Cute and high waisted but the leg holes are weird like high cut too.
3.0,"Runs small but I liked it, just to right"
3.0,"Cute but fits tight. I’m usually a size small, sometimes medium and size large in this swim top is tight on me."
3.0,"Wife was unhappy. Thought this product had built in bra feature. Well made product seemed sturdy, just felt mislead in the description"
3.0,"It's a beautiful blouse, its run smaller than expected. In the arms area it's really tight."
3.0,"I like the Dan Post boots, but disappointed by them not being made in the U.S."
3.0,after 2 months the inner sole came undone.
3.0,"Very pretty and seems to be comfortable for my daughter. Only thing is that toward the end of the day, the bottom gets a bit loose and hangs. Not too big a deal under pants."
3.0,Cute just too small.
3.0,Dark grey and yellow is not yellow
3.0,These were larger than I expected.
3.0,I am size 14 and curvy.  The colors on this dress are vivid and beautiful but I have to wear this with a jacket to work because it just fits too snug.  I would need to size up to get a perfect fit.
3.0,"Not as big as i had hoped for, but still very cute."
3.0,One was loose
3.0,"I hope it shrinks in the wash, it's pretty big, long sleeves and a little baggy, doesn't make sense, I bought the same shirt, different pattern and it fit perfectly..."
3.0,"The jacket in the picture advertised looks nothing like the jacket I received. That being said, I'm going to keep it because it's not terrible. For reference; Bought an XL. 185lbs. 5""7."
3.0,The material was different than expected
3.0,Very thin and a very shinny---looks a little cheap.
3.0,The product is good enough; however you shouldn't be fooled into thinking you can wear it around the neck under a shirt unseen. We were unable to use these as they were extremely visible under even loose shirts -- and wearing on top of the shirt brands one as a tourist.
3.0,Size up for sure.
3.0,Looks cute but the flowers were flat when arrived. Probably due to the mail man squishing them into other mail or packages....
3.0,No stretch to fabric.  No give at all.  This shirt is an OFF color to what is shown in the photo online.  Disappointed.  I returned it.
3.0,"Too long for me and hard to hem bc front and back are in a U shape. Can't really knot or tie it either, again because of hem and style. The vertical tie dye print is flattering and fabric is soft. Top feels too high on chest neck, especially for summertime, wish it had a round, vee or squared neck that would be cooler. So....yes its pretty but I wish I had returned it (was busy and missed the return window). Not for short people, Im 4'11."
3.0,I loved what it says and it looks exactly like the photo. I upgraded the shipping and it took 10 days to receive. It was a gift for someone and the cow broke off less than a month after giving it to him. Luckily he was a welder and could fix it. Good for a cute laugh or to sit on a shelf but not actually as a keychain.
3.0,"I really like the shirt, but it fits more like an EU size. If you are used to US sizing, you will need to go up a size or two."
3.0,Very soft pj’s but definitely made for someone with a body like a Barbie doll.
3.0,Not ideal for a person with a thicker neck.
3.0,Not supportive enough for running.
3.0,"The quality of the product is nice. The issue I had was the size. I'm 5'3, 110lbs. I normally wear a small in costumes as a medium swallows me. When I tried this costume on, the crotch snaps didn't hold at all, and the actual length of the one piece was entirely top short. Had the snaps been stronger, I might have been able to get it to work. I did like that they included the clear straps for the top part. Overall, for the price it isn't worth having to alter the costume."
3.0,"so the material is magical, they just fit a little small.  I didn't realize they came from outside the U.S. if I knew that I would have expected the smaller fit."
3.0,"I used this to obscured my face for a Grim Reaper costume for Halloween and it definitely did that but it made it next to impossible for me to see my surroundings, especially in a low light situation like nighttime trick-or-treating for Halloween. The material is just too thick to safely see what’s going on around you, and forget about being able to appreciate costumes or Halloween decorations. Wish it was more sheer."
3.0,falls apart!
3.0,Works well but rips easily and shortly after you start using it. Use it daily for juice pulp. Wish it didnt
3.0,"Very well made, however did not like color combination. Returned it for different style same manufacturer,also purchased one for my wife"
3.0,The dress is pretty but it runs small.
3.0,"I would have given this product 5 stars, but in less than 2 weeks, it has started to fray and tear.  If you dont plan to wear it every day, then it is perfect."
3.0,I bought this dress to wear in the classroom.  I was looking for a comfort dress to teach in.  It was long enough so it was not a short dress.  The front was not professional at all.  The v neck was very deep.  I have larger boobs and it made the v look massive and deep.  Not professional at all.<br /><br />But the pockets were great and so was the dress.  I returned it because I could not wear it to school.  It is a great dress though.
3.0,Returned product. Not great fit
3.0,"I got a pair for both kids. We were so excited that they came with charms also. Fit as expected, and the colors are vibrant and fun. Only reason for the three star review is because the strap on my daughters pair ripped after only a few wears. I knew these weren’t the thick material name brand crocs are made of, so I guess it’s to be expected. All in all, good shoe for the price, just be mindful of the fragile straps."
3.0,"I am a size 3 in juniors the bottoms were too large. The quality is ok, I don’t know if it’s worth the $45 though."
3.0,"Good value for the money, but ad did not say it would not work for Seiko Kinetic.<br />Had to go to Versa web site to learn that."
3.0,"Super super tiny. Ordered XL and this barely fit my size 5, 115 lb friend. It also came with a wig. And the wig it came with is by far the largest pile of crap I’ve ever encountered. I did not know it came with a wig and luckily had ordered a higher quality one anyways."
3.0,The colors are very cute. It was so thin you could see through it. I was expecting something I could at least wear in the fall but turns out it will not even be warm enough for summer nights. Price was ok but quality wasn’t.
3.0,I am disappointed the quality of these socks have changed it seams that the material is different the sock is shorter now and slides down I have been buying these socks for over a year this batch is not good
3.0,I did not care for the buttons cheap looking
3.0,"looks good. fits right, easy to install & adjust (with the right tools).<br /><br />doesn't always stay closed. the clasp links are just a bit too tight, so it can pop open randomly.  it doesn't happen often, but once a month, it's kinda annoying.<br /><br />worth the money."
3.0,"While it's a nice pendant, you really have to treat it with kid gloves, as it's a little on the fragile side.<br /><br />Lastly, the strap that it comes with should be more easily adjustable (chain link and clasp).  My friend wasn't too happy with the pendant droopong all the way down to her navel."
3.0,This is just ok. I was hoping the fabric would be more silky and also the cut of the nightgown is a little weird. Not sure if Ill wear it. I feel like I can find a better quality nightgown for the same price or a few dollars more elsewhere.
3.0,These were way tok big for my daughter
3.0,"I bought the black and it was amazing dress, then I bought the pink, but the quality is different. It’s not the same texture. (And the pink one you can see through)."
3.0,This bed is nice but does not have nearly as much padding as the smaller sizes of this version. I bought it because my 110lb pit/rottie has now had two ACL surgeries and needs extra padding. I was disappointed. I used two fleece throws to give him extra padding and comfort. He now loves it and sleeps in it every night.
3.0,The boots are leather but the strap around the ankle is plastic and looks kind of cheap.  They are shorter on the ankle than I expected.  I still think they are pretty good for the price.
3.0,"Esta capa tiene el cuello muy pequeño y le queda apretado a mis clientes. Solo puedo usarla con adolescentes, del resto no puedo usarla con mis clientes. Del resto bien"
3.0,Walking.
3.0,"This ring is big.  I was thinking something small that could be worn on the little finger--maybe if you play in the NFL.  It is about the size of standard high school class ring.  The sizing (9 for me) is good.  I would return it, but isn't worth the trouble as it was very inexpensive."
3.0,"The blouse is nice, but smaller than expected.  Fabric is thin."
3.0,"This purse is cute but it is very small.  I think the picture is deceiving as to the size of it, but I kept it for my greatgrandaughter's birthday hoping she will like it."
3.0,The charm that was supposed to have cheetah print did not. Unfortunately. It was the reason I bought it.
3.0,"I really like this purse, but it has a strong chemical smell that wouldn't go away even after I aired it out for a week and more."
3.0,"I had ordered this for my 3yr old daughter, I was very surprised that it fit my face and head a lot better. This product is way to big for a child however it is still super cute and I will enjoy wearing it or putting it up for my daughter when she gets a little bigger to enjoy it."
3.0,"I found that these run very small. In fact so small that I could not wear them this past summer. I have lost about 30# since summer began, so hopefully these cute overalls will be the perfect addition to my summer wardrobe next year...I can’t wait!"
3.0,I only used twice and it alredy turn like a dirty penny...I can see also in other parts the silver color under.
3.0,I own a Casio G-Shock and needed a replacement band.  This is a &#34;Casio original equipment&#34; band but it is about an inch shorter than the factory band my watch came with.  I have large wrist and it will barely fit.
3.0,It was great then broke after a month
3.0,Rather dissapointed by this. The material is more like a swimsuit and I ordered a medium as reccomended and its huge on me. Love the style but unfortunately I'll never wear it.
3.0,Love the color top somewhat big but too guys perfect
3.0,"If you’re looking for comfort, get 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear. That’s what the model is doing.<br />I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear because 1 I’m losing weight fast, and 2 as a fashion statement.<br />It’s a nice jacket, the sleeves are that material that almost all winter sweaters have but it’s not as hard as Walmart winter sweaters, more like expensive Target sleeve winter sweater."
3.0,"It looks cool, but it smelled really bad out of the package - potent fumes!  We left it outside for a week to let it air out - now it smells like you're sniffing balloons when you wear it.  It's really big on my 9yr old son, so we had to clip the back to make it smaller.  We requested a refund, but that required paying the shipping fee to get it back to China, which would have defeated the purpose of a refund."
3.0,"see through, material isn’t great<br />and btw for those of u that think it’s a gold stripe (like i did prior to receiving) it’s not"
3.0,"They came as pictured, but the material was scratchy and way too see through. I returned them for those reasons."
3.0,It just wasn't my style and it was see through. The arms fit funny and the waist rode kind of high. If it fits your style and body type it will be a nice dress. The fabric and construction are well done. I returned it.
3.0,It smells terrible at first and the zippers clank when i move and it gets annoying but its a good purse
3.0,"I like and dislike this dress at the same time.  I like the sheath design; color; and shape.  The material is a medium weight and can wore seasonally.  The material makes a curvy womens derriere appear huge and that's a problem.<br />For reference I am normally a size medium size 8-10 I purchased a large to minimize anything that will cause attention to particular areas of my body this may be not a problem for others.  I think I will wear a girdle to minimize the maximum.😂 Overall, the dress is okay."
3.0,Wrinkles but comfortable. Hits just at my knee
3.0,"Purse had a chemical smell to it. Overall quality is good, but nothing to rave about"
3.0,Really stretch
3.0,I loved this hat. The color was so rich.  It was just a little small.  Not a comfortable fit.
3.0,"After ordering this tank, I definitely prefer the Thinstincts tank by far. This one is not a good at all."
3.0,"Quite small, but charming none the less."
3.0,"These fit a bit slim, they are really nice hoodies though"
3.0,"The color/print is SO pretty. However, there's too much fabric gathered around the elastic and it doesn't sit right. It bulges right above the hip. My husband teased that I looked like a German barmaid LOL"
3.0,"its thick colored nicely but NO SLOUCH in the beanie what's so ever, and my head is small."
3.0,"Great for the price, but run small."
3.0,Good quality and design only issue i didnt get 5 stars is its way to thick my.son hes 7 so not a tiny mouth but isnt a heavy chewer and dosent like this one because its too thick to chew on..he rather chew on string...so he doesn't use it ..i think they should be categorized on thickness for different types of chewers..
3.0,No tienen la calidad que esperaba
3.0,When I put it on I was BLOWN away with how great it looked. I’m a DDD and have rarely found any sticky bra that would work. But I want to wear tanks and stresses without always having to wear a jean jacket or cardigan. So I put this on through my dress over and was feeling GREAT. It’s 3 hours later (sitting at my desk at work) and it’s starting to lift. I took these pictures at the 3 hour mark you can see the lifting. I’m sure if your breast are smaller (D and you under) you’ll be just fine but big breasted girls keep looking
3.0,"There’s a seam on the side that runs my skin when I wear a belt, gonna return them..."
3.0,My husband said that the blue fabric looked like medical scrubs and that is all he could think of. I didn't like how it looked on me.
3.0,"This bra is really cute and I do like it.  It has two major downfalls though FYI,<br />1) The soft fabric on the padded liners has fallen off.  Take into consideration this bra has NEVER been in the dryer, but this still happened.  Bummer.  This has not happened on any of my other Gaiam bras that receive the same care.<br />2) The Points on the back strap where all the little decorative straps attach, have a hard and irritating piece on them.  I had to trim each little strap right where it's sewn in on the back piece so it wasn't scratching my skin."
3.0,Battery was separate and had to pay more to have installed than I paid for the watch. Won’t keep time after 1 month of use.
3.0,Width smaller than thout it would be.
3.0,"They are cute and exactly what I was looking for, but I wore one in my septum for a week and it broke, you can no longer close it."
3.0,material is thin - but for a hot day thought that it would be ok.. ordered way up and still rather cut small its ok item would not get again in other colors - the sizing is off
3.0,"I love the dress but it was smaller than I expected, I should have sized up"
3.0,"Quality is good.  The material is a bit heavier than I expected, but still breathes well.  Sizing is way off.  Order 1-2 sizes larger."
3.0,True to size. Pretty boots. Nice for fall and winter.
3.0,"The white color was very see through and the top portion was a bit long, on the body it was cut too low in the chest area."
3.0,"Good quality shoe, has soft  fabric. Only real downside is that there's literally no tread. The bottom is very flat and leads to a lot of slipping on smooth floors or wet ground."
3.0,"These are SO cute, but they are lumpy inside, so not very comfortable. And now I see why they come up high in the back. It they didn't they would slip off of your heel. Even with the high back they feel like they want to slip off, which is annoying. I'm keeping them because they are cute, but won't be wearing them much."
3.0,Meh...not a favorite
3.0,Fits as expected but very short
3.0,Just left a good in picture I don’t ass I tried it on it’s too plain it’s not it not what I was thinking I would like to have but I kept dress anyway
3.0,i like the quality
3.0,Need to get pads for inside of the masks
3.0,It is difficult to put on and heavy at times. it is pretty there is a way to get it on but i do not know how.
3.0,"Disappointed that I didn’t get any teardrop earrings, just six different “leaf” style. The company did apologize and refund my money, but I was really wanting the teardrops.<br />Other than that, they’re good quality."
3.0,The back is very low cut to the butt. I'm 5'3 118lbs. Nice clingy material. Great clubbing outfit.
3.0,"These are beautiful, but a little too small for me.  Would have been better with three blooms."
3.0,I bought these for a group of mid twenties friends.  All felt like the bands were too tight.
3.0,"I wanted to LOVE this. I find it gorgeous in person and absolutely adore the skirt. The fabric feels luxurious and the pattern is just the right amount. Even the waist band has some shimmer running through it, but it all works and isn't too much.<br /><br />I am 5'3 and a size L/ 10/12 with an hourglass figure. I was so disappointed that way it flairs off the waistband added extra bulk to where I didn't want it. This may look fantastic on a slim frame, but I don't find it flattering for my figure :( Bummed!"
3.0,The badges are added as an afterthought and the quality of it is bad - Slanted and placed upside down (see pics). Would have been a cool hat if not for the flaws.
3.0,soft but big
3.0,"Cute (quick option) for last minute needs. However, many things had loose strings I had to cut off & I had to re-glue the hair clips that come with the dress because they were done poorly with “hot glue gun” and were hanging off the metal clips upon opening. The dress was super cute after removing all the loose threads."
3.0,"Just cause that CAROLINA BLUE blood I bleed won't let me give it any lower. Good material it felt like but, the words have a double effect I wasn't feeling plus with the letter print not to sure how it would hold in the washer machine. So cant keep it but...its at least 3 stars on the phrase and color alone!"
3.0,Bought 2 as Christmas gifts and only one worked.
3.0,Ordered this to wear to a wedding but it looked a little drab for a daytime wedding even with jewelry - chose a blue dress instead.  The jacket material is a very light chiffon and the tiers on the bottom of the dress are sheer(not the bodice) but I kept the set to wear to an evening or event I need to wear black.  I like that I can substitute a dressier or sparkly jacket for the one that came with the dress -it's not attached.  Thought it would be a heavier stretchy material knit.
3.0,"This was given as an unsolicited, Amazon-shipped,  gift to my elderly mother. She has never mentioned it once since she received it, so I'll have to assume she's not all that impressed with it. That's all I can honestly offer in the way of a review."
3.0,Shirt is made of nice quality but its a bit short.
3.0,"Logo looks awesome shirt quality is kinda iffy, feels rather cheap and the sleeves around the wrist are already fraying"
3.0,It is good but i imagine I do not different. It is a little small.
3.0,The ring is lovely but it tarnished pretty easily.
3.0,Does keep my head warm but I only wear it when I am outside.  It is quite warm if wearing it inside so I don't use it to go anywhere.  Also keeps slipping down over my eyes.  Basically use it when I go outside to feed the birds and it serves the purpose of keeping my head warm!
3.0,"Fits as expected, but fabric is lighter weight than I expected.  I wanted a heavier, warmer sweatshirt.  I won't be ordering any more of this brand. :("
3.0,I had this necklace less than a week and the chain has popped broken.
3.0,"other than too small, 3.5 year old likes to wear 'em"
3.0,Update... I spoke too soon.  Brass links at the bottom keep breaking off.  I'm going to have to find a different wallet chain and use this for something else.  Keys or something.<br /><br />Solid and feel sturdy<br />It's brass so the hook bends fairly easy so be careful if you adjust the size<br />Price much better than you will find in the motorcycle gear sites<br />It was $60 at the site where i first discovered it
3.0,"The bag was ginormous way too big for a gym bag, and the material was very cheap."
3.0,"These socks have a strange fit - toes are too big, but grips barely cover heel. They are not cushioned at all - very thin. I'm a size 7 1/2 womens on the narrowish size. Would like the elastic around the edges to be better too. Overall I don't like and will not purchase again. However, the seller was very responsive and issued a refund, so I added a star."
3.0,The pendant is a little small compared to what you would think it should be other then that its all good
3.0,Cute dress.  Fits as expected but rides extremely low on breasts just above nipple area.
3.0,Outfit is cute but the pants are super long so the color all bunches at the bottom.  If you’re 5’10” these will work.
3.0,The price is affordable. You can adjust the length with provided tool easily. It is leather but the belt inside had several cracks
3.0,I like these donut rings but a couple arrived broken. It looks like they are packaged well but they are jammed into one bag too tightly. They need to work on that to avoid poor reviews.
3.0,These were so cute but I will say they weren’t big enough and especially if you are bigger in the hips and thighs area. Very tight in the legs too. Was disappointed and had to cut them to get into them so it’s good if you are a smaller person. That’s a lot of money to have to cut to get into.
3.0,Shorter than it looks:(
3.0,These do the job of protecting your palm and palm side of your fingers but the material on the top of the glove is very cheep and thin. I wear a small ring and it tore through the material. The hole just gets bigger and bigger as I use them.
3.0,"The actual earrings themselves are nice, but they are SO difficult to get on. If it's worth the time for you, then I would suggest them. However, if you're looking for something easy and quick, don't buy these."
3.0,Thin plastic buckle broke even gently used.<br />I love everything else about this band but that send plastic buckle broke even though I am very easy on my stuff and I do not do anything but wear the watch I do not work on anything like a car or anything when I am wearing a watch. It just broke because it is so thin.
3.0,"The jacket is super cute and warm, but the quality is poor. Both of the hood strings ripped off pretty easily creating holes in the hood and the pockets developed holes as well. Defy does not uphold normal toddler wear and tear. Did not even last a whole winter for us."
3.0,I liked the pink color.  But the top 10 were pink.  Underneath it was white!!! Misleading!!!!
3.0,The dress is very stretchy and thin which is fine but it has a large whole in the seam upon opening. Will have to return.
3.0,Cute but not comfortable enough to wear for very long.
3.0,Comfortable and durable.  Only reason for lower rating is that the green ring has blemishes in it such as areas with no green coloring. Good for work
3.0,This purse is okay in size but it looks kind of cheap.  It has 2 pockets and I am used to 3.  The handle isn't quite sturdy enough for my taste.  It is light enough and I will keep it for when I need a smaller purse but it has no pizzaz.
3.0,This was a gift and the only thing wrong with the watch is that you have to keep changing the day and date to correspond with the correct day and date.  It changes in mid-day and is aggravating.  Instructions were not all that helpful.
3.0,I normally wear a 6 so I got a medium and it was big in the hip/crotch area. Overall cute jumpsuit
3.0,"Pictures make them look way more vibrant than the actual product, work ok."
3.0,I love my Talit - or prayer shawl. What I didn' t like is that 1 of the 2 bottles of anointing oil that I ordered with my shawl was leaking so it wasn't full & there was oil in the package.
3.0,"I bought a small and it was extremely tight around my bust/shoulders.  I could barely get it off!!  I am a size 4, and wear a 34D bra.  Sadly, I had to return it.  Otherwise it was absolutely charming."
3.0,The watch looks great! The only complaint is that the watch does not adequately self-wind resulting in a labored winding routine about every other day.
3.0,Not as advertised - only 4 pockets!!
3.0,"very thin, Returned it for refund"
3.0,"color ran the first time it got wet,"
3.0,"These look cheap. Not what I expected. Very small and one of the hearts is missing a letter in the ""Big Sister"" ill have to call and ask about a replacement. A little disappointed because o thought they would be good gifts. Not really pretty either work all the color as you would think. Not happy with them."
3.0,"As of this review this hat is priced at $19.99 and I would not want to pay any more than that for it.  I don't think it will last a long time as the material is soft and very flexible.  The brim is nothing to write home about being narrow and flimsy, but for a kid or a teenager the hat is fine.  My teenaged daughter immediately claimed it when I pulled it out of the box it came it."
3.0,Really cute and well made. Sturdy construction and vibrant colors. Would fit well on maybe a toddler or doll.
3.0,"My son wanted these and the sizing was off. The material is not great but you cannot beat it for the price. All in all, not horrible."
3.0,The clip at the back gets loose after a while eventually breaks.
3.0,The writing was a bit blurry<br />But I still like it
3.0,"This product is sterling silver, but was smaller, lighter and not as solid as I expected. This was a gift for my husband, and the rotating closure was lost within a few months of purchasing it."
3.0,"The necklace itself is nice.  Feels sturdy and the design is very pretty.  My issue is that I ordered the ""Paisley"" necklace because that's my daughter's name.  I was sent ""Destiny.""  I have no use for this necklace now."
3.0,Looked kinda dull though
3.0,nice but fragile
3.0,"Not what I was expecting. These are much larger than I thought they were going to be. I also thought they would be thicker and better quality. They are very thin/flexible. However, after trying them on I decided they are still nice looking, just not something I would wear to work. More for wearing out at night."
3.0,I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter to wear to a ballet class. We wore it to 2 classes without a wash and the tulle was falling off at the waist. There was also a random blue string sewn into the colar.
3.0,"Wasn't true to size, order up But otherwise cute"
3.0,Meh not super impressed.  Good value for the money but cheap material. Dont expect any tummy control from them. They are thin but not see through. For around the house cleaning they work but not wearing out.
3.0,"See through material, not good quality!"
3.0,I bought this shirt for my sons birthday . He lived the characters on this graphic tshirt however this shirt did run a little smaller then described . Also the shirt isn’t as thick as I though it would be . You can even say you can see a little though it
3.0,"Delicate and fell apart easily, though was also easily repaired. And was also was large for my wrist. Over all it was good."
3.0,"Love the colors perfect for our '80s themed skate party! The shirt fits as expected but the pants do not!!!! Shipping was super fast, product quality You get what you pay for."
3.0,"I had to re-order this dress due to sizing.  I ordered an 18, based on the reviews (I usually wear a 16), but even the 18 was too tight.  The colors and quality are good, but not for a &#34;high quality&#34; function."
3.0,"The shirt was mire boxy and shorter than I expected. Idk, the fit is just not cute and the print looks wayyyy worse than the pic online."
3.0,"Actually these are pretty earrings but they are more for that little princess in your (or someone else's) life.  By that I mean you can give them to your young daughter maybe as her first set of ""real"" earrings but definitely not for your wife.  The diamonds are really small.  That's not to say that the overall presentation isn't nice but I had to return the set because they were too small for my wife to use, even on a casual basis.  Even she was - well, not misled but - confused with how the ad is presented.  And perhaps this could be appropriate for an adult wearer, like maybe in combination with some other earrings worn.<br />Anyway, bottom line:  cute but buyer beware.  They are small.  Pretty but small.  Pretty small...!"
3.0,"The design is very cute on this dress, however if you have a larger chest it stretches on the top. The flowers get bigger and the material thinner, making it semi-see through at the top. I like it enough to put a cami under it and call it a day. Material is a little cheap feeling."
3.0,Pretty small and rough fabric. Its as described though and cute still.
3.0,"Initially it's beautiful. However, I've broke 2 of them. It's very thin and it's broke twice at the top of the tree trunk. I'm really disappointed cuz it is pretty."
3.0,"The design and fit of these socks is perfect, exactly as shown in the photo.  I really enjoyed the day I wore them after a hard day at work and took off my shoes and saw the cute design.  The only issue is that one of the pairs already has a hole in the toe area; after only one day of wear.  I've worn another pair since; seeing as the package comes with five pairs and no holes in that pair.  I hope the one pair was a fluke and the others last awhile."
3.0,I thought the fabric was more ribbed than it is.
3.0,"I like this shirt but didn’t realize how much shorter it is on the front. It covers must of my butt, but not my hips/sides, so I can only where in my home.  If it were longer in the front I’d give it 4 or 5 stars. If you have tits, order 2 sizes larger if possible. Only runs to XL though."
3.0,This dress runs small.  I can not zip the back currently.
3.0,So I went by the fitting chart that was posted but they were to big. If you wear a 32 their pants size is 34
3.0,"It fit cute but I thought the shirt would be white to go with some white jeans, but its like a cream color with like a lil hint of gray... Not wat I wanted..."
3.0,I gave this bracelet three stars for its good quality. It’s beautiful and looks more expensive than the bargain price it is here. However it is for larger wrists and isn’t adjustable at all. It can’t even bend in and I’m afraid if I even try to it will break. If your wrists are small like mine this will fall right off!
3.0,I would definitely size up!!
3.0,As expected they snag easily.  They are what I expected.  Not bad if you know it will happen and you don't plan on using them every day
3.0,Nice pattern and pretty. Unfortunately it goes over my knee and is uncomfortable after a while.
3.0,Returned item size was not a true size
3.0,Turned for very fast.
3.0,Ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear and it was still too small.....also does not look anything like pictured.
3.0,Looks like a quite cheap because of materials
3.0,"For a size small, this runs very big. The lace wraps around and cuts under your armpits bc the lace width is so thick. Very disappointing."
3.0,If u have skinny legs don't go for it cos it will fall  down to your ankle. It's hard to get in cos it has no zipper.. 3 stars cos it's very comfortable to walk on. I gave a friend with bigger calf.
3.0,Ordered a 2x and it's rather large. I'd order a size down.
3.0,The band and straps were as appropriate size but the cups were ridiculously small. I wear a 36 B bra and ordered a M. It would have been cute except my breasts were completely smooshed in the bra (and not supported at all).
3.0,Dress rises up as you walk. Only dissatisfaction
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a05b312a61f3bb0657cb6980a4529481]] No es de excelente calidad, pero es usable y tampoco es de la marca q se supone tiene."
3.0,The watch is great it looks really nice inside. When I wear it I find myself taking it out and winding it often enough to keep the time going. My only complaint is the &#34;glass&#34; on the inside almost feels like plastic.
3.0,The dress came and got will. The drawbacks it’s itchy and COVERED in cat fur. Who had this dress before me? I mean this is uncalled for
3.0,Not quite as good as I expected
3.0,Only because the supper was defective had to get a new one out in all really spent more than u should have for this  outfit. But the fit was perfect
3.0,I ordered these for party favors for my sons birthday party.  I ordered the ones that have all different color lenses but the ones I received are all black with black lenses. Other than that they are fine.
3.0,I love Dragonfly's & this was just up my alley.  I find it tends to rotate on my wrist if not adjusted snug. I would recommend this item however.
3.0,I don't feel comfortable in the top. It feels like it is going to fall off. Got a large and the bottoms are perfect but the top is either a little too small or just uncomfortably made.
3.0,"Works as advertised, though I wouldn't trust it to be submerged in water. The band was cheaper than I expected but for the price I don't really care."
3.0,They look closer to pink than red😥
3.0,Not really a compression tank
3.0,"It fit great at first. Then it shrunk. I don't wear it anymore because it shrunk that bad. My own fault. Don't dry!! Otherwise, pretty good material and looks great on"
3.0,"It is a pretty short dress, should probably be worn with tights or leggings. Is a soft material and good arm length but the V neck sow job wwas not done well and ripped on the first wear."
3.0,"I usually wear a size 8 (but should wear a size 10 because I've gained weight), so I ordered a size large according the sizing guide.  I ended up trading the large in for a medium because the former was too loose, especially at the waist.  I find this odd since most of my post-baby weight is distributed at my waist.  I'm not sure if the odd fit is due to my short torso.  The medium fits a little better, although I could probably still size down if it weren't for the cut in the back.  It rides up enough where it can be mistaken for a thong.  Another issue I have is that the left and right center bands at the waist are not symmetrical.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms, I'll keep the item because the price was cheap, the top part is really cute, and I was intending to wear bike skirt over it to cover my bum."
3.0,"2x was smaller than average.  I like my 2x shirts to be looser than this one.  I liked the logo, so I kept it."
3.0,The bracelet is really beautiful and it was packaged in a mini floral jewelry bag but I am giving this bracelet three stars because it is flimsy and arrived bent.  It looks small but it fits and wears very nicely.  I wish the bracelet had more memory in its shape when it was constructed.
3.0,"It is cute, but it fits small."
3.0,Not for 1 year old or 12 months. Maybe 18 months or 2T. Not a winter coat definitely for spring showers.
3.0,"A nice top for casual wear. Not the best quality fabric, but good enough."
3.0,Pretty but flat on one side ans keep turning around ans not laying flat.
3.0,Disappointed that it is NOT button down...tailoring leaves a lot to be desired...sleeves are a bit too long....love the pattern but not so much the shirt itself!
3.0,I bought the two pack of black and gray in XL which supposedly fits 16/18.  I thought being a size larger than I needed they would be loose and comfy.  They were tight and what they say fits a 16/18 probably is more like12/14.  The material is very thin and does not feel very stretchy.
3.0,"The medium fit well, liner is a bit longer than expected. Overall nice shorts, but not well made - stitching came somewhat undone as seen in the picture."
3.0,This would fit someone best with a long torso. I'm pretty tall but it fit weird and the skirt was longer in the front than than the back. It didn't work out for me.
3.0,This product says it is cotton but feels smooth like silk. Nice material!
3.0,"overall good, but can't adjust nose piece, kept slipping down during bike ride"
3.0,it ran smaller than what I am use too.
3.0,"They are fine quality, but huge."
3.0,"The fabric is totally different than the picture shown. It’s more stiff, but no wriggle out of the dryer. So, I don’t mind that. Definitely cute, easy pull on with deep enough pockets, but definitely not worth $20+, less than $10 would be fair because it doesn’t seem gonna last long, it snags easily."
3.0,"So far this product has done its job in polishing my silver jewelry. I do have to say I was surprised and glad that this slip of paper came with the product in case I did damage my other jewelry, but the product information should have listed the caution label."
3.0,"Took forever to arrive, if that wasn’t the case, it would be five stars"
3.0,As I expected the shirts did a great job keeping me cooler than cotton t-shirts did.
3.0,"These say they're for larger feet,  talls, but they aren't really that long and while they fit,  they're a little tight and shorter in the length than I'd like."
3.0,Super adorable. These shoes were over the top as far as decorations but thats perfect for a little girl right? Lots of compliments. The little one wears them so much that after two months one of the bunnies fell off and the toes are a fading from pink to gray. Cant complain. The value matched the price.
3.0,This is somehow smaller than I expected.  (Look carefully at the dimensions.)  I didn't use it as much as I thought I would.
3.0,The silver color is very nice. I don't like the way the leather exterior zips.... it looks a bit tacky.  Also do not like that the leather bag is unlined.  Instead of lining there is a removable insert which has pockets.  I will have to punch some extra holes to buckle the shoulder strap at the right length (for me!  I am 5' 3&#34;.<br />The other carrying straps seem awkward.... they stick out to the sides.<br />The bag is an odd leather texture it looks like synthetic  material but probably  is leather.<br />I will use this bag until I find something better.  I am probably a bit too particular about the type of bag I want to carry around daily.
3.0,Great deal for the money. They need to incorporate size varieties with the pants and top. Be able to mix them size wise. I bought the 2xl thinking they would fit better than XL but the pants are too big. Will probably reorder the XL. This is a poly/cotton blend.
3.0,muy pequeño. Aunque no dejo de reconocer que esta super hermosa
3.0,"Got this for my wife, great price and very cute design. Material used is actually nice and seems durable. My only complaint would be that the small elephant colored bronze completely faded to silver but thankfully still looks good. Great buy for the money but just be aware of this minor defect."
3.0,The product is great and served as a wonderful Halloween costume but I did have to tie a significant part back with a hair tie.  I ordered an XL and it easily fit like a XXXL.  I was 18 weeks with my second child so I had a bump at the time but I don't anticipate ever getting so large that I'd ever be able to fit the shirt.  It worked out for the price though!
3.0,cuando se lava se encoje la tela
3.0,Adorable well made dress that unfortunately runs way to small!☹️
3.0,It is okay. Light and not that good quality materials. I like to wear it at the gym as it attached to my body when I am sweating
3.0,"I bought this set for my baby’s 1 year photo shoot. It’s very pretty but the size was so off, very loose and long.. awkward big shoulder sleeves. I ended up not using the onesie and just used the headband for her unicorn photos :( Also, the material was kind of odd for a baby onesie. It didn’t look right on her."
3.0,This should be ordered a size or two down. It has lots of stretch but the jacket zipper isn’t great and the pockets on it sits really high
3.0,"Order up. This runs small. Even with the 2 sizes up it  just for perfectly. It is NOT long. It falls just below my knees which is not a length I like at all. I’m 5’6 so it’s not because I’m tall. . Other than that, love the pockets, fabric and print."
3.0,Very fashionable but broke after one wear
3.0,"Could be made better. Strings left hanging, fabric sewn unevenly."
3.0,"These are cute but they fall off easily. First time it was my fault (i rolled down my window while driving 20 mph). Second time it had just disappeared. Nobody rolled down the window, it was just gone. Thankfully I had a backup pair but I had really hoped they would have lasted longer than 2 weeks before being lost."
3.0,"Cute, but you will definitely need a slip to wear under it since it is pretty see-through."
3.0,I had it delivered to my parents' home where for my kiddo.  Mom said it was WAY too big... and my kiddo is TALL for a 5-year old.
3.0,Magnets aren't string enough.
3.0,"I really like these socks. They are thin yet warm and comfortable. I got a lot of use out of them, until holes developed around my big toe. Others have complained about this very problem. I will try to mend and I refuse to throw them out, but it’s an inconvenience. I don’t have long toe nails so my guess is that they’re just fragile socks. The socks were for work where I walk a lot in boots. Unfortunately I will not buy again, which is bummer cause I did like them."
3.0,"I really liked the design on these but they broke after a week, i suggest getting a glasses case to accompany these."
3.0,"the back of the swimsuit is a very pale yellow, it needs extra lining or you can pretty much see through it when its wet"
3.0,Looks a little different than the picture . But still looks good on. The material feels good to the skin.
3.0,The leather was of a poorer quality as to what I have been used to in the past. I prefer a much softer leather.<br />Barbara Gamache
3.0,"Sleeves too tight, the rest of the dress fit nice"
3.0,Adorable but runs way too small so my daughter couldn't even wear it (and she's petite for her age)
3.0,it okay not what i expected
3.0,"of course you can tell that it's not expensive, but for a every day wear to give your wardrobe some color, it works.  Color does fade."
3.0,Was not the quality I expected
3.0,The material is real then hope they don't fall apart . to expensive for what you get.
3.0,"Good quality, I feel very classy in it. However, I am only 5'2&#34;  and this barely covers my bottom so beware - it's short!"
3.0,"Nice looking shoes, just beware the tip is VERY POINTY!"
3.0,you got what you paid
3.0,Like the design but a little too small
3.0,"I ordered this to wear over a pair of leggings.  I have to say up front, the design on the shirt is pretty, but I do not care for the fabric.  This is what I would say is a &#34;swimsuit&#34; type of fabric.  It's heavy and it doesn't really 'breathe'.  I ordered the XL size, as I normally wear a size 14-16 and this thing is really huge on me.  I was nervous about the fit, as this is an imported product and since it comes from Asia, some things tend to run small.  I'm only 5'1&#34;, and this literally hits me about 2&#34; above my knees.  I will end up using it as a cover up for my bathing suit this year-I can't imagine wearing it with anything else.  The fabric is glossy, with a very noticeable sheen to it, and it's hot (meaning it traps your body heat) which I have a hard time tolerating.  I will keep it though, because it will work fine for the pool or the beach.  It's so long people will just think I am wearing a really blousy, really loose dress."
3.0,The material and stitching was cheaply done
3.0,"Too big, hem was not finished on the bottom"
3.0,Two of the bracelets broke the first wear. Not as &#34;solid&#34; as I'd hoped.
3.0,Probably bought the wrong size
3.0,It’s an adorable outfit but the size newborn implies very small......this outfit is much closer to 3-6 months. My peanut won’t be wearing this for months.
3.0,The mask was too small. It was super uncomfortable.
3.0,"I'm getting ready to travel for the holidays and bought these as an alternative to packing a yoga mat. I loved the idea, but the reality is that the gloves are quite painful on the webbing between my fingers and the socks don't feel much better between my toes. I've got pretty big hands and feet, so maybe that's the problem. I'm going to see if I can find another yoga student who can use them. They seem to be well constructed and look like they'd last. They just don't work for me."
3.0,"This is a really cute sweater, and it fits as expected - but I was surprised at the shade of yellow when I opened the packaging. It is almost Gold in color. I looked at this item on 3 different screens before purchasing, and found the color looked the same on all screens. The color i saw on the screens is VERY different than what arrived."
3.0,"Quality of the shirt is good but the sizing is Juniors, not Women’s, and was too small/short to wear."
3.0,Cute but the arms on the glasses are a little long yet. I'm sure she'll grow into them as she's only 4 mo old.
3.0,i gave it three stars because the style but the thin cheap material was soo dissapointing..
3.0,IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE  REAL WHITE MOTHER OF PEARL DIAL. IS IT ?
3.0,"Very small in chest area. The top kind of bunches up as well. If you are taller, this is not a good fitting bathing suit."
3.0,Lenses were blurry
3.0,"One fit great, one fit okay, and one didn't fit at all (blue one)."
3.0,"Calidad baja en las costuras, los cortes, el tejido y todo a nivel general. No vale el precio que pagué."
3.0,Viene un poco grande de los tirantes
3.0,"fun udies for men, but don't have ""escape hatch"""
3.0,Extremely thin material makes me hope I can wear it more than once.
3.0,I liked the mesh band but it causes my sweater sleeves to fray and cannot wear it with sweaters.
3.0,"I liked the quality of this suit and the fact that the top overlaps the bottom.  But I agree with the other reviewer who said this is not good for those of us who are busty.  I ordered a large and was falling out of the top all over (bra size 38 D).  too low cut for me, but also it was just too narrow all over the bust--I was falling out in the front, on the sides, everywhere!<br /><br />I didn't want to try an xl since it seemed like the cut was the problem; also,  I wear a medium on bottom, so an xl bottom would likely not work (by the way, the bottoms on this did fit me--and I usually wear and 8-10 in jeans, but they were tight and skimpy too, so if you're really looking for a large in the bottoms I don't think these would work).<br /><br />Probably great deal if this suits your body type, but for mine, it was a no go."
3.0,"These are cute but they didn't last very long. My son wore these nearly every day for a couple months and the back part ripped open on one of the shoes. I sewed it back together and he got a little more use out of them before they fell apart some more. Pretty cute and cheap, but, not that sturdy. They we're a little bigger than expected, which worked out well."
3.0,"I like this belt, it looks great with a number of outfits, very versatile. The only problem I've had is when I do a lot of moving around the clasp comes apart fairly easily."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings on this necklace. The pendant itself is pretty - the color of the stone is like a greyish blue that is nice. But the pendant feels fake and really lightweight. I absolutely hate the chain. It’s too thick and has a few small kinks in it that don’t come out; it’s also quite short. I will most definitely be swapping the chain out with another chain before wearing this. It comes with a jewelry care card and a pleather zipper pouch that I don’t think is suitable for storing necklaces, but could be nice to use for a pair of headphones or something of similar size."
3.0,"The shoulder strap isn't very long, and I had to add some clips and such to adjust to my liking. What really stinks, though, is the bottom buckle webbing is not secured, and it slips right out, rendering the closure useless.  I have to find a way to secure it (glue? safety pin?) in order to feel  confident in using it."
3.0,I liked the size and look of these sunglasses but had to return them.  The lenses were much too light.
3.0,dress is different in person but ok
3.0,"I love the looks of the robe, but it is definitely &#34;not&#34; one size fits all. I'm a little busty and it hardly closes."
3.0,"Few things to note.  The band does look nice and I'm sure it will break in nicely.  The leather is fairly thin.  The hardware isn't very robust.  I can't say it's worth the expense because it is pricy compared to other bands.  It's close to the price of a Nomad but not near the quality.  Also due to leather thickness, it's impossible to get a Blood Oxygen level reading."
3.0,"VERY stretchy, buy a smaller size than you would get if you were purchasing a leather belt. I have so much length left when I finally cinch it down to my size."
3.0,"Lovely dress 👗.. Fits as expected, Really appreciate it"
3.0,Comfortable but runs big. It's like a dress on me but its very loose so I would look too boxy to pull it off as a dress. I will tuck it in the front of my pants and that should work.
3.0,There big!
3.0,"Good enough especially for the price. I thought it would fit like the others I have purchased from this brand. But no.... . This one is really ,,,, really small ...."
3.0,Large and super see through bummed out that i removed the tags so now I can't return it
3.0,This definitely isn't a 2mm wide chain... Not sure why they're advertising that it is. Super thin but otherwise a decent chain.
3.0,Not cotton more of an athletic wear type shirt but I got as a gift and they personally like that but I do not
3.0,"These gloves have a nice design, which is why I bought them. But when I received them, I noticed that there were a few loose threads on the gloves. I didn't want to take the risk of them unraveling so I returned all of them."
3.0,Item is nice but fits big in order a large should have gotten a medium but it’s nice wore it to a wedding
3.0,"This dress seemed like a lesser quality than the others I found in the same design. The colors were a little too weird and some beading was really loose. I ordered in the apricot and the color was really more like a beige/cream. The super bright embroidery was too much of a contrast against the light fabric for my liking. The size 10 was a little too big in the chest, and I am a 34DDD. With that said, I did order a smaller size in a different color to give it a chance, as I think it could still be a less expensive alternative for a dress that may only be worn once or twice."
3.0,"Not as expected, no elasticity"
3.0,petite and cute but the gauge was too thick for my earring holes. had to return.
3.0,"Bigger than expected,  but seems to be good quality."
3.0,"The shoes looked amazing and we're comfortable for a good while. Once they began to hurt, they HURT. Shoe gels are definitely recommended"
3.0,It was pretty but the print should of been on both sides
3.0,liked it until the latch broke kept falling off
3.0,"These are about fingernail size in total, center stone large surrounded by circle of little ones.  Thick lever backs that I had no problem with.  I actually thought 1 of the levers was broken when I got them, but, you just have to click firmly closed.  I think should be cheaper but, that's my opinion.  Look cool, a lot of sparkle..really catch the eye with movement"
3.0,Looks nice but its just the plastic that u have to cut yourself so i dont know why it costs so much...
3.0,"I am 5’11, 190 pounds and I got the XL. The fit was great, the skirt flared out higher than expected but nothing too bad. But if you’re taller, be prepared to check all night that your not mooning everyone through the cutouts. Besides that, great purchase."
3.0,Bottom fit great. Top extremely small!!!
3.0,"I like the case better than the glasses because it is spring loaded and you just squeeze the end to open and it springs closed.  The glasses are just okay - I like the oversize, but it may be to much for some with smaller heads than I.  Kind of reminds me of the big lenses General Qaddafi used to wear - if you like that look they might be for you.  The top piece that looks metallic in the pictures looks somewhat cheesy metal painted plastic."
3.0,Little right waist
3.0,"Super cute, not great for working out, kept falling down, better for lounging."
3.0,You get what you pay for but it looks  pretty nice to be fake my elephant ring broke immediately
3.0,"I wish I could give this hat more than three stars, I really do. It is super duper cute (oh excuse me, my son would say &#34;It's not cute mom! It is cool!&#34;) It seems like it is well made. The colors are great, the stitching seems good, the details are fantastic. Really, if I am just looking at it sitting on a table, I am endlessly amused with it, and adore the hat. The problems are what kill it for me though. First of all, it is tight on my 5 year old. His head is a tiny bit on the bigger side, but based on the product description, I thought it would fit. So that is dissapointing. My son actually picked this out though and he refuses to send it back, so he will wear it for as long as he can, tight and all. Still, I know I will for sure be buying him a new hat next winter and I'm not thrilled about that. Secondly, do you see how the bat wings basically extend all the way in the picture? They do not in person. They extend maybe halfway up and one goes more forward than up.  Honestly, that really bums me out. I cannot tell you how geekily excited I was to get this and watch the wings extend and fold back down a bunch of times. I really was. Again...my son loves it, so we are keeping it. I don't think he even realizes the bat wings don't go up all the way since it is on his head. He is happy to run around squeezing the handle and making everyone look at how cool it is.<br />So to summarize, it is on the small side for my five year old and the bat wings so not extend all the way up like in the picture. But it is a well made and absolutely adorable hat for a child with a smaller head."
3.0,Bought for my grands. They are almost gauge like not what I was expecting. They will never wear them. I can’t even wear them.
3.0,Fits loosely like it’s used.
3.0,I could have loved it but it didn't fit me :(
3.0,"Fits, but definitely smaller than expected for xl. However. It does roll up while running...maybe because its smaller than needed."
3.0,If you order get a size bigger if not it's to small
3.0,"This bra is beautiful but difficult to put on.  You have to put it over your head as there are no buckles, or snaps.  As I am a full figured woman, it took some stretching to get it into place, but I had to untwist it as I was trying to get it on.  Once it was on, it was extremely comfortable.  It did't even feel as if I had anything on.  As much as I love the comfort of it, and even the beauty of it, it did take over 2 weeks to receive, and the difficultly of putting it on, it just isn't worth it.  Maybe they make some with snaps, then maybe I would buy more....but as of now, I will just find others."
3.0,Pretty and nice fabric but it fits too large
3.0,I ordered a medium and it fit more like a large.
3.0,nice looking shoe but it runs small
3.0,"Great for small boobs, but as someone who is a 30G, it barely covers my bras. Lace at bottom is a bit tight around the hips too, do it kind of rides up. Have to be careful when wearing it outside of the house. Very pretty soft fabric though."
3.0,I have purchased several capris from this company and all have been great except this pair. The waistband has loosened up to the point where I am constantly pulling them up. The heather color is a nice change to plain brown. Would buy again.
3.0,"Cute, comfortable shoes, great design. Fit a little small. I would recommend getting a half size bigger than what your child normally wears."
3.0,"It’s hard to find a good pair in this stone that matches well together. The pair I received were completely opposite in color and design, which is fine however One had a blemish like some kind of scratch that made me wonder if they even looked at them before sending them out. On the advertisement they show the prettiest pair of tiger eye plugs but the ones that were sent to me were not the greatest."
3.0,"Had to get something for my 4 year old sons last minute event at daycare. I knew that the vest would be too large but I really just needed the tie, wig and nose. This oackage was literally delivered ro me about 20 minutes ago. Before opening the pacakage I could already see that the tie was broken. The yellow fabric piece in the center that holds the bow tie cinched and holds the elastic to go around your neck was unraveled. I went ahead and glued everything back together because I don't have time or morivation to return this for another one. Definitely adult-sized. Wig looks pretty small though. Pricey in my opinion."
3.0,They are ok. Very cute. Not comfortable like other sports salads I’ve had. But ok to get in the water at the beach over shells. Not for hiking at all not much of a grip.
3.0,"a nice shirt, good quality fabric but WAY to small!! i am a size 14 and the 3xl fits like a medium! the arms fit surprisingly well however it would not button at all. i imagine that if you did get a size that buttoned the arms might be too big. But it is a great feel and fabric quality."
3.0,"I was excited to order these sunglasses. They look so great online. When I got them, my heart sank. They are very cheap looking and aren't as nice in real life as the photo online. They remind me of dollar store sunglasses. I will keep them, but I am not willing to praise them at all."
3.0,Too small.. i just gave it to my 4 years old daughter..
3.0,"I didn't like the mid calf, and the waist line was right under the bust, so I returned it. Other than that, it was actually really cute."
3.0,Sexy dress not doubt however not for everybody. Runs like a medium/large size.
3.0,"WARNING: The posts on these earrings are thicker than standard earrings. For earring wearers used to regular-thickness earrings, these will hurt to wear until you're used to them. There's also screw points on the ends that are especially painful to put in and pull out for first-timers. I wish I could wear these more because I really like their look but the soreness it causes me is too distracting"
3.0,"Looks nice, but don't plan to wear it for an extended amount of time because it corrodes easily and turns your skin green."
3.0,"These are ok nothing special. I purchased the black ones with the growling cat, so cute concept poor execution. So anytime you buy darker cheaper leggings with a pattern on it i always notice the reverse of the fabric is white, which is horrible because when you put them on they stretch out and you can see the white underlay (my legging fanatics will know what Im talking about) So they look great until you turn around and the butt part is all white/gray because your butt area is stretching the most. I thought it was me I am on the curvier side (5'8 150 pounds 36d-26-40) So I gave them to my 125 pound BFF, they did the same thing for her. I also didn't like that the waist band is thick (which i typically love) but the actual elastic inside the leggings is thin, I found that weird and annoying. These had potential to be bomb and sexy as hell! Oh well. I was offered these leggings at a discount of around 50% in exchange for my unbiased review, I think they are listed a bit high for quality you can get some higher end leggings at this price point. these would work for someone who has minimal curves in maybe one of the lighter patterns."
3.0,A little bigger and heavier than I had thought they would be but can't beat the price of the $3.89 I paid . The silver plating may not last forever because it may not be of great quality but time will tell.
3.0,This necklace is nice but it fits snugly around the neck.  I am keeping it for my teenage niece to enjoy.
3.0,There very cute shoes but they run really small sending back for a bigger size. But there really cute shoes.
3.0,"Item was too small, was given as a gift."
3.0,"Pros: Decent color/shape, folds into pocket<br />Cons: Ugly embroidered logo, and most importantly thes hat is HOT. That's right, it's HOT! Your head bakes in this thing.<br />I don't now how OR managed to do this but it's true, it's an oven and it's frankly a bummer."
3.0,One cam broken in the package and I have worn them for 2-3 weeks and one has started to discolor
3.0,stated child size but large
3.0,"I like it, it’s cute, but it has design issue….it is too small for adult."
3.0,"I just needed some 14K studs to keep a piercing from getting blistery and closing. These were perfect for the price and are sparkly and cute. They are very small and subtle on my ear.  My only complaint is the post is very slim and it's difficult to get a strong fit. They do not come with 14K backs, though, just plastic backing. That didn't bother me because I have other backings i prefer. I would not say this is giftable because it just comes in a plastic bag with rubber backs. They look nice in your ear but not impressive in hand.<br /><br />Update: Dropping to 3 stars. After wearing them for 2 days, my ears began to itch and swelled up enough that they were tough to get out due to the swelling. This should not happen with 14K gold setting and posts. I suspect the posts are gold plated at the very best. I'm very disappointed."
3.0,"This is beautiful but won't let me secure completely no matter which way I install the Fitbit Alta nor which side I fasten first, but it is extremely close to closing securely. V-Moro is shipping me a replacement, so I shall update the review after I get that."
3.0,"This bag is well made. It is 10 by 10.5, not 10 by 12 like advertised."
3.0,They broke after 4th use
3.0,I wasn't thrilled with the consistency or the glide.
3.0,Too big for what I needed.
3.0,This band is super comfortable but the color has faded within a week! I don’t wear my watch at night or in water. This is just from normal wear. I’m bummed because I loved the feel and the color but it just looks so cheap now…
3.0,Need to get 2 sizes bigger
3.0,Not the best or the worst. It does the job. It’s a once a year outfit.
3.0,Fabric tears very easily
3.0,"I ordered size 37 which were too short. Returned them for size 38. Also, the heel seems too narrow because the shoes turn side ways when you try to walk.  Hope the 38 will do better."
3.0,"It's not pink, it's purple. It's also tiny. Photo is kinda misleading in regards to the pink hobo bag."
3.0,"This dress runs large. I am 5’5” and 130 lbs and my measurements are 38, 29, 38, and the chart said to order large. The dress was way too big. Also, the fabric was itchy and wrinkled. I was concerned it would wrinkle easily. I returned it."
3.0,I thought it was 100% cotton and it is not. Not as breathable as I would like. Very pretty though.
3.0,They were nice just extremely small. Could not see them on the ear at all
3.0,"I like this, but the purple and yellow turned out to be purple and light green. I'm disappointed about that. But it won't stop me from wearing it."
3.0,The shirt was way too small. The screen-printing is stiff. I decided to not send it back as my daughter was okay with it.
3.0,The shoes were nice but it took so long to get them that they were too small by the time they arrived.
3.0,If thr Sun is not too bad?
3.0,I think i am allergic to this material.. After a few days my hands started itching on the wrist. Otherwise its a good strap. Looks good.
3.0,"The dress looks good. However, the feel of the dress just did not match the look (to me). The fit is okay also. I will still recommend that  you purchase."
3.0,No support in bust area but fit as it's supposed to
3.0,Great little socks and the pastel colors were so adorable. Said it would fit 9-11 but they fit size 8 maybe 9 tops.
3.0,"I’m 5’3” 113lbs 34DD. The small fit nicely on top without fabric pulling over my chest. I just wasn’t a fan of the fit at the bottom. I don’t have a big but, but the shirt seemed to pull and sit weird at the bottom, over jeans and over leggings. Sizing up might have fixed that issue but then I imagine it would have been baggy on top. Meh."
3.0,Lookes and feels cheap... Material is bad
3.0,Looks little like the photo. Almost all black stone. Came fast. Well polished and smooth. But I am probably still missing a stone of astrophyllite. This does look more like arfvedsonite.
3.0,Had to return because the small seemed to run big. I am 5/3 and 107 pounds and it was too big on me.
3.0,The fit was somewhat too large for me. I'm not sure if the next size down will be too small. Skeptical about purchasing again.
3.0,Pretty comfortable. Although it is a bit small around the ankles.
3.0,"I love the product.  The only reason I am leaving it 3 stars is because it arrived with one of the dangles broken.  I would have returned it, but i figured because its so fragile, the others will soon follow so i will just enjoy it while i can."
3.0,the 'white lace' on the back is sticking out which I don't like. otherwise it would have been a very nice top...
3.0,too small in the back and nit that comfortable.
3.0,i wasn't crazy about the print.
3.0,So I received this dress in the mail today and I would have given this more stars because as far as quality goes the dress is perfect but I decided to go with three stars because this dress is an unrealistic length I understand that some women are taller than others but nobody is this tall I am 5'0 and this dress drags behind me like a train on a wedding dress so if you're thinking about buying this and you're between my height and 5'5 please be prepared to pay have this altered and if you're shorter than that well just forget about it... don't even bother
3.0,They are ver cute but the straps already broke.
3.0,"These earrings are so cute and they look like the picture.  However, the post on the ear crawler is crooked and I am afraid if I try to straighten it out it will break.  They are dainty and I'm not sure that the quality is very good.  Because the post is crooked, it does not lay quite right on my ear.  I will try to exchange and will update my review if the next pair is better."
3.0,Too small (I’m a 36D normally) and when I tried on and attempted to pull the fabric to the side - it didn’t stay.  Snapped right back across my chest.
3.0,The zipper is not a good one.  It takes me almost forever to get it zipped.  I think I might put some Vaseline or petroleum or WD30 on it so it will zip easier.
3.0,I love this dress but the lining ruins it for me.  Way to heavy and hot.
3.0,But they would hurt if u leave them in so I returned them
3.0,Bonito pero muy pequeño
3.0,"I really like this, but with consistent wear it's already beginning to lose the coating over the metal and turn to a brassy/orange/green color."
3.0,very pretty but not for large wrist
3.0,"pretty, but larger than I expected.  Heavier than I expected.  Will not wear...but will not send back.  Ill give to a friend who likes them."
3.0,"We get very good use from them and they take a lot of abuse. For those looking for a headphone for their PS4, PS3 or XBOX 360, the &#34;Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4&#34; is a headphone that works but is it for you"
3.0,The cardigan is fine. The only thing is the color is off. Its darker and more yellow than I expected so it didnt match the dress I wanted to use it for.
3.0,"Elephant is cute, but the clasp that attaches it to the chain is not durable."
3.0,"The dress looks identical to the photo, but is cut too small."
3.0,It works as expected... I just thought it would be a bit longer. Had to buy extension links that don't get to match the band to be able to wear it.
3.0,"Had to wash it twice, because the scarf had a funky smell to it.  After the second wash, the scarf started falling apart and still has a weird smell to it."
3.0,"I am personally not crazy about this bag because it is so large. It fits my 12.9"" iPad with its cover with no problem and has room to spare for wallet, phone, keys, etc.<br /><br />The front is buff colored with two strips of dark brown and a buckle in the middle as decoration. The reverse side has a generous zippered pocket that will fit a small writing pad. The interior is a snap closure with one zippered pocket and two slip pockets on the opposite side.<br /><br />There is a regular carry handle and also a longer shoulder strap. What is interesting is that the shorter carry handle is gray to match the gray strip down the middle of the bag. However, the should strap is buff colored to match the rest of the bag.<br /><br />In addition to the above, the bag also comes with a ""Moda labeled"" clear plastic string-backpack-type ""bag"" shown in the last photo.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is not for me as I do not like its large size, shape, and style.  It is made of faux leather and looks and feels cheap to me in person. The cloth interior feels nice, though and the zippers glide easily. On the positive side, since it is made of PU leather, it is easily cleaned and maintained. It is spacious but I was not looking for something so large. It is functional and useful but, after having seen it, is not my style. However, if someone is looking for a large bag that gives the appearance of leather from a distance, then this might fit the bill."
3.0,They're a lot bigger than I expected and they're hard to get in. Not sure it was a good purchase yet or not.
3.0,These are what I ordered
3.0,"Good Bracelet, beautiful beads, but they are big. Bigger than my other beaded bracelets."
3.0,This dress run  kind of large so I would recommend if you buying it order it one size down
3.0,Cuter in the picture than in person although my daughter really liked it. I wanted it to be a little baggy but ordered my normal size. If you want it to hang a little order a size up.
3.0,Cons: Sizing doesn't justify a U.S standard. It is very small and material is too thin. Pros: cotton material and style.
3.0,"I'm 5 ft 4, 148 lbs, a size 10 with boobs (36D) and a butt. The shirt is very cute but the bust area was too small and it was shorter than I expected. I ordered an XL but had to send it back."
3.0,Loved these earrings they were exactly as pictured and so adorable! Wore them one day and ended up losing one by midnight. Kinda disappointed as these were the first clip ons I’d found that I could wear more than two hours. Would possibly buy again.
3.0,"The hat is a nice hat, but the decal is just that...a cheap iron-on decal.  I was hoping to wear this hat as a primary 'round-town hat, but I will probably just use it as a work hat in the garden.  Decal doesn't look like it will hold up in the washing machine, so will probably have a plain hat soon."
3.0,"Bought this for my husband and the moment he removed from the box the smell was overwhelming.  To me it smells like oil.<br /><br />Otherwise it works great, he just has to store in outside because of the smell."
3.0,not like i wished!!
3.0,"Was mislead cause when I looked up item I looked it up as a set so when it was sent I just received the hoodie,so I felt misguided. Paid too much for one piece. Want order from them again."
3.0,The strap that comes with to big
3.0,Ok for the price.  Looks smaller then the one on the pictures.
3.0,"Overall I like the purse, but the zipper is difficult to slide at the most open position."
3.0,Nice color. Lace isn't as wide as shown. Material is thin.
3.0,"These are super cute and made well. However, a couple of things that would make them better for me: 1. The XXL size says its for 3T-4T, but the string between them is barely long enough to fit through the arms of a 3-4T coat—it &#34;just&#34; works, barely. 2. I should have known better, but the material they are made of seems to wick the water immediately into the fabric soaking them after about 10 minutes of playing outside."
3.0,"From wife:<br />Dress is pretty. I didn't get the long maxi dress that I ordered but here is review on the short dress that was sent. I am 5'2 150lbs 38c. Received a size large and it was just a little loose on me. The sequence design was very pretty, the lining was soft and breathable the slit does go a little high and the v cut by breasts is low. The front of the dress I received seemed like the stitching was not tight in the mid and lower sections (see pics) but aside from that it sparkled! Its color is mixture ofblush and gold. Had to return it because it was the short dress and I had ordered the long one."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who plays the violin, but when it arrived it had an electric guitar charm on it instead. Still a pretty cool bracelet, but not the right gift for my friend."
3.0,"The design is really cool, but it is a pain to get the strap back around it and in the storage bag after use.  When it arrived I questioned myself why the storage bag was so much bigger than the umbrella. It would fall right off if I hung it upside down. After opening the umbrella up I found out why the storage bag is so much bigger, because the umbrella does not close up and wrap up as small as it was when it arrived."
3.0,"I ordered these because I have sensitive ears and I always have a hard time finding my &#34;good earrings&#34;. I loved the sparkle and the quantity/selection. The sizes are great. They're very comfortable in my oldest piercings, which are about a decade old, and quite pretty. However, I used these in my cartilage piercing, which was about six months healed, and it swelled and reacted so badly I was unable to wear anything in it. It closed up within 48 hours while it was healing and I've been heartbroken. Still wear these in my older piercings but I wish I'd sprung for 14k gold."
3.0,The material is great compare to other sauna suits. It helps with getting a bit of extra sweat. It takes a few days for the smell to go away. Make sure to wash it a couple of times.
3.0,Strudy but not big enough.
3.0,"Seemed to run a little small, but overall was comfortable."
3.0,"Love the shirt, but too small.  Does not run true to size."
3.0,Shorter than expected...inexpensive sock...expect getting what you pay for.  Not a fan.
3.0,Arrived on time but the quality could of been better. One of my four glove holders has the stitching all jumbled up connecting the snap. Looks like a birds nest. The rest have lose or extra string
3.0,"Overall the bracelet is rather nice.  In and of itself it is worth the price.  HOWEVER:  Day one!  Day one!  the retaining/adjuster, in the center,(on backside of bracelet) used for adjusting the bracelet to fit your wrist, unraveled.  I knew it would the moment I laid eyes upon it.  OY!<br /><br />Now I have to find a bead shop and have them fix the darn thing.  It is easier than having it replaced with another bracelet that WILL do the very same thing."
3.0,"Too small, loved the style And color"
3.0,It’s a very nice bracelet but super bulky
3.0,"I love the style and the fit, however I am 5'9 and these for more like capri's on me, they are high above the ankle. I will have to return them or try to get away with wearing them as capri's"
3.0,The product does its job. It's made ok. Holds its shape. I liked that it arrived quickly. I like the color.
3.0,Great materials were used to make the bag but the stitching isn't so great. I bought the bag for $11 so it was worth it overall.
3.0,The necklace is very light weight and very fine chain. The tassels look so thin when they hang down they don't even look like tassels. It does have a nice shine but not eye-catching at all. The photograph shows the tiny chains fanned out and the two tassels separated. It doesn't hang like that at all. If you move it around the tiny tassel chains get tangled.
3.0,"I had been eyeing these boots for awhile and was lucky enough to grab them when they went down in price. I ordered my normal size, 9, and all my Cape Robbin shoes that I’ve ordered they all fit TTS except for these. These feel like an 8.5, even with thin socks. My heel and toes feel squished. So much so that it’s painful to walk in them. There’s no way I can wear these. Since they’re synthetic they’re not going to stretch.<br /><br />They are beautiful boots, very soft faux suede and striking, but I’m glad I didn’t buy them at full price because they’re so small. Unfortunately I had to go out of state and missed the return window so I’m going to have to resell them.<br /><br />I recommend sizing up for these boots."
3.0,"okay, running small strap to short."
3.0,"I love orient watches. Some of them...... When orient does it right, they do it great!. But, when they do not, they dont. Anyways, this is a beautiful regular orient watch. The watch itself is very good quality. Beautiful dial. The case is very nice an built well. This watch has a plastic movement holder to be honest, but the watch is still great quality. Now, the BRACELET...... Complete trash!!!!!.... I am very disapointed an upset with orient on this one. The bracelet has hollow end links , plus the bracelet is trash. For 360 dollars they could have made such a better solid bracelet. I had a very hard time taking the bracelet off an while doing so scratched up my watch. I am very careful with my watches but this was a nightmare. The endlinks scratch in between the lugs an leave marks on  the bottom of the lugs. For 360 dollars this was disgusting. Orient makes great high quality watches.. buy this watch for the watch. But not for the bracelet... I had put on a beautiful goat leather blue strap. My future watch will be the orient star moon phrase. ""Hopefully""....... That will be the only watch i need in life....."
3.0,"Good-looking & well made, however, their sizes are a bit off from standard gauge sizes. When I measured them with my calipers they don't even match the sizes listed on the packaging."
3.0,Some stranger wrinkles on the breast. I returned it even it looks cute.
3.0,"My, it's awfully small."
3.0,"Muy linda pero la tela no es de la mejor calidad, no abriga nada en invierno ni es fresca en verano, no se cuando darle uso"
3.0,the size was to large for me.
3.0,"Kinda cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Ces tongues sont tres jolies mais pas tres confortables. Achetees pour mon fils de 8 ans qui ne s'en plaind pas et les met pour aller a la gym, mais je les ai essaye et je trouve que le pied glisse dessus. Par contre elles sont larges, donc bien pour personnes aux pieds larges."
3.0,Eh. Kind of cheap looking.
3.0,I expected them to be a little more light weight but they are usable for the intended purpose. Part of my uniform.
3.0,"I'll keep them, but don't know how often I'll wear them. I do barre 3x/week and these are a little light for that kind of workout. They're very thin and it's almost like wearing nothing. I'll probably wait till summer to wear them for my barre workout."
3.0,This is cute. It looks perfect for an every day sort of look. I got it because I do not have many gold tone necklaces and was looking for an inexpensive piece that I could wear for work and match some of the cute gold earrings that I had purchased. This necklace fits the bill. When you look up close you can definitely see that it is fashion jewelry. The circle pendent does not move on the chain and it came with the pendant backwards from the way I usually put necklaces on so the clasp is in my left hand when I put it on. Not impossible but it makes it a little more difficult to put on and take off. I also fell asleep in it for one night and the chain is already turning black or green but I did get compliments on it when  i did wear it. I guess it was my bad for falling asleep in it but I think I pretty much just sped up the inevitable.
3.0,"It’s extremely large, loose and very thin fabric. I do believe i ordered a medium, i should’ve ordered an extra small."
3.0,These are really cute and the quality seems great. I was okay with paying more for kids glasses if my child got more wear out of them. But I bought the size recommended for my child’s age and they look way too small on her.
3.0,OK for the price ...washed em first to soften the material.
3.0,I really loved these earrings but they were definitely too large and pulled my ears down. That is sad because I had to give them to my niece since I could not wear them. :(  :(  :(
3.0,"Nice fabric, pretty design, but this top is cur EXCEEDINGLY small! Size up at least 2 sizes."
3.0,Very small. Good quality
3.0,They are ok. Fingers run a little small and the palm area are a bit saggy. I would suggest not using them until you are ready to use them in whatever event it is. Mine is part of a Halloween costume but I've worn it twice and it's stretched out.
3.0,"This was my first experience with a clicker. At first I did not like this clicker because the moveable clicker part goes everywhere. But once you get it in, it's great. It was a little longer than I anticipated, but it didn't effect my daily life. I've been wearing it on and off for a few months now, and it has definitely started to change colors. There's a weird green build up if I leave it in for more than a day."
3.0,"I really like the design of these pants, and the feel of the fabric. However they are way too small for me.<br /><br />I usually wear an xl, but I ordered a 3x because I didn't want them to be skin tight. They are so small, I can't even get them on. My sister usually wears a medium, and they are comfortably loose. We think the 3x is closer to a large."
3.0,These did not keep my hands warm by any stretch of the imagination. I don't think they claim to be waterproof but they got wet fairly quickly in the snow. But the finger grips are nice.
3.0,Earrings are beautiful but much smaller than I expected.
3.0,"I was looking for a dress to work with my Halloween costume; this is what lead me to this particular dress.<br /><br />I ended up with an XL in the white color; it was fairly form-fitting, so shapewear was required. (I'm wearing between a 14 and a 16 size jean with 38C bra if that helps at all.) What I hadn't expected was that the garment ended up being pretty sheer as well; so in addition to shapewear, I needed to wear nude undergarments.<br /><br />Other than those blips (and that is why I took some stars away from this product), the dress was great. I'm 5'6"", and the dress hit just above the ankles. The material is very soft and feels nice against the skin. I'm a bit worried that the white may stain easily, even more than white normally stains (it seems like it might be one of those items that seems to absorb from the air).<br /><br />I don't know that I would rebuy; perhaps I would try out a different color next time."
3.0,"Nice high grade material. I ordered a XX- Large, I am usually a XL and it is kinda tight. Also not very long."
3.0,Order 1/2 bigger than you wear
3.0,comfortable but there is a smell to them
3.0,"Its not nice tulle, it's a very cheap looking fabric."
3.0,I don't like that it is not creased in the nose and chin area
3.0,"Cute and daughter loved it, but it broke on the second day. She just fixed it herself instead of us sending it back."
3.0,The product is not bad only is too large and expensive.
3.0,"I ordered the black and brown watch straps in  18, both came quickly, well packaged and easy to install. A few hiccups though, they include instructions on how to switch out the buckle (which is usually simple enough)… except their buckles do not seem to have a spring to remove them? Which was fun to notice after having already removed the buckle from my mk watch to switch over.  Next, the color on the brown straps.. not even CLOSE to the pictures and not at all what I needed or wanted, cute enough but still have to continue the search. And last, feels fairly cheap, thank goodness they look nice enough though so if you don’t use them often you might be able to make them last a while."
3.0,Shirt is comfortable but the pockets keep turning inside out and end up outside of the shirt.
3.0,"Pants seem very comfortable and fit true to size but they look too much like pajama pants (especially in the plaid fabrics). I was looking for something to wear to work, a little more dressy. These would have been highly inappropriate even on a casual Friday. Probably going to return."
3.0,"this necklace is very pretty, however mine fell apart (chain ) within a week of purchasing"
3.0,"I liked how well the logos were done. BUT IT IS EXTREMELY THIN, and doesn't seem very durable for everyday use."
3.0,"It’s okay. 36DD. Cups did not cover great (some side boob). Support is not great either. For the specific tops I bought this bra for, it works though. Sometimes I will layer it with one of my other fun back bras or a tank with a shelf bra to kind of assit with lift."
3.0,"To start off, i only had one post that missed a ball so thats great, the 14Gs are good. Decent size, and should work for what you need them to.<br />The 16gs however may not be what youre looking for, the studs they have will work for your nostrils but lips are out of the question. Same deal with the circular barbells (horeshoes) and the captive bead rings, they will probably work for a nostril or ear but not much else.<br />The set came with 16g Barbells, they are absouletly ridiculous, I dont think theyd work for much as the balls are so tiny and the legnth of the bar is equally as small. Now they have 16g curved barbells that would be perfect for a vertical labret.<br />I put multiple pennies down so you can get an idea on size.<br />Overall, these will work for my nostril piercings and ill just keep the rest for spare balls so its not awful.<br />I wouldnt recomend this though if you need jewlery to put in a fresh piercing."
3.0,It was a gift for granddaughter. She loved it after we bought $7.00 batteries. The batteries included were dead.
3.0,Order 2 sizes larger than you usually wear! Not sure what sizing chart they used but it doesn't match any other clothes in terms of size.
3.0,"Too short, and I am only 5'4&#34;, don't stay up at all.  Will work as very light compression on lower legs maybe."
3.0,"It’s not quite a classic cap, you adjust with a strap at the back, but it’s fine. The emblem is not sewn  on professionally, it’s just a picture ironed on to the front.  I knew it was a risk as it’s not licensed by Mauser buy bought it as a gift.  Buddy still really liked it and it looks pretty good all things considered.  Not sure how long it will last however.  If you really want a Mauser baseball cap for the range this still looks pretty cool.  Just not top quality."
3.0,Kinda big and flimsy.
3.0,Cute shoe but poor traction on sole. My child slips while playing and running on tile and laminate floor. He's only 16 months so this is a bit more important for him than an older child.
3.0,Not super comfortable
3.0,Bought a size 6 for my niece and it was so big on her. Had to return it but it was super cute. Sad they didnt have a smaller size at the time.
3.0,Dress is ok but not great. I ordered a medium. The bottom fit great but the top was too small its basically a nipple cover. The material is a little itchy. For the price it will work for one night of fun.
3.0,sexy but the belt is already ruined after one wear
3.0,It was totally not as expected.
3.0,"The skirt is large, but the waistline is so small for the size. The waist does not have a zipper or stretch. A disappointment - it’s a nice skirt. I have a modest hip with small waist and I could not get it pass my lower hip. The skirt is very wide though."
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; with 37&#34; hips and a 26&#34; waist, and I purchased a size small. However, it was a bit big and an extra small would probably have worked better. The fabric at the lower leg around the ankle is baggy instead of fitted on me, which I don't particularly like. After only a couple washes some of the stitching is starting to come unraveled. However, on the plus side the color is very nice and the material is thick enough not to be see through anywhere."
3.0,"Pepper's Eyeware FRONTLINE MP673-27 Raw Grey Polarized Sunglasses:<br /><br />It says right there in the name - POLARIZED sunglasses. These glasses are NOT polarized. Not even a little bit. This is false advertising. Or, perhaps they are knockoffs. I don't know, but there is nothing polarized about these glasses.<br /><br />Polarized glasses cut glare on reflective surfaces like car windows and water. Even water on the road. They also block out computer screens when you turn them 90º to their normal orientation. These do not do any of that.<br /><br />They do however fit very well and are very light on the nose. The yellow is a little yellower than I had hoped, but they are clean and comfortable which is great for my expected use. I like this type of glasses for driving in inclement weather, and that's where the polarization would also be very useful. But even this yellow, the lines on the road really pop and it's a little like having my own private sunshine on a cloudy day. So I do like them - they are just not what they claim to be."
3.0,"I was so sad....this one is going back. It is soooo cute and soft and pretty. It just did not favor or compliment my specific body type....AND, it was an EMPIRE waist.... which does not look good on me. The pic doesn’t show an empire waist....as a reference for you ladies, I’m 5’5” 125to 135 lbs, 34c....I really wanted to keep it but it looked pretty bad on me 😭 BUT of empire waist looks good on you, go for it 😘"
3.0,"I struggled with whether to give this 3 versus 4 stars.  First off, it is knit well and it is a very nice looking sweater.  That being said, it is much lighter weight than what I expected, and the knitting is looser, not a tight weave.  I was looking for more of a heavyweight sweater, and this one is more like a mid weight, but, with a looser weave.  I think for spring and fall kind of wear, it’s fine."
3.0,"Simply did not look like the pic online!  It was a lot larger, and the crystals were not as pretty.  I dont think it was worth it."
3.0,Pendant is good but the chain broke immediately.
3.0,When I can get it to stay in it's nice
3.0,"It's really spacious for a wristlet but the outer material looks and feels really cheap.<br /><br />If you're looking for elegant and spacious, this is not a good choice but if you want spacious - grasp it."
3.0,"No matter how tight I made it , the straps did not stay on my legs."
3.0,"Kinda short for me. Three inches longer would've been great! One pair was torn when removed from package, but, they were cheap!!"
3.0,Doesn’t really compress!
3.0,"This is really pretty pattern and decent quality for the price. Unfortunately, it is short...I had read the other reviews and knew it might be too short, but wanted to try it anyway. I'd only wear it if I wasn't really walking around the beach or pool, simply just to coverup a bit while laying out. I'm about 5'8&#34; for reference."
3.0,"The hat is super nice as far as the fabric, size, and overall look, probably the best quality I have seen in the many I have purchased for tennis. I have not been able to wear it yet because it pinches worse than most. I have been stretching it for a couple of weeks and may be able to wear it in another week. I have it anchored over a couple of five pound handweights."
3.0,The lining is ripped
3.0,Super cute boots but were too small.
3.0,Needed to be an 1-1 1/2 inch longer. I ordered my shirt neck size but its too short.
3.0,"model must be over 6ft, dress hangs well below knees."
3.0,These are really dainty and pretty but I was disappointed with what I received. While I received all I wish I got gotten all of the colors and more consistent numbers. One of the pieces is messed up too :( They are pretty though.
3.0,Cute but not supportive as a sports top. The padding doesn't have a slot to go into so they're basically just sitting on your breasts. Awkward.
3.0,"Bracelet is very pretty,  but the beads started breaking off after 3 wears. I lost 2 beads another fell off in my hand"
3.0,"T bar too thick for Shoei Neotec 2! Had to make my own steel T bar, tried shaving down the provided aluminum one but it lost strength pretty quickly"
3.0,"First, very cute boots; however, the leather smelled and the boots hurt after wearing them less than 3 hours.  Bummed."
3.0,Cute top...just very thin material. For someone very thin with no extra curves :).. this top will be perfect!!
3.0,It lasted 4 months not bad for the price. Looks nice just didn't last.
3.0,the socks fit well however thiner than I expected. No cushion.
3.0,"I loved the way these shoes looked when i opened the box (i bought the natural multi with the wooden heel), but turned out to be slightly big and loose. The size was fine but the strap didn't fit tight enough. Moreover, my feet kept slipping down. I ended up returning these, wish i could have kept them though! Once i wore them i was 2 inches higher than my boyfriend. Good shoes but not for me."
3.0,This felt strange material wise and the fit wasn't amazing.
3.0,the back is very very very long
3.0,"I ordered a large and it runs big. I would say it fits more like an XL. The fabric is a little thin, I had to wear a tank top underneath. The shirt is otherwise comfortable."
3.0,Great Socks.
3.0,5’0 145lbs 36DDD based on reviews I got an XL should of ordered a M! I tucked it into my belt and luckily it didn’t look to bad.
3.0,Was a bit small but made it work
3.0,"I bought these to go with handmade jewelry.  They arrived in a tangled mess.  I see what they were trying to do with the twist ties, but it really didn't help.  Quite a few of the clasps were defective, so a lot of them had to be thrown out.  I spent a long time detangling, and managed to get a few good chains out but it wasn't worth my time and I pitched the rest.  There are similar products available that arrive in separate, individual baggies and are much easier to work with so I just bought those."
3.0,Cute leggings but size up. Low stretch and your girl is a coke bottle. Still can’t wear them but they’re in my drawer waiting for me to shrink lol
3.0,"No, it was much smaller than I expected ."
3.0,the zippers are plastic and don't always want to zip closed. but its a good size and the material is good for an outside purse.
3.0,I had issues with the color.
3.0,"The ring design is essentially a flat version of a classic signet ring. I like the style, but the ring itself is smaller than it should be. Measuring it the inside diameter is 18.8mm so a little small for fit for a size 9 which should be 19mm. I also measure the thickness which the listing says is 2mm, but it is 1.5mm or the thickness of a penny. So it runs smaller than it should considering its listing specifications.<br /><br />At the time of review the price of the ring was $195, which is very pricey for what appears to be a stamped out ring that doesn't look like it was meticulously buffed. The attention to detail wasn't there and the weight of the ring only has about 24% of the price in actual value of gold. So it's running smaller and lighter and cheaper than I would have expected. It's not a horrible deal, but it's more delicate because it's only 3/4 the thickness and it's overly simplistic and mass produceable in it's design to really garner the price point as it almost feels like a disposable ring rather than a long term investment to hand down.<br /><br />Unless it has a decent sale or coupon on it I wouldn't recommend the investment due to risk of damage from normal wear."
3.0,Glasses had fuzzy distortions in them which were annoying to look thru.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughters birthday. She is very slender. It fits her wrist snugly and is not as shiny as I expected. I think you could wear it with anything. However I’ve not seen her wear it. So.....,"
3.0,"I am 5'8"" tall, weigh 134lbs, and wear a 36DD bra and I got a M in this, but it could fit better. I usually wear a M so this is appropriately sized to fit and I followed the chart but it seemed small in the bust- It did not come on time and I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't really matter but I know it does to most Amazon customers.  Amazon did not offer Prime on this garment so I never know when to expect their packages when that's the case. I usually don't even bother to buy merchandise that is not offered Prime but I loved this top!  I call the color ""subtle charcoal"" and it is very pretty and a flattering shade for blonde hair and a light complexion....I just have to work with it to make it fit on me just right, and keep readjusting it as I'm wearing it throughout the day.  It crisscrosses over the bodice but it wiggles down below my bustline instead of laying across it.  Maybe a larger size would have nipped this in the bud.... but the sleeves are very long and flared at the wrist, really pretty. The body of it is loose and flowy with the uneven hem which is so stylish now.  I have to say the top didn't feel sewn especially well or of particularly high quality, but I get lots of compliments and it has held up well when I've laundered it.  I wash it on the delicate cycle with cold water and hang it to dry.  I can't decide if I would purchase this again or not, but can say for sure I wouldn't recommend it to someone else.  Although it's cute it does not hang on me like it does in the picture.  But it was priced inexpensively so I'll just have some fun with it!"
3.0,"An nice bag, but it is pleather, definitely not leather. I carry water bottles in when I go out to quince my thrist."
3.0,They r soft & comfortable
3.0,I got these shoes for my son at a steal. But I guess you get what you pay for. When we got them he tried them on and they for perfect. The light all lite up but he didn't wear them for half an hour when one of the lighted shoes wasn't working anymore. We went to charge them come to find out the the USB port that charges it was broken. Oh well I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Good metal for the price.
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it's pretty baggy- more than I am used to in jumpers/ harem pants. I'm 5'5, 135lbs. Super comfortable so will order another one (or two) but will order a size down."
3.0,Beautiful dress. Got the largest size based on reviews and size chart but it did not fit.
3.0,"Very cute for my daughter's Halloween costume (Vampire Elsa), but it broke after the third wear even though she was gentle with it."
3.0,Smaller than expected but nice. Mine came a little tarnished.
3.0,was not as advertized
3.0,I thought reading reviews would help me pick my size but guess not lol. Definitely very baggy
3.0,The shoes were way to wide on foot. When I stepped the front of the shoes at the toe was not comfortable at all on the skin. I thought the shoes looked very cheap
3.0,"I got a size bigger which I’m glad I did because the sweaters run a lil smaller. The material is nice, graphics are cute."
3.0,Ome pair was great but the second pair was painful to ear!
3.0,Stocking stuffer
3.0,"Cute, trendy earrings at a great price.  Ended up returning as the rattan on one of the pairs was already coming loose.  Returns were free so I might end up purchasing again and see if I can get 4 wearable pairs without defects."
3.0,The shirt is great but the pants feel like paper literally! Faded out after 1st wash badly! Started to look like the paper you get your meat wrapped at the butcher's! Not good at all!
3.0,They rip at the wrist when pulling them on.
3.0,"Use only when on water.<br /><br />The back of the strap is very annoying when riding in the car. The strap gets caught on headrest and every time you turn your head your glasses will shift. Also, while walking in the woods, limbs and sticks will get caught in loop and rip off glasses. Would only recommend for open areas. They make a different product with adjustable straps. Going to try these."
3.0,"The fabric was soft but not satin, it was cute but not for women with curves"
3.0,I wish that I could say these boots were ideal they did not hold up very well and for very long sadly after 2 months the sole basically came apart from the rest of the boot and let in copious volumes of water it had been raining rather heavily several days prior beyond that the boots are actually rather comfortable they fit almost perfectly however I do believe that these boots have a significant amount of room for improvement
3.0,"Looks good. But a wee bit large. The material looks like thin vinyl, hence 3 stars."
3.0,"super cute style, good quality, lightweight but not flimsy, but cant just go by chest and waist measurements cuz i got a small (5'6"" 106lbs) and although the body fit well, the sleeves were waaaaay short. might fit a 5' and under person idk. returned. might try the size L"
3.0,"Quality is good but they are bigger than expected. The sizing chart is horrible as what I had to go off of was small, medium,  large for shoes... Not numbers!"
3.0,"This is a cute hat, but runs really small.  I have a pretty small head (I usually wear about 6 3/4 in hat sizes), but this barely fits my head - it keeps sliding up and popping off.  Really, it fits my 3 year old better and she does not have a large head either!"
3.0,Dress was much shorter than expected
3.0,"I'm obsessed with leopard print, but this product runs large."
3.0,Whoo. It gets hot in here. This is a cute top but don't wear it when it's over about 75 or you'll be a hot mess.
3.0,I kept these because they do resemble the picture but they infected my ears as they are not real silver or gold so if you have issues with &#34;fake&#34; jewelry don't order these. I had to give my ears a rest for a week after these because they were peeling and gross. Worse reaction I've had to jewelry since HS.
3.0,"frame too large for a small petite face, otherwise fine"
3.0,"It looks beautiful, my daughter likes it very much. I wear them almost every day at school. But within a few days, the handles on both sides fell, the insole inside came out, and the insole was thin. A bit disappointed！If the quality is better, it will be fine."
3.0,"cute, but Lily is usually a size XS to M depending the item, so I went with a size Large for US Medium, 4-6 which seems right, but it seems to be more a US size 3-5. Because she wasn't able to get the top button closed. I have a hunch this was made for asian women who typically aren't built like westerners. So if you have wider shoulder and larger boobs, size up further than you normally would. An XL might have fit Lily, but we will be choosing a different coat."
3.0,This is extremely tiny I couldn’t believe it. It was tiny. I know it says miniature in the description but wow. I ended up giving it to a friend.
3.0,Socks were a little shirt for knee socks. Compression not as tight as Jobst brand socks. Will wear on weekends when just hanging out. Liked the design.
3.0,"I would give the product 5 stars but after wearing it all day, it turned her skin black from the dyes rubbing off on her.  It wiped off in the shower but it still lost some of the design due to the bleeding."
3.0,"I ordered this in large and it was huge. Reordered in medium and fits how it should but it doesn’t wear well on me.<br />5’5” 140, 38C<br />Material is really thick and soft. But it clings to the fat roll."
3.0,"It feels like a nice sweater, the material is nice. However it is not put together extremely well. I can already see places where it is coming undone at the seams. But I'm just going to sew the seams before I wear it since it was so darn inexpensive."
3.0,Cute necklace but it came broken. I didn't really want to spend 30 minutes putting it back together.
3.0,Cute but wayyy too big
3.0,The dress is beautiful but was a bit disappointed by the fabric.
3.0,NOT A TRUE GARNET.  NOT THE DEEP COLOR OF GARNET.<br />LOOKS MORE LIKE A RUBY
3.0,"It is comfortable for indoor wear in winter. It is not think enough for cool winter outdoor. It is only 50% merino wool, and lossy woven. It is ok and I don’t recommend it to anyone."
3.0,"I was very excited to get my hoodie but was a little disappointed when it arrived. The first thing I see is the color. Bakugo X across the chest is red but the one on the hoodie is bright orange. That annoyed me before I even put it on. Then I tried it on. I don't care for the material and even though I measured myself and went by the chart, it's still too small."
3.0,"A very pretty floral print, but the dress has no shape and is somewhat short. Runs a tad big too. I wil have to put a belt around my upper waist with it to make it look cute enough to wear!"
3.0,The quality is good and the  top fit well but the waist was a little odd. It flared too high in my opinion. I added a thick belt and jean jacket and yiu ciuidnt tell.
3.0,Loved the color but the fit was really boxy.  The material was very thick too.
3.0,Side with the hook is a little short. Makes it hard to on because you cant twist it how you want. I had to add some chain onto it.
3.0,suited for the purpose it was bought for
3.0,"Order a size smaller ....this is big, looks like a dress on me at 5 foot 3."
3.0,Doesnt seem to do a thing for my sensory seeker. My ADHD 5 year old doesnt seem at all calmer it fits perfect as they say the collar is a little loose as one person pointed out but just doesnt do anything for him.
3.0,"First off, I did receive a lot of compliments when I wore this.  However, I assumed the neck area would be larger since it is hanging off of the models arms.  That was not the case.  Looked more like a poncho when I wore it.  It looked nice, but the picture is misleading."
3.0,"I returned this because I couldn’t get it to fit right and because one of the sides where the glasses attach to the hat would come out when I tried to adjust it. The idea is great, but it seems like the engineering of it needs a little tweaking."
3.0,"While this did dress fit, it was too much material and I could not get the dress to look good. The dress did seem made well, and it was comfortable. Too bad it just didn’t look great on me. Going to return it."
3.0,"The bracelet was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  Although it is very pretty, it weighs a lot lighter than expected.  When she took it out of the  box for the first time, one of the charms fell off.  Fortunately, my husband was able to reattach it, and my daughter wore it all day."
3.0,"I loved these on first sight and put them on right away. I have had them on an hour and there is already wear evident in the crotch area and a small hole. They aren't being stretched to the max, so that isn't the issue. I am hoping this is a fluke because I love the pattern, feel, and fit of these and want to buy tons more, but definitely won't if the quality is this poor."
3.0,The watch is a nice size but the light doesn't work very well. It's dim and doesn't light up the whole time display. I had to change the band also because it was a little tight.
3.0,"This is a pretty necklace...but the stone in the center of the snowflake does not have a lot of sparkle. If the stone was smaller it wouldn't be much of an issue. I really like it, but like I said the pendent I received lacks the sparkle which would greatly improve its looks. I do not know if all the stones lack the sparkle, or if I just received one of less quality. I received at a discount for honestly reviewing"
3.0,"cheap buckle construction (ratchet mechanism), but otherwise good"
3.0,"Love the style, however they run small. I think they are adorable and I make them work."
3.0,"looked great on pics, when i got not that good."
3.0,Look wise it’s good but stitches are too week to hold.
3.0,"The shoe itself is okay, but the small piece that controls the lights fell off in less than a week. From both shoes. My son was bummed but still wears them because they’re comfy and easy to put on."
3.0,"Fit a little bit small, really short. Glad I was already planning on wearing with leggings."
3.0,"This is such a cute set, I am a little bit more curvy and the size I ordered was my regular size but I would recommend sizing up if you have wider hips or a bigger chest like me. Very nice material, zipper is cheaply made but still functional. The pants are a bit long (I’m 5’7”) and I could probably use about an inch taken off. Overall good set for the price, just not the best stretch wise."
3.0,Had this product for about 2 weeks and then the<br />string at one of the end that holds the strands together<br />slipped off. I have yet to fix it. But it is nice looking.
3.0,Incredibly flimsy. No SUPPORT
3.0,This watch band rips out the arm hair on my wrist
3.0,One lense fit perfectly but the other did not. Oakley spyke. Visibility is clear and no issues.
3.0,"I wish I could give this product more stars but as someone who's a trip risk by nature - I have a hip imbalance from both neurological and skeletal issues - I found the lack of traction in the soles not just uncomfortable but potentially dangerous on bathroom floors. It's a shame; they fit well and I love the appearance, but if I fear a fall I can't wear a slipper like this! :( I wonder if the manufacturer could add some traction to the soles..."
3.0,Para mí tiene la correa muy corta
3.0,"See-through on the white bits. Cute, otherwise."
3.0,I thought this was going to be cool.... my wife took one look and me and literally laughed out loud and said she didn’t know she was going out with spider man.... :-/ .... so this shirt is now out of my  wardrobe.
3.0,Charms started falling off within a few hours of wearing it.
3.0,"They’re cute, they’ll work, they come with real earring backs instead of the cheap plastic things which is great so you can wear them right out of the box.  However, they are definitely not Swarovski and the stones on half of them are actually really dull and inferior to even most fake cheap gems.  They’ll work for my purposes because I didn’t need them to look particularly fancy, but I think for what they are they’re about three times more expensive then they should be.  However, it would truly take more time and trouble than it’s worth to return and I needed studs in a hurry so there’s that!"
3.0,not terrible not great and doesn't breathe
3.0,"The longer term accuracy is just barely tolerable for a modern electronic time base watch.  That said, it performs the stop watch function well.  Without included instructions, setting the time, date or alarm function is an exercise in lengthy frustration.  I kept pressing combinations until I got it to work.  Trying to turn the alarm ON and OFF is &#34;difficult&#34; ;-)"
3.0,Perfect for a very small child.  My 4 year old was to big for these.  But I love the buttons on them.
3.0,They are heavy on my ears and don’t look like the image they showed so please don’t get these
3.0,Just as expected nothing more ..
3.0,"They did the job they were meant to do, but atleast 6 were damaged either too sharp at the ball or they were broken. Really didn’t like that bc I now have to buy more but buying from a different company."
3.0,"Chain broke, but my daughter loves the charm."
3.0,Ok. Not a great dress
3.0,"A little small.  But overall, ok"
3.0,Product arrived on time.  Great value for the price.  I would use this vendor again.
3.0,"Nice jacket, very warm but after one washing there is a hole in one of the pockets."
3.0,"this dress is a pretty shape but was smaller than I expected. I have bought several similar dresses recently with elasticated waists and flown skirts, unfortunately this was not well sized, and the skirt not as flows as the picture showed. material is thin but not see through. I would suggest buying a size or maybe 2 up especially if you have a larger chest size."
3.0,Fits small somewhat
3.0,I like the watch.  The directions provided are for several style watches.  None of which looked like this one.<br />It took some time but I figured out how to set the digital time.  Otherwise a beautiful watch.<br />EDIT!!!  Watch stopped working shortly after I started wearing it.  Battery I suppose.  But it sucks all the same to have it stop working.
3.0,The fabric faded quite a bit after first wash (in cold water). Still very cute shirt.
3.0,"This is much, much smaller than the photo would lead you to believe. More suited for a petite woman or a junior."
3.0,"These are not what I expected; they're paper thin and aren't made very well. The button holes were still closed off, the zipper closure isn't sitting right, and there is no stretch. I had high hopes for these but, I just may be sending them back."
3.0,I have purchased two pair of these sunglasses.  They are light weight and have a smooth and accurate finish making them very comfortable to wear for prolonged periods.  The only issues I have with them is that the lenses scratch quite easily and the temple broke right next to the hinge on both pairs after a minor head impact.  Longevity would benefit from reinforcement of the hinge area.  Each pair lasted about 2-3 months.
3.0,"I am 5,2, 125lbs and my measurements are: chest 37in, waist 29in, hips 39in. I bought a medium<br /><br />I bought this suit to wear under my clothes while I go hiking. It fits just fine but it did give me a camel toe which is unpleasant. The shorts also rolled up while I tried it on and walked around with it. The color design was slightly off but I expected it because I looked through all the pictures, not just the modeled picture. The lining of this suit is also kinda weird. There’s only lining on half the suit. The top portion of the suit is lined in the breast area and the bottoms are NOT lined in the butt area. Because of all this I did return the suit and was never able to put it into action."
3.0,waist is also twisted
3.0,The inside zipper was super long and puckered at the top of the butt!
3.0,"I’m giving this 3 stars because it’s a cute set, and can be worn as lingerie once or twice but the bralette offered zero support and the straps were flimsy and had no stretch. The panties were cute and fit to size, but a very thin cheap material."
3.0,"Larger than expected, but super light weight."
3.0,I arrive with a noticeable stain but I hope it will be removed by washing it
3.0,The suit was made of excellent quality material but it was too small for me so I suggest getting a size up.
3.0,Maybe I have a size too large. I wear size 10. These are kinda lose and impossible to tighten. They're ok. Not an everyday all day shoe.
3.0,"Super cute, but broke the 2nd time she wore them"
3.0,"I only gave this 3 stars because the picture shows a pair, but you only get 1 piece not 2.  It is really super cute and I do love it, but it would be nice if you changed up the picture to show exactly what you receive.  The description does state that you only get one piece, but seriously why would you only want one?<br />I would have given this 5 stars if not for the fact that I had to order another one...."
3.0,The material is very thin and the sleeves are shorter than pictured.
3.0,Fit a bit larger and longer than expected. But it is comfortable.
3.0,"These are def toddler sized and material is a little flimsy, buttons not reinforced well.  Great concept, poor execution."
3.0,It's not what I expected for the sixes.  They are too small for a medium size.  It's too bad cuz o really like the colors.
3.0,"I ordered a large because in reading the reviews I got the impression that it would fit me good.  When I received it, it was super tight and I struggled a bit to get it on. I kept it because we were leaving to Cancun the next day. I would recommend an extra large for those who typically wear a large."
3.0,"This Torary shirt has a very pretty print. The shirt is black with a floral design. The flowers are pink, green, yellow and blue. The design can be casual or dressy. You can wear with jeans or under a jacket. The fabric is 100% polyester. There is a one button enclosure. It is comfortable. My only criticism is that it is a little cheap looking up close but great at a distance. For the cost, it is worth taking a look. 3.5 stars."
3.0,Nice quality but my husband preferred the Champion Powerblend hoodie instead for it has a better quality of material and fit than this Russell brand.
3.0,"Beautiful pattern and fit.  However, material was very cheap and sheer.  Also, was very wrinkly and had a lot of static.  If it had been made of nicer material I would've kept it."
3.0,"They are supposed to fit multiple sizes, but I found them to be quite uncomfortable around the middle."
3.0,"I can't wear it, there is no room for a bust and I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear, it is super cute though. So for reference XXXL/US 16 is to small for a 40C Bust."
3.0,Hard to rate here.. Product was flawless when I received it.. But I haven't even had it a month and it rusted super fast 😢 Bummer.
3.0,Was expecting leggings - but they are more like very thick tights.
3.0,The strap broke on it third week I had it. But for the price I paid not complaining. Just FYI. Tough bag weak strap
3.0,The stones on the necklace was very tiny dissatisfied with it.
3.0,"I am 5’3 220 with big boobs, waist sits high<br /><br />Bought two one arrived with a small hole"
3.0,"Definitely makes me look pregnant. Very nice material,  but I think you have to be small on top for it to lay properly. Which I am not."
3.0,cute. just lots the metal thing on band quickly
3.0,Well...I really really like this ring when I got and started wearing it.  Lots of sparkle and people commented on its beauty.  I like to wear some of my jewelry all the time and do not take it off.  This ring I did not take off.  The crystals on the side band fell off first.  Then little by little the small crystals around the larger stone started disappearing.  And then the silver wore off.  I wore it for approximately 3 months before I had to dispose of it.
3.0,"I like the style, it runs very very small. The sleeves are supposed to be long but on me, they are more like 3/4 sleeves. Also the material is not 100% cotton, so it does not breathe well. That's on me though, I should've checked the material before I bought. Over all, this tshirt looks ok, but I wouldn't buy another one."
3.0,"I followed the sellers size chart and ended up with pants that are 2 sizes too big. It was unfortunate since I really liked how they stretch and the black was very dark and not blueish.<br />After I washed them in warm water and tumbled dry on high, it shrank to the perfect size! Lol guess this will help if you need to shrink them or if you want to avoid shrinking them."
3.0,It ended up being way too small. It fits my six year old daughter perfect though.
3.0,"I'm don't like this item , looks to chip and look like if you getting off de nickel machine to absent,!!!"
3.0,"I like the product, but way too big for the small size we thought we ordered. She'll likely have to be closer to 1 before she can wear it."
3.0,Nice jacket but runs small
3.0,Cute but get a size smaller
3.0,"I like these slippers, but there isn't much padding or lining on the bottom. On carpet they are fine. Also, they are Huge. Not in fit, but the overall dimensions. They are cute, though. They freak my dogs out!!"
3.0,I thought it would be a thicker material since it's supposed to compress.
3.0,"Material isn't as soft as I wanted, but I think it will soften after I wash it. Quality is as expected for this price."
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, just nothing like the pictures. The cut is like a normal crew neck and the forearms are tight, which make the the arms from the shoulder to the elbow look puffy instead of &#34;oversized&#34;."
3.0,"I think if you are just wanting a suit to stand in the pool, sipping a drink, this suit would probably work well for that. I am a mom with a young kiddo and we like to play around in the pool together. I bought this suit, tried it on, but it made me nervous that my chest was going to be exposed if I really tried swimming and playing around in it. There’s not a lot of support in the suit for the chest. Cute bathing-suit though! Just not what I was looking for."
3.0,Ran smaller that expected.
3.0,"Comfortable, nice fit, but the strap keeps coming a loose, its quite embarrassing when you're out and the strap pops out of the hook and you have to ask your daughter to come to the bathroom with you to help fix it; its time consuming when you're putting it on and the strap keeps coming out of the hook, then you have to twist it in such a way to keep the strap in, I've never had to fight with a bra strap;"
3.0,I ordered these on 3/19/18 and finally received them on 5/7/18.  I ordered the large based on my measurements as I wanted a jean a little bit looser than a skinny jean. However they fit like a skinny jean. They are not loose except in the waist. They are made from a stretchy jean fabric so there is some give on them.
3.0,I bought these to replace the daith ring in have now that’s a loop. I couldn’t get them in all of the way. I think the post is a little too short.
3.0,"The fabric and colors of the dress are beautiful.  Unfortunately, the sizing is not correct.  I wear a size 16 and the XXL is obviously made for flat-chested ladies.  Not many flat-chested women in a size 16 out there.  ON another review, a lady showed pictures of her breasts barely contained in the dress.  Same for me.  Not even a camisole was going to save this one. Too bad."
3.0,Cheaply made. Back heel part digs into my daughters heel she won't wear them. Tell me it hurts. Don't waste your money.
3.0,"Straps were terrible, they’re a stretchy spandex strap so if you have bigger boobs be careful because they’ll weigh down the straps and you’ll be flashing everyone. The zipper is very very cheap and bunches in the back. It’s a beautiful dress, if those two things were changed it would be a perfect dress."
3.0,Exactly what you would expect for the price.  You will need a different chain
3.0,"Love the thinness of the band and how it feels on the wrist, but color is only superficial.  After only a few weeks, the black around the buckle is rubbing off and natural brown of leather showing."
3.0,"It’s like the over the shoulder piece fit great but the top itself was way to big, much larger than the modeled pic. I wear a 34DDD-G bra and it was to big for me."
3.0,The size was more like a girls size rather than women's. It was very cute and ended up giving it to a friend that is 8 inches shorter than me and smaller in every way. I'm 5'9&#34; and a size 28 Jean and ordered a large.
3.0,"The dress has a short torso, so the ""waist"" hit me at my bra band and hung weird, and the waistband is a rough, uncovered elastic band. It's just not a comfortable dress."
3.0,Could not even try them on so tight.
3.0,"it is kinda larige, i am busty and have curves and could have gone a size down"
3.0,Thought I bought hospital Sox.  Too narrow and tight for after hip surgery.  Need extra wide and loose fitting.
3.0,I really hoped this one would fit the same as Fensace Women's sleveless scoop neck.  But it runs smaller.
3.0,"It's shorter than expected.  The back V does not reach the top if my pants so it isn't appropriate to wear to work<br />without an under shirt.  The color is darker than expected, but still a very nice color and matches the pants I was<br />attempting to coordinate.  Wish it was longer ~ however I am 5'10 with a long torso so it may work well for others."
3.0,runs SMALL
3.0,"Beautiful shoe, very comfy but too large. I wear 9 but I am certain 8bor 8.5 would've been perfect. I gave them a way to a relative. I ordered two pairs, different colors, same size 😂"
3.0,It was ok. I will wear it but it FITS... if you wear a shirt underneath it needs to fit tight to you. I am 5' and 128 lb.
3.0,Slightly tight across chest and stomach area and I am a size 4.  Pay attention to sizing
3.0,Ears itched after one day
3.0,"Packaging: Bracelet is packaged in a thin plastic sealed bag.<br /><br />Usability: The stainless steel clasp is hard to open. I had to use a pen cap to pry it open as using my fingers hurt (and I was unable to pull it open). Closing the clasp is not an problem.<br /><br />Quality: Multi-strand leather bracelet with stainless steel clasp.<br /><br />Effectiveness: I really like the look of this, but wearing it is another matter. My main issue with this bracelet is the difficulty in opening the clasp. Also, the charms and pieces aren't fixed in place and will slide all over the place, which means that the bracelet doesn't lay flat. The beads and key kept sliding around to the underside of my wrist which made it uncomfortable when I was typing on the computer or needed to set my wrists on the counter.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. I'm not paid by the company or affiliated in any way. Any thoughts on this product are my own."
3.0,Is ok as expected.
3.0,This isn’t what I expected… it’s very much like a workout type/sports bra material and is stretchy. It’s not really breathable.
3.0,"This doesn't expand .. this is not spandex or polyester like the compression wear are (supposed) to be in general. It looks decent enough and thankfully is not too small for me (wear a shorts on top so as to not show my b.crack when i squat/bend), so i wear it once in a while when it is cool enough."
3.0,Breaking too quickly
3.0,"These are beautiful but the ""posts"" are way too thick and are uncomfortable.  Can't wear them for very long without hurting."
3.0,"I returned due to the stiffness.  It would probably soften up quickly; however, I would rather buy shoes comfortable right at the start."
3.0,These are cute on but very difficult to close.<br />I would not buy them again
3.0,"Meh. It wasn't the soft feel I was looking for, more like a coat with a perm. The inside was jersey, not sherpa either. It was boxier than I'd hoped, but it's okay for WFH, I guess."
3.0,"This skirt is nothing to rave about. It was made of a lighter jersey knit than I expected, therefore you can see light through it when the sun is behind you."
3.0,"These fit fairly well, although the liners did pucker a bit. I am returning as the material (in black at least) is too shiny and looks a bit cheap."
3.0,"This belt gets 5 stars for style, 2 stars for function. It refuses to stay at the desired position I want. Perhaps when it softens up it will perform better. I would buy it again just because its so good looking!"
3.0,Earrings did not match.
3.0,It’s no bad but no
3.0,"Nice soft material, fit well, but the waist band rolls down. I’ve had them on for about 15 mins and keep having to pull them up"
3.0,Looked amazing. Was excited to get it but returned it because it was broken on arrival
3.0,"This cross was too large and very cheap looking. It almost looked like tin or a gum machine prize.  No way I'd wear it nor ever give as a gift. However, the chain was beautiful, expensive looking, and very dainty. So I give the chain 5 stars but since the cross gets one star, that makes my rating 3 stars. I do plan to buy another cross for this lovely chain. 😊"
3.0,"Each hat is a little different. They appear to be made out of different materials. I’m not sure if these are wool at all. It says that they are wool in the description and doesn’t mention anything about any other materials. There aren’t any tags or information at all in the package. They come in a food saver type packaging, airtight plastic. For the price, they are pretty good. I paid $22 for four hats. There aren’t any instructions on care included in the package either. Nice to have them around in the car and since they are so inexpensive I don’t have to worry about losing them. Either way the material is soft and the size of the hat is what I was looking for. I didn’t want something that fit tightly to my head and sort of slouched down over my ears. So they work! Wool or not."
3.0,Vivid colors but disappointed it is white on the back.
3.0,"Looks weird, too short"
3.0,I gave this outfit a 3 stars because the pants were stained and I had to use stain remover and wash it twice before the black marks semi faded from the fabric on the behind part of the pants. Had it come clean it would have gotten 5 stars.
3.0,Gave away I normally wear a Medium but got Large due to material.<br />Not true to size.
3.0,Dress fits but is see through. You can use it for a beach cover up but not otherwise.
3.0,"The product is cute and serves its purpose for fashion. For those of us looking for protection and fashion, I suggest wearing a medical mask underneath. The mask is just mesh with the rhinestones on it so no you are not double masking. It will serve its purpose for my anniversary party with a white medical mask underneath."
3.0,"This looks super cute and is a nice shade of orange. However, this may unravel on you. I don't know if the catalyst to this unraveling was  washing it but the belt part of this started to unravel terribly.<br /><br />A waste ...pass"
3.0,"The glasses look great and the yellow lenses are clear.  However, I thought these would work better for night driving vision -but was disappointed!  I didn't notice much of a difference.  Maybe a slight decrease in headlight glare, but not enough to get rid of those halos around the lights or improve my night vision problems."
3.0,"Loved the style and fabric.  In fact, these were exactly what I wanted except they are too small.  I wear 6.5 or 7 shoes, and these crush my toes"
3.0,If you have thick thighs this its not going to fit you it's going to fit small it's going to suffocate your thighs other than that it's a very cute design
3.0,I love the print it it seems a bit bigger than I thought it would be. Should have went a size smaller but other than that I am very pleased.
3.0,The ring looks good and fits well however the 90 degree bevel where the gold is tends to catch on my pocket and digs into my fingers (granted I have big hands).<br />To wear on occasion it is perfect but I prefer not to wear it on a daily basis so I ordered another ring.
3.0,"It's a neck gaiter... nothing overly special or motorcycle centric.<br /><br />No insulative properties at all. As others have mentioned, it will help with wind- and sun-burn, but that's about it. Works well as masking for being out in public during the 'rona, although it has a tendency to cause fogging on any glasses you may be wearing.<br /><br />Not overly elastic: it only stretches so far. On the plus side it's not stretching out, but it is definitely a tight fit."
3.0,"I think it is more form fitting than expected, would have liked a looser fit but thats just me! It is a great shirt, soft and comfortable fabric!"
3.0,"Wish they weren't as bulging as they are, since wearing them is incredibly uncomfortable at times. The fidget area pinches my skin sometimes that it even bleeds. Got them my size and it barely fits me. Definitely size up!"
3.0,Could not even get this over head. Great color but has no stretch. Sent it back before I took a picture
3.0,Fit was somewhat small. Wrinkles VERY easily & not easily removed! Would not buy again.
3.0,I have been looking for a pair of blue earrings. The pendant looks a bit plastic and the medal is silver plated so I am not sure how long the plating will last. Other than that I like them
3.0,I ordered bracelet about 2 weeks ago and a gem has already fell out of it. But overall the love bracelet is very pretty and fits very well. I just wish the gems didn’t fall out as easy.
3.0,Not happy with product overall
3.0,"This sunglass clip appears to be of good quality, but alas, it does not fit on my type of frames. I have modern, plastic frames (such as shown in photo) and the top hooks won't fit around the thick temple, so the clip is basically useless. I carefully measured the lens size and the sunglass lens would cover perfectly if the top hooks were relocated to the outer top of the lens rather than the sides."
3.0,Pin on the band broke within 2 weeks
3.0,"Very thin material but in a good way, low cut and sparkly. Great for date night.  Got a 5x for my wife and it did fit but not in a way she liked. She said best to size it up by at least 1, especially if you are well endowed in the chest area. Her friend tried it on, and it fit perfectly as she normally wears a 3x. Straps could be better attached."
3.0,"No paperwork/directions?<br />Something seemed a little off,but it seems to work fine."
3.0,Watch was fine but the band was small. I ended up giving it to a 4th grader. It came with extra battery which was a bonus.
3.0,"These are a good quality but if you have large calves the tops are entirely too tight to be comfortable after a few hours. The shoe and ankle fit are appropriate, but as you move up the leg above ankle they are no where near as comfortable/wearable or sized as several other brands I have tried. Not the fault of the sock, but if you are short and stocky vs tall and skinny...  go bigger or look elsewhere"
3.0,I was a little a disappointed because the thread on the hem unraveled a couple days after the boys wore them. Otherwise the boys liked them.
3.0,Had to returned it it was bigger than I thought
3.0,No me encantan el cierre es inseguro y se pueden perder con facilidad
3.0,They are nice the post are a little flimsy tough.
3.0,Not stainless steel. Don’t shower with them as they will brown or rust
3.0,It will be fine for around the camp-fire; but definitely not something that I would wear to go to the store.
3.0,"These boxers were packaged well and not damaged during shipping.  Shipping times took a little long, but this was over the Christmas holiday.  There are four boxers in this pack and I chose the black color.  I ordered these with the impression they were made of silk because of the company name.  These are not made of silk at all and the fabric feels like cotton.<br /><br />The sizing is slightly off.  I wear size large and according to their chart ordered an xxl for Asian sizing.  The boxers fit on the waist, but are not very roomy overall.  The crotch area is very tight and don’t leave much room for the boyz.  I also don’t care for the double button fly.  This is not needed I’m my opinion and is one more button to worry about using the restroom. The final thing I did not care for was that they don’t extend down my thigh very far.  I’m not incredible hulk as far as my leg muscles go, but boxer briefs should extend down on my thigh more.<br /><br />Overall I’m not raving about these boxers.  I really believe that since this product is made and marketed for the Asian market the boxers are lacking in several areas.  In my opinion they need some tweaking for the US market to be successful.  Hopefully this review is helpful for the company to look at for the future upgrades and to the consumer thinking of buying these boxers.  I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review."
3.0,The band is very nice and it gives your Gear S3 classic a professional look. The band practically looks like it should come with the watch! The only grip I do have is that the band comes undone multiple times per day. It seems that one of the release clasp is very sensitive when I move my wrist suddenly. It is annoying but overall I do like the band.
3.0,"The feel is this leather is nice, but the whole reason I bought this wallet over something that was a quarter the price was because it claimed to be thinner than other wallets. If it lasts 10 years, it will be worth it, but otherwise it was overpriced."
3.0,To big - returned.
3.0,"ordered a small based on the reviews (I'm 5'5 125lbs) and I regret it. they are tighter than I like, but for now I'm using it as motivation to get slimmer. The design is ok - I do like the thinner material so that they aren't too hot to wear."
3.0,small in the bust area
3.0,"The buckle is from a very cheap plastic, and with the very light use i give to the watch it is already chipped."
3.0,"Ordered this item great price, made well and looks good but it is a little bulky and it feels uncomfortable at least it did for me."
3.0,It's kind of cheap feeling. But it works.
3.0,Noted above.
3.0,Color and quality are decent. Lettering wasn’t greatest quality. Good customer service!
3.0,"Ring design looks exactly as pictured, barring the ruby is not as bright, it’s a dull raspberry color rather than a dark clear cherry. It fits as expected."
3.0,"These earrings looks very well made,sturdy.. I really like the catch on them --they line up well, and I do not fear losing them.  I am disappointed tho, they are not GREEN, which is what I ordered.  They have a speckled gold look.  I will keep them, but, not sure I will order anything  else from the company."
3.0,"When I first got them they were stiff and had a little extra material around the sides. the band next to the toe kept rubbing into me and feltlike it would cut into me but I just gave it a small trim and delt with it. I eventually decided to use them on the treadmill to break them in and now they fit perfectly. As in no cutting into my foot or nothing. If you asked me if they were worth buying I would say..... yes, yes they were. I hope this helps you out because in the end it's your decision to make."
3.0,"There are no tags for washing instructions.  The material is strange. Bought shirts the same size and one is<br />too big.  The other fits fine. I missed the return by one day, my shirts are archived."
3.0,"Más o menos me gusto, pero si esta bonita"
3.0,Extremely thin so I sleep in it and it is soooo comfortable.  Being huge isn't a problem.  And it is huge.
3.0,I purchased the navy xl. Very see through for me. I will wear at home but not to the gym. Not squat proof for me.
3.0,"They do the job. Took some time for my eyes to get use to for sure. They r pretty large height wise, so if u like that, then u will deff like these. They are a cheaper quality. Like so light and would break easily. For the price they aren’t bad. They work. I do like the white n black print design on them."
3.0,they wear well
3.0,I did not like the snap. It should have been magnetic
3.0,A little awkward to use.. nice size to carry in purse.
3.0,Too gold
3.0,"Glasses are a great idea but very small for an average head size, even using extenders"
3.0,"I'm happy to have a new hat that I will be wearing every day, but it's not exactly what I thought i was going to get and was left disappointed when opening the package and seeing the buttons on it were not the anchor buttons like in the picture. What lead me to want to buy this hat in the first place was the nice rope design on the front, but most importantly were the buttons as I wanted some sailor moniker on the hat, since it's not there I feel like I didn't get what I wanted.<br /><br />Beware of this product."
3.0,"Ordered a ""Piper "" received a ""Cora"".  So its a $10 necklace but I would still expect to get the correct one.  The necklace itself is not bad. The name is clear and well polished the chain is about what I would expect at this price point and the clasp is too. It comes nicely packaged in a little brown box. Would easily be gift able if you can get the correct name.<br />Meaning I think it will last but definitely not a high end piece.  Too bad my teen liked it but we have no use for Cora.<br /><br />Hopefully you found this review helpful"
3.0,"The bracelet is pretty, but it's a little small"
3.0,Dont bother buying.. its just 2 little bungee cords.
3.0,"When these slippers first arrived, I was hopeful.  I used to buy Tempur-pedic slippers of the same style but I could not find them in my size.  The reviews seemed positive so I ordered them.  When I first wore them, they were soft and comfortable.  I was pleased.  I've now had them for five days and the cushioning is gone.  The heel foam has completely compressed so the cushion is gone.  It feels like I'm walking on the rubber sole alone.  I guess the people that gave 5 stars never wore Tempur-pedics. Then again, you can't expect these slippers to be like $70 Tempur's."
3.0,Fabric was a little bit on the cheap side
3.0,"Very beautiful earrings; however, if you are like me and a little OCD, this item isn't for you.  The four sizes of rings and loose and they change positions instead of staying in size order.  Other than that, they are gorgeous."
3.0,It fit too big. But I love it!
3.0,"I love the sweater, but the sleeves are actually 3/4 not long sleeve"
3.0,Seems to run big but it works
3.0,Very cheap fabric. But it's OK anyways.
3.0,ok.  I was expecting more fulness.  It seemed like it was done from scraps.
3.0,only good for small calves
3.0,Not.bad
3.0,"I generally buy shirts one size larger to accommodate my ""girls"" and I did the same with this purchase. Unfortunately, this bodysuit fits like I'd expect a medium to fit which means that it would be better to go up TWO (2) sizes for this bodysuit to fit comfortably if you also have to accommodate the ""girls"" the way I do. If this is not an issue for you, I suggest that you go up one size since the bodysuit is, indeed, a skinny bodysuit. Material is good, though thin, but not see through for dark colors. I can't speak on light colors in regard to transparency. I like the way it's designed which is a downer that I couldn't keep it due to size issue."
3.0,"I'm not sure what kind of stainless steel these are made of, but it's not the stainless kind. Completely rusted in 6 months above the waterline in a marine environment. Yes I know these are sold as keychains; yes we prefer 316 on boats. But they are advertised as 304 and 304 should not rust this quickly. I'll keep them as keychains (lifetime supply - I don't do crafts) but I don't like misleading listings."
3.0,The arms are really tight where they roll up.
3.0,"This product was ok. Not the same quality as my real PINK hoodie. Material is not the same, but close. However, seller guaranteed this was official PINK product. I don’t think it is. Seems to be an excellent knock off. Also does not hang/fit on me like my other hoodie.  Glad they had the color I wanted but quality was not the same. That is the reason for 3 stars. Seller was quick to ship however."
3.0,Very nice style and soft material but I was shocked to see makeup all over it. Return item? I had to wash it.
3.0,They are nice. But you can't really tell what the design is because they're small.  (And I have the 00 size)<br />I haven't worn them ever because they don't really stand out.  Will probably return them.
3.0,"I absolutely loved this waist trainer at first. The length fit my torso perfectly. I was obsessed. But about a month in, one of the bones popped. After about two months all the bones are broken. I would love to purchase again just for the fit and price, I just don't know if it's worth it for a couple months?"
3.0,"great color, nice fit on top, but crazy long!"
3.0,These are not true compression socks but comfortable to wear.  I would order them again for daily use unless you have a problem with water at your ankles.
3.0,It is beautifully manufactured but is too small for adults.
3.0,Nice solid made wallet but only holds about 8 cards could be a little bigger and room to put money inside instead of the outside to easy for bills to fall off. just use for credit cards and a money clip to keep cash seperate from cards. good product but could be better
3.0,Too small for me and the material is the same as gym shorts. These do not come close to my gaiters used on deployments.
3.0,"Initially I loved this dress. I steamed it carefully and tried in- the neck line was very loose, almost misshaped. It was short and sheer. Material and pattern- beautiful and if I were 23 I’d keep but I’m 40 and it’s just not “mom” appropriate"
3.0,"First off, I love the colors! Shipping took awhile for this item.  It looks cute enough but it is pretty cheap.  I bought an xl I’m 5’7 and wanted it to be baggy, it is for sure.  The legs were really long and the arms were not..  I’ve had it about a week and I’ve worn it maybe three times and the arm pit area already ripped on one side. It is cozy and warm for cooler days.  One thing I really don’t like is there is a zipper on the back by the butt area, it’s uncomfortable when you sit on a hard surface like a bench, it’s fine when you sit on a soft couch or a bed. It’s a fun outfit just not 100% what if hoped for."
3.0,"Bought for a costume and will work fine for that purpose. Read the sizing, runs very small"
3.0,It's a little big even though I can adjust it with the strings in the front. I love the colors. I will definitely wear it over my swim suit on vaca!!!
3.0,"I ordered this double teardrop navel ring in attempt to find something a little more petite and subtle in design, but I was mistaken. Overall the quality is great stainless steel and the threading is good, it's just a lot bulkier than I was anticipating and I'm not a fan of how the top teardrop threads in. The package was delivered on time and even came with a gift navel ring attached to it one I purchased so that was a nice surprise. I'm honestly probably more inclined to wear the free gift navel ring than the one I actually ordered."
3.0,The clasp get caught on itself when you are trying to adjust it.
3.0,"Material is stiff, will not order this again."
3.0,"All of them look rather good,(smaller than I anticipated) but the clicker ring was stuck in my nose, I had to use wire cutters to open it again after finagling it for a few days in a row. So not the best quality, but also not the worst I’ve had. If you’re looking for some cheap septum jewelry, this works fine. Just be careful (:"
3.0,I bought this shirt for a friend’s birthday party. I am pregnant so I bought an XL. It fit like a medium so I chose to return it. The seller refunded me and let me keep the shirt. I really appreciated this. The shirt will fit me when I’m back to my pre-pregnancy size so I will use it.
3.0,"UPDATE: This is a problem that no longer applies, because it has been corrected:<br />This watch is not ""Water-resistant to 165 feet (50 M)"". The watch should be removed every time you wash your hands. Other similar models have the 50-M rating for a couple dollars more. I complained to the seller, but they said the incorrect description was not their fault."
3.0,"The hat is nice, but the bill is small.  When worn it looks like it should be on a kids cap.  Fortunately, my father did not care.  I am the critical one, but my daughter who is 11 is the one who told me to take it back it looks too small.  My father kept it and does wear it."
3.0,"These are nice, tight fitting, work-out tank tops. They don't seem like they work for shapewear. I sized up to XXL based on reviews, and they fit nicely but offer no compression. Seems breathable, nice material- but definitely not shape wear."
3.0,I'm a size 4-6 dress and the small was too small. Plus the v neck is ridiculously wide. You would definitely need to wear something underneath. Sending back and not bothering to try a larger size.
3.0,"It was exactly as pictured i got the white one, but it looks like a lab coat on me lol. But nice Fabric and very fast shipping"
3.0,Not as nice as I thought. Gave it away. Hard to see detail.
3.0,It fell apart within a few days of wearing. Disappointed.
3.0,"They are great quality but a little stiff then other socks, maybe it the high thread count."
3.0,"The case feels tinny, especially if you tap it or the glass, but the quartz movement is silent like a ninja! I think the lug width should be smaller like 18mm instead of 20 to make the beautiful white dial pop even more, especially on a nato strap"
3.0,The dress is just as in the picture.  Fits well.
3.0,Good size for my young kids (2 & 4). They are hard to adjust and unfold.
3.0,"I received the beanie today, and the orange pom-pom on the top of the hat is not only coming off, but there is a good amount of hard glue. I'll just glue it myself, because it's a cute beanie and it fits."
3.0,"Out of the box, prints smelled like gasoline and stuck together. Not the best quality but smelled fine after a wash in the machine."
3.0,It’s too small . Fits a skinny person or a teenager . Gifted it to my 17 year old niece . A tad disappointing .
3.0,Ordered this for my 7 month old niece. She’s pretty small so this fit a little big but that was expected! My only issue is that I ordered the black with sunflowers and received the white with sunflowers. But still happy with the purchase overall!
3.0,"Buckle is great, but belt probably uses really crappy leather since it fell apart after a year or two.  I still think ratchet belts are extraordinary, just do yourself a favor and try to find better belt material."
3.0,"I like this strap, but the magnet doesn't seem strong enough, kept dropping my watch. For some this might be perfect,just not for me."
3.0,Could use a redesign. It’s clumsy
3.0,white pants are very sheer.
3.0,bra does not fit well fabric stretches too much
3.0,"The color on these is great. The fit is nice they are really comfortable. However, these are not squat proof. You can see right through them!"
3.0,Cheap contruction and designed badly. The strap placement causes the bag to deform after using for only a few days.
3.0,"Instead of receiving the colors that we chose, we received 5 black ones 🤷‍♀️ Other than that they were good."
3.0,Buy a size bigger than you normally would and be prepared for it not to feel like a normal t-shirt. Design is cute and color is good but it fits weird on the body.
3.0,"The watch strap is cheap but its easily to replace, overall the mechanisms did not fail on me."
3.0,More for fashion than warmth. Thinner material than I thought.
3.0,"A little big which is good but on the safe side, I'm not drying this. Seems like it could shrink so easily. Love the color!"
3.0,I am 5'3 this skirt goes down to my knees.
3.0,So this dress is gorgeous but it is HUGE....I ordered a medium according to their size chart and the dang thing is at least an XL...I mean sheesh not even close....
3.0,Dress design is nice but a little too big on the top and too thin. Im going to keep it and alter it by adding lining and taking it in at the top.
3.0,The quality is not good. already broken
3.0,Too thin.  Not what I expected.
3.0,I liked it but it’s uncomfortable to wear if you are going to a club and want to dance all night long.
3.0,The “H” fell off and I can’t figure how to get it back on 😞
3.0,These fit my Flak 2.0 frames nicely but seems like the coating runs off fairly easily. I've only had them for about 4 months and the coating has stated to rub off right in the middle of the lenses right in the line of sight.<br />I don't drop my glasses very often but do store them in the sunglasses holder of my car unsure if they will hold up to the daily wear and tear.
3.0,Very comfortable and warm the only compliate is the seems started splinting after a month of use
3.0,Cute but doesn’t work for me. Too small and too curved. Returned.
3.0,"I love the color, but I should have listened to other reviewers who state this shirt is very large. I ordered one size up. I could have just stayed with my normal size and it still would have room. I like the fabric and it is very comfortable."
3.0,Used the product to old my work keys. It’s not bad if you are looking to use it for something along those lines.
3.0,The details get lost and they don't look as nice as in the pictures
3.0,"Comfortable fabric, but please order one size down, the designer doesn’t allow you to wear this oversized and look cute. Must size down"
3.0,It is not secure.  The magnet is not strong enough to keep the watch around the wrist.
3.0,started tuning a copper color after only 2 weeks
3.0,"I know these are supposed to be a little on the snug side but unless you want your circulation practically cut off, you should probably order two sizes bigger than you usually wear."
3.0,Snug all around but long enough to wear as a mini dress
3.0,I ordered a size larger than my usual size and it was a little big but not so big that I had to return it.
3.0,Waist was too tight and wouldn’t zip up. I’m 5’3 weight 120
3.0,Is no good at all
3.0,Cute but very thin. It does not look like it will last.
3.0,Fits a little smaller than most other brands i currently have tried.
3.0,They’re nice but for the price I was expecting them to be a better quality and they look bit flimsy to me and the quality isn’t as good not worthy the money!
3.0,Pretty small but good quality
3.0,This is so cute and makes the fitbit look like a bracelet. LOVE IT!!!! The only issue is the silver and gold fit the band tightly but pink is a little too loose.
3.0,Could not reorder
3.0,"For the price, they are okay."
3.0,Holds sunglasses well just a little to thick feels heavy around your neck
3.0,"The material is different then it looks in the picture.  Its a bit frumpy and wrinkles like crazy. Not sure how I feel about it. I guess somewhat disappointed, but I dont hate it. Somewhat on the fence. I wouldn't buy another and thinking about returning it. Definitely not see though which is good."
3.0,"The Horween quality leather is very good. However, the edges of my watch band were not properly burnished and have begun to separate and flare out after less than a week of office wear. While I like the appearance of the band, I am under the impression that this band will not last as long as the price suggests it should."
3.0,"I love Swarovski.  The earrings and the necklace was very nice, and I am sure I will enjoy wearing them.  On the other hand the bracelet was quite disappointing.  Oh it matched the other jewelry perfectly, It was just way to small for an adults wrist...  Guess I will be giving it to my 5 year old niece.  It will fit her perfectly!"
3.0,"I ordered what the picture showed, but got something completely different.  And for a large it was amazingly small.  I'm 5'8"" and 180.  It was pretty well stretched to the max."
3.0,2 sets of the earrings didn't come with a match which was upsetting and the colors weren't the same as the picture.
3.0,I love the fitting and print but the zipper was already broken when I got it. :(
3.0,its not all that its a cheap accessory keep it in a box when not wearing to preserve the chain
3.0,"Good sizes, but I don't think they'll last long. The backs are pretty flimsy."
3.0,to big.
3.0,I'm 5'4 and 189 lbs. I thought I got the X-large but it doesn't fit like it. I have a round bottom and hips. The tops fit fine but the pants are too small. If you have curves you might not fit the pants and the pants are super short. If you could see the back you would definitely see my crack. This is more for the skinny girls or smaller than 189 lbs. I'm going to wear another pair of pants with it because I love the way the tops look.
3.0,Stones are vastly smaller than they appear in the picture.  Additionally their color is duller.<br /><br />Still will make a good gift for a 10yo girl studying the solar system in school.
3.0,"First off it took over a week pass the original expected date. This product is both too small and too big at the same time. In the photo they appear to be cheeky on the model, mine were not. I got the largest size cause i got a big butt. They were snug but not cheeky at all, which is weird. I like to show a little ass. These completely covered everyhting. At the same time they were so snug that I could barely notice the scrunch in the back. My ample ass stretched it out that much. But I was really wanting them to be cheeky and show that ass everyone likes to see. I ended up cutting off the leg seams which allows them to ride up some and show the cheeks. I will buy another pair."
3.0,first the chain its cheap thin and not very durable second its way to small smaller then the image listed with the measurement now if im going to buy jewlery im going to make sure i pay what something is worth and not a greedy penny more and im sorry but i most definintly would not be paying over $75.00 for this the price of over 100 this does not even come any where near that in price considering its not real silver or real gold
3.0,"Super cute, but felt awkward due to the underside of the heart being so flat"
3.0,"Bought these socks as a gift for my boyfriend. They were just okay, the material was cheap and thin so I wouldn’t expect them to actually keep your feet warm. and the imagery was a tad bit faded compared to the picture."
3.0,it was really hard to get this ring into my nose because of it's shape
3.0,"Very small, especially for what i paid.  Found better one at sporting goods store for less than 4 dollars.  The size was for a 4 or 5 year old."
3.0,"Cute hat, trendy"
3.0,It hurst a bit
3.0,Great to pull on in morning if you aren’t working and it’s acceptable if you have to answer the door!
3.0,I wasn’t very crazy about the style and look. It was pretty snug and I ordered my normal size. And it usually fits with this clothing line. But this was uncomfortable and snug in different places. I had to return it. The sweater was also very warm. Too warm. Like a wool.
3.0,Runs very small.  The hoody it self seems like nice quality.  Not sure if I'm keeping it because of the fit.
3.0,Good for the price.  Nothing extraordinary but definitely durable and fits well.
3.0,Runs small. I sized up and still could have gone bigger. Nice quality otherwise.
3.0,buttons on it are small and not very sturdy
3.0,"This shirt is made from soft breathable materials.  It really is a pleasure to wear.  The shirt also has a nice fit that isn't baggy or super tight, and is right in the middle.<br /><br />With that being said, this shirt is way too short.  It barely hits the belt line.  If you are under 5'7&#34; and wear an XL, this might be a 5 star shirt for you"
3.0,"Super cute, but wayyyy to big! I'm normally a m-l but after reading the reviews I ordered an XL, especially since I'm pregnant. Still WAY to big. I will be ordering another one, but probably a M."
3.0,"I've purchased 2 pairs of these and both had the leather button-catch rip thru after a few months. They were quite nice while they lasted, but will buy ones with better leather in the future"
3.0,Small size- didn't stretch.  Tail was short.  Didn't look as nice as photo.
3.0,Does what it needs to do. The strap isn't easily adjustable which gets annoying. Bag is super stiff but workable.
3.0,If your looking for the spandex dress this is NOT IT. This it a very sheer poly blend with no give and a zippered back. It's very pretty but not what I was looking for I have one in white and wanted another color... Not the dress in the picture by any means.
3.0,Chain broke twice granddaughter was broken hearted.
3.0,Heavy fabric though it is synthetic. Shirt hangs on the arms oddly.
3.0,Too tight. Runs small. Not flattering in the stomach area.
3.0,"I do like the quality of these nose rings. They do not cause me any irritation, and I like that there is a flat back on them. They are easy to put in, and very clean, simple, and easy to hide the ends. The problem with these nose rings is how very wide they are. Unless your piercing is very high up on your nostril, they are going to hang out rather far, which if you like that look is okay, but for me personally I prefer a more closed look to my rings. So while these are good quality, I wish the rings were smaller.<br /><br />I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The thoughts and opinions expressed are 100% my own. I always thoroughly test products before leaving reviews, if there's an issue with what I got, you're gonna know. ;)"
3.0,"Wow, I still haven't been able to get them in. They are small - that's not the problem. The opening is so tight. I even had someone try for me. I will let you know if I am successful. Doubtful at this point."
3.0,Small and very light. If you looking for just to fit your drinks and some strech band definitely. But whole outfit and hair products nope. Not at least mine.
3.0,Not a good color match. The red is a little too light. It works as advertised.
3.0,its a hat
3.0,"This fit me sooooooo weird. Most of the one piece suits are in Asian sizes. After reading reviews, I ordered it in a medium. The quality was pretty good but the fit was odd. If you are a curvaceous gal and or just have big boobs than I think this one is for you. It was too long (never happens to me) and the boob department was way to big (always happens to me).<br /><br />For reference: I am 5'8, 140lbs, size A<br /><br />Medium was too long and overall too large."
3.0,Cute but sheds A LOT !
3.0,These earring are cut but will also tarnished over time with everyday wear
3.0,These are nice shirts but run larger then normal. My husband wears them occasionally but the baggy look isn’t what we were going for. Especially when he has to wear them under work shirts.
3.0,"It's a simple watch for the ones who don't care much abt the appearance, but the main reason I bought this was because my mother is allergic to metal band watches."
3.0,Super cute but more of a midi ring. Bought as a gift so I didn't mess around too much with the fit.
3.0,"Seems like good quality material, nice and thick. Unfortunately they are at least a size too small for me, so I would recommend going up a size."
3.0,"I love how this robe looks, but the stitching is super weak. I almost ripped the hood right off when I missed the sleeve, with little force. It is a cheap fleece material rather than terry cloth, but it is warm. I would recommend it, with a few warnings. I wear mine a lot as it is my new lounge robe, but I do wish it was made better. May the force be with all of you."
3.0,"Nice fabric, good color, but ran very small.  reordering in a larger size, but I think it will still be too small.  The fit is nothing like the photo."
3.0,Like a slinky skirt but in a dress. A bit short for me. I’m 5’7 and it just covers my knees.
3.0,"Nice looking &#34;Moana&#34; necklace. Size is definitely for adult though. Even at shortest clasp option, it's still a little long for my 7 year old...but she still lives it."
3.0,They are cozy. Usually wear a size small but these are too small so maybe go up a size.
3.0,Beautiful earrings but a bit heavy. I thought it would be fine being 18k gold plated for my sensitive ears but that proved to be wrong. I can wear for a night out but no longer than that :(
3.0,"Really cute sweatshirt. It is like a cowl neck and has a front pocket, bad news is that the front pocket came ripped. I chose not the return it but I will have to take time to mend it."
3.0,Got smashed on way. I am abroad and won’t be back in the US before February so I doubt I can return it back from here. Super bummed. I purchased this product before many times as they don’t last forever but I still like them. But to have it bent out of shape before it was delivered to me is disappointing to say the list.
3.0,Fits phone very tight but hard to push buttons on case but worth every dollar
3.0,Wore it once. Good for packing & travel.  Fit is fine but the zipper gets stuck all the time. Might return for another one.
3.0,It's as pictured and I actually like the material but I specifically checked the product photos many times to see if the chest area had a button and it looked like if did. Well it doesn't so the chest area is just wide open to show all the cleavage you have. Which is not what the models look like but c'est la vie
3.0,"Cute top, but the chiffon does NOT allow for any stretch, and its shorter then I personally prefer. I wear an 18 and ordered a 3X and it fits OK. This is a sheer material, so keep in mind, you'll want to wear a Cami or something."
3.0,"Great on the outside, very cramped on the inside. I like the separate zippers but the opening is not wide enough to put A4 size documents without bending. Once inside, it fits perfectly."
3.0,The size is true to size with your ring size and they fit well. However if you are hoping for bright colors like the picture they are more pastel than bright and I was hoping the 2 tones orange one would be as the picture shows and it is not its red and a yellow shade.
3.0,"Nice nightgowns and night shirts for little girls without cartoon characters are not easy to find.  This is super cute but the 3-4 year 110 cm would have fit our 4 year old when she was 1....maybe.....so sad I won't be able to give it to her for Christmas, it will have to be returned instead.  I would exchange but it is so small, not sure what size to order so will look elsewhere now."
3.0,The chain broke<br />I love the quote. But now have to fixed it.
3.0,I don't love them or hate them. I will wear them but not buying again.
3.0,The keychain is very pretty but made very cheap. Very light in weight. Don't feel like it will hold up
3.0,"The lack of hem, hence tendency to roll, the width and therefore tightness, the quality of material is all manageable; what is difficult to deal with is the length.  When temperatures fall, I like to double the material (because it is thin) over my ears which then reduces the coverage on the back of my neck which then pulls it too far off my head and it begins to slide thus requiring  a lot of fidgeting to get everything covered. In a word it is skimpy.  If you could give us a few more inches in length (My favorite one is 24 inches) I would be a very happy camper and would order many more. The added length would also offset the rolling due to lack of hem. Qing Outdoor and Bundle Monster seem to be the same product."
3.0,Turns after awhile
3.0,Don't like the stiffness of the hat
3.0,"I'm 5'3, 150 lbs, 34c. I typically wear a medium but thanks to the other reviewers, I ordered a Large. The large is still somewhat small. If it shrinks in the wash, it'll be unwearable. The fabric is kind of thick and stiff but the cut is figure forming which is a nice feminine touch for such an ugly shirt ;-)"
3.0,Small for kids. Not adults
3.0,"This vest is very attractive, with the white trim around the neck and shoulders, but it is too long (below the waist)."
3.0,"Not totally impressed for the size and style, seems cheaply made and zipper pieces are cheap not one of my better Purchases, The material is very plastic-like and the straps are very weird,<br />The best part about it is that it’s cute  for kids to hold it.."
3.0,too small for adults... sized for a child
3.0,The lens came off rightaway
3.0,"It in pictures it shows pockets, did not have pockets other then that it was fine<br />Edit: Whole"
3.0,"Not the White I ordered, but instead the Lilac.  Otherwise, as expected."
3.0,"Cute sweater, but it runs a bit large.  I ordered a small and it just hung low on my waist.  I returned it for that reason, but would have kept it had it fit smaller."
3.0,Fit well and washed well.  Just thinner than I expected.
3.0,Darker than I expected.
3.0,The sandal was about just about a 1/2&#34; shorter than the current Teva sandal I have. They are both the same size but the new one is significantly shorter.
3.0,Material felt really nice but it ran small for my liking
3.0,"The material and padding in the attached bra feel very nice, but sadly these run nearly two sizes too small.  The pads in the bra are a bit small, so it takes some adjusting to get them centered right, but that could also be because these run small.  I returned these and ordered the wider strap version in a larger size, which also have great material and padding, so I would overall recommend this product, but you will need to go up a size or two from the recommendations on the page."
3.0,"I bought this to replace a 20 year old crank umbrella made of Sunbrella.  The Sunbrella was still in surprisingly good shape, but I wanted something that looked a little fresher.<br /><br />This umbrellas fabric doesn't seem to be of the same quality, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt as time will ultimately determine it's durability.  To be fair Sunbrella would probably double or triple the price.  Otherwise the ratcheting crank mechanism works well and overall the quality is decent considering the relatively low price for a crank umbrella.<br /><br />The LED lights are what I assume is a light strip inside the square frame tubes. There are small clear plastic passive emitters that screw into the square tubing.  There are 3 spares in a small plastic bag floating around in the box.  The only reason you would need a spare is if one falls out and you lose it.  There is a separate small solar panel/battery module that gets mounted into the top of the umbrella.  It's packed in a small square of styrofoam at the end of the box, make sure you don't throw out the box before retrieving it and installing it.  Finally there is a little switch about midway up the post that turns the lights on.  When testing them during daylight they are very very faint. During the dark hours light output is about what I expected of solar, that is not great, but it's actually adequate as it casts a subtle ambient light.<br /><br />Sundale does have a website with a customer service link, although I could not find any downloadable instructions or a link to spare parts, specifically the solar module.  At the very least the rechargeable batteries will need to be replaced in a few years, and possibly the solar module,  hopefully the fabric holds out that long.  I did see a response to another question stating that the batteries are rechargeable AA's.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with the umbrella, especially given the price.  Mine is the apple green and it really pops.  I do recommend it at this point with my only concern as mentioned above being the durability of the fabric.  I'm keeping my old one in storage as a backup.<br /><br />Update.  After one short season the fabric faded significantly."
3.0,I’m 126lbs 5ft 4 And I ordered a medium and it was really really tight so I’m returning it!
3.0,"Was to tight, hard to get on"
3.0,"I love this dress on me however, the first time I wore it, one of the loops to hold the tie broke."
3.0,The fabric has no give. I ordered a large and I am a 36B and it fit tight across the chest.
3.0,"It looks somewhat as pictured, however the picture shows a more flowy, chiffon style fabric. The fabric received was much heavier. Otherwise the size guide was perfect."
3.0,Lot of wasted space. Wish I could have designed it !!!  Could use extra pouches on the outside !!!!
3.0,This dress runs large. Size down
3.0,Beautiful style was too small
3.0,Fits snugger then I would like and a little short for my liking. But the color is fantastic and it’s light weight
3.0,The appliqué makes it very hard to breathe through. But the designs are beautiful so he just used them for decoration in his dorm room. So for a mask....not so good. But we love the designs!
3.0,I ordered up a size for my daughter just to be safe and I would have been fine with her normal size. The 5t is fitting more like a 6 and is better suited for her 6 year old sister. I think the top is good enough quality but the bottoms are meh. Maybe walmart quality. Decent last minute outfit. The headband is a tie it on yourself one which i liked.
3.0,I loved it at first the color and size. But after a month or so and handle would not stay hooked.
3.0,This is so beautiful but it does not fit my arm. It's so beautiful if it were double the size it would fit me. I'm not a big person. This would fit an anorexic person
3.0,stone was chipped on edges with rough sides. if I wanted to use it a setting I would be disappointed with it. but for the price it was okay.
3.0,No too heavie
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2a69bf546da7d0d8dc5b018262562718]] 1st- I absolutely loved this shirt!!!! It looked exactly like the picture and was pretty decently made....BUT IT RUNS SMALL!! I'm usually a medium but got a large just in case after looking at the reviews. When I raise my arm straight out in front of me, it almost goes to quarter sleeves. Also keep in mind, the material does not allow any room for stretching. The shirt was tight in the front and almost revealed my bra through a peep hole. I returned the shirt (Unfortunately) and had to go with another vendor because they didn't have the next size up available at the time. My advice is go up twice your size if you have longer arms and are more than a B cup if you want a better fit and especially if you intend to wear the sleeves long and not rolled up.<br /><br />I'm 5'5, average build, 36C bra size. The size shirt I was wearing in the video was a large."
3.0,Very cute and arrived on time but kinda small and slip off.
3.0,It was not as bright as originally pictured.  It was more of  light coral than vibrant orange.  Quality of fabric is nice
3.0,They are too hard to fit!
3.0,This purse did not fit my cell phone with the case on and barely with the case off -- I had to put it in a certain way. The pieces connecting the chain to the purse kept getting in the way and making it difficult to close. I ended up returning it -- it might be functional if you want to only hold credit cards and some makeup.
3.0,they break easily in cold weather
3.0,"These slippers were ordered as 10 1/2, but they fit like 11 1/2 or 12 ! I should have sent them back....."
3.0,The Shoulder Cozy Is Warm On A Cool Evening.  But The Fleece Is Not As  Thick As The Cozy I Had Previously.
3.0,Doesn't stay on. Size4-6 I wear 5.5 and this don't stay on
3.0,Fits well. Comfortable. For summer. Fades dramatically after first wash. My black pair is now Grey after first wash.
3.0,Granddaughter loves it. But it seem to run a little small. Its more like a little longer shirt. To short for a dress must wear leggings. But it still was a good purchase
3.0,"I returned it and here's why. The style is like the picture which is nice and very comfortable material. However, I'm 5'2 109 pounds and bought a small and the top was loose and the bottoms were tight so even if I sized up the top wouldve been too loose."
3.0,"A little too small, the top was too skinny. Turned it into a skirt."
3.0,Jeans are cute but design was definitely not like the picture. Really like the picture.
3.0,"The sweater is definitely cute, I will give it that. The design has really good visual appeal. However, the quality isn’t quite there. It is an incredibly thin sweater, so it’s not going to be too useful once the weather cools down, and while the material is fairly soft, the fibers are a bit irritating on the skin. I think it’ll be cute to wear when I just want to look nice that day, but that’s about the limit of it."
3.0,"It says it's a hard case and to a degree it is, but it was not nearly as hard as I thought it would be. I was able to get a better quality, more firm case at the truck stop for less. Slightly disappointed."
3.0,"I wear a medium, but I usually order a large in my jackets for the extra arm length. The jacket fit fine, but the color in the photo is exactly what I was looking for-- an orangish-yellow cognac. However, the jacket I received was more of a tan shade. The leather was decent quality, but I returned since the color is not what I expected."
3.0,"Cute dress, but see through! Either needs a slip or to just be worn as like a swim cover-up or something"
3.0,I’m a total hat person and probably own over 70 hats. This hat is gigantic! I mean really really large I’m not sure who’s head it’s going to fit on but definitely not the average person.  It’s also loose so there’s no snug fit at all and it always feels sloppy.
3.0,Really cute purse but they did not include the chain with the bag. Can y’all please send it? Otherwise I will return it. Need it by Monday.
3.0,Thin material. Slids up leg. Cute though
3.0,Very cute for the prize... but BS... this is not for a baby or a toddler.  This fits my head. It's huge...!
3.0,Can't quit catch on to how to put them on to stay safe.
3.0,Finally received my order just to see that it is clearly missing buttons.
3.0,Hard to separate the pins but once you understand how to separate them it’s not so bad. Still bit of a hassle though.
3.0,when i got the bag i had to assemble  the rolling part of the bag and it didnt come with screws so that was bad and it took an entire MONTH to ship<br />thinking back i dont know if it was worth it.
3.0,"Nice that the pants are thicker, but the fabric was a little weird and itchy. The pants were too tight in the stomach and too loose in the legs."
3.0,"This link used to be for a gothic Victorian style coat, and now it’s a Xmas sweater so I’m highly confused. Thought someone hacked in my Amazon account yo."
3.0,The shirt itself was fine but the sleeves ran very small for being a plus sized shirt.  The fabric is so thin I'm afraid it would just rip.
3.0,The hat picture is not true.
3.0,"It looks very similar to the image but It is obviously cheaply made, The Ears do not look that pretty as in the image. It came in super early by three weeks - WHICH IS AMAZING:D I didn't think I would get it before Halloween:) but you get what you paid for so for how much I paid it's not terrible"
3.0,not my favorite.
3.0,"Nice material and style, my spouse really liked it but the small was too big and there wasn’t an XS."
3.0,"Overall, this bag works fine for our Disney pins, but unzipping it is a bit challenging, especially around the corners as it often gets hung up. Other than that, it works as described."
3.0,Loved the shirt. But it was way too small and I ordered a large. Had to give it away.
3.0,"I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The swimsuit is not what I expected. I received the blue and black one and the colors are beautiful.  The fit however is sorta awkward. I ordered an XL because most reviews I saw said to order up a size, I'm 5'4 and 145 lbs. The cup size is perfect (I'm a 36C) but I had to rig the back since it clips instead of ties and that part was way to big.  The bottoms fit okayish the butt just goes up higher then expected, so its sorta saggy here and there.  So it's to to big in some spots but perfect in other. Overall the swimsuit is gorgeous just a little awkward."
3.0,"I tried the pjs on, and they fit fine, but then I washed them before I wore them, and the shrank considerably. They were so small that the buttons kept popping open."
3.0,"These shoes are super fun and cute, BUT way too small. My 12 yr old son wears a 6Y and I order the 7.5(M) and it was still to small. A 8.5(M) might work but not sure. They are also narrow. Planning on exchanging for a bigger size. I hate that it was a Christmas gift and it didn't work out."
3.0,Didn't fit properly.
3.0,Material is thick but sizing is off and runs wide. I ordered a L and XL and the L is wider and longer than the L.
3.0,Good deal and now I have plenty of teeth for the kids to play with or use for several Halloweens.
3.0,"I suspect most people know what these are. It's a black wallent, in a brown tin presentation container. I've seen them before, particularly in discount stores. It's a gift, and I don't know if the recipient will prefer a tri-fold or bi-fold, so I am giving both."
3.0,"I like the graphics, size should cater for slim built little one as well"
3.0,I love the desing and  material. But it does not  stay still it falls. I think if you add a clip by the top it would be perfect.
3.0,"I like mine, but don't buy it if you need a functional light."
3.0,Small for an XL.
3.0,Lightweight sweater but in-person quality doesn't look as good as photo. Material feels kind of cheap.
3.0,Very very cute but material not my favorite
3.0,Not as nice as pictured.
3.0,Rusted easily didn’t fit and turned finger green
3.0,"Beautiful style and comfortable fabric, but it was definitely way too short to wear without leggings or jeans."
3.0,"at first i tried to return it because i felt it was too small, i lost a little weight and tried it out again and now i actually really love this! esp with my faux leather leggings."
3.0,"the fit was off for my girl, not overly beautiful but nice"
3.0,You get what you pay fit pay for. Thin cheap shorts. She’s happy with them though.
3.0,"The height if the hat is a little weird and fits like a bubble on your head.  I have kind of a big head, and it still fits pretty weird.  The quality is what you would expect out of a $10 hat, not horrible, not great.  Dont expect to wear it every day if you want it to last a long time."
3.0,"I love the idea of this shirt, but it barely went past my chest.  It's way too short to reasonably wear, but if that's what you're looking for, it's super cute."
3.0,Really cute but more for a tall skinny person. I'm 5' 140 and order the size 8.
3.0,The studs are to large and hurt my ears.  Very pretty though.
3.0,the  pockets at the bottom are very large . I cut mine back so I coild get closer to the table .Some things will stain this silicone permanently . The silicone is a little uncomfortable [coo/clammy ]on the back of the neck .
3.0,I ended up liking (not loving) this dress. It does not fit like the picture. I got the xl and It is not long to the ground- fits me just after the calves. It is a much lighter purple and the bottom part is not as loose/ blousy/ flowing as pictured. It fits somewhat close.  It that flattering but wearable.
3.0,This coat is so adorable and very soft. I just wish I had realized it was buttons and not a zipper. A little difficult buttoning up a wiggly baby! LOL
3.0,It was so pretty but too small and there was small hole in the material
3.0,"I feel the fake leather material in the pics looks a lot better than the actual product. Arm material is somewhat like a matte material than glossy like in the photo and doesn't look as cool. Wish it was a bit longer, but Ill work with it."
3.0,This is a adorable dress but it runs very small. I ordered the 2x and was still very small. This company hasn't updated their sizes to fit Americans. If you are a small you would probably have to order a large in this dress. I am 6 ft and 170 hardly a 2x but oh well. I'm keeping it and working out. Maybe I'll be able to wear it next summer.
3.0,"I want to give this a better rating, but I used their chart to measure and it was still too small. It looks nice though, I really wanted this to fit."
3.0,Too large for my comfort but not super large.
3.0,Need to return for a smaller size
3.0,"My mistake to go cheap as this is what I paid for.<br /><br />Not ""cut"" at all - made to fit a box body.<br /><br />Light weight."
3.0,Very cite dress . However I wear a large across the board. If anything the large is sometimes to big never too small. This dress was very small. So I gave it 3 stars . Because I have to take time sending it back.  I will re-order when I get my refund
3.0,Looks good with flaps up or down.
3.0,I liked the ps4 thumbstick when I played it at bestbuy so I bought these in order to put them on my xbox controller but shipping was supposed to take forever like over a month. It came in about a couple weeks from purchase which was nice but one of them was chipped like the soft foam? Idk how to describe it but the top part was chipped revealing the actually plastic piece underneath which isn't cool for a supposedly &#34;new&#34; product. :\
3.0,I bought the white version and loved it so I thought I would get the black one as well. Unfortunately the black one doesn’t actually unbutton like the white one does so it looks a little bit awkward but I guess it’s still cute. 2 stars for the black because it just wasn’t really what I ordered but an easy 5 stars for the white.
3.0,Super cute top but too large. Can't wear it. Good quality but beware of size. It's most too big in arms. Will get hemmed.
3.0,"I was expecting a cotton dress, but instead it has more artificial heavy - thicker material combination, it is warmer than expected.  The dress looks good and fits well though."
3.0,I was buying this for the basketball and hoop and it was not a full charm.
3.0,You could see through this white dress.
3.0,"unless you have a fat foot these will simply fall off. Seller is kind....No hastles on return. I would love to try these again,Damnit!"
3.0,"I'm a really big woman. Size 26 us. This fit GREAT! but, it is so linty, I had huge black dust bunnies chasing me all over the house. Washed it twice and dried it with tennis balls. Seemed to be better."
3.0,More child size.  Pretty little earring but very pale in color.
3.0,Quite tight but a cute hat.
3.0,Received with one lens out but i put it back in easily and seems to remain in place.
3.0,These earrings are tiny
3.0,Magnet on bracelet fell out on the first day on one of the pairs.
3.0,Looks very comfy
3.0,"I really do love this bag! So I actually bought it to use it as a clinical bag for nursing school. I love that it has so many pockets, both inside and outside. It fits everything that I have to bring (which is a LOT). My main complaint is that the top pocket started to rip on the inside. So for example, if I put things (usually something small like pens or accessories) in the top pocket, it falls into the bag and then I have to dig to find it. I’ve only used the bag 3 times so I was super sad to see the rip.. but overall I’m still super happy with this being the bag that I picked."
3.0,"I'm 5'2"" 110lbs and 34B cup. This shirt is literally a dress on me. The sleeve length is good but it doesn't fit me anywhere else. I'm swimming in it. The material is poly and spandex so it looks like a pajama top. The color is beautiful so I'll probably belt it and wear it as a cute mini dress"
3.0,Flows beautifully in spins. Somewhat small but made it work.
3.0,"Decent boots, but are WAY smaller than they state."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. The chain feels weak, but that's easily replaced."
3.0,"I love the shirt, just don't put it in the dryer after you wash it, or it will lose its shape, and it will shrink"
3.0,"This shirt is far too short in the body. If i move it goes up over my stomach. The shirt is super stretchy and fits decently enough. The sleeves are a good length, but the body is so short, Would be fine for a teenager or someone who does not care if they show their belly but not for me. Ill have to wear an undershirt with it and that kinda sucks with the off shoulder design."
3.0,always fall off
3.0,"Made in.... makes a difference to me, and I did not check until it arrived. My bad. I won't buy again, but that is a person choice"
3.0,"top fit great, bottoms were a bit small"
3.0,Well covered. However the plastic front shield is easily wrinkled and it’ll prevent you from seeing clearly. The black part of the hat is also too big. You have to constantly lift up your chin to avoid your sight being blocked by the brim.
3.0,There is really nothing wrong with the dress.  It just did not look good on me.
3.0,"My thin son wears 32x32 normally. Since these were Asian made, I decided to get 34. Too small in the length and thigh but good quality. So I returned for 36. Too big, even the tag and care label were different. I’ll keep the 36 due to quality and hope they shrink"
3.0,"Likes: warm, very comfortable, thick-insulated<br /><br />Dislikes: the fabric on the inside of my hand got ripped within a week"
3.0,Zipper broke off already and it's only been worn a handful of times
3.0,They look a little plastic...not my favorite and have never worn them.
3.0,"Not as long as pictured, still above knees! No toes or Heel, causes it to be short in overall length. No wonder the models are on their toes!"
3.0,I returned the belt to Kohl’s a day after I received it. It was to hard to use with arthritis. I need my credit to my account.
3.0,After about a month of wear all the plating had worn off... ouch!
3.0,The material is very thin. Need to wear a slip beneath it.
3.0,Product does not even look like it does in the picture
3.0,such a small roll...but I really only needed it for one gift.<br />Thought it was priced way to high for me!
3.0,The pouch that the bracelet came in was actually nicer than the bracelet. It's OK it's just kind of cheap looking.
3.0,I ordered these two sizes bigger than my shoe size and the foot part was definitely too small.  I had to return them.
3.0,"Cute bag,however there was no Velcro on the small bag to keep flap close"
3.0,Nice fabric but shorter in length than expected.
3.0,Sponge brush broke with first use. Rest seems OK.
3.0,"This wallet is extremely well made and comes with a lot of options to customize it with three different sets of face plates, extra t5 screws, and even several elastic bands. My main problem, however, is that the top and bottom of the wallet are just open. Only the sides have elastic to keep cards in place so essentially its two pieces of metal with the only securement on the sides. The inside is polished and will help prevent scratching the cards but it also means cards slide right through the wallet if you're not careful. It needs to have two small elastic bands at the bottom as well (like other minimalist wallets) to give it more structure and prevent cards moving all over the place."
3.0,"I really like this petite watch.  It’s very feminine and fashionable.  The strap is narrow (about 1/4”) so it doesn’t overwhelm a small wrist.  The face is slender and sleek as well.  I’ve been wearing this watch everyday for several months now and the finish still looks like new.  I did have to cut the length of the strap because for a watch that looks great on a petite person, the strap is WAY too long.  Note: if you plan to shorten the length of the strap, first unscrew the adjustable side from the face and cut the end that will be hidden, then slide it back into the face.  Do not just cut the loose end, it will look horrible and be scratchy. You will need a metal cutting tool."
3.0,It's usually small
3.0,I purchased the yoga capris in black and heather. They came as a set. The black ones fit well but the leg seam began to unravel after the first time I wore them... The heather was too tight around the waist. I will be returning these.
3.0,So pretty but the chest and shoulder areas are very wide and large.
3.0,To get the correct chest fit (xl) the hips end up being to big. Though it doesn’t lay perfectly on the back (zipper kind of bulges) it is worth the money. Definitely need a girdle or every line shows.
3.0,Teeny bit smaller than standard ring sizes.<br />I ended up using the smaller one on my toe - fits perfectly!
3.0,"These gloves work adequately well with iPhone, etc. It is not difficult to select or type with gloved fingers. I like these much better than fingerless gloves for using with touch screens. They are warm for knit gloves, but don't protect from wind (not unexpected). Occasionally the fingers won't register on the touch screen. There are better touchscreen gloves of this type (e.g. Glider Gloves)."
3.0,Cheaply made & probably will not last long but cute & good size for the price.
3.0,This is super cute but it runs very small. I’m small bust (36B) can’t image how anyone larger could wear this.<br /> I’m normally a medium and bought this is a large and it’s very tight.  The two cut outs in back are a little odd. The construction appears to be or decent quality and I’ll know more when I wear it. I think it’s a little over priced. But it’s really cute. Also shipping on this was a little delayed but nothing major.
3.0,Cute but colors are more muted/faded than in the photos
3.0,"All of oniel shorts for me our 36, these didnt come close to fitting, size up if buying when compared to other Oniels.  Quality and style excellent"
3.0,"It’s ok. The material is thinner and cheaper than I assumed by the photo. The fit is definitely off by two sizes at least ( too small). It’s ok, I don’t think I’ll order another."
3.0,"It is very useful while at home, but doesn't just look like a beanie because you can see the speakers bulge out a little on the sides. Very useful at home but somewhat awkward in public."
3.0,"Not really that impressive, hairbands that came with this bracelet do not fit and likely won't be useful in my daughter's hair. Unlikely the hair bands she does use will fit on bracelet either. Type is very tiny, more so that picture gave impression of."
3.0,"Ordered these sandals in a larger size, but they were still too small. I returned and went up another size, and it fits but a little tight."
3.0,very hard to put on the watch. I struggled getting it on. Hard to adjust.
3.0,"While these are not the most stylish shorts, they are very comfortable and give additional coverage down the leg.  I just got them and have not washed them or put them thru a workout yet.  But wore a pair just to see how they felt.  I am 5'4"" 160lbs I ordered medium and they were a perfect fit and were very comfy."
3.0,"I ordered the XXL for my Dad, who normally wheres XL, and the sweater was too small."
3.0,I'm a 36D and normally wear a size 12 on top and an 18 on the bottom. I bought this dress in an XL to fit my curves and I surprisingly found it to be a little tight across the chest. It still hangs well and looks really cute though. It did eventually stretch a bit after wearing.
3.0,the odd holes in the lens made light and water come in. my son used these for surfing because he has an eye problem from being in the sun too much.  I would probably go with sea specs or just get floating croakies for regular sunglasses.
3.0,I love this outfit but definitely way to long to be 6-9.. that's the only reason I gave it a 3 star because it'll take a long while till she can fit in it sadly I bought it for an event but she couldn't wear it. Very cute outfit though.
3.0,This bikini is just the right amount of sexy. I loved it. I would say the top does fit a bit awkward and I wouldn't recommend for someone with a large chest.
3.0,The necklace was as advertised but had a defective link where something was not right; links fell out of the pattern and looks wrong. Also the chain came wrapped in an impossibly cumbersome plastic “condom” seemingly designed to keep you from getting to the necklace. Not a good thing.
3.0,I bought two of these bracelets.  One for myself and one for my 15 year old.  It fits but Unfortunately the string does not have much stretch to it.  Hers popped and she is very upset.
3.0,"This is one of 4 pairs of shoes I use for our 3 year old & these were rarely used prior to the strap breaking (Image 2). Very cute with quality issues. This is one of the 2 Capelli clogs we own. The other was the shark shoes which we had to order twice due to the rubber pieces improperly cut. Both pairs had issues so we were able to combine the 2 pairs to get one decent pair out of those. These had the same issue, first the rubber trim wasn't cut properly (jagged) so we just dealt with it. Unfortunately, the first week the eyes popped off (we luckily found 2 and glued them on. Later a 3rd popped off Image 1). Decided to wear despite the lack of an eyeball and then the strap broke (see 2nd image. In this image you can also see the jagged rubber - looks like it was used/abused; however, it came that way). Having bought these earlier than our 3 year old needing, it's long past the return date. On another note, we have Crocs Shark light up shoes that our little one decided to wear even though they were 1 size too big. Those our typically our ""go to"" shoes and they are still going strong!"
3.0,Super cute but the &#34;silver&#34; wears off FAST now they look rose gold.
3.0,Large is really big
3.0,"I thought is was a small face watch. It is It is .too big..., wanted it to be a small face watch."
3.0,It's ok for the price . I will not be using it for professional use but is good for casual.  The darkest color that I could order (dark grey) is a lot lighter than the stock photo.  The bag itself is pretty small.  I had to cut the pocket out of the middle so I can fit my wallet and cell phone. Comes with strap for crossbody and the furry key chain.
3.0,"Fits like it looks on the model however super scratchy material and very see through thin. Also, it has already ripped on one of the shoulder straps and in the crotch area. Had to resew."
3.0,It fits perfectly but when you work out it keeps getting off on the thighs
3.0,"These earrings are cute, but they are super tiny. My 9 year old hardly wears them because she said they're so small no one notices them. I'd say these are better suited for an infant."
3.0,The dress fit as expected but there zipper was faulty
3.0,The buckle’s shown in silver.. but got a black and rose gold instead. Awful.
3.0,"They're nice and warm. Comfortable, good quality. When you get the package, you think, ""Oh, my God, these are too thick and won't look like leggings!"" But they don't look very bulky when you put them on. Fits good from the calf up, could be much tighter around the ankles, they look like a pair of slim cuts jeans as opposed to leggings. If you have very wide calfs, or just want warm lounging pants, you'll like these. I'm keeping them for the warmth."
3.0,Pretty cool necklace but it broke first day i think I can fix it but still....annoying! Pretty low price though so...
3.0,"I like these glasses they are lightweight for wearing for long periods of time. They look nice on me as well. I use them for work and when I want to change my style up a little. The only issue I have is the plastic lens because it makes it hard to see in some lighting setting and I think what worst is having to explain, I can not see while I have on glasses to people. Moreover, yeah the glasses get dirty fast too."
3.0,Son bonitas pero no trae el filtro como ellos dicen delgadas
3.0,"I’m 5’3”, 120 lbs and I got the black pair with the rainbow stripe in M and the black pair with the red and white stripe in M. I’m keeping the red and white stripe black pair - it fits well and the stripe is sewn into the pants in the proper place. The black with rainbow stripe is going back though - the rainbow is a ribbon glued to the sides, and it’s right on top of the pockets, so it make the hips protrude out. Plus that pair is shorter than the one with the red and white stripe."
3.0,"Anything high waisted isn’t quite as flattering as other dresses if you’re heavy through the middle and hips (I’m 5’5” and 195 lbs.), but for the money this is a decent dress. The material is soft, and it’s flowy and comfortable to sit and walk in. A shawl or scarf would dress it up nicely for a special occasion. The length is fine with both flats and heels. Be sure to wear a supportive bra if you are big-busted (I’m 42D), or the top sags. The top back seemed to bunch out a bit - that would be the only downside."
3.0,This was an ok item.
3.0,"I like this dress but I don't love this dress.  It's nice enough to wear around casually so I'm keeping it.  However, the elastic part is a little high for me (or maybe it's too low for me - I am short waisted -  either way it doesn't hit me the way I would prefer).  I like it though."
3.0,"I'm sorry, but this beanie is way too small for my head. I like the design and how it looks and all, but it was too small for my head. It wasn't comfortable, and it made my head look squished. Wasn't too fond of it, I'm gonna give it away soon."
3.0,First time I purchase. I purchased large it was to small 2nd time I had to purchase a 3 xl just to get my true side.
3.0,Item is small for the size it is tagged. Order a size up if your not skinny and petite.
3.0,Let's not say it's wrong but while wearing this mask it makes everything echo especially when you speak other than that very cool mask fits well
3.0,"This is a nice dress for casual wear at home or at the pool. The fabric is too thin and see-through to use for other outings, however. I got the pink and wouldn’t recommend that color. You definitely have to wear shorts or something else to avoid the full visibility underneath. Also, the top of it is a little loose fitting, wasn’t cut quiet right."
3.0,"Love the fit and feel, but it tears easily. I toss and turn and the straps tore within first week."
3.0,"Color is much lighter in person, I would call it nude beige. They fit comfortably and are easy to slip on. I am always a 7.5 in dress shoes/sandals, I don’t consider my foot large, but these make my foot look much larger than they are."
3.0,"Ring fits good. The ""love"" is not very prominent like I would like. That's the exact reason why I bought it."
3.0,"I love this watch, but sorry to say it doesn't keep time. I wear it for looks only...it hasn't worked since day one."
3.0,It isn't bad for the price but I returned because I needed something for a trip to Ireland that I could fold up small. I liked the style as it reminded me of Blade Runner. Does smell plastic like and can get sweaty but it is not bad really.
3.0,It’s beautiful and well made. Much larger in size than expected. Bigger than I personally like. If you like very large pendants it would be perfect.
3.0,A littler short but love the quality
3.0,"I ordered this bracelet for a going away gift for a co-worker.  The online picture looked like  fairly sturdy links.  In reality, the links are very delicate.  The bracelet was also very difficult to latch.  This would be a very nice bracelet for a young girl or small teen"
3.0,"So,  I bought it to go with my costume in the hopes that I would be able to tolerate it.  I could not handle it all night.  Maybe someone else could."
3.0,Barely covered my head….more for a tween than an adult.  I would not order again...
3.0,Hard to keep on!
3.0,Shipment was on time. no issue there. the reason for the three stars is because the watch lock sometimes detach when using a large jacket.
3.0,"I ordered a medium which i normally am but it was a little narrow the material is a little cheap but still nice and breezy, color was just right"
3.0,"This dress is cute. I expected it to be more like t-shirt material. It may be a cotton blend, but feels like the blend is rayon. The dress material is a lot heavier than what I was looking for."
3.0,"The outfit is cute but the pants are cut in a weird way, high waist, baggy  in the butt area, and short length in the legs. the shirt fits nice but is super thin material and see through. She will wear it for sure but i wouldn't reorder."
3.0,Looks better in pictures than in person.
3.0,cozy and attractive
3.0,I bought several and had them monogramed.  the neck on all of them is too large.
3.0,was thinking these would be more similar to BLOM head bands.. they are not as cute as BLOM
3.0,"I am a vet tech and bought this jacket to wear over my scrubs. It is EXREMELY fitted and thin, but very nice silky/stretchy material. The pet hair shouldn't stick to it too bad. I normally wear a small-medium in jackets, so I ordered a medium and probably should've ordered a large."
3.0,"For the price the skirt is perfect but runs a bit large,  I normally wear a size 10-12 and ordered a Large but could've used a Medium. The material feels good and looks great, not cheap at all, but because it's too big isn't flattering."
3.0,The sizing is way off. If you order this get two sizes up. I listened to the reviews saying it’s true to size and boy was that wrong. The shirt is well made but the sizing is what got the stars taken off. I ordered the large. I am 5’2 and the large was short on me. It came just above my pants line- which is saying a lot seeing as I wear midrise pants. My normal shirt size is a large.
3.0,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift but, it came with only 19 charms and some of the charms in the image that I wanted didn't come with it. I only recommend because th ones that came are cute. But it was pretty surprising to see that there were some missing when I opened the package."
3.0,"The shirt is a bit sheer and a tad on the small end for the size.<br /><br />The mean reason I returned it, the sequins looked pretty silly. Trust me, I knew what I was ordering, but the sequins were sparsely covering the sequined part so it just kind of looked funny with spaces in between."
3.0,"I had a hard time putting the backngs on! I drpped one, never to be found.  I pushed the other one , heck a time to get it in, actually bent the backing holder.  Regretfully, I would have to send it back😕"
3.0,Too large. I ordered L and received xxxl
3.0,"I am only giving 3 stars because what I ordered the company didn't have so they sent another pair, without notifying me.<br />I specifically ordered black gloves with hot pink lettering and received black gloves with white lettering. I have another child that has the black with white lettering and wanted something a little different so they wouldn't get them confused. When I contacted the company they stated they never had the black with pink lettering so that was deceiving.I returned the gloves but had to call a second time for them to return my shipping charges. That was annoying so I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from the company. So overall the gloves are good  but the company not so much."
3.0,Good fit but the kids were not able to run around our wooden floors without slipping and falling. The bottom of shoe has no grip and is not anti slip.
3.0,I would like these much better if they were a bit wider. They pinch me after a couple of hours.
3.0,When it arrived I was excited but when they’re on they are lackluster and so so.
3.0,Asian size
3.0,"Great vendor. Pretty earrings but the ear wire part was to thick and painful to get in or wear. Sadly, I have to return them."
3.0,"Although I took the time and care to measure my glasses (lens and frame), the product I received did not fit properly when clipped to the frame of my glasses.  It dropped below the frame. Therefore I returned it. Other than a poor fit, the sunglasses performed as stated."
3.0,This tie was purchased to match a vest also purchased from Amazon.  They were both described as &#34;mint green&#34; and looked the same in the picture however this tie is lime green so it was returned.
3.0,"This jump suit was the bomb I received so many compliments, but I gave three stars because the zipper busted & that was the end of my night 😐 how sad!!!  I plan to see if it can be repaired"
3.0,Quality is fair
3.0,Material was not as expected. Purchased a Large (which is my typical jogger pant size due to curves & body style) and they were extremely tight & uncomfortable.
3.0,"I like the style and the thickness of the material, padding is substantial. The straps are adjustable and removable, which is also a nice feature. The main drawback for me, however, is that the torso-length is short. I had hoped that this top would be as long as it is on the featured model, but it is much shorter than expected and ends about at the top of my swim bottoms, making my stomach visible."
3.0,Very cute and perfect size.  Only issue is the inside pocket. The pockets seam is not 100% sewed on.
3.0,It was nice but the back part was all loose
3.0,Only returned because the neckline was too deep
3.0,"Very cute, but some rhinestones fell out after first time wearing."
3.0,"These leggings run true to size, have a nice fit, and wick away the sweat which is great for my HITT workouts. Pattern is nice, too. These retail at a decent price as are just as nice if not better than some of the high end brands I have worn/reviewed in over a decade as a fitness instructor."
3.0,Ok for the Price
3.0,Cheaply made and cheap looking! I don’t recommend this!
3.0,These are cute but the fabric is thin and I’m my opinion subpar.
3.0,Does not hold good
3.0,Bought this for a trip to Mexico.  Cute dress but definitely cheaply made-glad I didn’t pay more than I did for it.  The fabric is cheap and the stitching is poorly done.
3.0,"This watch is very pretty - once you get used to the size. I love the face of the watch the dragon fly is beautiful, and beneath that the watch has an almost pearly finish. Because the dragon fly is so big the clock gets a little lost and is hard to read. I love the detail of where the watch band attaches to the watch. Here is my biggest complaint of the watch - the clasp of the band catches on everything. I had to take it off yesterday because I was afraid it was going to put a hole in my sweater. I am going to try to find a replacement band because I really like wearing the watch as an accent piece."
3.0,One size fits most. A little snug but worked for the layering look.
3.0,"So pretty but. Have to return, one of the side pocket down shut,,,darnit."
3.0,Cute but WAAAY more oversized than I expected!! The lens are REALLY big!!! I think the lens dimensions should be listed in the item details.
3.0,"Daughter-in-laws gift said, run small"
3.0,I know I dont have the models body. But i guess a loose halter makes it comfortable. I ordered a Large I'm a 12/14 in jeans and 38C.
3.0,Very cute skirt but runs very small!!
3.0,"The image for this petticoat is extremely misleading.  I'm 5'7&#34; tall, and it went down to my ankles, not just below the knees, as in the picture.  I was able to cut about 12&#34; off the bottom without it fraying, so I'm still able to use it.  I'm also in the middle of the waist circumference range between medium and large.  It's a bit tight, but I think I'll be able to stretch it out some.  I would recommend going up to large, if you are trying to decide between the two sizes.  It's not great, but will do the job for a relatively inexpensive purchase."
3.0,Love the color but the cut is not as flowing as shown in picture. Fits weird so my daughter tried it too. She thought it fit weird too. I ordered a large. I am a size 8/10
3.0,Cheap and strap is thin.
3.0,It looks a little too fake/low quality
3.0,good but runs small.
3.0,Cute outfit but shorts were too big on me so I returned
3.0,"The sleeves have a weird slightly clingy tarp-like plastic in them, which I couldn't tell when I bought it. Personally the feel of it irritates me.<br />Still not a bad deal for 15 bucks, and it's pretty good to wear over long sleeves.<br />Fairly warm."
3.0,I love the color and I like the size.  I'm not sure about the compartments.  My phone doesn't fit so I use the space for my checkbook.  The slots for the credit cards are very tight.  I put my cards in sideways so they are easier to remove.
3.0,"I followed the advice of other customers and purchased a larger size. My daughter wears 2T so I bought a 3T. It's a good length. The sleeves are a little long, but not ridiculously so. I would have given a higher rating if the quality was a little better. For the price, I suppose it was spot on. However, in trying to get it onto a wriggly toddler I suppose I ripped the waist a bit. It's nothing I can't stitch back together. But I also seem to have snagged the sweater a bit in one of her chair snaps. Maybe I'm a clumsy parent. But, I think I should have spent a bit more and bought a higher quality item. The sweater I don't think I can fix believably. Perhaps I can knit one for her. Suffice it to say, if the child you are purchasing for is a bit on the rough and tumble side, this is not the dress to purchase."
3.0,Definitely not compression wear.
3.0,These are a great little gift and way to carry your lip balm HOWEVER don't order the ones with the FISH TAIL because you can't get the lip balm stick to go all the way in thus you loose it because it just falls out.
3.0,"The material is beautiful. However, being a larger guy (20&#34; neck) it was very short and doesn't really fit well. I would imagine anyone wearing over a 15&#34; neck size would have trouble tying this properly."
3.0,Design and fabric is great with reasonable price. I bought this for my wife and she really likes it.
3.0,"Comfortable fitting shirt. Loved the price I paid for it.  Only disappointment was a noticeable, permanent stain or spot on the front of the shirt when opened from shipment."
3.0,"Glasses fit good, feel good and look good. Although the lens are fairly rounded and look more like women’s. That’s unisex I guess!"
3.0,"I wanted to love this based on all the amazing reviews. This is not what happened. Idk if I was just having a chonky day or what, but this bra was ENTIRELY too small. I ordered my usual size (32C) and it fit more like a 30A!"
3.0,Like the material but Longer than I expected.
3.0,After having the shirt for awhile it is starting to feel rough and it is very wide. It doesn't have holes or ripes and the stitching is still fully intact but the feeling of it makes it very hot to wear as well as itchy.
3.0,Soooo small. I should have realized it. Small enough to hang off a bracelet. I wanted it to hang off my bag. Nice quality.
3.0,"The buckle on this belt is gorgeous, but it's really too thick for a woman."
3.0,The bottoms fit well. They straps on the top are lose. Cute suit overall and will definitely keep it.
3.0,Cute for Halloween
3.0,I may have ordered wrong but I suggest considering ordering a size down.
3.0,"the heart stone is gorgeous, but the necklace part is lacking. it is adjustable, but never stays in place after you adjust it.  I will be getting a different strand for the heart."
3.0,"It’s cute and perfect for my job because I work with animals. However the band is a little stiff, but I can deal with it."
3.0,"The shorts are pretty nice design and the color is very good and exactly as shown in the pictures. They are light and breathable as well. I like the design for the mesh inner layer too. There is also a nice and handy pocket on the back as well.<br /><br />I did know that the provided sizing is Asia size and I needed to choose the proper size. So, I ordered based on the sizing chart on their page. However, after getting them and doing the measurement myself, all the sizing is off compared to the ones provided in the chart and the shorts are a lot smaller than what the chart says. They are very uncomfortable for me because of the size now.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend these shorts as the sizing charts is totally inaccurate and you may end up with any random size, it seems."
3.0,"this charm is perfect size and weight. too bad the metal loop that hooks it to your bracelet is weak and it fell off my bracelet. very dissapointed in that. the lettering was a little ""shakey""; not very straight lines."
3.0,Cute Hat (lil tight )
3.0,the gloves are beautiful BUT they run extremely small.  Had to reorder three times to get the correct size.
3.0,"ordered purple+green and got pink+green, and the green looks a little more yellow irl. otherwise nothing to really complain about. good for price"
3.0,Bodice is tight order big zipper opening under arm
3.0,For the discounted price I received these for they are worth it as they protected my eyes and are cute but are not strongly made to survive in the little bag they come in. I say his because in my purse I have a lot of things that they knocked up against and I thought on several occasions they were going to break. I did like how they included a little cleaning cloth.
3.0,They break super easily.
3.0,"Definitely a womens shirt, I'm a normal size in waist and chest, usually wearing a small tee and I'm so glad I ordered a large! It barely fit."
3.0,The red is more vibrant than the picture.
3.0,Zipper splits and sizes are weird. Sending it back.
3.0,Love the look but it is very small for a large. My daughter is small and it fits her fine but it’s not big and fluffy. Also sheds a lot.
3.0,Very cute bikini!
3.0,"Material is kind of weird like a bumpy texture from knit, using tough material. Also, it’s boxy and way shorter than I would have wanted - I thought it was longer based on how the model in the photo had the front tucked. When wearing with regular rise jeans, the bottom of the shirt barely comes to the top of the pants so the tuck wouldn’t be possible"
3.0,"This is a very cute skort, but if you have large hips with a smaller waist it's not made for you. It won't lay smoothly over your hips. Other than that it's extremely adorable and comfortable as well."
3.0,"I am a size 2 and the small &#34;fit&#34; but definitely fit really loosely. If they could make a smaller size I would have liked that, but it definitely wasn't a major issue. Just not nearly as attractive as I would have imagined.<br /><br />I was really disappointed that the dress was not this vibrant turquoise color, it was more like a blue-grey. The material was also felt! EW. It pills really easily and stretches out. I guess that is a good thing for people who foud this outfit too small, but not for me. It looked very frumpy.<br /><br />DO NOT plan on using that head piece! Imagine wearing a paper hat on your head, but the paper hat is just a flat piece of paper.<br /><br />*****I attached the Small dress, and an image that depicts the actual color of the dress."
3.0,"I am able to wear the bra with the straps as small as they go but it is still loose. While I will not be returning it, it would be helpful to have at least two sizes instead of one size fits all. The design is cute just wish it was snug."
3.0,Did not receive correct color- I ordered gray and got army green. Great dress though.
3.0,the material was quite different than i expected
3.0,The post cards had an even amount of everyone which I liked but the stickers were horrible there was 43 I counted on teahyung and only 5 of suga I don’t care who made these think v is more handsome everyone has there own opinion and I believe there should be an even amount of each member plus suga is my basis I wanted pictures of him and I only got 5 small ones
3.0,"The cuff just doesn't stay on, and I have regular size ears, not too small or too large. Just couldn't get it to stay and was scared I would just lose it. It's still a great bargain for the price, and I do love the look of the dragon.  I will find a way to turn it into a brooch so I can still wear it. :)"
3.0,The handles have already started to fray and I've only been using it for a week.
3.0,Didn't look the sammm
3.0,This bra is very comfortable but for the price I wish the cup wasn’t removable and was sewn in.
3.0,"This mermaid dress is decent but not the best fabric. It is stretchy and is not thin nor see through. It runs a little big so I’d order a size down. The sides hang a little low due to the dress being slightly big but you can adjust the crisscrossed straps to adjust the fit of the dress accordingly. It’s lightweight and cool, making it a fun dress for summer time. The colors are vibrant and the design pattern is one of the best mermaid designs I’ve seen on a dress. I removed 2 star due to the fabric used and for it running big. The length is long enough which is a plus and it comes down to about the top of the knees. It’s a cute dress that girls will love and surely feel like a real mermaid princess wearing it. ."
3.0,The pendant is too small and does not adjust well on the cord
3.0,It did not fit me properly but the color is vibrant and I received it in record time.
3.0,Not crazy about this shirt. Looks frumpy and the material is thin.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed with this bikini bottom because did not seem like a quality product from Lauren Ralph Lauren. Although the fabric was very thin for a bikini bottom, the coral color was nice. Unfortunately I had to return."
3.0,I thought they'd be at colorful as the photo but they're more of a dull brown. Good quality though.
3.0,The product was very soft and a great Valentine's gift. Unfortunately the robe did have a couple stains that looked like a rust Color that wasn't appealing.
3.0,"I bought size based on reviews but maybe I like my dresses looser because i went with what most reviewers my size said and it was too tight. It said true to size and I picked the recommended size for me. Unfortunately, I lost track of it and wasn’t able to return in time. If you are busty and don’t like super tight fitting clothes, I recommend sizing up at least one or two sizes."
3.0,"I love the pattern, but my gosh this purse stinks. Whatever the material is smells horrible and is terribly offensive. Waiting to see if it airs out and maybe the shipping in the heat caused the awful smell. I would die of embarrassment carrying this purse at this stage and ppl thinking this odor was coming from me😩"
3.0,"Quality seems cheap , it looks like the picture .Fits big , ill fitting on me .  Was expecting more ."
3.0,"Being unfamiliar with jewelry &#34;weight&#34; and so forth, I should have looked at the millimeter size and tried to find a bit bigger.  These are 1mm and I believe I saw some 3mm extenders.  So far I've used one of them 2 times and they seem to be okay.  I'm not hard on my necklaces, so it should last, but I would advise other shoppers to check for the millimeter size as these are tiny and &#34;dainty.&#34;"
3.0,"Super cute! Love this purse but kinda cheaply made, inner zipper broke first week n strap broke in about 3.  I could see the potential for this happening but it was so cute I kept anyway!"
3.0,Looks like the picture but more for a child than a teenager or adult.
3.0,"Somewhat disappointed with this sweater. It honestly does not look much like the picture. The tag says that the material is 65% cotton and 35% polyester. Well, in truth it looks and feels only like polyester. The material is shiny and slick which is weird for a sweater like this. Wish this product was made with 100% or something of equal quality."
3.0,"I absolutely love this charm but I was never able to wear it since it does not fit my  bracelet. For example, it won't fit in a pandora if you have one. It is made of silver 925 and its colour is amazing but don't buy if you have a bracelet as thick as a pandora, just to mention one that a lot of people know."
3.0,Cute idea made with rough crap material. I am 245lbs and 5ft age 21 and bought this in a XXL should have got 3X but would have sent it back because of the material PLUS THE BUTTONS ARE SO HARD TO GET IN THE HOLES. They really are a pain and it wasn't tight that it couldn't button it just hugged in a way that made me uncomfortable. Buy a better dress. The collar is rough and uncomfortable too
3.0,i would like this product if it was my size ........................<br />... descent color just not my size... not tight enough around the stomach
3.0,"Not much to say, bracelet itself looks ok, but only the middle strap, the other two straps, I mean the beads don't stay on the front once you put it on, beads roll away and what it is left , its just black strap."
3.0,Very cute too. Runs small
3.0,quality is okay<br />very thin but very soft<br />however its the size of a blanket so be aware that it is more of a shawl than a scarf
3.0,I Bellieve I ordered a size up after reading the review reviewing. It ended up vying too large in the hip breast area but I am naturally small in those areas. I do wish the back cover my butt more with the shirt but I stll like the swimsuit.
3.0,Fits well comfortable in the top area.
3.0,Very cheap I have normal to smaller wrists but this is so big that I had to clip it on the other side... I'm sure it's an easy fix still a little big. Very cute
3.0,"Very elegant but it falls from the wrist, found it laying around more than I like to see...."
3.0,Workout shirt runs small
3.0,I loved everything about this jumpsuit from the color to the fringe.. The only bad thing I have to say is the jumpsuit had zero stretch.
3.0,"I really like this jacket, especially for walking the dog.  Only is the zipper is not great...it pops apart with the tiniest of pressure."
3.0,"I'm not an exotic material expert but it seems nice enough. I ordered a size forty and it's tight with holes to tighten and loosen if necessary. The buckle was the most disappointing part of the belt, it seems to be very flimsy. I would buy another belt from this company but I would not recommend to a friend."
3.0,"So to start, I'll say these are super cute. I LOVE that about them. However, they're also super flimsy. I bent them moving them from my eyes to the top of my head. I may be a bit clumsy, but seriously... If you're super careful, or maybe just want to display them on a shelf, go for it - they'll be perfect. But if you aren't or don't plan to decorate your living space with them, you might want to purchase a more sturdy pair. Just sayin..."
3.0,"This is a lightweight scarf and hat set that provides more style than warmth. The scarf is long and wide enough to be worn in a variety of ways -- wrapped around the neck a couple of times with enough excess to hang down, doubled up witha looped through knot or wrapped around the head and neck as both head and neck gear. The hat on the other hand has a bit of an odd fit -- its a little snug around its edges so you have to really stretch it when pulling it over your head. Then when you have the hat in place, there's all this extra material so it poofs up and looks a little floppy. It might just be I'm not used to the fit of a beanie (I usually wear hats with pom poms) and it's an acquired preference. The scarf will probably get more use than the hat, but at $15 for the set, thats not a bad deal."
3.0,"You have to lace up the sides yourself and the look isn't as nice as the picture posted. Material is see thru. I didn't return it, but I don't think I will be wearing, too too revealing on the sides. You can't wear underwear, a thong maybe."
3.0,Cute but a little wobbly and fit sort of big. Just fits weird or else it would be five stars.
3.0,Nice dress with a beautiful pattern but too small. I even ordered up 2 sizes. Plus  the cut of the dress was off.
3.0,"The material is NOT soft, like pajama pants should be!  There is also not much stretch to these, which does not give to my curves & muscular legs.  Im definitely disappointed with these & wished I would have returned them."
3.0,I don't like the fabric as much as I thought I would.
3.0,It was a good purchase
3.0,Bulky cut - not for the athletic build guy.
3.0,Not one size fits all. They are labeled shoe size 9-11. Too big
3.0,"Earrings to large for my face, but beautiful."
3.0,"Huge, thought it would be smaller."
3.0,The masks ran very small (and my kids have small faces) and the eye shields barely covered the total eye area.
3.0,Not see through for spinning or strength training. I have 3 pairs and I love them.<br /><br />Update:<br />After several washes they become see-through. Ugh.
3.0,Beautiful dress...even though I used the size guidline the dress is still too small.
3.0,It is a beautiful bracelet.But a little heavy. Every one who has seen likes it .So do I
3.0,"Dress fit as expected and looks cute, however I didnt notice the neckline has a button when I ordered is. It's actually 2 strips of fabric that button together in the front. I thought it was going to be sewed all the way across. I guess its necessary to have a button bc the material is not stretchy and it could be difficult to get your head in if there wasnt a button, due to the lack of stretch. It's still cute, the neckline is just a little awkward."
3.0,the fabric is very see through
3.0,"I was looking for a grey ombre yoga pants and found this one which had a good amount of good reviews. I decided to give it a try and purchased it. I was pleasantly surprised with the fabric but my only issue is that it gave me the biggest cameltoe. Unfortunately, I will have to send these back and found a replacement."
3.0,Set seems very overprised for the quality.
3.0,They are cute for the price....however run big.
3.0,"If there's a button, one should be able to button it. The button is just for show."
3.0,Way to small for an adult perfect toddler size
3.0,Outfit is cute but did not come with belt.
3.0,Color is true to shown on website. The fabric is a bit cheap. I am usually a small in all tops and this fit more like a medium.
3.0,"The fabric is thin, slightly see through and unforgiving on bumps and rolls.  If you are wearing spanx type undergarments, you may be able to get away with it, but then again , the spanx may show through. The washed out blue and white stripe color is very attractive."
3.0,"Beautifully made vest.  The shirt fits like a mattress cover or fitted sheet and the skirt huge.  The 4x fits more like a 2x, I had to keep it though and have alterations because it's a wedding costume."
3.0,"I like the look of these panties on, but the manufacture of them was a little to shoddy for me. I found that they started to fall apart after only one wash and dry.  maybe my fault, but a girls gotta wash and dry her panties if ya ask me.  too expensive for the quality."
3.0,This jacket is super cute ! Loved it the min I saw it. Ordered a size 10 for my daughter. Figured it might be a little big but it would probably fit her perfectly come spring time. Came packaged super nice. Good fabric. Didn’t come out all creased up from shopping.  It’s already snug. There’s no way it will fit her in 2 months.
3.0,"I like them but some of the seams came apart , won't be buying them again"
3.0,"not buggy enough. if you are skinny then it would be like what you've seen with this model, but, if you are liked me with 2x size well its barely fitting and it stretch out to the limit (choose XXL). a little threadbare which probably made it comfy.<br />the T-shirt more likely to wear as night shirt and comfy.  the inside stitching was not on top shape (large stitching)<br />the price + shipping and handling was a little bet pricey and hipped from China."
3.0,"Not as pretty as in the picture.  Looks ""cheaper"" in person.  Represents more of a Halloween costume quality."
3.0,Still fogs
3.0,"Looks great, light weight, and the right size across for the width of my wrist. I have relatively small wrists for a guy so it's hard to find a men's watch that doesn't look way too big. This one fit perfect. Easy to adjust the band as well.<br />Update: Broke after a few months. I went to change the time with daylight savings by pulling the knob out a bit, spinning the knob to move the hands to the correct time, and then the knob would not go back in. Broken. I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,Whole in the seem on the first wear : (
3.0,Fits well and looks great but after a couple waches looks worn out.
3.0,"These Yoga Leggings are really just okay. They look exactly as pictured but I don't find them to be very comfortable. The black part of the leggings is really soft and they gray is almost as soft but the seam of the two run directly down the middle of the leg. It's pretty noticeable and annoying at first but it does go away enough to wear them. They were a bit shorter than I had expected, not totally crop leggings but not full length either, but still looked okay with shoes on. I also noticed that the left leg of mine was stitched differently so the pattern almost starts to wind around my leg. Also, on the left leg near the crotch the stitching is coming out already and I'm sure that there will be a hole in them after the first wash.<br /><br />I received these leggings at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. Even at a discount, I still think that I overpaid for these since I will probably never wear them."
3.0,I like that it's zips up in my cards and stuff can't fall out.<br />My iPhone 6 fits very nicely in the  Side pocket.  But there's no place for dollar Bills.
3.0,bucbentkle was
3.0,"The side zipper was a problem.  The zipper has to come up over a pocket seam, for one thing, and it just is hard to zip.  It was hard to zip and unzip when I was holding them in my hand.  Impossible when wearing.  Terrible design.  They fit like most Spanx products, which I really like and I have several other items.  The side zipper has got to go!"
3.0,"This is seriously a gorgeous dress and I was so dissappointed to have to return it, however if you have any height to you whatsover this is going to be pretty short on you. I'm 5'7 and it barely, if you can even call it covering, my bottom. Shorter gals, don't hesitate to buy it because it's a beautiful dress for a great price but be aware it's most likely not going to cover you if you're on the taller side like me."
3.0,"I like this fairy, but the purple color is very dark so it is hard to see the fairy!"
3.0,They are very cute but my 6 year old thinks they are too tight. Ear turned red where it was holding in place.
3.0,"Fits pretty true to size. However, the material is a bit on the thin side and can be a little see through in bright light..."
3.0,"This is a great blouse, although I think it's a tad overpriced for the quality of product you receive (but I lean towards the conventional side).  The color is really pretty, a nice, rich hunter green.  The material is thin enough to wear under a sweater or blazer without getting too hot.  The sleeve length is right on for the sizing and the cut is pretty smooth.  It's cut a tad small, so make sure to size accordingly when purchasing."
3.0,"Great for my high insteps, and the W is plenty wide enough for my usual 4E. They are easy to slip on in a dark bedroom, a must for me. The construction quality seems excellent too. A nice thick sturdy sole and a very cushioned heel. So why only 3 stars? Two problems: first, ""Ergonomic stride that stabilizes and gently propels your foot into the next step."" I really didn't need or want this and didn't realize just how much they'd 'propel' me forward when stepping. Walking along is OK, because after the first disorienting step you get ready, like walking downhill. But particularly tricky if I'm bending forward to perhaps pick something up. I feel like I'm going to tip over. This is also troubling when going down my basement stairs. The heel height is more pronounced than running shoes. Second, they do feel a bit hot compared to shearling/sheepskin after a while, say half an hour. Yes, I can just slip them off for a couple of minutes for heat relief, but that's not always convenient. My last slippers were Old Friend Men's Adjustable Strap Slipper, also velcro'd for the high insteps, but nice and flat and always temperate. Unfortunately with those they're not slip-ons so I ended up cutting out the heels."
3.0,"Reviews said to size up x2 and me having a larger chest area I did. It was too big and was baggy as if it was ruched in the front. I could have gotten an xl because it was stretchy and not sheer. It was a last minute dress for graduation so I had to wear it. I only wore it to the ceremony, never took off my gown to take pictures and went straight home to change and take pictures with my cap on and normal clothes. Will be returning."
3.0,"I bought this watch almost a year ago on Nov 17, 2017.  I have received many compliments.  Well, it stopped working after one year.  I had the battery changed last week and today, the jeweler said it’s the watch,....not the battery.  Is there any guarantee"
3.0,These sick are to short and don’t stay in place
3.0,"Ordered a medium and definitely could have used a small, love the style and print though!"
3.0,I liked the look of these but they were heavy! I gave mine to a friend. Great price!
3.0,These sandals run very small and are cheaply made.
3.0,"it's not the same color as shown, and more of a grey than blue. Very soft and comfy and fit well."
3.0,Earrings look good and seem to be a good quality.
3.0,"The watch had a difficult time putting on and adjusting it, had to watch a youtube video over 3 times just to fit my wrist. On the other hand, the packaging was very nice for the price."
3.0,"I purchased the 38/40 Apple Watch band and the as you can see where the band connects to the actual watch it sticks out on both ends and gets caught on things like my shirt. I selected the Green, Grey and Blue bands. The Green and Blue are nice rich colors as for the “Grey” in the photo it looks more like a Sage Green and not Grey. My pants are Grey and this band is not any shade of grey. I will be sending this back."
3.0,Color is odd not as shown
3.0,Cute top. I am 5’6 and it kind of fits like a crop top. But still cute!
3.0,"It's a good vest, but fit too loosely. Also, the photo is misleading. I thought it was going to be very slim and fitted, but it doesn't look like that at all."
3.0,The items are as pictured. The quality is very nice as well.
3.0,Okay quality. Weird smell. Color was as pictured. I actually wore mine for a costume - I probably wouldn't wear this on a regular day due to the quality.
3.0,Nice dress with a flattering line. I know it’s not very expensive but after washing it on a gentle cycle the fabric looked worn and cheap. So whilst this dress looks really good it’ll only be nice until you wash it.
3.0,Just because tey are cotton knit they are UV protection?
3.0,they dont fit right something just feels out of place like they are falling
3.0,"Very stiff, not comfy."
3.0,"Bought this for my son, who works in the freezer section of a large grocery store.  Much of his time is spent in the freezer at -40 below, or in the dairy cooler.  He stopped wearing this because it didn't seem to do much."
3.0,"Looks nice but it came all scuffed up. Pretty sure it was used. Still functions, looks ok, and the scuffs aren't noticeable from further away."
3.0,Kind of a weird design
3.0,"Very stylist item, but not warm.  Its just something to throw over a top at night.  More for summer wear. I wash and dried in the dryer, did not affect the sizing.  Holds up good after washing, but do not recommend for cold weather wear.  More for style."
3.0,"Es bueno, aunque la talla no creo que sea para un bebe"
3.0,bought 3 some good some not
3.0,Cute but waaaaaay shorter than the pic shows.
3.0,"Cute color. However, the buttons make it look cheap. The sleeves didn't have cuffs, but elastic. Not the best quality. I bought it for work because we always have to wear green. Definitely a china made fashion."
3.0,Received these had to get a replacement pair they had a runner in them when received both times. But I ordered several other colors and they came perfect.  They are little thinner than most but I love them and they look just like picture in color and design.
3.0,Kinda clingy  but cute
3.0,Material is just ok fir the price
3.0,Cheaply made. Very thin material.
3.0,The shoes were very wide and my daughter was complaining about the back of her ankle hurting.
3.0,It’s very beautiful but way to long around my neck. Bracelet was very large as well. There’s no way I could’ve worn that so I had to send it back.
3.0,"They are nice, backs stay on easy; but they are hard to get the backs on as the studs are short!"
3.0,Loved the shirt but it runs smaller
3.0,"I like the look of the jacket. It is a satin material, but I am a US 2X and I ordered a 5X and it doesn’t fit."
3.0,Makes it look like you have chewing tabacco. But its  a great quality wallet.
3.0,The dress itself is cute but it is pretty big. I'm almost always a small (sometimes a medium) in dresses--I'm 5'4&#34; and about 130lbs. I ordered this in a small and it is huge on me. The straps are too long also. I wish I ordered XS. A skinny belt made it much cuter.
3.0,The fabric is not cotton at all. It has a strange slinky not very stretchy feel. Very odd material
3.0,It is quite a bit smaller than my other teams mascots
3.0,I am not sure if I am doing something wrong. I do not see any difference.
3.0,The vital 2.0 black marl are very see-through when you bend over. Like extremely see-through that i couldnt show a picture. Its like an xray.... the legging material is very comfortable and soft but unfortunately cant wear in public. 🫣
3.0,"MY .99 cents (FWIW)<br />I bought this to try an ideal I had and it worked quite well, except this one is a little more see through probably because of the orange color. I always wear camis underneath my other clothes and shorts with dresses. It washes well and is pretty"" versilstretchy"" ways to wear. Examples of what I have done are scrunch the fabric by pulling it up and make a shirt, make a mini skirt, above, below knee and of course what it s made for maxi. You can also scrunch the sleeves to short sleeve and 3/4 and long. It is a little tight and would like for it not to be see through but I overcame that obstacle.  I have tried every way I just described and it works good for me. I would say this is ok for any age group but know it is see through so adapt accordingly. I would like to see it in PURPLE and some other colors. I hope this helps.<br /><br />NJ RECOMMENDED WITH ADAPTIONS"
3.0,"This purse was delivered on a Thursday. I swapped my belongings into it that night and took it to work the next day, where it did nothing but hang on a hook until I left for the day, then sat at home untouched until the following Saturday morning. While making a pit stop during a road trip the next day, the tassel fell apart while it was simply hanging from a hook in a bathroom stall. Very disappointing that a bag that costs this much would fall apart within days of receipt, especially when it was being treated so gently. I've since fixed the tassel myself, but I'm still a little irked. I've purchased quite a few Michael Kors bags and expect much better quality."
3.0,"The boot was hard to zip around the ankles. Once on the boots were comfortable to wear approximately 4 to 5  hours. The overall appearance of the boots are okay, one can tell that it is synthetic."
3.0,"Nice dress but doesn’t look like the photo. I ordered the black and it is very casual, not formal. Was looking for a dress to wear to a wedding and this was not it. I did keep it though because it’s a cute summer casual dress! The material is like a t-shirt material"
3.0,"They are pretty...however, especially if you have nails, they are difficult to manage.  They are very small and I have lost one already."
3.0,The hat was a little bulky but the sound is fine
3.0,"Dress is very pretty, but sizing definitely runs small."
3.0,Very pretty but the style not shown as it is very disappointed I have to return it back
3.0,Didn't care for theses. Too big
3.0,"The dress came with multiple stains on it, I had to return it."
3.0,I am 5'4 and 165 lbs. These pictures show me in a very unflattering XXL. I'm normally a L so these run really small. I wish they had worked but they were so unflattering. And I'm just not sure how I feel about the shiney material.
3.0,The bathing suits itself is nice looking but the color was more of an aqua then dark green as shown on the photo
3.0,Shoes came within two days. They look nice . I noticed some stitching on the side of one of the shoes was coming out. lot of platic on th shoe. very hard to put on even when the shoe was about 1 size to big. I wear usually 11.5 Men. it at least a 12.5 mens. putting them on was difficult because there is a elastic sock that is permanantly stitched in. i could barely get my foot into that sock. neat concept but not pratical. I have sent back with no problems.
3.0,Positives: The sunglasses fit snug which I like so you can bend over without them falling off. The lenses were pretty clear and there was only a little reflection from the side when looking away from the sun because of how large they were.<br />Negatives: Now I am out of a pair of sunglasses because I hopped in the water and the ear piece fell off the front lens frame. The tiny piece of metal holding the two pieces of bamboo together is too small. I thought about super gluing them but gave up and decided I would rather just try a different pair that wont need constant repairs.
3.0,ADJUSTABLE BAND NEEDS UPDATE
3.0,"I'm not sure that I like the material. It seems pretty cheap, but the shirt its self looks good, the image is nice and bright."
3.0,Beautiful product but one set came broken. Can I be sent a new one? Thanks<br /><br />All around. I would recommend these 0g 8mm. Not cheap feeling.
3.0,"Ordered these for a costume. They arrived in pieces. You can tell that the flowers were once glued to the leather, but it didn't hold. They were not hanging from the top of the earrings as they appear in the listing photo. Also, the centers are a yellowish color rather than white. I didn't really care about the flowers though and was planning to remove them anyway.<br /><br />However, the edge of the blue leather is actually bright white and really stands out. The earrings are large and hit the side of my face/neck which is irritating, and the main reason I'm returning them. The bouncing also causes the white edge to show more. It could probably be improved by running a blue sharpie along the edge.<br /><br />Overall if you're looking for large, cheap earrings that you don't mind modifying, these are ok for the price."
3.0,"There are some perfectly fine features of this piece of bling from certain perspectives. It's heavy, nice-looking, and has a well-made clasp. The design goes well with a youthful, urban look, the reason I ordered it. Still I was very disappointed in how short it turned out to be, arguably due to my own misunderstanding about how it would look when worn. It's just way too short, fitting more like a choker than a necklace. This is especially true when worn by a man. It might look and fit better on a petite woman but really seems pretty ridiculous on a guy, especially a relatively big one. I ordered this chain for those occasions when a I feel like sporting a edgy or old-skol vibe. This short chain will not provide that for a relatively large guy like me. It's fine for a small lady, though."
3.0,"Very nice hat. Thick, and fleece lined. Plus it sounds good when you play music.<br /> I dont like the cheap looking labels, that say WASH. IRIE,  stuck on the outside with hot glue. I dont get it?"
3.0,"The description says the large should fit a men's size 8-12, but they are very snug on a men's size 10, they definitely would not fit a bigger foot. They seem sturdy enough. They are thinner than most hiking socks. They are not very breathable. Far too hot for summer. We prefer wool socks for breathability. The pattern is an odd mixture of colors, with a very feminine rose pink, and a masculine pine green. There is an embroidered logo on the top guff that chafes and is annoying.  Overall, these are ok, but I wouldn't recommend them."
3.0,"Purple color is a more dull in person than what is poctures, and the white line is a faded pink. Fit is as expected"
3.0,Pretty but bigger and heavier than expected. Not dainty like I'd hoped. Returning.
3.0,"I'm small, and the top of the dress fits perfectly, but the skirt has way too much material. I am totally lost in it. Also the top back is lace and you can see through it."
3.0,"Is a beautiful band, the problem is when I cut the ends so that they fit on my wrist, they are rough and scrape the skin."
3.0,"It does the job, but it's cloth."
3.0,We sized up based on reviews of fitting too small and they are a little too big.
3.0,The fit doesn't feel secure.
3.0,"This shirt is super cute but runs a bit big.  Also, I wish the fabric was more breathable as this is something I would grab in the summer months but it's much too warm to wear in hot weather."
3.0,"Disappointed by the fact it says &lt;Organic Cotton> in it's description, yet I couldn't see it on the wrapping, it only says 100% cotton."
3.0,"It served its purpose for my costume, but is something you’d find at the dollar store. I’m grateful it was available for me to get in time to wear to an event, but will probably never wear it again!"
3.0,Received bag today. Ordered ballet received cherry. The only reason I'm keeping it is because I like the color. Service not too fast either. Bag is very nice. Just not what I orderred
3.0,It seems thin for 4 ply .  The ear loops are loose
3.0,"The shirt is decent quality and the print is good. The material is soft. However it runs at least a size smaller. Im normally a 2x, this was just too tight. I gave it to my size Large sister. It was a little loose on her but not too bad. She liked it."
3.0,Watch was very nice but small on the wrist a little tight had to put it on the last latch
3.0,"I put these on & immediately noticed a big picker of fabric at my heel & knew that would never fit in a shoe. (See pic)<br />Then I saw how the seams were slightly pulling & looked like a hole would form soon.<br />But they were thin & soft, so I kept them on all day walking around inside & they’re perfect for that!<br />So they’re my new favorite house sock? That probably won’t last long but I’ll enjoy while I can!"
3.0,Got XX-Large for someone who would fit between a  small to medium shirt but this is tooooooooooooo small. Should have heeded the reviews. The print is nice. Love the color. However the shirt is not aligned correctly from the neck to left shoulder and part of the stitches are coming loose.
3.0,"Runs small, I’m also a man"
3.0,Absolutely adorable shirt!! Just ran on the smaller side.
3.0,After 6weeks…
3.0,"These are super large and warm;however, they immediately start unraveling with random strings hanging off or snag. Super sad."
3.0,I love these except there's no hole in the front to go to the bathroom.
3.0,"They aren’t very clear, and pinch a bit."
3.0,"It was not at all “dusty rose” as the picture was more of a dark purple and the dress was definitely red. Also, I think a size would have been better— the cup size is the one thing you can’t adjust! Otherwise it is mostly what we thought. (Now to figure out how to shorten the tulle hem for someone 5’4”!)"
3.0,I lost it first time wearing because the back doesn't have the closure wheelie thing to keep the pin latched.
3.0,Heavy duty but doesn't hold pants tightly down and can't adjust them any smaller than they are.
3.0,"Not really for children, they are very large."
3.0,Running a bit small however color and design really cute and definitely not a push up for sure
3.0,Comfy shirt. Silk feels very nice. Fit is just slightly smaller than I'd prefer but not enough to be upset over.<br /><br />What I am unhappy about is the erroneous description. The &#34;black&#34; color option is actually dark gray. I have four-year-old black t-shirts that are quite faded and yet still darker than this shirt.<br /><br />I'll happily revise my review if the description is updated accordingly.
3.0,"The paint was smudged, and the clock stopped working after a few weeks. I decided since it took so long to get here just to go ahead and keep it, but to replace the watch mechanism with a professional. I doubt I will ever order over seas again with anyone. It seems I get a bad deal in some way"
3.0,"It looks cute but the sizes are so messed up.  I first ordered a medium and it was too big so I reordered the small and it was huge!! Way bigger than the medium.  The material seems cheap, like shinny looking."
3.0,"It's a cute dress, but I'm short and it's an awkward length on me. Nice, stretchy material."
3.0,"Picture is not true to color, actual pants are much more orange."
3.0,"Simple, okay, nothing fancy.  But that's what I expected and needed."
3.0,My daughters like them. But i find the material cheap as it is made from plastic.
3.0,"Wider than the typical pair, which helps when you have a big head. Still wish it were wider still, but overall a great fit. FYI I wear a size 8 fitted hat so you get an idea of my noggin size.<br /><br />Update:  But I have to downgrade them after the frames broke after a few months' use.  Totally babied these things at my desk, but the frames snapped around the lens and now they're useless.  Considering buying another pair though, since finding ones these big/wide are hard..."
3.0,The cloth is too thin.
3.0,Cute dress but not a good fit.  The torso was too long for me.  I would've had to alter the dress and there was not enough time for that.
3.0,lockets do not stay closed
3.0,Too large and weak on color
3.0,Sleeves were too loose for me.
3.0,"It's cute, covers up ALOT, and pretty big, it's a certain style forsure, not for everyone"
3.0,Shoes were bigger then expected
3.0,This is a very cute shirt however it does run slightly small so make sure you check the size chart.
3.0,BETTER THEN THE OTHER SET I BROUGHT..
3.0,"This was quite flimsy.  Talk about a thin leather band, it's like they cut it with a vibratome.  It was ok for the money, but you might as well spring for something a bit nicer."
3.0,I think the sizing is off. I normally wear a small in all dresses and this was way too big in a size small. All areas fit larger than expected. It is a cute dress and made well with soft material and the sequins stay on. I have this dress to a friend and she loves it! She's a size 6-8 Medium normally.
3.0,not slim cut
3.0,The dress is cute and it's true to size but it is VERY sheer. You definitely need to wear some kind of slip/sheath underneath. I like the design and wish I could find the same dress in different colors!
3.0,Does not look like picture. Material things and cheap and runs big. Not chic at all.. very casual and doesn't fit like model
3.0,"These are NOT waterproof and I think would probably only be good ski gloves for spring skiing.  They don't seem like bad gloves, but definitely advertised incorrectly."
3.0,O.k. nothing out of the ordinary.
3.0,"Little smaller than expected, but did the trick for a costume"
3.0,Cheap and stretch - big! SHREDDING!
3.0,"The sleeves are too short. In the picture it looks like the sleeve ends around the middle of her hand but on me the sleeve doesn’t even go all the way to my hand, I’m 5’3 with average size arms and ordered a large. The material is pretty itchy too. Returning."
3.0,"It looked nice, but broke too easily.  He didn't have it a day before, as he was trying to straighten it out, it broke."
3.0,"I have recently purchased apair of the Pajama Jeans in the ""bootcut"" style.  They are not bootcut - more like bell bottoms from the 70's. And they stretched out some - which was not a problem since they were big in the legs anyway.  But, I really liked them - very comfy and look nice.  So, I tried this skinny straight leg. They are very comfortable but look more like jeggings than skinny jeans.  I thought they might stretch some like the ""bootcut"" jeans did - but they did not.  I was a little disappointed but keptthem because they are comfy.  Will probably wear them with a long top & tall boots.  I recommend them for the comfort - but if you want skinny jeans and not jeggings - don't order these."
3.0,"definitely makes you sweat, but if you get this you should try out one of those fat burning creams too paired with the belt. twice the burn."
3.0,"Thin material. Can see through. Need to wear a shirt under, but cute!"
3.0,"Nice but could be better.<br /><br />Pros: These are super comfortable, nice and stretchy. The material is thick and soft. High waisted!<br /><br />They are squat approved. No issues with full range of motion.<br /><br />Cons: I ordered a size medium as per the size chart. I know I’m not a size 0-2, but I think a size small would have been better. These are even a little bit loose around the tops of my thighs. There is no butt lift for me either, guess my booty is too flat! Or again it could be the sizing issue. These are not tight on me at all. For reference, I carry my weight on my belly, hips and thighs. They are a little long, had to roll them up, but I’m short at 5’3”<br /><br />Overall, they’re not bad, perhaps I would have liked them more in a smaller size, but they’ll work for yoga and strength training."
3.0,"Nicely made, nice fabric but runs small through the bust."
3.0,It’s a bit small for my wrist.
3.0,Love the shirt. The sizing is off.  Too small.
3.0,"I was really excited to order this product, but when I received it I was a bit disappointed. It is advertised as &#34;prayer beads meditation mala&#34;. Traditionally, a mala will have 108 beads to help you keep track of the repetition of your mantra during meditation. This piece does not have 108 beads. It is also more ornamental than anything. It is a cute piece and is very nice and earthy. I will wear it, but still am a bit disappointed at the number of beads. I don't know if I would use this during my meditation practice.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review"
3.0,"It filters pretty well.... if it fits your nose.<br /><br />I have a wide nose bridge (Italian style?) and I find myself having to position it very carefully to be sure there aren't large open-air gaps up there (went so far as to use a dental mirror to test it out).<br /><br />Supposedly there's only one size, but the japanese sites show 3... if only I read kanji.<br /><br />If you have a small nose buying these is a good idea, but if you're wondering ""will this fit?"" I'd suggest going with 'breathpure' nose filers. though not currently sold on amazon. They're cheaper, uglier, and come in a variety of sizes for your under or over sized schnoz."
3.0,"Has a overwhelming smell of chemicals however, otherwise it's a nice bag."
3.0,"Very small, not sure my 14 y/o daughter will be able to wear it - but cute nonetheless"
3.0,Not compact at all. Yes it fits and looks very nice but it's also thin. Price is good for 3 tops
3.0,"The bottoms fit perfectly, but the top is just awful. I followed sizing guidelines, and the top is just poorly designed. The top is too loose and the bra portion has zero support. I will have to wear a t-shirt to prevent embarrassment. So disappointed, I should have known better."
3.0,"Order a size smaller . Cute but not keeping. Dots on front misaligned and back looks better on front. I’m 5’7, 143#, ordered S, feel like an XS would have fit better. Made in China"
3.0,Unfortunately I wasn’t a fan of this. The stones on this necklace were very plastic looking and were badly glued on. I wouldn’t recommend this piece of jewelry.
3.0,Super cute design and well made but I will need to update once I return and get the right size for my daughter. She wears a size 1 in kids. I ordered a 1.5. The shoes fits more like a 3 or 3.5.
3.0,Sent back could not figure out.
3.0,"Legs are to short when sitting on bike, and I have short legs.  On the plus side, they fit ok and have a lot of protection and ok in rain"
3.0,"Large and kind of an open weave. Shrank tighter after a wash, as you would expect wool to do, but felted a bit. Still very warm, and cozy."
3.0,Didn't really fit my face well.
3.0,"material was a little clingy so you may want to go up one size if you want is a little more flowing.  Was a cute shirt, but for some reason I felt it looked a little like the outfit Lt Uhura wore in Star Trek, so unfortunately I had to send back"
3.0,"Smelled like mold and mildew, but heavy duty looking I haven't tried it yet cause every time I go near the smell about makes me sick"
3.0,"Perfect top, bottms were an xs rather than small.  Cant use them, and have still to find bottoms. Description was incorrect. Description was incorrect by seller. Was listed as sm. Was actually an xsm."
3.0,"Received my sweater I love it, comfortable warm but the sleeve came with a rip in it😑"
3.0,Love how soft this dress is but VERY thin material! It will show all your curves and rolls if too tight at all or not loose enough. It has no padding in the chest which I love! And its pretty far above my ankle in length. I'm 6'1. But over all I love the feel and how the chest fits. But going to return as its too thin and might shrink in dryer causing it to be too tight
3.0,Soft and comfy. Good for nursing.
3.0,Its cute looks just like the picture but the glitter part started to pull away from the band within a couple days i super glued it back so hopefully that holds
3.0,Really like this visor.  Only problem the sequins could possible loosen & come off.  Is<br /><br />there anything I can spray on them to keep that from happening?
3.0,"The ones I received are so dark, it's hard to tell that they're purple.  I do like the design, though.  The ball on the end of the hook is cute."
3.0,"They were good gloves for winter use. But they are not good gloves for woodworking or any kind of mechanical use. The rubber grips on the palms wore off immediately. And a hole wore into the thumb after three days of wood working. They are comfortable and warm. Work well for shoveling snow, but do get wet fast when there worn out."
3.0,Fit foot too small on leg xxl
3.0,The elastic around the waste and legs are super tight and uncomfortable.
3.0,"It is beautiful and soft, but it is much warmer than I was expecting.  Now I don’t know just when I will use it.  It doesn’t breath."
3.0,"Had to return as this particular shoe was too small and too narrow for son's foot. Otherwise, no issues with ordering or returning."
3.0,"I ordered this dress for an event, received the dress and it was too small I ended up buying the next size up and it was an exact fit (2xl)"
3.0,"Weird boxy fit.<br />I returned it.<br />Good quality shirt, though."
3.0,"I got these for my daughter, she loves them! Sadly, one of the eye guards came off - Would be great if they came with extras. No need for ear plugs, replacement eye guards would be much better! Will order another pair if I can't find something sturdier."
3.0,It’s super cute but came broken
3.0,I love these glasses tjey look the coolest on me. However they fall off the ears all the time slip easy and the logo came off while opening the package. Looks great comferts a bust tho
3.0,Love the hat itself!!  BUT......for a Large/XL hat this hat fits really tight.  I have an SRH hat from years ago (and other flex fit LARGE/XL hats) that are the same size on the tags that fit great.  This is the smallest LARGE/XL hat I have ever purchased.  Figured no sense in sending back as they do not have any larger sizes....but this hat is definitely tight!
3.0,"Great wallet for being a fan of the show, its big and spacious enough for all my cards and $500 in $20's. However one of my cards got stuck inside a card slot and when i pulled it out. The inside cloth (adhesive?) apparently got stuck to my card and ripped out and stuck to my card."
3.0,it works well but not so perfect
3.0,For the cost product is inferior- also size is small compared to size chart information.
3.0,Should have ordered a larger size
3.0,"Definitely have to wear white or nude underwear for this dress, but not a hassle. I ordered an XL-size 10. I’m 5’1 & 145 lbs. the dress is a little long for my liking and the top is too big. I’m a 36B with bigger arms so I thought the XL would fit great, but it’s too big up top. Sizes are smaller waist down but larger in the chest area."
3.0,beautiful. but beware if you are petite. the bodice is long.
3.0,Needs a zip pocket on both sides!
3.0,The plastic nose clip point of them pick the nose and uncomfortable .
3.0,This is a canvas wallet that is DINGY looking. Definitely not worth the cost!!!!
3.0,"I bought these for my husband.  He has Parkinson's and has very little flexibility, so I put them on for him.  I have arthritis in my thumbs and find it extremely difficult to put them on for him.  The sox themselves are very nice, and he says they are very comfortable."
3.0,Nice looks but easily broken
3.0,"Works very well on more loosely woven material, the point isn’t small enough or sharp enough for more dense. It is easy to use & very attractive."
3.0,Very thin material.  Had strands that I had to cut off.
3.0,"Good enough if temp is over 25 degrees, otherwise, may want to wear both simultaneously."
3.0,"Very pretty but, both shoulder strap broke the 1st time it was worn. Not for people 5'4 & under...it dragged on the floor"
3.0,"Ok fit, but quality looked cheap for the money. Had to return."
3.0,The clasp broke and the pendant fell off .. But I fixed it with super glue
3.0,Ran Small
3.0,"Hate that you can easily see the cups, because this is a lovely design.  Would be 5 stars if I could remove the cups"
3.0,It's definitely not the best quality and the August birthstone is more yellow than green. It did have the engraving on the inside rub off on my finger a bit. But it's pretty.
3.0,"I am 5'4 and 135 lbs with a 36B chest. I purchased the medium in gray. I liked the color and material. Zipper caught the fabric and was tricky. The coat was slightly snug across the chest, but I might have kept if it wasn't huge in the hip area. Also too long and hit at the knee."
3.0,Was super cheap made
3.0,Color blue gold and silver 😳
3.0,"I bought these for running, they are super soft, buy the waist does not stay in place when doing everyday activities let alone when I run. There is nothing more annoying than having to pull your pants up when running."
3.0,"Had a strong order when arrived but was easily solved , beautiful purse."
3.0,"I love this bathing suit, it looked exactly like the photo but it is best suited for shorter people. I'm about 5'11 and it pulled in all the wrong places"
3.0,"The neck is REALLY tight.  Parents, be prepared for a battle getting this over your kid's head."
3.0,Fit was great but this dress isn't for larger busted women because the fabric stretches and appears lighter in that area. It's because the pattern is printed on a white background so when the fabric stretches over the bust it appears whiter.
3.0,"for kids or adults with small heads, only"
3.0,The color was more vivid than I expected from a the picture.  It was more of a vivid pink than a pale pink.  It was tight across the bustline.
3.0,The seams rip very easy but it looks amazing otherwise
3.0,Very cute sturdy but it looks like a size 6 instead of size 5 my daughter won't grow into it until next year.
3.0,"This dress is very cute and I loved it! Ordered size 10 and it fit perfect but after trying it on, it wasn't for me. I returned. No complaints on the dress!"
3.0,I wasn't sure about this skirt. For the record the colors are very pretty and vibrant. I love the fact that it has an elastic band in the back. I also love the pockets what I'm not sold on is the material. This skirt is a polyester blend and it looks very shiny. There's no way you can wear this skirt with a denim shirt as they showed in the picture. I am returning because I just don't like the material.
3.0,"A little disappointed with these. After looking for white linen pants I decided to buy these based on the reviews and the price. I’m normally a small and the fit was perfect, I suggest ordering your normal size or if you’re in between sizing up. But these are definitely not any kind of white pants you can wear out, they are completely see through. I’ll be using these as beach pants only."
3.0,Esta bonita solo que es más pequeña de la talla
3.0,Good spring coat Not too heavy Add a clothes shaver to this purchase you’ll need it
3.0,I was expecting a sweat suit which is thicker material and this was more like pajamas. Just want people to know it really isn’t a sweat suit
3.0,"The glasses were good quality for the price, but they came up in a search I did for &#34;sunglasses for small faces&#34; and they are much too large. Had to return them."
3.0,Close ! but No cigar for !! The cotton is weak !! either not enough being used or very low Quality in cotton !! the Style is close !! that's the only Plus I will give you !! and for what your charging !! You should be ashamed of yourselves. I will be ordering X-Large !! Because the Large fits like a Medium on me. I will take the hit on not Ordering right size...<br /><br />  Thank you !! for taking the time..<br />  J.D. So. Fla
3.0,The script is very small. I don’t think my mom will be able to read it. I will say that the customer service of Annamate considering my feedback is top notch.
3.0,Nice shirt but material way to thin
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, but the measurements are all wrong.  It's small in the bust. two inches or more than it should be.  The rest of the dress fit well. I bought a size 8.  The bust was two sizes too small. The rest of the dress from waist down was perfect.  I had it measures professionally because I loved it too much.  The bust instead of 35 1/5, it was 33 ins.  Sadly, I had to return it."
3.0,Love the material and design. Way too small.
3.0,Not good. Just all around not good. Too long and big
3.0,It's beautiful and arrived quickly but it broke off the stem. I can probably crazy glue it but then I'd be worried about it all the time.
3.0,Magnetic clasp breaks off easily making the bracelet a piece of rope and nothing more. I will never by another. But since it got replaced I am happy with the one.. till it breaks.
3.0,I really like the shirt although it’s a little tight and hand wash only. If I would have realized that I would not have purchased
3.0,Looks good but not big enough to use as a  doo rag
3.0,"This shirt is soft and well made. I liked being able to choose the length; however, the bottom of the shirt seemed to get stretched out very quickly so that it now looks oversized. I would order again but not for $30"
3.0,"Good sunglasses, they worked well till they broke. They are built very light and they do not repair with super glue."
3.0,Beautiful but far too small and tight :(
3.0,"Delivery came in time and boots are cute. They fit great, but I have one concern. I could not tell from the picture that they are more dressy than I wanted. I just want some cute winter boots to go with my jeans, but they do not look right with jeans at all. They are taller than I expected as well. May be perfect for skinny jeans or leggings, but will not wear with regular jeans. This is unfortunate because I don't wear anything else unless I have to dress up for a special occasion."
3.0,Had I love my mom on the back
3.0,"I had to resew the band in back because was not sewn properly, cuffs are way too large and does not fit snug on my wrists so I will be doing some alterations. the shirt fits perfect and is a nice look"
3.0,I like this vest pretty well my husbands ororo vest is better all the way around. But this one was for me and I didn’t want to match his. It’s fine. The battery pack is big and doesn’t last long. You have to turn it on before you can press the button to heat the jacket. Seems like it shouldn’t be that way.  Luckily the jacket is stretchy around the hips or it definitely wouldn’t zip.
3.0,It was longer than expected but good quality and runs a little large
3.0,It’s cute but it’s very disappointing for the price.<br />It was for a baptism and we thought paying this amount of money we were going to get a higher quality item.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:cd7ce1d6000f8b00ce3fe2dfce092c90]] It's a beautiful dress, mines came damaged. Nice material."
3.0,Poor quality and the fit was a joke.<br />They were supposed to be plus size and would maybe fit a size 10 or 12.
3.0,"The kimono was great (and what I bought it for), but the swim suit was not well made. The top was too short and the seems on both the top and bottom were fraying in multiple places. The Kimono was a great fit though. I ended up buying 2, just for the different kimono styles."
3.0,bought my usual size but i guess for this designer i'll need to go up a size.  the cut was smaller than anticipated.  Had to wear a shirt under.
3.0,Its okay I was expecting more of a sweatshirt material but other than that its cute
3.0,These are a little on the flimsy side for larger gauges. I have 1 inch and they kept rolling up. I'm sure they would be perfect for smaller sizes. They're very thin but the colors are great!
3.0,"I ordered a 1xl (20-22w), which is larger than my normal 18, & the shirts are a bit short. They don't quite reach my waist, so some of my mid section shows. I just ordered them as shirts to wear around the house, so its not a complete waste. I wish they had bigger sizes, I'd order them again, they are super soft & comfy."
3.0,I love the purse. The color described or shown I'm the picture are not what I received. Hopefully they have the correct one to swap out.
3.0,Dress was nice looking but the style/fit did not look good on me.
3.0,"Ordered 2 sizes bigger and it's still tight, but nice jacket just order 3 sizes larger"
3.0,"I got these for my 85 yo father, so I can't really comment on the fit details. The pant legs are much wider than I thought though - I think he just wears them to sleep in because they're too baggy for him."
3.0,"This is a very cute dress, but it's a little tight under the arms."
3.0,The zippered compartments are too short.  I am in the process of buying a smaller wallet to see if that helps.  Nice material.
3.0,"Wife washed before my daughter could wear it, and both ears fell off in the wash.  Not high quality stitching on this."
3.0,"Looks cheap...made do, but wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Much larger then I thought. I was picturing a clutch but this is a normal sized purse.
3.0,"I wish they fit better and came in better colors but, they are ok. I wouldn't buy more though."
3.0,"different from the photo, but It is great!"
3.0,"It's not so much the size of the shirt that runs small... it's the length.  I'm 5'3, and the length hits right at the belly-button.  Even a &#34;short&#34; kurta isn't that short.  It should--at least--cover your stomach and butt!  At this length, the shirt has a much more boxy looked than the model picture would suggest.  I like the material, however.  The cotton has a little sheen.  At the price paid, I'll just keep it as a kick-around-the-house shirt."
3.0,Giving it 3 stars because they are very well made and I really wish I had time to return and reorder before the event I need them for! Runs super small!!! Normally wear a small and even the medium is too small!!!!
3.0,Its fake ofc its cheap n yurns Brown on the chain like its getting tusted but cute
3.0,"Not quite big enough for an adult head, but good in a pinch."
3.0,"Avoid spraying perfume on your neck when wearing this, it will turn color"
3.0,Shrank after washing.  Order one size up.  Other than that great color and screen printing.
3.0,"Cute, but way too big and the synthetic fabric kept getting caught in my mouth and felt smothery"
3.0,"Disappointed in the quality, picture is deceiving I feel like.  Coloring was a bit off too.<br /><br />Felt like it was going to be soft to the touch, and velour like, and a bit heavier than it is, but I took a shot."
3.0,"fits snug and i don't like that , sizing runs a bit small"
3.0,"Great design, and it made for a funny stocking-stuffer for my husband.  The material is very thin, though, even for a t-shirt."
3.0,I’m sure this will be fine for those who are smaller on top. Otherwise you might look pregnant. Seems like a comfy top otherwise. I sent it back. Lots of people will like it though. Soft and relaxed.
3.0,Not solid stainless steel case. Bezel is trash but overall looks good for the price.
3.0,It's cheap cost and cheap quality but good for a trip or two
3.0,"It looks really nice and just like picture, but the material itself is very cheap and might not be as warm as expected."
3.0,most of mine were pot leaf or skulls not a fan but their cheep and work great no problems :)
3.0,Slim size to large in waist for a slim built 2 yr. old
3.0,Overall this the style and material I am looking for. But ultimately I could not even button these shorts.
3.0,They fit on your head but these are kindve small
3.0,"Shipping was very fast, once I received the product I noticed the face mask had tons of scratches and looked like it was used. The body suit has a small zipper in the back which is nice however the zipper should have come down a lot more as it was very hard to step into. There is padding in the arms and upper chest area. The padding in the arms made it a little difficult to get my arms through and felt a little scratchy on my arms. If you are a normal women’s size large I would try to order a size up as it’s a little bit smaller than mentioned in the details( though the fabric is a little stretchy, I would still order a size larger)  I also found a number of holes where the fabric wasn’t fully sewn. Luckily i ordered in advance so I will be able to mend these areas before I wear it for family Halloween. I’m really disappointed with the mask it came with and I will most likely either paint my face or look for another mask in the stores."
3.0,"Helped with glare, but sit crooked on my face and have some rough edges, so not comfortable to wear.. Feel cheap for the price."
3.0,Weird how there is no product tag.  Makes me wonder how this shirt was acquired.
3.0,Neck to chest: too big (unless you have a DD)<br />Stomach to floor: the fit is amazing<br />Very beautiful dress especially if you get it altered
3.0,I feel like chubaka in it 😂 but it's super comfy for around the house
3.0,Their sizing is off.
3.0,Bought this to hold multiple key cards. Worked great until it broke apart.
3.0,Not as pictured. Still acceptable.
3.0,Oddly shaped and somewhat tight on the sides even though very wide in the front.
3.0,The band is very nice but the white gold is a little more tan in color. Nice option for something a little more dressy. What I didn’t like was how The magnetic end came all the way around to the other side of the watch face. I have a small wrist but didn’t see any options for a smaller band. :(
3.0,This chain is very pretty however I ordered a 20 inch chain and this chain was barely 19 inches including the clasp.  Overall it is nice looking and works with my jewelry.  Probably would have given it 5 stars if it was the full 20 inches as described.
3.0,"I like this, but it is too thin to be worn alone. I wear a disposable mask and dress it up with one of these. Thy fit well and the ear loops are comfortable."
3.0,I liked the style but the crotch started to split. A hole after wearing them twice is unacceptable. I returned them with ease and received a full refund.
3.0,The fit was a little snug for me. it does stretch but just not flatting on me. It felt comfortable when I tried it on.<br />I personally do not like snug fit items. I am older & its not flattering if I do.<br />If you like snug I would reccommend it.
3.0,Nice look and feel of the fabric. Label says the color might transfer to skin or fabric! Haven’t worn it yet because of that.
3.0,I image of the dress appear to be dressy. When I received the dress is too long and and cheap looking.
3.0,"Material isn’t as expected. Doesn’t fit oversized as the picture would lead you to believe, even if you order a big size. I typically wear a medium and I ordered an XL because I wanted an oversize T-shirt but was disappointed. The sleeves are tight not oversized. Color and design are as pictured."
3.0,very difficult to connect and lock clasp
3.0,"Size runs a little small, two separate zippers to be able to get into it, hood is giant, overall great costume, I just needed a size up :/"
3.0,Buyer beware!! This top is dry clean only!!
3.0,"Unfortunately not super durable. Coating already coming off the cork, looks too untidy to be worn to work. Shame, as otherwise it's a decent belt, and plant-based options are hard to find."
3.0,"Nice coat but received it with a hole in it. I didn't send it back because I know how to sew, thankfully. I'm glad I ordered a size up or it would have been too small. I love the color and look forward to wearing it more though I've only worn it a few times and now one of the buttons fell off. Feeling more disappointed but it's a warm coat."
3.0,"My daughter loves this case! The glasses that come with it are not durable at all, very flimsy and seems like it came from the dollar tree. Luckily, I did not buy this set for the sunglasses. I only needed the case which does the job of keeping my 6 year old daughters eye glasses protected!"
3.0,I bought a size larger and it's still too small
3.0,"Nice, but sizing is a bit small.  Had to return for a large. (Granddaughter wears an 8 and these barely fit me and I wear a 7)."
3.0,Product looks just like picture.  Problem is with the spin of the ring. Does not spin freely and moves slow. It feels gritty when turning. For a finger fidgeter it's no good.
3.0,I like the purse I just wish it had more room on the inside.
3.0,Tight and see through with ginormously long sleeves. It is beautiful. Just doesn't fit me right
3.0,"I thought it was more yellow, but it was more orange.<br />Has a good fit. I was worth the price for Polyester."
3.0,"Did measure fingers!  Both rings are beautiful, but do not fit me or my wife."
3.0,Great fit but it has a very strange odor.
3.0,This case is almost great. The color and quality is great except for one issue. The clasp that closes it is not as secure as I hope for. Unless it is inside a tight spot it will not stay closed. I can work with this issue because I have placeD the case inside of a wristlet for now but if I ever decide to just drop it in a purse or bag it probably would pose a problem.<br />I have received this case at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
3.0,Turned blackbafter 2nd use
3.0,Quality was ok.  Beautiful color
3.0,"Once I learned of Facebook groups that provide free products for a 5 star review, I am leery of all reviews. As a result, I feel I should leave honest reviews for all items purchased on Amazon.<br /><br />I returned the shirt without even trying it on...the print looked/felt cheap to me. There were a number of Christmas tshirts Id rather spend the money on."
3.0,Ill keep trimming them hoping for a better fit..........I have a high arch
3.0,I will say that you get a lot of jewelry for next to nothing here. The only downfall is that they do tarnish easily.
3.0,These run small and tight compared to other Adidas sweats at the hip.
3.0,Yikes!! Having ELASTIC BAND holding the top tier of skirt at crotch level...<br />So SUDDENLY i looked as though i not just had a GUT but actual DUDE junk... Woah.
3.0,Tore the second practice she wore it to
3.0,"Since I’m so short, it was big on me. But I like baggy clothes. And it doesn’t shrink when you wash it."
3.0,Runs wide and short. And the material could be better.
3.0,"Because I'm tall its a really short dress, but with some leggings or just around the house where  an awesome dress and love the fit just not the length."
3.0,"It's a cute necklace ,but the only thing I dislike about it is that the color faded after just wearing it one day ."
3.0,cross wasnt the size i expected was a bit too small plus the piece that hold the cross onto the necklace was nearly same size as cross  doesnt look as nice to me
3.0,Muy comodo pero llego roto
3.0,Bought this for gift i don't know it's look cheap item :(
3.0,"I like how low these are cut in the front so they don't show much.  They breath nicely, are thin and are soft and stay in place. However, two negatives - they are extremely light in color so when they do show, it's very obvious. They should be a darker &#34;nude&#34; color. Also, the tab at the back has fallen off on some of the &#34;socks&#34; after just a few washings, found the tabs in the bottom of the washer.  They don't stay on well when the tab is missing.  Should have returned them."
3.0,"If you're a 3X, Get a 4X"
3.0,"Thin fabric. Tight weave. Great if you have tiny legs. They go just above the knees if your 5'6"" tall"
3.0,There are way too many with Marijuana leaves on them. I feel they should not be included at all because they are inappropriate. Out of the 25 I ordered I got 7 with a Marijuana leaf on it.
3.0,Like material and color
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:644afff50151c3c6bd93feda808f370d]] The glasses have an odd sparkly design at the sides, which I did not see in the initial pictures. I’ve attached a video.<br /><br />I dislike the sparkles, but the glasses over all are sturdy, and the frames look nice on."
3.0,"I bought these with the hope that they would cut down on wind when riding my motorcycle.  In short, they do not.<br /><br />The glasses quality is not high, but it's a shade higher than the bargain basement el-cheapo quality.  Looks like they could survive a few spills.  One plus is the leather sides look is in, so even though they are completely decorative, they still serve that purpose.<br /><br />Had to go right out and buy different riding glasses (Wiley-X echo's - which are phenomenal by the way), but kept these since they are cheap and semi stylish."
3.0,"So have to start by saying I was having a lot of issues waking up in the morning as many I think have struggled and why they go this route. Unfortunately, all other efforts either were pointless or very disruptive for my wife causing her to be the one to wake up just to wake me up. After going on this way for months I decided to bite the bullet and buy this thing. Price alone was almost enough to not go through with it but I was desperate and needed an actual solution.<br /><br />This thing actually does what it is intended to do but only when it works. I purchased this on March 22nd and used it for a good 3-4 weeks with mostly positive experiences, however, there were a handful of times in which this thing just did not work. I have shared my alarm settings below which are no joke, at 100% you will feel this thing and you definitely will not want the shock again so missing any of them or sleeping past them is visually impossible. Unfortunately, this wasn't always the case and this thing would just not do anything, nothing went off.<br /><br />Now, I don't know if this is due to the watch itself or the app but regardless one will not work without the other. So for this, I am very upset and confused because I never really experienced this at the beginning. One thing that could potentially be the cause of this is due to the plastic portion (which is tin) of the unit that has cracked on mine. This has left the 2 metal sides to be loose and unhinged to the point that I can dismantle it and pull out the internals. Luckily, Amazon has sent a replacement so will have to see if that makes a difference. Nonetheless, for this to happen within the use of I'd say 3 weeks is not ok on a $150 product. Maybe their 3rd generation does not have this issue but now I am genuinely nervous about this happening again.<br /><br />For now, my rating stands at 3 stars because I have mixed feelings. On one end yes it shocks me and get's me up faster than I ever have but second, to that it has failed me at times and the build quality is definitely lacking. I will run the replacement for as long as it works and doesn't fall apart and if needed will update this review.<br /><br />Settings/Alarms:<br />Monday-Friday (6:30 AM Vibration: 100%, Beep: 50%, Shock: 100%. 15 sec interval, Snooze Zap)<br />  (6:50 AM Vibration: 100%, Beep: 50%, Shock: 100%. 15 sec interval, Jumping Jacks x10)"
3.0,I really like these gauges! I put them in as soon as I got them and few hours later my ears were starting to bother me. I have sensitive ears so it's hard to find metal that works. I am in college and looking for jobs this year so I will keep them for the occasion. Again very beautiful but it doesn't react well with me.
3.0,The product was good and it seems like a nice piece but the chain was not intended for an adult but a child. I should have read the product description more carefully and will in the future but it's good for the price.
3.0,I order them cuz my 5 years old daughter liked them. When I got it one of the screws doesn't work right but she didn't want me to return them so she is wearing one for now but I think I'm going to have to return it.
3.0,it is smaller than i was expecting and not as glitzy as expected but it looks nice on chain  would recommend
3.0,"skinny ties can have the 1-1.5&#34; tie bars b/c so thin, so purchased 2&#34; tie clips b/c hubby wears more traditional 3&#34; ties - problem, front is 2 inch, but back is not, so he has to struggle to use"
3.0,This material is somewhat see through. The material is stretchy and form fitting. I bought for a cruise in February 2016. The color matched the picture pretty close. I am 5'5&#34; 140 pounds and ordered a medium should have ordered a large.
3.0,Turn black to soon.
3.0,"Pretty dress, color was lighter than pictured, overall not a good cut for me."
3.0,"Nice bag but isnt as structured as I would like, actually sort of floppy."
3.0,"Apples were a bit bigger than expected, but still pretty."
3.0,"Nice, cheap, but nice."
3.0,Color fades after 2 weeks.
3.0,"Really great bag, but bigger than I thought. Came with rose bud stuff, not exactly sure what it is for but smells nice"
3.0,Does ok hard to find those perfect slippers
3.0,The material is thin and comfortable but the stitching was pretty bad in places. Pretty pattern and color was good
3.0,"These are cute and the colors are fun, but they're much smaller than I expected. The quality is good and such, but the almost look like colored rubber bands you would use in your hair as opposed to a wedding ring replacement. It does serve the purpose for gym visits and such, by I prefer the walk sized ones better."
3.0,"These dresses get a 3 star average from me and here’s why: I ordered in beige and hunter green = 5 stars great fit, fabric and length. Flattering neckline for a large chest, good length for a shorter woman, nice draping to hide bulges, but still hugs curves. I ordered in black = 1 star wtf different fabric, cut and size. Why purport it to be the same dress when it is clearly different? I waited nearly a month for it to be shipped from China and I’ll bet I have to pay for return shipping. This is dishonest marketing. 2 outta 3 ain’t bad. Good luck to you making the right choice. I hope you’re in a gambling mood."
3.0,"I am 5‘4“, and 124 pounds. I have a slightly short wasted build. The elastic In the shelf bra was too tight, and the  back of the top was loose and look like there was too much material. It was not pulled taught across my back.  It just fit funky on my body."
3.0,It was a good fit and length<br />nice oversized cardigan<br />but had a weird smell to it and the material feels kinda weird 🥴
3.0,"I liked the quality of the bracelet, however I ordered the bracelet with two bear cubs and received one with three.  It was a bit disappointing but too much of a hassle to send back"
3.0,"Very pretty bra. It could use a little more support, however. Washes well but I always air dry."
3.0,"We all want different things from our clothing, and we all have different concerns, so keep that in mind while reading this review.<br /><br />This dress was not for me. You know how you put something on and it feels like a good friend, the kind of good friend that tells you're a rockstar. I didn't get that feeling from this dress, it was just okay, hence the 3 stars. I was not a fan of the print at all. I was on the fence as to whether or not I would be keeping this item based on just that alone.<br /><br />The fit wasn't bad at all and was what I had been expecting, so I would say that this dress is definitely true to size. The chest are felt a little less accommodating than I thought it would be (I do not have large breasts at all) I knew going in it was risque going in, but I felt very exposed. The flow of the fabric was nice, and the material felt very soft against my skin.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it was just okay.<br /><br />My stats for those considering this dress are: 4'11/ 35-26-35/ 112lbs"
3.0,The jacket is very thin.
3.0,Smaller than expected but nice colors & materials
3.0,Great quality! But...does NOT fit an almost 5 year old face! Waaay too big! And she’s of average height and build.
3.0,I'm son wears 5.5 and his toes were pushing out the front. Looked cute. Will try the next size up
3.0,"Didn’t like the material, wish I would’ve returned it"
3.0,ok but not as good as timberline's
3.0,Their capris fit smaller then the pants!
3.0,"I love the print, but definitely comes across more black in the photo then real life.  The neck is a little small, if you don't like having things close to your neck I don't recommend buying this.  That being said, it's still cute. I'm 5'7 roughly 165 mostly in the belly from giving birth, 40D - think tall and straight body type -I ordered a medium and it fit well, aside from the sleeves stopping short.  I've got long legs, but this was pretty long on me, definitely reads more of a dress than a tunic. I returned it because it was more gray than I expected, and the sleeves hitting too short on the wrist bugged me.  I loved the print and the pockets. It was a heavier fabric than I expected. Hope this helps!"
3.0,Didn’t love the fabric.
3.0,"Broke quickly, but very stylish and worth getting again."
3.0,"Love the look, but mine frayed and ripped after one wear! I only wore it out to dinner and I was so sad to see the fraying tip at the shoulder."
3.0,"When I received the product it had red smeared on the stars, the strings by the zipper were kinda popping out and when I tried it on the sleeves were too short and I even order a size up and it still was kinda short on the torso but overall it's comfy and other than what I said it was a nice product."
3.0,"A little see-through, so definitely need something underneath. I feel like the dress doesn't flow as much as depicted in the image. I'll probably sew up a little of the slits because they're higher than I expected. Beautiful vibrant colors."
3.0,"Is a bit tight so go up one to two size, as I went up one size and still a bit to tight"
3.0,"Was a bit flimsy, but still quite good quality for the price. Bought for my Dad. He decided he wanted a regular samsonite instead of hardshell, so we gave this to my brother instead and got him a samsonite from costco."
3.0,"They are a bit short for my long legs and wish they are a bit heavier, but they will do."
3.0,The bathing suit is very cute and my daughter loved it. Unfortunately it is s little high cut causing it to ride up a lot. It is slightly small in my daughter who is very thin for her age.
3.0,Not long enough I returned it
3.0,"So sad this bracelet fell off while I was out because it is so cute! The way the bracelet clasps makes it come undone very with a slight tug. However, this is so cute that I am considering buying it again and finding a way to make it clasp more securely."
3.0,"It's a very pretty piece of jewelry, and it's fascinating to play with. However, it did not come with the ring shown in the pictures, nor did it come with a beautiful gift bag (as mentioned in the description)."
3.0,This is supposed to be a man’s watch?  When u put it on it feels like a kids watch. If you have a small wrist and small arm you should buy but if not then I don’t suggest you buy. That’s the only reason I had it 3 stars. Other than the size I do like it.
3.0,I really wanted to like this because I loved the scarf tie back and the straw look of the visor part. Those details made is really pretty. Ultimately I decided to return this because I had to wear it so high up on my forehead just to be able to see that it looked a little ridiculous.
3.0,Good design but a little too thin.
3.0,"It didn't really look that good, more for your grandpa if he didn't give a damn how his wallet looked."
3.0,"was my size but fit too small, tight. Excellent feel to material just didn't fit."
3.0,Very thin fabric but huge quantity of socks and there cute. Nice to have enough socks for once
3.0,A Good value for the price. They do have their flaws tho. The sleeves are too short and fray easy.
3.0,Quality is below average and the chest pocket is fake. It was the whole reason I bought it
3.0,Cute for a nightgown. Not dress material.
3.0,soooo like hey y’all how are u also basically like it’s good and it looks js like the pictures but the magnet is notttt that strong and it doesn’t fit small wrists.
3.0,"This set is of fair to good quality. The tie and pocket square are still in good shape after multiple wears. The cufflinks came with pulls to the fabric inserts, luckily I had others I could wear instead. Buy if you're looking for a good tie and pocket square and don't care about the cufflinks."
3.0,This does not fit an iphone 7 plus comfortably. I thought the sides would expand more than it actually did.
3.0,For the price its ok<br />dont expect this to look good or last too much
3.0,Found this a little heavy to comfortably carry in my purse
3.0,"It's just ok to me.  I wore it, but didn't love it.  The white material is see through so it takes away from the look of it.  I like the concept but like I said it was just ok."
3.0,Too short.  Doesn't come down far enough to your pants.
3.0,Good thing u like my pants a little  long and the pants are stretchy or I would have to return then. When I pulled them out of the package I thought can even a size 0 fit into these. Lucky they fit. They need to make a xlarge. And remember people have curvy hips and thighs.
3.0,I have mixed feelings about this mask.  I found it cumbersome to put the filter in it and it never really fit really well.I bought this for an 8 year old.  It fit her but not a good closed fit.<br />She loved the cactus print...
3.0,"The 'dark' vintage is not at all as dark as what it is pictured, which is strange since the winter colors are about exactly as pictured. So I thought I was going to be getting a bunch of colors that were darker than the winter ones, but the 'dark' vintage really just consists of a brown, and then lighter versions of the winter red and blue with the same light gray as in winter. The green and purple are also a lot lighter than pictured. So now I have a bunch of light colored underwear that I don't really care for."
3.0,"Quality:  These aren't the quality of &#34;Lily and Laura&#34; brand bracelets. They're not as tightly crocheted, and only use round seed-beads (rather than a mix of round and tubular, which give &#34;Lily and Laura&#34; their distinctive look). But they're not poor quality, and worth it for the reasonable price I paid.<br /><br />Style: I ordered a dozen of these bracelets in a random mix, and was moderately pleased. While the colors (surprisingly) went together in about three groups, only 4 bracelets suited me... but, 4 of 12 - not bad, for the price I paid.  Luckily, my sister also is obsessed with these bracelets, and another 4 of them suit her so I will share - so ended up with 8 in total out of 12 that one of us will wear.<br /><br />Price: I paid about 85% less than 12 &#34;Lily and Laura&#34; bracelets cost at full price, so it was a great deal. But the money from Lily and Laura bracelets supports fair trade artisans, and these don't... so I do feel a bit guilty buying these instead.<br /><br />Overall: It's possibly worth it if you keep your expectation low - you may be pleasantly surprised, as I was."
3.0,"Great color and image of the pokéball, but it was not made clear in the product summary that these would look like faux gauges when worn."
3.0,"a little flimsy, but pretty.  It actually looks like there are gems in the flower, but there are not."
3.0,not worth $10.  loops on ends keeps slipping off of glasses. really a pain
3.0,"A very cute swimsuit,  the top was a little small across the bust, but alittle big around the back, bottoms fit nicely"
3.0,very fragile.  My son dropped it on the floor and shattered the crystal.  We ordered another one to replace it and the crystal just popped off the watch.  We glued it back on the second time.
3.0,"The style and sizing seemed right, but i got the gray and it is absolutely not a heathered look, it is solid gray. it is also kind of baggy bunchy in the front. overall it's still cute but not worth it to keep for the price and misleading color."
3.0,Cute jeans but the legs are huge. They’re beyond boot cut
3.0,"I don’t think this shirt fits the images/description as shown.<br /><br />The pics look like a vintage touch in the seems, there is no such color difference. This was the part of the shirt I liked best.<br /><br />The shirt is a bit thicker than expected, feels more like a light sweater. Though I do like the material and the thickness, I thought I would add that in case someone is looking for the lightweight material of a shirt.<br /><br />The shirt fits me a little loose, which I do like.<br /><br />I am going to keep the shirt, but it doesn’t match the pics! I attached pics of the seems so you could see the color. I bought the charcoal in xxl"
3.0,The dresses is cute both the material  is bad
3.0,"Good quality, good fit, good look."
3.0,"I really do like the bag, however, I was expecting gray to be its primary color and it is more of a taupe color. In addition, even though it was described as a &#34;mini&#34; handbag and its dimensions were provided, its very small size was a disappointment."
3.0,"I looked up different ways to wear a scarf and this worked well. Simple, thin, fashion scarf that can be worn with many different tops."
3.0,"I love the font, but the size of the pendant is too large.  Also, it's too shiny for me.  Would like it better if there was no circle around the 'ohm'."
3.0,"Not bad, but not my favorite top.  The fit is fine, but does not have an elegant look or feel.  But it washes well in cold water and does not shrink."
3.0,This is a decent hat for kids. The construction is good but the one major thing I didn’t like is the hulk figure is just an iron on decal.
3.0,"item was not as pictured.  The delivered item was sorta half transparent, half opaque."
3.0,"Flimsy material, very transparent. Fit was weird - unsure if it was just too big or if it was just the make of the dress. Ended up returning it."
3.0,"The good:<br />Comfy and offer good compression.<br />The less than good:<br />Expensive for lasting only about 8-10 months.  The heals wear through.  I also pull these up more often than other brands.<br /><br />Look they’re good socks, but know that they ain’t gonna last.  You can buy cheaper but they will last an even shorter time.  It might be the bamboo material these are all made from too?"
3.0,"Selected this dress for my bridesmaids.  Read one review that said that the girl was 5'9'' and it fit perfectly.  My sister is 5'7 1/2'' and it doesn't even reach the floor when she's barefoot.  The inner layer is several inches shorter than the outer layer, so it really looks short, especially if she wears any shoes. It's also a little baggy around the waist in both my sisters, but while that can be altered, we cannot add to the length.  It's a nice dress, and I still like the style and color.  It's just not as flattering of a fit as we had hoped."
3.0,this was much to bluky so returned it and they only refunded me $10 when i bought it for $15
3.0,wrinkles Very easily
3.0,"Very sparkly they look like a plastic accessory, not worth the buy. And are they very light to be wearn"
3.0,they were cute but the backing on one of the earrings wouldn't stay on.
3.0,I like it keeps mask off nose and mouth.i wrk in chicken plant so it's easier to talk to new hires.
3.0,It broke the first day I put it on
3.0,"They were good socks to start off with, after a few weeks though they lose their ability to stay up and slide down your leg."
3.0,Too big for the recipients head. Not made very well.
3.0,The sleeves are super tight from the shoulder to the elbow and then they get loose... odd
3.0,This suit is really cute and the material is high quality.  The front is lined.  I need to return it because I am not comfortable about how the front fit my chest.  I felt like I had a huge space in between my breasts.  I wear a 34A/B.  It's a lot lower than I expected.  Might look better if you have more up top. The back ruffle does not cover your back side if that's what you're looking for.
3.0,button fell off even before I was able wear it
3.0,"The insert fits properly, however the tab that holds the insert in the wallet is too small and not like the original part.  This tab does not hold up very long.  would recommend you to buy two or three at a time so you can change it as needed if you expect to keep your cards in your wallet safely."
3.0,"Ok, but it is not as good a quality (flimsy sole) as one I have had for several years."
3.0,THere's a lining that gets exposed if you have a pooch and slouch.  I was pulling the polka-dotted part down a lot.  Also it exposes a lot of boob.
3.0,"Loved it, but the dog charm fell off the first day.  Not truly meant for dogs"
3.0,"It is ok, but not oh wow. Too bad!"
3.0,It's peeling off and its OK for storage but &#34;leather&#34; is peeling off.
3.0,"This is not the first toe ring I have purchased from Bling Jewelry.  I use these for mid knuckle rings. Love my first two, but this one is a little two flimsy. I don't expect it will hold up very long, and don't wear it very often for that reason. Which is too bad because I love the trinity knot symbol"
3.0,"This watch band looks nice and does a great job holding in the extra band material in the band loops. My only complaint is the thickness of the band. It is 3mm thick which doesn't sound like much but if you have small wrists to where the band ends up being doubled under your wrist, it ends up being a lot (about 10 mm including the little bit of slack in between where the band overlaps). If you have big wrists, I'm sure this will work great for you. For a frame of reference, my wrist is 14.5 cm."
3.0,"It's super warm and helped with the negative temperatures,  sometimes too warm"
3.0,"I loved this dress when i first received it, but I have subsequently bought other Soojun caftan-type dresses, and this one just doesn't hold a candle to the other as far as feel and quality. This dress is much more gauze-y than it appears and I managed to tear the fabric the second time I wore it; Not on a seam, but the actual fabric is thin enough that along the side seam where it is gathered to give the high-low effect, it simply pulled apart. I have washed this garment by hand three times and line dried it...It already looks ratty. Still comfortable, but just ratty. It is much better suited as some sort of cover-up than a 'dress'. I would not but this again, especially for what they charged for it. I am surprised that the star rating (though only 6 reviews at the time) was as high as it was, nearly 5 stars..."
3.0,The top is cute but fits very tight at wrists and waist. Rides up a bit and just a cheap fabric. Cute enough but not my favorite. Wouldn’t say it’s worth the money in my opinion.
3.0,Very cute but way too large.
3.0,"Okay so they're really cute and I originally gave them 5 stars, but for the number of times I've worn them, they are really a terrible value. They are totally worn thru in the heels and will soon be unwearable and they're less than 6 months old so I've worn them probably less than 20 times. Yikes!"
3.0,Can probably do the job did not try it again but it seem to be not tight enought to hold the cam on my head while doing sport
3.0,Super cute but super small. I gave them to my little cousin because I think they're for a child or very small headed adult. They're super sturdy and look really nice but super small which was disappointing
3.0,"I bought these for my husband and he's usually a size 10. Size 10 was too small, I exchanged for size 11 and they were still too small so I exchanged for size 12 and they were too big. They look really nice though. Too bad the sizes aren't realistic."
3.0,"The jury's still out on these boots. First the upside, the leather is very nice both inside and out. The outside of the boot is soft allowing enough &#34;give&#34; at the ankle where it's needed for an ankle boot, while still holding its shape. The inside is luxurious glove leather, really nice detail. The sole is well constructed and seems to be able to last a long time. All in all, a very well made shoe. Now the downside, sizing. So many other reviews suggested ordering a full size down, I do not. I purchased 7.5 and the length was perfect. For me the sizing problem is all about the width. I have wide feet and normally wear a size 8. With some makes I can get by with a 8M, other makes I need 8W. These boots are very narrow and the toe-box is somewhat long. Even using a boot stretcher, I have been unable to widen the toe-box so far. I've had the boots for 3 weeks now and have tried stretching them 4 times at 8 hour intervals. The boots are still too narrow. Going up a half size or more would make for a much longer shoe and not a better fitting one. I am going to continue to try and stretch them and wear them to break them in because they are really nice boots and I really want them to work out. We'll see. My suggestions to The Thursday Boot Company, get your sizing issues together, offer wide sizes and continue to use the same quality materials used currently. There is potential for a top-notch shoe here, a shoe that will last decades... if only they fit."
3.0,Love the socks but one is falling apart a few of the threads seam like they will not continue to come undone but plenty will it’s a shame a know the socks are not supposed to match but I am really hoping the quality of the next pair I get will. Well not if they are both coming undone but I have got. Few pairs and these are the only ones that gave done this they might have a couple threads that you can just cut off and not worry about but some of these are truly unraveling
3.0,We purchased my sons size but they fit tight. Hopefully with wearing they will stretch.
3.0,The picture is deceiving...I wish there were more circles and less chain.
3.0,"Hinge broke off after first assembly. Bought another style, will see how will that work."
3.0,Some are the socks stretched out.
3.0,Good wallet but not for what I needed I wanted one to fit in my front pocket and this was way too bulky
3.0,Not as large as I would of liked. Still a nice bag that I will use.
3.0,"At first, I loved this backpack especially for travel because of all of the pockets. However the straps soon became uncomfortable because they are strangely narrow-set."
3.0,"These really compress!  I don't have big calves or legs, the bottom of the sock was very comfortable, but boy, trying to get them off to the help of my husband!  I would image though for travel you really need the compression.  Won't buy them again, but if you have smalll legs, it might work, but for men, I wouldn't think so."
3.0,material excellent.
3.0,The color “camel” is more of a peach color. I’m not in love with the color. Was hoping for more of a  brown/tan.
3.0,I love the dusters. they are lightweight and perfect for our Florida climate but unless I lose a lot of weight in hips and tummy were way too small. I am debating trying to lose enough to fit in to them or just ordering 5X
3.0,I received what i wanted. Liked them
3.0,"el short es cortito, si hubiera sido un poquito mas largo, habria sumado mas estrellas, el material esta bien"
3.0,"One of the bands is a half inch shorter than the rest of them, it’s the only one that fits me out of the pack though so I guess I’m glad I got one extra short one. Fine product but not perfect for me, i got the smalls with a 5.5” wrist and the black fits perfectly snug while the rest allow the watch to twist around my wrist in either direction and hit the bony part of my wrist which is exactly what I got these to try to prevent"
3.0,I suggest sizing up
3.0,I get compliments on this all the time because it looks like my real ring. The only issue is that the silver coating is coming off. I’ve only worn it for about 2 weeks so I don’t think it will last very long.
3.0,Kid loved it at first. Not a &#34;wear all the time&#34; piece but fun once in a while.
3.0,These are very small as in for probably children 4-7 years old. The shape is nice and good fabric.
3.0,Very pretty but not high quality.
3.0,Well how do I start ?! This is A++ for being a flexible shoe with steel toe. It’s a 0 for being bullet proof ! My husband and his buddies shot the show while on his foot and YES HE SHOT HIS FOOT !! NOT BULLET PROOF !!!!! and not made out of Kevlar like the description says !!! The bullet did go straight threw his foot so thankfully not major damage was done but lesson learned from this
3.0,It didn't quite fit like I hoped.
3.0,The band is comfy and it was so affordable BUT it loosens up so my watch is always locking up. Same thing happens to my sister with her band
3.0,I loved the shirt and the material felt great. The shirt was just made small. Wished you had bigger sizes.
3.0,Comfortable mask.  Not too thick so can breath more easily.
3.0,Lovely Skirt.  Runs SMALL.
3.0,Vintage style is awesome. Would not mind if it were a tad smaller diameter. As it turns out the watch rotates around my wrist. I realize I have smaller wrists but just wish the piece fit a bit better.
3.0,"I ordered these ties for the groomsman in my wedding. I ordered 3 ties the first time and they were prefect. The are long, have a satin looking finish and were the perfect ivory color! Plans ended up changing and we needed 2 more ties so I reordered 2 more. These ties were still long and had a great finish but they are a full shade or two darker! The ties are great but if you order them you better order them all at once or you could get different colors! :("
3.0,"I am glad there is a 30 day return policy...<br />This is an innovative design, but made with inferior materials - especially the zippers.  This item is a &#34;lookalike&#34; of other, superior quality items I have seen offered.  Zippers are difficult to operate, and fabric is very thin.  The integrated pockets are too small for anything, except tiny objects.  They ship it stuffed in its built-in pouch, and when it is extracted, the fabric is totally wrinkled.  I seriously doubt it is waterproof because fabric is compromised due to all the wrinkles from being stuffed into the pouch.  I  do not plan to risk testing their claim  Perhaps ok for a children's toy... not for grown-ups.  Not worth more than five dollars."
3.0,The print and touch of the material is nice. But suggested size is small than what should have been. Also it is a translucent
3.0,"These fit in length and through the leg but at the waist and hip, not so much. The velcro closure pops open if I squat,  sit, bend. Move, basically.<br />I'm 5'5&#34;, 145 lbs and wear mediums in most things. I have 40&#34; hips wear a 28 or 29 in pants.<br /><br /> These just don't fit like women's clothing. They fit like juniors. I'm pretty sure a large would be too big in leg and length. 3 stars because I haven't actually worn them in the snow, although I'm sure they are perfectly adequate."
3.0,"A very nice bag, color is WAY WAY OFF!<br />It is orange-not pink/rose not even close!<br />But it is excellent quality-I doubt I would order from that company again, it was a long long time to wait for a bag the wrong color, but I will keep it, just not as pleased as I had hoped !"
3.0,Very gorgeous but I order a size up and it was too small.
3.0,"They smelled like terrible fake plastic when I received them in. I loved the way they looked, I just could not get over the manufacturing smell."
3.0,"Nice dreasy, casual dress.  Not pleated as shown in the picture."
3.0,Too light weight. Not warm enough. Not what I expected from photo...
3.0,Worked great until I washed it.
3.0,"On the computer the earrings looked MUCH larger.  When I got them home and saw that they were much smaller, I didn't think they should have cost so much.  I had originally purchased them as a holiday gift.  I decided to keep them as they were a lot smaller than I thought.  Actually, I have them on today.  Laurie Ritter"
3.0,"Too large for a 8-1/2 boot. Returning for smaller size,  5-7"
3.0,"This necklace is cute, but it is of low quality (you get what you pay for). It's good for a fun outfit, but it is not for special occasions."
3.0,I ordered blue but received black. I like them enough not to send back. But I did want the blue......
3.0,Kinda cheep
3.0,"They look fine ... However, they DO NOT FIT OVER my glasses.  I have basic black rim prescription glasses.  They are NOT extremely large, they fit an average woman's face.  I caution"
3.0,I bought this in January and the clasp already broke off.  I was hoping it would last longer.  I loved the product and the color pink.
3.0,"Ok, these are TINY!!  In fact, i was shocked when i unpacked them.  It's my own fault for not doing the measurements.  They are so small that i can hardly see the rainbow colors, all i see is purple!  I wish these exact pair was at least 3 times as big.  Now i'm noticing that one of these earrings doesn't close all the way, it doesn't &#34;click&#34; like the other one does.  No matter how hard i press it.  Won't be wearing again."
3.0,It does not come up high enough on the side if your cup runneth over. It is pretty but I need a little side support.
3.0,These were very narrow .
3.0,"you get what you pay for. My daughter loves it, but the black coating started coming off on her chest in flakes by day 2."
3.0,I like it but it is a bit heavy and bulky. Material is not what I expected. It’s shiny and bigger than I thought it’d be. Bought it for my mom. She drives a Prius and the key is a lot of sliding room. The clip on the end is heavy and bulky as well.<br />So if you are looking for it to not be in a small purse it will work.
3.0,"I like the bag. It appears to be authentic; however, the plastic I'd card and dust bag were not included as advertised, so I wonder..."
3.0,They are way too big for my head.  I can't keep them on.
3.0,"I ordered the Ganyu cosplay, the sizing is decent my only issue with sizing is the chest area, it’s a little small. The detailing on the fabric is nice BUT there are seems everywhere  and I put on of the horns off and the clips for one broke off after putting them on once."
3.0,Love the color and it's strong material but very small not good for much. Bought for my older son but it doesn't hold much of anything. Great for my 3 year old to hold snacks and a couple small juice boxes.
3.0,I have tried many times to cancel this itim because  I was not aware it was 2 T but I am so dissapointef my request was not gtsnfef
3.0,A bit stiff. Hopefully it will loosen up with time. It does not want to wrap around my wrist.
3.0,Not that firm of material.
3.0,They are very comfortable.  They however are Not full support.  I have a large bust and there is no support .  I will wear these around the house.  Not to the gym
3.0,"Cheap version, also cheap price though."
3.0,This polishing cloth is good but it needs a lot of rubbing power to clean a small vial and the inner polishing cloth (the cream color) is very very very dry and expel a lot of dust.  I have to tell the truth about my experience
3.0,"Runs big,"
3.0,This watch is beautiful I'm giving it a 3 only because it had a scratch on the face.
3.0,Arrived with a oily stain on front
3.0,This product was too big for me. I tried to return it but the seller convinced me to keep it and I’ll get part of the money back. I ended up giving it to someone but it was a cute pants otherwise
3.0,Was a nice robe but the fit was on the small side.
3.0,I am not sure how these are different from regular plastic backs. I wish you had a description with the product.i still don't know if it works
3.0,"Earrings were broken, had to repair"
3.0,The brand name  takes away from the look.<br />soles are ok for outside but they look like slippers.
3.0,"When I recieved this bracelet in the mail I wasn't expecting it to be a 'slinky-type' braacelet...in the picture it looks like the 3 rows are connected, either tied somehow or whatever. That's not the case. Even though I wasn't expecting that I still love this bracelet. A couple down-sides: 1) the beads are plastic 2) the eyes are painted on and some of them aren't aligned well. So in a way I kind of believe it was priced a little too high for it's quality. Still a good bracelet, and I think it's pretty durable and will stay with me for awhile."
3.0,"I like the side panel that protects from sun very well, however, It hurt my head when wearing it for a long time. And the price went up from the first time I saved in my cart."
3.0,Great for fun play. However the medium is very small.
3.0,"The dress came earlier than expected, so props to the seller for fast shipping. Otherwise, the dress itself was a disappointment. It doesn’t look nearly as nice as the picture and is way too long and large in some areas and too small in others. I ordered size 18. Honestly this would only fit a very tall very broad woman. I would have to hem it and lift the shoulders as well to make it fit. I am 5’5, a true size 18. Returning based on fit and quality."
3.0,"If your hand measures 7 1/2&#34;-7 3/4&#34; around the widest part of your palm, then these will be too tight for you.  (I have larger hands so will give them to a friend.) Also, they do not come down as long on the wrist as shown in the picture. Quality of material for the low price is as expected, lace is a pretty pattern, some small end threads to trim off and seam a little off on the thumb, but this is just a bit of costume wear and not for any fancy event. Pretty if you don't sweat the details and want a fun accessory."
3.0,Got them for Halloween costume for my boyfriend he said they were uncomfortable and did not stay in place but for the price can't complain lol
3.0,"These are just OK.  Fit mostly as expected though they're not as form fitting as I expected.  I bought the dark grey version and the black waistband really doesn't look anything like the picture, nor do the back pockets look at all like the picture.  The pair that arrived has two faux maybe 4&#34; long &#34;pockets&#34; that are straight across, not angled as depicted.  The material is cheap, and very thin.  Think thick t-shirt material.  Like I said though, all-in-all, they're OK.  I use them at the gym and they're nice for that purpose and have a good enough range of motion that I can do squats and deadlifts without worrying about blowing the butt seam out.  They've held up fine to ~5 washes now with no shrinking.  I have gotten a few compliments on them."
3.0,"The photo gives the impression that this is cut to hang loosely at the waist, but I found it to be close-fitting (even on my ""athletic-build"" torso with very little gut-bulge). The material and quality seemed nice enough, but I returned it for Fit reasons."
3.0,A little snug up your size.
3.0,"This shirt/dress looks like it would be loose, but I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 123 lbs. and it's not big enough in the chest on me. I ordered a medium at a slight discount and I cannot button it across my breasts and ribs. I'm a 34C and my boobies hang out like the model in the advertised photo.<br /><br />The long arm sleeves are too narrow and tight as well. The length is short in the front and long in the back which is cute; however, I wanted to wear this for a dress but it's too short in the front for a dress. Since I cannot button it past my naval, I will have to wear it open as a cover-up or thin jacket over my clothes. Manufacturer must have been low on material when they made this garment for my order.<br /><br />Material is soft and the stitching is tight, straight, and neat. Dress is thin and light but not see through. If I could button it up, I would enjoy wearing this stylish and casual shirt dress. It is pretty.<br /><br />To prevent garment from shrinking, wash in cold water and hang dry. If it becomes any smaller for me, I suppose I could wear it as a bolero.<br /><br />Fast shipping and nicely packaged. Hope my review helps. Any questions, please ask."
3.0,I was disappointed because it ran small. Iy was too tight.
3.0,"I may be the only person still using these Oakley's, but for what it's worth:<br /><br />I've owned a few pairs of these replacement lenses now.  Overall, they are worth the asking price.  They fit snug w/o issue and I have not had a lens pop out.  The lens themselves are nice, but scratch relatively easily.  Additionally, I get about 9 months out of them with daily use before the lens has deteriorated and need to be replaced.<br /> For around $15, they are a good buy, but expect to replace them at a year."
3.0,"I ordered one pair of these sunglasses after carefully looking at several pairs of inexpensive sunglasses online.  The sunglasses that I received look pretty good, but they appear to be slightly different than the photo shown in the listing.  Actually, I received two different pairs of sunglasses (1 free).  Even though they are not exactly what I expected, the price was right, I did get two pair of sunglasses for the price of one, and they are good enough.  So I probably will keep them rather than go through the inconvenience of returning them."
3.0,I'm sorry to say but the fabric is very scratchy and having two layers under the actually watch is very bulky and uncomfortable.
3.0,This eye glass case works for a my son's needs especially in a backpack. Child's glasses fit inside. Quick shipping.
3.0,"Made in China tag really took away from the cap. But it fits and looks decent. Why can’t you just buy American made, most people would pay an extra $10 for Made in the USA"
3.0,I have ordered these flip flops before. I ordered 3 pair before in size 10 they were too big so this time I ordered 2 pair of size 9 they are a little small so I guess I can't wear these flip flops unless I want them either too big or too small. They are still good flip flops just the sizes run funny.
3.0,Coolest lookin glasses. Frame cracked when i put em on.
3.0,Demora mucho en llegar
3.0,"it was not so shini the paint cover the star ,but i still like it for the right price"
3.0,Bought a size small. My daughter is 5'4 and these are way too short on her. Fits good everyplace else.
3.0,I wanted them larger to replace a pair I love and have had for years- even had them repaired twice but lost one. These are nice and almost identical but little:(
3.0,"Very baggy in the crotch, so definitely not good for running. Great lounge wear.<br /><br />3 stars because one of the eyelets for the drawstring fell off after one use"
3.0,"The case itself was a little bent and didn't shut completely. Also it was worn out on the pattern. It still works, but it's not in perfect condition. I think it was used before."
3.0,Not totally convinced this is spf 50 but just to be safe use sunscreen before putting it on your little one.
3.0,"Super cute, seriously adorable design, and SO cuddly-soft...but...they are really small! These definitely can not be considered a standard women's size (sock size 9-11). They're more like a little girl's medium/large. Even with petite feet, I don't think these would work for me. I bought these as a gift for my 11 y/o niece. She loves owls & really liked these, but her feet are at least as big as mine...so, I guess maybe she can put them on the feet of one of her stuffed animals. Bottom line: cute for a kid, but they're not likely to fit most adults. Hope this helps!!"
3.0,"I liked the fit and feel of this vest, but the colors are NOT as shown in the picture.  Instead of the grey lining, it is a deep purple/red color."
3.0,To big!
3.0,"It is a little thin, but for the price, it will work okay."
3.0,Shirt came without a hem.  Was a little disappointed
3.0,The sizes are not really exact. I usually by small for tops and medium for bottom. I ordered size &#34;M&#34; and it was too small. I exchanged it for size &#34;L&#34; and it was a little big. I keep it for use at home only.
3.0,"Nice, but tarnished quickly."
3.0,"I was expecting these to be a good bit larger than they are--they are about maybe 1 inch for the hanging part and add not quite a half inch for the earring part.  They are cute, look mostly well made, but I wanted them to be a tad larger.  I purchased 2 pairs--my daughter will love them, I'm returning my pair."
3.0,"Love the colors. It isn’t a soft material. I’m a medium and ordered a large, it it is tight medium, it’s good that it stretches."
3.0,"I love an oversized maxi dress, I’m 5’2 and I ordered an XL. Only thing is this dress is heavily advertised as a V NECK dress and when I got it it’s a regular scoop/ round neck style. Slightly disappointing but I still like e dress and it has pockets!"
3.0,"Not at all like all of the hype surrounding this mask.  It's okay, but not great"
3.0,The dress is very cute but quality of the seams was very poor on mine. Crooked and loose in areas.
3.0,It may be that we needed to get a bigger size but they were far too tight close to the knee. Be sure to carefully measure your leg and get product measurements!
3.0,"I like the cut and style and fit, but the fabric is lint Velcro. They’d be great if the fabric was different. I love the 3 pockets and everything else but I have to return them because I’m not going to constantly lint brush myself while I work out."
3.0,I've got a pinhead and hoped this would fit okay but it is too big :( I threw it in the dryer after washing and unfortunately it did not shrink enough. Still cute pattern and nice material though!
3.0,I went up a size and its still quite fitted. I'm a very hippie girl (36/26/41) so yea....
3.0,Mine broke after 2nd wearing. The wire pulled out. I jammed it back in and it works intermittently. It’s not as bright as I hoped either. I like the way it clasps with a magnet.
3.0,The sun visor looks great but just a little to tight for my head.  If I wear it for to long it gives me a headache which means I have a hat I can not wear. :( but no fault to Amazon it is probably best to buy clothing at a retail store where you can try it on before you buy.
3.0,Does the job. Nothing special
3.0,Doesn't really keep feet warm like we thought.
3.0,Almost a whole size too big. I wear a 12 and with this shoe I have to wear two pair of socks to fit in a 12
3.0,"The pockets hit at a strange spot. Almost at my ribs and not my hips, making it look like my hips were up near my chest. Not a good look. Also, very heavy material, not as expected."
3.0,"Im sure this product is as intended, maybe its for smaller feet than mine.  What I can say is that the heel portion is constantly slipping off in an irritating fashion.  Timberland makes these socks, and though they cost more, they stay on your feet, thats for sure."
3.0,I loved this jacket until a hole formed in the pocket after only having it for two days. Had it sewn and another hole in the same pocket... Aside from that it was a great buy
3.0,"Because the material stretches it is OK, but tighter than I would like.  Sizes run SMALL."
3.0,"The slippers are well-made, but the style just wasn't what I expected.  When I put them on, it looked like I was wearing 2 Left or 2 Right slippers...they just were &#34;off&#34;.  I've returned them and ordered the Elsbeth gray slipper.  Looking forward to receiving, as the quality is very nice."
3.0,The ring has a very nice design and comes solved.  But don’t drop these rings or you’ll be out of luck trying to find the solution. These rings do not come with full detailed instructions on how to solve them. They also run small so it would be wise to order at least one and a half size bigger.
3.0,"The frame is not wooden, and the leather is artificial. Coating goes off easy and the strap colouring my wrist. Norm for its price. Looks good anyway!"
3.0,the black isn’t as dark as it shows in the picture
3.0,"Pretty piece, relatively cheap but expensive looking. Just need to wear with the right neckline."
3.0,The pants are nice. A bit heavier material than I was expecting since I plan on using Groupon. Them for beachwear but it’s not too heavy to change my plans for the usage (more of a Cotten weight rather than linen). Also they are miles too long for me but that’s an easy fix for me at least since I have become accustomed to shortening virtually every pair of pants I own.
3.0,"Pros: cute style, broad color selection, easily holds 11 cards, 1 passport, 1 pencil, American & Canadian bills, and coins<br /><br />Cons: cheap feeling material, defective zipper upon arrival"
3.0,My finger was too big.
3.0,I was looking forward to this product since my Rolf/Feldenkris therapist highly recommends them as providing the correct walking alignment.<br />However I was sent a medium rather than the 9 I requested and my foot slips in them.  I will keep them but am not terribly happy with them.
3.0,"These earrings are super cute.  They are literally glued together from the glue holding on the crystals.  I had to physically separate them slowly so that they wouldn't be ruined.  The glue thay holds the crystals on feel soft and pliable, not sturdy or strong."
3.0,I had to return it. It was way too large. I would try a smaller size.
3.0,"I gave 3 stars because it was real Filtson brand, I returned the order because I ordered 20 pics only received 10, I opened one to see maybe there two in one pack. Unfortunately not. There are real Filtson brands good material, I use to order same brands through different website. So sad had to return it, Filtson is very popular brand in asian country, Filtson always has good products ."
3.0,Its a great design but the shirt quality is not that good.
3.0,Thin and clingy. The words seemed oddly placed. I wore something else.
3.0,"I bought these right after purchasing a similar pair from old navy. When comparing the two, these are less soft, less stretchy, and have a less comfortable waistband: the very top seam doesn’t stretch the way they should. I do love the length and the side pocket that is large enough for a phone."
3.0,Runs a bit small. Looks cute on.
3.0,"Live the belt, but three color wad misleading. I was expecting a metallic shiny color, but the belt I got was pretty plain gray."
3.0,"It should have been obvious to me from the photo, as generic as it is, but these glasses are REALLY red. Not tinted. Cyclops could use these."
3.0,I bought two sizes up and it fits alright. However the lace comes up close to the neck.
3.0,"They're a novalty, don't expect them to last. Screws started coming out 3 weeks after I got them and the lens scratch and smudge easily. But they look great at the beach in a thong!"
3.0,I'm 5'9 and this is closer to a midi than a maxi on me.
3.0,I gave 3 stars due to poor packaging and my charm being dented. As far as the charm itself it's very well made and the paint hasn't chipped so far. Seller should change packaging but I do recommend.
3.0,"The color of the flowers were more purple then fushia so the leggings i ordered that matched the picture ,do not match now.<br />I will say the fit of the leggings are very nice as i ordered them before from another seller."
3.0,"It fit the calf, however if you have fat ankles, it won't zip up."
3.0,Chain is too thin.
3.0,It doesn’t really look nor feel like a turban.
3.0,"The watch is not a tourbillon piece, the opening is simply whats called by collectors as an escapement. I liked the Avenue of the America's Tonneau shape of the watch and the different colored hour markers so I kept it. It's reasonably priced and the only exception I'd make is that the band wasn't long enough so I had to replace it. I ran the watch for a week and it kept good time so I added it to my collection. Not bad for a Chinese manufactured timepiece!"
3.0,"They are great for jewelry making however it is good to note that there is not a lot of doubles in the package. So not the best if you are trying to get matching charms for earrings, but great for necklaces or bracelets."
3.0,It’s a nice T-shirt fits great I’m a little disappointed because it didn’t come with the stickers that it said it came with I had a plan to use those as part of the gift so now I have to come up with something else shipping took FOREVER
3.0,"Perfect size, love all of the pockets but it looks cheap.  Wished the material was different... Cotton, high grade pleather would be nice."
3.0,"This top is SO cute (especially the back!!) and I really wanted it to work, but beware if you are busty. I returned it because the arm holes cut in too much and I had some boob popping out. This top would work great for smaller chests!! Going up a size would not fix the situation. I'm a C/D and it's really just about the cut of the suit. The top is meant for smaller chests. Not all cupshe tops like this have that problem though, I bought the pineapple halter and it was perfect! I left a review too! [[ASIN:B01G5A5WR4 Cupshe Fashion Women's Pineapple Printing Halter Padding Bikini Set (L)]]"
3.0,"This jacket looked very good, really nice, when it arrived, but it's way too small. I had to send to back. Too bad, it's really cool."
3.0,Cute little bags.  Bigger than expected.
3.0,"Feel cheaply made and not very comfortable when wearing for awhile. Very airy though, lightweight and breezy"
3.0,"Ordered the one woth this pattern and a solid black... the solid black is the only one usable as when I attempts to switch between my different straps the patterned ones quick release rods fall out, which makes it impossible to quickly change to my attire."
3.0,"I had written a review with 5 stars right after I received the wallet in April, 2016.  I was using the strap as a wristlet, which I loved.  However, the strap only lasted 7 months before the stitching pulled out of the wallet. Very disappointed. The thin strap couldn't handle the weight of the phone. (Samsung 5 w/protective cover) I am going to see if our local shoe repair can somehow reattach the strap."
3.0,It's just ok.  Not exactly like the pic - and has &#34;puckering&#34; where the crochet is attached to material.
3.0,La tela es buena pero la costura se dañó en la primera puesta
3.0,Cool that I can replace my hat band.
3.0,"This cover up runs small.  I also thought it said cotton, not syntehticy6,  but it is cute"
3.0,They are light and almost cozy enough. My son doesn't really like them but he says the length is perfect.
3.0,"Extremely well made but for $16.95 they certainly should be.  I found them to be small and they showed around the neckline when attached to the bra.  I ordered some velcro and will sew that on instead.  Perfect for a size 2,4,6 or maybe an  8"
3.0,"Ordered the blue sky one... but received a  red and black instead.  From the comments, it seems as though everyone who ordered got a red one instead of the one they wanted. It seems to be of good quality,  just the wrong color."
3.0,Smaller than I expected. Straps sit on my shoulders funny.
3.0,"These bags keep the food cold on a hot day, I have not tested them for more than a hour so far. They hold a lot, they look nice, but I'm already having an issue with one zipper at the corner, and I don't think they will last long."
3.0,"fit large in the waist but small in the ankles. They looked great when standing, but don't you dare sit XD I loved these pants but I have big thighs and the pants would rip more when I sat down. Eventually I just ended up making them into shorts."
3.0,Item wasn't as loose as expected; too tight...had to return.
3.0,They look good and have descent frames but not good for real eye protection
3.0,"I wore this dress to an ugly Christmas sweater party and THANK GOD it was an UGLY Christmas sweater party because this product is made out of the cheapest, , thinnest, heaviest spandex-like material ever. I wore it with a coat to hide the cheap quality a little bit. It wasn't a total bust. People adored it. The design is definitely sufficiently ugly for the event I needed it for and I loved that about it. But if I had known how truly cheap it would be made, I wouldn't have spent so much on it. I would have maybe spent $8 TOPS.<br />On the bright side, it's so stretchy that you don't really have to worry about it not fitting you no matter what your body type is, JUST WATCH OUT FOR IT BEING TOO SHORT PLEASE (it is already relatively short on someone with a slender physique so it will most definitely be much shorter on a curvier person... so be careful babes!!!).<br />If you're looking for a cheap, ugly dress to wear only once in your entire life, this is the one to buy. I just think it should be a little bit cheaper given the poor quality..."
3.0,"this is cute but not what i expected, super see through so i guess i’ll wear it as a cover up for a bathing suit or something."
3.0,Some bands are different sizes. Easily fixed if you own your own or simply change bands from one set to the other.
3.0,"It's ok....I mean I wouldn't brag about it.  It fits pretty much like everyone said...poofy.  I used it as a cover up, the straps are a little tricky though."
3.0,"The style of this is cute - if you're getting a different color than yellow, it would probably be cute! However the yellow is UUUUGLY. More of a pumpkin orange-ish color, not yellow at all. (Maybe good for halloween or fall?)<br /><br />I also found this to be VERY unflattering on me - I have curves and it sits very high on the waist, so ended up ballooning out in a not-great way for my body type. Better suited for someone skinnier."
3.0,"Wish the top had more of a pad, I need help cause I'm flat chested. Makes me look even flatter. The back strap is not tie so it doesn't feel tight enough. It definitely does not look as good as pic."
3.0,"Too tight on face for comfort. It’s thin, not hot around neck."
3.0,Pretty but when  tightened the gems don't face the same way. The gems also are kind of bulging from the metal and look odd.
3.0,Wouldn't use for everyday use. Great for a one time use. Bought for my daughter's Halloween costume. The sleave ended up ripping.
3.0,"The shirt is super cute, however the sleeves have absolutely no stretch to them, they are quite tight. I do not have large arms, but find it uncomfortable to wear for too long because I cannot move or bend my arms in it very well. Also, it took several months to ship!"
3.0,I have big hands for a woman and these were giant.  I had to return them for a small.  Prompt shipping.
3.0,"Short, wide and somewhat see through."
3.0,"Well, I suppose this would be good for some people but not for me. It's too lightweight and restricts my breathing. Again, ok for some, not me."
3.0,A little disappointing.
3.0,Bountiful blouse...<br />But to small. I'm Miriam sizes..but for mi this blouse is like x small.
3.0,Cute and stylish. Could have been a little better quality.
3.0,The band is just to small. Don’t necessarily like the band fasting style. Otherwise the construction is good
3.0,"Hat is not for an adult head. Like the hat, but too small."
3.0,I was disappointed that the fit isn’t true to its size and that it a dry clean only. Item was returned
3.0,cute but very small.
3.0,"Fabric is a bit of a stiff cotton, will wrinkle very easily.  Print is pretty but cheap-looking up close.  More of a costume than a dress for everyday."
3.0,"I can't secure it on my wrist. It just keeps sliding down. so I have to hold onto it if I wear it out. Maybe if you have fatter wrists, it could work for you"
3.0,"I didn't know what size it was  going to be and I still don't know what size it is. Even after opening. The writing is in a different language and when I tried it on, it is for someone who is very very small and does not need a trimming belt. I have no idea if it works because I don't know anyone small enough to wear this. Maybe my neighbor, but she is big into running and running fitness classes at the gym and doesn't have any fat to trim."
3.0,Bought for a gift. Was huge.
3.0,Good looking boot.  Caused blisters on the heels.
3.0,"Slippers were larger than advertised measurements. Sadly, had to return due to too large.  Slipper quality and color were nice for temporary type of slipper."
3.0,The dress is really pretty and the lace appear pretty but the lace has 0 stretch and the sleeve are for very slim arms bought a size 10 and it was loose everywhere but the arms so I am unable to wear the dress and will be retuning it
3.0,Looks like good quality but were too small
3.0,It looks like it was saved for years
3.0,Loved the color bottom to tight top to large.
3.0,Works ok at times but seems to loose connections at most inopportune moments ..
3.0,The shirt fit ok but the pants were too short but the outfit is beautiful but I would definitely order a larger size in the pants so the length will fit
3.0,gave this away
3.0,"~5'10&#34; 155-160lbs [medium]. The buttons are fake, and the V is a bit low for my liking, but the material is nice and form fitting."
3.0,Cheaply made but you get what you pay for
3.0,"These socks definitely don't meet the ""easy on, easy off"" claim but they are effective compression stockings. The fit is good and the quality is as expected."
3.0,"Love it at first , but then the end piece fell off 😔"
3.0,Fits ok once you get it on. But not worth the serious pain involved with sorting out which strap and fabric snippet goes where. Returned.
3.0,"The shirt was cute. My only complaint is that it’s a girl style shirt. It had the lower collar,  and short girl cut sleeves. I wouldn’t have perfected that for my son. 🙁"
3.0,"The material is weird, clingy."
3.0,These run super small. I'm normally a 3x so I got the largest size well... my mom who wears and xl fits in it perfectly
3.0,Very cute and trendy. True to size. Received many compliments on it. May purchase other colors.
3.0,It is made so cheaply. The white part is see through so I will have to wear something under it and the sleeves are not like the picture.
3.0,Very small. Fit like a child large. My husband is 6ft 185 lbs
3.0,It was a little small for me
3.0,Didn't last long.  Wore a few times and the strings came loose.
3.0,didn't fit like I had hoped
3.0,This robe was for my husband and was about two sizes too small for him.  The material it is made from is also thin and not soft.  It is not a comfortable or correct fit.
3.0,Band size runs small and not much stretch
3.0,Color as depicted in the photos. Its soft and lightweight (but real) leather that stretches. It fit great when I first got it but now I'm two belt holes tighter due to stretch so there's too much extra belt now.
3.0,Made well but looked horrible on me. Returned
3.0,Belt keeps coming apart
3.0,Closure doesn't work well
3.0,It’s hard to adjust the size
3.0,Hats were nice and the fit was good but i had to return because I received 2 queen hats instead of 1 king and 1 queen so we never had the chance to wear them.
3.0,These stretched out around the legs and lost their shape in only one season of swimming. Stick with Speedo.
3.0,Material is pretty cheap.  But cute top & fit well!  It arrived in 2 days!  Good service!
3.0,Came in in a timely manner
3.0,"It is bathing suit material, and the criss-cross feature of the shirt is too small for my head to fit through it. It is exactly like pictured, but it just does not fit right."
3.0,Doesn't slouch like in the picture. A bit too small
3.0,Me gustó mucho pero mejoraría si el ancho de las patas fuera más ancho.
3.0,It was okay. The fit is kind of strange.
3.0,I was told I was getting 25 pieces I only received 24 pieces & some of the charms are very similar.
3.0,So disappointed 😔
3.0,"they're okay.  but the bow slides out often, and they don't stay on as well as others ive gotten."
3.0,"the dress was not bad. but it was not as I expected, it was larger than I thought. the material is not as it should be. Overall OK."
3.0,Feels great and comfy but the color is totally off.
3.0,Definitely cannot use it for long events because it eventually just peels off and falls of 10x faster if you sweat even a little bit. I do like the idea of the pull string. I was able to use it a few times for short term things.
3.0,Not happy with purchase as not genuine!! Very disappointing😞
3.0,"The fit is too big and oversized compared to the photo. Additionally, the inside string only helps if you tie it together and close entire jacket; unable to simply tighten for style."
3.0,"I was measured to wear a size 7 3/4 hat at basic training after my head was shaved, so yeah I've got a big fat head even without hair.  That's size XXL.<br /><br />The mask fits well, but...<br /><br />Even though I've got a massive loaf, the pattern is even larger.  The Xs are far too wide, and if I put them at the same level as my eyes, the mouth on the mask is down below my chin and the nose goes in and out with my breathing, looking like the moustache of a certain specific dictator.<br /><br />If I put the mouth (that is enormous btw) over my mouth, the eyes are up on my forehead and it looks silly.<br /><br />It's also quite hard to see, so I ended up cutting some little holes to see."
3.0,water resistance built in light way its compact small
3.0,I like the style but not sure how long these will last quality wise.
3.0,I do like the necklace but I'm disappointed that it's not the good quality of the one I order before. The chain feels like one you would get out of a quarter machine and the bar with the design is thin it was cheap and that's fine but it would be better for future buyers if the materials were more sturdy even if it costs a bit more.
3.0,Very pretty but very uncomfortable between toes.
3.0,fitment was okay but the material is a little see through. if you wear black undergarments all the boys will see your goodies
3.0,Los de sol es pequeña la caja
3.0,"It's small for a 3X. I normally wear an XXL but I ordered this just to be safe.<br />I have wider shoulders so it was a bit difficult to get on.<br />It fits well enough, but its shorter than I'd like. It's 'flowy' so it isn't unflattering or clingy to the body. But, I want something I can throw on quick if I'm in a rush. And this isn't it. It's cute and I love the color but its not for me."
3.0,"These shades look cool and the price is unbeatable, but you kind of get what you pay for. The frames fit me very snuggly so I would imagine if you had an even slightly larger head you would be in trouble. The worst part about the glasses are I found the metal nose rigdge to be quite sharp and stabby if it is positioned on your nose at a certain angle."
3.0,One wash and it will not fit...had to &#34;gift&#34; it...too $$ to return...order up one size.
3.0,I took this shirt with me on a trip to Europe with two other girls I got lots of smiles I ended up believing it at a Airbnb
3.0,The fabric is a little too heavy than I expected looks good though but I couldn’t keep it cuz they don’t take it back and it was too big on my so I gave it away
3.0,Very very long and I’m 5’6 this dress dragged on the ground.. I have to find someone to alter it or give to someone really takll
3.0,Kind of a quirky design. I can tolerate other watches that are by the same company. Big holes. Big buckle. But the red all together with the other big components makes it look clowny not cool.
3.0,I wanted clip on earrings and was sent pierce. I do not wear pierced earrings. But they are beautiful. Had to give them away.😢
3.0,Just okay.
3.0,I really like the straps because they don't look like bra straps and go great with any spaghetti strap top but the sizes are limited. Would be great if they made them for cups bigger than a C. It was very pretty on but didn't cover enough to keep
3.0,"these look very cool.  smudging is too easy and hard to remove even with a microfiber.  I bought these to use as computer glasses because I wanted the dark orange tint, but the tint is blue from the inside, so exactly the opposite of what I wanted. They still look cool as sunglasses but pretty obnoxious. Its like a motorcycle visor without the helmet.  Very TRON"
3.0,These glasses help with the glare of lights at night. It does not solve the problem but it does help so I feel we are  better having them than not having them.
3.0,These worked for a couple of months but then wouldn't hold onto my shirt anymore.
3.0,Pros:<br /><br />- look realistic<br />- a lot of rings for a small price<br />- they don't fall off<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- cause pain after around 30 min of wear<br />- caused brusing on my earlobes
3.0,"I loved this swim suit! It is adorable but I thought the bottoms went up higher. I'm 5ft 8.5 inches and I wanted to hide some back rolls and finding Swim suits for big girls are hard. I still really like it, I'm just going to have to slim down a bit because my back has some rolls that don't need to be shown. Other than that it did fit it just my body parts I don't want exposed as much, such a my back."
3.0,Cute dress and nice pattern. The material is hot for summer and the XXL was small-usually take XL.
3.0,The material is great but the color is so off it’s not funny.  Described as red it’s a pale pink
3.0,"Okay, this shirt is extremely comfy and adorable! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that is is not true to size. I ordered an xl because it’s a crop top and I wanted to make sure it wouldn’t be too short. I normally wear large size for shirts and this shirt fits me like a small. That being said, this shirt is adorable, comfy, and a great price! Just make sure to get a size or two bigger than you normally wear :)"
3.0,"I really liked my first two pairs of these tights, but this last one I ordered is too short above the crotch and so my butt crack is exposed. brrrrrrrrr"
3.0,Great for tall girls.<br />Not for larger breasts.
3.0,This is very thick material I like it more thin
3.0,I bought these to wear under dresses for modesty. The material was not see through and was light weight which is what I wanted.  I followed the size chart when ordering but these shorts were too big.  I am 5’8” about 230 lbs and ordered a size XXXL.  Due to the sizing I cannot really comment on how well they smooth or if the legs or waist band roll.  I will be returning these :(
3.0,I was disappointed that the stiching on the pintucks was lousy.  There were several loose threads and one of the tucks came loose. Now I will have to set up my sewing machine to repair it.  I may just resew the pintucks.
3.0,These are nice and tiny but some pairs are very thin metal and bend very easy
3.0,"I’m really quite disappointed with the way this looked on my body. I bought a size bigger in hopes that it would not cling to every hump and lump on my body, but it did. If you do not have naturally perky boobs that do not need cups or wiring to “lift” them up, this is not the nightie for you! I love the richness of the purple and it was extremely soft material, but if you do not have the typical size 6 poster model body, this will probably not make you happy."
3.0,Dress is advertised as a T Shirt Dresses Casual Swing Dress.  It was at least one size too small for the thin elastic fabric.  I ordered an XL as I wear the US size 14 fit but was still clingier than desired with the stretchy fabric
3.0,"I am tempted to purchase this item, but the cm. conversions given on the size chart and in the product description differ a good bit.  Sure would hate to be disappointed. Seller should be notified of this."
3.0,"Shirts are nice. Good material, but they run small. I just gave them to my daughter."
3.0,Shoulders to small. To long
3.0,"This hat is so trending and super cute! But it just didn’t fit my head, if it was a little bigger then I would give it 5 stars."
3.0,I purchased this hat for 7.99 with a coupon code. It worked well. I put the hat on and it barely comes down to half my forehead. It’s a single layer crochet probably made with a loom but for 7.99 it was worth it. Would I spend more on it and be happy? No.
3.0,Snags easily and super see-through!!
3.0,These are pretty but do much larger than I expected. They are also very fragile.
3.0,"Wanted this to work!  The chain size was fine, but could not fit my beads over the end caps after removing the screw-on part.  My beads have fairly large holes, so this was disappointing.  The heart on the extender is not &#34;puffed&#34; and three dimensional as shown in the picture.  It is just a flat cut-out.  The metal is not as shiny as silver, of course, because it is stainless steel.  It is a nice bracelet overall and looks very sturdy, but I will be sending it back because of the size problem and ordering a bracelet with a regular style clasp."
3.0,"I buy a lot of clothes on Amazon, I mean A LOT. I am almost always a size large but the reviews for this dress said it runs small. Nobody accurately portrayed just HOW SMALL this thing is. I ordered an xl ""to be safe"" and couldnt even get it over my head! I had my 15 year old try it on (she's typically a woman's size M) and it was too small for her too. Then I had my 12 year old put it on (photo included) and it looks exactly like the photo BUT ON A CHILD!! Pretty dissapointed because this is a gorgeous dress and the sleeves are everything. I guess I'll get to admire it on my 12 year old instead of myself 🙄."
3.0,Ordered 4 and one does not work (ring). You can shake it until the cows come home but no sound. Lack of quality control I guess. Also the screw part of the hook is poor quality. Easily cross thread - but for a few bucks each quality is not expected. 3 out of 4 working not bad
3.0,My 9 year old Tsukihoshi tennis shoes were done and I didn’t want to send him off to camp w $60 sneaker. I never saw the final death of these Qansi sneakers. He left the destroyed sneakers at camp. He does run havoc on shoes but I expected brand new sneakers to last more then 4 weeks.
3.0,Nice bag but the Zipper sticks.
3.0,Sort of narrow and the sole is sort of thin and hard in my opinion. I will wear them when I just need a quick slip on shoe
3.0,"Decent no-show socks but are very thin compared to the ones I have that are Converse branded.  These feel more like liners that females would wear in flats than normal athletic socks to be worn with running shoes, etc.<br />Haven't had them long enough to comment on durability."
3.0,Good belt but smaller than what ordered
3.0,Length and fit are good. The fabric though is very itchy and doesn't feel comfortable.
3.0,"Had to send back because the one size fits “most” was misleading. I don’t consider myself to have a big head, but apparently I need to alter my perception. I’ve never had to send a hat back 😅. Looked amazing though!! Just wish it wasn’t so tight on my cranium. If they offered it in a larger size, I’d most definitely order another. I hope this helps."
3.0,I never paid attention but this has to go in the bottom of the phone which is not as cute
3.0,Great for the price. The tint is darker than the picture which was disappointing.
3.0,Like the skirt. Not worth the price.
3.0,"They fit very well, but they are very thin, slightly porous polyester. There is no sponge. I do not feel safe in them,<br />and wear another cotton mask over it."
3.0,I like them but I usually wear a 81/2 or 9 and the 8 was large.  Because they didn't fit right they slide off a lot.
3.0,"Took a long time to get and didn't really work, at least not enough to make it worth buying."
3.0,"I quickly bought these for a dance competition I had over a weekend and they worked on the spot. However, the part where you unscrew the ball of the barbell is still very rough and it hurt a little putting it into my ear. Like I said, they were good for using a couple days but not for long term. If you’re looking long term then I would invest in something else."
3.0,The bottom part is not nice
3.0,"This dress runs small.  By at least a size.  Even if it did fit I didn’t like the style and it wasn’t flattering.  If you wanna try it, I’d size up one and still expect it to be extremely fitting.  Returned."
3.0,"It does not very much like the picture, be warned. Once on, it doesn’t look bad but there is very little to it. The top isn’t bad but not shaped for a gal with any amount of bosom. It’s like a string back bra, with over the shoulder straps, not all all like the picture. The skirt - it’s basically a long loin cloth so be prepared with appropriate underwear (low rider nude thong). The sections between the decorative vinyl “hardware” and the fabric are elastic to allow it to easily slip on but size small needed to be taken in to keep it from falling off a model who wears a size 2. The armbands look a bit ridiculous. All in all, it’s fine for a Halloween party or bedroom cosplay but better to make your own for a cosplay festival."
3.0,Son bonita
3.0,"I was excited about this blouse. I used the size chart in the photos and decided on XL. Do not go by this size chart, is it WAY off! I normally wear an XL, but this blouse was way too tight in the bust. If you're a busty gal I would recommend going up at least one or maybe two sizes. Unfortunately, I'll be sending it back."
3.0,As expected for the price
3.0,Did not know it was “dry clean only “ ! Wouldn’t have bought it had I known.
3.0,Yo large in my size
3.0,Product didn't fit well for my face. Nose piece was too narrow and the overall quality wasn't great.
3.0,"Needed a tie for an event and got this for it.  It is simple and does the job.  Doesnt feel flimsy, material feels good.  I dont wear ties too often and all my other ties were way out of fashion.  This one shouldnt go out of fashion.<br /><br />Quality for the price is good, def not the top quality ties, and shouldnt expect it."
3.0,Definitely size up or else you’ll feel like your uni-boob can’t breathe!
3.0,"The ""lighted dial"" was too dim for me to see the numbers easily.  Sent back and purchased the Casio Illuminator."
3.0,"I bought this eyeglass case because of its hard shell case and attractive color themes.  In fact, it is a very attractive case. However, I had no idea that it would be oversized.  As a result, it takes up way too much space/weight in my purse.  I'll have to use it for reading glasses on a desk.  Now I know to look for the dimensions on an eyeglass case."
3.0,I bought this one on Prime Day. It reminds me of a stocking. looks nice but is just ok. Doesn't reverb the sunlight as much as I hoped.
3.0,Cute shirt but the size/cut is off.  Bought 3 different ones and the cut of shirt in the underarms is uneven. Several other ladies bought same shirt for big camping trip and had same problem. Still kept them because the color was nice and it's just camping...
3.0,Very small for an extra large
3.0,"It’s the perfect one day only set, it cake apart the same day, bows cake off and shorts dethreaded."
3.0,"Color was great. But the seams were coming apart when we got them, the cords raveled on 4 of them within about 2 hours of the girls wearing them. These were just for looks for a play and they didn’t hold up with nothing in them so I doubt if a person was to “really” use these they wouldn’t last a day or two."
3.0,"Well I ordered 2g and received 6g. Also be aware that the back part does not unscrew, which confuses me."
3.0,Photos dont show the yellow stripe at the back. I purchased these boots for comfort and style. The yellow color was  outside my comfort zone for office wear.
3.0,"adorable boots, however did not receive them with studs on the back. just plain boots."
3.0,"Awesome mask, however some of the paint was chipped along the side."
3.0,They look very pretty and I could assemble it easily. The problem is it was opened one time when my daughter played gymnastics. She was lucky that she was at home but if it happen somewhere else she might loose her watch unnoticeably.
3.0,"This is just ok. I liked the colour and length. However the side was stitched funny and made side pockets instead of defining the body made bumpy sides making the dress look dowdy. The material is thick and nice, wish it would have been made better."
3.0,"It's great for a kid or teenager - it looks cheesy, the roping has a sheen that I don't like. It's cute but fragile."
3.0,"The hat was a bit too snug, as I have thick hair. It gave me a headache and was not as cute as pictured. Returning..."
3.0,I feel like I am wearing a curtain....this thing is sooo thin
3.0,The dress is gorgeous however it is very small. I am between and xl and xxl. I ordered this dress in an xxl and it is skin tight.
3.0,They are really cute but they fade within the fist use.
3.0,"I thought I was getting a great deal, but it was too good to be true. I LOVE the earrings, they're beautiful. It's the bracelets that have fallen apart before getting a chance to wear them. They arrive flat and are not very flexible. It's challenging to put it on by yourself because it isn't very flexible. There's a magnetic closure, but by the time I got it clasped, a couple of the straps came out. I pretty much just paid for the earrings."
3.0,"Product came as described pretty happy with it. Take two stars off because the gloves are very poorly made and will start falling off soon, the hat doesn’t fit all that well. For a one off time is fine but definitely not cosplay worthy or anything of that sort."
3.0,"The fit was fine.  I kind of liked what they were doing with the uneven hem. There is just something that, for me, is a little off with the hem design. Good enough to wear. But not a great look."
3.0,"I purchased these for a costume.  For what I needed them for, they worked well.  I would most likely not buy them again for daily use.  They are a bit thin and tight on my legs.  I could not get them as high above my knee as you see in the picture.  Definitely not for a thunder thigh kind of a gal :)"
3.0,"They are made well, but they do leave a one-inch gap on both sides of my face so I need to double mask which is what we’re supposed to be doing now anyway."
3.0,The actual dress doesn’t have any form to it like this photo. It is a straight/box like  silhouette. Fits like a really long shirt.<br />If you pin the back you could add more body to it.<br />Material is thin as expected. Quality isn’t amazing but it’s a cute dress. I ordered a Large usually a medium because I wanted to use this as a dress and needed the extra length of a large.
3.0,"They are quite short and keep riding up out of my boots.  They're okay, but wish they would stay put."
3.0,"Personally, I did not find it very comfortable… And I also didn’t find that the image was sharp enough like good sunglasses. I wanted to use it on my deck while reading a book, and it just wasn’t going to work for me."
3.0,"The shirt fit well and looked very flattering. I have a 40 D and 140 lbs chest and ordered a L. Tapered in the waist giving that curvy look and fit well on the hip and stayed in place. The V cut neckline with crisscross and very sexy and classy. Material is stretch to meld to you body and comfortable Had to send this back sadly.  The sleeve are a raw surged edge and not drappy like they are in the photo. I was not confident that this would hold out in the long run and had seem a lot of potential for this to fall apart. If not for the poor craftsmanship this would have easily been in my top 5 go to shirts.  Hopefully I can find something similar that is better made.<br /><br />If my review helped you, please click the helpful button. Or comment if I can answer any other questions &#60;3"
3.0,"My LO is skinny but this dress doesn’t have any stretch to it. Since it’s pull over style dress, it is impossible to wear it.<br />Fabric is so soft and print and design is cute so I’m ordering a size up."
3.0,The torso potion of this sweater looks exactly like the picture. The material is nice heavy and good quality. It is really nice looking and feels great too. However the sleeves do not bell out like the picture. They are just slightly wider than the cuff at the wrist. Had I not purchased it purely for the sleeve I would have kept it! It is a really nice sweater though; if you're cool with the different  sleeve ratio.
3.0,"I am not really experienced in the front closure bras. I remembered why this is my regular size bra 44DD but my girls kept wanting to come out of the cups. I raised up my shirt and that front closure looked like it was hanging on for its life it was twisted and stretched really far. When I first put it on I was in love it was comfortable and seemed to fit perfectly, it is very soft. As the night went on I looked down and my breasts were hanging out over the cups. Am I having a fitting issue I am not sure?"
3.0,"Shoes look good, but fit very large. I wear a size 9 in women, and ordered a large. There is about two inches of extra space. I will probably order these in a smaller size, because they do look good."
3.0,"Good sweater, but was sent the wrong color"
3.0,Was very thin and didn’t fit me well. I returned.
3.0,Fit closer to a size lower. Was really disappointed as I like this shirt
3.0,"Just a loose, plain shirt, but it fit weird, like a sack."
3.0,"La correa dela pulsera es muy larga, y no me queda bien, además se detiene mucho."
3.0,"Other than being running a bit small, I like the shirt."
3.0,Returned the item.. To small.
3.0,A little tight on my legs...will have to extend the elastic for my large legs
3.0,Sad it was too small
3.0,she like them as her water shoes
3.0,"I purchased this hat for my 9 year old daughter. It looks really cute on her if it wasn't too tight. The fabric is good and a very sturdy cotton.  However, the interior layer was not tacked down. So it wrinkles really bad and flops down unless you iron it. (Be sure not to iron directly on the white mesh lining or it will melt.)<br />The description says it's for women/ladies, but it hardly fits my daughter's head. She doesn't have a huge head or hair!<br />I was able to successfully flatten the clear shield piece by placing a towel over it and ironing the towel."
3.0,love the look and feel of these blouse. too bad it runs REALLY small. I normally wear a size XL in tops but ordered this in 3x to have plenty of room. It JUST fits and afraid that after it is washed it won't fit.
3.0,Not made for larger breast. Very little support if any. Had to to pull the pads out because they were made for an A cup. Also the material is rough and scratchy. They did arrive on time however.
3.0,Fogs up
3.0,"It is a really cute top, but not as long in the back as the picture shows... Sides are rounded... Sleeves are a very good length and work well with a short jacket over it..."
3.0,The bottom of it was too loose.
3.0,Looks good but itchy.
3.0,This was a really cute bathing suit but it just didn't fit our average 2 T  sized kiddo. Would have been a great bargain if it worked out.
3.0,Hems started coming out after a couple of washings.  Liked them otherwise.
3.0,This was not true to size
3.0,Thought it would help keep me warm. It doesn't
3.0,They are too small because they fit like bikini cut and are not breifs.
3.0,"While the design is really cute, shipping was fast, it is much larger than expected and unfortunately the ring that holds the chain broke off after just one day."
3.0,"they are pretty, but are very thin and cheaply made..."
3.0,"Bought a pack for me and my friend to use at Barre class. Although they grip well, the socks are too big they kept sliding off during class."
3.0,One of them was broken but it still worked
3.0,I wanted to like this so badly but I just have a hard time getting rompers to fit because my torso is a little shorter. I’m 5’3” 140 lbs and ordered a Medium. It fit comfortably except the straps were too long so it hung very awkwardly on my shoulders and around my waist. I tried pinning the straps shorter but then it wouldn’t stretch much to get it on in the first place. Sadly will be returning.
3.0,I was disappointed in the fabric:( it feels like a lightweight polyester... I have some<br />Other polyester dresses but they feel like silk ... this one just feels cheap unfortunately.  I actually didn’t wear it to the funeral ... I am not sure what I will do with it.
3.0,This is super tiny. Disappointing in that regard. Good quality.
3.0,didn't work for me
3.0,Good quality. Hat was way small though. More like toddler size.
3.0,Cheap fabric but perfect for what I needed
3.0,"When I saw these I thought they were the cutest snow boots. I thought they were made by asics (i'm a huge asics fan and all my running shoes are asics), but they were not. Plus, they didn't feel comfortable walking like a regular sneaker, these shoes felt rigid and tight. The boot part is warm, but i think you need to wear it w/ stockings to look cute, otherwise, it's kinda silly."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday. She asked for a watch that counted her steps. I saw this one and thought I’d thoroughly impress her since she loves Frozen 2 and it counted steps. Unfortunately, the one feature she asked for doesn’t work on this watch. Very disappointing. I asked her what she does like about it and she said “you can play games on it.” She just got it today so hopefully it lasts a while."
3.0,Slips off the foot easily and doesn’t have good grip on the bottom. Baby can slip on tile.
3.0,Like.  Came as expected. Fits normal ear holes.
3.0,"The photos showed CLEAR lenses, which darkened when UV light shines on them, instead the lenses are too dark to wear indoors or any darkened area. So you have to take them off and put them away, major hastle! Would not buy them again!"
3.0,"I ordered this for my dad because he already has other items from this brand and he loves them. The quality was good, but the finish was bad. The sewing lines were not straight and there were threads all over, not the lose one that you can pick off, but the ones that you have to cut."
3.0,"Super cute dress.  Very form fitting. I am 5 2"" and 115 lbs.  I bought a small and a medium as I was in a crunch.  Had to return them both unfortunately.  The small was too small.  The medium actually fit but the lace around the shoulders was so big and sticking out.  I could have put a stitch in there which would have solved the problem.  Ended up just finding something else."
3.0,Runs a tad large and short.  Prefer smaller and longer.
3.0,"Cute boot. And comfortable in the sole and warm. Just small. It is not something that you could wear thick socks with if you get your usual size. We got the 6.5 which my daughter wears and as tight as it was on the toes, we should have gone up at least a half a size. We are going to try to do the frozen water bottle trick and stretch the boots. Now the upper calf of the boot was fine. There was space. But if you are like my daughter and your muscle doesn't look like a chicken leg, (you know one small bump and then bone) you have thick muscle all the way down your leg you might find the lower portion of this boot tight. My daughter did. She was able to get it on, but it was strangling her lower leg. There are some really nice things about this boot but not enough to try and wear. If your upper calf and only that is large this will work. If you are narrow in your toes this will work otherwise it might be uncomfortable."
3.0,"I purchased this product in September 2021, because of the reviews and the details stated it wouldn’t fade. I wore the ankle a lot, I think I’ve only taken it off twice before today when I took it off permanently because the charm and clamp has faded. I paid $10 for it and got a good 8 months of wear out of it, so I guess I can’t be too upset 🤷🏾‍♀️."
3.0,"I have a new Apple iWatch SE GPS and wanted and elastic style band. The band material is very good; looks good, feels good.  Band adjustment is fine and works well for a tight or loose feel.  However, I cannot recommend purchasing because the ends of the band that slide into the watch case are too long and extend out on either side of the case - so now you have 4 sharp points to catch on clothing and is very much a scratch risk.  Apple iWatch bands are suppose to be interchangeable across all Apple watches but not this one! I would return it but there's a blizzard outside and not taking chances.  But at your own risk!"
3.0,I really like the beads.  This was purchased for a young boy and I like the color and the texture of the beads.  I am not as pleased with the metal parts of the rosary.  The feel very tin-ish.  No feeling of weight at all.
3.0,Luce como falda barata
3.0,"Very cute, for a young girl"
3.0,"Material is soft, but the bottoms are see through!"
3.0,"The dress is nice and fits well. I went one size up.<br />However it is super short (I am already short: 5ft 1in). Therefore, I recommend to go at least one size up (or two if you are taller than me)"
3.0,They are pretty much what you can get for two dollars each. Definitely not as good as Fruit of Looms or Hanes that I usually get. Too little cotton in the material makes it less comfortable wearing. It feels more slippery on the surface too.
3.0,I had a hard time putting this on. I know it says to make the opening wider and gently close once on it but this product is not going to last very long if I do that every time I wear them.
3.0,"Even though they were cute, the appliqué didn’t last. One week in, and the rainbow just fell right off.<br /><br />Disappointing."
3.0,I loved everything about these sunglasses EXCEPT the nose pieces! They dug into my nose causing me to have to remove them to take a break from them throughout the day...inconvenient in the Mexico sun.
3.0,More plastic than anticipated.  Pattern is just on one side.  Would not buy again. Would want a more delicate and lacy product.
3.0,"Not for the heavy set women! If you are a plus size (e.g. 18-20) and also have a bit of a tummy, I would not recommend this outfit as it makes you look like a doughnut. I had to return it because it runs small and does not sit well on my tummy. I am 5'7'' and weigh 215 lbs. Length wise, the skirt is long enough for my height."
3.0,The dress looked so good in  the ad and it came quickly but it is paper thin and wrinkles.  It is too thin to wear without a slip so be aware.  Not worth the price!
3.0,"These ar such a disappointment in looks.  They're both brown frames, and look nothing like the colors in the photo. They are much more flimsy than the last ones I ordered. I'm not sure from who. The frame colors of those glasses look like your photo and they're  better quality. I'm sure the lens will cut eye srtrain"
3.0,They served there purpose! But was only able to wear them for 1 hour before they started to hurt my ears.
3.0,I didn't realize it was a full zip when I ordered it
3.0,"Cute top, it’s more like a long sleeved T-shirt than a sweater"
3.0,Not strong enough.
3.0,Better quality than expected. Got for my husband to wear when we eloped- shipped so fast!
3.0,"I am very disappointed that the beads are tied off at the ends before the braid. The beads are tied tightly together so they've not very flexible and my arm hair gets caught in them and it pulls it. Not ideal.<br /><br />Love the lava beads, just really really wish it wasn't tied off the way it was. Not sure why they found that necessary."
3.0,"I was so excited to love these jeans, but they were HUGE! I would recommend sizing down 1 or even 2 sizes when purchasing."
3.0,"I have to take it to jeweller because it did not come with the pieces that connect the watch to the belt itself. Very disappointed. On another note, It is a beautifully made."
3.0,The shirt is a little too long.  so it would cover the top of pants if you wear it outside and not tugged in.  so the image is a bit misleading as the guy in the picture is pulling up the short so you can't get a sense of how long it is.
3.0,Had to give it to my mom. Too small
3.0,Ok but lower quality
3.0,What can you say.  Will work on some shoes and too short for others.  Pretty though!
3.0,Fabric okay but only a midi if you are under 5’2”.  I’m 5’9”. Barely came to my knees.
3.0,Okay shirt but I usually wear a medium in all my shirts and I ordered the large for this particular shirt and it fit a little snug.
3.0,"Falls apart but delivery fine, thanks."
3.0,I love material and the way the dress feels however I ordered a medium and it fits like an extra small so maybe order up a size or two
3.0,"Great idea but not enough grip power for anything beyond 1 or 2 loops of a cable. Works better on plastic cables, rather than fabric"
3.0,"Very tiny. The top in its entirety barely cover my boobs and certainly not my torso like an actual pajama tank. The shirts are way too small, but stretchy! The shorts are the only good part of this set. I threw the top in my Going-to-Consignment-Bag already."
3.0,The strength on these run stronger than the glasses state.  I would go down one if you want to be happy with them.
3.0,Not very grippy...expected a little more
3.0,The Velcro fastener makes great adjustability. The back seam was separating upon arrival.
3.0,Nice shoe but sizing is off...my daughter wears 3.5 and the 4 was too small.
3.0,Beautiful bracelets but one broke the first time wearing.
3.0,"Not much stretch to the shirt. Oddly enough, I ordered two shirts, one white one black. The white one fits better."
3.0,Ordered two at the same time.  They came separately on two different days and were the same design unfortunately.
3.0,They were too loose fitting to be safe for transferring from my wheelchair. They fit but my foot slid inside the slipper.
3.0,Muy flojo
3.0,"no suction, and leaks"
3.0,"These leggings are the cutest thing and so warm and fuzzy. They're great for this cold, rainy weather we've been having lately. The fit is nice, though the little skirt could have been a little longer, or shorter. As it is, it's a little in the way and not so stylish. Still great to wear with a tight shirt/top and boots. waistband is a little too tight though not a big deal."
3.0,It’s pretty! Shiny. But heavy. Heavy metal chain holds that pretty necklace.
3.0,"ok for the price, but don't &#34;appear&#34; to be more than costume jewelry"
3.0,The product is beautiful.. Unfortunately I was giving them as a gift as was lead to believe that they would be in a gift box and they were not...
3.0,"I wanted to really love these. They could be a little snugger, although I did order a 2X, normally I'm a 1X, 5'7, 220, I ordered the larger size because I'm going a road trip this winter and I'd read reviews that said the legs were a little short. They were right. More spandex maybe. LOVE the pockets. Still looking for the perfect pair, sigh."
3.0,"I like the design but sizing, while wearable, is a bit tight at the top. Putting on, taking off the socks takes some pulling and tagging."
3.0,The wife likes it and that's all that matters
3.0,It will work ok for just when I don want to take my purse but does not work for every day use does not hold what my wallet hold now.
3.0,Didn't love the earrings because the color wasn't very pronounced.  Returning the earrings were a breeze.  The company was lovely and I bought another pair which was a little larger and had a deeper color.
3.0,I like it but it is not as bright and beautiful as the picture shows. Would be 5 stars if colors were more vibrant/ clear.
3.0,"My nephew loved the sweater, so we kept it. However is ran a little small."
3.0,"Love the tank top and the style, but the fit runs small.  I would say order a larger size, unless you normally wear bigger than an XL, then, I wouldn't bother.  I normally wear a L, but this XL is too small for me!"
3.0,"The thickness is good, but you’ll need to go up about two sizes. Also it doesn’t have a label with care instructions: otherwise, it’s a cute set. I had to return."
3.0,It looks cute but the bottom is slippery which makes it unusable for a baby that is learning to walk.
3.0,The fabric of this pant not good as previous order
3.0,Size chart not accurate.  They run on the small side
3.0,You'd have to be *extremely* well endowed for this to fit correctly
3.0,"Fits smaller than other nice (Foxcroft) shirts.  Would return except don't want to pay return postage, since I paid delivery. Quality is good but will not order from this site again.  Unsure of fit."
3.0,Like very comfort
3.0,It runs small so it was a little bit snug. But beautiful. And good quality.
3.0,"I usually wear a small, so I purchased a small. It fit perfectly in the waist area, but was super tight in the best. I have to return them."
3.0,"These are quite comfortable and have plenty of room to move around in. I think they are more of a snowboard pants, than for skiing as they are quite bulky. They will end up adding some drag while going down hill. The waist does run a bit small, which is odd as the rest of these pants run big. The buttoned waistband holds nicely as does the bottoms, which makes it easy to take off and fit around a pair of boots."
3.0,"I'm giving it three stars for SIZE alone. These are ALWAYS too small and I think its because they are made in China where people are ridiculously small to begin with. (Try buying clothes on amazon since China was allowed to infiltrate, everything!!! A 9-10 is like a 5x in our sizes!) That said, its a shame they don't make these things SOOOOOO much bigger!! They really are wonderful in many cases. I bought the largest size, I'm a 38 DD and while I can wear them, the coverage is not at ALL like the picture. If they were twice the size they are I'd LOVE them!!! I'd buy them all day long! They just run so damn small and this is the best company on here as far as size goes. I think even if you are the smalles chest you have to order two more sizes up for full coverage. You HAVE to read the box top inside to get them on correctly. If you do it the way you THINK it should go on? It won't work well. And I don't see anyone being able to get these up under their arms like the photo. I wish they fit like the photo. When they come out with an H pair I'll buy ten pairs!! LOL  IF you sweat on your chest, which I don't, they will come off in the heat. These are so great for cooler weather and they don't make you sweat by wearing them. They are not made of Latex like some other person said, you cannot be allergic to them, they are silicone and no one is allergic to silicone. I'm allergic to latex and I'd be blistered if they were latex. Be careful with the clasps, you could rightfully tear them off if you aren't careful, but they do seem sturdy after fussing with them for some time. I've had them on for an hour and a half and the right side just came off. I feel it creeping off again. So? That means you have to rinse them and let them dry to be sticky again. It will continue to come off if I don't do this. I just have a tee shirt on, if I had a halter top on, it would stay on, or a dress that is form fitting like summer dresses. Those would help hold them in place. By themselves they will probably come off every few hours. It would be great if they didn't but such is skin with its oils and such. Make sure you have no lotions on, and actually they will stay on better if you alcohol your skin first and really dry it out. That will get you a couple of hours before your skin re-hydrates and re-oils itself. I'm okay with these, I just wish they came in bigger sizes."
3.0,"Good deal, fits best"
3.0,The dress is super cute. Unfortunately the arms of the cover up are too tight.
3.0,Looks cute but fit and material isn’t the best. I’m 5’6’’ 160lbs and wear a 34DD. Bottoms fit decent and have good coverage but the top has little to no support.
3.0,"Fit well, good compression."
3.0,Overall it fit my waste and hips very well. I just didn't like the boob area felt like I could have a boob or nipple fall out at anytime and the neck was too snug for my liking. The material and quality was great but I decided to return it.
3.0,Beading was very pretty. The slit was up to my panties and I’m only 5’1 so be prepared ladies. Very pretty but fits strangely not fitted in the waist square almost
3.0,"I loved everything about these pants--the color, the weight of the fabric, the full cut so that they were almost skirtlike, the comfort. But I ended up giving them away because no matter what I tried they gave me a weird camel toe. I'm 5' 4.5"" so there's no real reason for this. At first I wore longer tops,  but when I got tired of that or constantly adjusting the pants to fix the look (they didn't *feel* tight in the crotch, the fabric just lay funny), they had to go. Sad."
3.0,Xxl was the size of a medium runs really small
3.0,"This hat and gloves set is knit acrylic and the hat is fleece lined.  They are very soft soft, comfortable  and very warm. The hat fits my head well and the gloves do too,  but the fingers feel a little short - base of the fingers do not come all the way to my palm - they stop at about 1/2' short.  Still, they are quite usable and comfortable.  The tips of the thumbs and index fingers have a coating that allows touch screen use.  It works well (I have an iPhone 14), even though the glove is quite thick.<br /><br />UPDATE: Lowering to 3 stars because the seam on the cap unraveled on the first washing (machine, gentle cycle, cold water)."
3.0,great price for it.. i personally have to get use to that shape since i never wore them before.. the are really soft..the fit but feel somewhat small..
3.0,Fits good lights suck the shoes never want to charge all the way!
3.0,The bottom is comfortable but the top hurts.
3.0,I  returned item
3.0,Super cute but the scratched up part was put on the back side of the pants not the front
3.0,"This is a heavy duty and heavy multi-purpose watch which communicates via BT with your smartphone.  In my case, it is an iPhone 6s.  Setup requires some time using the instructions but is not overly complicated.  As others have mentioned, an app communicates with the watch.  The watch hands rotate to indicate messages and calls.  You must still answer them on your smartphone.  You can also control a couple of other functions of your smartphone with your watch, such as music pause/fwd/reverse.  It also works like a fitbit.<br /><br />This is a very well made waterproof watch which communicates with your smartphone to a degree but I keep wondering exactly who this is marketed to.  If you want full smartphone to watch communication you're much better off purchasing a Apple watch or similar for android.  There are cheaper dial watches which provide similar capabilities and don't communicate with smartphones.  If you're looking for a very heavy duty watch which provides both normal and access to some smartphone functions this may be for you.  I recommend you research your needs first then determine if this watch fits for you.<br /><br />I will wear this sometime for rugged outdoor activity but will mainly use an Apple watch for better interactivity with my iPhone."
3.0,"It’s ok for what it is. Runs small. I read the reviews pl and ordered a size up. I usually wear a small, so I ordered a medium. The cardigan fit, however, fits more like an XS."
3.0,"Very cute and sheer just like the photo. I am petite so it was a bit long. Also, the elastic around the bust area is not tight enough. There are strings in front to tie it, but when you tie it, it does not make the elastic tighter. I attached photos to show.<br />It will serve its purpose, but I had to do more tailoring than I expected."
3.0,Ok so this hat is LARGE. It is not or should not be in the baby category. It fits my head perfectly but I bought this for my 2.5 year old... even if I snap it on the smallest it goes it’s still way to big for him. It is a cute hat but the sizing is not meant for toddlers and definitely not for babies. I should have checked the sizing which states 55-60cm which is roughly 21-23 inches.
3.0,Cute suit but I’m returning it because the top was not flattering on my mom tummy. I have a “flat-ish” stomach but the ruffles hit at the worst spot for me. I love the bottom however. Cute overall and nice quality just not flattering on me. Would be better in someone with less curves overall maybe. True to size.
3.0,Picture looks way better than the product :(
3.0,small. Returned
3.0,battery went dead 2 days after i received
3.0,"The stores in my area that carry Stone Mountain have gone out of business.  I like this brand.  I wanted a purse with a closed top, outside zippered pocket, and insidezippered pocket.<br /><br />I found the inside zipper pocket to be too small  and shallow for any practical use.  It holds my vehicle insurance card and a couple Band-Aids. I would call it useless.  I'm very disappointed in that.  It is one feature I really wanted.  There are two outside zippered pockets.  There are OK in size.  They are also some small pockets that I am on the outside that I am not sure what they are meant to hold.<br /><br />If I could have seen this purse in a store, I might not have bought it.  I will use it, but it isn't all I had hoped for."
3.0,Perfect length but fabric is not that great
3.0,"Doesn’t look exactly  like the provided picture, not the slouchy fit in the arms I was looking for like the picture shows."
3.0,"The product itself is great, but notice the image does not match the description.  This is a 2-pack not a 3-pack."
3.0,I returned it! Not as cute as pictured.
3.0,"Attractive but by the end of the 3rd day, the black paint began to fall off."
3.0,fair buy
3.0,"Overall, it is okay. Didn’t last past the night of wear! I would guess there are better out there"
3.0,I was a little disappointed in this
3.0,Chain turned while the circle is still silver
3.0,"not for a 40"" + waist.  not long enough."
3.0,"Just not my taste. It really widens at the bottom of the dress and lays kind of flat, I think it looks frumpy. I would bet they clipped the back of the model's dress at the waist. This dress does not give you a waist."
3.0,"These are NOT noise cancelling headphones!  They do however allow me to think when the TV is up too loud.  (My mother is hard of hearing and finds it too difficult to lower and raise the volume on the TV  remote.)  If she needs help,  I CAN STILL HEAR HER so I feel less guilty wearing them!"
3.0,"I ordered a size up as most of the reviews that it was kind of small. I just tried it on and this is absolutely just a one-size-fits-all attempt at an ugly sweater. the sweater itself is absolutely fine however I purposely got a large so that it would be a little large on me as I typically wear a small medium, fortunately it fit like a small and I was hoping for something that would actually look cute with leggings. also this sweater has no tags on it whatsoever and looks quite cheaply made I'm assuming it cost about a dollar to make it in China and then they ship it over here and charge way too much over the holidays. anyways if you're looking for just a general sweater and it's last-minute not a horrible purchase but make sure that you always wear a size small and are hoping for a small sweater"
3.0,"not big enough, and not so flattering giving it to mother."
3.0,"Cute, comfortable, stretchy material somewhat small"
3.0,Very high waist
3.0,The color is beautiful. Top fits perfectly but shorts are at least two sizes too small.
3.0,Very pretty but was disappointed with the fabric quality and dye. Very wrinkly and requires going at it with an iron big time. Washed once delicate cycle and I can already see it faded a bit.
3.0,They are a little thin and don't reach above my calf
3.0,"i bought these thinking they were going to be tight. i was wrong they are baggy, they also dont look like the photo., very light gray."
3.0,"I ordered a size S based on the seller’s size chart, and it fit fine. I actually think the dress is pretty cute and I like the way it looks. But...the fabric. Ugh. If only it had been made with something else. It’s made of a very thick, very heavy, very hot polyester that has that typical polyester sheen to it. I was sweating just from the short amount of time it took to try this dress on, and I’m not even someone who is normally warm. I kept the dress in my closet for a few days to think about it, but even if I could get past how thick the fabric is, I couldn’t get past how obviously polyester it looked. I ultimately decided to return it. I’m not giving the dress a bad rating because it’s exactly what it was supposed to be, it just wasn’t for me. I am considering that I actually liked how it fit and how the style looked on me; I just didn’t care for the fabric.<br /><br />**Note - If my review has been helpful to you, click on the button below and let me know!**"
3.0,very very thin material - nice drape but thin thin thin
3.0,Get it 1-2 size bigger
3.0,Extremely......Extremely sheer and see thru
3.0,Same issues as most shoes of this type. The insole slips when in walking in water.
3.0,Not as flowy as it leads you to believe. I ordered my normal size and it clung to my butt and hips and was very tight and unflattering. So maybe size up or perhaps this just isn’t a curvy gal friendly skirt. Returning.
3.0,easily tears
3.0,It ran small and material is thin but it wasn't expensive so I got what I expected minus the size.
3.0,"Good hat, just too large for an average guy."
3.0,"fits good feels stiff and scratchy,rather it be made of rayon instead..."
3.0,"The reviews were hit and miss, I'm am somewhat large 3x'ish and I've been looking for a poncho. As one person started its very thin. For some reason I thought this would have closure or wear more like a cape. There was hardly enough fabric for me to toss the front portion across my shoulder, as I sometimes like to wear my capes or open ponchos. I wouldn't purchase again. I've worn it twice, but it now is tossed in the back seat of my car."
3.0,"Its a creamy coloured top, looks just like the picture, however super cheap material:( feel like its going to make holes after a few washes or if i sit on a wooden bench. had to return!"
3.0,Attractive but more narrow than they look in the picture.
3.0,A little hard to get cards out of
3.0,"Cute shirt ,but did not like polyester material. It firs true to size ;however, to itchy  ! Cotton would have been perfect."
3.0,"The masks will not stay on my face..just falls off.  I have a small head.  My husband also has a rather smaller head than most men, and it is also too loose on his face.  Sent them back."
3.0,"I wanted to write a fair review of this boot. I read the reviews on this boot they are beautiful but they didn't fit me. My ankle is 10 1/2, calf 21, thigh 23. I could not zip them up and they were tight and took a lot to get them of my foot. I  ordered a 9M, but could have order an 11M to be comfortable. I was disappointed but I will keep looking for a boot that fit. Thank you Amazon for the great merchandise."
3.0,Quality is good but runs smaller than the description
3.0,"So I guess I didn't read closely enough when ordering...but when thinking I was ordering the pink &#34;grandma loves me&#34; one, it actually reads &#34;grandma LOVE me&#34;- which really makes no sense so apparently there is no quality control checking these things made in China. Aside from the asinine wording, the sizing of it was what I needed- something to bridge the gap between 3 month clothing and 6 month, so for that it does its job."
3.0,For me these work as something warm to run errands in and look okay for casual wear. Mine are XX wide but fit snugly without socks. Both zippers were stuck closed right out of the box. I put my finger behind the zipper to work it down and will use bar soap to move it easily. The soles are slippery so I will sand them.
3.0,"Not what I was anticipating, it is a silky cotton blend type fabric-not tshirt material.  The stand up neckline bothered me altho it fit well.  Just wasn't what I was anticipating so was disappointed."
3.0,just ok - still hard to use.
3.0,What it's made out of
3.0,"Very cheaply made, but that's what you're paying for at this price. Mine arrived bent at the bridge and one lens was popped out. I was able to bend them back easily since the metal is very soft and the lens popped back with not much trouble.  The reason for the bent frame and popped lens is they come wrapped in a tiny bit of bubble wrap and stuffed into a mall plastic envelope.  Not much protection for a trip all the way from China.  A box would have helped."
3.0,"They look frest on day one, but once you wear them for a little while the ""leather"" starts to crack and peel in the fingertips."
3.0,Material is nice. The shirt or nightshirt is a little tighter then I thought it would be since it was 2xl.
3.0,"This product is very pretty.  Runs very small.  I am a true 12-14 and bought the XL. Length was as expected, fabric is nice. It is made for someone more in the 8-10 size range for an XL"
3.0,I’m not sure why I thought I was getting more of a dry fit material
3.0,Just 3 stars
3.0,"Smaller than you would think in waist and around legs.<br /><br />I wear them, just not what I would have expected"
3.0,Wasn't really big enough.
3.0,"fit somewhat awkwardly, returned"
3.0,"I bought this for my 3 month old, as she's in both 0-3m & 3-6m clothes depending on the brand (about 24"" & 12lbs for context) I pulled it out of the package and had to triple check that I did indeed order a 0-3 because it's HUGE! Definitely looks more like the size of a 6m onesie!<br />The fabric seems nice and thick, but like others have mentioned, the tag is sewn on the outside! Who does that!?"
3.0,The durags are nice and thick. I like the design of the one designer durag they give you. They hold down hair well. I would give it 5 stars if the color didn’t bleed. After wearing one for one day the color started turning a darker shade and leaving marks on my pillow case. The colors on the durag are very cheep and come off. If it were to rain say goodbye to that durags color.
3.0,A little on the smaller side
3.0,Was way bigger than expected. It almost seems like it was a men's size. It's really nice quality though
3.0,This was heavy and does not bend.  When my daughter put it on it cracked. It’s like it was spray painted before bending to fit you head.  Your head is oval shape and this is straight. Would not purchase again. Very disappointed after looking at reviews that raves about it.
3.0,They tarnished very quickly!
3.0,I love funky sunglasses but these were... ugly on. Maybe they're better suited for wider faces but on my petite face they looked comical.
3.0,"Great for in the waist area, but very snug on my thighs. I wear a size 8/9 in pants and usually m/l for sizes. I order a large and very snug. Xl worked much better."
3.0,"I realize that is an odd title for an earring review; however, it is the truth!  The earring wire was too large and would not comfortably go through the holes in my ears.  The earrings were also too heavy for me.  Other than that, the earrings were beautiful.  The stones were very nice as was the finish.  I returned the earrings but I really wish that I could have worn them because they were very pretty and just what I have been looking for."
3.0,"It works, but the downside is that because this is a tank-top, and a compression shirt, after you wear it for hours, the tank-top starts to feel like it's cutting into you.  So I got a T-shirt compression shirt, and that is much more comfortable to wear for long hours."
3.0,The face is bigger than i thought and even so it is still ahrd to read the time against the background. It's still a cute watch though but i doubt i will wear it outside the month of October now that I know the display isn't very clear.
3.0,"This was larger than I expected, but the beading was too flashy looking for what I needed."
3.0,Got a different kind that I like better and it fits better.
3.0,I always wear a size 4.5 in VC shoes but this style seems to run rather snug.  Maybe they'll loosen up once their worn a few times. Overall I love the heel &  cut of bootie.
3.0,"This is not a soft cotton shirt! Would have been perfect, though a bit big, if it was cotton! It  feels like a mostly spandex mix. Not light, breathable, or soft like cotton. the one good thing I can say is, the pattern is pretty."
3.0,"This dress is really cute but being 5’1, the size small was too large in width and length."
3.0,I ordered this in a 2t and the Santa hat was way too small!
3.0,I order these shoes because I need them for an event. When I received the shoes I put them on and they were way taller than I thought. The narrow straps were painful and the wedge is too tall. The shoes are hard to walk in. I liked the flower on the top of the shoe.
3.0,Love the shirt but it fits smaller than expected.
3.0,"Fits really small, Size up for sure! Gives me some serious roll-age around my bra area. It's a lovely bralette other than that, but it's definitely on the small size.<br />If it helps anyone, I'm a plus sized thick girl. I'm 5'7, around 200 pounds but I carry it well. I wear a large and I believe I ordered XL or XXL and it still kinda dug into my skin and everything."
3.0,"OMG!It's so cute on my 7 year old's feet.Soft like bed slippers,very comfortable and warm she says.It appears to be well made.I see no flaws.Very stylish for a little diva.I will be buying others in this brand."
3.0,Ordered this for a present and will have to say this came pretty small to size. Very thin material so good for summer time casual sweater with jeans or shorts but not very warm or good for winter weather. I have seen better quality but i bought it at a reasonable price.
3.0,I went to un button them and the clip detached from the leather. Had to use glue to fix it and ended up taking them off. They do look nice.
3.0,I was very please with how they looked and fit. I wore one for 3 weeks and the stone fell out. I switched it with another and that stone fell out too...these are pretty good for a quick fix but not good for use after a few weeks.
3.0,The leggings are really nice quality. But unfortunately I was only sent two pairs instead of the three.<br />Otherwise I'm happy with my purchase.
3.0,It’s larger than I expected and fits rather boxy. I don’t find it flattering to the female body. I recommend ordering your true size. I ordered up so might account for the fit.
3.0,"Pretty as pictured but unless you have very slim, delicate wrists, don’t bother."
3.0,I have a 7YR old girl and bought a size 8. Was too small for her to be comfortable
3.0,Dress fits as expected but the color isnt what i ordered. Doesnt look coral at all. Looks more like peach
3.0,"I am 5ft 9/148lbs.<br />I like the flow of the dress and the airiness. Perfect for summer. And the finish is good. The only issue I have is in the picture it does not reflect that it is a High low dress, so the front was shorter that I expected. It's okay, just different from I envisioned it would be."
3.0,I really like the necklace but the clasp could be a little bit better.
3.0,"Love the cut of garment and the dark green pipping detail matched with the delicate floral design on fabric. It has a bit polyester-ish feel, & look to it up close, but a nice stretch factor and weight to it."
3.0,"This top is really adorable, but it is very small and I ordered the largest size available. I wish I could make it work for me. The fabric isn’t flimsy and it has a wonderful satiny look and feel to it. This top would be great for the office, as it’s modest enough but with a pop of personality. Unfortunately, it was so tight across my bust when I tried it on that I was afraid it would tear (the fabric is not stretchy). Granted, I was taking a gamble knowing that clothing on Amazon can have variable sizing due to where it’s manufactured. My measurements make it difficult to shop without trying something on first. At 43-30-42 and wearing a 36G bra, my size can range from L to 2XL. I’ll be sad to send this back."
3.0,A bit awkward to get into but overall good
3.0,"Fluffy yes, but gray color is very dull. How will they look after a machine wash???...  Bigger than indicated, 9-10 fit like 11."
3.0,Cute lemon earrings but look close at the picture. I thought they were beaded but are just textured
3.0,I’m actually returning this jacket because the color isn’t what I wanted and the gold zippers make it look cheap.<br />It does fit true to size though and material feels nice
3.0,"Ok, but are small for filling coat pocket."
3.0,"Ok, not as blingy as picture shows."
3.0,"I looked forward to this necklace coming for so long. Its ok but overall I'm disappointed. The rings are so much smaller than they appear on line and the chain is thin & weak and I can tell will turn color in no time. Why do they have to amplify the necklace 5X it's size? Its very misleading. That being said, the tiny rings are cute. May look better on a nicer chain."
3.0,"the material is very cheap looking and is very thin, other than that its very cute"
3.0,"Order at least 2 sizes up, runs small"
3.0,Nice but came to me looking dirty and now can't wear for the wedding :/
3.0,Doesn’t have a good fit at all. Fits like a small not a medium.
3.0,I ordered a large in this and it is definitely too small to wear as a Shackett. I normally wear a medium to large and a top. If you are a large you might want to get it ask our even a two XL if you want this to be a shack it and not a fitted shirt.
3.0,"Not worth $21 dollars, but it will do for a small inexpensive gift. I expected a little more shine and for the stones to be a bit bigger."
3.0,Bought it as a gift but the chain was very cheap and weak.
3.0,Well... Red is actually pink. Other than that it's a mask.
3.0,Material came apart at the seems after only wearing them a few times.
3.0,"button does not stay clasped, with very little in it."
3.0,I love the feel of the dress the most. But it was a bit too small in the chest/bust area. I normally wear a small or medium so I ordered medium. So definitely size up when ordering.
3.0,"I double checked my order, I was to receive 3 pair, paid for 3 pair and only received 1. I like the product perfectly, but wish I had received the full order."
3.0,"Although this headband was nice and wide, the material was pretty thin and felt cheap."
3.0,Don't really stay put if you're very active.
3.0,"Pro it's really light but that's also a con too cause the material it's made of looks super cheap, like a necklace you'd buy for a kid in the toy section. So don't pair it with any outfit that is rich in texture and coloring. I did give it to my niece for her tea parties. It's that type of material. It also kept scratching my skin so i figure it will work best on outfits with material that covers the chest"
3.0,"Very nice look ,but run not true to size ,very tight,"
3.0,I can see how these could be beneficial to someone and stylish at the same time but it just wasn’t for me.  I felt constrained!
3.0,I got this gloves for the cold California night while drive my motorcycle.<br />They are warm and water proof but I can’t use them on my iPhone doesn’t work.<br />If I need to use my phone I need to take the gloves out. I got them manly for that.
3.0,This was a little big. Thought my 16 year old Granddaughter would love this but I was wrong! She hated it!
3.0,Just looks kinda cheap to me. Came in nice packaging and box though.
3.0,"This is very easy to set up and take down. I didn’t take it to the beach yet so I’m unsure of how it holds up there. I will update after I go. I got the medium and it fits my 11yo and 7yo fine with room to spare. It did say it came with windows and mine didn’t.<br />Update: we went to the shore and it worked great even with the winds. The sand bags that are attach are a huge help. After seeing others struggle with their tents, this one was hands down the easiest."
3.0,"A little thinner than I would like them to be, but I wear them with a long top, so all that shows is the knee down.  I wouldn't wear these with any shorter of a top due to being so thin."
3.0,"Not light weight at all, they will smother you, the edges aren’t as described either, mine are all cut and jagged."
3.0,This was a very nice piece of clothing. Fit very well and true to size for me. I was just disappointed in the color as it is more bright red than a darker maroon to wine color. I still used it for what I needed but just an FYI it’s more a bright red.
3.0,Kinda small for the size order up one size
3.0,Had a hole in the pocket.  Other than that good!
3.0,Leaves no space for my hand to hold my battery grip.
3.0,"I'm 5'8, with a small chest and a 36&#34; inch band-size. My build is somewhere between muscular to average. These aren't good for taller ladies, the straps aren't long enough and the cups float above your chest. I'm sure it doesn't help that I have a bigger band-size.<br /><br />Quality seems pretty good for what you pay. If you're shorter than me and/or have a smaller ribcage, I'm sure it would be a great buy."
3.0,I was surprised at the print design when I got it.  REALLY loud.
3.0,"The shirt looks very nice, and fits well.  BUT, if you are a priest, good luck attaching the collar without at least one assistant...needs FOUR HANDS to pull it off."
3.0,"I'm 5'7 and 150lbs and I usually order a medium for skirts but since it was coming from Shein, I decided to size up and turns out that I should've stuck to a medium. The waist ended up being too big for me and I have to clip it every time I wear it. Also the fabric isn't the best because its pretty thin however I like the design and since it was only $10, I can't really complain.<br />Let me know if you have any questions or click the ‘Helpful’ button if you found this review to be helpful 😊"
3.0,It fits really weird.
3.0,"By far the best part of this shirt is the fabric it is made from.  It is a light, breathable fabric that is very soft on the skin.  While Henley shirts are usually made from cotton I really enjoyed this fabric.  However there are some issues with the shirt’s design.  Most noticeable are the number of buttons.  Henley shirts typically have 3 to 4 buttons on the front.  This one comes with 7 which causes the shirt to bunch up around the chest if you wear it half open like you should.<br /><br />The other issue I had was when choosing a size.  The size chart is very helpful but the shirt I received was a bit larger, and baggier for a medium.  So if you are in doubt go with a smaller size as they run larger.<br />However it doesn’t look that bad, still a nice shirt I will wear for sure."
3.0,Only one side  color
3.0,These are super cute but tarnish easily.  Not made for a very active lifestyle.
3.0,"Good product, just too small."
3.0,Short on fabric.
3.0,IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE.<br /><br />BUT IT BROKE.<br /><br />SK PHL
3.0,"Not a bad belt.  Does its job, but you can tell the quality is lacking.  Still looks good after wearing off and on for a few months."
3.0,"Pretty cheap quality-wise for Tommy Bahama, but ok - frame feels like it would break easy, and although the plastic lenses look nice at first i think they will scratch easily. These were so cheap that I was (and still am) concerned that they aren't genuine but dont know how to tell. The tint is not dark enough for me, but that's more of a personal preference i guess."
3.0,Not bad. Definitely a much cheaper copy (plastic lenses - glass in the name brand) but they fit and look almost exactly like the name brand version. I use this as a spare set.
3.0,Purchased for my wife for Valentine's day.  She loves the pants.  She did complain the shirt was a little tight.
3.0,I wanted to like these but the reviews were right. Theyre hard to put on considering its a top . And they make your boobs look odd if youre not in shape. The support is overall there . Good for workouts and better than bras if youre just running errands.
3.0,The large was for someone that fits in the category of Big&Tall
3.0,"The chain in the description, snake chain, is NOT the chain that came w/ the charm!! If I didn't need the necklace for a gift that night , I would have returned it."
3.0,"Dress looks beautiful in general. The fabric has a nice weight and the purple/gray colors are vibrant.  While it fit, the style didn't suit me. The waist is too high making my torso look short and wide.  The skirt flares out which also didn't make for a great look for me. Sadly, returned it."
3.0,"It’s very cute in person, runs a tad big - but the problem for me is the arm holes. They’re so large I had to wear a shirt under it, otherwise my boob would be showing from the side."
3.0,"I really liked the fit of this sweater; very casual and slouchy. Pairs very well with a pair of leggings and boots. Unfortunately, it is pretty thin and therefore not really suitable for winter, as the bulky neckline makes it difficult to layer. The yarn leaves much to be desired. Love the look but would have gladly paid a higher price for better material. I am 5'6&#34; and typically wear a size 6/8 in dresses."
3.0,was a little too tight when installed. hoping they stretch
3.0,The staps keep falling off my shoulder no matter how tight I adjust them.
3.0,Necklace is pretty but the pink diamond is a bit large for my liking. I have been wearing it for a week with no discoloration so far and I actually noticed that the back was nice enough to wear backwards without anyone ever knowing! So I was able to still be able to wear the necklace although I doubt I’d wear it with the pink diamond showing. I am sure it wasn’t meant to be reversible but I just thought I’d share in case someone wanted to do the same.
3.0,"Perfect hat for the range or anywhere you use over ear protection to keep the flaps down.  Otherwise, the material flaps in the wind and does not cover ears and neck properly.  Like the larger bill, but if purchasing for the ear and neck protection be warned material is too light and the slightest breeze will make it a moot point."
3.0,The jersey came fast and I loved it. The only issue was the soccer ball on the front the paint was smeared. Everything else looked fantastic. I'm a little worried to wash it that the other paint may do the same.
3.0,Cute look but seems somewhat cheaply made and fit more like a crop top than a jacket. No pockets also which was a bummer and sleeves were a little short. Ended up returning.
3.0,I love the color but it's not very good quality. The material pulls apart very easily and I'm sure there will be holes in it shortly. I bought this to wear often and I won't be wear it much to try to keep it intact.
3.0,Collar of shirt is really large and loose and rather on the shorter size not a well made tshirt.
3.0,"Runs a bit big. Hoodie seemed okay quality. Hood was gigantic. Draw strings on the hood are equally gigantic.  Material seemed as though it would keep you warm, but is kind of stiff, like it had been coated with starch. Returned and picked up a grey hoodie at H&M that looks and feels better for the same price."
3.0,Pretty but it broke 😢
3.0,"They are so tiny! Smaller then a penny.  These are not made for someone overweight, like me. It fits snug.  Looks bad on. I showed my husband the ad, then the actual earring, he was surprised too. I would say these earrings are for very young.  I checked the size, and it says 15mm.  Means nothing to me. I should have asked my Alexa what that is in inches. 0.59 inches."
3.0,Cute but very little support
3.0,"Cute, but cheaply made.  The sequence are tiny and tend to fall off. You get what you pay for.  From far, FAR away, it looks nice!  I will keep to putter around the house."
3.0,I like the design good for everday wear
3.0,I originally purchased my usual size (a large) and returned for an XL bc I wanted a baggier fit. I ended up returning because the neck would not sit right with buttoned up or open. The piping material also irritated my neck so I knew it would be annoying to wear. The clasps also didn’t open or close easily. Sad because it is a cute design and I really liked the blue color. It also shed a ton right out of the package so I was worried how it would go through the wash.
3.0,I did like that I was delivered but kind of cheap.
3.0,"Not what expected, looks cheap."
3.0,"Bought these for my Mom as she lost the backing to her screw type post. They work okay on a screw type (their claim is that they work on screw type) but not as well as we had hoped.  Mom had difficulty putting them on and off.  I think would work better for younger fingers and for regular post types.  For our needs, not so great but I think for regular posts, these would be great!"
3.0,"I love the lightweight material, however the size chart is not accurate. My hips are a 46’ and waist is a 35’. Based on the chart, I would wear a XXL, however I could put 2 of me in the pants. My size would have been the med or large."
3.0,"Suit is comfortable and fits as expected, but the fingers are freakishly long. They hang off my fingertips to about 2-3 inches long. Otherwise the suit is fine, if nit a little loose around the waist."
3.0,"Received the wrong dress, but the size was good"
3.0,Nice suit just too small
3.0,IT WAS GOOD QUALITY JUST SMALL
3.0,I love the dress and it fits great but it is too short
3.0,"This is a cute crocheted vest that I wanted to add contrast to my sundresses. It's a one size item but does run on the smaller side and doesn't have any give or stretch.  Considering I got as an accessory and not for coverage or warmth it serves its purpose. I typically wear L/XL and the shoulder span on this is a bit short or narrow. Otherwise, it is made well, lightweight and very cute. I'm giving it 3 stars not for lack of quality but for sizing expectation."
3.0,Cute but definitely not for a child.
3.0,Cute and well made but I don’t get where they can claim the amount of storage the offer. Not worth the money for sure.
3.0,"Ordered as a gift for my mom. The first necklace she received was broken. UPS picked it up at my mom's residence and returned it at no cost.. The second necklace was fine. I haven't seen it yet, but my mom liked that it has a variety of colors which she can wear with my different tops."
3.0,"As a matter of fact, it is so lightweight, you can see through it.  It is much more so than it looks in the picture.  I also hope it has some room for growth for my granddaughter, who is 8.  I believe I ordered the Large size, which says Girls 9/10, but I can't find that on my order details anywhere, and the tag is Chinese size.  It says it's no longer available in the black color, but that color is variegated with dark grey.  It was accurate in the stated shipping time.  It took 25 days to come, 20 days after it left China, evidently by ship.  Unless my granddaughter falls in love with it, or says it's nice and warm, I am sending it back, also by ship, I guess, hopefully without a charge.  Oh, I hope the return window hasn't expired, I will have to look.....I may update this review, as I'm not sure if 4 stars is accurate if this doesn't resolve well.<br />Update:  My granddaughter liked it, so we will be keeping it.  It fits her, but dunno how much room to grow there is.  She says it's not super warm.<br />It says above this review that my order was a Small size and red color, but it was black and XL, which is no longer available.  I saw a sweater identical to it at a local big box store the other day for $5 less, so I would rate it about 3.5 instead of 4 stars."
3.0,Would prefer to be ableto pick one color.
3.0,The band is very nice but was looking for something for versatile.
3.0,"The legs and all fit well but the waist is slightly snug. This is fine but the main snap holding then closed is weak, not as advertised, and keeps popping open. I otherwise love the pants, the material is light, strong, breathable, and seems to even repel water and dirt. I use them for work and they're perfect!"
3.0,"it was too big , but good quality none the less"
3.0,Built well and sturdy.  I had hoped that the nylon was a thicker and more sturdy for hard use while at work.  But it's holding up better than expected
3.0,Don’t get it wet!! It turns pink and leaves green around your neck :( But other than that I really like it!!
3.0,"Earrings are elegant and pretty. The stones are not real and reel ,its a plastic stones.so it has less shining ."
3.0,Good product but short in length
3.0,"El reloj luce bastante similar al ilustrado.  Me gusta utilizar el reloj y me agrada como se ve en la muñeca,  pero hubiera deseado que los numeros y letras en la pantalla fuesen mas brillantes para facilitar la lectura.  la iluminacion no es muy buena."
3.0,"They are super comfortable and very soft.<br />However, I ordered the Mustard Gold and they came out bright orange. It makes me feel like an inmate.<br /><br />Definitely returning. I would exchange for a different color but I am not taking that risk again."
3.0,Product not well made.  Starting to come apart after 2 weeks of wearing
3.0,"These did the trick but the straps are very widely placed and constantly slip off my shoulders, and I am a very broad shouldered woman!  They are very soft and comfortable, and it was super easy to unhook with one hand. They are so soft that you could likely use it as a sleep bra as well.  It would be an excellent bra if the straps weren't so widely spaced in the back."
3.0,"I loved the way it looked but I had to constantly take it off with work, dishes, pulling my hair and it would Always pinch my skin hella cute but ouch"
3.0,The turkeys are way to heavy
3.0,"Surprisingly these shoes run at least two sizes small. I purchased my normal size and was astonished by how far they were from fitting correctly. I believe that my feet are true to size. I re-ordered two sizes up to get a correct fit.<br /><br />I have excellent results from brands such as Donald J. Pliner, Stuart Weitzman, Bolo, Born and Joy Chen. Given the story of how this brand was developed I was particularly puzzled by the ill-fit.<br /><br />Upon return I was charged a 15% restocking fee because Amazon considers fit the consumer's responsibility. The shoes were on sale at clearance ($104) which made the cost of return shipping and the restocking fee somewhat less painful.<br /><br />The second disappointment is the quality. I was stunned by the lack of quality in the construction at the original retail. Had I paid retail I would have been exceedingly disappointed with the quality (unmatched seams, gaps, materials used). I am not sure that even at $104 the quality is appropriate to the price.<br /><br />Although I would like to support this brand due to the story behind its development I cannot do so."
3.0,"Best word to describe these is ODD. The fit is odd. Waist line is a bit snug. The coverage area of the bum is excessive. The cotton part of the product bunches up like a wad of diaper. Straight-up wedgie guarantee. So truly odd. One plus is there is no hem at the leg, so you don’t really see them. However, for me, the fit is too bizarre for these to be yoga underwear gold."
3.0,Really simple product and it looks great! I wish it had some extra links though.
3.0,"Headline says it all. It's a super cute top, but it is UNBELIEVABLY thin. In the picture I'm wearing a grey sports bra under it and you can completely see the outline of the bra. I planned to use this top just for exercising/wearing with athletic wear so it's ok, but should really be thicker :/"
3.0,It's good but it's not shine as its in the site
3.0,"I really like the fabric. It is soft and absorbent. but the cut is uneven, longer on one side than the other. They are also too long. I had to cut them to length and hand sew the cut edges. They twist up in the wash so plan on rolling them in a towel, then  air dry flat."
3.0,"It's nearly impossible to find replacement bands for my Samsung Gear Fit 2.  It's frustrating that this is the best choice. I've had a difficult time getting the straps to latch properly.  I actually had to superglue one side of the band to the display. In addition to that problem, it will not stay snapped. I have to ""duct tape"" every day so I don't unknowingly lose the entire Gear.  How hard can it be to make a decent replacement band? I suspect Samsung just wants us to purchase an entire new Gear Fit.  The only reason I give it 3 Stars rather than 2 or 1, is that the frustrating bands are still better than being forced to buy a new GearFit."
3.0,"Fit is too small, quality is okay."
3.0,"Love this! Only thing it's just not the greatest material for rain, it absorbs water just like a cotton shirt. So if you want something protective don't get this. But cute so I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,Came alot faster then it said it would. It inexpensive so it is made cheap. The charms fell off pretty fast. Good for one time use
3.0,slides off the heels a lot.
3.0,I need change for extra large. The large is small for me.
3.0,Vary small on a guys septum would be better for in the ears or nostrals
3.0,"After 3 months of use the outer ring keeps slipping off the inner ring and is no longer concentric. This doesn't let the keys fall off, but does allow for more snagging, which is fraying my lanyard. Keys are easier to take off than a traditional key ring."
3.0,"Won’t tell a lie, beautiful dress."
3.0,This has no stretch at all to even get over your head. Loved the look but couldn’t even get the dress over my head. The neck part is tight
3.0,Material in chest area is thin.
3.0,"I really expected this to be a thicker half-hard wire. It's very hard to know what you are going to receive. I was hoping to make some jump rings, but I'll use this for wire wrapping. I'll try to put a photo up of a completed project. I might add, this was not the sellers fault, it's mine for not knowing my sizing."
3.0,"I pretty consistently wear a 36C. For some reason, this just fits kind of weird. It's snug on my breats, but kind of loose around your rips. It also rides up a little. It makes the girls look great, but it's not my favorite to jog in. It kind of rises up while you're jogging. You don't necessarily need to pull it down, but it doesnt feel right. Perfect if you aren't actually doing anything and don't feel like wearing a regular bra."
3.0,The material look little cheap but it's ok the lights work really good.
3.0,I wear my watch every day and take it off at night.  This band lasted me almost exactly 1 year
3.0,"They'll be fun, but it's difficult to click the lights....."
3.0,I ordered the medium and it was really big.
3.0,"They are all I wanted,  cheap slippers."
3.0,"The symbol was larger than I expected and the cheapness of this necklace probably would not have been recognized except the chain is made out of inexpensive, brasslike material.  I threw it away immediately.  Also, be prepared to not have it delivered for quite a while.  I believe it comes from China."
3.0,White material is very see-through
3.0,The overlap of the opening cut in the back opens nearly to the shoulder vs. low back and the material is more sheer than pictured.  This allows the back to open up more than desired; however a quick stitch mid-back would help.
3.0,NICe look but cheaply made
3.0,they have a tendency to fall out and not fit right in my ear. I still wear them because I think they are cute as hell but disappointed on the fit.
3.0,"Can't wear them. Child sized. Gave them to my 9 yr old. Size aside, they seem cool. I'd be glad to wear them if I could."
3.0,This was much longer than expected. I'm 5'5 and it was nearly to my ankles. Had to return it.
3.0,Shorts are long enough for a teenager
3.0,Was surprised after having bought so many VB bags in the past this one looked sort of well let's say not up to their standards. The strap is too short for me  I can only wear it in warmer weather without coat in order for it to over my shoulder.  But other than that it's ok. Locks zippers all work not as roomy as I thought but has several well placed pockets.  Sorry best I can say about it.
3.0,Longer and tighter at the bottom than expected
3.0,I'm a big and tall so I needed a 4XL or 5xL<br />But needed the sweatshirt so had to go with the biggest size you had which was a 3xL
3.0,"I really love this ring, it's so pretty.  And I like that it came in a small size. The reason I'm giving 3 starts is that I only wore it twice so far and a stone already fell out of it :(.  So sad!  It doesn't look as nice now.  Thinking of seeing if the seller will replace it..."
3.0,I think i ordered wrong size so i returned
3.0,I like it! it fits and it is just like the picture.
3.0,Ordered the same on in a different color. It fit great. This one was listed as the same size and was way to big.
3.0,"I actually really like this however it runs very small in bust area so be aware of that when ordering.  Also it is long, I am 5ft 3 and it drags the floor"
3.0,"This dress would’ve been 5 stars if my chest wasn’t squeezed to death while wearing it. It’s unique, triangular shape on the chest area isn’t appealing for someone with my chest size (38DD)."
3.0,"A little small, worth the price"
3.0,Quality is decent. Price is good. But 2 of the three are very short in length.
3.0,"I got this thinking I would use it as outwear for winter, but the material is so thin that it doesn't work for keeping you warm, this is more a blazer than a coat. Returned it immediately because it was not fulfilling my purchase purpose."
3.0,Metal bends easily
3.0,NOT TAYLORED EVENLY
3.0,"I love the skirt. It is so pretty. The top, however, is very short and very tight. I will not be wearing it with the skirt, sadly."
3.0,"Cheap material, not soft, kinda thin fit as expected for the price. looks like the photo has no belt loops for the belt but can fit big-chested women."
3.0,"Very stylish, but the design makes it difficult to read at a glance. Also, the band is cheap quality - after wearing it for 9 months, the band strap loop broke, so at that point I decided to replace the watch with one equally stylish and affordable but more legible."
3.0,It was OK- runs pretty big so I didn't keep it.  But it does look nice.  I gave it to someone else and they like it a lot!
3.0,"This top's description says it's gray, but it definitely is NOT GRAY!. I was expecting white stripes and gray stripes through the whole shirt. The only gray stripes are the small ones on the pocket and sleeves. The main part of the shirt is a pale blue and a dusty blue. It is a cute top and good quality material. The fit is a little tighter than most tops I have of this same size."
3.0,"Warm and water resistant. Haven't taken them through a deep puddle yet, but fine in deep slush and snow. Warm. Not comfortable for long walks, no arch support."
3.0,The brim's wiring is very dramatic in it's waves and the hat's circle is too small. The wire in the point also needs to be adjusted constantly. But it's not too bad.
3.0,I ordered the smallest size but it still looks bulky around the hips.
3.0,"I like it but I think I have to return it. Doesn't fit right.<br />Too long, also too long in the torso. I'm 5'6.<br />Very clingy.  The straps go much lower than I expected. To my thighs.  I don't feel confident that exchanging it for a medium will help."
3.0,"Guess I should have paid a little more attention, these are to small and barely reach my ears, seems very fragile. I guess I got what I paid for."
3.0,"This was a tad more uncomfortably shorter than I had hoped. I'm 5' 2&#34;with an extremely short to non existant torso. I bought it for a wedding. I wore it but felt like I had to keep an eye on the hemline the entire day. Wear a half slip /coulotte slip when wearing. As mentioned, I'm short, and have no neckline either, the neck band kept getting twisted. Use starch if you have a body type like mine. There are fixes for things like this but one has to do their research to find them. I would not buy this dress again."
3.0,Beautiful color graphics as shown. However material is paper thin.
3.0,My husband loves these but the sizing was a little on the small size.
3.0,The pattern is cute but returned as the front armhole left me spilling out.  Perhaps a smaller size??
3.0,"Ordered big, still small.  Very thin, even with something worn underneath."
3.0,The color is beautiful and its on the thin side. But what I noticed is when I wore it as the day went by it got stretched out and got looser over the day.
3.0,"If you get white, it is very see through. I would not recommend for girls with big titties."
3.0,"I've been wearing nothing but Gloria Vanderbilt pants size 12 for years.  these shorts run bigger.  And, unfortunately, I know I haven't lost any weight."
3.0,"I knew the coloring was odd, but I didn't expect to get ""Bea Arthur in a half mask before she went grey"" vibes. I'm caught between mild dislike and being weirded out by it. The pin itself is well made & it has two backings (mismatched on mine lol, don't give a hoot abt that), and it's the perfect size. I'm gonna sit on it a few days & do one of three things: return it, leave it & forget I own it, or repaint it (pretty sure it's the ""shading"" that's throwing me off). Need to sleep on it."
3.0,Beautiful necklace but cheaper quality. Wore it once and I'm too afraid it'll break if I wear it again.
3.0,"The choker is good quality and has a pretty star charm. However, I chose the charm because of the photo used to advertise the product. The photo (which is no longer listed) showed a star with multi-color small crystals within a star. I felt the multi colors would match with many outfits. What arrived is a blue star that is enamel and not small crystal stones. Because I planned to wear the choker for an upcoming event, I will keep the product, but I am disappointed it was not what I expected."
3.0,"Need a pair of readers to see the detail. The snowman is top heavy so he'll always be upside down. Too bad, he's darling in the photo."
3.0,Very cute! Definitely size up if you have a bigger chest.
3.0,"these are okay. however, the waist was to small and the legs are about 6-8&#34; to long. These were made foe a very skinny and 6'+ person."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to receiving these hats; however I received 2 of the same camo hats rather than the darker, light & khaki. No fun!"
3.0,"Ok look, cheap quality. Wouldn't buy another one."
3.0,My daughter loves them but the day she wore them the lace holder came out. Hopeful the next pair I buy will not have this issue. Returning them abs buying again.
3.0,"Nothing to special about this. I am not overly happy with this, yet I am not disappointed. It works for what I need it for."
3.0,This outfit is a nice soft material and comfy.  Downside is the shorts are not like fitted biker shorts. They are more straight loose leg shorts. But they do have a nice wide waist band. Shirt is nice length and fits very well. I actually could have gone down a size.
3.0,"A good light weight summer pant, but I should have gotten the next size down"
3.0,"It's a little smaller than I'd envisioned, and therefore hard to share the inscription"
3.0,CUTE BUT VERY TIGHT AROUND WAIST
3.0,Size up it runs small other than that it’s super cute
3.0,"This sweater is so soft and comfortable feeling, but runs incredibly small. I usually wear a Large and the XXL was too tight."
3.0,I was wondering why they were so big. They sent the wrong size. Stitching at the sides do not look like theyll hold up for a while. You get what you pay for. They are cute slippers
3.0,Masks were nice but the ear bands were short for most adults.  The probably would be better for kids or a smaller adult.
3.0,"I guess I was expecting more, not sure what though. Just makes oncoming headlights yellow. They do cut some glare just not as much as I’d hoped."
3.0,"This was my first tokidoki purchase - just loved the design.  I've since bought a few other shirts & heard about fakes & I think this might be one - if it's not, then it's def very different than their usual quality.  The material is super-thin & the size is crazy-loose.  Still, I really do like the design (only reason for the stars), so I'll pair it with a cami or repurpose it for a patch skirt or something."
3.0,My husband wasn’t crazy about the color of the buckle and it didn’t look like leather.
3.0,"Was not happy with these insoles. They have a weird midline bulge anterior to the plantar arch. Not a bad thing, but it's just not my cup of tea"
3.0,The extra large gloves are not true to size I feel.  My husband can hardly get his hands in the gloves.  The style is nice.
3.0,Made for younger girls. Doesn't really glow.
3.0,Its fine. fits weirdly loose and large.
3.0,This dress makes you look twice your size and is a bit constricting at the bottom. It's like batwing style for the hips. I'll keep it but not getting anymore.
3.0,Fits as expected. Comfortable. Not bad for a 3 pack just wish they were stretchy other than that they are perfect for any casual day look.
3.0,Not bad but not great either. They matched our outfit for her first photos so you cant tell the quality isn't that great but wouldn't buy again.
3.0,Not the greatest quality but I really didn't expect much for the price.  Hopefully it continues to work for a while.
3.0,"Simple cheap sunglasses.  The sunglasses come in a white box, in this white box they come in a simple plastic bag, wrapped in white packing tissue.  They come with NO case or polishing cloth.  I ordered the gold/ yellow lenses.  What I received was nothing like the image in the description.  The color is more of a rose with a hint if something golden, not even rose-gold.  They are also HUGE.  So be mindful if you’re looking for this style or not. They came with a significant scratch that obstructed my preferential vision.  Will be returning."
3.0,"It's super easy to read, I don't regret my purchase."
3.0,"Lol I look like a nun it was so funny,  because my husband got it for me and I think that was the idea ...maybe was too big I’m not sure I’m a between small and medium, he got a medium. we didn’t like it. 😆"
3.0,Did not care for the quality of the sweater and it was way to big. Gave it away
3.0,Good but only for a visual aide.
3.0,Did not hang as low as photo shows and looks kind of dorky. It is comfy and sleeves are plenty long.
3.0,"if you have thick black hair, like 4c, especially braids, this hat is not for you.<br /><br />it's pretty though, but it won't fit.<br /><br />I will admit, I gotta big brain. and My braids don't help when it comes to hats. I thought I could adjust it in the back, but that didn't go well.<br /> It's hard to make bigger.<br /><br />I'll give it away because I don't feel like returning it."
3.0,"didn't block much sun, but looks cool. fashion sunglass fo' sho'."
3.0,"I’ve worn this once, it looked cuter on the model for sure. I like it but I’m not in love with it. Fits as expected."
3.0,"love the dress but a button came right off just trying it on.  easy fix but a little bit disenchanted, however, not enough to return it."
3.0,"I like it, it can secure my money"
3.0,"Like the dress, read many reviews on sizing before I ordered a med (usual dress size) and it's just a bit to big. Wanted it to hug me but it hangs free, might order a small"
3.0,Definitely don't worry about this running too tight. I'm an L but usually order an XL to be safe since I don't mind if the item is a bit baggy. I wish I ordered this in either an L or even a Medium!
3.0,Good quality. But a bit too large for me.
3.0,The sole came off the first week my son wore it to school.
3.0,Runs really small and I had to get another size.
3.0,The leggings stained my couch and skin. I didn't wash them prior to wearing them but even when I washed them they were still staining my skin.<br />They feel very comfy overall. I wish I would've sized down because they feel a tad big. I'm between 14W/Regular 16.
3.0,Fit is small and tight. They look nice but I don't ever wear them because they're too tight for my head.
3.0,Loved the shirt but the buttons on the side feel off the first time it was worn.
3.0,"I'm pear shaped so, while the top was fine, the pants was too small. Not the best for a curvy girl even though I followed the size chart."
3.0,Tight fit ... ordered extra large still tight fit
3.0,"Pretty color, but runs too big, if had x small might of worked. Tried to love but was too baggy.  I'm 5 3 and 135 and too big.  If bigger might work for you"
3.0,Child likes it
3.0,It fits good but the slit in the back is too long and too high.
3.0,"The leather is odd, like some kind is hard sponge, and the dye stains your skin. I soaked mine in water for an hour to try to bleed out the stain - it seems to have done the trick."
3.0,Does anybody know how to set the time and date on this Watch? The instructions that came with the watch are not right.
3.0,Have been great bands have been wearing them for about a month and some fraying has appeared and often have to tighten it up through out the day.
3.0,"I didn't look closely enough to see this isn't one of the Hallmark Christmas Movie watching shirts, but that's okay because I also enjoy Lifetime and Netflix Christmas movies. I like my shirts to fit loose, so I buy X-Large. This one shrunk a bit after washing, which I did before wearing. It's not as comfortable as it could be, but at least it didn't shrink two sizes."
3.0,"I ordered these before and they were perfect. I loved them. I reordered the exact same ones and the were really tight. I know my others didn’t stretch cause I had one color from the first order that I hated and never wore. I tried it just to be sure and yes, the sizing had changed. Very dissapointed."
3.0,"The chest area of the top looks different as pictured, but maybe it's because I'm not as busty as the model. Overall I'd say it is okay and comfortable enough to keep."
3.0,The fabric is wonderful but the fit for a small is more like a large or extra large making them a little uncomfortable.
3.0,"I had to return these. I am 5'9"" and they were too short. I struggle to find pants that fir and are long enough. Many reviews said these were long but I didn't find that to be true. The fit was amazing and I would have loved them had they been long enough"
3.0,"They are a little too hard to work with, they can ruin your equipment"
3.0,"I had bought the gloves as a gift from a friend and he brings it with him everywhere, a week after I gave him the gift the paint started to come off and one of the gloves had broke off it."
3.0,"I have been buying the PUMA socks for years, they were the best socks.  Please tell me what has happened to them?  After the first washing, they shrunk so badly that we cannot wear the socks.  I have to give them away."
3.0,"I wouldn't really consider this Fit Overs. They are small and don't fully cover some eye glasses. I do wear them without my glasses. But they are not little girl glasses per day, do they can be enjoyed"
3.0,"Elastic around waist is wicked tight!! And there isn’t much elasticity in the leg room area, like it makes it hard to spread legs apart. But I still wear this skirt because it’s cute. I am 5’7” and the skirt reaches the floor! Material feels thin and a bit cheaply made. It can be worn as a skirt or as a dress with a belt to accentuate the hips. I get compliments on this pretty skirt all the time."
3.0,its a bit snug
3.0,"A little small, but it's OK"
3.0,"I bought two of these during the holiday sale.  The colors are nice, the garment looks just like the pic, however, the material is the hottest (temp) thing I've ever had on my body.  I imagine it's similar to being wrapped in foil.  This would be good for a cooler climate, like Alaska."
3.0,"I like to have this for a gift to my sister, But so sad The discount code it didnt work :(  Looks very nice."
3.0,"First of all these gloves are not waterproof as advertised, I would consider them water resistant.  I was outside in winter mix, and rain and they worked great for that, but as the palm got wet, I could feel a little leakage in the fingers.  The heating element is decent, my hands never got cold on the highest heat setting in 32 degree weather, but if you are expecting to feel the warming, that is not going to happen, but it kept my hands what felt like normal temp and bearable.  Dexterity I would say is also decent, not big and bulky like most winter gloves.  I expected a little better for the price."
3.0,"Over the Summer I like wearing flip flops, much like everyone else, so having a spare pair in hand was my goal with these. On the sandals are bumps that are supposed to be for a massaging effect, but for myself, these honestly were not comfortable at all, they hurt my feet. While these sandals are pretty thick, they are on the cheaper side, Around my sandals there were little plastic pieces just hanging off :(  Overall though, I will use these around my house when needed to do outdoor work for a short period of time, but these are not for long term use to me. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"
3.0,It is a lot bigger than I expected. I bought it for my Tragus piercing and there was no way it would fit. But it is a very pretty earring
3.0,I bought this to carry a drink when running errands.  The bottle holder is too small to be useful.  Other than that it's a nice bag.  Why put a bottle holder that's too small to use?
3.0,Was nicer than expected
3.0,these fit in almost every aspect except length. far too short!
3.0,It was too small for my boyfriends wrist.
3.0,Just ok nike dri fit tops super thin and run big size down forsure.
3.0,Looks logo
3.0,Able to use the product but the item received had holes on one of the finger and the inner lining cloth too.
3.0,"Very cute, nicely made and flowy.  But it's extremely short, it comes down to about 2 inches above my navel.  Also, this top is sized for women who can fit into small/medium sizes only."
3.0,I love these house shoes but there are 2 drawbacks for me.<br />1) The piping around the edge of the top gets between my foot & the shoe & is uncomfortable to walk on. Either the shoe should be a bit wider or the piping shouldn't be there. I suggest ordering one size up.<br />2) They don't last long. I only wear flip-flop style house shoes during warm weather. I generally get 2 summers of use from my house shoes. But the fabric on these began to come loose at the seams & also got threadbare fairly quick. I won't be re-ordering these.<br />The only upside (for me) is that the indoor-outdoor soles are comfortable & they're still in great condition considering the poor condition of the fabric part of the shoe.
3.0,"Great top I just wish I listened to the reviews about it being too large. Its larger then expected going by the sizing chart,  I did go a size smaller then the chart because XL just sounded ridiculous to me but large was too big also, it's not extremely big but a medium would of been perfect. I'm 5'8 36D 155 lbs"
3.0,"It seems like a nice jacket, but I ordered an XXL and I can barely get it zipped.  I've actually lost a bunch of weight recently and all my other XXL sized clothing fits fairly loosely on me.  The bottom of the jacket doesn't have any stretch to it either."
3.0,They are fun for a day they come with at least 1/3 broken n the batteries are extremely difficult to change n its not worth taking apart unless u like assembling complicated gadgets
3.0,Don't like these as well as the expensive kind. Light comes through the sides
3.0,"Sorry to say, they did not work for me. I can see where it will help others, I just couldn't get it to work as easily as described. I'm not talking bad about the product. It does have something to do with me. Like the nose, couldn't get it to fit. My nose has been broken and they didn't sit right. I know this little of a thing can effect vision effectiveness. It's always worth a try, you can send them back. I would not try these just because of my review. I know many people that told me these worked for them, reason being for me buying them in the first place."
3.0,Its really cute and I love the cut and fit of it but its a little small and the fabric is a little see through.
3.0,Had to buy in XL - usually a medium in most brands.  Cute back.  Did not match same color name in tank top which was a little disappointing.  Will keep though.
3.0,"Beautiful Jacket! arrived too small,, probably mislabeled......<br /> Will keep it to give it to a friend"
3.0,Material is very cheap.  Not a sweater but color and shape of it is as shown.
3.0,"This bag is very small. I really liked the quality and the look of the product but just too small for my needs. I wanted to be able to carry my small wallet and my sunglasses in case along with my iphone. Just too small. There is a small zippered pocket on back of purse, zippered flap, and another small zippered pocket inside but...the  items inside the main compartment of the purse would not be completely secure as there is no zipper on it. Only the small dab of velcro to hold the flap in place. But it is a well made purse out of a nice thick quality canvas fabric. The olive green looked just like it does on line. I liked the look of it alot. Just too small for my needs."
3.0,The metal is a pretty rose gold but the bigger bar has a flaw in the insert. Almost looks cracked. Still wearable as long as no one looks at it too closely.
3.0,"This jacket is beautiful, but they run a bit small, order it a bit larger then you think you will need."
3.0,I dont know what it is about the material of these scarves but they slide right off our heads.
3.0,i just received these sandals today and i did not get them in a little santiro bag. They also don't have the santiro  embellishment on the bottom of the shoe. Are they fake?? also when i ordered them i usually wear a size 8-8.5 so i got a 9 and they BARELY fit my feet. there's definitely an extra inch and a half behind my heel.
3.0,"These are comfy and fit true to size. They do stretch out with long term use, but for the price you can just buy more as needed. They do the trick!"
3.0,It looks exactly as advertised and came with the little case which was a bonus as it's really protective and responsive at the same time but the elastic is so tight that the watch leaves imprints on my wrist. I have small wrists and it still hurts pretty badly. I'm working on stretching it out and hopefully i don't break it. I have to take it off to take a break from time to time.
3.0,Bought this for my 7 year old. He wore it twice and the seem on the left side gave out. Seems poorly made
3.0,I've purchased this before and it was perfect.  This time it was much larger than expected and tarnished.  The previous one was the right size and looked great.
3.0,The sleeves are too tight on my arms and I was expecting a cotton blend fabric.  It's polyester and not stretchy or breathable.  It's super cute otherwise  so apple shapes with thin arms will love it.
3.0,"The sunglasses fit decently, but I was unaware they are plastic yellow instead of gold wire and quite cheap looking."
3.0,Too small. Should've gotten a size bigger although the chart appears to match normal sizes. The dress was nice
3.0,"Seller is fine, no problem in delivery, even came earlier then said.<br /><br />It looks nice, but the quality is as it can, Its not a German or Swiss made.<br />Light material and bad winding spring. It stops working after 6 hours if you will not use while sleeping."
3.0,I would get a larger size if I were to purchase another.
3.0,"Bathing suit was cute but bottom was like a thong on me. I am 5’8, 130,  size 2-4 and ordered a large. Will be returning, not enough coverage!"
3.0,Fits good.  Thank you.
3.0,a wee bit big but wearing it for laps in a public pool working just sfine its exercise not looking to make a fashion statement
3.0,"RECEIVED ORDER JUST AS I THOUGHT, BUT WISHED IT HAD SOME USE HINTS....HAVEN'Y USED YET  WE WILL SEE"
3.0,"If you embrace the idea that a belt holds up you pants, rather than screaming ""Hey look at my fancy belt!""<br />this will suit you.  It's sturdy, simple and infinitely adjustable.  I didn't like the fact that the photo of the navy blue belt seemed to have a blue buckle, the belt arrived and the buckle is black.  Not a deal breaker, but I picked this one because of the blue buckle.  It's tempting to spend more and get 5 of these, but I already have 3 and I don't want this to be my signature look, it just want it to quietly hold my pants upl"
3.0,"This is an adorable Koala outfit, but it was supposed to be size 3 - 6 months, and it's HUGE!"
3.0,didn't fit me as I hoped showed my side boob too much
3.0,Decent. Their ok for the price but mine have already started ripping around the waistline after as couple months. Their comfy though
3.0,"One of my 8 year old daughters picked this out for her school backpack this year (3rd grade). It is very cute. The zipper pull on it broke off within the 1st month of using it. I would have paid more for a cute backpack like this one if it was better quality. This happened to both backpacks we purchased from Broadmix. All and all, it's working okay for our needs though."
3.0,"The band is quite tight. So it gives a slight headache or then slips off. I have slept in it twice, both times woke up with it off. The quality is good. I will try to stretch out the bands a little and give it another try"
3.0,Seemed a little cheap but worked for the purpose I purchased it for. Pretty sure you could buy the same quality for half the price.
3.0,"They are really heavy and probably not good for every day wear, which is what I was looking for. They are good sturdy quality though and didn’t cause a reaction. Easy to clip on."
3.0,"its alright im large and i figured i should order a large size one but when i got it i fitted a lil too big, other than that it feels pretty ok"
3.0,The color combo caught my eye.<br />Measured my palm and ordered the 3 pack.<br />So bummed that they were too big for my hands. Returned.
3.0,Has ltl bit of box effect on top.
3.0,"Ordered a size 3 for my son and it was way too small, like a size 2. Looks very cute though, I wish they had a size 4"
3.0,"Much bigger and &#34;chunkier&#34; looking than what I could tell by the pictures, but fine for the price."
3.0,"nice dress, zipper broke. One time use only."
3.0,My kid foot small and he is felling down while walking with shoes and I had return it was not proper fit. I feel shoes looks fine
3.0,thought they'd be bigger
3.0,I'm 5'9 They were short on me
3.0,"Based size selection on older russell zip hoodie. Bad guess. Nice , just not consistent sizing."
3.0,This is a average knit hat but I plan to wash it before wearing it. The white cap shows some black items on the inside...they<br />look like possibe dead bug pieces'''not sure.
3.0,The fringe was very wrinkled and can’t get it to straighten out!! But overall they are so soft and fit good: just wish they looked straight like the picture
3.0,The bottoms fit great. Top a lil tight. All together it's very cute though.
3.0,"I like the look of these glasses, but they are made more for leisure than driving. They really don't block the sun when you are driving into it."
3.0,"This isn’t the best coat in the market for sure. Unlike the more expensive competition, it doesn’t feature any sort of technology that makes it better in harsher, colder climates. That being said, if you wear some three layers underneath, it might just get you by. It is just basically a water resistant outer layer and a fleece lining inside, which doesn’t provide much protection in colder weather (colder for me being 10 or 15 Fahrenheit).<br /><br />The outside of the jacket is made of a very hard material, and if your hands happen to linger too close to the cuffs, it is very hard and can hurt. That’s a problem I encountered every day  since my hands were dry from the weather.<br /><br />Of course most of these things can be bearable for the price, but I traded it as soon as I could for another brand that was better built and had better technology as soon as I got to and outlet."
3.0,"Straight up china, and you'll know it. Don't pay over $30 for them."
3.0,Super cute but WAY thin like spandex. She’s wearing a tank top shorts and a petty coat. It’s like paper thin.
3.0,Garments as well as all other items should have country of origin. Gave this to goodwill. I dont use things from China or Vietnam
3.0,It’s kind a big for me cause I’m petite.
3.0,"Cute graphic, color just as pictured, very soft (but quite thin). I think it’s sized larger. I paid attention to other reviewer’s who said to definitely size up and I regret that decision. It is made to be oversized so order your regular size; do not order a size up."
3.0,It looks great but I am large chested so it's somewhat tight on top. Wish I would have purchased one size larger
3.0,"I really looked forward to this dress. I love the feel of bamboo fabrics. The dress arrived today and I planned to wear it this evening.  However, when I put it on there was a hole in the pocket.  Of course, I can stitch it up, but it is disappointing."
3.0,Love the message. Good quality. Too small.
3.0,Runs very small I usually wear a small/medium. Definitely need a large.
3.0,Looks like I’m wearing a tent. Lol. Great service but I hated the dress so I returned it. It’s just not my style. It also felt a lot heavier than I expected.
3.0,nice and cheap keychains. Good quality. They gave me 3 purple flowers instead of all rainbow colored flowers but that's about it.
3.0,Its ok cd me better.true to size
3.0,"The band that goes around ankle is too loose, it’s constantly falling dow and I see my toddler being bothered by it. Not worth it."
3.0,This top fits ok but material look  cheap.
3.0,Nearly see thru. Good price though.
3.0,Print and material are adorable! Product is well made. Neckline on the onesie is too large and has a gaped look.
3.0,"Small and badly suited but looking good though, got a crack on the back after tried it on. But returned it without problems and got a refund quickly."
3.0,The product fit at first but shrinks a size once u wash it. I recommend going upsize and washing them for a perfect fit. Other than the shrinking my hubby liked them.
3.0,Nice patterns. Really tight on my head though. Perhaps I have a big head lol.
3.0,I purchased these for my little sisters because our parents get us each one big thing each year.<br />It was nice to have several little things for the kids to play with while the adults are opening presents.<br />Although you could have got the items at the dollar store the holiday stocking the toys came in sold me.
3.0,"The earrings are pretty small, so small you can barely make out whats on them. Their kind of cheap looking as well. I would not buy again."
3.0,"They were pretty but the strap dug in to the top of my foot and that would hurt, probably blister, after walking in them so I returned them unused.<br /><br />I'm of normal BMI and don't have fat or swollen feet. Bought a size 10."
3.0,Pretty thin and feel cheap.  I am going to stick with Jockey.
3.0,"Wasn't what I was expecting it to be.  Granted I didn't pay a whole lot for it but I thought it would sparkle a bit more than it does - stones tend to be darker than shown in the photo.  Also, the back of it is a bit rough, I may have to put some sort of backing on it before I wear it. It arrived in 13 days."
3.0,otherwise great feel
3.0,these are fun...went to an event and also found these at the event!
3.0,"Not leather. It's synthetic, kinda disappointed in that, but still cute."
3.0,Sold to my parents
3.0,"These are allllmost great gloves, but there are a few shortcomings. First, there is no insulation in the index finger or thumb in order to make the tech sensitive feature work (I guess). Second, the leather is so thin that it looks cheap. Finally, there is no elastic at the wrist, so it is drafty.<br /><br />Soooooo close to being great. As they are I am still wearing them, while I look for a better pair. Please feel free to reply with recommendations of a better pair of gloves."
3.0,it's good but too thin fabric
3.0,They came with a hole on the seam. But still cute
3.0,"Very, very fine...only purchase if you like an invisible chain look."
3.0,Eh. To small. Never wore them after I tried them on. They came in a timely fashion in the mail. But defiantly to small.
3.0,Too big for flap. Inconvenient I felt to get into
3.0,This little dress is so cute.  However I'm hopeing that when I wash it it's nasty small goes away
3.0,It broke the second time I put it on
3.0,"The material itself is very comfortable and nice. The color is great & it does look like the picture! I am usually a size small and this ran a little too large for me. It didn't give me much shape (I am 5'3 with an athletic build) but I liked that it was flowy and not skin tight. It just ran a little big and kind of hung on me. If there was a size XS I would exchanged the sizing but unfortunately, a small is as small as it goes!"
3.0,The band size was small. I ordered a 38dd and it was too tight. I've lost some weight and I'm now at a 36dd but it's still too tight.
3.0,Too small for men. Get the Casio Men's F105W-1A Illuminator Sport Watch instead. Same watch (I think) it is bigger and has longer straps. Now I have both. The 91w-1 is a back up sitting in my center console of my car.
3.0,The picture shows a red and the product is actually a orange- red. I like the design a lot but was disappointed in the color.
3.0,"These haven't been the most sturdy of clips. Some have bent so the latch doesn't make contact, the spring has slipped out of several so that the latch doesn't stay closed.  They are lightweight, but won't even stand up to keychain use. the rings that came with them are about the only good thing about them..."
3.0,Very small and very little stretch. Will be gifting it to teenage relative.
3.0,"Perfectly OK socks, but socks meant to fit a 4 to 6-year-old should not also fit a size 9.5 woman's foot."
3.0,"The fit was alright (slightly loose in the waist), but the pattern in person versus on the computer left more to be desired. Sending this back"
3.0,These are a beautiful color and good quality but have a very sharp point on the nub. I wasn't able to sand it down so I can't wear them. It gave me a horrible nose bleed when I tried. It punctured right through the skin on the cartilage.
3.0,Nice but heavy.. does not match the picture
3.0,Gets tangled easily.
3.0,"pretty flimsy, but the preteens will like it."
3.0,"This was made for a super skinny kid and I thought my kid was “skinny”! Poor guy, can’t even move his arms around if I get it on him 😂😂 it’s been donated lol"
3.0,top band rolls down.
3.0,"The fabric is a tad scratchy, but besides taht it's really cute ^-^"
3.0,"Really more of dress belt for jeans that a dressy belt for other types of pants.  In that connection, it truly is overpriced.  Would not buy again."
3.0,I’m 120 lb. 5’2 and the small fit true to size but there is no way to adjust the top part of this one piece so it’s not secure for someone who has a larger bust.
3.0,A decent shirt although i found the neck collar gets out of alignments and sticks out inconveniently.
3.0,"Fabric is cheap, washed once, wrinkly and harsh; not great"
3.0,"Really cute dress but, obviously made for VERY small, petite people. I usually wear a small but, since I like things the fit loose, I purchased a medium. This dress is STILL a little snug around the hips and way too large in the chest area. Material is also cheap and, if you live in the southern U.S., you won't be able to wear it because it is made out of cheap material that is EXTREMELY hot."
3.0,"The socks came in a nice vacuum sealed bag. Generic branding. I did not open the bag, I wanted to return (not using them as planned). But you can see the other side of the sock through them. very thin looking. Might look different depending on your skin tone. I cannot comment on sizing and I forgot to take a picture before my return."
3.0,One strip broke at its first use.But overall very cute and nice swimwear.
3.0,Feathers were flying- it worked for the one night it was used but not the greatest quality. Good for a costume.
3.0,I’m normally a small or medium. Ordered a medium and was far too small and had to return it.
3.0,"El material es muy resistente y el estampado precioso. Sin embargo encontré el corte del delantal poco práctico y muy estrecho en la parte de arriba, quedando ésta un poco desprotegida. Para gente que se involucra en la cocina como lo hago yo no resultaba una solución y lo devolví.<br />Sería genial si el mismo producto tuviera tallas más grandes."
3.0,It's one of the prettiest ring I own. Only issue is the ring's gets caught on everything. But its so so pretty !
3.0,"I place these black and white tights on my daughter for the first time today... Look at the stiches where the ""shoe"" joins the ""stocking"". Terrible!"
3.0,Its extreeeeeeeemley small i wear a small/med top i bought xxl and it fits perfect but if i bought my size or one size up it wouldn't fit . I purchased 3 sizes up
3.0,"I loved the color, size and price , but the rock keeps falling off the metal ring. It needs to be attached more securely."
3.0,"They don't seem to help with sweat, but actually make me hotter. They do dry faster though, so that it helpful."
3.0,"I just received this today. It was supposed to be a gift for my husband, but it is much smaller then I expected. Its not much larger than a fanny pack. It is very nice quality and looks well made however, so I might keep it for myself"
3.0,This is a nice piece to add to my jewelry box.  It is casual and works nice with most outfits.  It has not turned color.  The heart will often be upside down though.
3.0,"Seems a bit big for XL. other then that it's a nice shirt. Washing and drying it, hope this shrinks it some."
3.0,Poor quality. And its not worth it the price...
3.0,Had to send it back bc the strapping in the front was sewen on backwards or inside out if it was not for that the dress would have been fine.
3.0,"Wife says time stops on these watches of not worn, we did not know this when we bought"
3.0,"Nice!  I think a little flashier than expected but,  I think well made"
3.0,Do the job covering my butt when out swimming.  Nothing special.  Comfortable with the stretch fabric.
3.0,Quality less than expected.  Bends and scratches easily.  Didn't retain shape like other aluminum bracelets I've ordered from other sellers.  Bracelet thin.
3.0,We got these to try wearing full time as a sneaker replacement.  We've had them for a month and have a hole in the toe.  We also had trouble getting the right size.  We started with an 11 and it was way to big.  Then we went down to 9-10 and it was still too big.  The too big part was too big behind the heel.  That may have contributed to the hole in the toe.  Loved the flexibility of the shoe.  LO loved them.
3.0,This  dress was not what I expected. It was too large and heavy. I will be returning it because I found something else.
3.0,"I read the review about it being in Asian sizing so I ordered a size up but that was STILL too small!!! Would recommend going two sizes up if you can. But, these shorts are still super cute and look just like the picture! Not super high waist, they hit right below the belly button!"
3.0,"On the website, these earrings looked like they would be a normal size earring for a woman. They are very, very small.  I am hoping that my 5 year old granddaughter will wear them.  I was disappointed with their size."
3.0,"I bought the same looking dress from another company on Amazon and it fit better.  When I saw that this company had a green dress, I thought it would fit the same. Nope.  The green is actually teal and not a hunter green.  The arms are tight. I am five foot seven and weigh under 120 pounds.  Rarely do I find a dress where the arm holes are tight on my twiggy arms.  There is no stretch in the chest, and so the cut ends up bad.  The dress I got elsewhere worked since it had some give. I'm a size zero with a 32C, so I need a dress that works for the chest.  The seams end up in awkward places and stick out due to the type of fabric.  I was informed upon putting it on that it wasn't flattering.  I'm bummed because I ended up being okay with the color. It makes me with that the other Amazon store with this dress offered it in this color (but with their stretcher fabric).  I have no idea if I will ever be able to do something with this thing."
3.0,The packaging was exceptional. Heart shaped jewelry box with a mirror. Inside another brown box. As you can see in the pictures. The name was done very well.  Good quality. However the chain is very thin and fragile.  For this reason I gave it only 3 stars.
3.0,"Gold color is not true to color, it's more of a bronze/rose gold"
3.0,"Sized up based on reviews, fit exactly as I expected it to.  Started coming undone @ the seams after a few washes though."
3.0,"It fit really well and looked great, but I didn't have them a day and the material was all cracking and piling away. It arrived on time and what I was expecting. I wouldn't pay as much as I did for them again. Not worth the price."
3.0,Very pretty but runs small even with getting XL
3.0,"Cute, but were too big for my son.  Sent back and got refund.  Company was easy to deal with."
3.0,Fit to the watch was perfect. Bought this because I liked it and several reviews indicated it was a large band. I don't think that is the case. I can wear it but have it adjusted to the next to last hole on the band​.
3.0,"5am the thing deflates. I go to inflate it as I did for the first time,  5 days ago. The stem will not close, no matter which way I turn it for many many turns. Now useless. Company does not seem to have a working web site.."
3.0,"I sized up thinking it might run small and that was a good choice. There was a small pink dot near the neck for some reason, but I’m keeping it because I don’t want to mess with a return."
3.0,"The material is nice, but pretty thin. Definitely need the right undergarments. The material is also stretchy, which is nice. Fits true to size and very comfortable."
3.0,"I ordered 2 to create a set. They took so long to arrive from China that I forgot I ordered them. They were poorly packaged & arrived damaged. They were in a 'bubble bag' instead of a box & the ear posts had been smashed flat. I carefully straightened them out & in the process I discovered how flimsy the posts were, as well as the piece that 'cradles' the upper ear to hold the tip of the earring in place. Since the posts aren't hypo-allergenic & made with a flimsy material, I won't be able to wear them for long periods or my earring hole will be sore & red for days. But... they'really beautiful for as long as they last."
3.0,"Hat is good quality.  But the picture in description is inaccurate.  All pictures on each hat color shows the violin as if the white outline is the only decal--it is not.  I got the navy hat (more blue than picture, too), and the inside of the violin is dark grey with the white outline (i.e., so the color inside the violin is not the same color of the hat itself).  The hat overall is of good quality, but it would have been nice if the picture was accurate."
3.0,"Looks and feels great but leaves some nasty residue on my wrist. Not sure if dirt or sweat reacts with the metal, or if it's rusting on my arm, but the band leaves a golden-brown stain beneath the metal plug. Speaking of which, the plug to hold it in place feels like it can rip or pop off any moment. The pin to attach to the watch is also slightly too large, not sure if it's a design flaw or my specific product's anomaly."
3.0,"Too stretchy to give enough support when working out. If you’re bigger in the chest, your there’s not enough coverage. I’d rather buy the danskin ones from Walmart. Those gives better support. But if you’re looking for looser fit lounge sports bra, go for this."
3.0,"Somewhat disappointing. Smaller than expected and hardly noticeable on the wrist. My wife did like the small shell detail, and the adjustable closure with a small jewel at the end of each strap, but she wasn't wowed. It would be a good item for a small or teenage girl."
3.0,"There is no size description available when I bought the belt so I took a chance.  Its a nice belt.  Heavy leather, should last for many years.  The buckle stitching is unfortunately in grey & red - looks like embroidery floss.  But it will be covered by the end of the belt so not a problem really.<br />The biggest problem is that the belt is sized as a 32 according to a tag inside .... my husband is no where near a 32 so this is a big bummer."
3.0,Sits loose on table. Not snug
3.0,Good looking but runs small
3.0,"I did not receive the correct chain pictured.  The chain I received is plain cable chain that looks very cheap, NOT the snake chain as shown in the product description.  The charm rings look nice."
3.0,Too big. Get one size smaller
3.0,The yellow is not as pictured. It is the gold &#34;ochre&#34; color.  Scarf itself is nice but color is wrong.
3.0,Connections were too small we ended up making a circle out of the extension so it became a 1 inch extension of my pearls
3.0,"Very very thin material, more like a nightgown."
3.0,"I purchased this top to wear over leggings. The color was true, the fabric nice and soft but even following the sizing guidelines, the top was huge...After washing a few times, the fabric “grew”, causing me to relegate it to a “nightwear” role."
3.0,Doesn’t look as good as the picture
3.0,Slit in side of dress is super high!
3.0,Arms are a little too snug to be worn as a robe after swim. My son wears a rash guard and to wear the robe over it made him uncomfortable. Guess it would be a better fit with the rash guard off.
3.0,Not as expected. It fit like a shirt
3.0,"it's an adorable dress, but it was just too big for me. i had to return it."
3.0,Got a hole in the center crotch before I even washed it.  Have another style of this brand and they got a hole in the same spot on first washing.
3.0,It wasnt horrible but not at all great.
3.0,Constantly was sliding down off my face and after wearing for a few months was already stretched out to the point I had to buy new ones of better quality that had a elastic in it to keep it up on my face. Not recommended for long periods of use.
3.0,Beautiful dress but way too small. I ordered an xxl hoping that would give me room in the chest area.  Nope.  It’s tight in the arms and back area and does NOT cover my chest.  I know what size I wear and this ain’t it despite what the tag says. It fits my daughter who is a small/medium perfectly. If there was an option for going bigger I would definitely order again because it is a beautiful true wrap around dress if you have the right size.
3.0,"The case is nice, but after having my phone in for only an hour the strap broke. Not real happy about it breaking so fast. This is the reason I'm giving this case 3 stars. Cheap thin strap."
3.0,"The robe was way too long, I had to have it shortened before my wife could wear it.  She really enjoys it now that it has been shortened."
3.0,"The waist is really small for xl. They stretch, but still a bit uncomfortable. The rest of the fit is very nice. I might order a size up, but afraid the crotch will sag. Will update if I do."
3.0,Material was as I had hoped - too thin
3.0,"I am quite disappointed with this product. I purchased a size 40C, and it fits like a 38C. I am therefore barely able to squeeze into it. On the picture it looks like it gives a lot of support, but it's not like that in reality. It is, however, cute."
3.0,Dress runs a little big and the material is a little too thin
3.0,To short and narrow<br />Hurt heel
3.0,"I bought this mostly for yardwork on sunny days to minimize coverage and sustain an all over tan. By no means would I plan to wear this anywhere other than my backyard. I'm tall (6-3) and 210lbs, with a 36"" waist. I'm not overweight, but have a few extra pounds around the middle and a longer body style. Oh yeah, I actually have a bottom. You know; Dad body!<br /><br />I normally buy size Large. I went up 2 sizes to XX-Large and it is still tight. The back kind of rides up and my ""cheeks"" tend to hang out the sides. There is little room up front. It covers everything, but if you have a bigger front or back, it may be more compressive than you might like. Construction is nice, and the pattern does what it is supposed to; hide the fact it's tan thru. Fabric is okay. Seems to work as intended. I live in a rural area, so doubt the neighbors notice (or care) what I'm wearing as long as I'm wearing something (lol).<br /><br />Positives: Tan thru, minimal coverage, nice for backyard on hot sunny days.<br />Negatives: Runs small, tight on larger body styles, not much room front and back, fabric a little scratchy."
3.0,The description is wrong! It says that bracelets may vary BUT they should ALL be adjustable seeing as it is part of the description. The one my grandson received was NOT adjustable! Very disappointing!
3.0,"Nice charm, but looks a little dull when I received it. Not as bright as the picture."
3.0,I am a women of color ordered a medium and these still fit very tight! clearly these are not made for women of color.
3.0,Hat was very tight. I loved the color but had to return it.
3.0,Pretty good jacket for the price. Decent main zipper. Could use a bottom tightener. The elastic hood draw broke the 1st week
3.0,"I had to return this item.  I purchased the large, figuring that it would fit fine, however it was so tight I could not get it on."
3.0,"Ok product, Very small , fast shipping."
3.0,The yellow is such a cool color but the large runs a little small so it felt a snug.
3.0,Great for photo shoots but never going to stay up on an active child.
3.0,Cute but feels cheaply made.
3.0,"I'm a size 12 and was barely able to pull these up. The smocked waist was so long it went from my belly button to past my butt. The drawstring is just a sewn-on piece of string and not functional. The pair I got looked new, but one of the pockets was already falling at a corner. Material is a non-stretch poly blend. It would feel cool for summer, but there are plenty of better options for the same price range."
3.0,The top runs large and the bottoms run small. I ordered a medium. I wear a small normally and the medium bottom looks like it will fit perfect but the top is way to big. Very cute bathing suit but the fit is off.
3.0,Light weight cap. Good for working out doors. Not authentic HD apparel.
3.0,"Looks nice but much bigger than I was expecting, even after reading the dimensions online.  I returned it."
3.0,They are about what to expect for $10 on sale.  Nothing special but not bad.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order them again but something to wear on vacation and not worry about losing.  Mine don't seem to curve around my face as I expected from the picture and stand out a bit from my face.  I also seem to have a little distortion around the level you would for a bifocal lens.  It's mildly annoying but not a deal breaker.
3.0,"I got the Green Butterfly dress. The fabric is soft and colors are bright. I have a 30&#34; waist so went with the size large so it wouldn't be super tight. Was 2-3&#34; too big. Also the &#34;straps&#34; are 3 thin pieces of white elastic that keep the dress hiked up to your collar bone. If I keep it, I'll definitely have to take it to a tailor to remove elastic straps and take the dress in 3 inches. At least it was cheaper than Retro Stage where I originally found the dress. Thank you ZAFUL for being local and affordably priced!!"
3.0,"too late to order,, I supposed to give this to my daughter, but she wants more Disney design, but it looks good though."
3.0,The dress is oversized but still cute.
3.0,"pretty pattern, just fit too big"
3.0,"huge and really, not very attractive.  Don't know if I'll wear them."
3.0,"I ordered this skirt in size xxl, and typically wear a size 16 bottom.  It fit well with regard to tightness and hang with it not being overly tight and hanging well for the most part.  My big downside was the length as it was much shorter than I expected.  many of the reviews I read stated that the back hung past their knees, and only being 5'4&#34; I thought length should not be an issue at all for me however the front of this skirt was way too short.  the skirt was well made and the material was soft but wont be able to wear because its too short.  I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  As I rely on reviews a great deal for my purchases I ensure that this review is an accurate reflection of the product I received."
3.0,"This is really nice alternative to a large, bulky wallet but it's a little bit of a pain to get the cards out of. I have had similar wallets to this in the past and they're a much better design that doesn't fall apart when you take cards out. I use it as a beach wallet when I don't want to bring much and it works great for that, waterproof and durable. It does look great and comes with a very nice packaging so it would make for a good gift. I also like that it comes with an extra rubber band for when that gets worn. Good but not great, fair price."
3.0,i am 6'1 and 220-- i ordered a XL and i could fit 3 of me into the dress. it runs very very big
3.0,These clothes I ended up returning because they didn't fit how I thought they would.  The sizing chart was small.
3.0,Very very high waisted! Very very thin!<br /><br />For curvy girls!
3.0,Pretty but not expected
3.0,I used this on a couple of my suede shoes.  They are cleaner but I used almost 1/2 the bar and they are definitely not completely clean.  For the price I was hoping for a larger bar (this thing is tiny) and for a magic cleaner!  Some of my suede looks a little &#34;roughed up&#34; after the cleaning process.  Maybe I put too much muscle into it.. I'm thinking the process shouldn't be so difficult!
3.0,"Although it looks very similar, these leggings are not dupes for the NVGTN leggings. They are not as stretchy and are a much thicker material."
3.0,Wore once and notice whole in finger
3.0,"The ice cream print is really cute and has stayed vibrant through several washings, but the top is too short for me and the elastic on the shorts is actually uncomfortable after a while, I'm hoping it eventually stretches out a bit. I ordered a large and am a size 8-10 for reference so maybe it would be more comfortable if you are a bit smaller than that."
3.0,"Size M<br />The size is good, the colors are beautiful and the fabric is thick!<br />I'm giving 3 stars because I did not expect the straps to be so THIN☹"
3.0,I ordered a large and it was more of an xl and they werent flattering but so pretty
3.0,The back of the strap rubs a bit in my heel but they’re cute and<br />Comfy.
3.0,They are actually pretty nice for the small price you pay. They were super long though so I couldn't wear them as I have a short neck and they looked silly.
3.0,"My daughter loved the color and look of the black and hot pink so we got it for her gizmo watch. It is a bit of a challenge for her to get in on herself with one hand. Takes some strength to push the piece through a hole and make the watch tight enough. The design is a bit awkward. You have to slide the band underneath/inside which is another challenge. Then to take it off, she always had to twist the band which eventually made it break in half. Because it was cheap and she liked it so much, I bought another replacement anyway"
3.0,"This is a very cute top; however the circumference of the sleeves was way too tight around my arms.  For women with larger chests, it fits way too tight. I ordered an XXL per reviews and size chart and it was still too small."
3.0,They were bigger than I expected
3.0,"Good, but not enougth...the materials are bad, my child played per weeks with it."
3.0,"These are okay, i like the look. The packaging had a suede snap envelope, plus cellophane and bubble wrap (besides the amazon envelope), and it was packaged so tightly that when I opened it the post was bent on one earring. It had been too flattened inside, I think. I could bend the post back into position, but it doesn't feel very secure on either earring, the post is a bit wobbly on each one and feels delicate and thin. Also, the earring backs feel loose on the thin posts. I will only wear them with other backs that i already had. They are not too heavy."
3.0,Even though they're too small I'll give it a three-star because I know that once I get the right size they will feel great...
3.0,Cute blouse but size chart is inaccurate. I know how to measure because I have sewn wedding dresses all the way to hats and boots. This runs at least one size too small.
3.0,I didn't realize necklace was cloth rope
3.0,"Looks good, I love them"
3.0,Purchased for a BWCA trip. It's lite weight and setup is easy. I didn't like that if you were not on flat level ground ( hard to do in BWCA)  some of the legs may fold up on you getting on it.  I weigh 195lbs and could feel the support bar on my back or side.  If they could create another 1-1.5 inches of space the product would be much better.  In the mean time take a small Thermarest with you.
3.0,"Cute costume, a bit big on me..so I'm just gonna get a bustier dress to go underneath..cute colors..love the stockings..wish it fit..got the Standard and I'm 5'3 100 lbs..34D..I'll make it work😁"
3.0,"Was looking for Lapis earrings and with other compatible colored stones (to &#34;jazz up&#34; the usually dark lapis) these seemed a nice design. Unfortunately, the match-up of colors wasn't there in the pair I received. One turquoise stone was close to that shown, the other was noticeably paler. Of the 4 green turquoise stones, one was like an overcooked (dull green) pea, looked fake by comparison and noticeably so. The photo had sold me, but the reality disappointed. I will be returning them."
3.0,came as shown in the picture
3.0,"The paracord itself and the Keychain are great. The clip however, did not last long. We have already had to replace the clip on most of them that we ordered after a week or so."
3.0,The zipper on front sticks all the time very hard to zip and unzip and sleeves too long
3.0,"Bought these boots for my fabulous teenager, who loves the way they look.  They certainly garner lots of attention and even strangers asking to take pictures of them on my teen's feet!  But these are not built to last.  After a couple of months the soles are separating in several places and we've had to reglue the rubber layers back together.  In addition, they give my kiddo blisters if worn too much. Best to think of these as ""costume"" footwear that might look great, but won't last long."
3.0,"I think it's worth it's value. I like it, it did what it was supposed to. I'd say it's perfect if you don't want to spend too much on a better/fancier version of this product"
3.0,"This is the exact same length as the factory band. Still on the very last notch for my 8.75"" wrist.<br /><br />I'll keep looking."
3.0,It doesn't cover the boob very well on the side actually because of the &#34;padding&#34; layer.
3.0,The built in bra doesn't have any padding so you'll still have to wear a normal bra with it. Otherwise it's very comfortable but does run a little small.
3.0,Inexpensive. Bought to convert into a costume. The strap loops are cheap plastic rings. One was broken and so that strap is unattached. Will need to find a resolution.
3.0,"I was so excited about this and sadly disappointed when I received it.  Upon opening the packaging I noticed it had a weird odor to it.  Upon further examining there were loose threads hanging off in multiple places.  I did decide to wash it anyways and it did hold up for the first wash.  When I wear it, it will not stay tied or closed."
3.0,"I wanted to like this dress so badly, but it just is way too revealing both in neckline and slit height for the event I need it for. I am a consistent size 4 34D and ordered the small. Way too low cut. I could’ve dealt with the high slit (as other reviewers have said) if the top part wasn’t so lowcut but the combo of those together made it a no-go easily.  Was otherwise well made and would be a bombshell on someone who either was comfortable with that level of cleavage or smaller chested."
3.0,"Way to small for an XL. Fits more like a small or medium, but definitely not and XL. I wanted to wear stuff under this while outside in the rain, but that  is not going to happen."
3.0,I ordered a 2xl. It is actually between a L and an xl. Some review said it was a little small. But it is a size and half down. The product is nice. Just make sure you order up.
3.0,This handbag is larger than I expected and looks inexpensive(maybe because it was haha) Really like the design and certainly is good for the price I paid.
3.0,Bottoms fit nice. Top over powers your chest. Returned.
3.0,"Overall, I love this swim suit. Perfect for my vacation to Hawaii for lounging by the pool. Extremely flattering and gave coverage while refraining from looking matronly or overly utilitarian.  Giving it 3 stars for the cut of the leg, which was a little narrow in the front and the bust. For this size and the fact it is a designer swimsuit, there should be a more options for the structure of the bust rather than padded cups. The bust was (barely) a step up from sports bra Uni-boob. An underwire would have been much more secure while maintaining the overall look."
3.0,"Cozy and warm, fits okay but tight in arms. Zipper is not best but workable. I purchased because of the length of jacket and has a hood."
3.0,Cute but much shorter than depicted in the photo.
3.0,"It's sort of cheap, and doesn't look like it will last long but too early to tell.  You get what you pay for.  It also took weeks to get delivered."
3.0,"Edit: I will say that they agreed to refund me my money and no longer required the product back. (It’s smashed) And that atleast the customer service is good.<br />Product was sent unwrapped,  thrown in a bubble poly mailer. This was taken after I tried to fill it in. It was almost flat. Plastic is so soft and cheap that it was creased/concaved in. Couldn’t use it. Returned item using return label given and product was returned to me again with the same damaged product. Post office says it’s not a real return address. I’m so irritated. Everything about this transaction has been a disappointment."
3.0,"Don't really help that much with glare, but I haven't used them much at night as a non-driver."
3.0,Didn't like it as much as the cotton ones that I had gotten b4
3.0,"These hats are not all created equal. I got the ivory colored one first and it is fantastic. Not fantastic for super cold weather but fantastic for a cute fashion statement running errands going in and out of builds etc..The ivory hat is super cute and I got a ton of compliments. The gray hat runs super small and is extremely stretchy (from top to bottom not in going around your head) making it more of a slouchy hat, which I am really not a big fan. It fits my 7 years old head perfectly and she really likes it so I am keeping it for her but if she didn't want it I would be sending it back."
3.0,Purchased two. Got the first one yesterday it was broken. The second arrived today and it was perfect.
3.0,Can not fairly rate the shoe...size too small.  Returned.  Ordered same pair in full size larger.  Wait until those arrive and I can answer other questions fairly.
3.0,"Fit true to size. Does not show underwear through. Nice and thick material. My only problem was cleaning them. I got a small stain on them that I tried using bleach to get out, which dyed the fabric yellow. Probably my own fault, but be careful cleaning!"
3.0,The fit is great but I did not receive a black top. As you can see from the pic it’s more dark grey and not black. Definitely not what’s depicted in the pic
3.0,"The individual bracelets are a little thin. It feels like it can break. Also the house names, the lettering is a bit hard to read. The main Hogwarts bracelet with the Deathly Hallows symbol is the best of the lot and if it were a little wider, I'd wear that one and forget the others. Nice product, could be better."
3.0,It doesn't spray very well
3.0,"These are well made, attractive and comfortable PJs.  The are not easy care and came out of the dryer very wrinkled"
3.0,I like it. I’m going to wear it to an event in Houston.
3.0,"ill fitting, waist stretchy but not all the material is stretch"
3.0,"Very cute, need more length and too thin but lovely dress"
3.0,I bought this 6 months ago. Even now it's in amazing condition.. I just don't like how it feels slippery
3.0,Xl es como la talla M
3.0,Item came fast! But I wasn’t too happy with the earrings they look pretty from the front but the back look cheap and look like will break
3.0,Works good as a wind mask when riding my Harley.
3.0,One arm came in bent. Luckily I was able to bend it back into shape. Very lightweight and has a cheap feel but they should work for right now.
3.0,I like them but found I'm not grabbing for them as Ieave the house
3.0,"The slipper is made sturdily.  It has a very durable sole.  However, it feels heavy when worn<br />Because the design does not have a toe ring, you have to grip the slipper by curling your toes while walking.  Constant curling of toes creates an uncomfortable feeling - not very pleasant.<br />Also, the insole is not soft or cushiony, another negative."
3.0,"The shoe seems to be of average value workmanship, nothing extra.<br /><br />it is too narrow for a 2e and too short.<br /><br />the lining seems cheap.<br />I will be returning ti."
3.0,"looks good at picture. a little ""cheap"" looking in person. but good price for what it is to be. son don't like the bracelet though."
3.0,Beautiful sweater but too small.
3.0,I still like this bra but the size is not any close to 38 it is more like 36 B for the Large.  Wish it came in larger sizes
3.0,I wish the rock is half size SMALLER other than that is good!
3.0,"Runs big! Fades after first wash, and began threading."
3.0,For the price and how many its ok. The quality is pretty bad. But it's better than walking bare foot.
3.0,Super cute but my nephew had some trouble walking with them. The padding on the bottom was too thick for him and slippers were always slipping off of his feet.
3.0,"Wanted some over-the-knee, knitted moto socks like the old-school ones. These are pretty thin and slightly like pantyhose. They do not go over the knee (5'10"" here). They go about halfway up the knee, which doesn't keep the pads from chaffing. They are just okay."
3.0,I would preferred them a litle biger
3.0,Much smaller than I thought it would be. I can hardly see the design.
3.0,"This Myobe women's crewneck knitted sweater is really cute, but I was a bit disappointed with the sizing.  I normally wear an XL, as I like my shirts comfy but not hanging off of me.  Although it is incredibly comfortable, the material sucks to your body and is a bit small.  The XL states that it fits a US size 12-14, but it's more like a 10-12 -- so it's off by a size or so.  It's very lightweight and wouldn't keep you very warm in the really cold winter weather, but perfect for our Arizona winters.  It's actually quite thin, so you'll probably want to wear a t-shirt or tank top underneath it - because you can sort of see through it.  This is pretty stretchy and has a tiny bit of sheen when I took a picture with a flash, but when seen with your eye, it's a solid brown color with no sheen at all.  I do love the A-line flare at the bottom of it and you could totally dress this up or wear it with a pair of jeans!  There was a snag on the bottom front of my shirt and I'm afraid that if I snip it with a pair of scissors, it will start a horrible unraveling effect that would ruin it completely.  Washing this may be a bit tricky.  There isn't a tag inside mine that states what it's made of or how to wash/dry it - but my guess is that it would have to be hand washed.  It just seems too delicate to throw in with other clothes, but MIGHT work on a gentle washing cycle.  I've gotta say, it's a lot cuter on the model in the picture listing, probably because she's a tiny lady - but it gives me inspiration to lose more baby weight so it fits better.  Overall, it's ok - but doubt I'll wear it a ton just because it was sized wrong and I'm not particularly keen on hand washing clothing items.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,Very cute matched every outfit
3.0,Bit to shiny ..
3.0,It’s a decent product
3.0,run smaller than another one I have bought from amazon before. order next size up!
3.0,Gorgeous print but it runs small.  Fit more like a large than the 1X that was ordered.
3.0,I wanted to like these very much.<br />I have the AT hard sole slipper’s that I absolutely love.<br />The Skane  fit very large. I tried my regular size then I down sized from there.<br />I normally wear a 40 way to big went down to a 39 still very large.<br />Unfortunately I had to return both.
3.0,"Verty dainty and cute, but it's cheap and poorly made."
3.0,Beautiful but too heavy.  Does not stay on the clothes.  Had to return.
3.0,"For the money this shirt works decent for my son, who has a sensory processing issue. It’s tight enough around the chest and tummy, the shoulder straps are fairly big and loose. It’s a good backup."
3.0,Much larger and longer than it looks or other 4Ts
3.0,Update: It is not waterproof.<br /><br />My husband really likes this jacket. It's a great jacket for a great price! Size medium.
3.0,"The dress is ok, fits a little snug but I can wear it. My complaint is the length. It said the medium length<br />was 41.3 inches but this one is just slightly over 39 inches long.  I would have reaiiy liked the extra 2 inches. I<br />thought maybe they had mislabeled it and sent me a small but the small is even supposed to be 40.9 inches,  Seems a little skimpy like they are trying to save fabric.  What did I expect from something made in<br />China!!"
3.0,"Again, another designer with sizes that don’t match what you, the vendor, is advertising."
3.0,Tight around the ankles but the material has a nice feel to it/\
3.0,"Exactly as I expected, but the smell is horrible.  Had to air out 7 days prior to using!"
3.0,I bought these for my 2 year old granddaughter.  They fit well but one sole slides sideways. My grandchild loves them but has a little trouble walking in one.
3.0,The dress is beautiful. If I had a smaller bust I would have loved it!
3.0,I was a little iffy with this dress but my friends says it looks nice.  I think i should taken a medium instead of a large though.
3.0,"Putting my set of keys into it was difficult and then when snapped, it closed awkwardly.  Too much work."
3.0,"The soles are narrow but the straps seem to be made for wide feet, so they're way too loose for my feet. I kept them because I needed new sandals and got tired of failed attempts to find so I like."
3.0,"I love the color of the top, but even when order a larger size for the chest area, the waist is still a tight fit. Thinking about returning it."
3.0,"I liked the style and construction, but it just didn't fit well enough to keep. Wore them for the better part of a day trying to see if they'd stretch (since they're ""fur"" lined), but they didn't."
3.0,I bought one for my daughter who is seven and one for my wife who is petite.  A little big for my daughter obviously but not by a lot.  Barely fits my wife.  Not happy about that... I wasn't happy with it.
3.0,"The bag looks nice, but right when we pulled it out of the packaging we noticed all the lights were missing from the pre-made holes."
3.0,The transfer inside has a it hy backing on it. Tear it off and cover patch with a soft cloth so it's wearable.
3.0,"first of all these feel like tights. Second, they aren’t even khaki, it’s mustard yellow. Not what I was expecting at all. On the other hand it came in one piece, nothing is tearing and it doesn’t feel like cheap material."
3.0,"I got a medium size, and it fits rather tight. I'm a slender 5'8"". Other than that, it seems to be of good enough quality for the price. If you need something for a light rain/camping, I would definitely suggest this. Very lightweight and compact. I would suggest buying a size up than you normally wear however. There is not much more room if you want to wear a sweater or another layer underneath.<br /><br />In summary,<br />1. A bit tight around the chest area. Buy one size up than what you would normally wear.<br />2. Great for camping/traveling."
3.0,"Set runs true to size and is really flattering, but is a bit more sheer then I would have liked."
3.0,"Sadly I returned this dress. It fit fine, but I did not like the way the wrap part of the skirt portion laid on my belly. It added a puffiness exactly where I don’t want to add fluff. It was a great length and fit fine in every other way."
3.0,So warm makes me sweat ever time I wear it. Kind of like a sauna bag.
3.0,Has speckled colors on it that is not listed..was expecting and all grey and black tank
3.0,made in China...check size comments for US<br />pretty colors
3.0,They run very small if u wear large get xl
3.0,The shirt is exactly like one of the shirts Carol wears! I got a size large in this & it was big. The shirt was kinda ok but the pants is made really weird. I was not able to wear the pants because they are made really big up top & they wouldn’t stay on. I really don’t know why they are made so weird. But if your going for the carol look this is a must… but be prepared to use another pair of leopard pants. I used the flower thing it came with as a necklace instead of the halo of flowers for your head. Shirt fit loose & had a lot of room in the sleeves. I should’ve sized down. We had Zoo Day at my work so me & the guy I work with dressed as Carol & Joe!  We definitely was the biggest hit that day!
3.0,"Bought this for our Nook HD. The case is somewhat a little heavy but the Nook had a little problem sliding into the case. It was very tight, but after some pushing and pulling, it went in. The leather around the nook it self is very sturdy, but for my Wife, she says it's a bit to heavy for her. For the price, it's ok. There are better cases out there."
3.0,"No es de algodón, pero es lindo"
3.0,"I ordered a size Large, because I wanted it to be tight, I usually wear an X-Large. The Large was very baggy on me, and I’m 5’11” and 230lbs, my shoulders are 56”, chest 46”, and it fit baggy on me. So just keep that in mind, I would order a size down. I do like how they look though and the style so I’m gonna get some Mediums."
3.0,Cute costume but it did NOT come with the headband and it’s suppose to. Now I have to find a headband. The seams along the edge are also not what I would call a finished hem. I’ve included a picture for reference.
3.0,The sleeves were too baggy
3.0,These aren't bad.  Great material but there's something that seems irregular about the fit of my pair.  I'm not sure if that's just me or if I got an irregularly sized item.
3.0,The product is satisfactory my issue is it was a week and a half late and took over a month to get here make sure to check your measurements for they're size chart as it will be small if you get your normal size other than that it's very cute and I love it💜
3.0,Smaller than I thought and does not appear to be new as advertised. I am still satisfied with it enough to keep it.
3.0,Smaller than appears.
3.0,"I think its a cheap movement, I have to manually wind it once in a while. But, the price is great for what you get. After all its a mechanical self wind for very little money."
3.0,Could not understand or see the embroidery.
3.0,"is okay , cheap bag for rough usage , didnt expect a lot"
3.0,Be careful. This is simply a clear solid item with a colored backing. The seller should provide a side view that discloses that the color is not through-and-through. Wife was disappointed.
3.0,N-A
3.0,"The material for this dress is something shiny like polyester. Definitely not breathable or good for summer, which defeats the purpose because it's a spring/summer dress. The fit, however, is very nice. Because the material, I wanted to return. The seller offered to refund 100% but in reality only refunded 50%."
3.0,Love the shirt just slightly too big
3.0,I have small wrists and this is tight on me.
3.0,The color was way way way off but the style is as shown
3.0,"Not the best quality, but sizing is great"
3.0,Good shoe but too big.  I gave them away.  That was a good thing.
3.0,"It was ok, a little tight in the bust in the bust area.  I had to send it back, the fabric was heavy and it reminded me of 70's polyester pants."
3.0,Liked the pattern & fabric:)
3.0,The band is nice and looks elegant. The could have been a 5 Stars except for it’s imperfection. The middle strand of beads is misaligned and you can see the elastic thread connection to the base. I didn’t return it because of it being nice. So I’m giving it 3 Stars review.
3.0,These don't work well for night driving
3.0,5 out of 50 lights did not work.
3.0,"Not quire what I was thinking, but still pretty cute. A bit cumbersome for a child's dress. And the Tulle shows up all crazy, you'll have to fix it. But overall, it's not too bad."
3.0,It was really Tiny. pretty but too small.
3.0,"These are super soft, and great for wearing in the fall/winter under a dress perhaps.<br /><br />They are a little more thin than I had expected. If you aren't wearing nude underwear and your bum shows, folks will see them!!  I included a pic, where you can see my nail polish through them when stretched.<br /><br />They fit a bit smaller/tighter than i would assume, for something labeled plus size. I wouldn't say these are plus size, as anyone over a size 16/18 might not find them so fitting."
3.0,My daughter is not a big fan on these shoes. They are very boy like 😕.
3.0,i like the dress but ut is a bit baggy. i was afraid to get a smaller size since there is no stretch. it is a bit see through.. i got the dark one.. overall you can wear a slip under..and it is good for work or some kind of appropriate event where you dont need to dress to impress. i like it still. may get a dress clip for the back to tighten it up though.
3.0,"These are so cute! My daughter picked these out after seeing a few people using them on Musical.ly, and she will love them for Christmas. I opened them up to make sure they work, and they work beautifully.<br /><br />Update!<br />One of the fingertips stopped working shortly after she opened these,  so I returned them for a full refund."
3.0,Really small! Super cute but one side always comes untied but that’s a super quick fix. This is super cute I just would pack light!
3.0,a little bit smaller to the real size
3.0,The material on this bathing suit was so thin I didn't like it. The hot pink color was nice but I had to return this bathing suit.
3.0,Good fabric and style just ran small.
3.0,"size ordered was a XXXL, I received the item, but it fit like a Large."
3.0,"It's a cute shirt and the material is ok, it's a silky feeling shirt that is well made. It fit as expected but it hung a little funny on me, I'm thinking it will look better as a layering piece with a cute camisole under it. They do give you a sash thing which just ties around your waist to bring more shape to the shirt, so you can choose to use it or not which gives it some versatility."
3.0,"I purchased this set of Jeweler's Loupe, and it is alright. The little cases that come with it are nice. They magnify alright, but I doubt it is actually 30x magnification. However, I did purchase another product, [[ASIN:B002E0MU70 SE Mini 45X Microscope w/ Illuminator]], which I feel is SOOOOO much better. The led light is wonderful, and magnifies much more than these Jeweler's Loupes. If you can only function with a magnifier like this, I would recommend it, but for 99% of people, I recommend the above mentioned product."
3.0,I'd give it another half if I could but 3 is just fine. The reason why is due to the significant difference in length with sizes 10 & 11. There were also a few quality issues but overall happy with what I paid..hopefully they last through the season.
3.0,"I love Dakine products. They are always quality. The shipping was fast and transaction was easy. But the pictures were deceiving. Based on the 5-6 pictures showed for the color I bought, I thought I was getting a blue stripped wallet with a floral inside. It’s all blue stripes, inside and out....kinda boring. I’m keeping it because it was on sale. But if I paid full price, I’d return. Not my favorite print. It’s not love."
3.0,"I really loved these shoes, the style and the fit were perfect but when I walked on them, the high arch support felt like it was stabbing into the arch of my foot but I do have problems with that foot and I just need the right cushioned sole, these weren’t it for me!"
3.0,Just not sure about the color. It's my problem!
3.0,"Great for the price. You'd need to steam them because they come out wrinkled but then the color came off onto my hands and steamer, staining both."
3.0,bit too big - will be returning.
3.0,not much strong
3.0,"I got these just to wear around the house, but they don't fit right. My biggest problem is the length of the crotch, so long. The material is a bit stiffer than I would prefer for so called jogger pants. They are more light a very lightweight jean. I had expected a soft more fleece like pant. The waistband is good, snug fit not tight though. They have 2 side entry pockets with 2 larger pockets over them. Not sure why there is a small zipper pocket on the back. I will not be wearing them."
3.0,"Love the dress, but definitely a smaller, small fit!"
3.0,The color red is much brighter than the picture depicts.
3.0,"The ring is nice, but straight out of packaging, it has flaws (see picture I added). Granted, it's an inexpensive item, but stainless steel jewelry should arrive flawless, since it's made by a machine. Quality control let this one slip by and I was the ""lucky"" recipient. Kinda disappointing, because in all other aspects it's a very nice piece. Looks just like rose gold."
3.0,Really cute but it left my wrist a greenish color after wearing it for a day.
3.0,"I don’t like the fabric, size up for sure!!!"
3.0,"They do the job. They are a bit flimsy and the connectors/holders break off easily. Also, the center spring will scratch your lenses so be careful"
3.0,"The style of the dress is great, however, the stitchings were poorly done. The dress I received already had a rip on a stitch and seems that the rest of them won't even last long. The fabric is kind of on the stiff side. Will definitely be returning it."
3.0,"A little to big, fit a bit loosley"
3.0,It doesn’t look as nice as the photo. The chain is thicker then pictured
3.0,These are just okay; however the inside gets wet easily. I'm not sure of that's just from my child playing in the snow and/or snow getting down in the cuffs.
3.0,The stone is beautiful and the size is just right. The chain is very thin though. It was all tangled when I received it. I hope it does not break. I will update after a while.
3.0,"This was pretty, but the heart fell off."
3.0,It's pretty but it does not stay on the ear as shown. It hang or u have to push it really hard on the ears for it to stay. I return the earring a week later wasn't staying up
3.0,"Love the style and color of this Apple Watch band. It’s just a bit too big for my wrist. Overall very nice, though."
3.0,"Nice pattern. The pants worked for me, but they bordered on being a little too big. One size fits 0-12 is a little broad for a size."
3.0,"The type of fabric used on these makes them stretch out pretty fast. I don't mind that when I am home, but I would not want to wear these with a pair of jeans or a fitted dress. I am a pretty dedicated Hanes underwear wearer, but I do not like these very much. It is getting harder and harder to find the style that I really like. Bummer."
3.0,"It's look sophisticated. Appears to be made sturdy. On negative, the metal wire that holds the beads, at the ends and the secured clamps are sharp. Continuously scratching the back of my neck. I did try pushing the lose ends of the wire under the  beads but they  still come from under the beads. Then, I did a not so bright thing...i thought filing clamps with a nail file would smooth it but it sharper. Smh. My last fix, I put clear tape on the areas that is scratching my neck. Tacky but it worked. Not sure if the manufacturer will see this, if so, maybe something could be done."
3.0,Wrong future f me.
3.0,"After the first washing, the pocket started coming apart."
3.0,I tried these a second time and these are still not that great-- getting them in the right place so you can see is tricky-- Think I will stick with bifocal sunglasses instead
3.0,They are very cute but has some glare to the lens.
3.0,Fine for my purpose which to have these all over the house because the 2 pair I already have are never around when I need them!
3.0,"Very cute, but really tight. Made for smaller necks."
3.0,This is a cute halo. The light up part is fun and this would be great for a kid. Easy to turn on with one little switch. Will see if it holds up as I just got it.
3.0,nice hat but material stretches and becomes too large for your head.
3.0,Sizing runs very smal and it arrived with a snag in the fabric
3.0,"This was a really cute part of a Christmas gift, however, it did not fit the camera I bought it for."
3.0,"I like these socks. They are comfortable, warm an durable. They do, however, stretch a lot. Walking around the house in stocking feet doesn't work because the stretch and are soon flopping like big clown shoes. Contained in shoes, they work out fine. And they go back to their shape when washed."
3.0,Colors and designs are bright and vibrant. Unfortunately I don't like how they fit. Definitely not women's sizes. They are more of a fit for a mens feet.
3.0,"This is a very beautiful dress, I purchase this dress for a funeral, the zipper did not work, I really love the w."
3.0,This earrings are heavy on the ear. Might have to return it
3.0,"The material is nice but it runs very small.  I ordered an XXL and it’s very tight. Interesting because nothing else I have in this size is too small. May fit if you have a slender physique. But only wash it in the washer, then line dry or you won’t be able to wear it again. 😀"
3.0,just ok for me
3.0,Cute design but the arms are too small and tight. Returned.
3.0,My daughter loves that these shoes light up. I really think the charging of the shoes are a great idea but the shoes are a bit cheaply made. They have already lost their shape after 3 wearings.
3.0,Not as nice of quality as expected or seen in the picture
3.0,the top piece was not connected to the headband property.  Not a good quality. It's pretty though.
3.0,I have ordered these a couple times but my most recent pack were already too big and I got the same exact size. My older pairs all stretched out after about a year or so... not sure if the production changed or what but I’m a little bummed and will try a small instead (even though medium should of been okay)
3.0,Not as slim fit or flows as the pic shows. Comes down straight flat and seems more church dress in person than cute or sexy party dress. Wish the bottom had more poof to it like it shows.
3.0,Medium fits okay very revealing size 6 woman’s 34dd<br />Pretty cut but see through not for my body but maybe someone else’s that is less curvy.
3.0,"These look nice off my face but when I put them on they sit really high on the nose. If you are the type to pull the frames up over your face to rest on top of your head do not do it with these sunglasses, hair gets easily<br />caught in the nose part."
3.0,"The dress is cute, but the quality is terrible. The bottom skirt is much shorter than the tule on top, making this dress half way see thru. Which would be ok, if the bottom skirt was not so trashy looking. The bottom is rolling up and is uneven."
3.0,"Nice watch, average"
3.0,"I ordered a 'Siva Women's Casual Long Sleeve Pullover Hoodies Crop Top Sweatshirt' in a medium for review.  This sweatshirt is huge for a medium, it is  cropped at the right length but the shoulders and breadth of it is huge.  The material is not very soft and after washing it with fabric softener it did not soften up much.  It is of decent thickness, but just hangs on my wife who normally wears a medium but prefers a large for extra room.  This is even too big for her.  Overall, so-so quality and a terrible fit."
3.0,When I first received the item it smelled horribly. I had to wash it which was frustrating because I wanted to start wearing it as soon as I got it
3.0,"It’s not dark washed like the picture at all, which I will have to do on my own. Still looks good but lacks any depth/contrast as it."
3.0,"Love the shirts, only problem I had with them is that I ordered 6 shirts and my blue one had 4 holes on the left sleeve"
3.0,I would have liked a bit more compression. I wear a women's 7 and purchased the small. They ran a little big but nothing terrible. I guess because they are unisex. Very good value. I haven't washed them yet so I don't know how they will hold up for the long haul but overall satisfied.
3.0,"I like the ring for the price but I couldn't really see the pink tone some reviewers mentioned you could see through the carved rose. I do see the pink inside the ring but it doesn't show through the carved rose. The ring is very pretty but it is a bit heavy for my liking. It is a bit thick so you always know you have it on whereas I bought another one (stainless steal ring band) no rose and it is very light , smooth to the touch and I do forget I have it on, very comfortable. This ring however is a bit too chunky for me so I gave it to my niece and she just loves it."
3.0,Nothing special. Okay value for the price.
3.0,Now I don’t want to say they were completely bad. They are comfy. Not very soft but not terribly scratchy either. My biggest issues are that they are PRETTY see through. These are for under things ONLY. They cling a little weird on the bits. If you know what I mean. And I’m 5’ 6’’ and I have to roll them up twice to not be too long. Overall they are... okay. I suppose.
3.0,"Love the style, the stripes. Too  small. Gave to charity."
3.0,Giant! Returned. And the colors I wanted not available in medium. I think they should fit true to size. I ordered large (5'6 and 135 lbs) and swam in the large
3.0,Need to order size up
3.0,"The leather band on the watch is already starting to show wear, but my husband does love the style of the watch."
3.0,"I wrote a review when I received these socks, saying that they seemed to be of excellent quality, but were too small. With a 16.5"" calf circumference, I figured I'd need a wide-calf size, but the specifications for the item didn't off that information, so I ordered a size up and hoped.  I couldn't even get it over my foot!  The company contacted me offering to send me a larger size, which they did, but unfortunately, it still didn't fit.  I appreciate their responsiveness to my problem (I didn't ask to return the purchase because I'd tried it on barefoot, so they were responding to my review.) Looking over other reviews, it seems that fitting all shapes and sizes is challenging, and I encourage this company and ALL compression sock manufacturers to list a suggested calf circumference range for each size."
3.0,sent it back because it was smaller than expected.
3.0,The task fit a little tight on my head but i do have last of hair. Also the mask holds in a lot of moister and i needed to cut a bigger hole to be able to stop that. Overall it was a decent mask for the cold and it works to keep me warm in the fridge warehouse.<br />Also it looks pretty awesome and I have gotten allot of compliments at work because of it.
3.0,I really like this dress it fits well and reaches my knee (I’m 5’7”). Unfortunately it started pilling after 1 wash in a machine and hung dry. Definitely should be hand washed.
3.0,"Very cute, but it runs big."
3.0,Not bad. Fabric so so. Fit not too tight.
3.0,"Not particularly flattering, but pretty pattern hence the 3 stars. Planning some alterations or a belt so that it doesn’t look so much like a bright nightgown or pool cover up. Some back binding would have helped I think as I have a similar dress from a department store that cinches in the back creating a better shape."
3.0,"I only like this product. Not love. The color of this in real life is much much much more coppery/bronze and I haven't found a good outfit to wear this with yet. I wish it was more gold/white gold like in the picture. The actual pine cone is a lot bigger than I thought it would have been, so I am a bit put off for that."
3.0,"These are indeed very, very small.  For the price and the number of earrings though, this was fine.  I'm not super excited about them, but they work and were accurately described."
3.0,I’m a large USA and this is like a medium maybe even a small
3.0,"The shirt is cute, but runs small.  Order at least one size larger."
3.0,Nont sure these are new.  Had no tags and was in a zipper baggie... hmmm
3.0,"The sweater is wool, it smells like wool and made me itchy and uncomfortable. Also, the color isn't a pure pink, it is mixed with dark gray threads."
3.0,"Look, this is a great jacket BUT my<br />husband ordered a 3XL and it fit like Winnie the Pooh. WAY TOO SHORT for a larger sized jacket. It looks like they manufactured them wider as the sizes go up, but the length stayed the same whether it was a small, medium, large….etc. If you’re ordering a smaller size, it shouldn’t be an issue. But anything bigger probably won’t work."
3.0,"I love the pearl except the cz diamond, it’s heavy and not sparkly"
3.0,Material is a little cheap and becomes full of static easily.
3.0,It's nice I like the packaging  and the quality
3.0,"So, it's a $5 belt... I mean, I guess I don't expect a whole lot, but 2 weeks in, the &#34;leather&#34; already started to crack.  So I guess just know that you are getting what you pay for.  I use it infrequently and it is fine.  If I used it every day, it probably wouldn't last very long without looking trashy."
3.0,I got this mask for church since they look pretty and fancy... they are not a tight fitting you will have to keep fixing your mask
3.0,Tight and shorter then I thought
3.0,Great wallet but it sucks that a day later the price dropped significantly than what I paid. I'm almost tempted to send it back.
3.0,"Good material, soft touch."
3.0,"The material was nice, but it fit kind of weird on my butt compared to my stomach. Disliked the way it fit my legs.. I also did not really care for the color in person once it arrived. I would give it a 9/10 on squat proof test!! I would say that sizing is true to its description. I would say try it out and see how it fits YOUR body!"
3.0,nice and clean
3.0,"I would have loved these thanks if the shelf had been deeper. Unfortunately, it's so shallow that it barely provides any coverage at all. If you are small chested these might work for you but avoid if you are more endowed."
3.0,"Not exactly what I thought it would be.  The fit is fine and the material is okay --it's just not as close to the 40's fit/style I imagined it would be.<br />The price was fair though so I'll keep it and wear it, but it won't be a favorite in my wardrobe rotation."
3.0,this shirt is cute but not true to size. to be comfortable in the shirt you need to go up 2 sizes
3.0,"I have these from a couple of years ago, ordered in a larger size and returned it because it was smaller that the size I had! Going to try again, because it's my favorite if I can get the right size."
3.0,Black piece broke off
3.0,the fit great..soft...long legged<br /><br />BUT NO FLY
3.0,"Beautiful skirt , I am going to buy more in other colors, but I would order a size up.  I am a size 6-8 so I ordered a medium (8-10) and it is a bit tight.  But this skirt is flattering and and comfortable."
3.0,"These would be PERFECT if it wasn’t for the camel toe :(<br />Great material, perfect length, and hello- pockets! But for some reason they didn’t sew in any type of gusset, so it’s just one long seam right up the middle :( I got them to workout in, so I wouldn’t want to wear these in public without some type on long tunic.<br /><br />I’m going to hang onto them until another brand arrives in the mail to compare them to, and if the other pair has a gusset seen in I’ll be returning these. So sad, because I love them otherwise!<br /><br />I’m 5’10”, 130 pounds for reference- small fit perfectly."
3.0,"Cute dress that I wore to a wedding.  Then I washed it and all the colors faded.  It's not bad but certainly not as good as it was.  Also, requires a TON of Ironing! Price was decent so even if I dont wear it again it was good for the wedding."
3.0,"I bought a size up because of the reviews and got an XL. I am normally a size large 170lbs and 5'7&#34;. I thought this top was very wide in the waste and not flattering at all. I decided to return. If I had bought a large it probably would have fit better. Kind of cheap material as well, but a good price so I guess that's expected."
3.0,"The quality of silk is wonderful. I was disappointed in the actual colors. The picture showed much more gray in the fabrics, but the actual fabrics had very little gray."
3.0,"I LOVE the fit of this swimsuit! The bottoms are super flattering, and the suit is overall really cute. Unfortunately, after only wearing the top twice, the metal support wire was already poking out and I had to throw away the top. It definitely does not cover as much as the picture makes it look.I can still wear the bottoms, I just have to use a different top now."
3.0,"Nice little shell bracelet.  Pretty rose gold, delicate.  Shell is one sided and the crystals embedded in the shell scatter very little light.  The closure is pretty with the bead and dangling  crystal ends adding some movement and interest.  Even with the one-sided shell, if the crystals in the shell offered more bling I would have given it 4 stars."
3.0,"Good quality, a little tight..."
3.0,I like that it folds up- material is thin - for the price it's ok
3.0,Its ok for wearing for casual days as a tshirt top but the material is very cheap and the sewing quality is meh. It stretches odd when washed and dried.
3.0,"Yellow is see through and fabric hangs a little heavy. Impossible to wear without showing off bra and panty lines unless wearing a thong or wide coverage bra. I have three in yellow, light blue, and olive. Very comfortable for wearing around the house or sleeping in but I don't think I'll be wearing out of the house till winter when I can layer. 5'1, size 6-8, 34a, 135lb ordered medium and small, small fits better, hits about an inch above the knee."
3.0,Because BOC BORN shoes do not come in half sizes I sometimes have problems with sizing. Same goes for this shoe I need a 7 1/2 but had to order 8 which is a little large.  Also I was surprised at how stiff the leather bands near the toes were. I think I will get blisters if I keep. Will probably return! Disappointed!!
3.0,"Not worth the price! Disappointed, indeed!"
3.0,"It would have been better if the hoodie were thicker. Because it's paper thin, it really disappointed me, especially since it was for a friend."
3.0,"Other reviewers who mentioned the frames of these being &#34;brittle&#34; are absolutely correct.<br /><br />I had a brand-new pair of these for only three weeks.  They never left the house, were never in extreme hot/cold temperatures, were only used in the middle of the day or late afternoon to protect my eyes from glare.  When not in use, they were always in the provided case.<br /><br />By no fault of my own, the frames cracked right around one of the lenses, not far from the nose piece.  I will get an exchange from Amazon with no cost for return shipping, but I expect a product with the &#34;Eagle Eyes&#34; brand to be durable!<br /><br />The lenses work great to reduce eyestrain while in front of a computer/TV and also do the best job of any fitover I have owned to reduce glare in a sun room i work out of.  The frames just have to be made with a more durable material (similar to whatever Jonathan Paul uses for their Fitovers, three pairs of which I have owned for five years with NO issues).<br /><br />If the replacement pair also breaks with light use, then I will have to render this product worthless at that point."
3.0,The earrings arrived quickly. They appear to be good quality. My only complaint is that the earring backs are TINY! I had to replace those because my daughter is 15 and those little backs were getting lodged in her earlobe
3.0,"Updated review-  I have had these socks for a couple months and have found that they are frequently slipping off my feet and have many holes in the lace, although I have only worn them less than five times each.  I am disappointed in the quality and will not be purchasing this brand again.  I wear a size 9 and sometimes have swollen feet.  These socks fit perfectly and don't show with my flats, although they are pretty enough to."
3.0,ok for the money on a bike but not out
3.0,"The dress is very pretty. My granddaughter wears Bonnie Jean dresses and the size 7 fits great. The top of this dress is huge on her, fits like a size 8."
3.0,I should have gotten a size smaller
3.0,Cute dress and better quality than I expected but very short from neck to waist - I'm 5'9&#34; and the waist hit at a really strange spot.  I don't recommend this if you are tall.
3.0,Loved the fabric and fit but had to return the dress due to seams on front of chest came to points which were not flattering at all.
3.0,They are as expected.
3.0,Product fit. But didn't realize until I was hand washing it  the seam has not been made properly<br /> So I can not wear again 😣
3.0,This dress is not made for short people.
3.0,Really thin material.  I wore it once and it disappeared.
3.0,Not as shiny as the picture describe.  feels cheap.
3.0,"These are fine, as long as you aren’t wearing shoes. If you are, the seam around the ankle is going to rub and dig into your foot. Which will effectively make the most comfortable shoes a nightmare."
3.0,It's cute. Would of been nice if it would of been the same on both sides.
3.0,Love the style but the fit is smaller.
3.0,They run smaller than expected. I wear a large and that’s what I buy but they can’t zip up and the waist is under my breast which doesn’t the flair to be obvious
3.0,Super cute top. It draws up quite a bit after washing and that’s only reason I gave three stars. It’s still fun to wear with leggings.
3.0,"If you're a fan of the ""skinny jeans"" then you'll absolutely love these. If you're like me and you aren't trying to dress up but actually be comfortable,  then I recommend Under Armour."
3.0,"Size 36 is usually quite loose on me and is the reason I wanted it for use over swim trunks. But this ""36"" is like wearing a corset. An yes I have remeasured myself."
3.0,"I was going to post that I loved this sweater, and that it fit perfectly on me (5'6&#34;, 145 lbs, size small normally), but it got a huge tear in the seam under one of the arms, so I had to return it :( If the quality of the sweater was better, I would have given this 5 stars. The slits in the side were super cute and the fabric was soft and only a tiny bit itchy, but comfortable. I'm bummed!"
3.0,This bag tore a bit too quick. : /
3.0,I bought this for a belt to wear with a suit.  I ordered it to come overnight and UPS messed up delivering it so I had to go to Macy's at the last minute and ended up keeping that one for a couple dollars more.  I know it is an inexpensive belt but there are others in this range that look a little better.  I returned it and kept the one from Macy's.
3.0,"The ring is pretty, but is no where near the color of a true Emerald, I don't know what you would call it's color. It's almost like a light mystic fire topaz or maybe even a light mystic green topaz, but definitely not an Emerald green! Not at all what I expected! I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas because she has been begging me for an Emerald ring. Our funds are limited right now, because I had to have back surgery unexpectedly at the beginning of September and have been out of work for two months before that and am still unemployed, without unemployment, and only my Husband's income. I thought this ring looked nice for the price. I sure hope she isn't disappointed because I can't afford to send it back!<br /><br />Marmie is sorry, my little Cricket, but this is the best I can do for now!"
3.0,Well-made product but I was disappointed the the color wasn’t a neon bright yellow.
3.0,A little short fitting for taller people. 5'6 here..
3.0,Rubber on ear pieces comes off way to easily. Side blinders NOT removable unless you never want to put them back on. Otherwise comfortable .
3.0,"I love the design of this piece, but the material is somewhat tarnished, and some of the gems along the front are missing."
3.0,this product is super cute. the only thing wrong is that the gold beads tarnish after a few wears...
3.0,Maybe I was expecting something else... but the mask came as described.  Its actually a hard surface and really tough on the face.  Cant wear this too long...
3.0,It's very thin almost see through.. not very reliable to wear for winter .. I have to wear it over something else.
3.0,I don’t care for this material.  I thought it was going to be a sweatshirt material.  It’s kind of silky instead
3.0,Its Okay
3.0,"This is cut oddly for a flowy bohemian look. It’s loose at the top but gets narrow around the waist/hips. That’s the opposite of what I want from a boho dress or tunic. The neckline is a bit strange as well, but not bad. I’m not sure if I will wear this or not."
3.0,"Cute as can be and a good laugh with the butt cheeks having no pattern.  There is not enough give, so you feel the bottoms especially when you are wearing them.  I had to really tug the bottoms to get them in place. The top was a much easier fit.  I am athletic, 5'4 : 35, 28, 37  Short waisted and 132lbs....If that helps you decide.  For the cuteness factor and cost, I will wear for non-performance activities."
3.0,My toddler wears a size 6 so I ordered a 6. But when I received them they were huge. The shoes are beautiful but I would recommend ordering a size or two smaller.
3.0,Nice lightweight blouuse
3.0,"I like the set for the price, but unfortunately, the earring was broken. The necklace was a little shorter than I expected. I do plan to fix the earring and wear the set some day."
3.0,They are what they say they are.  However the elastic ties easily break
3.0,"I liked the HP design, but wearin’ one felt uncomfortable and hot.. def did not like it."
3.0,I bought these mask for the butterfly 🦋 design. The mask are made well but the design is trash.
3.0,"The mask fits most faces, but my face is slightly larger and it doesn't cover it enough."
3.0,This would have been a lovely necklace however the chain is a lot thicker than I wanted.  Also the chain is very lightweight.  I can’t tell if it’s real.  Nothing like the picture.  I like the charm but it the engraving is black.  I hope I can return it.  Way too expensive for what you get.
3.0,as expected fit
3.0,"It’s exactly like the the picture, unfortunately I had to sew in the side zipper 😕 over all my daughter loved it 😊"
3.0,"I just received these today and was disappointed in the size , they look like they should be for a 10 or 12 year old face ! The glasses are nice , Im going to give them to my Granddaughter."
3.0,Fell apart in wash. Buttons came off and they stretched out so can’t wear them.
3.0,Logo is silk screened and looks smaller and lighter than the one pictured. The hat material is a good quality and head band is a heavy cloth strap with buckle adjustment. I feel one washing could wash out the printed logo.
3.0,Smaller than expected but nice socks.
3.0,Love the style. My only complaint is the top gapes making it a little more revealing than I would have liked.  I tried tightening the lace on the back & tied it as tight as I could and it still didn't fix the problem.
3.0,"Super cute top and comfy.  Washed gentle, cold, hung to dry...washed up well this way.  But some drawbacks.  1.  The shoulders are too wide, they hang over my shoulders a bit.  I will fix this issue by gathering the top shoulder seam with my sewing machine, making the top even cuter!  2.  The front is about 2 inches longer than the back...at least on my shirt it is.  This I can't fix.  3.  It certainly is not green, not even an army green.  It is brown.  But that's fine, I like brown too.  Even with it's flaws, I like the shirt."
3.0,"i gave these Yellow box flip flops an okay rating only because they broke as soon as i put them on!  They are an awesomely comfortable brand of flip flops, but this pair had a stitching flaw and broke immedietly.  I didnt even leave my kitchen after putting them on. :(<br />the seller was understanding and refunded my money, i will order these again."
3.0,I don't like the material and it's more a wrap shirt fully open in the front
3.0,These are designed on the small side.
3.0,GLOW IN DARK  Scorpion  it ok I paid 11.99 then you see 6.95 felt cheated don't get me wrong should waited  instead of buying on impulse products ok  not worth $11.99 little smaller than expected
3.0,i was hoping it would be loose like in the picture
3.0,"As a wall hanger it is great but you would have to have a 3 foot long neck to even begin to display the print.  The material is not stretchy. It is well made and the material is good, nut not for a gaiter.  As a gaiter I give it 1/5 stars. As a wall hanger I give it 5/5. It is well made just no way you could ever wear it as a gaiter unless you have the head of a child and the neck of a Giraffe."
3.0,"Very cute bag yet was looking for true briefcase, not large handbag. Laptop would not fit. iPad maybe but not what I was looking for."
3.0,too small. baby had top user as a shirt.
3.0,"This was a cute, knee length sundress until I washed it. I now have a too small, mini dress. The skirt shrunk a good four inches! 😱"
3.0,these are VERY high waisted with a tiny waist band and wide bottom. these would fit great if you have a very small waist.
3.0,"Looking at the photo, I expected a burnt orange with the solid parts feeling more like a sweatshirt and the patterned part to be a woven fabric. Instead it's a very bright orange, there's no thick cuff as shown in the photo, and the material is a very slick synthetic variety. It's still soft inside and comfy, so I'll keep it. It just isn't what I thought I was ordering.  I ordered the large, and while it's loose and baggy, it'll leave room for a thin shirt under it."
3.0,Cute but we had to return because the clasp broke before it was even worn.
3.0,"It's really soft and comfortable, I just wish it would stay put. Everytime I remove my glasses it falls off, so it's another thing to remember."
3.0,Love the blouse but a little tight through shoulders and bust.
3.0,"Elastic gives a lot more than I am used to in suspenders (stretches easily and hence less support). Nothing wrong, just not as robust as I was hoping for the price. Good to find them in 54-55 inch size which is a plus for someone with a taller than average sitting height."
3.0,"Too big, looks better on Amazon site"
3.0,The actual chain is too long
3.0,Nice hoodie just runs small in my opinion. I purchased a 2XL and it was very snug in the mid section and hips.
3.0,"They stated that the shirt was ""true to size""  I ordered a 2XL and it fit like a 1XL!!!!!"
3.0,Looks way better in advert. Case looks very cheap. Expected better quality.<br />Subsequently wont be giving as gift any more!
3.0,Love this dress and how it fits but it is see through! There is no liner so you can see the dark polka dots on my underwear through this dress. I wanted to make this work and wanted to wear shorts under but you can see the outline of the shorts in the sun.
3.0,"After three days of school wear and tear there is a bunch of fraying on the mesh part in the center of the shoe. The strap is also kinda obnoxiously long. Like, it really didn’t need to be so long."
3.0,Kinda thin but not bad for the price.
3.0,"This product is a good concept, and it ends up getting the job done. But the quality could be a lot better for the price. If I turned the vertical poles tightly, the little v-shaped parts at top wouldn't quite line up for the horizontal poles to set straight. So the vertical ones had to be just shy of tight, making it a tad wobbly. One of the threads on the vertical poles was already stripped and wouldn't go in at all, so the grommet on top had to be taken off completely, which allowed it to go in better, but then the grommet of the corresponding pole also had to be removed for the height to be correct. Also, some of the bronze color was spotty. Ideally, I should have returned it. But it works well enough that it wasn't worth the bother to me, especially while I was in an organizing mood.  If it had cost less, it wouldn't have bugged me as much. The design does keep all the necklaces and bracelets from becoming tangled. Just be aware that if you have any magnetic parts on your jewelry (such as maganetic clasps or the magnetic half of a BFF necklace) that those will stick to the vertical poles if they are too close to them."
3.0,"I should have read the reviews closers. It's canvas and light brown.  It's very well made, but it's not really what I expected"
3.0,"This item was purchased for my mother who is a size 14 (Large) which should have been good.  Its a bit snug at the button closure.  I ordered a couple more colors from other places, so hopefully one of them will be 100%.  Since she is happy, all good."
3.0,These shorts run small so order up. I wish I had only purchased one pair first to see how they run instead is buying four. Costly lesson learned
3.0,Hard to twist on the backs.
3.0,Cute dress but it was way to big. Ordered the small and it hung on me and had no shape in the middle. There’s no Xs so I’m returning it.
3.0,Kind of chinsey not great
3.0,Very cheap tore within the first time i used it
3.0,gift for mom
3.0,Nice top<br />But runs small
3.0,"Bottoms are a little long, tops are starting to get the little balls on them after a few washes, not the quality you would expect for the price."
3.0,definitely not an XL fit more like a L
3.0,"The colors are great, the graphic is great, but unless I missed it in the description I was not aware that this was an iron on.  I quit buying iron on’s years ago because they didn’t hold up, after a few washes they would start to peel.  Hopefully they have improved over the years and will hold up better. I do feel it is overpriced for an iron on."
3.0,This gown is beautiful but I didn't like the back  am returning it for another gown
3.0,"Walking in these is slightly awkward, I probably won't buy them again. Not comfortable like other Skecher walk fit sandals."
3.0,"Not the fabric weight I expected. Super thin-see through easily. Will be good for warm weather days. Launders nicely—cool to warm water, dryer on low to air only or hang dry."
3.0,I bought the xxl after reading reviews which is good cause it just fits. I normally would wear a large. I wear medium to large tops and wear a size 10 pant or dress. The black halter straps cross over each other by a few inches in the middle and don't come out far enough to feel like my boobs are securely covered. They could pop out the side at any moment it feels. I will probably buy a shirt with shells printed over the boobs to wear with it and cut off the halter. All in all it was worth it just cause the cost of the fabric itself would have been more expensive for me then this dress but it's definitelynot perfect or high quality.
3.0,I wanted grocery bags that fit in my purse. Each  folded nicely but the bag itself was too small for groceries. I would say charge more and make them about the size of other recycle bags.
3.0,Love it very cute!! Based off of the reviews I ordered a small. I am a 00- 5'5. I was somewhat disappointed the back of my dress got a small hole along the seam. I only paid 7 dollars for it but still disappointing.
3.0,"Good quality shoes. At first glance the shoes seemed smaller than the size I requested but after a little pushing I realized that they are just more narrow than most shoes. After that the shoe is fine it’s just a bit of tight fit at first. However, I’m a bit disappointed in how these pair crease easily. Otherwise I’d given this a higher rating."
3.0,the dress got a whole in it while I was wearing it :(
3.0,"This is a nice bright color and the outside of the case seems sturdy.  I only gave this product 3 stars because the inside of the case seems like it is flimsily made.  I am curious to see how it holds up.  I have no idea if it is really protecting my cards, but it make me feel better.  I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review."
3.0,"Nice in everyway, except the fabric is too heavy for me."
3.0,"Be sure to read previous reviews. Not made to last, pocket tore after 3rd time wearing. Other than durability, iI love it, just needed to give it some extra TLC with the sewing kit."
3.0,"This is my second pair of these. I have a larger pair for my daughter. I tested this one for my son. I had the same problem with these. They rub on the back of the heel if you wear them for longer than an hour or so. They are super light and fit snug enough to not come off in the water but not too tight. The back part should be smoother though, or have a liner on it. That part rubs on the back of the heel and both my kids complain about it.<br /><br />Now, as a water shoe it is great! It dries in hours or quicker if you use a hair dryer. It would be great on the beach. Whenever those open up again... He used these in the kids pool and they did the job great. No scratched feet on the rough pool bottom. He had traction walking around the pool deck as well. You could easily wear these in and out of the ocean and then right onto the boardwalk. In fact, that is exactly what I wanted these for. The virus messed up those plans, so I had to test these in the pool. If I get a chance at all I will update these reviews to show you how they work at the beach.<br /><br />I would still recommend them because they protect the feet nicely. I would just caution you that you can't wear them long, or you will need to put a bandage on their heel first so they don't rub. Mine came in a little plastic zip bag that I use to store them in, but I am not sure if that is the standard or not. They would be so easy to take on a trip since they have no weight and take up like no space. They are very flexible soles too."
3.0,Looks cheaply made.
3.0,"Looks nice and probably fits most women well, but if you're small-chested (like me) then this dress won't be as flattering up top."
3.0,The light only lit up 1/3 of the watch face. My husband has been wearing this same watch for decades and has never had this issue until now.
3.0,"Dress is nice, fit is ok. Material dress is made of will likely peel. The dress is pretty but not likely to last the entire summer."
3.0,"As much as I wanted to love these shoes (they are adorable, super high quality, and are incredibly easy for my 2.5 year old to put on), I had to return them. Once my son put these on with his SMOs, he couldn’t walk up and down stairs. I had his physical therapist observe him and she said it was because these shoes went too far up his ankle and were restricting his mobility. Once he put on a different pair of sneakers, he had no problem on the steps so it seems as though she was right. I may buy the lower (non-high-top) version of these shoes in the future because I love how easy they are for my son to put on by himself."
3.0,The breast cups are a little werid but I am happy overall with it.
3.0,After having this necklace for 5 days the chain broke.  Too difficult to return as it was a gift and she is unable to package and send back.  Cute charm.
3.0,Size and quality of this product is not as I expected.
3.0,"They must be okay on most toddlers, but the 2T-4T was way too big for our nearly 3 year old.  She wears a size 7 child's shoe for reference. They have no shape and the sock slips and slides around her foot making the anti-slip tread on the bottom pointless"
3.0,I had to use a broad belt to get it to work.
3.0,You can only wear this item as a dress if you are short. I'm tall and it works as a long tunic but its way too short to be a dress. The fabric is thin and stretchy. The olive green is not as dark as what is shown.
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this bag so I'm just going to list the pros and cons.<br />Pro: The color is beautiful and vibrant<br />  The leather is very soft and looks great<br />  Plenty of pockets<br />  Strap is a comfortable length,  good for me as I have a long torso<br />Con: Much smaller than expected<br />  The opening for the main compartment is very narrow, which makes it difficult to use- can just barely fit my wallet, eyeglass case and a few other small items<br />  The front pocket snaps do not have a smooth cap covering the back, will scratch anything you put in it. Learned the hard way- it scratched my phone,  thankfully I had a screen protector on."
3.0,"One of the sprayers was faulty, so I only have 2 bottles that I can use."
3.0,Bought it as a gift my BFF loved it
3.0,"Nice gloves for the price. Yes, there is a smell problem so don't expect to wear them at least a week, because you might need like a week to air it out. Overall it was not a disappointing buy."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, very well made. But, why does the bust have to be so huge & made like an iron cage? Just because I have hips & a larger belly, does not mean my bust starts at my waist & ends at my neck! I love the dress style but am really sad that I don't have a huge bust!"
3.0,Not a big fan...it's really short and the material is shiny like a swimsuit.
3.0,"Crinkles a lot when wearing it, ok for outdoors, but not inside anywhere."
3.0,The metal is very thin. It’s very cute but I don’t think it is going to hold up a long time.
3.0,I had bought another pair of pants from this brand and loved them so thought I’d try these out. They are very comfortable but in order for them to fit in the legs (which they do) the waist is a little big.<br /><br />Despite being similar material to leggings the waistband does not really huh your body like I’d have liked. These are good for a job where you sit down all day but the second I walked around the grocery store they were saggy and falling down.
3.0,"Material is thicker than expected and itchy. 5’7”, 165#, XL fit but clingy. I would say true to size but the design is belly-climgy like other dresses with this cut."
3.0,Beautiful! And the fit is very flattering. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because the gold string belt broke in half on the first loop around. Which is upsetting considering it makers the entire outfit.
3.0,"Smaller then I thought, but pretty!"
3.0,"Cute goggles, overall good but unfortunately :<br /><br />- THEY DO LEAK  they do not fit well my face because the bridge around the nose part is not adjustable and too small for me ... because of that, the rubber around my right eye doesn't fit and adjust well, hence the water leak.<br /><br />- They CAN get foggy.<br />obviously the anti fog part is only due to a grease that is applied inside the googles, I always spit in them like old timer swimmers do, the grease went away quicly and they became foggy ... I guess this one is my bad ? had I known ..."
3.0,"This fits more like a casual top. It is quite baggy around the top edge under the arms. The bottom band was fairly snug and didn't have a whole lot of stretch. The neck was cute. I liked the color. It wasn't what I was looking for (mainly due to the baggy top edge), so I opted to return."
3.0,Cute shoes perfect for school. While I like the look and LOVE the fact that the soles are really slip resistant; they ARE NOT leather and fasten via velcro (aka the buckle is for aesthetics)
3.0,These gloves are thin and pill quickly.  I would purchase only for warm climate where there is an occasional need for gloves.
3.0,smaller than anticipated. The rubber dots fall off easily too. Kids like them though.
3.0,"The fabric and style was ok, I didn’t realize the front buttons were this cheap aluminum like thing… it was not cute at all. I considered replacing the buttons but it wasn’t worth the hassle."
3.0,I dislike it there is no instructions on how to use the product...
3.0,I wash all clothes before putting them on her body. This time the PJs shrunk to look like it was 12 months verses 3T.
3.0,it's made of very flimsy material and keeps rotating around
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:246f52bce15aca4fd194378d53cad3e6]] The fabric is super soft and comfortable, combined with no straps digging into my shoulder it’s almost weightless. Unfortunately every time I make arm movements it rides up and I’m constantly tugging it back down. Good for lounging around the house, I don't recommended for public outings or any physical activity. Also, I took the removable padding out simply because I’m not a fan."
3.0,The material is kinda itchy which bothers my sensitive skin.
3.0,The fit was small for an average size American male.
3.0,Ok I’m kinda stuck on this one because I like it but it’s just not firm enough for my giggley breast
3.0,"Love the design, shirt feels rough, and after 1 wash it shrunk. It now is a wear around the house shirt"
3.0,Dont care for the seem in my crack
3.0,Ok but see thru
3.0,These are ok. The quality is pretty low. But they are socks and they work. I’m writing this so people know that this is not a good quality fluffy sock. It’s the type of sock you wools buy at a swap meet.  It also has taken several washes to get the smell of plastic out of it.
3.0,"These necklaces are of only 'okay' quality. I could have made them myself. However,  I do wear them often and enjoy their uniqueness."
3.0,Great company that settles differences efficiently and effectively
3.0,The hat looks just like the picture.  Great color scheme.  The only problem is It arrived with a strong chemical smell.
3.0,I ordered three different hats.  I am keeping the other two.  This one was just okay.  Not bad but not as cute as the others and it did fit large.
3.0,"Product was delivered on time, pricing was fair for what was being sold and the gemstones are glass not paint or epoxy resin that looks like gems. 1 nose ring arrived without the stone attached so hoping that is not a prelude to how they will all be."
3.0,These were huge!  Went from ABT spotlights 2 to a size 3 and it was like 5 sizes different.  They are not leather as advertised.  We returned them.
3.0,"Pretty color, nicely sized but sooooo wrinkly!  Also not at all flattering if you have ANY behind what so ever.  I am 5'8&#34; & 145lbs.  evenly proportioned so bummed cant be ironed or looks bad on.  On a slender straight shaped high school girl; maybe?"
3.0,"Their Ok, were smaller than i expected not plugs style"
3.0,Quality was ok. fit as expected.
3.0,One pair is larger than the over and both are the “same size”. I ordered a medium and should have gotten a small
3.0,"I ordered a small — the length of the shirt was like how it’s on the model, but the collar part was more fitted (not so much draping off the shoulder). As one person reviewed, the shirt itself is not tie dyed, but more of a tie dye print.  Overall, I think it’s a good shirt casual shirt for lounging/hanging out."
3.0,I like the socks but the description was for 3 pairs and I only received 2.
3.0,"I do like that the circumference of the hat can be adjusted to fit your child's head size. But the problem is that the brim of the hat is so big and floppy, that it blocks the child's vision. I understand that the brim needs to be large to block the sun, but it was more a problem than a help. I wouldn't get this hat again."
3.0,"Product was beautiful. Nice print nice fabric. In photo look flowy. I ordered an XXL, It was tight to the body not flowy."
3.0,I love these but I'm only giving 3 stars because they start to move up. I have to constantly readjust.
3.0,It came crushed and creased
3.0,Very very very short.
3.0,Very very large. Decent quality for the price.
3.0,Great ring but too big!
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful white lace dress, however, way too much fabric below the waist, and extremely long. I am 5'3&#34; and the dress would need at least 4-5 inches cut off at the bottom. I was going to give it to a friend, who is very tall, and would not need the dress hemmed, but unfortunately the top part did not fit her. So, unfortunately, I have to return the dress."
3.0,My daughter liked it well enough. Definitely get the insert that is not included as it doesn't really look like a mermaid tail without it
3.0,This is a really nice mask but luckily I know how to sew because this mash is way too large.  Maybe it shouldn’t be unisex
3.0,"So this comes flat and you have to reconstruct it to be a halo. Not too hard, but it never seems to be completely straight; it always has a bit of a ""weave"" to it. That being said, it'll do in a pinch. The lights aren't too bright, but I wore this to work under fluorescents, so might be brighter under regular lighting and even better under dim lighting at a party. This is even versatile enough to double for Christmas. The headband was a bit tight, but seemed to loosen a tiny bit over time. All in all, not too bad, but not the best. Meh."
3.0,"The hat looks and feels very nice with a comfy liner.  The texture is good and quality seems very good.  I returned because I though it fit odd on me.  Didn't come down far enough on my head, seemed a bit short."
3.0,This is cool to wear during the HOT Az summer but it would be nice if it were a little bit looser. At the end of a 9 hour shift my feet hurt.  I went without them one day to test to see if it were the shoes my feet did not hurt.  can you get these in a bigger size??  thank you
3.0,Not a fan of the polyester material. Other than that it fits good.
3.0,"I love the colors, it’s just really thin."
3.0,I recommend to size up. I’m returning this item
3.0,I didn’t think it was very user friendly.  The straps are too big and zippers are hard to open.
3.0,This shirt is only so-so. I'm sending mine back because I didn't like the fit. The button and v-neck is way higher than I expected and it made the whole shirt look weird.
3.0,"I am 5'2 and about 150 lbs, I ordered a large and it was too small, I returned it and ordered an XL. The top fit but the bottoms were still way too small! Also the bottoms do not look like they do in the picture. But the top is cute so I'm going to keep it anyway"
3.0,"DO NOT roll down your windows while these are on!!! They WILL fall off.<br />I was really excited when these came so I put them on my car as soon as I could. Not even an hour later, as I was driving around, it being December, I had the heater on in my car. It got a little too hot, so I opened the window a bit to let in some cold air and one of the antlers fell off. I tried to retrieve it as soon as I could but by the time I got to it, it was run over by a few cars and the piece that attached it to the window broke. I was really disappointed but there was nothing I could do.<br />They looked cute while they lasted, but they won't allow you to lower your windows."
3.0,"The customer service for the seller is great and I received these in a timely fashion.  But, I'm disappointed in the design.  I didn't know the front was what screwed off and not the ball in the back (I should have read the reviews) and they were difficult to get on because the ball is also very small so it was hard to grip and twist the front on.  It literally took 20 minutes to get them in one ear.  But, now that they are in, I love the way they look so I will keep them.  But probably would not buy another pair.  One also randomly fell out at the gym last night, but could have not been screwed in right because, as mentioned, it was a little hard."
3.0,Husband doesn't really care for the way it closes
3.0,Made it a gift to my daughter since it would not fit my hand. The largest size would not fit my pinky. They run about two sizes smaller then other places.
3.0,"Very cute dress, easy fit.  Though after first wash, dress looked pretty rough.  Attached is a closeup photograph of the dress after only two washings.  I suggest hand-washing and hang-drying if you want to keep the dress nicer, longer."
3.0,The stone was bigger than I expected.
3.0,Needs to be redesigned so that the exterior pockets are mesh or stretchy.  Will NOT hold a water bottle.
3.0,The dress looks good one of the button holes is sewed shut so it doesn’t work
3.0,Flattering. Nice material. Odd cut in the top and skirt but it flatters my body shape so I’ll throw a tank under it and call it good. I’m 5’6 and pretty chubby.
3.0,"Received in ample time, the fabric wasn’t exactly what I thought it was. I should have read the details better but the fabric is thin and starchy.  Fits great, I’m in between a medium and large and I went with the large and it fit how I expected."
3.0,Very big and bulky really not as expected
3.0,I had to return the pants because they did not have the crease. I really like the fabric and the stitching<br />But without the crease they did not look like work pants. I wish I can confidently  re-order then if what I get is the same style described because it would be a great wardrobe addition
3.0,"I got this to wear under a cycling helmet in colder weather in the north eastern US. It’s fine on it’s own - though mighty synthetic for smart wool, BUT under a helmet it puts pressure on glasses/ears. A design that doesn’t press on glasses/ears is a magical thing I guess.  Alas."
3.0,Pretty but stiff. I didn't like the shape
3.0,"I'm 5'4, 150lbs - I normally wear Medium so I ordered the Medium.  I had to return this cute outfit because the jacket fit ok (almost too small but because of the style it looked fine) BUT the pants were way too long and big.  I'm not that short and I have curves and thick thighs so its usually never a problem filling up pants especially made of this material.  I had to pull them up to right under my breasts and there was still a lot of material bunched up at my ankles and it wasn't tight or form fitting at all.  I wish I could've sized down but then the jacket would be too small/tight."
3.0,"It doesn't open, which is disappointing, and pretty pricey for plastic and stickers. Grandson liked it but way overpriced for a plastic box with stickers!"
3.0,The dress goes up a lot while walking and doesn’t stay in place often
3.0,It came with a defect. I sent it back!
3.0,I have had Bella Taylor wristlet wallets in the past and loved them.  This one arrived with a broken clasp.
3.0,The logo is very big (and heavy).<br />The fabric it's printed on is lightweight.... if you tie it in the back  it makes it work
3.0,"Since text started peeling right away, don't recommend it"
3.0,Shipped quickly however the quality isn't that great
3.0,"I love the way the feel, but the problem is how they force my foot forward in the shoe just enough to cause heel slip in my running shoes."
3.0,Smaller than expected compared to my other leggings
3.0,"Well made, just wish they had been properly sized. The sizing was off by at least 2 sizes, way too small. so I had to send them back. Otherwise, they would have been 5 star!"
3.0,The chain is quite fragile with no hoop for the clasp.
3.0,Fit nice. Too short . Cute though gonna wear w leggings
3.0,It is nice but a little small for a large
3.0,My only reservation was that it said it was nine inches which my 6'3&#34; guy needed.  It was that size barely if you measured with it open and measured from point to point which you lose nearly 3/4 inch when you fasten it.
3.0,Difficult to separate for opening.  Too wide for some remote keys.
3.0,The material is very thin. Speedy delivery
3.0,"One of the ties was hanging by a thread. I hand-sewed it on but the ribbon is so cheap it kind of shredded under my needle. The fur trim is really sparse and cheap. For the price and to wear it for one day outside delivering presents, it’ll work but it would be somewhat tacky looking if I wore it to an important party."
3.0,Not high quality material
3.0,"Really wish you could adjust where and how the speakers sit.  They never line up with my ears, always sitting behind.  Designed for small heads.  Probably works better for children?"
3.0,I like this dress but the skirt material is stiffer than expected. Overall it's cute but the bottom is not flowy
3.0,I ordered a size larger than my size and it fits as if i ordered a small for a teen. Had to gift it out to another person. But very pretty garment.
3.0,"Not the easiest to use if you have arthritis.  However, it is a very handy, useful gadget!  I rated this based on my own personal experience using it...so to be fair, those w/out arthritis will absolutely love this product.  A great gift, for sure!"
3.0,They smelled like petroleum and run half size large.  They aren't flexible as the bottoms are made of wood covered with plastic or heavy plastic.  Clunky and the bottoms are very smooth so be careful wearing them on floors. You may slip and fall on your butt!
3.0,"Looks great, takes a while to soften up."
3.0,Good quality but not a fan of the holes. They are circle cut outs. Not distressed at all. I returned
3.0,I wear an XL and I got a XXL it's a tight fit when it's buttoned up. And the buttons on the coat are barely sewn on so you might want to reinforce them befor they pop off.
3.0,"I ordered this Women's Sexy Off Shoulder Lace Blouse Shirt Long Sleeve V-Neck Tank Top in the black and white and it is super cute, BUT WAY TOO SMALL.  This runs small, China's sizing is way different than the US. But because the shirt appears to be on the baggier side (based on the shirt the model is wearing), I thought I could fit in a 3XL, since I wear a 16-18 regular. NOT even close. It is tight around the bust area and the sleeves are really snug on me.  It is definitely short in the length too. it would be a great belly shirt. I will probably hand this down to my daughter who wears a small."
3.0,"I know these are supposed to be oversized frames but these take that style a bit too far for me. They’re so big I can even look down because the weight of them causes them to slide down my nose.<br />Other than being huge, I can say they are solidly made. I feel like these glasses are meant more for being a costume accessory. I will post photos so you can see what I mean."
3.0,"I’m a sucker for the perfect white tee shirt- only this wasn’t it! I love the idea it’s recycled material.. but I’m thinking maybe that’s why it felt a bit off? Soft yet, stiff- which is not an easy thing to do!! Cut in “boyfriends style” one expects a looser fit.. only this was ‘big’ in most of the wrong places- sort of a mismatch of measurements. Shoulders don’t have any drop like most in this style and sleeves were cut short and standard style. But, body was as wide as a box- very unbecoming to any female curve.. makes one look wider throughout the middle and I don’t know a female who appreciates that! Tbh, it is the neckline that totally shut me down.. a cross between a V-neck, scoop and standard- a trifecta of off.. it looked as confusing as I felt.<br /><br />For $27- this was a higher price for a T-shirt that missed the mark. I realize body type plays a part and so does personal preference. I also appreciate recycled aspect.. hence the a star for each. Definitely some likes/dislikes to consider prior to ordering- hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone.<br /><br />**For reference: I’m 5’2”, 151lb, 38C, 31x30, 40+ yr. with my trouble spot thru middle/waist area (all thx to my x4 kids and gravity..!!) ordered an XL- to help with size comparison."
3.0,Very dainty and nice
3.0,"Item arrived quickly , was sized as mentioned , and the colors were great . However , the burgundy pair seems to have black marker or greasy spot on them ."
3.0,"The clip for money it's kind of weak, breaks very easy . Tryna take out the cards is very hard but it keep it very well. If the clip didn't break it would be a 5 of 5 stars."
3.0,The pants fit as aspected but the jacket is to small.
3.0,"Comfortable but too tight and long. I had to return it and get next size up. Bought it for 13 year old,  who weighs 70 lbs and 5""3."
3.0,sizing is off on this dress. going back.
3.0,Cool fun summer dress
3.0,"I can't tell if it's too big or fits right, it's just weird. One of those pieces of clothing you keep just in case it fits at some weight better than it does at others. Really cute, just a weird fit but I'm not prepared to give up on it."
3.0,They look nice enough but the balls are a little bigger than I would have preferred and quite heavy which makes your earlobes sag which is one of my pet peeves. I will probably rarely wear them for this reason.
3.0,It is a nice little bracelet except it snag's on everything.
3.0,This is a very nice purse but the zipper does not last long at all. I do have a small purse like the larger one but I had to send it back. I will be getting  buying another one.
3.0,The gold color turns dark very fast
3.0,"I think this could look good, but I just didn’t like the fabric. It felt artificial and stiff- reminded me of the fabric they use for costumes. The style wasn’t for me because I need to be able to move my arms around and the neckline prohibits this. Was a very pretty pattern and design though!"
3.0,"I was impressed with the look of the bag and how roomy the interior was, however, the handles have started to fray and pull apart at the seems on one side of the bag and I only use the bag for my laptop and the power cord.  I'm very disappointed."
3.0,They look good. One pair came in good condition but the other one had uneven arms and made the glasses sit very crooked on my face. I unscrewed them and re attached them but the arms themselves were uneven.
3.0,Little tight im sure they will stretch. But atm my wife does like them
3.0,Not big enough in bust for me and that makes the halter too tight around my neck. I had to make some adjustments on the straps and pin them on the back and a criss cross that makes it at least comfortable to wear for $20 it's okay
3.0,Runs way small!  I usually wear a l/xl and ordered a xxl and it was still to small.  The bottoms have no kind of coverage.  Cute suit but didnt work out for me.
3.0,I have an 18mm spring bars. The pins would not go into the holes. The band ends were too thick to fit into the lugs of the watch.
3.0,"Watch has a large clear display. It’s very easy to set up without instructions, however for me it’s too thick, heavy, and large for everyday use. I can feel it weighing on my wrist. I was planning on using this watch for work. I don’t think I can have this on an entire shift without becoming uncomfortable. Of course the low price is awesome but I’m returning it."
3.0,Cute runs a little small
3.0,The color is different
3.0,Way Small
3.0,"Both ends screw on/off, so I am worried it will bust off at the gem end. We'll see"
3.0,I would give this bangle a 5 but the sizing is off. I purchased a xl and its very small. It must be a xl for a child size. Its a beautiful bangle but its the correct size. Not worth the trouble sending it back. I will just keep it and give it as a gift.
3.0,Quality good runs small
3.0,"I'm happy with the laces , but the order said there would be two pair and I only received one. Pretty spendy for one pair of laces. I could have gotten them cheaper.  I would have given 5 Stars if I had gotten my entire order"
3.0,"Be weary, it’s not a typical tactical hat. It does not have a name tape Velcro on the back, but has a square Velcro about the size of a military rank patch. I do like the hat itself for the money."
3.0,"Design is nice, it feels comfortable but the fabric is not thick enough so you kind of see through."
3.0,a little to short but it'll do.
3.0,"I loved them as soon as I got them, but after a few wears they started to wear at the seams. I love the fit, I just wish they lasted longer!"
3.0,Wife's Review: The shirt is cute but the fabric is very thin and requires an undergarment. It would function well as a maternity shirt but I don't prefer such styles when not pregnant! I'm 5 ft 7 and 150 lbs. It might work better on a different body type.
3.0,Don't like the material. .
3.0,"Just how cheap they look, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,ordered a little too big.
3.0,Very hard to get over hand and onto wrist without taking band apart. Hard to get back together.
3.0,"Okay I love this dress. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I ordered it for a special occasion and put it on and the elastic connector that closes the button broke. So I had to wear the dress with the broken button closure because I didn't have time to mess with it. And it was the first time wearing the dress. It was disappointing. However I received so many compliments on the dress. It was pretty, comfortable and I love it. Another thing to note is the yellow is very sheer and you will need a slip underneath or the world will see more of you then they should. I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. I have to figure out what to do with the button closure. 🙃"
3.0,"I would like to give this dress five stars because I liked the picture a lot, but when I wore it it was loose at the waist and very long, well , usually I wear long dresses with high heels but this dress is longer than expected and loose to the extent that it impedes movement but the color is very beautiful and exactly matches the picture and the decoration at the chest is wonderful and I loved it. I recommend to follow the size chart but be aware to the length. And one more thing which is very important to know that the dress arrived on time."
3.0,"Thin material, smaller than expected. I returned this dress. Looks cute in the picture but not on. Would not recommend."
3.0,"Oh I love them, but one of my earrings has a stone missing. Packaging was impressive!  Have them on as we speak."
3.0,When items say fit items that doesn't mean they fit everyone. It felt like a glove on me gave it to my daughter
3.0,Does have seam.
3.0,Ordered 2 sizes up after reading reviews. So needed a 9/10 . Received Item and it was very snug and the sleeves on the rash guard are very short. After investigating I realized they actually sent me the size Large so equivalent to the 7/8. I would say the size 7/8 actually runs like a 4/5.<br />It will work and it get the job done but would have liked to return to get what I actually ordered however everything was sold out. Giving it a 3 star because it would have been a great swim suit if I would have received the size I ordered. The quality of the material was amazing.
3.0,smaller than I expected. Quality average.Picture is better.
3.0,Bigger then I thought they would be
3.0,"Nice material, but they are a little shorter than I expected."
3.0,"The pendant is pretty but the chain is flimsy. I popped it opening the packaging.<br /> Also, it took a very, very, long time to receive it."
3.0,These shorts are nice. I purchased two pairs. Only reason for the 3 stars is that on one pair of shorts the zipper doesn’t work so the pocket is useless and we didn’t discover it until we had already removed the tags. Super bummed about that. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
3.0,"It's good, it looks the same in person as you see it online.<br />Shipped way earlier then expected.<br />Overall pretty good :)<br /><br />9/2/14<br />Ring turned silver smh."
3.0,Cute earring.  It's not as long as I thought it would be. It's still a beauty though and will turn heads
3.0,Gift for my girlfriend. She was a little disappointed that they didn't have a bigger size. She uses it to keep warm.
3.0,Nice but I realized the colour is changing
3.0,Loose in the neck area so great for anyone with a larger chin and neck.
3.0,They were very flimsy and feel like tbey will break easily. The case and cleaning cloth was great.
3.0,Beautiful necklace but came with a darker spot in the middle. Got it for my daughter for her birthday and didn't expect to see a dark spot in the middle of the pink stone. By the time it was noticed i could not return it or exchange it. Guess we will have to put up with the spot. Very disappointed.
3.0,I advise to size up. They fit on but are a struggle getting in to because theyre so tight.
3.0,"The one I received was not nearly as pretty as the one pictured. I know it says the stones are all different, but I was disappointed. Not sure if I'll keep it or not.  I really wanted a Rhodonite."
3.0,cost to much
3.0,I gave it three stars only because it does not fit my fingers runs small.  Pretty and good gold tone.
3.0,The fit of this product is great for a small waist. Great quality. The color however is much lighter than this picture and won't go with the outfit I ordered it for.
3.0,balls are blue and teardrop bluish green
3.0,This mask fits kind of awkwardly.  But it worked for the costume I was wearing in a play.  It is reversible.
3.0,Ordered a size up and they are still a bit snug.
3.0,"The top is huge but the shorts are awesome.  I would order 5 pairs of just the shorts if I could! I really wanted some super comfortable pajama shorts that I could wear around the house. Pockets were a must.  These shorts are perfect.<br />I have plenty of pajama tops so I didn't need the top anyway, but it is HUGE.  I am 5'6&#34; 115 lbs and not large-chested, but come on, I ordered the small, the smallest size they have, and this top is for someone twice my size. I shortened the straps as much as I possibly could and the shirt is still way too low and has all kinds of side boob hanging out. YIKES!  I had to tie big knots in the straps to pull them up enough that the top is wearable. But this is just annoying and uncomfortable. So I end up never wearing the top.<br />I also ordered the shorts with the racer tank top and the t-shirt top, and they are both HUGE as well.  If you are a smaller person and looking at the different top options, I would definitely get the T-shirt option.  It's still huge but at least boob isn't exposed like on the other two styles of tops."
3.0,They were a little thin. For the price they were good but not the solid metal I was expecting.
3.0,"Got this for my daughter who is obsessed with Ryan. My biggest complaint is with one shirt only. The red shirt, which happens to be my daughters favorite color. The image was somewhat faded, however after 1 wash 70% of the image is now gone. I'm not sure what happened, the other 2 were fine and still are after multiple washes. Such a shame since Ryan stuff isn't cheap."
3.0,This hat is really nice but the control box is really thick and bulky. I don't think I would buy it again.
3.0,"The Dress is cute but does run small. I ordered a size bigger and still small. It wasn't flattering on me. I will be returning.  Had it fit to my liking and looked good on me I would keep it. I love the material, and the design. It's cute. But I'm very self conscious and I didn't feel comfortable in the dress. It hugged to tight,  making my bottom and top look 10 times bigger which I don't like, especially since I got this for Easter Sunday at church. I went with another dress. But would be cute on someone smaller else just not me."
3.0,Very cute bathing suit.  Didn't quite fit well around my chest area.  I always felt like I was going to flash someone because it was loose there.  I'm a C Cup and it just doesn't fit right for me.  The rest of it fit my body perfect.
3.0,"My foot is a mens 13, this boot runs narrow. I bought them to pour concrete and after an hour they gave me blisters."
3.0,"Adorable, but it does not breathe very well and the material makes your face hot. I really want to love this mask but I'm disappointed."
3.0,"I thought these earrings would be larger and more substantial in feel - so, I am disappointed. Still will keep them."
3.0,"Zippers are backwards (puller is on left)  so I'm guessing these are really women's jackets...  The fit definitely runs small as many have noted. Get a size larger! The elastic wrist is a bit uncomfortable for my tastes and I feel for the price, one could get something better. I purchased this for the turtle neck to wear under my motorcycle jacket when riding in the colder weather so it'll work, just not nearly as nice as the fleece tech $25 jacket it was supposed to replace."
3.0,These run pretty small. Not what I expected.
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and 130 lbs. I ordered a medium and it was way too big. It actually fell straight to the floor. As far as quality, it was a pretty dress, just be sure to order down a size."
3.0,I love this product but it took over 4 weeks to come in. That’s why I gave it a three.
3.0,"Unfortunately, I bought the wrong size"
3.0,The outfit itself is just add the picture I'm a med ordered a large and the torso is to small!
3.0,Felt awkwardly heavy on my ears. I was disappointed
3.0,The quality is not the best
3.0,"Cute print, love that it has pockets, material not really comfy/stretchy at all so it will stretch at seams eventually. returned."
3.0,"Very nice and comfortable slippers. However, run extremely big. I am size 8 and my feet are not exactly narrowed. I ordered a size Medium (size 7-8) and it fits very loose, my foot comes out every time I walk in these."
3.0,I ordered the five pack but the white was missing. Giving three stars for the fact it’s inconvenient to have to order a replacement and send these back. Sizing is pretty accurate.
3.0,Good compression comfortable but do not breath feet feel hot and sweaty
3.0,Runs small would go up almost two sizes…
3.0,I didn't really like the material...made it look a little cheap.
3.0,"It’s a great belt, very good quality. The only thing wrong with it is the sizes seem to run a little on the small size. My waist is a 33 I ordered a 40 in the belt and it barley fits. I can only get it to the 3rd hole"
3.0,"Leather is kind of tough, but ok based on affordability."
3.0,"I ordered a size 7m which is a half size smaller than my usual size.  A previous reviewer mentioned they ran big.  The length was just right, but the width was so narrow a child could barely fit into it.  In the 10 minutes I had these on, the dye from the suede tinted my hands and feet black.  The style is cute, and I can tell if they were a good fit they'd be a super comfy shoe.  The buttons are also just pinned on so you can change them out to bedazzle the shoe with whatever you're feeling that day."
3.0,"Pretty dress, but too big and too long"
3.0,"The mask itself fits strangely when on, bunching in odd places with the wire pinching the jaws. But, it's easy to carry on the wrist when one doesn't have pockets, so it balances out."
3.0,I just received it. It's much bigger then the 3 mm I had before. Big disappointment. Totally not satisfied. It is pretty but looks big for a necklace.
3.0,No second hand and can’t tell the date of the month
3.0,"It gets the job done, but is not resistant at all"
3.0,"I like the shirt because of who it's honoring but the make and material of the shirt could have been better, very thin opposed to the authentic jersey.."
3.0,I checked too small because it is way too short to wear as a dress.
3.0,Not as large or as stretchy as I had hoped.
3.0,Lasted for a few months before the stones fell out in places on the ring.
3.0,"Like it's design,soft,and compact. Just too pricey for something that is not true quality. You could find something like this a dollar store."
3.0,"Nice quality, but heavy. About the size of a dime."
3.0,El precio bien
3.0,Way larger than expected. I’m 5’5 108 lb & the xs was still a bit large on me :( fit well in the bust though! Wish the drawstring actually functioned...
3.0,Very sparsely pretty but it is not as big as you think they are smaller.
3.0,The bra itself isn't bad looking. But they run SUPER small. I have a VERY tiny rib cage and have a hard time finding bras that are small enough around. This one is so tight it hurts. Definitely buy a bigger size.
3.0,"Fabric is kinda scratchy for sensitive legs, but it has nice weight. It's a little long so I may have to get it tailored."
3.0,"I love the feel of this shirt, the style & look. I bought XL which fit well everywhere but the sleeves. The sleeves were about an inch too short on my arms when they were at my sides & about 3 inches too short when I raised my arms. I know my arms are a bit longer than average, but it looked awful, so I’m returning it. One of the front buttons also had a big chip out of it.<br />On the positive side, I purchased the green & the shade was fantastic!"
3.0,"Fit more like leggings than joggers, just no stretch in legs. I'm not even sure if the waist fit right because I couldn't get them up my legs completely. Will be returning."
3.0,"It,s nice"
3.0,"Fits on the large side. I would have exchanged it for a smaller size, but I needed it for an event. I put it in the dryer to try and shrink it some..."
3.0,"Nice looking watch, but need to put more effort on the mechanism.. Watch is alway stops"
3.0,"These were fine if used around a swimming pool to keep your feet from being scraped. I made the mistake of using them for hiking through water and wet rocky areas. if that is what you need, buy something more substantial!"
3.0,"The fit isn't great. The right strap is still way too big even though I ordered a small. I adjusted the strap to the smallest setting and still too long!  I also feel like I'm going to have a nip slip if I lift my left arm. It's such a cute dress, just not made great."
3.0,Too clingy. Not a big fan of this top on me.
3.0,"I bought a Medium for my 11 year-old daughter. It was perfect right out of the package. Then, I washed it and it has shrunken so much that it no longer fits my daughter. I should've gotten an XL to allow for shrinkage."
3.0,it came smaller than expected
3.0,"this item was very thin, didn't like"
3.0,"I am very short and from advertisement expected the top to be much longer.  Also, I ordered the aqua and received white."
3.0,Broke almost immediately  great style
3.0,Runs small to size. Not for children who are over 5 feet tall.
3.0,I feel like I should have ordered a size up then I did. Usually my kids feet in sandels are different then in regualer shoes.
3.0,"I was hoping that the stones would be bigger, but when I added my solitare to the guard, It looked beautiful."
3.0,"I have no idea what material this dress is but it feels more like a scuba suit. Pretty pattern, fit is ok, just not the material I was expecting. Definitely not for use on a hot or humid day."
3.0,"cute, but runs small"
3.0,"Kiddo loved these, as they are a huge marie fan... But they are not top quality. Being white they get dirty easily...<br /><br />So they won't last for forever, but will be _very_ popular during their lifespan. How long they last is really up to the wear and tear your kid puts on them... Ours happens to be pretty active and wore them outside a lot, your mileage may vary."
3.0,"Very cute shirt! Looks exactly like the picture, but I ordered a small and I swear it's a medium or large. It's rather big, but I can still make it work. I suggest ordering a size down."
3.0,super cute! holds everything I need . Only issue is the zippers feel a bit tight.
3.0,Cute socks. Thin fit in dress shoes nicely.
3.0,Nice scarf. Not the quality that I expected though.
3.0,"These tank tops are perfect to wear under a dressy shirt and they're also good for working out or casual wear. However, the material tends to crawl up and curl up if you're wearing your exact size. I ordered smalls since I'm built small, and in the middle of the evening, it rode up my stomach. They are super comfy and perfect fit, but depending on how you sit or what you wear over them, they have a tendency to shift around."
3.0,"Even though they fit perfectly, they are slightly too short."
3.0,"I wear 10 1/2 women's shoe and needed a very lightweight shower shoe that would dry quickly and not soak up water. Nothing in the women's dept matched so I tried these. I ordered a 9 which I wear in men's shoes but the fit is slightly longer and wider than a 9 - are 11 inches long and weigh 6.1 oz.  Since they are very lightweight and don't soak up water which is great for travel, I am not returning. You also need to de-gas them outside a few days when you remove from the bag."
3.0,It looked worn-out on the first day.  Wasn't as long as I thought it was.
3.0,Wear a size 10. Normally considered a Med or Lg. But the large size in these Joggers was wayyyy too small. Exchanged for the Extra Large and these are even a bit snug.
3.0,The stickiness was fine but it’s DEFINITELY not a D cup. Way too small.
3.0,"Pros: fleece lining is nice, soft, well sawn. Nice pattern, looks the same as on picture<br /><br />Cons: small is still too big for infant, my daughter is 8 months old and she is not tiny.  These are meant for toddler"
3.0,"I am 5'0, 180ish lbs, and usually wear a size 14-16 in jeans. At first I ordered the XXL, and that was waaaay too big. I returned that one and ordered the XXL. The XXL is still a smidge too big, but wearable. The breast pads inside are not attached to anything inside in fabric, so I found myself having to move then back in place, I might just sew them in so they stay put."
3.0,"Despite being sterling silver, up close it looks a bit plastic-like. From any distance (such as normal conversation distances) it looks very nice. I bought this on sale as a gift, and I am happy with what I got for what I paid. The item seems overpriced at its normal pricing value."
3.0,"Sum what small ............ for an adult ... LoL :p Hee Tee Hee Haa ... &#62;<br /><br />But, I absolutely LOOOOVVVVEEEE These more than any other pants i own !&#62;!&#62;!&#62;!&#62;!&#62;!<br /><br />But But But ... They have the worst pockets Ive EVER EVER EVER Had in my life ... so minus two stars for knowing that i most likely will loose my wallet or phone in the not too distant future :'( :'( :'(<br /><br />But gawdamn ... get with it Y'all ! ! ! kuT suM ReaL eFF'n pockeTz inTa these babieZ n i'll Buy Ten Pair Yo ! ! ! ! ! !<br /><br />CHa CHiNg &#62; $ &#62; $ &#62; $ &#62;<br /><br />LoL &#60;3"
3.0,The light only lit up half the screen
3.0,"I like the brightness of this light for dog walking - however, the red light never turns green while charging, thus how do you know when it is fully charged . . . ."
3.0,The bag is more gray than black...
3.0,Was expecting a better look. Looks a bit cheap.. Packaging was not luxurious as stated.. Came in a tiny ok jewelry box with the earring in a zip lock bag.. Disappointed.
3.0,"I purchased these LED lights for my son's birthday party.  To my dismay, 15 out of 40 lights arrived broken or low in battery.  I am so glad I checked each light before placing it in a goodie bag."
3.0,"A cheap knock off the real thing. Too small, really, and not as functional as the B... headband."
3.0,"Ordered the small, I'm 5'3 125lb and honestly it was actually kinda baggy on me....  wished they had an x-small option.... I'm glad I didnt size up like other reviewers suggested... order you're size!!! Or size down in my case."
3.0,Was a little bit more snug then I was anticipating based off of the sizing feedback posted. It's nice enough - especially for the price - but the pattern wasn't exactly what I was anticipating.
3.0,Eh. Not a fan of the blue tint and ‪it‬ isn’t as dark as I had hoped. Plus ‪it‬ sits weirdly on my face; that’s the problem with plastic frames. Just not for me.
3.0,"Cheap, but pretty"
3.0,Doesn't fall correctly
3.0,"Nice but, you get what you pay for in this case. Cheaply made but for costume jewelry not horrible......."
3.0,"I wouldn't buy these again for my husband. Even though he stoically wears his birthday gift, they are heavy, with inflexible soles, and too warm even for him who always has cold feet in the winter."
3.0,"Fit great, comfortable, nicely printed design<br />Material too thick - unable to breathe"
3.0,The material is so cheap. Fits perfect but will not be wearing
3.0,"I bought these for my 7 year old, and though they are nicely made, we were disappointed that they are very small and do not cover her nose and mouth fully!"
3.0,I love the messy bun cap but the ad is misleading . Its not a 2 pack...
3.0,I read reviews and sized up. It was still very small. I ordered XL because I wanted a shirt to wear with my leggings. I would say it fits like a women's M.
3.0,"The fit is AMAZING, and the quality seems great. The color i bought was meant to be light grey, but showed up stark white which is why I took off some stars."
3.0,"At 92% polyester and 8% spandex the title for this product is insanely misleading. There is no cotton in these legging..<br />They do fit rather nicely, and as far as I can tell (even with bright colored underwear) you cannot see through them when you stretch or bend.<br />There is a terrible burnt chemical smell, fingers crossed a good wash will fix that and I’ll probably keep them."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3dde46f23c1e46f7f47b8ed845d85870]] It's cute. I reallllllyyy wish it was a bit bigger and I wish even more that the snake was actually visible more
3.0,The chain linking the two claws is slides and doesn't stay centered so it always looks crooked.  I'll probably remove the chain and connect the two clasps with something else that fits it better.
3.0,This charm was much smaller than I though it would be.
3.0,"Loved the feel, but doesn't stay on my head during the night.  Defeats my purpose."
3.0,"Great design, decent fit except for the calf area which was too big on me."
3.0,"for the price it is a good bag but its not made to handle constant use or being full, i go to the gym alot , and this bag lasted about 2 weeks before it started to rip., i made a repair to it and its held up since."
3.0,"Good for what they are.  Wish they came in assorted sizes for thicker ear loops.  I tried to modify circular fasteners, but still no good.<br />If you are in need of an exact number of fasteners, plan on some being defective with no hole at one end.  I have not been desperate enough to try to 'fix' these defective ones."
3.0,It's not look as good as from the online order.
3.0,"This is not of a high quality keffiyeh. First this is not like the pics, second, upon me unfolding it out of the package, one of the &#34;tassels&#34; fell right off! I don't feel comfortable to wear coz it would be embarrassing if it falls apart on floor.  I feel the seller trick me with pic being different. I will say that this is authentic, but it's not a high quality one that I can get in Saudi. Not bad... Just ok"
3.0,"For starters,  shipping was extremely long but considering it came from overseas, that makes it a bit more understanding. Overall, I was fairly pleased once receiving this product. It looked exactly as the image and I couldn't wait to wear it but to great misfortune, after only my second wear , the chain began to show great discoloration. Although I'm aware that this is not real gold and it had a possibility of changing colors at some point, I didn't expect it to do it so soon. The charm is still a bright and beautiful gold color though. I may switch it out and buy an actual gold chain to pair with it until the charm eventually turns as well."
3.0,"This dress was super cute (5’7, 160lbs, 34C) however, the chest had no coverage so I needed to size up to a large just for the chest portion"
3.0,Didn't like the dress as its comfy for me. Otherwise it fitted well.
3.0,Cute rings but for very small fingers
3.0,"Probably would really be a 7.5 in these but had to choose 7 or 8 and I saw the people who chose larger said they were too big. The footbed does support my whole foot, but the pattern of ""massage"" nubs confuses my feet. No rhyme or reason, and pushes where it's tender and makes the plantar fascia a little more tender, rather than a feeling of relief or cushion. Not very comfy for me personally."
3.0,The compression socks need more elasticity.  Too constricting on the calf.
3.0,Anyone who says this is true to size needs to get head examined. I am a true size Large in tops (usually size 12 and don’t mind snug fits for tanks) and ordered the large. Very cute tie dye top but this is at best a US medium (Maybe a small) and I looked like a stuffed sausage!<br /><br />ADDED: orders the same tank in navy color. came a day later - size large and fit PERFECTLY and looked good. Either tie dye runs small or they sent me the wrong size! No tags on shirt so can’t tell what happened
3.0,Very itchy. Couldn’t wear it.
3.0,Runs small! Gets holes quick
3.0,"The green is much darker than pictured. Additionally, it is much thinner than I expected. Even still, I’ll keep it since I like the style and really like the style. If the other colors are darker than pictured, I might try the yellow."
3.0,"Size is what they advertise is correct, so dont get bigger sizes if you think that it will come smaller"
3.0,"I love how delicate this necklace is, but I will say that it gets tangled very easily. Otherwise, it's perfect."
3.0,"Very pretty, but kinda cheap looking"
3.0,"Sizing is accurate, pockets are small...can barely fit my hands in there."
3.0,This fit a little snug on me. I ordered 2 sizes larger than normal. If you don’t want it to fit snug go up 3 sizes. Love the dress and material though
3.0,Legs small
3.0,Adequate bag for my dance shoes.
3.0,Lightweight & comfortable but very bronzy which is not my preference..
3.0,"They are a tiny bit small but not too bad, I thought the fabric would be stretchy but it’s not, it’s kind of stiff but they look good on."
3.0,after the first trip I had to make on fixed because the handle bar got locked
3.0,"Cute print, fabric smelled absolutely awful and needed to be washed twiced."
3.0,It worked for a solid 2 months and then broke.<br />I liked it while it lasted!
3.0,It's ok I think I ordered mine to small...
3.0,Unfortunately punctured on very soft ground after standing for approximately 3 hours.<br />Recommend for limited hours on very soft soil.<br />Otherwise - great product.
3.0,"I like the look of watch but unfortunately the wrist band has broke already, therefore I cannot wear it"
3.0,"Just okay, The fit wasn't perfect and it was a little long for my taste (I am 5'6&#34; and 130lbs ordered a small).  It was a very beautiful color and the material is very nice.  Feels like a quality dress.  The dress was a little bit too big on me, there is a lot of material that flows and makes you look a bit bigger than you are.  I also couldn't find a belt I liked to pair with it so I am returning this one."
3.0,"I ordered the &#34;Wine Red&#34;, but the color is bright red, not burgundy as i expected. The V also is higher than i expected on the neckline, but overall fits well."
3.0,"Very cute masks, my daughter loves the design but can’t use it, runs way too big for 10 year old."
3.0,"While this is a nice product and the cotton terry is comfortable and helps slippery scarves stay on better, to call it a &#34;pad&#34; is very misleading. I was looking for something to give a little height in the crown area, but this liner is in no way padded.  Nice product, but inaccurate description.  Disappointed."
3.0,"Though the top can get away with the cheap look, the skirt looks like paper towel. Sooo I guess I got what I paid for."
3.0,Great product for kids.
3.0,Sized up. Bust moderately covers and slit is very high. Careful on windy days
3.0,"The v neck is very deep, deeper than the picture shows, at least in my case. Almost at your navel. My slit was torn thru by the time it got to me and I wear 4/6 but got the medium and it was still to tight. Shipped pretty fast tho."
3.0,It feels fake and plastic. Is it plastic? Just wanted to know! ^^
3.0,Doesn't flare like the picture. Still cute.
3.0,"Love the utility of this, but one of the cubes already has a rip along the seam. Not sure if they are long lasting."
3.0,"Received at the beginning of April of this year. The wristlet strap broke. I know this is not the HIGHEST quality item that could be purchased, but it would be nice if it lasted more than 8ish months (not constant use, either). Unfortunately, to replace just the strap it would be about $9. Looking for a different product now."
3.0,"It pretty, light weight but material is to slick and constantly falls off your shoulders."
3.0,Fabric does not fit properly around the top of your head. The cut needs to be modified.
3.0,"Walmart quality, the colors are vibrant. A nice summer weight material not substantial at all, good stitching. Not scratchy but not as soft as I like The size is just as expected."
3.0,"A bit bigger than i thought and arrived with a scratch on the upper bridge, no cleaning cloth."
3.0,"This suit is cute, and it does look like the picture. I expected the bottoms to be cheeky, however, the top is very wide spread. Meaning that all of my breast was exposed except the nipple, which sometimes slipped out because of how wide the bikini dips! If you're looking for a swimsuit to wear around your family, I wouldn't suggest this one. Very revealing in an uncomfortable way.<br /><br />I am 5'2, 120 pounds. I ordered a medium because I have hips. It fit perfectly. Just not what I was looking for."
3.0,The earrings are  very comfortable and cute; however the gold very quickly turns to silver.
3.0,"When people see you wearing a tiny globe on a necklace, they want a closer look.  It is then that they will notice the irregular shape of the continents and see that the globe is not round.  It is shaped like a small walnut.  For the under $5 price, I am not too disappointed.  But it would have been nice to have a round globe with better continents."
3.0,don't like it when it was on
3.0,Way too small makes me look like Ben Franklin
3.0,"Quality is good, all credit and ID cards fit well, HOWEVER, it has only four double-sided pages.  NOT five, as described!"
3.0,Not exactly as pictured. Sleeves are not as full and there is elastic around the bottom. On the plus side the top is lined and not sheer.
3.0,"Really small, barely fits my wrists. It's cute but not the best quality, however for the price I'd buy again."
3.0,It did shrink after wash and I am 5'7 and it did not touch the ground which I was hoping due to what I read on other reviews. I'm 150 and 5'7
3.0,"These run small! Unless you are very thin, they will be tight."
3.0,Loved the color and the pattern as well as the fabric. Fast shipping. A bit large at the top yet not quite as long as expected. Still plan to wear it though and it is pretty comfortable.
3.0,Wasnt what I expected at as material.
3.0,no maui jim logo
3.0,"Pros:<br />- Compared to other hanging toiletry bags on Amazon, it looks like the main compartment is well-built and tall enough (the netting part) that taller bottles won't fall out of it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- STRONG SMELL - chemicals from the factory? I left it hanging in the bathroom for 1 day and had to take it out because of the smell. Even without the bag, the smell lingered up to 2 weeks! I went on a trip soon after, came back a week later, and the smell still lingered.<br />- The stitching on the hanging part is flimsy. You can see from my photo that the stitching starts showing the moment you add a bit of weight! It looks like the bag will soon tear if you add weight.<br />- If you use the side compartments, the space it takes up &#34;eats&#34; into the main compartment, and vice versa. So it holds a lot less than you'd expect.<br /><br />For the price, this can be good value - BUT - only if you don't have much stuff to put in it. The overall quality of the bag is decent enough but the part where it hangs is the weak link as it doesn't look like it can withstand much weight.<br /><br />I wanted to like this bag but ultimately had to return it. The stitching on mine had defects - it arrived with some tears before I could use it. Also I have a few glass bottles of product that I travel with, and didn't want to risk the hanging part breaking and breaking all my items."
3.0,"Overly large but, cute with an updo hair style."
3.0,Very cute shape. Polarized and case was a bonus! The boys looked great! They didn’t last long though. They stretched out quickly. Then they broke easily...especially in the hands of a toddler. I’ll have to now look for something more durable for kids.
3.0,"It's too long for me at 5'2"". It looks a little baggy. Sleeves are also too long for me. I may try to alter it after washing"
3.0,I don't know how this is labeled slim fit. I am 6'1 200lbs and this fit like a poncho. Got it tailored -- they took 4 inches out of the shirt and its still a little big.
3.0,The picture appears to show d the decorative bars as silver tone but upon receiving them I found them to be gold tone.  Also they are a little too wide.  Other than that they are comfortable.
3.0,Its beautiful but its way too big for my small wrists. End up of giving.
3.0,The dress was too cute.  It was just too small for my daughter.
3.0,Too short.  Doesn't come down past the waste at all.
3.0,Loved the pattern. Dress is beautiful. Was too small and I had to give dress to my daughter.
3.0,Gets leaky. Multiple times get water inside. Needs improvement.
3.0,Good mask but the filters where pointless as there was no slot or opening to place a filter in.
3.0,"Work fine for straight viewing of computer screen.<br />Look down to phone or paperwork... everything askew, tilted to the right ??? Bad optics or shape of lenses ?<br />I will spend more next time for better optics."
3.0,"item was ok, but not heavy knit I expected."
3.0,I ordered the blue shirt thinking that it would have nice loose sleeves like in the picture the size certainly seems to fit the model and is still bloose all over so maybe I ordered the wrong size. The medium is very tight and I can sometimes wear a small. Other than that it looks like a well-made shirt but I am very dissatisfied because the color is not vibrant It's not the same blue like the picture. It is what I would describe as a lighter navy blue. Item description says Navy but I expected it to be the color in the picture I will be returning.
3.0,"We bought both the ""age recommend"" size: the 12-18 month and the 18-24 month old for my 22 month old kiddo. The 18-24 month old size was slightly too large for him and we could tell because his 'toe' part of the shoe was flopping around and he walked a little clumsy with it. So we tried the 12-18 month old shoe for him which we noticed an immediate difference - he seemed to walk with less of a snag and seemed more agile while climbing age appropriate playground fixtures. However my only complaint is that the shoe only lasted about 10 days. He stepped in some puddles and the toe area developed a hole (see picture). Otherwise we like the shoe. If we are ever able to measure his foot, I'll update this review."
3.0,Lástima pero no es bonita<br />No me gusto
3.0,"Dress is nice. Fits well, however, I really dislike how I have to take penguin steps in this to walk. I have to have a seamstress fix it for me to be able to walk normal. And for the additional cost of $22 i don’t know if it was truly worth it."
3.0,The watch case has a bur near the crown.  It does not wind when placed in the winder.  I like the style.  Okay for the price paid.
3.0,"I liked the unit, but cannot accept the stupid women's zipper that is too small for men's hands and is on the wrong side."
3.0,Legs are more baggy than &#34;slim leg&#34; and they are not as cropped as in the picture. Almost full length pants on me. I'm 5:4. They are comfortable though.
3.0,"If you are going for orange strap expect more vivid orange than the pics. I think they are also on the shorter side. (My wrists are not huge) see my pics. It barely passes second ring. Overall passable quality but I am not very impressed. Oh btw, the tool and pins they sent is just piece of crap."
3.0,Not close to size described.  It's too big/wide and bulky under the arms.
3.0,"It didn't fit to size, normally wear M, but medium felt snug, so I got a large and it was still a little snug, but love the jacket."
3.0,"I've worn these pants for about 2 months.  At first I loved them, but after a couple of washes I noticed that I had to keep tugging at the waist band just to keep them from sagging. The elastic in the waist and around the ankles has really disappointed me, stretches out very easily. Mind you, these pants fit me great when I first received them.  Also, I'm in pretty good shape and these pants show every dent and dimple in your leg. Not flattering"
3.0,It's little tight on my arms but I like the style.
3.0,Very little stretch! Nice pattern
3.0,"Really fit well. Wore down too quickly, but I worked them pretty hard. Good for normal use"
3.0,Size Chart Off ! Waist 1 full Size Low (would Prefer Buttons instead of Zipper Fly)
3.0,"These plugs look real good. The shipping was free and even though I had to wait 14 days for shipping I thought that 8 dollars for 3 sets of plugs was a great deal.  One problem, and it's a major one.  These plugs are not silicone, they must be rubber.  They were not flexible like silicone should be and were very difficult putting on and taking them off. I also found the fit to be a bit snug compared to all my other tunnels; that is the length of them, not the 10mm diameter size."
3.0,I gave it to my sister in law who is a size 8
3.0,I love the pattern but I'm not wild about the fit.
3.0,The material look too cheap<br />I did like the style
3.0,I was disappointed that the ball markers didn’t come with the clips
3.0,Broke the second day i got it but whatd i expect for so cheap!its cute though!
3.0,Todo el árticulo bien pero la caja en que nos enviaron muy grande para el producto y por eso el costo que page Porcel envío fue muy elevado...
3.0,I got these as a gift from someone. I really do love them but the wood coffee cups falls off the stud that keeps it on your ear. I didn’t notice until I got home that one of the coffee cups fell off. Now I am without it. Makes me sad.
3.0,Sizing is off. My daughter is growing out of toddler 5 so I ordered the 5-6.5 size and her toes touched the end. Had to return
3.0,"The Features socks are great in that they are cut so they are hidden.  However, the do not stay on my heels very well"
3.0,"I normally wear a size small-medium top in women's clothing. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh under 120 pounds. I ordered a size XXL, and it is very tight (almost too tight.)  The material is also very thin, reminding me of a thin handkerchief, so I get the impression that it may rip easily if I move around in it very much. I am ordering the next larger size.<br /><br />Update - I ordered (and received) the next larger size. This one is extremely way too large! And, the material is different, a very stretchy fabric. If the first one I had received had been this stretchy, I would not have needed to order a larger size."
3.0,You get what you pay for. it works but the quality is mediocre.
3.0,Runs really large. Had to return.
3.0,It fits and is very cute but a little snug
3.0,"These look hilarious on and are warm and pretty comfy, but they're a GIANT PAIN to put on. You have to pull the back up so hard it feels like it's going to rip, and you end up squishing your finger in the heel area. Almost as difficult to take off, but not quite as much. Also, your feet will sweat in them."
3.0,"The product is sturdier compared to other sunglasses. However, there was a little gap between both lenses and the frame. I also had to bend the frame at the nose support and legs because they were not symmetrical. But I guess those are pretty minor problems for its price!"
3.0,"Rather light weight for the Midwest, but is fine for limited exposure to the cold and for over dresses."
3.0,"Some threads around the calf and ankle were to tight, Otherwise a great deal."
3.0,Great idea but not strong enough
3.0,"4.0 stars on the pants being comfortable for hiking<br />2.0 on not having them arrive as advertised<br /><br />These are decent hiking pants but they aren’t as advertised. I don’t really care that much that they don’t convert to shorts or shorter length, but if you are going to advertise that as an aspect, then it should have it. As well, these are not capri-length pants (unless you are really tall).  And finally, there is no corded thing at the hem cuff at the bottom of the leg to ‘keep the bugs out’ as their advertisement states. These are just regular hiking pants.<br /><br />What they are however is lightweight and they do have 2 zippered pockets each on either side (4 pockets total on the front), but only one zippered pocket in the back. The pockets are fairly deep. I wouldn’t put too much in them as they’d weight the pants down and would hinder my hiking, but they’d work for keeping keys or odds and ends safe from falling out.<br /><br />My size is a 6, which makes them a little large on my 5’2” 118-pound frame, but I wanted them looser for hiking, walking in the woods, doing things outside around my house.<br /><br />They look better on than I thought they would. They are high-waisted, but the waist is pretty loose on me so that’s fine—I don’t like super tight in the waist pants when I’m hiking or working. There is a belt included.<br /><br />I like the olive green quite a bit.<br /><br />The material is quick-dry, as stated. They will be great for summer hiking. But not so sure about hiking in the colder months—these are loose enough, though, that I could wear something underneath them.<br /><br />I’d have given them 4 stars even if just for the comfort for hiking/working if not for the advertising being incorrect—if you are expecting convertible pants, and/or pull-cuff pants, you won’t or may not be getting that.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped you!"
3.0,"This dress looked so cute but it looks kinda like a moo moo on. Ya know like your grandmother's nightgown. It's cute, but it's big....and long.... BUT it has pockets. Don't buy a size up. The material is loose fitting."
3.0,"I fit in most XL dresses. Couldn’t get this to wrap around my chest and waist. I wear a C cup, 6’1 and 230lbs."
3.0,Material takes forever to dry.
3.0,I bought these for my 2yr old he takes my ear pro all the time and wanted a pair of his own. These aren't very comfy and leave marks on his ears also they are very hard for him to open by himself and have it be the right way. But they have decent sound protection .
3.0,"its nice and well made, but it was smaller than their sizing chart."
3.0,"Looks like quality work but too small.<br />Tagged as XL, more like L."
3.0,"Los colores fueron exactamente como la imagen, sin embargo la tela no es de muy buena calidad."
3.0,Fits decent . Kind of tight though
3.0,They are cute but I ordered a medium and they fit like a small
3.0,Some of the holes meant for the screws are too big and cannot be used. Had to mix and match but worked out. Makes my shoes look really clean. Has held up on two pairs of air maxes.
3.0,Pants legs almost like bell bottoms. Too wide for boot cut. Also way to long.
3.0,This is real beautiful but definitely not ONE SIZE FITS ALL....I am size 16 and this fits like a 9/10 if that......very small.....think asian small
3.0,"I bought the wine color. In the photo the frame looks semi-transparent and the colour of wine; however, the frame I got is actually opaque and more of a purpleruby color. They do come in a carrying pouch that I appreciate. I still like them even though the frame isn't what I expected."
3.0,"pocket squares are too small... otherwise not a bad tie, nice fabric.... bought four sets, basically four ties"
3.0,paid way too much for shipping and quality not as good as I have purchased in the past
3.0,"Very colorful and soft. The size runs small. Ordered a larger size, but it didn't solve the problem."
3.0,"comfortable, but a bit large.  wish there were a Large/Tall size available."
3.0,"This item took FOREVER to be delivered to my house, even as a Prime member. It took at least a month or more. The product seems well made but they are SUPER small.....a lot smaller than what I thought I was ordering. Otherwise, very pretty and my wife was pleased."
3.0,"Looks great on my daughter, not me."
3.0,"It's good to travel in. Nice and comfy, but look like hammer pants on me."
3.0,Wasn’t really that cool and still hard to find the ball.
3.0,The band itself is a very good looking mesh design and is very much a classy band. it installed pretty easily. The problem I had was the latch on the band was very hard to get latched and even more difficult to unlatch. I ended up taking the band off and going with another mesh band that had a magnetic latch.
3.0,A little in the small size thank god I ordered a size bigger
3.0,Too long for me. Also the waist is too much for a petite or short frame as I have. Yet they cut in right at the top of the pockets making it look as though I have hips that are weird.
3.0,I had to send it back because it had a snag right in the front top below the neckline. :(  It was SUPER soft and otherwise I would have loved it!
3.0,"Quality material & fits as expected, but waaayyy too long. I'm 5'4&#34; & the pants are made long enough to fit a 5'11&#34; woman. Sorry to say, but I will be returning this item."
3.0,This is sized more for a bracelet than an anklet. Was hard to slip on the foot and harder to take off. Its cute so I'll keep it as a bracelet.
3.0,Very cute but don't waste your time if you have boobs bigger than a B. I'm a 34c and it was just too much. Maybe if the straps adjusted that might have helped? Either way I had to send this one back.
3.0,"Muy buen producto. Cumple con las especificaciones mencionadas en la reseña.<br />Tanto el servicio, como el tiempo de entrega fueron excelentes."
3.0,Love the fit but sheer around thighs and booty.
3.0,gold clips are real cheap
3.0,Its a little too big even when adjusted on the smallest link.
3.0,Dislike sticker letters
3.0,They work great for a while but then they begin to loose color and then break.
3.0,"Nice, but I definitely didn't get the size I ordered."
3.0,This petticoat was a perfect length for me I am only 5'2&#34;. I only gave it three stars because when I removed it from the package it had a foul fishy smell. I had to air it out outside and it still slightly smells. I will continue to let it air out until my wedding.
3.0,shoe was in bad shape
3.0,"This was huge, it was nothing like the picture."
3.0,the shirt is Huuuuge !! i would suggest 1 size smaller then your actual size  ! but i love it . i think it would be fine after i wash and dry t . true to quality !!
3.0,"The sleeves are anchored to the body in such a way that the top gaps and pulls if I try to move my arms, so I returned it. I liked the material and it fit as expected."
3.0,"I absolutely love these pajamas! They're super comfy and adorable!<br /><br />Edit: after only being worn twice they've already started to pill. As much as I love them, I just wish they'd last longer than 2 washes."
3.0,thought they would be a little bigger. Thank you<br /><br />Christina
3.0,"great price, fit great, maybe not the best quality material"
3.0,cute but not big enough
3.0,"Fit as expected, but the lace material needs improvement. It didnt last the entire event. Good for 1 time use under 4 hours."
3.0,Lacks certificate
3.0,"Dress is too big is the chest area, and the material is thin."
3.0,"This is a great bag with a few exceptions. It is not entirely leather, and the laptop sleeve is a little tight for a 15"" laptop. The pockets are large, but it doesn't expand much before the lid/flap won't shut. The color is great and rich red."
3.0,It’s very beautiful and fits well. Be careful with the back slit. It rips very easily. When you get it go ahead and resew it. I wish I had!
3.0,A little long.  The size on the back is completely see through so it can be seen from the outside which is tacky.  The shirt is soft
3.0,I got the powder blue one.  It was a little too grandma-ish.  My sister told me it looks like something Queen Elizabeth would like.  I really wanted to like this purse and it is a really cute style. But I learned that isn't not very convient or easily accessible.
3.0,"Love these, want to purchase more due to ease, softness, amount of compression but after 2 washes a seam of one needed to be handsewn repaired. Hoping it’s a fluke, might buy more to see since can’t find an alternative that looks as good."
3.0,Nice hat but it didn't fit well at all.
3.0,"The fabric is nice and these are perfect if you are small in stature but if you are tall (5'8 and up), you might find that these are short in the torso and ride up under clothes."
3.0,"Runs too small. I usually wear a large. Would have returned it for an XL because it is a very nice shirt, but it's a heavier fabric than I am comfortable wearing. I would recommend buying it. Just ordered up a size."
3.0,"Really cute, but way too small, I ordered an Xlarge, I am 5'4  and 145 lbs, I was disappointed that it didn't fit."
3.0,It's cute but it keeps coming apart.  Had to wrap the cross around the infinity symbol a couple of times so it would stop falling off.
3.0,"purely a cheap costume piece. not bad, but nothing to write home about."
3.0,I love the look and color. But the fabric is a little delicate.
3.0,"Nice fabric, but too tight at neck"
3.0,very good but my wife says it's too small
3.0,They are a little larger frame than I expected but the size improved my field of vision.
3.0,Pretty color but way too big. I have another Prince tennis skirt in the same size and this one is much larger.
3.0,Color was not correct
3.0,"I was somewhat disappointed, the saying that you get what you pay for is true in this case."
3.0,Not great support. I still needed to wear a second bra (34E) but I love the design. It's not bulky at all.
3.0,It's a bit irritating to wear the ring pinches and will not stay up right. The bracelet doesn't fit snug enough to stay up on my arm where I wish it too.
3.0,"The dress is very pretty and soft,  wish I could wear it.  Runs two sizes smaller."
3.0,The product came in extremely wrinkled. The dress is see through so another layer will have to be worn which I wasn’t expecting.
3.0,very small size.
3.0,"It's super cute, but if you have a larger chest I would choose another suit. The straps and back strap are thin and don't do much to support."
3.0,It’s fine and fits well but the description needs to say that the material is thick af and there’s fleece inside cuz I was not expecting that at all.. I got it for a party and it’s going to be way too hot to wear it....... so waste of money.
3.0,Nice product but I'm not sure if it's supposed to have that tarnished look to it. I also see a place where it was glued together. But they explain that in the package. Not returning bc it's BEAUTIFUL
3.0,They are cute. But I ordered a size small and they are to big plus feet sweat since they are all synthetic.
3.0,"It doesn't get hot in winter, it keeps warm for a few minutes, then freezes your hand"
3.0,D Ears &tail  so cute but the bow tie is much too tight..child size &I have a thin neck!  Have to cut the elastic in half&add something to make it work!!
3.0,Love the look. I was hoping that the quality would be better seeing as its advertised as military tough. I have several rips along the seems. I sewed them back together because I do like the purse. I just wish I would have expected known that the material was not as sturdy as advertised.
3.0,"If you like a form fitting tee, this is for you! But I don't. I have a Next Level shirt that's my favorite, I got a few years back for a fund raiser. It's perfect and I was trying to buy another, loose v-neck women's size L tee. This isn't it."
3.0,"Looks a little cheap, but I like the design."
3.0,"When I purchased this, I thought it would be a semi-large hanger, but it was tiny. It looked nice but wish it was bigger."
3.0,The sole is super thin and within 2 uses my son already has holes in them just from walking around a wading pool.
3.0,"The red pair ordered fits extremely comfortable on my feet. However, the blue pair were not properly stitched & you can tell it. No matter how you try to put your feet in them, they will not go. Unfortunately as much as I love these socks, they are a 2 pack & I want both pair to fit; Not just one. Great socks; just defective."
3.0,Purchased these earrings to match a red dress that I bought recently. The color is beautiful but their size is much smaller than you may expect from the pics.
3.0,I was disappointed in the fabric. The picture looks a lot better than the actual dress.
3.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; 140 lbs & wear a 34D. Got an L, should have went with a M. too much room in the crotch area & the cut out section was baggy."
3.0,This cap was disappointing for what they charge.  Not the best Quality.  It fits a little small for average size man.  The symbol is NOT embroidered.  It’s a patch sewn on label. Not exactly what I expected.
3.0,Good size. Red a bit darker than expected.
3.0,"Exactly what I needed to carry a small flashlight and knife for EDC, but one major complaint is that the 3""x3"" measurement is the outside measurement, which means the actual usable inner space is more like 2.75""x2.75"" when maxed out. The description says a credit card will fit, a standard credit card is wider than 3"" so there's no way it'll fit. My EDC flashlight is 3-1/16"" long and the only way I can get it to fit is to shove it in diagonally in the pouch. Not ideal, but it works. Flashlight is a Lumintop Tool AAA, and knife is a Kershaw Chive."
3.0,Son pequeños
3.0,The shape of the boot is a little awkward.
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and the dress was promoted as knee-length. It is way longer.  Also, the reviews suggested I should order a size up, so I did,  The XL was way to large.  A Large might fit better and be shorter, but I'm done ordering on line and sending back.  Must find a brick and mortar shop so I can try on."
3.0,Nice watch band but expensive.
3.0,"Runs a tad small, although I expected that. It's a cheap fabric, which I also expected, but definitely wearable and good for a night out anyway! Cute dress. Glad I purchased."
3.0,"The reviews on this product don't really help and but I am giving you the honest truth hear. You get what your pay for! The metal bar one, has some type of coating and it peels off after few wears also instead of 3 different necklaces, its one big thing AND IT TANGLES. THE TANGLING IS UNBEARABLE. You can't even wear it for 20 minutes with out it tangling. If your crafty you can fix it up with out a problem so its not too bad but if you want a quality everyday necklace this isn't it."
3.0,"I don’t have big boobs, but this barely fit over them! I wanted to love it too ☹️"
3.0,"I wanted to love this top because it reminded me of something from anthropologie or free people,  but it was just way too big. I mean HUGE. I am 5'10&#34; 135lbs and usually a M in most tops, and after reading the reviews I ordered a small hoping it would work out. But it was far too wide. I could gather handfuls of material in the back and it was still too big. I think the concept and design is cute - just not flattering. Hopefully they will offer smaller sizes some day, but for now I will be returning it."
3.0,I should have brought them in a smaller size so they would support me better.
3.0,Be warned. Well made but you must have a very large head to wear
3.0,These are ok. They aren't as mirrored as they look. You can see the eyes. They are cute though.
3.0,"Beautiful , but runs extremely small... Gave mine away with a sad heart!"
3.0,Does not look like the picture shown.
3.0,"Although I didn't keep this item, I wanted to share that I loved the fabric and sleeve length! I usually wear XL, but it was far too loose fitting. I would have liked the dress to have been above knee length, but at 5'4"" it extended below the knee."
3.0,"These shorts are made of nylon not cotton. I have 3 pairs of similar cotton shorts which I love wearing to the gym and riding my bicycle. I thought I would try the lighter and quick drying nylon shorts. They were very comfortable and fit well. I jumped on my bicycle and started riding hard ( standing up on the pedals) Next thing I hear a loud ripping sound. The shorts split in half at the crotch. I have worn the cotton shorts numerous times with no problems but the nylon shorts ripped in less than 10 minutes. These are great, comfortable shorts with lots of pockets for storage. Excellent for lounging around or things like that.  Not good for athletics and certainly not ""tactical""."
3.0,Stretchy material that is “wonkey” at the hem where it gathers... making it balloon or puff out a bit where the ruffles are.
3.0,"My daughter loves this, but it does run large."
3.0,"Haven’t used yet tried it on and it’s small. Can’t imagine how it would fit an adult man unless he was slightly built.  In lands end winter hats, I’ll wear a large size. My daughter wears small and this fits her better. Was hoping I could use it as a face covering but the piece over the mouth is mesh so that won’t work as a mask replacement.  The back flap isn’t very long so it won’t keep the sun off your neck unless your shirt comes up high- not typical of women’s t shirts.<br />Purple color is very pretty. Makes a good lightweight baseball cap type hat for me. But that’s not what I was looking for."
3.0,"Size large on my 135lb 14yr old daughter who is 5'6. The outfit wasn't meant for her, but she liked it and it fit"
3.0,Larger than I expected!
3.0,Got exactly what was shown in the picture despite the description saying random grab bag. The bummer was that I’ve been i. 0s for 4 months or so so I don’t really have use for 2 sets of tapers. I also wear pink so the screw fit clear pink acrylic and neon pink silicone saddles will essentially just be for sleeping so I don’t feel like I wasted my money. Everything else was cuteish though.
3.0,"The robe is too small across the bosom so a bit tight and uncomfortable.  But I didn't return it, did I?"
3.0,Very cute but way too small in the upper body.
3.0,"The sweater is really cute and pretty good quality. Not really soft - but okay. But there is no tag signifying front/back, and its kind of hard to tell what the front of the sweater is. And the neck lays kinda weird no matter which way I put it on."
3.0,Super bummed they only go to large and that fits very small. I wear a 10/12 and it was very small.
3.0,Didn't like the feeling of it
3.0,Fit is a little tight
3.0,"They are really cute and the material is very thick and feels really nice.... But they are NOT made for someone that has any curves at all. Immediately after putting them on,  they started crawling up my but and the edges rolled up on my thighs and my belly.<br /><br />Also. They aren't truly seamless as there is a Big seam that runs right down your butt crack and there is seams where they attached the cotton lining in the crotch.... But there are no panty lines with them.<br /><br />It's a pity,  they seem like they would be really comfortable if they didn't leave me with a constant wedgie."
3.0,"When it arrived, the small little bag inside the package was ripped and the chain was missing. There are very noticeable stains on the front of it but other than that, the watch does work. I would have to purchase a chain to put it on if I can't find a spare at home or I might just return it."
3.0,The color is spot on... however it's really thin and see through so wear the proper under garments.
3.0,I seriously loved this dress BUT i couldn’t get it to zip! I have a huge chest because I’m breastfeeding but I’m only 175lbs 5’10. I ordered the largest size (xl) and it wouldn’t zip. Very disappointed in that. Had to return.
3.0,The image shown is hot pink although the description says purple. The are a light purple.
3.0,"It's bigger than what we were expecting, quality is ok"
3.0,Nice fit but the fabric is too thin.
3.0,"Cons:  the material is weird. Will it melt to my skin if I get too close to a bonfire? Possibly. Not a sweatshirt at all. The body section is like a poly jersey material and the arms are shiny. The washing instructions suggest to dry clean. I’ll hand wash or use the delicate cycle and cross my fingers that it holds up.<br />It’s cheaply made there’s a stitch outside the neckline (see photo).<br />Fits small, but I sized up so it’s fine on me.<br /><br />Pros: I like the fit (size up up up..) and the neck. It’s different and I’ll probably keep it as a lightweight long sleeve shirt (definitely not the warmth of a sweatshirt)."
3.0,Great gloves but takes 4-5 days to dry If the inside gets a little damp.
3.0,"I expected this to fit like a top and not a dress from the other reviews and it does, which is fine.<br />However, I ordered a size up(3t) and it fits more like a 4t. Very thin and sheer-ish, perfect for hot summers."
3.0,Arrived on time. I was hoping it would be larger. I'll have to make due.
3.0,Works as advertised. Very quiet but there is a clicking noise everything time its spin.
3.0,where it al the time. The leather unraveled after a month or two. Still wear it with the plain brown string beneath the leather. to care for it you'd need to take it off before shower and or going in water which I don't like
3.0,My son was in love with his shoes on Christmas morning but the second time he wore  them the right shoe won't stay charged long.. Not sure why
3.0,They look cool but fit really tight around the crotch area
3.0,"Look great, fit nice, but very uncomfortable"
3.0,For the price it's not bad. I like it. When I received it the moon was a little bent but I was able to fix it. Has not turned green yet but I've only worn it 3 or 4 times.
3.0,Overpriced!! For product that could be purchesed for far less without the name.
3.0,"It actually fit pretty well, and was fairly long, but the fabric showed everything. I didn't realize how stretchy/ clingy it would be, and I ended up returning it."
3.0,It didn't fit my ear. But it looked like it would have been really cool if it had.<br /><br />Uh oh.<br /><br />Do I have big ears??!<br /><br />(I don't think so.)
3.0,"I am so disappointed I bought this dress big so both my girls can wear it on their birthday 🥳 one wash and all the flowers fell off and the Glue got all over the dress so it was good for only one use, I used the gentle cycle and still 🤦🏾‍♀️ I’m disappointed"
3.0,"this is about what you would expect from a twenty dollar watch...convenient, hopefully waterproof, and it works so far...go for when i dont want to dig in my pocket for the cell phone"
3.0,Thin material. The chest area is cut in at the top and does not support women endowed in the front.
3.0,"Fabric is thin, buttonholes are not locked down, meaning the button gets hung up in loose thread around the buttonhole. Says it's a button ""down"" shirt. To me that meant a button-down collar but that is not the case. It is a button shirt, just not a button-down collar. That might be nit-picking. Strips, both white and blue are wider than I expected. Also blue is pale not bright."
3.0,"These are not the best quality and fit a little small, but my grand daughter loves them"
3.0,The dress was too small. I returned the dress. Waiting on a refund
3.0,Got it for my son for school. Love the design but it's a little large and he says he has to keep pulling it up.
3.0,It is a nice looking belt but the part that gets bent back and forth near the hole that i use got worn down quickly.  The leather peeled off and the layers separated around that area.  I still use it all the time.
3.0,"Side of these blew out after a few month.  They are comfortable and probably good slippers if you don't wear them outside much or too much in general.  They do keep your feet warm, but overall not impressed with the quality."
3.0,Too small. Had to give it to my niece. She said it's okay though.
3.0,"I'm actually wearing these right now. They're nice for wearing around: they are not lined, they are a little short but fit nice. I think they should be a little cheaper priced for material used. Need to be hand washed in cold which is a little annoying."
3.0,"It was way too long, the material wasn’t too bad. It was also uncomfortably tight in the chest area, however; the elastic around the waist was way more lose. So I don’t understand that"
3.0,"These are super cute and made of really comfy material. However, the waist is abnormally large for the size of legging. They also stretch out horrendously. I have to constantly tug them up so my butt doesn't hang out."
3.0,"A little seem broke a day after I got it, but I like the authentic look of the Burberry pattern."
3.0,The fabric is stretchy and looked cheap I gave it away
3.0,cute but too short and im 5'7&#34;
3.0,"Super cute dress, but it’s so long that it’s not wearable (even with my highest wedge sandals)"
3.0,Adjustable band slips from desired position. I might hack it with velcro.
3.0,Liked that you could make it a size larger if needed. Did not like that it was above the ankle. My daughter is 5'7 in hieght.
3.0,"The product was good, but not true to size.  Need to order up to 2 sizes bigger."
3.0,"The purse was beautiful,well made I returned it because it was to large."
3.0,Look cool but the inside paint on lense spider cracked all over so cant c out of them only had em for like a week?😦
3.0,So far these are awesome.  Hasn't been really cold yet but I'm hoping it will be soon so I can put these to the test
3.0,"Nice earings, good value for what they cost. Very timely shipping even at Christmas"
3.0,"I much prefer shorts that are hip huggers, and these definitely are not.  They also run a bit tight.  The material feels more like linen than cotton.  That being said, I will still wear them, but they are a disappointment."
3.0,"Dress is ok, it is a much shorter hemline than appears in photo"
3.0,I returned the item because the pant leg cuffs were so loose they didn’t even seem like cuffs but the fabric would have been great in terms of thickness for my AZ weather
3.0,I would not have gotten these masks if I had know the were going to be stretchy poly spandex feeling. They are NOT cottony. I bought them so that I could tie dye them and all the dye completely washed out of this fabric. The kids were very disappointed.
3.0,Beautiful little jacket. Runs a bit small though. Should have ordered a medium because of my bra size.
3.0,NICE FoR A KNOCKOFF BRAND
3.0,Don't really wear ichy
3.0,I really like this item.  I just wish they would have made one with larger beads.  It looks great on and has some adjustability.
3.0,Th e picture is not center as advertised and the colors are not as vibrant nor as sharp either.
3.0,I am not big chested at all!!  But this blouse mad me feel stacked!  Tight around the breasts.  But I wasn't fooled.
3.0,"The fabric is great, would be the best dress ever if it didn’t end an inch above my ankle bone. I’m 5’7”, ordered a large, and it is waaaay awkwardly too short."
3.0,"I got this watch and out of the box it was pretty good.  I like my mechanical watches to be accurate, and this watch would gain 2 seconds one day and then lose 2 seconds the next, so overall it was keeping good time.  Then after a few weeks something happened as the movement settled in and it just started losing 8 seconds or more per day.  I looked at regulating the movement (adjusting the accuracy), but it's impossible for a regular watch maker to do.  It needs to go back to Mido for laser regulation.  It is NOT adjustable like a usual ETA movement.  Disappointing!  Pretty watch for sure, but the movement is the heart and soul of a mechanical watch and I was NOT happy with this watch's movement."
3.0,"This sweater would be cute with leggings. It is rather itchy and very long. I am 5'4"" 180 lbs for reference and it was VERY long. I normally wear L to XL. I ordered a L and probably could have went with a S or M. It hits me above my knees, not really what is shown in the picture."
3.0,"Way too big!  Worked for the purpose of a costume with cutting, sewing, and tying together but ended up being really cute!"
3.0,"Shirt is fine, but it took almost three months to arrive."
3.0,"the night gown feels heavy. wanted to return it, but it will cost $5.00 to send it back."
3.0,Nice and feminine. The fabric a little too heavy. Need a size larger for it runs small
3.0,kind of heavy for my liking
3.0,"Love the look, but what a pain to put in!!!"
3.0,Very oversized
3.0,It's cute. A bit itchy.
3.0,"I thought it smelled kind of funny, when it came out of the bag.  But could have been just the way it smelled out of the factory. Washed it and it is fine."
3.0,Unable to wear because it doesn't fit. I bought it one size larger. The first area is a little small making it uncomfortable.
3.0,"A very good product. Unfortunately, Amazon sellers are taking advantage of the pandemic and charging a shipping fee that is TWICE the value of the item itself. Greed is good, I guess?"
3.0,Dress was rather large in the shoulder & arm hole area. Purchased for my daughters 8th grade dance. She had large busts but the gaps in the arm holes were so large you could see her whole chest. The shoulder area was also so big. I would have had to take it to alterations which would have cost more than the dress. I’ll end up doing that or fixing the sleeve area myself in the future as we were unable to return due to a move.
3.0,Demasiado grandes para niños
3.0,Color is a little brighter than in picture
3.0,"Cute colors, not too thick for my small finger.. however not at all true to size. I wear a size 5 & even that is a tad too big for me actually.. I ordered size 5 & these are very tight on me and leaving indentions."
3.0,Great product in quality but the long bill look is  ugly on as home made soap .get it if u live alone in the mountains..u might even scare a black bear up there<br />Don't let ur buddies see ya in it ..they won't let up for a week ..
3.0,Beautiful dress. Bad zipper. It would go up and down on hanger but not on my daughter and there was plenty of room. I returned it and got a refund easily.
3.0,These were perfect for my cosplay but unfortunately didn’t come with the straps to help keep them tight. Had to find some things around the house to help tighten them in the back so I could actually walk around and not have them slip off.
3.0,Ain’t real leather.. it’s pleather.  Let’s c how it holds up
3.0,"Quality of fabric is good, but prefer no spandex.  Based on size guide almost thought I needed a small but purchased a medium, which is slightly tight before washing.  Hope it does not shrink."
3.0,"Good quality , I already bought 2 other tie , but didn't like the color on this one :("
3.0,"This was a gift to my grandson for his birthday, I have not personally seen it. Can not rate at this time."
3.0,Initially I thought this was a one piece. Still a very nice outfit though. My daughter loves it.
3.0,Not for tall woman!
3.0,"Beautiful, vibrant fabric and plenty of room to tie. However, this is so, so short! I am 5'4&#34; and need to wear shorts or leggings to stay covered. You would need to be pretty short for it hit above the knee as pictured."
3.0,The mesh portion doesn't stretch so easily there is no control at the top so they kept sliding down .. they are very low waist and that wasn't mentioned in the product review
3.0,to big to be called small
3.0,These are very nice gloves however. I have always worn a women's size L. These were huge and I suspected they might be for a man instead? I had to send them back. If you have large hands these are what you're looking for.
3.0,Rating is soly based on size. Beautiful nightshirt but runs really small.  I purchased an XL and I ended up giving  it to a friend who wears a medium.
3.0,The dress is pretty but the fit is off. I ordered two sizes up from what I would buy off the rack in a store but this dress runs small.
3.0,Adorable but way too small
3.0,Great size but the material is very bright.  The metallic makes it look cheap.
3.0,The actual septum rings are very cute. I am actually very sad that I have to return them. When you try to open them they are sooooo hard to open and close. All of them had the same problem of being really hard to open and close. There were 2 that just would not budge. Will be returning.
3.0,"These were too long/tall for a 5’2” 115lb. runner. I ordered the S/M. They seemed like good quality, though, but not a good fit for me."
3.0,I am 5'10&#34; and the top and sleeves were too short to work for me even in a large-sent it back.
3.0,"I gave this a three star because it did provide an extra amount of warmth.  However, the metallic thread seam in the toe chaffed my skin and caused a small sore.  I am hoping that I can use a sock liner with them to prevent the chaffing."
3.0,The gold tone  doesnt look as good as the silver one
3.0,Like the style! quality is ok for a fun statement earring but the backs which came with it were not tight enough so the somewhat heavy earring kept falling out of my ear until I used different backs.
3.0,several charms were printed poorly
3.0,"Pretty item, about .5 inches too short. Has 3 sizes yet still too small. I'm sad. No problem getting a refund though."
3.0,Just what i wanted and a good product. Only issue is the ends are not stitched which cause threads to come out. I have started losing threads on mine.
3.0,"They are 39-40cm, a little shorter than described."
3.0,Did not like exterior or interior material. Exterior is some sort of faux leather and interior is plastic. Cheap looking for my taste. Size okay. Just couldn't even consider because of inferior material.
3.0,"I am on my 3rd purchased belt, they are not built to last like most belts. The paint falls off within 6months, the belt clip lasts about 1 yr with the flimsy leather and the pins holding the belt together fall off after about 2yrs.<br /><br />The design is great just not built to lasts."
3.0,Too large for a petite wrist.
3.0,"These are okay, I'm currently using the largest one as my every day purse. It's a nice medium size. I put my camera in the pouch type bag, and the zipper pull snapped in half. Also the card holder came bent in half in the wrong direction, and once straightened, the faux leather had wrinkles and kept wanting to bend back so it was useless."
3.0,"It's a $15 dress, so don't expect anything too amazing. This is actually an empire waist dress, so the photo shown for the black dress is rather misleading.<br /><br />Having said that, it's a decent basic dress you could wear for everyday activities. Machine washable, has pockets, and warm for winter. You could dress this up with the right necklace, but this ultimately is a casual dress."
3.0,Gave it to my cousin as a bday gift she love it she is a size small to medium.  I ordered a large I wear a size 7-9
3.0,Pretty but smaller than a normal XL
3.0,I ordered two of. These necklaces and was very disappointed with the poor quality.
3.0,"It feels cheap, and it’s just metal glued to a side ways head band. Doesn’t even fit on a adult head"
3.0,"Love the print. Price is a little high for the value. It's underwear, shouldn't cost $20 for one. Even women's expensive underwear do not cost that much."
3.0,Too frumpy. Gave it to a friend who loves it
3.0,"This mask is a good quality, think plastic and nice band. However, it is NOT adult size as stated.  It's very small on a 130lb man."
3.0,I wear a size 13 shoe. So I got the xxl but there still way to small.
3.0,This runs REALLY small. And it's just not attractive.
3.0,The style is nice. It's a true wrap skirt. The colors were more blue and purple saturated than I was expecting. Length was great especially if you are short. Sizing was accurate. I ordered a small. The slit does come up very high.
3.0,"They aren’t real sturdy but they work pretty well. I wear contacts but still need readers for close up so these are great for doing work at computer, watching tv and browsing phone, etc. would have given another star but one pair was broken upon arrival. :0("
3.0,Fit is much longer than earlier purchased  Columbia items = on the tight side when sitting.
3.0,Zipper broke the 1st time I used the bag.
3.0,My grandaughter saw these and put them on her list of Christmas ideas.  I was disappointed that they came in a plastc bag and some bere already missing parts.
3.0,These aren't &#34;one size&#34; these are Large for size 9+ in women's
3.0,"It's not a bad skirt for the price you pay and I'll certainly wear it quite a bit, but I definitely don't think it's thick or heavy enough to be considered warm. I'm also curious where they find room for the wool between the 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex."
3.0,"It isn't intended for my body type but I decided to risk it. It fits o.k. but not great, no fault of the product. The looooong split almost to my belly button IS a serious flaw as is the diaphanous material. Crotchless is crotchless... THIS THING is split all the way front and back from crotch to the middle. Overall it looks and feels like products costing about half as much from China and I doubt it will last long. If you don't have wide hips skip this one as it just limply lays loose right where wider hips would be. Live and learn. A guy gets away with wearing some of this stuff but I suggest any men eying this move on. This is completely wrong for wide shoulders and narrow hips and has a distinct tissue paper quality to it as well. Update Sep 14: looks better after sewing up the unnecessary length of slit but having to alter a new item is not o.k. and it STILL looks like one of those $0.01 with $9.99 shipping China pieces that go to crap after wearing them twice."
3.0,The chain is not long enough and ended up losing it with the device because I was keeping it in my pocket.
3.0,"These are adorable. I love how big the bows are and they are glued onto the nylon bands very securely. Although they are very stretchy, they still leave pink indentation marks on my 15 months head."
3.0,Don't get dark enough when needed...
3.0,"Its not engraved it's actually just printed on there, so at some point I'm sure it will rub off, but it still looks nice when new.  Also the hole is REALLY close to the edge of the charm so I worry it will break through at some point.  OK for the price though."
3.0,"Very beautiful but a little stiff, not as soft as i'd imagine or would like."
3.0,"Dress looked lovely but fit was awkward.  I wear medium but read previous reviews where people sized up so I ordered a large.  It was very big on me and did not conform to my body so a medium, or maybe even a small as the material does stretch, would have been fine. The halter neckline is not adjustable and was so long the top went under my bust line.  If you're decent at sewing it would probably be easy to alter.  The fabric is one that's breathable and easy to wear in summer but have to be careful when washing.<br /><br />Had originally ordered for a party but shipping was pushed back multiple times and didn't receive it until three weeks later than when it was supposed to.  Being that my primary purpose for ordering had passed I exchanged it towards a different every day dress.  Would like to order again sometime and get a fit that's right for me as it really is a lovely dress and would love to have for summer."
3.0,"First sizing, a size 8 does NOT equate to a medium because the dress bodice is small relative to the fill skirt. Returned the medium for a Large. Large = 8 or 10 max.<br />Second, execution. This dress could be a great knock off of expensive fashion featuring fluid netting over shorter under dress IF the tailoring were less sloppy. The pattern match is off, the seams are irregular, and the hem cut is uneven. So, $40 vs $300. A cheap Chinese compromise. I decided it was worth the price - even if disappointing.<br />A plus, hand washable"
3.0,It seemed very flimsy - was afraid it wouldn't be strong enough to keep my apple watch on my wrist.
3.0,"Small and thin, not what I expected!"
3.0,Way too big for average head
3.0,Earrings were filmsy ans broke the second time i wore them.
3.0,"Have not received opk 18k gold bracelet yet,or women's hooded sweater  And my sunglasses aren't quite what I wanted. But other than that I was satisfied.  ThNks"
3.0,Too big on me.
3.0,"This bag was enjoyed until the hardware disintegrated. Depending on how you carry this bag, this all means it can easily be lost before you are even aware of it.  Very frustrating.  It lasted a full 4 months"
3.0,These are cute but some of one of the reindeers was not painted.  ; (
3.0,"I usually wear a size small, but the dimensions on this dress fit funny."
3.0,"Very tight, for a size large.  Jordan usually makes their clothing really large.  These shorts are snug, like under armor jogging shorts.  They look amazing, but I think i'm going to have to return them due to the size. I've got a size medium pair of Jordan shorts from 10 years ago, and they are huge, and honestly, bigger than these Large shorts I just ordered.  Come on, Nike, have some consistency with your sizes!"
3.0,Pretty colors and really soft but one size? They are WAY to long. I’m 5’3” and I’m not sure I’ll be able to wear them with anything but tucked into boots. Not thrilled with these.
3.0,The fit was strange.
3.0,"runs smalls, tight at the bottom. Color is nice and bright."
3.0,Does the job but is very stiff. I am pretty sure this will break into 2 parts if used by someone with a large head as posted by others. May works good for kids or people with small heads.
3.0,Ok not great
3.0,"Sometimes it works fine, but your glasses have to be super clean and you have to mist them absolutely perfectly. Too little and it doesn't work, too much and it's like looking through a kaleidoscope. Not terrible, but not great either."
3.0,It’s like a tent but the style is cute
3.0,Fit as expected. Didn't like it for me and it didn't serve me well.
3.0,I do want to say I get a lot of compliments when I wear the shirt but I will say one thing it's not at all what I expected. It's definitely not the same thing as in the picture but I still wear it.  Also it's a bit small
3.0,"Very very very tight, slightly see through but works great with a see through dress"
3.0,I saw a news anchor on Fox5DC with this on. Looked great on her. I can fit the dress but fits snugger that I would like. Love the color. Still debating if I will return it.
3.0,My hands are not particularly large but these are pretty tight and not very soft.
3.0,"I don't understand why designers of plus size swimsuits consistently make them too shortwaisted. If you are plus sized and order jeans they assume you are 6 ft tall and there's 5-6 inches you have to cut off. But order a swimsuit and they assume you are 5 ft or less. I love the color and cut of this suit, its gorgeous. I'm 5'5&#34;  and wear a size 22 so I ordered a 5xl. It would be perfect if my boobs were about 6 inches lower on my body. Not the only suit I've had this issue with so I'll keep searching and pray for designers to get a clue. The suit is very nicely stitched and of thick material, not flimsy at all, lined in the front with removable pads in the bra. If it had been a few inches longer, I'd be giving it 5 stars and wishing for summer to show it off."
3.0,"These glasses are way too big for my head, which is NOT a problem I usually have with glasses. The lenses are fine for reading my phone or computer, they just keep falling off my head. I would not buy again."
3.0,"Very cheap material.  If you want a scarf to keep you warm, this one is not it.  Looks okay with a casual outfit but not the best quality."
3.0,"Purchased a D cup, which is my size.. The bra felt a bit loose. The adhesive stuck but the bra itself with the clasp on was not a secure fit. I only wore it once but it did the job as I wore it with a backless dress for a few hours. Maybe next time I'll try a C cup for a more secure fit, as I had to adjust my breasts and bra a few times."
3.0,it's cute but cheaply made. feel apart constantly for the 8 hours of wearing it
3.0,"Its a very cute shirt/dress depending on how you plan to wear it. The neckline is extremely awkward. The choker part is way to loose which does ruin the look and the top only look good tied up in the front, but that takes a few inches off so keep that in mind. Overall a cute top though."
3.0,"Despite the large face, the numbers are a little too pale to see easily without glasses. The band is very large and heavy. I have 6&#34; wrists and removing band is not mt forte so it ends up spinning around my wrist. None-the-less, Baby Boomers cant be choosers so it beats being 'lost in time'.Someone with larger wrists and better vision should be happy with this watch."
3.0,"Bought to use as part of a Steampunk cosplay, its smaller than I expected from reading some of the reviews."
3.0,"This is a nice belt but after 3-5 uses it started to look old and worn out, it was a good while it lasted though."
3.0,"I couldn’t wait to get this scrub top. The only issue I have is it’s a really thick material. I work at a Vet office & it can be super hot. On top of it being 104* outside, I’m not too keen on wearing it right now. I do like the saying on it, it’s just too hot."
3.0,One was a medium which I never order that size. The xlarge is really big
3.0,i wish there was a 2X version of it
3.0,"Sleeves are always TOO TIGHT.  Asians may have skinny arms, but not all of us do!"
3.0,"Cute dress, but I hate polyester blends. I live in Florida and it's just too hot. I would love to find this in a cotton version!"
3.0,Love it.... It surprised me!!!
3.0,"Washed in cold water,  but the black faded considerably before I even got to wear it."
3.0,Such a cute shirt but I thought the lightening bolt was glitter 🙃
3.0,"I like the look, but they're a bit stiff where the roof of the shoe meets my toes. I hope they loosen up. And as usual for Nike, they're sized much smaller than every other pair of shoes I own. I generally where a size 13 in everything else. I ordered these sandals in a size 14 and they were still too small. Had to opt for a 15."
3.0,cheap but fine for a beach day or a car ride. wouldn't be too upset if they got lost.
3.0,shirt is huge
3.0,The color is perfect . The top is a bit big and could be longer.
3.0,"There wasn't a miku on the watch nor did it come in a miku box, slightly disappointed with that, but the watch itself is pretty good. The material used to keep it on your wrist is a bit stiff and less durable over time but its still a great buy!"
3.0,"The chain looks much smaller in the picture. Its much more bulky in person. Other than that, its fine."
3.0,"This bracelet is beautiful and looks so good! Unfortunately, it is very small and difficult to get on."
3.0,"I liked these, but the material stretches like crazy. I took them in so that when they stretched, they didn't look so huge."
3.0,The silver-ish coating wore off after a month or so of wearing it....
3.0,This is beautiful color scarf and great for the Fall. I gave it 3 stars because some of the colors bleed into the portions of the scarf. Which may be minor if you are just wrapping it around your neck. You can't beat the price so I will keep it.
3.0,The fit is great for my short torso. I am 5’2” and weigh 125. I ordered the M and it was a bit big. The sellers offer great return policy. I am excited to get the S size.
3.0,"I am 4'11"" , 122 lbs, and based upon reviews ordered the size Medium.  The material is very stretchy and the fit through the bust and waist was OK.  On my short frame, the dress hit just at the top of the knee.  However, the cold shoulder straps were twice too loose and looked silly.  The dress was not pretty enough on for me to keep.  However, I also ordered the navy blue in this style and size.  It fit much better (cut and stitched at a different factory?) and the cold shoulder straps fit properly and looked good.  I am keeping the navy blue dress."
3.0,I misread and did not realize these were cuff earrings. I usually wear normal earrings but when I got these they were so pretty. You can tell they are very delicate and could break easily but overall not bad.
3.0,Very cute but very tight fitting. Not warm. Basically for looks. But they can serve as liners for heavier gloves.
3.0,I love the length of the necklace. However the flower was too yellow and small for my taste. You can see the glue residue on the edge of the flower. Overall I could see myself wearing it way more than once.
3.0,"This is not a dancing shoe , it's a regular shoe and I wanted the dancing shoe and was unable to return because I did not try them on right away and now it's too late I am on fixed income and cannot afford it."
3.0,"It was okay, the charms were just a little bigger than i wanted."
3.0,Unfortunately the dress was about 3 inches too short. I’m 130 pounds and 5’6 I ordered a small. Everything was perfect but the length
3.0,we will keep them and use them but they were very light weight synthetic fiber.  It'll work for under dresses but the other kind of these we have we paid A LOT more for and they're really nice fabric.  Great for the price
3.0,"Good, comfortable"
3.0,This fits tight/snug bug the material has more give. The skirt is quite full. It comes quite wrinkled in the packaging. I have to give it a second look. It's somewhat classy and sexy.  The wrinkled packaging has thrown off my opinion.
3.0,These are super large for their size. My daughter is 6 and tall for her age but the waste is huge.
3.0,Bought X-Large. I wear 12-14 and it was too big. I liked the dress but was too big. No size large available.
3.0,Fogs up and makes you feel like you can not breathe.
3.0,Item returned because zipper was stuck also I didn't like that one side of the coin purse was cloth and I felt it may become worn out easily.
3.0,"Loved the retro style, however I did not love the length. I was under the impression that this would be the length of my knees. I'm quite tall, 5'8 and this dress went to mid calf. Had quite a few compliments with it, and several comments about getting it hemmed."
3.0,Quite thin. Not a fan.
3.0,Not high quality material at all but for everyday cheap socks they will work
3.0,Way too small for a woman's head
3.0,The product was great!<br />Took a long time to get delivered.
3.0,It came way too big and not flattering.
3.0,Ok watch. I thought it was gold. But turns out it was rose gold.
3.0,Soft warm and comfortable. This 70 y/o hunter appreciates the utility. Thanks
3.0,Love this dress: the way it looks and fits minus the length on arms. I have average length arms but this was not a long sleeve on me. It was more of a quarter sleeve fit which was disappointing since I needed something long sleeved.
3.0,Each individual earing is much larger than pictured and yes a couple of the pieces do look cheap but if you're building a stud collection to mix and match this set will be fine.
3.0,Pretty but to big
3.0,"I had previously ordered headbands/sweatbands from this same company and loved them.  I needed more, so I ordered this set and when they arrived I was taken aback by the difference in quality from the previous set ordered.  The material that this set of headbands is made out of is very thin.  I decided to wash them and test them out, rather than send them back, hoping that they would work better than it appeared they would.  They don't.  They are ok.  If you are not working out very hard, or if you do not sweat very much, then they would be fine.  But, they are not a product that I would order again.<br />Maybe I should note that I wear them for doing power yoga. I don't tend to sweat profusely, but I my yoga practice does get rather sweaty and these were meant to help keep from having to use my shirt to wipe the sweat out of my eyes and distract me from my practice.  Didn't really work out that way.  One headband will work for about 30 minutes, then I have to change it out.  Not exactly helping to keep the distraction to a minimum."
3.0,"Nice dress! Bought a Large could have done a Medium I’m 5,1 150lbs"
3.0,The rhinestone accent ring broke as soon as I tried to put it on the watch face. The band portion is fine.
3.0,"I normally wear a size 10 dress. I am a 36 D. I ordered a medium and the size fit me everywhere except across the chest. I was able to zip it up, but you could see the material pulling across the widest part of my chest and I could not breathe comfortably."
3.0,"**EDIT 1/12/2021<br />My now 3 year old is a skinny guy but the 2T sizeis getting too tight on his waist so I purchased the next size up 4/6 and HOLY COW these are HUGE! There is no way this could be the next size up. My kid won't be able to wear these until he is YEARS older. What a waste of money and a huge disappointment. This is just shameful to have such a huge size difference.<br /><br />We bought these for our 2.5 year old. He isn't very tall but about 30 pounds. We purchased the 2T ones. If your child has a bit of a bubble butt or a little more in the belly, these will be tight on the waste so go up in size. For us, these fit perfectly, but we know we will be going up a size soon.<br /><br />The solid colors are pretty soft, especially after the first wash. It took 2-3 washes for the printed ones to soften up. At first they were pretty stiff and scratchy but now they feel like the others."
3.0,"Nice fabric,<br />a bit large for a small fellow"
3.0,I've gained weight and it doesn't really look very good on me. The dye isn't too great either. Could be cute though
3.0,The decal is soft and I really like it. I normally wear a large T-shirt and ordered a large and it fit like a medium. Defiantly order up a size.
3.0,"I really like both the pattern and the feel of the material for the Spikerking V-neck beachwear.  It is NOT, however, a one-size-fits-all. Nor, can it really even be called a dress. I am 5'7&#34; & wear a size 12/14. If I keep this, it will have to be worn as a top. I think the garment would be really cute on another body type. I am large chested, & the elastic band underneath the bust is simply not flattering. I will most likely give it to my daughter - who is only 5'3&#34; - to be used as a maternity dress/top.

3.0,Good one not bad
3.0,Sizing was accurate but was a bit thick.  Not very comfortable.
3.0,"These sunglasses look super cool and seemed to be good quality, but unfortunately they were too small for my 8 year old. I was hoping they’d fit since the description says they fit up to 12 year olds, but they would be more appropriate for preschool age kids."
3.0,Runs smal had to order larger size
3.0,"I thought this chain would be perfect for the charm I received for my birthday, but it broke the second time I wore it. Not necessarily the sellers fault but I wish the quality was a little better. Besides that it was shipped fast and showed up in good condition."
3.0,Much larger than they appear.
3.0,This top runs large and is probably better suited for well-endowed women. I am a 32B and it fit loose and looked unflattering.
3.0,"It is VERY snug...and I ordered an XL for my usual L.....VERY snug....I suppose the style calls for that?  I will wear at the hot beach, but may be too tight..."
3.0,"I'ts not a one size fits all, these are all to big for me to use as a mask."
3.0,"I like the watch but why does it not fit with any strap?  16 bucks for a special strap?  I feel like an idiot, but I bought it anyway... I should have just bought a different watch."
3.0,Velcro doesn't attach firmly and slides up and down the strap.
3.0,"These are super comfy and fit as expected. They are very thing which is great for the hot weather. The downside, they are extremely see through. I was in my house and my husband was able to see my underwear clearly. I was hoping to use these to go out, looks like they’ll be inside shorts only."
3.0,"Definitely runs about a size bigger than it should. Ordered an 8 and fits like a 9. Quite displeased. Cute, but flimsy. Bends easy. Will not buy from this seller again.<br /><br />*updated review*<br />Seller contacted me since the original ring was too big. Sent me one a size smaller, which was the correct size. (Beware, this ring runs huge - order a size smaller). I still think it's flimsy, but I guess you get what you pay for. Updated from 1 to 3 stars because of the good communication from seller."
3.0,"Bit cheaply made, one of the ears had to be sewn back on almost immediately"
3.0,My only complaint is that it’s too big on my wrist 😞
3.0,Top runs a little small. I am usually an XL but ordered the XXL based on other reviews. Even though I ordered up a size the top is a little snug.  The swim bottoms are see through.
3.0,"This is a great product for the price and shipping was impeccable. However, I ordered a 3x to fit loosely but my daughter whom wears a small couldn't wear it. The sizing isn't accurate at all."
3.0,Very thick sweater. Nice color.
3.0,"The material is lightweight and comfy.  The length is great however it’s tight around the waist, hips and thighs making underwear lines visible even with spanx."
3.0,"Looks ok, smells awful.  I kept it outside until the rubber lost some of that terrible chemical odor.  My biggest gripe is that the hooves are cloven!  Were they designed by an idiot who had never seen a horse's foot and didn't bother to even freaking look it up on the innerwebz?"
3.0,The blouse was extremely wrinkled and the piece in the middle wasn't as long as  I expected.
3.0,not enough protection
3.0,"The shirt itself is a lovely cut and the size was true and it looked to be well made but it is completely see through. Like, I can read a book clear as day through it kind of see through which was much more than I expected. If you don't mind the serious sheer then you will likely love the shirt especially if you are curvey or large busted as the cut is very flattering but for me I requested a refund. Its just too sheer to wear to work which is what I bought it for."
3.0,"Very nice, but run small.  They fit tight in the waist."
3.0,The outfit is pretty much as pictured.  The only thing that stops me from giving this more stars is the weird way the crotch kind of hangs.... But for not much money I got exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,You have to be very petite to get a fit like the model on the product images.  I fit me too tight :/ but it’s a very nice too..
3.0,Constantly fell out but pretty!
3.0,The faux leather is cheap after one wear it is peeling I am not rude I would recommend it
3.0,The gold looks different in person. More of a little kid bracelet. Got it as a gift for my sister. We will see if she likes it.
3.0,Nice shorts but they don’t have enough room in the crotch & thighs. Not for men who have bigger thighs but the waist fits well.
3.0,"Pretty ring, it's cheap, you can tell, but should get me through the summer."
3.0,"Item was great . Bought for my son who is 10 to listen to music on way to school. Most of the stitch in the hat come undone and the speakers fell out. I was very excited about this hat , but it didnt meet my expectations."
3.0,It's very thin and very sheer. They're not made for taller people as they stop half a foot above my ankles
3.0,they all ok
3.0,The clips that hold the shirt down seem to work well enough. The part that adjusts the length broke immediately on one and the other followed the next day. Luckily I'm tall enough for them to still work for me.
3.0,"Bought this shirt based on bust measurement, but it ran large and made everything all over too large.  This shirt is not fitted as in the picture."
3.0,Too small for normal man wrists. Looks nice and quality seems good. Just not long enough.
3.0,"the beanie is ok, is warm enough and i like the forhead piece, it really keeps you warm which prevents the winter headaches. Now, the mouse has turned out to be a bit greedy. (to the surprise of no one)  this is a bit too munch for a beanie, you can get one for $5 or a mask for $10, this is mostly for star wars fans."
3.0,The brown is actually burgundy and material is nice and thick but looks too shiny in my opinion.
3.0,This is amazingly comfortable and fit as expected. I bought 2 more because of the comfort. However I wear them for pajamas. They do not wash well and do not look good as a dress once washed. But they are the most comfortable pajamas I own.
3.0,"This scarf (A22) is a perfect square. There is not much to work with. If you have a small chest, it will work great. Ladies with a chest, you will have no ends to wrap around or even tuck in so it stays on. Love the colors! Sad it will have to go to my 6 year old."
3.0,"You get what you pay for here. There are a lot of socks with decent designs, but they are extremely thin and fit small."
3.0,Lost color within one wash
3.0,I disliked that the earrings back part broke after A couple of uses but they are really cute!
3.0,The michael kors letters have fallen off
3.0,I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I saw it in the store.  The picture is more vivid than the actual necklace.  The back is hollowed out and looks kind of cheap.  It would have been nice if the baked enamel was on the back.
3.0,"These pants ran large on the waist and fits below the waistline. Not really on the hips, but between both the hips and waist. If I decide to keep, I will definitely have to wear a belt. They have a huge gap in the back."
3.0,It helps some but I really don't use it much anymore...
3.0,"Is great for a gift, which she really loves it"
3.0,"its super thin but other than that i love the product. great for the fall and spring, but not winter. other than that its a great product."
3.0,Loved the color however it’s not that simple to put on as the magnet is very strong (as it should be ) and it snags all my sleeves! It’s fine for occasional wear but not everyday -
3.0,Love the hat fits perfect it's kind of like an iron-on it's not bad but I prefer a patch that was stitched in but still happy
3.0,These run small and really are not much maternity wise for support and do not breathe at all
3.0,"These are very nice. The deep, intense color, however, makes me think these are dyed. Very unlikely you will find emeralds this color for so cheap."
3.0,"Necklace was lovely and a good price, but item arrived broken.  Wish it wasn't."
3.0,These shirts have a tendency to creep up because they are too short.  I am constantly trying to pull it down.  This is not a ladies corset if that is what you are expecting.  And it sounds like many of the 1 star ratings were expecting that.  This fits like a new mens athletic shirt.  Tight.  The big difference is that cotton athletic shirts quick lose that snug feeling that we like.  This has spandex and will keep that snug feeling for quite some time I suspect.  I didnt like the accent piping.  It looks stupid to start in the front and end in the back.  What were they thinking?
3.0,The anklet has a tendency to come apart at the clasp as it is not soldered together well enough.
3.0,Soooo the cut of this is wrong. So it wants to puff out unless the sting tied on the back is tight. Because it the top rides up even a little . The sides next to the boobs bulges out . If it had maybe a lace up in the back? Something supporting more of the top area . Maybe even some elastic idk. It’s a weird top guys. Cute if you wanna add something to it to help it stay in place.
3.0,"I bought it for a gift, so I am not sure how it's gonna hold up to wear and tare. But upon looking at it I am please"
3.0,"TOO SMALL IN MID SECTION, BUT VERY CUTE"
3.0,Three had holes in them. Not worth the hassle of returning.
3.0,"While these are decent quality and come with a nice quantity, the screw is just too long. There's barely any way to hide it. It constantly looks like I've got a booger. If you prefer l-shaped but can handle corkscrew, these aren't the ones for you."
3.0,Nice dress but runs small. Not US  size
3.0,Cheap material and printed
3.0,"I have a closet full of size 7 shoes, and I often purchase a 37 if the shoes are sized in the European way. According to this size chart, I should buy a 38, which I did. A mistake. 37 would have fit, 38 is too big. No surprise. I will return these size 38s at my own cost (be aware, no free returns!). Will not purchase again. Too much money and trouble for this project."
3.0,"The earrings are cute. The part that goes into your hole bends fairly easy but for the price, can't complain!"
3.0,"This is more of a liner for a face mask.<br />I will not trust this to wear alone.<br />You will need another layer of protection!<br />I will sew this into a cotton face mask, for added protection, and fashion my own, from this pattern.<br />Thank you!"
3.0,It doesn't look nice on me. I gave it to someone else.
3.0,The Earrings was not bad.  It could have been more sparkly but I guess it'll do for my purposes of every day wear.
3.0,not strong
3.0,"These are very pretty, but the flowers are quite small, so they are not as visible as we would have liked.  They were also very fragile, and we had to be very careful with them to prevent the flowers from falling off."
3.0,"Pretty hat, a little small."
3.0,un canguro nice ¡¡¡¡
3.0,Not a fan of the fabric- super thin!
3.0,I liked the two clips to help secure into your hair.
3.0,Not true to size- larger.  Color was way off.  I ordered pink.  Pink to them was a washed out apricot color (bland).  Will probably not wear it out of the house.
3.0,"The material was nice and it seemed well made, but the picture of the dress on the model did not look like my own picture when I tried it on.  So back it went."
3.0,These were very comfortable and didn't put my hair but the fogged up after 2 laps...disappointing.
3.0,"Very thin material, although it is soft, it is kinda sheer, I have to wear a white tank top under it or you'd be able to see the skin. The sizing is very large and almost falls off of me. Overall, it would be a fun shirt for the summer and has cute features, it is just too big and too sheer for me. It's not really super practical for me to wear daily."
3.0,I was disappointed and won’t wear them with a dress and I’m a Nine West fan
3.0,I loved this watch until it broke and the paperwork said it had a life time guarantee and I can't find a way to contact the seller .
3.0,Your getting what you pay for just think of it that way. I didn't give it as a Christmas gift like I planned because it looked and felt cheap
3.0,"These were just smaller than I expected. I'm sure they're great on a smaller face, but I prefer the style of oversized sunglasses more so than this style. The quality seemed good."
3.0,Dint hold very well.
3.0,Ok product but when wrapped around my neck twice it did not hang well
3.0,For $11.00.....you get what you pay for. Pretty cheesy item. It fell apart when I opened the envelope. lol
3.0,Band is decently priced.  Doesn't quite match the color of the space gray apple watch (series 0) and the connectors are a little tough to get on
3.0,Didn't like the material. But it looked alright on. Sent it back
3.0,Very difficult to close down once in your nose
3.0,I was expecting so much more out of these but they weren't true to size so we couldn't use them at all.  Please Alert customers to buy a size up!
3.0,"This is a women's cashmere beanie--one size. The cashmere is very soft, and the color is a nice pale gray. The beanie is very thin and seems to run a little small for a one size item. I don't have a large head and once on, it works it way up until it is no longer completely on your head.  You can't turn up the edges once it is on because they have sewn the label right at the edge, so rolling a small cuff will reveal the label and car instructions--basically looking like you are wearing it inside out. Frankly, it is rather unremarkable. Very soft, thin, and a bit on the small side. The biggest draw back to the beautiful cashmere, is it is dry clean only. The item is not currently available at Amazon, so I cannot comment on the price of this item."
3.0,"nice looking swimsuit with a great color however, the material is not tight enough for tummy control.  The rouching is a nice feature as is the straps that are adjustable."
3.0,I added some extra string so it can fit<br />The moon is made of silver<br />The sun pendant is loose and is made of fake gold paint.
3.0,"Got to say I was really impressed when I received it. Nice box. Cut foam, sizing tool and instructions. Watch looked great. It however does not appear to be very well made. It has stopped working once and the time has been off 3 times so far. It seems that the crown pulls out too easy and not secure when closed. Not what I expected!"
3.0,Too glassy in appearance
3.0,"Ordered 3 pairs, size xxl. I'm normally size 16/18. All were different widths. These 2 pairs differed by nearly 4"".  Great fabric, has slight give. Washes and wears well. A keeper if you can find a properly sized pair. Took me 2 tries."
3.0,My product came with some very gross yellow gunk inside the mask. I cleaned it the best I could. I'm also missing whatever pieces hold the mask and eyepatch together/up. Very saddened.
3.0,I really really liked this top but the arms were really tight.  The draping in the front is only secured in one tiny spot (at the top) so you need a cami or something underneath so your bra doesn't show when you move.
3.0,It is to big for me
3.0,Blouse is shorter than expected
3.0,The jacket is ok.  It is made out of cotton. It needs ironing after washing to give it any kind of shape.
3.0,This sweater arrived in a size FAR SMALLER than their chart stated. The only saving grace was that the sweater was made well (thick) and the company representative (not Amazon) tried to help with suggesting another item. Although that item was not to my liking I appreciated the assistance and following refund.
3.0,"Plain white mask that gets the job done. I'm happy that it's eco-friendly, though I read into the brand and some data seems missing or misleading about how sustainable they are. Still better than other options! I wish they made them in nude and black colors. I also wish they offered a different shape, these accordion style masks always leave gaps near the cheeks. Comfortable. I wonder if anyone else noticed a smell or if it's just my breath"
3.0,"When ordering, I swore the description said that I was ordering a 3 pack of boxers. What I received today was a single pack of underwear.  You will want to make sure that you screenshot the description when ordering and absolutely make sure that it says ""3 pack"" vs ""1 pack"".<br />  The material is soft, but not the softest that I have had, the band is not scratchy, and the fit and finish is not perfect.  I personally can't tell the difference between the cotton and bamboo . For the price that people are charging for boxers these days you would think that they would be able to somehow jump into the washing machine and wash themselves after a long hard day!<br />  I will give them this, the material is very breathable and they do have a good stretch.  I think that $12 plus tax is too much for what you are getting, I can not recommend these underwear."
3.0,Runs tight in the bust area (40) and length was kinda short (5'6)  Bought L
3.0,It was to small and the color is already fade out.not happy about the product
3.0,"Not the best, they don’t have a Velcro closure so they’re hard to put on."
3.0,"Fit a little small, and it does run easily. I don't think it's meant to last, wear once or twice and will need to be tossed."
3.0,Had to return ordered a six for my son and they where way too tight on him
3.0,I was really excited to get this bra. I have been wanting a strapless bra that actually works. the cup is a bit big but it can still work. I am not totally in love with color and material.
3.0,You always run the risk of having or getting a seam tear shock makes the bag useless
3.0,So super cute but runs incredibly small. This is supposed to be a 12 month but doesn’t fit my 18lb 4 month old.
3.0,"I purchased this item based on the fact it was listed as a compression tank. I had surgery and needed the extra support.  Fabric is flimsy, not compression at all.  For the price will keep as an undergarment,  but shouldn't be listed as compression.  Very misleading."
3.0,Doesn’t look as attractive as in ur ad. Too simple looking
3.0,A good supporting bra that is also comfortable and easy to wear. I like the wider straps at the top of the shoulder. I I I usually have a problem with slippage of the straps and they stayed in place all day. The material is comfortable and breathable. A nice touch of femininity in a full support bra.
3.0,Pros:<br />The material is absolutely great<br />Fast delivery and good packaging<br />Looks like the picture<br /><br />Cons:<br />Really big so it doesn't fit well
3.0,"It's okay for the price. Print isn't very vibrant. It'd be nice if they'd make a version in metal like many of the other ones licensed through the NCAA, which are much better quality."
3.0,I really love this bag. It's really well made and is perfect to take to court hearings as it fits all my case files. My only issue is the handles are sewn crappy so I will have to re sew them myself to keep them from falling apart.
3.0,"I really like the style and the slippers, just that they run a bit large."
3.0,The glasses are fine and built great but being a guy I like my lenses bigger than what these offer. If have a small face or a woman I think these would be fine but kinda small for a man.
3.0,Cute shirt but cut very boxy. Not flattering.
3.0,"I bought 3 pairs and I wish I had bought a different brand. By the end of the day, these are down between my calf and ankle. They are comfortable except for that one problem. I wouldn't purchase them again."
3.0,This is a nice outfit for a last minute occasion. Get a size larger than what you usual wear.
3.0,"Cute shirt, fits well. However- the tags were cut out like it was previously owned by someone else. I wasn’t aware I was buying secondhand clothing."
3.0,"This looked so cute, but was just not made for my body type. I have a larger chest and wider hips and the usual size I order in other suits was not supportive up top and didn't provide enough coverage on the bottom. Very cute, just not for me, so I sent it back!"
3.0,"I like the fabric and feel, she loves them and doesn't fuss when putting them on. My daughter is 16 months and I bought the 3t size and it actually fits her perfectly. So idk if I have an above average daughter, or if the sizing is small. But it worked for her legs and back, but because of the way it sits in the front, she still leaks out the top of her diaper/undies. So I'm still having to wash her bed and blankets everyday. And she wakes up with wet clothes. Very disappointed, I was really excited and hopeful that she could sleep comfortably and stop waking up because she leaked. But I guess it's never ending until she is fully potty trained."
3.0,I like the lens color of these in the overall shape but there’s zero contour for your face. So they sit really really flat on your face which I think looks incredibly strange.
3.0,Japanese’s Shun chefs knife does not fit. Width to small.
3.0,"Well I want to be as positive as possible while writing this, but I also want to stay honest as well. First of all they are made of a strong materials and I feel they will work for a long time. As I work as an Alaskan Bus Tour Guide I am moving around all day and they keep my shirt tucked in really well. It helps me stay professional looking and I can avoid tucking my shirt in all day long. As with the comfort, I am not sure I could wear them everyday. It may just take some more getting used to but as I wear them they rub against my legs funny. Also when standing you can tell I am wearing something under my pants because the strap running up your leg. Once again give them a try if you are in need of keeping that professional look while moving around in dress shirts. I was discounted on these, but for the price they are definitely worth the price."
3.0,"i found the material little too hard. i washed it many times before i could wear it. fit is OK, but the pockets make your hips wider."
3.0,"These glasses are comfortable and work well,  but there is a basic flaw in the design that causes the bridge to break.  I bought several pairs for my husband to keep in the cars and for work because they are wide enough for his head to fit without squeezing and when the first three pairs broke in the exact same place at almost the same time, I thought that was an odd coincidence and ordered some more. The last set had had the same problem and he's not hard on glasses. I would recommend them for comfort,  but not for construction quality.  It's been a total of five pairs with this issue."
3.0,"I love the fit. I'm 5'3"" and160 lbs, curvy figure. I wore no shapewear (obvi) and loved the fit and comfort. BUT as soon as I saw the color change between the trim and body fabrics, I was concerned.  The coloring looks more uniform from a distance, but there's definitely a miss in matching the colors. The full body shots are in artificial lighting and the partials are in natural or combined lighting."
3.0,"Cute and vintage. I liked it but the small chain is very fragile, mine broke when it got caught on something."
3.0,The size was wrong too large for a 4 year old
3.0,It's very pretty but just too thin.  My original two are much bigger and stand out much better.
3.0,Too narrow. Returned
3.0,These stay on pretty good but man are your ears sore afterwards.
3.0,"They are great earrings and well made, BUT the sizes are off. The 8mm are more like 10mm. They latch well and are well made and did not tarnish."
3.0,stones are larger than I like but they work for a quick replacement if you lose a nose ring. bigger stone tends to get pulled out by accident ALOT! Super Fast shipping from this company
3.0,Nice shirt.  Just too small.  If your thick like oatmeal.  Size it.
3.0,Odd fit. Short arms and long torso. Very cute design but didn’t work for my 11 year old.
3.0,"The material is stretchy and doesn’t feel good. It did not look good either, nothing like the picture."
3.0,Firm in the front
3.0,"Very cheap feel. I do not see this tee lasting very long. Bought as a gift.<br />Though the screen print is cute, worried how long it will last as well."
3.0,Like the suit but it runs big
3.0,Second time buying this shirt. Decent quality and comfortable. The downside is I wear it to the gym and it seems to hold body odor more than my other gym shirts.
3.0,"This dress is unlined chiffon-y fabric and totally see-through. I could imagine some colors/patterns being better than others with this, but as the description explicitly states ""not see-through,"" I got the lighter color--what a mistake. I have to wear a slip, which totally defeats the purpose of a ""light, flowy"" dress. Really disappointing, as the cut and pattern are very cute."
3.0,"Not as stretchy as you would think, kinda tight."
3.0,It’s ok I did not feel like this was really cold shoulder at least the one I received the openings are small
3.0,This product was a little bit deceiving. I was hoping for a full amethyst instead of one tiny bottom right stone that looks like is the only amethyst colored stone on here. It is a pretty design pretty sturdy chain that is short. Value for money is OK I’m just really confused about the one purple stone in the bottom corner. It has a neat card and pouch that comes with it. Decent for costume jewelry
3.0,"The description says &#34;seamless toe seam.&#34; It's not a bulky seam but it's not seamless. With arthritic toes, I need one that is actually seamless."
3.0,Very heavy and thick...
3.0,The product pictured was not what e received. The one pictured is white and ours were blue. Fit is small.
3.0,Fit is not the same as the cotton sports bras. They also hold body heat in.
3.0,I return because it’s not exactly what I was looking for but seems of like a very durable bag
3.0,"The colors aren’t as pictured it looks pretty faded,I’d still wear it but I thought it would fit a lot looser ;-; so I just gave it away to one of my coworkers"
3.0,Stone fell out after two weeks
3.0,ruined after 1st wash
3.0,Super warm and big. Love it! The only thing is the neck opening could have a snap or be bigger.
3.0,"I just received the watch today. It seems ok. The crown doesn’t screw down tight so how can it be water resistant. To me, the blue face seems too fluorescent. The band seems to have indentations for micro adjustments, but can’t figure how to make the adjustment. Will wear for a few days and decide if I’m going to keep it."
3.0,Ordered for maternity shoot. Too small around belly for my need.  Ordered 2sizes up per other reviews. Pretty though. Will be returning
3.0,"I'd like them to be a tad higher, but they're comfy and do what they're supposed to do.  You can't wear them in your shoes though.  They'll squish your toes."
3.0,"It was *very* inexpensive, so I'm taking that into consideration in giving it 3 stars.  I've had it for about a week and it seems to be functioning just fine.  I ordered this because I haven't had a chance to get to a store to replace the battery on my other watch - and this was actually cheaper than a new battery!  The face is a little bigger than I would prefer, but it does make it very easy to read.  I've never been a big fan of the stretchy bands, which this has, but it will do until I'm able to get my other watch to the repair shop for a new battery."
3.0,Too large/stretchy in the top area and not as long as pictured.  This model must be seriously short.  Soft/comfy material.
3.0,"This bra might work for some people but for me  (40C) it didn't provide much support or, to be frank, nipple coverage.  I'm pretty sure for someone with a smaller bust the bra would work fine.  I might still wear the bra, but I just didn't like the material it was made of, but I'm sensitive to certain materials."
3.0,the pic is a bit deceiving the strings around the top do not wrap around twice
3.0,"It’s what it says it is… a hoodie, nothing special.. I like the material in the hood, the material inside the shirt, not so much.. it’s just regular old sweatshirt material, nothing special.."
3.0,"The top was perfect for the size I ordered, but the shorts fit like they were a size too small."
3.0,"Great style and price. However, theres a logo and writing on one of the legs (no indication in description or photos of writing)."
3.0,"Both the key chains are broken after little use. Not made to withstand being in a pocket for very long. They are really cute though, and still like to have them as keepsakes."
3.0,"Smell is funny but after washed, it is ok.  Disappointed in the fit, it runs small so I had to order a second one and now I have 2."
3.0,"Cheap gift but cute...the person I bought it for loves it, it matches her scrubs"
3.0,It was too thick and a half an inch to long.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but the first time trying it on, the strap clasp broke."
3.0,Good for wearing around the house and taking the garbage out.
3.0,"Wider around the waist than expected. I have as mall waist so for me it was a deal breaker but if you have a little extra around the waist, Im sure it'll be perfectly good"
3.0,"Everyday wear for work, but it didn’t help either the alarm and the face, fades."
3.0,"This bracelet was a great buy, unfortunately the link that hold the clasp broke two hours after I put it on to go to work. The seller was very helpful and let me return it and purchase a sturdier bracelet they had for sale that I liked better. I only gave this three stars because it's a delicate, not a very sturdy, bracelet and could have been a better piece for the price."
3.0,"The skirt is very flowy and long, but the skirt makes it look MUCH more luxurious."
3.0,I love this ring and will probably continue to wear it but I ordered a 6 for my pinky and the size 6 I received measures as an 8 1/2?? I can't wear it on my pinky that's for sure. But it's a lovely ring regardless of the sizing issue.
3.0,Cute for price little big but cute
3.0,"Cute, but they were much smaller than I thought they would be."
3.0,Cheaply designed for the price
3.0,They are cute a little bit small but cute the design doesn’t really look the same tho on a few
3.0,"One good thing is this rectangular shape fits my patio well, much better than the round I had.  This one does NOT have the roller crank so basically it''s up....or down. No middle ground, however that does simplify using it<br /><br />It's also not very well made, and very flimsy; when upright, the pole bows slightly. I would really rate this as Walmart quality and highly recommend never leaving this up with any kind of wind chances"
3.0,It was smaller than a regular size xl and the sleeves were short too. The finish and stitching wasn't very good.
3.0,Returned due to fit and not the desired color
3.0,Don't the tie back.
3.0,"Let's get some positives out of the way first. To begin with, this watch is nothing if not attractive. The woodworking is good quality, the finish is nice with no noticeable flaws, and the design is eye-catching. It comes in a gift box, with a small screwdriver for adding/removing links, a spare link, and even a small set of beads, which was a particularly thoughtful touch.<br /><br />Here's the problem: the pins are literally impossible to remove, meaning -- at least for my particular watch -- the size it was straight out of the box is the size I was stuck with. It fit fine on my right wrist, but since I'm right-handed, I prefer to wear my watch on my left wrist, where it didn't fit. Taking out a link or two would have been fine, had it worked, but unlike any other watch I've tried to change links (or bands) on, this one absolutely would not budge.<br /><br />If I were grading on looks and packaging alone, this watch would easily get five stars. However, the fact that I can't get a good fit makes it impractical for my purposes, and means that you should probably proceed with caution if you're planning on buying one."
3.0,The fit was okay but the dress was too sheer .
3.0,It’s not as tight as I wish it was. It doesn’t really do much.
3.0,"I ordered them for the red polka dot socks.  When I got them, most of the colors were there, but not the red ones.<br />When I looked closer, it said variety may differ.  I was disappointed."
3.0,These pants fit everywhere except the crutch. I looked like I had a penis when I sat down and baggy when I stood. NOT a good look. Normally though Jessica Simpson pants are awesome so maybe just this pair was defective.
3.0,It is gorgeous and a steal for the price but the sizing is a bit off. I usually wear a large but this fit more like a medium.
3.0,"As a stay-at-home mom I find it really hard to get dressed everyday and put makeup on just to be in the house. I find myself wearing more loungewear throughout the week than anything else. I thought this dress would be a great way for me to be in the house look cute and be able to answer the door without running to find pants first. However when I finally received the dress it didn't go exactly as I expected. The picture of the model wearing the dress is a picture of the dress from a distance and that's exactly how it would look but close up it looks completely different. When I tried the dress on it clung to every curve that I have and not in a flattering way. I did do my research and I looked at the women who tried the dress on before I bought it and I felt that some of the people should not have been wearing it and if it looks decent on them it would probably look better on me but I was wrong this is the type of dress that you would need to wear a long slip underneath because the material is very thin it was still your bra line it will show any roll or curve you have on your body and it will show your panty line that's how tight it is. It does not flare out at the bottom is much. It's more form-fitting on someone that needs to lose some weight such as myself. The v-neck was very low. I am a 38DDDD, or 38G. All I saw when I put this dress on was my butt my hips and my breasts and what tummy I have. I feel very uncomfortable wearing this dress around the house let alone in public. I will keep the dress So when I lose the weight I can see how it fits but the length is absolutely perfect for my height and it will probably be longer when I lose some weight"
3.0,These are alright.  The color isn't quite what was shown.  The wore isn't coated in plastic and is very stiff and hard to manage.
3.0,"Cardigan is cute, but the material is very thin, you could see through it."
3.0,"Size chart is not correct.  Should be a full size smaller than one would think, because of that they are a bit hard to wear and uncomfortable.  Slip off the feet easily.  They are well made however."
3.0,"Just received these beautiful pettipants, but mislabeled as xxl. Fit more like a regular large size. So pretty, but had to return."
3.0,Very pretty!!!! But it is tarnishing after a month where the part is in the nose. I have to hide the tarnish part.
3.0,"Great value, but the wire wants to spin in the hole where it connects to the acrylic"
3.0,This was purchased as a gift so no info on fit but quality is good and delivery was fast.
3.0,I am a size 13 shoe. Socks are on the small side
3.0,the material on the arm is a little strange. It is more of a lighter red then in the picture.
3.0,"Very comfortable but the peachy colour ring is more of a shiny pink. Its horrible. Other than that, i love them"
3.0,"It's smaller than hoped and I liked a different scarf better but overall, no huge complaints."
3.0,Kinda thin material - not as thick as I was hoping for and it is a bit snug so if you don’t like it snug definitely order a size or two bigger.
3.0,"I loved this thing for 1 week and then tonight I just noticed the spinner had broken off and I was just wearing the chain so I’m pretty sad about that, I’ll search my house and car but if it"
3.0,It’s a little smaller then actual normal size on me. I got the XL size which is usually loose and comfy on me. It’s snug. It’s thin and lightweight for sure. Will update after wearing it more.
3.0,It’s says it’s cotton but it says modal/cotton blend so I’m dissatisfied. This is the second time the description isn’t accurate. Chinese brands are tricky.
3.0,Necklace is a little large
3.0,Burgundy not red color fits okay shows ever curve or flaw
3.0,"It's very pretty until it gets washed, then it looks dingy. The size runs small."
3.0,It fits great i thought it was gonna be longer like the picture but was like gaucho
3.0,The hat is ok. The quality is kinda cheap but for the price i guess is ok.
3.0,"The material is so flimsy, and it's crap quality, but my daughter loves it."
3.0,Should be a bit more thicker perhaps. Thanks.
3.0,"Nice product but the purple is WRONG. I love Lilac purple which was not the purple I got, I received a darker color purple. Which is okay but wish it was as described.."
3.0,"Bought xxl. I normally wear xl shirts, but read that these run small. Still too small, especially since it is thin and a cami is needed. It's close, so I will keep it, but I was a little disappointed. It's a really cute top."
3.0,"I love this jacket so much...I have 2 of them!!!  It is perfect for 3 season wear!!!  ADD ON:  after a couple of washes the color held up fine but the fabric looked like the jacket was 5 years old!!  Fine to hang out watching movies at home, but not to wear to my office as was the original intention. BUMMER!"
3.0,Okay buy
3.0,Love the color and design Runs too small.
3.0,"Very very comfortable—would’ve given it 5 stars, but they are see through so I can’t wear them out of the house. Fine for lounging though!"
3.0,Smells weird . Took a long time to deliver- but a nice mask.
3.0,tight arms and short torso.
3.0,"So small, barely noticeable.  Diamond not held in tightly enough."
3.0,"Yashiros little thingy pin tie eyes keep coming off that wasn’t made that well, but other then that it was lovely!"
3.0,"Color is great. It does fit around the top.  The length is a bit long. Slightly large, flowy. I bought a medium.  I guess it is good for leggings. I wouldn't use for jeans. Material is very thin. I am not sure how long it will look nice. It already has that permanent crinkle from the first wash-delicate cycle in a laundry bag, hang dry. It does wrinkle if you sit when you wear it. The thin material will be good for spring. Ok to wear layer undershirt for cooler weather. I bought a medium. I am 5'2', 150 lb, 36c.  I would have to wear and wash a few times before i decided to buy another. (john's Wife)"
3.0,The size was right and it looks nice.
3.0,These things were VERY difficult to insert. I actually ended up really irritating my peircing trying to get it in and giving up. I then cut part of the curl end off. They stick out more then i had anticipated.
3.0,"Maybe I need a smaller size, but I don’t feel like the flaps hold my business as advertised."
3.0,These seems to be way too long for a small. I’m a woman with a petit wrist and it almost wraps around. But I like the olive green color so I kept it.
3.0,"For the price you can't beat it. Very stretchy,  I am only 5'0'' so I wish it were a little shorter in length but this is to be expected for my height. I am 115lbs, 32DD bust and ordered xsmall, fits perfectly. It will most definitely need ironed and the sewing/seems are poor in the breast area but I am hoping to trim them and fingers crossed ironing it will help the inseam lay down correctly. Zipper gets a little stuck also. Overall I would probably purchase this dress again for the price. Just needs a little more attention to detail is all!"
3.0,"Love the fit and it’s pretty , don’t really think the thin lace was really helpful a stronger fabric on the cross sections would probably make it much better"
3.0,"They were a bit hard to put in the shoes, had to open up the holes with something first and then really push hard."
3.0,"The lace is lovely, the garment is not made well with only one small seam holding the lace on...but the chemical is very strong. Be prepared to wash several times by hand to get the smell out."
3.0,"This was much smaller than I expected it to be, I had to buy 2 to glue together so it could be seen on my purse."
3.0,"My son loves these shoes, but they don't slip on easily with socks, as they're a little narrow."
3.0,Great hat but mine was more grey than navy
3.0,Not as good quality as the French Toast brand but still reasonably priced.
3.0,"I was not expecting this pullover to look like candy cane stripes, but that’s what it reminds me of.  The quality is great, washes and wears great, but I don’t think it was advertised correctly, so that was disappointing.  However, wearing during winter especially thru the holidays was nice and festive, but not purpose of purchase."
3.0,"The style and pink color are fine.  I know it is sold as lightweight but still, it is much flimsier than expected for the price."
3.0,"The charms were smaller than the recipient was hoping for...my mistake for ordering the ""mini"" size."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for someone, and though I haven't seen him wear it yet, when I opened it, I thought it seemed to be sort of a wide-and-short fit.  Otherwise, it seems okay."
3.0,Super baggy and awkward looking. Will throw it in the washer on high heat to hopefully shrink it a bit. Good for lounging around the house and good for summer.
3.0,They are very beautiful but not very comfortable. They have no stretch at all and the itch my nose like crazy. I’m already looking to buy new ones.
3.0,"the design on the front is not proportioned to my face, the lips are too big!"
3.0,Red fades over time. Would be better without the collar.
3.0,"I liked this dress. But, I did not like the material on the bottom. But it’s srill a nice dress. True to size. I am 5’4” 150 pounds and I ordered a Medium and it fits."
3.0,"I'm small in size, but was expecting a closer fit since I order small. The material composition is not what I expected -- was expecting more fleece fibers to cling closer to my skin."
3.0,it is difficult to figure out and kind of heavy
3.0,The letters are already coming off.
3.0,Quality was ok. White tee thin. Neck is HUGE and being that this is lycra it won't shrink much. Make sure you like wide open necks.
3.0,"It's like is described, but it came ripped."
3.0,"Sadly the negative was bad enough I had to return them. Hopefully you can see from the pictures, that there is 2 different colors to the lenses. This isn't so bad most of the time, but when you look out of your peripheral vision or turn your eyes to look, it changes color and messes with your head. It is very annoying when driving especially. Other than the two tone, I like both colors. If the lenses have been either of the two colors I would have kept them. However, I have never liked two tone lenses."
3.0,I like but never use .. super big for me
3.0,great price - quality just good
3.0,Material is very thin and clingy not bad for the price
3.0,"Disappointed it didn't arrived on time. However, still fits. Was supposed to use it for work during the time the movie &#34;IT&#34; release. I mean still good though....."
3.0,"Pretty but a little too big for my wrist, even after I tried to squeeze it a little tighter. Other than that I really liked it."
3.0,"Their warm and dry after an hour shoveling, I recommend them BUT...get them two (2) sizes larger, not the one (1) size larger as manufacturer recommends. Totally worth $29.00"
3.0,"I was excited about these leggings for the color and the fleece lining.  The color looked great, and the leggings were warm and cozy.  These are some thick leggings and would be great for the cold weather.  Unfortunately, these were too small for me.  I'm not sure if it is this brand or what it could be.  But I wear a medium in most leggings, sometimes a small.  I didn't think I would need a large.  Overall, I would give these 3 stars.  The look, feel, quality, and warmth are all great.  I would love to at least give it 4 stars, but these were too small, and I am unsure of the comfort level and performance."
3.0,It's a bit long.  I was not expecting it to be so wide and long...
3.0,This was too small for me. I actually cut out the pack portion of foam in the helmet to get it to fit. It looked great. No one noticed and my group of friends who each bought an identical helmet won a costume contest wearing them! It fit everyone else fine.
3.0,Great lights crowd loved them dancing nice fun for kids and adults. Party favorites look great on a darker dance floor
3.0,"I loved the length of this dress, but the center triangle was not attached to the dress. I had to pin it down to stay put. Other than that it was a beautiful dress. Wish there was a red bow though."
3.0,"I really love this jacket, and would have given it 5 stars...but they must have used a huge amount of the chromium leather tanner on it because My neck broke out in a major allergic reaction :(  Its so bad that I can't wear the jacket anymore.  So upset.<br />Also, the packaging was awful.  They shoved the jacket in one of those cheap black plastic bags and slapped a shipping label on it.  Didn't come with any tags or anything.  I was willing to forgive all that and love the jacket, but now I can't even wear it.  Oh there was also a small stain on it that Amazon handled beautifully for me.<br />Other than that the jacket is beautiful.  Made well and comfortable.  Beautiful fit and lovely."
3.0,In all honesty I like these socks. However they said they should fit size 7-11 and they are too small (more like a size 4-7). There's barely any stretch or give to the material or rather no stretch at all. If they were made with elastic it would be the perfect sock addition. It's such a pity cause I really like the socks. I'll use them still. Will keep my fingers crossed that by washing them would help to loosen up the fibers to give more stretch.
3.0,It feels a little like cardboard and runs a little small.  I may go back to the original band and keep looking for another band as this isn't what I wanted
3.0,"It's a really cute cut. The main problems are that it runs 1-2 sizes smaller than American sizes, and the material is thin."
3.0,Fairly tall on the wrist but lovely texture
3.0,WalMart won't put prescription in these eyes.  They don't have the proper<br />screw to put lens into the frames.  I took these gorgeous eyes to 4 different WalMarts put to other eye care shop they all said the same thing No.
3.0,Fantastic color/design.<br />Novelty sock with thin material; Do not expect to last with heavy use.
3.0,Order by the size measurements a large fits like extra small
3.0,"5’2”, 120 lbs, 34D. Small fits perfectly. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. I took off a couple stars because the material is very thin and there’s a lot of loose stitching/hanging threads throughout the dress. I don’t know how this will hold up so I am returning it. For the quality, this dress should be priced lower."
3.0,"First of all, it's not what I would call a sweater but more like thick t-shirt material. It's also a bit shorter than the picture. I'm 5'6&#34; and 140 so I bought a medium. Fits nice but very short, as you can see from the pictures I took. The asymmetric part is also different than I thought it would be. Great shirt but not a dress at all..."
3.0,This was very cute and felt like quality but sizing was off. I returned it.
3.0,"The studs I received were solid black instead of the faux carbon fiber that the cuff links have, but the price was right."
3.0,"This is a nice size for my 5'2'' self, fabric feels nice and flows. Description said GREEN! This is very blue. Disappointing, green is my favorite color, and it would resemble a Luna Moth if it were green! Still, it looks nice and I will use it, but with less enthusiasm than I would if it were green."
3.0,"A cute design, the quality is ok, but the sleeves are too short and too tight for the 3T size. The size 4T doubles in price."
3.0,I purchased these to help with a super tight inseam and they seem to work better for widening the foot area but not stretching inseam area.
3.0,very flimsy. not very well made. would not buy again.
3.0,The dress fits nicely and has a cute flow but I will not be able to wear this dress unless it is as a cover-up for a swim suit. It is so clear you can totally see ones underwear.
3.0,I brought a XL since I read the reviews its kinda small but when I wear it was kinda loose I tried to tie it to make it tight but it still feels loose . I shoulda brought the L . it would've fit perfectly. The material is stretchy that's why its loose to me . I'm a curvy girl I wear size 10-12 jeans 36C bust. If you want this skirt go right ahead . I would recommend its awesome just like the pic .
3.0,"You can see the inkjet fade at the bottom of the print. It isn't high quality, the shirt is low quality. For the price, its ok but wouldn't  buy for more than $11 or so."
3.0,"The kids had a fun , safe party !!!"
3.0,Cute sweater and thicker than I imagined. But it is not oversized like the pictures make it seem. I bought my normal size and it fits like a tighter fitting sweater. I wish I would have sized up for a more oversized fit
3.0,loved them. perfect. exactly what I wanted. here months later has not changed color and I wear it 24/7. engraved message is still black. 100% recommend. gave only 3 stars because they wouldn't ship to Puerto Rico which means I had to send to a family member in florida and have them send to me. unnecessary bother. :(
3.0,VERY CUTE WELL MADE PRODUCT but runs very small.order up 2 sizes.
3.0,It's cute just a little loose in the back area
3.0,"This shirt is ok, but that's about it.  It's a very nice color, but I had to wait quite a while for it (shipped from overseas and had to clear customs).  Also, even though I ordered a 2 XL, as advised by looking at the size reviews, it's still on the smallish side.  I'm a bit chesty, so I'm used to clothing being tight in the chest, but it's also narrow at the shoulders.  I was hoping to be able to wear a turtle-neck under it, but there is no way;  I tried, and can't get the shoulders to fit.  Also, this shirt is 100% cotten, which I like, but there was a bit of shrinkage after washing (per the instructions on the shirt and hung to dry), so it's even smaller now and requires touch-up ironing.  I'm only 5'2"", so the lengthy is good, but it is small.  Just be aware, if ordering."
3.0,"This is a nice night shirt, but I don't like that the buttons go all the way down the front. It makes it less comfortable. Other than that, it's cute and fits nice."
3.0,It looks like it would be capable of holding a lot more than you are able. There are many small pockets instead of one or two big ones with a couple small. Not great for use as a book bag.
3.0,squished so had to fluff back up. rubber band breaks easily. I glued my bow to a hair clip instead. awesome price!
3.0,"Not a huge fan and probably bc it ran a bit small and material thin, just my personal opinion."
3.0,"Great leggings. I love everything about them except they roll down at the top. Material is strong but not too thick, the side pockets are well-sewn, and colors are true to what's pictured on the website. If they didn't roll down, I'd be ecstatic."
3.0,This isn’t really a scarf as much as it’s a thin-weight actual American flag. I bought them to give as gifts but I couldn’t because that’s so weird to just give someone a full flag
3.0,Simple design and easy for kids to use. Still pretty cheap materials. Clip broke after one week.
3.0,Very long~<br />I am 5'3&#34; so I expected it to be long but with 4&#34; heels is was still 6&#34; too long<br />$100 to get hemmed because of material type
3.0,didn't look as good as picture
3.0,I wanted to love this shirt so much but it ended up being a flop for me. The material is cheap I wore the shirt once and it has snags all over it. Was hoping it would be better quality but was okay for the occasion I guess.
3.0,"Not long enough and not true to size. I am only 5'5"" and it doesn't even cover my ankles barefooted. The size runs about 1 size too small. The material is nice and not too sheer at all."
3.0,"My previous belt ceased to keep the two pieces of leather parallel when closed with a single prong.  So finding a belt with *three* prongs, I figured that the problem was solved.  That problem was solved but within 9 months, the prongs were no longer horizontal and continually got twisted around each other such that I'd spend several minutes just to close the belt and it began to look shabby and worn and uneven.  So, today, 18 months later, I tossed it in the garbage and replaced it with Dickies Mens 1 1/2 in. Leather Belt With Two Row Stitch, Brown.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this will last a little longer ...."
3.0,Arch support seems to get depressed<br />Have worn a lot around house for16 months.<br />Comfy but got really smelly.<br />Tried to wash yesterday. That was a mistake.<br />Now looking to see what else is out there.<br />If they lasted longer and smelled better I'd buy them again but at this price and only good for a year I have to check other options
3.0,"I should have read the reviews on the Navy and Black SJ02's before committing to the purchase at a good sale price. Bought the size 13's for my 5 y/o son. Cute shoes, but what looks to be white flecks in the product photo are actually all-over sparkly silver accents that lends itself to a more subdued girly appearance. This should be mentioned as a line item in the product description.<br /><br />I am going to see if they appeal to him without mentioning anything gendered. (He did ask me to paint his nails pink once. lol) If he wants to wear them, fine. If not, I will donate them. I have nor the time or patience for returns."
3.0,"Nice design, love that part! But the hemming and the sewing is crooked and not sewn in places.  Fabric fraying, and the material is very light."
3.0,They r beautiful pearls & can be worn for formal or casual attire.
3.0,"great hat, fits better then expected and washes great- made of durable material this hat will not let you down--"
3.0,"Catch is very amateurish and the photo is deceptive as to the length.  I know length is stated, but from the photo looks as though the necklace would fall longer instead of more like a choker."
3.0,"The quality is fine, but the size is smaller than the description stated. I have difficult to cover my glasses."
3.0,Post is wobbly. Ok. Cheaply made.
3.0,"They feelt great. However, as someone that crosses his legs a lot, I find black fuzz all over my knees. When I take the socks off, there is plenty of black fuzz on my feet and especially between my toes. Hopefully a few rounds through the wash will solve this, but I worry about durability."
3.0,Neither my 6 year old and 11 year old will wear this mask. I loved the design and quality of it but they think it's very uncomfortable.
3.0,"The pendant is not anywhere near as nice as it is in the picture.  In the picture, the colors are deep and defined.  The actual pendant is pretty bland, so much so that when I opened it, I thought I received the wrong necklace.  I'll keep it because I need it for a present, but I'm disappointed in that.  I do like the chain though, except I wish it was longer, but that is not the fault of the seller."
3.0,Not a big fan of the lock mechanism screw in ones so much better.. other than that I really like it super pretty but give three stars just because  of the lock
3.0,The know does not hold well because smooth material.
3.0,"The socks are great and the fit is good. The only problem was after wearing once, the toe seam area got a hole. Threw the sock away."
3.0,"This dress fits me perfectly. So why the 3 stars? The material is see through, therefore I have to choose for people to see my pasties or a strapless bra.  Also, the material wrinkles very easily"
3.0,I sized up 2 sizes because I like pajamas roomy and comfortable….they were too small.
3.0,The band was very much too large so I  returned it.
3.0,Smelled horrible. Had to wash before use. Other than. That nice.
3.0,I kept it anyway
3.0,Article runs way too small not meant for heavier set women for women that are busted. Is a very pretty order though
3.0,"Looks well made and it's an attractive money clip. Downsides are: if you carry several credit cards, ID's etc, the slots are very tight and it's tough to get things in and out of the slots. Also, the magnet for holding cash isn't as strong as the one I had before. It does the job ok, but with more than just a few bills it doesn't hold as well as I'd like. Overall it's ok for the price.."
3.0,I did not expect them to be real heavy beads. They are not plastic like the picture my show.
3.0,"I like the style and the size fits well, However, I was disappointed that it is see through and I have to wear a camisole under it."
3.0,I measured carefully and got the size I wanted so they fit my glasses good. They don't cover all the area or go tight on the frames but I didn't expect them to be perfect. The problem is they're bent a bit so they don't go strait and it's a bit annoying
3.0,"I will probably give this dress 3.5 stars but half stars are not possible. It is a cute dress that overall has a nice form and and fall, also the cloth has some stretch which makes it comfortable. The issue is in the bust area. For top heavy women, like me, the bodice fit leaves a lot to be desired. It is tight and makes the bust look mushed.<br />I received the product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,About the same as any that I've had.  Lasts about six and then starts to crack.  If I could find a better one I would buy it.  But they all appear to be about the same.  Not that great.
3.0,"Stunning color. I ordered a small as I am a size 2, but the dress was ill-fitting on me. Because of the fabric, a thin spandex-type, an XS would be too tight and unflattering, especially because the fabric requires a slip underneath. I returned it."
3.0,"They are very pretty and true to the picture , I received some broken . I would recommend these to anybody."
3.0,Very cute sleeves are a little on the wide side
3.0,Too big but nice.
3.0,"I have a question. I received my bracelet and each stone looks &#34;dull in color&#34;. I would think that there should be a &#34;sheen&#34; to each Turquoise stone. I love Turquoise and every one that I have ever seen NEVER  looks &#34;dull&#34; in appearance. The weight is really nice though. I wish the packaging would have looked the same. Why does nice things come in plastic cheap looking packaging?  I have earrings coming too along with Turquoise necklace's for myself and as Christmas gifts. Hope I love those coming. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this bracelet, just disappointed."
3.0,"Almost perfect....Cute style & length for my petite freme.  I bought size Small (stars prints). There’s no stretch to the materials.  The sleeves of the top is very tight and uncomfortable.  The pants fit ok (I like it).  For reference I’m petite 5’4” & 120lbs, normally wear xs to s .  I’m returning it."
3.0,These aren’t US size large shirts
3.0,Is not oversized the way say on description
3.0,The actual band could fit a newborn so you have to rely on the elastic string which means the band itself is all on your forehead. As for the party blowers! Those were great.
3.0,I liked that it was weatherproof but the fabric was too stiff
3.0,"A small is really a small. In fact, I usually fit a small and wished I had gotten a medium.  Other than that, its nice and it looks like the photo.  Its encouraged me to lose about 10 pounds!"
3.0,"The material was on the thin side, but I'm learning most graphic t-shirts bought online now are. The real disappointment, though, was the image was ironed on crooked. I'm not sure I'm going to gift it as planned."
3.0,"If you want these to be even the slightest bit loose, size up 2 sizes. 5’7”, 125 pounds and the mediums were like leggings. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter. Fabric is great, but sizing is so small."
3.0,"Very soft and comfy, but size runs small.... order next size up. Other color ordered fits fine.  Go figure!<br />Not recommended for rain or snow.....too porous.  A good summer shoe and easy for little ones to put on, if so inclined!"
3.0,Several pairs of socks appear to be very thin in some areas.
3.0,"El estado físico de producto, muy bueno. El cronógrafo vino desconfigurado y la batería restante del reloj estaba casi agotada. Por lo demás, buen producto por el precio."
3.0,The fit was good though not as long as I anticipated. The colors faded fast also. Good to sleep in.
3.0,"I bought this hoping it would serve as a carryon travel bag. This is sturdy, but narrows mid-way up, where hooks are for shoulder strap. This makes it difficult to fill and to get into. If you're looking for a purse, it's probably o.k. If you're looking for a travel bag for laptop & other carryon items, I think you should keep shopping."
3.0,"Lovely design, but a bit brighter than the pic would show. Not as earthly as it appeared on my macbook screen. I suppose that's to be considered when buying shirts of this kind of under armour type fabric."
3.0,"Nice material, it clings to the body so I'd suggest sizing up unless you want it tight! I thought i'd like the style of the shirt on me but it's too old-fashion for my taste. Def looks more stylish on the model!"
3.0,"I like it, but the material is very thin and clingy.  I’d like it a lot more if it didn’t cost $32.  Not what I was expecting material wise when I bought it.  But it Fits good and is flowy and comfy."
3.0,"I had this dress for awhile now and it’s really help up for the most part. It fits nicely but it a bit see through, so I recommend getting a darker color or wear something underneath that won’t show any lines."
3.0,Did not show on description that a Large fits an 18-20.  Entirely too big!
3.0,"The product works, just didn't meet expectations...I've tried using it, letting the hat become dry to the touch and hit the hat with steam as well as just spraying it on and not using steam. Unfortunately, I saw and felt no difference between the 2 different types of applications which was disappointing tbh. In light of that I'm planning on using the hairspray on a different hat to see if any difference is noticable.<br /><br />Long story, short; I'm not sure if I'd recommend this or not to be straight. Perhaps I'll try using a larger amount of the product and go from there. If I see any changes then I'll immediately edit my review."
3.0,"I love this watch, however, the first couple of hours it fell off, the link was loose, I never thought to tighten, but now on I’m going to. Then the next day it sounded weird I moved my hand to the left and the back fell off and the weight thing that spins inside the watch fell out. It appears the miniture little screw that holds it in was t tightened. All I want is a working watch sent to me, I’ll send this one back. Please advise I’ve tried emailing"
3.0,"Clip holds cards tightly. Worked incredibly well for first week or so. There are some pieces of a felt like material goes at the opening to provide protection for the cards as they slide in and out. At some point, the felt began feeling away and getting mashed in the opening. This now makes it difficult to move cards in and out, because of both the mashed felt, and exposed adhesive on the opening. It is still usable, but I have to put them in at a modified angle and is best for only a few cards (maybe 2-3 cards). The money clip works fine and holds cash securely. May be tough for those who like to carry lots of cash, as too many bills can be difficult to slide in."
3.0,"I received this item in the mail yesterday as a honeymoon/Christmas gift for my fiance', but to my surprise the cover up is not exactly like this.  The material on the V of the neck is picture perfect, but the cover up is extremely wide and will end up eating my fiance' after she put it on.  The other issue I have is the V of the neck is about the same material as the rest of the cover up.  Its not as see through as shown in this picture.  I will give this item a 3 because the cost is fair, and we can possibly have it fixed to fit her better cheaper then buying a new item.  We will see after Christmas."
3.0,These fit fine but the material was cheap
3.0,"This top would be tight on someone who is US size16 and uncomfortable for a person size 18. SELLER NEEDS TO RE CALIBRATE SIZE EQUIVALENCIES!. I am a size 12-14 and this should be much looser on me based on the fit of the matching dress (which I also purchased). If you are US size 16 or larger, don't bother with this shirt!"
3.0,"There is no grip on the bottom of them, almost like a foam sole to the shoe"
3.0,This bag is fine and packable.  Material seems thin so far so good but worried about durability
3.0,The post of the earing was at the top of the earing which makes them hang
3.0,"Super cute , but way too small, definitely not US size"
3.0,"Exactly what i ordered, just like the picture, but smelled like dead animal.  Just something to consider... maybe artificial would've been better..."
3.0,Reminds me of the old days
3.0,"These pajamas fits as expected and are very comfortable. I just wish that they would list the fabric density in the advertisements so that you know how heavy the fabric is. Flannel can be anywhere from very light (like these pj's) to heavy. These are ok, but they are made of a light flannel. I would like to find some made of heavier flannel. LL Bean has that type of flannel, just not in the patterns or colors that I like."
3.0,They fit really true to size and are very distressed!  The only thing I didn’t like was the threads left at the knee.  Too easy to catch on things.
3.0,"Rise is very short, especially for someone with an athletic build.  Well made and I like the outer draw string."
3.0,Can t remember
3.0,"Well constructed, but far too small.  Even if I leave my long hair outside the hat (what's the point?) it is still too small to wear comfortably all day.  Gave it away to a child."
3.0,"The printed Nike logo is very hard to read; even harder when hat is stretched over a head so the writing looks...messy is the best way to describe it. The reverse side with not writing and the embroidered ""just do it"" is much better. Nephew will probably only wear that one side."
3.0,"This dress is nice because you can use it unbuttoned over an outfit, or wear as a dress. Kinda of see through but not too bad. Had great flow!"
3.0,Its a great shirt. I have broad shoulders and unfortunately the pattern of this looks awful with my shoulders. Wish it fit. Dealing with the seller was easy and great though. They were very easy to work with and offered me a free shirt so I wouldn't have to send this one back.
3.0,It is a beautiful dress..only reason for me to give a 3 star is coz it is loose for me at my waist...I bought a small..it was supposed to fit better...I have to probably tailor it...I don't like my clothes having a loose fit..use a sticky bra with it..
3.0,"The torso is very short, and I don't even have a long torso. If you have big boobs, order a size up, that may help."
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, 140lbs, 32DD.  I bought the extra large and it was a good fit.  It is not long, and somewhat sheer, you have to wear a layer underneath. But it cute and I usually get compliments."
3.0,They need better grip. They are soft and warm so I still used them.
3.0,"Fit & color are really nice. I absolutely LOVE the artwork and the story of the designer. The two stars are for the really poor tshirt material. We're pilots, so we spend money on stuff we don't need. Start putting these out in nice American Apparel cotton jersey material and you'll lock us in for life!"
3.0,"I start this review with the caveat that I get hot easily and need a hat that really breathes. Also, I only tried it on a vacation to Mexico, so it was worn in 90+ degree weather with humidity only a tropical beach and jungle can provide. I usually stuck with a second straw hat I'd hoped would be a backup.<br /><br />This hat fit well and held its shape, but it was a bit too stiff; the weave was so tight it didn't breathe much at all, and the little vent holes on the side just weren't up to the task. Maybe if you were just using it for sun protection on a 70-degree day, it would work. Unfortunately, its lack of flexibility meant it didn't survive the return trip to the States - luggage handling being what it is today - and I couldn't test that theory. A quick word on aesthetics: up close, the treatment on the straw made for a glossy, almost plastic finish, which made it look cheaper than it is, in my opinion."
3.0,I ordered this thinking it would be very big for winter layering. I'm returning it because it runs small. Very nice item and I really like it but it just runs small.
3.0,"I like the glasses, but the case and the glasses smell like cigarette smoke house. When I wear them I can smell it and it’s not pleasant."
3.0,I read all the comments and decided it must fit pretty much as expected so I ordered a Medium. Wrong! Whoever said they got a size small and weighed around 140 pounds is wearing her clothes too tight. I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 135 pounds and usually wear a size 8-10 dress. This dress was so tight across the bustline I could see both nipples. Also any bit of weight showed through at the armpits. I was very disappointed in the dress. I'm afraid to order a large because I don't think even that would be large enough on top.
3.0,"its not that bad, but its more pretty on the picture...."
3.0,The dress fits relatively well but is not as long as shown on the model in the pictures.  Her knees are totally covered but it was a good two inches aboves my knees.<br /><br />My husband loves the dress on me but it is not as long as shown.  I'm returning it.
3.0,Very nice although they are a little bigger than I expected.
3.0,"When it came in it looked larger than an X-Large but after washing and drying it , well it shrunk badly .."
3.0,Looked just like the photo. Problem was it was too tight and too short. My boobs were hanging out when I raised my arms. Had to give to my roomie to see if she could wear it. Sad
3.0,I am a little disappointed because the straps broke with a little weight in there. The straps are held on by little button like grommets. Rather than sewn in. I would have went for a style with the handles are sewn into the bag. It would be more sturdier.
3.0,Over sized / Nice shirts though I gave it to my dad fits him good XL I like a true XXL  POLO NEEDS TO improve the dry fit line of polos they are way behind
3.0,The pads aren’t keeping their shape. Can’t wear this under another top because the fit isn’t smooth anymore.
3.0,Product is cute but you should buy like 2 sizes larger maybe as they got their size chart all wrong. And also not much support for big chested women!!! The padding didn't even cover my breasts fully. But i love the design.
3.0,"Thin material but its cute. She's just a beginner, It'll do for now. Until me and my daughter begin really shopping for her undergarments."
3.0,"The color is a beautiful navy blue-super soft. I wished it had pockets and a closure.  That is on me-I did not look closely at the blue coat. Some of the pictures display coats with buttons. I may add my own closure and keep the item. sleeves are 2 inches too long-I may use the extra to make pockets. Great packaging, prompt delivery."
3.0,"I was hoping this product would be softer and look a little more quality and luxurious. It took a few washes and drys to soften it up. Color was nice and length was good right below the knees ( 5' 4"")."
3.0,"VERY, very expensive for such a small thing! Oh! I forgot, you are paying so mush for that little tiny label that says Kate Spade!!!!<br />It's really so small that even dollars bills folded in half must be crammed in."
3.0,This run really narrow
3.0,"Ok for most users but must remove them each time to recharge bugs is problematic.  Sooner than later,  they will break."
3.0,"The top looks great I just wish they had the bottoms fixed on the string. It is a bathing suit made to slide into a thong or brazilian but, usually slides to a thong. Once it slides to a thong in the back, it gets waaay too small in the front. I'm going to tack it with some thread to hold it in place on the string which in sure I will get more wear out of that way. Otherwise it would be great just for tanning. At least the top can be matched with other pieces... I would not buy again If I knew it was a convertible."
3.0,Product is beautiful
3.0,"The top itself is super cute but it does run pretty large, even after washing it. HOWEVER, after a few washes, its already getting holes at the seams which is sad. Thankfully its cheap enough to just replace it."
3.0,Too loose fitting for my taste.
3.0,I wish this had a bit more stretch... it's a really cute set but ran small. :(
3.0,They fit well but still slide off.
3.0,Band sewn on the bottom of the shirt that doesn’t show in most photos and not in description. It causes the bottom of the shirt to pucker instead of laying flat on your hips. Also runs short.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, but this definitely ran big. Also, if you are on the shorter side, I wouldn’t order unless you plan on wearing head"
3.0,Very disappointed in size
3.0,"Nice dress, not wrinkled at all out of the bag and material feels nice.  Neck is a little tight when buttoned but overall a cute dress.  Ordered this dress in yellow and received a blue/orange version"
3.0,The shirts look great but the large printed area make them very stiff
3.0,I was looking for some light pink cute leggings for the gym but these are neon pink and so pretty but not what i ordered.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, only it fits too tight"
3.0,Don’t care for how high the neckline fits
3.0,"Nice belt,<br />The ratchet is not that good quality"
3.0,"For the price, it isn't a bad watch.  I bought it for the stopwatch function which works just fine.  However, the wrist band is anemic.  I don't have large wrists and the wrist band is on the last loop.  If my wrist were any bigger, it wouldn't fit at all."
3.0,Material feels great. They would fit perfectly if the back came up enough to cover your crack. The butt area is “short” if that makes sense.
3.0,"Super cute and a bang for your buck. After a few wears the material doesn't stay flat, it rolls."
3.0,Wore it once. Might not again. It's a little big on me.
3.0,"It's a pretty shirt and it seems true to size, but on me, it makes me look bigger than I actually am because of how it lays across the stomach and hips. With the material it's made out of it has no give so keep that in mind while ordering, it's also see through so you have to make sure and wear something under it which adds mores bulk. Its beautiful and on the right body type I'm sure it would look great unfortunately I'm just not that type :("
3.0,"Os beautiful, but too small"
3.0,Can tell will only last couple months but was cheap.  Ok for cheap glasses
3.0,Some of these are pretty cute but a lot of them look very fake and dingy. When wearing these it’s pretty obvious that they are fake but they are still pretty cute.
3.0,The color I like but where are the cases?
3.0,"I would like the socks to be more of a durable cotton with better thickness for comfort in long wear days. They wash and dry as expected but not sure how many wears they will get.  The socks are going to be over the knee for shorter people, I'm 5'8"" and these were on my knee in an uncomfortable way, so if you're leggy this will be a great fit however the calf fit isn't for anyone other than average sized calves."
3.0,"product looks ok, and feels ok.. Obviously not as the more expensive brands but for what I need its would be fine except the sizes are not USA. More like Asia. I gave the first purchase to my daughter and will try 1 more time with larger size.. Hopefully they ok.. I don't need loosely fitting but also not spandex tight either.."
3.0,I purchased these as a gift for a family member. The color was far less than impressive.
3.0,"Overall the product is okay, hence the 3 star rating. It came quick, in perfect condition and as per all the other reviews I sized up two sizes and it fit fine. The reason I'm giving it a 3 rating is because the quality is pretty cheap. I can see some of the stitching and over all the legging are pretty thin. They are still a good pair or D.va leggings though so if your strapped for cash and can't get the official Blizzard ones (which I would recommend you get over any other pairs you see online because they are the official and original once) then these are a good substitute. I can see hem lasting a few wears and then maybe not lasting very long. I'm actually going to return my pair and just get the ones from blizzard. If you have read any other reviews you will know to size up one or two sizes when getting this pair."
3.0,"If you want a comfy t-shirt, totally get it. But the print on the front looks terrible. Its too pixelated and distorted. but its a great pj shirt now. very soft and comfy. the picture just looks like crap."
3.0,"It looks great on a black Samsonite Omni 28&#34; and seems to be well made.  The clips are robust and it tightens up well.  I have five concerns: (1) It is fiddly to attach, while not a problem during packing it leaves me wondering if TSA or similar would take the time needed to reattach it correctly.  I just don't see this happening.  (2) Making it tight compresses the zippers on the case which stresses the zippers, but I'm not sure if this is a real problem when compared to the problem of the case zippers being stressed during normal use.  (3) There is a strong chemical smell, which will dissipate over time. (4) It is short to use with the expansion zipper on this case as it just fits an Omni 28&#34;. (5) As another reviewer observed a simply cinching system would better much for tightening the belt.<br /><br />Pros: looks great, case will stay closed, strong.<br />Cons: Fiddly, compresses zips, chemical smell, could be a a little longer."
3.0,"These are perfectly comfortable. I wear a 5 or 6 and the small fit fine although they seem a bit wrinkly (definitely NOT ""sexy"" despite what the marketing copy would have you believe). The fabric seems a bit thin but has held up through a few washings. I wouldn't seek them out again but they're ok and the price is good."
3.0,These tips got in the way more than they helped. But they look cool and scary. lol!
3.0,Based on the measurements the XL would have been tight across the chest and the XXL fits well despite it being a little loose in the chest but the waist is baggy. Maybe this dress will look better with a belt.
3.0,"I am 5""1, 210 lbs, typically wear a 14/16 in jeans, 36dd. Ordered an XL. I would have included a picture of me wearing the romper but it was entirely too revealing for Amazon. I was able to zip up the romper to my waste and had to call it quits. Aside from sizing, the main issue is that the torso on the romper is too short(which is very surprising because I do not have a long torso in the least). Even if I were able to zip the romper up all the way, the bottom of the shorts barely covered my butt, and didn't flow well. The top of the romper didn't fit terribly,  but I think my boobs would have been very squished. Unfortunately I think because of the torso length, even if I were able to size up it would not be flattering."
3.0,"Looks very nice, just like the pictures...except....<br /><br />The only way to get it to look as &#34;luminous&#34; as the dark picture, is to shine a bright light on it immediately before putting it in the dark. Then, the luminosity is quickly lost. In addition, it is NOT a moon phase watch as the description says. Should have caught that from the pics, but didn't. What they call a &#34;moon phase&#34; dial is actually a day/night dial (sun during the day/stars during the night). It looks nice...but the &#34;moon phase&#34; description is innacurate.<br /><br />Still like it...but if you want &#34;luminosity&#34; and &#34;moon phase&#34;...look elsewhere."
3.0,This bangle is smaller than what I thought it would be. I wanted something sort of heavier and bigger. Pay attention to the ruler measuring the bracelet. It matters.
3.0,"I bought these thinking they would be great, loose fitting dresses.  However, as soon as I pulled them out of the bag, my kids were laughing, my husband was giving that look (one of trying not to say anything bad about his wife and her clothes), and my own 1st impression was that it was a MuuMuu, before I even tried it on.  Putting it on still made me feel I was wearing a MuuMuu."
3.0,"They are alright.... The pattern clearly shows through the side you are looking through - which some of the higher quality glasses don't have. They are good cheap glasses, Nothing bad or great about them"
3.0,The black one did not have a bra in it as the other ones did
3.0,"Case feels bulky and is not pleasant to hold, due to the hard plastic ridges.  The stand broke within a couple of weeks."
3.0,"Jacket as pictured. Soft , pleasant material. Very nice silver grey. Not shiny. True to size except bust area. Medium was too tight for 38"" bust."
3.0,"It could be cute, but aside from the cheap material which I know is going to feel immediately sticky and gross in any kind of heat, the shoulders are cut too wide and it runs big. May have to return this one."
3.0,"It's very cool looking, but a bit cheesy construction.  It was made and shipped from China, so that's why it took over a month to arrive."
3.0,"This is a great cami for layering.  There were a few straps that were sewed on incorrectly, but no one knows but me."
3.0,These are good but the ride up. Apparantly there are shorts that are longer that I wasn't aware of. I bought another pair from the store. these were ok but didn't expect them to ride up.
3.0,"Bought it for a friend for Christmas, the charm was nice but the necklace looked very cheap. The clasp on it is huge! It's something a teenage girl might like but not a 40 year woman. I took the paper out with the original prayer and replaced it with a personal prayer. It took me over 8 tries to print and cut to size that thing. Cut your cord for a cell charger to about a 1/4 of an inch and that's how much space your working with inside."
3.0,Wish it were a little larger -- a full size might be too much.  the measurements were not accurate.
3.0,"I've been working out more and running and use new athletic clothing to motivate me and keep me excited. I was eager to wear my new pants that arrived but they were a little too small to wear with a tight fit. As I lose more leg fat, I expect these will fit snugly soon. Fingers crossed."
3.0,"They are a little shorter than I expected, but they do the trick."
3.0,"The reason I gave them a 3 is because they were so cute, the description say they are for teen boys but they are in fact for toddlers I had to send them back."
3.0,"Little too large, ended up returning. Might work for others though."
3.0,Seems a lot larger on-line.  Hard to see detail of stones.
3.0,Dissatisfied. Color was nowhere red. Had ordered for a gift but stone is not what I wanted. I kept it for myself as it fits me.
3.0,They are soft and my daughter says they are very comfortable. Would have given 5 stars but unfortunately one arrived with a huge hole on the side.
3.0,Love the style but the color of the blue is off. One is darker and the other is lighter as you can see from the picture. Took it out to see if it makes a difference on the stone but still is still one dark and one lighter.  Will be returning to get a refund.
3.0,"They are good and they stay. They are cotton but do the job at keeping warm during the cool fall nights, not sure about winter unless you wear them under pants.<br />If you have bigger thighs than normal this won't probably fit, i have skinny thighs and they are tight.<br />They don't stretch much on that area."
3.0,"Really cute but clingy, does not hide a belly well"
3.0,"I guess you thought everyone had 1"" nails?  There is way to much room in fingertips."
3.0,The color is very different than as it appears on the website.  Also the style  and the make are not as nice as other Stella McCartney's sports tops that I bought from Luisaviaroma site. Not sure if the makers are different
3.0,Made nice but runs to small can't wear it😔
3.0,"Print was pretty, but the bottoms were rather see thru 😩  maybe get a print with black bottoms"
3.0,Very cute umbrella but not as small as i thought.. wouldn’t recommend for traveling
3.0,Haven’t used yet. It’s an ok rain suit but if you want something to work in check into a more heavy duty one.
3.0,You cannot sweat or the chain will lose it's gold finish.
3.0,Very attractive illusion neckline
3.0,"When putting them on, they are way too big and far apart. I think I'll get a real septum instead."
3.0,Bad quality and the wrong color. Returning
3.0,The outfit is just as cute as the picture but there is no way this is a newborn unless you have the worlds biggest baby. I was going to use this as her coming home outfit but now it will just have to be a cute outfit she wears around 6 months
3.0,These sunglasses look cool but I could not wear them as the unadjustable nose piece is positioned so high that the glasses sit uncomfortably high on my nose.
3.0,"Cute top, but wish that I would have bought one size larger."
3.0,Not true to size too small around waist.
3.0,Dress tie dyed but had a obvious black dye stain in upper front of it.
3.0,"I like this for the price they paid, but the cut is a little awkward.  I was confused on how to arrange it after putting it on. I looked at a picture and I still feel like it sits a little funny.  It does not equally cover both sides of your body. It sets more to one side.  I wish there was just a little more length to it. The hanging in the neck is strange.  It does not lay completely flat, but there is not enough loose fabric to make it hang naturally.  That open design on the edging is sort of stamped out of the fabric.  It’s  more like a rectangular  poncho rather than a square poncho. I just feel like it lays funny. The fringe at the bottom does not go around the entire garment.  But again, I will keep it and wear it for the amount I paid. It was reasonable.  The fabric isn’t super thin. So that’s nice.  All in all I’m satisfied."
3.0,"As pictured, but slightly loose. It also has a very loud unpleasant odor."
3.0,"I read a lot of reviews before buying these and I felt I might have been deceived. The socks DO slip off during the day, and they are somewhat small, I have one large toe so it’s a little uncomfortable but I mostly can deal with it. So far I’ve worn two pairs and already one of them is torn straight out of the package. They are pretty but they are not completely “no show” although it is minimal"
3.0,I bought the dress for an outdoor summer wedding.  The fit wasn’t flattering and I returned the dress.
3.0,Ordered for my athletic 13yr old. She is not into string bikinis. I was disappointed that the bottoms didn't look as the ones in the picture 😔 they seemed to look like running athletic shorts but are actually swimsuit material.  Thankfully my daughter really just wanted the top.....
3.0,The glasses are small in size
3.0,It arrived with gold specks all over the front. I was able to remove them via washing; however was disturbed that it appeared dirty upon arrival.
3.0,"I read other reviews that said it works for women of my height. But at 5'2, my hubby didn't like how it looked as a dress. So I kept it for pajamas.<br /><br />It has pockets. And they are about 3 inches too low (again 5'2) for me to reach them comfortably."
3.0,"Love the shoe, dont like the prop 65 warning that came on them."
3.0,"The installation of the band was really easy. It took me less than 5 minutes to remove my original band and put on this new band. I bought the rose gold and it match my watch perfectly. However, putting in on and taking it off is a bit of a challenge. I struggled for almost 5 minutes before I can hook up both ends and another few minutes before eventually closing the ends together.  It is beautiful but it might take too much time in the morning to put it on when I need to rush out of the door going to work.  That's the only reason why I rated it 3 stars."
3.0,These Women’s Active Yoga Lounge Capri Pants are made of really thin material ~ and they sit so low on your waist they look bunched up around my pelvic area.  I just don't like the way they fit.  Maybe if I was rail thin they'd lay nicer.
3.0,Mine started ripping with me only having it for most a month . Nothing heavy used in the bag or over stuffed . Really disappointed
3.0,"Great material and very soft but if you are heavy, they don't stay up. They keep sliding down. Not good for Pilates. The top needs to be a more snug."
3.0,"the necklace weave too tight,so the necklace become very stiff,out off my  expectation"
3.0,Nice bracelets real leather. However i have a 8.5 wrist and I can barely get it on.
3.0,"It fit well around my hips but since my waist is quite tiny, it left a gap. Nothing some quick stitching couldn't fix.<br /><br />My other issue was the crotch. I do a lot of aerial hoop and trapeze training and whenever I do a split or squats unfortunately my underwear is in danger of being revealed. They should have used a crotch gusset to provide a touch more coverage and versitility.<br /><br />Otherwise these are great shorts for jogging or lazy days at home doing yoga."
3.0,The material was too thin and almost see through. Returned.
3.0,"This is a nice watch, it was delivered about 3 days before the estimate date but I didn't get it until the day before (yesterday because my neighbor had it) and it came in a nice little black and red box with a pillow inside. This watch looks great it doesn't look like it should be in water. What I don't like is that it came with no instructions so I had no idea how to change the time and date since it was off. I fiddled around with it because I had changed a number somehow and now I think I got it somewhat. When it is on and the time or date is shown touch and hold the upper left side of the screen, then the number will begin blinking to change it touch the upper right side of the screen.  Supposedly you have to touch the screen gently for the numbers to come on but that is not the case for me. Anyway enjoy the watch I tested it and it is definitely not waterproof, it just looks too good to be in water, I found out the hard way after one day of use."
3.0,They run small we’re too tight. Weren’t as warm as I expected them to be
3.0,𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗉𝗍-𝖽𝗂𝖽𝗇'𝗍 𝗐𝗈𝗋𝗄
3.0,"Love design,but again it had a terrible odor!"
3.0,"I love the swimsuit except for the bra area. It did not fit well at all. If you have small breast the swimsuit fits true to size, but if you have a nice size breast the top area will not fit right."
3.0,"Not black, more of a steely grey. Also, the legs are too long and bunch a bit. I’m 5’7” so not a shorty. Seem pretty hearty but I’ve yet to wash them. Top is structurally sound but if you were wearing something slinky you’d see the seam where the legs attach. A little too low waisted to really help tame the tummy, but as pictured."
3.0,"I received this hat on time. It's very pretty, maybe not exactly the color that I was expecting,  mine seemed to have more yellow, oranges, and reds than what's represented in the picture, but I still like it. It's very warm, and the lining on the inside feels great!  Now for the bad, it's very hard to get this thing over my head completely to use as a gaiter, and I would say my head is average to small. It is also very akward looking as a hat, perhaps I am tucking it in incorrectly,  but it does not come with instructions or tips, and I have never owned a hat like this before."
3.0,"Unfortunately, these didn't fit any of the stones/crystals I needed them to; however, they seem to be strong and sturdy."
3.0,I should have read reviews. Super small. Picture advertised is definitely misleading. Not worth 17$
3.0,"The necklace was presented in a wonderful package that included a cloth for cleaning and a dust bag for storing. This would make anyone think they were opening an expensive piece of jewelry. I like the uniqueness of this necklace however, I was approached while at the grocery store and this lady thought my necklace had broke and was about to fall off my neck!! Lol!! The colored stones didn’t stand out as much as I was hoping they would and it’s hard to determine what shape they are because they are so small. I am skeptical on the length of time the luster of this necklace will last since it’s not Sterling Silver. I will definitely use the cloth provided in the package to wipe down the necklace after wearing to get the most use out of it. I think it’s a great gift for a child but I wouldn’t recommend gifting to your best friend, girlfriend, sister, Mother or wife."
3.0,"I’m not totally sure these will last a long time, but for the price they do the job"
3.0,Color makes it look cheap
3.0,Warm enough for some outdoor activities.  Too bulky for others.
3.0,"They are made for older kids, they are very large on my 5 year old. We have had them for about 6 months and used them 3 times and the screw on the side fell out. It is not a huge deal because we can get another one but it is annoying."
3.0,"The material is very thin, see through, & scratchy. Runs small! I returned It"
3.0,Fits fine other than the arm's are real tight.<br />I also dont like this material. It's picks up everything and its not a nice soft material.
3.0,"If you are looking for something to wear now and then, this is fine. If, however, you are intending to wear this everyday... Keep looking. I purchased the ring 16 months ago. It was lovely and I was thrilled. I wore it continuously. Over the first few months, I noticed the shine had greatly reduced. It began taking on a darker patina. A few months later and I noticed the finish had started flaking off, particularly on the band. The bottom of the band began to thin as well. Within the first 12 months, there was little to no finish left on the ring yet I continued to wear it in its dull form, its exterior becoming rough now. Today, just shy of being 16 months old, the base of the band cracked through completely.<br /><br />I bought and wore this ring as a constant reminder that I am a daughter of The King. My God is an awesome God. Even though the ring did not last long, that reminder remains."
3.0,"Nice bracelet but extremely small, would not fit my daughter."
3.0,It's okay. but is very narrow and hard to get things in and out. Straps don't stay up if over a jacket. I like the way it looks. Nice material
3.0,The band is nice (rainbow) but it's way smaller than the regular band & I made sure to get large & it's still a little small. The blaze doesn't snap into place as well on a normal band but it's not bad. Just wish it was bigger.
3.0,Pretty basic black tee.. Not that flattering but I can throw over peggyor skinny jeans so Ill keep. I ordered an extra large because I experience ordering online its best to go up a size since sizes are never really true to the chart..but Im sure if I got a large in this shirt it will still be a bit shapeless.
3.0,I usually wear large ordered an xl. Too small. Clings to my side
3.0,"I loved the color but the fabric not my favorite. I wish the fabric had more weight so it wouldn't look so boxy on me. I struggle with tops like this because I have large bust, I weight 150lbs and Im petite 5'3"" so it just makes me look more overweight (which is the case but some other styles like this one don't do this to me). Maybe if the fabric was a little more loose or heavier it could accentuate a better silhouette. Just my personal opinion."
3.0,"While the bag is inexpensive , you get what you pay for :&#34;Pure Plastic &#34; my mother being polite kept it since it was a gift , however I didn't get to see it until much later since it was sent directly to her address : personally I would rather pay more & send her a real leather bag . This one when I got to see it , I was embarrassed that I sent that as a gift !!"
3.0,"I ordered the 47mm lens width, but they are definitely the larger size.  Otherwise I would have been very happy with them."
3.0,Jacket was okay nothing extra about it.  I normally wear a size 10 or 10 and bought an Xlarge which turn out big. It is not lined an the material is almost like jersey. One I bought said dark blue but it was not it was more a royal blue.
3.0,love maiden but none of the t-shirts are true XXL and they don't offer XXXL .... be careful washing so as not to shrink it
3.0,Was excited end up order two sizes up based on reviews what I didn’t like was i have to wear it as a shirt since it wasn’t as long as it appeared on the model still happy with the dress I usually wear a 18 but order a 22
3.0,I wish it had been longer.  It's about 5 inches too short..
3.0,"Pro: This is a very convenient wallet for holding a passport, some cards, and some cash. Of course, you will be asked to remove the passport at passport control for inspection, but it was easy to get the passport in and out of the wallet. The wallet fit well in the front pocket of my jeans.<br /><br />Con: This product seems to have some quality issues. As others reported, the stitching holding the lining in the wallet gave out after only a few days of use. I got a refund, but several other reviews mention this problem."
3.0,Pretty but runs big & material is thin
3.0,Shipped from China VERY SLOW Not for a PETITE WRIST.
3.0,"The picture looked SO cute I just HAD to order! I wish I had not. The two bows on the TOP fell OFF in first wash prior to wear! The elastic in the waistband is twisted and is such that not only would it ve a little uncomfortable, but THIS woman can't &#34;fix&#34; it... & I usually would be able to!"
3.0,I would go up a size. I usually wear a small and should of got a medium. It's a little tight. Fabric is cotton so there is little give when wearing it. I am 5'1 and 123lbs if that's help someone else making a purchase.
3.0,"Loved the style. Fabric was not soft as I expected and was rough against my skin.  Sizing was a bit small and thumb holes were not comfortable.  Regretfully, returned item as it was very cut and great color."
3.0,"I wear a women's size 8 shoe, and the size Small in the Slim Fit was way too big in the foot, especially around the toes.  The XS is just barely small enough for me.  I wish they made the fit more snug to better fit under ski boots.  Also, the instruction manual is super brief and certainly didn't answer all my questions.  I wish the diagram pictures were bigger and more clear.  And I wish they gave some sort of instruction on using the phone app.  I also wish it was clear if it's possible to control them manually once you sync them with your phone app.  What if your fingers are too cold to pull your phone out?  Or your phone battery dies (as it almost always does while skiing in the cold)?  Or you forget your phone?  Also, I wish you could permanently disable the blinking light.  THe phone app allows you to temporarily turn it off, but as soon as you adjust the heat setting or do pretty much anything in the app, it turns back on again.  And lastly, the heat seems pretty weak to me."
3.0,Love the colors wish i wo u ld of got a size bigger
3.0,"Runs small. And dont even think about buying it if you are well endowed in the chest. It is not a relaxed fit and not vintage feeling at all. That being said, it is semi cute. The arm holes are cut like a traditional men's muscle shirt so bra exposure is highly likely."
3.0,I don’t like the material and it was too heavy for me
3.0,Dress is gorgeous but wasn’t the color I was expecting. Didn’t want the yellow in it but the shape and style of it is still very pretty.
3.0,Item is not in my opinion an XXL. It is very soft. Wish it only had the Sherpa inside. It you me looks like a woman’s item. Do recommend for softness and being warm.
3.0,It' s ok.  Too big<br /><br />The packing was horrible.
3.0,"Tailoring is a bit odd. Very loose in a few weird places. I ordered the small and it fits like a medium or large might. For reference, I'm 5'5&#34; curvy athletic 140lbs. I do love the open back and large arm holes. And the material isn't the type that will easily fade or wear out."
3.0,This product was just liked the picture. I wear this bracelet during my college school year. I wear this bracelet everyday in and outside my dorm room because it will show that i am allergic to my allergen.
3.0,"I agree you get what you pay for, but that is not always a bad thing.  I have been using this bag as my day to day work bag and take it as a carry on bag for ocassional business trips both domestic and international.  I agree that the bag is beautiful and has a quality appearance, but it does not hold up.  The leather tears easily and it is only surface so white fabric shows through any scraps and scratches.  The wheels have become wobbly and the handle takes a lot of effort to move up and down.  I now need to replace it, but in reality, I did not expect it to last a lifetime for its cost.  I should have just bit the bullet and spent the extra money for a more quality case.  That being said, I would recommend it to anyone on a budget with the stipulation to only expect it to last a year or two if used regularly."
3.0,Cute dress. Run small got a medium and a large. Only returning because it shows way too much cleavage
3.0,"Bought this for my husband, expected it to hold his squishy parts in but it only hugs them lmbo he wears it to work out in now if u work out in its great! But that's it"
3.0,Indi pink is grandma mauve. it's the color of all furniture my grandma had in 1980. Mauve or Dusty Rose as she'd call it. She also called her loveseat a divan and her couch a davenport. So that was not as expected. it looks coral pink on my monitor. I did like the how thin it was and think it would make for an ideal wallet on a lanyard. just don't wear mauve
3.0,"I have order this same dress in different colors and love them. This time this particular dress was literally balled in in the bag. It was completely wrinkled (not normally packaged type wrinkled). I felt like it was a returned item, thrown in the bag and sent to me. I can't tell you how upset I am, feeling as if I received a throw away. I sent it to the cleaners just in case. I will say, this is not the norm I have experienced with this company, but this was very unsettling to me."
3.0,It's nice but not what the picture shows. Doesn't lay correctly under the breast area.
3.0,"Con: even size Small was big for my 6.5 foot and they went over my knee. The heel was sticking out of my running shoe and I am about 5 feet tall. On the plus side, I did not have any problems with blisters in my half marathon when I wore these socks, the circulation in my legs felt great (no leg/calf fatigue), and I never had to pull them up once. Stayed put and did not budge at all throughout the run. If I could give them a 3.5 stars, I would. 1/2 for the cute color."
3.0,"I expected small, not so tiny you cannot read either one. Disappointing. Had to use a magnifying glass to read ""niece"""
3.0,It fits too tight for an XL.
3.0,"Got this for a kids costume. It’s a real tail, leather is tanned and rolled. So the authenticity is great. But because if this the color variation is way off. We got a grey tail and red ears. So not really what she was going for. But great price and quality. If the colors matched better it be 5 stars all day"
3.0,crotch to waist way too long. I would hace to be 10 foot for it to fit
3.0,The quality wasn’t fantastic of the logo I wanted on the hat. It looked like it was hand painted on. But OK for the price
3.0,I find this belt to resemble plastic or tire material versus leather. No way my husband wants to wear this. Not his look.
3.0,It ok  the fabric doesn't look the same
3.0,"Average quality, not good for heavy pants like snow pants. Would probably work good for boys pants."
3.0,Although they were pretty and would have worked perfectly with a choker I own the pictures lead me to believe it was lighter in hue.
3.0,"It’s cute, but caused a blister/zit after a couple hours of use. /: (p.s. don’t come at me for my oily skin and big pores, I already know)"
3.0,"bought to wear for a halloween costume, can you say STATIC CLING?  Wowza!"
3.0,Don't like handle
3.0,"Had to give it to someone smaller. Fits like a 12, I’m a size 14. Beautiful garment design and fabric choice. Unfortunately this skirt runs small, very disappointed!!"
3.0,"So far it hasn't dropped my camera but the plastic bends and flexes often if you put it on your hip and sit down in a car or something that you might normally do.  If you don't think you would do that just know that you do have to get this on your belt and I feel weird showing up to a job taking my belt off holding it on while I thread it between belt loops, etc.  If it's in front it covers your front pocket.  This is a great concept and poor execution.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. It works for me so far on my x100t (which is a SUPER small camera by the way)<br />2. The knob that goes in the bottom of your camera is well built and easy to tighten and so far doesn't unscrew itself.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. I would gladly pay more to see the materials a little stronger.  This plastic seems brittle.  I'd like a full metal option.  I want it to feel solid that's going to instill confidence in the product for me. When it comes to holding expensive equipment I'm looking for quality at a reasonable price I'm not that concerned with saving $10 or so. (-1.5 Stars)<br />2. There is a brilliant capture and release mechanism for your camera.  Why don't they have one to get it on your belt without having to take your belt off?  The peak design clip has a neat mechanism for this I wish the latch from this design and the versitility of te PD version were in one product. (-1/2 Star)<br /><br />Nice to have but I wouldn't call them cons (these didn't hurt the score I gave)<br />1. I wish there was a way to disable the latch for 1 handed operation<br />2. I wish there was a version that made sense to attach to a camera strap at your chest<br />3. Nice if the capture clip held the Allan wrench I lose those things easily.<br />4. I'm not crazy about things holding my camera ONLY from the 1/4&#34; threaded part because that can sometimes sneak its way and unscrew if you're not careful."
3.0,The quality of the product seems good but it was so small that I couldn't even fit it over my head. I bought a medium and I am a size four.
3.0,Ran VERY large....can sell...fits male only.  Things NOT a male ring.
3.0,The color of the tunic is not accurate as to the picture nor the description. It is certainly not ivory. It is more of a tan color or beige. Ivory is more or less an off-white color. It’s much darker than I thought it would be therefore it will not work for me.
3.0,"I ordered the size I usually get in flopflops and/or shoes, but these were too small and narrow for my feet.  They are stiff and uncomfortable, but I have to realize that they are intended only for shower or spa, definitely not to walk in.  They are a nice color of black.  They have a strong chemical odor, which I figure will dissipate after wearing.  I wanted to like these, but I am going to return them.  They are just not for me, but may be for others."
3.0,We got this for my sons lumberjack first bday party to wear for his smash cake. It seemed a little small but is very cute for a little guy!
3.0,The length of the laces were fine for my Nike hightops.  The thickness seemed a little shy of the original laces but they are ok.
3.0,These are beautiful.  The ear wire is small and larger than my ear hole.  The metal looks cheap and tarnished. I don’t wear them.  I plan on replacing the French wire.
3.0,Thought they would be more flattering as that is what the picture suggested
3.0,"Fine jewelry this is not, but it's pretty heavy for the price.  The eye is a bit bigger than I expected, and the chain is too long.  (I'm planning to replace the chain.)  It's quirky and cute, and I'll wear it with casual attire."
3.0,I love the color and they feel smooth.The only downsize is tha the top rolls.
3.0,I ordered because I liked the colors and I received today... I wanted them for my middle finger which is always a size 8 but they seem to run a little small.. I was bummed... Oh well I will order more and give the smaller ones to someone... They are nice!
3.0,Is cute but when I opened if was broken
3.0,"Sheer polyester is fine for bathing suit cover up, but can be hot and clingy.  I wish it was cotton.  Style is flowy and fits my medium figure fine.  It says one size fits all, but I think if you are a plus size, it won't be large enough.  Colors are pretty."
3.0,It’s color changed when wet
3.0,Cute watch band. It included a scratch off that revealed 1st prize. Tried to redeem but company refused to honor it.<br />Will be returning the product.
3.0,"Unfortunately, one side kept coming right off . I even tried holding it down for a while and moving it around.  Oddly only one side kept unsticking . Just didnt work our for me. But maybe its cause I have size D."
3.0,"Cons:<br />- My only complain and such a shame coz I really like the pants otherwise. It is not completely waterproof! There is a different fabric band in the middle and thats not waterproof. The rest of the pant is fine. If you can manage not having rain hit your shin, then you are good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Its a very good quality product!<br />- The main fabric(barring the middle band) is waterproof<br />- material is soft and doesn't make noise when walking.<br />- In a rib boat adventure, we were to stand and sit while speeding. They seat got water splashed, but these pants kept me dry.<br /><br />Fit is decent. It is straight down with no tapering. Since its just for ski/rain pants, it doesn't matter much.<br />On my Iceland trip, in rain, I got my inner layers soaked from lower thigh to socks."
3.0,"Material felt nice, didn't like it as much as I hoped I would. Good length. Sleeves were a little too baggy for me and the one side of the dress kept moving over and part of my bra would be showing."
3.0,I like the chain but the hasp is week and will fail long before the chain. This is a reasonable product for the price.
3.0,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to robes. I want something that's on the thinner side and breathes, yet is thcick enough to hide what's underneath. I want something that's flattering rather than frumpy, but again, that hides what's underneath. I haven't found that perfect balance yet. I love the softness and shape of Eberjey. I love how well Bedhead hides what's underneath. This particular robe was nice, but not what I was I looking for. It isn't super thin and it does breathe, but you still can see more through the fabric than I would like. This runs small. I ordered the L/XL expecting it to be a bit big as I typically wear an L for tops and dresses, but it just fit. I definitely feel frumpy wearing it. Then there was the modesty factor- there's nothing that really holds the front of the robe together. The sides easily come apart even with the strap tight around the front so you could see basically everything underneath the robe the longer I had it on. The actual quality of the robe seems like it's really good quality. I think it would wear well."
3.0,"Looks good on the model, but was very shapeless on me, and I am curvy so I was surprised"
3.0,Cool color. Fits very small. Squeezes it's self off of your head
3.0,"Love the colors and I love that I can wear my pony tail, but even at the biggest setting, the hat is snug."
3.0,Unfortunately I am bursting out of my normal size and can't wear this. But if that's not a concern for you then this is an excellent purchase overall
3.0,I bought a large size & it’s half a size too big
3.0,There nice just wish they were bigger
3.0,Fabric is pretty but thin and very wrinkly
3.0,"Didn't try on, huge crease on pant leg when arrived and don't want to waste time having to iron every time I want to wear"
3.0,The design was very pretty and the fabric soft. The problem was that it was very thin. If I had ordered in a darker color there wouldn’t have been an issue. In the white of the fabric you could see everything underneath. Bummer.
3.0,They help but not too confortable between your head and ears...
3.0,This was my favorite fitbit band until one of the screws fell out and now I can't use it. Not sure why it has screws instead of just solid backs on the silver buttons at the end of the center but it does and they don't stay in. I would wear this every day if I could find a new screw but no luck.
3.0,"Against the black face the almost BLACK minute hand makes it impossible to see what time it is.  The sweeping WHITE second hand means you will always think its the wrong time.  As a wrist decoration the watch is OK, as a timepiece its pretty useless. If I'd paid the retail price I'd be irritated."
3.0,Other than being too small they are ok
3.0,"My husband needed a longer cord for his glasses.  These were the perfect fit.  However, he had them less than two weeks and one of the straps broke.  It was the part that connects to the glasses.  I know that he has three more, but they should last longer."
3.0,"It's nice sweater but kinda scratchy , I have to wear something underneath because it irritates my shoulders where rubs"
3.0,Not very happy with this piece. Looks cheap and a few of the stones had come out of the setting. Not impressed.
3.0,The leather was super cheap looking and cracked easily.
3.0,Good  but a little  heavy .
3.0,I like the sweatpants but they do run 2 sizes smaller especially if you like them to be loose.
3.0,PRETTY but cheep quality
3.0,"the tie is a lot shorter in person once you tie it, but other than that it is okay, not my favorite, but I will wear it to work every now and then."
3.0,Fell apart 2 weeks after I started using it.
3.0,"They were sharp and honestly they hurt to put into my ears, so I used them for what I needed and haven’t worn them since."
3.0,"Cute, but feels somewhat small"
3.0,so so..
3.0,I like the slip underneath. Just too snug for me unfortunately.
3.0,Way to big at least 2 sizes  otherwise seem like good quality
3.0,"The zipper was plastic so it broke and I’m havjng someone put in a stronger one . The dress is pretty just alittle thin, a little stretch which is nice . I Order one size bigger."
3.0,"It is actually pretty but once put on you will have some side boob, as the bikini top does not offer complete coverage on the sides...bummer as its a cute suit"
3.0,"cute for the price,but starfish had stones missing."
3.0,I gave 3 stars because it is like a little to thick. Looks different in the picture. The bangle also kept moving so that the open part of it was on top. The design also looks different in the picture. Not my style
3.0,I like the look. The fabric is like an extra heavy lawn & leaf bag. It runs a little small.
3.0,"Bottoms were actually high waisted in me. I'm 5'7"" 130lbs, small fit great. Full coverage bottom.<br /><br />The color is a little infantile in person and I didn't don't it flattering. Someone else may, but just wasn't for me."
3.0,Small fit but cute shirt. Thanks for the easy return.
3.0,I received this shoe twice because the wrong shoe was sent. Both pairs that I received are nothing like the picture that was advertised. Overall I liked the shoe but I would have preferred the shoe design that was advertised. My daughter's Birthday is Saturday and I don't want her to not have any shoes at all. The shoe is narrow so if your child has a wider foot this would not be the shoe for them.
3.0,This material is not what I was expecting. It's almost like a thin sweater. Almost sheer but not quite. The color is also lighter than pictured. It was comfortable wearing in the summer so I'm keeping it. I bought an XL since I prefer loose clothing and it fit as expected.
3.0,The jersey is great quality for the price for sure but the seller shipped the wrong size as many reviews said they have. Sticker said one thing jersey said another.
3.0,The dress is so pretty but tight at the top and hard to zip. Removing it was hard also. I think it depends on your proportions. Very loose from the waist down so I won't try a medium. I didn't take a picture but wish I did. Anyone would look great in this dress if it fits.
3.0,Nice purse BUT IT STINKS like dirty shoe leather. And the zipper tabs pull off. We tried to fix one and the zipper piece broke off. I would not buy it again.
3.0,The watch is light enough. It does get caught on stuff but I can’t explain why- it makes my wrist hurt like the magnet is too strong or the metal type or something? I have several Milanese loop style bands and this is the only one that causes pain near the magnet. The watch band is not too tight either. No idea.
3.0,Not bright and colorful lick picturr
3.0,"I love the jacket, but I can only give it three stars because the material is horrible. Lana"
3.0,"I ordered several colors of these shirts.  I love the raglan sleeves and they are so soft!!  My only complaint, in the photo it shows the sleeves significantly longer than they are.  The length of the sleeve was actually one of the reasons I ordered these and not another shirt.  They don't even go to the top of my hand after one washing.  I'm not going to return the shirts, but unless that changes, probably won't order more of that brand."
3.0,Red and black band is really pink and black instead.
3.0,Looks ok but I expect something better.....
3.0,Runs small and it is too light for winter.Don't buy this if you live in a cold climate.I don't recommend this.
3.0,"I bought this and bought a small, however when I got it, it looked HUGE on me! I was shocked with how large it ran as usually a small will fit perfect on me or else snug."
3.0,"While taking this item off it rubbed across my wedding ring and pulled the material. I do not see this fragile material lasting longterm. Even the care instructions are tedious. As for fit, I am a size 12 with DD chest and the medium fits me everywhere except the chest. It is uncomfortably tight under the arms as it pulls across my chest."
3.0,A little too small for their use.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a98b92cf3a265b3db0cc7d2f0308128e]] First of all, the quality is great.<br />I had read reviews of other Tipsy Elves costume onesies and people said they ran small/tight. So I ordered a Women’s Large to give me some extra space... It’s huge! It honestly could fit a 6’5” man. Kicking myself for waiting so last minute for a costume, but it is what it is at this point."
3.0,Tail was a disappointment as it had to be pinned on and it did not stay on well....ears were great....
3.0,The arm length in the picture is not the same when you get the dress. The sleeves are short. That is what made me return the dress. The product should be the same as the picture.
3.0,Band was fine when I received it but it took a long time since it came from China!
3.0,I wear this as a workout shirt sometimes because its made of a weird athletic material and its cropped super short
3.0,For the price this is a very well made dress. Unfortunately the color is not pumpkin but mustard yellow. Will need to where a slip or body wear underneath as it is a bit see through.
3.0,"The earrings I got when I ordered these did not match the image.  They were silver, but the shape was entirely different.  The bottom is a drop, a blob, like molten silver ready to drop off a rod, very bottom-heavy -- NOT the slightly, gradually increasing drop shown in the image.  They're fine, just entirely not what I wanted, as I had already ordered the other shape from another vendor.  I wanted these because the join to the ear-wire was much more subtle, it looks like one continuous piece of silver.  Instead I got the visually obvious weld of a wide drop to a wire."
3.0,Not structured well/ thin material so it’s prone to cause wedgies
3.0,"They're super sturdy. My only complaint is that they're actually a size larger than what I ordered, which normally wouldn't be a big deal. But I decided to stop sizing up as I don't want to push it. It took a year to size up comfortably last time when it normally only takes me a few months. So I would order a size smaller for a perfect fit if I were you."
3.0,"Love them, but the zipper broke only 5 months after I bought them."
3.0,Sits on my head in peculiar way. Almost need to stuff the front with tissues or something to make it sit right. The purple is very vibrant. Almost to bright to match most of my other purples.
3.0,"Good size when out of box, but shrank in wash. Will not dry next time."
3.0,Cute but far too small. I have a normal size head and short (to jawline) curly hair and it smooshes my hair down terribly.
3.0,Not bad. Not good.
3.0,I'm giving this 3 ***. The dress was GORGEOUS!<br />IT RUNS SOOOO SMALL it should sized accordingly. Too bad. I loved it.
3.0,When I bought it the word “adidas” looks white on the picture but it came in a horrible green.. my son doesn’t want to wear it. Looks fake and uncool
3.0,"I purchased this for a friend for Christmas and accidentally purchased a second. Oh well. For the markdown, it's a deal. But the bracelet feels so cheap. Its light as a feather. It's shinny and pretty, but not all that. Set under my expectations."
3.0,"Picked this dress for my girls because of the vibrant, almost neon colors in the images. Disappointed in the washed out, muted colors we received. Fabric is soft and stretchy. 100% polyester."
3.0,Except one was ripped and torn in the package.  The other 2 were fine
3.0,Ruffles are overwhelming - very full and heavy.  Sweater material is super lightweight.  Not the best mix in materials.
3.0,"I thought this was cotton; it's a cheap spandexy type of material, like bathing a bathing suit would be made out of. It's a little bulky in the midsection but I should've ordered a size smaller, so that's my fault."
3.0,"The material that is used to make this hate is very nice. It’s breathable, soft and stretchy. I really like the black cam design on this particular cap. Unfortunately the sewing is far from acceptable.<br /><br />The billfold is sewn on off centered (crooked) making the hat look lopsided when worn. Otherwise  this would be a great hat. That’s my only complaint and the reason for the 3 star."
3.0,"Not rose gold,  just regular gold. It's much more comfortable but the corners of the magnetic clasp and the chain link band will snag on things at random. (See the string of blanket caught in my band? I left that on purpose).<br />If I'd known about the snagging I wouldn't have purchased it."
3.0,Most of them were dead before usage.  We were missing some rubber bands to hold the lights.<br />Good thing our party was on 15 kids.  So everyone had a light.<br />If your party is for 40 kids then get 2 packs or some of the kids would be unhappy.
3.0,"Shirt is incredibly comfortable.  My only real issue with these products is the length.  I ordered this in 2X; however, it was much shorter than I expected and while this may be the new trend since these are for working out it would be nice if the shirts had a little more length to them."
3.0,Outfit was okay shirt fits fine pants are on the small side. The headband was unwearable clearly made for an infant even though I ordered a 4t
3.0,Runs very small and too short
3.0,They're very cute and they arrived sooner than expected. After a couple times wearing them they began to fray though. I was able to do a quick fix. Okay for the price.
3.0,Purchased 2 gave one away.
3.0,Very practical and easy to wear. I got the largest size but it is a snug fit for my head. I'm not aware of having any head  abnormalities. I would recommend this hat for those who need good sun protection.
3.0,"Really liked these sunglasses, the matte black is just my style. After a couple months of normal daily wear the coating on the frames started to wear away and started to look like a car with peeling clear coat."
3.0,"This is such a cute jacket and the leather is buttery soft, but the sizing is crazy small. I ordered a 3X because I wanted to wear bulky sweaters under it (normally I wear a 1X). This jacket was so small across the shoulders that I couldn’t even get it on.<br /><br />So, if you decide to order, be aware that the size may be off.  Saw other reviews that said it fit well, so maybe it’s hit or miss.<br /><br />It really is a cute jacket, I’m really sad it didn’t fit."
3.0,"I like these shoes in general but I don't like the way they seem to give so quickly. After a few weeks the shoe starts to wrinkle around the ankles. The tongues constantly slips down in the shoe no matter how many times I retie them. But for the price, they'll do."
3.0,A bit too tight and material is ok a bit thin
3.0,"Not good for sensitive ears, I cannot wear for more than a night out without getting red and itchy."
3.0,Solid and heavier than expected started loosing stones from everyday wear in less than two weeks.
3.0,"comfy, but very baggy and unflattering."
3.0,This suit is not for shorter women. The torso is very long.
3.0,"Pros:cute, can dress up or down<br />Cons: the material is itchy making it uncomfortable<br /><br />I got the large and it fit like a glove so sad I can’t wear do to itchy material"
3.0,It’s pretty tough all around except for the clip mine broke the same day I got it so don’t buy it just because of the money clip
3.0,The ring came in time.<br />It's cute but cheap looking.
3.0,"It was an all right shirt. A lot different than it looks, I expected it to be very different. It's still cute. Definitely size up though."
3.0,"Not pleased with the fit. But, it is a pretty dress."
3.0,"I ended up cutting the neckline to make it plunge more (as it's pictured). Otherwise it was like a high-collared shirt, I couldn't even see my choker for it. The design is VERY white and crisp against the black, whereas in the picture it seems to be gray. Were it not for those two things, I'd have given it 5 stars."
3.0,Got this for my dairy piercing and it’s great it was just hard to get into my ear and turned greeen very fast
3.0,Its ok and honestly exactly what i ordered.  It just look very &#34;Hippy-ish&#34; in person
3.0,"Nice dress, but unlike other Vince Camuto dresses oy fits quite large."
3.0,Not as sturdy as I would have liked and are rather large
3.0,it's perfect a little shiny but cost was great.
3.0,"Very cute but too small and very thin material. Had to give them away, order a size bigger"
3.0,"Cute and nice fabric. Great value. Larger than expected, they still don’t fit my 6 month old but we will keep them and hopefully in a few months they will work."
3.0,"The style and fabric was perfect, but the fit wasn’t the same as the size chart suggested. Especially around the armpits upper ribs. My son wears a small and it fits him perfect, the problem is I ordered a large."
3.0,They won’t last long but they do the job.
3.0,Missing button and the large fit like a medium. Returning it
3.0,"cute dress, fabric feels scratchy and its pretty see through. Wouldn't wear it out in public"
3.0,Looks like in picture BUT they get super soft from the back part making it difficult to toddler put on. Not the best lasting material. Little cheap.
3.0,I don't care for them on me.
3.0,I have a long torso so it gave me a wedgie but seemed to feel better after a few mins lol. I'll keep it and see how it feels when I actually wear it
3.0,"Fit too small , but that was my mistake in ordering. But I was cute overall when I received it."
3.0,THE MAIN PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THE TOE IS OUT THAT THEY SLIDE UP FROM THE BOTTOM. THEY WON'T STAY DOWN UNDER YOUR FEET.
3.0,The quality of the material is decent.  I usually wear a large pant but ordered XL and they fit but they do ride down after sitting and with long wear times.
3.0,I wouldn't be too crazy on this sleep dress. It looks okay as a sleep dress
3.0,The pants continuously slide down.
3.0,my niece loved them but they really didn't hold up too well.  they're cute and fun but a little cheaply made
3.0,"I'm not too upset at the difference in color, however, if you do order black the ring will come as a charcoal dark gray. The ring is cute though, and adjustable! I can squeeze the cat head or tail to make a tighter fit on my finger. I'm sure you can take more time to widen the middle portion of the ring, too, for fitting purposes, however, I have not played around with the right that much yet."
3.0,"The earrings look fine, but there is only 1 sheet with 143 pairs of stick on earrings. False advertising. The sheet is also glued down to the cardboard so you can’t split the pairs apart which I was trying to do for a little girl’s birthday."
3.0,It was okay..
3.0,Super cute but started changing colors…
3.0,"No doubt these are real, but the service we received was not good! I paid for 2nd day air and on Dec. 12th but didn't receive these for my wife until after Christmas!  Dissappointed also with the setting.  Much too cheap for an expensive set of earrings."
3.0,Not as comfortable as the last pair I bought 2 yrs ago!
3.0,"These straps seems to be well made and sturdy. I'm very pleased with the design that keeps all of the extra strap material from dangling loose or needing to be trimmed. The webbing material has a very slight amount of stretch which seems perfect for being able to get everything nice and tight.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't use these. I have a 28"" suitcase and I measured to make sure these would fit before ordering. My measurement was 74"" with the suitcase completely empty so I figured the advertised 78"" would give me enough of a buffer. Imagine my confusion when the strap was too short when fully extended. I measured the strap and it is only 72"" long! I can't use these and need to return them. So in my case they are a huge disappointment.<br /><br />If you have a smaller suitcase you should be ok with these, but if you have a large suitcase keep looking."
3.0,"These sandals are way too narrow for my feet. I have wide-ish feet and my pinky-toe isn't even on the sandal!<br />Otherwise, they seem well-made and the draining footbed would be perfect for the shower at the gym."
3.0,"I got the small and I love velvet dresses. It feels and looks really nice and chic but the straps don’t fit well and makes the front of the dress uneven and poor fitting. Also it fits loosely so it doesn’t give that old Hollywood effect. It’s more like oversized velvet pajamas. I really really wanted to love this dress and even considered altering the straps to try and make it work in the front but no matter what I do, it wouldn’t sit right. Sadly I have to return it. It was a beautiful green color though."
3.0,"Did not like my computer glasses, they did not help.  I am at the computer 10 hours a day 5 days a week and I really need a good pair of computer glasses."
3.0,"I love the style and feel. Very silky. But it was WAY too small. I usually wear a medium in cardigans but sized up to a large. I could have easily sized up to an XL. This will be getting returned. It’s has too much spandex in it to fit comfortably, even if it runs too small."
3.0,"I got the pink color. The color, quality, and fit is great. However, I literally lol'd when I put it on and saw how ridiculous the asymmetrical cut looks like. It doesn't look stylish at all and more like a dog got ahold of it and wouldn't let go until it ripped a piece off."
3.0,i really liked them but one of the nose grips fell off the day i got them. don't know where it fell of at so i can't wear them anymore
3.0,I tried to apply fake nails to these fingers to do like a practice run of my acrylic designs and the nail wouldn't stick. Even when I tried super glue. The only reason I gave three stars was because the package came early and they were not damaged. Also it is good to use when practicing applying the acrylic. The acrylic came off easily so I was able to reuse to practice applying the acrylic.
3.0,"The vinyl started coming off two days after wearing them. Admittedly, my shoe loving son is tough on shoes, but i've never seen him destroy shoes quite so fast. They were in the trash in two weeks. I was disappointed... but he did say they were comfortable!"
3.0,WAS NOT AS LONG AS I EXPECTED BUT GOOD
3.0,"The shirt is true to size, however, the shirt looks faded, like I have owned it for several years. It's new, I think, because it still has the tags on. I was expecting a brighter, newer look."
3.0,"Bathing suit was very cute, nice material but way too small. I usually wear a large or sometimes even medium but I ordered an XL bc of reading the reviews and it was still too small. I'm 5&#34;3 and 147 lbs. so my advice is when ordering go two sizes up from your normal!:)"
3.0,A bit to much like a balloon. Made be look larger but is cute material.
3.0,"I like this product. Beautiful color, but it's not silk, even not feel like silk. It's 100% polyester.But good for cheep price .S&H is good."
3.0,Cute coat but the sizes ran small. Had to return it. Had no problem getting a full refund.
3.0,"I'm 5'10 140 lbs so I'm a relatively skinny guy but these jeans felt too tight on me in the thigh and calf area. This is just a nitpick but I found out that if you stick your hand in your left pocket you can actually see the pocket moving through the ripped part of the jeans on the left side and it some cases it'll poke out. Not a big deal but for those who put their hands in pockets a lot, I can see it getting annoying at times. If you like really tight skinny jeans, then these are the jeans for you but if you like breathable skinny jeans with some room then I would look elsewhere."
3.0,Slightly smaller but still works
3.0,Very good quality purse just don’t expect to carry more than you basic necessities. Got it for my fiancé and she can’t fit her full sized wallet in it so plan on a new wallet and less items. All in all she gets a lot of compliments on it.
3.0,A lot larger and clunkier that in picture
3.0,Poorly made.<br />Not very thick material.<br />Kind of cheap
3.0,The stones are good but the hole in the casing is very small and will not take a chain larger than 1mm.
3.0,"Cute suit in cute striped colors as describes.  However, it was huge.  I am 5'7&#34;, 125 lbs, 34C bra.  Ordered a medium and it touched me only on shoulders and at crotch.  The leg holes were huge, almost as tho they lacked elastic.  Just didn't fit so I returned it."
3.0,"i was expecting a floor length robe.....im 5'10"" barefoot.....length is 5 inches short.....picture in amazon is slightly deceptive......"
3.0,"It's beautiful and shines nicely only complaint it the ear cuff constantly falls off so my earring is always handing. Other then always fixing it, i like it, guess I have to squeeze it extra tight around my ear"
3.0,"Fiance thought it was too small, so she gave it to a friend"
3.0,"Good material, however very short torso. More of a thong fit for me as well."
3.0,"Fits my IPhone6s perfect.  The rose gold coloring around the edges has already started to chip off though.  For the price, it is a good case.  The holes for all of the charging/headphones area are a perfect fit.  Love the design!"
3.0,Pretty but was alot thicker than I expected.
3.0,Ordering clothes on-line is rarely a safe bet; all the more true for the XL and Plus sizes.  The garment and company are both high quality.  The sweater is undersized.
3.0,"Pattern is printed plaid and obvious it is, it is also slightly shorter than I wanted."
3.0,"Nice cut and super cute style, fit was as expected, the fabric is a little too thin for me though and there were some strings hanging off the dress when I got it."
3.0,I had an issue with the backbone of the waist trimmer and they contacted me right away to send me a full refund! I still use the product and it gets the job done. great customer service!
3.0,"I love it, but moon is misspelled. It says “love you to the moom and back”"
3.0,Very little.
3.0,"Since some recent eye surgeries I have been trying different progressive multifocal eyeglasses.<br /><br />Most of them do improve my eyesight, but this one did not help that much. I found only a slight difference for reading. And I never experienced the three different strengths.<br /><br />In addition, these glasses are not terribly attractive. Turned out to be too large for my face.<br /><br />Disappointing."
3.0,"These run small.  I ordered a 3T for my granddaughter who wears a 2T. These were long enough, but too tight.  I have since ordered her a 4T and they fit a bit long and much less tight.  My granddaughter is not overweight, so I think these just fit snug."
3.0,These are great single wear necklaces. They fall apart pretty easily
3.0,"Nice mask, decent quality, fits the ears weird (only reason leaving less stars)"
3.0,Color is slightly different and so is the fit.
3.0,these junks are hard af to put in
3.0,First pair of baseball pa ya we have every owned that ripped. Within 3 games.
3.0,"Got them for my kids who were wearing holes in their toes from the pool we use. They nearly wore through the first 2 hours with my 4 year old. Switched feet the next pool trip and they weren't too bad. I put &#34;new skin&#34; on them, so we'll see if that helps and how many pool trips before they're gone. 8yr old's pair show no issue after one trip, but he mostly swims."
3.0,"Some reviews mentioned that the dress is longer in the front and I found that to be accurate, although because I have 38D chest, that balances out the miscut.<br />I am 5'1"", the dress comes just above my knees. And the straps adjusted to the shortest length, still allows the dress to come down and show my bra. I wear with a cardigan, to help, but constantly, I have to adjust the top to cover the top of my bra.<br />I am going to sew the straps shorter to fix that and then the dress will be perfect.<br />Other than that this dress is going to be nice and airy for hot weather in the summer."
3.0,"Dress is not as cute as the picture. The picture looks as though the material is a linen, but its a its a soft stretch. There appears to be a button in the picture but really its a small stitch. For the price Ill likely use it for a swimsuit cover up, but really not in love with it but its not terrible either. For the price, its more of a hassle to return than just wear it. Color is true to picture."
3.0,A little too gaudy and sparkly for my taste but the necklace seems to be well made. I only wore once.
3.0,Order half size down. Quality is 5 out of 10
3.0,Nice robe but huge. I got med/lg. I’m 5’4 and 150. I have very broad shoulders. The sleeve seam came between shoulder and elbow. Need a small.
3.0,"see through - definitely cannot wear without a under garment dress slip, also fit a bit tighter then expected from the image"
3.0,Dropped from 3ft and cracked in half
3.0,"Bought these in 3 different colors and they shipped quickly, the size is a bit long.  I bought these to use while I go through chemo.  The colors were as pictured but my only problem was that the material was a lot thinner than I had wanted and they had a weird smell to them when I took them out of the packaging. Other than that I would’ve gave it 4 stars."
3.0,"My son loves the look of the watch, but figuring out how to set the time and alarms was not easy. Did not come with clear instructions."
3.0,"Thin material, not the greatest quality but it was a gift for my son who's a big MacBeth fan.<br />I would probably only buy another if it were on sale."
3.0,"These are somewhat stiff and don't lie flat against the boot, especially near the buckle.  They aren't three separate belts that you can wear independently of each other--you have to use at least two of them the ones that make the buckle), and can use the other one with the two that buckle or just those two, so there isn't as much choice as you might think.  They may soften up and get more flexible with use.  I like the look and hope they will become more flexible."
3.0,The Braclet came very nicely packaged! I wear it every day to support my son in the airforce. It has been about 2weeks abd the clear coat on the glass beads is wearing off. Other than that I love it.
3.0,It good but not great.
3.0,"I ended up keeping this as I needed a statement necklace in blue tones, but it's really not my usual taste.  Guess it's a little over the top for me, and I was looking for something smaller and lighter weight."
3.0,"It’s a bit big, for a child’s size. But a decent mask, regardless."
3.0,gave away little cheap looking
3.0,"Child likes them, but they keep slipping off her little feet."
3.0,"Good look, but not very comfortable. I own other Dr. Martens of similar style but in regular boot height and they are much more comfortable to wear. It might just be me, but the tops of these boots push on the back of my ankle/leg and irritate me. Again they look great and are perfectly fine in every other way, just not as comfortable as I would have hoped."
3.0,"Very soft.  Stains tend to stay after washes but whatever, my niece loves it.  Fast shipping has always. Was bought for a 5 year old."
3.0,Super cute... just too small on me. I will reorder in a larger size.
3.0,It is really too big for my glasses.
3.0,"I should have realized that if they stressed 'metal chain' that the watch itself probably wasn't metal. It's plastic.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting it to be a high quality item, but it is plastic and oversized for a pocket watch which made it really unusable as a costume prop.<br /><br />But, as a toy, it is exactly what you would expect!"
3.0,This dress fits well but is much too long for a normal sized person.  It is meant for someone around 5'11&#34; or taller.  I am 5'5&#34; and it is at least 6&#34; too long so will have to get it shortened before I can wear it.  Other than that it is very nice and I do like it.  Just can't wear it right now.
3.0,Great looking jacket but runs small.
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, but it's clear that it was cheaply made.  Also, I ordered up in size, thinking that it was going to be tiny and I ended up with a shirt that is too baggy.  I would have been better off choosing my true US size.  Choose a size at your own risk."
3.0,"I'm 5' tall and 135 lbs.  I'm 26 inch waist and 40 inch hips.  The fit was perfect except the leggings were too long - again, I'm only 5' tall.  They look great - but these are NOT SQUAT FRIENDLY LEGGINGS.  There is very little stretch.  I literally heard the stitching pop while I was simply stretching.  These are leggings you wear on upper body day or as an outfit."
3.0,These are NOT cute scrunch bottoms. I will not be wearing. Looks like I have a diaper full.. poor design. Not cute. Top is as pictured
3.0,The reason for the three stars is because the package could not be tracked and also took the package over a month to get to me.  Was thinking that the package had got lost.<br /><br />It does fit correctly and each to put on and take off.  Just wish it would have gotten here a lot faster than what it did.
3.0,"First glance, this necklace is a 5 out of 5. Goes well with most of my wardrobe!<br />However.. I can't recommend purchasing it in any other color besides the natural metal, which is stainless steel ergo silver.<br />I bought it in black and realized right away why the charm and chain were packed separately.<br />Naturally, the chain and charm wear each other down. If your necklace is silver (stainless steel), this isn't a problem unless you can't stand scratches on the charm. With the black version- just two days of wear and the chain is chipping/scratching away at the black coating around the stainless steel. Perhaps it's not coating, but nonetheless, the charm is no longer homogeneously black.<br />I really like the design, but it's flawed. I would recommend this necklace at it's natural metal."
3.0,Definitely a costume piece. Looks nice with lingerie.
3.0,"I am 5'9 and around 200 lbs, with long legs, wide hips, and a large butt & bust. Since I am tall, I expected this to fit my broad shoulders and big chest. Well, it did fit, but there is still a lot of extra fabric. Despite having a large bust, there is too much fabric around my chest and it exposes my bra a little. I would only order this if you are comfortable showing cleavage and don't mind it being a little large. I kept this purchase because it is super cute and the fit isn't the worst."
3.0,"The straps over the shoulder are way thicker on the tank top that I received than on the tank top you see in the picture of the description.  If you look at the picture on Amazon, it shows them being super skinny over the shoulder which is what I prefer.  So the picture you see on Amazon is very misleading.  Also, the tank top is a very thick, itchy, and warm material.  It's very difficult to wear this tank top in the summer which is the time when you usually would want to wear a tank top.  I rarely wear tank tops in the winter but this tank top is one that I'm probably going to have to because the material is so thick and warm.  I prefer tank tops with a thinner material to stay cool in the summer.  Also, this tank top does not go as low on your chest as it shows in the picture.  While I wanted to show off the girls, this tank top does not really permit that with how high it rises up on your chest.  This tank top is definitely going to be a least favorite of mine since I didn't want to take the time and hassle of returning it. However, I do wish I could get my money back because I'm not really satisfied with this type of tank top."
3.0,Not a fan of the look or the material.
3.0,I liked the goggles.  They fit well.  The swim cap is not water proof!  I thought it would be or else I would have bought something else.
3.0,"Fits appropriate, thin material but adequate, looks decent when worn"
3.0,this piece is not what I thought it was going to be.
3.0,Fits a little small. Pants are too long
3.0,The sunglasses i got were pointed up like some kind of evil villain eyes.
3.0,The button size works for my J Banks dress shirts but the spring section on these is too large/long/loopy for me. Unfortunately that means they disconnect from th shirt button. Will look for a shorter looped ones next.
3.0,Unloosed threads everywhere in the jumpsuit. As a loyal customer I’m disappointed for the first time. I bought one before with another color and love it! I’m so sad I won’t be able to wear this one to the occasion I was going to. I have no time for returning it or exchanging it.😞
3.0,buy 1 size up then what you normally wear otherwise its a beautiful dress
3.0,Cute dress but they sent me the wrong color so I'm returning it - will reorder the correct one though. (FYI it does run larger in my opinion.)
3.0,Chinese (go figure) but kinda nice. Got it for my kid. He was a little upset to find out the compass did not actually work but otherwise he likes it.
3.0,Really Cheap material.  Good for a use.
3.0,"Very pretty but smaller than I expected - check the size, 8mm. Packed nicely for gifting."
3.0,Just sweats...nothing special.
3.0,"Item arrived late February 2020.  After 1 month of minimal use, item broke.  Customer service not very helpful, no resolution to replace and/or provide partial/full refund.  Most companies would stand behind their products and try to work out a resonable solution, but not this one.  Be weary, not happy with outcome. Item looks nice, but fragile."
3.0,"I like the collar neckline and the fabric feels very nice. But the cut of the nightgown is a little tight, even though it technically fits. It just twists up in a weird way when I'm trying to sleep and it makes it uncomfortable."
3.0,Poor material on back
3.0,"I’m typically a medium. Sized up to a large. Definitely size up. It’s not a thick fabric, makes a nice indoor top. The top isn’t “criss crossed” as shown, I haven’t tried to do it myself or might have to stitch the ends together to give that look."
3.0,"The bag is a bit large so it has enough space for all your toiletry, but if you will be using the 3 onz containers you may need a smaller bag because these smaller bottles will be falling inside.  The zippers are a bit weak and also the mesh since after using the bag for few months the mesh has a hole even if I didn't use the pouches much."
3.0,"Cups run small- band around chest runs big.  Darling fabric & colors!  Inexpensive- not intended for extended wear, but great for daily wash & wears!"
3.0,"Bought a Large. Fit in the chest area even though I’m busty (36D).<br />Color and fit were very flattering, BUT I had to return it because it was way too short."
3.0,"The earrings are super lightweight and gorgeous,  but when I received them the part you put through the ear had rough spots where the gold was worn off"
3.0,"Outfit was really cute, however, the sizing was off. I purchased a 12 month for my 17 month old and unfortunately the pants were still too big. I had to hem and dart the waist of the paints for my toddler to wear. Definitely runs big."
3.0,I was hoping for a dress slack but they're more like athletic pants.  I returned the first pair because they were a little tight.  My refund was processed quickly.
3.0,It’s a bit thin for my taste (the material) but it’s alright.
3.0,"Great quality, but the suggested size is way too long."
3.0,Too big and the material is super heavy.. Makes it too hot to wear
3.0,The yellow top didn't match the bananas in the bottoms. But still cute.
3.0,Cute but runs huge
3.0,The material is odd.
3.0,"The shirt looks wonderful on and fits very well but the fabric! THE FABRIC! It feels like cheap highschool paper towels, even after a few washes now!"
3.0,"fabric ok, too short for tunic I'm 5'8"
3.0,Got this for my 3 year old that typically wears a 4/5t. It’s a bit too small for her so she couldn’t wear it but we passed it along to someone who could and it looks so cute. The appearance is very cute and the material seems comfortable and durable and the design itself is cute as well. I’d recommend but buy a size up
3.0,"Offers great support and is comfortable, but you better be a contortionist to get it on.  Does not fully detach in the back, so it has to be pulled over the head and then fastened behind your back.  Not cool trying to get an underwire on over the head.  Needs a redesign for sure, IMO."
3.0,"These definitely are cute, but they are 100% synthetic fibers. The socks are a bit short and stocky and not all that comfortable because they are k in and of scratchy. I am a huge fan of Sockwell brand compression socks. They are very expensive, but I find them incredibly comfortable, dry on my feet because they are muti-blend fibers including wool and so extremely durable. Every pair I have is over 3 years old, has been in constant circulation and is still comfortable and functionable."
3.0,"cheaper metal, the stainless steel has a very youthful appeal, I think I will give to my 8 year old daughter"
3.0,"The material seems ok. It's soft on the inside and a satin material on the outside. I got a size 2x because I like my pajamas to be big and comfy when I sleep. Usually I can wear most 2x and they'll fit beautifully and as far as sleep wear they'll be very comfortable. I got the 2x and it is kinda small, definitely not comfy to sleep in. I also noticed that they seem to be cut strange. I personally didn't care for them and found them to be cut small and strange."
3.0,"I love the look of this hoodie! Size runs a little small in the waist but very long in the arms and the hood is massive. Hinestly, I don't even wear it because of those things."
3.0,"There was not enough feed back when I bought this dress so I wanted to leave some for the next person considering buying this dress. The dress is cute. The fabric is a stretchy knit.  Not see through. Size wise it runs small.  Do go by the bust and waist, hips measurements on the sizing chart.  But what they say the dress size is, is off.  I bought a X large (16-18) but it fit like a tighter large (11-12) would fit.  They described the top part of the dress correct it does fit snug.  There is an elastic waist and it is gathered but there is not a lot of material for the skirt so it pulls tighter on the belly.  So if you don't have much of a belly you would be fine.  I'm not comfortable wearing something that  accentuates my lumpy curves.  So I have to return it."
3.0,"Not bad, I had a lot of unmatching pairs. One pair had one tunnel that was made from a whole different material then the other one. It seemed almost twice as thick as the plastic used for the other tunnels. Lots of tunnels for a good price though! I usually mismatch them anyways."
3.0,"This is a nice design but I haven't wear or washed it yet, so can not comment on fading etc., but in general I wished the toe part had thicker weaves to last longer (usual problem with any socks these days!). I also prefer socks to have more natural fibers such as cotton and less synthetics, but it is becoming hard to find.<br />I'm looking the shorter version of same Piano keys but in black conversion, as I have one which is beaten up already and needs a replacement."
3.0,These look in the picture to be more of an ankle or capri length legging.  These are not at all.  These were so long and full length leggings.  That was not my issue with these. I am plus size and wear a 2X in all of my leggings.  These were extremely tight in the leg/calf area.  They are super stretchy and I could still get them up to my waist even with the tight legs since they were so long.  The waist area fit me with no issues and seemed to fit to size.  I could not test if they are see through with a good stretch though as I was too uncomfortable with the tightness on my calfs.  I have never had this in a legging and found it odd as most of the time the smallest area would be the waist.
3.0,"It works nicely, but the material of the band is really uncomfortable."
3.0,These run small.  I was rather disappointed in the pants because it took a long time prewashing them in cold water to get the color to stop running.  They aren’t very heavy so I don’t know how long they will last.  The high waist is great until you bend over and the waist folds over.
3.0,The measurements wind up with a too long belt
3.0,"I love these, however the 925 stamp is on the front of the bar."
3.0,Love the color but recommend washing before wearing as the color transfers. Was not loose fitting - size up for a more slouchy look. Otherwise looks great as unbuttoned cardigan
3.0,Once again this went to my daughter. I personally wouldn't keep it. She loves it.
3.0,Screws came loose within about two weeks of wear. They are very pretty though.
3.0,My daughter was super excited to open her package.  This unicorn purse is too cute. Not giving it the extra stars since the unicorn horn was all bent out of shape and I'm having a hard time trying to get it to stay straight.
3.0,The fit was not what I expected. The top ran small for someone with large breast.
3.0,size was not correct
3.0,They were too snall
3.0,"I purchased two of these stones.  The quartz does not look very natural, it has a plastic look and opalescent sheen to it.  They are pretty, so I continue to use them.  Would not buy again."
3.0,"Not what I thought they were. They are ok, but not as good as Comfort Flex Fit."
3.0,"I guess I didn't read the description well enough but these are actually colored, scented pencils. The lead inside is that of an actual colored pencil. They do not have an eraser."
3.0,Not bad. They break after about 2 months.
3.0,Some are cute. It's about what you expect for the price. A couple clasps are not centered with the front.
3.0,They are very cute especially for the price they got on my nose a little funny but I still like them
3.0,It is very chunky not very soft.
3.0,"The fit was fine. The dress was just lackluster. The colors were not nearly as vivid as the photos might suggest. I thought I ordered a crimson dress, but turns out it was more of a basic flat red color. Nothing special. :/"
3.0,Sling strap does not allow you to adjust the bag enough for a tight snug fit if you just want to throw over your shoulder
3.0,leave design raises off chest slightly at tip (i.e. does not sit flat)
3.0,"I used this to reglue a crown that had come loose. It held pretty nicely for about three weeks, then the crown popped off again. I was hoping this would work for longer as I'm currently out of state and can't reach my normal dentist. Ah well... guess I'll just have to renew the glue every three weeks until I get back home."
3.0,It’s great but the chain is big and large my kid is 11 years old but it doesn’t fit her so I had to put a better chain
3.0,Tee-shirt fabric thin and see through
3.0,These are just fine for the price. I will say that the red pair came with a chip in the lens (won't affect function) and that both sets of lens have a slight yellowish tint - they are not clear.
3.0,"I did a ton of research on these before buying them. Reviews indicted they were immediately comfortable and durable. They did appear to be very well-made, in terms of the build and materials. They're a handsome enough shoe, but when I put them on for the first time - the only time - they felt extremely boxy and rigid.<br /><br />My wife likes to say I have extremely picky feet, but I could immediately tell that these would cause a whole lot of pain to break in. For the price - or far less - I've bought shoes that were far more comfortable than these. I do like a stiff mid-sole, but not a rigid, stiff interior - especially for a light-duty, hiking shoe."
3.0,"This watch is a bit of a shame. I really like the design of it. It's simplistic, yet will look really good when put together with brown leather shoes and a matching belt. The problem is that it is rusted, and I haven't even worn it. It's brand new. Fresh out of the box and already rusted. I have uploaded pictures to go along with this review.<br /><br />I may buy another one, and hope that that one will be in better shape. I am definitely sending this one back though."
3.0,"This ring is very nice looking and I believe the quality is good, however, mine does not spin easily.  I can turn it with my opposing hand, but it will not spin if I use one of the fingers on the hand of which I'm wearing it.  Could be a manufacture flaw, but I have other spinner rings that spin much easier."
3.0,They make it look cheap.  The design overall is nice.  Just wish that they left off the sparkles.
3.0,"The fabric is not as high quality as other cotton/linen shorts on here. I'd prefer to buy the slightly more expensive shirts that fit and look better (and which will likely wash and wear better).<br /><br />Otherwise the shirt is a good value for the price, and thin and not too sheer. If you're looking for a thinner shirt then this would be a 4 star."
3.0,"This product looked great for the first few wears, but the weave of the band started to deteriorate with pretty minimal prodding from the buckle tongue. Still using it as it is on my beater watch, but probably not something that will last more than a few months before being replaced.<br /><br />Fabric is also very thin, which is nice for breathability, but makes it easy for the watch body to slip off when removing it or putting it on unless you remember to hold the non buckle end."
3.0,"I use it only as a wet shirt.  Keeps my belly warm. It is cut long,  it goes below the waist,  like a mini - mini skirt.  The first time i put it on  i got stuck.  Panic.  When i took it off,  got stuck,  panic. Have a dressing buddy w/ u to cut u out b4 suffocation."
3.0,"Quality is quite good, but size is off. size L really feels like a size M. So if you normally wear size L like me, you will need to order the XL"
3.0,Arrived timely packaging was sufficient.  However when I took it out of the bag to wrap I noticed the threading in one of the beanies was loose and coming out.  I was able to kind of pull it back in but wasn't thrilled that brand new the threading was already loose.  The other beanie was fine and my daughter loved them so all in all it was a descent purchase.
3.0,"I mean, I bought these glasses for driving and riding so it does not matter much, but the nose pieces are badly aligned and will look crooked. Not bad for the money though"
3.0,fast delivery but over priced for cheap product.
3.0,"One earring was missing, but otherwise worth the purchase."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, the leather felt cheap so I sent it back."
3.0,"I purchased this wig for a Treasure Troll Halloween costume when I was pregnant. It is not the fullest wig and I had trouble getting some of the &#34;hair&#34; to stay up (ended up using hair spray and some bobby pins). For the price though, it worked for my costume which I will probably only do once. Warning: it does fit very snugly, so for some it could border on being too tight."
3.0,It is very short.
3.0,Would have been a solid 5 star as it felt like a great product! Super comfortable but the band broke around 3 weeks after I got it. It pulled right out of the clasp.<br /><br />If they could fix the design in some way to be held in better to the clasp would definitely be worth it. Loved the color and feel.
3.0,Got rusty and color faded really quickly. But you get what you pay for 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,The dress is cute but a few heads up. First off this dress isn’t as “anti-wrinkle” as it wants you to think. The bottom definitely wrinkles. Also if you read threw the profile you find TWO different descriptions of what material the dress is made from. However for the price the dress is still good quality and it’s lightweight for the summer which was exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,"just ok. no shape to it, but i can wear it as a dress or with leggings. but def over sized. id buy one size smaller then you normally would."
3.0,"HONESTLY, I DO NOT KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS YET. JUST PUT IT ON SUNDAY 10/1/17. BUTTERFLY IS EXTREMELY CUTE ONCE ON. HOWEVER, IT'S MY 4TH DAY WITH IT ON &amp; IT IS STARTING TO MAKE MY TRAGUS SENSITIVE TO THE TOUCH. HAVE BEEN MAKING SURE THAT I CLEAN IT EVERY DAY W/ALCOHOL.<br />WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE BACKING OF THIS IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO TWIST ON (KEPT DROPPING IT) BECAUSE OF HOW SMALL THE BALL IS. IT TOOK MY SON (20) &amp; A PAIR OF TWEEZERS IN ORDER FOR IT TO FULLY TWIST ON ALL THE WAY."
3.0,Very tight and short. Order size up.
3.0,"These will do the trick, I basically need them for getting snow/ice off the car in the AM without my hands freezing off. They are a little stiff, I assume they will soften up. The pinky finger is a little short inside, like it was sewn too short. The touch screen doesn't work for me, I tried it on my phone and the phone wouldn't recognize the glove. But I'm ok with that. They will work for me."
3.0,The color is perfect. It fitted me perfectly but the white part was stained with the black one when I washed it.
3.0,"Gorgeous color, short torso... If I pull it up to where my boobs fit in it right, the leg opening becomes scandalously too high, ha! I'm 5'5&#34;, 245 lbs, and I wear approx an 18 so ordered the largest size. Don't think I could've gone down a size, but I've recently lost 25 lbs so I don't know where I'm fitting in clothes right now. The boob part is not well supported. Overall I like it however!"
3.0,"The product is as beautiful as it looks in the pictures and it is thick with a nice comfortable feel. My complaints are that the bands that go around the ears detach so easily. I've had to give my daughter several of them to keep on her as they are so flimsy. I expected them to be a little more sturdy. Also, I expected them to be packaged sealed in a box but they came in a clear plastic bag, which I don't think is the best for something that should be sterile."
3.0,"They were advertised, if I recall correctly, as being 8 mm beads.  They are small beads, not nearly as large as expected.  Was going to return but decided to keep them and use in some other fashion for Xmas decorating."
3.0,They're really soft which means they have no form. Sure - I realized that they fold down small but I assumed the sides would either be reinforced or out of a sturdier material. Its made out of a tarp like material. I have found a different use for them than what I bought them for. I wouldn't put anything heavy in them. If I had know how soft and unformed they were I wouldn't have gotten them.
3.0,Feels cheap. But looks amazing. ❤️💙
3.0,Beautiful dress get a size large but is way to small
3.0,"I found this dress on amazon... I ordered it really hopeful... It came and it was beautiful in person. It runs SMALL. I ordered a large and it was more like a small. Definitely meant for the more petite person.<br />This had the potential to me my favorite dress, it just was not meant to be... And so begins the search for another affordable dress with this pattern."
3.0,Nice quality hat…i love all Heybo gear.  But the hat description on site said mesh back and snap back.  Which got neither.  Im gonna keep.  Just wanted next buyer know.
3.0,not high quality but a cute shoe! takes forever to get here so expect a month shipping
3.0,More like a shirt. Couldn’t wear It for what I bought it for. I’ll keep it and wear it as a shirt.
3.0,Wont slip onto the ear piece big struggle.
3.0,Doesn't look like picture but. It looks like a men's suit on me. Even after returning and getting a smaller size. I wear a 38 DD and it still fit weird
3.0,Mine didn't look like the picture. It was more black.
3.0,Love the color selection. Comfy and cute. May not fit if you have big calves. Mine are probably average and they fit snug.
3.0,These run pretty small so definitely order a size or 2 up from what you are wanting.
3.0,Run Big and they are Wide
3.0,Although it was attractive in appearance it was too lightweight and delicate. There was also<br />a slight dent on the side of the earring.
3.0,I did not get the product that was advertised. It was flat and not round.
3.0,Wanted this dress for my bridesmaids. My bridesmaid went to a shop to get her measurements taken. Nothing was an exact match for the size chart so we got her a size 20. It looked beautiful and draped nicely over all the lumps and bumps we get as older women. The top was huge on her though. We thought it through and figured that buying a smaller size to fit the top would probably make the bottom too tight and lose the nice drape she had going on. It looks like it will have to be altered up top. All in all it is a beautiful and unique dress.
3.0,Just as the picture showed only problem is it will break if your not careful and Make a few modifications other then that it's a good piece
3.0,Cheap and tarnished quickly
3.0,"Para ser un pantalón de tela, suelto la talla corre demasiado pequeño, yo soy 5'2ft ordené talla S y me quedó estilo capri... así que recomiendo elegir una talla más grande. En cuanto a la tela, la tela es fresca, cómoda e ideal para días calurosos y el color es muy lindo."
3.0,"I sort of doubt that these are leather, they seem plastic.  The ends were not properly finished and they started coming apart in a few days.  I sealed the ends myself and they are fine."
3.0,Ordered a large because I wanted the item really big and it ended up fitting like a medium/small.
3.0,"If they're going to update the product, update the picture. I bought this cause my kid likes ones w/o a strap on back of the ankle, this one has them even though it's not in the picture. Annoying."
3.0,I bought a size small.  Didn't have xs. Still too big for me as I wear a 00 pants.
3.0,Not at all what the Photo shows. The one that came had a Star that looked kinda Hot Glued on and not a Painted Star..plus it's thinner than the one in the Photo too. There is one that I seen sold on Amazon with the exact Photo..but makes me wonder if I ordered that one for my Fiance if I'd get the one in this Photo instead. I guess someone got their Tiara Models mixed up with the Product Number. I'm giving this 3 Stars since my Fiance seemed fine with it..yet she said it felt a bit tight and a little heavy too.
3.0,Looks cheap got to see the rest of pics nothing like model
3.0,I really liked how this necklace looked but the globe was like oval shaped and The binoculars like kind of dumb up there so I'm going to move them
3.0,"When I took it out of the bag, my cat was happy because it was raining feathers! I'm sure they all do if they are this cheap."
3.0,Ended up being too small to fit my wrist and never wore it
3.0,"I got these because I needed something a little more stretchy than regular jeans. These start off fitting snug but then as you wear them during the day they get extremely loose to where the inside draw string does not do a lot of good keeping them up. These will not be jeans you can wear multiple times before you wash them. I give them a 3, because they are stretchy and the length was fine, but the fit was very baggy after wearing them for more than 3 hours."
3.0,"spandex and lace, does not feel like silk"
3.0,It’s weirdly too stretchy. I want it to be a firmer elastic. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3.0,It would not stay closed
3.0,"These are really pretty and I like them a lot, but a little hard to deal with. It's difficult to put the backs on white it's properly positioned on your ear. So if you twist it to put the back in, then it becomes difficult to place into proper position. I've tried wearing it without the backing, but sometimes it slides off the earlobe (so then it's hanging from my ear). Also I slightly bend the post out to put it on my earlobe (I guess I have fatty lines?) and then pinch them closed when it's in position. I fear that the post will end up breaking off after too much of it."
3.0,The top is huge but the bottom fits great. It still works though.
3.0,Not very big need to add extension for a comfortable fit
3.0,2 of the 3 were great - 1 has very scratchy connections and the clasp is not secure.
3.0,"I ordered these tunnels and eyelets for my 2g ears and there were a little bigger than my existing size.  I did have to stretch a little, but for the price and quality, I'm not too upset."
3.0,"I don’t remember ordering this, but when it showed up in the mail one day I thought; what the heck? So I tried it on. Now granted, I’m a 6ft 220lbs man, but I consider myself a “slim fit” or “medium husky” at most, but the shirt was just a tad on the small side. Even with the open shoulders, which I love by the way, it was a little tight across the chest, but my pits were very well ventilated! In fact, the airflow was so great that I was inspired to do some yard work, and I must say that I think my neighbor, Carl, must have really been envious of my new apparel, because he just couldn’t stop looking at me. I think I may order him one as a friendly neighbor Christmas gift."
3.0,Pretty kind of dressy. Little bigger than I look.
3.0,It fits kind of small so order a size up
3.0,"Warm, fit as expected. Have to be honest here- the fur looks like something the cat dragged in. Sorry"
3.0,Sheds fibers. Not durable even when hand-washed.
3.0,"My kid loved this for halloween and received lots of great comments from other trick-or-treaters.  Unfortunately, it arrived with a short circuit in the DC connector that caused the fan to start and stop intermittently and there wasn't time to send it back, so I had to splice the wire with a wire-stripper and electrical tape to make a direct connection from the fan to the battery box.  The on/off switch still functions as normal, it just means the costume and battery box are forever linked and must be put on simultaneously."
3.0,Have not used them yet but I'm sure they will be fine for emergencies. We are going to Ireland and wanted to have them on hand.
3.0,"The material is nice but they are so so baggy. They need to make a regular version, these seem made for super thick thighs."
3.0,"Love the watch not a fan of the band, but that's a easy fix."
3.0,"Its a pretty bag but I wish I'd have read reviews prior to purchase. The zipper catches on the handle, and its smaller than it looks in the picture. Its never going to work for a beach trip. I don't think a beach towel for an adult would fit.. It will be good for my 2 year old daughter to play with around the house. On a separate note, it did arrive promptly."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress! But it had a few issues that I had to return. First off, I couldn’t button all the buttons. It came partially buttoned, so when I tried to button the rest. The button hole was slightly too small making it really tough to close it all up. Second, it’s way too short. Standing it looks cute! But the length hits right under my butt. So if I sit down, it’s far too short for the public!  I guess I could use this as a bathing suit cover up, except the buttons make it impossible to use. Maybe size up?"
3.0,"Got this for my daughter for Valentine’s Day it broke the first day she Worn it, sadly I returned it with no problem."
3.0,Can’t even wear it it’s huge put in on and fell on to the floor it doesn’t give measurements anywhere the only reference to a number was 10” nothing is that big  it’s really cute reviews are all over the place it’s a good thing it didn’t cost much really disappointed
3.0,"Beautiful cut and fabric, but order at least a size smaller, I had to return mine because it was far too large."
3.0,"They used a very thin wire ring to connect the three chains to the big loop, and I kept having it break on me whenever the chains got stuck on something. Because of that, I haven't been able to wear them in a while."
3.0,"I have large, broad shoulders, and it was loose on me. It is also much longer than on the model in the picture. Pay attention to the inches length of the dress stated in the description. They are NOT kidding. I am 5'4&#34; and this dress could be pulled down to my knees and stay there."
3.0,Chain is very cheap and the pendant and key are cute but very small. I cant remember but I don't think the key fits the lock.
3.0,Somewhat right around the face! But nice my glasses don’t fog up and it is comfortable for the most part
3.0,I thought the setting would be a little larger.  Perhaps I should have ordered the 8 carat.
3.0,Cut outs seemed too big. Made dress look oversized.
3.0,"These are very unique earrings, I really like the spiral pair. The other pair seemed to have a sharp edge on the end, so it hurt when I put them on. And apparently I am a bit allergic to whatever they are made of."
3.0,Not. Red
3.0,"Beautiful dress, very tight across the bust"
3.0,If you are between two sizes choose the one higher since this was a bit fight.
3.0,"didnt fit the size of my 7 month old baby's head. too small :( also, wish the pinks were more of a diversity. all looked very similar"
3.0,"Falls off and I need to put pins on top to secure it, however, the pins aren't even securing it so it still slides at night. If I can pin the sides they would stay better but I can't sleep or turn my head.  So the product is pretty and does an OK job."
3.0,"Don't find these as breathable as regular cotton. Nicely made, fit well."
3.0,"Nice. just bigger than my old Russel XL sweatshirts. They've definitely added  4 plus inches around gut area ,"
3.0,since i don't have much hips this dress doesn't fit well on me at all. it's empty on the sides. terrible that i can't return it because i was unable to do the return transaction sooner. pretty color though so i may give it to a good friend of mine.
3.0,"I ordered a 9/10. I am a true size 10. I wear it in almost every brand of shoe and type of shoe. These BARELY fit. No socks can be worn with them, but maybe after they have stretched some.<br />So, if you are a size ten and you like some room, I would suggest ordering up, as my heel goes right to the furthest point acceptable. (No hanging over.) That is without socks of any kind.<br />They are cute and what I wanted though so I am keeping them.<br />Nice cushion<br />Hard sole<br />Material on top is lighter weight, which is what I needed for summer.<br />If these fit better, I would give them a higher rating."
3.0,It's a great costume it comes with every thing you need but. I pick the XL and The pants where too long with a waist that my sister can't even put on and the jacket was to wide. The size is sorta all over the place. But the quality is there. Good buy but I recommend sending your size
3.0,I wasn't expecting the sparkles. And it's basically see through. Good enough for a costume. Not much else.
3.0,"Clearly order the 20mm but got 22mm, I was able to squeeze in my Gamin Fenix 7s but it didn't look right. I have a decommission Gamin Forerunner 935 to try and it fit nicely but already have few spare band. Is worth it If got correct sizing that weight 5 gram. Velcro isn't as picture but have the four small bar at each end. There is a little bit of stretch for comfort and feel good in normal wear. I rate it at 4 stars."
3.0,they are way too long and the waist is sized larger than they truly are.  for the price and quantity of times i need to wear fr clothing i feel these are a decent deal.
3.0,"Great shirt/fabric/make, but it runs about 2 sizes small. Sadly, had to return it."
3.0,"Arrived quickly, seller communicated well, but I just thought for a size XXL it would be bigger. I just don't like these Chinese sizings on clothes.<br />It's a decent sweater, 100% polyester. Probably wouldn't buy again but only due to sizing."
3.0,"I was so excited to get these because I've always loved anything cheetah or leopard print. It is unfortunate that though these have stretch, you have to size up 2-3 sizes so that the pattern doesn't stretch to a very unattractive way. I gave these to my mom who is quite smaller than me and hopefully they won't be ridiculously stretched out with her too."
3.0,"Loved the print but runs very small. Husband bought me this dress as a gift and it was tight. Material was thin and undergarment and bulges could be seen through the material.<br />I am usually a small dress (height 5'3""/ 118 lbs so not a big person."
3.0,"They were okay, but not s substitute for transitional lenses.  I keep them by my sewing machine so I don't have to find my transitional lenses to read a little something.<br /><br />They were too large for my face, but they are usable."
3.0,"As expected, not great material but okay for price."
3.0,Modelo muy bonito aunque un poco pesada la cartera.
3.0,"Personally, it doesn't fit well.  But cute dress."
3.0,Didnt like the cut but cute shirt
3.0,Looks good size small buy one size larger
3.0,You get what you pay for! : )
3.0,Nylon type pullover. Weird texture
3.0,Nice...kinda small
3.0,Came in as expected.
3.0,Fit is good but seams poorly sewn. This could have been just a bad pair though.
3.0,Thought they would be a little better quality but still an elegant pair of eye glasses.
3.0,Not an XL size... It fit like a sm/med
3.0,When I first opened the package I thought it was defective because of the strapping. Only one side has a strap and the other side has two loose ends. Would prefer straps on both sides. I just tie a small knot in the front to connect the loose ends and then tuck them away inside my bra.
3.0,ran small so exchanged for a size up and is now perfect
3.0,Very pretty but it leaves an imprint on my forehead.  To tight.
3.0,This dress is beautiful and the material is nice but unfortunately mine was not stitched properly. It came with a hold rite above my breast and that really sucks :(
3.0,"I wish that I could have kept this dress. I ordered XS but sadly it was still WAY too long. I tried to tie in a knot but it just didn't look as nice on me that way. I'm approx 5' 1"" (I used to be almost 5' 3"" but age and gravity have taken its toll on mu spine I guess. Anyway.... it looked best with my hands in my pockets. It is flowy and very comfy but even with the straps shortened as much as I could get them, it was dragging considerably on the floor. Wearing heels aren't really an option for me either but I supposed if one did wear heels, it would lessen the overwhelming length. So in all, I wish so much that I could have kept it. I still would recommend others to try it thougth!"
3.0,"Pretty, but I expected more quality for the price."
3.0,Definitely Not a Sweatshirt like it states. Very light weight material. It is a soft material but not a sweatshirt like I wanted. Little disappointed in the looks as well. Definitely not as pictured either.  It does run a little small so order up a size if you decide to buy.  You get what you pay for I guess.
3.0,The earrings are heavy and eventually uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,"I'm 5'3 and from waist to knees its a perfect fit however 2-3 more inches of materials is on the ground will need to cut. Item is perfect for tall persons, material thick & stretchy. Very nice just too long"
3.0,Cute for gymnastics - top is boxy so it fits loose
3.0,Very cute but little bell fell off within hours of wearing. Luckily I was able to reattach it
3.0,Great idea but not very warm
3.0,"I love the feel of the material, the length and the leg fit, but am surprised at how small the waistband is, both in width of the elastic and in actual waist size."
3.0,Nice owl bracelet. I bought it for a Mother's Day gift. Hope she like it. Looks fancy. The charms are cute.
3.0,That there too big now I need to return them
3.0,Some kind of thread came out in bunches of the scarf and found a quarter size hole later in the corner. Too late to return.
3.0,Good legging.. some strings where poking out.  I had to do some cutting.
3.0,"Although, I did have to return this item, the seller was amazing at responding & remedying the issues. I was able to return to their US warehouse in Ontario, California & although they say they couldn’t locate my return package back to them, the seller still refunded me on the honor system. The overalls are sized about 1-2 sizes too small (not true to size) not American sizing, anyway. The overalls are high rise/high waisted for a short torso. They are fitted. The jean material is thin but stretchy (not super stretchy) but they are cute. Did not work on my body type. 5’ 2”. 32E, 28 waist, 37 hips. Athletic/muscular body type. 140lbs. Normally wear a 26 jeans or XS to S bottoms. Slightly longer torso than legs. According to their size chart, a medium would’ve fit me relaxed, like I wanted. However, I couldn’t even get them zipped. I probably would’ve had to order an XL for them to zip & be even slightly relaxed. The legs would also be too long on me & it would ride up the crotch area. So these unfortunately didn’t work for me. I still appreciate the sellers communication & cooperation though. 2 stars for the overalls & 5 star seller. I averaged it out to 3 stars."
3.0,"While the dress and material is very pretty , it arrived damaged with a hole under the smocking , sadly I will be returning."
3.0,Picture wasn’t clear
3.0,I just needed a pair of inexpensive pants for my Halloween costume. These were great for that. I wouldn't suggest for daily wear. Not quality material or well sewn together. Hence why they were so cheap
3.0,Beautiful fur but too small & too tight.
3.0,I have an 8” wrist and could not use these.
3.0,"They're a little big for my liking, and not as brown as listed."
3.0,"The shirt is supposed to be loose but there’s no structure at all to it. Very boxy. I am 125 pounds, 5’6”, 34DD, house glass shape (but frying pan bottom). I am anywhere between a small and medium for tops (depending on the brand and type of shirt), ordered medium bc of my lady lumps and based on reviews. The material is fine, soft, stitching was fine…..just very “square” in shape…..made me look very frumpy. Maybe small would have been better, but didn't like it enough to go through the whole return and reorder and wait process…first world problems, am I right?!"
3.0,"Buckle is a little to wide, very difficult to put through the loops of jeans ."
3.0,They &#34;DO NOT&#34; Look Like The Picture Listed ..... But They Are Still Nice ..... You Get What You Pay For!
3.0,I liked the design in the picture. But when received it was small which is saying a lot as my hat is small as well. But the most disappointing thing about it is it looks as cheap as it cost me. I suppose I got what I paid for.
3.0,And their pants were to my ankles and a little saggy in the front area shirt was perfect material was perfect will order again
3.0,"it fits pretty ok, but it is small so order a size up"
3.0,I received the wrong color 😭
3.0,Kind of
3.0,Good for walk
3.0,Runs small and not for narrow feet.
3.0,Well I was hoping this was going to be a more girly tshirt fit- but it’s actually just a regular cotton T-shirt fit. If that’s what you are looking for then perfect- but I was hoping it’d be a little more shapely and fitted. The material is nice - not too stiff like some cotton shirts. The decal seems good quality and should hopefully not peel after a few washes. I’m 5’2 - 150 lbs athletic build. Ordered a medium.
3.0,"The material was weird, not sure what it was made of. Otherwise the dress was ok."
3.0,Waistband a bit stiff and tight but pants are comfy and flattering. Prefer the pink (I bought both)
3.0,"I really like this top, but unfortunately it runs small. I ordered based on the measurements listed, and they are consistent with what I usually purchase but this barely fit. Not only did I go by the measurements, but they also list American size xxl is 20-22. I'm a true 20 and I can get it on, but the arms are so tight I was afraid to bust the seam! It barely fit across my chest and I can wear C's, and it was not loose anywhere. I was very confused about the packaging the shirt came in, there was a sticker listing xxl, and then a barcode product sticker listing 5xxl. The shirt itself says it's a xxl. I'm assuming it's a conversion to US sizes but I really don't know. I don't mind the material- it's listed as chiffon, and that’s exactly what it is! It's actually a bit softer than other chiffon clothing I have, which is a plus.  It's important to note that  the tag says NOT to put in the washer (but the dryer is ok?), so if you're not into hand washing or dry cleaning, this is not for you. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and I hope that it helps you decide if this item is for you."
3.0,It was nice material but too big and I got a small!!!
3.0,I love how they look but they are a bit big. I have to have them tailored.
3.0,"What can you expect for the price.... quality ok top and bottom seemed like two different sizes (bottoms smaller and I don't have a butt), shipping time as long but again for the price, I give it 3 stars."
3.0,"Good quality elastic band.<br /><br />Cheap looking/feeling leather, will be curious to see if it last 6 months."
3.0,I returned these shoes because they were bulky looking and too wide. The ones pictured look more compact/narrow. Looks too big on my daughters feet even though they fit her fine. She didn’t like the way they felt. Easy return so I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.
3.0,"Roomy, lightweight, hides the belly. Nice top, but the back is a little long."
3.0,Lovely style and color. Unfortunately it is a fragile fabric - the kind that will catch and pull with just a bit of rough skin.  Returned.
3.0,"I really have wanted earrings like this for some time.  When I decided to treat myself to something this holiday season, I choose these.  When they arrived, I was pleased overall and was anxious to have an occasion to wear them.  When I tried them on, however, one of the earrings would not securely clasp and stay closed on my ear.  The other one was perfectly fine.  I deemed them unwearable because of this and have sent them back hoping for a replacement pair.  While I was not able to ever wear them, they seemed of good quality and very nice.  It was disappointing and hopefully I can get another pair, else I'll look elsewhere."
3.0,Arm holes are extremely large in proportion to the body which is more like a M size. Overpriced. Wouldn't purchase again. I purchased the trench coat which is better quality.
3.0,Read the headline
3.0,Cute - but got it for a concert venue with clear bag only restrictions. They almost didn't let is through.
3.0,"I purchased two different brands of compression socks and found info on putting them on and tried several different suggestions.  I have arthritis in my hands and was concerned that I would have problems even before ordering but decided to give them a try. The other brand that I purchased was much easier to put on and without this comparison I would have assumed it was my problem and the socks did no contribution to my difficulty. After I got them on I liked the fit, comfort, appearance and amount of compression."
3.0,"I am having eye surgery so instead of updating my prescription sunglasses for $350.00 decided to try clip ons.<br />I am very sun sensitive so these did not work for me. There was a gap above the glasses that let too much sunlight in.<br />Then the mirror effect picked up the vision behind me thus blocking most of my view. Also the 4 prongs that grip the glasses have pads on them, 3 fell out in the first 2 weeks of use.<br />For someone else these might be just right, for me it was not a good experience."
3.0,Came promptly. But the black nose ring came plain and not twisted. Pretty disappointed because that was the one i was most excited as well
3.0,"Good looking and sturdy, but very difficult to close."
3.0,I bought these for my daughter because they were SO cute. She literally wore them one time and they were super tight. Definitely size up if you are thinking about buying them.
3.0,The bag itself is definitely cool. But the functionality of it is kinda lame. Too big in my opinion and the side pockets are like deep into the bag for boots or shoes or something on both sides. Just a weird way to do a duffel bag in my opinion. I love the VW zippers though.
3.0,"I’m 5’4 and the dress hits mid calf, not at knee level. Also if you’re well endowed up top then the tie hits right under your boobs and not at the natural waist. I’ll probably use it as a bathing suit cover up rather than a regular dress. The material is nice and it’s definitely a nice dark army green.<br /><br />Put it this way, if I tried it on in a store, I wouldn’t buy it, but it’s not bad enough for me to return it."
3.0,Don't think it's going to be durable enough
3.0,A little over two months and it's stretched probably 2 sizes. Plus it tears your wrist hair out.
3.0,We have a pair of these in a large and they fit my husband perfectly. We purchased two more colors and the purple plaid didn’t fit like the other larges. I’m not sure what the deal is there as they’re the same size but different colors.
3.0,"ok- couple things with these pants... First, the color is way off from this image. They are not a light bright blue. They arrived much darker than I expected. Not a huge deal, but still disappointing. Second, They failed the sweat test! :-( Totally shows sweat lines in the fabric. Which is why i only gave the 3 stars. I will say that they fit nicely, the fabric is soft and the pants are not see through."
3.0,Good quality pants and fit everywhere it should except they are a little too short. Other than that I would probably purchase again.
3.0,I'm a full grown man and this was too small for my nose.
3.0,Zkhoer womens high neck lightweight sweater.  So the colors are an interesting choice and I really dont like purple or red. Now that being said I actually liked this top on better than when I was staring at it on hl the hanger. I have blonde hair and am tanner from running and the colors I was told looked good with my hair and skin tones. I like the style of the top the best it is really cute unzipped part way. The material is sooo soft like rub your face all day on your sleeve soft. So you get it its soft but it is also lightweight and not clingy. I recieved a large and I am 5'4 111lbs and a 34D this was big on me but not in the I stole my husbands sweatshirt kind of way. This was loose but still fell correctly with my  body line so I didnt look like I was swimming in it. The length was fine it landed right above the underside of my bottom. I did deduct 1 star for the pockets. You could see the pockets peeking out from under the front hemline of the shirt. I cut the pockets out and sewed them shut really strange the pockets were basically free floating and the would peek out from the bottom of the top randomly. Overall it's a decent lightweight sweater for fall with a stand out pattern and color scheme.
3.0,The arm holes are oddly large. Not what I expected.
3.0,They're beautiful and affordable but way too large and heavy for my ears.
3.0,Saw this on an influencer. I wanted to love this since she looked cute. But this is really wide on. I felt like a pumpkin. The frayed edges were really cute but I’m trying to look thinner not rounder. :)
3.0,Thin material. Doesn't fit slouchy like in picture even after I bought a size up. Cut isn't flattering.
3.0,Cute but frayed from the time I just took it out of the packaging.  Was supposed to be for a superhero valentines daddy daughter dance but looking for other options with such a short time to work with getting a replacement!
3.0,"Ok. Overall the sweater is good. The only issue I had was the length. I normally wear a med, but I ordered an extra large based on others stating it runs small. Thank goodness I did. This sweater runs small so size up a couple of sizes if you are looking for the look displayed in the photo. Also, it runs a little short for my liking. I was looking for a sweater to wear with leggings that can cover by bottom. That did not happen! I haven't washed it yet and I'm nervous on what the size will be after the washing."
3.0,It took few weeks to receive.  Otherwise I recommend it
3.0,Colors were nice.  Expected a softer scarf
3.0,"they're really pretty and fit well, but one of the finger loops broke a few hours in. I can sew it, I suppose."
3.0,These pants would be comfy but I ordered a large and they were too small. I usually wear a size XL so I guess I would say to order your normal size. I will be returning these for an XL pair if possible.
3.0,Very cute but it does fall off easily. I've worn it about 5 times and gold is already starting to rub off... the style is great but I wish it was a little more durable.
3.0,"Watch looks nice and the price is good, but the first one I got didn't have a working clasp on the band. Kind of a bummer, since that was a Christmas gift, but the replacement they sent is better."
3.0,Too small -  returned.
3.0,A comfortable mask.<br />But this type of mask is often bannd for indoor uses due to a lack vent filter. Wish the manufacturer comes up with a filtered vent.
3.0,The color is navy blue much different  then the picture.  However rhe material & style is beautiful.
3.0,They were larger than I expected
3.0,"I have a small head and wear youth hats, and it's also tough to find sunglasses that aren't too big on my face. I know from the clip-ons I wear that 52mm is a good size on me, and even 54mm is ok. So I ordered these glasses, expecting them to fit well.<br /><br />They're huge and I look ridiculous with them on! The overall width of the frame is 2.5"", considerably bigger than the description made it sound like they would be.<br /><br />Otherwise, these are quite nice. Not too heavy. But I'll be giving them away."
3.0,This dress is really cute but fits very big. It could use a belt because otherwise you look pregnant.
3.0,Shorts were a little small but so cute and comfy
3.0,"The fit is true to size and it is very pretty. However, it is not 925 sterling silver. Probably not even plated with silver as it doesn't have the 925 mark and the color has worn to brass in just days. I don't wear it sleeping or while washing so just normal dry wear has worn it off in less than 7 days."
3.0,The zipper teeth are already messed up making it hard to close. I've only used it a few weeks.  Other than that I love it. But now I'll have to look for a new wallet.
3.0,Super thin and cheap material and the image on the sweatshirt got messed up after one wash. It’s cheap but don’t expect much.
3.0,Definitely order a size or 2 up
3.0,Did the trick but good for only 1-2 wearings
3.0,"First of all I should have ordered a small but that's my fault.<br />Secondly it's kinda hard to figure out and is not adjustable I any way.<br />It did arrive waaaay before I expected it to so props for that,I might have to give it to my mom though.It's definitely to big and loose for me but again that's my fault."
3.0,"Just be aware this goes on the inside of the vehicle. Due to this you really cannot see what is even is unless you are within 3-5 feet. If you are looking for something to go on the outside of your vehicle, this product is not for you."
3.0,"I bought a couple sizes up after reading some reviews, I should have just bought my normal size. It's still beautiful, the size issue was my own fault. However, the color issue was the seller. I ordered the dark blue and got that medium blue color. That was disappointing, but it's still a nice dress."
3.0,I Haven’t use this product but it looks good
3.0,"Looks different rather than on the image,the texture of the fabric resembles a synthetic curtain"
3.0,La talla es mas pequeña a relacion del calzado deportivo tipo running.
3.0,"Decent product, but made of cheap fleece, in CHINA. Really? I'd rather pay more for a product made here in St. Paul, or at least the U.S. by this St. Paul company, and have it made with Polar Tec."
3.0,"Very stiff, didn't fit over my glasses well"
3.0,A little big but good material
3.0,Satisfied with this product as delivery was speedy and the item itself is apreciated
3.0,"Love the style, not sure it will wash well.  The color is totally off, I received a tan, brownish color, not an off-white.<br />Sending it back, doesn't go well with the color in my wardrobe.  Took awhile to received, disappointed in the color, and having to<br />wait so long.  The customer service however was very good."
3.0,"this skirt runs a tad smallish.<br /><br />the first one came with some of the ruffles seams torn.  the replacement came with the bow defective (neither attached nor tied).<br /><br />order way ahead in case you get a few duds, otherwise it was a very cute little skirt."
3.0,"I got a XL, and while it does fit, I feel like it runs on the smaller side/is short. I realize the cropped look is in, but it does seem shorter to me than pictured. The color is nice, but is slightly lighter than what you see pictured. It’s a good red wine color. The floral stitching is as pictured, if not better looking than pictured."
3.0,it fits but not very comfortable wearing it doing exercise
3.0,its a tee shirt
3.0,Front tie makes a bump under tops over waistline. Somewhat short rise. Fabric seems stiff.
3.0,"I gave it only 3 stars because they don’t really lift or support, they just cover.  They do stay in place though."
3.0,"I wanted to like this bag more. I like the material and size and compartments. But it arrived with the middle sipper already broken, you can zip it but it just peels apart (ghetto zipper). And then just yesterday after a week of use, the cross body strap just breaks and my whole bag drops to the ground. Not great hardware, but I'm still using it for the size and compartments. I guess for the price I shouldn't expect more?"
3.0,"On the first wash, the color faded quickly!"
3.0,"I loved this fitbit band at first and received many compliments on it. However, I wish I'd read all of the reviews because like a few others said, the screws on the sides tend to come undone rather easily (maybe they're not long enough??) and I have to use a screwdriver every other day to re-attach them to the band. I want to keep wearing this because I like it, but the inconvenience of fixing the screws on a regular basis is becoming a big drawback. I'd like to know that my band will stay put together the way it's supposed to, and these screws are more than likely going to fall out and get lost sooner rather than later."
3.0,"Sexy design that i love only problem is if you have big boobs it isnt as flattering because there isnt support, so if your a smaller cup size will be perfect for you. But ive always had weird proportions so most things dont fit me anyways. Lace is pretty sturdy and opening can be moved so you can surprised your sweetheart. And straps are strechy so if theres tugging theres no problem"
3.0,"Has a swimsuit material which isn’t a big deal to me, it also kind of flares out at the bottom which was strange but it was inexpensive so yk"
3.0,Good for the first 6 months but broke after one drop
3.0,"I like the shoes but sadly, all the blue is rubbing off. My son wore these shoes 3times to a playground, trampoline and swing and the blue is almost rubbed off"
3.0,Ring looks gorgeous. I get compliment on it but now it’s turning green and so is my finger! I don’t even wash dishes with it because I didn’t want this to happen!
3.0,"Dumdum pop for size reference. Words scratch off easily, looks more like a vinyl sticker than an engraving. Very small. Looks better on the computer/website. It came in a nice pouch though, and it is a gift, so I just hope it stands up in durability for the recipient. Because that's difficult to tell. Would not recommend as a gift for others."
3.0,The sunglasses look exactly like the picture however the one arm is lose and the classes are crooked and do not sit right on my face. I did purchase these in hopes of them lasting a decent amount of time but I do have a feeling they are not going to last as long as i like. I am a little disappointed in the quality of the glasses
3.0,"My mom bought, she didn't like it. Fabric look poor. Maybe she will use it to stay at home... Jaja."
3.0,Design of shirt is great but not true to size. Order a size bigger.
3.0,"These were nice, but a lot bigger than I thought"
3.0,They sent the wrong color- dress was supposed to be purple not pink.  Won’t be exchanging due to social distancing practices.  Otherwise it is good quality.
3.0,Nice vibrant color and design but sheds day 1. I bought it to be bigger so size is fine
3.0,These are smaller than you light expect
3.0,"PRETTY THIN MATERIAL, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  BUT I WILL KEEP IT."
3.0,Cheap but ok for the price.
3.0,Purse is super cute but the metal connector for the strap broke within a week.
3.0,The chain / clasp is junk. Buy another chain to use with this one.
3.0,"The shirt is comfortable and soft, but it looks like a pajama top. So I wear it around the house or for running errands."
3.0,Too small in the bust.  Ordered a size larger but the bust was too small.  I was told I could take it to get altered but there isn't enough material in the dress to alter it.
3.0,"A little disappointed that I was led to believe this was a brand new shirt. I guess I should of know it wasn't by the amount I paid. It didn't come with tags and it was somewhat dirty. Nonetheless, I'll wash it and  wear it."
3.0,"Started a new job doing security where I do a 2 hour full building 13 floor patrol. So I bought some nice lite Nike boots with good arch support insoles, but my ankles and my left foot were hurting by the end of the night so I bought these supports. They definitely help with the compression and ankle support, but my arch still doesn't get any love from these.<br /><br />So the verdict is only a 3 star - good compression over 8 hours, soft fabric that wears well under any sock, stays in place, good for gimpy ankles, just not for real arch support."
3.0,Noting it look like use cloth
3.0,I like the earrings but were a couple of issues with my order. I only received 1 standard pair of backs for the earring. And I received two pairs of gold rather than 1 pair of silver.
3.0,Very nice sterling quality.  Much smaller than I thought it would be.  Prompt shipping.
3.0,The shorts are actually really nice…. The top is way too small. It’s not even what I would consider a crop top. I put it on and it rolled up under my boobs. I have cried from laughing so hard. I’ve never seen a top like this in my life. If you are a bigger girl up top like me… save your money!!
3.0,Turned blackbafter 2nd use
3.0,"These worked great! Waterproof, they don’t stretch a lot, fit as ordered. They aren’t super comfy, but they are cute and have pockets!!"
3.0,they are pretty but sort of heavy.
3.0,"I don't care for this sleek material.  It feels weird on my body....doesn't breathe that well for me, personally.  Cute though.  They look nice - sort of large around mid section if you like that.  I don't....I'd prefer them to fit snugly or at least to shape of my bod."
3.0,"These things are HUGE!  Not what I expected.  Although they seem well made, I may return them as they are WAY bulkier that anticipated.  They are almost comical"
3.0,"The hood and quality are fine, however the color was not the same as in the picture. the pcture shows pink ears with gray paws, the one that came had red ears and black paws that you could hardly see on the black fur. disappointed, but if you dont care about the color it was fine."
3.0,I'm only giving it three stars because of the size.  I'm a normal size 14. I don't have much of a waist and I'm a 40D bra.  This top looked hideous on me.  It wasn't long enough to cover my butt and it was tight in the shoulders and upper sleeves... It made my boobs look triple the size.  The sizing is all off...The pants were PERFECT.  So I guess I can wear them with something else. But that top.. good lord. No NO NOOO!
3.0,"Might have been my fault, but it's really tiny. It's pretty, but it's tiny."
3.0,"They look nice BUT I was looking for a red lense. The description is red, but it's grey."
3.0,I ordered the largest size- I usually wear Small. However it is still too tight and I had to cut the area around the bras to get more room.
3.0,Not a good quality fabric. Doesn’t breath and rolls up  Has a nice stretch
3.0,"Beautiful dress but it’s too revealing so I feel uncomfortable wearing it publicly. Quality of the material and design was really beautiful, fitting as expected."
3.0,"pretty cheap feeling to it, but, what you expect, i got it for $3"
3.0,Very satisfied with my purchase.  It just the right size to suit my purpose.
3.0,"This hat is not a one size fits all.... While large, it is small for an xl head.  The weave of the natural fiber is a bit loose, having gaps throughout. There are a few frays also. Nothing that I would return for the price I paid, and it works for what I need."
3.0,Thin and kind of cheap but very cute!
3.0,"I normally wear a medium and got these pants in a medium.<br />They are way to tight - I need a larger size.<br />The packaging says medium but I’m not able to find a size on the actual pants. In fact the care instructions label is ripped off of the pants!!! I’m not sure if these are used or what.<br />The waist of these pants come to my belly button and sense they are too tight they give me a muffin top.<br />It’s really too bad that they aren’t the right size because I think these pants could be great for traveling and also work.<br />The hem hit me right at the ankle and I think its a cute cut. It works for both flats and heels.<br />These pants can be dressed up or down.<br />The pants are not as thick/warm as I was expecting them to be. For some reason in my head I was thinking they would be like ski pants warm - which of course they are not. They are warm leggings as described.<br />If I had to change one thing about these pants it would be that the pockets weren’t all fake - I need pockets in pants!<br /><br />** Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review.<br />I hope the information that I've provided helps to make your decision a little easier.<br />If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below."
3.0,"I wish I hadn't listened to the reviews saying to order a size up. I am 5'5"", 140 lbs, 32 DD, size 4/6 dress and I ordered the MEDIUM. This dress is far too big for me, it is falling off at the top and I will definitely be flashing people. I will have to get this altered, it is just too big all around. The quality of the material is nice, so I will probably be ordering in a different size and color. Also the dress I ordered is definitely RED and not maroon or burgundy. Oh well, you win some you lose some."
3.0,"Made well enough but it gets a lower rating because the pale pinkish color shown on the screen is misleading.  The descriptive words say 'ivory' and that is exactly what color the necklace is. There is absolutely NO pink or blush in this necklace, despite what the picture portrays."
3.0,Fit y Danner Mountain boot nicely. Decent cushion. Could use more arch support. They're very squeeky after a few weeks of use. Kind of embarrassing and annoying in the office.
3.0,"Way too much material!! I can almost wrap this dress around myself twice. I'm 5'9 and 130lbs, with a small frame. I bought the smallest size, and still it was way too big. I'm going to have it tailored to fit because it is a really cute dress. The wrap around ties are not very secure. One came off the first time I tried it on."
3.0,"I was expecting something the color shown but was surprised to pull out a shiny chrome card holder instead. The holder is nice, though. It's rounded, so more cards fit than you'd think. It opens easily and snaps closed securely. Inside, each side has elasticized cloth band to hold a small stack of business cards. Not a bad purchase overall.<br /><br />Update 12/18/2012: If you can get to Sam Moon, check there first. I just saw this exact card holder (compared it to the one I got on Amazon and carry around) for only $3.99"
3.0,"They are cute, pretty transparent, and could look orangish . A better price would be $7.99 for these."
3.0,"I've bought this product for ear protection in the shooting range. What I like about this product is the price, build quality and fast delivery by Amazon. What I don't like about it is the wearability comfort. After wearing about 2 hours, your sideburns/temple area really hurts. And there is no way to extend or adjust the headset. Not sure if it will get loosened up after a couple more uses."
3.0,"Much Smaller than it appears, but cute nonetheless.  In my humble opinion, This is perfect for a Girl as opposed to a GROWN Woman!"
3.0,"If you think you will get and even amount of colors, think again. I received more red than any other. What's the point of different colored bands if you don't have enough different ones to go around. Was under the assumption I would get an even amount of each.  From China, of course.  Fine otherwise."
3.0,Just doesn't seem to fit right.
3.0,"The ties come nicely packaged, and can be a gift as well. They are a bit narrower that I wanted, made out of polyester. One tie is blue, the other is pink stripe with silver threads in between."
3.0,"Buckle looks pretty good but since I just got it can't say anything about quality.  I'm not sure the belt itself is leather and at its smallest size could fit a size 4-6 no smaller than that. When I bought it the information  said  that it will have a tool to add holes if you needed it smaller but it was not in my package. I will decide later on if I will keep it mostly because I did like the buckle, otherwise I would be returning it right away because I don't like false information."
3.0,"It is slightly snug, but no so snug that I cannot pull it off.  Also the length is just a tad short for my comfort level at work, in an elem school.  It does not look as short when I wear black stockings because my white legs are not as visible, but too short for me to do something like bending over to put paper in the copier..even my 12 year son said, &#34;god mom, kinda short!&#34;"
3.0,Not very thick.
3.0,"I own shorts from this brand that I love, and I ordered the same size in. Apparently fabric choice matters, because the ""marbled"" fabric of my shorts is sturdy and this is thin...I can absolutely see through them when I bend over. They will be used as around the house leggings only...stay away for actual working out"
3.0,"This is a very pretty bra and appears to be made from quality fabrics and was the right size, but it didn't fit right. The supports in the sides bow outward instead of shaping your sides, which makes it feel too big. I like this bra except for that. I don't know what causes it, but likely poor construction or design. It could be that the design is only for those who don't have any need for stays or shaping in the first place. Not sure.  I had to return it."
3.0,"The quality and construction of this jacket is awesome. It is very structured and sharp looking.  This is the first time I found an xs that is so fitted on me.  I am in love with a jacket that does not fit exactly the way I want it to. I thought I was petite, my bust runs 30&#34; and this jacket is so fitted, it seems I might have to go up a size or two."
3.0,They look ok but cheap
3.0,"Nice but fabric has no stretch, order up at least 1 size. Returned"
3.0,not what I was expecting look cheap but nice love the blue color not been able to wear them yet
3.0,"I'm 5'8 150 lbs and I read reviews and ordered a L to be safe. It's still a little too short for me to wear to work. I ordered the grey-white and you definitely want to wear nude spanx & a bra with it. It's also barely noticeable, but the bottom of the dress doesn't seem to all be the same length. Aggravating, but again, not super noticeable. I've worned it out & about running errands & I felt super cute :)"
3.0,"Very difficult to set time and date so that i didn't bother to set the latter.  For the price, I'd just as soon get a Timex."
3.0,"Very cute set, the shorts fit high waist so they're very cheeky. The top runs small tho..Already washed the set & no tears or coming apart , letter embellishment stayed on as well through the wash. I'd buy again 👌"
3.0,This is so unflattering if you are not skinny or do not have a flat stomach. It’s basically a stretchy fitted tank. There is no support and really no compression. I am 5’1 138 pounds. I am usually a small/medium. I got a small and glad I did. It rolls a little and if I got a bigger one it would roll more. I kept it because I am working out at home so I don’t care how I look. If I wouldn’t wear this to the gym because I would feel self conscious.
3.0,Nice but not the best quality.
3.0,"Loved the color, fits pretty snug, rides up a little while working out."
3.0,This looks and feels great but it's too small!
3.0,Not as long as pictured!!!!! Inseam measure measurements are wrong!!
3.0,"Nice hat, but it did not fit my 22 inch head. The length of hat was sticking straight up. Not too attractive."
3.0,They work. Not sure how many uses I will get before the sticky wears off. Im a 38 D and they supported me when I used them as a “push up”. Now I use them as basically pasties when I want to take a break from a bra but too cold for nothing....😉
3.0,Doesn't stay on my ear. Very cute though.
3.0,runs small thick girls don't even bother
3.0,Sound is great but the it doesn't have any range
3.0,"I don't like the fabric that so many of the gloves are using now, it's snags so easily, your hands tend to sweat more that fabric does not absorb.  The gloves are sized wrong I went exactly by what they said and I regret it they  are too big so I'd order a size down freon what they recommend unless you don't mind your hands slipping strong.  I like mine snug.  If you don't mind that fabric on top ...that silky fabric it just does not hold up it's so easy to snag."
3.0,"Came early, bought for a guy. He hasn't tried them on yet but he really enjoyed them."
3.0,Loved this shoe for my daughter only problem I have it the glitter comes right off
3.0,"I would have liked to have received what I ordered, two pairs, not one."
3.0,I thought I had order these in 2.0 lens but obviously once I put them on clearly not bi-focal.  Useable but I have to carry a pair of bifocal glasses with me.
3.0,"I usually wear women's/junior's size 9-11 socks, and these were a bit tight, especially at the top. Also, the synthetic fabric it is made of is not breathable. Ok for fall, winter, and early spring, I expect. I will be donating at least the nomaj pair because they really are uncomfortable."
3.0,"Cute shirt, but not the greatest quality. The material is extremely thin, and the length could have been just a bit longer. I purchase two; one had holes all through it after washing, the other snagged on the slightest thing and developed pulls. If you're only intending on wearing this to the gym or for running, you should be good, but just know if you plan to wear it out, it will begin to look dingy rather quickly."
3.0,The delivery was delayed for unknown reason.<br />The most disappointed was that one the lenses have a spot or scratch on it.<br />If I will return the product it will cost more than I paid for the glasses. I am not 100% satisfied.
3.0,My daughter is 8yo and wears a girls size 1. I purchased a 2.5/3 ad the fit was good.  She found them to be quite comfy.<br />Purchased just one month ago and they have already torn. Very disappointed in the short lifespan.
3.0,"Tablecloth is okay, but a little thinner than I wanted.  I hadn't expected the subtle stripes and really don't like them very much  However, the cloth is usable for casual use. I haven't washed it yet- not sure how it will hold up."
3.0,"It fit okay, and the sew they fine, I do not like the bow tie around a bow too big like a ball not flat down and glue outside a ball I try clean but not come out, when I wear it bothering me. Other companies they sewed flat down so when you wearing you don't know it there. And don't like my head shipping in a plastic bag."
3.0,"Usually this size fits great, but the seam that is supposed to be below the breasts wants to ride up onto the breasts. The material  makes the top look like a cheap dollar store top instead of sexy. I do like the cut and the scarf type style of the hem though. That is what kept me from shipping this back for credit and rating this top a 1-star."
3.0,"This is nice enough for the cheap amount I paid for it.  It gives off a REALLY STRONG ODOR that almost made me return it.  Don't know what this smell is and if it is toxic or not, but it is a highly stinky chemical smell.  I had to go to the internet to find out how to get rid of the smell!  Other than that is nice.  I was really impressed with the heavy duty zipper!  Lots of room, I have a small case on my iPhone but it still fits inside (snuggly).  I am going to test to see if RIFD protection really works (using my work badge ID).  If it passes, I will change my review to higher stars."
3.0,"This dress is cute for one wear. The material is soft to touch. However, midway through the day, I noticed that the  material started to wear out and  fuzz up right in certain areas. I was bummed because I liked the overall style."
3.0,I ordered a larger after reading reviews here that this runs small. And it does. I wish it were just a tad bigger.  So make sure on the size you want.
3.0,Cute but way too short through the torso and I don’t even have a long torso.
3.0,"I love the wording and picture, but it's a really bulky fabric and doesn't move easily. I only wear it for &#34;fun scrub fridays&#34;. I wish it were softer and had a fit for women. Very boxy. But I get a lot of laughs and compliments on it."
3.0,"The zipper gets stuck a lot on the fuzz, but it’s super warm and looks great"
3.0,"Don't buy this if you're looking for heat. Buy this however, if you need a good rain coat. So far, what I wanted it for, was not what I got, which was to be as similar as my old heat insulated jacket."
3.0,RTA 4/3
3.0,This did not fit well! It was not flattering for curves.
3.0,I like it but it runs small.
3.0,I have a difficult time driving at night especially when it is raining. They don't illuminate the roads for a while here and the Pacific Northwest. I was hoping it would help reduce glare but it really does not do that much for that.
3.0,"This is great for photo booth prop, but runs really small. The XL should really be a small."
3.0,This was a beautiful dress. I felt that there was too much cotton in the material and it would stretch with every wash. It need a bit more lycra.  I returned it just to be safe. It didn't want it to keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
3.0,The hat was too small. The sound was ok.
3.0,"Great fit and very comfortable. My only dislike is how the cut is in the front, I thought dress was long all the way around."
3.0,"I bought these in white. I thought the style was nice and the fit was fine, too.However, the material was way too lightweight/see through for me. Returned for that reason."
3.0,"too big but cute - my fav is the case , i just wish the glasses didnt fall off my face ... i have a pretty big head if i might say myself haha"
3.0,"Great Design, and quality. Runs very large, best for true plus size, taller person. Odd cut! Bggy shoulders, arm holes and sleeve too wide, give a dowdy look. Too bad, it's a beautiful coat."
3.0,Very pretty charm but it fell off twice and I had to change the small ring that connected it to the key ring.
3.0,"I love the sparkly pink, but the band was a bit difficult to fit to my watch (maybe off by 1mm or so). It's also not good to wear around anything that will catch on it (like sweaters or knits), and the edges are scratchy on the wrist at times."
3.0,"The material is incredibly cheap-feeling. It's like a spandex material. And it's hard to &#34;fluff up&#34; so to speak, it just looks like a skimpy piece of cloth hanging around my neck. I'm very disappointed."
3.0,Comfortable but ripped on the 1at day ... Disappointed
3.0,"This feels more like paper, not my idea of 100% cotton.  Shirt is not badly put together, but the material is just not what I wanted.  Stiff, not breathable like cotton is supposed to be.  I'll wear it for a while, then probably donate it away when the short sleeve shirts come out."
3.0,The back bubbles up
3.0,Wished it fit better
3.0,Sometimes I have trouble getting it to stay on. One of them came with so much glue oozing out of it that I can’t wear it without cutting my ear.
3.0,"The wrong size arrived. Otherwise they look nice, I just can’t wear them"
3.0,These are very soft leggings and super cute but the waistband is at an odd place and they fit super small and very low cut.
3.0,"This review is for the girlies that fall within my shape✨<br />I’m 5’3 273lbs , I purchased size 2XL the pants fit super cute , I’m on the shorter side so the pants are longer but fits cutely. However the jacket fits like a XL:"
3.0,So tight! I'm normally a large in everything and these are skin tight on me. I recommend getting a larger size.
3.0,"really had to get on. once they are on they feel great. really comfortable actually. I got them to go with my Japanese dickies. thats the only time i wear them. would rather if the sole was black but they are cool.<br />If you are looking for comfort they are good for that, just really sucks getting into them."
3.0,"I love the legs, but the waistline is to high. I have a high waistline, but I still have to roll the waist 2 or 3 times! Very out of poportion"
3.0,It fits well the color is more mustard. The outer layer is more like sunflower yellow. Nice top and it fits well. I just like it.
3.0,"Okay, so this is adorable, and I had to select how it fit from the options above but really the suit as a whole is NOT too small...however the CUP size which is of utmost importance is about an A cup maybe a small B...I am a DD cup and anticipating this problem ordered the extra large which made the whole suit a little big but the CUP SIZE seemed like it did not get larger. It took significant reworking with my sewing machine to make this a workable, wearable bathing suit. Color and design were as described and gorgeous. I ripped the cups out and installed a shelf bra with a center stitch seam which fixed the bra cup problem and some extra darts which fixed the general size problem. Lots of compliments on the suit afterwards though!"
3.0,its ight
3.0,I love the photo on the shirt but the sizing is bad... one wash and it became a small
3.0,Way more cream than white
3.0,The skirt fits good The top runs small other than that the outfit is cute
3.0,Smaller than the picture makes you believe.
3.0,"I don't know what this is, since they never used the word ""vinyl"", but I can tell you what it isn't.  It isn't cotton or linen or anything like a true cloth fabric.  They are stiff and heavy and I don't expect to be able to machine wash them.  They are definitely waterproof. They should work to protect my clothing from water or other substances,  but they are not what I expected."
3.0,"It's my size, but it doesn't fit. Too tight across too of dress and it's too short, due to the tightness."
3.0,I loved my first pair of knock around.  This pair arrived with a large scratch on the lense.  Very disappointed.
3.0,These are ok...nothing great!
3.0,If I ordered again I would or a size larger.  They seem to run a bit small.  The qualms marginal but it was inexpensive.  I’ll have to see how it wears over time.
3.0,"I'm gonna have to give it 3 stars because the item did look how it said it would and it was packaged safely but unfortunately mine won't undo so I can even use it. It's stuck. I tried, my brother tried, and we even asked my friends boyfriend to try and separate the two pieces. I don't think even if we got it undone I would wear at this point. I'm too worried I wouldn't be able to remove it."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this wallet. It’s beautiful.  But I actually needed all of those credit card slots.  And the truth is, as soon as you put in one card, the adjacent slots become unusable, because you can’t take them back out. So I can have exactly 3 cards in this wallet. That doesn’t work for me. I also allowed myself to believe that my iPhone 6 Plus would fit in this wallet, per the photos. I can slip it in, but then I can’t fold the top over and close the wallet. Leaving out the phone, I can either have cash or a comb. Not both, if I expect the wallet to close. So it’s sortof like Windows Vista - very pretty, but just barely functional, suggesting lots of capability it can’t deliver. I’m disappointed."
3.0,"Unflattering cut on my 5'3&#34; 125lb frame. I looked boxy as it didn't hug my curves at all. Maybe if I had ordered a smaller size it would've been fine, as the fabric is very very stretchy! I bought this to use as part of a costume, so I'm going to do some alterations to it to make it more form-fitting. Otherwise, color and length as described and satisfied with purchase."
3.0,It's a little tight but I can still wear it as a headband. It's not stretchy at all.  I love the design though.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress. First, it feels heavy, like wool-ish. It was also a bit itchy. The seam hit me higher than in the picture. More like an empire waist, which was not flattering on me. I like that it has pockets. I say give it a try. Every body is different. My body just may not be right for it. You really won't know until you try it on."
3.0,You get what you pay for. Cute for kids not so much for adults.
3.0,"Nice pants, but they were too small"
3.0,"This product is very nice for workout,or just a comfy day out.. one thing i did notice it need to be better sewn from inside because it opened up after second use. But other than that i feel its true to size and good quality."
3.0,"I am 5 ft 125 lbs, kind of short and a bit tight."
3.0,"Huge.<br />Ordered Asian 4xl recieved US 6xl.<br />1st, last and only time you'll hear this from me:<br />Order your regular size or size down 1 for Asian size.<br />Graphics suck.Not crisp. A bit fuzzy.<br />In spite of all that, it's comfortable so I kept it."
3.0,In the pictures the chain looks small but the links are larger than they look in the pictures. Also the diamond made the chain look even cheaper.
3.0,hard to put on at first. then one pair just only stayed lighted up for 2 hours..=[
3.0,"It's a watch...unique design, but it isn't a flowing set of hands.  Instead it's a painted wheel that spins..."
3.0,"I bought 2, One Medium and one small.<br /><br />The Touch screen function on the small does not work at all. And for some reason the fingers length on the small are really large I think they are equal of the medium size. I am going to return the small size.<br /><br />The touch functionality of the medium size works ok I gave this as a gift."
3.0,"I specifically bought these masks because I wanted an adjustable strap:<br />""[MHCare] Adjustable Strap KF94 Safety Face Mask, 10PCS individually packaged -Adult -White<br />Brand: PS KOREA""<br />They seem comfortable for now, but they do NOT have an adjustable strap despite their similar appearance to masks with an adjustable strap."
3.0,"Let me say that I love this dress. Super cute and fit perfect. I’m 5’7 and about 190lbs, I ordered a large. Dress was true to size as I usually wear a size 12. BUT the belt was not included as shown in the picture and the dress smells like bad body oder. Almost as someone had purchased it, wore out our for a night and returned it without washing. I will wash your see if I can get rid of the smell but otherwise it’s a great dress!"
3.0,Very cute and nice material. I normally wear a size small-medium. I got a medium but I should have got a large
3.0,I order a size 9 as that’s my normal size in shoes. These boots run large thoughout th bottom and around the ankle. Even with lacing them all the way as tight as they go they are still way too loose/large.<br />To top that I thought I was ordering the all black but wasn’t until I ordered that I realized some how the green/black ones were ordered.  They came in a plastic bag within a plastic packaging bag which I thought was a little weird. Kinda was expecting a shoe box.<br />They seem like they would be good for inspection but not for every day wear as there is really no cushion or support in them. But again you get what you pay for and could always use some boot inserts.
3.0,Don't buy! Take forever to get and break on first day. They are super cute but clasp and connections just do not hold up. I got several in different styles and all have same problem. The joints or jewelry not rope or twine whatever it is made of just don't stay together. I got everyone and believe me I wanted to believe they would be ok but nope. So cute but not for only one day!
3.0,super cute but the piece that holds the remaining band in place so it doesn't stick out while wearing it fell off and was lost right out of the package. I still wear it because it's so cute.
3.0,"Colors, variety, and number are good: lots of cheap socks from which to choose in the AM. The striped/non-solid colors are poorly made, with lots of threads hanging around inside on which toes can catch. Eh. Not a great purchase, but the darn things are durable and already in the closet, so...."
3.0,Definitely Asian sizing.  They are cute and my daughter loves them.  Not sure how well they will<br />Hold up.  Took about 2 months to get<br />Them.
3.0,This is a really nice design but the material is thinner than it looks in the photos and it gets wrinkles from being folded which still haven't come out. I can't recommend this as a nice costume piece or for wearing around town because of the wrinkles and then it doesn't hold its shape well because it's too thin. Good luck in your search.
3.0,Ships from China so expect longer shipping times. My daughter is 5. Gloves barely reach her elbows and were really tight.
3.0,Bagginess is minimal.
3.0,the helmet itself would get 10/10. But the vents where the air blow's from (for me) seem to always blow around my chin. after a few minutes it fees like a wind burn. the vents are rotary so you can slightly change where the air blows but for me it's all ways the chin area and makes it in un-comfortable.
3.0,"The only issue I have with this bracelet, which was a gift for my wife, is that the clasp is somewhat flimsy."
3.0,"I bought the shirt for my husband.  After the first wash, the shirt shrunk significantly and is too small for him to wear.  It is now a night shirt for me."
3.0,It was too small...but decided to keep it to gift to my daughter for her birthday. It is is very pretty and wish it was true to size.
3.0,Fabric is amazing. However I am 5’4 and it goes around my calf food.
3.0,"This does NOT have a liner. Maybe in other colors, but in black it does not. Really disappointed considering the description assures you that it is lined. The black fabric is very soft, but also fairly sheer. So thin that standing in front of my mirror, I can see the outline of my thighs through the dress.<br /><br />Will also add that I ordered a large and it fits more like a medium. I’m 5’5”, 140lbs and there wasn’t much room in the chest area."
3.0,"The product shown has a distinctive multi colored thread pattern, labeled graphic. The delivered product is a solid grey. A product improvement recommendation would be to taper the end for ease of threading through belt loops."
3.0,Wasnt as large as i thought..but its ok
3.0,Super cute but if you have sort of a big butt it is QUITE short. I’m 5’7 and 165lb and got a large and it fits perfect but yes if I lift my arms up the bottom of my butt will hang out. Definitely won’t be having more than 2 drinks when wearing this dress.
3.0,"Pretty nice... but the slit came up way too high, especially considering it's in the front. Can we say inappropriate?!"
3.0,"Las gafas estan OK, pero la banda elástica es muy corta. Pueden resolver esta situación?"
3.0,Didn't fit as well as expected
3.0,It is very scratchy so not comfortable to sleep in
3.0,The fit was true to size and the material is very soft...I like it..
3.0,Looks good but it's cheaply made.  If you need a costume piece thus will work well but don't expect it to be a piece you'll wear more than once
3.0,These straps are hardy and fashionable but I have had them slide off my eyeglasses occasionally so my glasses are hanging on with one strap.
3.0,"The top runs a little small, but the bottoms are ample. I like the feel of the fabric. I haven’t washed them yet. I hope they wash well."
3.0,"At this point, I've probably spent more in replacement watch bands than I did purchasing the Forerunner 15. I started with Garmin replacement bands, then went to off brands to save money. The fit of these bands to the actual watch is comical. The material that fits against the watch is too big, the curve of the plastic enforcement for the fit is not the same curve as the watch. It is a fight to get the pin through the band, watch, and back through the band. I had to take a rasp and file the small insert piece (that fits in the interior of the watch connection) for it to fit. When you finally do get the pin through, it still doesn't look like it fits right. I gave 3 stars because it is functionally holding my watch to my wrist. Also, at this point -having replaced the watch band probably 6 times - I'm convinced the problem lies in the watch face design by Garmin. This is probably my last band replacement before I just go for a different watch with a different design. TL:DR - It works, if you're willing to make it work, and for the price, it's worth it."
3.0,"It’s what I was looking for in size and organization, but it had a bad chemical smell that took some time and cleaning to make this useful. But it does seem good quality."
3.0,Love this necklace! Wore it once and it broke. Very disappointing.
3.0,My daughter is always a size 7 and this size 7 did not fit her.
3.0,It is good quality. I have washed it a few times and it still looks new. My only problem is that it is too big for my face.
3.0,I really like these pants and have them in multiple colors.. including multiple colors of the same color model. Colors are very inconsistent. Length.. inconsistent. Leg taper.. inconsistent...  Great pants and super comfy.. just crazy inconsistent.
3.0,Purple appearing color looks nothing like actual  product .
3.0,I liked the style but the detail on the sides are just not my style.
3.0,Material rough and has no give
3.0,Cute ring however mine looked more like Rose Gold than the Yellow I had anticipated.
3.0,"It fits well and was easy to install. It began to turn colors the first week my husband had it. The black is rubbing off showing a silverfish black underneath. It’s not really noticeable until he points it out. He also said that it’s kind of heavy compared to the original band. It’s a dressier band, but it started looking old quick."
3.0,I could have sized down to an XS but I kind of liked the loose fit with leggings. I returned this because I thought it was too wrinkly and the sewing did not look very good so I was worried it would unravel. I saw similar shirts at TJMAXX for half the price that seemed better quality but the fit was not as good. :/
3.0,"Perfectly fine for working out, or an undershirt, but I wouldn’t consider this a compression top by any stretch of the imagination."
3.0,"I bought for stage use. (I do a lot of Shakespeare.)  I t wouldn't stand up to every day street use. Definitely a costume piece, but good for what it is."
3.0,"Wonderfully cute, but arms are very tight. Had to cut them on the underside to have more room. Don’t order if your arms are large. Love the rest of it"
3.0,Too tight. Lace itchy
3.0,"I love hats.  I was excited to get this one because I loved the darker brown color.  Upon taking it out of the box, it was all smashed up!  And this hat feels like it is made of some sort of light plastic.  I have yet to get the hat in a presentable shape to wear.  It does have a felt feel on the outside but it's definitely not wool!!  The contents show it's  65% cotton and 35% polyester.  It has ribbon inside to tighten it.  I feel it runs somewhat small.  It's tight on my head without pulling up the ribbons.  The band around the brim is an imitation leather.  It's so bent up I couldn't straighten it.  It would have to be glued down to make it presentable.  I am very disappointed in this hat.  I don't think I will ever  wear it.  I will keep trying other things to see if I can get the dents out.  But for the time being, it's not wearable.  I'm not sure if this is the fault of the seller or Amazon shipping.  It just needs to be packaged better to keep it's shape.  I would definitely never think of traveling with this hat.  It just can't withstand packing."
3.0,"First off, the size of the shirt was spot on.  I'm an XXL and this fit perfectly.  It was nice to wear and it had a great feel to the fabric.  The style and design of the shirt are top notch and I enjoyed how it felt when wearing it.<br /><br />Yesterday, I washed the shirt for the 2nd time and hung it up to dry.  After it dried, I noticed that it has started to not look very nice.  The fabric now looks a bit rougher and more used than I expected for 2 washes.  I'm concerned that the fabric is starting to fail."
3.0,"Very pretty but I have had it 10 days today and the color is already coming 🙁 also I have small wrists I took out links but its still too big, if I take another likn out it will be too small so I have been wearing it a little big....I really like the design but quite frankly I would notice this purchase again 😐"
3.0,Beautiful earrings but heavy.
3.0,"These are well made but have no stretch.<br />If your arms are not skinny, this will be snug."
3.0,"100% viscose, machine washable, fits great.  Very casual dress.  Pretty lace hem detail, looks so feminine.<br />However the lace detail is what makes for a problem with this one for me.<br />It simply makes it a little too much for a dress to wear outside the house.<br />This one just became a nightgown for me."
3.0,way to small in the arms
3.0,I bought these and they are super cute but the nose piece was broken when I got them. I hate dealing with returns so I’ll just replace the nose piece but it’s annooying
3.0,"This is advertised as &#34;flowy&#34; but fits tight in the bust and stomach.<br />However, other medium &#34;flowy&#34; tops fit my mom perfectly.<br />This top is more like a t-shirt with sits up the sides and more suitable for a thin person."
3.0,"These pajamas are well priced, and they look great. While they aren't cotton, they are still comfortable and look nice. They fit well everywhere for theost part, except for the sleeves.  The sleeves were short on on all four sizes I ordered. A bit odd, but otherwise okay."
3.0,"I was hoping for a pendant that was larger and more substantial  This is a pretty necklace, but is quite delicate.  I wish the cite include the size in inces.  However, for the sale price the necklace was adequate, jut not what I was hoping for."
3.0,Not as thick as I would like— fits/ looks more like a rashgaurd for swimming. No thumbs holes if that’s important to you.
3.0,These are really cute but the bar is too small. Size of a eye brow bar.
3.0,"I was really excited about getting these slippers, but they were disappointing.  They were very hard and the arch support was too far back.  Very odd.  It hurt just try them on and taking a few steps.  Returning them.  I need slippers with arch support so ill keep looking."
3.0,Love the way they hold things in place but do not love the bottom half of the garment continually rolling up.
3.0,"part of the phis logo is cut off. More comfortable without filters, more difficult to breath with them. Adjustable straps are nice."
3.0,I love this dress. The great thing I love about it is how stretchy the fabric is. The only thing I did not realize was where the see threw fabric is the sewing stitches shows. If I would of known about it I would of bought double sided tape.
3.0,"This tie works for me.  In my line of work, I do not wear ties a lot, however, when I do, I want to make sure I look my best in suits and ties complement the suit.  There is one suit jacket I have that currently I have only been able to wear a solid black tie with.  This tie works well with it, so now I can wear this suit jacket more often.  I even received a compliment when wearing it.  The tie is very soft and easy to tie in a knot.  My only downside is that the satin-like material is a little too shiny for my taste.  If you like that, then this is the perfect tie for you. I am making this review as I received the product at a discount to make an honest review."
3.0,"True to size, but be careful drying mine seems to hv shrunk still wearable obviously tighter"
3.0,"If you want a large order an xl, the only thing is the length will be long like an xl, but fit like a large. Nice shirt otherwise."
3.0,Beautiful earrings but the thred seems to be messed up on one of the backs that make it screw on.
3.0,"The flowers are not pinkish as the picture shows but more orange which are not ""my colors"". The material is thicker so it's not as see through but it' too thick to be comfortable in hot summer days. I felt like the knot in front did not hide my belly but rather accentuated it. I tried sending it back but ran into so many hurdles I ran out of time so I guess I'll have to see how I can make it work"
3.0,Card slots to short for cards I gave it away
3.0,"I ordered these leggings in my usual size large and while I can get them on they just keep falling below my stomach. I would never be able to workout in these leggings as I can't even walk around without worrying they are showing a little too much of me. To be fair though my problem area is my stomach for sure as that's where most of my weight seems to go.  Now whether or not you could go up a size and not have the falling down issue, I really am not sure.  It's a shame because otherwise the leggings are well constructed.  The seams are good and after washing on the delicate cycle in cold water and letting them air dry, there were no further issues with construction."
3.0,Love the pattern but the colors faded after the first wash.
3.0,My son loves this necklace and he was happy that it was better than expected. The necklace chain broke after just receiving it but my son found another chain to use
3.0,It was smaller than I expected. I returned it
3.0,They are tiny and the backs are like soft plastic and they don’t stay on.
3.0,Loved the cross  It was perfect. The chain was terrible  awful. Ended up buying new silver chain for cross. Wpuld not recomend
3.0,"I really liked this sweater. It feels amazing and it so comfortable and versatile. But about 2 weeks after I purchased it the buttons started breaking off. And I don't mean falling off from poor stitching, I mean the button broke apart and I had to pick out broken pieces from the stitching. I like this sweater so much that I'll probably just take the rest of the buttons off and sew some different ones on."
3.0,"The thin wire was uncomfortable and it doomed outward. The ring seemed to run a little large which may have caused it to feel too cumbersome. The weight of silver is very light for this ring. I sent it back due to being too big, uncomfortable and the wire is too delicate to handle my wear and tear. The return was easy and shipping was fast."
3.0,"For the price, I can't complain too much. I've had the band for 5 months now and it has held up well, except for the color. Bought a Rose Gold band but now it just looks like a dark dingy gold color. All the rose color is gone. But it still works well otherwise."
3.0,"Good strap, except it isn't long enough for my 8.5 inch wrist. I added extra holes to try and make it work but it's less then ideal as the extra tab isn't long enough to stay flush now.<br /><br />Really pretty blue color, and seems durable, I just wish it was longer."
3.0,"I usually wear either a small or medium depending on the fit. The medium was a bit snug in the torso at first, but the fabric stretches out. These tanks are incredibly long, ideal for layering, and for covering up your tush when wearing leggings. I bought these because I absolutley LOVE the texture and feel of VIV leggings. However, while comfy, the material is not exactly the same as the leggings. Bummer."
3.0,"It's pretty ok, so just wear some shapeware under it because you can see through it right out of the packaging. Once you get it over your hips you're going to be real mad if you don't have shapeware to go with it. (If you don't know what I mean then let it slide, i'm talking to the big girls) The material actually feels silky rather than scratchy. The belt is not plus size, it's clearly one size and they ship with all sizes. The photo is so you can see how long it is with no shoes. I'm 5'4 so this is a pretty good length with the shoes I wear."
3.0,"This is a nice sundress, great fabric, but the sizing runs small.  I typically order an XL, but this XL is not an XL.  My advice is to order at least one size up."
3.0,Not what I expected. There is no draw to adjust the waist for a better fit. The length is shorter than expected but the quality is good.
3.0,Nice dress for the price. Real comfy.
3.0,The design is different and fun; the fabric is shiny. The fit is more snug than typical but they are a fun addition for layering.
3.0,Nice but needed a larger size
3.0,"Its a pretty dress no doubt and it fits me really well in every aspect except my arms. I am 5'2 and 145 pounds. I am a 36DD and surprisingly it fits in my chest , however I have rather large biceps and it fits very tightly on them there is no stretch or give at all."
3.0,"Feels like cotton, for a 6'2.5&#34; man the XXL is slightly too short"
3.0,Material soft. Great for after five
3.0,Not one size fits all
3.0,Nothing really awesome about it
3.0,One of the stones came off from the necklace set. Also it has rope instead of chain at the back. Not really impressed with the quality of the product.  Too expensive.
3.0,"I gave it a three because they are nice, but I would call these women's glasses so they don't work for me.  The frames are larger than they appear in the pictures but if you have a rounder face they might work for you.  I will definitely buy this brand I just need to get some that fit better."
3.0,"Item was received sooner than I expected, which is great.  Looks fun, and fits well.  Easily adjustable to fit large or small wrist. Only complaint is that the clasp was broken when I took it out of the package.  It is easy enough to fix.  I bought (3) bracelets, all similar and (2) were broken.  Be advised, you get what you pay for!"
3.0,The top was too small for my boobies the bottom fit ok.
3.0,"My daughter asked me for these and they never stayed secure enough for her to wear comfortably. They’re pretty for sure, and great for quick photos, but not something that can be worn all day."
3.0,It looks good buy not for a Woman..
3.0,Fits WAY small.  I absolutely LOVE the design though.  The set was an XL.  I'm a size 10 and I thought it would work.  The top was super small for my chest (D) and rode up in the back - looked weird.
3.0,This suit is very cute and for the right proportions would be great. I'm 5'7&#34; about 130 lbs. I read reviews and sized up to medium. The bottoms fit well but the top was too loose for my 34b. It looked ok when I tried it on but I'm positive it would've been a disaster in water. Didn't work for me since it's not adjustable and the design is such that it would be difficult to make alterations on. Too bad you can't choose size of top separately.
3.0,"They feel quite nice, and the designs are fantastic. my only gripe is that the ear strings are too short or something, so the mask will slowly drift up and get into your eyes so i find myself pulling it down a lot and i dont like touching my mask."
3.0,"Right out of the packaging I thought this is a great looking bracelet, then after I wore it for the first time for an entire night out, I saw the blue stains on my wrist and then I recall having read someone else’s review saying the same thing.  So it’s true, these beads seem to be dyed instead of them them being real lapis lazuli beads....I wore it in the shower next day to wash off the excess dye and it seems to be fine now, no more staining my skin.  We get what we paid for I suppose!  The design still looks great though."
3.0,"Unfortunately, the picture shows this tie as much brighter than it really is. It's lovely, and he'll wear it, but I purchased it to match a dress and it doesn't."
3.0,It’s super small. I love it and think it’s really cute but not what I expected.
3.0,didnt come with backings
3.0,Nice shirt with a nice feel but smaller than expected
3.0,It is obviously stamped metal but still decent for the price
3.0,was too hot for every day
3.0,Its very tight around my neck
3.0,My High School age daughter loves Harry Potter so I thought she would love this bag. She does love the design but only after using it for three days there is a small tear where the strap connects to the bag.<br />She does carry a lot of stuff though so it would be a great bag if it wasn't carrying too much weight.
3.0,"This is cute, but a little see-through."
3.0,"Fabric was quite wrinkly out of the package. Don't look forward to ironing this while on a beach vacation.<br /><br />Waist is elastic with a sash to stretch the bunching out, works well for different sizes. Length was great, I'm 5'6. Bottom half is very very sheer."
3.0,I am size large and I got the t shirts size medium so we’ll fit me tight . But I notice it look like a large not tight enough to give me any support. I am not happy with this product at all
3.0,"Very cute but had a very strong unpleasant odor. You'll need to let it air out, or place it back in the bag with a dryer sheet :) before wearing.<br />I returned mine due to the color being darker than I thought it would be. It was hard to buckle as well."
3.0,I sent this back… the color and style was great. Fabric wasnt as good as some other sellers on Amazon. I did but a lot of these this year . Do love them to layer
3.0,Glow squares are falling off after a few weeks.
3.0,The pattern is pretty but the elastic is very tight....
3.0,"These glasses sounded interesting... tinted reading glasses aren't something I see everyday. However, the magnification part is only at the very bottom of the glasses, where there is no tint. So if you're, say, on the beach reading, and you want to protect your eyes from the bright white page, then these glasses don't deliver. You're going to be looking through the untinted part.<br /><br />So I can't quite understand how these are going to be useful. Perhaps in the car, when you want sunglasses for the outside, and the untinted part for reading while you drive. Or something.<br /><br />The glasses themselves seem fine. They are light and a little delicate and look nice on the face. They come with a soft carrying case. Overall, the quality and the price seem to match.<br /><br />Ultimately, these do not solve the problem of needing reading glasses in bright light. Instead, they just allow your pupils to dilate a bit from the dark, top part, while too-bright light still floods in from where you are actually looking when you read."
3.0,"These glasses kept bouncing and sliding  off of my nose while running. I had to keep pushing them up and I could definitely feel these on my nose. There was also quite a bit of glare from behind due to the shape.<br /><br />This could all be because of my face shape. Some people seem to love these! Sunglasses are very personal! I will go back to my not-as-cute, but functional running glasses and save these for occasions where I’m sitting around!"
3.0,"Design of earrings is great, but much smaller than I thought!"
3.0,"I ordered this set for my mom and it was way too big & too long for her 5', 120 lb. frame. She'd lost weight since my last visit. It's cute enough though. I have no complaints other than choosing the wrong size. Maybe I can find a home for it."
3.0,One of the handles came off after a few months use. Can still use the strap but still shouldn't be coming apart so soon.
3.0,"I thought this was a beautiful anklet but by the third day one of the 3 chains broke off, I squeezed the end piece and put it back together by the next day another chain came of then the entire thing fell apart. I wish the three pieces were soldered together. It would have been a beautiful piece."
3.0,Love the shirt but I was expecting the lower part to be a little looser or hang better
3.0,"Bought a XXXL: Seems to be two sizes to small, because I wear XXXL and can fit XXL comfortably, Sadly, this fit's like a XL. Well, I'm in the process of losing weight, so this will be another goal, to fit this."
3.0,Runs small in chest area
3.0,Big umbrella enough for you not getting wet
3.0,"This is a very nice belt with one near-fatal flaw - the elastic in the black braided material is tight initially and then stretches and stretches until the belt is one size too big and is so loose at the last hole left that it won't hold your pants up.  And then if you get the next smaller size belt, the elastic is very tight initially, even on the loosest first hole, and so you have to endure this until the thing stretches and loosens up.  I started with a Large (waist size 42), now have gone to a Medium, which is too tight, enough to make it uncomfortable to eat while wearing this belt.  I think I may do a little pre-stretching on the Medium belt to fix this problem.  Will follow up as this belt wears over a year or so."
3.0,"It came like it was already used. Just jumbled up in a dusty bag. The zipper was also broken. Due to the fact I had no plan B and had rushed shipping this item, I had no choice but to rig the zipper and wear it. It was cute, the fit was great, it was just not delivered to me in a quality manner at all."
3.0,"Cute earrings, but tassels fall off!"
3.0,Well I bought this to wear under an open sweater just a loose tank top that’s showed good front and side clevage. WELL the front “straps” barely covered my nipples.. lol I guess that’s why I shouldn’t buy a men’s shirt for a curvy body
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and 121 lb. Waist = 25 inch<br />Hips = 31 inch. I got a small at first and I couldn't get it over my butt. So I returned it and got a medium. It fits just right! I got a big butt and thick thighs for my small frame so getting pants that fit me are difficult. They are soft, comfy, and the rise doesn't cut into my stomach when I sit.<br />Now problems<br />The only problem I have with these is as soon as I pulled them up the belt loop in the back snapped at my tug. It's an easy fix because I see but it is a tad annoying to just get it and something to break at the first tug.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I fixed the loop and then soon after another loop broke! The last picture is the second one that broke. Broke at work so I couldn't sew it at the time. Stitching on this is poor, that's for sure. I also put them through the wash on a cold delicate wash and put on an air dry tumble and they shrunk"
3.0,It didn't fit well
3.0,Material was very thin - thinner than tshirt material
3.0,just not great but okay
3.0,"Not seamless, have seam up the inner length, and the crotch thing like underwear, built like tights, ripped the butt when I sat on my feet, loos around the ankles."
3.0,"Pretty, but thin.  Not sure how these will hold up."
3.0,"Not as well constructed as more expensive brands - material is thinner, seams aren't reinforced.  For the price though, they work."
3.0,"I'm 5' so I rdered a size small. Had the arms altered to fit my size. Also, the shoulder/neckline area was too big for me, so I altered the neckline as well to drop lower; this made the blouse appear more sophisticated and made me look taller with a lower neckline above the breast. Love the color and ruffles."
3.0,"They r nice, they display stones on the back, which is nice for short hair, r wearing ur hair up. Ect...kept them"
3.0,These are very comfortable.  They help with sweaty smelly feet. However they do not last. Maybe 10 good times wearing them. They rip very easily.  They keep ripping at the heel. At first I thought it was me so I bought them about 5 more times lol. But they just keep ripping. I find myself throwing more away and for the price it's not worth it
3.0,"Fits as expected, pretty shirt.<br />However, material is a little thin for my liking."
3.0,Material is very cheap but my son was happy to have his merchandise aneway.
3.0,"I was looking for something lightweight and breathable. Terry just too heavy for me. I was a little disappointed that it had gold piping on it, unlike the white pictured. Also, it felt quite roomy right out of the package but shrunk way more than it should have."
3.0,The dress fit as expected but I didn't like the seam down the back or the collar.  The seam down the back made it look cheap.  I think the collar should have been more of an &#34;slouchy off the shoulder&#34; type of collar.  It just wasn't wide enough.  Instead it was more like a scoop neck.  People suggested sizing down since the dress was so big. I instead went with a medium which is my normal size hoping the collar would wide enough to slouch over my shoulder and reach my ankles.  It reached my ankles but was not wide enough to slouch like I wanted it to.  I was able to pull it down off both shoulders which made it look better but I still was not satisfied. I really wanted the slouch look like the picture and I didn't like the seam down the back.  Sending it back. I really like the idea so I'm going to keep looking for the right one.
3.0,"Nice set for price, lite weigh material."
3.0,"they look nice, just very thin"
3.0,I guess after receiving 5 compliments on this Bubble necklace I should review it.  I bought it to complete one outfit but I have discovered it goes with many more. The chain is long enough that it fits over my head without having to open the small lobster clasp thus saving my fragile fingernails from tearing. I selected it just because I needed a chunky white necklace and I liked this one. Then I found out it is the latest fashion accessory! I don't always try to wear things that are currently 'hot' so this was an added benefit! Very happy with this purchase!<br />Addendum; after I wore this necklace twice the chain turned brown. I had to replace the chain with one I got at a craft store. I still love the necklace but too bad I had to repair it!!
3.0,"Fine costume but didn't fit at all. I'm 5'4 and 135lbs, ordered a medium.  Also, this fit like a top not a dress like I thought in the picture."
3.0,The colors are vibrant and the jacket fits nice. It’s a bummer that the lights didn’t work because that was the main reason for buying it.
3.0,i order 7.5 its kinda too tight for wild feet and bigger lega its tight but good quality boots i just wish i dont have bigger legs and wild feet its beautiful boots
3.0,Buy from a retailer. Came twisted up.
3.0,"Fitment was just off, should have payed more for a better product elsewhere."
3.0,"They were just too small for my liking so I sent them back. Looked pretty in person, however, and I loved all of the inclusions."
3.0,Bought these for my husband to walk the dogs during our southern winters temps 30s-50 F. His standard size medium fit as expected. His main complaint is that the touchscreen finger pads are thicker and don’t work as well on his phone screen as his former gloves (he plays a lot of Pokémon). This will not be an issue if you don’t prioritize optimal touch screen control.
3.0,"I love it, but it does run large. Usually wear a Large, but should have went with a medium. Oh well, it’s still going to serve it’s purpose! ;)"
3.0,it is pretty and soft but this runs small ladies... I wear a 12/14 size large so I bought a 14 and barley buttons...I cant wear anything bulky with it...order a size up if you plan to wear sweaters this winter
3.0,"Didn't really care for this romper. The flutter sleeves just didn't flatter me, but overall the romper fit nicely."
3.0,"Broke, also...darn it!"
3.0,This didn’t work for me. I didn’t realize it had a ruffle on the bottom or a tie at the neck. Also was shorter than expected.
3.0,"I loved the style and color, but the jersey fabric was extremely clingy. If you're thin and fit, it will be perfect for you. However, if you're busty and curvy, it's unflattering. It wasn't necessarily too tight, but it clung to my butt (could see my bra strap and panty lines) and somehow made my boobs look flatter (I'm a 36DDD). I REALLY wanted to like this dress, but it just didn't work."
3.0,"Beautiful, but much shorter than I expected."
3.0,The material does not look at all like photo.
3.0,Toe box too tight need to get two sizes larger for wide feet
3.0,"I didn't realize this shirt didn't button all the way up to close that v above the buttons in the decolletage. That's how I wanted to wear the shirt. The opening v just flapped down on me. On the model, it's up and smooth."
3.0,"...this is a nice looking watch, it arrived quickly, and keeps good time...however the thickness of the leather braid (too thick) and the end beads are just too big...when on the wrist the beads end up sitting on either side of the watch face, unfortunately, it's just too much bulk...i was prepared to buy this watch in different colors, but have decided against that..."
3.0,Lovely pearl design but bulky unflattering shape. I have to take it to a tailor.
3.0,Smaller than expected color fades when stretched.
3.0,"I attended an all white party and the dress came within two days :) The day of the event i put the dress on, however there was a small hole near my butt. I was super upset because I had to change my outfit and now I just wasted $20."
3.0,Was broken when arrived.  Very disappointed. I liked the design a lot
3.0,Nice quality.  I would order l/2 size larger than you normally wear
3.0,These fell apart very quickly.
3.0,Fits very small.  Difficult for larger busts and heathy curved bodies
3.0,"weird rouching on the underside of my breasts?<br />I returned it.. maybe its just me, but it didn't do me justice. The rest of the dress fit nice though."
3.0,"I love this top! It's soft and stretchy but my order was messed up, I ordered a small and the package says small but the tag says extra small, even the color on the package is wrong.. I tried it on hoping it may still fit but it was to tight around my boobs so now I have to go through the whole return process. I still want it and think it's worth it, I just want what I ordered. For reference I'm 5'1 and 130lbs the small would have been perfect!"
3.0,"Just received this watch and I'll review based on what I can see and feel. Looks are very nice. Weight is good. Band seems excellent. The movement? Time will tell, punn intended. The movement appears to be Chinese? Cant be sure. It's what you would expect from a relatively inexpensive watch. I don't believe it will work only on wrist arm movement. The self wind feature lacks smooth movement. I believe it will rely on manual winding.<br />I'll update in a few months."
3.0,"Cheaply made, most bracelets were “half designs “ like two different designs were printed on one bracelet"
3.0,It is too small. It was sized large for europe and medium us sizes
3.0,"Really soft and comfortable material. The material is thin and even in the black it's somewhat see through all over and very much so in the butt area, especially if you have a big butt. Any other lighter colors would be totally see through. It does stretch and the rouching on the sides looks nice. It hit me right below my knees. Overall I'm happy with this skirt and will keep it but I won't order another one because they're too thin and so none of the other colors would work for that reason.<br />I ordered a large and I'm 195# with 34&#34; waist and 45&#34; hips. It fit fine and was the right size."
3.0,"Nice quality but small around the neck, breast and arms area. Needed to be returned-."
3.0,"The wallet is just a shade too think to fit into another purse, such as a purse which one carries every day to work.  It would be fine if it were the only item to be carried."
3.0,"Not happy with this purchase. Very cheap looking. Pattern as in picture. For reference, I’m 5’8” 147 lbs and I ordered an S that fits fine."
3.0,"It didn’t work out for me, but I hope it does for you!"
3.0,It said red and the picture looks translucent but what I got is more red brown and very cloudy. Not the same as the picture.  I even tried to put in the sun and the light still cloudy. Very disappointing.
3.0,Orders 2 sizes up so it fit perfect. Only complaint is the suit is more of a dark gray and red. Suit is not black in any way
3.0,It becomes loose at the top from taking it off and putting it back on. The material is breathable and kept me warm when I was sledding in the snow.
3.0,Earrings and Necklace were great<br />Wrist bracelet were to small for a child Wrist. 😪
3.0,Nice earrings. Backings come loose easily so beware of losing them
3.0,I’m 5’4 and 118 and got x-small but still big used a belt
3.0,"Cheap, cheap-looking to me but my daughter likes it."
3.0,"Shirt looked great and fit as it should, but after the first wash, a button came off."
3.0,The material is too thin and the sewing isn’t great at all.
3.0,"The good: these pants are well-made, the pattern is lined up to be symmetrical, and the fabric feels very soft and stretchy.<br /><br />The bad: they are shown as mid-rise but were actually super high-rise on me, which is not what I wanted. I am 5'2"", but I bought size 8S, so I expected them to be proportioned to a shorter height in the torso. The thigh and knee area was too loose for skinny jeans, more like narrow slacks. But the bottom is more closely fitted. It's awkward. They're neither skinny jeans nor cigarette pants.  I'll be returning but might try a smaller size."
3.0,Picture in this case was deceiving just a lot bigger than we expected.  Not critiquing the product as bad they were just bigger than I wanted.
3.0,"It sucks to get them on, like really bad. But once its on its very cute."
3.0,The clasp doesn't stay shut. It keeps coming undone! It's very frustrating
3.0,I needed a black strap
3.0,These are nice and they are high but they are thin and the white ones are kinda see through. I like them for the price but will look into better quality ones in the future.
3.0,"Not quite as soft as I expected, but the fit is very good."
3.0,"Really like this light linen like hat, however,  there is no indication on the label or the hat that it is UPF 50 as advertised."
3.0,Larger than I thought. They do make a statement.
3.0,Fit well-just look alittle more utilitarian than I was hoping for.  Great work pants-fabric is still wrinkled around knee area from packing and shipping? I hope that this fabric is going to be ok.
3.0,I love the way it looks mine looks just like the picture... I thought I ordered the 3x but got a 2x but that's not the case I ordered the wrong size. It's very tight in the arms. I am going to have to fix the sleeves to fit. It's very cute it took a lot of work to get it off
3.0,These are super comfy but the pill on the inside and small soft black fluffs come falling off from the inside of the pants and constantly and just litter around. I thought maybe they just needed to be washed again but still does it. Otherwise... fit big but super cozy.
3.0,These will do for the price but its hard to get the chapstick in and out easily.
3.0,I did like the color it looks prettier in the picture
3.0,"This is cute but cheap. Which I expected. It’s felt like the type you get from the dollar store. I needed them for my kid’s Christmas pajama outfits in a pinch so I just bought it even though I had a feeling it would be cheap. It’s slightly big on my son’s head, he’s 3, but my daughter is 5 and it fit her pretty good."
3.0,"It looks great, but it just fits much smaller than expected."
3.0,Kind of big but it's fine
3.0,"Okay? Pretty good? Not bad?  If these are the descriptors you are looking for, then stop the search, you’ve found what you’re looking for.<br />About me 5’11”, 168, 32” waist; I run, ride and swim a lot; I’m very fit but not an underwear model.<br /> Product pros:<br />-Holds an iPhone XR, mostly because the material is stretchy enough, not because the pocket is necessarily big enough at 3”x6”. (For those who’ve asked, it will almost certainly accommodate an iPhone XS Max or any other phone for that matter due to the elasticity of the material.)<br />-Prevents chafing when running.<br />-Legs did not ride up despite the undershorts lacking any specific design feature to prevent that.<br /><br /> Product pros:<br />-The waist is in ordinately high, I feel like I’m wearing control top pantyhose or something. Flipping the elastic waistband over resolves the issue but I’d rather not have to do that.<br />-The cut in general is like that of a tube sock; there wasn’t really any attempt made to approximate an anatomical form, but the material is stretchy enough to fit to your body, whatever that shape that happens to be.<br />-There does not seem to be any legitimate moisture wicking capacity to the material. The undershorts feel cooler because they are thin as you would expect of a polyester, but they hold plenty of sweat.<br />-There is no real compression per se. I purchased a size large, at my size and weight a medium would have almost certainly been better, but given the nature of the material, 85% polyester/15% spandex, compression isn’t really a possiblity. If compression is something you want, look for a higher percentage of spandex"
3.0,"It was a very nice dress, I ALMOST kept it as a beach cover up, but it is very see through so if you want to wear it as a dress, you probably would need a slip or underdress."
3.0,"Very cute and lightweight.  Perfect for summer heat, but the buttons on the back of the neck are very hard to manage and the fit in the neck is tighter than it needs to be.  If you’re sitting you’ll feel it pulling and choking."
3.0,"Runs very small and you have to pay to return it. I was under the impression , that  since it was amazon prime, I wouldn't have to pay $13.00 to return it. That's more than half the cost of the dress itself!!!!"
3.0,The watch band is very beautiful. My only downfall is one of pieces was not properly made causing it to be an issue snap in place.
3.0,Nice stocking stuffer for son that has a Mazda!
3.0,Was a hole in shoulder when we received item. Not very good quality at all. Thin material but it is soft. My daughter is happy with it after I fixed the hole.
3.0,"Tried one on as soon as we got them. My 4 yr old (who wears size 6 clothing) was so excited to get them since her glasses always slip and these come in pretty designs. Unfortunately, she wore them for about 10 mins and said they were too big for her ears - which, if I tightened them enough so they didn't allow her glasses to slip, they material came up above her ears and pushed them out. It also pulled on her hair. So we are returning these and trying the silicon behind the ear type next..."
3.0,Super cute and I love the pattern but I had to return it because it was see through :(
3.0,The product worked for its purpose but was very difficult to assemble!
3.0,"I'm hoping these are the real thing.  Super soft, and look good, but why don't they smell like leather??!!  They smell like vinyl.<br />It's probably 'vegan leather' (aka not real leather)  : /  If my husband agrees, they're going back!  I did go up a size because of the reviews saying they're super small and I'm thinking they'll fit.  I haven't tried the touch screen feature yet- too put off by the non-leather smell....  may update my review later."
3.0,"I purchased the pack with Skeletor, but got an entirely different pack with really sad skeleton tombstones. It's a birthday present and these are not the ones I wanted. The ones that arrived are good quality and I personally like a couple of them of them but... Not what I ordered. The bag they came in even say it's supposed to be the Skeletor bundle."
3.0,No muy a gusto el sombrero no tiene mucha fuerza es muy sensible
3.0,"So pretty but it the pendant ALWAYS flips upside  when you wear it because the top part of the pendant (the eyelashes) outweigh the bottom and since the chain is attached at the middle on both ends it, the pendant always falls upside down. I wish the chains were just a little bit higher on both sides because I prefer necklaces like this where the chains include the pendant as a link In the middle instead of only being attached in one place. Other than this it’s still such great quality, the slide length adjuster works magnificently smooth And I get so many compliments if I can remember to keep flipping the pendant constantly lol. Will definitely order other jewelry from this shop in the future."
3.0,It's pretty. Didn't fit me right so I gave it away.
3.0,"Part of me wishes I read more reviews before buying, because they are all pretty much spot on.  The hat is not very long, and is for a very small head size.  My 7 year old has a small head (like 15th percentile) and the hat is snug on him.  I doubt this would fit most kids over 8 or 9 years old.  Definitely not for adults.  The length is not as long as in the movie, and it is sewn as a rectangle with the ball on one corner, not as a long cone as it appears in the photos and in the movie.  I thought something was wrong with it but the seller says that's how they are supposed to be made.  I didn't mention anything about it and my wife immediately asked the same question, ""why is it shaped like that?"".<br /><br />All that being said, my son loves it.  He likes watching the movie with us and thinks it is super fun to wear the hat.  He's happy and it looks good on him too.  It's just not quite the ""replica"" I was hoping for."
3.0,It was pretty but you get what you pay for!
3.0,"Love the color and everything,  however the breast lining is too small , I wouldn't recommend to C+ breasted women"
3.0,Just ok..kind of small and cheaply made
3.0,My husband said e can't fit his pipe down in pouch to fill it. Not happy with it.
3.0,The bright green is not as strong as the black.  I like not having to tie my shoes but i don't think these will last a long time. :(
3.0,"Size runs small, need to exchange to a bigger size; pls advise w/ instructions"
3.0,"Much like any dangling jewelery, it broke after wearing it a few days. Very pretty while it lasted though"
3.0,Didn't fit how its displayed but is still cute. Kinda thin material
3.0,Very common but good price and look
3.0,It fits a little large. I ordered based off the size chart which was not so accurate.
3.0,"Pros: the pattern is super cute and pretty much goes with any top that you have in your closet. The material is nice and stretchy and breaths pretty good. I’ve had them for a couple weeks now and have held up great in the wash, I do not dry, only line or hang dry. I’m able to move and dance just fine in them.<br /><br />Cons: they are not high waisted. They come below my belly button so when I purchase a high waisted bottom, I want a HIGH waisted bottom (above the belly button!). While dancing and working out, they’ve slid down and I’ve had to pull them up several times.<br /><br />Would I purchase these again? Probably not, I like my work out bottoms high waisted. If that doesn’t bother you then definitely a decent purchase."
3.0,"Cute shirt,just was too small"
3.0,These were cute but fell apart first use
3.0,"I bought a medium by accident, so of course it didn’t fit. I purchased a brown but it’s actually orange!"
3.0,"I ordered a white silver mask. What I received was a silver, silver mask. I am not complaining too much considering it is a very well made mask and it is very attractive. However I just wanted to let you know the item I received was an incorrect one. I do not want to spend the time or money returning it especially considering I need it ASAP and do not wish to wait for a new one to arrive. So I guess the best option for me is to be happy with what I received. Regardless getting the wrong item is an experience that make this seller lose points. Whatever mask you recieve will be a great mask just dont expect to get the correct one.<br />One more thing. The shipping was fast. Gotta give props to the seller for that."
3.0,Wouldn't fit any of my sunglasses because the opening was too narrow but it looks and feels like great quality!
3.0,"Mine might be defective but the cinching is in a very weird spot, not on the side more like right in the front. It looks odd and incorrect in person."
3.0,It’s cute but it keeps coming apart.
3.0,I absolutely LOVE this dress!! Super stylish & sleek! An bit tighter at the bust line area - But maybe not for everyone!
3.0,"I purchased this bellydance costume, and its beauty is undeniable. However, there's a sizing issue with the bra; I usually wear a small but had to go for a medium based on reviews, and it's still snug. Unfortunately, the larger hip area of the medium size doesn't fit well."
3.0,Gloves fit well and grip nicely- some stitching around the fingers started to come loose after the first ride- don't foresee these lasting a long time but for the price they do the job.
3.0,This is a very attractive Fitbit band.<br />This is my third one because the first two fell apart and were ruining my clothes.<br />The mest starts falling apar on the edges and at the connection to the clasp.<br />I like the band but I wish htere was better quality control.
3.0,I like the body of the shirt but the shoulder straps over the shoulders are way too loose. It looks funny. I am returning.
3.0,much shorter than anticipated
3.0,"Estan muy bonitas, pero no es el tamaño que ofrecen 10mm<br />Las envian de 8mm, por qué?"
3.0,Very boxy shape. Size down! I didn’t end up wearing this but if I had time to order another size it may have been cuter.  I ordered a medium and would have liked to try a small or even xs.
3.0,"Runs small, stretchy tight at waist"
3.0,"Fits well, but too heavy and the tongue too large that hurt my ankle....I dislike it.....I try once. But no more....Converse-all Stars is excellent to play basketball....sorry ."
3.0,Are usually always get extra large is to be safe. But even as an extra large this one is small there’s absolutely no stretch to it.
3.0,Post wires are too big! Beautiful earrings.
3.0,Love the Material but too Small giving as gift to Daughter who is smaller bust line than myself. Somewhat disappointed ordered according to size chart
3.0,nice compression but they do run small
3.0,Th3 hat is great but the gloves are small
3.0,"The hoodie is soft and comfortable, but fits like a normal hoodie - tighter band around the waist - not a loose band that makes the hoodie a relaxed fit.  Also the color is more of a light blue, not the color in the pic."
3.0,This suit is for small breasted girls.  Cute but small in the chest area.
3.0,"My daughter just turned 3 and is on the petite side.  She weighs 23 pounds.  We had to buy the 2-3 size and it was very big for her.  She only wore the dress for her presents and cake inside the house.  It would have been too large to wear outside....large in the armpits= showing chest.  Overall it was cute and for the price it served it's purpose. Also, the three on this dress is NAVY BLUE...not purple as I expected."
3.0,Needed it fior January birthday  text on product said all months were available. Couldn’t choose anymore than 4 colors  I took the closest and it came on an October card. Disappointed site is not user friendly  It is a pretty necklace and came in a timely fashion just not January stone and/or symbol.
3.0,"Was disappointed because the color of the jean is extremely light, pale blue. I was looking for the color in the photo. But I do like the jeans I have a few pairs."
3.0,Ok I loved the bottoms. So much that I didn’t return I just got a different top. The top I hated. This is not for bigger Boobed women. They were spilling out the sides and it was just not a good fit. Sucks to because it really is a pretty top but the bottoms oh I couldn’t return them.
3.0,"I would have given it 5 stars but it arrived late, even though I purchased the two day shipping.  I don't believe it was the seller fault but I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to wear the dress for Easter.  The dress itself is super cute. Nicely made."
3.0,Love the shorts comfort but be warned that the shirt is extremely cropped.
3.0,These have a very thin frame and feel very light weight. I don't expect them to last long. But for the price they get the job done.
3.0,We ordered these for ages 7- 16 along with the gloves that are for ages 2-6.  There was a HUGE difference in size between the two sizes.<br />The 2-6 was fine for our kids up to age 10.  We had to return the size 7-16 as being way too big and order more 2-6.
3.0,"It's cute and fit well, expected it to be a bit small so ordered up.  I'm 5'3 and 130 normally a medium ordered a large.  My main issue is the string is much thicker than i expected and not super cute."
3.0,The quality and weight werent what I expected but the band is okay
3.0,Cute but really thin material
3.0,Seemed smaller than expected - I wasn’t expecting it to be that much larger but the loop is too small to put a standard chain through so I wasn’t able to use as I had planned.
3.0,The charm itself was as expected. The only issue I had was that the charm did not come with the Pandora bag as stated or shown in the images. I would buy again though. Still cheaper and good quality.
3.0,Nice look for the buttons but a few had dents.
3.0,"These are beautiful earrings but they came to me in pieces, and I can't get the set to stay in. I was so disappointed because they are so pretty."
3.0,The watch is not that large. I was a little worried about sending it back since I’ve wore it twice.
3.0,"If you add a new cushion insole, these shoes would feel way better. The laces are super long. I would replace them with a shorter lace.  Has decent grip on the bottom of the shoe."
3.0,SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT
3.0,ORDERED A SMALL AND RECIEVED A SMALL BUT IT FITS LIKE AN L-XL
3.0,"The reason why I gave these only three stars was because as far as using them for stretching they were absolutely terrible. 99.99% of the time I never have problem stretching to new size when using Stone. And these seem like they're real enough Stone. However that being said, there's a pretty nasty dip where the O-ring sits and if you're going up a size that could mean a blowout as ended up meaning a minor blowout for me. They're really cute my 1 year did all right with them but that dip on them was absolutely terrible and for that reason I ended up returning them."
3.0,"Fit well.  Has hip pockets - two major wins; however, it has the most pointless, small, flap-only pocket on the back!  Nothing can be secured!  I've never come across such a silly design in 20 years of purchasing shorts specifically for running.  Additionally, while 100% polyester like most others out there, they seem to stick a little more when wet."
3.0,"This dress didn’t work for me bc the length was just slightly too short to wear with heels. Otherwise, it fit well and is super comfy! Would be cute with flats or sandals!"
3.0,Had to return because it was way smaller than it should have been. I measured myself using the guide but it didn't fit at all. Good quality though if you get the right size!
3.0,"I really like these PJ's  but the pants were too long.  I'm 5'2"" and usually a regular size pants would drape over my ankle.  But these passed my feet.  Because they're comfy and soft I just cut the legs and fit fine.  But for the price I paid I shouldn't have to do that.  For me, it was not worth the price."
3.0,"I started to wear it to work. It has been only two days. It feels nice and gives a nice shape, but I did not see any tummy control. I am ok with that as it is good with length. I am 4' 11,'' and it was an excellent length for me. The other part, I noticed was that it picks up stuff. I had small white things that fell from my shirt. I think its the material.  I am going to use it for the gym rather than the office — Will update."
3.0,Shirt was too small. The XL seemed like a medium.
3.0,Cute but very tight in the arms and chest. XL is more like a sz 10
3.0,"Not intended for women with long torsos...camel-toe, not a good look. Although if you are under 5’10-5’9 could work great for you! Nice fabric and looks classy."
3.0,I liked the warmth of the hat! I like that the speakers are concealed .
3.0,"I got two pairs one yellow one army print gray, if I had just gotten the army print gray ones this would be a five-star review I absolutely love them squat proof sweat proof tummy control they look good butttt the yellow ones because of the color of the fabric are not squat proof you can see your sweat really bad and it doesn't dry so you get a ring of darkness for the rest of the day until you wash the pants. Go for a dark color if you're going to get this brand I'm sure any of the dark colors will be fine It seems as though the light unpatterned pairs just make your butt look wet even hours post workout."
3.0,"Sandal is cheaply made, you can’t get the strap in the buckle.Nd they are definitely not senior citizen made.if she wanted to have a half flashy sandal but they are kinda cute Nd they look as of the picture but with white rhinestone’s not the Crystal look of rhinestones like the sandal is advertised so it’s a three stars for me"
3.0,Super sliperry pair of sandals. Almost to the point of not being wearable
3.0,Not a tight fit.<br />Please send return information.
3.0,Not a sweatshirt. It’s a t shirt. But still cute
3.0,The dress is alright. It was somewhat tight on me so I gave it to my sister and she likes it.
3.0,Great look and materials but poor sewing.<br />Multiple threads unraveling.<br />Good for a while but won't last .
3.0,They're  OK glasses the only problem is they are absolutely flat so when you put them on your face which is not flat it is curved They don't fit right there flat and you're put them on a curved surface they need to be curve just a little bit you know almost like a rap around
3.0,Very nice but it doesn't last long.
3.0,Looked good but the gray was white  for some reason.
3.0,"design is nice, doesn't feel cheap but it's really pocketbook sized, it's huge!  Way too big for regular pocket use."
3.0,"These shoes are indeed very large!! BUT, if you take that into account when ordering, they are pretty cute. I ordered the girlie white pair with the cutouts. You can probably tell from the picture, that they are sort of a soft and flexible type of shoe. They are less than half the price as say, a pair of stride rites, and they are certainly not as good of quality, but I still like them. Taking the other review into account, I ordered the 6-9 month size and they measure about 5 1/4 or 5 1/2 inches front to back. They are also wide, especially in the toe box because it has a squared toe. They are almost exactly the same size as our pair of New Balance shoes that are a size 3 xw. These little white shoes might be even wider than the extra wide New Balance! These actually ended up working perfectly for what I needed them for, which is to fit over my daughter's leg braces. The velcro was long enough to close over her braces (that's hard to find!) In my experience, New Balance are about the same size as Converse, so the 6-9 month size in these shoes is probably similar in length to a size 3 Converse, if that helps anyone. These would probably compare to a size 4 Stride Rite. They are much bigger than a 6-12 month size Pediped. Even though these work well for me, I can't give them a high rating since the sizing is really off. These would never fit a 6-9 month old!!"
3.0,It's good. The material is slightly see through and the waist is a little on the tight side but the elstic streches so it's not that bad.
3.0,Pretty shoes but size up
3.0,"The material of this bothers me.  It's also too shiny.  The fit was a tad bit larger than expected.  Overall, it's just okay."
3.0,Its quite small and the top is not adjustable in the back it has a clasp (that easily comes undone)  The neck string is pretty short as well.<br />I am 5'6&#34; athletic build. The color is great .....i would exchange it but the cost of shipping it back would be more than its worth
3.0,"I bought 4. One for myself and the rest for friends. We all had the same problem, it was just too tight. It’s so cute and well made though. I wanted to wear it all weekend on our cruise , but just couldn’t."
3.0,Its really big!
3.0,little too small
3.0,The glove size and construction rates a four. The padding in the palm could be better. On my first time wearing them the heel of my hands still got sore and that was on an 11 mile ride. I usually ride 25 miles.
3.0,"it was coolish, cheap and not water proof. its was cool but the metal stains easy"
3.0,I ordered several sets of these for 4 year olds. I may have misunderstood the size chart as these were too big for the boys. I corrected that problem by telling the boys that they are super hero suits and had them put on a pair of their underwear on over the thermal pants to keep them from sliding down and off. I will take the blame for the size error.  However the material is really thin. I held a shirt up to the light and put my hand inside. I could easily see my hand through the cloth.The kids T-shirts are made of thicker stuff.  Somehow the name made me believe they would be xtra-warm and thick. They aren't. The boys pajamas are warmer. However the thinness of the cloth also worked to our advantage because even when the legs and sleeves were bunched up on the kids arms and legs it wasn't so thick to be uncomfortable. In the winter it is not uncommon for us to have single digit temperatures and I was really wanting something warmer. I guess we will continue using their pajamas for long underwear and they can wear their 'super hero suits' under their pants this spring when things are a bit warmer. The colors were nice.
3.0,"Buyer beware. There is only a front view of this purse on the product display - the front.  The back of the purse does not have the same gorgeous material.  The back is faux pink/lavender leather. It looks cheap. I will have to make sure that when I am walking, I turn the pretty side out, and I will be embarrassed when people see the back side."
3.0,"The material and colors were excellent. However, I’m short this would have been great for someone taller. In purchasing this think Express quality clothing, the excitement that you can size down because of the cut."
3.0,"I really really liked this purse I never had the cross body one in 60 years of caring a purse, but I was tired of caring a LARGE grocery type bag.  But after 6 months the strap broke from the purse as I was living work.  So disappointed for the size, price and all it was perfect! BOO HOO"
3.0,they were really bulky
3.0,"Decent pants, high vis and seem like you'd protect you a bit in a fall, but I've noticed small holes all over on them. Moth eaten? Hard to say."
3.0,"This dress is just as cute in person as it is pictured here!  I read the reviews before I bought it and bought a size bigger than I'd expect it was still too small.  Like other reviews said, it is tight in the arms.  I am returning it and buying it in a size bigger.  I am 5'4, 220 lbs and a true size 18 or 2X, I bought a 3X and am going to get a 4X, which seems unreal, but man, this is cute!"
3.0,Had to return and order in smaller size BC its big on me and it is see through...
3.0,"these are more for dance and stage appearance.  Way too exaggerated and wide for &#34;normal&#34; wear.  The pant itself was nice but it was wide and large all the way from the waist, through the tummy and down to the huge leg opening."
3.0,I really wanted to love this dress. The black and white frontal view is so chic!  But when you turn around and can see your underwear through the white side of the dress it is a total let down. I also feel that I can size down if I decide to get another color. It’s Very roomy and long. This might be a cute “go to brunch dress or buffet dress in a cruise.
3.0,"Good looking watch, but received with two spring pins projecting from one of the links in the band, they were loose and easily fell out making the band useless.  Not sure if there should have been another inserted to make it stable, but return request was quickly honored by Amazon, so no issue.  Would have liked to have kept the watch based on the price/appearance.  Probably a 5 star rating if in good condition when received."
3.0,"In the photos the design looks purple. It's brown. It's very brown. Even in the pictures I took it looks kind of purple -ish but it's not. So I was disappointed about that and the fringe is just going everywhere. I'm sure there's a way to fix that, but I don't have the time to spend on it. It looks like it's really well made though."
3.0,Not as well made as I per the picture.
3.0,"I have loved having a watch with the ease to replace my bands easily with the quick release pin technology. You just slide the pin inward on a spring and it comes out and voila, you're ready to replace it. However, this band is the right size but is NOT an easy release version which I just assumed it was...and I was quite disappointed when I realized it wasn't. Like REALLY disappointed.<br /><br />It comes with the tool to remove it and put it in place but it takes quite a bit of extra work to pull off and if your eyes are as poor as mine, it can an extra amount of time to pull off. I did it and while on the watch the band DOES look good...but I'm deducting a full 2 stars for the band being so difficult to put on and remove. Even cheap band manufacturers have them, why not WOCCI? Seems like a cheap way to make a product that they chose not to make as easy to install as other companies. Just my .02. I will not be buying another WOCCI product."
3.0,Def get too sizes up.. not happy with how small it runs.
3.0,"Much larger than appears in picture<br />Still nice<br />Wearable, just maybe not as an everyday ring"
3.0,Pretty good for the price. The large leaf has a discoloration on the tip. I didn't notice in the picture until now but it looks like<br />someone messed it up when painting it.
3.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned,  these run large. I didn't pay attention.  I do a snug medium in the regular skinny pajamajeans at 5'1' & 138. The medium in this new style really is larger but not daring to order a SMALL."
3.0,No adjustment and the elastic is far too tight causing the mask to slip up the top of my nose and pinch the bottom of my eyes. Do not recommend.
3.0,Still does not fit after 4 months.
3.0,Looks really nice but too cheap
3.0,"The product is just ok. The price was ok so I decided to purchase it. It's very light weight. I'm of average face and the fit was ok. I like that it comes with a hard case for protectinf the glasses. I use it for outdoor activities.<br /><br />The problem I have with it was that it wasn't as clear as I'd hope it would be. It is a little foggy, like when your glasses touches your skin. When I use a microfiber to clean the lens.. I feel like it doesn't clean the lens enough to be clear for my liking. Since it's not glass expect it not to be as clear. It also feels fragile. If you are picky about vision and clarity... I would not recommend this."
3.0,"The color is a much, much darker shade of gray and not very appealing."
3.0,"These do the job, but the quality is a little lacking. The plastic arm ends slip right off and are misaligned, so they're a little uncomfortable. I'd rate them better if they cost $5, but they're four times that, and not really worth it."
3.0,"The pattern on the black and maroon dress is beautiful. It is perfectly boho-casual.<br />However, the fit was unexpected and the fabric too thin to be a dress for work without a full slip.<br />I'm 5'2 and a size 4 in dresses- I bought a small. The elastic was quite tight on my ribcage, and the shoulders were far too wide.<br />The pattern though! Its so pretty! I'd recommend this as a beach coverup for women who have wider shoulders, or as an anytime dress with a slip underneath."
3.0,Maybe I have a large ear but this does not fit the way it looks in the item's description picture.  I'll give it to someone who has  a small ear!
3.0,These are very cheap material and tight on an average size head
3.0,The scarf is darker than it appears in the picture - closer to black than brown.
3.0,A little smaller than I expected but still pretty
3.0,Love that ring I would order again
3.0,These are okay.  They feel nice against the skin and I like the stretchiness.  The problem is they are see through so you have to be sure your butt is completely covered.  I got the Moon Wood Winter High Waist Spanx Fleece ones and was hoping these were similar (the Moon Wood only come in black)
3.0,Gloves tend to be a bit small/tight.<br />I had to return the first pair for this reason.<br /> Italians must have small hands!!
3.0,Cute bag. However the size and quality is not as it appears in the photos. I found this very very small.
3.0,"Product has no quality.  They ripped  every  where. It's  like to much acid  used. Zipper  doesn't  work when my son went to Rome them, the hem ripped. They need to remove  this product. Will be returning. I order from Amazon  on a daily  basis  and have only  returned  one itme before because  it  was  to small for me. I'm  so so so disappointed."
3.0,"It was nice, but could have more features."
3.0,It is made for skinny women with no curves
3.0,"The fabric is flimsy, light weight Polyester.  it was a big wrinkled mess, but I've hung it up.  I plan to dampen it, and tumble it in a low dryer to see if some of the wrinkles will come out, rather than ironing it.  I like the colors. and will see how it works for me over the next day or so."
3.0,A little too small for a medium... should’ve gotten an XL
3.0,The bottom is a bit more cheeky than I would want...beautiful color
3.0,It’s bulky. It loses color very quickly. But none the less for how cheap it is what the heck else did you expect? It’s great. I bought 4 of them.
3.0,"I have usually wear a 7.5 to 8 size shoe in women's and my calves measure 13.5 inches. I ordered a M according to the size chart and I'm not very impressed with these socks. The material is nice and soft so I imagine they would be comfortable throughout the day; however, the sock is way too long and not enough compression for me. The top of the sock goes to above my knee. I'm 5'3&#34; so not terrible tall, but I think that is the average height of females in the United States. I would suggest making petite sizes if the company considers their lengths average. In addition, the compression does not feel like 20-30. I'm on my feet 12-13 hours a day as an RN and these feel like normal socks to me."
3.0,a little tight but otherwise a nice pair of shorts
3.0,"I give it 3 stars for the shirt I still use it really good quality, simple shirt but the pants and the hair band on the other side is the worst quality I have ever buy."
3.0,"the little things that are hanging are plastic, one of them came broken"
3.0,"Its cute but, It's not as long as I expected it to be."
3.0,This is a nice band except the stitching is not good as you can see on the pictures.
3.0,both very pretty. moonstone was more see through and become my favorite pair. the amethyst I only got to wear once as one fell out in the shower and cracked when it landed on the tub floor
3.0,"The beads are beautiful but maybe a little too heavy, which makes the string vulnerable. It broke unexpectedly after less than three month's use, and I was disappointed"
3.0,"This did keep my head and hands warm.  However, it was large on my head so when I turned my head I saw the inside of the hood.  Made it difficult to see anything in my peripheral vision."
3.0,The material was very different from what I expected it to be.
3.0,Fit is on the small side.  The fabric is a nice weight but not true compression as it does not hug the torso.  The length is on the short side as well
3.0,"When it arrived I was quite excited but when I took it out of the package the ring was flattened. Although I was able to open it back up It does not fit well and it could be just me but it looks more vibrant in the picture. I am a little disappointed with the craftsmanship, I do not believe it will hold up for long but I will wear it for as long as it last."
3.0,I guess its fine.  However I did receive 14 black and 1 white -__-
3.0,The headbands are a bit tight for an adult head.
3.0,"Cute, but not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I ordered the black/purple checkered pair and there is a seam that runs between all the fingers. I have to take the gloves off after an hour or so because the pressure becomes very uncomfortable."
3.0,Ordered XXL cause last time i ordered similar suit in XL it was alittle snug so i went up a size and way to big.
3.0,Adorable outfit but only really made for one wear as very cheap material and lots of strings.
3.0,"Bought a medium, too small. The description said it would have fit me, looks like I'm returning it to buy a large."
3.0,I like it but it does look cheap
3.0,Big purse; things can easily get lost in here; strap is somewhat short and not adjustable; prettier in person. At first i wasn't sure about the look once it arrived but after carrying it for about a month i lm pleasantly surprised i like it since its bigger than im use to. No rhinestones have fallen off yet. 2 inside pocket zippers have broken but it hasnt seemed to be an issue to me. So overall I recommend this purse if you like something different than the usual
3.0,"The 12-14 is absolutely not the size of your average 12-14. Compared to other companies, this 12-14 was significantly smaller. It looks more like a size 8 or maybe 10- tops. I wish it would’ve been the right fit, they look nice. I guess this is what I get for shopping for my sons’ clothing online. I just suggest ordering a size up if you order from this company."
3.0,"It's better to hand wash, because the washer & dryer mesh up this material quickly."
3.0,Exactly as pictured. Colorful ring that is smooth on your finger. I was worried it would feel rough. It didn’t. They do run small so order a size up. Great price. Not sure how long it will last but I won’t be disappointed because the price is good.
3.0,Bonita pero cambió de color al mes de comprar😞
3.0,They are a decent spring cardigan but on me they are tight through the shoulder.  Not great quality either.
3.0,very pretty and comfortable but 3 x is more like 2 x
3.0,it smells bad
3.0,There ok a little tight but I am losing weight so in another few weeks will fit better I think and I don't want to send them back as I will use them soon.
3.0,"I love a buffalo check for fall and winter so was excited about this. Unfortunately, it’s not very practical for me fit wise. While this will look cute with jeans or a mini with tights, it’s not going to keep you warm and the sleeves are a bit wide and bulky to wear with a sweater or light jacket. This shirt is a thin, kind of slick viscose fabric.<br /><br />I’m between a small and medium and normally take a medium in flowy shirts. This shirt is deceptive as it’s not really loose (as shown on model) unless you’re very petite or size up. I’m a 36B and this is a bit restrictive in the bust and upper arms. The fitted bust area and boxy shape make it hitch up when you lift your arms so your stomach will show.<br /><br />The strip of crochet really adds to the style and I think this would be very cute if it was less fitted up top. If you’re small on top or size up, I’d recommend."
3.0,"Love the fit, it was a bit too long however & the buttons look a bit cheap."
3.0,a bit tight fitting on my big bust
3.0,So I loved this bag online and I made sure to go through all the colour so that my friend would get a great gift. Double checked the order before I purchased and they still sent the wrong colour combo. The bag itself is good though. All the zippers work and it's a decent size. I can't yet speak to the durability since it hasn't been out through the riggors of gym life just yet.
3.0,good quality but didn't keep items cool enough until I got home from shopping. sent back and ordered their thermal insulated bags .
3.0,I got these for my husband and got the size he normally wears but these were way small. Seemed like good shorts if they would have fit
3.0,"I tried this dress on my better and it fit very cute. However, i quickly realized that one button was missing and the other was falling off so I’m exchanging the item."
3.0,"Definitely read the size chart! Runs a bit small, But it was good quality ! Super cute"
3.0,very small not what i excepted
3.0,Cut a little big for my taste and lighter in weight than I expected.
3.0,Returned because a medium fits more like a small
3.0,Love the cover-up but it wrinkles terribly.  Fit and color are great.
3.0,I liked the outfit but had to return because it was to small and the entire buttocks area is see through great for a stripper tho
3.0,I bought a size up from my regular size and I should have gone a couple sizes up. It’s a little snug. But it’s very beautiful.
3.0,"It wasn't the color I expected, but nice anyway. Had an odor, but not to unbearable."
3.0,Ordered a size larger than what I normally wear as it shows the dress is fitted around the waist. I was very disappointed in the fabric as it does not sit the way the pictures show and the sizing itself was off. Had I know the xl was going to give my E cup chest an extra 3 inches of loose sitting fabric I never would have ordered it.
3.0,"I love the way they feel and fit, but panty liners DO NOT stick in the crotch area.  I’m VERY disappointed in this and I just ordered them in the last week.  I don’t know if I can return them after trying out 2 of them."
3.0,Feels a little cheap but it will work for lazy days.
3.0,"It looks good, but not really functional for eating. I thought it would be. The opening will get food all over it.  Drinking with a straw is ok. Just as easy to pull the mask under your chin when eating."
3.0,The compression for me is not what it is advertised. It felt only 10-20 pressure instead of 20-30. Also the length is too long. You should have a choice of XS size instead of just Small which is too loose and too long for petite people weighing 110 and 5 foot or less people like me. The material itself is comfortable but the XS size should be another choice available and I would have given 5star.
3.0,"I didn't really get a chance to try these out, the fit wasn't right. I ordered size 11 and my toes were compressed. Size 11.5 or 12 would have been better."
3.0,"This really is a belt that is invisible. I am apple-shaped so all the 'normal' belt buckles stick way out and are very visible under a shirt. This belt really lays flat and is even smoothening out the button/flap area of my pants. Problem is, it's a tiny piece of plastic holding the belt buckle together, and it just didn't hold up. Used the belt maybe 10-15 times until the crucial piece of plastic broke off."
3.0,"The dress is absolutely beautiful, BUT, the sequins are already falling off after worn to 2 dance classes (only worn during class and not played in). Also, it is way too low cut, IMO, for a 6 year old so I am having to buy a bralette or camisole for her to wear underneath."
3.0,"Very thin pants, not at all for cold weather..."
3.0,The Boots do not have a zipper on the side and are very hard to get on and off.
3.0,I love these earrings but unfortunately I cannot wear them because the material irritates my ears too much. I would rate 5 star otherwise. I love the show “How I met your mother”!!
3.0,Es muy linda pero queda pequeña
3.0,"Good looking band at a good price,  one major issue. No pins, despite the listing shows pins."
3.0,Runs small the color is vivid great
3.0,"Fits true to size.  Unfortunately the cute buttons on both sleeves (all six of them) popped off as I was getting out of the car at the event venue I was attending.  Super cute, but  I wish I would have reinforced  the stitching on the buttons before I wore it."
3.0,The dress is okay but its not true to size that's for sure!! Go up a few sizes and its very very short!!
3.0,Very nice..but to small for the price..
3.0,Very comfortable but fades after two washes.
3.0,Too short for my long torso. 5'4&#34; 160lbs
3.0,"First I have a 38.5"" bust, and so orderd the XL. I love the green print and fit and flare shape, however this dress was awkward and baggy thru the underarms, and gapped at the bust. I sewed a snap to keep the front closed as a first fix. I also sewed the arms in a good inch at the armpit tapered to 3/8"" at the wrist and now the sleeves actually fit my arms nicely. As you can see the front pieces barely overlap where they are sewn in at the high waistline. I had to use body tape to keep the front flap CLOSED and not show my bra under the snap. This fabric is soft, but clingy. With the fun green print, it doesn't show too much, although static cling is a reality! Polyester fabric does NOT breathe, and isn't particularly warm in cool weather either. I wish this were made of a better quality fabric, but alas it is cute for the price."
3.0,"I love the flannel shirt. Very soft.  But the product is not as described.  It is not lined. I'm disappointed I was looking for a lined flannel shirt, I spend a lot of time in the cold."
3.0,I can really say this top is not true to size...it fits perfect except the sleeves just at the top a tight..it looks ok but slightly uncomfortable. It's an adorable top.
3.0,"I ordered Large, but they fit like Medium."
3.0,very large
3.0,"It's cute, but very bendable."
3.0,Coverup is ok. Color is not a pretty as shown in ad. Still keeping.
3.0,I don’t like how it shows the class of 2020 bright in the pic but not on the scarf. Cheap material and very thin.
3.0,Good quality. Don't fall off of face at all maybe to tight for my comfort!
3.0,Was a little tight
3.0,"I will be returning.  It is a stretchy fabric which I did not know.  The size chart said I was a large, but I am definately a medium."
3.0,"The waist is too small, the waist lace comes out the first washing, the waist digs into your skin, and they absolutely run small.  My suggestion to the manufacturer is to use an elastic waist band, not this cheap silicone based edging that is cheap and will certainly fall apart, and digs deep into your skin.  Poor design.  Other than that, the material is good.  Will not buy again, though."
3.0,Really big on the waist and longer than expected
3.0,"previously purchased this dress in another color & loved it, but in the print it was a different material and didn't fall as nicely."
3.0,Just the right size took me a hour to close it back😡 But fit perfectly
3.0,The product had a slit in it.  I would have liked a replacement but sent it back and ordered from another company.  They need to check the product before they mail it.
3.0,I love the print and quality of this hat & gloves but it runs way small. I ordered the 1-2T size & it’s too small for my 15m old who is in the 15 percentile for everything. I couldn’t get the mitts on his hands & the hat is pretty tight. It’s not worth the gas to return it for 5$. The quality seems great and the fleece lining is super soft and cozy. The skateboard print is so cute for a boy.
3.0,Not thrilled with it but it's ok. Decent hangout outfit.
3.0,"Nice shirts, but they run very small. A 14/16 is smaller than any of my grandchild's 10/12 shirts of multiple brands that she's outgrown."
3.0,Adorable and hypoallergenic but the posts are just too short and the backs are impossible to get on. Had to use regular earring backs that I already had. Returning and finding a longer posted set.
3.0,"I thought these were cute until parts started falling off. Specifically the one that looks like a double choker, the whole thing ended up falling apart."
3.0,"Of course the headbands are cute on my little girl (6 months) - she's adorable! The headbands are soft, comfortable, and versatile as other reviewers mentioned.  However, they colors are more muted than I anticipated.  For example, the yellow is actually mustard.  Also, there is a white piece of felt where the bows are attached to the band, which is soft on my girls head but often shows. Most unfortunately, the bows themselves sort of looks like cheap doilies that have been dyed, gathered, and stitched.  We'll use the bows, but they aren't our favorites."
3.0,This T-shirt is wider than long
3.0,"Item received is not as pictured, pattern on the arms are incorrect, I expected a black and beige pattern and the one I received had pink and burgundy, this is for a boy not a girl, duh, oh my gosh, waste time"
3.0,"the shape doesnt suit me may be, but the product quality and finishing is good, came well packaged."
3.0,Ok. Item. Nothing special.
3.0,"At 6’4” and 235, the XL tall is too snug in the chest, waist , and arms. Do consider that I’m also over 70 and tend to like things loose. But, circulation is a big factor in warmth. The arm and body length is fine and the top stretches but I’m exchanging it for the XXL tall. Overall, I like it and it seems that it would help keep me warm.<br />The chest pocket is too small for my iPhone.11"
3.0,The top fit great but the bottoms were way to large. The quality is ok it’s a little thin but I absolutely love the top.
3.0,I did not like the way this dress fit me. It didn't fit across my shoulder correctly.
3.0,Decent product. Paint chipped off silver ring.
3.0,"Married 18 years and still going strong.  Unfortunately, this ring is not. In use for just over 2 weeks, the scratches from everyday life surprised me.  The tungsten ring with wooden inlay by this same company is a much better choice.  This appears to simply be paint.  What kind I'm not sure because it withstood an attempt to remove the point with fingernail polish remover to make the entire band gold.  It didn't work.  The scratches aren't noticeable from a distance and doesn't not affect the comfort or durability of the ring in general.<br /><br />My only issue is whatever was used to make it black. It's advertised as scratch resistance and it is not.  I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I was not influenced by anything other than the product. I have no relationship with the seller and I was not compensated."
3.0,Totally wasn’t expexting the earrings to be so HUGE!!! They are cute however l can’t stress how big they are. They aren’t as heavy as they look but definitely not lightweight. These earrings are possibly not meant to be worn daily or for long periods of time. I ordered the gold and black. The colors are as they seem in the pics. I like these earrings but l will be giving them away as a gift to a gf that loves HUGE earrings. Bummer.
3.0,Fogs up even though anti fog
3.0,"Looks good and appears well made. One issue is that the clips are not flat so could show through, but more importantly they have sharp edges at the pivot points, so they could snag on the pants depending on the fabric, like linen."
3.0,"Great material and look,but rather tight."
3.0,Not quite the right pattern for the Elias mask but the rest are great!
3.0,Like the actual color. Very hot though.
3.0,Great looking/feeling bracelet. But the clasp needs improving. Will not stay hooked.
3.0,These glasses were ok.
3.0,The dress is cute but it has this trimon the bottom that is like hard elastic all around it that flips and it make the dress look weird and uncomfortable. Unless mine was defective 😭😭😭pretty dress but that thing on the buttom around the skirt flips and looks terrible 😥&#34;on mine&#34; I'm not sure if someone else has experience this problem. Thank you .
3.0,Painful to wear other than for quick pics
3.0,"Confirm previous views that they are really thin, more like thick tights then leggings. Colors are bold and fabric is nice. I ordered a size up and they were still super snug. Not thrilled with product but they work."
3.0,It was too small to read without a magnifier- I used the charms on wedding bouquets
3.0,I can't tell the product work or not.
3.0,it is on the smaller side- I was disappointed- not worth shipping back
3.0,"Very pretty dress, but the dress is too thin"
3.0,Looks beautiful but it runs small and is itchy
3.0,Hard to clasp.
3.0,"Cute, but run small. Returned."
3.0,Looks as expected just disappointed that it didn't fit. I bought in my size. The top was fine but was not made for women with large backsides. The dress wouldn't come down over my butt. A friend of mine size M fit in the dress perfectly & it looks gorgeous. When I get a photo I'll update. If they sold 1 size up i'd reorder as it is super pretty. I'm wondering if the dress is maybe Asian sizes?
3.0,I like the quick release but it does loosen up over time. I think I prefer the Velcro which can be adjusted during a run
3.0,"Hello.  I am the only one writing a review that did not receive a discounted product for a &#34;fair and  honest&#34; review.  Yes it is well made but my problem is with the hook....it is too small to actually hook onto anything.  I just go not get this design.  I will start to use this bag but so far, I am somewhat dissapointed, and I just noticed that EVERYONE that wrote who a review before me got a discount!  I question the integrity of this practice and I question the honesty of the the reviews; and no, I do not want a discount, just a good product."
3.0,Love it as a sports bra. Doesnt seem to hold my posture up like i thought it would. My shoulders still roll foward.
3.0,"Backs need to be replaced, as they are extremely loose"
3.0,I'm 37 in around my chest. Ordered a medium and it's too tight.
3.0,"Love the band , but wore it for a half a day , and I have a allergic reaction to it 😔. Hoping I can send it back"
3.0,"It's OK. I ordered my normal size, but the fit is weird. The neckline is high, it's snug across the breasts, and it's much fuller than pictured. I will need to alter this before I can wear it."
3.0,"Cute coverup, but if you want to wear it alone, good luck.. it's super thin material/see through."
3.0,"This is not sized for a child to wear as a mask.  This is sized for an adult.  Buyers take note.<br />I bought for my 5 year old, which it did not fit and it also did not fit my 8 year old."
3.0,About this to wear for Halloween. It is kind of hard to see when you have it on but I’m keeping it.  It’s fairly durable and a good quality for the price. My only issue is it’s hard to see when it’s on your face.
3.0,"These really do help with packing; however, the zippers aren't very strong and separate easily.  Not sure that I would buy this brand again."
3.0,"I bought this dress looking for something that would be a little warmer (& more conservative) than my summer nightgowns but not as heavy as a long nightgown.  Unfortunately, the cloth is EXTREMELY thin.  I'm freezing in it during the winter (we live in NY), but with the long sleeves, it may be uncomfortable for the summer.  It's also fairly sheer.  If I were standing in front of light, you'd be able to see more than just the outline of my body. The material is also extremely clingy.  I'm not opposed to a sheer, clingy fabric; I just didn't expect it from a dress that isn't cut/trying to be sexy.  I certainly can't wear this around family/friends who stay over (which is what I was hoping for b/c sometimes I don't feel like getting fully dressed before cooking everyone breakfast).  The dress doesn't really serve the purpose for which I bought it, but the color is pretty & I didn't feel like going to the trouble of a return.  It also is very roomy.  I am 5'9&#34;, 130 lbs & the size S is huge on me.  Definitely size down.  Hope this helps anyone else considering ordering!  It's not a bad nightgown, just not what I'd imagined."
3.0,"cute but the gem fell off and had to be glued back on ASAP. kinda loose bracelet, not great quality, ok price."
3.0,Well made and comparable to similar products that I have purchased. I purchased the xl from the chart. My calf is 17 inches around and l am 6 feet 2 inches tall. The fit was good until the calf to the knee was to tight and I found this to be not consistent with the chart.  For a smaller diameter calf this could be a 5 star product but I hove it 3 stars for quality of material and color selections
3.0,Was what I ordered but fit very large
3.0,BIgger than what I had hoped for but it's a gift so I hope she likes it.
3.0,"This ring is adorable. I love how simple it is and that it isn't too obviously a cat. It's very cute and it is very easy to change the size of it if you want to wear it on different fingers. With the changing size though, the ring isn't made very strongly so you need to be careful how often you change the size or else the spot in the middle of the ring gets very brittle and seems like it would be very easy to accidentally break."
3.0,"The shirt is really small and fits more like a 3t, but pants are normal sized. Very frustrating."
3.0,"If you have big boobs and wear high waisted bottoms it will still show some tummy. So depending on what you want that might be perfect. It does show part of your bra on the sides which is annoying.<br />Thin fabric so it's a little see-through, but it's not too bad definately for going out or working out. Not work appropriate."
3.0,"very lightweight and good glasses, but break easily around the nose-piece--I've had 3 pair"
3.0,"I meant to order black, but by mistake clicked on navy. Great fit, slouchy,  I give it 5 stars. Decided to keep it and get a second one in black. The black came much smaller. Same fabric, but the fit is much worse, will be going back. If the size was the same, it would be a solid 5 star."
3.0,"cute little watch my daughter received as a gift . She loves the camera and build in video camera. However, it came witha<br /> a bad usb cable , unable to download pictures. Not worth if you will pay for it"
3.0,More like 10/11
3.0,"Too small for me & not quite long enough. I'm a tall woman, and it just didn't hit me in the right place worn cross body"
3.0,"it's fine. exactly as described and pictured.  the stone looks darker/deeper when worn on the finger, so definitely keep that in mind.  it's inexpensive so i expect the &#34;gold&#34; to tarnish/fade quickly but so far so good."
3.0,"The color is not as pictured, but still a nice bag."
3.0,"I wear a 40C, and there is just *no* way this is a 40!  I think it might work for a 38C, provided you don't really need the support.  Returning.  They are probably mad at me for this."
3.0,Bought this for my son’s birthday and he loved it. I wish she would hold the air better. I’ve pumped it twice since having it.
3.0,"Seems like a nice protective case, but absolutely no installation instructions included for case or screen protector, which is now useless due to small particles making bubbles in the film. Would be five stars IF I KNEW HOW TO PUT ON THE FILM."
3.0,Is tight on my finger even I order a bigger size
3.0,"lining could be better quality and strap a little longer. Otherwise, a nice purse and would buy again."
3.0,had to bend to fit ear -does fall off easily- looks good on
3.0,"Love them, but it took only about 2 weeks for the bottoms to rub near to off."
3.0,The charm is super cute but the chain is long and the charm is in my cleavage so.only reason I gave three stars no one can see it going to have to put on a different chain
3.0,I love the dog designs and wish there was a bunny set. Bad part some of the bags were sewn haphazardly.
3.0,We used these for an outdoor kids party.  THEY LOVED THEM!!  They fit nicely on fingers and toes!  The parents enjoyed them too!
3.0,"It's okay. The flower off about a week after it came in, but for the price you pay, it isn't too bad."
3.0,"The green ones are so think you can see through them. They're best worn under another pair of shorts, not alone. Unless you want people to see your underwear..."
3.0,nice silicone strap but both bands are way too long for tiny wrists.
3.0,"The Gi itself is serviceable, especially for the price. However, there are 2 problems.<br /><br />1. The uniform is way too big for an A2. Even after a run through the washer and dryer. It still fits but who exactly is coming up with these absurd measurements?<br /><br />2. The gi pants came with the much-needed drawstring on completely backwards. I dont know if im just lucky or of this happens normally. Now I have to go through the annoying process of trying to get it through the holes (lol) because somehow these guys cant make their pants correctly."
3.0,"Boot is flimsy if you have joint issues. If not, it may be the perfect boot for less treacherous winter conditions. It looks good and has enough rubber to keep you dry in puddles. It has comfortable feel putting it on. But for me it is not supporting in the arch area."
3.0,I got the smallest size and it was still to big.  I am a runner and need a bra that is really tight and keeps breasts not moving during the run.
3.0,These pants are so cool! The only thing is there kinda itchy but its made from polyester so i should've expected that. All the funky pants are made with weird fabric!
3.0,The dress is knit so it hugs every thing. it’s a small fit  So I would get a size or even 2 bigger or read the sizing better then I did. I was not expecting it to be great but I was expecting it to fit better then it did. The color was the color shown and  the fabric is a thicker knit so it’s not see through. 🤔 gives me a reason to loss some weight.
3.0,"It is a really pretty anket, the sad thing is that they oxide. The had at first a really nice gold color and now are like a bronze one. Sad..because they are beautifull."
3.0,"The glasses itself are lovely, very good quality. I was just sad to open the package, and there were only two pairs, instead of the stated three."
3.0,"I ordered the 100% cotton sweatshirt (3 times) and it was 85/15, not what I thought/hoped I was getting.  All three are 86ed and being returned."
3.0,It isn't a very soft shirt.  Logo nice and sized as expected
3.0,"The charm had detail and was pretty, but it was much tinier and thinner than expected."
3.0,"Homestly.it was a nice dress but I had to return because of the material, it felt too stiff and not nice at all. But the design and color where beautiful."
3.0,Tight at chest
3.0,Chinese size
3.0,"These earrings are not my favorite. I have multiple pairs of acrylic earrings. I like how lightweight these type of earrings feel.<br />However, this pair of earrings is bulky and not the most comfortable to wear in my opinion.<br />The design and color is cute, but the earrings are too big."
3.0,Does not stay on the nasal bridge. I used a lot of that kind of glasses before . They stay well before .
3.0,Cute swimsuit but definitely runs a little small
3.0,a little tight. i would want even warmer socks.
3.0,Item sizing appears to be incorrect. Ordered a medium which is 38-40. I have a 40 inch chest and their shirt was too tight. Should have purchased large put thought their 42-44 would be too baggy on me. Additionally did not like loose collar on shirt and quality of cotton
3.0,"Thw backings are cheap and uneven, the peongs are big, but they are great for the price"
3.0,"The slippers are cute, but they had to be returned because they run very small. The size 10/11 runs more like in 8/9."
3.0,This will work as a bathing suit cover up but I would not wear it as a dress.
3.0,Comfortable and warm but they’re pulling after a single wear. (I haven’t even washed them yet!)
3.0,"The stones are nice, but some were a bit too small. However I did get 12 pieces to make up for it. I was planning on making necklaces with them but they're a little too small for what I was planning for."
3.0,These are okay. Lo
3.0,"These are good for the price, but they do slip down a little bit for me."
3.0,Very cheap quality. It worked for the one time I needed it. Not sure if it will last more than that
3.0,My legs for circulation
3.0,Too small. For a kid.
3.0,Fit great and worked great for first 2-3 weeks... Then they were just stretched out and barely wearable really.<br /><br />For the price.. Wouldn't repurchase.
3.0,Order a size up. I’m a size C and I definitely feel stifled in the cups. I’m either spilling over or the bra comes up too far and let’s everything fall out the bottom. Wish I had known that before buying.
3.0,Nice red dress. A good staple for holiday events.
3.0,its very beautiful but runs large
3.0,Very cute but it was way too small. Flattened my butt
3.0,Gave it to my daughter because it looks nice on her and just wasn't even close to fitting me.
3.0,Scarfs are not very big
3.0,"This is a nice color, but the fit is a bit small."
3.0,Need to order 1-2 size larger than what you wear.
3.0,They are ok but the backside is rough and will snag clothes
3.0,"I couldn't pass up an inexpensive high-vis long sleeve jersey. I have one pearl izumi long sleeve jersey with sleeves that are too long and to loose. I was hoping this would be a better fit. They got the sleeves right, but for a size small the chest is way too loose. The pockets seem small too but I haven't ridden with it so I'm not sure about that yet"
3.0,Good but little bit larger for my kid. Over all good
3.0,"These are nice heavy fleece sweatpants, not french terry joggers - at least the navy blue ones are. Elastic around the ankle is very snug and I have skinny ankles. Not what I wanted, will be returning."
3.0,"I am 5'10, wear 16 size pants,  and this dress was below the knees, which was very nice. The fabric was a nice fabric, good flow, not too see through, I was very impressed with the fabric. The dress just didn't look great on me. It was too loose in the top. I'm 5'10 and wear a C bra, but the top was too big. I had a bit of fabric loose around the arm pit. It wasn't flattering for my arms or chest. The neck line was much higher than the picture. It was an unflattering line for me, I like to have a lower neckline and wear a tank top underneath. My dress did not come with a tie around, like the picture showed. But it isn't some cheap dress. It didn't work for me, but it would for someone else.<br /><br />Mainly, you need to be bigger on top if you are going to get a larger dress. If you are pear shaped you may drown in the top."
3.0,These are very cute. However the red one came apart within a few days. They are fine for the price though since the other two seem to be ok so far.
3.0,Very pretty but on the heavy side. I would only wear for short periods of time such as an evening event simply due to the weight
3.0,Not the product pictured
3.0,"I like these earrings, but...they do get dirty quick, because it covers so much of your lobe, but my biggest issue is that the black rubber around the circle falls off. Which makes it hard to twist the earring on and also, without the black part, kinda looses its 'gauged' look. I'd look elsewhere for ones that don't have the rubber piece"
3.0,"I really like this dress, but I am petite, and it kind of looks like a sack on me. I washed and dried it, and it fit much better, but it seems like one of those pieces you will only be able to wear so many times."
3.0,"Great value for a ⌚. However, the batteries died in less than a month. Also, the strap was a bit too small and cheaply made"
3.0,Love the comfort great band only issue was magnet came out of the slot had to buy super glue to glue it back
3.0,Hard to adjust tighter after you get it over your wrist
3.0,Too small. I even sized up . Quality was ok !
3.0,"I love the look of these, but super annoying to put on. The latch isn’t easy."
3.0,"Some of them didn't light on, or they were too weak"
3.0,Smaller than regular.
3.0,Color is much brighter than expected. Definitely not the same dress that is pictured. Will work tho
3.0,"Thought I would love this style skirt for my tall child. Actually the the high &low skirt was to long and surprisingly too big in the waist. So you might want to go down a size .  She's 4""9 1/2 and 97lbs."
3.0,The necklace is a lot nicer in the picture than once you see it in person. Don't get me wrong it's still cute but not as pretty as I was expecting.
3.0,Está muy bonito pero llegó en mal estado
3.0,"The material is soft and comfortable. The print is really cute but what I don’t like about this is that it rides up on my ii er thighs so i keep pulling it down and it’s bothersome and unflattering  Im not sure if the size is probably too big, but I don’t think so.  Im 5’2 and weigh 135 I got medium size"
3.0,Earrings kept breaking and I wasn't able to wear them at all.  The necklace was cool and the sunglasses were very hard to see out of.
3.0,"From the looks of the crinkled package and the multiple bar code stickers, it seems like the item I received was a return. I got some of the colors shown but a few of the bands were not the colors I wanted. The bands are okay overall. My issue is if I want it to fit tight around my wrist, I have to adjust it after I slide it over my hand or it will not slide over my hand and its not easy to do one handed.  Even then, the band eventually comes loose over the course of the day.<br />I do like that it's breathable, the rubber watchbands would trap water and cause irritation. Not sure I would purchase again tho."
3.0,"I wanted to love this sports bra. It looks really nice on the model. However, it doesn't really work out well for me. I'm a size 34C and usually wear a medium but sometimes have to size up to a large. I wish I had sized up with this one as it's just a tad tighter than I would like.<br /><br />The fit isn't what bothers me most about this. The first time I used this for running and the bottom rolls up and bunches in the back and the front. I took a picture of this happening in the back but pulled it down for the front. I think I would rather stick with the shorter sports bras or the tanks as the midriff doesn't work for me. I do love the color and the cross straps in the back. The fabric is nice as well."
3.0,Very nice shirt thank you
3.0,Slightly disappointed with this purchase as it is closer to beige than pink and I needed a pink purse. The front pocket is not as white as pictured but more like off-white and it is separated into 2 pockets not 1 as i thought. Notwithstanding it's a beautiful bag. Collapses when you put it to stand and does not have metal feet on base. For that price one would expect at least metal feet and some more sturdiness.
3.0,"Not crazy about it.  The fabric is nice and thick, yes, but very stiff, I thought, right out of the package. The zippers on mine didn't seem to stay in place very well, and it fits oddly. You basically have to zip it all the way down like the model to get it to hang right, which isn't the look I was going for. I'm 5'2, 112, typically a S, but I bought a M to get a slightly oversized look, and I think the S would've been too short but the M was too big in the shoulders (though not in the body, it seems to run very large through the shoulders compared to the rest of it).<br /><br />I'm returning it just because I'm not crazy about it, and I don't think I'd wear it.  Like I said though, it is quite thick, and I think if you glued the zippers, it would look great on the right person. It does seem well made otherwise, no hanging threads or anything."
3.0,Pretty large but a little cheap looking
3.0,"this sweater fits great and is a soft material but smells terrible like chemicals. I haven't washed it but tried laundry spray and put it in the dryer, which didn't help. So I currently can't wear it, I had it hanging for days and now will hang is outside to air out more."
3.0,"The grey is actually shiny silver. It's also not incredibly soft. I bought for my daughter and she said it looked like something a grandma would wear. Not bad, just not for us. The one size also runs small."
3.0,oyk that is all i can say
3.0,"The inner lining is cheap. The zippers not that great..The size to me is perfect. Overall design I like. And the inside pockets could be larger, meaning the newer larger cell phones will not fit in them without falling out. But I am a cat lover and like the purse."
3.0,"The item fit as expected. I wear a medium and it fits like a medium, but I would not call it dress. Its too short for a dress for my taste but I will<br />keep it and wear it with leggings. It also appears to have pockets but it don't. It's pleated to appear as though it has pockets."
3.0,"These are a decent set of flip flops but the soles are chambered and after 6 months of use they are completely blown out. For the price, I cannot really complain but I would have expected them to last at least a year."
3.0,"You could tell this dress was cheap. It was just a big, thin piece of fabric."
3.0,The front roll down
3.0,I think it did what was expected  I needed more support for my problem but it helped.
3.0,Small to medium-sized and quality matches their price
3.0,okay cheaply made
3.0,"They wear out a little too soon, but worked well when I first got them"
3.0,"Ordered then on the 4th, didn't receive them until the 16th. They seem to be of good quality but they're way too small for a man to wear, but that's my own fault for ordering the wrong size (4 mm). They did refund me the shipping which is good, but it would've been better to have heard a reason as to why they took nearly two weeks to arrive."
3.0,"I gave the product 3 stars as a conditional rating, because it is too new and don't know whether it deserves a higher or lower rating.  At first impression the fabric seems a bit flimsy as you can see through it when you pull the socks up.  Based on this observation I get the sneaky suspicion that the socks will not last long, but the jury is still out.  I will come back to this site when and if I have worn them for several months for an update."
3.0,Quite dark and a bit of a squeeze over glasses. Do now wear these while driving at night though
3.0,The dress is completely different from the pic shown......wasn't what I had expected
3.0,It's pretty and stretch he's but not a Woman's size 16 XL. On the smaller side of that spectrum.
3.0,"This appears to be a good band, I bought based primarily on the reviews. But now I know that I can go out and simply look for a 20mm watch band. The next time my focus needs to be size. This band compares in size to the large strap that came with my classic S2, and I'm in search of something smaller. No where in the description could I find actual lens, so when on it out has left overs hanging out. Also it only has one restraining strap in order to mitigate that problem unlike the original strap that came with gear. My intention was to wear the white leather strap as infrequently as possible and have this as a daily commuter. My solution, I cut the leftovers. A bit drastic maybe, but it'll work for now until I find the right strap. My wrist measures 6.5 in around I am 5' 7''."
3.0,Way to big for my face. It’s a nice mask and good material it’s just so large I had to give it to my boyfriend.
3.0,Comfortable with paper mask over it. Be sure to wash it by hand as I used washing machine and now they're all stressed out after two washes.
3.0,The clasp comes undone sometimes but overall it’s pretty good for the price.
3.0,It's a ice hat.  Need to wait until we receive larger size before we can really comment.
3.0,"Sweater is nice. I ordered it for the length but, It is not the same length in the picture, alot shorter. I still kept it because it is really cute and nice quality."
3.0,"Cute, nose pads too noticeable."
3.0,"Fits fine but the straps on the arms ripped within only 4 wears/washes. So, not the most sturdy you can get, that's for sure. Great fit and look though."
3.0,"I was hoping to like this simple tank to wear to barre class.  I was pleased that it wasn't cropped, but it looked too maternity for me.  I returned it."
3.0,Fits well but thin...if you are looking for actual compression/suppresion this wont so it.
3.0,"The buttons are purely for decoration, I wish I could unbutton since the cheat part was so tight. The rest of the dress was super cute"
3.0,Really cute - way too small.  I ordered a size up (I'm usually medium in t shirts and I ordered a large).  I gave it to my 11 year old.
3.0,I ordered 6/7 for my 6 year old daughter. It runs very small. Had to give them away.
3.0,"The rubber bands that attach to arms of glasses seems too loose, tried to tighten then but still didn’t hold properly. I wrapped it around arm twice and still slides"
3.0,Small for the size.  I even ordered a size up and it is very snug.  I like the color though it is darker...maybe a tad more brown than the shade shown in the picture.
3.0,Love the material and the length but it runs smaller than the size online
3.0,"The breast pads in this top were not tacked down, 1/4 of the cup, like it was made for another suit. I will take them out because it looks like you have a dryer sheet left in cups.  I ordered three suits from this category and they all had the same pad issue. No support. Otherwise, this was well worth 20.00"
3.0,They are just ok. Fit very loose on my glasses.
3.0,The purse is a navy blue color. Not black as listed.
3.0,Seems to run<br />Would love them  if they were larger
3.0,"While I'm sure the product is nice, they were too small for my head and really didn't look right for me as a man. The ordering and receiving process went very well"
3.0,Sone loves them!
3.0,"The rose gold ring is very cute, got me lots of compliments. Unfortunately, in had to take it out after 2 weeks because it turned my skin green and made it itch and burn. Maybe it would work for people with less sensitive skin, though i rarely have this problem with ear jewelry."
3.0,"Fit my size. But after I used 1 time, the clothes look terrible. It's not that thick."
3.0,"I absolutely love the look, fit, and quality of the vest and I think the price is pretty reasonable. However, I noticed almost immediately these two little holes in the straps at the bottom in front of the vest and thought it looked rather off. I then looked at the product photo and noticed that my vest is missing the snaps and buckle as shown in the photo. I checked the bag and box thinking maybe it fell off but there was nothing to be found. I am a little upset about this because like I said, the way this thing looks had me very excited and happy with my purchase until I realized it was incomplete. Please, if I could receive the pieces or if someone could help to resolve this problem I will gladly rate it it's very deserving 5 stars.<br /><br />Edit: size is incorrect. It is an X-Large"
3.0,I like the wallet but it sticks inside my pocket it's hard to get in and out
3.0,Comfortable  shirt with CO flag. Definately shrinks with wash.
3.0,"This bra is very comfortable. But because my breast are on the heavy side, I could use a little more support in the cups. The straps are the perfect width and did not dig. With a little more support in the cup and maybe a little more around the band, it would be perfect."
3.0,Love the show but not the glitter. Thought it was fake glitter lol
3.0,Did not come as shown
3.0,"Pro: color just like the picture, the back look amazing, everything stays in place<br />Con: WHATS WRONG WITH THE PADS??? They are rounded and small, the fabric is thin and transparent:( my mom had to add a layer for me to use it (couldn’t imagine when it gets wet)."
3.0,There different sizes only some fit
3.0,"Bueno para el precio, hay que ser cuidadosos porque las piezas se despegan facilmente."
3.0,"Cute top, but a bit too large."
3.0,The product works well but one container came damaged so it’s already drying up. Very disappointing.
3.0,"The dress is very pretty... Too short. You can't bend over at all without showing too much. I returned the dress. The best part was the day I shipped it back, I got my refund. However, Gowntown is the best dress company for larger girls. The sizing was what I expected except for the length."
3.0,This product looks amazing. It is a bit tight on my cheeks and it snapped in half when I was barely holding it… I ended up super gluing it back together for it to work for what I needed it to. I’m not sure if it was cheaply made or if I just maybe got a weak one? Excited to wear it with my costume however… I wish it were a bit wider on the cheek area.<br /><br />You can see in the photo how tight it is. Might be a bit uncomfortable<br /><br />Okay product overall.
3.0,I do love the thickness of these pants.  They are big around the ankle for some reason.  I wish the waistband didn’t bulge my stomach so I look pregnant.  They are tight and thick which matters most to me!
3.0,Color: white<br />5/2021 the fabric is really thick for a summer shirt. It's also pretty short. I've tried to stretch and hang dry but it didn't help.
3.0,"loose fitting...slides around to side of hand, wished it could have been slightly adjustable for better fit...but nonetheless, it still was a great accessory to my costume."
3.0,"I found the fit a little off and they weren’t quite as light as I was hoping for, but they fit in my normal size and are great for fall and spring."
3.0,"The website description says cotton and spandex. Only the top of this dress is cotton and spandex. The skirt is 100% cotton and the fabric feels like a bedsheet. The dress was cute, but the top was too big since I'm very short waisted. I bought two and returning both."
3.0,Bought the dress in green for a wedding. It fit well and looked good. The only annoying thing was I had to keep pulling it down when I was dancing - it kept riding up.
3.0,"I was looking forward to using these for an upcoming trip. But after the first time packing, the mesh has already ripped. The zippers are also very weak."
3.0,I needed to go up a side! My Fupa wasn’t haven that .
3.0,It's a nice wallet. But what came wasn't what was advertised. The picture shows a bi fold that opens up to be a tri fold with two ID windows. My wallet was a simple bi fold with one ID window. It's still a nice looking wallet with lots of space. Some I'll end up keeping it.  Just a little let down that what I was shown to purchase was not what I received.
3.0,"My daughter had a dress up day around Halloween time at school and she went as Elsa. These shoes were perfect for that and she said they were comfortable despite them having a bit of a heel (and she’s very picky and sensitive about her shoes and socks). However, after the first wear the velcro was coming up and after 3-4 wears (at school, nothing crazy) they are almost unusable (see the pictures). I don’t think they will last much longer with the strap like this. It appears the velcro is sewn onto the plastic, however the material of the velcro is so cheap it’s just unraveling and the stitching is doing absolutely nothing. Hopefully I can maybe burn the edges of the velcro and then glue it down but it’s just falling apart. I’ve never had this happen with any of her shoes before."
3.0,Pretty cheap.
3.0,The socks are great but they seemed to be s little worn looking after one use
3.0,"You can see straight through it, but with the right underwear it is fine."
3.0,This is a very pretty dressed. Fit is small I would suggest ordering one size bigger than your normal size.
3.0,Cute just larger than expected. Im 5'3 135 lbs and bought a medium
3.0,"Really small! I bout a large and fit like a size small, so gave it to someone els"
3.0,Looks great but material doesn’t hold up long..
3.0,The moon and sun look pixel-ey…. Low quality picture
3.0,The fabric reminds me of a costume Elsa dress.
3.0,"Great concept, but the fleece material this is made of feels more like felt. I don't anticipate it will last long after washing."
3.0,"quality of decal not that great. It was cracked in places, expected better quality coming from HD store. I am out of time need for Friday so have to keep it"
3.0,"Bought it because I needed a white small, smart looking purse.  After a few weeks of use the strap broke.  Still have it because I am trying to find someone who can stitch the strap."
3.0,"The quality of these breeches is very high.  They look like a nice pair of dress pants, as opposed to stretchier fitted breeches (although I don't mid that).  I also like the rust color, as it's hard to find variety in men's breeches.  The fit is fine, except for the waist, which is quite tight.  I usually wear a 32 in regular pants, and a 34 in breeches (and the 34s usually allow me a bit of extra room and comfort).  I would try to go up to a 36 (if available), but then maybe they would be too baggy elsewhere?  I decided to keep them and just suck in my gut, and also hoping to lose some weight anyway, so maybe they will fit better then?  Finally, why velcro closures at the ankles?  The stretchy sock ends are so much easier and comfortable, and velcro always seems like a cheap solution in most cases, which is antithetical to this higher price range.  Long story short, try a size up from your usual, and hope for the best."
3.0,"Honestly for the price I’m not super unhappy. The size and shape are pretty good, and it’s solidly built. But the paint job on it is pretty spotty and the ribbon is very shiny. The edges were also poorly painted. I should be able to fix this with a new paint job, so I’m not horribly unhappy. But just be warned that the paint job might need some work!"
3.0,"Not a great bra. The fit isn't perfect, and it is somewhat &#34;grandma-like.&#34; I might sleep in it, I might throw it out."
3.0,Way smaller than expected still cute
3.0,They are really pretty. My only suggestion is to make sure your piercing is the same spot on both ears. These didn't lay the same on my ears. It might not have been noticeable to others but I was aware so I worried about it since my hair was up. I think next time I wear them I will just let them hang down or leave my hair down.
3.0,"Love this little watch, is perfect for pulling together a work outfit. I only wore it about 5 times before noticing a huge crack down the screen :("
3.0,It is a beautiful scarf but is smaller than I thought.
3.0,Super cute. And after reading the reviews I ordered two sizes larger than usual. I ordered a 4x instead of a 2x. It fits fine but ITS NOT A DRESS!! It come right to my thigh! It'll be cute with leggings during fall!
3.0,"This dress is definitely designed to be flattering on a skinny figure. As a curvy lady with C cup boobs, this dress adds 20 lbs and makes me look pregnant. It is NOT flattering at all on my 5'7/180 lb frame. I should have returned it but instead will be donating it."
3.0,Received today & is very pretty but is not made for teen or small wrist is still to big!
3.0,Is a good product but it takes way too long to ship. I will buy more but it takes so long I even forgot I order them.
3.0,The back string is made for smaller people. It hardly reaches behind my back and I’m only a size 38 in pants. It would be nice to have a longer string on these Aprons this way it’s a true one size fits most..
3.0,Cute shoe but the size runs very small.
3.0,Really pretty.  The band is tiny and warped/bent  the first time the top piece on my clothes.  Way to delicate to be active in
3.0,"The shorts pooch outa little on the sides just below the waist on the side seam, just a. little less would be ideal."
3.0,"Material wasn't good had a snag in the dress, wanted to wear it to church"
3.0,The pockets were not stitched from the inside so it was open and couldn’t hold anything
3.0,The material is really soft and it fits really nice but not for heavy workout days when you will be sweating a lot. It doesn’t look as bad in the picture because it was already drying but it was very noticeable during my workout.
3.0,Ok for UV or wind protection.  But I bought it for compression and it's too loose for that.  I recommend trying something like this on before purchase.
3.0,My husband says there is an excess of lint inside these socks that isn’t improving with laundering. Far more than Hanes brand.
3.0,Totally fine but somewhat granny-panty fitting
3.0,Smaller than expected. Good for small suitcase.
3.0,"Material not as &#34;flowing&#34; as I anticipated in a maxi skirt. I like a bit softer and free-flowing material, that's just my tastes.  The colors are great"
3.0,The top is cute but way too big. I'm going to have it altered.<br />Too long in length and in the sleeves.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed due to the fabric quality. It was also super static-y. I think it's cute, and I will use it but i'll need to give it a good wash first to see if it feels better. It fits a bit small for my taste.... but I could still ware it."
3.0,Its thin enough you to wear under your bicycle helmet.<br /><br />I hand washed these soon as i got it. it took me 'wash with soap and rinse' x 15 times until black ink color didn't come out.<br />DO NOT wash with other clothing if you are going to put it in the washer. you will have purple look on your bright color clothes.
3.0,"I wanted to love her, but she stopped above my ankles.  #TallGirlProblems"
3.0,Some where cute but over half were missing from the package. Make sure you count them. Two broke right off.
3.0,the colors aren't as bright as I would have liked.
3.0,"The ring itself was very smooth and looked nice on my finger, but i found that as someone who enjoys absentmindedly playing with my ring, that the spinning part was too fast, and it did not really feel like i was spinning anything at all.<br /><br />Disclaimer: While i was given this product at a discount in return for my review, every opinion on this product was given honestly and fairly.

3.0,Was a tad bit thin for my taste. But okay.
3.0,"This top is so cute!  But, I used the sizing chart and ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it is still too small.  I normally wear med to small in US clothing, so I ordered large.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 138lbs.  An extra-large may work, but its not worth the trouble to exchange it.  Maybe I can wear it when I loose 10lbs!"
3.0,"Package arrived neatly packaged, true to color and description.  I ordered a bigger size, I am a womens 2xl and ordered 4xl.  It was way to small.  Fit like a belly shirt and got stuck in it.  To save from returning, I gave to my 9 year old granddaughter who put it on and it fit snug.  Hope it doesn't shrink when washed."
3.0,OK not the best quality
3.0,It is cute but hard to close and the strap keeps coming unhooked
3.0,"The dress I received did not compare to the picture.  The v-neck was not as deep and the straps were very wide... I was disappointed, but not enough so to send the dress back.<br />It is very comfortable very breathable but the dress is heavier then I expected and the top does not look anything like the picture."
3.0,"The first try-on of this bottom I heard many stitches popping as I stretched it to pull on my body. I chose the size recommended by the size chart and it fits, but it is not as comfortable as other items I have tried.  I worry about the stitching when I hear that stretching popping snapping of thread when pulling it up or down. especially for an item that might be subject to harsh pool chemicals and sunlight.<br />It fit snugly and since I have a curvier figure it was not as comfy on my thighs as other bottoms."
3.0,Cute sneakers but my daughter could not get her feet in them. They don't stretch much and she has a slightly wide foot
3.0,"I liked this but the material it's made out of is quite flimsy, and not the strongest, however, they do protect my eyes are are very cute."
3.0,The tshirts were cute but to small.
3.0,"They are cute, but I've had them for like 2 months and they're already starting to stretch out and fall apart. I was hoping for something a bit more durable. Doubt they'll survive a washing."
3.0,"It moves too much, getting a smaller size"
3.0,They are too big and stretch toouch.
3.0,"Cute, but the sewing was coming apart. Also very long."
3.0,"These are nice a comfortable.  When I order these again I plan to get a smaller size and I think they will work much better. I bought the bright blue pair, very pretty."
3.0,I liked the material but size small fit just a little big wish you guys would add a size xs
3.0,The dress itself is cute! I love the look of it and the straps are flattering on the sides however it’s itchy and the material is not comfortable. The neck part doesn’t stretch when you put it on and it’s super tight to your neck. I love how it looks but I cannot wear that itchy material out. Will be returning :(
3.0,This type of blouse should fit with room but this one was not true to size - much too large
3.0,Thr one i received does not look like the one in the picture.  In the picture the ruffle is slanted and made of different material than the one I got.
3.0,Order up. I am sad they are tight on my butt and thighs.
3.0,"Loved the style of of this dress. So pretty. Really wish it would have fit. I'm 5'6&#34;, 155lbs, got an XL. Too small. Material a bit thin. Would look gorgeous on a smaller woman."
3.0,This would best fit someone with a b size and up cup.
3.0,I ordered 3 from the same site and this one was bigger than the others.
3.0,The picture makes it look like it will be long but it is actually a very short skirt. I would say &#34;mini&#34; is correctly stated. I thought that it would fit longer but this wasn't nowhere near midthigh and for a child that is extremely too short (in my opinion).
3.0,"Slipper was good color but it just fit loose on my foot, made for trip hazard Thank you I'll keep trying"
3.0,The item did not come with the flower case.
3.0,Nice piece! Looks larger in photo
3.0,"Works fine but on mine the mesh is not straight on one side which makes it curve funny and also looks less than ideal.  Clasp works well, resizing was not too difficult.  Bracelet was good length with only about 1 inch excess length which just lays inside the outer part of bracelet.<br /><br />Also, the pictured watch tool was not included with my bracelet."
3.0,Looks cheap. Won’t buy again
3.0,Hard to clasp.
3.0,Love the look and feel of these. My issue is the slippery zipper and the seams by the zipper started to unravel after one wear.
3.0,I ordered a small but found the top portion to be ill fitting so I will be returning for a medium.
3.0,These are not Footjoy's best shoe with regard to comfort.  They are stiff and do not want to &#34;fit the foot&#34;.  Can use as long as I am riding i a golf cart but would not walk the course in them.  Waterproofing is good and traction is good.  Would not buy another pair of this model.
3.0,"pourly constructed band makes lots of noise so dont expect alot plus the luner clock is a joke, it only tracks a quarter moon, not all phases of the moon."
3.0,"I love it, but the round magnet came of.  In the process of purchasing a new one."
3.0,I should have likely read a little deeper on this.  They are cute but you can't really read them as they are too small.  Nice though.
3.0,I normally love and get a great for but this one did not for well . The arms were tight and the body too big. I always wear medium in Patty 's Boutique clothing. I had to return this item
3.0,"Wife wore it for Super Hero event,too snug"
3.0,Because I have a larger chest it hung oddly in the front 5
3.0,"It is really cute, but it's cut a bit short. I am only 5'2 and it's a tight fit. I am smaller chested, which makes it OKAY to wear, if you need more room up top, its going to fit unconformably. I am usually a medium, so i ordered a large, and still am not 100% I will attempt to wear this in public."
3.0,"Looks good, but only holds small picks, not normal sized ones."
3.0,"This purse is very small and the handles do not look like this they are all curled up from the packing materials,"
3.0,"Great price, but quality was not what I was expecting. When I got the luggage straps in the mail they were not individually packaged but wrapped with rubber bands.  One strap broke right away at the airport.  The plastic buckle broke and would not close after that. I ended up throwing it away. The other three held up but I was disappointed that one broke before the start of our trip. In retrospect, I would have paid a little bit more for more durable straps. Lesson learned."
3.0,They are very nice and pretty bit too heavy to wear for my daughter
3.0,"The set wasn't as I expected.  It was OK, but the tote wasn't lined (not sure if it showed it was lined in the photo), and the quality was just OK.  I returned it."
3.0,"thank you to everyone who writes a review, because of other reviews,  i ordered 1 sizes bigger and it fit perfect, i normally wear a medium, Here's my measurement 5'3, 126lbs, with a 29 jeans size.  However i ended up returning because the top of the dress didnt fit well, my boobs wasnt big enough to fill in so the material hanged.  The dress stretches and maybe a smaller size would have help.  Also the print is in the material. i wouldve like it to be foil print but its my preference."
3.0,This pair of shoes were too small and too narrow. Based on the prior reviews I thought they would work for my father . They didn’t.
3.0,Inexpensive set of driving glasses. Not great construction or material but good for the price.<br /><br />Update: After some good use I have revised my rating from 5* to 3*. I have found that the coating chips off very easily leaving clear glass specs which are annoying when you have them on. Also rubber has softened up on the deal and moves freely. Not so much a barging if it only lasts a couple of years.
3.0,"This shirt compared to other Sport-tek products runs quite large.  I ordered one as a sample for a possible servers uniform for a restaurant.  The girls all decided that it was too thin, and they would all have to wear something underneath.  While the fabric was nice and lightweight, and the shirt comfortable, it did not look very good on anybody that tried it on.  A girl who wore a large in another sport-tek shirt was drowning in the large we ordered.  The pink appears slightly lighter than pictured, and is not able to be worn as a single layer.  While the shirt appears to be flattering and slimming on the model, the shirt appeared boxier in person, and the side panels were not flattering at all.  We returned and ordered something else for our crew."
3.0,Didn’t like the material but dang it’s cute! I love what they did with it but wish the material was a little more classy.
3.0,Battery only lasted 6 months.
3.0,"Took EXTRA long to receive... I actually forgot I ordered it... Didnt realize it was shipping from China....I ordered a XL because after reading other reviews it stated the shirt ran small.  A Large would of been OK.  Also the shirt is thin, I need for a Job and didnt want to spend alot on something really nice so this will do just fine!!"
3.0,I wasn't crazy about the material and it came very wrinkled.  I bought the shirt in light blue and it has white writing which barely shows up.  My daughter in law raises chickens and she liked the shirt.  I just wish it was better quality.
3.0,stone caused me to return it was too pink. but it was a quality product.
3.0,"Returned, not my style."
3.0,These are nice leggings. I have washed them and the fuzzy inside kept form. The size is small. I wear a US size 6 and theses are very tight on my thighs.
3.0,Little less quality than I expected but it’s not bad
3.0,"Isn't what I expected but, still use them!"
3.0,Its a cute dress but it looked really big on me.
3.0,"I didn't really need so many extenders. I would have rather had half for half the price. Other than that, they are fine."
3.0,"Speck of white on an red area, however, overall, nice look!"
3.0,"Not awesome bc hey run a tad small,  but still good quality."
3.0,Arrived with part of the strap around the middle hanging off that some hot clue will fix. For the price does the job for a child's costume needs to wear for a few hours.
3.0,"Size is greate .  I will be using it next week.  The zipper is not strong ,and I have to struggle  a little to open and close . I ordered for the size to fit under the seat so will see how that goes."
3.0,"Not what I add looking for, so I returned it."
3.0,Just ok.  The material is a little cheap feeling and I'll fitting.  The pockets are a little too heavy causing the sweater to droop in an unflattering way.  I'm going to keep it only because I don't feel like going through the return hassle.  I may just get the pockets tailored to be sewn closed. Maybe that will help. Definitely won't purchase another.
3.0,Just average; nice for a small gift or stocking &#34;stuffe&#34; or in an Easter basket.
3.0,"This sweater runs very small so if you order it, order at least one to two sizes bigger than normal.  I ordered an XL which normally fit very well and this fits like it is a medium.  I'll keep it as returning it is too much of a hassle and it was not expensive.  The quality of the material is very nice."
3.0,One of the two bands broke after 1 day of use. Overall the look of the bands is nice and they're comfortable but I'm concerned how long my second band will last.
3.0,Fits good except I prefer the waist to be loose fitting not snug but overall I like this sweatshirt.
3.0,"Given the low cost of this item, it will work for what I need. It is folded several times in the packaging and the creases are visible. It does not affect the function of the hat. I soaked it in water and layed flat to dry. It still had creases as my picture shows.<br />The material used is odd. It's more like thick paper than fabric. I wouldn't expect any heavy duty wear from this. But for the casual activities I bought it for, I think it will work.<br />The fit is good for an average size head, and has an adjustable strap in the back to cinch in a bit.<br />The ""watermelon red"" is more pink than red."
3.0,"I bought this for a costume party and it's a cute dress. I ordered per the size chart and even up 1 size so it would have some flow. Well, I typically wear a 12, I ordered the 14 and couldn't even put it on! This runs small! I will try 2 more sizes up since it's free shipping both ways and the dress itself is cute for the price"
3.0,"This is cut weird. It feels like it was made for a big petite person with a small torso, if that makes any sense. But it is comfy, and I LOVE the pattern."
3.0,"It's not a skinny pants. I'd say, it's more of a straight leg. I really like the way the jeans was cut in the picture cuz it adds an interesting detail to an otherwise basic jean. However, it is  too long for me (5'2). It's shapeless and it looks more a boyfriend jean than skinny. To salvage it, I had to fold it which defeats the main reason why I bought it. Delayed shipping too."
3.0,"Too heavy for my ears. I have a torn hole & they didn't work for me. If you have no damage to your piercing, they would work fine."
3.0,"after about a handful of times wearing it, the seam ripped. It does fit true to size and it is super cute but it just doesn’t stay together. I only washed the cardigan like twice and always hung dried it. I never put it through a dryer."
3.0,Cute but run VERY small.
3.0,"The band color is nice, but it’s very uncomfortable at times. It had left marks on my hands and when I loosen it it doesn’t stay in the right place and moves on my wrist which is annoying. I have marks still on my skin from the band even when it’s not too tight and it itches."
3.0,"Very short, and see-through thin material"
3.0,This was more like a T-shirt material than a sweater. I thought I was getting something more like a sweater material or something thick. This is pretty thin and I feel that it needs a cami under it. It’s still cute. But it’s not something that I feel could be dressed up too much. The material is thin and works well in the summer
3.0,The magnet that holds the Flex 2 compartment in place on the bracelet is very weak.  I am afraid I will lose the flex 2 if I am not careful.
3.0,The sizing is not correct it ran a lot bigger than expected. Very cute simple little dress that would be dressed up to be quite fancy or down for a nice dinner. Unfortunately I had to return it so to sizing. The straps are very long.
3.0,"The elastic in these is wide and very strong making them uncomfortable to wear. I've tried stretching out the elastic but doesn't seem to help. Besides the elastic the shorts are rather large/loose to the point that both legs may be able to fit in a single leg hole. The shorts are easily to put on over my walking boot (broken leg), but then the elastic makes it hard to put my good leg in afterwards. I'm thinking about either cutting a slit into the elastic band or removing the elastic band entirely and replacing with a more comfortable one.  It almost seems like these are made as one size fits all shorts. For reference I'm 5'9"" 30"" waist, 39"" hips."
3.0,"Pretty bracelet, but a bit too flexible - but then again maybe that's the idea.. I like it all the same."
3.0,"Product is good quality for the price. However, the photo does not match the actual band I received"
3.0,"Looks great, think size was off on mine. I wear L/XL in all my hooey flex fit and this one was crazy over sized for my head."
3.0,For the Hem to be sewn
3.0,I would recommend them.  My father just did not like them. They fit differently from what he usually wears. He refused to wear them.
3.0,Looks good not ideal for ppl who are short sighted
3.0,Beautiful design.  Fits well.  Material looks cheap so I can not wear it except to got shopping.
3.0,"I'll start off by saying that I'm the type of person that is ALWAYS wearing sunglasses.  I mean always, even at night.  I just do.  With that said, I'm also the type of person that has BAD tanlines on the sides of my head from wearing suglasses at all times.  I thought buying these glasses would take care of the problem, at least for the most part.  Anyway, who wouldn't want glasses like Morpheus?  Obviously not the point here.  The point is however that even though these glasses are pretty cool looking, they aren't quite what you'd expect.  The lenses are polycorbonate and work real well in the sunlight, but, they don't appear to be made too well.  This is one case where you are mainly paying for the name, not the product.  I don't mean to comnpletely talk badly here, I am pleased, just not completely.  My main problem here is that these glasses are made in such a way that people such as myself with a wide head should not be wearing glasses such as these.  They look as if they were made for either children or people with really skinny heads.  Really skinny.  After putting them on you get the sensation that your head was pinched in the middle and all your features were pulled into the middle.  Kind of funny really.  So, the breakdown is that this product is cool, definitely cool, but, probably not worth 30.00...  what else can be said?  Just keep in mind, if you have a large head or a wide head, you will look kind of funny.  These glasses do look the same as the ones in the Matrix, but, apparently big headed Fishburn had a style that was made for his large head.  Enjoy."
3.0,"Top is adjustable as you tie where you want it. Bottoms were on the big size, but as a seamstress, I can adjust fairly quickly. It certainly looks better in the picture though than it looks on me."
3.0,After one trip the handle was broken and my bag arrived without the wheels. It is a very cheap product and you will have what you pay. I need a replacement wheels but I can't get them or contact the vendor for a replacement part.
3.0,a button came off on the first one it's just a glue on the snaps
3.0,"These ""reefs"" are as illustrated, but for the price which is about the same as the last pair, the construction lacks the overall cushioning  and so it would seem,quality.  They are ""just sandals"" after all, but my old pair seemed constructed with an eye to durability I am not sure this would fulfill.  i am disappointed."
3.0,"Pretty, but clasp broke 2nd day 😡"
3.0,"Fit okay. Not much breast support and the sides go very low, I felt too exposed to wear in public."
3.0,"When I ordered this pendant, I knew Kokopelli was ""the trickster,"" but I didn't know he is also the fertility deity.  Guys (and gals), if you didn't know this, you are now forewarned!<br /><br />I am not very happy with this pendant, the third of three I ordered at the same time (Dan's Jewelers).  It's well done, and the colors are great, but the pendant is so lightweight that it won't even pull the sting straight.  I'll find some use for it, but it won't be for hanging around my neck.  Cool design, but it needs a little heft to make it a practical pendant purchase.  Hear that, Dan?"
3.0,BEautiful top with wonderful fit.  Only thing it doesn't have the beautiful cut on the bottom as shown in the picture.
3.0,"I have two key ring attachments I got with an Infiniti back in 2008, and they work incredibly well - they sit well in my pocket, and the quick release allows me to quickly remove my keys from the ring when I need to leave my keys when parking or having the car serviced.  I traded in my Infiniti in 2012, but I kept the Infiniti key rings and moved them to the key fobs of new cars I bought since then. We have 3 cars, each with 2 key fobs, and I would like to have a total of 6 key rings that work as well as the Infiniti rings.  I bought this set of 2 key rings (and a set of a different type of key ring) to see if either one would work as well as my old Infiniti key rings.  This was clearly the better of the two types I bought, especially since the leather wrap can be removed so it can wrap through the loop at the end of a key fob.  But I have two concerns.  The first is that the leather wrap is a little too wide for the wider of the key fobs for my other cars and I had to cut it a little to squeeze it through one of the key fobs (it's way too wide to even cut for the other).  Second, when I put the screws back in after removing the leather wrap, it doesn't seem that they tighten very well.  Hopefully, they will last for a while."
3.0,cheap material. cute but smaller and shorter than expected. would’ve ordered a size up
3.0,"Cute! But super huge, like mondo, but this is partly my fault because I had ordered an XL in prime as it was the only one available. The stomach portion pretty much touches my knees."
3.0,My husband loved this watch and just what he wanted but the pin kept popping out and band wouldn't stay together.
3.0,"Super cute and functional, but lasted 3 months and then the zipper blew. Disappointing because I loved it while I could use it!"
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty, they were smaller then I expected them to be. They are a little cheap but I think if you're careful with them I think they're fine"
3.0,I like wearing these when I walk because it provided the necessary support and my feet and calves are not as tired.<br />It definitely helped with numbness as well.  A great item to have if you’re diabetic as well. The only downside is that they are not as long as I would have liked.
3.0,"Great drinking shirt, needs a brewing name on it!"
3.0,It thicker and heavier then I like it's ok
3.0,Very cheap material. Probably cheaper than Forever 21 material. I would find something similar at the 5.99 store. Wore it once.. but dont feel very pretty in it.
3.0,"I am a true size 8 and this was probably a 4 or 6. I was pissed because I planned on wearing it to an event the next day, but I should have planned better.  The material and color are like the photo. It's absolutely beautiful. Go up a size!"
3.0,"What can I say? If you can get this product to fit your phone, then I think you will like it a lot. It is made out of a nice black metal chain and looks very sturdy and of good quality. Unfortunately, I was not able to make it fit my Samsung Gear S3. It seems that at the end of the band the width of the metal links increases and it cannot fit into the pin holes in the Gear S3. I wonder if the gear S3 has changed since last year and the width has become smaller for the pins? I find this to be unlikely, but it is possible. I had to return the product since it didn't fit so be careful if you are buying it for the Samsung Gear S3 as it will very likely not fit."
3.0,the material was a bit too thin and not what i expected. Cute shirt otherwise
3.0,"I have to be honest, the necklace did not glow hardly at all. I wasn't very impressed with the chain either. I did give it 3 stars for having a light glowing effect, but 3 stars was really pushing it. My daughter was disappointed that it just looked like light glitter in a small jar, but decided to wear it anyways with her fairy costume. If you don't care if it glows much, then it suffices as a unique looking necklace."
3.0,"TL/DR: Pins need to be longer/thicker and have a better locking mechanism on them. Plastic needs to be of better quality.<br /><br />Really wanted to love this product. It's comfortable on my wrist and is perfect when you're ""between sizes"" on a standard watch band with notches. But this product lasted me a little over 10 days. For starters, the locking pin is thin and flimsy. On more than one occasion the pin would unlock and the watch would just fall off. Today, I went to adjust the watch because I had an itch and the plastic piece broke clean off. Returning for a refund because I am not confident that, at only $8, a replacement will be any better."
3.0,I wear a US M. Bought XL to fit.
3.0,I purchased these as little Christmas gifts for children I teach.  They LOVED them as I figured they would.  I would recommend this for ages 5 and over.
3.0,"All good except for one pin, which was missing a significant portion of the crow's beak."
3.0,"Not very durable. Cute, but didn’t hold up well."
3.0,"Really pretty however, one of the stones fell out within a week, a little disappointed"
3.0,Beautiful! But the chain is broken. I’ll just use a chain I already have.
3.0,"The material is warm, but the elastic waistband is too tight. I bought size M and it looks baggy and too long, size S for 5'1"" should be better."
3.0,They are comfortable and lightweight… but I’ve only work a few times and a seam already needs sewed up. Ugh
3.0,"These were so inexpensive that I took the chance and ordered them. They are very cute, but they are NOT real leather. It's a decent faux leather, soft and thick, but clearly not leather. Very simple shoe with velcro closure and rounded toe. They fit a bit wide on my daughter but she has slim to normal feet. I ordered her current size and they fit just right with a bit of growing room. Would be an adorable first walker shoe for babies. Easy to wipe clean. Not too terrible for the price!"
3.0,"I love the color and the stone itself, but it was to small. Do you have it in a bigger size? I need several for the women in our church."
3.0,"A brunch dress, for me. Too irreverent to wear to work, to ice to wear casually. If you have a larger bust, the placket will need some extra reinforcing to stay closed."
3.0,Seems to be a long satin ribbon though nicely hemmed as a belt.  It's shiny.
3.0,Lots of earrings for the money
3.0,Picture was misguiding. Product was cheaply made but for the price I can't complain.
3.0,Mask seems great and sturdy but it only came with 1 black filter. Very disappointed as I have to purchase separately.
3.0,Skirt was very similar to the picture. Very professional looking I like the length. The fabric was nice. But it ran small and very narrow.
3.0,"The material is so so, not super high quality, but very stretchy. The stretchiness would be great if the crotch area wasn't super funky. An immediate camel foot, not a toe, but the whole foot.  Sort of like boxer briefs packaging the groin area. I don't need another coin purse.  I think that may be because the size fits small. Not in the legs by any means the legs are wide and flowy as expected, but the waist, which might pull the seams at this sew design causing this undesired effect. Maybe a size larger would help, but I'm not going to experiment this time. Item to be returned."
3.0,"The design and color of the shirt are beautiful, but this runs WAAAAAAAY too small. I was looking for that loose, flowy fit as show in the photo; not what I got. I normally wear an XL so I ordered an XXXL and it was still tight on me. If you want a tighter fitting shirt then its great, but if you want a flowy fit, order about 4 sizes up."
3.0,"I purchased these earrings for myself because I lost an earring and wanted something inexpensive to fill my second piercing. What I liked was the price and the onyx stone was what I was looking for.  However, they are a bit fatter in thickness than I would have liked and heavier in the sense that if you don't put the backing on tight, it will hang awkwardly on the lobe. They are good for the price and for everyday wear."
3.0,Nice color but a little small
3.0,"Cute, well made for price but awkward fit.....I assume the model in the  pic must be right at ft tall.<br />Ordered an XL. I'm 5'5 generally wear an 8/10 dress size 30 pant size L top size. 36C.<br />It's high cut and very cheeky which is as pictured but even with my short torso and it was barely to get the cups high enough to cover my bust. The side boob was expected but I the very top of the triangle barely made it safe for public :) I usually have the opposite problem with 1 piece swimwear being to long but not this one.<br />I have never had a problem with VS or Pink swimwear in a L 36/C fitting for reference."
3.0,shorts are on the small side. could be cut better
3.0,The shorts are nice. Run very small. I wear a 4-6. These small are more like 2 on me.  I may need xl in this style.Ordered a M I wear a size 4-6. Legs still tight at knee. Not comfortable and very ill fitting. Runs very very small.
3.0,"love the way it looks, but.....the beige is starting to rub off after a week wearing it....this is the only thing wrong with it"
3.0,"I like these but they are very bulky and didn't come with instructions. The knife, or what I assume is the knife part, is very full. The compass, I'm not sure of it's accuracy.<br /><br />The whistle is better than expected and very loud. The SOS light is perfect.<br /><br />I have not had to use it yet but I'm keeping it close while traveling. Hopefully it comes in handy. Or hopefully I'll never need to use it lol."
3.0,I have a 35 inch waist and don't like tight fitting clothes.  The large (36-38) were a little tight around the waist for me.
3.0,"Be aware, read everything. I thought this was sold as a pair like most; but this is for a single item. Nice jewellery though. I ordered the second to have a pair."
3.0,"Was a little to large, although size chart indicated they would fit right. Also a little cheaper material than the Teslo brand I usually purchase."
3.0,A little to big and some where heavy
3.0,"pretty cheep looking, but it soft and comfy."
3.0,"Maybe because the size is off - these definitely don't fit like a small - they always slide off my legs, even when I turn the hem over the boots. In just 50 ft they will gather under my heels. Frustrating."
3.0,"The glasses were not very good quality but for the price, I guess it was ok. My son liked them, even though the frame and the lens came apart really quickly. It came with a small pouch, and that was nice to have as my son normally would just throw the glasses in his bag."
3.0,"Love the colors, but the Velcro pocket in the front is really odd.  Especially for a man."
3.0,"After a few washes, the material is fading away."
3.0,"I like quite a bit about these cycling gloves, but they really do not work for me. I usually have my thumb and hand around the brake horns (old skool non-shifters) or over the horns with the palm on top of the horns.<br /><br />What I like - Materials, Construction, and Finger Pulls<br />Stitching is generally good and the materials are good. The terrycloth and mesh have their ends stitched to prevent fraying. Unfortunately, my pair already has one of the stitches coming apart after a single 1-hr ride. Unlucky on my part because the rest of the stitching looks good. (see picture)<br /><br />Meh - They fit loose, especially the palm, which I think is due to the mesh vent in the middle of the palm.<br /><br />Dislike intensely - Padding<br />The padding is not suitable for road cycling. The padding is WAY too thin and does not cover the areas that actually need padding (the thumb pad on the palm and the ""V"" between the thumb and the rest of the hand). These gloves did nothing to reduce the pressure at those 2 points. (see picture)."
3.0,Check details on size chart
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress. The dress fit fine, but the straps were very oddly constructed/placed forcing the dress to lay incorrectly. I would not recommend this item; I may have just received a dud, but I could not salvage the dress after attempts to alter it to make the top lay correctly."
3.0,"Honestly, I really just returned this because my fiancé was interested in a different style and had a specific one in mind. I didn’t really get to try out the product, but it was a little big."
3.0,it fits fine but the material is not as expected.
3.0,That shoulder strap stitching failed about the 6th time I used it. I fixed it myself. But I won’t buy this again.
3.0,They are just okay.  I thought they would be sturdier for real cleaning.  They feel squishy.
3.0,"The Charms are super cute and match the picture. Only reason I gave 3 stars is due to the chain. They should have options on length and provide a chain that is not flimsy. Once we bought decent chains, they became perfect. We both wear them 24/7."
3.0,Chest area runs very small. Made decently for the price otherwise.
3.0,"The fabric was very soft, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was lined, but this dress was not quite what I was expecting.<br /><br />On me, 34 DD, the waist line hit more where an empire cut would normally be rather than a natural waist as shown in the images.  Also, the cut of the skirt is a much narrower A-line than it appears in the image.  If you have hips and/or a booty, this likely is going to cling in all the wrong places.<br /><br />Beautiful garment, great price, just not as flattering as it looks in the pictures."
3.0,Expected backs to be more sturdy. Earrings hang off ear a little.  Need to constantly reposition backs.
3.0,Fabric is so thin and the dress is just made poorly...
3.0,"This dress is cute, good length. A bit to small for me. Great price though."
3.0,Not crazy about fit...probably needed a size smaller
3.0,I purchased two of the pink hats. They arrived quickly and feel like decent quality. Only disappointment was each hat had markings on them which made them come across dirty or used. Since the hats were purchased just for play and were fairly cheap I'm willing to deal with it.
3.0,You should mail out what you advertise.
3.0,This shirt was really nice. I liked the patteren and the fabric was cotton like. But here's the ketch even though it says Big & Tall.. nope nowhere near that. These sizes run really small. I didn't expect it to fit so small since it was suppose to fit big and tall people right. Well not even close I got an XXL hoping it would be big but it was more like a small. Unless your really skinny this could fit you.  I am 6'0 and 190. This shirt should be more of a super slim fit.
3.0,This shirt is cute and lightweight the only thing I didn't like about it was how far up it went in the front and how long the straps are making it almost impossible to wear by itself if you have a bigger bust.
3.0,"The coat is light and long enough for chilly weather like Spring or Fall. I'm 5', 100 lbs and the coat bottom just passes below my knees. This coat is size M, it seems like S might be even fitter for me. The material is a bit rough, I'll probably have long sleeves underneath while wearing the coat.<br />The string at the waist holds it well if it gets windier outside. The coat do have pockets but it was completely sewed up, I guess if I really like pockets I can slowly cut the entrance open for the two pockets. From inside, the pockets look deep enough for fit phones or short wallet just fine."
3.0,Frays easily
3.0,The strap came off in few weeks
3.0,Not what I thought they would be. Really thick and tough.
3.0,I have many of these La Cera dresses but this one is particularly large and long. I have purchased my other dresses from other vendors with no problem.
3.0,Bag was smaller than I expected.  Mom loved it as a gift.
3.0,They don't do much for night driving.
3.0,The design is so cute!! But I ordered am XL so I could wear it to work and it be a little bigger sense I usually wear a Large. The XL is too short and tight. It fit me like a medium. I am 5'2 and 185lbs. Giving it to my mom sense she is a little smalled then me.
3.0,Me vinieron 90 aros me faltaron porque dice que son 110
3.0,Great idea. Bag is very cheaply made
3.0,They’re cute but no peripheral protection so there’s considerable glare
3.0,3 star due to chain does not fit on the hello kitty pendant. I have to use some pliers on the chain to make it fit to hold it.<br />If chain was properly size or pendant I will have give 5 stars.
3.0,If you have big boobs this suit is NOT for you. No support
3.0,It's ok it will get the job done
3.0,Not real happy with the bow on the back
3.0,The color was good.  The shirt is heavy and uncomfortable.  Too warm
3.0,"These did not work for my husband as he did not like the fit.  They run small, so you may need to size up which may help the issue.  He said they were ok for wearing around the house, but still not as comfortable as he would like."
3.0,Material is thin... jacket is flimsy.  Don't expect any lining... ok with slip
3.0,I bought this watch band for my son's Gizmo. I had to cut a hole in the strap to be able to charge his watch without having to take it apart everyday.
3.0,Simple. Dainty. Shiny.<br />Love it!<br /><br />Changed my rating from a 5 to a 3 because one of the stones fell out a week after :(
3.0,"There was nothing wrong with the bra itself. It was just too small on me. I am a 36B with under bust measurement of 32, that was with a deep breath, and got a medium. Which is what they recommend.  I probably should have gone for a large or Xlarge. \<br /><br />The cut is cute and the material was soft. If you are gonna get it just size up one."
3.0,"I've ordered a few of these scarf-like blouses and I like them.  But the way this one was cut, gave me a very boxy appearance.  It wasn't flattering.  I'll keep it to wear around the house.  I bought it to wear to work, but it's not flattering enough to wear there."
3.0,"This ""briefcase"" is really more like a messenger bag in that it is made of canvas and is, therefore, quite flexible and not rigid (except on the bottom to help maintain the general shape of the bag). This shouldn't be surprising from the product's description, but I just wanted to point it out. This also makes it look a bit more casual, but it's a step up from an actual messenger bag and costs significantly less than more typical briefcases.<br /><br />I've had the bag for five months, and it has held up decently well. It works great for lighter items (portfolios/folders, papers, paperback books, etc), and I've carried heavier items (eight-year-old laptop that feels like it's solid lead, a couple hardcover textbooks, and so on) without much problem, although the shoulder strap seems to be slowly detaching from the bag on one end. I imagine I wouldn't have had this problem if I stuck to lighter loads. (Be warned, loading too much can also make it puff out at the sides and lose the ""briefcase"" shape.) I'll summarize the pros and cons from my experience:<br /><br />PROS<br />* Price: probably among the least expensive ""briefcases"" you'll find, although keep in mind that it might look more like a bag.<br />* Three divided compartments inside (including holders for pens and pencils) and an outside pocket provide plenty of space and organization<br />* Includes detachable shoulder strap in addition to handles, so you can carry it or wear it however you prefer.<br /><br />CONS<br />* Given my strap-detachment issue, this might not stand the test of repeated heavy loads. I'm concerned. (Papers and whatnot should be fine.)<br />* The zippers extend all the way down both sides (not just the top). This might be just a personal preference, but it's easy to open the bag too far and have everything fall out or to forget to check that both sides are fully zipped and not open before taking off with the bag.<br /><br />OTHER<br />* It's black with brown leather (or fake leather?) ""pads"" on the corners and handle. I'm not a fan of this black-and-brown combination. Your opinion may differ.<br /><br />To summarize, it's certainly not bad for the price and should withstand at least moderate use. I'd be careful about heavy books and avoid it if you want something that looks a bit more professional or rigid.  If you think the pros outweigh the cons, it's certainly not a bad option.<br /><br />EDIT: After about six months of use, one of the shoulder strap hooks snapped off the bag after the fabric had been wearing down (as I described above). I'd give the product three and a half stars if I could; I wouldn't be surprised if the occasional heavy load of books or the old laptop was too much, plus the ""handles"" are still working fine (I just preferred the shoulder strap because it was easier to carry when commuting)--but other bags (not this style) have held up to similar loads before."
3.0,"Pretty looking, but it feels cheap. I might just have to break it in and if it winds up that is the case I will review again!"
3.0,"Soft, looks a lot more dress up in the picture. It's more of a casual type sweater."
3.0,I wouldn't say it's thick.
3.0,They have a great fit and they look very nice. They appear very functionable. However the reason to purchase them was that they have interchangeable lenses. This should be something done in a few minutes. It has been 40 minutes and we cannot switch out the lenses. We watched the video and the little instructions that came with the pack. Unfortunately no success. I’m afraid if we work any harder we will break them.
3.0,I got the 5x because of the sizing chart. It was too big and it looked more like it should be for a costume.
3.0,Its lighter weight than I thought
3.0,"I liked the pants design and color. the many pockets. what I didn't like, is that the picture of them indicated there was a belt included. there was no belt with the order. I also didn't like that the advertising didn't tell you of the leg length. my pants were way too short. I'm 6 ft. 6 in. tall. I need a 37 or 38 in length. I also don't like the fact that they refund you in Amazon credit, instead of putting the money back on your credit card."
3.0,yea not really cushioned but still nice socks
3.0,I did't realize that the arms are flared and short. I thought it would flare at my hand but it doesn't even reach my wrist. not really my style. it fit well.
3.0,"I work in a brewery, and these boots worked great for 3 months. After that they torn apart at the stress points from bending over...you know, that little crease just in front of the top cap. They blew a hole the size of a quarter. I thought that these were chemical resistant!? Basically I am in a wet environment occasionally, I just thought that with the price point of these boots that they would be legit. Also, the lace system-well, it’s weird, but it works. Long story short those laces do not get along with water; at all. They disappeared within 2 weeks. I look on the internet and everyone says to just use zip ties. Great! I did. And they worked great! When I contacted the company to explain my situation and utilize the warranty for the boots that the company offers ( I had to send pictures and a description of what was wrong...the holes in the leather) and I was told that the zip ties had voided my warranty, but just this one time they made an exception and sent me a new pair. Sweet! I did not think that they would send me a new pair without having to send in the old ones!! Great customer service...DO NOT PUT ZIP TIES ON FOR THE LACES even though they work so much better! Apparently, they caused “stress” on the leather, but whatever.<br /><br />Would I BUY again? Shiet, I dunno. Not for $300. If they continue to stand behind their warranty; absolutely."
3.0,A little smaller than other brand with the same size
3.0,"Small for my face and not very comfortable, but it's made of good sturdy material."
3.0,"I like the mask.  It is hand-made and the material is sturdy, though the elastic sides are flimsy and lose their stretch after a 3-4 wears.  I most likely won't buy more due to the price.  Labor and materials would not cost this much to make something so basic."
3.0,"This was so cute, but ran much smaller than I expected and I even sized up. I still love it, but there is no stretch whatsoever."
3.0,Cheaply made but ok. Still pretty.
3.0,Too cheaply made for the price. Very disappointed!!
3.0,"To be 100% honest – I KNEW these were more or less “crackle” beads. I use beads like this to complement solid colors for my bracelet designs. With certain sellers I have come to not expect what is shown.<br /><br />One thing I have an issue with:<br /><br />Getting only 89% of what I was supposed to. I got 89 beads. I contacted the seller. He offered an 11% discount. Even if I hadn’t gotten these through the VINE program, that would’ve been $1.67 back (sales tax included). Nowhere CLOSE to being able to afford a replacement set, which with my state sales tax – $15.16.<br /><br />Saying the description is accurate on the count – false.<br /><br />That said …<br /><br />The colors are GORGEOUS. I can’t be disappointed there. I was able to get one or more multiple sets of “2”. I prefer counts of 2 as they go with my bracelet designs, one on each side of the charm.<br /><br />The only other problem – the listing which tends on the more “ONLY FOR EXAMPLE”. What is shown in the first slide (all the “crackle beads”) – that is 100% what you get. Slides 2, 3, 4, and 7 show dramatically different beads than what does arrive.<br /><br />Listing:<br /><br />“Mixed Color Rhinestone Charms Beads”<br /><br />There are ZERO rhinestone charms, zero rhinestone beads, and mixed color? Open to interpretation if you’re looking for solids – purple, blue, red, etc.<br /><br />I’m not as mad as another reviewer, but I’m not pleased either.<br /><br />These will work for my projects though."
3.0,Very narrow and cheaply made. I couldn't even wear. Not worth the $. I get better shoes at Wal-Mart for less.
3.0,"Very thin material but satisfactory.  You get what you pay for, and this was rather inexpensive."
3.0,"Very pretty when new but it will shrink, and it will wrinkle. I would not put it in the dryer more than a few minutes and let it air dry. Then you’ll probably want to iron it. Too much work for a nightgown."
3.0,"The hat itself is fairly cute. The velvet bow on the back adds a bit of style and visual interest. The interior of the hat has a velcro strap that can help adjust the hat's circumference to allow for a better fit. However, the chinstrap was not actually attached to the hat. It was a separate cord with an adjustment toggle, so I'm assuming you loop it over the top of the hat and then secure it under your chin...only downside is that it looks a bit ridiculous and it's not particularly effective. We live in a very windy area, so the extra benefit of a chin strap to keep it secure is essential.<br /><br />The hat itself is flexible and packable. It is a bit floppy which makes it easy to fold when needed. The brim offers a bit of additional sun protection for both the face and neck without having an overly large, wide brim."
3.0,"Ordered the 2XL, still 2 small"
3.0,I thought the shape of Africa would be smaller. Overall it's a decent necklace.
3.0,Not wat a expected! I need it with lights<br />I wanted to do a layer effect with short lurple skirt above. But it didnt look right green skirt made itlook clownish. It was too poofy.
3.0,Should be labeled for women. These sleeves were way too small and started busting at the seams first wear. They work great for my girl friend. Overall great quality just way too small.
3.0,"The M1 and M2 size which I assumed were the same as  1X and 2X are not. I normally wear a 1X, saw the comments about running small and ordered the M2. It was just a skoshe too small. And that was without putting anything in the pockets. The arms were fine, perfect even. I can’t say for certain but my jacket seemed longer than the one in the photo. I expected it to hit a little higher on my hips than it did. Otherwise this would have been the travel jacket of my dreams. It is well constructed, the pockets seem to be well thought out. I believe it would have served me well as a windbreaker, not too heavy with a reasonable amount of weather resistance.  My experience mirrors reviewer R. Jones. I eagerly await the day when SCOTTeVEST makes a size I can wear."
3.0,Great for 4th of July picture. Not great for seeing out of.
3.0,Not bad just really floppy
3.0,"The product came with loose threads. I'm a small, and it was exceptionally large."
3.0,Picture shows that this shirt is slim fit but it is quite loose fit.
3.0,"I want to really like these yoga pants, but they are just a bit too large.  I ordered the 3 pack.  The length and color of each is great.  Material is thick and comfortable.  Is there anyway i can exchange them?"
3.0,"These are cute, but they fall off my face. If you like glasses that sit on your cheeks and cover your eyebrows buy these."
3.0,"The toe section seems to be a little small while the heel sections seems to be a little loose.  This is not just a problem with this product but one that I find with 90% of the slippers I attempt to buy.  If I go to the next size then I can't even keep the slippers on.<br /><br />With regards to the arch support, they are slippers and I don't expect them to have good arch support."
3.0,The pants were good but slightly larger from the back<br />I followed the size chart<br />I'm an xxl bottom according to the chart and supposedly m top<br />But they both come as one size
3.0,Not very warm at all
3.0,"I searched for toddler Christmas studs as she's almost 4yo. I  settled with these. She was able to wear the studs and the snowflakes.  The ornamental ones were to big for her ears.  So I wore the reindeer pair & the snowman.  I had the same problem she did, the backs just slide off. Taking her winter hat off, the earrings came too.  When hanging the phone up at work...the earring fell off.  They're in but not necessarily secured.  They come is sets wrapped in plastic placed in a stiff jewelry bag.  I'm thankful for the bag for storage til next year. I wrapped them in small pieces of tissue before putting them up.  They are very pretty and we're pleased with them. With care and pre caution they'll last for years to come."
3.0,Didn't fit like a sports bra. Needed more support.
3.0,"I was skeptical to order, being that there were no reviews on this product yet.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate these items (or this product) a 3 out of 5. The reasoning being:<br />1) These charms are A LOT thicker than usual - Even though these charms look exactly like the image, the width in these charms are an inconvenience. Ex: Green fan is 2-3 times thicker than a traditional charm, making it look big and bulky on my croc. (Thankfully the Cherry Blossom charm was of normal width)<br />2) Thickness in the charm makes it less flexible<br /><br />I gave a star for the price, the items being exactly as pictured, and for the cherry blossom charm."
3.0,I am unable to set the time zone.  The watch is very nice but is running 3 hours behind time.  The directions do not seem to allow me to change the time zone.  I am not convinced that it sets itself.
3.0,Ita alright.
3.0,Product looks very well made but unfortunately the string shreds easy and breaks within 2 weeks
3.0,It does not fit my wife's wrist. My wife has many of these type of bracelets and this is the first time she has had a problem with one. It's either overly tight to too loose. It is perhaps just not the correct length.
3.0,Not enough room for photos are credit cards.
3.0,"Nice style, not super quality. I was hoping for something a bit more up-scale, but you get what you pay for, I guess. It is more of a casual sweat shirt than a really stylish statement. It is very comfortable, and fits fine. Unfortunately it is a pet hair magnet."
3.0,Mild scratch but nice product.
3.0,I would rate these as okay because they pill after just two washes and the waist tie is fake. My 6yo child is 4’ and 48 lbs and these are baggy in the front but the length is good. Would go with something else next time.
3.0,I used this product for motorcycle riding. They seem to keep the sun off my arms. They were cool and comfortable. The first day I wore them they started to shred apart like an old sweater. As I'm walking around and they're rubbing against my body and Bess they start deteriorating.
3.0,Love wearing this
3.0,Ordered this for my 7 (almost 8 year old). She is on the small thin side and this was much too big and baggy. The tops and the shorts were just too big and they didn’t offer this in a smaller size so we couldn’t exchange. My daughter is around 45 inches tall and 45 poundsish.
3.0,Not exactly what I was looking for but exactly as advertised. Solid looking product.
3.0,These look cheep. Probably won’t ever wear them.
3.0,Small in the bustline-
3.0,Smaller around the thighs but still comfortable.
3.0,Not the right length and shape for my body.. too long.. cut wrong.. returned
3.0,"The bottom of the suit fit fine and the over all design was cute, but the bust/cup size was too large."
3.0,The pants is way too long
3.0,I loved the dress!<br />Although the split was a little high I was a good fit.<br />You can see through material so make sure to wear proper undergarments.
3.0,gave to my daughter asked for 2xl was not even close to that size fits my teenager
3.0,Very nice bicycle at error made out of solid material with bright color.  Only SUS why you have to have commercial companies name on the hat ?
3.0,Color is not brown enough and it did not fit like a plus size dress.
3.0,I don’t really like this and returned it.
3.0,Good quality but I wish I would've paid a little extra for that one with the wheels
3.0,I ordered a M and it was TINY.  It's completely see-through also
3.0,"Strong foam material. Paint job is very spotty and the cut on the edge is very rough and blocky. Some areas of the edge cut even cut some of the actual part that should be part of the fin. You can for sure tell whoever was in charge of cutting it from the mold has to do it in a hurry... Overall, the fit is nice and the shape works well for a mermaid or water fairy look. I’ll end up trimming it a bit better and re-paint it."
3.0,Lenses tend to fog up.
3.0,"The beenie works fine. The light is decent, not great, but decent for night walks or whatever else. The Bluetooth ear speakers play music / audio books fine. Again, nothing special in terms of sound quality but they're passable little speakers. I might e given this beenie 4 or even 5 starts were it not for the following issues:<br />1- the beenie itself is pretty thin. It'll keep your head warm in Temps around 35-45 degrees for a short time but if it's any colder, or you're going to be outside for more than 20 or 30 mins you'll wish it were thicker material.<br />2- the part of the beenie which folds back up on itself around the ears is not adjustable. It's stitched in place. For the right size head this is OK but for me this meant I couldn't pull the beenie all the way down on my head unless I wanted the folded part around my cheeks. And, since the speakers are tucked into this fold you're basically stuck wearing the hat in whatever position allows the those speakers to line up with your ears. For me this meant there was still 2 inches of empty beenie just flopping around on top of my head.<br />3- the speakers themselves press into my ears in an uncomfortable way. I think this is because the fabric is so thin that I really feel the  hard plastic pushing through it against my ears. I really can't wear it for more than 15 mins without needing to take it off.<br /><br />I really don't see myself using this much. It's too bad because I really like the idea of it. Oh well."
3.0,"It is very pretty, and lighter (weight) than I expected.  Metal is gold colored, not silver like picture, and one earring was broken."
3.0,Breaks kind of easily.
3.0,Gold has disappeared from the shell.
3.0,"Great pants! Except for the faded black fabric. Fit great! No rolling on the elastic waist. Comfortable! Like a fancy pair of pj bottoms! Wear to work and out all the time. I feel like there’ll be a time in the near future where they’ll be too faded to wear to work, sadly. I wash them in cold water on the delicate cycle too... The material is a little on the thicker side too, great in the fall."
3.0,These shoes are very cheaply made...look like a much nicer show in the picture than they do in person
3.0,It’s huge. You would have to cute a lot of fabric and sew it back together.. doable.. but I think you can find something else that fits better without all of the effort.
3.0,The earrings are on wires backwards and not as brilliant as necklace. Though I love them and wear them often. Not sure how much it will cost to have them turned around by jeweler.<br />The brouche is brilliant and sparkly though the chain the clasp is way too small and difficult to put on and off
3.0,"soft, easily adjustable. i thought the rim was just a bit too large, although I did enjoy the coverage of my face and shoulders."
3.0,"Nice, soft material is comfortable but the dress is ill fitting. It’s not flattering at all but it is comfortable. If comfort is what you’re looking for and don’t mind looking like you’re wearing a potato sack, then this is the dress for you."
3.0,They are very pretty earrings. I loved them until my daughter came home from her dads without 1. The entire reason I picked this pair was because they were suppose to unscrew off.
3.0,The Quality is just right the price
3.0,I wanted something roomy to throw on to take the dog out.  Thus was not it.
3.0,Pretty think cheap scarfs.  Took forever to ship but they are fine for what you pay
3.0,"Kinda on the fence about this dress, the quality wasn't bad but the big seam right down the middle and the lines not matching up caught my eye. I wish I had taken a picture before I returned it. It's beautiful in person but if you have a lot going on up top this dress will give you trouble. Size up."
3.0,This cap and mask are very comfortable. The problem I have is the vent in the mask fell out. Now I’ve only worn it three times and I hand washed the item and let it air dry. I Will return the item and I just want it replaced because it was quite warm and comfortable. I also tried to place it back in the  on the opening and it won’t go.<br />Well they replaced the item and after a week the plastic vent piece is trying to come out again and mask was shorter in length wise they  would send me just mask without vent.
3.0,It’s a nice dress. Marterial is so so.
3.0,Love the comfort great band only issue was magnet came out of the slot had to buy super glue to glue it back
3.0,"I wanted reading glasses with a bit more durability than I normally get, so I was willing to pay more (almost 3X more, as it turns out) for ""better"" glasses. These are no better, they are just more expensive. So, OK, but the cheap ones are just as good."
3.0,The lense tint is too dark. The fit is very loose.
3.0,Really cheap and overpriced Ib
3.0,"The wallet is very well made and holds a nice amount of cards and money, but I wanted to have the cool lettering design on mine. I guess it would make sense that the whole fire hose wouldn't have letters, so keep in mind that you're will likely look nothing like the pic. Other than that, it does the job."
3.0,"For buying shoes for play they are good, no holes yet."
3.0,It is a great suit fully lined and give you that retro look but it fits kinda small in the bust and length of the suit.
3.0,it looks cute bu when i tried it it just fit weird. it toght on the chest and loose on the tummy. maybe its perfect for sexy and slim ladies
3.0,"I have these earrings now...initial use was great.  Good size, noticeable and fit well.  However, I stored them in my pocket for awhile and they separated from the base.  Looking to glue them back together at some point.  I also have the grey and black as well.  With those the studs have a tendency to loosen after prolonged wear.  All in all they're ok...just have to monitor use and storage.  Not great for longevity if you plan on passing them down to your kids!"
3.0,"It was as described, but we’re too short for my husband’s calves.  The Velcro barely held the first time he used them.  We had to end up using binder clips to keep them fastened.  The fur was of good quality.  If you have skinny legs, they may work for you, but I’m not sure about the Velcro holding for more than a few uses."
3.0,One of these laces broke the very first time I put it on the shoe. So disappointed in a name brand product.
3.0,"it's really cute and the quality isn't too bad, considering it's half the price of one from a higher end brand. I'm a 34/36b and it fit nicely around my chest but the straps are really long, therefore making it slip down. I can deal with it but it's pretty annoying."
3.0,Purchase 1 size bigger than normal size.  Product runs extremely small.  Other than that comfortable and great.  Good hard sole at the bottom too.
3.0,some pairs are too small
3.0,"This dress is comfortable and fits good.  The red color looks so good, I am sad to be returning it.  I am tall and this red dress is almost 3 inches shorter than the floral print one I bought last month.  I wish it were as long as the other one I have.  Also worth noting, these dresses are mostly cotton which makes them comfortable, but they start to look old and faded pretty quick as you wash them."
3.0,"The style is classic. However, the cloth is not a great quality and it’s very wrinkled. The fit is okay but not proportional."
3.0,"Item was defective, the hook for the shoe lace came out the second time I used it, the first time I used it I felt something poking my ankle and when it fell off I realized what it was. I was able to fix it with a hammer but I’m a little upset because I feel like they will all come out eventually. My size is 9.5 and my feet is moderately narrow and it was too snug on the length. Since is not real leather I was afraid to keep it and be really uncomfortable. I wanted to exchange for a 10 but I couldn’t find a 10 So I exchanged it to 10,5 and it’s comfortable. It’s a full size bigger than my normal size and I have other shoes that are 10 and they are way bigger than this boots. My arch is moderately high  and I was afraid it was not gonna support my feet, I always have problems with heels because my arch doesn’t touch the shoe, but my arch lay perfectly on this boots without having an arch too high.<br />I haven’t spent the day on this boots yet and I’ll update if there is something more to add.<br />My suggestion for new buyers is size up half a size or a full size if your plan is to wear with winter socks. I like it without the chain and white part is removable too."
3.0,Very disappointed with the package that comes with the watch. Simple and doesn’t even have a manual. I know that is very cheap but still could have better presentation. If you don’t wear it for more than 4 to 6 hours will stop working. It looks nice though.
3.0,Not great quality. Irritated ears. Rusted quickly. Beautiful earrings though; very disappointing.
3.0,"Quality seems great upon arrival, but after a few times using it the color seems somewhat faded and the quality is no longer the same. I noticed things such as lint, cloth materials and dirt attaching easily without a wash yet. I'd recommend spending a bit more."
3.0,The size isn't what it says a medium but it is a large. Very warm!! I'm told it is anti government and in 2014 I'm not happy with our government
3.0,Bigger than expected and middle button fell off second time I wore it. Dissatisfied and I normally don’t have negative reviews.
3.0,"I expected the turban to be much longer and bigger than what it really is. Great material! It’s lightweight and feels really soft, so it wouldn’t be too damaging on your hair. But it’s still a pretty awkward length..."
3.0,Not for a high impact workout
3.0,Fabric is weird
3.0,Very pretty necklace but does not look like the heart of the Ocean necklace
3.0,"I did not order to my specific size so will need slight alterations and is longer than I thought, but I am short.  Very pretty looks like the picture!!"
3.0,Cup size was off .
3.0,I love this shirt - it's really pretty and feminine.  I have 2 issues with it however - the first is that the lace accents and seams have a ton of excess threads that had to be trimmed.  The second issue is that in the front right beside the buttons there was a small hole in the fabric that had been stitched together before it arrived at my door. Not sure what happened but I am somewhat upset that my brand new shirt had been mended before I received it.
3.0,Super cute idea but run super small . Not happy with the size at all.
3.0,"Returned , not off the shoulder fit like picture showed"
3.0,Great look but the T-shirt material made it look less dressy and hard to de wrinkle.
3.0,was too small in body too large in the bust
3.0,"Dress came as expected but it was a little small in the hip area. I am 5'4&#34; 150lbs and I have hips, smaller waist and hips. I was afraid the dress would split at the seam if I sat down. I ordered size M will be returning it and purchasing the L"
3.0,The charm is really nice but the &#34;leather&#34; cord it comes with is horrible.  I ordered another one from a different company that will hopefully be better quality.
3.0,"The threading on the plastic piece does not hold well, can be pulled right off."
3.0,"I loved the boots but they came defective the zipper did not hold at the top it would come right down..loved the boots but had to send them back,,I didn't realize I was dealing with a third party it took me awhile to get these returned and figured out.."
3.0,I have regular size woman hands. These gloves are big. It's a little to big and it makes wearing them a little inconvenient for finger movement. But what I'm annoyed with the most is. It keeps shredding. I wore a black coat the other day and the area around my pocket are all gray/whiteish.
3.0,"Smaller than anticipated, 3x is more like large (I don't like tightness in the arms)."
3.0,"Dome is a bit smaller than standard, which is a bummer because the design and look are gorgeous."
3.0,"A great tote, large compartment but the rose doesn't stay in place and either remove it or deal with it sliding..."
3.0,Love the belt! Wish it didn't break in like three days. Still kept the loop and added it to a different belt but it isn't the same.
3.0,I wear a size M or L and these are very tight. I have 5 other pairs of a different brand and they are Medium and Larges and fit great but this pair is way too tight.
3.0,nice color variety and each had its own clasp
3.0,It was ok not like the originals
3.0,"Does not come with any kind of inner &#34;freshness&#34; seal. As others have reviewed, some of the oil leaked during transit. thankfully not much in my case.<br /><br />Personally not a fan of mink oil now that I try it. It smells kind of funny to me. Overall a good product, I think it does exactly what it advertises, just not my favorite. So far I prefer Bick 4."
3.0,"well to start there was no clasp to get the necklace on and off (good thing i could get it over my head). And the chain was twisted and really dark and too heavy for this pendant ,also cheap looking . Im going to be putting a new chain on it to make up for the ugly old one."
3.0,The projections in these sandals are harder than anticipated......not as comfortable to wear.
3.0,These are really small and they can get lost easily so please keep that in mind ! Over all they are cute but you can barley see the design
3.0,Comfortable. Thin
3.0,Cute but it did not fit correcly into the other charms I already had. . . . . . .
3.0,These are fair glasses! Cant say I would buy them again!
3.0,"it tells you what size to get by your measurements but not true to small ,size up"
3.0,Rather bulky
3.0,Love the metal bit. Love it! But after a few uses the leather bit came off.  Which is a shame because after pages of looking for this saying this was the only piece I liked for my man.
3.0,"This little watch is ok. It does keep time well, but is hard for me to read it. The strap is kind of flimsy. It just didn't shake my world. I plan to give it to the 10 year old daughter of our neighbor's."
3.0,"Love it, so elligant, pretty but very choosy of color you ware."
3.0,Late.
3.0,Middle stone fell out immediately and had to be glued back together.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:24c2d4571a1a46b69e3854bd9294fed5]] It isn't like what was expected from the model photo, but it's cute to wear none the less. Work or date appropriate. A little snug in the armpit area. Shirt rides up and stays when you move your arms. I wear a tank top underneath for that reason."
3.0,"This looked like exactly what I needed, but it unfortunately broke during it's first use. The middle clamp is of solid construction, but the springs that clasp the edges of your garnment are cheap. One side failed so that it no longer provides the grasp needed to hold on to anything. Is useless now. I had hoped for more for $13."
3.0,"Eh- I returned it. It is a pretty thick material but not like cotton? It’s nice, it made me look HUGE for some reason but I debated on keeping it. The material was just strange for me and decided to just send it back."
3.0,"Very large in the waist but drapes nicely. Fabric was not as expected, thin nylon like, was hoping it would be more of a warmer dress with a cotton feel."
3.0,- cute!!
3.0,"Yo pedí dos camisas de estas talla S y L Me gusto bastante la calidad pero, la talla L le quedo a la persona que es talla S por esa razón debi devolver la talla s y pedir una talla XL por que son muy pequeñas"
3.0,"The cuff links look nice and actually work.  There are two reasons for the lackluster rating, though.  First, the actual movement is very subtle - you can really only see one small wheel turning.  Second, one of the links seems to get jammed and stops turning despite being fully wound-up.  If I tap it with a paper clip, it will resume turning for a while.  Overall, I'm enjoying them so far, but I can't give full stars."
3.0,Fit was tight in waist but big up top. I'm 5'4&#34; 130 34c I ordered a small. Also surprised to see the skirt was a shiny satin. Guess I missed that in the description.
3.0,I liked the outfit but the top part of the pants are see through.
3.0,"I love love LOVED this necklace. I was only able to wear it for about  week tho, before the chain broke apart.<br /><br />The mountain part is great quality and craftsmanship."
3.0,"This is a cute top. The fabric is a light to medium t shirt material with a bit of body to it. The print is vibrant and cute. The finish of this top leaves a lot to be desired however. There are loose threads everywhere and it needs a lot of clean up and finish work. It's not really evenly sewn either. Not first quality. It's okay though, and due to the style and loose fit, it isn't noticeable to a great extent that it's not 'accurate'. The sleeves are short, and buttoned at the cuff. These sleeves do not come to my wrists and rest at my hand as shown in the photos of the model. I do not have super long arms, I am 5'8"" 122lbs 35""  chest 2/4 dress size typically, and wear a  small top US also. the cuff of the sleeve on me, rests at about 3"" above the wrist. It's not tight or uncomfortable in the arm or cuff area because of this. Typically models are said to be 5'11"" and humans that tall would naturally have longer arms than me, so this top is most likely similar to the one shown,  but not the actual top. It's close but not quite first quality. I want you to know this and don't want to pretend that I didn't notice this stuff. I like the tunic and it's cute, close enough.  Medium is priced at just over 20 at the time of this review. Meh, okay pricing. I've docked two stars for the issues I've listed, which are significant enough I think."
3.0,Definitely go up in size the pants very tight and the jacket i could not get on honey but the quality was good very nice
3.0,Size is smaller than expected but fabric & seams are well made
3.0,"This top is very cute, with a vibrant color and stylish. Unfortunately, as with all Fihapyli clothing, it runs big. I have tried several tops from this manufacturer, and not one of them fit me. I continue to try because their clothing is very cute, and affordable. However, I just need to resist the temptation and stop buying them. For reference, I am 5ft 2 inches, 107lbs. I always order the smallest size available, and always end up returning due to being too large on me. However, if you have the body type which their clothing fits, you probably won't be disappointed."
3.0,I preferred my NuBra to this. It works alright but makes me look flat from the side.
3.0,The color was not exactly as seen in the picture.
3.0,Very lightweight. Good as a extra emergency hat.
3.0,Pretty but not able to fit
3.0,I not sure how the zipper is going to last. But I do like the pocketbook.
3.0,Fits well and comfortable. My husband bought these thinking they were fuzzy socks. These are more like dress thin style.
3.0,"it is a really tiny charm, its cute but if I had knew the size probably I had not bought it."
3.0,"Well, this is my favorite sweater, so I ordered another one. The sweater that arrived has the same pattern but weird tassles hanging down, no hood, and a fold-over collar/neck that drapes down. I like the first sweater, which iis pictured. It is care free, but this new version is a pain to wear - always fixing the collar drape and the tassles will not look good for long."
3.0,Very attractive shoe but no real arch support as I hoped.
3.0,"While pretty, I was expecting something larger.  Would have appreciated seeing this on a person so that I would have realized the size."
3.0,these are tighter than they looked like. I wear a child size mask normally but was looking for something looser. This is sucked tight to my face and I can't talk without chewing on it. Colors are exactly as pictured and good quality otherwise.
3.0,Love the print but she won't she able to wear till like August if she's lucky.
3.0,"It is a beautiful gown. Bling falls off when handling it but it has plenty left. I ordered the size suggested by the maker and it it didn't fit well. Too tight around the midsection. The piece didn't cover my back even when laced up. The bodice fit well but the straps were too long. I don't think my proportions allow for a perfect fit with this dress. It would take a lot of alterations if I kept this size or if I sized up.  Sadly, Returned."
3.0,"Cute, but way too small. I normally wear a 4-6, so I ordered a small, but these fit like a 0."
3.0,I thought the necklace came with earrings.<br />It's OK item.
3.0,"It is not adjustable, and seems to be for little girls or much smaller heads than my ol' noggin, at least!<br /><br />That said, the item was good quality & the seller sent it quickly.  I don't want to give it a 1-star rating because that seems unfair to the seller since the product is nice; however, the buyer needs to beware that size is an issue with this headband, and I would not recommend it for anyone other than children or young teenagers, perhaps."
3.0,Reliable selle r and reliable qual ity.It worked! I have used others and its a crap shoot!
3.0,"These were super tight, I would order a size up"
3.0,I like the thickness of this product however some pearls had fallen off the crown. The package was poorly bent which caused item to be bent. The crown was bent badly.
3.0,Oversized - cute with high heel boots or shoes.
3.0,Light and airy material. Nice custom piece to wear with my outfit.
3.0,"Really pretty and do like it. The only problem was, it was listed as one size fits most and no one over a small/medium could wear this. I am a 6 and i would like it a bit bigger"
3.0,I loved these boots!! I was very disappointed in the calf width though. The zipper didn’t go all the way to the top either and my foot didn’t fit in the hole size they gave the boots an I don’t have big feet.
3.0,I ordered my normal size in workout pants and these were at least two sizes smaller. Nice fabric and the pocket is big enough for an iPhone. Returning.
3.0,Thin and fit a little more snug in the belly. If I get the next size up it would be too large. Again.... it's very thin. Not what I was hoping for. Returning.
3.0,They run a little smaller than expected.
3.0,"The mustard seed was a little cheap looking, but if I get a better chain it will help.  Thanks! Good purchase.."
3.0,It’s nothing like the picture. It’s not exactly off the shoulder.
3.0,Took forever to arrive (about 3 months). It's a nice ring for the price.
3.0,I love Fossil handbags.  I have quite a variety.  This latest one doesn't seem as well made as the older ones I have.  The leather isn't as thick and the handle doesn't seem as sturdy.  The lining doesn't feel as nice.  Probably the last one I bought was about 5 years so I'm hoping the newer bags are still going to hold up as well as the older ones.  And it was disappinting to not receive it in the usual cloth bag that makes it feel so special.
3.0,These earrings were okay for the price I paid.
3.0,"I have several 9Fifth snapbacks, and cannot figure out why this one has such a deep cup to it unlike the others"
3.0,EH. It's alright. I'll probably just gift it to someone.
3.0,I bought this after researching several Star Wars watches.  I bought this because of the price.  It's exactly what it is: a black watch with Vader's image.  There are 2 buttons on the side that do nothing.  I am rough with mine while wearing it at work and the black paint does scratch off to a goldish color underneath.  I still recommend it.
3.0,Cheaply made but useful enough to not care to deal with returning..
3.0,Cute but only has rings for 4 fingers and it shows on picture it has for 5 fingers
3.0,"poor quality fabric, and not flattering. The embroidery is machine embroidery and the quality is what you expect from fast fashion but it is still a bit on the pricey side."
3.0,"The hat was too big for me. But instead of sending it back, I'll stuff it with something so it fits better."
3.0,Nice product get material I ordered a large my waist size is a 31. I think I Could have ordered a med.
3.0,"This screen protector is great as long as you use it alone (without a case). In my situation I wanted it to be used with my Otter Box, unfortunately it didnt work well with it. My Otter box barely closed & when it did the screen wouldnt function well bc the screen protector must pop up a bit. I put another case on it & that didnt work either, it made a clicking sound. Will ask for a refund. But again, if you use just the screen protector & no case it works perfect."
3.0,Size ran a little big
3.0,"3 because both pockets had big holes, so they can not be used!"
3.0,"They fit great over my wife's glasses, but as we were driving with the Sun shining through my windshield, she had to cover her eyes. After we stopped, I looked new the Sun with her glasses. They don't darken like my tinted prescription glasses. They also looked slightly greenish. I've had polarized glasses years ago and don't remember them being greenish. The real polarized glasses topped more glare than the ones I bought my wife."
3.0,Very impressed with the style and quality. I ordered 4p but received 0p
3.0,"This keychain is pretty nice,  but WAY too thin.  I measured it to be about .28 inches wide, definitely not the advertised .375 inches.  The picture seems to be vertically stretched to make the gun seem thicker and less long (not sure if purposefully).  Good weight, detail (besides no opening at the tip), and size.  Less thick than a Ticonderoga pencil. If you don't mind thickness, then it is pretty good."
3.0,This dress is made out of a polyester knot...it's nothing special.  I will wear a printed long shrug over it to give it a little something extra (which it needs).  It's made well...just not the best fabric and kind of drab.
3.0,Unfortunately his face is too large and doesn't look like the picture
3.0,"My wife really wanted a white bra to replace an old, beat up one. Having the opportunity to get this one for her for review was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.<br /><br />I want to start by mentioning, to be fair, that the retail price on this bra is about half of what you see a lot of bras. You do get what you pay for. On the good side, it fits as expected and the padding on the bottom is nice and comfortable for her.<br /><br />Now, the issues. The straps leave a bit to be desired. They're in weird spots and there is no slack to adjust them. She can replace the straps (probably from her old bra) so it's not the end of the world. The other issue is that the top portion on one of the pads is indented, which she said tends to happen with older bras that have been washed a lot (I learn something new every day). This one, however, is brand new.<br /><br />It will serve it's purpose but you can tell it's not top of the line."
3.0,Cute bracelet but you get what you pay for.  Easy to put on and I get lots of compliments but the quality is not that great.
3.0,This dress is way shorter than we first thought. So sad.
3.0,"The coat is a bit thinner than expected as well as a bit smaller than expected.  However I plan to keep it because I am in the process of bringing down my weight, so it will eventually fit for my preference."
3.0,"Very Cute! But this hat is HUGE! It was even too large for my boyfriend. I tried to put a liner in the rim, but that didn't help enough. will probably return this item."
3.0,"Comfortable and cute, but turn my toe green if I wear for an extended time"
3.0,"They were very comfortable but the night I got them they already tore in the front, if you where a long shirt you can't really see it but it'd be nice if I didn't have to worry about it. Also they're VERY see through."
3.0,"It's a nice length and color, but it does look extremely cheap."
3.0,"At 5'3 and typically wearing mediums, I ordered the large knowing that most non-name brand clothing online runs small. It definitely runs smaller than expected because even the large ran small and was snug. The shirt should be labeled as form fitting since it is a very tight fit in all areas. If you like your clothes flowing and loose, size up at least a size or 2. Don't expect any stretch with it though. I actually frayed a seam by trying to stretch it a bit.  The actual shirt though is very cute and has a faint camo pattern, not the dark colors one expects. Its a very cute shirt though and goes well with jeans, shorts, or a cute skirt. Dress it up or dress it down. Or do like me and wear it as a pj shirt because it doesn't fit as expected. Don't let that deter you though; a cute shirt that just needs sized up."
3.0,"Pretty comfortable, although not as much as my older version Merrell shoe. I have a high arch and usually have to add supports but these shoes have a really high arch built in, and it's not hitting my foot in the right place."
3.0,Bought this for my honeymoon and unfortunately it got a hole in the seem the first time I wore it. The material is thinner than I would have expected
3.0,Very sheer even if not too stretched.
3.0,Tight and no stretch. Order a bigger size.
3.0,"I bought this for a swimsuit cover-up but wasn't impressed with it. It has an inner liner which makes it too heavy for a swimsuit cover-up and I don't think it would dry very quickly. I was hoping it would double as a top with jeans or possibly a cute dress but it didn't have enough shape/structure for my body and adding a belt would have made it too short as a dress. I think it would be cute on someone with a different body type, just didn't work for me. The color and fit were accurate."
3.0,Not as cute as I expected. Sending back
3.0,Not worth the money !
3.0,This swim suit was really cute and good quality when it came in which is nice except for the fact that it was TINY. I am 5'3 and 100 pounds and I ordered a medium since the other reviews said buy a size bigger than you normally do. The medium bottoms fit great but the top was very small. Definitely designed for very flat chested people.
3.0,Too revealing. Needed a more substantial lining. Fitted perfectly.  Nice materials.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed as to how thin these are. I was expecting a thicker, warmer product based on the description. But for the price now I see why. Not for harsh cold winter weather, but rather fall weather in my mind"
3.0,"Nothing special, took forever to arrive from china, don't reccomend if in a hurry, but otherwise great"
3.0,Doesn’t really look like picture
3.0,"Love the material and fit, but they most certainly do ride up."
3.0,My dress came without a belt which was kind of disappointing
3.0,"Worked for us. It's cute, compact and perfect for carry on"
3.0,"Nice but to small..order up at least 2 sizes aside from that,it very pretty very good quilty fabric I'm going to order it again in a bigger size ."
3.0,"Luana bags are wonderful. The craftsmanship is excellent, top quality hardware and locks, nice smooth well dyed leather in classic as well statement colors, even stiching and neatly finished edges. They look and feel expensive and could ALMOST compete with some luxury brands in the 500-1000 dollars range (not the same, but really close in quality) I like the contemporary design. This particular bag has a little bit of a LV color scheme and goes with practically every outfit. It came with a very nice dustbag. It is smaller then I imagined looking at the dimensions and will not fit my wallet. In fact, it doesnt fit many items at all, but I might keep it anyway. It is very pretty, cute and stylish.<br /><br />Edit-I ended up sending it back. It's very pretty, but too small to be practical for me."
3.0,Leggings are very comfortable however they are see through when I bend over. Would work well under a dress or long shirt
3.0,"Fits a little snug, if you want it to look like the model, I would go up a size. Colors are fine though."
3.0,They were great but actually did not fit under the seats
3.0,It was way too large for a teenager. I just pulled out my electric sander and got to fit. THen it was ok.
3.0,"I am very sensitive to smell, and these bags are slowly getting better when exposed to sun and air.  But, I wasn't at all pleased, after waiting for them to arrive from England, at the first whiff.  Other than that, I did get what I ordered.  The next bags I order will have a shorter strap, through.  I'm short, and have to make a real effort not to drag them on the ground."
3.0,They are cool but didn't fitt ??
3.0,Product was not the material I expected and seems cheap. Not worth the price.
3.0,So it looks like itll be off the shoulder and it is not. Fits like a normal t shirt unless your shoulders are 5” apart. Still cute though! 3 stars since its not off the shoulder
3.0,"I did not see an option to exchange, so ijust returned. The are very light and cute, however, they are cut small.  I wear/ordered a 7.5,  but would need an 8.5."
3.0,"Super soft and the color was gorgeous! With that said, THIS DRESS RUNS BIG!! I am 5’5”, 160lbs and I normally wear a size 10/L in most items (I’m chubby). I ordered the dress in a medium because some of the reviews stated that it was a little baggy.... I definitely could of gotten away with a small!!! And I’m not a small in anything! It’s a longer dress too (it drags on the ground for me) so it will need to be worn with some wedges, which is fine. Overall, it’s a decent dress for the price. Just order a size DOWN"
3.0,"Very soft, very thin, may not hold up but only $6.00 Took forever to arrive."
3.0,"I bought this intending for it to be used for my conch piercing.  The feather is way too big to fit in that space on the inside of my ear, although the feather does slip off when you unscrew the back.  It's cute, but I'm not sure where you would want that on your ear.  I have 10 different ear piercings, and I can't think of anywhere where this would look good."
3.0,"I purchased a size XL= US Large based on other reviews but I think I should have purchased my normal size.<br /><br /> I am 5'6'', 150 lbs and 34D and usually wear a size medium. The swimsuit itself is very sexy, I had to send it back as the top portion was way too big. I think I am going to re-order the size L= US Medium. It does not have any padding, but it seems like it will hold everything up if you get the correct size.<br /><br />Your butt cheeks will definitely be out, so make sure you are comfortable with this before purchasing."
3.0,"Don’t buy this product. I have an Apple Watch series 3 and when I was looking for a different watch band I saw this one, loved the color and the fact that it was leather. In the description it said works with the Apple Watch series 3. The added bonus was the screen protector for my watch. I was so disappointed when I finally received this product. The watch band goes on nice and smooth but on both ends of the watch band are these very pointy and sharp pieces sticking out past the slot the band slips in, it obviously is too big for the Apple Watch series 3. The screen protector is much to large, there is no possible way this product would ever fit the series 3 Apple Watch. Now when the ends of the watch band itself were enclosed in the screen protector, this concealed the sharp points at the end of the watch band but the screen protector was loose. I really like the watch band but without the screen protector on to hide the sharp areas on the watch band it’s only a matter of time before I scratch someone or snag my clothing. I don’t understand why a company would say a product works with the series 3 Apple Watch when it clearly does not. So disappointed!!"
3.0,These rings are super cute my boyfriend and I love them. The sizing is great! The wording is not at all like the picture. The picture is nice and bold and readable. The actual product it’s very tiny and hard to read.
3.0,I wouldn't run in this one but it keeps the girls close.
3.0,"I bought this dress two summers ago but the one I have is 96% cotton, 4% spandex. It had a soft bodice and a nice, crisp skirt. I bought a small (5’3, 135 lb) and it fit perfectly. Very flattering! After a few washes in cold water and line drying, it seemed to shrink. Or I gained weight during the pandemic. Either is a real possibility! Anyway, I ordered this same style (different pattern, they no longer carry the navy flowers so got the navy/magnolia) but in a medium. I tried it on and it fit me well, a little looser in the shoulders and waist, but it just felt so slippery. So I checked the tag: 100% polyester. I really hate the way polyester looks, feels and smells so I’m sending it back. I hope they bring back the cotton version; I loved it!"
3.0,The top fits well but the bottom is way too baggy and doesn’t look like in the picture !
3.0,Cute but about 4-5 inches too long to be sexy. Has the potential to be very cute with a good hem
3.0,"Size: contra to what the descriptions says don't size down--the top cuts in and will show that 'arm skin' most of us don't want people to see:). Fabric: disappointing.. I ordered the navy -- and the design is printed on (not woven into the fabric)--the 'paint' feels cheap--you know like a cheep school t-shirt design-- my experience tells me this is going to 'wash out' within a few washes. From a distance this dress looks really cute, the design really is cute.  It also has nice length (I am 5'7&#34; and ordered the large) and it is lined -- which is nice--but if you want to wear it in 'hot' weather that lining is going to stick to you. If you only need it for a couple of occasions --it will be fine; but, if you expect to wear it several times -- I wouldn't buy it. I am returning it -- don't want to risk washing it."
3.0,"I measured carefully using the guidelines and template provided by Apple. I measured at 6.5, thus according to that I should order the next size down. So I ordered two bands, one off-brand in size 6 from Amazon, and one from Apple in size 6. I wanted to try out this new style with the Watch 4 I already own, and also wanted to try the off-brand, to see what it’s quality is compared with the Apple branded product, since it’s so much cheaper. I received the off-brand band first and was dismayed at how tight it is on my wrist, and anticipated being disappointed in the Apple brand band as well. Much to my delight, the Apple band is significantly more comfortable, as it is a little more than a half-size longer than the off-brand!  Both bands present a challenge to slip them over the hand, but especially the off-brand actually hurt to get over my hand. The Apple brand band, though still a bit of a struggle to get over the hand, is manageable and I don’t feel like it cuts off my circulation once it’s in place on my wrist. Anyone want to buy a barely-used yellow solo loop band, approximately size 5-5 1/2, for the small cost of shipping? I certainly will not be wearing it!"
3.0,Compre 2 uno sin color y el otro con un color cafe pero en un año ya empeso a perder el brillo y ahora ya el color tambien se empeso a perder
3.0,Very small...Picture is deceiving on the size.
3.0,Color is not as shown in the picture. Bright red
3.0,"I have a layered haircut. I got this hairband to keep my shorter layers out of my face at the gym. It looked nice and was well-made, but no matter what way I put it in, it kept sliding off, even before I made it to the car to go to the gym. My hair is not curly, but it isn't super sleek either."
3.0,"Okay, not great fit."
3.0,"Not for D cups, no support !"
3.0,"Nice fabric, but not true to size."
3.0,"I loved the look of them and they would be very cozy, but they didn’t fit my foot correctly. I tried two sizes. The molded rubber base hit my toes in the wrong spot. Gave them to my mother who loves them because they fit her perfectly."
3.0,"supports for the cross bars don't all screw in with proper alignment, and the V on top doesn't line up properly"
3.0,"I bought the orange. The orange color on top did not match the orange color on the bottom. It could still work if you’re not OCD about these things. I am and I couldn’t get past it. Also the bottom is made with a heavier, non breathable material that I didn’t care for so I’ll be returning this item."
3.0,"This was VERY small. It was actually nicely made, so I’m sad that it was absolutely unwearable because it was tiny."
3.0,"Its great looking- the band is nice quality adn the rose gold and pearl face looks very nice. however, the time keeping is less than stellar. it seems to lose about 3-4 minutes an hour, so by the end of the day, the minutes are completely off. I'm not sure if this was a functionality of the battery or the timepice, but I just returned the watch. II'm hoping I just had a defective one and yours will work wonderfully."
3.0,"Size fits me around my head, but doesnt come down far enough to my ears."
3.0,"I was looking for a button extender to put on my shirt sleeves so I could push them up and not have them slip down. I had to use 2 of these linked together for each sleeve to get enough space to go around my bicep (those with bigger biceps might need more). One worry I had was that the loop part of the item will stretch out as they are not elastic, but coiled springs. Reminder: don't forget to take these off before you wash your clothes."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, needless to say. They came in about 10 days when the delivery said it would take about 18-28 days, so I was happy about that, but they came with a lot of the diamond/jewel studs missing from the rings. I still like them, but eh.<br /><br />Again, get what you pay for."
3.0,These shoes are cute but we’re not comfortable. Wish there was more padding and a zipper on the side.
3.0,"Wast pointy,they would look better if the were"
3.0,I liked the overall fit. The only problem was the length was extremely long.  I could not wear it even with heels.
3.0,"I gave these sandals a 3-star rating, which I thought was generous.<br /><br />No arch support. The opposite, in fact.<br /><br />There are better quality, more comfortable options to be found in the $12 price range. The only thing comfortable is the heel cushioning, which is okay.<br /><br />EDITED: After wearing these a little more I've noticed a little more arch support. perhaps they needed some weight on them to &#34;break them in&#34;. Whatever the case may be, at least they're offering a little improvement in this respect, which is important for me.<br /><br />Still just a 3-star rating, though."
3.0,"I really like the graphics on the shirt, but it is not as soft as I had hoped. The dryer will wrinkle the shirt and it ought to probably be ironed. But overall I like wearing it."
3.0,"VERY VERY VERY VERY SMALL, BUT THEY ARE PRETTY"
3.0,"I bought a pair of capri yoga pants small, black, a few months back.  Now some of the stitching is unraveling along the waistband.  I've only worn them and washed them a handful of times and have not been harsh in their wear.  Otherwise, I am happy with the product.  I delayed returning them, so if it happens to your pair, make sure you return then immediately within the return policy timeline."
3.0,"Great design, good image, nice fabric, but like others have said, it was too small, even though we orderd the largest size available, but still kinda happy with it."
3.0,Flimsy and rather cheaply made I will keep it and use it on my purses but I would appreciate one like this in a better
3.0,"It's way too tiny for ID card. I wouldn't put coins in there either, because it has thin slots on both right and left sides, but big enough for coins to slip through and fall out. But other than that, it's okay. I just need to find some use for it."
3.0,Runs super small go up 2 sizes. I gave my first pair to my nephew orderd another pair for my son. They love them!!
3.0,"The fan works when in the sun, but once you step into the shade it stops.  It was a unique gift for my husband when mowing the lawn."
3.0,This is very pretty but very lightweight and the clasp on the back is heavier than the bird and hoop on the front so it doesn’t want to lay right on my neck.
3.0,Fit as expected-material is heavier than most
3.0,They were quite large
3.0,I love how soft the sweater is and the color...but the knit is very loose which makes it pull easily. It is comfortable but the neck hole even with a camisole is way to big and slips off the shoulders. It is wider rather than long....a little disappointed but I will still wear it because it's warm and comfortable. A reminder that you &#34;get what you pay for&#34;.
3.0,"They are nice and fit well....but, the nose piece flew off on one side after the 4th wear."
3.0,"Very thin, easy to breathe in. Keeps the covid away so far. Very comfortable, but stretches too easy. Tiny ears not recommended for this product. Picture is clear and cute"
3.0,Looks really cute in the picture and could've worked in person but I thought it was more a soft t-shirt material but it isn't soft like that and really thin. See through thin.
3.0,"Super soft and comfortable material. However, the elastic waist line is way too tight. I'm a size 9/10 in pants and these were sized Large. I wish it came in more comfortable shorts instead. Disappointed."
3.0,Skirt is very pretty & material feels soft & comfy but I ordered a size larger than I need just to be safe & it is way too small. Very disappointing!!
3.0,I only gave 3 stars because of 2 reasons<br />1 - It doesn't come with a battery which would've been nice to know before I made the purchase.<br />2 - The picture isn't as vibrant as I had hoped it'd be and as the example showed online.
3.0,"Perfect outfit for a costume, if you plan on letting your child play with it for dress up know that it is extremely cheaply made. My daughters came apart at the seam the first time she wore it. I had to end up sewing it myself."
3.0,"The back of the head had to be duct taped together from the inside so my 10 year old could wear it.  It looks terrifying, maybe because it's so large, but terrifying.  Modified the eyes a little too.  I'd love to see a smaller mask released for the neighbor some time."
3.0,This was an ok item.
3.0,"Nice product, but won't work for me.  Sizing is s/m or m/l and ran too small for my purpose.  Will be returning the cape."
3.0,"I was going to give this product 1 star because the color &#34;light pink&#34; is really a light peach color. I don't like peach, so I am returning it. I was very disappointed because the purse itself is very cute, and I can hardly ever find the icy pink color I thought I was getting. However, I received a very nice email from the seller today, apologizing that I wasn't satisfied and that the color wasn't represented correctly. So, one star for the product, but five stars for their customer service. I would definitely buy products from this seller again!"
3.0,The dress isn’t as long as the picture shows. A good 8 inches shorter on my daughter who isn’t really tall.
3.0,"This sweatshirt is thin and the fabric not super soft, but decent. You can layer if needed. <br />It is heather gray with black lettering (Brooklyn New York). <br />The style is a traditional sweatshirt - crew neck.<br />I prefer my sweatshirts to be baggy so I ordered up. Glad I did.  It is a little oversized but runs a little small, in my opinion.<br />In conclusion, this is a mid level quality sweatshirt that isn’t the best quality but can be worn."
3.0,Not as good quality very thin but this color is hard to find so I'm glad I purchased it.
3.0,Cute ... but soooooooooooo tiny !  I had to look closely to figure out what they were.
3.0,The arms are just weird...I thought it would look cool based on the picture but it's just odd so I returned it.
3.0,"Very vibrant color, but I don't do polyester"
3.0,"I gave it a chance despite other reviews.  My color is coming off after 3 days of very gentle wear.  I’ll recolor with an oil pen or nail polish but this ring isn’t worth more than $5.<br /><br />The cut of this ring would be totally awesome, but for materials they should use silver glitter silicone instead of paint over dark gray."
3.0,shoes are nice fit right but had a scuff mark on side of 1 shoe smh I'm very upset.
3.0,"Pros: The colors in the scarf are exactly as depicted in the photos white and shades of grey bordering on periwinkle.  Size is also as described - this is very large. Prince is excellent, especially on a lightning deal.<br />Cons: This fabric is not at all as I expected. It is scratchy rough, very porous and thick in texture. Y’all know how really nice sheets have a super high thread count?  This has a ridiculously LOW thread count, and you can actually see spaces between the weave. In terms of texture and feel, it is closer to a thick gauze or cheap muslin, not at all like a soft cashmere. The description Does not promise soft cashmere feel, but I assumed it was all cuddly and dreamy like a cloud. Definitely not so. Also, it was considerably more bulky than I expected so I will add bulk around your neck but not necessarily warmth given the wide/lose weave.<br />Colors are soft and luxurious like a cloud, but fabric is rough and bulky like cheap muslin or gauze."
3.0,Made very well but bought a size down (didn't come in half sizes) and way to snug. I wore them for a few days in the house to see if they would stretch but toes were very uncomfortable and not easy to slip on. They are really cute and hated to send them back but going up a whole size would then be too big.
3.0,"Nice shirt but WAY to small.  Ordered a med and it only goes a few inches down my arm. Just covers the top of my triceps. I generally wear form fitting med shirts but this fits as tight as an under armor shirt. I need to exchange it, no way it'll fit once washed."
3.0,"I received this belt in exchange for an honest and objective review. This belt appears to be very well made from quality leather. It has a heavy, solid brass buckle that also seems really durable. There is decorative red and gray stitching near the buckle (see picture).  We ordered a large which was 36”, so I believe it is true to size.  My reason for rating it 3 stars is because of the color of the belt. The color is a dark blue - not black as it appears in the photos. So, a nice well-made belt if you like the color."
3.0,It’s a good set but make sure to check when you first get them for any defects . I only noticed the 00g were broken when I was going to size up . Oh well
3.0,Very cute but they run small in bust area
3.0,Robe fit nicely and it was easy to embroider. The only problem was it came unsewn on the side seam as the bride wore it that day.
3.0,"You can very much tell it is not American made as the fabric is very thin...feels soft but cheap (if that makes any sense). Not a huge fan of the way it buttons/goes on the child but all the buttons were functional<br />Graphics are exactly as shown..colors maybe even a little more vibrant than the photos...I got a lot of compliments on it. Runs a tad on the large side in my opinion.<br />My baby also has sensitive skin and this did not irritate her not give her any rash. This is very much a case of ""you get what you pay for)"
3.0,"If you like socks for ANTS. I mean they're fine, but really, just go buy some at Target. You'll find better quality and they'll most likely be bigger."
3.0,Wish had bigger size.
3.0,Great item. Just as pictured/ described. Not too cute on me personally
3.0,This is a good basic watch<br />Display could be larger and the band is thin and rather short.<br />Over time we'll see how it holds up
3.0,If you need Solid dark lenses this brand does it right
3.0,"Three pairs!  I bought this as a three pack.  The colors were black, teal and a skull print. I ordered in May 2017, but received in July. Upon receiving, the colors were perfect, the I tried them on. The skull print was too small, the teal was too long and the black fit perfectly. I recommend that you do not buy as a bundle.  Sizes are different being that I'm an XL!<br />P"
3.0,"The quality is fine for what you pay for and the colors are nice, but they aren't long enough for tall guys.  At 6'2'' inches / 188 cm these ties run short."
3.0,"I am an exercise instructor. I do high-impact aerobics and need the &#34;girls&#34; to stay in place to endure my workout on stage. This bra fits to specifications, just make sure you're going up in size, like a cup or two and perhaps a couple of inches around the ribcage. Overall, I like the bra but still giggle a bit in workout, which is not what I'd prefer at this &#34;high&#34; of impact. I love the La Isla brand but might try others rather than order another."
3.0,"For the money, it was a pretty decent gift to give... It felt soft & the hat had a puff ball that either attached or detached, by a snap button. The receiver loved it & wore it most of the winter."
3.0,Smaller than they should have been had to give them to my daughter
3.0,"Is a bit small, and could have come in a pair set, but the single cuff earring was well made, and for price it was within reasonable bounds.<br /><br />I approve. =]"
3.0,"I like the size, color and shape of the &#34;head&#34; of the stud - it's a little cone shaped, so it sits down close to the nose, rather than sticking our, which I like.<br />However, the &#34;L&#34; shape is all wrong; I don't know who would have a nose wall that thick, that it would fit correctly with where the bend is positioned!<br />I was able to make it work by (with some difficulty) straightening it and making the bend much closer to the head of the stud (with tweezers) - but then the part on the inside was literally so long that it stuck way out and I had to trim the end off (with a wire cutting pliers)."
3.0,"Loved the pattern, but was way too small even when I ordered two sizes above what I normally wear. Communication with the seller was great and I got a portion of my money returned to me"
3.0,Couldn’t fit the pendant with other necklaces.
3.0,"Maybe not a great idea, gets caught up in sweaters"
3.0,"Decided I like leather bands better.  Makes my arm sweat, but feel it would last a long time."
3.0,had to alter it a size small fit like a size large
3.0,"A bit smaller than I expected, 2 were very pretty, 2 looked cheap and you could see the glue that was used"
3.0,"It was cheap, so I bought it. Design is very cute, but for my height it is little large. I am 5ft. Another con is it smells like gasoline when I got it. It probably goes away after few wash. Otherwise, I am happy about this purchase."
3.0,Runs wide and hard to keep tightened up.
3.0,"Looks cool, but the material feels a little cheaper than i was expecting"
3.0,"This sock is perfect,  but it runs small...had to return it :("
3.0,"It's a nice pattern, I just wish the tie was made of better quality material. It feels cheap."
3.0,It comes folded as small as possible leaving it with a very wrinkled appearance.  The material is bit stiffer than I thought it would be and so it's not a particularly attractive bag.  I do like the size and I like it for everyday use but it does look more like a &#34;work&#34; bag almost a luggage feel.
3.0,These are somewhat hard to stay on my little one's foot and they are hard to get on. He loves them and they seem comfortable for him.
3.0,I love the look and idea of this sweater. The fit is nice. Unfortunately I have not worn it. I cannot get the creases out from the packing. Super disappointed!
3.0,"Bought for company Christmas party, seemed a bit cheaply made, pockets are fake, arrived very wrinkles so luckily i had a steamer because with the lights it would be impossible to iron or throw in the dryer. The steamer worked ok, but still looked a bit rumpled. It was a hit at the party even though the lights weren’t very bright and couldn’t really be seen, even in a semi-lit room."
3.0,"I like the style,  very easy to wear with a ponytail,  but it's kind of small and keeps sliding up and exposing ears."
3.0,Was a little too small for the shoes I bought them for but my son just uses them as a toy now.
3.0,"Description said amber lenses. It means the mirror coating on the front. These are not actually amber lenses, which would have allowed for a broader spectrum of light and visibility. Perhaps broad enough to give you added energy on a bright day. They are not. They are however worth keeping around as a cheap pair for when you are too tired to care and they fall off your head onto the seat of your car. You are tired and sweaty because the sun is out and its hot and you dont have the energy to pick them up so you just sit on them. You half hope they break so you can buy actual amber lenses, and half hoping they dont so you dont have to spend hours looking for a new pair. You get up and suprise they are still working, unbroken, and smudged on the mirror because you sat on them with a sweaty rear end. They are perfect for those moments."
3.0,I have had this for about a month now. I am disappointed with the quality of them. The stitching has already started to come undone. Almost everytime I wear them they come loose and break off from the shirt. They don't stay clamped on for more then a few hours.
3.0,I’m 5’8” and 135 lbs size 10w shoe and muscular legs.  I retain water in summer and bought for when I’m sitting at work.  I bought the large/xl.  No compression due to large fit so I returned and ordered the small/medium which fit identical to the large/xl.  Returned the small/medium for another small medium which again fit exactly like the large/xlarge.  Tired of returning so kept the small medium which fits like the large/xl and don’t wear them.  Seemed to be decent quality.
3.0,"This would be cuter if it actually fit like the image, as described. I still wear it with leggings as a long shirt, but its more fitted. I would order a size up if you're ordering this product. Maybe even two sizes...It's quite short. I am 5'7 and I have long legs, so there is NO WAY, I can wear this out in public without leggings."
3.0,It just wasn't the style 4 me.
3.0,Cheaply made but it does the job
3.0,Bought these for my husband they fell apart pretty quick. He throws tires for a living take that how you will but we got our moneys worth
3.0,Its too small and the white hair is sparce and shows the cap it's attached to.
3.0,Skids and slips.
3.0,"these look cool and unique. However, you can feel the shape of the design of the bottom of the soles. I can wear these for about an hour before I give up on these. Also they are not supportive at all. These are for the looks only."
3.0,I ordered this product for my Mom to use on her keys. She is unfortunately not happy with it. Details below...<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is very shiny and cute. The rhinestone is nice and the engraving is well done<br /><br />Cons:<br />-When it is on the keys it tips downward and you can't see the engraving or the rhinestone. There is basically no point to the cuteness because it isn't really visible. It isn't weighted correctly to hang nicely.
3.0,I listened to the posted reviews which said to size up because it ran small.  I'm sorry I listened because it is too big.  The sleeves were 5&#34; to long.  I suggest getting your normal size.  I've made alterations so I'm able to wear it.  It does do a great job keeping you dry.
3.0,Not curved lenses like real Ray Bans
3.0,I got them for my grandson. I found them tight and hard to put them on him they did not give much my grandson shoe size is 11/2.
3.0,"These are more of a tights material. Not as soft as expected, nor is the fit what I expected. These are not like lularoe at all, and nor are they capris on me."
3.0,"Sweatshirt runs a bit small.  Arms fit nice and were perfect length but the body of the sweatshirt is a little short and snug in the waist.  The screen printing is not of the greatest quality so I don’t anticipate it keeping its appearance for too long.  Also, after only a couple washes it’s already starting to pill.  Overall, it’s a decent sweatshirt but it’s a bit overpriced for the quality.  This is no more than a $20 item at best.  I’ve gotten better stuff at Walmart."
3.0,"not really good for texting, comfortable and fit well."
3.0,This vest was not as long as advertised. Somewhat disappointing.
3.0,They are decent looking and quality but they run 2 sizes small.
3.0,"I'm someone who needs warm gloves to keep my hands warm in the Michigan winter. Overall I like these gloves, but I wouldn't rely on them for anything much under 30 degrees and definitely not anything in single-digit much less negative degree temps. If you need warmer gloves get Zero's -40 gloves with 3M Thinsulate, which I've tested in negative degree temps and work much better than these."
3.0,"Tacky, never worn doubt I ever will"
3.0,"I do like this tunic, BUT i have a qualm with it because the thumb holes end up on the pinky side of my hands. So I have to mess up the arm to put my thumb in. Hopefully it's just this shirt and they're not all like this because besides that this shirt is a winner.  But the whole reason i got it was because of the thumb holes and coldness of winter time, so i feel disappointed in the pinky holes, i wanted thumb holes..."
3.0,looks nice for the price
3.0,Have not washed and worn yet but it's pretty wide. For the money it's fine. Cute!
3.0,"The backings aren't strong, they fell out the very next day after I had gotten them"
3.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; and 145lbs. These are very baggy on me. Super comfortable but not really fitted well. The band around the ankle is really loose so that crumples down. The loose band around the waist gets turned around but is easy to put back.<br /><br />Everything about these is cheap, but they're great for sitting around the house."
3.0,"Ordered a XXL & it’s HUGE. VERY unflattering.<br />I usually wear L/XL. I bought two other shirts similar from Amazon, ordered those XL & they fit like L. Amazon recommended I order XL on all of<br />them, but their sizing difference shouldn’t be that horrible? I have plenty of XXL shirts that aren’t anywhere as big as this one.🫠"
3.0,"It's just like in the picture, but what I didn't expect is that it looks cheap on the bracelet, unfortunately...<br />No complains about Queenberry, they are a great store! I bought tons of silver charms for my girlfriend there and they are all awesome! But this one specifically is not just not for me."
3.0,Ordered one of these before.. really like it but there is no true size if you are a 16.... the L is a little tight and the XL is too loose i
3.0,"It's cute, it didn't make my allergies act up, it didn't turn my finger green... but as you can see from the picture, the stone fell right off. I ordered 2 and both did this. The first I don't even know where it went, just looked and the stone was gone. The one pictured I was lucky enough to catch.<br />Pretty disappointed since we loved them so much. I would say it's not very giftable since I'd hate to gift something I know will break soon.<br />But is it cute? Yeah."
3.0,"These lenses are not dark at all, even inside the house. The lenses are also not very big, maybe if you're a tiny person but at 5'4"" I'm not that big. The frames are great looking."
3.0,Fabric is very stiff and it runs small. Not as cute in person as it is in pictures but it'll do.
3.0,This was supposed to be plus size and it's not. It's cute but the people receiving it for a gift exchange weren't excited about it. It has more of an oval shape than dress shape and it's very short.
3.0,"The glasses are good other than the scratch and the crooked nosepiece.  I am returning them and reordering as I do like them, and there were quite a few good reviews.  Maybe I just got a bad pair and the person who ""tested and certified [them] to look and work like new"" was having an off day.  :)<br />Giving the company a second chance!"
3.0,"It was delivered with a broken letter, and I couldn't find a place to return it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:7ba3fb508f079dd9aaccd862adbd63e1]] Nice looking outfit. Only thing wrong. The sizes are off so if you're going to pick up one of these outfits make sure you order it one size extra above the size you want because these sizes are actually a little bit smaller than the size you think they're going to be cuz I ordered a large and it feels like it's a medium type small so pick one up today if you sure you probably think you can fit it
3.0,this is a euro made item so the zipper is on the wrong side. also need to be tall and skinny. i returned mine. quality is on line with the price.
3.0,"it was missing one stone, but had waited so long for it didn't want to return it. Hopefully, people won't notice"
3.0,"It was a very pretty dress but I am 5 foot tall and 120 pounds, I got the medium and it looked funny.<br />Wish it looked like the picture. Maybe if I was taller. Or maybe the smaller would have been better. I returned it."
3.0,If you have bigger boobs this isn't the shirt for you. Sadly
3.0,"The width of the right slipper is somewhat large.  The width of the left is perfect.  All in all, a nice pair of slippers."
3.0,"Purchased this shirt to wear to a 1950's themed event. Ordered a XXL.  I'm a size 16 , 5ft8in and 210lbs.  If I eat lunch on my event date I will not fit in this shirt.  Very tight.  Otherwise, it's great for a busty gal and has a zipper up the side."
3.0,"This was a very cute bikini, however, the top was way too small. I wear a 36 D and there was no possible way that I was fitting into this product. I wish I could have kept it, but oh well"
3.0,I ordered this tank top for myself but it’s way too tight so I gave it to my daughter.  She liked it.  It’s a very nice color.
3.0,These underwear run very small!! Order 2 sizes up. Very cute though.
3.0,"I like the material and roominess of this bag, but the zipper on the inside pouch broke on the first day of use."
3.0,I gave it three stars because it's made well and looks good. Overall the bottom size does not match with the top. The top is made way to small and if I would have went a size larger then the bottom would've been too big.
3.0,Too light
3.0,Smaller than thought. Individual wears it on her medical jacket.
3.0,Same size as other hats I've purchased but this one is very snug on my 7 3/4 head.
3.0,"It looks really nice, but it's way too big, can't fit it on my jacket. I was hoping for a bit smaller, or normal size, have the spot for that."
3.0,was hoping it would stay on my head a little better.... and it is a bit pricey...... but it's ok
3.0,"Nice shoes but too small.  I had to return, but they are very pretty"
3.0,The band is itchy around my wrist.
3.0,Gets saturated quickly during a workout. These would probably work better in a less humid environment than Florida.
3.0,"Very difficult to put on - once I do get them in place, the moment you sweat, they come loose and fall down.<br />Very cumbersome and not easy to deal with."
3.0,some pieces were broken
3.0,Love this dress and all the pockets but I have worn once and seams are coming apart at top of arms and around waist.  Not stitched well at all.  Pack a sewing kit when you wear it.
3.0,"Pretty sunglasses. They look very stylish, and I love the polarized lenses. Seems like the about the right quality for the price."
3.0,It’s very big on my face to won’t use them. The lenses work well for that they designed to do.
3.0,"Just as described, metal, glossy picture"
3.0,"Feels so nice and soft on your head. So much nicer and comfier than the ones form lululemon. PERFECT for sleeping in. Although it ripped slightly a week or two after purchase, it's so nice and comfortable I don't even mind. I wear it around the house all the time."
3.0,lenses were popped out before I opened it...
3.0,Its not terrible....but it's not like the photo either...
3.0,"Beautiful dress and great quality.<br />Sizing runs extremely small, I am usually a small size 4, ordered a size up - Medium is very tight on me"
3.0,"The item should becalled top or tunic, but not dress. It's very short."
3.0,"Comfortable, but the wireing in 2 sections of the back poke or buckle out, looks odd."
3.0,It  doesn't look as real as I hoped although around the un trained eye it will work.
3.0,"They look nice but the they are not real sun glasses. More like colored plastic. Very thin lenses, easily smeared/scratched."
3.0,"christmas present, not yet given"
3.0,The fit is small. I wanted a loose fit to wear to work.
3.0,The wallet is slightly bigger than most standard wallets. Its also very soft and bendable so i dont see it protecting cards in a man's pocket.
3.0,I wasn't a fan of the material. I don't like when it stretch it has that shiny look to it.
3.0,"Love the pockets, stripes and fabric, but is to tight where the elastic gathers."
3.0,"Cheaply made and I am afraid of loosing the charms, but it does look good on my wrist."
3.0,These are just an okay pair of gloves.  I have normal sized hands and I did find them to be rather tight....so they do not bend well.  I don't think they would be comfortable with trying to drive with them on.  The material feels okay but it is somewhat stiff.  The inside of the gloves are nice and soft and they are a good looking pair of gloves....just realize that they may run a little small.  I normally have no problems with size and any pairs I have bought in a store always fit okay.
3.0,"Skirt was well made with good thick fabric, but because of the style it felt (and looked) like a pinwheel on me.  It would be great as a smaller a-line skirt."
3.0,Even with a short torso if you raise your arms … and this is even with the large and xL … I ordered  both … either a boob is going to pop out or the attached side makes a pop noise like it wants to come apart
3.0,Average quality. Runs small.
3.0,DON'T LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT MUCH
3.0,"I ordered a large but it is still a little smaller than I would like. It's not too small to wear, but I like baggy sweaters. It's also very thin. I was expecting more of a sweatshirt thickness, but it's like a long sleeve t-shirt. Overall, it's not bad, just a little disappointing."
3.0,Love the hat but no way to tighten it. The way it's maid it won't slide to make it smaller.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress but it was tooooo long (not surprising, I am short, but it was like REALLY long) and the bodice of it was super long too. So I could have had it hemmed to fix the length problem but it was just really made for a much longer person than me so I gave it to a tall friend! Color as gorgeous though so if you're tall and long, this is the dress for you!"
3.0,Despite it being way to big she loves it.  I know when winter comes she will have to wear shirts underneath.  She prefers never to remove the item and to wear as a dress....lol.
3.0,pretty suit
3.0,My husband got this for me after I picked it out. I am very disappointed that the first time I used it the buckle fell off the front pocket and is lost. The bag itself worked OK but I am not happy with it falling apart the first time I use it.
3.0,ran a little small and I ordered a size up
3.0,"I bought this money clip for my fiancé last Christmas. I loved the price and the uniqueness of the design! Unfortunately, the image is not sealed on well, and soon, large scratches began appearing as the ink chipped off. I was able to slow this by coating it in clear nail polish, but I have to say that I was disappointed! Of course a money clip will encounter other objects over the normal course of use, whether it be keys, change, hard surfaces, etc. This is clearly meant for show, since it was not designed to hold up to normal wear & tear!"
3.0,"This dress fit perfectly. I ordered the red and it is actually a deep rosey pink. The packaging was unacceptable. It took a beautiful dress and stuffed it into a soft bag which was small enough to fit into my mailbox. It arrived completely wrinkled, more so than one would expect, and very unappealing because of that."
3.0,Bottom to small
3.0,Fits true to size but very cheaply made!
3.0,"The fabric is too wrinkly, and cheap looking. Had to return."
3.0,"Nice, I am a small person and the medium size worked well. I did not like the vinyl bows. Wish they hadn't added those. Kinda looked cheap to me so I cut them off and unfortunately that opened up the seam."
3.0,Disliked that the coat was a little too short. Fit loose.
3.0,Small for a 2XLT but it came in a lands end bag even though it was ordered from Amazon.
3.0,Seems to want to slide down and I’m constantly having to pull them up every few minutes especially while walking.
3.0,Super cute -- but broke in half.  I did not treat it roughly at all.  I loved it so much I bought a second.....and it broke too!  In the same exact place.  Cute -- but I question its ability to function properly as a key chain :(
3.0,It was bigger than I thought it would be.
3.0,size was alot larger than I thought
3.0,The shorts roll up at the bottom. Very high waisted. Makes your butt look flat from the back. Great material. Sturdy and soft. Looks great from the front and side view.
3.0,These are a full size too big. They will have to wait int he closet now until our little girl can grow into them
3.0,"super cute, and the foot fits. but a little small around my calves. not unbearable and i still wear them."
3.0,"Skulls are small, and the silver rubs off and you can see how cheap they are"
3.0,"Too long under the cups, almost feels like a no sleeve shirt.  These cross backs are so difficult to put on.  Cups comfortable (mine somewhat large but was not available in proper cup size) but not easy to put on.  Not everyone can reach behind their back to close properly."
3.0,This shirt runs extremely small. I  ordered a 14/16 for my son. It fits like an 8/10. You will definitely want to order a size bigger than what your child normally wears.
3.0,"I got the “apricot” Chicago sweatshirt. I thought the color was like a very light beige from the picture, but it’s actually pastel yellow. The fit was fine.. I wouldn’t say very oversized  in my typical size L. I should have got the XL instead of large for oversized."
3.0,"Trunks were way to small and did not offer enough room for the bits-n-goodies so I ended up returning them, however I had no problems receiving a refund from the seller."
3.0,"I ordered these bags as packaging for my jewelry sales.  They are nice bags and a good price but I only received about 7 colors...mostly reds and pinks...not the assortment represented.  So, I like them and will use them but I felt they assortment was misrepresented."
3.0,"Tint is too dark.  Cool idea, though."
3.0,OK but a bit stiff.
3.0,"I love the material and the sleeves, it's a cool cut however I ordered the largest size so it would be loose and it's not at all! Fits like a L-Xl"
3.0,Smaller than expected. I wear about a medium. I ordered a large and I should've ordered an extra large. There's no way I would've got into a medium. The large is tight. I know it's supposed to be a compression shirt but it's tighter than I'd like. I'll still use it.<br />Fabric is thinner than expected too. I'm sure larger size wouldn't stretch at much and feel thicker.
3.0,"Thought this initial one I bought would be a chinese size, ordered a larger size which turned out to be an too big I had to return it for my Ideal size."
3.0,"Material is very light, but for the price these are nice and stylish, too big for my face so had to return. I have a small face though."
3.0,Expect a faded graphic on your shirt and the size to be a little smaller than expected for a large. Also expect the seller to not reply at all to you. Customer service isn’t down their alley.
3.0,"They are soft and fit great, however, they are sheer you can see the undergarment worn under them"
3.0,"Really light, but shape does not hold."
3.0,It’s all right. Too small for my husband
3.0,One of the pockets in these shorts ripped after only wearing it twice.
3.0,"Shirt is good for just a few wears.  Fabric does not clean very well and easily stained by deodorant and perfume, even if spot treatment is used"
3.0,"Would be fine for younger gals, I prefer something just over the knee now.  It's cute."
3.0,I was looking for a white letting type pant and thought these would be great - they are OK - would have preferred a heavier fabric - that would have made them look a better on than they do.  They also need a belt to hold them up.
3.0,"Did not realize size of super extra long elastic in middle.  Product works well, but is too long for my personal needs."
3.0,No stretch and too long!
3.0,Very cute product but it runs small. Bought as a gift for my mom who is a petite woman and it wouldn’t reach her ears comfortably. Maybe more for older children than adults.
3.0,Would not recommend for big girls
3.0,I love these pj’s but after a few washes the material becomes super clingy. Everything gets stuck in them and they stuck to each other.
3.0,Does not work well in humidity. My cooling towel does a better job.
3.0,very cute! the beads fell off soon as I took it out the package but on camera it came out really cute!
3.0,Super cute! Bigger than expected so order a size down
3.0,"It's beautiful,  but the seam without the crisscross is crooked..horribly crooked.  I got a refund.  The fabric is fantastic and it's  super cute.  A little bigger than expected."
3.0,Cute but itchy!!!
3.0,"This item fits, but uncomfortable. The fabric is irritating and itchy. Just not comfortable, so returned."
3.0,"The side of the &#34;L&#34; with the stud on it is too long for my nose, so the stud sticks out too far from my nose. It looks funny.<br />If you look at the picture, I dont have a tiny nose, but the stud totally sticks out from my nose. But really, other than that, the studs are good quality for the price."
3.0,Split at toe after a few months of wear. For the price expected them to last a lot longer.
3.0,"cute, but quite small for price"
3.0,Bracelet was lighter in weight than it appears.
3.0,Size up 2 sizes.
3.0,"This is cute, but the design is printed pretty low on the chest, much lower than shown. The snaps are very weak and come apart easily."
3.0,I’ve worn thigh high socks for years and these are the most uncomfortable ones. They keep sliding down and if you pull them higher they start hurting my thighs. Once I put them on all I want to do is to take them off!
3.0,"Yesterday I got the costume it was great, took some vids but then today I wanted to cosplay again and the seams on the shirt ripped. Skirt was fine. The wig was terrible quality and would not style. I was gonna wear this cosplay to Mega Con but now I cannot. I’m gonna try and sew it back."
3.0,"Poorly made, cheap fabric but it's still cute!"
3.0,"Cute, but the top is baggy because I have a smaller chest (34a). It has a good length for tall girls (5' 6&#34;)."
3.0,Can't figure out how to change the size
3.0,"Nice belt, I feel leather could be better quality."
3.0,Is a pretty dress but is missing the belt
3.0,It was too short.  From the description I expected below the knee.  Returned it with no problem
3.0,Ended up returning it as one side wouldn't snail in place.  May try another and order a different color as didn't like the shade of pink.  3 stars as quality control lacking.
3.0,I ordered 40 lights. I tested them all as soon as I opened the package. 10 out of 40 wouldn't stay or even turn on at all. I would return them for an exchange but I need them for party favors and don't have the time to wait.
3.0,"They are very cute. But when they arrived, a couple of fruits fell off their posts so I have to get a glue gun or something to paste them back on. So I am a bit worried that they may fall off when I'm wearing them."
3.0,As described. Sometimes slips above my shoe in the back making it hard to keep them unseen.
3.0,"Functional wallet, but the leather didn't seem high quality. I prefer an oversized wallet and this one was fairly small. So I returned the item. If you prefer a smaller wallet this one is probably for you."
3.0,"Bought for my husband, He has a small narrow foot. Never wears it."
3.0,removing tarnish from silver finger rings was not too effective.
3.0,the balls strip really easy
3.0,The bracelet is lovely and exactly what I was looking for...however..the &#34;clasp&#34; did not seems to totally connect.<br />I returned the item knowing it would fall off my arm the first time I wore it.
3.0,"I like the material, the style, and the colors.  I am upset that an XL fits like a Large.  It does not fit across my chest and the spaghetti straps are too short."
3.0,"not the best top, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Had to return because the ""XL"" was more like a men's medium"
3.0,"I love the color and the material. The design is really cute and the longer length is perfect. I ordered a XXL thinking it would be oversized and not tight, but it is cut small. Too bad, in different countries it seems to be a thing: their large is our medium."
3.0,"it fit for the first run, then stretched and was much too big."
3.0,"This pin is TOO SMALL!  Just over ONE INCH. True it is a lapel pin, but being a SURVIVOR  of breast cancer I am proud to celebrate it. This is a nice pin but should be ATLEAST TWO inches long!!!"
3.0,"Takes leaving them outside for a few weeks to get the smell to fade. But kid doesn't mind, they work well and are affordable"
3.0,"So these are great for the money and if you plan to never, ever, walk around while wearing them. I don't know if it's just a defect with mine but they make me want to throw up while walking around. Otherwise they do as advertised and are great if you're driving."
3.0,"Fit was OK but the cut is not what I desired. The front pouch, which only just fit me, is shaped in such a way that my stuff bulges out straight forward in a very visible manner.  I was hoping for something more modest and practical! I may find these useful for wearing around the house in summer, but nowhere else. On the positive side, I like the comfort of the fabric."
3.0,Very nice but they are tight around the ankles.  It is very weird because you have to actually pull a little harder to get the foot through.  I have only wore one pair so far .  Other than that I really like them.
3.0,"I'm not a small person, but most large-sized clothing fits me fine. These were too small for my legs and fit more like leggings than joggers. Had to return."
3.0,"I had bought the dress to wear for work. I referred to the size chart, followed everything they said to and ordered. The pattern was so cute! And the fabric was incredibly soft, but this dress runs about a size too small. Which wouldn't be too bad, except when you stretch the material even a little it becomes incredibly see through. Would recommend to order it a size up."
3.0,It has been lightly used for 4 days in the pool and a little outside pool just walking in the pool area. It’s already falling apart on the bottom.
3.0,Very cute for the price. Great design. The chain provided is very weak. Also don’t forget to take it off before bathing or swimming otherwise the silver finish comes right off. Definitely cute though!
3.0,The material felt stiff and uncomfortable.  I love the color though.
3.0,"I really loved this watch. But after only wearing it a few times, the band broke.  I'm looking into replacing the band, but even for such a low cost, I'd expect the band to hold up for at least a few months of regular wear."
3.0,"The green shade of this dress is absolutely beautiful. It is a deep jade and can be paired well with black, gold, or silver accent pieces, and with or without tights. I am just a shade under 5'6"" and it falls just about to my knees - a really nice length. The skirt and sleeves are generously cut, and this can be worn off the shoulder or with the shoulders covered. The material is light and flowy - it is not a soft cotton feel, but it is not at all stiff. There are no odd smells to the fabric and it does not seem to bleed. The skirt portion has a top gauzey layer (as seen in photos), with a thicker opaque layer underneath. This dress is NOT see through and provides good coverage. I am about a 38DD and the chest area does accommodate me, thankfully. When I opened the package I was actually worried it would not fit, but there were no problems whatsoever. Being top heavy, the bodice is always a concern  - so seeing how much give the top portion had was a relief. Overall, it is a nice dress for the price and could be dressed up or down to fit any occasion. Shoes, jewelry, hair, and makeup styles can  easily take this anywhere from casual picnic in the park to a nice dinner out.  The material MAY snag in time, due to the adornments, so just be careful not to catch it on anything. The ties are also not incredibly sturdy but as long as you are cautious and not pulling on them too tightly they hold up fine for regular wear."
3.0,"They ran a bit large and smelled awful. So, size down and be prepared to was them at least twice before you wear them. Looks as advertised. I would recommend."
3.0,It's good but the metal ring that hold the magnet is no better than a paperclip. So within the first week we had lost the magnet..... But it's only 10 bucks and it's a cute thing to get for Valentine's day haha
3.0,Slightly cheap feeling cotton shirt. Good for one use.
3.0,"The only thing was that in all online pics the shirt is black. When it arrived it was grey. Not a deal breaker for my man, but people may want to know"
3.0,"It seemed like a nice enough shirt, but too small."
3.0,"Cute dress for sure, just go up a size. I am 5'8, 160 pounds and never wear a large - should have ordered a large. The medium ""fit"" but not comfortably.. I wore it once and ended up donating it."
3.0,Good night vision lenses
3.0,"These are only knee socks, not over-the-knee or thigh-high. Quality was decent. Just not what I was looking for."
3.0,"Sizing way off.  Large could not handle my size 9 foot in cheap Nike Evolution sneakers.  Maybe also an issue, the tightening band at the top wouldn't even match the (pretty measly) circumference of my calf.  Had to send them back.  I might reconsider in some larger size, but I did feel as if the soles were very flimsy.  That could be OK for lengthy motorcycle riding without any foot flexing but less good for many applications.  Otherwise, seemed to be an all right waterproofing bootie."
3.0,"The belt is very nice but runs small, I order a xl but it fits more like a medium"
3.0,They stretch out very easily and do not stay up
3.0,Cute<br />Smaller up top than it is at the bottom<br />Its def not for everyone
3.0,"A solid performer in most ways, but its strap and poor night light cost it a star each.  The light is too tightly near its origin on the left, causing at best only the outer digit to be visible even in pitch darkness.  The strap is a bit on the short side for individuals with broader or thicker wrists, but doesn't sweat or slip once secured.  That said, what you get for your $ is a good value, particularly in a era where large bulk, or bling is catered to over simplicity."
3.0,"I think possibly these would look good on someone a different size, but they just looked awkward on me. The pant legs were very stiff and didn't flow well"
3.0,"Just got them, super pretty and easy to clasp. But they are huge around my wrist!"
3.0,pretty small and didn't fit in my chain had to get it customized
3.0,"The is the best cashmere wrap for the money. I have bought several. Warning: the dark brown is really a toffee color. I did not have any scarves that color, so I kept it. They are thick, comfy and will keep you warm too."
3.0,"The size is just right, very soft and comfortable.  The price/performance ratio is also very high.  Only he had a bad smell when he opened the package, and it took two days to get rid of it."
3.0,"Title says &#34;joggers&#34; so I expected a thick cotton material. However, they're very thin. I have to wear a layer under them because they are see-thru. I love that they have side pockets."
3.0,It was exactly what my son ordered. . I gave it a 3 because of the sizing issue.
3.0,the XXL  is to small for me.<br />i wear XXL  shirts every day at work with no problem.<br />order one size up if you order one of these.
3.0,"Jumpsuite was great in details but the suite is for really tall people and had no petite sizes, I ordered a small and the crotch area was hanging and baggy looking. the upper part was a good fit. I ordered a medium so I know that a small would have been too tight on my upper body but good on my lower body and a large would have not been a good fit overall."
3.0,I bought this pant for yoga but it’s not comfort as i wanted. Actually it is tight for me. I also used it for one day hiking but not much comfortable.
3.0,"It's very lightweight, which is nice, and provides a reasonable degree of protection for glasses or sunglasses in a suitcase or backpack.The hook and strap came loose within minutes, however, but I didn't want that anyway. And the zipper is a bit difficult to use because the cloth it's sewn to has some &#34;give,&#34; making it hard to open with just one hand."
3.0,"I really like the cross on this necklace, but the chain is not what was advertised.  It says it's on a ball chain, but it's not.  It's on a cheap looking chain link chain. I know ball chains are not expensive looking either, but it would have looked more masculine. The cross is decent looking, but the chain kind of ruins the necklace.  That's just my opionion."
3.0,It looks cool if you're a teenager but for adults not really. It looks really cheap and for some reason when you wipe and clean them the blue tint tends to fade overtime. It also touches your face where after wearing it for awhile it leaves a mark on the bridge of your nose just between your eyes.I would probably just wear this if I am just doing yard work or some outside chores but not for going out to town.
3.0,It came too large and that is not like an over jacket... It looks wierd.
3.0,"It is a very good design but if your gonna buy it , buy it 2 sizes bigger than you normally would. it fits small it's very thin not of great quality"
3.0,Pretty dress. The bow fell off the first time she wore it but my daughter loved it. We purchased it because it resembles Hermione’s red dress and we were going to a Harry Potter event- and it worked great for that. We just wish it had lasted beyond one wear.
3.0,Absolutely gorgeous dress. I listened to the reviews and sized up. Dress was too large. My normal size would have been fine. Will unfortunately be returning.
3.0,"The color and materials are as listed. The ends of the arms are tight against my head, I have a larger head (size 8 hat)."
3.0,"The shoes themselves were very cute and my granddaughter when she finally got them she loved, unfortunately I ordered to quick and held them for her birthday present.  Now past 30 day window return and after I gave them to my granddaughter...they don't fit, I contacted the seller and found out I cannot return because it is after 30 days....and I am stuck with the shoes :(("
3.0,This jacket was too short so I returned it.
3.0,Not very well constructed.  The Rhinestones are already falling out.
3.0,"Between the online description and measurements along with reading reviews I ordered the size 10. Big mistake! Top says XL on the inside tag and boy is it ever! Way too big! Like two sizes too big! I hope my mom can alter it for me. It has no support, but that may be because it's just too big. Inexpensive price, but when it doesn't fit it isn't worth it."
3.0,la tela es muy delgada se transparenta
3.0,"Good gloves for the money, especially because wool. Cons: quality not so great. A hole where thumb meets palm on arrival, pieces of thread, and color too dark, not vibrant wine shown here. Will wear though, but probably not get more."
3.0,"This is an OK bra but, to me, it does run a little small. However, they do provide an additional extender for increasing its size where it hooks, which is a great feature. However, besides that feature, it really is just an average bra."
3.0,"Waistband too tight, otherwise fit nice"
3.0,Jeans look good
3.0,Uglier than crocs. Only reason giving 3 stars is because they’re very comfortable.
3.0,"These would have been really great if they fit. The sizing is too small. I ordered the XL thinking they would actually be too big. No way! The material is really great, compression like leggings. Just wish the sizing was more accurate."
3.0,I wouldn't waste my money on this again .<br />One of them came broken & the chains are weak
3.0,"It is not exactly what I expected, but it looks great for my best friend. However, it arrived in a small clear plastic bag. I didn’t receive any of the packaging boxes or boards that the other reviews seemed to have when the bracelet arrives. It’ll do. Doesn’t look exactly like the photo, but it’s similar."
3.0,I like it but the writing was so small I couldn't even read it with a magnifying glass
3.0,Pajamas are not form fitted. Pants much larger than top size. Warm at night  and they wash well. Just was not impressed with cut and size
3.0,They are too big and fall down a lot.  They look cool/modern design.  Cotton would have been better
3.0,Timely delivery and good product.
3.0,well worth the money very happy with it got lots of compliments on it i would hightly recommend buying it
3.0,This dress was skintight. I ordered according to the size chart and it fit like spandex :( Very sad because it was extremely cute.
3.0,they run REALLY short. i ordered 1 size up because people said they ran small. the waist is perfect at 1 size up but the length is super short they reach my ankles.
3.0,Very cute but the gold rubbed off the clasp a little easily. Looks to be high quality beyond that but not sure it will be gold forever. Maybe should have gotten a silver one!
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter to wear as a costume for her school play. She's an angel. The design is perfect for her needs. The fabric is very thin and she has to wear a tank top under it. Also, the small runs large. I'd guess it's closer to what I'd consider a medium."
3.0,The dress is pretty. The weight of the fabric was perfect for a hot wedding day. I need to have it tailored though about 3 inches on the shoulders so maybe order down a size.
3.0,Like it but was just to small.
3.0,"I bought this and another watch as a 2018 Christmas gift for a family member. He would wear this one 3 days a week and the other one the rest of the week. He really liked the classic look of this watch. It was great, however, by March the battery died. It's an easily fixable issue but it's still an issue that the battery died so quickly. This is the only watch I have purchased on Amazon to have had such a short battery life.<br /><br />Beyond battery life.... It's an okay looking watch but just to let you know it looks and feels very cheap. It was great for the person I gave it to because he wasn't a watch wearer at the time and I also had given him a second watch that was itself impressive. I knew this was a cheap watch but when it came the material felt even cheaper than expected. He paired it with long sleeved button down shirts which was perfect as those complemented it well, but when he wore it with short sleeves the cheap look was more obvious."
3.0,"It qas good quality but too big. The reviews led me to believe I needed a 5X, but it was way too big on me. As a size 18 I could have worn a 2X or 3X, but I had to return it."
3.0,The color is a little brighter than the picture depicts.  It's too bright for me and I really should have returned it but I didn't and I have never worn it.
3.0,The pants actually had no structural faults at seams. Their a little low for my taste but I have a flat butt so all pants tend to show a bit of butt if I don't wear a long shirt. Only reason for the 3 stars was that there is quite a bit of pilling in the crotch area of the pants after about a year
3.0,at first I was so happy it arrived cause it was so cute online. Upon opening I was throughly disappointed! I was expecting this charm to be 3to4 inches but that is NOT the case. While it did come in a nice drawstring pouch & it is cute BEWARE it’s smaller than a box lighter.
3.0,I love the feel of this dress but the waist was just too tight.
3.0,The bears heads are up side down on my curtains.
3.0,"Lo único malo es que una de las dos, el LED no funciona y sería chulo que encienda la luz."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress. Really nice and soft linen material. The straps are long, the boobs area big and the hips super small. In order for me to keep it I would have to shorten the straps and move the buttons or just sell it. So disappointed ☹️"
3.0,"Good buckle for bracelets. Whistle has decent volume. Fire starter is nice, but somewhat impractical due to its size and location. I could see using it as a last resort, but would go to a different fire starter first."
3.0,"It is a very nice product and it held everything I need it to, but The latch that holds it all together is very loose and the Id Holder falls off all the time. I had to go by a generic on at the store."
3.0,"They are comfortable, but extremely thin. I feel like I can’t wear them out places :( The white ones… you can see EVERYTHING!! I could see my light feckless through them. I was so disappointed!!"
3.0,Not as many sequins as pictured. Runs small in the shoulders
3.0,"Very nice but too small looked a little bigger in the pictures, doesn't hold much"
3.0,The colors are not as bright in person as they appear in the picture.
3.0,Its described for a baby but its too large almost for an adult
3.0,Nice cover up.. quality not great!
3.0,"It's made well enough, but the size chart is just blatantly dishonest"
3.0,definitely see through. its not lined at all so if you dont want something see through i would definitely pass. I order a size up cause everyone said to and im so glad i did. I normally wear a small but order this in a medium. Im 5'4 and 118 pounds. It is a little bit baggy in certain areas but if you want more of a flowy look like in the picture order a size up.
3.0,The shirt does not match the shorts and kinda has a cheap feel I ended up giving it away I was very disappointed
3.0,"Love the size. The color is little off, more greenish than gray"
3.0,"Hat is nice. It is designed to be rolled up so not to ruin the shape. Arrived rolled up and folded in half, causing a crease that can’t be fixed. Returning this product."
3.0,"These would not be warm enough in winter.  Definitely not as long as the size chart indicated the XL is supposed to be 28.8"" long but didn't even reach my ankles and I'm only 5'7"" at 133 lbs.  The XL size was way too big but I was hoping for length but that didn't work at all.  The fabric seemed too thin for my winters up at 7,300 ' elevation in the mountains."
3.0,"Well built and hard-enough even to go in a backpack, but very narrow. It accommodates one shirt only, and you better not use the hard-backing piece provided for the folding, If you do, the shirt will be too compressed and thus wrinkled. Leave the case open and let it air overnight before first use, to vent out the neoprene smell."
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes up. I'm 5'9&#34; and normally wear a large. I ordered a xxl and it fit perfectly! It was a little on the short side when I sat down. But I love this dress overall! Very flattering and i recieved lots of compliments on it!
3.0,"In spite of the description (""Pocket Stove with Windscreen, Folding Stove with Solid Fuel Tablets and Windshield"") this item did not come with fuel tabs, I had to come back to Amazon to order them. Because of that I haven't been able to try the stove yet but, just from the standpoint of construction, it appears to be well-made. Stiff, of course, since it's new but the stove stands level and is just as described. The windshield, however, is flimsy. Each panel is thin so I'm not sure how long it will hold up over time and heat. The fact that it's infinitely adjustable is one of the selling points but the tiny hinge pins, which hold the panels together, fall out. I'm going to modify them in some way to prevent that as w/o them the panel would be useless. For these reasons I give this 3 stars."
3.0,"They are too big and even thou I tried to adjust them with the velcro they still fall down from your face and the velcro from the back, the only think that I liked is that you can breath easier"
3.0,"Got this bag quickly and nicely packaged. However, there were some things that I didn't like. The Velcro that holds the flap down seems low quality and the velco strips are positioned in opposite directions which I found a little odd. Didn't seem like the velco would last very long before it bacame unusable. I wanted a small bag for day trips and outings, which this is. While the pocket sizes are fine, the openings are so small it's difficult to get my hand into the bag. I'd read in another review that the color is darker than in the photo, that's not true. If anything the color was a bit lighter than the photo. It's a decent bag for the price but not going to work for me. Returned."
3.0,granddaughter loved the rings
3.0,Bought this twice. Exact same size and color. One was perfect one was way too small
3.0,"Not terrible, not great. Cheap sandals. They squeak extremely loudly when wet and will wear down in a matter of months to the point where they are dangerously slippery and need to be replaced."
3.0,The look of these glasses is exactly what I needed for halloween. But not good for everyday use. The lenses bend the light weirdly and make my vision difficult. For costumes. The pricing and look are perfect though.
3.0,"I had expected the fabric to be a little more lightweight and a little bit cooler for summertime temperatures. It was a heavier, coarser fabric than what I had wanted. Fit true to size."
3.0,Way too small. Ordered 2 sizes up to see if that fits better.
3.0,"Very nice product, but I was under the impression that these had GLASS lenses.  Not the case.<br />Again, nice product, I will definitely wear them but they are not glass.  CLEAR yes, glass, NO."
3.0,The material is great and the 2 pockets is nice. My only issue is the seams don’t line up right. The outside seam runs down the middle of my leg and I have to pull on them to straighten everything out. They’re fine leggings for the money but I would re-purchase.
3.0,It's okay. I like how light and airy it is. But it was a tab bit long. I'm 5'3 130 lbs. The bottom hits mid calf....makes me look kinda short and so it looks like a moo moo on me. I ordered a medium. I'm really a small but  Sometimes I'm a medium depending on the dress. Some run small. But i guess this is true to size. I'm a small usually so shoulda ordered a small. But might still b too long for a short girl like me
3.0,Something on the stitching on the left side is very irritating and I find this hard to where it's not very comfortable. It does look cute
3.0,Fits smaller than expected so had to wear on finger not intended for and it was annoying after wearing for long period of time. Although  It’s a nice ring
3.0,"Cute, but not much to it, for the price."
3.0,DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ON AMAZON BUT WILL KEEP THOUGHT IT WAS YELLOW
3.0,Cute but shrunk considerably after first wash. Will have to go to the younger sister for whom it was not intended (this equals sad older sister). I even bought a size up to try to avoid this.
3.0,"Dress was perfect from the waist up...but is cut in a strong A-Line in the skirt portion. The lace detail had some stretch to it which was perfect and the color was bold and vibrant. I LOVED the way it looked and fit but the proportion was off on me, too much width through the hips, and I’m curvy."
3.0,It's good. But not really good quality.
3.0,Run large and wore out quick.
3.0,"The visors are nicely made. I think they would be great if you have a small face, or don’t want a large brim on your visor."
3.0,"Bought as a gift for a little girl. It’s pretty for what it is, but it’s no larger than a nickel."
3.0,The lettering is kind of hard to read because the background is lighter than the picture suggests.
3.0,Good for the price. Thin martial but it has good stretch. Nylon like material. Bright colors. Length is good. Goes down to the ankles and fully covered the arms
3.0,I was looking for natural cut stones.  I got enhanced stones.  They look like the picture pretty much but leave a colored residue.  I put them in water to clean them and a trail of dye came off.
3.0,"This review has nothing to do with the seller, who was great.  I was very disappointed that with only two dance classes (and barely a month after purchase) that the leotard I purchased for my daughter literally unraveled at the seam.  I don’t remember Capezio’a quality being so poor!"
3.0,"These are super cute! I purchased size 18 months for my 16 month old (20 lbs) and they fit fine with room to grow. She can wear these the rest of the winter. However, the picture is of orange pajamas with a jack-o-lantern face on them but I received orange pajamas with mini jack-o-lanterns all over them. Not a big deal since they're still cute but the picture should match the product."
3.0,"The dress is cute. Did nothing for my curves. I bought a large afraid that’s a medium would be too small but I probably should have bought a medium. However the way the material is, it’s not as fitting as the picture. It fits loose."
3.0,"The material was nice, not too see through (considering it's white) and a soft material, but the shirt was very long on me. It also had the dip in the front that made it look like a pajama top to me (like the sides of the shirt stopped at about my hips and the front dipped halfway down my thighs). Nice shirt, but better for someone with a taller top section."
3.0,"This is a two piece outfit and not a dress like advertised. The shirt fits well and reaches mid bottom, the bunny on the front is two colored depending on the angle of the sequins. The tutu is way too short and needs leggings underneath. I really wanted it to be a dress, a bit disappointed. The fabric of the shirt is soft, stretchy and breathable. Fits true to size."
3.0,Got my money's worth
3.0,"Lightweight, rusted soon after I got it. The size was exactly as advertised, very shiny."
3.0,Not as sticky as other adhesive bras and felt a bit like it was falling off. It never did though?
3.0,"I’m a true 2x, this didn’t fit."
3.0,Looks nice but has a sticky substance on it along the edges
3.0,"I still like.it, but it tarnished and cleaning it removed the rose gold color"
3.0,Definitely order a size or two up. It’s too tight around my waist. I love the dress but I’ll have to lose weight before I can wear it. Great quality though
3.0,"I ordered this from Dear Lover, so I assume it’s the same quality top. Has that “digital print” look."
3.0,It was cute but found something better.
3.0,"I normally wear Small in most brands and while this &#34;fit,&#34; it was a bit tight. The fabric was not at all what I expected. It was pretty thick, heavy, and stiff."
3.0,"The idea is a cute one. From the picture I imagined a thicker cotton with some stretch. This material feels more polyester and stretchy, easily wrinkled. The waist is a bit large. I ordered medium and have 28&#34; waist.  You will want to wear a petticoat if you want to have the full look on the skirt. By itself the skirt does not hang as nicely. This can be attributed to the quality of the fabric."
3.0,Beautiful stones!  Too heavy for my ears.
3.0,"Too big, too bulky, very difficult to use."
3.0,"Look and feel nice but wont install securely on my Galaxy Watch 4 44mm, I'm sending these back."
3.0,MUCH SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED
3.0,"Pretty thin material. It’s comfortable but it does seem and look cheap. I don’t like that the graphic is glossy-however the customer service is awesome, and even reached out to me about my issue!"
3.0,"I have terrible luck with wood plugs. They are beautiful but too large for me. Second pair of wooden plugs that I have a problem with, I have no issues with the metal plugs. Oh well."
3.0,The poster is exactly what we expected. The poster holder is useless. We can't keep it on the wall. Guess we need to buy a real frame.
3.0,"I had another hat I puchased in a hat store a few years ago, same brand in x large so I assumed the x large would be the same. I purchased 2 in different colors and they are both way too big. Love the style and quality. Just wish they fit."
3.0,TOO SMALL BUT I STILL LIKE IT
3.0,"Unfortunately, the shirt was too tight across my abdomen.  There was some stretch to the fabric but it didn't fall right over the belly so I returned it.  If you're a pear shape I bet it would look great."
3.0,"I bought it for my daughter. She is 5' and 2&#34; tall, small build. Ordered medium size but it was too big on her. It looks large when she put its on. Should ordered small. Nice looking design but not good quality."
3.0,"these glasses were really nice till the broke about a month into owning them. the frame is nice and strong and flexible but the glass parts are screwed in rather than clipped so the glass cracked in the corner and a lens fell out. till that point they were great glasses, I wish they just didn't put a tiny screw through the glass to hold it on."
3.0,Too tight for a larger men's head. Does not stretch as much as I would have expected.
3.0,"It fits great, but the fabric is cheap and very thin."
3.0,Ok gloves for cool temp or if you are in car not the driver hands slip alot on the steering wheel. Touch screen good comfort good warmth just ok
3.0,The fluff doesn't match the photo. It's very flat.
3.0,"The dress is cute, doesn’t fit me. I ordered an XL- it fits more like a Medium."
3.0,"For starters this was huge. The size was much larger than I normally would have ordered but considering Asian sizing typically runs super small I was expecting this to be not so tremendous. Size aside, the interior has an odd lining to it so the softness of the coat is only felt from the outside and I was truly looking for something more cuddly. Not quite what I expected."
3.0,"These are adorable but so HUGEEEE. If you are into baggy socks, these are for you!"
3.0,Very cute but way too small.  Order like 2 sizes larger!
3.0,this is an awkward fitting bathing suit. I dont recommend it.
3.0,The fit was not ad expected
3.0,Esta prfecto
3.0,Good quality and would prevent rashes but too big for me :(
3.0,The inseam was shorter than I thought it would be so I ended up returning them.
3.0,"The dress is exactly as shown. My daughter hasn't tried it on yet but it looks true to size. Good quality compared to the options available in stores. My only complaint is when I opened the box, the bag containing the dress was soaked in some type of oil. Luckily, the dress wasn't damaged."
3.0,Small and cute . Not quite as shiny as I'd have liked.
3.0,was wanting something larger but its very nice and unique for my documents at school
3.0,Has broken two times so far. :/
3.0,"Cute and decent accessories for one night. The cute kitty bell from the choker came off, the ribbons from the lace gloves came off. Nonetheless, my outfit as a kitty was still successful with out the cheap material"
3.0,I like the band but it was not large enough for my wrist.it just fit with no room for expansion.
3.0,It has been less than a month the lining has separated from the shell. It still functions as a case and protects my glasses and the shell claps shut with a strong spring. The leather like cover looks and feels ok on the exposed parts. It would have been exactly what I wanted if only they would have used better adhesive.
3.0,Had to reorder as it was too small
3.0,Okay. Not my favorite
3.0,These are really hard to clasp/remove so be sure to put them in not expecting to change frequently
3.0,They fit shorter than I'd like. I am 5'8&#34; and 153lbs. They fit great around my body. I just wish they were a bit longer.
3.0,This is not blue. It’s black.
3.0,Very warm but falls apart fast
3.0,"Not the greatest quality.. but was in a pinch. Had to return the first because of a stain, but it’s cheaply made.. pocket was sewn crooked and it’s not really 2 pocket.. just a seam at the top of it. Seller is good.. replaced the first. But it’s not good quality."
3.0,SmAller than expected
3.0,"This product was misleadingly described as for small adults and women.  I could get the ear muffs on but they were super tight ...no adjustment was available on the ear muffs.  I tried them for several days and came to the conclusion that the muffs were too small for me. I would return, but I have now used them.  The ear muffs are good children only!"
3.0,It was very cute but it ended up being very tight fitting.
3.0,The bag is okay. Please note this is NOT real leather! Will update if any problems arise.
3.0,"These glasses transmit a very clear image and did seem to reduce eye discomfort during computer use.  The frame is attractive and well made, if a little heavy.  I do not believe that they reduce the intensity of blue colors or blue lights as much as some orange tinted lens, but they can be helpful for eye comfort."
3.0,"So it’s not green and black, more like a  bluish and green ohh well for 5 bucks can’t complain to much🤷🏻‍♂️"
3.0,These are pretty earrings but they fall forward once you’ve had them in for a while. The jewel part ends up facing down so unless you constantly straighten  them you can’t appreciate how pretty they are.
3.0,Cute little earrings but not as advertised. Listed at .6”. I put a micrometer on them and they were .46. It may seem inconsequential but with an item like this it makes a difference. Back they go
3.0,The sideburns are not aligned.
3.0,Size I got was 3T and it’s huge dose not fit my daughter yet
3.0,The breast part fits weird. The quality is not bad and it was shorter than I expected but the print is nicer in person. I really thought I'd love this dress but my breasts are bound to pop out at some point. I'm sorry I won't be able to wear it.
3.0,This shirt runs very small.  I like the design but it looks like it was stamped on.
3.0,"Looks nice and good made, the only thing is: there is not much room between insole and upper part, so you need to have really flat feet to wear it, otherwise they are too tight. Went back."
3.0,Prettier in the photo.
3.0,Thought might be a bit bigger but a beautiful meaningful charm
3.0,I love the Farm series and generally love the hats. This one missed the mark. It was creased really bad the patch had strings hanging off and the same with the mesh on the hat too. Otherwise a good hat.
3.0,Have had these for 4 days. Nice fit. Very comfortable. Only problem is the fabric insole on the right slipper has already started to come undone. No problem with the left.
3.0,Mine opened up while wearing.  I was grateful it didn't come out since it was a newer piercing.  Looks nice.
3.0,I didn't use it. But it has to have a battery to work it and not included with it. Not how I expected it to be used.
3.0,I cant get it on my ear I would not recommend people getting this only get it if u choose not to wear it don't want to return it because I like the dragon.
3.0,Really thick for the nose.
3.0,not comfortable insole
3.0,This material is not as soft or sheer as I would have liked.
3.0,I went back and forth between a medium and large before I ordered. I went with the large and it fits like a medium would in any other brand/style. The sleeves are a little short and they have a weird seem/bowing around the cuff - can look cheap
3.0,"I'm 5&#34;5' and 195 lbs. My torso is long so these bottoms ride pretty low on me, especially since I have a big booty too. For 16 dollars, this isn't a bad deal. The top is cute, I'll likely wear it with different bottoms though. The color is really pretty. Some loose strings on the top."
3.0,sun glasses ok
3.0,"Beautiful belly ring, however as soon as I took it out if the package and unscrewed the ball, some of the plated gold peeled off. A few weeks later the bottom piece fell off."
3.0,"Jacket seems like a decent quality , finally got the smallest size and it’s still HUGE on my 9 year old."
3.0,"I absolutely love it but there's one problem, after only having it for two days it got a tear on the side. Very disappointing that it already has a blemish."
3.0,Looks dope but too small
3.0,"Nice shirt, runs super small XXL way to small for that size"
3.0,Soft material and cute design but not oversized like I wanted. Its pretty tight fitting and not as long as I expected.
3.0,"When pulling the pants on, the stitching breaks that is in the elastic.  It makes that ripping sound. I didn't have them even up past my knees when it started so it wasn't like they were being stretched too far or anything.  Then after wearing them for about 10 minutes, I had to continually pull them up as if they were too big which they weren't."
3.0,"Very disappointed with the material , definitely not the same that I bought before in Macy’s"
3.0,"I used this product because I got grass stains on my Adidas light blue parley shoes after an afternoon outside. Overall it worked pretty well to get them off, but not perfect. I'm hoping to let them dry for a day and try again to see if it gets it all the way off."
3.0,This necklace is not as long as the picture. It hits above my shirt. It is cute to use as a dainty stackable necklace with the other necklace I bought. For the price it’s worth it.
3.0,Really small and really thin :(
3.0,5’8” 145 and this was snug. I’m not big in tight clothes so i will probably exchange for the next size up. Super soft material and cut is really cute.
3.0,"The top was not as good as it looked online as the material was unimpressive, it easily creases"
3.0,"I normally wear either a large or an XL. I decided to get an XL just in case. (5ft 4, 165lb). The top portion is so tight and the waist sits so high (almost like an empire waist....) and the material is extremely see through. I'm going to need to buy a slip for sure to be able to wear this outside. I got this for a halloween costume, so it'll do."
3.0,Good glasses did ok job keeping out wind.
3.0,"The quality of the mask is okay.  It looks like the photo.  Two issues, the mask was cut incorrectly so it is not symmetrical and doesn't hang properly.  To make matters worse, the straps are in the wrong place.  Also, the eye holes are a bit off.<br />That all said, workable for this price.  Other sellers were offering the same mask for double the price.<br />We will do our best to adjust the mask and make it work."
3.0,This scarf is not very good quality. I kept it because it is a color palette that is hard to find and one I'm missing from my collection.
3.0,cut really small. D cup fits more like a B cup. However it would have been perfect had the cup size been accurate.
3.0,"It does the job, but very small"
3.0,Wasn't the most comfortable
3.0,"I bought these for a trip 4-wheeling in Arkansas the weekend before Thanksgiving.  My son told me his hands were not that warm, luckily my sister-in-law had an extra set on gloves he could wear with these.  I read the reviews on these and figured they would be good but..."
3.0,"a lot of the same but different....example (several flowers but different rose, daisy, sunflower, ect) I ended up doing 2 bracelets<br /> for 2 different  people...so it worked out OK."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this and really needed something like this but it was way too big to do any kind of visible improvement. I usually wear XL, 10-12 in US sizes in almost all clothing so based on that I went with XL, thinking with Asian sizes , going up is better. Not the case with this one. Don't get me wrong, it fit but not in a way where it helped hold any extra handles in like I wanted this for. It just fit like a piece of clothing would fit. Will return and get a smaller size. I'll update my review once I get the better fit on how it actually works.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,You can’t really wear a bras with this shirt so the bottom half of my boob would show.
3.0,Good shorts. Fits good. But if you sweat be aware these shorts show all wetness. Looked like I peed after my run 🤣 I would not buy again and from now on I will not be buying workout shorts that are cotton
3.0,"the blue and the pink dress fit differently, I bought both. the blue is great, the 'waistline' hits at midriff.  the pink hits so high it cuts right across my bust. they both fit and flow nicely once the elastic is taken out, makes all the difference. (an easy job).  runs very long, drags on floor at 5'5&#34;.  fabric is silky-stretchy, lightweight but not quite see-thru.  nice for the bargain price once elastic is gone."
3.0,Looks good when it arrived. After two washes it has sadly started to pill. I tend to wash and dry or accidentally dry and it doesn't hold up well if you are a wash and dry kind of girl. Already bought a second as I like the look but will have to try not to dry. I bought another version of this also that seems like a better washable fabric same brand just different material. I'm hoping for better washing results. Looks good and small fit my 5'3 105 lb frame as pictured.
3.0,"Simply not fitted enough and too light of color. Wasn't what I was looking for. Would be cute in summer, but looking for fall shirt"
3.0,Decent fabric.
3.0,I think I am going to have to put some stretchers in the toe area.
3.0,"The dressed was pretty, it got good, but it was not purple. It's definitely burgundy. I would have sent it back but the party I ordered it for was in three days."
3.0,"MiracleSuit is very, very well made with great underwiring.  I didn't even try this one on, cause I knew I wasn't keeping it since it had no foam padding in the bust (someone has taken it out before it even got to me).  Also, the red in the suit is orange--orange enough you could not even try and pass it off as red, so I have no idea why they show red in their ad say it is red.  It isn't.  But the suit itself is super well made you can tell.  I sent mine back and got a refund on it after a little hassle with Amazon, since this company didn't give a refund automatically (not a big problem but stay on it if you order from here)."
3.0,safety insert uncomfortable; lens ok
3.0,"Pain in the butt to get on, but works well *IF* you can get it on. You really need at least three hands to get the zipper up - one on each side to pull the zipper sides close together, and a third to actually pull the zipper."
3.0,This swim suit was not the right size. i ordered a 3x and it was more like an ex large.
3.0,My son seems to be getting blisters from the &#34;upper sock&#34; on the shoe.  A few other parents at the soccer club said their boys were having the same issue.
3.0,"I wear a 14-16 in most jeans, and bought a 2X after reading reviews that they run small. Can't get the suckers up past my knees. They run WAY small."
3.0,"Runs bigger in the butt. Returned,but didn't order size down."
3.0,Its a cute design but it came with a smell of metal the size of a coin too just to let y’all know.
3.0,"The overall quality seems very good and the material is really nice, but the fit around the legs is super tight. If you like that, great - I'll be returning them."
3.0,Nice skirt but too small
3.0,Stretched out to quickly
3.0,Pretty dress but I ended up returning it because the open back fit weird and the slip didn’t cover my butt.<br />The material was pretty thin and I would have loved for it to work out.
3.0,"Im 5'7 @ 188lbs, I bought a large.  This is suppose to be a dress, however its so super short I wear it aa a blouse/top.  material is nice, colors are bright, overall its a nice throw on."
3.0,I just wash this pants today. The color bleed. Luckily I put the color catcher into the wash. So others clothes are safe.<br />But it is a comfy pants and has such a lovely vibrant color.
3.0,Loved the feel of this dress. I love how it can be machined wash and not have to be dry cleaned. It looked great on but just a little to snug. That is on me though.
3.0,"Seems like okay material, but definitely looks cheap as they claim, being single sided print."
3.0,Didn't like ran really small
3.0,"one... this item is cheaper from the komuso site (which other reviews do mention)... two... the moksha breathing necklace is about half the price on etsy.<br /><br />I have not had these for very long... but i was curious about comparing to the shift by komuso. i could not find any reviews that compared both. my initial thoughts are they are basically the same. i like the way the komuso feels against my lips because of the little slant at the mouth, i also like that you can easily switch out the chain on the komuso, the moksha requires maybe jeweler pliers to switch out the chain if desired. that being said, both items are very nicely made, both show fingerprints (moksha is shiny and komuso matte) but the moksha has a MUCH better pricing and comes with a nicer chain (i did not opt to pay more money to get the shift's ""fancy"" chain). the chain on the komuso is slightly longer than the moksha, though i can slip them both over my head rather easily, my husband can only do with the komuso.<br /><br />in the end, i would recommend the moksha over the shift as the slant of the komuso actually makes it so i have to hold the shift in my mouth vs being able to just have moksha in my mouth and having my hands free. though if it matters to some people, the chain on the komuso is a little longer than the moksha<br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase of the moksha and for now i'm debating whether i want to just return the komuso and only keep moksha or if i would want to have two breathing necklaces. i have yet to report as others have if they will help in my venture to quit smoking, but so far, it seems to help with anxiety (i have not yet been able to try it in a really high anxiety situation, but just in day to day life, i think it helps)"
3.0,The bottoms are not what I expected and a little tight.
3.0,Ruffles did not stand out like on the picture.They were very flat😡
3.0,"Beautiful purse, just too small...ordered it for my 10 year old granddaughter, just so small.."
3.0,"I was excited when I received my packing cubes but that excitement was short lived. I heard all about packing cubes from friends and coworkers and was excited to use it on my upcoming trip. However, after putting a couple of items in the toiletry bag it started to come apart at the seams. I think I received a lemon because new things aren't supposed to come apart like that. If you are afraid that these cubes could be too small, don't be. Before the issue with the toiletry bag, I didn't have to roll my clothes like I usually and everything fit. If it weren't for my issue then I would have probably kept the item."
3.0,"It's a great shirt, but apparently won't make your ex-girlfriend want to get back together with you for sending it.  I'd give it 5 stars, if it could do that."
3.0,Bought for use as a work shirt for volunteer work. Not bad for the price but the large size is more like a medium. The sleeves are also too short for a large and are very tight around the wrist when you button it and I have small wrists. Order a size up.
3.0,I do not like the wide fit at the hips. I like the zip pockets and the material ( it's lightweight but helps with the wind chill).
3.0,"The dress was just ok....super cute, but quality was poor toward the top where the lace is. We had to take it to a tailor to have it taken up around the chest and the strap at the neck was literally hanging by a thread. Overall, it was a cute dress, but for sure quality issues. I had to spend $34 extra to have it repaired to wear."
3.0,"These aren't sturdy at all. Luckily, they worked for a Halloween costume, and after, one silver earring broke. If you need something cheap that you won't mind if it doesn't last, this is it."
3.0,"1. There is 'no' [custom made size] option available on my end, otherwise I would have opted for that.<br />2. Given the fact that the buyer has to make all the adjustments; if they're capable of sewing (which thankfully I am. I just bought this on a whim.), I honestly think that the price of the bodysuit combined with the shipping is WAY too high.<br />3. The stitch on the fingers of the gloves is crazy pointy/uneven. I planned on cutting these off anyway.<br />4. The waist stitch does sit at my waist, but it is a little unforgiving (tight).<br />5. The fabric is transparent at the toes, which means it will be so in other areas.<br />6. I'm 5'6. I'm a 46' DD. I think a lot of these lovely reviewers were probably under 5'5 and under 155ibs. so, be careful ordering if you're taller and have a larger rib/breast/shoulder area, because I ordered a 3XL for some 'give' for a body shaper, but I think it's a 2XL masquerading as a 3XL.<br />6. Positive: The shipping was hell-a fast.<br />7. Positive: It will keep you warm.<br />8. Positive: I'm sure the seller is nice.<br />9. Positive: The fabric is soft.<br /><br />The concept is cool, but I won't be ordering on a whim again."
3.0,"Nice looking watch. However the band is too big on me will have to have it adjusted in order to wear, which I will have to pay for."
3.0,Heavier than thought
3.0,Good socks except to tight wear strips are located. Not alot of stretch for my liking
3.0,"It just didn't fit my wife well.  I can't really say the fit was too large or too small... It was a bit of both.  The sleeves were tight but the waist and hips flared out. There was nothing wrong with the quality of the items, just a poor fit."
3.0,Very nice my granddaughters happy with it
3.0,"Pretty, Ethnadore Bohemian Vintage Antique Indian Oxidized Silver Crystal CZ Choker Necklace Earrings Set, a little too chunky for me but not too heavy. The metal itches my skin. A little high priced for what it is."
3.0,"too small per size chart measurements, returned it."
3.0,"Only issue, I have now Idea on how to clean them."
3.0,This same charm is sold on many sites and was worth what I paid for it on Amazon. It was just average and had nothing spectacular to recommend it over any other bell charm. It suited the price and is an adequate addition for a charm bracelet.
3.0,"nice idea but its a bit too bulky, even though my phone isnt all that big. i also wish the velcro was the entire length of the strap (at least the softer velcro side if not the scratchy side) instead of having three separate pieces to try and latch on to. i'll probably just end up doing my own adjustments to it."
3.0,"The quality is just as described.  I'm 5'6'' 148lbs and normally wear a sz 6.  I ordered a tag size XL.<br />This suit fits great, except for it being very tight at the knee. It almost appears that there should be more stretch at the hem.  I'm not sure if this would cut off my circulation while swimming or lead to cramping, so I ordered a size up to compare the fit. I'll update my review when the XXL arrives."
3.0,"TINY! I am 5'2&#34; and 120 lbs, 34C and could not zip it at all. The dress was knee length but the apron is so small that the band that ties in the back was across the bust instead of at the waist. Adorable and nice fabric though. Sadly, it will be returned."
3.0,Very cheap looking and see-through
3.0,"It was pretty when it was received, however the finish started coming off after about a week of wearing."
3.0,"The metal is thin and easily bends out of shape. For those with heavier keys or use the key ring as leverage for opening doors, I’d look somewhere else"
3.0,"Looks like great quality, however they run VERY narrow. I could barely get my foot into the front half of the shoe."
3.0,I think it is so beautiful but I'm not happy at all with the bottom part bangle it's all scratch and looks like the silver is peeling off not good at all it doesn't look new it looks used
3.0,Shorts are too big
3.0,"La tela es de calidad media, y la medida es china"
3.0,I absolutely love my new cateye glasses! BUT they are way way too tight on my head so they give me a headache. They say they are for women but I think they would only fit a little girl. So like I said....love them but can't wear them. Disappointed!
3.0,Much smaller than expected but very pretty.
3.0,"Great fit, more see-through than I had anticipated  though."
3.0,The gray ones are pretty see through unfortunately.
3.0,Doesn’t stretch very well and fits tights
3.0,Cute but runs EXTREMELY small! Size up 2 or more! I ordered a 12/14 but was barely able to get it up and they were skin tight! I am returning for the biggest size... hope they fit
3.0,As in headline.
3.0,"I just got these in today, and they're so-so. I wear a 14 in pants, and can wear these, but they wouldn't fit anyone larger than me. They're tight, and the stretch is limited all over.<br />The black stripes look grey on the thighs, but the color is still good on the calves, so these probably look best on skinny girls.<br />Also if you're bigger, the stripes won't be straight, but sorta crooked.<br />I'll probably wear them with a tunic shirt."
3.0,It is okay. The volleyball in the middle is like a sticker. It is not silver like it appears in the picture.
3.0,NONE of the pieces match. They’re just all different things that are gray. The earmuffs are kind of short so they aren’t great for people with thicker hair.
3.0,"I love the looks of the belt, but it has a warning that some chemicals used in the making of the belt, may cause birth defects and cancer.<br />I wish they would have stated that in the description of the belt, but I guess that would have deterred people from purchasing the belt.  I know that, I wouldn't have purchased it.  I am too lazy to send it back and since I am 70 years old it doesn't matter as much as it would for a young person.  Oh, it is made in China, of course."
3.0,"I bought these based off of the many good reviews. These lack compression. There’s no tummy control for me, it actually gave me a bulge."
3.0,Box was crushed when arrived and the shoe is already falling apart. Expected more for my money
3.0,"Loved the patterns, they were very cute. Thin material, my 5 year old had a rip in the crotch within two weeks. 3 stars because of the quality but the over all patterns are very adorable."
3.0,This product works amazing deterring my dog from chewing on anything. Shortly after spraying an area both mine and my daughters throats were scratchy. Felt like as much as we coughed it didn’t help. Doesn’t smell at all so I was confused what was making my throat scratchy.
3.0,"I really like it, I bought it for my daughter and she loved it. Only problem is it broke the second time she put it on"
3.0,the two bracelets are nice but the actual charms are too small. cant really see what they say unless you are up close.
3.0,A smaller size would have been better. The print was pretty and it was soft.
3.0,"Color and style are beautiful. Material is thin, somewhat scratchy. The cut of the top was not flattering for my 36B cup size, I had trouble matching a bra with it. It also took over 2 weeks to ship to me, even though it was listed as Prime."
3.0,"Fit is weird. Loose at top, snug in the middle. Armpits airing out. It looks great with a blazer or fancy jacket on top, but not flattering at all around arms/pits. Fit is really weird compared to other, similar shirts I’ve had. The color is awesome though, and because it’ll look good under a buttoned blazer, I’ll save it for fall/winter when it makes sense to wear those things."
3.0,"I am 5'4"" and this dress was too short for me.  Also the stitching was not the best.  I ended up keeping it and giving it too my daughter."
3.0,Key holder broke quickly. No other complaints. It holds my keys with a new ring.
3.0,My daughter didn't care for how the headband fit her head.
3.0,"Good quality for price, however like 3 of the chains came with no extended links. Overall good quality material and sturdy."
3.0,"A bit smaller than what I expected but still very cute!  Nice sweater overall, just wish I had bought a bigger size."
3.0,cute informal dress<br />Great fit
3.0,"This is thin, more like a cover up not a jacket al all. But the style is exactly what I was looking for. FYI if you're short like me (5'2) it is a tad long."
3.0,Again....super cute...but VERY NARROW
3.0,This was too large.
3.0,I like the product especially the gold hardware but it is too short.
3.0,I was expecting a more thick material. They are very soft. The ear loop is too loose for me and can not be adjusted.
3.0,love the color; very comfortable but the fabric is a bit flimsy.
3.0,The release slips and causes the bracelet to fall off my arm.  I have to use a small rubber band wrapped around the release to keep it from releasing on it's own.
3.0,Cute. Using for costume. Veil barely covers top of hat
3.0,Color is not meatball. That was what I needed. Disappointed. I won't order again. Color off
3.0,"Super cute and light weight, but some of them came broken which was really disappointing. The two colors I was really excited for too.<br />Also, the shades of some colors vary so it’s hard to make exact pairs. For the price though, not bad."
3.0,I got these for me and my boyfriend but I noticed every time I accidentally scratch it barley the paint job on it is scratched up it’s copper and the planet thing is very stiff to move around ( the “crystals” are fake to any of you wondering😊)
3.0,I've wore it twice for performances and the paint had already rubbed off two of the parts. I cut the tie strings and replaced it with elastic as the tie never really held it in place.
3.0,"It's a thin and lightweight dress, the style is not bad.<br />My daughter is not yet three years old, she is 38“ tall and 33 lbs, she is already wearing clothes that are four, so I chose a 4T size, which fits her well.<br />She wore it all day and was happy with it.<br />There are some flaws in the workmanship, such as the label should be cut off before wearing it, otherwise the neck will feel uncomfortable. And I think the zipper could have been handled better."
3.0,"It does wrinkle and it is a bit thin; it's also larger than expected. But overall good for its purpose - being worn by my husband on top of his usual t-shirt, when I nag him it's too cold outside.<br /><br />P.S. I never ever review products on demand or get discounts from companies; this is my honest consumer opinion."
3.0,"This was for my daughter's phone. It fit properly, but didn't allow the phone to charge wirelessly."
3.0,"Exactly as described but not worth the money, should be 2 or 3 dollars max, not 5 or 6. Very thin and slide off easily, had to secure with a rubber band around my wrist for using."
3.0,The colors are beautiful. They are rather large.
3.0,The skirt is shorter than what you see in the pictures. It stops mid-calf. Cute but disappointing when expecting it to be longer.
3.0,Very nice but the closure broke easy
3.0,The color and pattern is very cute though the shirt runs very large. I recommend ordering a size down.
3.0,"My child was not too thrilled to play with this. She literally rather play with her older one that made noises and was super colorful. Cute kitchen though. The little faucet part got a huge hole in it after putting it together, but everything else was ok."
3.0,Beautiful but lace parts reaps easily.
3.0,"I received a completely different style than ordered.  Correct color- which is a beautiful crisp white, soft and flowy fabric.<br /><br />The collar on the shirt I received has small buttons which are cute- but was hoping for the sheer!"
3.0,SMall holes are already starting to form after a few months of use.
3.0,"Overall, this is an OK product.  The shield can be pulled down tight on the bill in order to be effective.  My main problem is that the picture for the product makes one think that the shield itself is a hard plastic, when what I received is a flexible, wrinkled clear vinyl.  Will likely return and get the fishing hat."
3.0,"I would like to give these a better rating - they were great for the first three days then things went south. .<br />First the lens detached from the frame, but I was able to glue them back n place.<br />After that my dog and I were playing, the sunglasses slipped off, hit the floor and the lens broke; no repair this time."
3.0,The elastic in the waist is a bit snug- doesn’t give much.  Very cute pants though.
3.0,A little tight getting over hips. I am a short small women and these fit great. They are draw string so no button to loosen to pull up. Cute.
3.0,Nice jumper but too tight
3.0,huh
3.0,"Looks great, soft, good fit. However I ordered the green dress and was sent a grey."
3.0,The fabric (material ) was lovely. However it didnt fit properly as I expected it to be. But its a good product
3.0,I really like the the top and the quality is quite nice but as with most tops that are made in China the size is NEVER right.  If I order a L it is like XXL or a Med is a Lg.  This top is from the same company where I had to order a Sm to get another top to fit.  So I thought I was clever by ordering a Sm.  Well I got a top that is so petite I better order a ????  I'll try a Lg and see what happens.  My mailman must wonder what I am up to.
3.0,Product fit as expected. The Product was very stiff and did not keep you warm. Felt like needed another light jacket on with it . The hat was big and floppy like going down in my eyes very difficult to walk and see.
3.0,"Fits small, one size fits most.."
3.0,"Nice color, feels soft, other than that, the sweater is a lot shorter than what is shown in the picture.  I’m 5’4” wear an XL, and never had a problem with shirt lengths.  It comes about 3” below my waste, the pockets are at my waist and will not stay inside the pocket slit.  Arms, shoulders, bust are all fine.  I won’t reorder, will sew the pockets close and use as a house sweater."
3.0,The back is open and not solid so it is lightweight and I do have concerns with how long it will last.
3.0,"Wonderful, soft & comfortable.  Print will wash off though."
3.0,"Purchased for a costume. Fine, especially for the price. The surface of the metal links are cut almost faceted, in a way as such to provide more &#34;sparkle&#34; (I assume). Kinda cheap looking, but hey...it is. Totally serviceable."
3.0,"OK quality, Not the best. Washes pretty nice. Not what picture showed."
3.0,Make sure to order a couple sizes larger. It was way too small. The color was sharp though. I didn't reorder.
3.0,These are not the same as in picture. There in no pockets either and they don’t go very high up about 2 inches. They are soft and comfortable though
3.0,"great at first, now after 3 months the stickers start to move around in his shoe. its a great idea as u can write whatever u want. i just put another sticker in."
3.0,"Mom loves these..they really are  just  beautiful , but unfortunately , one of the earring backs was soldered on in such a way that  the clip  won't  close  properly.  The earring just slides off.  Will return for exchange and hope this was a one-off problem.  I want a pair as well!"
3.0,At 5'7' and 140 lbs. large was too big. The pink was not as bright as in the picture on the website.
3.0,"I was excited to get this top. Then when I put my hands in the pocket, I found a huge hole in it. I got this top in three colors and all three had holes in the pockets."
3.0,Nice fabric nice car but way too small
3.0,"*I have yet to put them in and see if they last - my piercing is a little tender*<br />My order came after 16 days, and I'm missing one clicker, I'll be contacting the seller and editing this with an update.<br />They only have a 3 right now because one is missing and the skull in particular looks different in irl. It's eyes are more shaped like sunglasses than two individual sockets.<br />5/24/17"
3.0,The dress is beautiful but it's so tight in the chest area.  One of my friends is going to help me sew a stretchy fabric piece in that area.  The dress will be perfect for my second wedding on our tiny sailboat; then casual cookout reception to follow.  I'm 5'5&#34; 200lbs and ordered the 3x.  Wear XL tops and 16 pants.
3.0,Was super cute but The top was waaaay too small. The tank top and bottom fit well but the top was just not long enough. Seems to be well made and great for water sports while still looking cute.
3.0,Love the shorts and the feel of the shirt.  The only thing I didn’t like about the shirt was the white bands.  My arms are a little bigger in that area and was tight and uncomfortable if they rolled up while I was sleeping
3.0,"Pretty snocker, but the knot is really tight, which makes it a hasle to put it in. Good to train though"
3.0,"Mostly good quality, but the zippers are on the cheap side and break easily"
3.0,The cyclops glasses looked good with the spaceman costume I was wearing.<br />Only problem is for it to rest on the bridge of the nose it's then high and your eyes see under them. Not a big problem as just pull them down slightly. Would be better if they had some LED lights.
3.0,Biggest problem was returning it when it didn’t fit perfectly. I was able to get a return address in Oregon instead of sending it back to China.
3.0,". The cross over the front I think may have been accidentally sewn on the back...because the tag for the shirt size is located right next to one of the straps. (it's sewn backwards. The fabric is good quality, i can still wear the shirt as is, and it's pretty comfortable aside from having to adjust the front because it is backwards l"
3.0,"I purchased a cardigan from this site and loved it so I decided to purchase another.  However,  the second came with a different label than the first one which is also a different label than what was advertised."
3.0,"You can't be too sure about sizing when it comes to these sites. Most of the clothes are not made to fit American women unless they are very skinny. With that said, I ordered a size or two up, and it was too big. I don't really care for it and will probably donate it."
3.0,This shirt is long and quite thin; but ok to play tennis in.
3.0,A pair of leggings.
3.0,"I bought a pair of these in brown on sale for around $140  and ended up returning them. They have several obvious manufacturing issues. The welt was cut a it short on the right boot, the lining is paper thing and will tear easily, the came with  with a cheep foam insert on top of a cardboard insole. These are not made like a $300  pair of American made boots.  These are of lower quality than a pair of $150 Chippewa boots that I own. If you were going to spend $300 on a pair of boots you would be much better off with a pair of Redwings or Wolverine 1000 miles. If you watch out for sales you can find them for around that price fairly often. For $200 you could get a nice pair of Thorogoods."
3.0,Shirts were a bit tight and pants were a big too long.
3.0,Cheap but does what it need to do.
3.0,I don’t like that it’s not very stretchy and therefore the comfort is compromised. It’s cute but I am disappointed to be honest.
3.0,"I made this purchase to deal with a rotator cuff problem and can't handle underwire. Ouch! They didn't say anything about the hard plastic side ribbing that jabs you! I removed it and the bra is otherwise perfectly comfortable and the side ribbing does not seem to be necessary to hold the girls in place. Unfortunately, you have to cut into the bra to remove it therefore shortening the life expectancy of the bra. Looks great and feels great now :)."
3.0,"I kept this one on my wish list for the longest time before finally purchasing.  For one thing, there are two different flower patterns being modeled in the product's photos, so I was curious to see which one I would actually get.  As it turns out, I got a completely different flower pattern, as you can see.  That's all well and good, but I had to wash this dress before trying it on; it absolutely REEKED of a chemical stench when it arrived.  Plus, I was quite disappointed to see that the dress color is not as white as it appears in the photos, but has a yellowish off-white tinge instead.  The inner slip is very short; it barely covers my butt.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a rather nice summer dress.  I'm 5'5&#34; and I ordered the small, and it fits me perfectly.  The slit comes up about halfway up my thigh, and the straps are more comfortable worn on the shoulders than on the arms, as it is shown in the product's photos.  3 stars."
3.0,"These ran small, for teens and women with size 7 glove or smaller. Not good if you are going to double glove and wear these over your regular gloves.  Also, mine had a weird smell which they said would wash out but I returned instead."
3.0,"Beautiful color. Love the feel. My husband wears a large, after reading the reviews about the shirt fitting small I decided to get an extra large and it still fits small.  It mostly small/tight around the armpit chest seam area. If he wanted to beat his chest like king Kong i think he would eventually rip the shirt.  However my husband said it's doable he just won't move around too much. The length is ok it falls right around his hip bone."
3.0,It’s good but for me small<br />So my son will use
3.0,"I ordered these and when they arrived my first impression was quite good, they felt nice and had a thick material, after trying too put them on they seemed very tight, so you may wanna go a size up from your normal size, regardless even though they were clearly a bit too small for me they get on and off easy. However after a few days of using the gloves they tore on me around the opening so I don't think it was from them being to tight for me. Over all good feeling material, but not very durable."
3.0,Bought this robe for my 4 year old grandson who normally wears a 5/6. Saw the reviews that it run small so ordered an 8. It is the same length as his currently robe which is a size small. There was no option to replace so I will return and order a larger size. I'm thinking maybe a 10 or12! The robe is very soft and I think he'll love it but we didn't want a mini robe!
3.0,Fit as expected. However I had to amend the slit at the front
3.0,For the price it's ok. I normally wear a 6-8 so I ordered the size XL. The top barely fit and the bottom was a little big. It's a really cute bathing suit so I kept it and took in on the bottom to make it fit better.
3.0,Fit as expected but the material is itchy and super transparent.
3.0,Just so so.
3.0,"It’s a little too long, and slightly lopsided. Other than that, it does the job."
3.0,"I bought a small and it's kinda big, I still love the loose feeling"
3.0,"I had to return, the material was unflattering."
3.0,"Looked great, but was a harder case than I wanted.  I had to return it."
3.0,Too small and short for me
3.0,i normally wear a small/medium. i ordered a large. still snug but it’s fine.
3.0,The blue tie dye is actually BLACK tie dye.  A little disappointing.
3.0,"I am 5'1&#34;, and this dress hits below my knees in the front and back, but mid-thigh on the sides. The length difference on my tiny body looks really awkward, so I will probably cut it to be a little more even and not so long. But the material is comfortable! If you are looking for a longer dress, this is a good one for you :)"
3.0,"This dress is a mystery. It smells and feels like it's made out of a combination of tent canvas and scuba suit material. The tag doesn't even know what the dress is made out of or how to take care of it. It tells you to &#34;wash separately with light colored clothing,&#34; but tells you not to get it wet or wear it in the sunshine (?!).<br /><br />In spite of all these shortcomings, it's a cute enough dress. So, if you're a risk taker and have an event coming up where you'll be in the pitch black and probably won't get wet and don't mind smelling like a brand new back-to-school backpack, this dress probably won't ruin your evening. Oh, and it seems to run a bit big. I would try to shrink it but it would probably mutate into something even more alarming."
3.0,"It works decently well, but the hat is too small for my head.  The inner lining is some kind of fleece that, although very soft, does not stretch as much as I'd hoped.  I gave it to my sister in law, who has a much smaller head than I do. 3 stars for the functionality, but lost the other two for lack of fitting options. Note: I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are 100% my own."
3.0,the arm area was all off for me... too tight on the shoulders which made the neckline look weird. I had to return it. 😩
3.0,Update: hubs washed/dryed these for me and now they're a size smaller and super tight. Not as comfortable. I'm now looking to find a different full black Jean.<br /><br />Agree with other positive reviews.  I knew my waist is a 28 so I ordered the size 8 (us 6) and fit is perfect.  I'm 5&#34;6 @135 and they are a little long but not bad. Easily can do a roll cuff look.<br />Only negative as I think others mentioned black is not a true black. There is fading on the thighs and under the butt. If they had been all black I would give 5 stars but still cute and comfortable to wear. I think the waist is a mid height. Not low where your butt will hang out (I'm a mom and don't need that). These are also not soft. More cheap feel to them. At this point I sort wish I hadn't ordered them.<br />If I had wanted ripped jeans I would have ordered that which means I would have never ordered these.
3.0,"The color is beautiful. In review said that it runs small, so I ordered L instead of M. It is way too big and long for me because I am shot 4/11. They made the top a little smaller than the bottom. I have to return."
3.0,Not a gold looking in person but it's silicone
3.0,"Bought this top in a size Small for part of a costume for my daughter. She didn’t end up wearing this top, but when she tried it on it seemed to fit okay, was a tad bit thin, but not horribly."
3.0,"Aqua was aqua,  but white was a tan color.  Also elastic got waves and needed tightening a lot."
3.0,"Nice shirt. Wide shoulder cut. Ordered a 3x, smaller in the body than expected."
3.0,somewhat small but ok
3.0,"I wear size 4 jeans and am 5' 4&#34;.  The bottoms fit very snug and I had to cut 2 1/2 inches off the hem and then re-hem them.  The jacket also fit rather snug, but overall is very cute."
3.0,"I wanted several pair of reading glasses to put here and there around my home and this set of four fit my needs.  They were very poorly packaged from the manufacture - in thin plastic sleeves thrown together into a very thin box.  Amazon thought it wise to stuff this sorry mess into an envelope to ship to me.  My local post office then shoved this ""package"" into my apartment mailbox along with magazines and other mail.  I am amazed they arrived unbroken.<br /><br />The glasses are stylish & comfortable.  The lenses are clear - not the foggy lenses that you sometimes get with lower priced glasses.  They did not come with any cases for storage but for the price, I didn't expect to receive any.<br /><br />I feel fortunate to have received these readers intact.  I am not sure many others did."
3.0,They r good
3.0,The XL is too small. There's little stretch in being able to pull it down over shoulders.
3.0,Overall not bad. It does what it's supposed to do. It is incredibly frustrating that the parts you actually put your shoes/boots on don't lock in. I have to lean the shoes against the wall to keep it upright. Not ideal since they are work shoes.
3.0,Poor contacts.  Poor battery life.  When they work they are great but only one of the three keeps working.
3.0,"I don't like this style. It's stiffer and has pointy bits on the front outer side that look awkward in a tight shirt. I bought another color from shefit and it's much better, softer and no extra fabric added to create the pointed parts"
3.0,Very cute but for feet with arch
3.0,Gorgeous and fit well. They do start to turn a slight green. I would have paid more for these easily if they were stainless steel.
3.0,"The dress is cute and actually fits nicely outside of the very small bootie pads that are not removable and make the chest look really awkward. If you are bigger than a B cup, you might want to pass."
3.0,Got these for my classroom. Don’t fit 10 year old heads wel
3.0,They are comfortable shorts. Probably not the most flattering unless you are thin.
3.0,Runs narrow...did not come with box or the extra set of grey laces...not the same quality as the older SB DUNKS
3.0,Way to big nice just got a size very  stretching<br />I added a belt so won’t look so big  ...it made look bigger than what I am
3.0,I like the shirt just needed to be a little bigger.
3.0,My kid loves these but will grow out of it quickly since it is too small. Get the next size up.
3.0,Material is on the cheap side.
3.0,The material is nice and they fit well.  I also noticed that they are a little see-through when the material is stretched out.  I will likely only wear them at home but this is still an issue for what they are designed for.<br /><br />I received these at a discount for my unbiased review.
3.0,These do not look in person like the size indicates in the pictures. They are smaller than I expected and didn't look good on me because I have a medium sized nose. They also barely fit my face. I'm kind of a small person so maybe I just got a weird pair?
3.0,"Bandanas measured true at 27x27 before washing; after first wash they were 26.25x26.25. Since the material is cotton, this is expected and is acceptable to me. The colors look good but I do not know who they will stand up to the test of time. Like other reviewers, the print is not really from a dye. Sort of feels like an iron-on print to me. The thickness of the material is acceptable (better than others that I ordered) and the stitching is good. Not dissatisfied with the order...yet. We'll see how they stand up to multiple washings."
3.0,"Liked price, style, construction of shoe, unfortunately straps were ill fitting-too tight; gave shoes to sister."
3.0,The hooks are sewn on backwards so it takes a few seconds extra to put on. Otherwise works as expected.
3.0,Little disappointed with quality  and Size
3.0,Really cute but much smaller than expected.
3.0,"I ordered these finger lights for halloween to let my kids and neighbor kids play with. I bought 5 packs and at least one light in each pack didn't work, or had a faulty on/off switch. Kind of disappointing. However, they are cheap, so I don't expect much. The kids loved them! It was sort of like a glow stick, put off a small amount of light, but enough to entertain them!"
3.0,The dress is off white.  It’s very see through. Material is like that stretchy so you can see every bump.  Good thing I had a kimono to wear over the dress so you can’t see much. Pockets were at the bottom of your hip very awkward spot.
3.0,Good material and nice pants. Just that the fit is not accurate to the pant size...
3.0,"Strap keeps coming undone and zippers don't funtion well. Would not recommend,"
3.0,"Ordered usual size, but it is too tight to wear alone buttoned up. Will have to wear another shirt under it. 😞"
3.0,Not bad for the price but it looks more substantial in the picture
3.0,The fit was a little large and the sleeves were too long so I’m having mine altered.  Also the buttons were slightly off in placement to the buttonholes so there was a little bit of bunching. I do love the style though and it was a good price.
3.0,"from China.  Took a long long time to arrive.  Stitching on the front and sleeves is not embroidery, but stamped."
3.0,Wallet is rather wide.  Wider than it needs to be imo.  Notice in pics how there is signficant space on either side of a standard credit card.  I don't get why it needs to be this wide.  Also the folding and stitching makes it bulky.  I like to carry my wallet in the front pocket and this wallet is too large for that.
3.0,one of the pads came dented in will try to fix
3.0,"The hoops were the size I wanted. Small for my ears but, did not hug my ear snug.  There was some drop down. I am not able to wear these because I can't get the back to close in such a tiny hole nor can my husband and friend. Not worth paying to send back."
3.0,"I thought this purse would be the best thing since sliced bread!  It appeared to be big enough, sturdy enough, and well put-together.  But this is a difficult purse to use.  Getting my &#34;stuff&#34; in and out of it is tedious since it is so rigid. This purse is only big at the bottom; it tapers at the top, making it hard to get things out.  I do love the handle!!  I do love the look.  But I wish it didn't feel so much like a hard suitcase.  I have decided to keep it but I can't use it everyday because it just won't fit all of my necessities comfortably."
3.0,"Great fit, but the seams popped on the sleeves almost immediately."
3.0,"Exactly as advertisized, good price, bad for wearing out at night"
3.0,"Love this! My boyfriend's going to LOVE it too! It's stretchy material so it fits my form perfectly. I'm 5' 6 1/2&#34; tall & weigh 175. I ordered the XXL = US XL...I reviewed this item BEFORE I had the stockings to pair with it.  I have to change my opinion now as I went to try it on WITH non-silicone nylon stockings, but the garter belts were WAY too long and this did not work for me.  I am returning unfortunately but it is a very pretty lingerie."
3.0,"I was SO EXCITED to try this guy out.<br />Everything was great, until I went for a jog. The dang thing came unzipped! The padded shoulders are nice, it’s comfy for  sleep or bumming around the house, but speed walking is a gamble and jogging is risky!  Felt a snitch on the looser side per size chart. I’ll keep them because I’m too lazy to return them, but not my first choice."
3.0,"Looks good at first, but otherwise scratches easily over time."
3.0,"These are very short. I am 5'10. These would probably be good for some one around 5'6"". They are also not as baggy as shown in the picture"
3.0,More of an orange color than pink.  But it is pretty.
3.0,Looks beautiful and unique but doesn't fit my wrest. I'm a bit skinny girl. It broke on me because I tried to tighten it around my wrest to no good :(<br />It's a shame because I kinda liked it
3.0,"Mine came with a small scratch on the side but otherwise I’ll keep it, still like the design"
3.0,I am 5ft 8 and it’s too small and short
3.0,"Muy grande, hay que pedir dos tallas menos, su calidad regular, vino con huequitos pequeñitos lo que da apariencia de viejo"
3.0,Bought these for my daughter who wears a 10.  I wear a 9 and they were slightly narrow and I could probably wear them.  Doubt if they will fit her.  Too bad because they are a good shoe if you are in the business world.
3.0,not as elegant and high quality as it appears but nice
3.0,"A lot smaller than expected. But for the price, I really can't complain."
3.0,"I really liked them, but unfortunately too large.  I ordered 6.5 and probably 5.5 would have worked, but not in stock."
3.0,Color is very faded. I’ll be returning it
3.0,"Good fit, comfy for lounging around the house or for wearing to and from yoga class, but not for wearing all day long. Not as much cushion as I hoped for."
3.0,"I am 5’11”; 160 lbs, 36C with a largish frame and I wear a M shirt. I ordered the XL jacket but it was too tight in the shoulders and underarms and the sleeves were shorter than I liked (rested above the wrist bone with arms down and pulled up a lot when arms raised out front). The jacket was flatteringly snug and tailored looking when zipped but prob not enough room to wear a sweater under it. The material was soft and had a faint texture but overall it looked and felt shiny and slick.<br /><br />I ultimately went with a similar jacket from another seller because the shoulder and sleeve measurements were better suited to my frame and the material looked more authentic to me."
3.0,"They look okay, but the visibility isn't great.  Comfortable enough, but wish I'd tried them on somewhere, as they feel a little small on my face."
3.0,Ugly Christmas sweater! My husband loved it! I thought it was over the top!
3.0,The clip bead did not fit tight enough to hold the other beads in place😩
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress for a very good price.  However, I had to return it as the arm openings are too huge and the fabric stick out open — ideal fit in this dress would be a totally flat chest.  I am a 5’3”, 110 lbs, 32C — I wear Nike Golf in XS."
3.0,"I wanted to love it but the way the gathering pulls down the dress down, makes it very form fitting. But hey, if you have a flat stomach this would look amazing! I would have rather it been a comfort dress but I’m gonna try it with shape wear and see where that gets me 😉"
3.0,It's actually a very nice band but you will have to bend the spring pin things to get it to fit the Casio MDV-106
3.0,"I liked the style of the dress, but I did not have the bust to pull it off. Tightening the strings didn't help either. This dress is not meant for petite women."
3.0,"Product definitely runs small. I’m 5’0 130lbs, big bust, usually wear s/m had to return and get an XL to get it to fit. The belt with the stones is cheap and falling off which I just glued back on but besides that 10/10 pretty good quality 👍🏼"
3.0,hard to tighten
3.0,description said runs true to size.  It was huge and fabric was very heavy
3.0,Good for the price - does appear a little cheap... but it is so...
3.0,not the slimming effect I was looking for...legs cut in and not enough control in abdomen
3.0,"It's a cheap dress, so you shouldn't be shocked that the quality isn't great.  But, for my needs (a costume), it was fine.  Color is accurate.  Hem was a little uneven.  Pockets.  Soft, stretchy, and a bit see-through."
3.0,Much nicer than the picture displays it has not faded but has not gone through daily usage either came in  timely manner
3.0,"Cute leotard, but it came with a big hole on the side seam! They had none left so I had it repaired.  Disappointing quality."
3.0,Run small but were found to be amusing.
3.0,Not a fan of this sweatshirt. Arms are very long but the shirt is well made.
3.0,Runs really small. Size chart way off. Gave them away.
3.0,Had it for years now and love it but some problems. The straps really dig in if you only wear a tank-top. Very painful rope burn but if you don’t mind it then it’s an amazing bag.
3.0,"The buckles are plastic. I couldn't tell from the pictures. The material is very uncomfortable and scratchy. Seems that it is made well enough, but I am not wearing it. I prefer the Apple Dive Band for fit and comfort over this."
3.0,These were decently made cheap shoes.  Unfortunately they didn't fit as described.
3.0,Broke after a month wear
3.0,"Well 1st of all they work. I wore this on the beach in Mexico and didn't burn through it. But I was very surprised that the neck line and down an inch or 2 turned yellow, I am assuming it was because of the sunscreen I put on my unprotected neck front and back. It didn't wash out either. So I now have a stained shirt to wear. Not attractive."
3.0,"Like the other customer review, I didn't expect them to be so small. They're pretty but I was trying to match them up to a necklace I have and the earring are much smaller than the necklace."
3.0,somewaht small but i will keep it because the quality its good. I'll just give it to someone.
3.0,Didn’t love this one. Sizing is TTS but the style was not flattering on me.
3.0,"Too big for girls, but still nice"
3.0,"It does fit better and lacks the gapping issues of other self-adhesive bras with foam cups. It does support, and it does improve cleavage. Shaping, however, is not as good as a regular bra. It will do, though."
3.0,Cute shirt but very thin material. I always have get compliments when I wear this shirt dress.
3.0,The grandkids loved them and the price was great.  Only problem was they only came in medium.  Luckily there are no backs to the slippers so the larger feet hung over the backs.  The kids did have a ball with them.
3.0,strings a little long and its thin its ok not best bag I have gotten ok for some shoes and a water bottle nothing more
3.0,"I have a few issues with this shirt which may not be issues for other buyers.<br /><br />If you want this shirt to stop at your hip, and you are over 5’4”, it will not do this in front. Your stomach will be exposed unless you pair it with high-waisted pants. It is longer in back, but it will not cover your bottom.<br /><br />The cut-outs are nice, but are only fray-checked with a glue, so this shirt is unlikely to survive multiple washings...the fabric is very thin, so great for hot weather, but also slightly see-through.<br /><br />All in all, decent for the price and very cute, just cut for a much shorter body than mine (5’8” for reference)."
3.0,"This item arrived on time, but when it did it had what looks like a welding mistake on one of the flowers, it was very jagged and looked like raw solder had been dropped on it. I was able to file it down and paint over it with a fingernail polish, but that spot does still catch on things occasionally. But for the price it wasn't worth it to return it. Once I fixed it though you can't really see the mistake unless you know it's there. Other than that I'm very happy with it."
3.0,"Suit came in a different color than the picture. The suit itself was long in the torso with super short arms. I would have returned it but my kid actually likes it. It’s fine for the backyard pool, but I don’t recommend it for out of the house because of the awkward fit."
3.0,"unlike the picture where it slopes off her shoulder mine just stayed put. It's good to wear yet, but it was also not as long as the picture."
3.0,"I'm...not sure what to make of this. I love the top, but the shoulder pieces are WAY too long for any normal sized human (the arm holes are way too large). There's like, 4 inches of excess material on the straps. I have a long torso, I can't imagine how bad this would fit on a &#34;normally proportioned&#34; body.<br /><br />Sizing is fine, fabric is nice, seams seem well-reinforced...but those straps just ruin the whole thing. I'll probably end up getting it altered or hitting it with my surger or something."
3.0,slides out of ear
3.0,It was cute in person and the color was great. But I didn’t care for the material. It stuck to my skin and showed all imperfections.
3.0,I was disappointed that the writing and insignia was not embroidered.  Disappointed that it was a stamped item. It did not say otherwise.  Other sites tells something about the lettering and insignia.<br />I did like the design. Bought four for my army buddies I served with.  May have thought twice if I had known more.
3.0,Loose fitting shell could be a little tighter. The one real complaint is the quality is mediocre. I will wear under a jacket but not as a summer top. Construction is flawed.
3.0,It fits true to size and it is a good product minus the pads that are included in there! Those pads are ridiculously too small for the cup!!!<br />Hopefully they fix this flaw!
3.0,I ordered two of these vests. I ordered two sizes bigger as per other reviewers. One of them fits well and one of them is too large. If they both fit the same I would give 5 stars. The quality seems okay.
3.0,Broke when attempting to put on
3.0,Hole would not fit my chain
3.0,Item is extremely big. I ordered my size and a smaller size and it was 3x the size. I couldn’t wear the dress and had to return. I like the design and I’d advise to order a few sizes smaller than your regular size.
3.0,"The unicorn onesie is absolutely soft and durable, especially when an adult woman tried it on. They should have the child holding a pot leaf over the unicorn eyes because it looks high AF."
3.0,"I bought a blue, colour as dspicted. Material is good quality and heavy, feels comfortable. I bought a medium but it runs big in my opinion so purchase a size down if u want the same fit as depicted in picture. I will have to do some alterations for a better fit."
3.0,"I thought the flowers were going to be made of real shells. They're plastic and they're really big, too big."
3.0,Bought these too replace the ones that they hand out at the hospital but they were hard to keep on and kept turning so the rubber part wasn't under my foot.
3.0,Pockets not big enough to hold metal water bottles. Straps to carry it would be nice.
3.0,"I love the way it looked for the first couple weeks, then the bling started to come off of the rubber. I don’t do anything aggressive with my watch bands, so for it to come off just doesn’t make sense. Other than that it does hold up as just a rubber band."
3.0,"Columbia is a good brand, I just didn't like how this pair fit me. It was too tight in the butt & too baggy in the front. Felt like I put it on backwards or something."
3.0,Sheds a good bit
3.0,"I wore them for a day . Plan to use for traveling and warmth. Have not used yet just wore with lined boots around the house . Seem to be good , not to warm  and did not notice  the snug fit . In  taking  off could of used help they don't give at all  They are like support hose but better looking . I have very poor circulation, feet are cold legs are very warm . The true test will my next flight will be soon. I followed instruction for putting on  no problem butt taking off was very difficult ."
3.0,Berger than expected
3.0,"Crouch area was really deep, legs were short."
3.0,They are very tiny.  Thought they would be bigger
3.0,"For the price it is ok, just not what I thought it would be.  It is not hinged, which is my main complaint and it is rather light weight"
3.0,This is a great item. The only downside is that silicon started peeling close to face of the watch
3.0,"These are fine. Mine didn't fall apart like other reviewers, but they certainly feel cheap, and the gold is super cheap looking. You get what you pay for though, and I've had the gold one in for about a month with zero issues (and I am normally allergic to everything)."
3.0,"It looks longer online but its definitely cropped. When I wear high waisted jeans it hits at the top of my Jean's but its only like that in the front. I'm 5'3, 220lbs. Wish it came in different sizes so it could be baggy. The color is exactly how it shows online"
3.0,"Smells, really bad, cheaply made. Stitching is already coming out. I have a Samsung note 9 and I had to cut a new hole in the strap to make the phone fit. Would not have paid more than $6 for this bag."
3.0,"The cut of these is a straight cut and if you have a curvy body they don’t fit as well. Also, they are advertised as opaque but as they stretch they are more see-through. Not bad for wearing under long tops or around the house or to work out."
3.0,Thin material/ runs big
3.0,This shirt is way too short and apparently not eligible for return
3.0,"This sweatshirt is ok. I bought it to dye as part of a Vanellope Von Schweetz costume. I had to replace the drawstring. While doing so, one of the grommets fell off. I didn't apply any more force than I would have from normal use. Other than that, this is a nice comfortable sweatshirt."
3.0,order size up
3.0,"I got these and my first impression was that the rope should be longer. Then while reading through the ad again, it mentions that the fit should be a bit on the tight side - a little difficult to put on. So I give it 3 stars, which says it's okay. It does what it says it will do. Doesn't really stand out for any reason. I might buy them again, but I'll look for a longer rope."
3.0,the fabric is very thin and it doesn't drape as nicely as the photo shows.
3.0,Item was very cheaply made. It has a zipper in the back so unable to be used at water parks. The zipper had a metal piece sticking off like a broken part that hurt but I bent it to be ok. It was new and shipped really quickly and looks nice
3.0,The bells are very tiny. The sound quite low. Could be twice bigger than they are and much louder to help find a pet in the bushes...
3.0,"Used it once.... I love the clasp, it's pretty. I don't know if it looks real or not. I'll try it again. But I'm not ""in love"".<br />update: looked at it again... decided to return it in favor of another... it pinches my skin which is uncomfortable"
3.0,Not as good as quality and sizes run small !!!
3.0,"This is an odd one. On the one hand, I like the style of this dress and I love the material. On the other hand, the dress hikes up, quite badly at times, such that it must be worn with leggings. It is slightly smaller than advertised, but still fits her well enough, and, for whatever reason, just won't stay put. It doesn't look quite right, as compared to similar dresses, and I believe the issue is one of design, in the faux wrap skirt. It just doesn't want to hang properly. Overall, I can't give this more than three stars, as it is such a hassle. She has had to add fabric and can't wear it the way it is intended to be worn. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
3.0,"they’re cute and funny. when they arrived, they were broken. the earring stud disconnected from the egg piece. easy to fix with super glue, but still."
3.0,Underwear itself is fine.  Wish country of manufacture was in small print somewhere on a tag  rather than huge letters inside and around all of it.
3.0,Pesan un Poco. Pero son Linda's.
3.0,"The print is great, but it's elastic. It makes it hard to get out of my purse."
3.0,"It keeps my sunglasses on, but the wire is very stiff.  If you loop it up to put it in a case with sunglasses, it retains the curled shape.  I'd prefer something softer."
3.0,"I was not impressed with the quality of the setting.  The gem was not sitting level in the setting. It did not sit nicely in the ear.  I guess my expectations  were too high.  The gem itself was a pretty color blue, and the shipping was timely."
3.0,"Felt like very cheap, perhaps fake. Sorry, cannot be compared with original Nike quality."
3.0,They were a bit larger than anticipated but very durable
3.0,"This is cute, but if you have large breast there is not a lot of support. There is none on the side.."
3.0,"very poorly made , stones have already fallen out ..would never buy it again"
3.0,"Fit? - five stars!!! I love the lace, low-rise waistband. It sits very nicely right across my true waist, and does not roll or pinch. It makes for a beautifully seamless fit.<br /><br />I rated the stockings three stars, however, because 1- the color is quite dark (I'm an olive-skinned Hispanic, and this was still just a bit too dark for me), and 2- the tear very easily!! I bought 2 pairs (thank goodness), and one of them tore at the toes after just the first time I wore them; it continued up and I had to toss it."
3.0,Cute shirt but runs way too small. There is a stretch to it but you can't stretch it out. I'm 5'4 150 and the XL is too small.
3.0,Cute shirt but too small
3.0,Is this really a genuine Pandora charm ? Its different than other genuine Pandora charms I have purchased recently.
3.0,"Ok, but not overly satisfied."
3.0,"Looks cheap close up. Will keep for fall time outings or last minute meetings. Very wrinkle prone. Loved the styling and idea but it's basically an open shirt thing. Not a blazer, not even close."
3.0,Love it! They fit in so easy and weightless. Can't even see them
3.0,Didn't last long. I guess you get what you pay for
3.0,Liked all of them
3.0,"UPDATE... after contacting the seller,  they sent out a new pair which was a size bigger. However, communication regarding the replacements was confusing.  My granddaughter loves them and that's all that matters. Thank you VonMay for making it right. Order 1 size larger minimum.<br /><br />Original post....The shoes are cute, but run 1 to 2 sizes too SMALL. If they were large at least they could grow into them. You also have to pay postage to return them with a potential of  a 50% restocking Fee."
3.0,"hat arrived with a flat khaki color, not the &#34;pigment-dyed&#34; or washed look I wanted. It fits my two year old comfortably with some room (he has a head full of curly hair).  Lightweight and looks well made. Just wish the color shown was what I actually received, probably wouldn't have ordered it."
3.0,Very cute style but please be warned this runs very small. I'm 5'3 and wear a medium typically. The large fits like a small! I would go up two sizes!  The top also fits less off the shoulder and more like a bandeau with shoulder straps.
3.0,"Perfect luggage, nice color, but I need bigger one."
3.0,"Pants were somewhat small. I did go a size up. I wear a 2x and I bought a 3x. This material is the same fabric at rainbows. rainbows fit just right, but these were too snug as a 3x. A 4x would have fit better and these are not true to size. I will not buy again."
3.0,I got this as a gift for my mom who has an average size wrist and wears a size 8 ring size. I only mention this because the band for the bracelet is extremely tight on her and barely fits. It’s too bad because the quality is great and it’s a cute bracelet overall just too small imo. Unless you’re gifting this to someone who’s really petite I wouldn’t recommend
3.0,I like it but its way to small
3.0,"Loved this band when I first got it and it fit perfectly. But over time it got stretched out from repeatedly taking it on/off. This is something I didn’t think about when buying it, that it would naturally stretch over time. Just something to consider!"
3.0,"Cute dress.  Unfortunately it was a little too big.  I usually wear a medium in everything so I got this in a medium and it fit like a sack.  Also, I loved the length in the front and back (came about mid calf) but the slits on the side were just under mid thigh and too short for my liking.  I returned it."
3.0,"I ordered this as a size up for the other color that didn’t fit me in a L but they didn’t have an XL in that color. Not sure why, but this felt even smaller than the L? Had to return."
3.0,Runs very small. I'm a size 1 and had to buy a 5x which still does not quite fit totally around. Also material feels scratchy. But I still love the way it looks!
3.0,Not Cotten at all more of a dry fit material I’m so disappointed and will probably return.
3.0,The glue holding the bow came loose sometime during the shipping process...pretty hat and can be fixed with a hot glue gun...
3.0,Got him a size upand it is too big!  We are hoping he will be able to wear them next year.
3.0,started to loose the silver color after a while.
3.0,ripped after wearing one time.  lights worked good.
3.0,These were okay.  My earlobes are a bit thicker so these didn't stay together very well.
3.0,"It's a nice alternative to the more expensive Swarovski version of this pin. The white cloudy stones do take away from the overall appearance, but it's nice for the price."
3.0,too tight and snug
3.0,"Very thin, almost transparent. Quality is not as good as what you find in your local motorcycle shop but it should work fine for summer riding."
3.0,"The outside of the bag, says small and the shirt says large. I ordered a medium.<br /><br />It definitely fits like a small, so size up one or two especially if you are big breasted. I wear a 34DD and it wouldn’t even reach the buttons."
3.0,I loved the decorations but I did NOT receive the unicorn eyelashes for the cake decoration. Can you send me a pair or eyelashes
3.0,Not the same as the picture shows.  Only comes to the bottom of my knees
3.0,Love the design and quite comfortable. Not made for real winters. Needs some real insulation. Anybody who says this is warm and cozy is inside watching it snow on TV.
3.0,"The design is nice, but the material is very thin. It will work if you're in a pinch and need something quick, but be prepared to wear shapewear underneath. It fits just like it is shown on the models."
3.0,I was it came in a soft case other than that it will do the job.
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, super flowy! But.... I wore it ONCE and the strap broke!!! I am so mad! Not worth it. So three stars, because it's pretty."
3.0,"I'm 5 ft tall and curvy.  This skirt is super cute but it doesn't accommodate well for women with short torsos.  The horizontal straps are suppose to fit around the belly, but on a short person, they go right up to the chest.  The skirt portion of it zips up ok, but I would prefer for the top of the zipper to have a clasp, so that its easier to zipper on a big booty like mine.  I'll be altering this to fit better."
3.0,"It's ok, but I wish it was wider."
3.0,Gift for a friend but wasn’t blown away by the looks
3.0,These are great at first but shrink like crazy. It was ok and work if you have a tween in the house.
3.0,The sleeves were a mile to long and is very short waisted
3.0,"I like the fit, style and how the dress hangs and color. I was looking for a longer dress due to my height. But I was very dissatisfied by the quality. There are places on the dress where stitches are skipped which are noticeable with loose threads. Definitely quality control on the thread/ bobbin tension or thread not compatible to needle. Due to light interfacing at neck line the interfacing pops up. You need the fabric interfacing stitched down. I realize that these are my issues on specific dress. But I would wonder if people are checking their inventory before they send it to customer."
3.0,It was ok. The picture was much cuter.
3.0,"These were about what I expected, but the gold pair was broken."
3.0,Nice fabric and design but too small. I bought a Large because XL seems to be too big in all of these on me. This seemed like a medium. Legs were long but I expected that since I am only 5'3.
3.0,"Looks pretty similar to the picture but with a cheaper look to it. Package spent an hour in the mailbox on a hot day and the dress had a HORRIBLE smell when I opened it. Had to wash it twice to get rid of the smell. I'm unsure if it was the packing material, the dye used on the dress or a combination of both that gave it the smell."
3.0,"Not my favorite bra. I prefer padding (which this doesn't have), and it really wasn't the most comfortable even though the support was decent"
3.0,The frame is a little too square for my face and the glasses themselves are not very comfortable. Some glasses you can put on and forget that they're even there. These ones are a little too bulky and square for me. I love the case that they came with though.
3.0,"It fit my Versa well, but I have a very small wrist and it was not comfortable for me. I had the clasp in the last hole on the band. The band holders both move so they kept sliding throughout the day."
3.0,Not what I was looking for. I returned it.
3.0,Perfect fit other than the boob area
3.0,"The pants fit as expected, the shirt was larger than required. But they look great when worn"
3.0,"Fits small and is a bit unforgiving- the cotton shows all lines and ripples from layered leggings or tanks underneath. The V at the bust does not provide enough coverage and I would strongly recommend a tank underneath. I bought this for easy breastfeeding access and it works OK with a nursing tank underneath but I’m not super comfortable in it. I’m 5’5, 130lbs with a little bit of baby weight left on my belly and chest and this dress in medium is just too clingy. I’d recommend going up a size or two."
3.0,This skirt was smaller than I expected.  I had to return it
3.0,Runs very small.  Quality was good for price.  I sent it back a no hassle return.
3.0,I have big calves but it was still a little loose from the bottom. I weight 125 but i think i should have bought the small instead. But other than that i did like the color
3.0,"Fits as expected. However durability is questionable. Wore these to the beach one time and noticed very fine small peeling of material in lenses, which let's sunlight, UV thru those spots. Not sure if blowing sand caused, or from salt water spray in beach area."
3.0,This is WAY big to be comfortable. I called it umbrella ring. Only for style..not comfortable. Yet it looks absolutely pretty. It's same as the picture.
3.0,"Nice tops for yoga, but somewhat loose fitting- I would’ve preferred a more fitted yoga top, when doing yoga inversions the top doesn’t fit snug to stay in place, but I kept them all the same."
3.0,"5’10<br />Size 10-12<br />Ordered an XL - too tight<br />Also, for my height, the slit up the side is too high. Would not be able to wear this to work like I had intended.<br /><br />It’s is a fairly nice dress otherwise."
3.0,Fit as expected however the seams or stitching of the fabrics are very scratchy and rub the chest of my daughter during gymnastics classes.
3.0,Chain was linked when it arrived.
3.0,"This looked like a fun shirt.<br /><br />The material was colorful and had no runs. Color was even throughout.<br /><br />That said, the sizing is way off. I wear extra-large t-shirts and I could barely close the extra-large shirt and was ready to call for the Jaws of Life to extricate me. I guess I could also go on a much-needed diet.... I would guess you need a shirt three sizes larger than what you normally wear. This type of shirt needs to drape loose on a person.<br /><br />The material was really thin. The tag had no washing/care directions.<br /><br />Honestly, given the size problem, I can't correctly evaluate it for comfort or anything."
3.0,I thought these were technology friendly gloves. They are beautiful but I was looking for gloves my girls could use their phones with.
3.0,Good for one it's two wears
3.0,The fabric is waaay too thick for a piece like this. But it’s nice and stretchy so it’s comfortable to wear.
3.0,This isn’t cotton and it’s pretty see through
3.0,Personally I don’t like how it looked on me. I got a medium and the lines on the back did not look right and it was loose on the top half.
3.0,"Nice sheen, stretch. Would best fit a size 4 (US). The elastic band is narrow, so it is not forgiving as far as &#34;muffin top&#34;--a larger band would make for a great improvement. I like them, but because of the smallness of size and elastic band, I will not be purchasing this type of product again from this maker."
3.0,"The bag is well made and it seems to be high quality leather. It looks good and I've received several compliments on it. However, the paint comes out and stains my clothes and skin. I've tried cleaning it but the paint keeps coming off. Luckily it's easy to wash off from my clothes. I think I have to clean it more thoroughly as the stains have reduced over time. Other than than I think it's a good versatile bag."
3.0,They were gifts no feedback
3.0,[[VIDEOID:414f26db1ca6d8d56ea41e3cd8665b66]] They don’t look like the image (false advertising).<br />I was hoping to get a more realistic look for this set.
3.0,Gift for sister. This one arrived quicker than the other I ordered at the same time. She liked the scarf.
3.0,"I am 5 ft 4 and my measurements are 34 27 37. I bought a Medium.<br />The material is thick and quite nice in my opinion.<br />The medium measurements for this dress somewhat matched my own so it's what I got, but It just seems a bit too big on me. I wish I got a small. I will be returning it if none of my friends want it."
3.0,The material and fit were not as expected
3.0,Cheap material but it's great for the price!
3.0,The clasp on this necklace is hard to open so I don't wear it because of that. .
3.0,beautiful but a little big for my 2 year old.
3.0,"When I first received these pants I didn't have anything bad to say about them, the fit really well, they were comfortable. It wasn't until the last time that I wore them that I noticed a hole, it is right in the crotch area. Now I have only had these for two months, so I have wore them probably less than 10 times. I am going to try to fix them, but I don't know that I would want to wear them out of the house with a patch job in such an area."
3.0,I got these for Comic Con. They are cute but smaller than I thought they would be. They are plastic and the &#34;painting&#34; on them was a bit sloppy. I felt like they either need to be a little cheaper or painted better. I ended up giving them to my 14 year old niece who likes them.
3.0,"The waist ties took a minute to figure out. There’s a small opening in the waist seam on the left side. Lace the right string through to tie. It’s cute but will need a slip or leggings to be modest. Super light weight, synthetic material."
3.0,Great quartz! love it.<br />The only issue is that the wire used to hold/wrap the crystal is already changing colors after I wore it only a couple of days. Is this expected?<br />Thank you
3.0,"The fabric was soft and the colors were pretty, it was pretty good, as I expected. But the hemline was a little weird, so I sent it back."
3.0,These fit really small. Snowboard pants are usually loose and comfortable. I normally wear a medium in pants and I ordered a large and they are pretty snug. I love the look and quality is good but disappointed.
3.0,Good looking pair of jeans. Seem durable.  A bit to slim and short in the crotch area.
3.0,October is long sleeve season.  I was expecting a long sleeve shirt to be a little thicker and warmer.  I can only describe this as being a bit flimsy.  Shame.  The design was nice.
3.0,The shorts feels good on you but the padding isn't that great for long rides. I use them under my other shorts and they work great
3.0,"Very cool shirt... the sleeves were tight, but the shirt was wearable."
3.0,"I thought it was canvas and it's some type of plastic. Disappointed. Overall it's nice, but wanted canvas."
3.0,A little disappointed... The second time putting the sunglasses on  the right lens popped out.of the nose piece.. Good price though..
3.0,"These masks are made well and are nice looking. Normally, I wash something once before wearing it. However, the fabric on these is so rough they needed to be washed 3 times for me to be able to wear them.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
3.0,A little chunkier than expected. A little Iopsided on top so I have to adjust a lot but stitching is nice and colors are great. Looks pretty cute.
3.0,"Made my husbands neck change color. Not real sterling silver,. low quality."
3.0,Order 2-3 sizes bigger.. depends on how u like things to fit
3.0,It looks really nice but it does not stay clipped
3.0,"This is cute, got the size XL but it still fits a little tight, wrinkles pretty easily also"
3.0,"Love these, but most of the box was a SUUUUUUUPER large size that seems really unlikely to even fit on a large man's thumb - since I'm a petite female - most of the box is a complete waste for me. There were also 3 rings that were already broken at the time of delivery (sizes that would have actually fit too!). Hematite is delicate, so I don't expect them to last forever, but it would have been nice to have the opportunity to wear and break them myself."
3.0,item seemed bigger than normal size.
3.0,The purse folds rather than being substantial and is awkward
3.0,My son likes it little to big but ok
3.0,"The top is very small, if you haev a chest its probably not going to fit into it. The staps are a little hard to tie as well. Its a very cute suit though!"
3.0,Won’t order this again
3.0,"These glasses are super comfortable and feel sturdy! However, a major draw back is that they really are Super dark glasses thats for sure! You can hardly see out of them, even on a really bright day. Do not drive with these glasses on."
3.0,"I really like wearing tops that have thumb holes.  As a tall woman, it is often difficult to find tops that have long enough sleeves or that are just long enough in general.  I ordered this shirt in size large based off of the sizing chart.  Also, large is my usual size.  I think it fits me well around the chest & midsection.  The sleeves could be a bit longer.  If I don't put my thumbs through the holes, the length is good but the sleeves feel stretched when I put my thumbs through.  I'd also prefer a shirt that's a little longer in the body.  Overall, the quality seems good & I really like the color.  The material is light & perfect for physical activities.  I think this would fit a more average height person perfectly."
3.0,It was longer than I expected but I am 5&#34;1' but very soft
3.0,"The stone looks plastic.  Beautiful design,  but wish it was a more realistic looking stone."
3.0,"I have been wearing a size 7 in shoes for almost 10 years, so i went with my gut and ordered a 7 in these. They fit well, and they're not so much of a heel to toe height difference that they're hard to walk in, but they are STIFF. The tops rub against my ankle bone and caused it to tear my tights.<br />But i get a ton of compliments when I wear them, lol.<br />But i would stick to just using these as costume shoes, not normal shoes."
3.0,"They are comfy great for wide feet, but you can tell they are made cheaply. You get what you pay for let’s just see how long they last. It doesn’t hurt to try!"
3.0,She's like it was manufactured in a fish market. Otherwise beautiful but had to hang outside and spray liberally with fabreeze to get rid of the smell.
3.0,Nice quality but I am unable to wear them. Too heavy
3.0,"Super cute but they are kinda big, and they are heavy enough that they don’t stay right side out"
3.0,"Bought a 2 pair set in Small for my 2 year old’s first ballet class. Size seems right, still lots of room to grow into. However, after only a couple of use, multiple holes started to show and had to toss them. It’s a toddler who’s using them but wish they were a little more long lasting."
3.0,This shirt is perfect for my son. It does run big so size down. My son is 8 and size 10/12 Large but I bought a medium. I don’t like the material and will be returning it. It’s a costume type stretchy material. Not a t-shirt material like Hanes t-shirts.
3.0,I returded is too big...colors are beautiful..
3.0,"Mi talla es 6,5 y me quedo grande"
3.0,"This Men's genuine fullgrain milled leather jeans belt is awesome looking and seems to be a very well made item. Unfortunately, it is too small. It seems that a random sample of belts were sent out. I wish I could have worn it! But, like I said a really nice looking belt and design."
3.0,"It was ok, it looks a little faded compared to the picture."
3.0,Daughter couldn’t wear it because it was too tight. She has normal sized head so only buy if you have a small head.
3.0,Good quality.  They were a little small for my son.  He normally wears a 32 waist.
3.0,Chain and bracelet are bigger than what I expected.  Not good if you have a small wrist.
3.0,Not Maroon but red. Very heavy but looks well made. Nicely wrapped.
3.0,"Lightweight but NOT scent free. Still has vanilla smell like other Italian rubber watch straps. Slightly grey in color, not jet black. Thin and comfortable, much better than my Seiko band. Very similar to other Italian rubber NATO bands but almost double the price. Testing this out given other good reviews. Paying for the name?"
3.0,"It's pretty but I didn't realize that the embroidery would show through shirts. I don't like have a bumpy chest. It was also 2 layers, embroidery and lining. They aren't sew together in a lot of areas, like cup, so they pull apart and bunch up. I am a B+ on one side and the C was way too big and bunched up. The bottom part doesn't work of your short 5'1&#34;, and fat 220. Not like on the perfect model."
3.0,would be perfect if it didnt run so small
3.0,Not as warm as i thought .
3.0,"Tassel came off in first wear but still really cute little shoes .  My daughter had several colors .  The shoes do scuff, but for a few dollars I’m ok with it."
3.0,Ran small.  Very thin fabric and super stretchy but unflattering
3.0,"I normally wear size 1x/2x, but followed the comments to order a size up. Ordered 3x, just tried it on, but not a loose as I expected by ordering so large a size. Great fabric, though, and color is accurate. Will update after first washing."
3.0,"Cool socks for price, but a few pairs were a much smaller size."
3.0,"I looove the way these sun readers look, with the real wood and all the accessories that come with, but for me I wish the reading lens extended a bit higher in the frame. Find myself tilting my chin upward to read thru."
3.0,They are nice but fall out of my wife's nose when shes sleeping all the time. I guess she shouldn't wear them to bed.
3.0,"Woman here. I typically buy UA men's visors because the women's ones are pink or some other garbage. Unfortunately if you have a smaller head this visor can't really be smaller than the standard velcro setting (i.e. both sides line up EXACTLY) because the loop-side of the velcro is on the outside. So, if you are trying to shorten up the circumference you'll have several inches of a velcro tail sticking off your head. On the old one I have the velcro has the hook side on the outside so the tail just sticks to the outside of the hat."
3.0,Great fit. Good material.
3.0,I love the concept of grounding while I work. I haven't adhered them to my shoe yet because you really need a flatter surface on the bottom of your shoe. My shoes are more course and there isn't enough of a surface to attach the Erthe Athletic to. I will keep that into consideration when I buy my next work shoe so I can try these out! Also I don't think these will work in a work boot because it's not long enough.
3.0,"I used these for Halloween... I did however have to add feathers so you couldn't see the backing and plate they are glued to. Other than that, I'm a big girl and they were very comfy around my arms"
3.0,"I had a pair of glasses like these afew years ago.  I don't recall the brand; I think I got them from a rock climbing company (inverted belaying glasses).  I liked them and found them useful after surgery.  A friend recently underwent spine surgery and so I bought this 2-pack (it was $2 more for two pairs, than just one).  I intended to gift 1 set of glasses and keep the other; frankly, after hours on the computer, it's nice to lay on my back savasana-style and still read.<br /><br />I wish I could remember what brand I had years ago.  These glasses are much heavier than the ones I remember, so they might not be great for people with sensory issues exacerbated during migraine.  The viewing window on these is also small.  The image isn't distorted, but it's a bit like looking through the viewfinder on a film camera.  They are fine, but not great."
3.0,"not a big as pictured. not for use for school books. a day hike, carry on or one night over stay it will be perfect."
3.0,"A xl is my size, I like it a little baggy. This product was tight in the body and the sleeves were short. Otherwise quality was good. I returned them due to fit"
3.0,"It is a cute and funny scarf, but cheaply made. Although it was only $3 so I cannot really complain."
3.0,Sized a bit large.
3.0,The tank runs on the small size and isn’t nearly as “flowy” as it appears in the picture. The material is very stiff and not at all soft.
3.0,Smaller than thought.
3.0,Wish it were smaller
3.0,Don't call it a men's watch as it is too small and the band is not for us guy's with a man size wrist...  Get what you pay for I guess :-)
3.0,i ordered a size larger as recomemded and the shoe was still too small
3.0,Band broke after my son had it for about a month
3.0,"Cute, the bottoms fit real well they are flowy but the top is tight"
3.0,It is not as sturdy as I had hoped.  It works for really small chains or light weight bracelets.
3.0,"Bought this for my boy who wore 12mths a little big. I bought the 18mths thinking he'd get longer wear. No luck, at 14 months we cant pull it over his head anymore and hes not a big kid. Hes in the 35th% so with that, great productGO BIGGER"
3.0,"Bought 2 pair of these shoes and my daughter loved them.  Bought a 3rd pair when my daughter out grew the other ones and the sole fell off just over a month.  Bought on July 1 and the sole fell off August 4, 3 days shy of the return window.  Very disappointed in the 3rd pair."
3.0,not solid material however nice enough for a kid
3.0,"I bought this for my mom. Because it was prettier than the silicone watch bands. However she kept getting stuck onto things (fridge, washing machine, store cart, etc.) SO ANNOYING."
3.0,Good quality but too large in leg area and waist. Couldn't wear gave away!
3.0,Too short for waist
3.0,They are a different shape than I am used to. They work great just feel weird to me.
3.0,"I'm only 5'2 and about 115 with a small ribcage, this was really boxy. The picture looks like its slimmer fitting and I got a small but still too big. It's cute tho! If you're a thicker girl this is for you:)"
3.0,Shirt was nice however the texture was very starchy and and the material was stiff. It was prewashed/shrunk(still washed it anyway) but when i took it out of the package it was terrible feeling material. Definitely not the softest shirt Iever felt(even after being washed). Good but not worth $30+
3.0,"There is inconsistencies in sizes from this maker/seller. This sweater runs small, another style medium bought same time is quite large."
3.0,JUST OKAY
3.0,Light fabric but once in the washer and it looks worn out.
3.0,They are all slightly different in size...
3.0,"Runs small; returned the M but the L was even snug. Then the L wouldn't even turn on; yes, we made sure the battery pack was working on another device so it was definitely the vest. Returned for a refund."
3.0,"good material, the amount of pockets is good<br />BUT...it isn't as big as advertising. if you carry a glass container, one of those wallets that do cards/money and an actual book and ONE package of small meds...well it looks ready to be used as a BIG MACE."
3.0,Cute masks but beware if you’re looking for medical-grade masks! Rating is 3 stars because they do not make this obvious
3.0,"Good quality, but these are big girl sizes. Originally bought for my five-year-old daughter who these ran too big for"
3.0,They were super comfortable but only lasted a few months before getting holes in the seams. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Be careful of the clasp on this. I bought it for my husband as a birthday gift and on the first day of wearing it the magnetic clasp opened up and he lost it. We’re both so bummed. ☹️.
3.0,This item was very uncomfortable for my 8 year old.  The place that goes over the nose bridge is too hard and I believe that the manufacture should place some type of cushion to make it much more comfortable.
3.0,The wide straps are great but the cup area itself doesn't really hold the boobs. It's more of a heavy tshirt type. Definitely not for running.
3.0,"If you can tolerate a rough synthetic fabric, dress has a good fit.  True to the size chart with flattering cut.  Fabric is not comfy, however."
3.0,Toe box could be wider.  Went up in size and still too narrow.
3.0,We liked the jacket but it was too small
3.0,"These look beautiful BUT you need 48 hours worth of patience to put these in. They’re not that durable as two of them broke in my ear as I was trying to close them. Be warned, these take time and a lot of patience. You may need help from a patient friend. Otherwise, they have the exact look I was aiming for."
3.0,"Dresses fit nice but the dress was made weird way too much material in the breast area im a 42 DD and got a 3x the breast area sagged very low so I too dress apart and had to cut 4 inches off each breast area and stitch dress because of how it was made. But the dress is comfortable also the skirt went down past my knee so I cut the slit to make it short to be alittle more sexy since the dress was so long, And im 5'3. Gave it three starts cause the material was good quality, soft, breathable and nice. Would of gave it 5 stars if I didnt have to take dress apart and fix it."
3.0,"Was really excited to get these for me, but the L/XL is so small they fit my daughter who wears a size 2. I can't see anyone over a size 6 in the L/XL and have them look anything like the images posted.<br /><br />I would've rated this product a lot lower if my daughter didn't love them so much. They are super soft, comfortable and seemingly well constructed."
3.0,Not a big as I was expecting. Will still help me organize my luggage.
3.0,It was really wrinkled after a few hours the material is mostly cotton and the black attracts lent from the air it seems by the end of the day my black covered with white specs. It does feel comfy is stretchy and covered my huge belly.
3.0,"Runs a bit small thinking I should've ordered a large instead of medium, leggings a little thinner than I expected but not too thin to the point that its see through. Good leggings overall but if you like thick leggings these are not it. I don't see why people are saying they will keep you warm, I will assure you they will not they are not that thick."
3.0,Fabric is cotton but super thin!!
3.0,The quality of the fabric
3.0,The fit and feel is wonderful on these. I'm 5'5 with small chest and round tummy. About 175lb.<br />However the colors do not match the photos at all. I ordered a bright blue (photo looks rich periwinkle) but received a color closer to the denim blue. I ordered the dark purple-1 but the color I received looks exactly like maroon. I ordered Navy and got Navy. At least that one was correct. And yes I verified the color name printed on the package was exactly what I had ordered.
3.0,It’s ok for my son but not for my husband. I was hoping it would be a bit heavier.
3.0,"I purchased this hoping that it would be an ivory color, as in the picture.  Was disappointed it was very yellow!"
3.0,"I love the warmth this provides, but it’s too tight above my knee."
3.0,strap broke 3 weeks after I got them
3.0,A little to loose
3.0,"Cute and nice to have several size and color options, but a little hard to get in and out. The stud is held in by prongs which easily snag on towels, shirts etc. I bought these as I was trying to find one with these metal but I had to end up taking my piercing out completely because it kept getting a bump on it I couldn’t get to go away even with medicine. Not sure if this is related to this jewelry or not but I hadn’t had a problem before so it’s worth mentioning."
3.0,Cute but super small. Had to return. Made for tiny body. Doll like.
3.0,The buttons to clip the band off the watch don't work. I was pushing in on the button and the little piece that snaps onto the watchface wasn't even moving so it's hard to get the band off.
3.0,"I think these items are always going to be better than they actually are. Clearly made for teeny-framed women, multiple loose ends that need to be cut, and has a zipper on the hood that's of no use."
3.0,"You basically get what you pay for. Stainless steel is not the problem, The problem is the skeleton part. it starts getting ugly within 2-3 weeks."
3.0,"Love the green.  However, this is medium weight t-shirt material, nowhere near sweatshirt.  I wear an x-large shirt and ordered a large.  A medium would have fit."
3.0,Had to return - the size is for skinny people and was too tight.  Beautiful and light weight are the Pros to this product along with the price.  The seller was great in getting me my refund asap.
3.0,"Bought this to wear over ea light jacket and is tight, the adjustment is not enough, much smaller then the 3m safety vest size chart"
3.0,"Super cute, but kinda disappointed. I was holding it and must have been twisting it(?) and the handle fell off. I was able to put it back on but was holding it by the strap and that broke. No fixing that, unfortunately."
3.0,I didn't know it is made with stretchy material so it's really fitted.
3.0,Certainly not as shown in picture.  I returned item/
3.0,Cute but not the best quality. After it got wet at the beach it became not as stiff.
3.0,I thought it was adorable…. Until it left marks on me. It was a good deal but I can’t wear it tight enough to keep it working properly. Taking it on and off was easy though.
3.0,"Ordered extra large cause the person I was buying for isn't the smallest fella in the world, but this thing was made for someone 6'4 I stature."
3.0,It fits perfectly but the clips weren’t glued on very  securely because one of my clips fell of during the delivery process
3.0,"Fit as expected. The material is stiffer than I expected, causing some difficulty in making the knot look right."
3.0,Cute but painful. And hard to put the straps back on in an efficient manner.
3.0,This particular color dress is too long for a beach coverup.  ‘Im  5’9” and this dress came down past my knees.
3.0,The colors on the shirt are beautiful but the XLG shirt I bought looks like I'm wearing the wrong shirt. I would like to give it a higher grade but it really is tiny.
3.0,"The quality is so so. The sizing is pretty off to me. I bought a 4T and it is literally too small for my 2 year old. He is not chubby at all, though he is considered quite tall for his age. I do however like the design and my son adores it so I'm needing to do a return."
3.0,"Most of us have to wear a mask in public, appointments, stores, etc. This is a comfortable mask. Almost forget you have it on."
3.0,Too small for big heads
3.0,"Bought for a 5'1"" woman at:118 lbs. This doesn't fit someone with a shorter (think) torso. It's designed to hide belly bulge...but if you have a slim waist it makes you look odd as there is excess around the waist. She didn't like the fit."
3.0,I bought the 2xl size. And it doesn’t fit me. The quality I very good but the size is smaller than the right one
3.0,Cute idea but difficult to get on.
3.0,Shirt was a lot shorter than expected
3.0,My husband liked these very much but they were way too narrow for him to wear them comfortably.  I returned the sandals and bought the next larger size.
3.0,Much to big for wrist
3.0,"Thin, hugs the body, shows every nook and cranny."
3.0,Quality is definitely lacking but it's a cool shirt for halloween and costume purposes. Collar is a bit to large.
3.0,"It's a beautiful poncho however thinner than I thought.  The ponch and right sleeve is also very short, shorter than I expected and looked in the picture.  Sending it back."
3.0,Comfy fabric but this top runs way too large. I usually wear between a small and a medium d the small in this top fits more like a large and accentuates all the wrong places making you appear much bigger than you actually are.
3.0,"I wear a size 16 and bought XL. When it came, I didn't even bother trying them on. Definitely a size 12. That waistband was *not* going around me.<br /><br />Having said that, they look nice. The details look painted on so you actually may end up looking like you are naked and wearing body paint - I dunno. Perhaps I just looked at them too closely."
3.0,I wanted this to hold my tools but the pockets really aren't great for that.  But it could come in handy for small jobs.  It also smells lime petroleum - It’s airing out in my shed - I might be anle to handle the smell in the spring.
3.0,"ok, cheep necklace"
3.0,"My wife thought the design, quality and style were great, but sizing is way off so we were forced to return it."
3.0,"This shirt fits across the shoulders, but the sleeve's are way too long"
3.0,Pretty but much lager than I expected so sent them back.
3.0,"*Update* I just hand washed this and hung it to dry and the bear head is already becoming discolored. Who knows what will happen if it goes in the washer, not great quality<br /><br />Super cute, looks just like the picture. Since it came from China it did take a while to get here. Still too big for my little one so I can't judge sizing. It's a little thinner than I expected and some of the stitching is funky on the inside (pictured), overall I'm happy with my purchase."
3.0,It is not an accurate color representation of the watch bands.<br /><br />The deep wine should have a gold/rose gold clamp. The “dark green” is a teal blue. It doesn’t have a hint of green whatsoever. It’s a little frustrating because it’s not what I technically paid for.<br /><br />The fit and comfort is 100% though. The fit of the band to Apple Watch is extremely flush too.
3.0,They did run a little bigger than I thought but I bought them to just wear to bed.
3.0,"Seems o.k. for the price. Do not expect class A materials. China has many categories of quallity when manufacturing products, and refering to something cheap, they do mean it, but is stuff that you can replace anytime."
3.0,"Fine, but nothing special"
3.0,I cant use these gloves when I'm truing to use my IPhone. But they keep my hands warm in mild cold weather.
3.0,Comfy and cute. Wish it was a little thicker
3.0,"Very cute, but runs a bit big.  I’m 5’4 and weigh 123 and ordered a size small."
3.0,Quality was just ok but it is cute
3.0,"It is accurately reflected in picture. Too overpowering and long for 5,5&#34; me"
3.0,"They are super cute, but very cheap feeling. I guess the price explains why they're so cheap. Overall, not bad for an extra pair of cute sunglasses laying around the house."
3.0,Cut but when washed they just get so fuzzy. The top is not large enough to cover toes. When worn with shoes they just roll down the back
3.0,Normally in women I fit a small. I sized up to a medium but still way too short.
3.0,"Purchased these thinking they were comparable with another brand.  Not even close.  Good for every day wear, but not for running.  The support for the arch is lacking."
3.0,"This a beautiful watch but is in no way luminous.  The definition of luminous is:full of or shedding light; bright or shining, especially in the dark.  I was looking for a watch that I could see in the dark.  I searched on Amazon for a glow in the dark watch and this one came up.  Buyer beware, you can not see the time in the dark with this one.  It is also very difficult to close the clasp."
3.0,"They are really nice pants but they were too big on me, I recommend them but keep the size in mind."
3.0,these look to be warm and the pointer finger on the right hand has a patch that can be used for a cell phone  but the fit is snug - a bit concerned that if I wash them they may shrink -
3.0,"Normal size too skin tight for me, should of sized up...will give it away"
3.0,It is the same as the photo but it doesn’t have very good quality
3.0,"Great looking band, but don't expect it to be good quality. This broke the first time I played soccer with friends. Countless of times my watched was pulled on, etc over years of use with the original band, and nothing. This one, first time, it busted."
3.0,"I love Helikon products. But this one misses the mark for me. But, I think thats my fault. I was expecting a more casual scarf. This is a very large pattern, net-like weave, and not a soft cotton. More for camo/concealment than an actual scarf. I feel like I could net fish with it. However, it is well made. I just won't wear it as I had expected to. I will however, stick with Helikon products. They're great and very functional."
3.0,"I gave this a middle-of-the-road rating as I had to return it. I have large hands and I simply could not fit the watchband over my hand.<br /><br />The product looked well-made and it was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Unfortunately, I'll never really know just how good the product is."
3.0,It was pretty good except it was missing a couple of pieces that were supposed to be included according to the description. 2 bracelets missing
3.0,"Print is lovely, but the style did not fit the season I wanted to wear it for."
3.0,"Nice looking purse, but it wasn't what I thought it would be for my liking..."
3.0,A bit shorter than it appeared in the picture but other than that it all is about the same! The fabric is on the cheap side but you get what you pay for...
3.0,I wear a size 10 and the large was clingy and too tight. Color is pretty!
3.0,Tried the mask on when i got home and it ripped in half while trying to put it on. Definitely not made for adult size. Fast shipping and looks great other wise.
3.0,Took a lot of effort to cut holes in a belt.
3.0,The muscle toner is small but easy to use. I use the toner while I'm watching the television or sitting idle at my desk. Comes with a leaflet exercise examples.
3.0,"I have always had a silver hoop in my nose, so I was looking for a little variety when I purchased these. They're very pretty, for the most part, but a couple of them have stones that are seemingly large and might be a bit overwhelming on some faces, as on mine."
3.0,it is ok not my favorite
3.0,The front is short - so short you cannot create decrotive ties.  Treturned mine
3.0,"Nice, but they break easy - why I have to keep repurchasing"
3.0,"The colors are really subtle compared to the photos, can't really tell the difference between the gold, silver, and rose gold shades. Which is kind of a disappointment because I bought these especially for the rose gold earrings. But, considering the amount of earrings you get for the price point, it's not that bad."
3.0,It does the job it's intended to do
3.0,These are great if you are just using your laptop. The gloves are connected and have to stay plugged in to have heat.
3.0,"Okay, so I loved the material and the color.  The straps felt too short even at the longest adjustment, but not terribly uncomfortable.  I actually wore this dress backwards from the way the model in the picture is wearing it and found the cut and fit much cuter that way 🤷‍♀️.  I did wear it with a belt under the bust to give it some shape as it does look a bit nightgown-like without some cinching.  Wrinkly material, but easy to steam.  Overall, good purchase for price.  I am 5’6, 160lb with 36DD bust and generally wear a med-large in tops and a size 12 in pants/dresses."
3.0,"Gave it a 3 because It is a very nice style if it would only fit. I fit into a 1X so ordered a 2X, This dress actually would fit a person that wears an XL"
3.0,"It's a very pretty silky nightgown. It does run a size big. I have ordered 2 for both myself and daughter.  It's lightweight but doesn't give to cooling affect that I hoped it would although the fabric is very thin. Depending on who is around you might have to wear a robe. Machine wash low with cold water and fine to put in the dryer, no shrinking. I am pleased with my purchase of 2."
3.0,It's more of a blue-grey color and I thought it would be grey.
3.0,"I'd say these qualify more as briefs. I'm a size 4 and I got the small, and they're a little big on me...not terrible, but not the kind of fit I like for slightly-better-than-average undies. They go up closer to my belly button, so definitely no hip fit. The material is soft and stretchy, and I have some issues with them riding up, but they may work better for someone who prefers a fuller style."
3.0,"It's honestly too dark. But, to each, it's own."
3.0,"Comfortable, washes well, but it's a little too loose for me, luckily it PJs and I can wear them baggy."
3.0,"The order arrived quickly, but the picture was a bit deceiving. The quality of the product I received was not nearly as good as the picture suggested but that was to be expected. I also though the zebra band appeared thicker in the picture and description than it actually is, however, it was still an okay product and for how much I spent on it, it was worth the money."
3.0,"after one month, the top part broke... but i've only used it twice......"
3.0,I thought the skirt came with the shirt... it does not. It also runs rather large. You can only return if you want less than half of your money back according to seller.
3.0,"The fake crystals are very very obviously fake, they're plastic. The necklaces are flimsy and fall apart easily."
3.0,"This blouse gets stained and wrinkled out of nowhere I swear! I had to eventually just toss it because I was tired of steaming it or cleaning it. The fabric is a little weird too, it's not super soft or silky. Has a slight texture to it."
3.0,The straps feel very cheap.
3.0,Cute but the stones fall off easily. Daughter wore them for ten minutes in the house and there are at least 8 missing.
3.0,Runs small for plus size
3.0,"This costume is not high quality but it is what I expected. It's on par with any other cheap costume. When it arrived, the shipping box was fine but the mask to the costume had been smashed (I guess before packing?). Was able to return for a refund and went ahead and reordered. Second costume was fine."
3.0,"If you're looking for some shiny satin like disco shorts, these guys are what you need!  All ready for the 70s party!  Not really what I was looking for but, meh"
3.0,Not that long. Vibrant colors.
3.0,"earrings are beautiful and comfortable, but the plating started to wear off in less than a month."
3.0,One of the horns is a little off center but that's okay I was going to add things onto this anyway
3.0,Esta super bonita
3.0,not too expensive but poor quality
3.0,"Ordered this sort of last minute; horn, face mask, and gloves showed up but the necklace was no where to be found.  Overall it was cheap, showed up fast, and did the job."
3.0,"The bag looks nice but the leather is a bit shiny. Along with that the bag does not hold its shape even with stuff in it. These too factors together make it look cheap, in my opinion. But, it is a nice size bag and I like that it came with two straps."
3.0,Really more of a cozy fleece rather than a coat. I typically wear size large. Ordered XL because it comes from China. Width was good (prefer my outerwear a bit oversized) but wasn't as long as I was hoping. Took quite a while to arrive.<br />I ordered the deep gray but the actual color is more of an olive brown.
3.0,Good quality but size too small
3.0,Order one size up. Fits tight around mid section
3.0,Runs small cheap material
3.0,The shirts Have a good quality fit good I really like the shirts but I do have an issue the ones I received were really stinky like armpits so somebody worn them before I got them
3.0,Fit was not as described.
3.0,"Order 1-1.5 sizes larger than actual shoe size.  I ordered size 12 and they are very snug and I was hoping for a looser, sandal fit.  The top strap is a disappointing design as the loop routinely retracts into the sleeve at the top of the sandal requiring you to fish it out in order to secure the top strap.<br /><br />The quality of the sandal is very nice for the price point, but the combination of small for size and poor top strap design leads to a strong discouragement to purchase.  There are definitely better fisherman's sandals out there, but perhaps at a higher price."
3.0,Comfortable only set back if you wear eye glasses they will fog up.
3.0,"Liked the product, however it was bent funny so I had to reform it to comfortably go against a face. I ended up having to glue many stones back in during the reforming process. Otherwise, very happy with it."
3.0,It was a bit tight and uncomfortable. I was only able to wear once.
3.0,Loved the color bought in 2 sizes one too big other too small.. Fabric nice flow but I guess I'm just not a jumper person
3.0,Kinda see through and definitely not good for cellulite- these almost amplify it! Love the color though and super comfy!
3.0,Love the look but they are a little too tight pm my upper calf and they still slide down into my boot
3.0,It is more of a olive green color. I still like it but it is not what is pictured. Lapis  must come in different colors because mine was not blue.
3.0,"I’ve very torn on if I am going to keep these. They are definitely not as advertised. The shorts are 95% polyester, so they are not a flowly material as the photos may make it appear. The material is almost like a product made to wear in the water. The fit is a lot a little odd. I am petite, but I find the seem from the waist band to the crotch to be extremely long."
3.0,The dress was slightly too tight at my thighs and the dress was way too short. There was no way I could of bent over. Overall I liked the look and quality of the dress. I did find the see through portion at the top under the boobs a little too sexy for a family wedding which was my reason for buying the dress. I’ll be returning the dress
3.0,Ordered the rust color. The fabric was kind of sparkly. Didn't catch that in the picture and it was not cute. The fit was good though. Returned due to sparkle in fabric.
3.0,Very thin material. Felt too tight in some areas and loose in others. It just didn’t do anything for my body. I’m 5’7 155 pounds and j ordered a large.
3.0,These fit awesome.  The only problem I found is your pads and/or panty shields do not stick to them and that's problem for me.
3.0,Covers the niples fine but the lift tape came off as soon as I broke a sweat. In Louisiana that’s 8 months out of the year. I’m a DD so the weight of the breast could’ve easily affected the performance. If you are a B cup or possibly a C then this will probably work well for you.
3.0,Should have listened to the previous reviews. Material is more see-through than most dresses. Fits perfect and looks great if you wore a slip.
3.0,looks bigger in the picture.  It was actually smaller looking on the wrist.  Thin leather. Otherwise nice when worn with other bracelets
3.0,"Nice looking bracelet, but all parts are weak and fall apart"
3.0,"It's a decently simple, lightweight, inexpensive watch. The only bad thing that made me return the watch is the ticking. It's loud AF! You can hear it just holding the watch in front of your face to check the time."
3.0,"Loved the style of the dress, it fit me but I wasn't happy how it looked on my body shape plus. Overall the dress is perfect."
3.0,"It doesn't fit with all men's sizes though. In fact, it's kind of small for my head and it cannot hold up all of my hair, especially my bang. I'm not saying the seller is bad. It's just that the product doesn't meet my requirements well."
3.0,"Cute, but look li8ke plastic, cheaply made."
3.0,"Tight across my large chest, and the bottom gathered and rolls under."
3.0,Prefer more black...white stripe accentuated tummy area.<br />I always buy Reebok just this one did not work for me.
3.0,Just thin. Can see thru it!
3.0,"I Liked the looks, and great size band, but watch was not running.  Loose battery was sent.  I don't &#34;do&#34; batteries. Sir."
3.0,Picture is a little misleading.  It's a gaiter.  Like pulling a tube sock over your face.  Not loose at all.  However the print is fantastic.
3.0,I returned it because it didn't fit.  But the return was hassle free.
3.0,This mask failed the blowing out a candle test so it's probably not offering the best protection in terms of preventing the spread of germs. It does look good though so using it with a regular mask underneath worked pretty well for me.
3.0,Wanted to like these shorts but they are thin and have very little spandex... also the run small in size...
3.0,It smells so strong and the horns are not enough black.
3.0,"Cute but 2 buttons popped of within minutes of trying on even though it was not tight. For the price, workmanship should have been better."
3.0,I love them but they fall out too easy I already lost like 4 pairs
3.0,"Not the best quality!Cheaper quality than expected, very light in weight and some have rusty spots, don't think its worth the money"
3.0,"Cute swimsuit, but material is a bit thin and poorly sewn. I wish is was better made as the style is super cute and I love the colors"
3.0,"Bought these for my 5 yr old daughter. Tried ordering online because stores stock mostly liscensed merchandise character stuff and we’re not into it. They look really cute. However the top band was way too tight to put her foot in, so we cut then off. After that the slippers fit ok but tighter than expected. She has  narrow feet and I’ve never struggled to find her shoes. We will end up buying her a new pair of slippers ASAP. Shipping also took about 4 days longer than anticipated."
3.0,We use for a party and was good but went you sit. It was so tight that the middle was breaking.
3.0,I ordered these gloves to wear with a coat with the shorter sleeves. These gloves work like I had hoped thy are a little thin but they get the job done. They're a little cheap with the stitching around the edges but barely noticeable that's where the 3 stars one from. Also not sure these will work with heavier arms they re cut on the slim side.
3.0,Way too small or 1 or 2 sizes up
3.0,No pockets for your hands. More of a windbreaker weight. Not a true jacket.
3.0,Cuter online
3.0,I loved the organization of this jewelry pouch but when I received it the zipper was broken - I ended up returning it without a replacement.
3.0,"I am not a big fan of this watch band. The look is not really what is expressed in the photos. It looks almost like cardboard to me, so I would feel a little awkward wearing it in public.<br /><br />I also believe that the band is pretty thin in width. For me, with smaller wrists, that shouldn't be a problem. However, it just looked awkward when I wore the band.<br /><br />Lastly, the connection of the band is not well made. I believe that this could be the first thing to break if anything was to fall apart. It takes a lot to break a watch band in every day life, so I am not TOO concerned about that happening. However, if one was to fail, this would likely be it.<br /><br />If you don't mind the look or the size of the band, this might be okay for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
3.0,I thought it looked smaller but it's too big.  I would like to send it back.  Sorry!
3.0,"I bought a size 12 for my son and they were ridiculously small like they were painted on. I reordered a size 16. My son is 4""11"" and 92lbs. He always wears a 12."
3.0,"This will only fit like the picture if you are 5'5&#34; or shorter. I am 6' and it hits me well above the knee which loos weird for the cut of the dress. Plus the fabric is super cheap, but you get what you pay for. Probably would be cute on someone short."
3.0,"I'm a 34B, but the bust felt it slightly larger than me.  Good band and coverage on the waist.  I like it for the price. The only irritating part is the under wire on the left side that keeps popping out and ends up poking me.  Same as the other blue one piece I bought from this brand."
3.0,Other than the fact that it was to small. It is a very nice kimono.
3.0,"These earrings are very lightweight and classy, but the smaller ones do not stay completely clasped. The bigger 2 sets are perfect. I just wish I could return the 2 smaller sets. They also are very hard to put through my second holes."
3.0,The pants are comfortable but very very loud walking around in them...People can hear you coming from far off.
3.0,"Okay these look more or less like the  picture.<br />I can say they are somewhat shorter than what is shown on the picture, but are very nice looking on and stylish. I dressed them up with a cranberry sweater dress.<br />No complaints I love them."
3.0,"Was a bit big for a &#34;kids&#34; hat -- but overall quality is exceptional. Very good and thick embroidering. It's both tall and wide for my head (6 5/8 hat size) and I ended up sending it back. Writing this review as I believe it would be a great hat -- just need to measure your coconut  (not that sizing is provided, so hope this helps). :)"
3.0,Way too long. Had to alter.
3.0,"Color nice, shape nice, but definitely looks very cheap. Sorry"
3.0,Fit as expected. A bit thin and doesn't stand up to washing very well.
3.0,The quality is pretty good but the size is very small I was a little disappointed in the size
3.0,"They fit great all the way up to my thighs. They start to curl down toward my knees upon standing and give me a muffin top int the thigh region. With a garter belt holding them up, these are a dream come true."
3.0,"I bought these masks because the reviews said they were good for larger faces. This is not true in my experience. The masks are well made, but they are not for men (even if average size). My 11 year old child enjoys the fit of this mask. It was far too small for me and quite uncomfortable."
3.0,The pants were fine fit wise but the top was a little smaller than I needed. Workable but a bit annoying.
3.0,Really pretty but don't buy if you have a long torso :/
3.0,Battery already dead after 4 days of wearing. A bummer as purchased for family member that focuses on the time. Off to buy something else. This appeared used sold as new.
3.0,"The material is perfect, but it’s not long as described, and for that reason I have to return it back!"
3.0,"I really do love this wallet. I was looking for a wallet that was different and would be a conversation starter when people saw it, and this wallet was definitely it. Every time I pull it out people would comment on it or have a nice chuckle, I've gotten tons of compliments on it, and my girlfriend loves it to. It's deffinitly not an expensive wallet, one that's hand made from top quality materials or anything. It's very thin, deffinitly not top quality, the credit card slots are kind of small and can barely fit a card in them, which makes it hard to get it cards in and out sometimes, but over time they tend to get stretched out a little and your cards will fit a little better, and are easier to get in and out of the slots. The design on the outside of the wallet is decent, I've ended up using this wallet for about 4 years now, because I've lost my other wallets and always end up going back to this one, and most of the design is still there, except right at the fold in the middle, it's all rubbed off there now. If the quality of this wallet was a lil better and the credit card slots were a lil bigger I would give it 5 stars, but overall I really do like this wallet, and for the price I think it's worth it, I would probably buy again, and would recommend it if your looking for a different looking, cheap, conversation starting wallet ."
3.0,"Came and the part that goes through your piercing was bent, not that it was the sellers fault though."
3.0,I don’t think I have a large head or a small head. I’m medium head sized. These were just a little too big when I need something to keep my glasses still on my face while horseback riding. They’re easy to use and they seemed comfortable but no go on the size.
3.0,They are very basic ..but i guess they will serve the purpose
3.0,Elegant but fits large
3.0,"Did not ""fall"" the way seen on model but got a couple of compliments"
3.0,good not great
3.0,I wouldn't buy this shirt again
3.0,Was not what I'm looking for
3.0,"Dress came with spots so ended up with more expense for cleaners get them out.  Also ordered ""white"" but looked more cream against my white sweater.  I made it work, but just so you know.  Loved the fit."
3.0,I'm not too crazy about the material.  I should have read the details a little better.  I really thought it would be more like a sweater.  Haven't even worn yet.
3.0,"The glasses are perfect but they came with a black pouch that was supposedly be black with a black string and logo.I got a black pouch,no logo,and pink string"
3.0,"Nice enough for the price; didn't actually come with any documentation to verify that they were Akoya and not freshwater pearls.  I did inform the seller and they sent a generic verification card, but there was nothing on it that could be tied directly to my purchase.  That said, I did also get a &#34;free gift&#34; with purchase - a pair of fresh water button pearl earrings (which did have appropriate documentation with them).  So overall satisfied."
3.0,A little tight on the head but the colors are great and they look exactly as they do in the picture
3.0,Despite that these are way thinner and stretchier than pictured they are still pretty good. If you have a bigger belly you dont need to size up which is nice. Downside to them being super stretchy they end up sagging in the thigh creating a bit of jean to inner thigh rub..
3.0,"bought for my garmin vivoactive 4s, easy to change/install.  However, with tighter fit, band would snap off at quick release pin when arm flexed.  Added a link and it was too loose, yet still had same problem of band snapping off when watch rode up my arm and my arm flexed.  Had to find a different band after losing 2 pins."
3.0,"I like the bags since they don’t collapse while loading your groceries; however, when we opened our package, the one was torn at the seam."
3.0,"Its fun, but not made great."
3.0,Super cute but small was WAY to small.<br /><br />I am 4'10 inches and 106 pounds and it was small.
3.0,absolutely beautiful pigment but a little heavier than I needed. I needed super-flowy and lightweight.
3.0,"One of the shoes came smushed with a permanent crease in it, also they run bout a half size small"
3.0,"Ordered a small- but got a medium top and a small bottom :/<br /><br />The bottom is a little too small, if they were going to mess up on the sizing, I wish it was switched opposite. Too much work to return and I needed it for the weekend. Quality is alright, probably not going to last more than one season. The cut is super cute, love the retro look, flattering."
3.0,It's very cute just was to small...
3.0,I got a large and I’m 5’6 and weight about 135 145 and the white shirt was so tight it was cutting off blood and the blazer was okay .the skeet was perfect and so were the tights !!
3.0,"This is a great dress, but it is a bit short. I'm 5'7 with longer legs than a torso. I ordered a medium because the size guide said medium for dress sizes 8/10 I wish I had ordered a large."
3.0,My only complaint is that the bow piece broke off of the chain. Make sure that you tighten the loop connecting the bow and the bar.
3.0,"the sleeves were a little to big, but fit was good"
3.0,Buttons on sleeves fall off easily
3.0,Product is as pictured. A good buy for the price I paid. They are not the best quality. One of them was received with runs already (see pictures). Hopefully the fact that there are 6 of them and can be rotated they will last longer.
3.0,The straps that attach to my camera are very thin and flimsy. I don’t trust them to hold secure. I replaced them with my own. The rest of the harness is fine
3.0,"Got here pretty quickly. It was a 3 piece: top, skirt & thong. Pretty cheap & cute for the price in comparison to Spencer's or any other store at the mall. I'm 5'3 & weigh 130 so I thought a medium would fit perfectly but it was a little big. The only complaint I have besides the size is that the skirt came with a tear on the side. I can sow it but I shouldn't have to in the first place."
3.0,"I thought I wanted a narrow/trim bag, but i found out I don't.  It's too hard to fit everything I carry.  I does look great, though, and I've gotten numerous compliments.  The outside pockets are my favorite."
3.0,"I really like these, but am not a fan that they're one size. I'm 5'2 108lbs and they're a little loose on me. I do love the material and how warm they are! I would rather there be sizes so I can get them a little bit smaller."
3.0,Very flattering top but runs small.
3.0,They're nice but break very easily. I don't mind fixing them so it wasn't a big deal for me but be careful.
3.0,"don't get me wrong, it is a nice dress, but i wear a size 12 and a 36 C and it's a little too small around the chest... overall, it's good for a beach cover up."
3.0,"I like this bag a lot. It's a great size, has a good amount of pockets and I like the straps (main reason for purchase. However... The 3rd time I took it out when I went to put my jacket in the outer pocket the zipper came off. I went to reattach it and the met snapped. I ordered replacement zipper for it and will replace it but I did t want to have $15 added to my price for this. Hope the rest are fine but when they break I have replacement ready for them."
3.0,The jacket is small for it's size
3.0,"I love how cute and lightweight this dress is for warmer weather. The only reason for giving it 3 stars it that it always shifts one way in the chest area making the dress look funny. I will still use it to wear around the house when it's hot, but I wouldn't wear it out anywhere because of the constant need to adjust the chest area. I guess you can't expect much from a dress this cheap."
3.0,"they are ok, have to continually pull them up.."
3.0,"Pretty color, slinkier material than I thought it would be.  Order up a size?"
3.0,"I like these okay, but won't buy again.  They feel and look cheap.  You will probably need to tighten the clasp on the back to hold the wire, otherwise it might open and fall out of your ear.  I will wear them, but they are not really what I was hoping for.  I would never give them as a gift."
3.0,"Cute shirt, except it comes w pads. Because of seaming, pads sit very high up. Like on my collar bones. Can remove, but still left w/ seam in a weird spot. Bottoms fit a size too small for me. Came w a hair cap in a different pattern than shirt."
3.0,Turtleneck was too small
3.0,"I really liked how this looked, but the way it clasps together, it always seems to come undone and sometimes you don't even feel it come undone unless you notice it's not there. Nice material and cool design, but needs a better clasp that stays together to stay on your wrist."
3.0,For what it costs I got what I expected. Tight. Somewhat see through spandexy material.
3.0,Good product but is larger than the size chart. Choose a smaller size.
3.0,its ok for the price.  stones were off set.
3.0,I ordered a size toddler 7 but this shoe is like a toddler 10 it's so big! It's no where close to a T7 in other brands. We can't wear these yet.
3.0,"Great product, very soft feel, build quality and stitching quality a bit lackluster. Though being reasonably priced helps."
3.0,"The quality is really good, but they are way bigger than an average size. My biggest concern was to return the product, which wasn't possible to do. Luckily I sold it to a friend"
3.0,Very nice ring. But it's definitely not that heavy titanium.
3.0,Not really what I expected but may keep 1 set out the 2 I ordered.  They are made out of this leather-like material So the aren’t too straight. They are too big and kinda cheesy if you ask me. Most pairs are too dark you can’t see the design. I like the pencil set and since I’m teaching virtually these will be only earrings my students can actually notice and appreciate. This is why I’m keeping 1 set. I originally wanted to give a pair to my colleagues who teach science but there aren’t pretty to be a decent gift.
3.0,"Not the best quality in stitching, but my niece loved them. That's all that matters."
3.0,I initially returned the first dress cause it was wayyyyy too big. The second dress was really cute but HUGE in the chest. Fit perfectly everywhere else. Perfect for a one time wear. Got a huge hole in it after one use.
3.0,estaba encantada con mi correa hasta que tuego de usarla tres veces se rompio la hebilla.
3.0,Slightly small.  Nice fit though.
3.0,Cute dress but if you have any curves it will be too tight. Ordered a Med and the booty was very form fitting :/
3.0,I received my leggings packaged together so I'm confused why one pair ( the grey) arrived with 2 small holes in the front and a very large one in the back. The pink and black arrived in perfect condition. Sad when a product you're excited about arrives this way-  Hopefully others customers have had better luck.
3.0,The clasp was much too small....otherwise a good produck!
3.0,Very cute design with darts and banded bottom. Material is surprisingly a swimsuit like fabric. TTS.
3.0,I vary between a size S-M in t0shirts.  I ordered a size M in this top and felt like I was swimming in it.  I would definitely recommend sizing down.  I'm a 36 in the bust and felt like the M had about 2 extra inches which just made the shirt look too baggy on me.  I'm sending it back. Other than the sizing problems the tank top was very nicely made and I loved the color.
3.0,Arrived promptly but without a feather.
3.0,"To small, but will work"
3.0,"really too large for a tie tack but looks good as a lapel pin.  However, I needed tie tack so was a little disappointed.  Nice depending on what you are using it for."
3.0,Case is good but it is kind of small and doesn't fit dollars without much struggle.
3.0,"the design is great. I like my sunglasses a little large, but the way the nose piece sets, it sort of sets it away from your face and looks awkward. maybe its just my face. they look okay if I wear them really low on my nose but then again shouldn't they just fit like their supposed to? I guess I cant say for sure, it might look better on someone else."
3.0,"I like the concept, unfortunately the problem is that unless you really spend time to get the items under enough bands, most of the items will fall out during commute. Easier to get a zip up storage or bag."
3.0,"While beautiful, these earrings are clearly not white. They are more candle light or even a light peach in color. Disappointed as the title & description says ""White""."
3.0,"The design of this band makes these plastic parts stick way out on some watches. Make sure the lug holes are near the outside of the lugs; if they are ""deeper"", like on this Bulova Lunar Pilot, the watch looks excessively wide and does not wear as comfortably.<br /><br />That said, the band is very comfortable and easy to swap. If it fits the lugs of your watch better, it will probably be a fine band."
3.0,hoping to use it for night driving but the lens was too dark
3.0,"I like the bathing suit that I received. But, it wasn’t the one pictured, when I ordered. The straps and back are very different."
3.0,"I received the necklace in an envelope with no paperwork. No proof of purchase....nothing. The necklace was not nearly as impressive as shown, and this was to be a gift. I am very disappointed in my purchase."
3.0,These sneakers offer what it states but for me there was no real arch support and it made my feet look extra large. My sister in law like them so she's wearing them. Something good did come out of it.
3.0,"Super soft and comfortable. But if you are looking for any amount of compression to hold you in...these are not the leggings. Otherwise, nice feel."
3.0,"I had a very similar track jacket in high school that I wore threadbare and I've missed ever since - I own several PattyBoutik tops, sweaters, and dresses and have really liked them all, so while $50 was a bit steep, I ordered this one. The fit is good, but it's very thin - similar to some of the long-sleeved tops I've ordered from them. It's not lined, and the pockets aren't even tacked down inside. I was expecting better quality for $50. I mulled over whether to keep it for about a week, and finally decided that I would - it fits, it's comfortable, and it doesn't get that cold where I live, so I can wear it for a few months out of the year."
3.0,I like it except it is too large for my  wrist.
3.0,Really liked the pattern & length but ripped after about 3 weeks of use. Really wanted to love these for my twists
3.0,This is super cute but runs small - make sure to get bigger size
3.0,"I love the look of these shoes and they fit my wide feet comfortably. HOWEVER, the footbed is very narrow and half of the soles of my feet would be exposed to the ground which kind of defeats the purpose of wearing shoes. Sadly, I’m returning them."
3.0,The lights could be a little brighter
3.0,I followed the sizing chart (normally a 36B/C) and ordered a large. Should have gone up a size. The bodice piece was tight (including the bottom band) and rubbed my skin raw under my armpits by the end of the day.
3.0,The plugs seem to be cut small. I would order them again but a size bigger.
3.0,"I work in a warehouse freezer, sub zero temps for my entire shift. These gloves are great at keeping my hands and fingers warm and comfortable. Unfortunately, it only took about a week of work to wear off most of the grip texture on the fingers (palms are fine) and a few days later I noticed some of the seams were starting to open up. I can't imagine the gloves will last more than another 1-3 weeks before they're too damaged to be useful. Touchscreen functionality is ok, but not great.<br /><br />Overall great quality gloves but don't seem well suited for heavy duty work."
3.0,"I have tiny wrists and this is small. Very small. Not for most women and if you add beads it won't fit at all.<br />Quality is fine, but beware of size."
3.0,Is a cute little pin.. but I have to say the colored dots leave a little to be desired.. they are kind of &#34;fake&#34; looking and actually make the cat look like it has a disease...
3.0,Cute top but not white. More of a light cream.
3.0,"This is a great looking shirt, BUT it's too short for me, and the material is a bit scratchy.  I'm tall, but usually don't have issues with shirts that are too short."
3.0,"These are super comfortable, but they really don't last all that long. Several months of wear and wash cycles later and the lining is starting to fray and come loose. I suspect that they will still be usable for a at least another winter, but anything more than that and they might just come apart. They are great if you are not really walking around on them. If I had to get another one, I would look for one with a hard sole/bottom so that it would last longer when using them around the house. Snoozies served their purpose, but they don't do it particularly well."
3.0,"I purchased this suit 7 months ago for water aerobics and lap swimming one or two times a week. I'm 5'6&#34;, 230lbs and ordered a size up; XXXL. I should have ordered the XXL as of found this suit a bit big. It is easy to get on and off and I've experienced no chafing with it. The fabric picks easily if you come into contact with the side of the pool. It's also faded in a weird way, likely due to the highly chlorinated pool where I swim. After about 4 months, I began having issues with the modesty pads in the bra. They would easily bunch up and fold over. Now it's like someone swaddled them up and threw them in the bra. Flattening them back out each time I go to put it on takes about all the patience I have and I just bought it's replacement (speedo) for $28 at a local big box store. Overall, not bad for $20, but spend a few extra bucks and get a better suit."
3.0,Cheap & thin material. Its not going to last long at all. But the fit is sooo perfect & it looks great so I kept it.
3.0,"they came in a bag ,not a box and were hard and out of shape."
3.0,Not compression but still cute. Theatreial is too thin to compress anything
3.0,"This just didn't fit right on me, like I wasn't human or this top wasn't built for humans. Honestly, ever proportion was just off. I loved the color, hated sending it back."
3.0,"These are very cute and I love how you can adjust the width because I have super wide feet, but... they do not have arch support as promised. Also, the little rubber nubby things on the sole are not comfortable. They're tolerable for a short time, but not for wearing at work all day!"
3.0,Cute bracelet but when it arrived it had oil all over it and smelled horrible.
3.0,The dress was real noce but fitted a bit snugg. The cover up did not fit. The arms part was to small for my arms.
3.0,"I bought this in March 27, 2017! it's Aug 18, 2018 now. Its been a great belt! I always carry my push dagger with me along with other tools. It just now lost the magnet and fell some where. Most of my belts usually only last 8months or so. It's been 1.5years... Impressive!...<br /><br />Why only 3 stars?<br />It gets loose every 2-3 hours. Sooner if I sit and stand up more often. I do automotive work and it's a small battle always adjusting it. But, I still like it."
3.0,The pants are made of a cheap costume stretchy material. They are also HUGE. The top is nice. It’s jersey knit and fits just right.
3.0,Many of the larger stones had fallen out of their setting.  Hopefully I won't loose any stones during the event
3.0,"They fit as they should, but are see through. I have tattoos on my legs and you can easily see what they are through the pants. They are comfy and all but not something I feel comfy wearing out in public. I got black and coral colored."
3.0,"Very beautiful outfit. Really needed pockets, I had to get pockets sewed on."
3.0,both very pretty. moonstone was more see through and become my favorite pair. the amethyst I only got to wear once as one fell out in the shower and cracked when it landed on the tub floor
3.0,"Very cute but the color in the &#34;stem&#34; faded quickly, only after a couple of days of wearing it.<br /><br />It has made my belly button sore, but I hope it doesn't have anything to do with the ring itself."
3.0,Feels very cheaply madr
3.0,This shirt is bright peach - I mean BRIGHT -  in real life than the light color color in the picture.
3.0,"i didn't like this prodict at all. If you are looking for fashion, this is not that product. suited more for military use I guess."
3.0,"This is a cute set for the price! I’m 5’6 and 135 pounds and purchased a medium. The fit is good in most places and although the fabric is a bit thin, it’s very soft and comfortable! The color is also beautiful in person! If 30 dollars seems reasonable to you I’d definitely purchase!"
3.0,"It came in a very nice gift box.  My wrist is a 6, so the extra length of the bracelet hangs down.  I tried to wrap it around the strap, but it keeps coming off."
3.0,I ordered a xl  and my daughter who is a size six  fits them perfectly . I cannot fit them way to small
3.0,"Beautiful overall and great quality, however none of the standard earring backs fit. The earrings came off all day 😐"
3.0,This was soooo soft and cozy and I love the look but one of the seams what not sewn properly and there was a big hole!
3.0,"Bought these twice; the first time I received four small cabs that each had some decent but very ""hidden""/obscured flash.  The second time I also received four small stones, but only two of them had any flash at all, and even then they had very little to speak of.  The other two were completely plain with no flash at all.  For the price and the description of these cabs I was expecting A+ quality in every stone, but that was not the case."
3.0,They were bought according to the size chart but are way too big.
3.0,Little bigger than expected and I am short so I have to have it altered
3.0,Looks gold plated. Too yellow gold.
3.0,"The lenses are fine.  As advertised.  The frame is quite flimsy, especially the ear pieces and may bend or break easily."
3.0,"Made for a very tiny woman’s wrist, or for a child. Very nice watch."
3.0,"Received with a glass unattached on the side. Was disappointed, however, the seller sent a replacement swiftly. I am now happy with new pair. Which also form Duduma and I like this one better."
3.0,"It was too big! I ordered one about 6 months ago an xl and I loved it! But, it's starting to fall apart. The hooks are breaking. Maybe I'm wearing too often or it could just be the quality I wear it almost everyday for about 4-5 hours. It helps hide the baby belly I'm trying to get rid of. I loved the way it first fit when I bought it and that is why I bought another one this time black. But when in arrived I realized it was a 2xl and it was way too big. I had to return it and now I'm waiting for the right size that I originally ordered. Hopefully Amazon gets it right this time. So I do recommend this product just be aware it's not the greatest quality."
3.0,"I have owned a few Chantelle bras and usually love the fit and quality. The quality seemed up to par, but the cups on this model were too small, causing some spillage over the top. Had to return it."
3.0,The shirt fits good if you are just sitting or standing but feels very tight around the shoulders and bust when you bend. I'm on average a small/medium so I purchased a large after reading some reviews.
3.0,"I don't have very long eyelashes, but they touch the lenses.  In order to keep that from happening, I had to place the glasses further out on my nose.<br />They certainly are low cost, though.  Probably best for young small people."
3.0,"It is really cute. I do like it, but it is not well made. The seams are already starting to come apart after a couple months of light wear."
3.0,"Again, maybe it's just me.. I have 2 of these now, and I'm not sure if I know how to use them. Might just be me, I have a hard time fitting everything in. :/"
3.0,"I am long wasted. This bathing suit is great, however it rides up."
3.0,"It's a cute hat but, I was unaware that the back of hat is floppy with no support so basically it just lays on the back of your neck. It fits well and has vents made into it to keep your head from getting to hot."
3.0,Not painted well in the cut outs.
3.0,Runs very large!  I would size down two sizes at least.  Nice material and color. Comfy!
3.0,"It was cute for a quick outfor my daughter party .I’m a medium and I always size up for for jumpsuits and stuff just so I can kinda have the baggy look .This thing was super tight and uncomfortable , the jacket fits ok but I seriously don’t like the material … I wish I would’ve bought the juicy jumpsuit instead smh"
3.0,See through af... so get undergarments!
3.0,"This dress is kind of hard to explain. I usually wear a size small in dresses (5'2, 125lbs), but after reading other reviews I sized up to a large at the last minute. It fits okay, definitely really short! The slip underneath is much shorter too, so I'll probably end up wearing different slip under it. One of the arms is also much tighter than the other one, so that can get a little uncomfortable. All that being said it's really cute! I know it's probably a hit or miss based on the other reviews, but I say go ahead and order it if you really love it, you can always return it if it doesn't fit!"
3.0,Love the color; way too wide for a medium!
3.0,Pants fit great. The top ran small. Still worked for what I needed it for.
3.0,"I bought this blanket as part of a Christmas present. It’s a throw blanket. If I came across it on a store, I would t have payed more than $15 for it. For $35, I have to say I’m pretty disappointed in the quality. However, the person I am giving it to doesn’t know the price tag and I know will appreciate it anyway. If you’re looking for a nice throw blanket, this isn’t it. But if you just want something cute for the Nintendo lover in your life and price isn’t an obstacle, go for it."
3.0,"Loved the bra, the push-up and the fit. The back of the bra was weird, and stuck out around the racerback tanks I was trying to wear it with. If it would have a normal racerback BACK I would give it 5 stars"
3.0,"Hi Delicol, I have been struggling with deciding which &#34;style&#34; to purchase. In each of the packs there are about 3 patterns that I like, but the others I am not happy with. Is there any way I can choose 3 from one pack and 3 from another to customize my order? Thanks!"
3.0,Smaller than expected. A gift for my daughter...  she likes it but will never wear it since the size doesn't match what she wanted.. if you buy this go one size bigger.
3.0,To big for my 4 year old. Hopefully. He will grow into them but they are much larger than other brands we bought in the same size
3.0,The glasses are really nice.... But the photochromic lenses are at best a gimmick. I don't notice ANY difference.
3.0,"Honestly i didn't like it as much when i got it, the material is like a Halloween costume and not for casual wear, if you're looking for a casual wear this aint it chief, this for a costume or cosplay"
3.0,"It was a semi good collection, doesn’t stay on the shoes tho."
3.0,"I wish they were not so synthetic, the finishing is not so good"
3.0,it is okay.
3.0,Poor detail but the main characteristics are there and it look decent for the price paid.
3.0,"..... my shoes haven’t fallen off yet,so they are working."
3.0,Nothing wrong with it the gray looks like a cleaning lady outfit. returned product because of color
3.0,"The wife's review: Nice looking side purse that can fit my Google 7 Pro. The material is soft and it feels like actual leather. It has 4 inside card slots and a small pocket for change. It's a good inexpensive phone carrier for shopping, running errands, and doing things that requires your hands to be free. It's not an actual (garage) purse so it will not fit all the incidentals that women carry around. However it will alleviate the need to drag the garage everywhere which is exactly what I need. I received it today so I don't know about it's durability. I will definitely update if things change.<br /><br />Update:  the strap broke so it's now useless after 3 months"
3.0,Quite thin
3.0,Ordered an XL fit like a L. Runs small and shrinks some more when washed. Gave to son.
3.0,"Fit well, not made for warmth though"
3.0,"I got a size 4-6 since I am a thin person. I like the fit of these pants from the thighs up. Love having the pockets for stuff when I walk. The combo of cotton and spandex is comfortable. The only problem I have is that the legs from the knees on down are just too narrow and tight. I decided to keep them since I think they might stretch out with wearing, but I won't order another pair from the manufacturer."
3.0,"These are made of INCREDIBLY thin material, that’s also surprisingly rigid. They didn’t fall right for my body. It seems like they’re ideal for tall, pencil shapes. I’m 5’7, 125 lbs, and they were all sorts of awkward. Liked the design, though."
3.0,I really enjoy the ability to change out the lenses to accommodate varying outdoor light. The only problem is that the small size doesn't give you much visual coverage. The lack of coverage can be a bit distracting in peripheral vision during driving.<br /><br />The frames are very comfortable and lightweight; almost feels like you don't have any glasses on.
3.0,"Great dress but colors are not what picture looked like to me. Red stripe is dull, almost a brown and Blue stripe just about disappears into black, White stripe looks beige. Longer"
3.0,Unfortunate that they ran sooo small. I read about of the reviews and thought that based on sizes purchased that the XL would fit me. I'm a size 12 in normal everyday clothing. I could get them around my hips but there was no way that there was going to be any closing of the zipper.
3.0,"Gifted these, so I do not know anything about the fit"
3.0,"Chest really padded, didn't expect that much"
3.0,I have a larger bottom and smaller top. I ordered a large and the bottom fit but the top looks very baggy and strange. I like the idea of it but not sure I’m interested in alterations. Also the beige looks dull on my skin tone so maybe if I change the colour that would help.
3.0,It's pretty but you constantly have to clean your ear because it makes it turn green.
3.0,"I knew I'd be taking a risk in ordering something I couldn't try on in-store. I had read reviews about this being sheer, so that wasn't a surprise to me.<br />Not a fan of this style, but I should have known it wouldn't flatter my body type. I'm not fat, but I'm ""fluffy"" in certain areas, and I need to avoid blouses that are short in front and that accentuate my bust. (Unwise move, on my part.) This blouse just hung on me around my shoulders without much shape, and it really accentuated my bust and my belly. It's one that'll flatter someone with neither.  :("
3.0,Really big and I could see other peoples finger prints on them
3.0,"This would have been cute, but it was too small in the torso. The sleeves were very tight as well."
3.0,I don't like snap fronts.
3.0,We use these for quad riding. Good grip. Zippers broke though
3.0,My first purchase was this dress in black. I loved it so much that I decided to buy it in red - BIG MISTAKE! The dress I received yesterday is not red IT’S ORANGE - SO VERY ORANGE! I'm disappointed because I really wanted that dull red color for an upcoming event.
3.0,Very pretty just a little heavy
3.0,Was supposed to be here in three days but took two weeks. The watch works fine but I should have just gotten it locally.
3.0,Thought it would different material
3.0,I bought the Mondaynoon earrings in Tanzanite they are beautiful earrings however the metal hook is too thick and could not fit into the hole in my ear. I will give as a gift.
3.0,"Purchased these~I’m about 5’6 and 190lbs curvy. DD up top and wide hips. I felt they were incredibly difficult to put on. Had to do the wiggle to get them up. Then the tummy control was so tight that I couldn’t use them to lounge around or work out in as it felt more like cutting me in half around my belly button.<br /><br />Nope, these for are for more petite women. Not for me."
3.0,"The idea of the product is great, but if you don't have that great of a figure, you might look a bit bulky."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in a size large, when i Usually wear a size XL in dresses from Amazon because the description said Large=US 12-14. It was huge on me still! I'm not sure if maybe I got an item that was marked wrong, but these run very large if you decide to purchase!"
3.0,"I got these leggings for my 10-year-old daughter who wears leggings just about everyday.  She doesn't care for these leggings.  She said that they seem sturdy and well-made but they are long, tight and keep sliding down, even though we bought her usual size."
3.0,These are really cute stick on earrings.  The problem is they don't stay stuck.
3.0,It shows much lighter in the order photo.  The insignias are dull. You can't be 6ft away and see it.
3.0,"When I received the bag, it was ripped in the inside. Other than that, it was a good handbag."
3.0,Sleeves are too long .  Does not look like the picture. The fit is all wrong.  My old Lands End coat  fits properly.  This new one does not look as well on as the one I’ve had for years.
3.0,For inexpensive gloves the quality and finish is fine but these are HUGE on me. I have a large hand and take size large work gloves but these were still pretty big on me.
3.0,These are hard to buckle and not as soft as they appear. They had a weird smell of chemicals at first as well.
3.0,"Did not wear very long before it started to turn another color, fade and look bad.  Very cute necklace but needs something put on it to protect it."
3.0,"These pants are warm and soft, but they are about 3-4” too short. I am 5’4” 125lb and ordered a medium. They reach about 2” above the top of my high top shoes. They will be good to wear around the house with some tall socks this winter though."
3.0,"Nice quality, but my disappointment was that it is quite short; certainly shorter than pictured. Probably best for a woman 5'5&#34; or less,<br />and color was not true to the picture. It appeared blue online, but my product was teal green. :("
3.0,"The design is as shown in the image, but the size was a bit too large and so had to return it back. The return was hassle free, thanks for that."
3.0,"Ok. Screws bailed on me after six weeks. It’s tighter than you’d think too. At least, if you want the screws to stay in.<br /><br />It’s difficult to get specific cards in and out rather than all at once.<br /><br />Even though it’s smaller than previous wallets it feels worse in a back pocket. Of course, it’s much better in a front pocket than previous wallets."
3.0,Loses its color after 1 wash
3.0,"The delivery time was good. They are adorable and I like them but, I feel the pearl is a little to big. The pearl is also not a real pearl so you get what you pay for."
3.0,This dress really shows my fupa in an unflattering way. The bust has a snap to keep it in place but it seems unreliable and flimsy.
3.0,"I like them, but they are tiny-er than I expected. The backings are hard to get on. They are pretty though."
3.0,All I can said it's OK
3.0,"Such a cute shirt. I bought a 2X expecting it to be loose as I wear a large, and it’s very tight."
3.0,The quality of the lens leaves something to be desired.
3.0,"The straps wont stay hooked.  I even tried using pliers to pinch the hook closed but straps still pop off with much movement.  Other than the risk of the top falling down, the rest of the suit is great and what I was looking for."
3.0,Not crazy about it...But will wear it... Wasn't expensive...
3.0,"This is my third pair of woodies, this is the pair that depressed me. The metal part that bridges the separate lenses was uneven, very noticeably uneven. If they weren't these would by far be my favorite. They look so great, I wish it wasnt the way it was."
3.0,I was excited for these when I ordered them. When I got them I was pleased with the colors but the hollow ones are much thicker than the picture looks. I bought them for the hollow ones but ended up wearing the solid plugs for the time.
3.0,"BUYER BEWARE....thought very pretty...to look at. very cheap. plastic not metal and the earrings are both facing right....so looks odd...great for costume party, not for wearing any length of time..."
3.0,Soft and plush but too short for my ears more for little girl.
3.0,"This product had a small stain on the sleeve straight out of the package. I immediately saw it. I bought the dress in a light blue shade and the stain is brown-ish. I bought it to wear while I teach, it will do fine for that, kids will surely get something on it anyway. The fabric isn’t the most comfortable but it looks lovely."
3.0,"Un poco apretado, tuve que mandarlo a arreglar<br />Lavable y tela suave"
3.0,Nice pocketbook but I expected straps to be longer.
3.0,"Nice glasses, classic good shape, bamboo looks legit. But; tint is too light, would not recommend to drive. If you're someone who might use shades indoors then sure they're good, but to drive out in desert weather the tint is just too light."
3.0,"They're ok.  They dont' stay upright and I'm having to adjust them multiple times throughout the day.  If I'm not wearing them for long periords of time they're fine, otherwise I just get annoyed with them.  They look good, though!"
3.0,"Socks are a little too short, they have good compression though. They would be perfect if they reached my knee. I am an average height woman. 5'4&#34;"
3.0,This visor is good quality but is very heavy. I got such a headache I had to take it off and can not use it.
3.0,I wear a 34DD so the bandeau part did not hold any boob. I ended up taking off the strappy part and sewing it to a different bralette
3.0,The heart isn’t shaped like a heart. But it’s pretty.
3.0,"Very cheap looking, not sturdy at all but has a nice color."
3.0,"Muy bien en tiempo, funcionalidad y aspecto. De uno de los lentes el brazo se despegó fácilmente desde el cristal, tengo otros pares hace dos años y sin problemas."
3.0,"The product is very fragile. Be careful not to turn or push the metal connector into the backing piece too tightly or the back will snap in half. Other than that they look great. One of my earrings broke, but they sent me a replacement no questions asked."
3.0,"Awesome sunglasses- thank you. The glasses are cheap, but great. They come in a box, and individually wrapped in plastic. Unfortunately, only half of mine were wrapped. The ones that did not have plastic had scratches on the lenses- maybe half new and half used/returned? You get what you pay for- but I would order them again because the ones that weren't scratched are just fun!"
3.0,Nice looking socks but these were not normal ladies size. Fortunately I had a young girl I needed a gift for.
3.0,The skirt is beautiful not the size.
3.0,"I had high hopes for this one, esp because it looks so good on a variety of people in the reviews. However, on me it was just boxy. Technically it hid my flaws, but I had very little shape under it. It was a good length, and the waist band was comfortable. I ordered the sea green one, and something about the material and color reminded me of thin hospital scrubs. Perhaps in a different color and a smaller size, it would be more flattering. I'm 5'3&#34;, 36-33-43, and I bought a large."
3.0,"I ordered the ""grass green"" and on here it looks like a light kelly green, but in reality, it is neon green! that personally doesn't bother me, but an fyi if someone wants a more subdued color like the picture, it is a lot brighter in person.<br /><br />Pros: the fabric is light, soft, flowy, which is good for summer.  I ordered a small, my usual size, and it fit as expected.  The bodice is stretchy (no zipper).<br /><br />Cons: the fabric is kinda thin and cheap; I wouldn't wear this to a wedding. The slip underneath is not as long as the dress, so I'm afraid it would ride up or cling.  While the straps are adjustable, the little metal things that you use to adjust the straps are a bright silver metal- maybe I'm picky, but I don't like to see them; to me it screams ""cheap"".  I could not find a bra that would not show through- even with a strapless, you still see the band at the top of the dress- the way the top and armholes are cut, you see the band of the bra (I'm the type of person who doesn't feel comfortable without a bra). You can adjust the straps higher so the band of the bra is covered, but then the v-neck portion of the bodice is too high and it just looks weird.<br />Bottom line: I could probably make this work with some shapewear underneath and a cardigan over it, but I didn't feel it was worth the price for it.  For $10 I would have kept it, but the quality isn't there for something like this and I've bought stuff for a cheaper price that was better quality.  Too bad."
3.0,"Wife said, bottoms fit great but top was too small, shes a 40DD. Colors were vibrant. Arrived in a timely manner."
3.0,Not the material I expected but my fault for not reading description.  Still like. Little big for me
3.0,"they are nice, I like them only thing is they dulled kinda quick but still look fine."
3.0,Return it cause didn’t want a Xmas one
3.0,Has weirdly bulky sleeves.
3.0,"It was ok, when i tried to fluff the wig alot of the hair fell out ,other than that it was ok"
3.0,The top button can’t fix. The quality is not good
3.0,Very showy.  Not as long as it appears in photo.  Would give 5 stars but it came broken.  Used some E6000 to fix.  Hope it holds because I really like it.
3.0,"This wrap is pretty, but is a little ""stiffer"" than I had anticipated, making it harder to wear than I was expecting.  It does not hang nicely the way that it appears in the photo - it has more ""body"" to it.  It's also not very long.  Both of these facts combined make it a bit difficult to wear properly, so I kind of used it more as an accessory - carrying it along because it looked pretty with my dress! Hopefully it will ""loosen up"" a bit with use."
3.0,fits through the shoulders but very baggy through the torso
3.0,"Looked great, comfortable to wear on land. Purchased this strap for snorkeling, and the clasps fell off as soon as I got in the ocean."
3.0,"I am willing to pay higher prices for SmartWool products because I prefer their quality and type of wool. This jacket only has wool in the hood. The jacket is fine, but the description, I felt, made it seem like there would be more wool liner throughout. It really is a super thin wind/rain barrier that balls up tiny, so it has its uses. But wasn't what I was shopping for, so the lower stars is for a confusing description, and a high price that I don't find justifiable, even if it is a good product."
3.0,"Way too big. Like, it's put away and my daughter will have to age a couple yrs before she can wear it, too big. It's still really cute though and a nice feeling material. I have contemplated hemming it bc it wouldn't be that hard. Just too much effort. Fix the sizing chart. Stuff from China is usually way too small, so to get something was too big is mind = blown. If I know what I know now, I would've ordered a size 3t instead of the 4t that I did actually order."
3.0,I really liked it but I have worn it and washed it only one time.  Half of the bottom hem came out when it was washed.
3.0,"It was a very nice dress. It was short, and I'm 5'2, (I ordered an XL) but I am very curvy, i cant wear it alone i had to add some tight under it. . Over all good buy."
3.0,"The colors are great, but these are not made of cotton. Although that makes them lighter and thinner, they also don't absorb sweat the same way. I think these are more appropriate for something like a costume than, say, for hiking, which is why I bought them. I can't pin down what they're made of."
3.0,"I originally purchased with the purpose to be able to wear with my costume while at work this year (sugar skull), however I was disappointed in the quality. While the ear loops were adjustable, it didn't do much to stay comfortably on my face given that there was no wire over the nose. The print and material weren't much to speak of either given that it was easily caught in my mouth, and the design was a bit pixelated. I'm bummed."
3.0,VERY Small!!!!
3.0,Grew out of them quickly
3.0,"This is a cute shirt however, it's way bigger than expected. I wear a normally wear a medium and should have gotten a small.  It's also super long... it comes halfway down my thigh.  It's something you would want to wear with leggings and if you have any kind of pooch, it's gonna show."
3.0,Thought it was Cotton but its polyester. Not a fan of that but it does fit well. It will take a month to get here from china
3.0,"I'm 5'5"" 120lbs 32C-27-36.5 order size S it looked too big too long on me and the fabric is too heavy for the style. It's cute if you wanna look real conservative,  I'm looking for something cute and flattering."
3.0,it was nothing like the picture
3.0,"Nice shirt, but definitely runs small!"
3.0,"The dress is beautiful and has lovely movement when you twirl. It was a bit small for an XL, but that was somewhat expected based on the photo and the drastic narrowing of the waist--the very reason I decided to go up a size and bought the XL rather than L. The XL The chest area is a tiny bit too big as well. Ultimately, unless your body looks exactly like the photo, expect a less than perfect fit. However, it is excellent for my needs and I would definitely order from this company again."
3.0,These were too large in the smaller size was too small there is a big discrepancy between this size and the size below it
3.0,the &#34;waist&#34; elastic hits right underneath my chest and not near my waist as expected. It's still a beautiful dress but fits weird.
3.0,These had a more synthetic feel than expected and had sparkles- colors were not as rich as pictured- going back- shipping and returns were fast and easy
3.0,I was not impressed with these.
3.0,Smaller than expected but comfortable
3.0,"I’ve been looking for a good pair of lightweight joggers that you can dress up or dress down. These are not it. The fabric was not at all what I was expecting and could most closely be compared to a stretchy swimsuit fabric. Also, the insides of the front pockets totally bulge under the pant legs and are awkwardly visible. I sent these back."
3.0,Didn't like the quality and runs small.
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet, gave it 3 stars because it does not open as advertised"
3.0,I love these gauges but they are not accurate in size. I wish they were because they are all so pretty! They are like half a size smaller than a normal size gauge. Please be aware of this!
3.0,"I got this wallet on time and fell in love immediately. I love the handle that goes on the outside. I was able to keep a luggage lock on it just to protect myself. I never had a problem with it until I went to get the change out of the zipper pocket, and the zipper slid right off of the track with the pocket still being zipped closed. My dad had to break the zipper so that I could take out my wallet and chapstick. If it wasn't faulty, I would've given it 100/5 stars (if I could).  I returned it immediately without any problems.  I hope to find a very similar wallet soon, just without the broken zipper."
3.0,"Nice hoodie, built well.  Sizes run small and the neck hole is kinda tight."
3.0,"I bought these for my 3 year daughter who has cochlear implants. I really like the design, but I wish there were rubber or something on the inside of the headband, and possibly the loop for the device above the ear. The headband slides up and down her head a lot, I'm constantly putting it back in place, and the device slides up out of the lower loop occasionally as well if we are using one of our smaller batteries. Might be different with other brands, hers is Cochlear."
3.0,Smaller then I thought but good enough for the price
3.0,"Completely see through. Pattern isn't attractive. Once again, made in China = poor quality."
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful but i had to give it 3 stars because the pendant is  backwards, the horn is on the left instead of the right"
3.0,It wasn't what I excepted but my mom loved it.
3.0,XL fits like a large
3.0,"I purchased this Golden Snitch necklace for my 10 year old grand daughter, who is a huge Harry Potter fan. Upon opening it, I was not impressed. A plain gold ball with silver (not gold) bird wings on a silver chain. It really doesn't look like the Golden Snitch from the Harry Potter movies Because the wings are detached and separate from the ball, they don't stay in position. When I showed it to my grand daughter, she asked what it was. She didn't even recognize it for what it is suppose to be. She took it, but I doubt that she'll ever wear it. I purchased this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Length is not knee length almost to ankle
3.0,"The gloves did the job by keeping my hands somewhat warm in January while in Italy, but the material which allows me to operate buttons on my cell phone kept failing me... I had to constantly remove my glove to snap pictures or navigate through my phone. The tip was of a poor quality. 2 yrs ago I purchased a nice pair from Walmart, but my son had since destroyed them, and walmart has never carried another black pair.. so I tried this,  didn't work as planned."
3.0,Love this hat except the clasp to set the size of the hand won't stay closed after a couple of months.
3.0,"Bought this item as the official gift for the Bronze Anniversary.  It comes in a Zip-lock bag with the handy &quot;You Mean The World To Me&quot; printed on the accompanying card - so you don't have to write anything tying it in on your card.<br /><br />Sadly, also on the card is the Etsy address for the source. So, it is NOT gift-ready. You have to wrestle that dinky little Zip-lock open, which is one of those super-tight kind, make sure you don't break the bag if you still want to use it, get the card out, CUT the Etsy address off, and then get the card back in. In doing so, you tear the bag, so you may as well just find a box and give the bag up. I understand the desire to advertise but maybe they could just put their address ON the bag?<br /><br />The globe is considerably smaller than the ring, and is not three-dimensional (you can stick your thumb in the hollow in the back). It's cute, but the angle of the photo might be a little misleading.  My husband was not terribly impressed but he liked the sentiment."
3.0,"Giving this item three stars because my son loves the shape and color. Buuuut My son was also diagnosed with bilaterally retinoblastoma and had his eye removed we have to wear glasses to protect the other eye but he has 20/20 so he doesn’t need real glasses..... he wanted these but they came with the lenses out.<br />I thought no big deal we will pop them back in.... but that’s not the case, although I got them back in they continue to pop out.<br />I can’t keep fighting with them or I’m going to snap the frames or crack the lenses.<br />Back to looking shopping...."
3.0,"Gave to my mom for Christmas. I created a hard bottom to put inside to make it more sturdy, otherwise it’s a good bag."
3.0,Too small to use for much other then to whole sweater super close
3.0,Nice bag all in all. Straps are a little long tho.
3.0,It was too big for me
3.0,Shipping took way to long. Shirt did not come as vibrant as pictured. Shirt is short.
3.0,"Not the best quality, I will not buy clothes on amazon again, to many unknowns"
3.0,I like big sun glass but these are huge. I gave them to a friend.
3.0,The straps pop easily
3.0,"I really like the metal bit the ball sits on, but this is NOT medical grade silicone. This is foam or something. Ball is too big for my mouth (I have a tiny mouth, 1.5""), but I would've given this 4 or 5 stars if the ball wasn't.. whatever it is."
3.0,Unfortunately the hem started to unravel after just one wash.
3.0,Wish it had more outside pockets and different color zipper handles
3.0,Works well but needed a larger hook
3.0,Not a bad shirt but order 1 size up. My boyfriend wears an extra large so that’s what I ordered and it fits him more like a shmedium. Pretty disappointed.
3.0,This is not truly a front closure bra. The zipper doesn’t go through band around the bottom... you still have to pull this over your head. This simply isn’t what I was looking for or what I expected. I’ll be returning it. Otherwise it does fit once wrestled over your head.  I’m just disappointed that it’s not a true full front closure as I expected :-/
3.0,I thought it was a dry fit type of hoodie. It is like a regular sweatshirt.
3.0,Shorts were good material but fit way smaller than expected.
3.0,It fit fine but the material is a little thin.
3.0,"I bought this Jacket in Large as I usually wear Large for Polo Shirts, I am 5 feet 9 inches 180 pounds. Should have bought the Medium instead. Definitely should size down by 1 size."
3.0,The fit is way too baggy.
3.0,"They are very cute, but one came without the magnetic on the back. I need to see how can I fix it. i will order another set from a different vender."
3.0,"Cute bracelet, but it’s a little lower quality than I expected."
3.0,"Nice sweater but I was looking for a pure white color. This is more winter white, cream colored."
3.0,They are better for night time then sunny days.at least for me.
3.0,These looked great when they arrived. They were just the right size for my wrists. However after a few weeks of wearing the discoloration started. It looks like whatever coating was on the surface started wearing off so that was kind of disappointing.
3.0,Solamente recibí 90 de 110 que supuestamente contiene el paquete
3.0,"I am 5'10&#34; so it's difficult to find a one piece that is long enough, this was long in the front with lots of extra material for the &#34;skirt&#34; and the shorts let about 1&#34; of cheek show, not exactly the look I was going for.  I ordered according to size chart and the suit in the bust was HUGE (I'm a 36C) overall just sack like. I'm returning, but you may have better luck.  Just my psa for the tall girls."
3.0,The t shirt was to small I wanted a 1x. I like the color of it
3.0,I am not that much satisfied with it. It is thin and short like a crop shirt
3.0,This item was very small so I donated it. The company was very good to refund my money.
3.0,"I love the design on this shirt but the quality of the material is very poor. The fit is also not the greatest, as it is long but tight in the midsection. I compared this to another shirt I recently bought from a different seller and there is no comparison. For what I paid for this shirt, I expected much, much better."
3.0,Great shoe. No arch support at all. Had to use memory foam supports.  Cute shoe tho. Good material. Non slippery.
3.0,"The turquoise looks unmistakably artificial. The earring are a good size for my small ears and not too heavy, though heavy enough that I can't wait to get them off at the end of my work day."
3.0,I bought this for my 6 year olds birthday and the chain is huge. Goes down to my stomach on me so I had to find another chain. But cute for a little girl. Tacky if it was for a grown up.
3.0,tarnishishes after extended use and are a bitch to put in
3.0,Color is more of a brownish red with a slight plum tint.
3.0,No battery included ☹️
3.0,They are cute and we did make the arms match other socks.  But the arms did not match the supposed leg colors.  Orange and black arms with red and black sock.  Blue was off color as well.
3.0,Standard insert.
3.0,"The quality of the jeans seem pretty good but I followed other suggestions to order a size up and the jeans were too big. I'm 5'1 about 116lbs, i normally get 25-26 jeans but ordered size 3 and they are definitely on the baggy side. I'm not skin and bones either, i have a some muscle and bubble butt. the ankle part was kind of weird too. but i'm thinking i can make them work with an outfit or two so i kept them."
3.0,It’s going to be a girl for my grandson for xmas
3.0,didn't fit had to give it away
3.0,The color is not the same as the picture.
3.0,Pants are warm but ride up above the ankles like capris.  Need to wear long sock to cover exposed skin.
3.0,"I like the design, but the shoe was broken in three weeks."
3.0,"looks bit cheap.... synthetic material...not soft....colors are not subtle as they seem in the picture.<br />keeping it for now but would not recommend.<br />if they made the same one in cotton, it would look lot classy."
3.0,Nice a little big
3.0,"I got it and they did not look near what I thought they would, overall disappointed."
3.0,These are very pretty but too big for my ears.
3.0,Cards are difficult to take out from most compartments. They stay stucked in
3.0,The necklace is much thinner than I anticipated.  It's very pretty but too delicate to wear very often.
3.0,Loved the product just too small & was short set not capri set as shows in pic so sent back.
3.0,"Gave them to my 6 year old.  They are also very flat, no contour."
3.0,"warm!! I have feet that are almost always cold and as long as my feet are not freezing from the get go these are great. Better quality than expected. The sole is ok to be outside in- I only got the mail. The sole also is flexible so its not too heavy. I got the med which is 6-7 and are a bit big, ALL my shoes are a 6- 61/2. Im using an insole insert and it helps. UPDATE. HAVE HAD ABOUT 3 MONTHS, STRETCHED TO THE POINT THEY DO NOT STAY ON MY FEET ANYMORE. THE LINING IS FLAT. OK FOR A SHORT TIME NOT LONG TERM."
3.0,"I was excited to find swim shorts in a size small.  They fit loosely (I am a size 2 and ordered small) but there is a waist draw string to tighten around the waist. So I like that.  I like the material, the lightness in weight and how they feel on.<br />However..... I had to return these shorts because the material on one of the legs was longer than the other, by about 1/2 an inch.  I put them in thinking maybe it wasn't noticeable but right away my husband asked me why one side looked a little shorter than the other."
3.0,"These do run a little small, which I’m glad I sized up since thongs tend to run small. The fabric is VERY thin to the point where you can see through them without trying. I haven’t decided if that’s a good thing or not, since it does make it feel more breathable. The fabric does have a decent ratio between stretch and hold. But, I mostly dislike that the lining is so thin. It’s like a dryer sheet has been glued to the lining-area."
3.0,"Cute for a night out. Not practical for every day. Too small.  Keys, small wallet and small phone is all it can hold. Comes with a little card holder."
3.0,Feels very inexpensive.
3.0,"This is a gift for a young girl.  New trip to Texas and Wyoming next month, so this will replace the backpacks and borrowed luggage.  She is growing up and needs her own luggage."
3.0,It wasn’t the exact color in the picture. More of a brighter orange. But it still is a cute color
3.0,I love the hat but the back netting is made with a flemsy net like material that has no structure and  doesn't compliment the front portion of the hat. I would pass on this one.
3.0,"Updated on 5/23 - The seller saw my original review. They contacted me and sent a replacement strap. It arrived in a few days, very nicely packaged. I've raised my rating as a result. I'm still not deeply in love love with the bag, but it's a fine grab and go and I am very impressed with the seller's response.<br /><br />Original Review -<br />It was fine (not great or luxurious, but fine) for the first two months and then the main clasp holding the shoulder strap in place, broke. I'm still wearing it clipped to the wristlet hook, until I find a nice replacement, but the broken part is exposed and I'm afraid of getting cut."
3.0,This was true to size but washed horribly.
3.0,"Very tight head circumference, I bought it on sale for next year because it said for toddler ages however it's too small for my 8 month old now. It is pretty and will be cute for baby pictures if anyone wants it for something like that. I may just cut a thread to fit for pictures next time."
3.0,The shorts fit good but the shirt seems to be odd. The shoulder part was in the middle of my arm no matter how I put it on. I keep it because it was only $6 but other than that they need to resew the shirts for these outfits. Shorts fit fine.
3.0,"These were for my granddaughters birthday, who loves everything unicorn. So I wanted to make sure I purchased the right size. Based on the size chart I ordered a EU size 27 which corresponded with a size 10 US. The box they came in said they were EU size 27 but US size was 11.5. Needless to say they are to big. For the high price paid I would think the size chart would be correct!"
3.0,Can't wear them. Too sheer. Better as tights.
3.0,The rings are cute and good quality but the gold is a cheap orange color
3.0,"The hat came all folded up and I'm trying to figure out how to get the fold marks out of it so it sits on my head right.  It is rather larger and sits down on the head which constricts view a bit.  I ordered the red but when it arrived it appeared more orangish-red.  Overall, if I can get the hat brim flattened out, it seems like a decent hat for sitting around at the beach."
3.0,"Rubs my armpit and causes discomfort, otherwise ok"
3.0,This is too short for me and im 6.1
3.0,Just okay. Fabric seemed a bit cheap and it was not flattering on me.
3.0,very thin and not as large as i thought they would be
3.0,"The first one I purchased broke before it could be worn. It was exactly what I needed for my costume,just wish the halo was a little more sturdy."
3.0,"The lenses are great but the frame was already bent and not even.  I placed it on the counter and realized that it laid unevenly.  Both right side up or upside down it was uneven.  Basically very cool lenses and cheap frame.  I have a heat-gun, which I used on the frame for about 10-15 seconds that fixed the problem.  I shouldn't have to use a heat-gun to fix these sunglasses.  Now they are fine."
3.0,They were too tight and constricting. I got the black and red pants.
3.0,"Ordered a large and should have ordered a medium! I have small chest (36D), for that type of dress so it didn't feel it out. I can say any married couples this would be something nice for the bedroom. 🤷🏾‍♀️"
3.0,These look great but feels extremely cheap. I hope they last.
3.0,"These are beautiful earrings, my daughter loves them and wants to wear them all the time. My only complaint is that they get caught in her long curly hair and I either have to rip or cut her hair out of them. She can only wear them when her hair is up."
3.0,"Material on inside of the top sheds off, this was before first washing."
3.0,I like the look and feel of the watch band. I do not like that the metal watch band looses the finish so easily from the band touching the closure magnet.
3.0,Color is great.  Fabric is soft. Design is nice.  Very comfortable. Giving only 3 stars since the fabric is so thin that it is almost see through.  Was hoping to be able to wear this shirt out and about but not will only use it as an &#34;around the house&#34; shirt.  Fit is a bit small - so you might want to order one size up.
3.0,Some of the beads were missing the silver liner but the beads were nice colors
3.0,It fit on the small size.
3.0,I returned this because it was a little baggy. I am 5'6 and 130 pounds. It fit okay and I thought a medium would be right based on reviews but it wasn't very flattering. A small would have been better. I also wasn't crazy about the overall execution of the material and seams. It was cheap looking and doesn't weigh nearly as much as it appears to. Very light construction.
3.0,"The hoodie is nice and soft. The problem was it catch lint very easy and it's hard to remove. Also there was some stain in the back of the hoodie. Other than that, it's a decent hoodie"
3.0,"I was so excited to order this hoodie and get it here but I have to say I am sadly disappointed in it. I definitely would not call this a hoodie it is a sweatshirt at its best and not a warm one either. The fabric is super light and the almost like a quilted pattern. There is not hood, or strings, or pockets to really call it a hoodie at least when I think of a hoodie that is what I expect. The pattern is super cute as pictured it definitely how it looks so I was still happy to receive it. I went to try it on and I ordered an XL knowing that sizes over seas are definitely different than here in the US well my daughter wears  an adult small and it fits her so not even close to fitting me. So not only was this anchor shirt not a hoodie but they sizes are not even close in comparison. I am only giving it a three because it is cute and comfy the quality is nice had it been described how it really was but the description is poor and sizing even worse. It did ship a lot faster than stated. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest opinion."
3.0,"Good product, i like it"
3.0,Did not realize just how chunky this really was until it arrived.  It was not what I had hoped it would be.
3.0,"I was expecting the breast portion of this product to be a bit bigger. I'm a 36C and I felt like I had side boob , I found my self focusing a little to long in fixing the girls to look right 😅.  The material of the product is a black elastic, doesn't seem to bother at all.the breast is a sheer soft material, besides it being small is very comfy. The bottom portion fits as it should. On a side note, I would like to mention though I am 129lbs and I feel like my &#34;spillage&#34; looks funny so something to think about 😉. Well I shall put it to the test and see what the husband thinks! Any questions or comments please let me know ! 👍🏼"
3.0,"The bralettes fit as expected but were nothing special. The cut of the front seemed a little low like it would not hold my chest in if I did anything to rigorous in them, and I am not well endowed either."
3.0,This dress was tight around the waist so I returned it. Other than it is a nice dress but I will not reorder.
3.0,The panties are not stretchy at all and are almost too small for me while the bra hangs off my boobs because the push up padding is too large for a B sized breast to accommodate. The material is a bit scratchy too.
3.0,Fits small if your bigger chested. Size up.
3.0,"This isn’t really a bikini it doesn’t have any type of support, at least the top doesn’t it’s more of a hanging out at the pool or beach but it’s not made for actually getting in the water. Or if you going to take it off for topless tanning."
3.0,This dress was not what I expected. The dress fit me well and I would wear it as a cover for a bathing suit because the material is thin and in the right light you can see through it. The size chart was accurate I ordered a small. I'm 4' 11&#34; 140 pounds I went off what size pants I wear when I looked at the chart and it worked.
3.0,It’s super cute and I really like it but the sleeves are itchy. Hoping it goes away after I wash
3.0,The paper that it was packed with is stuck to the shirt. I was disappointed I've never had that happen before
3.0,"This is fairly cute dress, and it is hard to find cotton ones so I kept it. Also, my husband thinks it looks great. I think it looks ok. There is an odd cresent seam on the belly that is not my favorite. I like the length - short but not so short I feel innappropriate, and I like that I can wear anormal bra with it. I am 5'5"", 32DDD and usually a 6/8 and the Med fits well."
3.0,They're decent for the price but was disappointed with size. I may of missed it but I don't think the size was actually listed. They are quite small. Made a good random gift for a friend with a smaller head.
3.0,a bit cheaper looking than expected
3.0,I don’t like how it runs off After a few weeks of wearing.
3.0,"Bag is a little heavier than I'd like and too many straps.  I thought if I was carrying it as a backpack, the shoulder strap could be removed or tucked away but it doesn't.  Same when I'm carrying as a purse, the backpack straps are in the way."
3.0,The cross is beautiful. But the class on the chain broke the first day I wore it.
3.0,"This review is from my husband's perspective. I liked the look and quality of this watch as a regular watch, but I don't think an analog watch makes a good smart watch.  The only thing that I think might be useful is if you assign volume up and down buttons to the watch for your music.<br /><br />You get notifications via a vibration and that vibration is very faint, difficult to feel. Once you get a notification you need to quickly look at your watch to see what number the hand moves to and then remember what contact corresponds to that number. It is not very convenient.<br /><br />You can set alarms but these are set via the app and not the normal iPhone alarms, so now you need to have alarms in different places depending on if you want notification on your watch.<br /><br />The watch itself is of good quality and has a good look. The watch band was way too big, I needed to have some links removed. The clasp is nice, it has a push button to release it.  The instructions are lacking although there is plenty of information in the form of a FAQ on the fossil website.<br /><br />Good watch if you really like the design, and consider the smart watch features and added bonus."
3.0,Not the best of quality - will not stay up
3.0,"I like these alright, but they seriously look ridiculously cheap. I'm pretty disappointed. I feel like they should have cost $5 the way they look."
3.0,bar is shorter than i expected
3.0,They keep asking so I will review. The earrings themselves are good. Color is clear and size is as stated. The price is as good as you will find anywhere.<br />The problem is the earring backs. They twist off. One of mine is constantly coming off and I have lost it twice in a month. Luckily I have found it in my house but it is a serious flaw. I use these smaller studs as everyday wear and sleep in them. All day I am checking the backs to make sure they are still there. I replaced a smaller pair of screwback earrings I purchased at kmart  8 years ago which I never had to check the backs so I switched the backs and am less fearful I will lose an earring due to the design of the backs. They need to eliminate the double entry of the backs as well because it makes it very hard to align properly.
3.0,I would pay more for this design in a better quality fabric. It wears okay but sadly will not last. Cute color.
3.0,Not as nice as picture !
3.0,The dress itself is great but the sunset glow color is completely see through- completely! I’m going to reorder in another color because it is pretty. I’m 5’3 128lbs and the medium was a comfortable fit
3.0,It isn't what I thought it'll be. But it's OK!
3.0,"I only wore this once or twice.  The neck part is too close for me, like I'm being choked.  I ended up donating it."
3.0,"Too bulky. Didn't expect that, probably my own fault for not paying attention, high quality though."
3.0,"Just okay, the compression is not very strong.Might be okay for sports, although a little warm for summer. I just wanted more support. Would not recommend for those who require  real compression for medical reasons."
3.0,The item is very cute in person and not a bad quality material...However it runs small ( in length) and is VERY thin. I don’t think anyone would ever wear this as a dress like the models.
3.0,"Bought this for summer but the fabric is *very* heavy and not great for hot weather.  It also attracts all sorts of lint and pet hair that sticks to the fabric.<br /><br />Fit was okay tho. I'm 5'9"" 160 with short legs and a stout torso. (30"" inseam) crotch and waistband run a little high on me which was surprising since I am not long & tall. Sleeves are very baggy, buttons holes are way smaller than the buttons and had to be cut slightly."
3.0,Overall it is a very cute necklace. I was very excited when I saw this and found one of my daughters names.<br /><br />Unfortunately we were sent the wrong name and I’m not seeing an option to return this for the right name.<br /><br />Besides getting sent the wrong name the necklace itself is beautiful and well made.
3.0,"Comfortable but the size seems to be wrong. That may be a function of another country doing the sizing. I wear a 10 and a half, the slippers were to fit an 11-12 foot, but they are smaller than 11-12. My guess is they're about a 9."
3.0,"the outside its nice just as shown, but the inside where it holds the phone broke real easly"
3.0,"The neckline is way too low, might need to wear something underneath it. Its long enough to cover the back. I m 5f 7"" and ordered the small. Overall it's okay for casual."
3.0,"I like it, but is too big for me. I had to give it to someone else."
3.0,Nice product a little retro look.
3.0,"Pretty handsome bag, I like the design a lot but it fell apart within a year"
3.0,The sticking is already coming wowrt#tt&
3.0,Very thin material and came extremely wrinkled. Ok for the price
3.0,Fit was great for my pup but I didn't like the faded purple. Looks cheap.
3.0,My wife loves her watch BUT it is NOt what I ordered. I ordered the watch in the picture with the date and have received the identical watch WITHOUT a date. I cannot return it without incurring a very large postage cost. So am very dissatisfied. I have bought several Timex watches but will not buy any more.<br />ALSO it had a flat battery so I had the take it to the watch shop and have the battery replaced.
3.0,"it took me more time to cut and sew it to fit me, it was long and wide for me."
3.0,"Too tight unfortunately as the design is cute. I am a 40DDD/F cup and I was exploding out of the top. The bottoms were better, but a little tight around the legs."
3.0,"not bad. good fabric and quality, just that they cut into my thighs a bit. really cute otherwise"
3.0,These are just ok.  Looks and feels very cheap.  They also run somewhat small there ok I guess for the price but I wouldn’t buy again
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; 130lbs 34b and a medium was too small. I think they are tight, hot, and constantly riding up."
3.0,The leggings just arrived so I haven't  had a chance to wear then yet. A few of the colors are weird offerings but most of them are just what I need.
3.0,The rings are hard to get to close if you can not see them and don’t stay closed. I’ve lost a couple of them already because they fall out
3.0,Way bigger then I thought they were.  Just go big for me. But nice
3.0,"Very heavy, feels high quality, paint on the metal comes off within a week."
3.0,"I purchased these for my Husband for Christmas, they were and XL, he couldn't even get his hand in them. On the other hand they fit me perfectly. Unless your man has small hands I would skip these. They are nice and comfy, the tag is written completely in Chinese so maybe they are an XL for a Chinese man."
3.0,"I'm a small person with a proportionate head, but all I can do is perch this on top.  It is that small.  The quality is nice for the price.  I will give it to a child."
3.0,you get what you pay for. fit fine but found some more expensive but well worth the money
3.0,"These socks are mostly good- they're soft, just the right fit, and don't start to itch like some socks do. However, they shrank when I washed them the first time- but only in one direction- the tops of the socks got shorter! They still fit my feet, but now come up to low-calf height instead of mid-calf, which makes them not great for wearing with taller boots."
3.0,My niece loved her outfit
3.0,I bought this as a gift for my husband.  The clear lid had become unglued.  I had to glue it back up.
3.0,Not quality at all but it is funny and gets the point across
3.0,Decent quality but very thin material.  Not sure how long this quality will last.
3.0,Muy bonito pero un poco caro.
3.0,Terry cloth head bands. Thinner than I expected.
3.0,Runs a little bit small and short In length.
3.0,Ok product get what you pay for not really what I expected!
3.0,Makes my boobs look so so huge
3.0,The faux bronze color comes across cheap and it didnt come with the backs to hold it onto your ear.
3.0,"Fits different, rises up a lot, have to keep adjusting shirt when wear"
3.0,Love the fit of it. Color is different than described tho. It’s more blue than purple. Not worth me wanting to return it and deal with that head ache tho.
3.0,Cute hat! Fits nice. Only thing was it smelt bad when I opened it. It smells like fish/auto shop smell. Tried letting it air out and also washing it. Still couldn’t get the smell out.
3.0,"The zipper busted before I even got a chance to wear it. Which is a shame, because it fit perfectly and looked amazing. Hopefully a tailor can fix the zipper and I can wear it."
3.0,Wand broke with first drop to the ground. Very low quality wand but the glasses are great!!
3.0,It is very small! I have it as a charm on my
3.0,The muscle picture is printer on one side of the sleeve and the rest of it is white. Approximately 60% of the sleeve is blank . I bought these and another set that were cosmic. The cosmic ones were complete pictures but the muscles were not
3.0,"I ordered XL based on the size chart expecting it to still be tight. I usually wear a medium in tops. They are loose, but could work for certain purposes. However, one of three long sleeve shirts is a short sleeve T-shirt and is gigantic. I will be returning. Good for the price if you get what is ordered and pick the right size."
3.0,Band received in one day fit is perfect
3.0,Everything on the pendent is perfect.<br />The chain is way to small an not very nice.But for the price nice peace I'm just going to buy a new larger chain.
3.0,Love the lace but the cut is small across the chest...I love the color
3.0,Only able to wear for a beach cover up but still very cute
3.0,Fit everywhere except in the arms broke my heart. I still have it because it is beautiful just buyer beware if you have large upper arms it wont fit.
3.0,"I waited too long to receive the coat and when it finally arrived I realized it's too small,  even though it says size L<br />There was no return slip or address. So I keep it but can't wear"
3.0,"No issues with it, the only complaint I have is that the light is not very good."
3.0,"A little large, larger than the jay bay. The quality at first seems very good, but when compared to jay bay, it's lacking. Not molded to a conforming shape, rather just a rubber plank"
3.0,"The bezels are fine, but 2 cabochons were broken when it arrived."
3.0,Chains are cute but the cross is very cheap.
3.0,"Adjustment Strap were very flimsy and the visor on the cap seem to be a little off angle. Bought the more expensive thinking I would get a better quality, But I should have just stuck with the less expensive."
3.0,Kept giving me wedgies. Really annoying. Too bad. They're so sexy. I gave most of them away except for my favorite colors for good times.
3.0,It's cute and just what I wanted but disappointed that one side of the chain was just loose in the bag. Again I have to go somewhere and have someone fix it. But other than that it's great. Perfect for Spring and Fiesta
3.0,These key chains were much smaller than I was expecting and very thin. The engraving is clear though but very tiny. If your looking for a cheap valentines day gift for a gamer these are okay.
3.0,"About a year ago I bought it in white and green, and I love it! I decided to buy it in black, and it's almost like it's not even the same fabric AT ALL.<br />Same cut and style, WAY DIFFERENT FABRIC. I don't love it."
3.0,Material was a little thin and the zipper broke😌 However it was a very cute jumper...I just didn't get to wear it.
3.0,"It is a pretty dress, but size it runs bigger. Plus, I reccomend it be for a tall person. I am 5'2 and it looked ridiculous on me due to the length. The material is very soft and nice though."
3.0,Earrings look nice. However the post are extremely to long.
3.0,Didn’t do anything for my pain and discomfort. They became annoying and hot to wear. They were doing nothing for me. I have RA and Fibromyalgia. Fast shipping
3.0,It a good quality shirt. Just runs small.
3.0,The width of neck is too wide. Good quality material.
3.0,This is a cute set but not exactly my taste when I received it.
3.0,"My daughter like the watch, but the band easily broke"
3.0,"After wearing for a week or maybe 2. The hat gets to loose and does not fit right any more.  I have bought this same exact hat in different colors ,but same size and they both start off a good snug fit . Then after a week ,maybe 2 it gets way to loose. Love the hat. Just wish it would stay true to size of fit"
3.0,Wasn’t the one we ordered but it worked for what I wanted it too
3.0,Muy pequeño es el reloj... no sirve para brazos muy grandes.
3.0,"I didn’t like the looks of them , and way too small .  I wear an 8 and they did not fit .  They fit my sister who wears a 7."
3.0,Broke down after a few wears and are basically blown out as a Result
3.0,Dress is little snug at the top but from waist down fit was ok material is heavy but at least not sheer
3.0,Quality of image on mask is not as crisp as I would have liked.
3.0,"Had to return these shoes. Just did not fit my foot well, but a beautiful shoe."
3.0,This dress struck my eye because of all the colors and it was just as pretty in person.  The material was soft and comfortable.  The drawback for me was right under the bust were a bunch of little pleats/darts that made the dress stand away from my waist.  I felt like others would have thought I was pregnant or gained weight. I did not like how I looked from the side.
3.0,Broke and had to reassemble
3.0,Was just alright. Nice for the price.
3.0,"Yes this is a best not a heated vest, in order to make a heated vest you must buy the power to supply, kind of like buying a phone that you can’t charge to use , the vest at best is very flimsy and not warm with out the power"
3.0,"Really cute, looks just like the picture. I get compliments on it a lot. But it's only for looks. It won't do anything to protect your phone."
3.0,"They're nice socks, but if your baby has chubby legs forget it - if you pull them all the way to the knees, the elastic cuts into the skin & cutes off circulation.  We use them but we fold them down to the ankles, which defeats the purpose.  We bought them because his pant legs always ride up when we pick him up, leaving bare skin on the legs, so we thought knee socks would be the answer.  The foot size is accurate, however."
3.0,"Honestly its ok .. First I thought the zipper and such were silver not gold because in the picture it shows silver and it came gold which I am not a fan of gold, and second on the strap it already started peeling off and I haven't even used it yet( just got it)... But it is a cute purse..."
3.0,Its snug fit but Im still going to wear it
3.0,"Really lovely gown and if there were petite or 'short gown' options from this manufacturer I'd be one of their devotees. The selections are so nice and in every sleep gown I've tried, the length has been a problem. How about a Petite or Short Length Ekouaer?"
3.0,Not worth the price. Either mines were used or a bad batch glue is everywhere there is a stain. I thought I was purchasing a good quality shoe. Not sure how I feel about them but not happy at all.
3.0,"A quite odd fitting undergarment, not terrible, but I won't buy again."
3.0,"Boots look awesome. Right out of the box. Love the doc Martin dupe. They have no support whatsoever. No problem - I added some great insoles. They fit correct to size, if u wear some thicker socks. But....omg, they scuff up so easy. Wore them 3 days now and they look like they are a half year old. Hopefully a suede brush and eraser can take out those scuffs, or else I'll dump them in trash after this winter. Haven't wore them in rainy weather. So not sure if they are waterproof. I really wanted to love them. They look pretty awesome minus the scuff marks.<br /><br />Update: yes, they are waterproof. Which is very nice"
3.0,Intirely too tight.
3.0,"I love them, just a little snug other than that great product"
3.0,A little too big for me. Don’t like the material.
3.0,"Great colors, but made of cheap materials"
3.0,"the pictureit looks like its not even sheer, the material that its actually made out of is SHEER, bear that in mind upon purhase. Other than that its not bad i guess, nothing special. Could have gotten something in the store better..."
3.0,I was in love with this top wearing it the first time. I love that I have fin material and fit perfectly with my leggings. Very upset and disappointed that the first time I washed this it shrank to a small child sized top. I did not Dry this in the dryer I only washed it in the washer. Not sure why it shriveled the way that it did. I am not a fan of clothes that I have to hang up especially for tops like this . But I did it anyway. Upon receiving the product review code my code did not work seller is extremely responsive and very friendly. They also fixed the issue immediately. again I love the top the first time I wore it. Maybe I should have hand washed it ? But now I'm upset that I can no longer use this top. maybe this was user error? Or maybe because of the material? But again I cannot use tops that have the risk like this.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased opinion. Please note that though this did not work out for me the way I would've liked it does not mean that it will not work out for you. Just wash with caution when washing this item.
3.0,"Love the ring... But I ordered a size that normally fits in a regular ring, but unfortunately is way too small in the silicone. Wish they came in half sizes!"
3.0,Chain was too long. More of a chain for adult
3.0,Mayerial is way tpo thin for the price!
3.0,"Got the medium and it fits great. The elastic bands (the white and red part) at the ends of the shorts and sleeves bothered my skin at first. It was itchy so I folded the material backward for relief (as seen in photos). Everything was fine after that. Haven't washed yet, but maybe that will help."
3.0,Bottoms fir percect - top way too small.
3.0,Is what it is. Inexpensive and looks it. Great for kids/ teen
3.0,"Its cute for a gift for a child or to wear a few times but get another chain, mine broke the day i got it. Good price though!"
3.0,i thought this was like copper fit its not its a knock off
3.0,1x ordering bamboo rayon.. Material thin but soft. Haven't worn out yet but tried on & definitely be an undershirt for me. Maybe since I'm a bigger girl that its not as long as I would like. Does roll up.
3.0,"Slightly baggy loose fit. Material is OK but the color is way off, not really close to what my screen shows. Returned item for a different color and size."
3.0,"I like the quality of the ring, and it fits well. However, the face is so small that, to me, it looks more like a gecko than a cat. The ears are barely noticeable. It's is still a cute little ring though."
3.0,The glasses i received were green and not pink as shown in the picture
3.0,"These earrings are adorable, but the backings are way too loose and fall off, so I've had to use different backings which seems like a waste."
3.0,Basic belly rings
3.0,"Nice enough belt for the price, however they 'grey' color is definitely beige, as I now see was noted by another reviewer. I was looking for a grey belt, so will likely return this."
3.0,"The design and material of this scarf are all good, fit different season, super lightweight. But the knit style is too strange to hold the scarf even to the next month. With only two layers of threads knit together, it must be super lightweight. But without lock (I don’t how to say it in knitting) at the end, the threads are keeping coming out. I’m afraid the scarf would finally all tear apart. And I don’t wanna take the risks of threads on my coat or threads twining around my neck.<br />Unless you know how to knit, otherwise not recommend this scarf."
3.0,"Watch is fine, but smaller than I expected and screen difficult for me to read."
3.0,It’s pretty but runs big. I ordered a small and it was loose on me and I usually wear a medium dress
3.0,It is very small in the part of the neck
3.0,The fit is quite tight and not really ample in the buttocks area.
3.0,"I’ve only had them for about two weeks their cheap, you get what you paid for but there very cute and stylish"
3.0,This is more like a 2x. Smaller than promised.
3.0,"Lovely pattern. Fabric is nice and flowy. But once again even a 2x is too small. It is my typical size from US retailers. I think these are products made overseas. They are very affordable, but I think the sizing is a bit off."
3.0,Cute but too small for my Ray Ban's and my Maui Jim's.
3.0,Weird material. Was hoping for soft cotton.
3.0,"even i got the size,its still a bit small hard to get a relative large key on it"
3.0,Not very sturdy we bought 9 pairs of these for our uniform and half of them tore the first night 1 pair tore when the girl was just putting them on.
3.0,mesh is bumpy
3.0,Shrank in the dryer
3.0,Fit ok. But there weren't enough holes to lace the corsets on sides. Returned
3.0,It's cute but a bit too tight in the chest area. Need to return.
3.0,"I found the size to be smaller than the isotoner gloves I had purchased in the past. I was very surprised by that. Otherwise, the gloves arrived in the original packaging and appear to be brand new as expected."
3.0,"Not as depicted in picture, very small pillbox hat. I would have paid more to get  Russian Style Warm Faux Fur Hat Cossack Hat Mongolian Hat, Cap."
3.0,The waist is very large but I just used a stirrup device and it seems to be ok.
3.0,"Received today, but one of the lanyards is missing the metal clip to attach to the mask."
3.0,Nice color and dress. But over 5'9 wont be a maxi. Dress ends before my ankles.
3.0,Didn't like the fabric and itdidn't fit me
3.0,"They appread a lot bigger in the picture, I should have read the size first.  But my daughter likes them and is wearing them."
3.0,"First of all, this dress is gorgeous.  It looks just like the picture.  My only complaint is the fabric is very thin so every lump and bump is visible.  I’m sure it would be fine with some good spanx."
3.0,The shirt is cute but way too small.  I had to send it back and order two sizes up.
3.0,just does not feel good on my head  sorry!!!
3.0,"I ordered my typical 34G and it was much to small. I loved the fabric and it would have been adorable if the cup wasn't so ridiculously small. Band size was fine. I should have exchanged it, but I didn't feel like messing with it. I returned it through Her Room on the phone and it was very easy and they were very helpful."
3.0,"Waiste and legs fits great, inseam extremely short."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but because of my arms I couldn't keep it."
3.0,"My second pair just broke after barely lasting 4months. Similar timeline as the first pair and they broke the exact same way. For some reason the left hinge comes loose without warning and before I know there’s a problem, the screw is missing. Won’t be ordering a thirst pair even though I loved everything else about them."
3.0,Would have given a 4 but didn't get all my color.
3.0,"Though the chest was just fine, the arms and shorts were too small. The fabric was soft, but thin so I'm not sure how durable it will be with many uses."
3.0,The tapered gauges are more of a green than a turquoise
3.0,Not at all what I expected or wanted.. glad I did not send it as a gift
3.0,This ring is much bigger than it looks. Pay attention to the measurements.
3.0,"Dress fit nicely. Zipper doesn’t work, have to have 2 sets of hands zipping you up"
3.0,These fit a little big. May want to size down. I expected there to be more distressed but looks like they were cut with scissors and would need to be washed and dried to fit well and have more loose thread
3.0,These get a 3 star review because the size is way off. Bought these for my husband in his size that he's worn for 50 of his 66 years and they're way too big! Very disappointed!
3.0,"I would say I love this, but the charms kept falling off, and then the chain broke, so I'm not able to wear it anymore until I buy a new chain.  Cheaply made in my opinion"
3.0,"I am 5’4 and wear size 6 pants (waist 28”). I ordered a size Large in these pants, but the elastic in the waist was too small for my waist, and hugging it too much. The fabric is comfy, but doesn’t breathe well because it’s cheap polyester fabric."
3.0,It's a nice dress for someone with a flat stomach.... ☹🙁☹not flattering at all on me.. after having two babies back to back I have a gut and this dress makes sure to show every roll. I don't think spanx can even help. The dress material is nice. Warm. Very stretchy. Not thin either.The hole to put your head through was pretty small and I don't even have that big of a head. I suggest you do your Makeup and hair after you put on the dress. I'm 5'5 and the dress can stretch Down right above my knee yoh can scrunch it up to make it shorter. Some one who has nice curves this dress is for you. If you have a gut I think the only way this would look nice is if you have wide hips and a nice butt. Unfortunately for me... after giving birth my top half of my body is wider then my lower half with no hips so I look sloppy in this dress... This dress gave me motivation to want to hit the gym after seeing my belly🙁☹🙁
3.0,"UPDATE: Customer service from this company is stellar! After posting the issues we had with the shoes, the company immediately reached out and offered me a free replacement pair or a full refund.  Products aren't always perfect so it means a lot when companies show that they understand this and that they appreciate their customers.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for these for my daughter for the summer at the beach and pool!  When we got them she put them on said they were comfortable but the very first time she wore them to the beach they gave her blisters on the back of heel that rubbed and then cut up the back of her heel so she can't wear them anymore.  And of course I missed the return window so now I'm stuck with a pair of water shoes that she'll never wear again :(  I'm very disappointed in these. There are much better ones for half the price."
3.0,Not that great quality but it was for a school play and did the job.
3.0,"Great silver sequin top!  Unfortunately, the sleeves were sewn very bunched together. It looks like the lining was sewn incorrectly on the sleeves to prevent them from laying flat. I will definitely keep, but quality control on this one was lacking."
3.0,"Cute leggings, but the waist is small."
3.0,The earnings were very nice and I was happy with the size and quality. Unfortunately the second time I wore them the pearl came out of the setting and I now have a broken earring.
3.0,I really like these...but strongly I left them in the sun one day and they &#34;shrunk&#34;...so weird. So after about the first week or so they became a bit short snd tight...odd.
3.0,Very soft but sleeves weren’t long enough for me. Not for a person with longer arms.
3.0,"I like the mask. I'm not sure about wearing it all day as it pulls slightly on my nose. That might be irritating all day. The other thing that I really don't like is that I can't tell what is on it. You can't read it once it's on and the deathly hollows symbol looks more like an arrow.<br />Other than that, I do really like the material and it feels very breathable."
3.0,I went by size chart and ordered a small expecting it to be loose by the size chart.I wear a XS Small. But ordered a small.Definitly can not put in dryer.Line dry only.Might return.
3.0,"Let me start this by saying that I love the PattyBoutik line. I had had my eye on this dress for a while, so I jumped on it when the price dropped. Taking the advice of a couple other reviewers, I ordered a size up from the sizing chart recommendation. I'm 5'6 and about 125 pounds, but my hips are a bit on the wider side. The medium fit well in the chest but was a little loose in the waist, but that was to be expected since I ordered a size up. My issue was that it was too tight across the rear end. This dress is nice, but it just wasn't made for someone with a bigger butt."
3.0,Not the best quality. Instead of Jedi master it looked more like karate master 🤦<br />I don't really recommend paying for this
3.0,My wife ordered this for a trip. The material started pulling and creating weird lines after wearing it once. Great for the value but you have to be so careful with it.
3.0,"The quality isnt too good, but it will do for awhile. I can't see it lasting too long. Material is very cheap, but it looks pretty good. I am a size 32a and it is already a little small on me. It looks pretty much like the picture, except not as great quality. Mehhhhhhh 👍👎."
3.0,I semi like the product. I have been looking for something to help me shapes things back while i still have access to breastfeed. I dont like that i have to remove the entire thing to use the restroom. I weigh about 135 and bought a medium.
3.0,It fit small. Looked like a giant blueberry! lol returning was easy
3.0,Beautiful but hurts the ear
3.0,Great little product. Only bad thing are the buttons. They’re plastic and one broke off the first wear.
3.0,"These are polyester blend, not cotton. Thin, but comfy Material. I would Not buy again."
3.0,"Nice keychain, made of plastic, not metal."
3.0,"I love the colors, I specifically order a large sine I had to return a medium foe been too tight. Large is not much bigger either, and I think and X-large would not look good either. So be aware it runs very small!!!!!!"
3.0,It's cute but its to small and i ordered a large maybe i should have gotten a xl
3.0,"It’s kinda a weird fit. I believe the ruffle/pleats in the back is suppose to go over your butt. But if you want it to , you have to pull it all the way up to your belly button. I’m 5’5 and 155 lbs. if you don’t pull it up, the ruffle looks weird in the back. Not super great, but keeping to run errands or pick up kids."
3.0,"It’s cute, but the one I got has the patterned part was sewn in tilted, so the quality is questionable. There’s no way I can give high stars for this reason."
3.0,"Love the material - thick enough that I wouldn't have to find a slip. Enjoy the style, length is perfect for me (5'3"") BUT<br /><br />The arm holes are too small for my comfort and somehow this V neck is most definitely not a V neck so I will be returning this."
3.0,it was just ok it looks cheap in person and some little short slip that doesn't fit is apart of the dress. Wouldn't purchase again
3.0,"broke of easily, had to take it to the jeweler for reapir"
3.0,Way too small. Not even uncomfortably tight. Couldn't connect the 2 velcro ends. And you have to pay for returns.
3.0,Like the mask but not for smaller kids 3 and 4 year old mask too big.
3.0,"I thought it was a really good piece, but I could not fit it.  It actually fit my 7 year old.  I thought it would be much bigger."
3.0,Great considering price.
3.0,wish the material was a little thicker but I like the style
3.0,No stretch.<br />I wear a consistent M on all yoga pants. Theses ones run small and do not have any stretch to them.
3.0,Good material. Weird smell coming out of the bag. Color yellow is more diarrhea yellow than the photo shows.
3.0,Descent quality really small fit.
3.0,This is not tan as pictured. It's off white. Disappointed.
3.0,They are way too small.  Order at least 2 sizes larger than you need.  (And don'y try to reason with the vendor!  They are ... un-reasonable)
3.0,They're good looking but they are way too small ... like if it's for kids!
3.0,Still cute and sexy even though runs small.
3.0,Earrings only came with 2 sets of poms. Unfortunately one set doesn't even match. It has one pink and one red. Earrings are also VERY heavy. Not sure if I'll be able to wear them:(
3.0,The “stone” is attractive but is light as a feather- so is the cord/ string that it hangs from. Needs more weight especially in the pendant to hang well
3.0,Reminds me of costume jewelry. It is huge takes up nearly my whole finger. The moderate looks genuine tho. Although it could be green glass who knows.
3.0,The only issue i have with this coat is the stitching/ lining inside of 1 of the side pockets was caught in the zipper tearing the fabric inside.
3.0,"Was pretty upset to see the plate isn't engraved, but printed. Otherwise, a solid belt."
3.0,Nice purse for the money.
3.0,"At 5’6” and 133 lbs they are too tight on the waistline. The quality is good, so if your a medium I’d say go large."
3.0,"Initially,  a great product. However, over time, the bracelets have stretched out. No longer tight to the wrist."
3.0,They are way to big.  They appeared to be much smaller in the picture.
3.0,Toes too pointed. Uncomfortable but really classy. Sorry I need to return them.
3.0,"LOVED them, until I noticed a hole in one of them, right out of the box. They got here in like, one day, too! So disappointing."
3.0,"Dress fit tight not loose as shown, material had no stretch"
3.0,No support therefore it does wear as pictured. Perhaps it would be closer to the picture if you have very perky boobs.
3.0,Nice but won't stay on my glasses as the little rubber thing is too loose. The green one broke the first day.
3.0,"Everything about the dress is exactly as pictured.  It even comes with a petticoat!  I didn’t realize it came with that.  The problem is with the shrug/jacket.  The one pictured has long sleeves.  The one I received has short sleeves.  Other than that, it would have been perfect.  My daughter needed a long-sleeved shrug."
3.0,"The material felt so nice and soft but I would definitely size down 2 sizes. I usually wear a large shirt (36DDD).  I ordered a medium thinking that it looked way too flowy, like maternity flowy, in the picture and I didn't want it to look like that on me.  The medium was still very very big. Maybe the small will fit. I am returning and trying the small. I think it would be a really cute swimsuit cover up. I will come back and update my review when I try the small."
3.0,Very thin material. I will need to add more layers. Patterns are nice
3.0,The picture is amazing but the product itself is rather cheap in person.
3.0,"Very cute, however is too small. I would order 2 sizes bigger"
3.0,Well made but is not true to size. Cost too much to send it back so I gave it away.
3.0,Not as dark as it looks on the picture. Not true to color. Fits well. True to size.
3.0,Top is one single piece- there isn’t a strap piece in front at bottom of bathing suit top
3.0,pretty sheer... I was hoping for something a little more supportive.
3.0,"These definitely run small. I would order a half of a size up. They are good shoes, but not super great quality. But for the money, I think they are worth it!"
3.0,"While I love the color and fit, the shirt wrinkles easily and is very noticeable."
3.0,Very compact and cute but flimsy and difficult to open and close.
3.0,Very nice sweater .just too large.
3.0,"The color on this item is beautiful, and it is soft, though not as soft as I was expecting. The major downfall to this item is that the sleeves were too short for me, landing about 3 inches above my wrist."
3.0,Runs large even after washing and wrinkles too fast.
3.0,I haven't noticed any difference using the glasses. There is a snap-on sun block option that I suppose will work out of doors.
3.0,Not very comfortable. Materials look good but it started to rub my skin and became uncomfortable.
3.0,Looks big but small very disappointed in product.
3.0,Nice slippers but too small :(
3.0,"I like the dress, the size was a bit of an issue. I typically wear a size large in dresses (if I were to get a dress from target or old navy, large always fits perfectly) so after reading mixed reviews about sizing, I went with a large. It came and it was too small. I ordered an XL and the dress that came was the same size as the L. I'm debating if I should try XXL or just give up..."
3.0,Material is tough feeling
3.0,Wanted to love this but the arms are shorter then expected.
3.0,"Very cute, but the sizing is wayyyy off. I ordered an xxl and it fit like a medium."
3.0,"This top was fine, the quality just seemed to be a little low. Not sure what I was expecting at this price point, but I sent it back. It felt like something I could have found on a sale rack at wet seal."
3.0,"I've got big feet, and I cannot lie.<br /><br />These socks aren't so high.<br />---<br /><br />The socks are fine but run smaller.  I'm guessing if you're an 11 or so, they'll be good.  A 11.5w or a 12 and they are a no go.<br /><br />I did have good luck with these:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Van-Heusen-Mens-Dress-Black/dp/B00I5K25KU/"
3.0,"Purchased for 12 yr old girl. Thought it would be longer since it was for an adult. Other than that, she absolutely loved it. Thx"
3.0,"It was good for my halloween costume. I was expecting it to be metal, but it seems lighter and coated with and odd substance."
3.0,"These gloves are OK. I shop quite a bit on Amazon and I rely a lot on reviews. So here goes.<br />I would love to be able to give these gloves 5 stars. But I just can't. I read the other reviews before I purchased them and found that many people said they ran very large and they ordered a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommended. So, I did the same thing. And they were STILL too big. I consider myself to be overweight so I was worried that my pudgy fingers would not fit if I ordered 2 sizes smaller than recommended. I would say to go 2 sizes smaller if you order them. Also, someone mentioned the abnormally long fingers.  They ARE abnormally long. I bought these as driving gloves for Wisconsin. I wanted warm gloves that would grip a cold, hard steering wheel in the winter. I would NOT consider them warm at all. And with the added problem of them being too large, they did nothing to keep my hands warm. I ended up buying a pair of Isotoner gloves to use as liners for these gloves. I wear the Isotoners most of the time and keep these in my pockets as an added layer of protection if I need it. They also have a terrible smell. I don't consider it a leather smell, but rather a fake leather smell trying to smell like leather. These gloves LOOK nice, but really were not the answer I was hoping for."
3.0,"I should have read the reviews. This IS false advertisement. The only reason I purchased these were for the plastic post. THEY ARE SUPER CUTE THOUGH!<br />Most of the earing came broken since they were not shipped in a sturdy box. I'm keeping them just because they were already broken off the cheap metal post, so I was able to glue them onto plastic posts myself."
3.0,Quality was very good but had to return it because it was too small. Get a 2 size up.
3.0,"The material is ok, a tad cheap feeling. I kind of feel like it's better for someone in her 60's.... Maybe the zipper is what does that for me. It looks ok on, just makes me feel old. Lol"
3.0,"I guess I sweat A LOT b/c it catches some sweat, but I still have to wipe my face frequently during work out."
3.0,Kind of bummed that the size chart on these isn't even close.
3.0,They are cute boots they just weren't right for me. The front flap hit at kind of a weird spot for me. I knew it would bug me and chafe so I sent them back. The toe is an almond shape; the pictures don't do the greatest job showing that.
3.0,"While I like this tshirt now, it took a bit of effort. I don't know if it was too much starch in the material, but this shirt was very odd-feeling, bordering on scratchy, when I received it. Took quite a bit of soaking in a salt/vinegar/baking soda solution, then washing it and drying it to get the material even close to being soft."
3.0,Cheap thin NO LIFT
3.0,This is a very cute suit except the top is not very supportive. The band under the chest is only in the front so there's just no support. I'm small chested so I can make it work but if you have a larger chest I can imagine this not working
3.0,For the price it is OK and usable but cheaper looking than I expected.
3.0,This was a gift for my adult son. Runs kinda small. No hoops for the belt
3.0,My son wanted these for him and his girlfriend.  Their cute but cheap. Didn’t last long. I think within a couple days the tiny eyes fell off.
3.0,"Loved the color, but it did. It complement my body."
3.0,"Pros: color<br /><br />Cons: bad fit, way too long, material is thin/cloth like<br /><br />Reference: 5”3’, 130, 34-28-36<br /><br />I bought a Medium but I was drowning in it. I would’ve liked a slimmer fit and shorter hem. It was a very relaxed fit.<br /><br />I’m returning this, not sure if I’d get a Small because I didn’t like the material all that much."
3.0,"I ordered a size larger than I normally wear<br />Thinking it would fit comfortably. No such luck, fits snug around the arms.  Had to Loosen it around the arm area. Ok for  costume use."
3.0,"it looks good, the material is very lightweight and shrank quite a bit after a cold water wash. Order at least one size up."
3.0,"Not very impressive, but just to wear every now and then it's  OK."
3.0,"The hat comes stuffed in a ziplock bag. Shipped in an envelope. It is very wrinkled. The wrinkles have not come out despite steaming and ironing. An OK hat, but it will not look crisp like the pictures. I suggest choosing something else."
3.0,"Decent belt, but far less supple than similar of better quality.  This one is pretty red for one billed as a darker brown.  Finish seems good.  The buckle is a dark silvered metal much like the color of Hematite.  The connection between buckle and belt is removable by a screw stud, which allows the buckle end to be taken apart and adjusted by cutting a short length from that end of the belt.  Drill a new hole for the stud, put the whole thing back together, and you've got yourself a shorter belt.  I guess that means err on the larger side if you're unsure what size to get.  I ordered a 38, and while it works fine, it's a couple of inches shorter than I'd expected."
3.0,Dress was pretty but material was thin.
3.0,"Cute, but sizing is incorrect.  I ordered my size according to chart, but it was 2 sizes too big."
3.0,This bag is really cute and roomy...but started falling apart on the interior seems after only a couple weeks use.
3.0,I was so excited for this purchase but it fell flat. It runs at least a size too big which sucks bc the material is very stretchy but also heavy so it looks very frumpy/saggy. It also came with a very obvious hole in the back so I’m returning.
3.0,The fit is very good.  I would purchase again
3.0,"I wear a size 8 in women’s shoes, these came in and they were adorable, I love them. I put them on and I could not believe how huge they were. I gave them to my husband and asked him to try it on because it was so big, my husband wears a size 10 shoe and it fit him! I would suggest if you were thinking of purchasing the slipper you get something about three sizes smaller than you require!"
3.0,My 7 years old is skinny and this tshirt was really big
3.0,"Got this in a 2x, another swimsuit from another company in a 1x. This was too tight while the other was a little loose. Same measurements used for both. Otherwise, looks just like picture, decent stitching, scared it'll shrink so haven't worn it yet. So happy I went a size up &#34;just in case&#34;"
3.0,"I am always looking for affordable fashion options and especially with designs that are hot now and won't be so hot later. Most times I make purchases with the idea I want the items to last, so I opt for classical styles and I must admit, my wardrobe starts to look kind of boring. Everything starts looking alike and the difference may be same cuts but in different colors or patterns.<br /><br />In comes Romwe, and they distribute both via their website and on Amazon. Buying clothes on-line can be iffy at times. You just don't know how sizing runs and certain production lines may run true to fit, while then you get a huge swing where items start then running large. Being that I was new to Romwe, I decided to play it safe and ordered one size up. Romwe differs where they list how their sizes run for each item, but I did notice where I may be a small in one version/style, I could easily jump to a medium in another style. Like with every female we run into issues where some shirts you just don't want to pop out of!<br /><br />I selected two items to review and now comes the Bohemian Shirt style dress in a blue toned fabric. Being that I have Prime on Amazon, I did not experience a delay in delivery. All items were in stock and shipped rather quickly. This is where I had a difficult time choosing a size that fir accordingly because of the dimensions listed.<br /><br />Sizing (as listed on Amazon):<br /><br />XS: Bust:31.5 inch, Length:32 inch,Sleeve Length:22.8 inch<br />S: Bust:32 inch, Length:32.5 inch,Sleeve Length:23 inch<br />M: Bust:33.5 inch, Length:33 inch,Sleeve Length:23.2 inch<br />L: Bust:35 inch, Length:33.5 inch,Sleeve Length:23.4 inch<br /><br />Retail Price Point: Via Amazon, the dress is $24.19 and free shipping if you have Prime membership.<br /><br />There is no waist or hip size! I looked at the dress on-line and noticed there was not a fabric listed, so I had no idea if the dress had give or not. I figured if the dress was too tight in the chest area, a tank top could fix that.  I opted on going with a size that is more true fit on the chest, thinking it would then flow a little loose on the waist and hips, as per the style (fitting) on the model. I went with a size Small. The dress gets here and I should have gone with an X-Small! The dress is very largely cut and the dimensions listed are not a true representation. I love the style but the cut (final piece) is not sewn or like the picture, and this is the one I had higher hopes on. I call it a tarp but my Husband calls it a frock. If you have a waist, it's all lost in the shirt. The dress has pockets, creating again that replication of bunching that I had with the first dress where it was sewn. There is no light flow to the fabric, as it is 100% polyester. This means no breathable feeling when worn. I'm short, so the arms were a perfect length but because there is elastic at the ends, my elastic band is still loose around the wrist. I attribute this to going a size up even though my chest/breast area is between a 33 and 34, this dress is lose there but the sewing on the shoulders......well, it was not done evenly. The shoulder area (seam) rests on the front of my shoulders, not on the shoulders themselves. Think collarbone. The dress is closed on the front by one stitch, which cause a gap if you move in it. I will be removing the stitch to stop this from happening and altering it so a tank top shows, but not so down that my undies show. This will also fix that forward like feeling of where the seams rest. My pockets sag because that is how much fabric gathers at the hips and waist. I think if we knew the model's size (height, dimensions and waist/hip sizing because mine looks like it belongs on a large versus a small). If I ordered an extra small and the seamstress was the same one......well, the seams issues would have been the same. I wanted to love this dress but I think mine was just cut way too big on the bottom to be able to enjoy it and it look flattering on me. One thing is a little baggy for comfort/casual and another thing is so baggy that I am swimming in it.  The reason for the extra star, I can fix this dress.  I have a sewing machine and will be altering it but this is not always an option for everyone.  I also noticed by the reviews, the sizing is all over where some reviewers found the dress to fitting and some to loose.  I again attribute this to maybe this design the sewing/fitting is all over the place.  Kind of how the sleeve states 3/4 length but on the model that is not the case.  My dress also does not rest shorter on the front and longer on the back, it's just the same all around.<br /><br />Romwe Promo Codes<br /><br />Save 15% each on Qualifying items offered by ROMWE Limited when you purchase 2 or more.

3.0,I thought it was leather but it was plastic. Looks good but I sweat in it.
3.0,I found them to be a little small - but then again being an XL - I possibly should have considered a size up against the light colour (if that makes sense)
3.0,"The band is good quality metal and very sturdy however, the color rubs off after a while. I purchased in February and put on the watch in March 2020 and now by November 2020 the band is discolored. Very disappointed."
3.0,The padded cups move around too easily and fall out every time I wash it. The cups are smaller.
3.0,Bad plastic
3.0,they're OK. but soles are very heavy and make a lot of noise
3.0,"Inside is very roomy but the opening is not very handy.  You ll need to pull down both zipper to open it up wide enough to get your stuff, or use the side zipper.  It looks cute but the fabric is not as thick as I expected."
3.0,Way smaller than the pictures.  But will keep it
3.0,"Very lightweight, has wide fit which is ideal for my, however, after wearing for a couple hours, the upper part of the boot created a hot spot on medial tibia. It turns out, the upper lining was poorly assembled, and rather than having a clean finish, the material was cut with scissors and not stitched properly. That in itself wouldnt have been a deal breaker, but the potential skin break that would develop is. As a former USArmy infantry officer, wearing boots is not a new thing. This is priced low proabably because of the poor quality control."
3.0,I am pear-shaped and the top portion seemed a bit bigger than the lower portion of the dress.  The puff of the sleeve was a little more exaggerated than expected.  I just need to have the puff of the sleeve and top portion of dress altered.  The fabric of the dress seemed to be of good quality.
3.0,Somewhat tight. Love the color & the way the shelves. The bottom is the tight part but its good. Thanks
3.0,Clasp digs in a little and itches
3.0,"It made me look huge, it doesn fit nice, the material is hard."
3.0,Got this for my company party...It is very nice
3.0,Not what I excepted..to thin..
3.0,"The quality of the hoodie is great! However, it is made very small. I ordered the 2x for my husband and it fit like a large. Very disappointed we now have to rush around to find a hoodie for the weekend."
3.0,"So I ordered these not because I needed to fix shoes but because I was feeling creative and wanted to make some flip flops. I went with the large size because the seller gave no dimensional details other then thickness, turns out I can make flip flops for big foot, they are each the length from my elbow to my finger tips and that is no short distance. The thing that most disappoints me is that they are a brown not any of the colors shown in the picture. I won't be returning them because I can deal with all of these &#34;issues&#34; but that doesn't mean I'm not a little disappointed."
3.0,I bought this shoes for my son.  He's starting to wear size 7 but this boots where not the actual size they mentioned.  Just a hint they will run small.
3.0,"Just like the scarf, every other thing on it doesn’t make sense to me. Not what am expecting to see."
3.0,"first impression was that it was thin and cheap. I wore it anyway and it works. bought a different on and it was too thick and made me sweat. good for keeping body temp regulated. it has loose strings occasionally that i have to cut off, but not as bad as it may sound."
3.0,"After all the reviews, I bought a size up. Wish I had bought my usual size. It was fine in the bust area. I'm a 34C. The waist seems high on the dress and it looks pleated instead of flowing. Very short dress. I'm sending the dress back."
3.0,Not what I thought but still good product
3.0,They are too wide they fall off
3.0,"The belt looks nice and isn't small. The material, though, is pretty stiff, and as a result the buckle can loosen unless there's a fair bit of tension on it, more than is comfortable for a belt. Also the buckle is quite large, so makes a big bump under your shirt."
3.0,Smaller then expected but will use again because I like the style
3.0,This dress fit fine and it might work better for someone with less curves than I have. It just looked cheap to me. I bought it for a fancy dinner out and when I tried it on I knew I couldn't walk into the nice restaurant I was headed to and look like I belonged. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"This shirt is way too small.  I followed the sizing chart and ordered my size based on that, and the shirt is skin tight on me and not loose and flowy like on the model.  I have passed the shirt down to my 11 step-daughter, and it fits her correctly so not all is lost, but she is still in girls sized clothing."
3.0,Warm.  Just very hard to get them on
3.0,Definitely a kids purse. Very long strap that needs cutting. Purse seems age appropriate to a 4-6 year old.
3.0,I do not consider this jacket to have a fleece lining.<br />It is very light weight.
3.0,It's not compatible with PANDORA BRACKET IT WAS ALWAYS UPSIDE DOWN  THE HOLES WERE TOO BIG OTHERWISE  REALLY CUTE
3.0,"I'm 5'7 170 36D and the large fit great. The jumpsuit is thick, execellent quality bandage material. It was long enough for someone my height. I sent it back because several of the grommets were falling off when it arrived. I wish the jumpsuit wasn't defective bc I really loved it and was looking forward to wearing it."
3.0,"Loved the look and wore for a couple months but  unfortunately it broke.  Have to question the quality.  Made me sad, I loved it."
3.0,For the price a great purchase and so cute. Small zipper crotch access makes diaper changes nearly impossible. Buy lager size than what you Normally do
3.0,Very cheap quality but you get what you pay for
3.0,"Ok I just got these, I have some already that I had lost but had them for like 2 yrs and nothing bad happen to them. I purchase this item a couple of days ago , got them and I didnt the backs to the ear rings.. smh.. no beuno. I should contact them shouldn't I<br />?"
3.0,They liked them
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:c6021664ef75f357a37b7488f8b9b2de]] Quality was great and worked awesome, but the mask design pushed on the nose and made it hard to wear."
3.0,This was way more short and snug then I thought
3.0,"Waist is fitted, and much smaller than the shoulders."
3.0,"I'm 5' 7 1/2&#34; tall, and it hits me higher than the picture shows, so its not something I can wear out comfortably all the time and have to be sure I do not bend much."
3.0,"Colors are nice.  Material is really soft and thin, so it doesn't hold moisture.  I don't consider it a compression garment. It's more like a thin racer tank made from poly. Arrived in a timely manner"
3.0,"I was really wanting to love these, but they came and while the prints were cute & the fabric was soft enough, they were extremely wide and large. My son is 22m old, fits most 24m clothes, is on the tall and skinny side. I could easily have fit two of him in one of these rompers at 13” wide and 19” from neck to bottom. Too bad, we were looking forward to having them as pjs."
3.0,I sent it back because I did not like the material.
3.0,"The chain portion of this necklace is rather cheap looking; however because not much of it would be shown (especially if worn with hair down), it could pass for a nice costume jewelry piece. The actual bib part with the hanging stones is very nice."
3.0,The lenses are a bit small.
3.0,Well suited for fashion but not function. Too thin for cold weather. Maybe on a boat or something . I have a box for a head and these do stretch enough to clear my skull.
3.0,The shirt is very shot in the torso
3.0,The gown is a nice soft light fabric. Theres pockets and the length is at ankles. It's very comfortable and price wasnt bad. Thought I ordered long sleeves but this one had short ones.
3.0,"The thigh highs were just my size when I wore them, but what bothered me the most was that it kept rolling down! I dont like how there's no garter or anything else to keep the tights from rolling. Maybe you just have to have really skinny legs to wear them."
3.0,"I ordered an extra large but this cami is not meant for someone with larger than average ta-tas. The fabric is nice and the upper portion of the cami is lined.  Unfortunately I wear a size 36J Elomi bra and this cami just does not have enough room for that.  The cut of the cami looks boxy, but due to it not fitting me correctly I can’t give much feedback on how it would fit someone smaller than me."
3.0,"I disliked the feel of the material, it has been washed several times but is still stiff. The lace is scratchy."
3.0,"My wife is 5'2"" 120 lbs and this dress, size small, was enormous on her.<br />I would not recommend this dress due to sizing issues."
3.0,It breaks really easily
3.0,This item does not look like the picture but I kept it to complete my bracelet...
3.0,This sweater is for someone young and not curvy.
3.0,"Based off if everyone else's reviews, I was pretty sure a small would fit me... but hell no! It was painful getting that dress on and off. I'll be returning it and probably getting a large. Im 5'5' and 134 pounds.<br />Other than the size situation... I really like the dress."
3.0,if is super thing and not squat proof. slides down  some and makes you sweaty
3.0,Nice product. A little large
3.0,"Although the shirt doesn't look bad,  it doesn't look like the picture either.  In the picture the shirt looks longer like a tunic.  The shirt I got is probably to my hips.  I will keep it because it isn't bad though."
3.0,The tag on the back is extremely irritating.
3.0,"Very pretty, comfy panties but the bra squeaks...I guess it’s the plastic rings that hold the strap? But it’s annoying and a bit uncomfortable."
3.0,"I’m 5’3” and 125 pounds. I wear size 4 pants and fit best in petite clothing. Based on reviews, I ordered a size Small, but when it arrived, it was WAY too tight! Additionally, the silhouette was not flattering on my short/petite frame. I returned it.<br /><br />Quality wise, it was thick, nice compression material. If you’re a size 4, order a medium."
3.0,"Comfy, but so thin like a nylon sock."
3.0,Well made but not my style after all!
3.0,"Pretty pleased overall. One downside, the fabric is extra thin and I noticed a small hole developing along the waisteband after only wearing them once or twice. For the price, I shouldn't be that surprised. Also, the product is made, and sized, in China. The tag on my mediums say XXX on them."
3.0,my head is not small but these are big and slide down
3.0,It is a basic shirt. The cut doesn't do the shoulders justice.
3.0,"Love these glass bottles.  No complaints they are beautiful to use for cleaning supplies etc. around the home. We purchased them 4 months ago for QTY 6 / 15.99, was going to buy them a 2nd time but decided against it.<br />Price went up almost 50%!  Now they cost 29.99 !"
3.0,I have been wearing it but its starting to tear apart
3.0,"This dress was super cute when I first pulled it out of the bag. I went to try it on and quickly realized that it was really tight in the arms and chest area. I usually wear an XL or 1X and figured this would be about the same fit based on other reviews. But it was much tighter and I wasn't even going to attempt to pull it on all the way. I also realized that the particular dress I got had some of the stitching already ripped in the front, as if someone else had already tried it on or was not finished being sewed. I think this would be a great dress for someone with a much smaller chest (I wear a DD cup). If they made this in possibly a 2X then I would buy again!"
3.0,"This sweatshirt is pretty much like most sweatshirts. It's only a 'little' too small when you try it on before it's washed, then after it's washed it's two sizes too small. I gave my new sweatshirt to someone that wears a medium and it's tight on them! Either buy one that's 2 sizes too big, or be smart and save your money."
3.0,"The pattern is cute however, it fits rather baggy around the chest area. If you want to wear a strapless bra with it the bra is all you can see. There is also not a front or back, until you realize the high slit. Its a cute dress but i have to wear a cardigan or jacket with it every time."
3.0,It fits well but the buckle is huge and it has nickelsmart.com all over it so if you're looking for a plain black nickel free belt this is not it.
3.0,The box my case came in was clearly taped shut multiple time...best guess 3. There were no instructions. Not sure if it was a battery for the USB port. It does not work. So im kind of stuck with just an ordinary little suitcase that doesnt set the world on fire. Underwhelmed. Rating is 3 starts cuz its just an ordinary little suitcase.
3.0,"These are okay looking, but I got a pair that looks like PJs. The butt pocket is way off to the side so it looks funny. I will wear them around the house but won't wear them out."
3.0,Drivers fell out sheet washing hands
3.0,"The actual product look less sophisticated than the photo. However, it is comfortable to wear it and the band does not discolor even in sweat. It would be better if the band was thinner."
3.0,The studs are flimsy as everybody else stated.<br />But the backs are cute and add a different dimension any other studs you may have.
3.0,"No stretch at all. Clasp is flimsy. Love the look, but am waiting for it to fall apart."
3.0,I have 15 1/2 “ upper arms. 1X sleeves were skin tight. The body is just right. 2X the sleeves are comfortable and the body is soupy.
3.0,Love this bracelet but it could be a little bit longer.
3.0,lock on larger bag arrived broken.  I was directed to get a screw driver and take lock off myself  company is supposed to send new lock which I need to install myself.  also the closures are flimsy.  I would not get this again
3.0,"Pants for lovely, the shirt was extremely tight on my bust area and I have A cup boobs. I really wish you could order the pants and shirt sizes differently. I wouldn't gotten a small in pants and Medium in shirt"
3.0,"Super cute but for wide feet/ overweight people who carry weight in their feet, these were too small. I wish they offered a size up but they max out at 10 which is a shame bc many Americans have larger feet than China/Japan or wherever they’re made."
3.0,"Fits fine, the material is nice, will be good for winter, disappointed its not cotton. Will be more careful in future.  The material in it burns me up, not 5 minutes of wear and I am burning up.  I have mistakenly bought a couple of these and I can not even wear them.  Cotton only from now on."
3.0,"I typically wear a size medium and got these in large. The waist and butt fit like a small, the legs and front stomach area fit like an extra large. I have no idea who this would fit, but they would need a tiny waist, no butt, and a large front pooch. As for length, they fit me like cropped pants (about 1 inch above my ankle) and I'm 5'2""  so not sure what height these were made for, but not really capris. The legs are wide and not very tapered so you look stout in them.<br /><br />The fabric felt meh, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything to write home about. Not much stretch, but the weight was nice."
3.0,I should of ordered down a size but that’s my fault.  I got the white dress to wear to our annual yacht club white party.  Thin and cheap material but you get what you pay for.  It’s not all that bad for the money.....I think I paid $13 so can’t complain
3.0,Nice color but it fits large and isn’t flattering.
3.0,"Beautif bracelet however I purchased this particular one because it said it fit down to 5""..it does not.  I have a very small wrist and its too big. I'll keep it and try to fabricate it somehow. Update: cant shorten so sadly will be returning it."
3.0,Seems like the reflective portions will wear out quickly if washed enough. Nice and warm though
3.0,"Love the print. Tank looks well made as far as stitching and durability of fabric.  Shipping was fast. The return was easy.  That's where the fun ends. The tank has absolutely no stretch to it at all. It's very rigid and was tight right across the nipple line but too big from there down. The cup area bulged around the borders in a very strange way. The straps are adjustable but did not help with the odd fit. For reference,  I'm 5'5"" 165 lbs and 36D.  I would say this tank likely will only work for women with size A, maybe B cup. Anything larger, no way."
3.0,I measured and remeasured and measured again but they still didn't fit !  Should have returned them but had surgery and by the time I got organized it was too late.  Just be prepared to have to return these if you use their measurements.
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 36C, 28 waist, 34 hips. Normally a size small-medium in tops. I looked at their size chart and decided on a medium, expecting a relaxed fit. These tops definitely run small. They are quite snug in the bust and slim fitting through the rest. Because the cap sleeves were a bit snug the shirt wasn’t very comfortable to wear during training. It’s fine enough, but with the top having a large opening meant for a more off the shoulder relaxed look I think it looks a bit off with a snug fit. I should have ordered another size up for a large for the fit I wanted. However, the length is good on these."
3.0,They look just like the picture but but they were smaller then expected
3.0,"These underwear are super comfortable and fit as expected. Out of the 4 pairs I bought , this one was full of holes on one of the legs. That was pretty disappointing."
3.0,Large hard to tell from the picture. Daughter loves it!
3.0,Were to small. I gave them to my 9 yr old daughter.  She loves them.
3.0,HUGE! !!!!!!! I got an XL and probably could have got a medium with plenty of room to spare.
3.0,"Very good looking shoe, but for narrow feet."
3.0,"For the price, this dress is perfect for wearing once or twice. The bodice is lined with cotton which is a nice surprise. I purchased size 6/7 for my very thin seven-year-old and it comes above her knee in the front and is not a train in the back. It comes mid calf and the back. Keep that in mind for average American sizes. I purchased a petticoat we can’t use because the dress is too short but haven’t left enough time for a different sized dress before her father daughter dance.  You will spend a significant amount of time steaming this dress.  It is a pretty royal purple with ecru underneath. The leaves around the flowers are gold and it is quite pretty. If you have a little girl that does not like bows tied up in the back, this simple ribbon isIs easily cut off."
3.0,Wish it was a tad bigger....
3.0,"These shorts are cute and of good quality, but I'm not keeping it.  I sit between a 10 and 12, and ordered a Medium skirt based on other reviews. It's too snug for my liking, so I'm returning it."
3.0,i like the colors... like the picture
3.0,Loved this ring but had for a month and two of the crystals have already fallen out:(
3.0,The first five minutes I had I tried to put it on my sprinkler and it was okay my pinky my middle finger but my index when I try to put it on the band snapped
3.0,"pretty flimsy, but fun to wear.  It looks cute from a distance, but I don't expect it to last too long."
3.0,The colors/pattern are not as nice in person as displayed in the pictures. It looks a lot cheaper in person.
3.0,Waistline on skirt was too big. You can see through the skirt. Product poorly made.
3.0,Fit somewhat weird. Small waist. Big legs
3.0,"The two spacer fabric bras I have tried, this one and the Fantasy Rebecca, did not provide the support or the coverage I expected. Spacer fabric is somewhat softer than other molded bras. I ended up with the Fantasy Zoe Contour. Actually bought two. It fits very well. But looking at it today, the cups are slightly too perky. I am a UK 36F."
3.0,They are alright. Searched the purpose but not much padding.
3.0,Excellent! It is lovely. Can wear with a lot of outfits.
3.0,tummy control feature is not there but fit is true to  size.
3.0,Too large for a NB.
3.0,could be of a better quality
3.0,Disappointed!!! Received broken!!!
3.0,Its very thin fabric. See thru
3.0,"Nice top but came w a little hole in it that I didnt see til after I cut tags off and ironed it. If you are busty, order a size up because that part runs small."
3.0,"I researched these wraps for a long time trying to make sure I found a soft cotton one that was comfy. Unfortunately, I chose this one. It's so big and the Velcro 8s not long enough so I can't wear. The straps are too short to wear comfortably as well. Also, I do not like the feel of microfiber because it feels weird on my skin. It is not a great product in my opinion."
3.0,undecided
3.0,Is a nice looking hat to wear at work. The only negative I have about it is that it's kind of shallow and sits high
3.0,"My husband has had some trouble with socks being too tight on his legs / ankles.  At first he didn't want to wear these No Show Socks because they were &#34;odd.&#34;  Finally I packed them for a cruise because they took less space.  He did wear them and said they were OK.  At home he is wearing some old, stretched -out athletic socks."
3.0,"My daughter wanted this watch for months, and finally got it about 2 months ago. After wearing it normally for this time, we discovered in the course of normal wear and tear that the screen has cracked. It no longer functions, as the crack modifies the touch screen usability.<br />It was $30 for a watch that had the durability to last 2 months for a 6 year old. Very disappointed"
3.0,the hand fell off after 1 week . Loved this purse looks and size and quality was very disappointing that hand fell off and other one is getting close. Got many compliments on this purse was going to order more colors.
3.0,Love the compression it helps me since I had breast masectomy surgery.  What I dislike is the bottom of the top rolls up .
3.0,didn't hold glasses on when I bent over which is the entire reason I bought them.
3.0,"These are cool looking sunglasses and work well for non-slip. However, they are quite heavy and cause red marks and pain if wearing for more than 10 minutes."
3.0,These were great sweats!...until the zipper broke.  Now the back pocket won't close and has a gaping hole.  Guess these are destined for the cat bed...
3.0,Not colors that were pictured
3.0,"I bought this shirt to workout in. It’s okay. I have a long torso, so it’s a little obnoxiously short to work out in. It does, however, make for a cozy shirt to bum around in.<br /><br />The differing fabrics on the sleeves was a little more grunge than Moulin Rouge for me, but again, it was okay."
3.0,I bought the wrong size😫
3.0,Lens popped out the same week. I feel I’m about to break them. Very fragile but stylish. The lenses are a beautiful light purple
3.0,The pink is almost peachy. Still pretty. I’m a 12 and I ordered the large. It fits well but shorter than expected. I washed it in cold water and air dried and it still shrank up a bit so I wouldn’t dry this.
3.0,"Cute, don't care for how bottom is, and necklace is junk. Necklace is made out of cheap plastic like how little girls' necklaces are."
3.0,Returned this item very quickly. Tried it on as soon as it came but it was way too big in the shoulders and waist and the fabric was just too wrinkly. Did not like don’t recommend
3.0,"size was wrong, the size needed for my neck size would on been a 3x of which would of swollowed me. tried the 16 1/2 neck size but it was too small overall not just neck"
3.0,"Material was too slippery for me; my foot slid around in my shoes (loafers, for example).  Otherwise, really liked the product.  Had to return, because it didn't work for me."
3.0,"Beautiful dress but it did not fit. I got the large ordering a size up and it fit my daughter whom is 10 and where a 14/16 in girls clothing. Given she is 10, it is not appropriate for her to wear so I will put in closet and give away to a very small petite woman someday."
3.0,Not true to size. Cute dress though.
3.0,I love the color of the suit and the straps are adjustable. I set my straps to be criss cross instead of straight back and that made it fit much better. Mine came with a small ink stain near the crotch and the pads in the chest are horrible! they move around so much and if you take them out you can see right through if you're cold. It comes up your butt but it is not a terrible wedgie. I liked this suit but I think I will find a better quality one
3.0,"It fits as expected and the pattern is lovely, but it feels like tent material, clingy in all the wrong places, and just overall not very flattering."
3.0,"it is a pretty piece and looks nice. However, it is very small although it fits fully around an adult neck. It is not as wide as it seems online. Very light and the earrings are also very light. The stones sparkle very nicely and you don't see as much gold as the picture shows because of the sparkle of the stones.<br />I rated it OK and plan to keep it. Just remember if you are looking for a piece that will fill in your neck area above your dress this piece will not do that. I was looking for such a piece and it didn't meet my needs."
3.0,I followed the chart and ordered a size up per the chart and all the recommendations and it was way too big in all areas. But it was a really nice dress that I would have kept otherwise.
3.0,They look adorable but don’t wash very well!  They are very thin.
3.0,I should have read the full description of the item before purchasing.  I completely relied on the photo.  The shirt is cute but it's old fashioned polyester and not cotton as I expected.  Also very large. I got an xl because I was expecting cotton.  I could have gotten a large with plenty room to spare. It's a true wrap shirt so you can adjust it to fit your waist.  I don't believe it will hang off the shoulders without being secured somehow.  I will keep it but it's not the quality that I was expecting.
3.0,too small just gave it to a friend as a gift
3.0,It is OK  I do not like the material that it's made out of couldn't tell you what it's made out of I know one thing is not leather You are not going to get leather at that price next time I will be more careful when I choose I'm just saying it's OK
3.0,Beautiful belt but it fits very small I wear a size 12 so it is for someone with much smaller waist. I had to return it.
3.0,Smaller then I expected. But it’s cute
3.0,Visually I'm very happy with this product unfortunately I do not think it's going to last very long the quality is not good which makes me because I like everything else about the purse
3.0,"The watch is incredibly light on the wrist. Minimal, and in my opinion, attractive face design. The leather strap is really a cheap pleather that looks kind of bad and feels scratchy on the wrist; the watch itself feels fine. I'm wary of changing out the band since it looks like it could very well damage the watch unless struck absolutely perfectly. Assuming it's easy to swap the band out, then I'd say this is a pretty great price for a niche watch. I'll update when I swap out the band to update if there's any damage."
3.0,"I went with a larger size than normal because another review said it ran small and it's way to big. Also it's too short for me. When I raise my arms up you see my bra, and not just a little but all of it. On the positive side the quality of the material is good and it looks well made."
3.0,"Really neat shape hat.  I was looking forward to getting it.  When it came, the wings were hard plastic and the hat was softer plastic.  The wings attach to the hat kind of strangely and once we got it together right, the wings wouldn't stand up right.  Hot glue should fix it but it's irritating to have to do..."
3.0,"These were ok.  They arrived on time but half of them were on in the package so half of them quit working before I could give them to my kids.  When they worked, however,  they were very cool and quite bright like a flashlight.  They havelittle wide rrubber band to secure them to your fingers.  The kids were mezmorized!"
3.0,"This product did not fit my wife well because the chest is too big. The proportions are very odd. The arms are tight, but the chest is very baggy. The dress would work best for a woman that is small but voluptuous. My wife is tall with broad shoulders. She ordered the large size. The dress fit well around her shoulders and arms, but did not work at her chest. My wife tells me that anyone with a cup size smaller than D probably wouldn't be able to fill out the chest area.<br /><br />Additionally, the fabric is fussy.  Even after washing and steaming, the dress had numerous wrinkles. That being said the fabric is very light weight and soft. The skirt is nice and flowy. One last note is that the color appears to be a brighter red than depicted."
3.0,"I like hook belts better,buttons to complicated,although i love the tightness fit"
3.0,Love the dress not the material.  I was thinking it was cotton but it was polyester blend.  Not good for summer.
3.0,I like this top but it has a strange fit to it. It almost seems like it’s a bikini top. I wear a C cup for all and I find that this barely covers everything so I don’t recommend it for girls who have a larger chest.
3.0,"Very nice shoe but wrong color! Ordered a hot pink and received a soft baby pink or maybe peach pink, not like the picture!"
3.0,The necklace is beautiful! The cross do not change colors only the necklace do but after you wear it for so long. The cross stay the same no matter what the color and all. Overall it’s a good item ‼️
3.0,Only three stars because not all lights worked most ok some not very bright some not at all. Probly wouldn't use again
3.0,"Pretty color, heavy, bigger then it looks in picture. That makes it sit awkward on chest."
3.0,it is way too long and not clearly marked as to front and back but it served its purpose.
3.0,"It arrived on time. It was a bit on the small sid, I ordered a 16 and I wear a size 10/12 jeans and it was snug in the hips and needed taking in at the waist (I'm pear shaped). I didn't get it fit to my measurements.  It seems to be made fairly well. My only complaint is that the champagne color is way more light peachy than champagne."
3.0,THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL  BUT! THE RING WAS NOT A SIZE 8 AND THE EARRING BACKS DO NOT FIT ON THE POST! IF NOT FOR THESE 2 FLAWS  I WOULD DEFINITELY GAVE A 5 STAR REVIEW..
3.0,"These earrings are wafer thin, as the price is inexpensive.  You need to handle these with care."
3.0,"Comfy, but awkward length.  Not a fan."
3.0,"Mask is ok, not a perfect fit but it will do."
3.0,The lace at the bottom of the shirt is a loose flap. That is the only part of the shirt that I dont like. It could otherwise be very cute and comfortable.
3.0,"This top is pretty, but it was a little small on the chest area, and the inner lining was smaller then the outer. Is fits asymmetric."
3.0,"I loved the whole look , but I couldn't zip it. It actually started ripping once I did get it zipped. I ordered a 2x"
3.0,WAYYYYYYY TOOO SMALL
3.0,"Shelf elastic is too tight. I hope it stretches out, over time. Otherwise, okay.<br />I am 5'3&#34; &#34; and 140 lbs. Usually a 40B, so ordered large size."
3.0,The product looks like it is good quality. Doesn't look cheaply made.
3.0,"I bought this for my husband since he has a Ford Mustang! The shirt material is soft and is a good quality and fit as expected. I bought an XL, and he is about 5'11 and 225lbs. I was disappointed that the design on the shirt is off center and crooked. It does not look professional like this and was sad to give as a gift, but since it was my husband he wasn't too picky about it, it was the thought that counted. This should hold up well in the wash as long as you wash in cold water and dry on low heat. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is based solely on my experience with this product and not influenced in any matter by receiving a discount. I do not let other reviews influence my opinion of this product, so I can assure you my use, testing, and evaluation of this product is genuinely mine. When I am shopping for an item on Amazon, I read the reviews to get a sense of the quality of the product, possible uses of it, benefits of the product, and any caveats about purchasing a product. I do my best to cover these points in my reviews. If you have any questions, please leave them below, I’d be happy to answer them if I can."
3.0,"This product looks great but shrink after washing.. i dont wash my clothes on hot water, just eco warm but still it shrink."
3.0,Pretty but not worth 19$
3.0,"Very cute shoes, made me fel dressy just putting it on.However very cheap quality.Definetly something you would get on ""WISH"" and I have seen It before on their website.Wore it for maybe 5-7 times. Very flimsy, The straps broke and went to the trash.Otherwise very cute."
3.0,Very short but beautiful
3.0,The corset is way too small! It is cute and looks to be a decent quality material. I couldn't tell you how it fits because I can't zip it!
3.0,"They’re cute, but you definitely get what you pay for. Cheaper quality, awkwardly shiny. The eyes on the one pair are more of an orange/brown instead of the red/ruby I was expecting. But overall, for the price, not bad. I did get some compliments when I wore them."
3.0,I have not used these sleeves yet but I was happy to find that a product like this existed.  I had melanoma on my wrist.  Finding sun protection that does not add extra layers is nice.  Covering up to avoid the sun can get really warm and uncomfortable.  Adding the sunscreen and a shirt can be like a sweatshirt. I hate to be hot and sweaty.
3.0,"nicely made, but I had to buy a heel support because the shoe was a little to large."
3.0,"For the price, this will do in a pinch (yay for quick shipping) but it came with some runs/snags in the skirt, and an earlier version I ordered had a rip down the side seam. Still, it looked nice for a cocktail party and was very lightweight for summer."
3.0,"Nice top, but it is really big on me. I ordered a small; I'm 5'3&#34; 125# and I need to take in the sides. I look like I'm drowning in it. The material and color is very nice so I don't want to return it."
3.0,"I ordered according to size chart provided by manufacturer. I am usually a M, but based on the chart I needed an XL. WAY too big. Also, I agree with reviews noting that this is an empire waist and does not sit at natural waist as shown in photos."
3.0,Bought this to wear with a costume
3.0,"I do like this dress but the color bled during the first wash, even when following the care instructions."
3.0,These pants were great other than they were at least one size to big if not more they were also down past my ankle but maybe that’s because of the size difference.
3.0,"Very cute, made of high quality material. However, they are not too comfortable to wear. Even after two weeks of wearing them daily the slippers feel tight on my feet, especially at the front of my feet and big toes. I may just not be used to ballet-style slippers, but if I got a size larger, they would be too long."
3.0,"The status of my watch: totaled.<br />For 2 years, I loved this watch. I took it everywhere with me: into the shower, ocean, and bed. Now its life is over, and the cost of replacing the strap is more time and financially-intensive than getting a whole new watch altogether."
3.0,"They were pretty, but seemed more like 4MM so smaller than expected, with short posts and one of the backings was missing.  I returned the same day I received them."
3.0,Kind of low quality.  Look cute but one of the necklaces already broke after only wearing it once
3.0,They are ok. Wish they were screw on
3.0,The shirt is soft and true to color. It’s really sheer so i have to layer it. Because of the sheerness it’s an around the house type of top.
3.0,I love these earrings. I wore them for a few weeks before one of the bars snapped off.
3.0,too small. Color don't look like the picture I order the gray and i thought it was green.  It's okay Im not crazy about it<br />Everyday work purse
3.0,Not bad I mean it looks very nice on the ear but you can tell its Low quality up close
3.0,"They sent the wrong colors and the ear loops are not adjustable. Fortunately, my boys were okay with what was sent. We ordered the black combo and received silver, purple, and rose gold instead."
3.0,"The bra part of the dress is really pointy and too loose, not like the picture. It’s really cute but you have size down in order for it to fit like the picture and even then it’s still a little off."
3.0,I know it says for men but I liked the look and bought it for myself. I have very small wrist so it was too big.
3.0,Is too short for my waist
3.0,"1. A size Large is Not Large.  2. They don’t keep your fingers warm in 29-34 degrees, therefore won’t below zero."
3.0,Overpriced for shoe laces
3.0,"It looks like I order the wrong Size, it was my fault ."
3.0,Fun and easy-going for summer fun!
3.0,"Material is not good quality. Otherwise, it's a very cute dress/tunic."
3.0,gorgeous dress but I ordered a large tall and it still was to short. came up to my ankles. I'm 5'7&#34;
3.0,"This fit and looked way different than expected. Ended up looking awkward and baggy and I never wore it. To be expected sometimes for online shopping, though. Looks cute in the picture but color is a bit darker in person and just did not fit as pictured."
3.0,My husband had a hard time putting this bow tie on for his tuxedo. My recommendation is to figure out how to tie I before the big day
3.0,"Love this purse, but it doesn't stand up to regular wear with daily use. I've owned and used daily for a few months, and the main zipper clasp on top has broken off, some threads coming undone on the straps. Almost unusable at this point. Would not buy again."
3.0,The level of compression does not match what was labeled.
3.0,"This helped in breaking the wind from entering your neck/lower-face area, but isn't as warm as I hoped."
3.0,"I liked the design of this product but the fabric is not very breathable. I wore this to a bridal shower in August but couldn't stay in it all day because it felt too warm. When I read the &#34;one size fits most&#34; I didn't realize that this product ships from China, where most people are significantly smaller than me. I wear a size 12-14 and this loose fit tunic meant for leggings is definitely a t-shirt with jeans kind of thing for me. It was pretty inexpensive so I'm going to keep it but I do not see myself wearing it often."
3.0,"I really had high hopes for this dress. I've ordered several dresses for a 50s themed party. The neckline on this one is by far my favorite. The medium I ordered fit fine (I'm a 6 to an 8 normally, 34D)/ However, the fabric is really cheap. It's a thin polyester knit that clings to everything (especially in white). The skirt is not anywhere near as full as the picture, either. When I slipped the crinoline slip underneath, it stretched out too tightly and you could see the slip layers as well. If this dress was of the stretch cotton like poly-blend fabric the others have been, it might have worked better. It's a certain miss for my needs so it's going back."
3.0,VERY CHEAPLY MADE FOR THE MONEY. MADE W/ VERY THIN T-SHIRT LIKE MATERIAL. DRESSES UP A T-SHIRT & CUTE PLASTIC NECKLACE.
3.0,It’s nice but the straps broke in one month.  Very disappointed in product.
3.0,"I had ordered the bronze version of this and was very happy with it. So when I saw the key chain version I wanted it as well. As soon as I opened the wings to see the clock, they fell off..."
3.0,they look rusted
3.0,"This dress is weird.  My friend said it looked like a plastic trash bag.  the bustline is very flat and bra cups are poorly places.  But... I stitched the cleavage together and low and added a corset and the dress rocked.  So if you're creative, you can make it work :)"
3.0,It fits small and tight for me and the design is so-so. The picture looks better than the actual product.
3.0,Returned it.  Material was not what I was expection.
3.0,"I’ve lost a button after two uses, and the fabric is very cheap. I would suggest buying a size down from the larger I got because it’s stretchier than I thought."
3.0,Larger top. Should have ordered a size down. Material is on the cheap side.
3.0,Just Ok. Quality could be better.
3.0,Ordered mens by mistake
3.0,"I know it says swim suit cover, but even the navy is totally see through. Can't wear in public."
3.0,If you can find better made ones I’d skip buying this.  It’s super cute but the quality is horrible.  Stitching came undone twice on two different orders.<br />But I kept mine because it’s thin for summer and I loved the comfort and fit and I couldn’t find a similar one better made that’s not $200.<br />I’m 5’1” about 118lbs and got a small.  Fit is roomy- not sure if It would work if you’re too much skinnier unless they start selling xs.  After washing I didn’t need to hem it.
3.0,"You get what you pay for with this item. It makes a very distict &#34;swishing&#34; sound when you walk. Like windpants almost. Otherwise, it's a great skirt for the price and fits as expected."
3.0,"I love the dress and the fabric,  but the dress was small"
3.0,"Too large, too cheap looking"
3.0,The bottom fall done in the first wash
3.0,"I lift and workout regularly. If you have bigger upper arms and have a broad upper back/shoulders it won’t fit. The sleeves do not have any stretch, so I couldn’t get it all the way on. The dress would have fit me everywhere else. Wish it had more give in the sleeves."
3.0,"se me hacen raritos, y muy apretados a mi hija no le gustaron , los hubiese regresados pero en el tiempo de la pandemia  dicen que no se aceptan devoluciones asi que ni modo"
3.0,The black were a little small here them ripping or stretching as I but them on and my arms are 18 inch<br />The camo ones fit perfectly.
3.0,I have a pair of Lazy One pants that I discovered at the gift shop in Death Valley. Loved them so much and was excited to find them available on Amazon. Problem is that these are made of 60% Polyester and 40% cotton. I looked closer at the label after realizing they were not as comfortable for sleeping. The polyester is stretchy and makes the pants twist around when shifting positions in bed.
3.0,I love the color but the shape is odd it is small at the top breast area and big at the bottom. It has no shape whatsoever so it looks to tight on my breast and big on the stomach area.
3.0,Will not stay tied or on your shoulders.
3.0,I have nothing negative about the product itself to say about.  Quality is extremely good for the price.  The only thing is that it has engraving on the outside of it that says &#34;Pure Love&#34;.<br /><br />I was looking for rings that didn't have any sort of phrase on them.
3.0,very cheap fabric
3.0,Overall not a bad fit but the way the waistband is designed makes no sense to me. It has a tendency to roll up- not a fan
3.0,Love the colors and look...however it turns my wrist orange when i sweat.
3.0,"I bought a Large. I’m 6’1” and 210, fits fine in the shoulder and waist, but way too short. It barely comes past my waist. I would prefer it to be 2-3” longer."
3.0,The robe is nice but the hanging tag has already broken. It's not as soft as it could be but it was only $20.  The person who it was for liked it.
3.0,"This jacket was bought as a holiday gift for our grandson, a triathlete. The description was very impressive, and the design coming from Sweden was what drew me in to purchase it. However, when the jacket arrived, there is no mention of Sweden and what went into the design, as well as no mention of all the attributes. Furthermore, it is made in CHINA, which is written in several places on the jacket, but NOT on the Amazon website description! It is very concerning that there is absolutely no mention of China in the description on the Amazon website. If you are trying to avoid purchasing items made in China like we are, then...Buyer beware!"
3.0,"Get a size or two up. Material is thin and not flannel but soft against the skin. Probably not very warm. Note the long delivery time too. Otherwise, for the price, i would have kept it if it fit."
3.0,"I almost returned these right away because the quality seemed so low. There were seams sticking out everywhere.  Then I put them on my daughter and it was cuteness overload.  The material is also warm so that's something to consider.  Bottom line is that I would definitly recomend them, just be aware that the quality is not the greatest."
3.0,"Love the look..... Hate the smell<br />Had it long enough now for the smell to be gone but doesn't truly leave.  The warmer it gets while you are outside, the worse it gets!!<br />Can't use it."
3.0,Very cute. Ordered for granddaughters easter outfit and disappointed to find they were way too big. Saving for another time and spent the day in tights and socks instead.
3.0,"This watch looks better in the picture than when in actual possession. I purchase cheap watches for my work wear only and don't expect them to last much more that 6 months to a year, but this one really looks cheap. The other factor is that it includes no instructions for setting the date, day or month? I have tried all functions for setting as on most other units, still to no avail. I don't think this one will even make it 6 months-band is stiff and feels like it will break soon?"
3.0,The earrings are pretty but the picture is misleading.  The gold doesn't look like the picture.
3.0,"The belt broke right after I put it on, buttons snapped off. Wasn’t even tight on me. Not the best quality, but the dress overall is cute. Also some stitching was kinda protruding out of the dress"
3.0,Not what I expected. I received wrong color. Jacket is and does what it says. In all regards. I will say extremely thin and light. Ideal for True Backpack camping. Was looking for heavier and a different color.
3.0,they came out better than expected tbh but were entirely too big for a medium and were pretty high waisted. I wish there was an exchange option but unfortunately I just have to get a refund because there's literally nothing I could do w them.
3.0,"My oldest is transgender and was looking for under garmets to put his ""bit"" in and we stumbled across these. For the price, we figured it was worth a try. These will hold you hold you over until the correct harness arrives. It is best to wear them over a regular pair of boxers for added security. They are not a long term solution and awkward as far as being regular under pants. My other son said he ""falls out"" constantly.<br />TLDR; If you are looking for breezy boxers, you may want to pass. Waiting for packer harness, these are okay over other boxers."
3.0,"Adorable, but not made for all shoe types. They ripped the first day I wore them."
3.0,"This was purchased as a gift so time passed before it was opened,  The crystal was broken but it was too late to return it,  Suggest you open the package and inspect it when it is received."
3.0,"The quality of the hat is good, suitable for children. That is, the adhesiveness of the removable transparent cover is very bad, and it is not sticky after a few times of use. I am disappointed."
3.0,This was really cute however i recommend order a size or two up.<br />Everyone asked where i got it and i told tjem amazon because they had never seen one in stores like it!
3.0,"It would have been the perfect dress, but...when I tried the dress on the seam near the zipper was undone. I had to take it to the tailor to be sewn. $12 later it became the perfect dress."
3.0,"Such a beautiful design with flowy, crepe-like fabric... but runs a bit small. The tan color wasn't flattering at all on my skin tone."
3.0,Much larger than I expected after reading the reviews. Don’t buy a size up.
3.0,Too hip hugging and Stretchy for me. But if you like that fit. More power to you
3.0,Love it but tarnished fast
3.0,"Very light weight, but look as cheap as they are.  Wouldn't buy these again."
3.0,It was see through.
3.0,I found this product to be too large.<br />I like to have 2 matching items for both hands. This just wasn't what I needed. Returned.
3.0,"Fabric is costume quality, and side zipper seams unnecessary and awkward but it's a fun graphic statement with the stripes."
3.0,Runs small. Size up from your normal size especially if you have a broad back!
3.0,material was a little heavy.  Cute though.  I sent it back
3.0,"They were long enough but too small. Also, they’ve already ripped at two seams. Don’t bother!"
3.0,"Beautiful skirt, however, you may need to go up one size"
3.0,Would give it 5 stars but shrank so bad in wash thet are unwearable
3.0,Some of the color looks off and the lines you can see pixels
3.0,I like it but I'm not crazy about the materials. Lastly it doesn't stand on it's own.
3.0,"Inconsistent product quality. I bought this dress in black and blue and the fabrics were completely different; the black was a soft knit similar to a jersey dress of the same cut I already owned while the blue was your typical cotton t-shirt material. I didn't like the material so the blue one is going back. They did fit well, I am 5'10&#34; 120lbs 35-22-35 measurements so I ordered a small and it hits just above the knees."
3.0,"Good looking, not very dark lens though"
3.0,Not very flattering without a flared slip underneath.
3.0,"Cute design, accurate to photo and fits true to size. Material is THICK cotton and a little rough, even after washing."
3.0,"Ordered this for my bonus grandaughter who has long super curly hair. Even though she has a LOT of hair, this won't stay in place as it is too loose. Looks like a gaiter face mask, so I am assuming that seller decided to label it as a headband as most people are no longer using fabric masks?"
3.0,"I love the way these socks feel. They are super thin and lightweight. The gripper on the back of the sock is great because my socks aren't slipping down. The reason for the 3 stars, I'm wearing my third pair of these and a giant hole by my toes just appeared after an hour of wearing them. Hopefully all the other pairs last longer than these."
3.0,To large and itchy
3.0,Really liked the speed with which I received the items.  They seemed a bit skimpy on the fabric in both texture and amount of material.
3.0,"I suppose it is what it says it is, but I can't seem to get it to do what it says it should do."
3.0,"Honestly kinda disappointed in this, my boyfriend bought it for me because he really wanted to see me in it, but when it came in and I tried it on, it was uncomfortably tight. Yes I still was able to put it on, but definitely not comfy sleeping material. I would have returned it, but I don’t want to break his poor heart"
3.0,"I bought this necklace and it’s good, but the pearl is too small for the cage and keeps falling out."
3.0,"Fun costume , but the head didn’t hold air very well, I had to hold its head up all night"
3.0,"OK, but there are better out there.  Not wide enough for my belt."
3.0,"One of the pieces came broken and will not stay, will have to superglue it<br /> Another piece broke off later with normal use. Pretty, though. Get lots of compliments."
3.0,"Read a few reviews that said the ring scratched because their husbands worked with their hands. I thought this wouldn't be an issue because my husband does not. Two days after wearing it he had 2 wide scratches on it. The black was scraped off and the shiny bottom layer is showing. Deffeinatly not tungsten. Bought this because he lost his 500$ tungsten ring. Giving it 3 stars for its price and because,despite the scratches, my husband still loves it."
3.0,Nice looking and great quality but too uncomfortable for my needs.
3.0,"I'm undecided on this shirt - it looks like the picture but I'm not sure it's the right style for me.  I originally bought it for work, but I'm not sure I like the giant bow in the front."
3.0,Looks very nice but we where unable to get of the snap to use the button part... No matter how hard we tried
3.0,"I did not care for the look if it. That's just me. It was light weight and did not have the punch of color or the look I was wanting.  That said,  it may be someone else's cup of tea. Just know that it basically looks like the picture.  The blue is not a solid blue, it has other flecks of color and the white enamel/marble look is too prominent for me in this piece. I needed a more sapphire colored blue."
3.0,"While the fit is a bit small, they are quite comfortable.  The only thing I don't like is that the waist tends to roll down a little.  I'm 6'1 athletic 215lbs.  Wish the waist band was maybe a bit more sturdy.  Waist is also not as high as the pics.<br /><br />The leg and rear end support is good, and have no problems from squatting to running.  Good quality material and feels great on the skin."
3.0,Kept my boys secure
3.0,"I bought these for my 5 year old and they are nice, however, very small that they almost sink into her earring hole.  Great price and perfect backing"
3.0,Fits ok but it is very rough to sleep on. The image looks great but it is not comfortable to lay your head on.
3.0,Ran large for size compared to all other clothes you purchase
3.0,"Ordered these to see if I could reduce my $80+ leggings habit. For fit and feel, I'm looking for some compression for my runs and barre class. The good: the length is perfect for me (5'3&#34;) and works as a full length legging rather than a Capri. The waistband is nice and firm, and I'm pretty sure they would not slide down during runs.  The bad: other than the waistband, which is thicker, I find the knit to be kind of loose and not supportive at all. Also, for someone with muscular calves, these were actually a little baggy. So not for me and my workout needs. But, these are perfect for lounging around the house and I might reorder for that purpose. For reference, I'm a size 8 lululemon."
3.0,"These are effective in keeping me from slipping on the floor, but unfortunately, I've had problems getting &#34;stuck&#34; on the mat.  I find myself having to actually pick up my foot and move my feet in ways that hinder the poses.  I think I'd do just as well with regular socks, just being careful if I move to the floor."
3.0,"Pretty but too small on top and too big on bottom, but that could just be me."
3.0,"My wife had found these and picked them out. She absolutely loves them. They look great and she hasn't had an issue, of any kind, at all. Stay secured great and are made very well.<br />**UPDATE 3/31/17** So today my wife brought to my attention that her piercing had lost a few of the &#34;diamonds&#34; around the outside and had a very noticeable discoloration now. She had been wearing it everyday since she got them and she said it was a nice piercing, while it lasted. What was great upon first glance, has turned out to be a bummer. Lesson learned."
3.0,The neck needs a deeper hem in it with a double row of stitches as do the wrists of the long sleeves.  This touch would make the shirt look more &#34;finished.&#34; Otherwise it is OK:  mediocre.  Mine faded when washed the first time. The small white snowflakes are not so white anymore. and the black is now charcoal colored.
3.0,"Falls apart easily which is a PITA. Two of my daughters are ballerinas so we go through so many hairnets and these black cinching ones are by far the hardest I’ve ever had to work with. I was really hopeful for them but there is nothing holding this super chokable little spring piece in place. So yesterday while trying to tighten buns on both my daughters the little pieces slipped and popped off — I have a 13 month old so I had to stop what I was doing to go hunt down these dangerous chokable bun tightening pieces. They’re hard to maneuver with and without hair product and just pop right off. They did the same when I was taking them out of my daughters’ hair. When compared to our regular reusable nets (the brown one in the photo) once the spring thing pops off there’s no elasticity or anything to stay on your bun because it relies on that cinching mechanism. So while the concept was super intriguing, the execution was poor and I cannot recommend these."
3.0,"The sizing runs very small , I ordered  a large . But looks like a small , not even a medium . Its like I should have chosen the XXL to just get a L size as intended . That’s how small they are. This purchase was suppose to be a gift. Guess not !"
3.0,pretty earrings but the clasp does not go very high on ear so it looks kind of unnatural
3.0,This set was ok. Looked better on site.
3.0,"Love the product.  There are size or compression strength differences between the gray and black.  Black are perfect, the gray hurt my foot where I have hardware.  The size difference is primarily in the ankle and arch of the foot."
3.0,Its cute fits well but the little diamond fell off too soon.
3.0,I ordered these for my husband but they actually fit me better.  They are made very small.  I ordered a 2xl for my husband and I wear them now and I am a women's large/xl.  I like the fit for myself just way to small for mens sizing.
3.0,"Only used once,its been cloudy."
3.0,Thank you first of all for the company reaching out to me....that means a whole loy...initually I very upset...I normally wear a 7 1/2 but order an 8...its completely to small...nor is it wide width...and the zipper sticks badly...I also have to pay to have it returned...which angered me more since this is more of a defect that a user error...the boots are gorgeous.i will also state that this company took the time out to respond to me....I truly loved the boot upon receiving them...I will make this statement....but be very cautious on the sizing
3.0,Kinda smaller than i imagined but very pretty ... but still looks good. 😉
3.0,"Very Cute T shirt, HOWEVER, It is entirely too small. I purchased a Large, which I am normally a med/ sometimes large buyer. This Large was so narrow in shoulders, chest.. It is like a Small. So please beware if you are somewhat busty or have a tummy. A truly skinny gal can wear a small if you are like a size 2. I wear a size 10 jean and the size Large tshirt in this , was so tight. I just gave it away to someone very small."
3.0,I love the print but the material is really weird. Almost like swimsuit material.
3.0,"The shoes are fine, but fit is smaller than expected.  Size 9 toes are hanging off the front."
3.0,"Inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. Served its purpose, but I wish I'd spent more money."
3.0,"I'm a size 3,<br /><br />Ordered a small tag sayz 2-4 us<br /><br />Fit more like a 4-8 us<br /><br />Get a size smaller at the least<br /><br />Material feels really good/quality, highly recommend"
3.0,"I'm between dress sizes.  A 10 is usually too small in the chest, but 12 too large.  I went with a large in this dress.  I wish the waist of this dress was lower, like pictured.  Also, it's very puffy!  Looks like I gained at least 10lbs putting it on.  If the waist was lower, it may help.  Like the softness and lace nonetheless."
3.0,"The material is very comfy, however.. the pants<br /> run kinda big in the crotch area"
3.0,It is really pretty but the edges are unfinished and the size is on the smaller side
3.0,"Soft but bottom of shoes are hard.  But, worth price."
3.0,This thing is huge . I wish Their was  smaller sizing
3.0,Magnet really strong.  The metalring on the inside can scratch the lenes.
3.0,These were HUGE! I ordered 6-12mo for my baby but they are better suited for my 3 year old!
3.0,"I love that the fabric is super soft, and the pockets are great. My only complaint is the length of the pants. Based on other reviews, I went up one size from my normal fit, and they’re still short. I’m 5’7”, and wouldn’t have thought they’d fit so short."
3.0,"I love the look of the earrings but the posts are so thick that I would need to force them through my earring holes (which would be painful) and no earring backs will go on them.  The plastic holders that came with them were extremely difficult to remove in order to take the earrings off of the card.  If the manufacturer comes up with thinner posts that will fit standard earring backs, I would love to have the earrings.  Otherwise, I'm returning them for a refund."
3.0,I got these for my Zumba class and they started falling apart after the 2nd use.  One side of one of the cuffs lost its thread and all the beads and coins came off.
3.0,These masks do not fit well.
3.0,Too large in shoulders and lots of extra material bunches under arms. Not as supportive as expected but likely since too large. Not sure if will try Med size since it also comes up high on neck Not as pictured and seems hard to wear as undershirt.
3.0,Too long for a petite person.  Also product does not match size chart description of size.
3.0,nice product but ran on the small side. I niece never minds when things are small because she benefits from it.
3.0,I like the style of these shoes they are very unique. The quality I wasn't expecting to be perfect but within days my 4yr old tore the strap off and I couldn't fix them. His foot is too small to wear without the strap. He also got these wet at the beach and the air bubble portion came out without effort. He was a I glued that part back with shoe glue but I do wish they would sell straps separately. I think maybe my little one is just too rough for these kind of shoes.
3.0,Every panty fitted differently and way too small...very very cheaply made.
3.0,"Have yet to wear them and they are already tarnished. They are bigger than I expected, but nice."
3.0,"This would be &#34;Asian sizing&#34; the price is right, but the size isn't. Quality is actually really nice, bright blue that doesn't bleed, but of course it does me no good if it doesn't fit."
3.0,The XL fit my daughter who where's small normally
3.0,"These slippers are pretty decent. I bought them for my boyfriend, they're light and easy to wear.."
3.0,Its cute as a cover up or nightgown wasn't quite what I would wear to work but worth the price.
3.0,"Fit is too tight, but looks great!"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but there were so many little things wrong with it that it just wasn't worth it for me to keep. I am ultimately returning this.<br /><br />Size: I am 4'11 and 95lbs. Normally a size 0. I got the XSMALL. It actually fit well in the waist and length but that was about it. Once the straps were tightened, the top fit nicely in the shoulder area; however, the top itself was a whole issue, see photos. The main issues were the top fit and the body suit. The top portion is fixed so it fit decent enough when standing straight and not moving, but its not made well. And the bottom was so saggy and didn't cover my butt at all. I would have had to had the crotch altered to actually sit at my crotch and maybe cover my butt. Since this is see through, the body suit is a bid deal.<br /><br />Material: The quality overall is okay. I loved the mesh, see through look. It's not particularly cheap feeling as a whole, but the strings holding the back together are extremely poor. Its basically cheap rope. It was not anything nice and it was just knotted together to keep it closed. It screamed cheap and didn't function well. The overlay was very nice though and the flower detail was very impressive. The bodysuit wasn't the best material either as it sat weird. It was comfortable feeling though so that's a positive.<br /><br />Color: The color is off. It's still a nice nude color but its much darker than the photo shown. Didn't bother me though. I actually liked it darker.<br /><br />Fit: Many problem areas for me personally. Top bust portion had a lot of excess fabric under the pits that would need to be taken in. The front 'V' also had this weird wire piece in it to hold it's shape, which was okay but it looked like it would pop out of the fabric at any moment and rip it. It also made the front fall very oddly. It looked even worse when I sat down. See pics. My boobs might have well been out. This would have needed ALOT of extra alterations. Again, the bodysuit bottom was huge on me and would have also needed to be take in.<br /><br />Bottom line: Overall, just alright. For me, it had too many problem areas and was ill fitting. Not worth the additional work and money to get it to where it needs to be."
3.0,these are great right out of the package.  they stay on and dont ride down your foot so you never need to keep adjusting them.  fast forward to after washing them.....they shrink and they now ride down your foot so you need to adjust them every time you think about it.  i was going to order another set prior to washing them but now...not so much.  i was so excited after the first wearing that i finally found a brand that doesnt fall down.  very disappointed now.
3.0,seems durable and I like the look but had to give them to my son ..they run small
3.0,"Love the dress; I own two of this style. Didn't like that it was covered in long, white cat hairs on arrival. I don't own a cat, and I expected it to be brand new. Thinking someone probably returned it because it didn't fit right and it was repackaged and sent to me. Ew. Too much hassle to exchange for a different one, and I want to wear it this week, so I'll just wash it to rid it of pet hair. Disappointed it passed quality control on the return."
3.0,I’m a woman with curves. It’s not for my body type. Although it’s a nice dress. Great for the office.
3.0,"Sizing (M) fits well for 10 yr old. Fabric is thick and moves well with dance. However, I bought this 20 days ago and the neck stitching it already coming undone (not washed yet).... how do I return this for replacement?"
3.0,Charm fell off and was lost first week.
3.0,"I am not sure of the exact brand, I was trying to get my boyfriend a gift but he loves them and Nordstrom sells them. I opted to go cheaper, we donated all but the blue and white. They really are ok socks but again a knock off."
3.0,Not as pictured.  Share yes but nit as big and flowing... not worth more than 8 bucks
3.0,"Ok for the price, a bit stiff and uncomfortable."
3.0,Cute but material is extremely thin
3.0,"Fits well, I just don't like how the pockets stick out no matter how you push them in."
3.0,Little disappointed in the quality of the watch for an anniversary edition. Thought it would be made a  better quality.
3.0,"Very cheaply made, from frames to the plastic lenses I gave mine away"
3.0,You get what you pay for this watch is ok for the price
3.0,The handle is clunky and the lower arm brace digs into your forearm. It’s only good up to a 45 round. But in a pinch may save your life.
3.0,"Otherwise, I like them - the are comfortable and have good lenses for outdoor sports, but I purchased these because my old ones tended to fog up.  So so these."
3.0,Fits right except boob area why do they thing you have big boobs when you are plus size.
3.0,"The shirt feels good, but is a little too snug for my liking."
3.0,Like them! perfect fit perfect look
3.0,"Quality is decent, but color is not what I was expecting. I was expecting an aqua or torquoise color and it’s more like a pine green."
3.0,Chain snapped within 5 minutes of wearing. But very cute!
3.0,WISH IT WAS 100 PERCENT COTTON- LITTLE LINT BALLS ARE FORMING ON THE SLEEVES ALREADY.  FOR MY  NEXT ONE I WILL RESEARCH BETTER BEFORE I BUY.  IT IS WARM AND COMFY.
3.0,Super cute and comfortable cotton socks.  These are not meant for true ski socks to be worn skiing.
3.0,"The gloves look amazing and they do indeed work with touch screens, but there are a few downsides. For one, they make your hands smell. The inside cloth smells oily, and leaves your hands with the same scent to the point rubbing your eyes after taking the gloves off can cause irritation. They can carry an electric charge, not enough to hurt you but the static charge is still a bit &#34;shocking&#34;. The wrist band is pretty pathetic, the buckle is weak and the strap feels flimsy. However these gloves do work to keep the cold out, I have yet to experience my fingers becoming cold while wearing these."
3.0,"Cute, but the Velcro doesn’t stay fastened"
3.0,"I really liked the idea of these.  They are cute, but they are huge.  Wish the crystal balls were a little smaller.  They are so large, they bent up my earlobe,  so I kept having to adjust them.  But for the price, not a bid deal."
3.0,"I ordered these as a cheap back-up. And I guess I got what I paid for. These look a little more sturdy in the picture shown, but seem very flimsy. Sparkly, yes. Long lasting, we'll see."
3.0,I love the design and the fabric is comfortable. But I ordered an XL and it fits like a M - I could barely get it on and it's definitely not wearable at that size.
3.0,"I loved the pendant, a bit smaller than expected.  I wore it for the sixth time and the chain broke while I was out and lost the pendant."
3.0,"They a re no where near as comfortable as my oofos. Should have stuck with those. also not much arch support, slippery inside and ugly on the feet ."
3.0,They don't really look like the picture was kind of bummed when I opened them. They are very thin and on the small side.
3.0,Fits ok. The snaps keep coming undone. Very annoying
3.0,"I usually like and XL in a Jacket, but this was way to big. Shoulder and body of jacket was to large but length was fine. Love the appearance, color . Would definitely size down."
3.0,The sizing is great. The comfort is awesome. The only thing is that the material is a bit on the lighter weight side. It is see thru when held up to light.
3.0,"I had to rearrange it multiple times before I just said forget it and took a picture.<br />It's a racerback type of tank with spaghetti straps, which is probably great if you're perky enough to not need a bra with it...I do not fit that description lol.<br />It's lightweight though, so that's good.  I'll probably wear it for around the house on hot days (I'm in Florida so have an abundance of opportunity lol), but given current my proportions I won't wear it out in public.<br />Maybe one day if I can shave off some pounds, but not today lol.<br />Overall it is a cute top, just not flattering for my upper half."
3.0,The charm is hung backwards but it's a cute bracelet.
3.0,Some of the wholes that makes the belt tighter have already come out.
3.0,"I guess I should have researched these more before buying.  The ends on these gaiters are not hemmed or stitched, so even new out of the package the material is starting to fray and split.  I do not anticipate that these will last very long, especially when washed.  I find it surprising that no other reviews mentioned this.  Personally, if I had to do this over I would look for a different product that shows the ends are stitched.  I gave 3 stars for the quantity and the fact that it is partly my fault for not verifying the QUALITY first before buying."
3.0,"Quick to arrive, as earrings they are lovely, but either the color is not as shown here, or I got the wrong order -- mine are as purple as purple can be."
3.0,Didn't realize this was plastic.
3.0,Very satisfied!! For the cost and the amount you get.. worth it. You can mix and match and have diffrent options. Glad I wasnt deterred by the negative reviews.
3.0,They are really pretty but one of the earrings doesn't clasp shut properly so I have never worn them.
3.0,"I wear a medium, but based on recommendations ordered one size larger. It was too large and thus returned. I like a tighter fit in long johns. I'm 5'10&#34;, 135 lbs, 30/32 pants. I like the fabric and would reorder a medium."
3.0,"I should have gotten a small but it is as pictured. Fabric is of somewhat lower quality, but for the price it's not a bad buy."
3.0,"Terrific looking cap that fit very well. I gave this hat 3 stars for 1 reason only...it is an ""official"" army hat and endorsed by the army yet it is made in VIETNAM!? Never would have purchased had I known that. The hat is truly nice but having it made in Vietnam makes my blood boil!"
3.0,"The sizing is small.  I ordered size 5 and the top is too small/tight for my 4 year old grandchild.<br />Otherwise, it is cute."
3.0,"It looks nice, but leather is very thin.  Perhaps that's what some folks prefer; personally, I was hoping it would be a bit thicker."
3.0,Looks good  but too long and narrow for me
3.0,"It’s really cute but I didn’t like that it wraps around our face, so it makes it look weird."
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these for a big order of masks.  About 20% do not work on 1/8 inch cords or elastic ( I tried both) They were drilled out to where the pass through hole is just too large. The Majority that are too big are black & yellow. I have not tried on 1/4 inch elastic but most don't want that and it would not work for my needs.  I ordered 2 packages since I needed a 1000 sets, of the 2 packs I ordered I got 2 different shades of blue, gray  and pink, the pink on one was so light it was almost white.  The purple is not pretty or pastel or really purple it is more a muddy gray brown purple just UGLY.  I have bought these from different vendors and had not had these issues.  I can not return because I need the ones that do work correctly, but now, because they made them incorrectly, I have to order more, but it won't be from this vendor..."
3.0,"I love the suit, even if they did ship the wrong back suit. I ordered black 2 (black + white pattern) and was sent black 1(black+mulitcolor). I love the corset tie detail. The bottoms look great and love.the high waist. Great suit, all in all."
3.0,The cutouts in  the arch cause discomfort when used in my boots had to put in a pair of shoes and they are ok not great bought another foot bed at Red Wing and while the cost was more the comfort and fit was superb.
3.0,I have a somewhat small head and this hat was almost to small for my head.  I don’t feel it was worth the money but I couldn’t find a light blue hat in a store.
3.0,Cheap but my girlfriend is the one who bought it.
3.0,Fabric is very nice and colors are just as pictured.  However....Too small. No snaps. I added snaps. There is no pocket to add a filter in the mask.
3.0,"I like the style of these yoga pants, however, the sizing is smaller than expected.  I normally wear a large, am 5' 7"" and these yoga pants were far too short for me.  The inseam for a large is 30.71"", so if you size up, you'll probably be ok.  The material is a bit thin, but was very comfortable.  Great design, but sizing needs to be addressed."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d00589a0ab44219625e75ab8a9ab2cdd]] I like the color of this suit and the way it fit but the pants are wayyy too long. Wore it on a day out and the bottom of the pants were touching the ground and even got wet when I wore it.
3.0,You get what you pay for.  The look was ok but it wasn’t great quality.  If I’d known what the style was going to be (vest is sewn on to shirt and is only on the front) id have gone with another outfit for my event.
3.0,This is a beautiful statement piece I received as a gift from my sister. My problem with it is all the pokey wires which scratch my clothes and have ruined a couple of my tops already. I love the necklace but the craftsmanship could use a lot of improvement.
3.0,"A little large, but serve the purpose will hold ra lot of cards"
3.0,These are really cute but the long ones don’t fit in my ear correctly so I can’t even wear most of them because of how they are. The ear cuffs are great and fit perfect though.
3.0,Love me bracelet. For the price .
3.0,Never was delivered. Received credit. I’m sure it is a cute too though.
3.0,These worked great until body oils got into them. Now they slip right off. Don’t know how to avoid that.
3.0,The fabric feels really good but I would have liked them to be more spandex than cotton to help with sweat absorption. These are more for relaxing rather than working out.
3.0,"I ordered these as a compression boot for my feet and ankles. I sit a lot at work and needed a boot that comes part-way up my leg  (a driver) to prevet swelling. They work! I've had them a few weeks now and, once broken in, they could've been 1/2 size smaller. I wear a true 7.5 but in this boot a 7 would've given me better coverage and a tighter ankle fit. I wear these with thick tube socks or 2 prs hanes socks and still could have a tighter fit. They are ugly, to me, but that is not why I chose them so it's not relevant. As you can see in the pics the snaps do not properly snap. On mine they are malfunctioned and I have been thinking on cutting them off altogether since I will never fold them down. Overall a good, comfy boot (after a few days of wear) for the price. I have worn them in torrential rains and my feet stayed dry. I will reorder a 2nd pr. but in a smaller size once these are worn."
3.0,"Material is thin, like a t-shirt.  No shape, like pictured.  I was going to wear to church with belt, heels, and necklace.  Have to rethink that now."
3.0,The sleeves are printed white bands that don't stretch which makes this shirt a bit uncomfortable.  This shirt could improve with fabric bands or no bands at all.
3.0,"I love the look of the shirt, but it is extremely stat-icky I think it is the fabric itself."
3.0,These are not as large as I thought they would be - cute glasses but disappointed in the size
3.0,"It was stripping a bit when it came,and smells a bit weird. I love the compartments though and it's spacious. Adjustable strap is great."
3.0,they're not exactly what I thought they would be. I put in the same number and color as the number and color on my friends and the arms are more a tortoise shell and hers are black.
3.0,Color is brown instead of blue. Clearly a dropshipper and not from Foster Grant. Took over a week to arrive. I'll be buying reading glasses in person from now on.
3.0,all of them are super cute but one was too big for the gauge in my nose piercing
3.0,It's ok coat. As described
3.0,The dress is soft and very long almost to long.  You had better be tall to wear this gown.
3.0,"I normally wear a US XL in a top, but after reading the reviews, ordered up 2 sizes. I’m glad I did; the top fit well. The bottoms were very loose fitting and more like underwear than shorts. (The legs of the shorts were basically nonexistent; no more than an inch long.) It was more important to me how the top fit than the bottoms."
3.0,Not best quality of material but I'll wear them as &#34;work boots&#34;.
3.0,"This four pack of velvet chokers is good for the price. However, I will say that they don't have any stretch to them... so if I put it on too tight and the choker pulls then it will break (the clasp pulls off), which is fixable but annoying. Besides that I do think they are really cute on."
3.0,I like them but they keep sliding down
3.0,"Not for near-plus or plus size women.  The XL (listed as a size 18) fits like a L.  I laundered as directed: wash cold , no dry. Otherwise pretty, soft, and seems to be of good quality.  If it came as a 2X or 3X I would try again."
3.0,Cute but after a few washes it faded. Perfect for the price my 3 year old  loves it and great for school
3.0,Poor quality of material and I usually wear a medium and the larger size was still did not fit well.
3.0,"A little hard to put on a 'fat footed' baby as the front strap is just for show.  Once on, they seem to fit alright.  A bit confused though, as both sandals close on on the same side; ie: one clasps on the outer side while one clasps on the inner side.  A defect I suspect :-("
3.0,"These are so comfy!! And I love that they have pockets... But I am upset that I washed them 1 time, and the seam on the waist is already coming unraveled. Bummer! I just sewed them up last night.. But pretty aggravated that I spent $35 on a pair of pants, and the sewing on it is crappy. I should have just went to Walmart and bought a $15 pair.. Oh well! ;) hopefully yours will be better."
3.0,"Not bad for the money, but not great either."
3.0,Size designation on Amazon misleading: way too small for man with shoe size 13
3.0,"Complicated to put on, we will need a helper to corset us in the back. Color is a scarlet red. Orange undertone but a red color which I didn’t expect. Material Quality is ok though. I do not recommend for my red themed formal events tho."
3.0,So I bought these for my husband and he really liked the feel of the underwear but they didn't last very long. we got pricier underwear so they would last. My husband said they didn't last much longer then hans or fruit of the loom. so good underwear but wouldn't buy again.
3.0,You definitely getting what you pay for. I returned this and just spent extra $ for an Invicta.
3.0,La correa aparentemente es igual a la original pero al llevarla con el relojero no casa exacto como la original así que ahora debo modificar la correa y desgastarla un poco para que case con el reloj. Mala experiencia
3.0,It took for ever to get it. I do like it.
3.0,"Little less plastic on the top of the fish bag would be better. That seems to be a common trend complaint regarding these. But, easily fixed with scissors. I've only had them for about a week, but I've had quite a few compliments on the earrings when I wear them. They're cute!!! 🐟🐠🐟"
3.0,Nice shirt. But way to small
3.0,I usually buy size 10 or medium. These are too tight.
3.0,The colors were not as bright as in the picture. I'm not sure how to wash?
3.0,"Dress is very beautiful. But the fabric is see through and certain underwear can be seen under through the dress. Longer than expected as well. But I'm 5'4 and have a short torso, that's most likely why it's a little longer. Other than the fact that it's thin around the bottom area, it's a beautiful dress and looks as pictured."
3.0,Nice bag but a little too orange in color.  Arrived with someone else'should belongings inside.  Returned it.
3.0,I returned them. Stones show larger online but small after I received them.
3.0,"The dress is so beautiful but the arms and shoulders are soooo tight, even if you size up. I don’t recommend for people like me with broad shoulders and strong arms"
3.0,"Love the idea of keeping glasses and sunglasses together. But this is not something I want to put in a purse, it's heavy and huge."
3.0,To hard to wear comfortably.... if only that part that makes contact with your head( luffys hat)  was made softer it would be comfortable.
3.0,doesn't fit just right
3.0,"Fits well and looks nice, but the material is too thin so it's practically see through so I always wear a sweater over it."
3.0,The necklace is so  pretty but I cant wear it :( It's so short and tight around my neck.. I'm really sad about it because it's gorgeous.
3.0,Feels really stiff.. I hope it softens up after wearing and washing a couple time.
3.0,Keeps getting caught in my hair.
3.0,Would size up a size for oversized feel
3.0,"Online it looks like it’s a actual twofer but nothing like that in person. Then while I could zip up the dress, I would need some type of shape wear because the dress is not forgiving especially in the tummy area. It did fall right before my knees which was a plus."
3.0,This vest is too short for my son<br />Due to several members of our family having the corona virus we were just able to have Christmas on Sunday January 31.  Now I can’t return it . PLEASE HELP
3.0,It is a nice watch but from the pictures it looks totally flat but it is not.
3.0,"This white dress was extremely see through. Even if its worn with nude colored spanx, you will see any outlines. Whatever is worn under it would need to be from chest to knees. The dress itself, however, is cut nicely and has a flowiness to it. It os very thin so its better suited to a summer or late spring dress."
3.0,"This headband is nice and comfortable once it's on. I had to stretch it out a little to actually get it over my head and keep it over part of my ears so it'll actually stay on. After wearing it for a few hours, I had to adjust it several times. I do, however, like the material. It goes with a lot in my wardrobe. I can wear this year round."
3.0,"This is a reasonably good sandal, but doesn't offer the foot support I expected from a Teva."
3.0,This top was very pretty. I did return it only because it was shorter in length that I expected. If you don't mind top that are this length I would recommend this product. This is just my personal preference.
3.0,Great product but it was to large for my husband and had to return. Unfortunately they didnt have any smaller sizes so I couldn't reorder.
3.0,I ordered a small (normally wear a 2) and its huge and also it is too big on my sister who normally wears 8-10. Possibly I was sent the wrong size but I have no way to tell because there is no size tag on the dress. It would be cute if it fit me.
3.0,"I used for a costume and it was very inexpensive, so for me it was ok that it doesn't work, however I  would have liked to be informed that it is not a true working compass."
3.0,"Love the cap, but not the goggles.  The goggles are too wide/big so they leave deep impressions on my cheeks after use."
3.0,Been wanting this for awhile and wanted it as a signature bracelet as I have RA. I don't wear it much sadly. The weight of the chunky chain is light and the clasp is hard to use so I need some ones help the out it on.
3.0,By the way its ok for this item because of the price of it and in good design . Ok
3.0,"Well it fits everywhere except my chest. Barely enough fabric for coverage. It’s actually a little big in the thighs, but like i said hardly covers the twins."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this belt. The buckle size makes it hard to thread through all but the largest belt loops. The only way to make it practical is to thread the belt itself, sans any buckle, through the belt loop, then thread it through the buckle and clamp the buckle down.<br /><br />At that point, the quick release can be used effectively to disconnect the belt, but for donning and taking the belt off, the quick release should NOT be used, but the clamp that the male end uses to clamp to the belt.<br /><br />Confused? exactly :) Troubleshooting using a belt is not a good sign.<br /><br />That aside, the finish on the male end of the buckle wore off just from a few connect and disconnects I did before even wearing it. It's not made me overly confident that this will be a great long-term use belt"
3.0,Wears large for a small size and I weigh 128lbs. but good material and I still wore to work
3.0,Fits weird and is really thick and heavy...
3.0,"not tight enough, I order a small. it not too big but it just dont fit right. The fabric feel cheap."
3.0,"This dress is inconsistent.  The army green, wine, and grey ones I got deserve 4.5 stars.  Their fabric is super soft, and they do not collect lint. They are a good length to wear over leggings, and I love the pockets!! The black one was marked large, but it ran a full size smaller. The material is also less soft. It doesn't even feel like the same dress. Also, it collects lint terribly!  I do not recommend this dress in black for cat or dog owners."
3.0,the first time i put the watch on the band broke so had to purchase new one and spend $15 to get another one...you need to put quality bands on these watches ...
3.0,"The gloves held up great for a day at a comic con. My complaint is that for some reason, the leather part of the gloves smell really bad"
3.0,Cute t shirt. Very thin material..I paid $25 only because a friend of mine (as a B-day) present. She loves Tweety bird. But this shirt is not worth the money.
3.0,"After one wash, it already has a hole in the side. It is a comfortable dress and can be worn business casual. I really hate that it wasn't made better."
3.0,"I tried the shirt in black after reading some other posts.  This shirt is very short, really almost a crop.  At 5'8'' this shirt was an inch or two above the waist band of my pants.  Its also extremely sheer, I could clearly see my belly button through the bottom panel.  I think on the right body type, this would be an extremely cute summer shirt.  On me not so much, I don't think I have the confidence for a crop top right now :)"
3.0,The scarfs stitching was way off.
3.0,These are super cute but quite heavy. I haven’t worn them as much because of this.
3.0,"The fabric is good. However, the neckline is a bit loose and the back is a bit low."
3.0,necklace came with four different pearls and a pearl bead along with two chains. But the back has changed color and I only wore it four times.
3.0,"The product is as I said okay, it was in packaging unopened and the voice chip worked just fine but I was disappointed to discover upon setting the time on the watch that the ticking hand only seems to work when I push in the time adjustment screw on the back, I'm not blaming the shipper, but it's kind of a bummer to say the least when something doesn't work just letting you know I was not fully satisfied"
3.0,"They didn't work for my glasses, but they were a last ditch effort.<br />  I'm sure they could work for someone else. Just too big for mine. But came speedily & well packaged."
3.0,"It's super smooth comfy fabric, very nice drape and appearance, but there is no way this is an XL. Also, it's not long. Long tops are the trend, and this stops too high, like right at the waist. It is definitely the design and not the fact that it is snug on me. I would not buy again, but it's not so annoying that I'm going to return it. I can layer it under things when my favorite turtleneck is in the wash."
3.0,Very small but realistic looking
3.0,Hem rolls up. Heavy material.
3.0,It was actually pink and not fuchsia
3.0,The steel looks like they were old and are not bright like in the picture.
3.0,"I bought this for a very formal event and could have pulled it off but for the poor finishing of the appliqué. The mesh was lifting up around the edges. I will say I normally wear a 20 and bought two sizes up - one would have been sufficient with the corseted back. I’m 6’1” and it was plenty long enough to get right past my ankles - I would be comfortable in modest heels with the length of the dress. Overall, I’d buy it for a semi-formal or party event but was concerned about the finishing. Pretty good for the price."
3.0,"I find the fit of this bra to be very odd.  The band fit as expected, and I do appreciate the tree hooks for added security and support, but the straps and cups do not fit me AT ALL.  (For reference: I typically wear a 32D and I ordered a 32C here for added snugness.)  The straps are adjustable, but the wider fabric sections that are obviously intended to sit on the top of the shoulders want to be a bit lower than my collar bones when the band is sitting well; to make the straps fit, the band needs to be on my breast tissue, effectively eliminating the support of the band altogether.  The cups are a bit loose on me at the center of my chest, there aren't and &#34;modesty petals&#34; (which isn't necessarily a problem, but you might want know), and the fabric, while breathable and mesh-like, has no stretch to hold me in.<br /><br />I bought this bra as a new high-impact bra for running, but it really does;t give me the support I'm looking for; it's fine for weightlifting, ellipticals, biking, etc.  I'm a bit disappointed in my experience of the product, especially as many other reviewers like it so much."
3.0,"The small bands are too small.  Fitbit original small bands fit perfectly but these are smaller.  Ordered the large bands and Large bands are a little big but do fit.  Unfortunately, one large band broke after wearing for about 2 weeks.  I bought a pack of two and just started wearing the other large band.  Will see how long this one lasts."
3.0,"I was really happy how these looked when I first received them in the mail, but when my boyfriend opened the box for his anniversary present, the wood part of one of the links came off of its metal base :( I'll probably just super glue them back together, but a bit disappointing that they fell apart before he even touched them!"
3.0,"Good piece but not strong enough cut to catch my waist. Great fit else where, color was true and decent quality. Square cut"
3.0,Only comes with 1 earring
3.0,"Love the chance to add some new drama to my wardrobe for not a lot of money. I didnt expect, for the price that it would be constructed to last forever."
3.0,"I bought this tankini specifically for our trip to Hawaii because we planned on going stand up paddle boarding and I wanted something that would keep me in. I wear a size 8-10 and ordered the large.  It fit well except for the solid panel on the top portion was too long on me so it bagged at the bottom (I'm 5'3&#34;).  So, it wasn't necessarily flattering on me but it worked very well for the SUP lesson, keeping everything in and covering my midsection."
3.0,"So far so good. Good length and color. We'll see how it holds up with use. Past nylon straps have had issues with stretching, both in the length, and in th hole used by the clasp. didn't get the tool or springbars, so if that's a factor for you, be careful. I had a tool, and didn't screw up my bars, but would have liked a back-up set, as I did nearly lose one under the couch."
3.0,Loved the dress and color but WOW-I order an XXL and it was the size of a M.  I was so disappointed but my sister in law was excited because I gave it to her.
3.0,Beautiful colors.  Fit is wierd
3.0,"Very nice leather - feels and smells like the real thing (in case you’re wondering if it really is). I like that it doesn’t have stitching. Matched my wallet perfectly. Color in the photo was fairly close to reality.<br />UPDATE: unfortunately the quality of the hardware is not great. A part of the hook just fell off while inside of my bag in a compartment by itself, so hardly because of any excess stress on it. I really wanted to live this but I took two stars off for breaking so quickly."
3.0,"Pretty assortment of bead colors, but tight on my small wrists."
3.0,Meh. The color wasn't as bright and vibrant as the picture. Also it fit loose under the arms. Returned it.
3.0,"It’s cute, but the first one I purchased had a tear in it after one wear, so I exchanged it and the second one had a button pop in the back. Other than that it’s cute and it’s double lines so it doesn’t look cheap."
3.0,Cute shirt and comfortable fit as expected. But really shrunk after washed.
3.0,Very very thin. It is about as see through as pantyhose
3.0,"Overall this apron gets the job done, but it’s not my favorite. I bought this apron because I really like lemon print. The price was really reasonable so I figured I would give it a try. The material reminds me of thick linen. It is not soft like cotton, but it is smooth. The stitching is not the best on the apron. There is a lot of extra thread that you have to be careful won’t unravel. The one thing I really don’t like is the teetrum slogan on the front pocket. I assumed that was just the model picture, but it seems like all of the aprons come with it."
3.0,I loved this earring because of what it is! however it did not stay on well and eventually I was unable to find it again after it fell off. I want another but refuse to pay the price just to lose it again!
3.0,"I give this onesie zero stars fir the product, because the print was placed way too low on the material, but three stars for the seller’s customer service."
3.0,"I ordered this for my daughter and although they are cute, they are not good quality. The stitches on the straps are coming off. My daughter wore them for maybe 5 times?"
3.0,"A bit bigger than I expected. Also, one wing is forward, the other is backwards once you twist it on"
3.0,"Otherwise my son n hasn't worn it yet do yet to see  if it was worth the purchase. I thought I was getting 2 belts. Had in my card to get but husband,  but will opt to get a different set"
3.0,very pretty just wish it was bigger.
3.0,"The size and fit were just perfect. I wanted something loose that came up to just above the knees. (I'm 5'2"" for reference.) The material feels synthetic, but it's light and comfortable. The one glaring issue I have with these shorts is the waist band. The thick elastic band flips in and down every time I pull the shorts off and put them back on."
3.0,I really like these earrings. They're cute and I like that the pack comes with some shapes that'll look nice in my helix piercings and on my normal lobe piercings. The only downside is instead of two leafs I got a leaf and this plus sign design so I can't wear it as a set :/
3.0,It was okay. I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas because she loves Lord of The Rings. One of the jewels fell off. She is gonna fix it.
3.0,"Too tight for my Mom's edema. She cut on pair off. Nurse said they should be tighter, but these were too tight when she had a flare up. She ended up with creases in her upper legs. Got to touch base with the nurse about this, may just need different size or different type that are longer? Not sure. Good quality though! I may try them myself!"
3.0,Nice design but material feels cheap
3.0,"After reading mixed reviews, I decided to order a M which would be my typical size. I couldn’t get it up over my hips. I then ordered a L and XL. The L went over my hips but didn’t fit comfortably. It was still a bit tighter than I’d like it to be. The XL fits and I think after washing it, it’ll be an even nicer fit. It is a very cute skirt. However, the button on all three skirts received is very wobbly and I’m expecting it to fall off very quickly. I am almost always a size 6 in jeans/pants. For the price and cuteness, I’d suggest this item. Be aware though that it may come way too small and the button will possibly be flimsy."
3.0,"I normally wear a US size S, but after reading some mixed reviews, I ordered the medium. The Medium is kind of large around my shoulders and the sleeves are longer than expected. Also, it is quite long for a top. Being 5'4&#34;, it comes down to my mid-thigh and I could easily wear it as a dress. All of that being said, the material is good quality and thick- might be good for housework or yoga. The material is also some % Spandex. To make it shrink and fit me better, I washed and dried it for about 20 minutes and it fits more like a small would."
3.0,"After a year and a half, both loops are broken and the leather is cracking around the holes.<br /><br />I take this watch off to shower but do wear it when I exercise (about once a week on average), yet this watch band has still become quite distressed.<br /><br />It’s sporty in how it looks but now how it’s built."
3.0,The dress is pretty just not true to size. It runs 3 sizes smallers.
3.0,"Hooks were used for securing water buckets to hooks for horses. After an extremely short time, the clasps broke and made the clips unusable.  I would suggest purchasing a better quality product"
3.0,"Washed once inside out in cold water and hung to dry. Graphic already peeling. Hoodie is nice though, so I'll likely peel graphic off and use my Silhouette to add something else."
3.0,"Super cute, but were to small"
3.0,"The band and overall quality of the watch feels really good. The band feels a little bit harder than the usual plastic you get on other watches of the same type. Which is good, still bends and feels durable. It looks really nice as well and doesn't look or feel cheap.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is the watch face is really dim. You basically have to view it close to the face and the right angle to see the numbers. Thankfully it has a backlight, which isn't that bright itself. If the backlight was on at all times, it would be perfect."
3.0,Loved the pattern but ran small
3.0,"For reference, I'm 5'5 125 lbs large bust small butt, and the M fit perfectly. I like the material and color. HOWEVER, it did not come with the tie belt. I messaged the company, and they couldn't send just the tie in the mail. I love this jumpsuit, but I'll have to return it. Keep in mind, the tie might not show up!"
3.0,This woman's lace baby doll set was way too small. The set is advertised as a one size fits all but when it came the package was marked size Medium. The sizing range chart was incorrect. However this top is very cute the lace is nice and the breast area is sexy. The baby doll has a nice sheer cream colored material that lays out with an opening in the front. The back has a bra style hinge on the back with an eye hole opening. The panties are very thin and are g string style. The set did not work for me but I do appreciate he look and style of it although it's rather thin and I don't see it lasting for longer then a photo or one time use piece.<br /><br />I did recieve this baby doll outfit at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the product.
3.0,Flimsy fabric.  But wearable.
3.0,Don’t breathe
3.0,Quality is good but sizing is off. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it was still a touch small.
3.0,fairly comfortable and well padded but make a lot of noise when walking.  Sole material maybe a little to hard.
3.0,After few weeks the color starts to fade.
3.0,Cute earrings. I love these earrings but after two wears you can tell the color is starting to fade away from being gold.
3.0,Disappointed that the flowers were not as well defined as they appear to be in the photo. It is just a very simple ring.
3.0,Way too small for a tall American woman who normally wears XL shirts.
3.0,These are pretty small and don't seem like they will hold up well. But for the money i will be happy as long as they last the summer.
3.0,Came about a size and a half too large.
3.0,These seem thin and kind of loose fitting. I have to keep adjusting to stay on my face. Feels like cheap t-shirt material.
3.0,It’s cute just I don’t have boobs so it’s a little big and the bottoms are a thong.
3.0,sleeves are too small. I ordered a large. sleeves fit like a medium. I'm 6'2&#34; 210 LBS and a large is too small. I wear this with the sleeves rolled up.
3.0,"I wear a 36B so I ordered it that size. And I mean, it does fit. It just doesn't cover well. A cute bra, but could use some work."
3.0,Purchased for my 7 yr old who loves the move.. it's not a child's size. It's too big for anyone younger than teens.
3.0,The case is very nice. It is the right size and the colors make it pop. There is only one thing i do not like about the cases and that is it's hard to open initially. I actually had to cut the case some to loosen up the latch to get inside of the case.
3.0,The sewing & material is good.  The sizing was off for me.
3.0,"This is a really cute one piece swimming suit , really good quality, but unfortunately I am a long torso woman and the upper part wouldn’t stay in place."
3.0,The material is good and it fit as expected but the bottom part was uneven. The size was noticeably longer than the other and it was a defect. The sash was missing. Had to return today.
3.0,Fits as expected and washes easily!
3.0,"These are beautiful and worked perfect for my Egyptian Goddess shoot!!! But whenever id walk in them, they would break everyonce in a while. Also, had to take an entire part out by my toe. I'm a size 8 and they were far too large. It you're a size 12 they may fit."
3.0,"I thought this was supposed to be water resistant but whenever I wash my hands, the glass fogs up, preventing me from<br />seeing the numbers.  It's a little disappointing."
3.0,"These are very cute dresses & I have them in 3 colors now, but it took a ridiculous amount of returning & reordering to get ones that fit.  Their sizing is ridiculously inconsistent. I usually wear a L & I have everything from a M to an XL in these now. This burgundy was the most recent purchase.  I ordered the L & it was a good 3 inches shorter than one of the others I have in a L.  Sent it back for the XL, and the XL i even shorter - does not cover my bum.  If you are ok with knowing you will have to exchange, exchange, exchange until you get the right fit, then proceed with ordering!  It is a very cute dress once you get one that fits, but it's gonna take some time!"
3.0,there are unfinished corners...odd...pieces of yarn sticking out...and an elasticstrip<br />(hate to complain...but it really is strange...like a first time project of some knitter)
3.0,Don't wear it against your neck if you're going to be sweating. My neck was irritated and the metal tarnished.
3.0,i wear a 13 was kinda tight but only use them for a couple minutes everyday...GREAT gym shower shoe!
3.0,"I was hoping this would be bigger and longer than it actually is. I got a 2xl but in my opinion it fits more like an xl. It is soft and cozy material, I just wish it was loose fitting. It’s also a loose knit so you may want to wear a tank top underneath."
3.0,Kind of cheap looking for what I paid.
3.0,It is good if your glasses are large. Smaller glasses bounce around as the case is big. My case fell apart after using it for 3 months.
3.0,I wear 11 in Nike and 10.5 in all other brands.  I have average width feet and have never ordered a wide shoe. I got a pair of these in size 11 and can barely get my foot all the way in the sandal. I don't know how people can even begin to say that these are true to size...unless I got a faulty pair. I'm going to the store to see if I got a size 12 before I reorder.
3.0,They broke after about 6 months. But they were cheap so....
3.0,"Like the watch very much, only thing the band holder does not hold the band"
3.0,"I work outdoors all year. These lasted literally one week before blowing out almost all the fingertips. These are NOT work gloves, zero durability. However, they are quite warm so if you're just trying not to freeze your fingers off while hiking/snowshoeing in sub-zero weather without really using your hands these might be suitable for you."
3.0,Well I only purchased this hat because I thought I lost a hat of the same type and later on found it… but it was not at all like the hat I purchased and assumed I lost. Same shape but different material that’s didn’t give the same look as my other hat.
3.0,The elastic on the waist was never the same after being washed
3.0,colors are nice...so that is why I kept it has stretch...but just waaayyy short. right under my butt....on the fence about this one
3.0,Shirt is really nice but fits bigger than I would prefer. Going down a size would likely be too small but I don't like the way it looks as is. It's really disappointing.
3.0,"Nice material but pretty small in the back, so if yoy have a with back be careful , also I the front part doesn’t fit very well .<br />I might return"
3.0,"When i order Thin cotton socks, i expect just that, not always socks with elasticity!"
3.0,"These socks are very thin, more of a dress sock with a weird bumpy sole that is supposed to be the cushioned part. When you put them on this ""cushioned"" part stretches out to be almost as thin as the rest of the sock. Also, the bumpy material is not very comfortable if you have tender feet like I do. I would call this more of a compression ankle sock than a cushioned running sock. They fit very tight on my foot and ankle. I wear a size 9 in women's shoe size so I ordered the 8-11 size. They were plenty long enough, the heel portion of the sock came up past the back of my heel but they were not comfortable at all."
3.0,"Really nice looking, but material snags and runs waaaay too easy considering the intended use!"
3.0,This did not come even close to fitting my son. So I suggest ordering a few sizes up.
3.0,Decent shoe for the price I don't think I'd go stepping on any nails with them looks more like maybe for pushing Nails over and the shoe laces broke the very first time I tried to adjust them so I had to put standard shoelaces in.
3.0,"The cuff was very tight on my ear. I had to return it. It would be fine for a small person. Otherwise, a very cute adornment!"
3.0,"I purchased these shoes because of the style. The run a bit big on my daughter. I recd them fast, in good condition."
3.0,I ended up returning it because the top was too small and the bottom was too big. It would be nice to be able to mix and match sizes to accomodate different body types.
3.0,"Looks great ears started getting sore after two days,can wear them constantly."
3.0,This product is not as large as expected.  I expected it to be large enough to wrap around and protect the sides of the eyes too.
3.0,"Red, Green and white pendant trays have small rhinetones missing. Unfortunately  I can not place the Cabochons in the trays and sell them with missing stones."
3.0,Very cute and comfy but was so large it seemed like a night gown. Exchanged for a smaller size.
3.0,Pin and needle broke off as of today... :'(<br />Minus two stars!
3.0,To small. I should have ordered the larger size.
3.0,It is way too large. I normally wear a small. It fit like a large☹️
3.0,"The wallet is a bit misleading.  It says that it can hold a 6 or 6+ I Phone but it can not.  I have a smaller phone and it is the only thing that can fit in the clutch..If you are looking for a phone case then this is it, but if you are looking for a wallet and a phone case then look else where for your purchase."
3.0,"I purchased these for my husband, he says they are too short."
3.0,I bought these because I have a pair of black Bandolino pumps with a slightly shorter heel and they are my favorite dress shoes. These are not nearly as comfortable. I wish I could return them.
3.0,Kinda small for bigger earpieces and pretty small in general
3.0,I didn’t realize it was 2014 hat not current year but hubby still liked it
3.0,"After sleeping in these for two nights and one wash, the seems are coming apart! My son loves these he was so upset when I said that I had to sew them because they are coming apart. This should not be happening this early. Unfortunately we won’t be ordering more!"
3.0,"I purchased this the other day when Amazon had lowered the price, I found it through some deal site. I thought it was really cute. The only bad thing is the string bracelets are too small for me to wear. They are made for a baby. I guess I must have overlooked that part since I was just looking at the pin, not the ribbons. So, oh well, I guess I'm stuck with a useless piece of ribbon that is only going to sit and collect dust!"
3.0,"This sweater is super cute, however. I have D cups and this sweater barely covered my bra. It’s way more cropped than your average crop top. Buying a size up just made the sleeves longer, not the shirt length itself. I prefer my crop tops to sit right at waistline / pant line. this was def way too short for that."
3.0,"Material is thin, you can use this as a bathing suit cover up"
3.0,Product sent is exactly as pictured but runs small for size it claims to be according to size chart.
3.0,I did not like it on me but I have a smaller waistline so it just was not a good fit on me. dress was pretty.
3.0,"I'm still not sure of the mixed colors. I have too many &#34;real&#34; rings, so not sure if I'm keeping this one."
3.0,"Item okay, but I was expecting the detail and packaging to be a little better.  I'm going to call this product Average."
3.0,should have let me choose two five packs instead of giving me the same two. Would like more of a variety.
3.0,"Scratched really easy, became ugly in the first 3 days I had it.  I continued to use it any way at work and it fell off and lost it. If o buy another it won't be this brand"
3.0,"My daughter wanted this, bought us out of hesitation and it’s a okay product. If your on a heavier side, don’t bother getting this. It’s not meant for big hands and you have to be careful wearing it. If not, the stretch can tear."
3.0,Tight in the armpits and super long. Bought the size I would normally wear based on measurements and should have bought a size or two up. Super cute and realistic though!
3.0,"Very small piece of moldavite for this price if it really is... no certificate, and the piece is so tiny so its anyone's guess. but the person i got it for likes it fine so that is all that counts"
3.0,Beautiful shirts but not true to size. I have a petite toddler currently wearing 3T and these were too small. The material is stiff and not suitable for a toddler’s comfort . I returned the shirts.
3.0,They are ok.... not great not bad. You get what you pair for..
3.0,"Well made,  great color, just to small,  I first tried it on and liked it,  but when the day came to wear it,  I threw it on, and felt like it was just too short, and I'm only 5'2."
3.0,"The material is very thin so it shows every lump and bump and panty line.  It is really comfortable though.  IT's a nice dress and I wear it around the house and in the yard during the summer.<br /><br />UPDATE: this is Feb 2019 and I purchased this back in the summer 2017. The item has held up well as far as color and stitching but the fabric has pilled and is very rough. If I had a sweater shaver and could shave the entire dress, it would continue to be comfortable.  This pills after about 6 moths of washes."
3.0,No son lo q esperaba
3.0,"Hard to focus, not impressed."
3.0,Stone is much larger than appears in photo. Doesn’t look like photo. I know I didn’t pay much but really disappointed in what showed up.
3.0,I bought two pair of boot cut danskin yoga pants at Walmart.  They have worn like iron and haven't shrunk.  apparently they don't make them anymore.  This pair is a poor quality fabric and I'm already seeing that they won't wash or wear like my previous purchase.  They are okay and that is on the generous side for an evaluation.
3.0,"the color isn't as referent as the picture, & the material is very slippery."
3.0,"Item arrived I'm plastic bag, looked like it had been tossed around. Will try product and see how well it does. Very thin material."
3.0,I purchased for a gift and it wasn't quite as nice as I had hoped. I purchased for men and it really was a bit too delicate.
3.0,"I liked it very much, especially the personalized writing. it came as shown, it was a bit too big for the person's hand but that can be adjusted so i was fine with that."
3.0,Thought it would have side openings.
3.0,"My child wears a 6 so I ordered a 7/8 with the understanding the slippers run small.  These run very small indeed--more like a 4/5.  They're very cute though, so we reordered the largest size, and will keep these for her baby sister."
3.0,"Great product! I've ordered several pairs through this seller! My biggest complaint is that the backs to the earrings don't fit tight enough and I've lost several earrings due to this defect. I have to constantly remind myself to check my ears throughout the day to try to catch the backs before they fall off. Otherwise, it's a great product."
3.0,It's not tapered at the waist.
3.0,Cute and soft..but did not fit as expected
3.0,Charms are as pictured but they didn’t come in there own bag or case. They were literally just thrown in a shipping envelope. They are a Christmas present so I’ll need to purchase a case for them now.
3.0,Runs small. The grass skirt has flowers on top near the band... seems like it was a random skirt  Cheap made but can't expect much from a Halloween costume. I'm 5'5&#34; and 180... I bought a XXL and DD chest and the top doesn't fit. But it's nothing I can't fix with a little sewing. Still worth the price!
3.0,I love the idea of this chain.  The first wearing was the best.  It's very long so I would not recommend if you have small hands.  My biggest disappointment was how quickly it discolored.  It's also very difficult to put on to the proper fitting by yourself.
3.0,got this for a present it looks so good. not something me personally would wear but i know the person will love it.. the package was in great conduction  the necklace was safe and sound.
3.0,"These little flip flops are adorable.  They are super sturdy and well made.  HOWEVER, they are made about 2 sizes too small.  Definitely returning for a larger size."
3.0,"Size 8. After read all the reviews, bought xs. A little bit too small. Should get small."
3.0,"This was a nice package for a good price, but when I wore it I realized the brim was put on crooked."
3.0,I like these earrings but one of the black ones was broken. One of the corners was missing...
3.0,"I didn't like the feel of the fabric. To me it felt too thick, foamly-like and just yuck!<br />I returned the skirt."
3.0,Very nice but 1 big pearl from the front is missing. It is very noticeable so I will not be wearing it.
3.0,"I ordered a 34 waist size in these shorts, however the waste was exceptionally small but the legs but and thighs fit well. The only thing I can say is that the shorts had a very weird fit"
3.0,"But not a fine watch.  It’s stiff, uncomfortable and feels kinda cheap."
3.0,Purchased on promo. Good price for 3 pairs of gloves and good quality. They are cute and fit nicely however they don't keep hands warm. I was outside for about 20 minutes in 20° degree weather and my hands were freezing. Disappointed.
3.0,"The material is very weird and does not flow at all. I was so excited for how it looked in the picture, but it just sort of lays stiffly while wearing. But, it's a nice dress for the price."
3.0,Agarra bien la cara su sistema de ajuste es fácil.<br />Pero NO se ve claro bajo el agua. ☹️<br />Puedo comparar porque tengo otras más viejas con las que se ve excelente bajo el agua.<br />Quisiera devolverlas.
3.0,It's exactly what I suspected
3.0,The title for this product has changed but I had bought this as a slim tie and received a skinny tie. I had not been a fan of skinny ties since my perception of them are childish but I'm kind of happy that it had caused me to try it and kinda like it. It is now a tie to use whenever I want to change things up. Unfortunately most of my tie bars are too long but it's nice with a waistcoat.
3.0,They aren’t super comfortable like I would want in a watch band
3.0,My sweater was only mid thigh length and I am only 5ft tall. But the color was perfect.
3.0,Adorable earrings!  Unfortunately one of the backs came off in 24 hours and we lost the whole earring :(
3.0,"Great gag party glasses, fun gift. Definitely for a narrow head."
3.0,Leaks and not a big fan of the straps being attached in the back. I didnt know but I guess I put one under my hair bun and one on the top normally. Having one fat strap in the back doesn't work for me
3.0,Fits someone snug around shoulders.....it however stays in place
3.0,Shoes run small
3.0,"I am 5'9"" plus long waisted and this shirt did not flatter me at all. It looks cute on shorter people for sure, but did not look nice or fall in the right places."
3.0,"I love it! It's just a little long for me, but I'm 5'0&#34; so that may be why.. But all I did was tie it with a rubber band and it looks cute."
3.0,"It’s a cute suit, I didn’t end up keeping it as the color didn’t workout for what I wanted. The white isn’t a pure white, more of a dingy grey white. However, other colors may be perfect and the suit itself is great quality, it is thicker fabric and holds everything in."
3.0,The material of this shirt is very nice. Since it looked slim fitting I ordered a L instead of my usual M. I would be happier with an XL
3.0,I love the concept and the look but they are too long and hang down on my neck. I wanted something to secure my sunglasses to my head while cycling. Need to be able to shorten the cables or make a smaller version.
3.0,"I really liked the prayer that is engraved on the back of this dog tag. However, It looked nothing like the picture shown. It was not black and silver. It was simply all silver so you could hardly read the prayer. It did state that it would be Chrome in the small details so pay attention. I also did not receive the chain that was suppose to come with this product. I'm not going to send it back just because of a missing chain but don't be mislead that your product will be the color that this picture says. I purchased this for a police officer and overall, I am happy with the wording."
3.0,"I got a 2x for my husband, which is his usual size and it was definitely too small. But the shirt itself, was a good fabric and perfect for the occasion we needed it for."
3.0,"Overall they are nice, 3 out of 13 handkerchiefs, the stitching is off on the circle around the letter."
3.0,These dresses are very comfortable.  The issue is the pockets are very small and the necklines don't hold their shape.  These will work for everyday around the house but that is about it.
3.0,I so wanted to love this but the fit was really weird as was the material. The print was nice as was the length. The neck area was off.
3.0,chips. scratches easily.
3.0,"I hate to be the sole dissenting opinion on here, but I don't love this dress. It didn't look bad on, but it definitely lacked that wow factor. I got the navy blue because I liked that the arms and the back were the same color as the front instead of being black like in the other colors. But this shade of blue is so dark that it looked a little drab. Another color, like the red, would have popped more. The style of the dress looked almost matronly on me. Or maybe it was too loose? I followed the size chart provided by Miusol and not the Amazon one. The dress didn't hug my body and give me that nice hourglass shape like on the model and in the pictures other users posted. I'm also not very tall at 5'4 so the dress when about an inch past my knee, which didn't help the matronly factor even with heels. I don't have a large chest so the neckline didn't do anything for me either. It was just...underwhelming. I'll think about it some more before deciding whether to return."
3.0,I really liked it except it was way too small around the arms. Super cute and loved the color but was too small.
3.0,I wanted a simple pearl necklace. I wish I would have bought a smaller pearl size but it is okay.
3.0,Order a size to a size and a half bigger. My size is too small I need a bigger size
3.0,It doesn't fit a full figured woman... Had to give to daughter...
3.0,"Quality Review- The Good: I bought this jacket over a year and a half ago. I love the style, fit, and warmth of the jacket. I wear it with almost all of my casual fall/spring gear. The Bad: The elbows wore out in a year. I like it so much that I'm probably going to buy patches for them instead of buying another jacket because the manufacturer doesn't deserve my money twice if they couldn't get this one thing right once."
3.0,Loved the fabric & length but it was too baggy i'n the stomach for me.
3.0,This is a nice hoodie i got like a double xl so i can wear it with no pants. Lighter nice for summer/ spring nights. It did however smell like stink bugs EXACTLY like a stink bug idk why it looked clean but i had to take it off to wash it cuz MAN... it SMELLED.
3.0,"When I first opened the package and saw how small the dress looked, I thought It would never fit me but it did because it is very stretchy!!<br /><br />I like that the shoulders stay down how they’re supposed to.<br />The drawstring is actually functional so I lengthened it as much as I possibly could.<br /><br />The fabric is on the thin side and it tends to ride up in the back because of the booty.<br /><br />I got a medium and the overall fit was good but a little short on me. For reference, I’m 5’ 4”, 32C-29-38.<br /><br />I’ll be wearing this to lounge around in or to the beach 🏖!"
3.0,"I was a little disappointed that these earrings are so small, they are pretty."
3.0,"Comfortable fit. Great for lounging. Not sure about the wicking performance. Maybe I need to try with different shoes. I am on my feet all day for work. Walking between 5-10miles per day. I also have feet that perspire quite a bit. I find at the end of the day these socks feel much wetter than most of my other socks. They are comfy so I wear them around home, or for short light duty situations, but I can’t wear for work, or vigorous activity as I feel my feet stay too moist. Maybe if used with a liner sock would keep the moisture off better?"
3.0,"style is great, fit is good,overall just average"
3.0,description indicated it would be a zippered pouch. It was not. Smaller than expected. Just ok. Do not love it. Would not purchase again or reccomend purchase. Disappointed.
3.0,It is a beautiful print! The material is not what I thought it wod be. It is not a cotton Hoodie. But still very pretty print!
3.0,Don't get this if you have large boobs!! I couldn't even zip it up after putting it on. The material was very thin and the dress was so short!
3.0,"While this size Small fits her well, the fabric is too thick to be comfortable on the golf course!<br />It’s not lightweight, cool cotton & it’s not any of the dryfit or climacool blends - it’s a medium to heavy weight cotton that will only look nice again if you iron or steam it after washing.<br />The short sleeves length is close to cap sleeves on her & I’d prefer them an inch or so longer.<br />[SIZE REFERENCE]:<br />She’s 5’2”, 105 lbs & typically wears size XS or S and 2/4. I ordered this in size Small & the overall fit is just right. The Dark Purple is a deep, rich color & the overall design is classic polo. It’s made well & sized well but the fabric is not a favorite for our needs.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this & I hope it’s Helpful!**"
3.0,"It' to small, looked bigger  in the picture."
3.0,the advertise show its quality right
3.0,Cool camo design. But I didn't find the quality of the frames to be that durable. I've already had one pair crack.
3.0,"I expected something of hire quality. It's ok, not great."
3.0,"Lights are cute, but cheaply made. About 10% of them never worked when they first arrived. Fun, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,Red part of the sweater bleeds to the white part.
3.0,This fits a little small. If you like a tight fit go with your normal size. If you like it a little lose go a size up.
3.0,"The good part is the purple color is vibrant!  The material feels silky.  The bad part is it is not good material & when I opened<br />package, my chipped fingernail snagged on material.  I work with my hands, so I always have chips & this is not good. I also<br />had to cut several. strings.  I am not sure how long it will  last, especially after washing.  I also wrote it fits ok, but actually<br />I am a size 6 & bought the M (8-10) & it is just a bit large, which is good.  It hits just above the knee at my 5'6&#34;.  I would not<br />buy this one again for everyday wear."
3.0,It's not exactly like the necklace in the drama…<br />There's no JJ on the back.<br />But I still like it a lot.
3.0,"Very comfortable and warm sweatpants, but oddly proportioned. The elastic on the waste is surprisingly tight, while the legs are extremely long. Works fine around the house, but way too long to wear around."
3.0,I never ordered this???
3.0,it looks exactly like the pic. the only issue is the petticoat pokes you a little
3.0,"They're ok, not as oversized as I thought. Actually they're just regular size."
3.0,Frays esasly buy larger then you would
3.0,It doesn’t look like the picture to me. It actually reminds me of something I’d wear in the early 2000s.
3.0,"beautiful bracelet, a shame they are becoming tarnish so soon."
3.0,"It's as heavy as people describe but it's looks almost yellow, it does not look like real gold at all. I don't know if that's because it's new, if it changes to a more natural color over time I'll update."
3.0,"Pretty but not the exact color I was looking for. Soft fabric, well made. Did not care for the detail in the back. Amazon does not pay for return shipping. Be warned. I am still trying to get my $ back!"
3.0,Really cute shirt- looks nothing like the model pictured. Lol but I got a large and it fits fine. Love the sleeves- thumb holes makes it even better.
3.0,"Nice bright pretty pattern, I ordered up per other comments and it is pretty much a tent on me..but, super comfortable. I just wont be wearing it to show off my figure."
3.0,"Very disappointed. I order a size and a half bigger so my little one would be able to wear these longer. They come and they fit just right. What????? Not true to size. They run verrrry small. Also, not a slip on shoe. Not happy. Cute but very sad because I bought 4 pairs."
3.0,"Canvas is good quality, but the straps keep coming unbuckled every time you set it down and pick it back up.  I'll keep it and maybe add a little super glue to the buckles."
3.0,I felt the dress fit weird and was very big for the size.  We are going to try to take it in but would have like it better to have opened it and been able to wear it.
3.0,i don't actually know why i bought this lol. looks good though
3.0,"This earring is super cute. However, it’s listed as being a 16G and is most definitely an 18G. I wanted it for my daith but since it’s so small and I don’t want to go down a size to later have to gauge it l, I found another ear hole to try it out in instead :("
3.0,"I thought this fabric was a different soft fabric based on the pattern of it. It is actually a cotton T-shirt feel with no stretch. It seemed a little stretchier in the photos and baggier but this is cut more like a low shoulder T, not an off the shoulder shirt like the photos. Completely different from what I expected but with that said, I don't hate it. It's an ok shirt so I'm going to hang on to it."
3.0,Not worth $99.00.. Maybe $29.00..
3.0,"I know each of these are individually produced, so it all comes down to where the gold leaf inside the glass ends up.  It can be spread out as in the picture, or it can be sort of in a lump toward the edge.  (The matching earrings were very nice, in fact.)"
3.0,"Not the most comfortable bracelet. It can be buttoned to either of two buttons, one of which was too large for my wrist and the other was too tight. Good looking bracelet but just not comfortable to wear."
3.0,"Chain broke after only a few days' wear. Disappointed, because it was a nice necklace."
3.0,"Okay, but a little big as I have small hands. Needs to be adjustable for women with larger or smaller hands."
3.0,Cute ....but as with clothing ordered online...you take a chance on fit.  I would recommend it.....cute suit!
3.0,"It was a little deformed upon arrival which was disappointing, but I still rocked it! Even sport it to a Got7 concert lol"
3.0,"Love the color, love the feel of the fabric, but... it wrinkles way to easy and it is extremely hard to get the wrinkles out."
3.0,"I wanted this so bad, but it was waaaay to small for me. Fit a friend perfectly tho, so at least it worked for someone!<br /><br />If i was able to find this in a version that would fit, i would buy it again. But not sure that that will happen"
3.0,Color is nice.  No package slip in package.  Therefore unable to return product.
3.0,"It runs small, especially in the arms. It's a great product but you need to size up"
3.0,I love the color<br />Wish it came the next size up
3.0,The imagine appeared much larger than it actually is in person.
3.0,"While the material and concept behind this gaitor is great, it does not fit all!  It fit my husband perfectly and he is average size, loved the material which seemed lightweight and comfortable.  I had hoped to get one as well, but when I tried it on, it actually fell down around my neck and would not stay up.  My face and head are not overly small but it just did not fit at all, disappointed as I loved the coverage it would have provided."
3.0,For the price it was fine
3.0,"I returned this dress today on Jan 31,2017  for I found a open tear under my right armpit so I have to return it. I need a refund asap please.it is a nice dress."
3.0,"I’m on the fence about whether I’m keeping these. The belly is weirdly poofy and they’re a bit too long, so they’re not the most flattering things in the world. Maybe a size smaller would be better? Folding down the elastic waist helps. On the plus side they’re really comfortable. Plenty of room in the hips and thighs which is something I need! I happen to like the flimsy material which will be wonderful in hot weather and (I suspect) would dry quickly. It’s not the kind of flimsy material that’s see-through or easy to wrinkle."
3.0,It's is okay.
3.0,"Cute earrings, not for those with sensitive ear though."
3.0,"I had to return because it did not fit my Iwatch as advertised. The metal connection pieces were too long and stuck out of the watch. Otherwise, its a great quality band for a great price."
3.0,Arm straps don’t fit at shoulder height and the over the shoulder strap broke after a month of use. Got a ton of complements on the look but I am a little disappointed with how it held up
3.0,Sadly with these prints placement is everything having 2 giant circles over my breasts isn’t a good look!! The other multi color looked like tie dye instead of a print
3.0,It runs about a 1inch too big.  I like them I wear them. the lions are soooooo big.  my cat is cautious around them.  I call them the twins.
3.0,The shirt is a good material and will not rip anymore than it already is; but the holes are so far over that it shows the tip of your bra!
3.0,Nice big shades but frame cracked above the left lens.  They were treated gently so not sure why they broke so easily.  Wish they were better quality but for the price its hard to complain to much.
3.0,It’s ok color blue is more like a gray...
3.0,"charger and 18650 cell seem bad, light works ok"
3.0,Size is good. Quality is okay. It’s already fading where the credit cards go. Decent product but I’d look into something else next time
3.0,"These earrings are very cute! However, on the pair I received, the pineapples are in different positions on the discs, not centered like in the pictures. They are still wearable, but it was a little disappointing. The quality of the stitching and the rattan is good so if the two earrings were the same, they would be 5 stars."
3.0,"Product is ok, but smell is very bad. Smells like smoke. Had to air it out. Thank you febreeze!"
3.0,"I normally wear XL as loose fit. However, the XL i received could literally be a night gown.<br /><br />The material and quality is great. Just wish it was true to size."
3.0,Fit to large
3.0,"I bought a size medium due to other reviews saying they run small. I’m about a 26” waist and they were super loose and bunchy in the crouch area. The quality is good, they’re soft but the lace border is not as wide as I thought it would be, it’s about 1/4” inch. I bought them to wear under my skirt/dresses for work but they kind of feel more like granny panties"
3.0,A bit too small to fit everything you need. But great product
3.0,I had ordered two of these and have only received one but it says that both have been delivered
3.0,It runs very small. I would definitely size up.
3.0,"I am giving 3 stars as to not effect the overall rating because I don’t think that would be fair. I am very large chested.. 38M so I sorta knew these would be too small but for the price, I thought why not give the largest size a try? I like my sports bras to fit very very tightly anyway just to make sure everything stays giggle free when I’m exercising. Well, they weren’t tight at all. In fact the band size was probably too big but the boobies are not even 1/4 way covered. Booo! I guess us big chested girls just need to deal with the fact that if we want to exercise, we have to drop at least $60 for ONE bra. I’d post a picture but that would be extremely inappropriate."
3.0,Its too large
3.0,"The earrings look very nice on the card. They are darker than I expected, but I like the color.  I only put one on to know it wasn't my style.  The bead is very flat,  so it looks like I am wearing gauges rather than earrings.  However, if you like that look, they are beautiful.  The beads have a nice shine and are well shaped."
3.0,"The dress looks like the picture for the most part. The fringe stands out as the fabric of the dress is more of a dark cream almost light tan. It fits well but it's not very form fitting so it's not as flattering as I had expected. So,<br />I won't be wearing it for new years but I will save it for Halloween. Some of the beading was loose but overall the beading looks very nice."
3.0,"I really like this top!  The material is not too thin and the it is quite soft. However, I am sending back because the sleeves are way too long and the sleeve cut feels quite sloppy. Disappointed because I really like it otherwise!"
3.0,"pros:<br />nice looking<br />wrapped in protective plastics<br />worth the price<br />cons:<br />very lightweight for stainless steel(seems like &#34;solid&#34; aluminium)<br />pins<br /><br />recap:<br />nice looking band good , disappointed in the weight and thin pins that accompany it.<br />i was looking for a &#34;solid&#34; stainless steel band that has a good deal of weight behind it. this is not that band."
3.0,So I ordered the three pack of shorts I was skeptical to order clothes online but there wasn’t much of any other options for me because it was during COVID and I didn’t want to goto shopping malls to search anyways I ordered these I’ll say two of the three shorts fit her but one pair was made oddly and the leg holes were huge and short in length so her bottom hung out the back side of the shorts. Idk what happened there but the other two fit good just sad the last pair didn’t. Otherwise they were ok and it wasn’t a lot I spent on the price so that’s that I may order again for another try in the future.
3.0,"Really cute, but the zipper came apart almost immediately after I tried it on and I couldn't get it back together... and even if I could I wouldn't trust it to  stay that way. Just decided to avoid the paranoia and send this one back."
3.0,"I bought this for a friend who has lost 4 pets in the last few years. While she did love it, and it did make her cry, I was a little disappointed with the visibility of the engraved names. While wearing the necklace, the hearts stack on top of each other and only the top name is visible. Also, this is stainless steel so be mindful of skin sensitivity and allergies when purchasing this necklace."
3.0,Super cheap and smells awful. It was so stuck together it took a few minutes of peeling to get it to look like a skirt.
3.0,low quality fits crooked.
3.0,These are great looking pants. The material is great. Plenty of pockets. It’s something I would of like to keep and wear. But I don’t like the way they look. The only reason why I’m returning them is because they are baggy pants. Way too baggy for me. If they were a bit more slimmer it would of been perfect! If anyone knows of similar pants but slimmer please let me know. These were just too much
3.0,It's cute but I think that it's easy to break attach flower area. It's from China and I don't trust their quality...
3.0,Fits loose and large on my daughter. Don't know why it's called mens since this cosplay is for a female character.  It's supposed to be loose on the character.  Thinish material.  So far it's holding up alright. Wish it was an actual sweater material.
3.0,"I have a few dresses from PattyBoutik in this size that all fit well, but this one is snug in the rear. The outer fabric looks nice, but it is scratchy, particularly on the underside of my arms. Where the lining meets the bottom of the zipper makes a bump appear in an unflattering place. Overall, I'm not impressed."
3.0,Chest area too flumsy.
3.0,Some fit well .designed well others were cheaply sewn together.not that great.
3.0,Its okay 😕
3.0,The frame was too large for my face.  The lenses did not adjust correctly
3.0,These bend out of shape very easily.
3.0,"Color is more of a neon orange, which kinda ruined the whole vintage 60s look I was anticipating. A bit cheap looking with the rhinestones in the middle, but ok for Zoom. Just very bright!"
3.0,"I loved the assortment of belly rings. And the colors as well.  I was impressed by the size of the teal and peach colored ones.  The hearts were bigger in person then in picture.  Only part that I am unhappy about is the first day with the teal heart one , the top ball I think is stripped had to keep checking to see if it was screwed on . And then a few hours later the heart has a crack in it and broke off . The peach one I double checked and it looks the same so I’m scared to wear it that it will come apart or break off somewhere and I have a little one that doesn’t need to find and put in her mouth. 😩. And the hearts were my favorite ones out of the pack ."
3.0,Shirt is very thin. Not what I expected
3.0,Cute print and dress however runs small. Returning
3.0,Cute but SHEDS!!!
3.0,"item was nice and as described, only problem is that is broke already and has only been worn a handful of times"
3.0,Gorgeous. I've gotten many compliments on them. But they didn't leave a back stain around my ears for the first week I wore them.
3.0,The top was way too large. I had to return it. I didn't exchange because I could tell if I went down a size the waist wouldn't fit. The material was also not the greatest quality but it was okay for the money.
3.0,Lighter weight than portrayed in picture
3.0,It is pretty small but pretty.
3.0,Flattering but really short!  Wear with caution
3.0,Too many  of the bee type bugs
3.0,Zippers all get caught up when opening and closing it.
3.0,It's not a L size it's more like a medium size
3.0,Inside Sole comes out when walking on each step after several washing and material got bigger over time .  Sole also does not have enough cushion and support which makes the legs tired faster and harder. uncomfortable after just few minutes of walking or standing. Sole came off within 3-4 months
3.0,Not a bad dress.... Just looked very frumpy on me even after I tried a smaller size.
3.0,"These socks were nice for the first couple washes, but then they lost their softness and are very abrasive on my skin.<br />Cute and colorful, too bad they lost their softness."
3.0,Beautiful but too wide!  Can’t really be adjusted either
3.0,"When I received the gauges there was no red at all, rather light brown/tan color."
3.0,"Not oversized at all. Fits tightly on your head. Has kinda a weird shape, very stiff."
3.0,"I ordered a green and purple butterfly which came very nice and what i chose but then ordered a grey and black ""feather"" one and it came black and orange. Like Halloween 🙄. I only like those colors 1 month a year. Other then that nice cases just wish the black was the one i ordered"
3.0,Family favorite.
3.0,Nice suit but wasn't material I expected and wasn't true to size. I wear XL but couldn't get pants on and jacket was too tight.
3.0,"Nice lots of strings hanging, too expensive for product received"
3.0,Watch band is small in width. Slightly big for small wrist.  Iwatch looks  over proportionate compared to watch band.
3.0,"It doesn't stand up like the picture I do wish it was more sturdy, and it's not that tall I'm it still looks cute though I'm going to try a little starch on it.."
3.0,They are nice!! I made cute necklaces :0)
3.0,The pants looked great. They ran small. So I gave them away
3.0,"This belt doesn't set off the metal detector at the airport, and holds my pants up. Looks OK from a distance. The leather is so-so quality, probably won't last too long. The shape of the buckle causes the belt to bulge over it; I think it would have been better to have put the opposite curve on it."
3.0,"i wish i never hand washed it UGH, it was perfect before you wash it"
3.0,These are HUGE. Like covering half my face. Way bigger than anticipated but if that's what you're going for then okay I guess
3.0,"It will serve the purpose I had for buying it.  A little flimsy plus I had to trim a lot of loose threads.  Otherwise, got what I paid for."
3.0,"These are ok leggings. They are a bit large, and long for me. I am 5'2&#34; and they bunch up at the bottom with the extra length. They are not the best quality. Very thin and see through if stretched to much. They will be good for summer, once I hem the bottoms."
3.0,"Snug fit, otherwise cute style"
3.0,"My husband really liked this hat, reason for returning product is that the seam-line in the front of the cap will not center when he puts in on!  Off the head it appears fine, but when he puts it on it is off-centered. Defective product...I might try my luck in reordering another."
3.0,Fit very well and comfortable. Only issue is that the inside pocket had poor stitching because there was a hole in the right pocket.
3.0,"it was fragile, already broken after a few days..."
3.0,"Not much movement, dosent rilly work for a fidget."
3.0,"I got my hubby an XL, his usual size. XLs are often a little big for him, but this was way too big"
3.0,Okay for price but not well made. Could see glue where pearl attached to the rhinestones. Still looked pretty on us bridesmaids at my friends wedding!
3.0,Seams are subpar.  Pocket already falling off after 1 wearing
3.0,"I ordered this tank from a different website but am giving a review on here as well. The tank runs very large, so order a size down. I am typically a large and sometimes even XL, but the large in this tank swallowed me. I am exchanging for a medium. For reference, I am 5'8&#34;, 155 lbs, size D chest. The top was comfortable and true to the photo in my opinion. The sides do flare down as in the photo in a pretty way. One thing I couldn't tell from the picture is that this tank had yellow in it so when it arrived I was disappointed. I wanted a red, white, and blue top for 4th of July. If you don't mind the yellow and order a size down then you'll like this top."
3.0,"Very cute pattern but does not fit well, even after utilizing the sizing chart."
3.0,Sizes are not like the actual Apple brand. This runs a little larger. Material feels very thin. I use it every once in a while because the smallest size runs too big so it’s not good enough for exercise for me.
3.0,"You can't really see the blue in the ring, kinda of bulky. Its a nice dust collector in the drawer."
3.0,"I bought these for my 19 year old son.  He can't even get his hands in them.  I can wear them. (I'm a woman) but the fingers are too long for me.  My fingers are not long enough to be in the area to use as texting gloves.  They are an odd size.  If you have thin hands with long fingers, this would be perfect.<br />So these are in my car and i wear them to drive.  They have an amazing grip on the steering wheel."
3.0,"The fabric is a bit rough even after washing them several times. They fit just ok. I bought the turquoise and beige and I think they are slightly different, the beige shorts fit more snuggly and are not as comfortable. The elastic waistband is tight, I’m hoping it gives with time. Not thrilled with purchase. I wear them mainly to walk my dog. Wouldn’t buy again."
3.0,A little too small for me.
3.0,I got this as a gift for somone because the got covid. i told that person that they were all two toned and very warm he told me they were very thin and one was all black and one was all green. i would return but he has covid and i cant ensure a safe transportation
3.0,"The shirt is teally long amd the lace part bulges out a bit on the sides, its also pretty sheer but i live in Arizona so its perfect for summer."
3.0,Did not realize how short the chain would be.
3.0,The material isn’t too bad but I ordered the mocha colored one and it wasn’t a TRUE dark chocolate color like it was pictured. It was a litter more light brown than I expected and was a little tight around my shoulders.
3.0,This didn't look good on me so I returned it. the Fabric is shiny which I didn't care for.
3.0,The color is beautiful but the material is so scratchy that it will have to have something underneath to be worn.
3.0,"some what large, but fun!"
3.0,I brought this to replace my favorite lightweight jacket for the office.<br /><br />I was disappointed that it doesn’t open and close easily due to the double zipper. I will have to either *step in* to the garment or pull it over my head.<br /><br />I don’t understand the double zipper concept. I just need one zipper ... otherwise it’s a nice garment.
3.0,Alittle large
3.0,"Looks okay, a little on the large size."
3.0,"They were okay, I'm a 7.5, and they fit fine, but looked a little tight on my feet"
3.0,"Although you're getting three shirts for a reasonable price, I'm not very happy with the overall quality of these crop tops from WINGSCLOGO.<br />First, be aware that there is very little spandex in the fabric, so unfortunately you won't get much in the way of stretch or fabric retention. It feels much like a cotton undershirt does. Second issue is the fit. I don't know if it's the cut or the material, but it doesn't hug the body.<br />I ordered the size medium which I usually take in a workout shirt but received the small size. Thing is, the small were generous enough where they fit, but the gap of extra material in the back is less than flaterring to say the least. It sticks out from the body and looks awkward. For reference,  I'm 5'6, 118lbs.<br />I can't recommend them as getting the right size and fit may be a bit tricky and there's really no stretch to the fabric.<br />I've posted some photos to give you a better idea of the gap and overall appearance, and hope that they, along with my experience, helps you out a bit with your choice.<br />Thank you."
3.0,It runs very small And the transparency Like a beach cover up only
3.0,This skirt was a little long and a little lose around my waist
3.0,It camer earlier than expected and it was very large in person. The only thing I didn't like is was that the chain is wasn't adjustable so it's longer than I wanted it
3.0,not great .<br />but for this price ok!
3.0,The chain is pretty and a good length however I was wanting something that had bigger circle links.  These are smaller and not as dramatic as they appear in the picture.  I will keep this and wear it as it is a nice chain.
3.0,Love the shirt but they run quite large.<br />I wish I would have ordered a size smaller.
3.0,Material is super sheer and thin. Could see underwear and bra straight through it!
3.0,I bought two sizes up & still too small. Good value nice dress
3.0,Nice lenses but far too small for my 8 year old girl. They fit my 2 year old nicely.
3.0,"It's a pretty skirt , I am giving 3 stars because the material is so thin ."
3.0,"For the price and what it is, it’s not terrible.<br />Pros<br />It has pockets<br />It’s lightweight<br />Looks similar enough to photos<br />Inexpensive<br />Cons<br />Really short Cropped pant(not like photo)<br />A little darker pattern than photo<br />Material is slightly staticy(I know there are ways to solve this but slightly annoying)<br /><br />Not meant for anyone over 5’6” the hem came to my mid shin (I’m 5’10” for reference) 130 lbs and ordered a 4/6. If my torso was any taller there would be camel toe so that’s a plus on the torso being just long enough.<br />Otherwise it is pretty cute and has an elastic waist too."
3.0,Exactly as it explains and shows in picture but runs small.
3.0,Material is pretty thin...
3.0,Was not the color they showed. On line it showed black and brown. When it arrived was light gray/dark gray. Was a lot smaller than expected.
3.0,Not a needed item if you have an ultrasonic cleaner
3.0,The calf is too high fits very tight around calf.
3.0,"Wish I could give it 5 stars, but these things are gonna cut and scrape against your legs. Although it is my fault I decided to get them, they still do a great job, makes me look great without shirt coming undone."
3.0,Cute product but seems to run a bit small and be snug.
3.0,The spandex under skirt rides up. I am constantly tugging at it. My body size is proportional - waist and length fit as expected.
3.0,I like the jacket but when I tried the jacket on it had 2 large holes in it that I had to sew back together
3.0,"I though that this item would look classy and could be worn out with casual or formal if the person chose to, but then when it arrived it looked like it was made of plastic and was not very sturdy. I believe the day after christmas the gold center fell out of the earrings."
3.0,"Too small, but I am tall so it might be perfect for someone else. The top is fitted, just FYI."
3.0,I returned the top as it was not the correct for or size for me.  I think I would have liked the fit more had it not had such a pronounced empire waist line. The top seemed very well made and the color was true to the photo.  I gave it 3 stars because I didn't keep it so I don't k ow how it launders and wears etc. but overall if it had fit me I think I would have liked it.
3.0,These are decent panties but are not nearly as good as the thinner boy-cut underwear that come from China. These are cute but are a thicker cotton that do not stay in place. They tend to stretch out throughout the day and start to ride up and will roll up when your little one pulls up their pants.
3.0,Cute color and fabric but the shoulder pads looked weird on me
3.0,"Glad I got the XL but still a little small and I am a normal size 12. This definitely requires an under slip, way too sheer and open with the slits. I will not be purchasing again but worth what I paid!"
3.0,"As others have written, this product is small.  It fits me and I like the soft, stretchy material, but I wouldn't want it any tighter around my leg.  I'm 5'5&#34; and 105 pounds."
3.0,"This shirt definitely runs big, but I was able to style it with a cute pair of denim jeans & booties. Arms were still really loose, but I made it work for church on New Year. It is thinner than I’d like also & since it wasn’t completely true to size, I probably wouldn’t purchase again."
3.0,I love it honestly but it made an indention hole in my nose and I can’t get it out 🥲
3.0,The mirror fell out first time I wore it...I superglue it back but beads are constantly falling off. Save your money...poor quality on a pretty necklace
3.0,I was looking for some cool weather pants that didn't slow me down or look too baggy. The fit was tight (which I wanted) but the wast is a bit too low. Probably will buy one a size larger just to see if that helps.
3.0,"It arrived in good condition, for the plastic lovers definitely a good find!"
3.0,I got this for my daughter.  She really like it.  It looks good on her.  I didn't give it a higher rating because I got another one that is similar to this one for much lower price.
3.0,I would have given 5 stars if my watch hadn't broke while attending a formal dinner.
3.0,I went up 2 sizes because I knew it would shrink. Fits ok but not the best.
3.0,"this is a nice strap and I think it will be better once it's broken in a bit more.. it's a nice feeling strap, but needs to be a bit more flexible.. maybe work the leather a bit more.."
3.0,"wasn't what I was expecting, thought it may be a little longer or wider but very small."
3.0,The hat was very cheap and hard to get shaped back right to look right to wear. We bought this for a 20s dinner and it did complete the look. I just wish each piece was a little better made.
3.0,"These tank tops fit very awkwardly. The arm holes are a bit too small, so they look very boxy and do not look appealing. The size small was too large for me. I am 5'6&#34; 105lbs for reference. The material is very soft and therefore I will keep them, but I plan to only wear them under other clothes or around the house. But if you're looking for a tank to wear alone, I would look elsewhere."
3.0,The shoulder strap attachments were very weak.  They broke the first day I carried it which was very disappointing.  I still carry the bag daily though just with the short handles and I like it a lot but I wish I had the option of the shoulder strap.
3.0,"Good packaging. Came with case, tools for adjusting, and a card for testing the polarization. Entirely too big for my face though and the lenses were not tilted enough to keep the sun from coming in around the sides and bottom. Very distracting while driving, so I will be returning."
3.0,"I loved the watch. But, after 2 months the wood split and it broke at the base. Very upset. I works still though. Maybe I will glue it. Refund states ""unused "" condition, well its used...so I cant return it i assume. Very disappointed. I suggest not to buy it because soon you will be upset."
3.0,"I ordered this on nov 2, and here we are at the end of December and the show lace broke. It was great for the time it lasted, but it doesn’t last long."
3.0,"For Copas, I expected these to hold up better.  The sole and leather began to separate after about 1 month of wear.  They fit well and looked sharp, just didn't last as long as I wanted a $150 pair of cleats to last."
3.0,"i Believe i should've ordered a Smaller Size, The Chart showed Otherwise and i may not have payed attention, The Quality is Overall good, i'll deffinetly Donate these pair. No use for them on me, Might buy again but a smaller size,"
3.0,This dress runs small and the color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture would indicate.
3.0,It pinched my pinky toe. Too narrow where the bend is in front
3.0,"Looks cheap, but  I  guess you  get  what  you  pay for."
3.0,Very disappointed in the quality. Shown as silver colored but it is almost black.
3.0,"Be careful; these are rounded laces.  They will slide easily down your kilt hose no matter how tightly you tie them.  Look for squared laces which grip the hose better and don't slide.  Otherwise, they work fine and look nice."
3.0,I get a lot of compliments on the look of this wallet. It's not the best material but it's fine (I always wreck wallets with wear and tear anyway). The plastic slot for the ID is super tight and I have trouble using it.
3.0,Be aware you are only buying the gold with no stones!  The photo is very deceiving
3.0,"The item is fairly well made for the exception of the near-useless back pocket (thin material, crappy zipper), but I can't say it has any advantage over an ordinary pencil bag you might find in any school kid's backpack. The things you strap in will snag other things if you try to pull it out of a backpack and it's too bulky to fit into a slim space. The product would be really good if it were attached to something, like a kitchen/bathroom wall or maybe the dashboard of a car. Or the space station. It would be great on the ISS. I should sent this to Cape Canaveral so they can send it on the next rocket up. The shipping to Florida would be cheaper than the $8 Amazon wants for returning this thing."
3.0,Really cute glasses but the quality is kind of cheap. Mines arrived slanted but that may be because of the way it was packaged.
3.0,Fits kids or smaller adult hands/arms.
3.0,"Comfortable, light, not for winter or dirt work. Wind goes right through them, probably awesome in summer. Tongue is sewed in at bottom by safety toe, so any dust, dirt, liquid that gets on the toe of the boot will make its way under your foot"
3.0,"Size runs small, but cute"
3.0,"It looks nice and has lots of slots.  The lining ravels a little more every day.  If you put more than a couple of cards in it, it's too snug to get your fingers in to remove the cards. Same with coins.  I don't think it's going to last very long."
3.0,"We just received these today and my daughter, being excited, tried them on before I was able to say not without your own underwear on first to make sure they fit.. so they are too big s and I am certain I ordered the large and not the x-large that was sent...now we are stuck with them dangit.<br />I am giving only three stars because I don’t feel like they sent me the size I ordered...the quality is good otherwise"
3.0,"Great material, pants fit e tremely well and a bit stretchy. However, the jacket runs small. I had to keep pulling it down"
3.0,The color was a lot more lime green than expected but it will be a nice dress for the right event.
3.0,"It is a cute dress but the material is thin.  It isn't a see-through problem, it's a problem with the top of the dress not laying flat against the chest.  Perhaps it fits better on some folks.  32C... not so much.  The top edges of the bust line wrinkle a little because there is nothing to keep it form fitting.  It just needs a liner or some stablizers to keep it looking sharp.<br /><br />However, the dress is light weight and feels nice on.  It has just the right amount of flare to look really flattering.  Unfortunately, we returned it because the bust line just didn't lay nicely and it made the dress look like it just wasn't well made."
3.0,"They are cool, although the picture shows silver frames and you sent me a pair with black frames."
3.0,Nice for children<br />I won't wear it because it's fake looking
3.0,"This bag is very cute, and I love the way it looks, but it just flops together when you are trying to get into it.  When you put it on your shoulder it buckles in the middle and doesn’t lay right. I’m constantly adjusting it to lay flat."
3.0,I bought these thinking they were men's socks.  When I got them I realized they had to be made for women.  So the product did not work the way I wanted them to so I had to improvise.  I would not buy them again and not sure they are worth the money I paid for them.
3.0,Fits well but pads move around and get folded up.
3.0,small a little uncomfortable
3.0,The contrasting colors are very bold and make the shirt look cheap.  Odd neckline.
3.0,The only way to put in the longer watch peg is to break the corner or the band
3.0,"Thin watch, looks good. Arrived with dead batteries.<br />Sitting on shelf, can't wear them as they need a battery change."
3.0,"I like things big, and this was way too big.  I retuned this item"
3.0,"I found these in stainless steel but, not the look I was going for. These are stamped 925 but, the other earing with the black stone wasn't my vibe. I really like the movable rabbit limbs and think it's pretty cool. I had to bend the closure piece up so it could lock properly. Silver is soft so take care of them. I've worn mine 24/7 since I got it and had no issues yet. The other was too long on the clip so I don't use it and is very loose on the ring. 5 stars for the rabbit 3 for the other just because of the design"
3.0,I had to get a larger size than expected. This is the replacement item. The seller was great on refunding me my money for the previous.
3.0,These are very light and fun.  They are also very cheap and break easily. I think the dollar store ones are better quality.
3.0,"Wasn’t the material I was hoping for. It was really stretchy, though. The legs were quite long and went over the middle of my feet."
3.0,Not happy with style
3.0,The first bottom went of the first day of use
3.0,"Sooooo cute but, I normally wear a small but ordered a medium originally; ended up returning the medium for a large which, was still a bit tight, especially around the arms. Ultimately returned. Not exactly true to size unfortunately :/"
3.0,Guys good everywhere except where the lace is around the hips. It's not stretchy material like the rest of the material.
3.0,good but too small for me
3.0,"Way to big, however super nice and stretchy so you can go down in size if you prefer tight fitting clothing. Super soft and comfy and great quality. Even though it’s a bit big, keeping it for simply being all around great buy"
3.0,"Bought three...one for me, one each for a couple relatives.  We all put them on at the same time.<br />All three of us had broken chains in the first day.<br />It's very inexpensive so buying another chain isn't so much of an issue for me...<br />just be forewarned it will be necessary."
3.0,They seem ok. I wish they were just a little darker
3.0,"I love the fabric they use on the Turtle Fur hats, but not the way this one is put together. Awkward seams sewn into it, make for a fit that is not typical of a &#34;beanie.&#34; It doesn't hug your head in a nice rounded fashion. Might be okay for some, but I did not find it appealing. Other styles of Turtle Furs might be worth trying. I haven't yet."
3.0,"The sweater fits well and is super cute. I am just not fond of the fabric. It's not soft and it's not stiff or too thick either, but it's the type of fabric that is light and does not fall or hang well. It is clingy and I am constantly pulling it down. Not my type of comfort."
3.0,"The shirts are decent but it was pretty tight for an XL. I'm a muscular build so my chest is 49"". One size up would've been perfect.  Also one of the shirts ripped at the seam under the arm."
3.0,Very cute but I got duplicates of colors and I was missing others. I'm still waiting on this issue to be resolved.
3.0,"A little thick for us, hard to breath"
3.0,great necklace for the price but shipping is horrible.  I reordered a few more for some teammates.  I hope shipping is better
3.0,I ordered a very light blue shirt and got this dark blue shirt instead I don't know if I am happy with it but the size is a little larger on me than expected.
3.0,Strap is too small... perhaps it is designed for a child? I will probably need to buy a replacement for it.
3.0,somewhat small. and a wider than average crew collar. otherwise good.
3.0,Shorts were not like in pic :/ kinda disappointed.  Top is lovely do run a bit big imo.
3.0,Shirt was very tight in the shoulders
3.0,"loved the shirt at first but after like a month later, white threads were popping out all over the shirt . unwearable. which is sad because the shirt itself is really nice and has a nice feel to it. unfortunately by the time these threads were popping out I am no longer eligible to return"
3.0,Bought for daughter. Fabric is very stiff even after washing.  No tags anywhere. Seems cheaply made. Runs true to size for a junior.
3.0,Purchased this bag for my son and it looks very sturdy but the strap came off at the stitching about a week after we got it.
3.0,I do like these and the set is beautiful but the earrings are very hard to get on because the posts are a bit too short. Other than that it’s beautiful.
3.0,"I love the look of the bracelet, but after a week the leather band broke."
3.0,Love the onesie.  However the pants aren't  soft and they are snug.
3.0,"Cute, but kind of cheaply made."
3.0,I love the feel of them just in the mid area they will not stay up. I have to keep pulling them up plus my phone in my pocket didnt help. Other then that i love them so if you get them try a smaller size mybe they will be tighter and not move if your working out and phone in the pocket.
3.0,The shirt look exactly like the picture it’s really nice but it’s too big. My son is a 10 which in youth sizes is a Large. I seen a review saying the shirt was big so I ordered a size down and got a medium and it’s still big he would need a small but they don’t have anything in stock now
3.0,"color ,not what Ithought"
3.0,We really loved these but after a couple weeks the soles were coming out.
3.0,Fits large. However it is very toxic smelling. It was washed 7 seven times. Finally with baking soda helped to get it to where you could have it on for five minutes. We also had to make eye holes and more breathing and hearing holes.
3.0,No issues with shipping. However they nice was broken after one day or wear.
3.0,The flag is a little too big on the shirt but it's ok. Not my favorite top but not bad.
3.0,"I bought these shorts based Amazon's High Best Selling Ranking, for example, #4 Men's Running Shorts.  The product arrived in good condition, packaged simply.  It's material is of good quality, sewn well, and did not bleed when washed.  Two issues with fit.  I was hoping to have some degree of compression, but the size I selected proved to be a bit too loose.  The advice on the product site recommends an XL given my size my waist.  But the guidance provided down in the product's description says, ""If you prefer a little tight fit, go up 1 size.""  To me, this means a size larger, so I ordered size XXL.  Unfortunately these are a little loose, not snug enough to provide the level of compression I expected.  So much so, I would recommending a size down (smaller) for a tighter fit (Logical, no?  Maybe that's what the vendor meant.).  The second issue is the height of the waist band from the crotch.  I'm 5'8""  with a longish torso.  The waist band comes up to my naval.  That's a bit high for me.  Five stars for the quality of their product.  Minus two stars for the lack of clarity in their product's description (size)."
3.0,"These are clearly made cheaply. The backs fall off easily but I think I’d you replaced it it would be better. I wear pins at work and I had it fall off once when it hit the counter wrong. They look very nice acrylic, but honestly might be better to wait until an enamel official pin is released for this series. Overall for the price I’m happy with them and I expected them to be cheap at the price so I’m not disappointed at all. I’m giving 3 stars because that’s all they deserve. Nothing special except the price."
3.0,"Its like a jersey shorts but really really thin. It would work at the beach and just lounging at home. As a personal preference, my husband I would not recommend using it walking around. I guess it will work for running around the block and the gym and you just head back home right away. It feels really soft because its really thin."
3.0,Want my two bracelets you'll owe me the black yellow green and the rainbow color one
3.0,This is a really cute suit but for being advertised as 'plus size' it runs a little small. I'm 5'4&#34; and 165 and the suit is a little snug. Definitely order up
3.0,Just received...so far so good...am hoping the will help with glare at the pool.  Blue ones came with a gouge scratch at the top of lense.  Ordered 0.0.  May go up to 1.00 next time or return and reorder these.  Two less stars because of scratch.
3.0,Product I feel you payed to much money for the product when you got it but I guess during covid times this is how they are doing it. I was expect more of like an under armour type of make but hot like a dollar store type of material.
3.0,Looks good but the product has only one size and its somewhat feels not fit.
3.0,Funny shirt. Runs a bit small. Holds up good in wash so far
3.0,Very pretty but the clasp on one of the bands would not stay shut. I almost lost the trinkets several times and it was a pain to try and always remember to keep checking to see if it opened and my trinkets were gone. I had to return it because of this reason. Other than that it is a beautiful band.
3.0,"The fit is small and kind of odd, but overall it looks cute enough to wear.  I am not going to return, but I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"It was my favorite bracelet even though it snagged my clothes, until it broke"
3.0,"When I seen this on Amazon, I immediately wanted to buy it. When it came in the mail, I received it in a good condition and a little earlier then it was predicted. I wore it as a friendship bracelet, wearing it every day rather then just as a ""once in awhile"" accessory. After about a week or two, the treads started to become very lose and worn down. It could have been since I wore it every day. If you purchase, don't wear it every day, it's a cheap material."
3.0,"6ft, 250lbs<br /><br />Fits me like a shirt, not a dress, but that's okay."
3.0,Nice but smaller than expected. I have to go out and buy one I can see the actual size.
3.0,Wasn't cute
3.0,"It is okay, it's not the best quality, but the price is right."
3.0,It could have been made better. the joints are sharp
3.0,This denim jacket didn’t quite live up to my expectations. The fit runs larger than what I expected and has a boxy fit. I feel it fits more like a men’s jacket would. The buttons also rattle around with every love you make so that’s a little loud too. Overall it’s a cute jacket I would just fix the fit and buttons. The material feels good it’s soft yet sturdy. Cute for fall weather.
3.0,"these lenses fit the original frame well, but not very clear and they cannot block the direct sun light. Also, you can notice reflecting light from inside when wearing."
3.0,"Just received my delivery today. The metal IS shiny and pinkish and the colored crystals ARE pretty. Here's where the letdown comes in: the tiny clear crystals on the 'plain' butterfly look more like flat gold dots than distinct 'diamonds,' and more importantly, I do not know what 'resizable' means... THIS IS A PRETTY PINKIE or CHILD'S RING. To be resizable there must be enough band to go smaller or larger (enabling wear on different fingers). That's not possible here. I am keeping it but have no choice but to wear it only on either pinky."
3.0,Beautiful shiny and high quality charm.  The price was great. I sent it back though because the ears look more like rabbit ears than mouse.  I wanted it for a Disney bracelet but it just doesn't look right.
3.0,A little juvenile
3.0,"Pretty dress, but a little see through, need to have a slip which I wasn't planning on for a sundress"
3.0,"The XX is too short, doesn't cover the bottom. Otherwise is good. The sleeves are long, but it is short on the back. Impractical this way."
3.0,"love the watch, only thing is the clasp is not gunmetal it is silver."
3.0,"I pretty, but run too small."
3.0,"I liked the length of these but the waist was super tight. The description stated that the crops would fit a 22'-34' waist. My waist is 29' and the waist band was so tight it was uncomfortable. Too bad, loved the extra wide legs and the drape. I would have given these 5 stars had they fit the stated waist sizes. I have Amazon Prime so did not have to pay for the return."
3.0,1. It looks smaller compared to a real extra large belt size. Little disappointed :-(<br />2. The color is not the exact one as shown in the picture. It looks like pale white.
3.0,"Lovely pattern and fabric, but the length was a little off on me (I'm 5'4&#34; with a longer torso), so I ended up returning it."
3.0,"texture feels like a random fruit of the loom t-shirt with a ruffle in the bottom, looks pretty from afar but not close specially the texture it felt like a oversized t-shirt"
3.0,"I bought these for my six year old (silver size 1) for his short soccer clinic. I couldn’t see spending a fortune for six soccer practices. They do the job for sure, but he says they aren’t the most comfortable and I don’t think they would hold up for an entire season. If you need them for just a short amount of time, go ahead and buy."
3.0,"one of the hooks did not close, I was very unhappy.  I had to have a jeweler fix it.  I love the design<br />they are very pretty earrings, but could not use them as a gift as I had anticipated."
3.0,"I wear a ladies 8 1/2 so I tried it in a 9 which was way too big. If you're in between sizes, go down a size.<br /><br />They're a big odd to get used to if youre wearing them for recovery so you may have to gradually increase your time. Im still trying to figure out if its helping me."
3.0,"Very thin, stiff, and cheap material."
3.0,I guess for a Halloween costume it probably is what it is....but it's see through and the scrubs are very thin. The cap doesn't fit on a human head. The jacket and face guard are fine.
3.0,"These shorts were shorter than I wanted and have a cheaper feel to them but they work OK. I wouldn't buy them again, though, as would get a better quality of shorts."
3.0,I bought a pair because I owned one before. This one didn't make a week. pink insert separated from the shoes. I still kind of like them because they comfortable. I will glue it back and probably get some wear out of them but quality could be better.
3.0,I normally wear 3x in sweater. This felt like. 1x. I'm going to return the 3x and order a 5x. I love the design though. My favorite Anime.
3.0,"My thoughts, opinions, and experiences are honest, mine alone and my opinion has not been influenced by outside sources. I received this product complementary or at a discount, however I am under no obligation to provide a positive review.<br />If you find this review helpful, please indicate by clicking the YES button below, thank you!<br /><br />I thought it would be a cute little bag/backpack for my 11 year old daughter. My daughter is right at that age where she wants a purse and is really getting into fashion.<br /><br />Upon arrival, the first thing that was noticed was the smell. A very chemical, noxious overbearing smell. I cannot describe this smell but it cannot be healthy to be breathing in. I have been airing it out outside for days but the smell is still there.<br /><br />Aside from the smell, it's a super cute bag. It can be used like a bag/purse or a backpack as it has backpack style straps and a longer handle strap on the top. It has an outside zippered pocket and several pockets on the inside for a cell phone. The large compartment is zippered and is quite large in depth. I believe an iPad or decent size book would fit in there along with a bunch of other things. The quality of the leather seems pretty decent quality as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the smell that does not seem to be going away, neither myself or my daughter won't be able to fully utilize this bag.<br /><br />I gave 3 stars because the quality of the bag is nice but took off 2 stars because of the smell that won't go away, making it basically unusable for me or my daughter."
3.0,They fit well and they keep the water out but there is a weird film that appeared after the first time I used them. It hasn't worsened but vision is really bad with them now 😔
3.0,"I read the reviews, and many said it was too small, so I bought an XL (instead of a Large). I still had to return them for being too small! Felt like I’d split them if I did some squats.  Lol.  If you have big thighs, do not get these shorts."
3.0,I’m 5’4 130 pounds 34b. I’m thicker below than up top. The small was really tight so I am returning the small to order a medium instead. The one in the pic is a small. Love the colors. Hoping the medium will be just right. Both the bottoms and top were too tight.
3.0,"they would be nice if they fit, but everytime i try and wear them.....my toes hurt, but other sox i had bought (from a brick and mortar store) in the past had fit. So Idk what's up with these."
3.0,"I am normally a medium or large, I ordered an XL know it would run a little small. I am a bit bustier so the chest did not fit, but the first every where else was fine. Gave it to my sister and she loves it. If you're a B cup or smaller, order one size up and it should be perfect!"
3.0,"My son loves them, tho they do fall off easily after a while."
3.0,"Soft fabric and nice fit, but it covers my ankles so I will have to return it. I am 5'2&#34; and ordered a medium. No, I did not check the measurements for the length of the dress before I ordered it. I expected more of a midi-length dress which would have been fine. Floor length is just not in style for me right now, and I doubt I will grow another 4-6inches anytime soon. (I think I relied on the picture a bit too much.)"
3.0,This swimming suit runs very small. So size up. My daughter loves it. It has been put through its paces from mud at the river to the ocean and through daily wearings at the pool and it shows no wear and tear.
3.0,I love the mask! It fits great on to my face. The ribbons are poor quality. They started to fray and then one side came off of the mask. I'm just going to buy new ribbon and replace both sides.
3.0,"Cute, but felt a little tight! I wasn’t super pleased with the material."
3.0,Cute product however disappointing because ad leads you to believe it's a 3 piece set when after searching in fine print it's actually only 1 piece...I needed 3 piece sets...<br />Ad is misleading to quanity.
3.0,I wanted this to be a little looser. The arms are tight which feels weird.  I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"The product itself is great that’s why I’ve ordered it three times. However; this time around just like the last two, I ordered two packs of two. And what showed up was one pack of two so I should’ve received for table tops but I only received two."
3.0,"The length of the headband is not adjustable, so unfortunately my big-headed 4 year olds will outgrow these soon. Other than that we were happy with these."
3.0,Wore them 3 times and the clip broke.
3.0,nice looking watch but feels sorta breakable. Does not have a heavy feel to it. yet the style is still nice.
3.0,I tried them on and they are comfortable BUT they are NOT capris. Kind of disappointed about that
3.0,Good quality but sizing not accurate
3.0,Problem solved.
3.0,I purchased many items from Pavoi and had no allergic my skin. But this necklace itching my neck...
3.0,This is a nice kit.... some of tools i cannot use because my watches are bigger then the extent of the tool.
3.0,Too small and NOT for Minnesota's winters!
3.0,"Pretty, but incredibly light and m moves around a lot."
3.0,straps keep sliding of the shoulder no matter how tight or lose ii make them.
3.0,"These earrings would be much better if the peppermint design was on both sides, reather than just one."
3.0,"I gave a short torso, I’m 5’2”. I bought this because I need to adjust the straps to make it shorter but even at the shorted setting it’s to big."
3.0,Update: I added 2 stars because the company reached out right away and offered a refund for my troubles. I really appreciate it.<br />The pin broke even before I could put it on to wear. It then got stuck and my husband had to cut the bar to get in unstuck. Dont recommend.
3.0,Very cute and flattering but material is thin and does not wash well. Strings started freying after one wash. I'd suggest washing and drying on a delicate cycle. Shrinks up significantly as well.
3.0,Zipper on ankle not very comfortable
3.0,"These are cute shoes and appear well-made, but they run SO big! At least 2-3 sizes too big."
3.0,In term's of cuality is very good. But I'm a big bootie girl and the bottom part didn't fit at all.<br />Even though I ordered large and I'm usually a medium.
3.0,Fits good. Does get very hot to wear. For long.
3.0,My daughter loves these but we’ve had problems with the seams in the crotch on 2 out of 3 pairs coming apart. They do not appear to be stitched well.
3.0,"It's alright, great for a kid.  It seems cheaply made but you get what you pay for.  I haven't wore it yet but with the right suit, I definately will."
3.0,The material in the underarm area sticks out quite a bit...making me say this fits somewhat large. The crisscross section in the front lies somewhat flat & the rest of the top fits okay.
3.0,Love bearpaw boots but disappointed because these say they are the Emma style but I recieved the Elle style and I’m tired of returning things to amazon because they screw up so much.
3.0,I didn’t care for the material so Inreturned the product.
3.0,"Love the pattern, but this is definitely a warm weather dress because the cloth is extremely thin."
3.0,not for 5-2 women these pants runs long
3.0,"Ordered black pair and they are great, the metallic pair had white edges and looked like a sticker peeling off of white plastic. Garbage."
3.0,"Larger than expected, don't expect much support. But really cute and comfortable for low-impact"
3.0,Nice bracelet but everything silver colored turned brassy very quickly. I only wore this bracelet for about ten days before it turned and I stopped wearing it.
3.0,"It's nice for what it is and the price. The yarn isn't the best of quality and it runs on the smallish side. Don't expect it to last long, it's a cable design and they catch easy (but, that's not the sweater's fault)."
3.0,look good but gold rubs off to reveal yellow material with little friction. good for a few uses.
3.0,"There are no reviews on this bra. So I just had to try it out. And I may have already written one.. but it’s important!!<br />I’m 5’6”, 225lbs, and usually wear 38DD, so that’s what I ordered.<br />I liked the bra overall; the fabric was soft, no real underwire, it was some other material, supportive, and comfortable, and the back was smoothing, wide and supportive.<br />Unfortunately, the CUP SIZE is SO unmatched to American 🇺🇸  bras.. I’m very disappointed!!<br />I liked everything else, and the band fit great! But the cup size.. it was like wearing a B cup while being a DD cup. The cups could not contain my boobs one bit."
3.0,"Otherwise, nice style. Too bad this flaw ruins the look."
3.0,"This would be a 5 star watch, but it's too big for my wrist and, unless you think of yourself as someone with large wrists, it's probably too large for yours too.  I considered trying to deal with that, but the links don't snap out easily so it would have been complicated and expensive at which point I'd just buy a more lavish watch.  Too bad!  But  good for ladies with larger wrists!"
3.0,"Works good, just sent wrong color"
3.0,"great for the price, cute for little girls, very petite"
3.0,"The fur isn't really sewn in a consistent direction and it just sort of fluffs out at the seams. The base is also not very well sealed and the fabric just kind of hangs, if that makes sense. It served its purpose but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Product arrived quickly. It's bigger than you'd think, and I didn't realize from the picture that it has sequins ALL OVER it. Luckily, if they don't fall off every time you touch it, they come off easily. Cute WITHOUT the sequins. But remember you get what you pat for, so don't expect to much."
3.0,"Cute top, but had way too much extra fabric at the underarms which made it look weird"
3.0,"This dress runs a bit small. I suggest that you order up one size over your usual. I like the cut of this dress and feel it would be flattering if it was a little bigger. In my regular size, I can wear it, but the bust and back are a bit too snug. It actually looks ok from the front, but I don't like the way it looks in the back. I might wear this with a cardigan or jacket that will hide the back. The length and style are comfortable for me, as a mom with young adult kids."
3.0,"Was excited about this dress, but fabric was too thin, and it was an empire waist.  Fit more like a maternity dress, unfortunately. Had to return."
3.0,"Ok, where do I start.. I love the look of this dress and the idea of it but I think it was poorly executed.<br />1. The lace trim on the top is uneven which bugs me severely<br />2. The material in the picture looks a lot smoother/ softer in reality it’s wrinkly and stiff<br />3. It feels more costume then a genuine dress to wear .<br /><br />Those are the 3 main problems I have but I wish they had in just better quality had to debate a lot before donating it to goodwill … my hunt for vintage dresses will continue sadly this one didn’t make the cut.. 6/ 10"
3.0,"Love the ring, purple pearl fell off after a while but still continued to use the ring."
3.0,Size up onthis one
3.0,Nice product just runs super small gave 3 stars x large was like a med
3.0,"It's very cute, but doesn't fit well if you're big in the chest. I made the straps tight up top (too cover my cleavage) and got a massive wedgie when I sat down. Then I loosened the straps, and my boobs were out. So, this is strictly my at home lounging outfit."
3.0,Very pretty but I need ultra light earrings
3.0,I rec'd this as a Christmas gift. I had been looking at it for 6 months. My brother bought this for me for Christmas. We were both disappointed in the quality. Looked pretty cheap. I am lucky enough that I make my own jewelry so I will definitely be modifying this otherwise it will sit in the bottom of my jewelry box.
3.0,I really liked this product but they do slide on the legs
3.0,"Love them , straps are needing more velcro one side is a little off but worth money"
3.0,"Getting older, knees ache a little when cold. These work wonderful and are so WARM just one problem ... have to pull them up often if out walking."
3.0,"The finish wears off quickly, the extra bead fell off. A very temporary band."
3.0,Lighter yellow then shown but good. Cheap material
3.0,Fits however I was expecting a little looser fit. Overall nice
3.0,"I was very pleased with this bag, except for the shoulder strap. After only using it for about one week, the clasps that attach the shoulder strap to the bag have broken. I used the bag as advertised to carry a 15.6-inch laptop and a few books, so I am very frustrated that it has become a problem so quickly. As you can see in the photos I uploaded, the clasps fall open by themselves, which causes them to become separated from the bag easily. Whenever I prepare to pick up the bag, I need to re-attach the shoulder strap. So far I have been lucky enough that the strap has not separated while I was carrying the bag.<br /><br />Like I said, other than this issue the bag is great. It is attractive and big enough to hold many items. However, it's not a cheap bag and for the price I expected it to be good-as-new for quite some time. If you decide to buy this, make sure you have another shoulder strap already."
3.0,"Cute but not as slouchy as I thought.  The material is thick, making it more of a cone.  Functional and hoping it just needs to be worked in."
3.0,It's soo cute and I got so many compliments. It breaks really easy but it's also easy to fix. it doesn't last long.
3.0,Looks a little on the cheap side.
3.0,"Mask is built well, and looks as described.  However, the eye holes are VERY thin, and we had to make modifications to make the mask usable."
3.0,"Alot bigger than I expected. I wear a XL and I'm short. It's too big for my short chunky body. Purchased for family photos just not a good look on me. Otherwise I like it and will wear for work. Nothing wrong with the sweater great quality and soft. I'm just inexperienced at online clothes shopping. I would recommend this item, maybe order one size smaller than you normally wear."
3.0,Over all it's not horrible. But the pictures don't show the plastic bubble appearance.
3.0,"My girlfriend is 5”1 and it drags significantly on the floor, shes going to need to take it to get fixed. But besides that its a nice dress"
3.0,After washing it the adhesive started to come off the fabric and was significantly less adhesive
3.0,Nothing to shout about
3.0,Love the pants but weird fit and off center seam.
3.0,The large was tight at chest but the extra large was too big everywhere else. I wish it would have worked out really cute and reasonable
3.0,Very cute shirt; but sizing is not normal at all. I ordered 12 month and it is more like a 6-9 month size.
3.0,"Material and quality are excellent; however, sizing was off by two sizes. Rather than return/exchange a second time I just kept them and will give them away."
3.0,Go up a size if you’re busty.
3.0,"What the heck? Is all I could say when I tried on the shirt. As you can see I couldn't even lift my arms because the way it is made is like a mix between a bat wing and the bat wing part runs right into the boob part LOL so you either have your arms down and look like a German hausfrau with large side boobs, or you have your arms up ....Or at least try to have your arms up because you can't lift them because it's too restrictive to be a true batwing. Just a very poor design. Such a shame because I was so excited to wear this to a Bling Christmas party Give it a couple of stars because the color is a cute pink rather than being the champagne that many are when they say it's pink pink"
3.0,The photo more or less justify the design. However the seam on two legs are right front in the middle and you can always feel it. The material is  thin and soft and very comfortable but the seam connection right at front and yon can not ignore that sticky feeling.
3.0,A cheaper leather material. Used twice and theres tearing around the back button.
3.0,My nose was really pinched in this mask. Found myself adjusting it all night. Eventually removed it due to discomfort.
3.0,"i liked the fit of the dress, I normally take a medium but due to the reviews I ordered a large.  fit well.  The only issue I have with it is it wrinkles quite a bit due to the jersey material.  I'm not sure I'd purchase another one."
3.0,The hat runs very small
3.0,"This is a beautiful sweater, but the pockets were in a weird spot and stuck out. Ended up returning."
3.0,"I gave this product 3 stars based on one thing only, the putrid smell that came from the slippers when the plastic was taken off. I can only imagine the chemical it is made with, molded from, etc.  It is awful and worthwile to shop for another pair."
3.0,Loved Casio until the band broke. Contacted Casio to see what they would do and they were not helpful or accommodating. Just said to essentially buy a new watch. I would have liked for them to fix the band at no charge.
3.0,"Really like the watch. Slim, light, and accurate. Barely knew it was there for the first 3 months. Then the band became worn at the clasp and started coming loose.<br />Would give 5 stars for the watch but subtract at least 2 for the headache of a watch band."
3.0,Great looking but just a lil to big.
3.0,"I absolutely loved this necklace and wore it every day for about a month... But then I noticed that the purple gems were no longer purple... But clear... Still a beautiful piece, but that was pretty disappointing...."
3.0,"Too small for my lip, in the future ill probably look for 10mm rings only. They look cute though, and I'll probably just use them in my ears when i get another set of lobe piercings"
3.0,"Very nice material felt great but sizing is not correct. Very small on top, went up 2 sizing from normal top was still small while lower portion of dress was huge. Not sure about this purchase: other dress that had same size listed in size chart fit perfectly."
3.0,"Thin material, xl. Runs small"
3.0,The outfit is super cute and made of good quality! However.. I even ordered one size bigger than I usually do and when we tied it the skirt was very short on her.  It looked okay once we untied but defeats the purpose of the ties in the back..
3.0,"Fits as expected. Comfortable.  My kid says it is “so soft.”  One pair was in great condition, the other had a hole along the seam, unfortunately.  Otherwise pleased."
3.0,"These shorts are ok.. Do not like the high waist as is constantly rolling down, nor necessarily the material. I would not buy these again."
3.0,"Very pretty earing ,but always slide do not stay along the ears"
3.0,Cute but super short!
3.0,"Definitely runs smaller than normal - bought one size bigger but it was still quite tight.  Also, there's a leather diamond attached to the back, which matches the ones on the front pockets...not a big deal, just not a fan of it myself.  Ended up returning because there was a hole in the pocket."
3.0,"Arrived with only one horn, so was unusable.  The helmet itself was attractive and sturdy, and it would have been perfect for my needs had it been complete.  Amazon was very gracious in handling the return.  This was to be used as a costume piece for a comedy/murder mystery play."
3.0,"it's pretty difficult to remove cards from this wallet, the fan out doesn't work very well since most of my cards do not have any raised lettering. Not very happy with the finish either."
3.0,Good optical clarity and I like the looks but a piece fell off after only 3 days of light wear.
3.0,"Nice wallet, but a little too large to fit in pocket."
3.0,Really comfortable but order at least one or two sizes larger than you are they run very small
3.0,"These are super cute but what I have noticed is that the elastic waistband is not sewn in.  It twists and it's annoying.  Also, the material starting pilling after 3-4 wears.  I use woolite and dry on low heat.  Clearly not the best material for the price, I would not recommend."
3.0,flimsy and cheap
3.0,"I typically wear between a 4&6, so given the pressure stated is 20-30 mmhg which is pretty tight, I thought I'd go with the medium size. however when I received them they went on like tights, there was no way they were going to provide between 20-30 mmhg compression. since there is no height/weight recommendations in product description I'll share mine- I'm 112lbs and 5'3"". returned"
3.0,kid liked it
3.0,I now wish I had gotten a color other than clear; they remind me of safety goggles when I have them on. And they didn’t allow returns when I tried to exchange them the next day.
3.0,Love the color of this scarf and it’s super warm but the fabric sheds worse than my dog! So be prepared and I wouldn’t recommend wearing it with black
3.0,I don't hate this. Bit I don't really like it either. I have it in a drawer and I will see if I ever wear it...
3.0,Comfortable and fit well but one pair came with a large pull.  I emailed the address that came on the card with their &#34;100% guarantee&#34; but it was returned because it was not a valid email address.
3.0,"I had been really excited about this piece because it was the only leopard/panther pendant I was able to find which captured a semi-realistic feline grace and had those beautiful grooves which lent a sense of fur or musculature.  Unfortunately, the item I received was smooth as any other piece of metal.  What I received looked very much like this piece https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160U1O8A/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2J1V4VUTYTIPB&coliid=I1XZ39NGI8031H"
3.0,"does not hang right. cute otherwise.<br />I would not buy it again.  It was a gift and I had high hopes that this would be the go to necklace for my daughter who is addicted to flipflops, not so much. (however, it does flip flop, maybe it is supposed to hang that way).lol"
3.0,this dress is very poofy and I unfortunately could not get it under control enough to wear it confidently.
3.0,Not that good. Was expecting something better. Maybe my expectations were too high
3.0,Grand daughter loved them. Wore about 3 months and started falling apart. Cute but cheaply put together
3.0,"As others have noted, the Infinity stones fell off easily, but we just hotglued them back on. It worked well for our parody performance"
3.0,"The Price OK, but  quality not that good."
3.0,"The earrings are well made able definitely have presence.  However, they look like stainless steel (not sterling silver) and the earring backs are very tight - hard to remove.  Really secure if you don’t remove your earrings daily.  But a struggle if you remove your earrings before showering and sleeping each day."
3.0,The rise makes them uncomfortable.  They feel as though I was wearing ladies underwear
3.0,One broke when I was trying to take it off
3.0,cute. perfect for Halloween costume! (what i bought them for)
3.0,Didn't like that they had to be hand washed..I like the convenience of machine washable clothing for kids..I didn't see that it wasn't machine washable before I purchased..will check more closely next time..pants are really cute.
3.0,"These are nice, but I had to repair the seam between the knitted part and the fleece after one wearing - it fell apart."
3.0,"I love this brand of dog clothes, we own several of their items and were surprised when we purchased these 3 shirts and they shrunk so badly on the first wash they cannot be work again"
3.0,Material is thick but Bottom half fits well but boobs slip because the top part of the dress is not functional
3.0,I’m 5’4 and this dress came just between my knees and ankles. It was shorter than expected. Otherwise it was nice
3.0,These look to be a nice quality but they are too large. They do not fit. They slide down my face.  Disappointed
3.0,"No, unfortunately they were way too small. I gave them to my tiny 11 year old granddaughter."
3.0,Just wasn’t for me
3.0,"I normally wear a medium in Hanes & Jockey underwear, and the large in this brand is too small. I just ordered the extra large, I will see if those are a better fit."
3.0,Se encogió después del lavado
3.0,The chain felt nice and heavy<br />The skulls look rally cheap
3.0,Very cheaply made. They lasted about 5 seconds in my toddler classroom
3.0,"gives better coverage of the face and neck area. thinner than expected, but good when used with extra layer."
3.0,ugly weird socks and one pair is so small a child couldn't get them on<br />but i kind of like the rest<br />my husband thinks they are hideous
3.0,was too large for a small
3.0,"Nice pattern, collar is somewhat askew, material is thin. If I lived on a island, I'd have no complaints. Size is a wee smaller than listed."
3.0,I bought these for a 5 year old and an 8 year old and they both lost both earrings the first day.<br />The second day they claimed to have been more careful and the 5 year old put them in her pocket after one fell off.<br />The 8 year old lost a back. These are cute but they are not practical.The magnets aren't strong enough or large enough.
3.0,"Some socks were great, while others seemed a bit small and wanted to fall down. Happy with warmth of socks."
3.0,Not double sided or double stitched so to me not a flag but a wall banner.
3.0,Fit okay but he material showed everything. Yikes!
3.0,The colours will fade after a certain number of machine washing.
3.0,"It's good enough for what I needed it for, material could have been  better!!!"
3.0,"Had to re-glue some of the metal pieces back to the string, but overall I like these bracelets."
3.0,"I ordered a size medium and I’m 5’3 145lbs, the medium is huge on me and it is way too long, It goes almost down to my mid calf."
3.0,I just got back from Italy and had admired all of the Murano glass.  This item comes in a high quality jewelry pouch which would make a nice gift although the piece itself looks like glass with wrapping paper on the back.  Colors are nice but just wasn't quality I was looking for.
3.0,The materials is very thin and the bodice is cut lower than depicted in the picture. I didn't expect top notch quality since it's so inexpensive so I plan to keep it on the off chance I need a cheap dress.
3.0,"Wanted to love this sweatshirt and don't.  The material isn't soft, it's very smooth and kind of silky which is fine.  But the big disappointment is that the zipper cuts away from the picture on the front so it looks weird when it's zipped up, and is hard to tell what it is when it's not zipped.  So it makes it look really cheap.  The back is cool.  But for the price it was a huge disappointment."
3.0,"I bought this in a size 5.5 (instead of my normal size 5) on another website because all of the reviewers said this shoe sized small.  They were right--even a 5.5 was just a little bit too tight.  So I bought a 6 on Amazon thinking it would still fit and that if it was just a tad too big then a shoe insert would make it ok.  Wrong.  A size 6 is definitely too big.  I can't vouch and say that it wore like a true size 6, but I'd hedge a guess and say yes because I normally can't wear 6's unless it's in boots.  Unfortunately I had to return these.  Be careful of which size you buy.  Might be worth it to buy two different sizes just in case."
3.0,Works great once you figure out how to use it. Unfortunately one arrived broke which we discovered too late.
3.0,Not a bad item but not a good one either. The comments said it was small so I ordered accordingly....it's way too big for me. It's also quite long and much heavier than I expected. The buttons are almost impossible to button it's been regifted to my sister she's pretty happy with it.
3.0,I'm not sure if my son will like it. He loves the show and wanted the jacket but this is super lightweight. I don't know how it will hold up. I think it will fit but the arms may be a little too long. It is ok but I am not impressed. It looks cheap.
3.0,"wouldn't recommend for smaller faces, but they do fit my 7 year old perfectly. Straps are too thick to add adjusters to."
3.0,Leggings are see through
3.0,Was expecting this to be baggier but will still keep the product
3.0,They are VERY thin. In fact the white ones tore (or had a hole in them when I got them) They are comfortable but not high quality.
3.0,Much smaller than it looked in the picture.  Clasp was unusual.  It was very small for my arm.  I gave it to a 10 year old girl.
3.0,"Pretty flimsy, but you don't want this to be more substantial and heavy because it lays on top of your glasses. I had a difficult time finding lenses with dimensions that matched my eyeglasses.  These were the closest, but it's not perfect.  I have to be careful where I clip it on to make sure it's covering my lenses.  The coverage is pretty lousy.  The edges are a distraction since they don't lay directly on your lenses and light enters between the gap.  It will provide some sun protection, but these are not a replacement for sunglasses."
3.0,"I should've listened to the people ahead of me, but I really wanted a backless velvet dress for my anniversary dinner. This wasn't it, though. As previous reviewers mentioned, the straps are weird. They felt fine, but they looked stupid from the side and the back. Also, when I moved, the dress crept up and got all wrinkled-looking around the middle. I literally only wore these (I got two sizes) in my closet and my room to see how they felt, and though one was too big in the hips and one too big in the chest, they both worked their way up from where they were supposed to be.<br /><br />I got a medium and a large. They both fit, but the medium looked too tight in the hips and the large looked too loose in the bust. My bust is 36""/32D and my hips are 40"" at widest.<br /><br />I gave 3* though because they were nice dresses. The fabric looked nice, the stitching was good, and I imagine there must be a body out there they would work on."
3.0,"Cute, has held up well for a couple months now, but the ends are not smooth as pictured and they will snag/scratch"
3.0,"I got this dress in a small and it is too big for me. I kept it because I love the pattern, but somewhat of a bummer that it doesn't fit right."
3.0,It is not a quality sweatshirt.  It is very small and the material is very thin.
3.0,"I wear american small or medium size depending on the cut of the clothing. I ordered large and it was tight on my shoulders. Since the price was ok and it is a cute shirt, I ordered again, this time an extra large. The X Large shirt arrived and still tight on my shoulders, so I measured it against the large one I had previously bought, and the width of the shoulders were exactly the same, only that the extra large was about an inch longer.<br /><br />Also, the back of the shirt came with the writings upside down.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the shirt is cute. I gave it to a 11 year old daughter of a friend and fitted neatly on her."
3.0,Nice style but the leather was stiff. I returned them.
3.0,I like the socks but expected them to come a little higher up on my ankle. Otherwise they are soft and comfortable.
3.0,"I just received the watch and the light does not work. The watch was so cheap, I don't think it is worth the hassle to return it."
3.0,"This is ok,  feels a little too big.  The product came with a small hole and some threads already messed.  It's pretty though and will work as a cover up during warm weather."
3.0,The post was bent when I received it. Posts are a tad too long ... they poke me when I am asleep.
3.0,Just OK.
3.0,"Obsessed with Sweaty Bands, but the color on this one is just ok."
3.0,"While I love the style of this shoe, I could barely get my foot in the shoe.  Definitely runs very small.  Had to return it."
3.0,"Ok product, nothing special. Won't ever order more!"
3.0,It fot a little big but i still liked it.
3.0,Great Quality but sizing very large - had to return item
3.0,Just what my son was looking for but the gems did almost all fall off. Reapplied with super glue and haven’t had a problem since. Try and glue them down before they fall off and get lost.
3.0,"The best way to describe the fit on this dress is odd. I normally wear a size 14 pant and a size XL too due to being larger across the shoulders/chest. I wear a 40D bra. I ordered an XL and Medium based on prior reviews. The medium fits; however, the seam across the waist is just too high, leaving me feeling like I have to constantly lift my chest. The neckline is also too high, fitting like a choker. The cut from the neck to underarm area is also just odd. Overall, it's a cute dress, but it just doesn't fit right. There are similar dresses available that don't seem to have to same cut. I will be wearing a denim jacket over the dress and will probably be putting it in the yard sale bin after a couple wears."
3.0,"I wanted to love this top. The color is as pictured. This top is cut on the larger side. If you can size down, I would. It’s very thin. Not great quality. This is a decent top for the price. It would look cute tucked in."
3.0,"This is an okay beautiful bracelet, but it is so tiny and narrow compared to what I expected from the picture of it online."
3.0,Husband says they fit but very slippery.
3.0,"Bought the extra long bright orange mittens for my 3 yr old. Based on reviews I bought size 1-2 and they fit great! My son was able to hold onto things as well as pick things up easily. I really liked the extra length on them too, his arms stayed dry at least.  But sadly they are all wet inside after playing in the snow. He wore them a second time and they are soaked inside. I'm very disappointed but maybe they will work for someone if only playing a short time outside. My son played for an hour with his trucks in the snow and they just arent cutting it.<br />Update** so they have been wet before but other times they are completely dry.  Not sure why the inconsistencies but they aren't bad. I would suggest having 2 different pairs since these are necessarily reliable."
3.0,"If you just need a cheap digital watch, this is great.<br /><br />There are two main design problems with this - one is the backlight, which sucks. It only comes from the left side. The second is the controls, they only gave it three buttons, but one is the backlight button. So when operating the watch in the dark you have to memorize how to do things like set an alarm, as the light button changes settings and the light does not stay on when you press it. So you have to press it once to see what screen you are on, then press the other buttons in the right combination to set the correct time for something like an alarm."
3.0,"Beautiful, thick, soft fabric. Dress fits as described. Not quite liking the flutter sleeves. It looks very Pioneer-ish. I might look into taking off the flutter part. The waist definitely needs a belt to look finished."
3.0,"I bought these finger lights for my class as a treat for after state testing.  While my kids absolutely love to do silent reading in the dark with them, we have had several break and a couple lights that we received didn't even work."
3.0,Didn't like the fabric it didn't fit Wright and if you have a belly it will show
3.0,Not as durable or as detailed as I expected. Cheaper looking than I thought it would be.
3.0,"I got this pair of black sunglasses after I had order and received the same pair in purple. Compared to the purple ones, these seem/look cheap."
3.0,"For the price of this product, and considering it is licensed merchandise, I expected a quality level that I did not receive. The graphic on the wallet isn't crisp or vibrant, and the material doesn't feel sturdy. The pockets inside for holding credit cards, etc, are not made of the same material as the exterior and seem especially flimsy. I had hoped this could replace my regular wallet and perhaps double as a small clutch when I just need a few items, but it's just not durable enough. I have a large wallet I bought at Walmart that will do the job better."
3.0,Kinda cheap looking but its ok. Its a little bigger than I expected and the rope its on is very cheap.
3.0,I would not buy them again.
3.0,"Just like the other reviews, this is a very flimsy product. I bought this for toiletries to hang in my wall tent on big hunting trips. Don't get me wrong it works for what I need it for. However, its not a very high quality product. I give it 3 stars because its just an alright product."
3.0,You still get a glare and lights are bright. They make a small difference. Not very comfortable.
3.0,"I thought this item would flatten the tummy area and it didn’t. It just smoothed the area but does not press on it to flatten it out. I bought a large based on the reviews, had the hardest time to put it over. The color was the one I wanted, a beige/nude color."
3.0,They fit as expected. They are durable and warm. But I've had these for 3 months now. And I had to buy some gel inserts to put inside the soles of them. They wore down terribly. And they are nothing but a grid of hard plastic. So the comfort level is not good.
3.0,"Very nice bracelet, good quality, but the magnet clasp wasn’t that great and I lost the bracelet. So disappointed ☹️"
3.0,"It's a cute suit, not hard to put on dry. I ordered the 3xl because it closely matched my measurements. The suit is a little loose and therefor wrinkles in some places, but not so much that I'd return it. I wanted a cheaper suit because I'm hoping to lose some weight by swimming and will likely need a new one before long if I'm successful anyway.<br /><br />What bothers me is the boy short design; the material only extends an inch below the crotch on the inside, and in the back it hangs over my cheeks rather than completely covering them, which is incredibly awkward. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a suit of this design, and this means I'm probably going to be wearing spandex shorts under it. Don't call them &#34;boy legs&#34; if you're going to insist on &#34;underwear shorts&#34; like every other womens' clothes designer out there. It's bad enough I have to order this style online because nobody carries it in store without dealing with nonsense like this."
3.0,I have only cleaned the lens with a lens cleaner but dark spots started appearing on my lens after about 3 months. I can't tell if the coating is chipped off or the spots are darkened coating but it is distracting to try to look through the glasses - I can't use them to drive anymore and harder to read with them on.  Disappointed.
3.0,I really loved the look of this purse. Unfortunately you get what you paid for the zipper is not strong and it messes up fast! Is more of a once in a while purse.
3.0,Was advertised as being Blue and Purple. Arrived as Blue and Orange. Hoping the hubby will still like em as a holiday gift..
3.0,I purchased the Small but they were too big because they were for male or female.
3.0,"I made the mistake of buying these with the tab instead of the usual low cut socks with no tab. After the first wash, they run a little big and I wear size 11"
3.0,"I loved this scarf when I first got it! But don't wash it! It will never lay the same, and no matter how much fabric softener or static cling sheets I use, it still sticks together. Very sad;("
3.0,"I've had good luck with some of the other 90 Degree yoga pants. However, I only wore the Emerald Green pair once and washed them once before a seam came out. Now there is a hole right in the back. Unfortunately, this was after the 30 day return window, so I'm stuck with them."
3.0,The shirt fit well but the shorts were more like pants and they were huge.
3.0,"I expected cute, functional sunglasses but instead got some very ""sharp"" fashion sunglasses instead. The edges are pretty sharp/rough and they're large, there's no space between my eyebrows and my cheeks the way that these sit. They definitely look more comfortable on the models than they feel on me. They were also very tight on my head without any give. Ended up giving them to a friend because I need functional shades and these don't offer much sun protection either...they appear to me like they're more about looking a certain way. Not for me."
3.0,"Kept fingers warmer by being a mitten style although dexterity is somewhat reduced. Thumbs got cold. Heater pocket is strangely on back of hand,severely reducing effectiveness of hot hands. Ended up just putting them inside glove where they lumped up and floated around."
3.0,"Fits good,but rolls down"
3.0,Nice socks but the seemed a little small in size.
3.0,"I mean i like it, except the fact the flap didn't hang on me at all, it just sat on top of my shoulders, and the cowl was coming apart at the seams so i was afraid to wear it and have to adjust it all night only to have it fall apart on me."
3.0,Dress length was bit a maxi. It hit mid calf not toes.
3.0,True to size but morning it looked stretched out. Sleeves and pants
3.0,Comfortable but thought the material would be a little more lightweight. Seems like it would be more cotton then spandex.
3.0,they barely fit my daughter but I am just disappointed that they are almost all ruin after only 1 1/2 months and my daughter absolutely  loves them but I am going to find ones with better quality and that fit better.
3.0,It doesnt stay tight it loosens over time . It does pull hair a bit. And just yesterday I noticed that the metal mesh actually has a break in it already. So not very durable. And the break is sharp an pointy so it annoying to get poked. I have to replace as I only ever take my watch of to shower and charge it.
3.0,"I was super excited about this shirt and still think it’s super cute, but if your shoulders or breasts are big *at all* this probably is not for you. The material is thin, the arms as well as across the bust is very tight. (For reference, I am usually a size 6 in tops because of my shoulders, and wear a 34C. I ordered a medium and it is uncomfortably tight around the shoulders.)"
3.0,Ok not super thick not super thin. Reasonable price.
3.0,Waited almost 3 weeks and when arrived it was a bit small but for the price it's what you get the material is Just Ok.. I gave them to a friend who is much smaller than me and I ordered a large size .. was not a total loss .
3.0,"This product is a very nice product. However, I have taken away 2 stars for 2 reasons (1 of which is significant). Firstly, I ordered the black KO po ah, but received the white one with a black band around the Hebrew words. Secondly, it is a bit snug. A friend of mine who wears these on a daily basis says it tends to stretch over usage. Overall, I am happy with this purchase, as I was going to purchase a white one as well. (I wanted a black one and a white one). Despite the 3 star review, I do recommend this product. My issues were minor."
3.0,too big for my nose
3.0,The feel of socks.Very Damp:
3.0,My wife likes it but quickly stopped wearing it because it hung on everything she touched.  She’s also a nurse and she said it ripped almost half of the gloves she tried putting on.
3.0,"I do not like that the shirt is not free-flowing, the shirt is too boxy and straight."
3.0,"It's very stretchy and the material is soft. However the strap length is a little too long, allowing more cup size space than I need and no way to hoist it up to keep a tight boob fit for HIIT workouts. The rib cage fit is perfect so ordering a different size wouldn't help. I'm a 34c and 130lbs and ordered a small."
3.0,"I purchased this bag to wear with a PINK dress to. Kentucky Derby event. When the bag was received, I was disappointed to discover that the bag is actually PEACHY/ORANGE in color. I was not able to use the bag to pair with my outfit. Otherwise, than the color, the bag is exactly as pictured."
3.0,I bought these for my boyfriend who has a very wide nose. They fit hit nose great but they stuck out way past the sides of his head....which we kinda figured would happen. The glasses aren't really anything spectacular but will work for the price.
3.0,"Pattern design is nice, but seemed small at the hips, so it was returned."
3.0,Great watch but the battery died after only 2 months.
3.0,lite weight pretty but I know why it was so cheap
3.0,Didn’t stick well had to kept pushing them to restick
3.0,cute but too small and I gave them away.
3.0,"For the price... what else did I expect.  It's cute for a child, not an adult, unless you use it inside of another bad."
3.0,Nice show just larger and wider than I expected
3.0,I have wanted this top for a long time and finally seen the price drop and quickly ordered it. I bought theTaupe size Medium I normally wear size Small but wasn't sure based on the sizing chart I should have gone with the small!! The part that is disappointing about the top is in the photo it looks like there are variations of colors but Its all one color ...Dark Taupe. Definitely not as pretty as the photo. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this one! By the way I am 5ft 4in and weigh 118lbs  the medium was too big so I would say this shirt runs true to size
3.0,It broke after 3 days. It made for a very sad tween.
3.0,was looking for more side boob to show hubby's friends love when i show off my double D's for them but this shirt didn't do what i was looking for :(
3.0,"Shirt is tight in the shoulder area, but still very cute."
3.0,There is not balance between the product and price. The dresses is to expensive but the quality.
3.0,Walmart brand but smaller than the same size at Walmart. I'm going to have to lose weight before I can wear them now.
3.0,The Nike symbol peeled off 3 days later
3.0,"Hat quality is great, but the front of the hat is awkward and somewhat ""poofy"". It leaves oddly placed air gaps in the hat that almost makes your head look lumpy while wearing."
3.0,"I was so excited for this dress when it arrived, I loved the style and color. I am a larger chested lady and was disappointed when this fit well everywhere besides my bust. It is so cute, just make sure you size up!"
3.0,the product is very pretty but mine arrived rusted. wasnt too expensive and im a DIYer so its no big deal
3.0,"They are good for their main purpose, to label your luggage. However, there is no separation plastic between the paper with your information and water or other damage. Your information can easily be lost or ruined."
3.0,Bought 2 pajama sets from Pajama Gram. I was not happy with either fit. Very large. Returning and keeping this one.<br />I am thinking that it may shrink some so I will wait and see.
3.0,Snowflake detail missing - which is what made this shirt appealing- small shirt was larger than expected. It will do for a basic item I could have purchase for less at a discount store.
3.0,After a couple washes it's a ball of junk. The holes in the back got all messed up
3.0,"I was disappointed because this item does not look like the picture at all.  The material is lightweight and a little cheaper than I was expected. Also It does not have any ruffles as pictured. It is okay, but a bit pricy for what I got. I was hoping to order more but I won't."
3.0,Nice glasses just once they bend slightly it's done for on really getting the shape back
3.0,"Not bad, a little cheap looking but you get what you pay for."
3.0,It's the size I expected but I was hoping to be able to leave my phone case on with it. Kinda pain to take it off and put it back on in order to use the functions through the purse. Also the plastic part where you use the phones touch screen wasn't sewed in flat. There are ripples in it so all the functions on my phone won't work through it. Overall I do like the mini purse.
3.0,Fits nicely but fabric is shiny and looks cheap / low quality.
3.0,"Quite thin, fits a little small, and the colour is off but for the price it isn't terrible. Should last a few wears."
3.0,Nice if you are looking for a skinny tie.
3.0,"if you have hips, this is not for you. it is not flattering. I am 5ft, 235lbs. it fit fine. length was fine. color was as expected. but it just isn't flattering. the way the asymmetrical hem flows doesn't look right either."
3.0,"My husband got this for a motorcycle trip. He wore it a few times and each time got completely soaked. He had pools of water in the arms, boots were soaked, everything was wet! He spent hours, in the evening, blow drying (in the hotel room) the suit to get it dry. I am returning it as soon as he gets home! We purchased it about two weeks ago. I messaged the company and have not gotten a response at all. :("
3.0,"Very good product, the one thing that would help older folks would be an activation button that required less force to activate"
3.0,I wear a size small and ordered a small but I can hardly zip it up. It runs really small...won't be able to wear it
3.0,"These glasses are lightweight and functional...but they're also poorly made. Both pair I bought cracked on the bottom half of the frame so that the lens on the side they cracked on can easily pop out, rendering the glasses useless. Buyer beware."
3.0,"For the price you cannot beat it, but some how I don't know if the light is faulty, but when I press LIGHT, it only lights the left side and I can only read the hour that it is, but not the minutes, so I have no use for this watch in the DARK because I cannot read the minutes, also it is quite small, but I could live with it, only if the LIGHT worked fine."
3.0,Bought them for my 3 year and selected the size 3-4 toddler. I would say it was perfect for my 1 year old instead. And I can say that they're well designed and was package well.
3.0,Hat is s nice hat but it is not blue at is a teal green o though it was blue so make sure you CK your colors..
3.0,"I loved the look of these glasses and I so love Coach!  However, I returned these as they were quite lose on my head.  I would say I have an average size head and the just didn't stay in place, which is a shame because they were sharp :("
3.0,way shorter then the picture
3.0,The outfit runs kind of small.  My daughter is on the smaller side of 18 months and she will probably only get 2 or 3 uses out of this.
3.0,BEST FOR SOMEONE THAT IS PETITE. VERY NICELY MADE & PRETTY. JUST NOT A BIG ENOUGH LOOK FOR MY SIZE & TASTE SO I RETURNED
3.0,Overall it a good bathing suit I ordered size 14 and i usualy wear 8 or 10 so it does run small
3.0,They are nice and comfortable. Seems came apart after 2 months of wear though
3.0,Hard to use for my 7 year old. We had to stretch them out for him to be able to put them on without assistance. Otherwise they are awesome.
3.0,Don’t expect much. Product looks and feels low quality
3.0,It is a pretty bead. Although i didn't realize when I purchased it that it was a spacer bead. It is much smaller than my other beads. The color is more of a light baby blue.
3.0,Quite frumpy and someone commented on the fact that it looked like I was wearing an apron.
3.0,"I'm 5'3"". Ordered sz small, pants are too long. Fabic feels nice for summer but very see through."
3.0,the brushed twill is a lighter material than I prefer for a hat because it does not hold its form.
3.0,Shirt is not long in the back as pictured. Cropped all the way around which is not what I wanted.
3.0,"will not stay upright , top heavy, not easy to read, but OK item"
3.0,It's cute but I haven't wear them yet
3.0,"I love the FitFlops brand! I wear them most every day. These boots run wide, as most of their shoes do. I have a narrow foot, so I usually add an insole. Also, these have a really wide opening and ankle, I was disappointed with that. I decided to keep these boots because the price was very good."
3.0,Runss small
3.0,"Quality appears OK. Only issue so far is that other reviews say to order size larger. I wear 38&#34; sizes and the XL was loose on top. Probably will buy again but in Large size. Unless you are wearing these as the outer layer ( which you should not be, ever. Cannot even believe that guys do that, look in the mirror and think that looks acceptable) go your size or one size smaller from compression."
3.0,"These are advertised as “huge”. They are not. Quality not the best either. Four of them are ok and I will make do with them if possible. The other 2 are small and useless, so I tossed them."
3.0,"This shirt is alright.  The quality is fine, not great and the top looks different than pictured.  It’s a bit higher on the chest and doesn’t lay as nice. The straps aren’t as spaced out in person,  they are closer to the actual collar which defeats the design.  Debated returning it but it’ll just be a casual shirt for around the house."
3.0,"Had to return this bag as it simply wouldn't meet our needs. Below are detailed the pros, cons, and neutral points of interest (if any).<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Feels VERY sturdy, including zippers (but see below); fabric is pretty hefty and handles are attached with metal hardware. I was really happy with how strong this bag felt and was all the more disappointed that the design flaws were dealbreakers. :(<br />-Fairly convenient size and shape.<br />-Decent lining, feels like it could wipe clean readily.<br /><br />NEUTRAL<br />-Strap is wide but unpadded. Could be comfortable for a modest amount of walking<br />-Has some 'skid protection' on the bottom, in the form of a couple of textured 'pads' of a hefty, flexible material. Marking this as a 'neutral feature, however, since they are both placed more or less in the center. I'm not sure how much protection they offer the bottom of the bag, especially the corners where wear is most likely. Almost a con.<br />-Clothing straps are flimsy elastic. They're functional, but I suspect they will lose elasticity in a hurry<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The padding situation on this bag was bizarre. The inner walls of the bag are well padded. These are the walls that touch your (presumably soft and not fragile) clothes. The outer pockets--where one is likely to place fragile electronics--are NOT padded. The closest you can get to padded protection for a tablet or laptop would be the zippered mesh compartment in the 'suitcase lid.' The listing shows what appears to be a small laptop in the mesh pocket, but the mesh is NOT strong enough to hold anything heavy; plus, you would then have to expose your clothing in order to access the electronics for any reason. Very poor design.<br />-The outermost side pocket is where there SHOULD be pen storage and little pockets for a notebook, wallet, etc. It's only about the thickness of the zipper, so it's too narrow for anything else.<br />-Instead, they have fairly useless pockets in the INNER side zipper pocket, in what SHOULD be a padded electronics pocket. Please note there is ZERO padding on the outside of this pocket, and the listing photo shows a laptop/tablet stored there. I would not wish to keep my electronics there.<br />-This one is a DOOZY. There are two arched zippers on either end of the bag. I say 'arched zippers' rather than 'compartments' because there is NO SPACE WHATSOEVER there! It's like opening a door into a blank wall! The space is literally the width of the zipper. What can you put in it? A pack of gum? A tiny notebook? You wouldn't want to put anything valuable, like cash or coins there (about the only other things that could fit) because it's a single zip--you have to unzip all the way around (or at least from bottom to middle top) to access it, and there's a good chance it would fall out in the process.<br />I cannot adequately express how disappointed I was in this. I had hoped against hope that one of these compartments led to a shoe or dirty clothes bag. If it had, I would have overlooked the other issues with the bag and happily kept it.<br />-One of the zippers (the track, not the zipper pull) was bent due to the way the bag was folded for shipping. It catches each time you try to use it. Again, had there been a shoe compartment, I probably would have tried to re-shape the bag and re-condition the zipper, which otherwise seemed strong.<br /><br />Wish list for re-designing this bag:<br />-move the organization pockets to the outermost compartment, add a pen slot or two<br />-pad the compartment next to that one for electronics<br />-get rid of the absurd arched zippers on the ends--and replace one of them with an actual shoe/dirty clothes compartment! (Yes, I know it would impinge on the clothing storage space, but it's such a great feature.)<br />-KEEP the wonderfully sturdy construction and apparently tough zippers.<br />-KEEP the protection on the bottom of the bag, but add at least two more and maybe a center 'dot,' and position them better to better protect the base.<br /><br />If that golden day of re-design arrives, we'll gladly get a replacement. Until then--we returned it unused. Maybe it will find a home where these design issues won't be deal breakers."
3.0,"They are cute. But they are SO small. Totally didn't look this small in the pictures. I bought them to give as a gift, so I don't know how they wear, etc. But wow, just tiny."
3.0,"I like everything of these aprons except their extra long waist straps. I will give 5 star If they have just regular waist straps length. When I hang up it the straps will touch the floor, so I need to put them in the pocket.  I need to take it off when I need to go to restroom in the middle of my cooking, otherwise the waist straps will touch the water of toilet. I don't know who has so big belly and need  this long straps. And no one will cross them back to front of body, because that will make the cotton straps getting wet and not ""water proof"" anymore. What a strange design."
3.0,"I love the way this looks, but it won't fit on my head! This is way too small!  The listing says 56-58cm 22""-22.8"", but it's definitely not close to 58cm."
3.0,Dress super big small fits like a large
3.0,Pattern was great. Way too small than advertised.
3.0,Was shorter than I thought it would be~
3.0,Super cute shirts but they do not hold up to washing at all. After two cold washes they are ruined sadly
3.0,"I had my hopes set really high for this dress. Definitely not as cute as in the picture!! The length is what bothered me the most. I got this dress in an XL, so it should have been 59 inches long. I bought a similar maxi dress, but a different brand. It read 56 inches long. That dress was longer than this dress, better fit, but a polyester material. This dress is a nice material, but definitely NOT the comfy stretchy cotton blend. I am 5’7 and usually wear heeled shoes, so that really bothered me. Also, the general fit was larger than usual. I am between an XL and a L, and am pregnant, so I’ve been wearing XL in everything. This size XL was much roomier than other XL clothes. It definitely runs big. The arms were especially loose from shoulder to wrist, so it wasn’t nearly as cute as it could have  been. Overall, ok purchase for the price, but I’ll likely only wear it during maternity."
3.0,The dress is very see through it’s like my little girl is naked
3.0,"Not as pictured... Mine came with red fleece instead of the blue pictured which was disappointing because I chose these based on the color combo matching my son's coat. They also run pretty generously, I 18-24 month size for my large 14 month old and they're huge but the velcro on the wrist will ensure they stay put."
3.0,"This is a really beautiful coat, however, you need to order at least two sizes up. Really use the size chart. Their 2XL is a large in US sizing!"
3.0,Face mask 😷 so lose doesn’t has a Nose wire to make tight fit and it kept falling off my face . Beautiful but no safety comfort. MUST WEAR ANOTHER MASK UNDERNEATH
3.0,"Definitely not what I was expecting. I got my normal size and the legs were a little too tight. The material was not the soft comfy material I was used to for Pjs it was more thick, rough and itchy. I will wear them around the house when its cold but I will not be sleeping. They are not comfortable enough for sleeping."
3.0,"Had to send back the first suit I bought because the seams on the sides were coming undone. The replacement was also coming undone, but it didn't seem to be a major stitch so I decided to keep it. Also, with the first suit, the straps were connected, the second suit they were removable and continued to come undone when I wore it. The bust was too big for me and didn't seem to fit right. I would avoid if you are average to small chested."
3.0,It fits as expected and it's comfortable but it's kind of saggy. Not a lot of support in the straps. I definitely do not recommend using for physical activities.
3.0,"Nice when it arrived, although kinda tight on a man’s wrist. Within a few weeks it came apart. Item seemed durable until it broke. You get what you pay for I guess....."
3.0,"Boots are very comfortable and look nice, however they started falling apart after less than a year of light indoor use."
3.0,The material was not as soft as I would have liked.
3.0,Pants way too long.
3.0,Scratched finish otherwise very nice earrings
3.0,Had a bad smell to them
3.0,"The necklace is a great size but earrings are a tad big. Both are lacking detail, and both earrings are flying in the same direction so one will be facing backward in your ear. Not at all bad for the price, but I’m still on the hunt for the perfect Pegasus  earrings."
3.0,I liked this But it fit kinda where I was comfortable wearing it.
3.0,"These bands are nice colors. But, with just one time that I wore it : it started loosening  up. My other option is to see it in place."
3.0,Material felt too cheap.
3.0,It's cute but doesn't fit the same as the model.
3.0,Absolutely the shirt unfortunately I can't wear it as the heat press paper is stuck to it and I am unable to get it off. Very disappointed
3.0,They are fun rings. Great to have different colors.
3.0,This did not fit at all and one speaker was not working. May be good for kids. I sent it back.
3.0,Great pajamas but received one outfit with a whole in the arm.
3.0,"These workout shorts are ""OK""... I found them to be a bit small.  To make them good I would have liked to see the running short overlay continue to the waist band and this band be a bit wider. OK shorts... Liner isn't truly Dry-Wick"
3.0,"Purchased dress, the style of dress is cute, but cheaply made and thin fabric. Used size chart to order but dress was still too big."
3.0,"This is a soft top that looked cute in the photos but wasn't flattering on me. When i put it on, it looked like a typical tshirt as opposed to a stylish top."
3.0,"First, I will say that the package arrived much sooner than I expected. I ordered it on Thursday and it arrived the following Monday. When I opened the package, the silver plating on the bail was already chipping off. That's not really a big deal, because I purchased this for myself and I can easily replace the bail with a nicer one. However, had it been a gift, it would have looked bad. The one issue that I have, that I can't do anything about, is that the stone felt like it was coated in resin. Upon closer inspection it definitely is. You can see the little bubbles in whatever coating is on the actual stone. I'm sure it's there to make the stone shinier and to help protect it, but it defeats the point in why I bought it. Had the description mentioned the stone was coated I wouldn't have purchased it."
3.0,"I’m kinda disappointed because I was so excited to receive this swimsuit and I loved it it’s adorable and classy and the material is really soft for a swimsuit, but I noticed the bottoms did not fit me and I find out that the top piece is a small and the bottoms are medium. I tried to see how I can possibly fix the bottoms but to no avail I want to return the suit and re order but I’m scared I may run into the same problem again :/"
3.0,I’m 5’1” and lift weights. So I’m not all skin and bones. I got the size Medium.<br /><br />The legs fit so comfortably but the waist band comes so high up it can cover my second set of eyes *if you get my gist* naturally it would sit right under the bust… I wouldn’t buy these unless you want something with a high waist. It’s hard to fold it down because my hips don’t fit the waist band.
3.0,"Although it fit a little large, I could work with it"
3.0,"I'm feeling a bit mixed about this dress. The listing states the top is mostly cotton, but it's actually a Rayon/Poly/Spandex mix- nothing natural feeling about that. It's cute, and I think the next size down will fit well, I just foresee the fabric getting static-y or stinky if I start sweating (or both).  I am 5'4"", 175lbs, B cup, and ordered the XL. It's definitely loose up top, and the whole thing is stretchy, so I would suggest ordering a size down, especially if you aren't very big up top."
3.0,These socks are to tight at the top of the calf and not tight enough in the foot and lower calf.
3.0,"The shirts ran significantly small then expected. Luckily I have a daughter that they fit, so I just gave them to her."
3.0,"It's cute, don't get me wrong, but trying to put it on yourself is next to impossible."
3.0,Pretty but the lace part curls up
3.0,"Looks way cuter in the picture. It was baggy/frumpy, so it is being returned. The length was good."
3.0,"Hard material.. not really soft against the skin.. The arm holes shrank when washed,in effort to soften. Was tight across the chest to start,shrinkage made it worse.  Had to give to flatter chested friend."
3.0,"I had couple of headbands which I have used for routine workout, brisk walking, and yard work. Most of them get wet and saturated quickly because I sweat strongly after a few minutes of workout.  Some of them were tight for my head after couple of uses. So, I gave this a try. It solved part of my problem, these cling to your head well but still get wet and soggy due to sweat after few minutes of use. Therefore, I use two headbands one after another: I wish this headband were more absorbent. I have rated three stars for overall satisfaction."
3.0,"The material is very good and it did help the frizz on my hair, but I don't know if I am a very dynamic sleeper because it would not stay on my head the whole night for me."
3.0,I give these a 3 because of the customer service...  👍🏼
3.0,The Hollow Mask was detailed and reusable on other chains and necklaces. The necklace the came with the item was a black string that snapped before it could be worn. It was not durable in the least but at least the charm could reused.
3.0,very light they look cool but not the best quality but what could I expect for the price
3.0,I bought these coiled key rings to help some of our autistic kids keep up with their fidget-toys while they are at school. They do help the kids keep up with their items and stop them from becoming projectiles that may be thrown across the room during meltdowns and stop items from hitting the floor and having to be picked up repeatedly.  They can get stretched out kinda easily though.
3.0,This dress fits well but it flares out at the bottom like a mermaid. I personally hate it but if you're into that look than this is perfect for you!<br />I got it to wear in Miami for a bachelorette party but ended up putting it right back in the bag after purchasing it 😔<br />I'm 5'6/145lbs. I purchased a medium
3.0,"This dress is very see through and seems to be made from costume material. Other than that, it’s cute."
3.0,"The dangling pieces individually move to and fro on the ring they hang from. The swirl on the shiva eye shell is visible if you look very closely because the earrings are not very big. Although the measurements are given, I didn't imagine the size of these earrings to be as small or dainty. I would've liked for these earrings to be a little longer so that they could stand out more and create a bolder bohemian look. The style is more of a classic look, not so bohemian. If that is what you are looking for, then these are for you. No complaints on the quality."
3.0,I am returning these lenses as they are not the same as the previous pair I purchased from Seek Optics for Oakley 5 Squared glasses.  These lenses seem to be a yellow tinted lens with a blue mirror finish - unlike the first pair I ordered which did not have the yellow tint and thus didn't obscure natural colors.  If you have 5 Squares - those lenses (at least the ones I received) are great.  These are disappointing.  I think they may have been sourced from a different manufacturer.
3.0,"The quality is decent, but the sweater runs very small in height and width."
3.0,"this is so small that I would not buy it if I have seen the product in store.  I have only wear it a few times since I bought it.  If you are the person who likes small ear rings, this would be for you, but not me."
3.0,Doesn't fit how I expected but I'm very small. So the hands somewhat fold in on each other for me.
3.0,"I ordered an identical product from another vendor here on AMZ and this version is flat. It doesn’t puff up even after much handling. It is sewn well, other than a few loose strings, and zippers work but this vendor is not as puffy as the photos or other sellers."
3.0,These were way too tight on my son so he won’t wear them.
3.0,"After 2 wears they seem stretched out. I expected a more snug fit. Not happy, but at least they were a good price."
3.0,I love it wish it was bigger
3.0,"It's a nice dress, nice pattern. But the colors aren't as vibrant as the picture suggests. What got me though, was the quality of the material. It did not feel like a $30 dress to me. The material was somewhat-sloppily constructed and was not very flattering to me. However, it was very light and flowy."
3.0,A bit small around the waist and with this cut pants tended to slide down. Fleece is very warm and comfortable.
3.0,Sally is brown! She’s a white girl lol and the quality is ok a little flimsy but they work :) thank u
3.0,Fits great in the legs but constantly pulling up the waist. There should be elastic in the waist to keep them up.
3.0,The size and craftsmanship were really good but dont put too much faith in the magnetic part of it.  It has the sticking power of suction cups on bubble wrap.
3.0,This dress runs small. Too tight and clingy for my taste.
3.0,"I’m usually a Large in Zaful bikinis but this one was too big so I would order a size down. Also, the white part shows out from the material and makes the bikini look cheap. I will be returning."
3.0,The bow isn’t a real hair bow. It’s actually just a piece of cloth. I suck at tying bows so I can’t put mine on my daughter.
3.0,"At about $2.33/pair, this is decent value pack of non-slip socks with some really odd color choices. They're soft, comfortable, and breathable, plus the rubbery backing near the achilles tendon helps prevent these socks from migrating down your foot into your shoe—you know what I’m talking about, and that’s so annoying. These are fine with sneakers and low cut boots, but I wouldn’t really call them no-show. Most flats are cut lower, and these strangely colored socks Will show. 3.5~ stars."
3.0,They were warm and comfy.  The pockets were way to deep and the length was to long for my 5.4 height.
3.0,"I’m a size 32 waist and even on the tightest it goes, it was still big on me. I still love it but wish it was smaller"
3.0,These were fine. I wore them for several years of casual play.  Then the tongue fell off and both soles snapped in half.
3.0,"I purchased a medium and it fit nicely. It was PERFECT for my squid game costume, but it was super see through. I think the quality was decent and it was soft fabric, but I would not buy this dress for casual wear."
3.0,"well,could have been better quality."
3.0,"I'm a fan of Star Wars, and upon seeing this front pocket wallet, I wanted it. Unfortunately my overall experience with the item is, meh. It definitely serves it's propose, but I wish it had a money clip and wasn't so length in it's shape. The rebel symbol is the only thing that makes this a Star Wars product. It's okay, but I find myself wanting to return to my worn down leather front pocket wallet with a money clip."
3.0,"Well,  very first one I pulled out to use was broken but the rest seem fine!"
3.0,"I ordered the green and loved the color but the material was not soft and smooth. It's like a wool sweater type of material - not my jam. Also extremely sheer, even with the dark color."
3.0,Chest area is a bit snug compared to the rest of the dress. I have big boobs but I haven't had this problem ordering an XL.
3.0,"I ordered a small and the inseam is 27 inches. After washing according manufacturer direction it shrunk an inch, now 26"" inseam. Very disappointed about that. If it wasn't for that they are PERFECT in every way and I would have given a 5."
3.0,The jacket is good  but I got  it are so many scratches I can't take  it  I have to return it
3.0,The clasp does not completely close
3.0,"Not as cute as I thought it would be. Also, the buttons are weird."
3.0,"The lenses are fine but the plastic frames are flaking apart. Kind of weird. On the other hand, they were cheap."
3.0,"I am 5'8"" and 152, medium too small, would order one size larger. After washing fits too tight. Otherwise OK quality for the price. Good weight for cool spring temperatures."
3.0,"I like the color and it offset the black and white dress that I wore it with, however, the chain is too long. Maybe the necklace would set nicer on someone with a larger bust than me (36A). I really like the pop of color but I was disappointed by the lack of adjustability."
3.0,"Was supposed to be a dress, a rober, and accessories but all I got was a robe and a sash. Material is really nice on the robe. Wish I got the dress too. Very disappointed"
3.0,"Saw a lot of reviews for this product as being great for nursing, but if you are larger chested that’s not really the case. I had to modify the button opening to work for our nursing needs so it was bigger. I do love the fit otherwise, super cozy and the fact that there are pockets is a total game changer, makes grabbing my phone or anything else in the middle of the night a snap!"
3.0,Way too small. But pretty
3.0,"The denim was nice and sturdy, which I appreciate.<br />However, the cut of the jacket itself is very weird. The wideness of the shoulders and shortness of the sleeves make the jacket look ""bunched up"" and it's uncomfortable to wear. I'm a 5'1"" girl of average shape and yet I felt like a mom trying to fit into her daughter's clothes.<br />Also, coming out of the package, the jacket has a weird smell, which I presume to be the dye of the denim... That would probably come out after being washed, but seriously, it's pretty bad."
3.0,Pants were way too small
3.0,No manual ???? how does it work ?
3.0,Nice shape and size but lasted three days of wearing before&#34; gold&#34; started disappearing. Totally gone by day 5. My experience. Upset...to say the least!
3.0,Teeny tiny with a tiny ring! Did not fit the key ring so it was disappointing! 😕
3.0,Cute outfit but too short for tall ladies
3.0,"It is a little small, and rides up because of that"
3.0,If you order silver you will receive white. Still a nice watch. Good imitation of Seiko. This watch also uses non standard watch pins. It's very difficult to resize on your own but not impossible.
3.0,"Sleeves are a bit tight around the arms, but I expected that as it’s the style of the dress."
3.0,"Pretty for costume jewlrey, kind of finicky back. Either too tight, or too loose."
3.0,"This is a lightweight, cute, crossbody bag.  For the money, I'm okay with the apparent quality. (I just received it.)  I'm not sure it is going to keep its shape well, so that is a disappointment.  It did come creased, so I'll try to smooth that out with the hair dryer or something.  (Crossing my fingers it will smooth out.)  Overall, for the money, the bag is as advertised."
3.0,"Product description is not accurate.  It's made of a fairly thick knit fabric, so it doesn't drape.  It looks like the tops of a scrubs uniform."
3.0,"I love the way these look, but they slip to the side a lot and end up dangling off my ear. They're hard to correct when this happens, and I usually end up just taking them out and putting them back in in the right spot. I've tried adjusting the hook so that they're tighter, and tried changing the angle at which the hook bends, but I haven't managed to make it work well. And then finally I lost one, it came out somehow. :/ They were pretty while they lasted, I guess."
3.0,"The band is very cute, but the top layer has already begun to peel off and I have only had it for a day. Very disappointed with the quality, but what do you expect for $7?"
3.0,Bigger than expected and looks different than the picture but still nice
3.0,"This dress fits as expected, however it does not have pockets like it says in the description.  Disappointed."
3.0,The price was good.
3.0,"The bracelet doesnt feel like silver, it feels like plastic. So i dont like it as much"
3.0,Hard to clip on by yourself
3.0,"These shorts have an odd design that is not well described in the product description and you may or may not like. Unlike all of the other swimming shorts I own, these do not have a liner. You need to wear your own underwear underneath. The fly is gusseted and covered so you can't do your business without untying the waist-string. The poly/spandex fabric is stretchy, giving you a lot of freedom of motion.<br /><br />Fabric seems durable. The printed design on the fabric looks nice, though the designs don't match up where the fabric panels are sewn together. I got size 34 and it fits pretty loose; I have to pull the waist-string really tight to get a secure fit. There are no front pockets or interior pockets, just one rear pocket with a simple velcro closure. I don't know if I want to keep a car key back there without tying it down, but then getting it out will be difficult."
3.0,"Usually when I buy undershirts I usually get a size small, but it was a little too tight. I would up size one ."
3.0,"One set is reay cute, the other 3 look like poorly spray painted jewelry... also, it didn't include all styles indicated on the description/picture."
3.0,Ruffles on the dress looked odd.
3.0,"I received the two pairs but the blue ones are not the same color blue and the black ones are solid black, whereas in the product photo on Amazon they are black on outside and blue on inside.  Disappointed."
3.0,"Nice necklace, a little thin, but it's still nice."
3.0,"They Are cute but a little big for my face and the quality isn't the best . As for fashion and planting trees for every pair purchased , that rocks !"
3.0,Exactly what u would expect out of the suit. The colors are nothing as pictured but over all ok
3.0,Super cute but fits very tight around my calves and I’m a slender.
3.0,I am 5' 2&#34; so this dress is long on me.  I am planning on high heels or taking a tuck in it at the waist to accommodate my shortness.  The length is the large on me.  Someone taller would not have a problem.<br />The fabric is soft and nice to wear.
3.0,"The material is thin, the quality just seems a little cheap,  and in my opinion, the black banned area is too high up, but other than that it's alright. If I tore it or damaged it, I wouldn't replace it with the same dress."
3.0,They are soft and we’re a good value for the money but meant for a child or person with small face like a young kid.
3.0,Tight to small
3.0,Would have liked a bit more room in the shoulders with the extra large size. We'll see how the zippers hold up. Everything seems somewhat flimsy.
3.0,Cute shoes but had to return because they run small.
3.0,Was alittle tight
3.0,Very cute  but missing arm button when I opened package and the sleeves are kinda tight.
3.0,"The only issue I had was the print was not well printed. Still like the shirt, but just seem like a poor job done. I have a friend who does screen printing for a living and yes, this was not well printed at all."
3.0,I must say the style of these dresses are very pretty and they fit well. Unfortunately the dresses are made of thin material and see thru. I ordered a light color and a dark color and still the same issue. Sorry I had to return them.
3.0,Cool shirt...it’s tighter than I thought.
3.0,doesn't match picture. but it does fit.
3.0,Sized small compared to their other lines.
3.0,"If you want this to look good with your costume I'd recommend lots of starch and an iron.  The fabric is a little flimsy, but as far as value for the money it's ok."
3.0,The bag STINKS very bad!!! Why is there a buckle that opens nothing?  I put a bounce sheet in it to help with the smell.  Other than that I do like the bag.
3.0,"I loved this skirt looking at it online, however I'm extremely sad to say that it's just not that cute on me.  I think it could stand a bit more tailoring."
3.0,"The product said it fit 2 to 6 year olds, however they were extremely tight on a three year old, not even able to wear them. The sunglasses were as cute as can be and I’m sure are good quality, they just run small."
3.0,Functional. However it comes apart if you wear the tracker snug. Also its light and gets dirty very easily.
3.0,"Roomy says they fit as expected and, while they are cute, they didn't seem to hold up to being worn for very long. I think every pair developed holes within the first month or two. Just a heads up."
3.0,shrinks after washing... hmmm.
3.0,Nice hat. Good quality.  Only complaint was sizing. It’s a bit  smaller than I’d like. I can wear it but it doesn’t cover my ears
3.0,Not a big fan of this watch strap.  It seems very large/long even on my averaged sized female wrist as I have to wear it on the closest hole leaving quite a long 'tail'.  The leather itself is not a great quality and the buckle is plastic-y feeling.  Not great quality for the price.  I'm still giving it 3 stars because the pattern is cute.
3.0,Hate the shiner material and the top rolls up and the bottoms slide down
3.0,"Beautiful dress.  Cinches waist, perfect color and material BUT sizing is incorrect.  Im a 14/16 but needed a 16/18 but in pink that size was not available.  You will need a cami for modesty."
3.0,Bought this for my 3 year old. I have to buy over and over white socks because they always get run down by toddlers. Quality is not too good. they are actually see through in some places of the sock. For the moment ok but wont last
3.0,Pretty upon arrival but the beads have faded and smudged over time.
3.0,"This product is not shown as extremely fitted, but that is how it fits.  Other similar style and priced dresses from other manufacturers ordered at the same time fit much truer to what is pictured.  It is very stretchy so it isn't that it doesn't fit, it just isn't flattering to be so fitted on a larger size lady."
3.0,"Great shirt, but sizing was way off and had to send back because it was too big."
3.0,"Very cute but material is very thin. My butt is visible. I ordered a small and it was a little too tight. I'm 5'5 135lbs 34B. Returned and ordered a medium, hoping it fits better."
3.0,VERY Wrinkled can't get out
3.0,"Very nice for the price. Colors are vibrant and fabric soft, but for being a MAXI dress, it is way too short. I'm average height and it's approx 4 inches ABOVE my ankle bone. If you are petite, it would probably fit perfectly."
3.0,This ride up while doing cardio. They fit as expected but if you are very active (versus lifting) they will shift up
3.0,you get what you pay for. the leathery covering for the end tip comes apart rather easily. after about six months the end tip of my belt is almost unusable.
3.0,"Gracias Buffallo, es muy buena !!"
3.0,I ordered expecting to receive the colors that was advertised. I received duplicate colors earrings instead. Was disappointed in that. But the earrings themselves are cute.
3.0,Real cute. Real small and real tight
3.0,got some problems with the clutch
3.0,I’m 5’2 and 135lbs ordered the small and the dress was a few inches too long. I was disappointed because it was cute and fit everywhere else but lengthwise.
3.0,"This was small for my head and I have a small head.  Also, having the string hanging down so far is awkward."
3.0,Exactly what you would expect. The carabiner  is okay quality. The JayHawk is rubbery and okay quality.
3.0,"Colors are not as described. I ordered a red And black, but it’s actually pink and black. Good quality though."
3.0,one of my minute hands fell off like the first months I had it but other than that I love kenneth cole watches
3.0,I like this hat due to the durability and SPF and coverage on my neck and the little hole for your hair.<br /> I don't like that the chin strap fell off almost immediately.  I will wear this on non-windy days.
3.0,Liked the quality for the price.  The size runs small.
3.0,"I liked it, but the charms broke off extremely easy I lost the cameo, my favorite charm. then the whole bracelet snapped. :("
3.0,"Fit is great every where the chest area is slightly big, but it can be pinned."
3.0,"Sent one back - Just a little tight, but ordered another."
3.0,"Perhaps this is my own preference but I wanted something a little thicker. This dupatta is very, very sheer so if you’re looking for something that covers completely, this is not it unfortunately."
3.0,These fall apart in the wash pretty quickly. Not great for crafts made to be resold.
3.0,"Looks great! But the zipper broke the first day I wore it. It looks cheap, and didn't zip smoothly when I got it so I should have known."
3.0,"This bag is lovely for the money.. It looks like it's much more expensive than it is. I am keeping mine bc it suits my needs and looks good unless up close. It looks like leather and even kind of feels like it. I call it &#34;vegan leather&#34; to my friends.The bag is plenty roomy but the zipper inside and on top are very cheap and do not stay zipped, especially the top one. And it sags.<br />But again, I am happy enough with it for MY needs to keep it. It's better than some butt let's face it, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I'm actually not mad at this. I think it would be quite flattering, if I ordered a size M. My normal size, Large, is quite baggy, as you can see. Unfortunately, white Mediums are out of stock, and I need it to be white for an all-white party someone's throwing.<br /><br />Fabric is fine, some stretch but not swimsuit material. Not flimsy either. The little heart zipper detail was a cute surprise.<br /><br />Will probably give it another try, when I have more funds. Good luck to you."
3.0,It's fits perfectly but the cups in it are clearly visible so I just took them out. The bottoms are slightly see through. It is cheaply made and you will be able to tell the second you get it. You simply get what you pay for and I would not recommend it.
3.0,"Nice material, but size up. Very tight."
3.0,Not a Sweater Dress
3.0,It was thinner than expected and felt/ looked a bit cheap- it was somehow ‘stiff’ material and did not have the movement I expected. It would probably photograph nice but I ended up not wearing it. It also had a hole in the armpit :/
3.0,"Absolutely gorgeous. Love this piece. It's even prettier in person. But this is day three or four of me wearing it (and not every day, either) and two of the three dangle pieces have already detached. If you solder the seams when you first get it, it might be fine, but at this point I think I've lost some of the connector loop and the gap is pretty significant. :("
3.0,"Ordered a size smaller, and still was not as fitted as I want it to be.  Returned."
3.0,Flimsy.  Not what I expected.
3.0,"The material wasn't the quality I was expecting, but the price was perfect.  It was flattering, but I needed shapewear.  Not as low cut as the picture."
3.0,I’m 4’11 usually xs or s.  Bought this sweater in an xs. I wanted to like it but the neckline looked stretched out and the sleeves too long. The sweater was also an awkward length so I returned it.
3.0,"This is a decent piece. Some of the issues I have are that it doesn't look like it will last long. The sewing isn't the best (loose threads and some of the seams don't look solid). It's not super expensive so I wasn't expecting it to be a lifetime piece, but I suspect this would only last a season or two. This should be a piece that costs $10 at most in my opinion. All that aside, it is definitely a pretty print so I am still happy with the purchase.<br /><br />The fit seems big to me. I ordered a medium and it is pretty wide. I know a kimono fit is supposed to be bigger but I still think the sizing is larger than it should be. I have uploaded some pictures for reference. I am 5'5&#34;, athletic build (broad shoulders), and generally wear a 4-6 and medium tops. Hope this review is helpful!"
3.0,"Beautiful dress. Runs a little too small based on the size chart given, high quality material and nice packaging. the only issue was size. I wish they made it in plus sizes!"
3.0,I don’t know maybe my waist is too big because if I double it or triple or  just leave it single it doesn’t do anything but roll up to my boob
3.0,"The leggings are soft, warm, stretchable and comfortable as well. The only problem with the leggings are the 2 outer linings present on both sides. So it can be work with long sweaters/tops not as normal leggings."
3.0,The material gets linty very quick
3.0,"Not a sweatshirt.  Thin fabric., Not what I expected, more like a fall shirt.  Long delivery time."
3.0,A bit large but okay..
3.0,"Me gustaron en general excepto que al ajustar no queda asi por mucho tiempo, eso no me gustó."
3.0,"So originally I had rated the dress poor because it came with a hole on the side of the hip but after getting it fixed...and trying the dress on, it looks great. It holds in just the right places. Material is not too thin...it's ok."
3.0,This bra is way too small! It is probably two or three sizes too small...
3.0,"It looks a little cheap, and it stained my bathroom counter which I don't know why. I'll see how it looks with the ensemble all together."
3.0,Just did  not ffit and  too orange
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but it's not made from the same cotton material that you'd find in similarly styled shirts found in a boutique. It's thinner and has an almost nylon sheen. Of course, there is no tag in it listing what materials it's made from so you have no way of knowing for sure. It's definitely cheaply made and is probably a knock-off of the good quality cotton shirt that I expected when I ordered it. That's always the chance you take when you buy clothing online."
3.0,"The design on this dress is beautiful and unique. The white is very vibrant. I am 160 pounds and ordered a medium and it fit. The dress was a little shorter than what I'm used to (and I almost wore it as a shirt instead because of this). I am 5'8.5"" tall and the dress stopped about 6 inches from my bottom. The sleeves did not meet my wrists either, they were a little short, maybe about a 1/2 inch - 1 inch or so. The material is soft-ish; it is comfortable. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the dress is see through. When you put the dress on you can see the white of the pockets (because the material is doubled) through the dress. I had to wear a black bra and black under shirt underneath. Overall, I do like the dress for work or lunch/dinner out."
3.0,Didn't fit the way I thought
3.0,"Doesn’t appear to be authentic. The logo detail on the back is scratched up. No tags attached, no dust bag, not boxed. The strap was poorly wadded up inside and isn’t even close to flat. It’s still a cute bag, but Disappointing to be mislead. Will be returning if this strap doesn’t flatten out."
3.0,"Really great looking piece, really grabs attention. In fact, this would be a five star rating if the time keeping wasn't so terrible on this. You'll lose several minutes a day, easily. Great if you need something to bring your suit together, not so much for telling time."
3.0,Perfect when you don't want to carry a big bulky bag! Used when we went to the beach. Easy to dust off the sand without looking dirty!
3.0,"It was hard to figure out the right size and when I tried them on, they did not fit right or feel comfortable, the way I want slippers to feel. For the price, I am donating them because someone will find they fit and are comfortable and they were cheap."
3.0,"Purchased these to wear under dresses for coverage and to prevent chafing. They fit, but were not as comfortable as other brands I have tried. They were a little smaller than expected and had a tendency to roll down at the waist and up on the thighs after wearing them for a while. They are cute with the lace band and I will still use them occasionally."
3.0,"When I received my order one of the Bokeley Coin purse was much smaller than the other (3) coin purse.<br />I think all should be the same small. So, what do you plan on doing in the manner<br />Thanks"
3.0,"Looks great, but low quality metal and my ears got inflamed from wearing this"
3.0,"I like the look of this bracelet, and the snap works well, but the adjustable slide is loose, so it doesn't stay in place and the pretty snap winds up on the underside of my wrist when I wear it.  Also, because of the design of the adjustable piece, the ends dangle, which can be annoying."
3.0,Was very cute at first but after a few wears it lost it's shape
3.0,The bra is soft and nice but happen to the color yellow? This is not yellow. The scrunchie is yellow..the package it came in was more yellow. The yellow of this bra is like you put a nice yellow shirt in the wash with black pants and the dye in the pants ran and made the yellow dirty.  Gross!!
3.0,"The shirt was a much better quality fabric than I expected for the price, but it did run large. I'm 5'3&#34;, 145 pounds and the large was way too big for me."
3.0,"love the colors and fabric, is a bit tight in the sides.  I can still wear it, for sure. But I dont like my clothes (especially work clothes) to fit snug."
3.0,thought the sunglasses were bifocals but they're actually just tinted readers
3.0,It is very thin material and there have been multiple threads coming out of the seams after 1 use.
3.0,I liked it. but one shoe lighting was not as shiny as another.
3.0,I wore it for an evening out with my husband and I fe While the dress is a wonderful fit. It is way too short. If you like to wear a long T-shirt with pants underneath of it this is the way to go. I wore it for an evening out with my husband and I feel like I had to pull it down the entire time.  There was definitely no room to bend over. However the dress is a beautiful dress on the top which is why I gave it three stars
3.0,"I like the variety of colors.  I bought them to use with my reading glasses and I thought they'd be great.  The one I used was great for about a week and now it is ineffective at keeping my glasses around my neck when I am not wearing them.  It seems like with the slightest movement they come unattached from my glasses regardless of how often I cinch the adjustable stopper up.  So my glasses are hanging or I am cussing having to slip the stopper back on.  They probably are find for holding a lighter face mask, but not so good at holding lightweight reading glasses."
3.0,"It is nice but the leather is stiff .I was hoping the leather was softer, it will take awhile to soften up."
3.0,A little bit big but at least I won't be afraid to dry it . There is a fabric mess up on the front but it's small enough to hide under my scarf. So I'm keeping.
3.0,"Looks more or less just like the picture, but the tag on the tie says 100% silk. It is not. It is polyester or microfiber."
3.0,"These sunglasses are okay. They do offer good sun protection. The lenses are way too large and they don't look that great on my husband. With that being said, he will wear them while driving because he needs to, but they're too big to wear out in public. A larger head might look better in them. The sunglasses are light weight and don't feel super cheap, but they definitely don't feel solid and high quality either. The storage case is a nice bonus."
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; about 118 lb. Bought small.<br />Little bit bulky in the weist area, how you can see it on the picture.<br />It has very strange fabric. I have the same one on my rain jacket.<br />I would return it, but it sat in my drawer for a long time"
3.0,I liked it ok. But maybe it's just not my style.
3.0,"We ordered three of these, though no one had yet reviewed them. However, none came with the small control mechanism shown on the site, nor any instructions. It looks like you plug it into whatever you use to power up electronic devices, but there also seems no part in it to retain the heat that is to be able to keep the hat and neck pieces warm for up to two hours.  That said, the hat, mouth muff and neck parts are soft and seem made well. And the order came within a few days of my ordering it. But, Amazon let me know that my email to the distribution company cannot go through to them, though apparently they are able to view it should they check online. I would like to just receive the missing control parts, and to see if these warmers work,  but have no way to do so or to communicate with them about it.<br />A day later:  I did actually get an answer, in fact, twice, about this heatable hat set. I decided to try one of these out and, of course, will not return this one. It did warm up when connected to the USB charger and I took a walk in 30+ degrees outside. It kept warmth for awhile, though not the entire hour, though I was never cold. I will heat it for longer another time and try it out again.  It is very soft and comfortable.<br /><br />2-15-21 Update: It still does not hold it's heat from plugging in more than about an hour, but seems to do a good job keeping my head and neck warm in sub-freezing temperatures of northern IL.  I'm glad I kept this one set."
3.0,"Provide little light reduction, but look good for an excellent price"
3.0,"I thought that I ordered big but it wasn't big enough. I have bought a bunch of lower priced clothing on line and I have learned that it is what you pay for. They are usually cheaply made, often times have stitching flaws and they pretty much always are the wrong size. I read reviews and look at what people say about the size and quality. These particular pants are cheap but totally cute. They DEFIANTLY do NOT look the same on me as they do on the cute model in the picture."
3.0,heel was higher than expected.  Thought it was a 2&#34; heel and it was a 2 1/2&#34; that made it uncomfortable for me.  Had to put heel pads in shoes to keep from slipping.
3.0,"Cheaper quality fabric, but still nice looking."
3.0,"Cheap, but does the job. One shoulder strap broke less than two months after buying them. I tied a knot and it's good enough."
3.0,I like the feel but they don't give you much crouch room.
3.0,"I purchased for my mother for Mother's day. - she wore before she washed it and it turned her, the chair she sat in and everything blue.  She thinks it will be fine after a few washes, but we'll see.  She was very excited to get something new to wear and she loved the print."
3.0,You get what you pay for .cheap.only one time works.two knobs don't three dials don't.
3.0,Not really made for anyone larger than a 10. I am a 14 38c and bought the extra large. I can put it in but if I jump in water there isn't enough support under neath the top will come up and over exposing yourself.  The shorts are shorter for being a larger size also.
3.0,"I like it, but I would prefer the sleeves a little bit longer."
3.0,These luggies tags been too easily
3.0,"There OK but are a little small, I can't even wear socks and but them on."
3.0,I like the wrap although the tag should have been more easily removeable as it shows.  The one size fits all is very large on my petite 5'3&#34; frame.
3.0,"This shirt fits if you follow the size chart provided on Amazon.....BUT, it is quite short in length.  Making it a poorly Made shirt.  The fabric is also very light and not of good quality.  So if you don't mind a really short shirt in the midrif and don't care it's of cheap quality fabric go for it.  Otherwise, pick a different shirt."
3.0,Beautiful shirt but required taking to the dry cleaner for pressing.  I couldn't iron the wrinkles out.  Fits perfectly and looks great!
3.0,"It's a good quality shirt...I like it, except I thought it was &#34;oversized&#34;. I wanted to wear it with leggings on Christmas Eve, but had to change, as it was too short (sleeves, the whole thing). I'll wear it with jeans instead."
3.0,True to size and soft
3.0,Not as much sun protection as expected.
3.0,"These are by far the best-fitting, best-looking pants I own.  Unfortunately, they require a LOT of special care which I am likely to screw up sooner rather than later.  First of all, the warning is that they must be laid flat to dry.  Remembering not to put them in the dryer with all the other clothes is the first challenge.  Secondly, I &#34;laid them flat&#34; to dry - really hung them on a hangar - two days ago and they are still wet.  It will take another two days, at least, for them to air dry.  The next problem is they require ironing.  Who irons anymore??  Hopefully, I will find my ironing board in the garage and the iron somewhere in a closet.  I am hoping a way can be found to maintain the excellent look and wear-ability of these pants but also to reduce the upkeep.  I now purchased a size bigger and the regular - rather than than the short - length.  I am going to wash and put them in the dryer, hoping they will come out just right.  Definitely a step in the right direction though. (BTW, please don't suggest I have the dry cleaned.  It's not going to happen.)"
3.0,This hat is tiny.  Kids only!!
3.0,Soft comfortable fabric.  As described.
3.0,"gave it to a friend, she loves it"
3.0,Did not look good on an hour glass body type
3.0,The green is a little to the aqua side and the material is not cotton like the picture looks it’s more slick material. My son still likes the sweater and has not taken it off since it came. I ordered a large thinking it would run small. However it seems to be true to size.
3.0,"This is very big. I am a medium across the board and should have ordered a small, but they don't have smalls."
3.0,"These are great pants, fits great, comfy, looks cute but the seams along the thigh and butt fray and look like they might be coming undone. It arrived like this and after wearing them a few times, they seem to look more frayed and loose...time will tell how good these are I guess."
3.0,"I had such high hopes! I bought white and it’s sheer to me, but nothing a nude or light color bra couldn’t handle. It just feels so boxy, and I don’t really love how wide the neck is. Feels more like a boat neck shirt which I don’t like. The sleeves are definitely not long enough for me, but the length of the shirt itself is good, the front falls down past the zipper of my jeans and the back falls down further. BUT I’m keeping it anyway because I know I can wear a bralette under and cuff the sleeves and it’ll still be cute. Mostly disappointed in how short the sleeves are because I have long arms. I’m 5’7”, 145lbs, 36B, athletic build and bought a medium. I’ll probably buy the next color in large to see if it’s any better for sleeve length."
3.0,Doesn’t look like it does in the picture. Much less “business casual” and much more “lounge at home.” It’s also quite an awkward fit and runs rather small.
3.0,The pearls are beautiful in wish the back was more sturdy.
3.0,"I was so excited for this suit to come in. I'm 5'4,  116 lbs, 34D and mostly wear a S or a 2. This suit fit ok but not nearly long enough in the torso area, did not cover the girls well at all! I love the back detail and the colors. I might buy another one in a M"
3.0,be gentle with this set and bring super glue with you because the stones do come out.  other than that it is a beautiful set.
3.0,Wife liked the bracelet.  Liked the color and the wrap around style.  She said it's a little difficult to fasten by herself
3.0,I like the designs they’re so cute but the only problem is that they come so big. I would buy again if they make them smaller.
3.0,"Nylon quality good but buckle not so good.  Ordered two, on one of them the metal clip on end came off.  All and all I probably would order again."
3.0,"Pants are cute. Got compliments, however, im going to order a larger size.  The reviees were corrrct meaniing the calf is so tight.  My right leg is sewn tighter than left.  Great material."
3.0,Not what I really wanted
3.0,Wish all the underwear were printed. My son only chooses the one with the prints.
3.0,"Although I have use this product, but only for casual outing. This item I only recommend purchasing for pre-teens maybe, or children; but not for adults."
3.0,"This outfit is really cute. I bought it for a cake smash photo session. However, there suspenders are wayyyyy too long. I tightened it to the max and it was still falling off of his shoulder. The onesie is perfect size but the underwear and suspender are way too big. During the photoshoot, one of the clips came off as well... almost ruined the photoshoot... I really like it, just wish it’s better made..."
3.0,Runs big color great fits like a moo moo.
3.0,The chain is good quality but the ends/clasp portion is a bit bulky and will not fit through any of the pendants I have.
3.0,"These had a few defects on the frames, it looked as if the plastic was melting in some places. They’re a very good dupe but the defect lost them a few stars for me"
3.0,"Great print, but runs small.  I’m usually a size 6 which is the higher end of small but it was way too small."
3.0,"Description says 65% cotton + 35% polyester. I think, it has more polyester than cotton."
3.0,This mask is very big for my 7 years old.
3.0,"The sleeves, top and pants were short. Loved the fabric, print, trim."
3.0,Perfect for bridesmaid jewelry. Only complaint is the necklace is very short.
3.0,"Cute but too small , you take a chance when comparing china sizes to US sizes , these “boy short” style there are practically thongs here , for anyone smaller than a US size 22 / 3x they’d be great tho , made better than I expected, anyone under a 1x would be perfectly happy with them"
3.0,The glasses are smaller than I expected but theyre pretty cute.
3.0,"The straps are excellent.  The are a better quality feel than the original.  The only problem is that the springs did not fit.  I could not get them to work.  I had to go buy new springs at Harbor Freight.  They sell a spring set their.  Other than that, had no other problems and my watch looks great again."
3.0,Fit was smaller than expected.
3.0,"I'd imagine that the pins are great when they're in normal condition. Both of mine, however, arrived with large lines across them that are either scratches or from a hair that was left in the paint before it dried. The pins came wrapped in plastic so the damage likely happened at the factory."
3.0,This dress was very see through.
3.0,"While they're not bad, they don't look much like the sunglasses in the picture. The frames and lenses are much larger than I expected, the frames are more of a silver tone than Gunmetal gray. Also, the arms are a lighter gray than I expected and are a lightweight plastic. Not bad, just not what I wanted for my husband. He says he likes them, but I think he's just trying to be nice."
3.0,cheaply made a little small in the chest area making it difficult to completely cover the chest area.
3.0,A little on the thin side. Not worth the money.
3.0,Short and runs small. Very cute though fit right occasion.
3.0,"This was cute, but it is small, so keep that in mind if you decide to buy it. It has a nice feel to it and the strap is a nice lenghth."
3.0,The jacket looked pretty nice. The size of these jackets are extremely off size. I ordered a large and it didn’t come close to fitting. I’m guessing if you need a large you probably need to order 2 sizes bigger
3.0,Cute print and nice material but NO support.  It just wasn't for me.  Sent it back.
3.0,"Very pretty, but heavy on your ears."
3.0,"The dress fit just fine, the Vines did not work at all to wrap around the legs, they did not stay and they were very easily torn. Also the shoe cover did not work well either. The outfit worked for what I needed to do last minute but not for more than a one use situation."
3.0,It looks like leather. It’s brown plastic
3.0,"My rating is kind of biased because I ordered the wrong size. If I had gotten the right one, my rating could change.<br />I assumed it was the sizes according to asian fashion since they're on the petite side opposed to the US sizes. I'm 4'10 (I'm 17, yes I'm short) and I typically order Mediums online since that usually works for me in case they shrink. Well I sure do hope this dress shrinks because I ordered a Medium and it goes passed my knees. It looks cute on the model, but didn't work out for me. The collar is a nice fit, and so is the waist, but it's just too long. If you're around my height I'd get a small, if you're around 5'3 or taller, I'd get a medium."
3.0,I like these earrings except the clasp is very flimsy.  Not sure they will stay closed on my ears and not be lost somewhere.
3.0,"Very light weight waffle knit, Material it’s pretty cheap"
3.0,Look this is a gag gift . Don’t expect an Armani for or quality . Pants are elastic and would been nice if had belt loops to put a belt on seeing it’s kinda one size fits all . You’ll have to use suspenders to keep them up . Also lights last one second or so . That was biggest disappointment. I bought it for the silliness of lights blinking lol . When I wore I turned in and first ten seconds were bright but then just faded and stopped so that was disappointing .
3.0,Fit okay - was a little small. However it was comfortable and looked cute!
3.0,"These earrings would be great, had the posts been set in the middle instead of up top. As is, they sit on my ears a little tilted, since once studded in place it causes somewhat of a lift on the opposite end. Also, the points will dig into your lobes, if you lay on your sides (I usually wear my earrings all day; only removing them when showering). I'm having to remove this before bedtime, in order to sleep comfortably.<br /><br />All that being said, I still love how they look and I haven't had any issues with the silver itself. No tarnishing or allergic reactions (my ears are pretty sensitive, so I know when something is fake or plated). These are the real deal."
3.0,I thought the pendant part was way to small as I expected it to be bigger. It is very delicate and would only look good on a petite person.
3.0,"This hat is not supposed to be a foldable hat. I was shocked to see it in a flat envelope. It is currently stuffed and I hope that and steaming will get rid of the creases. If not, it will be another return, and that's a shame, because the only thing wrong is the packaging. It's decent straw, good weight--just severely creased."
3.0,"So my daughters birthday is in December and she likes to shop on amazon and put things in my cart as a birthday list so I know what she wants.  When I saw this shirt I instantly thought there was no way this would ever make it to our door, being that it wasn't a Prime product and the seller was overseas.  But being that is was only $6 I took a chance on it.  It looks cute, right?  So I bought it among other things for her birthday and forgot about it.  This was about a month ago.<br /><br />I STILL have products touring the mid west that haven't been delivered to us yet and THIS ends up on our porch first.  I was shocked.  When my daughter opened the first thing I noticed was the material was more of a polyester/nylon than cotton like I assumed from the picture.  It still looked cute on her though.  The lace up thing is actually a white shoelace.  No biggie.  But, a wash or two later and some of the seams are coming loose.  Which can be expected from a $6 shirt.  FIVE STARS for actually arriving at our door.  THREE STARS for quality."
3.0,Caftan was too long for my 5'1&#34; frame so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.
3.0,"I usually wear medium tops, but I went with a large hoping this would be a little looser. I'm 5'9 and 176lbs, the top came right to the top of my pants in length and it was slightly loose since I went with the large. The material is VERY thin, but soft.<br />I did end up returning the top because it just wasn't what I wanted."
3.0,This is basically a decorative necklace with a ring to hold the fob. i wore it with my fob for 4 days and the fob holder was already broken.
3.0,Cute blouse fits as expected from other reviews.
3.0,"If you have breasts, this won’t work for you. I’m 5’8 d cup 150 lb and my nipples were almost showing. It’s super cute on my flat chested friend though"
3.0,"My son was ecstatic with this shirt. It was super cute. It was just larger than I thought it would be based off the sizing chart. However, my son loved it and I guess he'll love wearing it next year:). I do wish it were made of that paper thin cotton. but it's &#34;heavy weight &#34;."
3.0,Seems like decent quality. Not as long as I thought it would be.
3.0,Run ½-1  size small<br />Pretty<br />Sturdy<br />Need larger sizes.
3.0,Nice jacket. But I think it runs small. Too tight in the shoulders. I had to send it back.
3.0,I bought these for my mom and they were rather small and not as thick as we were hoping
3.0,"the shoes were adorable unfortunately they did not fit, she needed a wide, if you had carried wide I would have returned and reordered."
3.0,"Very beautiful print fabric. Design is bulky with stitching along the back that makes it difficult to secure and if you do get it tied right, the bulging back makes it look foolish instead of elegant."
3.0,The color is really nice.  The top part fit well but the bottom was way too big...I’m already wider on the bottom so that makes no sense.  I’m returning it.
3.0,Pant size 8/10 is a joke. I’m 100# w a flat ass and wear a 0. The 6 fits me with zero sag and extra room. Zero. Got for my date a booty and has me by 20# and I’ll need to go up 2 sizes. Worst sizing I’ve seen and I’ve worn many cuts of FOTL for years.
3.0,The lenses are like prescription.
3.0,"Cute, and delicate, it fits my 5"" ankles don't recommend wearing it on a regular cause I can see the bronze color peaking through the gold"
3.0,"I could not wear this comfortably. It was super cute and just what I was looking for, but the shoulder strap has no padding and the shoulder metal loops were uncomfortable and just laid on my shoulder in a funny way. I had to return it."
3.0,It fit ok but did not look flattering on me at all so I returned it.  I am 5'9&#34; and 230 lbs.
3.0,"I missed the unlined detail. No way I could keep it, too thin. Back thickness was nice, cup a little bigger the I expected, band fit as expected. Not comfortable in front."
3.0,It's so/so. It still has creases where I folded it to pack. Fine but nothing special.
3.0,"Typical KingSize product: cheap and barely good enough. Nothing special, but it is a flannel shirt that fits me."
3.0,"The hoodie is good quality, the purple is beautiful,  it just ran small on me but I'm a big girl, I'd say just be sure to order a size up from what you need if you dont want a snug fit."
3.0,A big smaller then I expected. So it’s tight in the wrong areas.
3.0,These are see thru.  Colors are fantastic- they are for sure kid size
3.0,Pretty but not as bright as the picture
3.0,Its ok but super loose even for an adult head. It keeps slipping off my and my hubbys face. It would be ok with a larger head I think.
3.0,"3-stars means &#34;It's Okay&#34;. And that was our mutual consensus. We ordered these as an add on, figuring the risk was worth it for the price. 2 loupes for $5.  My husband uses loupes frequently in his work and hobbies, and already owns a 10x and 20x loupe.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> * metal casing,<br /> * glass lenses<br /> * 21 mm lens (good size, not too big or too small for portability. this is the size my husband prefers)<br /> * great for hobby use (from coins to stamps to biology), classroom use, etc.<br /> * clear magnification; no distortion when used correctly<br /><br />Cons:<br /> * not necessarily a 30x.  The loupes we recieved were approximately 15x, when tested against our (much more expensive) 10 and 20x loupes.<br /> * 30 x 21 mm only ink-stamped. it will eventually wear off.<br /> * one glass housing seemed a bit loose<br /><br />Something we noticed, which I did not see in any other review: The label on the box (each loupe is individually boxed) includes this warning: &#34;Picture and Description are for illustration purposes only. Actual product may vary.&#34;<br />Based on that, and on the many reviews here, I think it is quite likely that some people have in fact received 30x magnification, while many others have received something of a different power.<br /><br />It is a good little loupe, and the price is great. You just need to be aware that you may or may not get a 30x power if you order this particular item."
3.0,way too big and long for me.  i am short
3.0,"The bag is too large for me. Sorry, my mistake in ordering it. I will be requesting a return and refund. Dianne"
3.0,Very nice but too heavy
3.0,"Average, nice, runs small in size, I would not by it again, or buy it as a gift someone else, it’s more show in selling, then what you get."
3.0,Looked great but too heavy especially the ear pieces.
3.0,Cute but 1 of the socks came with a hole in it
3.0,Good quality but they would be more comfortable if they had rounded edges
3.0,"The orange color was not as pictured. Brighter orange, I was hoping it was rust color"
3.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and 110lbs and this did not fit my body well. It swallowed me like a nightgown, both in length and width. I ordered the mint, expecting it to be as pictured and it was not that color at all. It was more like bright turquoise. I really wanted to love it so I was sad it didn't work out, but they were super great about returning (thus the 3 star review instead of 1-2), so if you think it may work for you, it is low risk, so try it out!"
3.0,"I found that the Grid-It does what it claims to do. I am able to put all the chargers and other stuff floating around the bottom of my bag in it and everything stays beneath the rubber straps (for the most part  - see below). However, the amount of space that this takes up was just too much in my bag. Yes it fit but it makes my bag seem so much smaller. I have a leather briefcase from Saddleback Leather that just has a big pocket and rather than use the Grid-It I've resorted to just throwing my cords into the bottom.<br /><br />When I did use this I was able to have it hold the following:<br /> - 2 lightning usb cords<br /> - iphone wall charger<br /> - iphone car charger<br /> - memory stick<br /> - PC laptop power cord<br /> - full size bluetooth mouse<br />... and there was room for more.<br /><br />Yes everything was organized but it just took up too much space. I think that I'm going to try some storage bags instead.<br /><br />Regarding how well everything was held: the product video shows the Grid-It vigorously shaken up and down without anything sliding out. When I tested the Grid-It in this fashion there was movement - especially when I slid in my iPhone 5S which is glass on both sides. It didn't fall out but if I kept on shaking it would have."
3.0,"Bought the dress in a large. The dress fit great, is very comfortable, and has a nice shape to it. It came down to my knees as well. It is made of 95% cotton, 5% spandex and is made from China. Because of that, there are a lot of wrinkles. The one downside is that it does show panty and bra lines, so be cautious of that. Had I sized up, I think it would look too loose on me."
3.0,They work for what their made for. Only thing is they are huge on a small woman's face
3.0,Glasses is good just be careful when checking out watch your TOTAL good.
3.0,Its very see through.
3.0,"But the quality control sucks. They came with an odd felt liner, which I didn’t like, so I painstakingly cut them out. I will probably get the brand name next time."
3.0,"its okay, not my favorite i've ever gotten."
3.0,"The clutch is nice, but I wish it was as vibrant as the picture.  Usually Amazon is spot on with their pics so I'm not that disappointed.  purchased a turquiose purse to match it."
3.0,"Comfy silky fabric, but very thin."
3.0,"I've ordered several pairs of these glasses in the past. I'm a kayak guide so I work on the water I really appreciate the polarization. But I use 'em hard, I break or lose them fairly often so I really appreciate their low cost. The pair I ordered most recently is different from previous pairs and are not as good. They are less durable, within a week both arms were already loose and giggly, and the frame is more shiny and slick, which I don't care for. Even the color of the lense is different, not as dark, but the polarization is about the same. For the price these are still a decent pair of shades, I just wish they were the ones I ordered originally, they used to be quite a bit better."
3.0,This is a cute product to up awareness but I thought I would get at least 3 bracelets for the price I paid!
3.0,"its well made but im 5'4 and it didnt reach my breasts from my crotch if that makes sense. when i tried it on it was a nice thick material and seemed high quality but it did cover my torso, i guess you have to be short to fit into it even though im only 5'4&#34;...."
3.0,they are really big and heavy and they dont sit centered on the backing post so when i wear them they droop and look off center. Ill be glad to re-gift these to my sister.
3.0,Beautiful piece but the magnet clasp wouldn't stay sealed and I ended up loosing it.
3.0,"Son de buena calidad pero el cierre no es muy bueno. La pulsera se abre, no tiene agarre"
3.0,Love the look but the fit was a little larger than I like. Arms too long. Also it has a strange smell that has lasted through many washes. And it sheds little pieces of fabric thst look like black eraser pieces.
3.0,I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks (a gift) and it’s already separating from how you have to take it out and put it back in. I’m so sad. I love this thing!
3.0,"These socks are too big (ordered small), I wear a size 6.<br />Had to give them to my daughter who wears a 8/8.5, she likes them though."
3.0,"The fabrics of this pj set are very nice and comfortable; however, I don't know that I would order these again. First, I would love to have had a pocket or two.  My biggest complaint, though, is the waistband---the wide ribbon threaded through and tied in front, never stays flat around the waist. The ribbon always becomes twisted inside and doesn't come close to laying smoothly.  For the price, I didn't expect these cost cutting short cuts from this brand."
3.0,"Shows a few too many lumps & bumps off, but cozy for around the house"
3.0,"These shorts are made to fit tight. I ordered based on the measurement chart, with my measurements falling on the lower range of the size, and the shorts fit exactly without any spare room.<br />The quality is just ok, I ordered the pink version and there are hemming stitches on the outside in a contrasting thread color, which looks unpolished, and some loose threads."
3.0,This is an OK every day band it’s not as pretty as the other bands that I’ve bought on here with the bigger rhinestones the stones don’t sparkle very much and the silver is not that shiny I just kind a looks like it’s old and doll but if you want something cheap for every day where that you don’t mess up at work then this is perfect for you I don’t think it was worth the money personally but you might
3.0,"Machine wash cold like colors, line dried. Long Sleeve on one side with strap on other shoulder, followed by long sleeve. Other distinguishing feature is the hem line. Small knotted section of bottom, just another completely unique feature. The hem line is at my waist, so not too long. I prefer longer shirts. Waffle print material. It's a little stiff, but should be better after washing. Red is vibrant!  Little tight around my chest, going to see if I can stretch a tiny bit between coming out of the washer and line drying. Cotton and Polyester material. Not soft but that's ok with me. Product page says hand wash, but I really don't think that's warranted for this material.<br /><br />UPDATED 2/17<br />Sizing still runs small, but look at the latest picture. Shirt is next to dark red/maroon color. I still think color is vibrant red.<br /><br />Size chart- order up...<br />Small Bust: 87cm/34""--Sleeve: 60cm/23.5""--Length: 70cm/27.5""<br />Medium Bust: 92cm/36""--Sleeve: 61cm/24""--Length: 72cm/28.5""<br />Large Bust: 97cm/38""--Sleeve: 62cm/24.5""--Length: 74cm/29""<br />X-Large Bust: 102cm/40""--Sleeve: 63cm/25""--Length: 76cm/29.5""<br />XX-Large Bust: 107cm/42""--Sleeve: 64cm/25.5""--Length: 78cm/30"""
3.0,The only thing I would change would be the length.  Its kind of short in the front.. so I have to wear a longer top/tank under.  But other than that... I'm happy with it.
3.0,Disappointed in how flimsy and cheaply made with the chain
3.0,"It fit well, but it looks much different in real life and the fabric feels a bit cheap. Also, the packaging was very flimsy and caused the shirt to wrinkle and necklace to break."
3.0,Looks nice but it got ripped immediately.  String that goes around it wery weak. That is the only reason i am leaving 3 stars.
3.0,"Bag looks nice, works well for a train commute to work, is tall enough to fit things such as epi-pen. Had a strong, bad chemical smell when it arrived. Hung it outside overnight and the smell was mostly gone."
3.0,"When I first received this item, I was dissapointed, it was small(about an inch) and looked cheapy cheapy. The silver was really thin and it had bent slightly during shipping. I had bought it as a present for my wife, and she actually loved it because it was so unique. So, credit where credit is due, ""it's unique,"" although it's not the greatest quality and  kinda britle looking."
3.0,Ok a bit small
3.0,Cute but fell apart quickly
3.0,This jacket is very warm but it is not true to size. I brought an X-large and it's very snug.
3.0,It was okay but felt heavy in the eye lids
3.0,Cute dress didn’t fit my body right returning
3.0,It was not a red color - it was orange when put next to red 😥
3.0,"Decent designs, some too ""cutesy"" to use. Unfortunately for me I'll not be using them much because it doesn't fit my head (21 in cap size/diameter) in combo with having long hair that goes in a bun. It's constantly sliding off despite tying it as tightly as I can."
3.0,It was too small for me but nice.
3.0,Sizes sometimes get to me on Amazon.  Sometimes the same size does not match all the products as I am quite aware of.  This is one time I wished I had gone ahead and order a bigger size.  Ah well.  The dress is good for the price.  Just the color and style I wanted. I will wear it whenever I loose some pounds.
3.0,Not great quality was overall disappointed in the material to be honest.
3.0,Oh my GANDHI. It's freaking huge.
3.0,It's very wide and the stones/flower is very large
3.0,"Umm they are pretty nice and gold. They are loose, but I can live with that. Umm would definitely never spend my money again on this item!!😒😓😴😴"
3.0,Beautiful but too small. Wish it came bigger
3.0,Cute but had to return they send me a large instead of small
3.0,Material is somewhat flimsy and not cotton. It ran larger than expected.
3.0,THEY FIT OKAY WE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH SNOW BUT WE HAVE SOME AND HE LIKES HIS BOOTS
3.0,Be careful ... it's tiny ... not like the normal sized seatbelt ones ... look at demensions
3.0,The clip is not very secure
3.0,"Fit well, on the smaller side than larger. Very comfortable."
3.0,cut is super low and buttons do not work its very thin and sleeeves ar super tight!
3.0,"This little number was so comfortable, well made and fit like a glove!"
3.0,Nice looking - frame flimsy.  The style has great potential - but the flimsiness of the product is detracting from a five star rating.
3.0,a great dress!!! except that it ripped near the zipper upon first wear :(
3.0,"Beautifully made. Good quality. However, they are very small and do not fit comfortably around my legs. Wish they would. Guess I can re gift to one of my nieces."
3.0,"Nice hat, but not the same color pink. It’s actually more of a salmon color. The wrinkles are tough to get out from how they folded it when it was shipped. Overall though, it’s a nice looking hat, with an average fit."
3.0,They didn’t fit and didn’t stay clipped onto pants.
3.0,Not quite as long as I was anticipating. It’s cute but needed to be a tad longer
3.0,"Pretty dress, though I think I need to put the BonBons away"
3.0,Dress gave me Jessica Rabbit vibes and I’m not mad at it. Only thing is you get what you pay for and it feels cheap. Wore it once and the slit already is ripped where the fabric meets. Fabric is lined on the inside and feels almost like flannel. I’m 5’7” 165 36DD and got a L and it fit nicely.
3.0,There was a lot of anticipation waiting to see if my 16yr. old would like them.  He has some color blindness and so his friends and family all pitched in and when the time came and the video was rolling I noticed an initial excitement as he realized what it was however the results when he put them on wasn't as exciting.  Now I'm not saying it was a disappointment I'm just saying that his results weren't as dramatic as some of the video's we'd seen.  Something I wished we could have done first was to have him try them on in daylight because the results in the daytime were more dramatic.  My boy said that the colors were more vibrant as we drove through the fall colors.  The biggest disappointment was that he wasn't able to pass the color blind test app on his android phone.  So my verdict so far is that it has helped him but not as much as I was hoping.  By the way the glasses seemed to be of good quality and I noticed that they enhanced my vision even though I'm not color blind.  Bottom line is that I would say give them a try if you can afford them and help further the technology forward because as far as I know this is all that's available at this time.
3.0,Plastic feathers. Looks cheap because they are.
3.0,"they run small. the large I ordered feels like a snug medium. I'm sure they'll stretch out.<br /><br />speaking of stretch. the pattern portion (I got tropical red) is black. on the outside. white on the inside. so when I bend my knee the white shows thru. not great. why would they make the fabric this way?<br /><br />they are tight. buy a size up, if not two. can't wait to see if it stains my clothes in the wash! you never know with amazon.<br /><br />and no, I will not change my review for a refund."
3.0,"Cuts off circulation at the top of the sock, and I have average legs. Everything else about the socks' support is great."
3.0,"I have worn it, color is nice.  I was surprised though, it did not have a clasp or even a snap to keep it on.  It just folds over.<br />I have not lost it."
3.0,"At first, I loved these shorts. Super comfortable and cute. It did lint like no tomorrow however. By the first wash however, the band became super twisted up in the fabric. It definitely feels like it has shrunk as well. Disappointed in how it fits now."
3.0,"I like that it holds a lot of my products, but when you hang it, they tend to spill out of the front.  Wish there were a little more support to hold the items in the bag while it's hanging."
3.0,Size up very tight after I washed them for my daughter
3.0,Cool good looking shoes<br /><br />Only one lit
3.0,"A little small, but that is my fault as I was asked for measurements."
3.0,"Like the color, fabric and cut of the top. It is really small in the waist and ribs. The fabric is heavier than some and doesn't cling."
3.0,"Not thrilled with the heavy weight silver zipper, much prefer the black hidden zipper on opposite side. However, it fits my iPhone, lipstick, card, cash, etc. just right.  Just note that isn't much bigger.  Barring the big zipper it would be at least a 4-star."
3.0,"I contacted the seller to ask what size to purchase. I gave my measurements and was recommended a size 8. I am 5’7, 135 lbs. I did need it in a rush, and the dress arrived as they said it would. It was huge on me and needed fast alterations which cost an additional $150 dollars. The dress was nice once altered, I ordered red; the color was rich and looked elegant in photos."
3.0,"Bought for my grandson. They fit smaller then expected , very thin, poor quality."
3.0,"Seems to be quality made but very stiff, thick, heavy leather. Guess it would get better with time. Bought for my eighty year old dad to replace one he had for years. He was real keen onit but said he'd give it a try. It's rather large too."
3.0,I liked the material of the rings but I didn't like that they are all the same size.....none fit my pinky or my thumb.
3.0,They are okay.  Comfortable but I fear they will not last long. For what I paid they will do.
3.0,"I fit good and looks good, Helps with glare for sure, I just wish that lents were a bit darker"
3.0,Looked nice but not practical; can’t open very wide- it’s very stiff and I like more of a flexible opening-my daughter loved hers but she likes the hard leather vs soft ;) if you’re buying the look you’ll be happy- if you want space to fit more than cell phone and a few lipsticks not for you; there is space to put credit cards though
3.0,Logo is different from the advertisement. If you want the vintage Panther helmet this is the product for you.
3.0,These are pretty close to skinny jeans. Waist fit ok but pretty tight in the legs.
3.0,Beautiful dress but too small in the bust area. I am a 36d and it wont close with the xl. Too bad they dont have a larger size to accommodate the bust.
3.0,"Originally i ordered a large,  same size as Every shirt i own. It was really snug,  and the reflective chest band felt like a restraint.  Returned and ordered an XL, which i am not. It fits but it's way to long so i have to tuck it in.  Great concept for the shirt live the distressed look,  old glory,  sizing needs help"
3.0,"these are super cute! and they fit really well. BUT i am so sad that the material (especially the bottoms) are SUPER thin. NOT squat proof, and your underwear CLEARLY shows through the fabric :("
3.0,Idk if this is a one size fits all piece however it is not as long as pictured<br />I believe if you are a thin as the model it still wouldn't be that long however it's a beautiful piece
3.0,"Wanted to love these, but I don’t. They are cut very weird. I’m short and curvy with thick thighs and no butt. The butt fits fine, the waist gaps a bit. The thighs are actually a bit baggy but the knees are really tight. The fabric is “crunchy”- repels dirt and hay well, but it feels like a cheap suit. On the plus side, it wasn’t slippery in the saddle despite its appearance and feel. I’ll continue to wear them because I washed them prior to wearing and can’t return them but I would not purchase these again."
3.0,"Nice fit, great color, but the fabric has an overly synthetic feel."
3.0,"These are just OK.  They look and feel very nice, but the lenses are cheap and too dark - so much so unless it's mid-day sunshine, I cannot wear them."
3.0,Very cute and true to size but not the greatest quality. Very thin material.
3.0,It is not oversized as I see it.
3.0,Runs small. Order 2 sizes up.  I wear a 2xl and it clung to my waist.
3.0,"These shorts are not breathable, you will get very sweaty if you exercise in them - all the heat stays underneath them!<br />They're not physically uncomfortable, they just don't really breathe at all."
3.0,Very cute design but lower back straps were way too large on my daughter.
3.0,"This dress is a bit rediculous. It pretends to be an actual tailored dress, but it isn't. The fabric is heavy cotton for a Boho look and feel. However, the style of the dresse and the fabric are completely mismatched. Actually, the top of the dress is a very strange pairing with its lower half too. The dress has a Hobo vibe instead. It also came with two thick stains. I hope they are not from someone's nose."
3.0,This dress was cute and felt nice. It is a thin fabric. I am always looking for dresses with pockets. I have along torso so the bodice does not fit quite right. A shame.
3.0,"I was really not pleased with the quality of this bracelet..however, it was very inexpensive to I can't complain too much."
3.0,Looks wierd
3.0,"Good for adults, too big for kids, even adjusting it as far as possible -had to modify item to make it work for my girl."
3.0,Pretty thin but can't expect much for the price.
3.0,I wasn't really impressed with this product. The product was a bit tight on me. I didn't mind that so much as that's my preference over loose in this case. The real things that kind of made to lacking in my book was the fact that the arms felt a bit over tight and the quality of material was just generally lacking from the experience I had. I'm sure it's great for some things and likely for some people. I just wasn't impressed in any way that made me think that I would really want to keep it.
3.0,Is not shiny & color is red & black mixed. Returned.
3.0,"It arrived sooner than i thought it would, the fabric is nice... and if the outfit fit right, it'd be comfortable fabric for a night out.. The torso was way too short on me, but I'm wondering if maybe i lost weight in my stomach and muffin top if thatd make the difference for me. I wear size XL tops and L bottoms so I was hoping the XL romper would fit. I am working on losing weight so i might keep it and see if it fits right after i lose the weight i want to lose. This is the first romper I've ever tried so I'll have to try some more out to have something to compare this one to. Rompers I'm sure are hard to size because everyones bodies are so different, but if you're lucky enough to have this fit you then I'm jealous lol I also was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discount for an honest review. Thank you to the seller for allowing me to try your product at the discounted price!"
3.0,not that useful
3.0,"UPDATE: The seller reached out to me and offered to replace the umbrella with a larger model. They have been very gracious, and very willing to do all they can to provide a product that will work for my needs. The original product wasn’t right for me, but I sincerely appreciate a seller who cares about their customers, and this one definitely does.<br /><br />This is the worst umbrella I’ve ever purchased.  First, it’s so incredibly small and shallow, the small bag I carry every day is drenched. The double canopy is supposed to allow air to pass through and prevent the umbrella from flipping inside out. This one failed miserably - it flipped inside out several times in a four minute time period in only mild wind. A total waste of money."
3.0,This is a cute dress ( one with elastic waist and flowy sleeves) however gave 3 stars because it fit me poorly. I am large busted 36ddd and 5'8 200lb give or take. 42 34 43 i have a long torso so the waist band hit me right under the bust and it looked dumpy.<br /><br />If you are large busted but have a short torso OR long torso with average bust then i think this will look classy.<br /><br />I will be returning unfortunately
3.0,Love the shirt but runs a little small...
3.0,"I ordered a medium, I am a 34B in bust size and weigh 125 lbs. The bottom part fit well however the bust area is a bit small for me."
3.0,"incredibly cheap material, and almost see through bottoms."
3.0,"after two months one of the arms fell off, the spring broke.  I like these glasses and know they are inexpensive, but really? only two months before they broke??"
3.0,"These dresses run smaller than sizes in US Department Stores. For price, quality is pretty good. Needs care in home laundering."
3.0,The braclet broke the same night I wore it and the glue on ring wasn’t strong and separated when I got it so I used super glue.  The necklace and mask were super cute though.
3.0,The logo on this shirt is why I purchased as the Vic 20 was my first computer but the shirt itself is 2 shades of blue
3.0,"They gave me droopy crotch, so not crazy about the fit. But they were warmer for the NE weather here."
3.0,"Fit well, touch part works, more like a liner, not a cold weather glove, stitches have started coming loose."
3.0,Ran small.  Short waisted.
3.0,"The ring size is pretty dead on I have a size nine, but by the pictures I thought the actual ring would be bigger than it is. I’m pretty disappointed in how small it is because you can’t actually really see the bee that well but other than that it’s a cute ring"
3.0,"Very see thru, not quite as advertised"
3.0,"The shirt runs short if you're a taller girl.  I'm 5'7"" and the shirt runs at an unflattering length."
3.0,"Clings & is fitted, waistline may not fall in right place on various body types, if I lifted my arms straight out to form the letter 'T' the skirt came up noticeably, the slit exposed 'things', the waist on dress was starting into my bust line. I'm aware that this dress wasn't made to play sports in, but if you were to be doing a presentation raising  your arms, showing a house with interior steps ahead of the client, even hugging people, would cause your shoulders to raise and would not be ideal activity while wearing this dress, in my opinion. I loved the style, it had some stretch to it and the sleeves fit nicely on my larger biceps, which I have troubles accommodating. I found black 'Mary Jane' style thick heeled shoes and felt very 'put together' for being completely out of my norm for apparel. I have not laundered the dress so I can not review on how the fabric turned out, shrinkage, or outcome after that process"
3.0,Thinner than I thought I was buying.
3.0,"These look stiff and uncomfortable.  They were very thick, and ultimately too thick for our relatively mild winters.  These are probably best suited for real cold winter weather."
3.0,True to Size but neckline was to awkwardly high. I returned it.
3.0,"The bottoms fit perfectly, however the top was a little disappointing. I have a DD and the chest pads were too high, and my little sister has barely a B and they were still high, so it would've been nice to  be removable and adjustable pads and the mesh that it was in."
3.0,"Nice ring, true fit for size ordered. Not too thrilled that it came with a nick on the top of the ring."
3.0,nothing amazing
3.0,"This shirt itself was really cute, however it is not true to it's size. Really tight and it doesn't seem to stretch enough to feel comfortable."
3.0,Only issue is the material is very thick and it doesn't close very well
3.0,Gets wrinkle everywhere. Hope they use better fabric.
3.0,"Very cute. However, fit kind of big for my 6 year old and the seem ripped after 2 days"
3.0,Bought these for the cold weather when riding bike in the morning and they do not stand up to the temps at about 38 degrees.
3.0,Runs small even on a petite girl.
3.0,This bra is super cute.  I ordered 2 sizes up because it mentioned they were asian sizes and I'm not a small person. It's still almost too small but I can wear it.  I might consider going up 3 sizes if you are going to order.
3.0,"Had potential, but covers too much, like the sraps are huge, but bigger than appear in pictures."
3.0,"Beautiful boot, but did not fit my leg."
3.0,"This is a nice looking hat. It came smashed in a box, folded in half. I could never get the creases out."
3.0,"Background: I am a petite woman. I am 5'2&#34;, and about 115 lbs. My measurements are 34&#34; bust (size 32D bras), 28&#34; waist, and 33.5&#34; hip. For reference, I am usually a size S in tops at Old Navy/Express, and a size 6 in tops at H&M. For bottoms, I am a size 0/2 at Express/Old Navy, and a size 6 in shorts at H&M.<br /><br />Bikini Top: As previously mentioned, it's hard for me to find a top where my boobs don't feel like they're going to fall out. I got a medium in this and it fit perfectly! It covers everything well, and provides enough support where I can do jumping jacks and cartwheels and I don't feel like I'm going to flash anyone. IMPORTANT NOTE: the dye on this top keeps rubbing off. I washed it before I wore it to the beach, and when I came home, I had black marks on my boob (I didn't go in the water). Then, I washed it again with a light colored bra, and my bra had black marks on it. That was highly disappointing.<br /><br />Bikini Bottom: My butt is pretty dang flat. Pants tend to slide down on me, and I usually need a belt (unless they're high waisted). Even with that in mind, and the fact that I got a medium, these bottoms were EXTREMELY tight. You know how you can get a muffin top when the band is too tight? It was like that, but on my butt. Normally, I like my bikini bottoms to fit a little tight since the water makes them stretch, but these were still too tight!<br /><br />I ended up keeping this because I liked the top so much, and the price wasn't too bad."
3.0,I think it's really cute but the long strap that I'm assuming was supposed to come with it as it has in pictures did not come with it. It's a little smaller than what I was looking for but it is a great purse and would recommend it otherwise.
3.0,Nice pants Will return and get one size larger though
3.0,Purchased this for my boyfriends birthday. One of the winders did not operate and the screws in the hinges were loose and would not tighten. I had to return and order another one. Lets hope the 2nd one works because its a beautiful piece.
3.0,"Buy at least 1 size up.  It is not true to size.  I like the hoodie, just had to give it to someone else."
3.0,"I got these for a child  so they are to big, they are even big for me wasn't the size it stated sad we were"
3.0,Clasp too small & difficult to secure otherwise they are very cute.
3.0,"love the design and color but just fits weird. bc in the picture it looks more cropped but it’s actually like a normal shirt length. and lots of extra room in the chest area, but that might just be me."
3.0,Bought it for my helix piercing but I don't think it is large enough to actually wrap around my ear.
3.0,"this is not a swimsuit. it has no liner. no cups. just a spandex bodysuit. i still gave it 3 stars because it does fit well and delivery was super fast. im keeping it because i wore it as a bodysuit with a skirt and a little sweater and it looked really cute. if you are looking for an actual swimsuit that you'd like to wear in public and you have any kind of body at all, this is not the buy for you."
3.0,I don't care for them
3.0,This was cute but the color was really pink/flesh toned and looked weird with my super pale skin.
3.0,"These would be great if it weren’t for the little rim of metal underneath the balls on the studs. I can feel that metal in my piercing and it irritates the holes, makes them red. At first, I thought that they were having an allergic reaction but I can wear steel just fine in any of my piercings which is why I purchased them but nope. It’s the extra metal. The prong set backings were also a bit difficult to take off and put on as they were a bit stiff. It was actually difficult to tell the difference between the rose gold and yellow gold pair. I actually took a photo of both pairs with the flash on to be able to tell the difference. I cannot recommend these due to the irritation from the metal rim on all of the earrings. They seem cheaply made and it sucks because I really like the way they look but their too uncomfortable to wear! I purchased the 3mm size for referance."
3.0,"The set is beautiful and they came quickly. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the green aventurine was not attached to the pendant, I was able to glue it back myself to make it still useable. I only received 8 of the 9 crystal pendants, the Opal pendant was missing. Disappointed that I did not receive all 9 pendants."
3.0,Served its purpose though
3.0,I bought one size bigger than I usually wear. It is comfortable but I expected full length nightgown and it only goes to just below my knees. I am not tall! So don't buy this if you are and want a long nightgown.
3.0,Why is the zipper underneath the armpit??? The overall fit is okay however when I first tried to slip it on I did not realize there was a zipper. I wasn't even able to get it over my chest without it feeling like I was going to suffocate. However once I realized where the zipper was which is in the most awkward spot ever I was able to actually slip it on properly without any problems. However because of the fact that I am larger in the chest area trying to reach over and underneath my armpit to zip up is a little difficult to do by myself. So if you are a larger in the chest area I would consider ordering a size up as it does tie in the back so you'll be able to fit it accordingly.
3.0,"Returned. Made me look all lumpy and pointy. Just not the right fit for me, but looked like decent bras for the price!"
3.0,The heat doesn't last long
3.0,"I love this band.  It is my second purchase, but it is not all leather.<br />Pros: thin design, fast shipping, color<br />Cons:  Band back is not leather and you cannot get it wet AT ALL, it will  crack and fall apart; rubber-ish material that is bonded on sides to hole front and back  together cracks and splits.<br />My opinion is to keep looking and pass on this band."
3.0,"I have mixed feeling about these. When I first received them and tried them on I decided right away that I was going to send them back. They go up so much further on my stomach than I'd thought they would and somehow, even though I'm only 5'4 , they are a bit short on me which is new because usually everything drags on the ground. They're on the verge of being high-waters. However, laundry day rolled around and I had an appointment to get to so I grabbed these as a last resort and found out they are actually really comfortable. They don't look or feel like they would be when you take them out of the package but, as a connoisseur of yoga pants, I can assure you that these will pleasantly surprise you. They attract hair like you wouldn't believe though so if you have pets, best keep a lint roller nearby."
3.0,The top fits but the bottoms are extremely small.
3.0,It is very cute but runs small
3.0,"This came out of the package with a purple hue, and is somewhat see through."
3.0,What I received is not like the item pictured. Cute but the colors were off
3.0,"Pros - nice material, good colors, feels solid and durable<br /><br />Cons - I wear a large or medium depending on manufacturer. I went with large. The tummy and crotch area were pretty loose (and therefore it didn't control my tummy), however the waistband was comparatively very tight and kind of squished my body in a weird way and caused me to look like I have a bunch of back fat and weird-shaped hips. I don't usually have that problem with leggings. Had to return it. :("
3.0,Overall a nice sweater however the length was to short for me.
3.0,Great price for the quanity.
3.0,I followed the size chart and it was way to big
3.0,I think the earrings are darling and just what I was looking for as far as style but the hoops are very small and not as they appear. I have never worn them as a result. I should have returned them but was busy and never did.
3.0,Need to return because the small runs big. I’m a size 2 and thin and drowning in the small. The one sent is like a size 4. Everything else seemed fine but the dress is bulkier than pictured. Not exactly what I was hoping for.
3.0,I really liked the Top. But ordered my normal size and is too small. Unfortunately it doesn't come in a bigger size.
3.0,"Rise is waaaay too short. I either have to pull them all the way and risk giving myself an atomic wedgie, or a let them sit low and feel the top of my a$$ rub against the seat of my pants. I wonder if, when they design these, they take measurements off of multiple &#34;big men&#34; and create a model based off of the averages...or if they just eye it up and say &#34;yeah, that'll cover 'em.&#34;"
3.0,"Quality and color of the product as expected and as per the price. Size is also as mentioned, ok as officewear and better as casual T-shirt."
3.0,"Love that dress, fit as expected! BUT IT IS NOT A GREEN COLOR. The dress is more of a TEAL. Usually, this would bother me so much  but I bought it for St. Patricks Day"
3.0,"The glasses are OK for the money spent  however they are not as large in the lens department as I like.  But I,will use them."
3.0,I had to return as the dress was too shiny looking for my taste.
3.0,"Cute watch, but the band comes loose a lot when the loop that holds the overlap down slides off.  May work better for smaller wrists--my wrist is 8&#34;"
3.0,Very very thin pants.
3.0,"Mid section is snug and short but the sleevesand shoulders are long and loose. And I get it's ""underwear"" but the rough stitching only in certain places makes it look inside out. I wear Carhartt everyday, not this"
3.0,"Shiny and clean,however, the sizes were messed up. Instead of receiving two of each size, I received 2 of the shortest, 1 of the middle, and 3 of the longest size. Since it was the longest size I was mostly after, I can live with it. However, shipments should always come as ordered."
3.0,Nice shoes but run way too big so we'll have to wait a year to wear them ☹️.
3.0,Cute jacket. Not warm at all for winter
3.0,"Pretty good quality. Nice design. They definitely fit a little strangely in the ass, regardless of your ..volume.  Its as if the fabric just doesn't really care about your ass if that makes any sort of sense.  The look good but don't feel great.  Good for a first impression but then just go ahead and take them off.  I don't wear them frequently.  You won't either."
3.0,"It was not as I imagined, the two pieces also had a defect"
3.0,Does not stay clasped.
3.0,It's a pretty dress but the top of dress is VERY SHEER
3.0,"Not great, not bad."
3.0,"small pearls, but shiny. tight fit on a normal neck. so it depends on what you want for a pearl necklace."
3.0,"Material is thin and just didn’t look good on me.  I actually got 2 sizes, tried on the larger one and it was snug around the chest so I suggest getting a larger than your normal size.  I am short, overweight and older.  It would likely look good on someone taller, average weight and younger"
3.0,Nice enough dress but it runs small. Usually a medium fits just right; this was very snug.
3.0,Not a perfect cut. A little off with the stitching
3.0,Cute but the elastic band was turned and the quality was iffy. Also runs
3.0,Sun classes are jus fine
3.0,This mask was soft and would have been comfortable except for the fact that everytime I would breathe in the mask would get sucked into my mouth.
3.0,They are very pretty earrings. They we're a bit larger than I thought they would be and I'm not sure how long I could wear them because of their weight.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8af94e96d9d6db9574c0df7676e40b92]] I live in Montana and its too cold to walk eggs in the winter, its -20 plus wind chill at times. I thought this would be a good way to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go in the winter.<br />Its a little loud and doesn't seem to work when its only plugged in. It seems to need brand new batteries every time, takes 4 double A batteries. I am using the rechargeable batteries but I think I'm going to return it."
3.0,Hoped for better material
3.0,Cobra buckle appears to be cast. Would not rely on excess weight being held but a good camping belt.
3.0,Love how it looks with my key. Only downside was that the pin came off where the key is held; and I had only had it for two weeks when it fell off.<br />I had ensured it was secured after attaching my key.
3.0,"Nice, bright light. Why not 5 stars? It simply wouldn't turn off the second time we turned it on."
3.0,The pattern was not the same as pictured but still nice. The material is thin and light weight. It's ok and you can't beat the price
3.0,Groin area is very &#34;revealing&#34;.
3.0,Attractive and sturdy
3.0,The shirt is really cute but this denim blue color in the picture is actually a sky blue when u get it. Not denim color as pictured at all.
3.0,"Not horrible..especially for the price, but they do break easily, and some of the chains were already broken when I received them. I wish the quality was a little better but as the saying goes you get what you pay for."
3.0,I didn't expect the crew neck from the photo.  It's very restrictive.
3.0,MUCH shorter than photo shows.
3.0,"The price was right, the lenses were too small. Other than that they were definitely worth the purchase. If I could only find some big Police style Aviators like the ones from CHiPs..."
3.0,I ordered two of these dresses they kind a look like a nightgown very nice sexy dress it was not read if you’re wanting a red red it is not red it’s more of a darker salmon color
3.0,"I like the look of all three of these chains, but unfortunately the rubber tip came off within a week."
3.0,"Really nice boots, but WAYYYY too small. I wear an 11w, so I ordered a 12 just to be safe. They didn't fit at all. They fit like a size 10. I didn't return them though, my mom (who wears a size 10) wants them."
3.0,"I didnt expect this to be a slick, shiny material. This is not a cotton casual dress."
3.0,👍👎🏻👍👎🏻
3.0,"Looks great, but not very comfortable"
3.0,This product is alright. It served its purpose as a beach over up but it looks kinda cheaply made to me... husband loves it and says it’s cute but I can tell it’s cheaply made.
3.0,"It’s a nice shirt, but the description didn’t say what size this shirt was, so I decided to take a gamble and ended up with a medium. I was hoping for a small. I wish there would have been an option to select your size."
3.0,"I love this hat. When I first got it it was great. As everyone else is saying, the connections are incredibly poor. It lasted about 3 wears before the connections came loose. It is an easy cheap fix, but I shouldn’t have to do that after paying almost $30. It wouldn’t take much for them to do it right the first time."
3.0,Make sure to read if your specific size will ship Prime. Product took a long time to ship.
3.0,Fits fine width wise but not very long.
3.0,"Because these are spanx, I expected the lace material in the back, would also provide some light shaping, but it does not. Which was specifically what I wanted these for, if they did, I would buy a lot more of these panties because the fit is nice.<br /><br />They are very cute on and super comfortable, but I cant afford to wear 24$ exclusively."
3.0,Just very low quality for the price
3.0,"This is cute, but it’s pretty short. I have somewhat of a long torso and it comes up above my hips. Not sure if I’m keeping it yet."
3.0,"Cute, just cheaply made."
3.0,Was a bit on the small side
3.0,They're cheap made.  Already had to go by Walmart and have them put a nose pad on for me for free.  Going back to Walmart for them to replace a screw next when I have the time.
3.0,"Really tight at chest vs loose at waist. Odd fit, waited to long to return it"
3.0,"When the alarm goes off, it definitely shocks you. I have it set at 80% and to do the 5 jumping jacks in order to turn it off. BUT it has a buzzing noise that goes off and gets higher and higher pitch until you get the 5th jumping jack done. It’s definitely not silent. I wish I could turn off the buzzing noise, but every setting is on silent. I’m a very heavy sleeper (hence getting this), but my girlfriend is a very light sleeper. The buzzing noise wakes her up right away, even before the shocking wakes me up. So for that matter I give it 3 stars. It’s also a very spendy alarm clock, but it’s still the best chance I’ve had with an alarm that will actually wake me up. Would I recommend? Eh. Yeah I’d say give it a shot if you’re in the same boat I was in when no alarm would work, no matter how loud it was or where you put it in the room. So if that’s you, give it a shot."
3.0,"It is a nice watch but was disappointed with the hands illumination, the picture showed it as very bright but I have not been able to see it at all in the dark."
3.0,it seems to be painted on blue my string was white now its blue and the beads are fadding but still look cool
3.0,Nice bag but too large for me.  A lot of folks would consider this just right.  Nicely made.
3.0,"The material is weird and the top was baggier than it should have been, I had to wear a cami under it to make it less baggy, but it still was in my arms. Not very flattering:/"
3.0,Not good quality and size is definitely wrong. Cute tho
3.0,"PJ's look great, my son really likes the design, but they are at least a size too small."
3.0,The jeans fit perfect I am a size 11/12 n order a large... only thing I did not like was the zipper came defective.. but nothing serious and I can get that fix for $7..
3.0,"I ordered the v pattern with the colors black, white, and grey. However, I received a sweater with a horizontal pattern of these colors. I liked the sweater, but was not happy that the pattern differed from what I ordered because that was the pattern I wanted. Even though it wasn't the pattern that I wanted I still like the sweater. It is thick and warm, feels like a cable knit sweater. I ordered a size medium and am 160 pounds and 5'8 1/2"" tall and it fit well. I had no issues with the length of the sweater or the arms being short. The turtleneck is shorter, but I like that."
3.0,Pretty. I have a skinny neck and just fits.<br />Tight
3.0,"Cute dress, but it is slightly see-through. More of a swimsuit coverup"
3.0,Its super thin?but cute for a simple night out.
3.0,"Check the batteries!! I bought 3 suits and plan on taking them overseas for Christmas with my family. One for me, one for my cousin and one for my nephew. All the batteries were dead on arrival and they were a real pain to replace."
3.0,"Cute, great quality, but had to return due to it being too small. Order a side up. It zipped up, but  I had no shoulder room, if I would have hugged someone the back would have split."
3.0,The fit was fine...if I were straight up and down in the back ;) I used them under a dress though for a costume and they worked fine.
3.0,"Not quite the cut I expected, the torso is shorter than what fits right, it is more of a mini dress on me.<br /><br />Honesty is a personal policy of mine as a buyer and a reviewer, it is important to me as a buyer to choose products that I am interested in to help serve myself and my family in a positive way.

I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no compensation for this review and I am not required to give a positive review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way"
3.0,"These are nice, and they fit, but I'm definitely gonna need a garter belt or something to hold them up, cuz I have thigh meat, (not a lot, but decent sized thighs) and they slip down. Maybe they were designed with super skinny girls in mind?"
3.0,"Just a little bit small-- would be nice to fit a few more cards, change in it.  But overall was useful. It scratched pretty easily, but it was functional for travel and was nice to have the RFID blocking feature."
3.0,Rubber snaps easily. Less than 2 months. Worked good before that. Stays on the glasses better than anything else I've tried.
3.0,"My daughters love playing with this mask but right out of the package it has a very strong odor, can only describe as a chemical ""plastic"" smell and it hasn't gone away after weeks of playing with it, I don't know how my kids can breathe in it and I make them hang it up so it can air out. The mane and horn came detached and I had to glue them back on after a few wears. Hope it lasts until Halloween!"
3.0,"The large was just a bit lose when zipped, but acceptable. The zipper does not stay put due to it being a reversible one.  I will need to correct that.  I suggest ordering a nonreversible vest with a standard locking zipper."
3.0,Ok but not for a boy.
3.0,More for a younger person but cute. The magnet glass holds fairly well but it still twist. I do have very slim wrist
3.0,Pants fit fine top is to small
3.0,We had to return it because it was way too big.
3.0,Too much fabric for 32 b
3.0,Much to big of a print for a smaller bathroom.  But quality is good so keeping for some other use such as outdoor shower near pool.
3.0,"The hoodie is very soft and the green color is nice. I am a typical medium in tops and hoodies. I ordered a medium but it was very unflatteringly baggy. A small would also have been loose on me, but in the way that hoodies are supposed to be loose. I would personally size down one size (or two sizes if you want something more fitted).<br /><br />The hood strings were also different from pictured. They were not laces, but were large ribbons that were not what I was looking for (nor what is in the item image). I returned it."
3.0,"The material is NOT cotton-like... it’s more of a thin lycra (slightly see through). If you’re in-between sizes, go up. I am 5’8”/129lbs/34D and I order a medium, and it’s still pretty short. But cute!"
3.0,"i wish this picture could do justice but when i ordered this dress, i thought it was gonna be pastel yellow or at least a lighter color. when i got it, i was surprised to see how bright it was :( At least it fit well though"
3.0,"I ordered a Medium, the band around the chest is tight and the shoulder straps are pressing down on my shoulders.  If I order a Large, the chest area would be too big.  Retuning the item."
3.0,Way too big! Ordered a small 5/6. Got an 11.
3.0,"The fabric pattern is beautiful, the quality is subpar as to be expected for the price pain I suppose.  The fit was all sorts of loose, ordered a small and the waist was great but the whole skirt was too baggy for me. It looks nothing like the picture.  Product returned."
3.0,"Im size 4-6, bought a size M and it was snug but that’s what you want.<br />I could feel a difference when I tried it. My back was less fatigue after sitting for hours. However.... the damn shirt/sleeves would dig into my armpits to the point it was really getting on my nerves and that’s why I returned it.<br />On top of that, there is no way I could wear it in the middle of the summer. So plllleeeaseee make a tank top version of it and I’ll buy it because it seems to really work."
3.0,"This is very pretty, but I've only had it a few months and the clasp keeps sliding off the ring that attaches it to the chain. It's not too difficult to fix, but it's annoying to have to keep fixing it. I can probably fully fix it for longer with players, but I hoped that this flaw would take longer than a month to appear."
3.0,Its so hard to put on and really tight but its cute
3.0,The watch face is too small about the size of a quarter. very hard to read.
3.0,It looks like the photo however wasn't what I expected as far as quality.
3.0,Very small and shoulders and arms. But would work as an open jacket.
3.0,"Very cheap, they held up for what I wanted them for but I would only plan on wearing them once.  Not a long term item."
3.0,Sunglasses are not polarized as stated in the information.
3.0,"A little small, but still very pretty."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this jumpsuit! Fabric was higher quality than expected (not see-through) and the cut was very flattering and great! I wore it to a wedding and got many compliments and was very comfortable and happy. Unfortunately, within the first couple hours of wear a hole developed along a seam and the waist tie fell off (both separately and without any cause). I am so bummed that this fell apart as I really like it!"
3.0,Beads are plastic
3.0,"These are soft, thick, and comfortable but I find them quite tight and I have little feet. Not too tight to wear, but definitely not as comfortable as Gaiam's version"
3.0,Purse was too small but i already knew that because it states the size. But i didnt know that if i add a water bottle and other small stuff it will get filled. So for this reason i am not rating this based on size. Rather QUALITY. I give this 3 stars because the metal design came broken and the middle inside pocket is loose and cheap. Purse looks good though. Sadly i will need to return.
3.0,I had to return the small and exchange for an extra small.  It's okay.  Not the best quality but also not very expensive.
3.0,"Item looks as it does on photos. Small fit , came when promised."
3.0,"The dress fits well. The fabric is a bit strange, but otherwise it’s pretty good"
3.0,"Nice fit, but after a couple of washings, the fabric started to pill."
3.0,The material was not good quality. I returned this item.
3.0,Like the stile...the plastic is very hard !
3.0,Would not order again . Don't care for the look. I love leggings but not these particular ones that have a line that forms around the bottom.
3.0,"Based on the size chart, I ordered a 3X. It was too wide. I would just exchange for a 2X except it was also too short for my taste."
3.0,"It looks exactly like the picture, it's comfortable... but it's not sturdy. I wouldn't wear these to the party as I was planning, Not worth the price either. It's a once in a while-wear kinda shoe."
3.0,I ordered an xs but it fit more like a small. Was also too long. Other than that it would of been a great dress.
3.0,Glasses lased about 2 months until the nose bridge broke.
3.0,"The purse is BEAUTIFUL- I wanted to love it, but the straps are awkward and stiff.  The double handle straps are too short for shoulder carrying and the long strap just looks silly when you attach it.  The purse is very well made but was just too stiff for me for everyday use."
3.0,When I opened it I noticed that it was ripped at one of the seams at the top. I tried it on anyways and really liked the fit and print but it is very cheaply made and I had to return because of the rip. Definitely not worth 20$.
3.0,Top ran very small
3.0,"I hope this helps you make your decision.  The material; its lightweight and good for for warmer weather; however the quality is poor (not a good value). The top looks much better on-line.  The straps at the top are too thin and are not sewn flat.  The length is too short.  Let me explain with the size.  I ordered a 1X.  I usually wear sizes 14-16.  I’m between sizes; XL (which is sometimes too tight) and size 1X, which is usually too big.  Here's my measurements, 42-36-46 and height 5'6"" (180 lbs.).  I wear my clothes slightly looser (rather than tighter).  The fit is looser; however,  the top looks short and wide. What that translates to is that I look shorter, wider, and cheaper (haha).  This might look better if you're short and thin.  I hope this review was helpful, or entertaining"
3.0,"I bought a 2x... it fit like a lady's medium!<br /><br />It looks like it's supposed to be somewhat roomy, but it may as well have been spandex. If you're over size 16, dont bother - and if you're not.... order waay bigger than you normally wear!"
3.0,"I really wanted to like these gloves but unfortunately they are all cloth, so you can't really wear these and drive since there isn't any grip on the palms. I bought a different pair that has grip on the palms that I now use for winter."
3.0,"These fit larger than expected in the waist but still wearable. They are made from a nice cotton and has a buttoned fly. I particularly like the patterns, not too childish but still whimsical and no plaid."
3.0,"I was very excited about these but they just didn't live up to my expectations. The sizing seems correct (a little snug at first but after a few wears, fit better). The strap is either too tight or too loose, and the metal part (if chewed up) really takes some damage. The sole definitely appears more brown than true black, so I was confused by the color scheme in general. They also looked very beaten up very quickly (I mean, kids are supposed to play but I don't expect immediate fraying).  Probably won't stick with this brand and will go back to my old faithful brands. :)"
3.0,"Cute and it matches everything. However, the compression is non-existent. I want to feel like a can of biscuits when I wear compression tops."
3.0,"Good purse, very classy-looking and well-made. But much larger than expected, both in length/width and in depth. It didn't fit in my backpack for school/work, so I returned it. Also, the metal on the front piece corners would get caught on things easily."
3.0,These look amazing but we’re so in godly comfortable the first time i wore them. They ripped my feet to shreds. Now however they have molded to my feet and fit very well. They do get a bit sweaty.
3.0,I gifted this to my mother . And it was alright words were really small and I didn’t like that you can change out the chain if wanted to
3.0,"These retainers are a very simple elegant comfortable solution for people who have glasses always slipping down their noses. But even the Croakies website itself charges two dollars cheaper. Cmon, Amazon...say it ain't so.  :) At Croakies, there is a model that also has an unobtrusive retainer strap built in that I prefer...for hanging them on your neck as well."
3.0,"I was expecting something a little bit different. The bag is OK, I probably wouldn't buy another.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I purchased this bag at a free or discounted price in exchange for an honest review"
3.0,"This dress is a beautiful color and style, but the top of the dress is basically an XXL. I can fit my calf inside the wrist cuff! I need to figure out how much it will be to tailor the top and arms; if it’s too expensive then I will return the dress."
3.0,Giving to Son wedding Day  He dont wear jewelry
3.0,"Very nice, somewhat small as I wear a size 9.5 and ordered a 9-10 and these run small. Not for going out as they look like slippers. I wanted  a slipper shoe."
3.0,Its well made and light.  Only complaint is that its a little tight in the crotch area.
3.0,"Top fit really well but bottoms didn't cover my belly as in seen picture, that might be because I'm 5'7 and I ordered a medium , but otherwise the bottom fit well"
3.0,Like the quality of material but doesn't fit my toes comfortable!
3.0,"It's slim because all of your stuff doesn't fit in it. That said, it's a nice normal wallet. I was looking for some sort of magic wallet that still held all of the stuff and yet was slim... Maybe that doesn't exist, but don't think that's what you're getting here because it's just a smaller, thinner wallet.<br /><br />Nice quality, nice price for a small wallet if you don't have a million cards to carry around. I'd say MAX cards 8."
3.0,"Shirt fit as size chart indicated, while leaning just ever so slightly on the tighter/fitted side of the sizing.<br />it's not my favorite shirt by any means, however, as the fabric is kind of scratchy.<br />it looks nice and I will use it as a backup shirt during winter when I can wear a shirt underneath it, but most of the time I pass on wearing it."
3.0,The large size is too tight a fit for my average-sized hands.  Should have ordered the extra large gloves. One small seam ripped open about a quarter inch; otherwise the gloves have held up so far.
3.0,"I hoped to wear these for running, but they do not stay in place.  They slide down and cause chaffing issues.  Will only use for gym workouts.  Material is soft and not transparent, but I got the gray and it shows sweat really well.  If you plan to use for vigorous exercise and don’t want to look like you peed your pants, go with black.  Love the pockets."
3.0,nice long socks but when you walk the fall down on your leg just have too keep pulling then up just okay socks not the best
3.0,I bought this for my granddaughter thinking it would be so cute. One strap is sewn on backwards. An easy fix but annoying for the price and quality.
3.0,"When I purchased this I thought the arm holes would have been bigger (like in the picture), but they're not. It's really is just a plain, simple tank dress. Also, it smells TERRIBLE! Not sure if it's just the red one I bought, but even after washing it 2 times by itself, it still smells very strongly of chemicals. So much so that I haven't worn it. Otherwise it seems good quality and the fabric is very soft. A nice, simple tank dress!"
3.0,Pretty but entirely too short. The 18” wears like a choker.
3.0,"I gave it three stars because the shirt fits very uncomfortable its a leotard fit the size of the shirt does not match the pants. The pants are very cute fitted and comfortable they’re long as well so if your a tall person like me, I’m 5”9 and they’re long on me. Other than that the shirt is not fitted like shown on the model."
3.0,"I saw that other reviews received the remote, but our was missing, not sure how to receive it without fully returning the shoes."
3.0,"Cute fit but it started pilling on the first wear. I know I won’t be able to wear it much longer because of this. I’ll have to take it to the dry cleaners because I’m convinced that if I place it in the washer, even on delicate, it will make the pilling worse."
3.0,Large is really LARGE
3.0,I like the style and look of the purse. However the  clain links aren't sealed so if you put something too heavy in the bag the chain breaks and you have to reattach it.
3.0,They're cute but they feel cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"It was ok but you definitely have to pin it, in certain places, or it doesn’t stay put."
3.0,Somewhat clunky
3.0,I change my rating now. thought pendant is  beautiful but it is not as shiny as it shown in the pic. and my chain broke immediately.......<br />very disappointed ..
3.0,This really looks like a very nice coat and I really wanted to buy it but it says it come ins a large and x-large but there is no size chart linked or in the images.  Depending on where its made that means it could fit a wide range of sizes from 8-18 and the risk is big that I would be returning it because it was the wrong size.  I am very sad about that as it a just what I was looking for and the price was reasonable.  I will be checking back in hopes they read thins and link a size chart for us to use as I know I am not the only one that will come across this coat and think its a very nice coat!
3.0,The material is sheer and needs to be layered so your bra doesn't show through.
3.0,I can’t tell if I liked it because I could not get the dress to stay buttoned! Size up it’s small and bad material to button.
3.0,It's pretty cheaply made.
3.0,Nice color and length.  Comfy.  Only wish the back fold layed down better.  Kind of bunches up.
3.0,"I bought the Marine blue marl in size small (I’m 5’5 and 145lbs) the fit was PERFECT and super flattering HOWEVER The sweat was super noticeable! I was really disappointed because i thought i finally found a good pair that would hide the sweat, especially because i had read an earlier review that said the marine blue marl was recommended by the company for this specific reason. I’m pretty disappointed. I guess I’ll only wear them for lighter workouts…"
3.0,"The only problem with the dress is the inner lining layer was sewn wrong side out. It wouldn't be noticeable except the white tag shows through the outer black lace layer. I will return it for another one. Also, for me the dress was too large under the arms. It doesn't really bother me since this part doesn't show, especially if wearing the jacket."
3.0,I love this but the top part on the inside of the suitcase was made cheaply. It broke 2 days later.
3.0,"Ordered an XL, And it's WAY too tight. I usually wear depending on the brand a 12. My waist is a 31. I know it says body on but I figured if I bought bigger it would fall nicely over my frame. The material isn't optimal for alterations either."
3.0,"Super cute and warm but after 2 washes, it lost its softness."
3.0,Have to keep hitching them up.
3.0,"It fit a little large, I had to soak it in hot water to shrink it down. The sweat band isn't stitched in as well as I thought I would be. It'll serve it's purpose though."
3.0,"For an extra large top, it is a little tight fit."
3.0,This shirt look like the picture but it definitely doesn’t fix like it definitely go up a size it two.
3.0,"I recieved the product early and was very excited to open it, when I did, I tried it one immediately and realized that it doesn't stay on at all...wouldnt suggest this product..."
3.0,The earnings are cute however the metal is not hyper allergenic as it claims to be.  Irritated my ears and turned them red.
3.0,Shorter an thinner in the horn than I expected.
3.0,Very thin. Not so soft.<br />Eh.
3.0,"Case seems good quality for the price. Unfortunately, they did not fit my sunglasses, so I will be returning them."
3.0,"Cute hat...stitching wasn't the best, but cant complain for the price."
3.0,I like having the basket to carry a few things
3.0,They seem more like slippers then for the snow.
3.0,"Nice band but the clasp is poor and it doesn't matter how nice it is, if it falls off your wrist and gets lost...in the week since I've received it, its  fallen off my hand 3  times..."
3.0,Kids favorite backpack
3.0,"Ok, this dress is so perfect in color but the length is a little on the long side. However I am also only 5’2. But the material is also not my fave. It’s that thin clingy rayon fabric. I was expecting more of a cotton/rayon blend."
3.0,Way to small to be a 3Xl
3.0,"You get what you pay for I guess. They were very pretty, but the diamonds fell out after a couple of wears."
3.0,"Very soft, but the seams are not sewn very well.  Have had them a couple weeks and I’ve had to resew all 4.  The silky material, while soft and breathable, is not easy to sew."
3.0,I bought this shirt for my son! And he likes the shirt! He  was disappointed because he said that the fabric is a little rough. But other than that he does like the shirt! And the shirt does look like the one in the picture!
3.0,It was much smaller than adversitized
3.0,Low visibility while wearing the mask<br />Looks good tho
3.0,"The hat is nice to look at, the color was perfect, it's a little too big for me, if the material was bendable I would have been happy wearing it to the wedding."
3.0,Broke after like two wears
3.0,"Pretty print, but sizing runs on the smaller side. Size 8 is more like a size 6."
3.0,I didn’t realize these are sold as individual plugs. They look good just not what I expected
3.0,Not sure if they were just too big for my feet but they were sliding off my toes.
3.0,If you have thick thighs do not buy.  They are super cute and I am super bumbed.  Was hoping they would fit for something very special next week.  Super super bumbed.
3.0,"Cute and light ,but Too small, order size up"
3.0,"I’ve wear a small and this shirt was too tight, more like a extra small. I wanted it form fitting, which it was, but too tight."
3.0,The breast cups really ruined this bathing suit for me. I ordered the appropriate size and the breast cups were awkward and did not fit. I'm really disappointed.
3.0,"The pouf is weird, outward instead of upward. I like the color and the fit. Still deciding if I'll keep or return because the way the shoulders lay oddly."
3.0,"Fits great, Looks good but don't expect it to dry quickly if it gets soaked.  50% cotton is still a sponge."
3.0,The padded inserts are a headache to fix when in a hurry.
3.0,"I'm 5'6&quot; and 125 lbs, and I purchased a medium. The hips/length were perfect, but the waist was a little big."
3.0,"When I first used this item it was a little tight in the elastic, but as I continued to use, it loosened up.  However, it keeps slipping off my head at night.  Use bobby pins now and it stays on ok.  Not a bad product, but not a great one either."
3.0,Necklace was broken but the charm looked nice
3.0,"I wear a L/XL in tops but this run very small. Especially in the waist. It is not A line, like most halter tops. Very small. Very pretty design."
3.0,"As masks go, it was on the small side and only 2 layers.<br />Luckly, only needed it for days before the election.<br />Did arrive on time."
3.0,"There is nothing wrong with this dress. It’s very casual and cool to wear. On an older woman with “curves” it looks a bit “frumpy”. Ok for casual day. Great for errands out and about town. If your not comfortable with your curves, you may not appreciate the fit."
3.0,"The little rubber bungees that make the mask size ""adjustable"" keep falling off and you can't get them back on without tweezers! In addition, these masks are SUPER thick. Kinda hard to breathe if that's what you're looking for!"
3.0,These were ok. The fabric slips so they don't stay in place on my head.
3.0,SHRINKS
3.0,"It's okay for the price so long as you are willing to put in work as soon as you get it. You'll have to stitch the edges because the inside layer of material does pop out in some spots. I'm not sure if this was unique to me, but all the buttons were not aligned at all. I had to cut off all the buttons and re-sew them back on, because as can be seen by the image, the buttons are supposed to be at an angle, but the ones on my vest were sewn straight from top to bottom. Mine was meant for cosplay related purposes which is why I'm fine with what I received, but I would not recommend this for someone as a piece of clothing that they would actually wear for something outside of the realm of things like cosplay."
3.0,He didn't see much difference in colors. We returned them.
3.0,This dress didn't match my expectations. The outer fabric in the bodice area was looser than the lining fabric so the neckline and shoulder straps didn't lie down smoothly above my breasts and appeared puffy.  Also the lacing at the sides of the waistline are spread too far forward and back.  The loops are visible in the front and the back of the dress rather than on the sides.  I returned the dress.
3.0,Wasn't right for me
3.0,"Dress is nice for the low price. Style is very pretty with nice workmanship and fabric is not as &#34;polyester-y&#34; as expected. I ordered small because I am size 4. Fits great from waist down, however, it is cut small on top so I couldn't zip it up. This would be great for smaller chest, I'm a 34C. Unfortunately I returned it."
3.0,"Had them on for 30 minutes and the back fell off, lost the earring before I realized what had happened.  The earrings were very nice."
3.0,"Very cute, but they run small and my toes get so hot because there air holes in the toe area."
3.0,The look is great but the sizes run almost two sizes too small so be aware of this I had to order mine three separate times. To get the right fit
3.0,"This band is very durable but doesn't stretch much.  It was hard to get over the hand and the elastic doesn't give much, so it fit the same as a M/L"
3.0,"The color was lovely, but the material was very thin and clingy and the size ran small."
3.0,"Hat looks great and is nice and soft.<br />Hat runs a bit small for comfort.<br />Blue tooth range isn't anything impressive, I start losing signal to my phone at about 30ft with an uninterrupted line of sight.<br />Volume also doesn't get very high."
3.0,"no flex in the material, like khaki shorts almost"
3.0,"fabric not as expected, but when the weather changes I will probably wear it"
3.0,"They fit well, but my issue is that the picture is not representative of the color.  They are not white with butterflies.  They are a tinted brownish color and the butterflies aren't well seen."
3.0,"Fits great but it's sheer! Fabric is slinky and if you're not comfortable with people seeing your undergarments... Don't bother. I'll be using mine as a super cute way to cover up my bathing suit this summer, that's about it."
3.0,Wish they were two sided.<br />Nice Verde color.
3.0,"These are comfortable, have lots of room in the pockets and dry quickly, but the snap closure ripped through the fabric the second time I wore them and I couldn't find a way to contact the seller directly"
3.0,"At first I received an empty envelope (had not been sealed).  This was corrected and a new order sent out immediately, received quickly.  However I was shorted filters.  Sent six instead of eight. Still don't know how well they work.  After all this, hope they work well"
3.0,A little to small go 1 size up. Not worth the hassle of shipping back. Recommend buying one size larger than you normally get. Not bad for the money otherwise.
3.0,"I needed a cheap sports watch after the last one I had broke. The last one was a more elaborate Casio, but I found I never used all it's capabilities. I opted for this one because it's feature set is much smaller and it's cheap. So far, so good, but it's the same type of cheap resin strap the the former one had-- in my experience these straps tended to break and had to be replaced every 4 to 6 months. I'm sure this will happen with the new watch as well."
3.0,"There is a lot to like here. The 3 way fly is brilliant and quite rare in briefs. The fabric is nice, mesh integration is a premium. The main issue is the centered pouch / top - you need to slide him up through the center pouch. Always remaining pointing upwards. This could give off the wrong impression… My suggestion, keep the fabric choice, and go with a roomy anatomical pouch design and keep a two way fly is possible. I’d like to see the 3 way version too just without looking too “forward”"
3.0,"Definitely cheap! Don’t know how long the zipper will hold up as we had problems the very first pull, but you get what you pay for"
3.0,Material.
3.0,"Wasn't for me or my foot issues, but can't say it wouldn't work for other problems or feet."
3.0,I love how this dress looks but the lining was a big problem. It needed to be attached to the dress because it kept rising up and twisting.
3.0,"Had an odd feel, and I really disliked the look of it when it came. I guess that's the difficulty with shopping online. I didn't like it personally, but it's not necessarily a terrible product deserving of a one or two star rating. Just had a shoddy feel and look to it."
3.0,Came in quickly. Looks very nice. A bit of ehh imo. Next time I'll probably find somewhere else to purchase from.
3.0,This sweater runs really big. I bought a large just to have a little room. Usually I wear a Medium. I could have gotten a small. Quality isn’t what I would have liked. I kept it because just too much trouble returning items.
3.0,"As usual with sports bras, this runs a little small in size. Not as bad as most though. I only gave three stars because their size chart is not the best to follow. The bra is supportive but I would say medium support. I love it for anything but work, as my nipples poke out too much and it is noticeable under scrubs. But this won’t be a problem for some. It’s not thin. What I like most, besides the wonderful color cyan, is how it fits. It is snug and supportive without being too tight like most. I don’t feel like it’s trying to strangle me. It’s not too hard to get off and on either."
3.0,A little cheaply made but nice.
3.0,Nice glasses - reasonable price - look sharp (reason I am not returning them). They will not help you find your golf ball.
3.0,Design is iron on quality.  Not very soft.i
3.0,"nice workout pants, but no real support and really thin"
3.0,Just a little larger than expected. Had to return it but the quality and feel was nice.
3.0,"I really like it except one major disappointment - it's not all cotton like the description. It's lined with a nylon type black material that I hate. It's thin, but that's what all the pockets are made of and is completely attached to the outer cotton. I hate how it feels on my hands when reaching in, it makes it harder to find items inside (since it's black), and I wonder how long the pockets will last since it's a cheap material. It'd be so much better if lined with cotton...or even not lined at all!"
3.0,Good fit and very light. Not sure I would buy again at this price.
3.0,"The top was just a little bit too small but the bottoms were wayyy too small, but that could be because i am not straight up proportionate"
3.0,"These are nice, but too big. Keeping them for next year, hoping they will fit."
3.0,"While the colors are cute, the material of this top does not allow for bras with lace - every detail shows! It's also a bit transparent. I returned it."
3.0,Quite a few of these came discolored. I am going to have to color them myself and coat the others so the color doesn't come off them. I think this is all I'll be buying of them.
3.0,Size M is short and small.  size large is little bit big.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. The quality is much better than I expected and when I first opened it, I was super excited about it! But it just doesn't fit right. The chest area is just akward. I don't even know how to explain it! All in all, very cute dress- that just doesn't fit right!<br />I am 5'5, 34D, 125 lbs, usually a small or size 4... I tried this in both small and medium. Small was soo tiny I couldn't zip it all the way in back and the medium zipped but had the oddly fitting bust. (So I would say this runs a little small)"
3.0,Sizes 3/4 times smaller then the sizes
3.0,Rusts very easily.
3.0,It fits nice and good length of this necklace! It is for the couple persons
3.0,The arm holes are to tight<br />Had to buy something else last minute<br />This was for my daughter in laws wedding in Mexico and couldn't even wear it
3.0,"This is a great loose fitting maxi, that hits the floor for me at 5’8”. I bought it to wear while pregnant in hopes that it will still be great when not (and it will definitely fit the bill). The reason I’m only giving it 3 stars Is the dress that was sent to me was clearly someone’s return and reeks of cigarette smoke. As soon as I took it out of the bag it was all you could smell. I’m hoping the smell goes away when it’s washed, but it was very off putting and I don’t know how it was able to be repacked and sent with that odor."
3.0,Bought these for my Dad and he loved the idea but he said they were too narrow for his feet.
3.0,We tried two sizes.  The small was too large and the x-small was too tight.  Very nice material and she wanted to like if but ended up with another manufacturer that fit her better.
3.0,They are beautiful and have a nice feel but WAY TOO long!! Might fit a draft horse.
3.0,They flip upside down and move around.They are gorgeous if you don't move.
3.0,Order a size or two larger then normal
3.0,A little flimsy. Mine got caught on something and bent and fell off
3.0,"It's definitely stylish and can hold a lot. I do not recommend this bag if you are looking for a smaller everyday carry bag. Such as you're going to a city for the day, this bag is a little to big for that in my opinion. The strap is also loose on my. I'm 5'11&#34; and about 150. Fairly thin dude and I could not get the strap to stay secured to my body even at it's tightest positioning. If you're a bigger person maybe it'll work for you. Or if you added some velcro attachments it would also work.<br /><br />It's stylish and very well made with many pockets. It's just a little cumbersome for me personally. If you need to carry a lot of stuff, (phone, several batter packs, a few bottles of water, snacks, a small book, a tablet, etc) all at the same time then I'd recommend this bag as it can fit a lot of stuff in it considering its size.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the strap is loose and uncomfortable for thin or smaller framed people. If you're large or muscular, it might be fine. Or if you plan to wear a coat it'd be fine too."
3.0,Great boot but to small for over the calf
3.0,I guess great value for money however it feels cheap hands on. SURE it gets the job done but the spring inside sometimes gets stuck and defeats the purpose of locking both parts into place.
3.0,They look nice. But every time I take my foot out the sole inside comes out every time. Not sure how long they will hold up. Doesn’t feel like good quality
3.0,"Too small, order a size up.  Other than that, great shorts for the money, light material, seems to be fairly well made."
3.0,"Got my watch band this morning, put it on my watch and was very happy with my purchase. The band made my watch more comfortable, and was easy to install. But...later in the evening, I was moving things in my house, the watch got caught on my futon, and the band ripped at the hinge. I don't think it means this is a cheap product, just a freak accident."
3.0,Fits bottom smaller than expected but print looks great!
3.0,The print was off.. and was way to small had to cut it to make it fit.
3.0,Replaced the chain because it was flimsy.
3.0,This dress didn't match my expectations. The outer fabric in the bodice area was looser than the lining fabric so the neckline and shoulder straps didn't lie down smoothly above my breasts and appeared puffy.  Also the lacing at the sides of the waistline are spread too far forward and back.  The loops are visible in the front and the back of the dress rather than on the sides.  I returned the dress.
3.0,They seen to be on the smaller side
3.0,Heavier weight material than expected. crotch is very long and didn't work for me.
3.0,"I bought these shorts several months ago and didnt end up wearing them until today. I have several capri and pant lengths that I love so I didnt bother trying them on. I was SUPER disappointed to put them on and find a hole in the stitching.<br />The fabric is great, not sheer. The fit is great (I normally wear a 12/14 and the Large fits well). But the lack of quality control in finding a hole is such a bummer especially since I'm so far out of the return window.<br />Lesson learned, always try your purchases on when they first arrive."
3.0,"The screen print is not nearly as bright as the picture, it looks faded and not totally opaque. The image itself is correct through. I wish it were a softer material as well."
3.0,"It was too small across the chest. I ordered my size. Otherwise, it looked great."
3.0,Got it for my niece and ordered a size up since she's at a fast growing stage and it still ran small.
3.0,Bigger than I expected. I know she will use them eventually.
3.0,"Has the look of a maternity top, tight on top portion but way to much material around the middle. If I were pregnant I would love it!"
3.0,Ok but not great
3.0,A little on the smaller side
3.0,Faded when washed very disappointed in this
3.0,These are so cute and vibrant. My son loves them! My big complaint though is that they fall out of my son's crocs.
3.0,Cheap material but it works for the price
3.0,"Product is okay but does not look like the image exactly, I purchased this has a gift for my aunt and if I had received it first I prob would have returned it … but it was shipped to her and she loves it for what the saying says. But just so others know it is not exactly like the picture."
3.0,"Very pretty ring!  Though it does not shine like pictured even after cleaning with a jewlrey cloth; it turns your finger green with each wearing of the ring.  The mantra has sharp edges that catch on clothing easily, thus pulling material & bending the facing of ring."
3.0,Color was not what I was expecting. It’s a plain dark brown. Material isn’t the best.
3.0,Fits loose on my daughter which is whom I bought it for.
3.0,It Worked. But definitely cheaply made
3.0,"Very comfortable and look great, my only issue is that they aren't thick enough to not be see through... have to wear with a long shirt but other than that they're great"
3.0,"These are very pretty, but in everyday life they Frey and break pretty easy.  I have bought several different kinds and I they all seem to do it."
3.0,"I measured watch and ordered the watch band to  make sure I got the right one. I thought it would be a simple job to put it on as I've done with many watches in the past, but not so. It was too large. I took it to a watch shop to see if they could put it on the watch, but no luck. they told me the package and stamping on the band said it should fit, but it didn't. We ended up using a dremmel tool to cut it down and shape it to fit the watch. Maybe I should have just returned it, but needed to be able to wear the watch."
3.0,It’s a decent dress for the price. I’ve received many compliments when worn. I wish there was a zipper on the side because it’s a little tricky to get in and out of the dress. The chest was very baggy on me so garment tape was a must. Overall it’s pretty flattering and worth the price
3.0,This is super cute but its kinda large.  I figured it would be like the real chinese carton maybe slightly bigger to fit a phone.  But its way bigger than expected.  I like the fact I can put a bunch of things in it but it pulls focus when its so large.  still like it
3.0,"This item is absolutely beautiful, but not for everyday wear.  I wore mine everyday for a little over a month and stones started falling out.  My husband is a little heartbroken because it was supposed to be an anniversary present I could depend on.  I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Bottoms were good, but tops were very short."
3.0,"I should have bought an extra large because the large fit like a Smedium [:)].  It would have been perfect had it fit.  There is very little stretch to it.  I did not want to be bothered with returning the item so I am going to give it away.  I wish it would have fit because it is really nice and well made.  Also, the brown color is vibrant and beautiful."
3.0,Funny how I paid $40 for this sports bra and there’s legit a price tag on it from Nike for $30. I guess that’s the cost of using Amazon to receive it. Well that and the prime I already pay for as well. Other than that it’s awesome.
3.0,"They are fine as good Polaroid sunglasses, but my problem with them was how large they are. They come with a bag to store them in, which wouldn't give them much protection, and they are too large to fit in any case that I know of, and too large to really fit easily in my purse. I sent them back. Too much trouble to comfortably and safely carry."
3.0,"I got these as a gift. They are beautiful, but the backs are loose and I lost one within a few days of Christmas. I'm still looking for it, and I'm not confident I'll ever find it. If you get these earrings, please put the post on the earring and squeeze the loops of the back around it until they don't slide off easily. I tore the house apart looking for the other one and I'm still upset."
3.0,Cute if it was true to size
3.0,"It is a cute design, but very thin and the inside is white.  You could see the white of the inside from the outside when you put it on and it stretches.  Kind of ruined it for me."
3.0,Much larger than pictured. Still compact but larger than your hand. Pictured with a legal pad for scale. Otherwise works as a nice umbrella. I keep at work in case it rains suddenly.
3.0,"I am 5'4 110 lbs and the small was way too big on me. its a cute sweater, if they made it in an XS, I would have kept it."
3.0,"Great shades. Cheap and actually great quality.<br />My second pair, bought about a year later looks exactly the same but the polarization in the lenses is visible and makes them unwearable. Unfortunate because I loved the first pair."
3.0,"I got small but I guess I should have gotten extra small. The one I have is a little bit big, but it also flares out so it looks nothing like the photo."
3.0,It's beautiful but the shirt is def too big
3.0,"I ordered the navy in small but returned it because one arm hole was slightly bigger than the other. Also, the way the fabric was cut caused the main floral print to be right at the chest, so the effect wasn't as pretty as it appears on the model. (On the model the cluster of flowers is down on the side, which is more flattering). The return was simple and easy, though, so that was nice!"
3.0,"I wanted to love this so much, because of all the other glowing reviews and because of the style! The fabric is curtain-y and smells rubbery, which sadly makes the dress a little too costume-like for me to wear to work. It would make a pretty good theatre costume, though."
3.0,"They went really heart shaped when i got them, but more of just a generic gem stone shape. I lost 2 of the balls to the backs since they are so small and hard to hold on to. But when I did have them, they helped rid me of horrid bumps that typically form in the area."
3.0,"Very nice quality mitten but I think sizes are for small children, ordered a medium for my wife with small hands and they barely went on her hand"
3.0,"For a medium I was surprised how large the top of the dress was.  If you are C or below, this is probably not the dress for you."
3.0,really thick but still see thru it also looks like it was just printed on (number 6)
3.0,"I expected to love these...the two smaller sizes were perfectly gorgeous, but the biggest came with big black smudges almost that will not come out. Like the entire size of the ball on one side is black"
3.0,"Appearance and warmth are great. However, they leave a very bad smell on my hands. So much that I haven’t worn them often."
3.0,This hat is for a small head or a child's head.  I had to give this to my 11 year old niece and it fit her great!
3.0,"Order a couple sizes up, run small. My little girl wears an 8, so I ordered a 9 so she'd wear them awhile. They were to small, toes are at the very tips of the shoes. Should have ordered a 10 just to fit perfectly."
3.0,I haven't actually used the cloth yet because my silver doesn't need it at this time.  I'll use it soon!
3.0,"Good material but not very long at all, it goes to my waist. Long to me is past my waist. Also slides up on me while I work out and that is annoying."
3.0,Much thinner than what I expected but functional.
3.0,A little small but looks exactly like the picture!
3.0,"This dress is pretty, but way too complicated. Cannot put it on by yourself. The straps are incredibly long, to make it convertible, but that leaves u with too much extra fabric to somehow have to tuck in places to hide. Uncomfortable if u choose to wear it under armpits."
3.0,These were cool.The gloves were tight but okay. There was oddly a weird number or logo right in the middle of the face.
3.0,I liked the colors the most.<br />The length is too long. It must be cut and hemed.
3.0,I ordered the Apricot color. It arrived and is a soft yellow. Not the end of the world but I am disappointed.  Also this blouse is very thin. You can see through it. Will have to wear a tan/beige bra to keep it from showing through. I will say it is very pretty. Just not the color in the picture. I wear XL in all my tops. I ordered XL in this. It fits but just barley. I should have ordered up a size for a nice flow around the waist and a little more room in the chest and arm  area.  I am a 40D bra size. If you have a smaller chest this would probably flow nicely. On me it really is just a tad snug for my comfort.
3.0,"This wallet looks very cheap. The color looks orange, not as pictured.  And the finish is shiny.  I do like all the pockets and slots for credit cards etc. But the exterior is not what I had hoped."
3.0,"They are ok not great. Would work with short periods of time wearing them, they hurt my fingers after about 15mins of wearing them."
3.0,These are very small.
3.0,It’s was a good product but it would not tighten because my wrist was to tiny
3.0,I received the wrong kind
3.0,This was suppose to fit ages 11 to 14 and it is about a size 8 way to small so if ordering order two sizes bigger.
3.0,It's cute but it is way bigger than I expected. I went a size up and it's really big and longer than I thought.
3.0,Not what my grandson thought it would be. He thought it was cheaply made! I thanked him for thinking of me and I would keep it because it was a gift from him.
3.0,Materials is very wrinkled. I hace not worn this dress yet
3.0,"Great Item as described, runs small. Had to return them."
3.0,"This is a very cute top. I don't like that it's too wide around the neck, shoulder area and it's wider at the bottom. Other than that, I do like it."
3.0,I've been searching for this skirt online everywhere and have had multiple bad luck experiences trying to get this actual sunflower skirt. I tried this company and was very impressed with the price and shipping. I did find the dress a little on the smaller side. Id says this skirt fits a small to medium size person realistically... if you are over size 10 it might be to snug for the hips and I gave this 3 stars because I find the material quality cheap like a costume from party city but none the less the skirt is very pretty and I plan on wearing it to multiple events. Id buy more skirts from this seller for sure!
3.0,They were a little big for my 5 year old. I would say they were more for a 10-12 year old. They looked super cute though.
3.0,"Beautiful color, love the style however it is not true to size. I bought an 2XL and it fits like a XL. I am a DDD cup and have always bought 2XL dresses from Amazon however in this dress i was uable to move for fear of the dress being ripped. I am returning the dress. Hopefully they will some day have larger size."
3.0,Pretty dress but I don't love the material
3.0,"It's a great ring, came a little smaller in  width than i'd expected but two of the diamonds were missing"
3.0,Fabric was heavier than I expected and the sizing was too big. I ordered both the blue and red one and the red arrived with a small stain on it. I didn't open the packages until sometime later or I would have considered returning them.
3.0,"Cutest leggings ever. Fit perfect for our 21 month old grandkids. An update: got to see these leggings on our granddaughter.  They are still cute and fit great, but the quality is very bad. The material is falling apart. The material is literally shredding apart in the front. I'll have to look for a different maker."
3.0,"Was a bit disappointed, ordered for a gift, the chain had kinks in it. The pendant was very nice. Had to purchase another chain and my gift ended up being mailed to my friend late. I did like the notecard with it."
3.0,Sizes run smaller than normal
3.0,I purchased this wallet because my wife needed a new wallet to go with her purse. The one thing I liked the most on it was how many compartments it has as well as the various colors it came in. The little dove symbol was a cute touch on it. The only issue we had is that we there were quite a few writing on the wallet that went into the design. Here as the little message are great they are just really hard to read. All in all it seems pretty durable.
3.0,Came in very small for what I thought.  Thought these would be big enough for my 4 year olds ears.  Not so much!
3.0,Smaller than expected but a good value if yours fit you!
3.0,"The fabric of this shirt is looser/courser than many dress shirts I own, and this also makes it a heavier weight fabric. I would say that this shirt would be better suited for cooler weather (which makes sense as it is a long sleeve shirt). As far as the quality, it’s mediocre. Fabric is only okay at best, it wrinkles easily, and it’s not a traditional Oxford shirt. The fit is on the slim side – but this is difficult to judge because of the differences in sizing from one manufacturer to the next.  I really wish there was an international (numerical) standard for clothing sizes. Once you know your size, you could buy from any brand and know it would fit perfectly. Unfortunately, this shirt ended up being a little on the small side for me."
3.0,Bought these for the kids to play with on Halloween during a party. They are plastic junk and uncomfortable to wear for more than a minute. I didn't expect good quality at the price so it was as expected. Kids enjoyed them enough so that's all that matters.
3.0,This is a gift for a baby due in July. I ordered 3 months and it's so small! I doubt the baby will be able to wear it more than twice this summer. The design is super cute though!!!
3.0,Buckle sticks out too much.
3.0,"I’m not sure why I ordered a medium, probably the reviews and they were right, in the print above. I’m usually a Large or extra large, but the medium in the print above fits perfectly, not too loose or too tight, the only issue I had was the straps kept falling down so I had to tie a ribbon to affix the dress. But when this dress arrived today, it fit just like I would expect a medium to fit, too tight for me.<br />I ordered a larger size, Hope all will be fine."
3.0,Pretty but on a cheap chain
3.0,I gave the watch to my son because because it was too small I could not wear it.
3.0,"Super cute, fits ok...my son has a huge head. The string in the back to tighten it was broken and just hanging there when I opened the package. But we wouldn't need to use it anyway as it fits him."
3.0,Way too expensive for the quality. Disappointed.
3.0,Love my surgical cap but my face mask was not shipped with this item order. I will be a happy customer once I receive my full order.
3.0,Liked it but I had to wear it at a number of events and it didn’t hold up. Hair was popping out of the braid.
3.0,"My wife doesn't like the style because sleeves are too large, but it does accomplish its purpose.  I wear it only for the cold weather in the morning."
3.0,"very small , and the pattern is not as pretty as on the picture."
3.0,Ring is smaller than I expected. Looks nice but small
3.0,I wanted this shirt so bad Size runs a tad bit small and a little bit short. Image quality is great. The cotton shirt they put it on however is not Great heavy cotton not soft poor smell chemical smell. Unfortunately just pay the $30 for a high quality version it’s the only way!
3.0,Cheaper looking than on line.
3.0,Ok.  But do not fit as well as the previous nose pads.  Had to glue them on for them to stay
3.0,Nice slippers but too large & the fluffy stuff on the inside just gets all over the place I ordered a previous pair sz 9/10 that were too tight so I returned them & ordered this pair sz10/12 hoping they would fit but no such luck I won’t send them back I’ll just give them away & keep looking……. 😀
3.0,"The label inside says 100% polyester,  the advertising states 100% cotton. I'm confused. If polyester, I am suprised at how nice this shirt feels on. It's light but offers a good amount of cozy warmth. The cuffs each have 2 buttons, the front pocket does not have a button or flap. The sewing is a little sloppy. I see some errant threads and crooked stitching. Directions say to cold water wash, which will only make a difference if cotton. It covers my bum completely. I'm 5'4"". I like it enough to wear this Fall and winter. It's cut really cute and is soft enough to feel really comfortable on. The tag made me laugh, there is a little lost in translation."
3.0,"Feel a little flimsy but hey, Sons..."
3.0,Would  be  cute on a woman without any muffin top anywhere.  Thin fabric clings to all surfaces.  Really too bad - very nice design.
3.0,Was cute but broke first time I wore it.
3.0,Not as flattering as I had hoped. Returned.
3.0,"The hat is really cute and fit nicely, but the end of the adjustable strap was a bit frayed and i couldn't tuck it back into the hole in the hat where it's intended to be after adjusting."
3.0,Thought it came with a chain and pearl holder. Actually the pearl was black so I can't really use it as a gift. Pearls are supposed to be pearly I thought so I'm not really happy.
3.0,A little loose/big
3.0,Missing colors in the yin yang design
3.0,This bracelet was way thinner than it looks. It was cute on my wrist along with some other pieces because again it is so thin. It turned colors pretty quickly.
3.0,This product fit as expected but we had an issue with one of the Fasteners that came off in my son's hand
3.0,I love this bag but I wish it was a tad larger.  I had to order the other size but that one is not available in this color.  I kept this one anyway just in case.
3.0,Pretty but cheap material
3.0,Disappointed because I received only 9 individually wrapped masks instead of the 10 that were being advertised
3.0,"the material is cheap,but the print on the shoes are cute!"
3.0,I already have a pair of the same glasses and I'm not sure if they have stretched out over time but these seem very tight on my head and leave marks.  Other than that they are good for a great price.  I paid 280.00 originally.
3.0,The shorts are cute other than the fact that they run too small.
3.0,The slippers are fine.  The comfort fits the price.  If you want super soft and squooshy you need to spend more.  They do the trick for the purpose.
3.0,It's nice just a little small and very rgin band
3.0,The dress was beautiful. But too small in the chest. Would buy again if I could
3.0,Self winding so you have to be very active to appreciate the full ability of this beast.
3.0,still don't know how to tie it
3.0,"Pretty but ultimately useless because it's too thin, like a sheet almost."
3.0,"I wanted to love these, as the waist and rise were perfect, however the length was just way too long even with my highest heels."
3.0,i had a hard time finding tights for my tiny 3 year old and was grateful these came in small sizes but they bag around her ankles. on the plus side they have held up well and don't get runs
3.0,"Got it as a gift, wearer enjoys it"
3.0,mom jeans
3.0,"I was so bummed when I received this.  The reviews were so glowing I thought it was just what I was looking for.  I wanted a purse for international travel with lots of pockets, and it had to have a pocket for a water bottle (harder to find than you might think).  When I received it, I first noticed that the ""fabric"" has sort of a cheap plasticky feel.  Yes, the side pocket would fit a water bottle since it has an elastic top.  However, the pockets in the rest of the purse left me wanting.  There are two large pockets on the outside front, and there are no separators in either of those.  There is one large pocket on the back, and one on the side opposite the water bottle pocket.  On the inside front there are two open-topped pockets (no way of zippering or snapping).  On the back inside, there is a sort of large divider sewn in that makes a pocket (which is open) and on either side of that there are two large zippered pockets.  There are no small pockets to help keep organized.  The bottom is only slightly padded which is a bummer for me since I plan on putting my expensive camera in there, but it will be easily bumped and jostled.  The handle has no padding whatsoever, but is fully adjustable to you can wear it over one shoulder or as a messenger bag.  The handle is not detachable.  Unfortunately, this one will be going back."
3.0,"I gave this three stars based on the fact that the buttons fell off and pocket inside ripped within a week. Poorly made, Looks cute though and I had many compliments."
3.0,Waist is super small. I would have given it 5 stars if there were a little more material to wrap around the waist.
3.0,"I had to buy this for a performance I was participating in.  Suffice it to say, I haven't worn it since.  It's a cute skirt but don't bend or squat down for ANYTHING--unless you are wearing shorts underneath (which I needed to do for the performance).  This warning may not apply if you are really skinny and short (I'm short but not skinny)."
3.0,Love them except Woodstock is quiet a bit larger & looks silly to wear together.
3.0,"It is beautiful, but not adjustable. Couldn't adjust the mesh band."
3.0,"The socks are great! The only down fall is the overwhelming  smell of moth balls. When I opened the box it consumed my whole laundry room, I ended running just the socks in my washer."
3.0,"We bought the GIFTEXPRESS Green Nurse Doctor Role Play Outfit for<br />a gift and when it arrived, the play set was not what is shown in<br />the pictures. The medical instruments were cheap and came missing pieces.<br />We were very disappointed and returned it the next day."
3.0,"Ever buy a shirt that felt so comfortable and nice... until you washed it the first time? Yep. That. The print is great, i love that.. but the shirt was only comfortable brand-new. Now it feels rough, thick, and cheap."
3.0,"It's a bit tight, a bit short... Other than that love these shirts, great to work in"
3.0,"Review is for - Roswear Women's Vintage 1950s Polka Dot A Line Belted Skater Dress<br />Size- L<br />The dress is having a nice pattern and design. however, I am not pleased with its material much..there's this runny and  stretchy kind of material..<br />there's design patterns on neck and on pockets..yes the dress does have functional pockets- two in number..<br />this is okay for a dress of this range.. .<br />i do believe the material can be of much better quality..<br />it does feel a bit large..i went according to their sizing chart..<br />it comes with a belt- white color but can be worn wthout belt as well.."
3.0,It is cute but material is not soft.
3.0,Lo q no me agrado es q tienen una única talla y por lo tanto no es mi size
3.0,The chain pinches your neck and tugs at your baby hair
3.0,Couldn't fit at all
3.0,"The artwork was beautiful, but the masks were different sizes. I bought two copies of the these masks (that's four total), and they were all different sizes. One was huge and practically engulfed my face, another was almost too small (not to sound too much like Goldilocks 😜). Also, the material inside the masks was really loose even with the filter in it, so you breathe the mask in. That said, the material is very soft and the art is wonderful. I am happy enough with them that I'm not returning them, but I'm not so happy with them that I would buy from this company/group again."
3.0,Material not.og best quality but can make do.
3.0,I'm a size 9 and the fit was good.  They are non-skid just walking in them but the small rubber dots on the bottom were sort of bothersome.  I returned them.
3.0,This skirt is tricky. My measurements are 34-31-38.  I originally ordered a medium based on waist size and did not fit the way a pencil skirt shoul look.  It was too loose. It looks better on.  I decided to order a small and it is snug in waist and I can only zip to the top and not hook.  The material does stretch but found it bunches up a little.  There is no stretch in the waist.  I paired with an ivory off the shoulder top and gold pumps.
3.0,"I really liked the picture of this and, maybe I missed the fine print, but this is too masculine for me.  It is well made and attractive ~ just not for me."
3.0,They're are okay.
3.0,Thinner material than I expected.
3.0,Looks like a nice ring. But started to change colors only after 1 week of wear.<br />Very disappointed.
3.0,Didn't care for Style
3.0,I love the Animaniacs but these socks are so thin and way too expensive for the quality. Already cannot wear them anymore.
3.0,"I have worn two pair, and each time the toe had a hole after one wearing.  The socks are comfortable and don’t slip off, but the toes seem to be poorly sewn and rip easily."
3.0,"Not as green and doesn't have any sparkle in it like the picture, but I still like it, thank you."
3.0,"I got this in a small, I believe? And it ran kind of large. The sleeves were very long! It's obviously a cheaper item- you get what you pay for! So it has some inconsistencies as far as the fit around the shoulder area. All in all though, still very cute and I get compliments on it :)"
3.0,"I really like this bra, but the straps are to short and no way to adjust. It needs at least  1 -2 inches added to the straps so it doesn't ride up and dig into shoulders. The rest of the bra is wonderful!!!"
3.0,"The Genhoo Women Long Sleeve Plaid Blazer is smart looking and the perfect thing to wear to the office.<br /><br />But it's too small. My wife wears a medium and this doesn't fit. It won't even button.<br /><br />She would love to wear it, but can't."
3.0,Nice but kinda bigger than I wanted.
3.0,"These were great to use during the polar vortex as they capture your breath and keep your eyes warm.  Unfortunately, the warm breath also made them fog up so one is not able to see.  Don't plan on using in cold climates and you will be fine."
3.0,Not meant for someone who has a long torso. Good quality material and looks like the picture but definitely runs small.
3.0,"Gave this away, wasn't worth mailing"
3.0,Wish the plastic inserts were permently attached to each charm.
3.0,Only turns bye!
3.0,"You get what you pay for, they scratch SUPER easily. I dropped them once and there is a dime sized scratch. Three stars only because the price is so low. Also not as reflective as I would have liked."
3.0,"It works for bugs, but is really small."
3.0,"Super super cute and great find! Runs small, my daughter is usually a 4, and these shirts were almost too small. Definitely size up."
3.0,Im 5'7 125 pounds. Sleeves were too short and too wide
3.0,"This was a gift that I had mailed to a friend, so I never saw the product."
3.0,It's very cute but smaller than I thought it would be and the threading is incredibly short. It was a nightmare getting it in by myself.
3.0,I liked it but had to return it as I don't like showing the big thighs.
3.0,I’m 5’10 and the xxl is so short and way too tight on the arms. It won’t button either. It seems to be kids sizing. So bummed!
3.0,The ring is beautiful but like the other customer said the print on the ring is real small can't see it
3.0,"Just quality seemed not as great as it could have been, my studs kept on falling out n didn't last long cause I had lost all the studs within like a month...."
3.0,"Comfortable, but would not classify as compression grade garment."
3.0,really thin metal
3.0,"I wouldn't actually say these are too big on fit...  they just slide down as you move.  Love the Moonlit Ocean color, but can't wear them to work out in.  Sadly, these will be returned."
3.0,Be aware that these are apparently sized for children. Order accordingly.
3.0,Too small. Sleep over.
3.0,Very thin and see thru this are at home shorts ONLy other then that there high waisted and comfterbale
3.0,I have an average size head and my only complaint is that it tends to want to slide up and if not repositioned  at night will likely come off.  I think making this with a bit more elastic would make these a a perfect choice.
3.0,needs more grippers
3.0,"Because it is so stiff, it sticks straight out from your head and catches in fine hair"
3.0,Look better online
3.0,"I did not really like this item once I received it. It’s like a piece of felt with two holes. It didn’t hang right on me as one side was higher than the other. The collar part did not lay straight no matter how many times I tried to adjust it. It lies beautifully in the picture…but in person not so much. I liked the light gray color but that’s about all I liked. I am appreciative that I received this item at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review, however I am returning it."
3.0,"lost it's plating and hook broke, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Broke after one week use. Sadly disappointed
3.0,"The Daniel Marlin Pelle Men's real leather jeans belt looks nice especially with its antique silver roller buckle. It would complement any pair of jeans or pants very nicely.<br /><br />Clothing manufacturers need to state their item sizes and do that accurately. How else can you tell if an item that you bought on line will actually fit? Unless I missed it, I could not find any sizing information on the Amazon page. The belt that I was sent was small (or perhaps medium.) This is unfortunate and it required me to drop my rating of the Daniel Marlin Pelle Men's real leather jeans belt by a couple of stars"
3.0,"Pretty piece, but I agree with the other reviews, picture is blurry and hard to make out. For the price can't expect perfection, get what cha pay for ;)"
3.0,"A little thin, as stretch as I would like for yoga."
3.0,I'm usual a medium in everything!!!! I had to get a 2XL for it for!!!!
3.0,VERY thin and sequine not attached we’ll especially in thigh area. Good for one wear
3.0,"Like the shirt and will wear it, but it didn't fit the way I thought it would."
3.0,"Nice red color, runs small"
3.0,Serious cute swim suite with two down falls: Possible nip slip because of having only one strap. The mesh material if not properly sown can be itchy and uncomfortable.
3.0,"Mmmm expected more of this article<br />  but to get well<br />and for the price it's worth, it looks nice"
3.0,"While it's very cute, it's not very durable.  I used it to replace my jacket zipper pull and it fell apart within a week."
3.0,"These shoes are super cute and I think they would be comfortable if they fit but they were a little too small on my wide, size 11 feet. I would get a larger size if they had it."
3.0,Had to clear coat …. Mostly NICKEL
3.0,To small plus to short
3.0,Shirt looks exactly like the picture but the fabric it’s made with is very thin. It’s so thin you can see through it
3.0,Fits in the bust akwardly if you have large breasts.
3.0,"The color and quality of these were as expected. However, they are much, much smaller than I expected. An update on their description with an age range would be great. They are too small for the 10 year olds I bought them for."
3.0,My dog is only 12 pounds the tag is way too heavy and it scratches up easily
3.0,"I own several other O&P hats that I am very happy with. But there is something really bothering me about this one and it is the stitched on piece at the front of the bill. One would hope that for the price of this hat and for the small sample sized amount that would be needed, they'd spring for genuine leather in this detail. I would have gladly paid extra. That would have made it the nice touch that I thought it would be.  Alas, it looks like brown vinyl and not the slightest bit like it could be real leather - plus, it's right at eye level, ugh. It's like a nice outfit paired with really cheap shoes. I'd snip it off myself but it appears that unsightly holes would be left in the bill if I did that. I may come up with something else to alter this spot though... as I'm the creative sort. On the plus side, this color combo is very pretty and the faux stone decoration is very opalescent in a good way."
3.0,Totally see-through. You might like that. I'm not sure I do. But I do like the color and will wear these with a very long tunic top.
3.0,"Looks nice, however it doesn't fit right. Im a 32w, so i got a 34&#34; belt. I compared with a 36&#34; belt I have and the holes are in the same spot, so I am still in the &#34;skinniest&#34; hole. I guess I should have gotten a 32&#34;, or asked for measurement to the first hole."
3.0,My daughter love ear hairpiece!
3.0,Pattern is little feathers and was not the look I was expecting.  Buttons are not what I was expecting.  Overall it was more casual than I was looking for.
3.0,Love the idea. Was a cute gift but quality isn't the greatest. Images/writing fades and the chain breaks easily.
3.0,Got an ex large because I normally wear a medium wanted it to be too big for a Halloween party it was almost too small....
3.0,"the dress is cute, just be sure to order a size or two up. The underneath part is rather see-through (I had to wear a slip) and the lace is not stretchy at all, meaning if it's even the slightest bit tight (like mine was), you will hear popping as you walk and sit down due to the small lace strings breaking. It was alright, just be careful with the sizing and what you wear under it"
3.0,"I typically wear a size L in tops and dresses and I ordered this in a size L. It fit well. It was comfortable. But, once I got it on I realized that it just wasn't my style. It seemed a little young for me (I'm early 30s.) The other problem I had with it was the pink color. It wasn't the most flattering with my skin tone. Overall, it wasn't for me, but might work for someone else."
3.0,Looks great but digs into the bridge of the nose a bit. Could only wear it for an hour or so before it got too uncomfortable.
3.0,These things break as soon as you put them on
3.0,It’s good fabric and very soft but too big. I ordered a small. I was excited to receive it but disappointed when I got it.
3.0,"This is a nice jacket, good looking and well made.  The 3 in 1 concept makes it versatile.  However, the problem I have is that the sleeves are not lined with nylon material like most jackets.  Thus, when you insert or remove your arms, the fabric in the sleeves catches on your clothing and the sleeves of your shirt or sweatshirt are stuck half way down.  Accordingly, my choice was to return it or have the tailor sew in a nylon liner for $40 to $50."
3.0,These are pretty cheap and flimsy.  I returned and found something else made of metal.  They're for my 6 year old boy and he's not gentle on his things.  I knew these would break in a matter of the first day.
3.0,"The bracelet is actually pretty nice looking and well made. Great clasp. The size however is really small. I have a ~7 inch wrist and I've worked my way up to the 7.8 inch bracelet and it barely fits. The size seems to be the centerline of a very thick bracelet, so when it curves around your wrist the actual ID is that of a much smaller bracelet. So... 7&#34; arm = 8&#34; bracelet minimum. If it ever gets wet, it's all over."
3.0,They fit okay. The front cut of the pant makes me feel like I am wearing a pad. It's hard to explain but the front isn't a very flattering cut overall. Could be the size I got but it just looks rather weird
3.0,Very cute but very cheap materials
3.0,I ordered this dress in a medium and it fit well with the exception that its not a true maxi. Also the pleats in the picture are not how the dress actually fits. I am planning to keep the dress but would not order in a different color.
3.0,Really cute swim suit.
3.0,"After reading many reviews stating this shirt ran very small i went with the xxl in the black and white checkered shirt. I dont know if the shirt has changed since these other reviews but the shirt i received straight looked like a men's xxl shirt without question. It looks and feels like a men's shirt so im very confused. returning. 5'7, 150lbs, 34DD usually a small or medium in tops.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />I ordered again in a medium and it fits all over much better. It’s def much long than it shows on the model than on me. The front hits mid thigh and the back goes much longer. Def can only wear with leggings and maybe as a dress with a black cami dress underneath. It it way too long to wear as an unbuttoned shirt over a tank. Looked weird. I updated my star rating from 1 to 3 as the sizing is very inconsistent based of the chart and reviews and the shirt is much longer than the model in person."
3.0,Cute but to small for my bust size I guess lol
3.0,"Ordered the 4 pack with grey, green, blue and black and received 4 multi color neck gaitors.  I was looking for plain colors to match with multiple outfits.  Will try to contact customer service to rectify this, otherwise they will be returned.  However comfort of them feels great!"
3.0,I really like them but after only a few wears the ball came off and all of the Chevrons fell off
3.0,The clasps are plastic and difficult to clip on the mask. A lanyard with a metal clasp would be better.
3.0,"Goggles are very dark, have hard time seeing when swimming indoors"
3.0,"The dress is pretty and makes you look slim with its long sleek waistline.  However, it is a very heavy spandex material.  It will be very warm (I have not had the opportunity to wear it yet). It is not a dress for the spring, or even a warm fall day.  It also has 2 pleats, one in the front middle below the waist and a matching one in the back.  No matter what I do, they puff out, which looks terrible.  I am trying to figure out a way to rectify that problem. It MUST be ironed!  It comes quite wrinkled, so you can't get the full effect of the dress without ironing it."
3.0,"The hoodie on this sweatshirt frayed soon as I washed it so I’m thinking about having the hoodie cut off, I was very disappointed in this item"
3.0,I love the green color. It fits and works with my watch but I don’t like how it clasps. It’s a little different then the original watch band and I’m just not used to it yet. I go thru the first loop attach to the notch I want then thru the 2nd loop and it rest against my wrist under the band. It’s fine just wish I would have realized.
3.0,"I gave it a three bc I didn’t expect that type of material, but it’s still a dope ass hoodie so I kept it"
3.0,"still like the item regardless, just a bit janked by it not being exactly what I thought it looked like."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to getting this dress. I love the unusual print. But when I got it, it was just not flattering. It looked like a sack of potatoes on me. Sadly I had to send it back. I'm a 6/8 and curvy. This might be more flattering on a different body type."
3.0,"There are two things important with these - the sizing and the feel.<br />Although they have no cotton in them, they have the microfiber-cottony feel and they do breathe. If this is what you are looking for then these could be a good choice.<br />I was looking for something more stretchy-satiny-silky myself.<br />The sizing runs a bit large - consider buying one size smaller because they do stretch.<br />I like the wide variety of color choices - unusual these days."
3.0,"They were lovely as in looks but even though my ears were 4G they weren’t accurately 4G they felt small but I was like no biggy, the only lasted 24hrs before slipping out my ear and breaking so since I had no back ups I had to size up to 3G way too early and I’m sure we all know the stinging pain of that . And I do wish they would have been a bit heavier , maybe they should come with a “O rings”"
3.0,Love these as they are economical and the quality is similar to Apple but the difference between small and medium is huge! Small is too snug and Medium is way too big. If you are lucky enough to have the right size wrist you are in luck cause these are soft as Apple’s exclusive $50 loop bands. Compare size differences with my original white band from Apple.com in size 6 with this Pink band in photo is size M and black one is this one in size small. Huge disparity between small and medium.
3.0,"Nice thick quality material, but the fit was not that good. Too wide in the midsection area, looks better in the picture."
3.0,An Xtra large top is usually loose on me but not as loose as the model's look. I got an Xtra large but it fit tight as if I ordered a Large. So if you want the model's look order 2 sizes up.
3.0,These did not do justice to overalls.  They are very big fitting and thin flimsy material.  The color is very washed out.  Not happy with this it was returned same day I received it.  The price for these were high but the quality of the product was low.
3.0,This dress is really cute but I am returning it because of the deep v in the back. I dont like that it shows my bra and i really wish the pictures would have shown this.
3.0,I LOVE THE LOOK AND THE WEIGHT.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT I WORE IT TODAY WITH JEANS AND A WHITE SHIRT.  BY THE END OF THE DAY THE OUTFIT I HAD UNDERNEATH HAD A MILLION SMALL BALLS.  IT IS FIZZ OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  IT IS REALLY BAD.
3.0,"Got this for my nephew.  He loved it.  My sister washed it and reported that it got lint **everywhere**  She re-washed it and still had a lint issue.  Other than that, my nephew seems to love it"
3.0,These are huge and constantly slip down my nose.  They are very lightweight and comfortable (other than the slipping).  Nicely made.  Just too big.
3.0,"I wear 10 1/2 women's shoe and needed a very lightweight shower shoe that would dry quickly and not soak up water. Nothing in the women's dept matched so I tried these. I ordered a 9 which I wear in men's shoes but the fit is slightly longer and wider than a 9 - are 11 inches long and weigh 6.1 oz.  Since they are very lightweight and don't soak up water which is great for travel, I am not returning. You also need to de-gas them outside a few days when you remove from the bag."
3.0,"Update: I‘Ve had these for about two weeks now and I’ve worn them about 5 times, washed once. The right pocket seams have already come undone and so I now have two holes in the right pocket. Easy to fix, but quality control on sewing should be better. These weren’t the CHEAPEST pants, either. Still, they are comfy and warm, but I have to drop my previous 5-star rating to a 3-star rating. (See my other reviews on this brand of pants. The yoga pant sizing is really off compared to these. Really starting to question any future purchases of these Made in China pants.)<br /><br />Bought these after I bought another pair of Baleaf thermal fleece joggers. These were a little less expensive, but didn't have zippered pockets or the adjustable ankle cinch (which I didn’t like anyway).<br /><br />The pockets are nice and deep in these. Fleece is warm and soft. I have not yet washed this one, so I will update if needed after the washing.<br /><br />I am 5’2”, 120 lbs, usually wear US size 2-4, about 27-28 waist (depending on brand). Size Small fit me well!"
3.0,one of the necklaces came detached... had to reattach on another link.
3.0,They’re definitely not as big as the photo. Maybe half the size. They’re also really difficult to put in. The hook is awkward. Had to return.
3.0,"They work for the part of being a tie, but they are not nice."
3.0,Smaller that expected
3.0,"I wear this every day at work - out in the heat, in sandy areas, in salt water, in fresh water, and in the pool. It is still in great condition! If you are sweaty the band gets a bit uncomfortable. The light works fine at night and it is easy to use the stopwatch function.<br /><br />Edit: 3 days after I posted this review, the watch started filling with water! Within a week it stopped working completely. If you need to wear a watch in the water for hours every day, just remember that this one says water resistant, not waterproof. :("
3.0,the ring fit prefect and looks good.
3.0,"These are very small and would be great for a baby or toddler. I however, got them for an adult so they won’t work."
3.0,Stretches so much.
3.0,"Unfortunately I am returning the bag. It's actually very nice, seems well made. The color is a nice cherry red, and seems like real leather. It does come with a longer handle, and a nice insert bag that zips closed.  I'm returning because the snap won't stay closed, and I can't stand to have my purse wide open all the time."
3.0,"It's a bit cheaply made but does the job.  Wood is not finished that well, Inserts for adjusting rods are a bit crooked but it works and that is the main thing."
3.0,"Received the items in a more than timely manner. I thought that they would be a little tighter . However they were really not that tight. I usually wear a XL, however I had to send them back and get a Large so tha they would fit in a comfortable fashion. I use them for Yoga and as you move around they keep sliding and I have to constantly readjust. I would suggest that if you have a athletic body and want a tight fit to go at least 2 sizes down from you normal size so that everything is kept in check. Other than that they are worth the money."
3.0,Too big for little girls
3.0,sleeve r a bit bigger than what I expected
3.0,The arms are so short - I always have to get large because I have extremely long arms as I am 5'10. I gave this to my friend who is 5'3 and the arms were still short on her. Other than that it's a cute design just kind of cheap.
3.0,"Nothing wring with this bag but I will be sending it back, I need a bag that can hold my computer along with folders."
3.0,Way too large for a one year old
3.0,There is an ugly gold frame across the top of the rims which is very difficult to see in the photos (zoom in and look closely). The glasses are nice but I felt like the photos were misleading because there appears to be no gold frame at all. Fortunely I was able to remove the gold frame fairly easily with an eyeglass repair kit without it being noticeable.
3.0,Way too tight. Had to return
3.0,HERE it states the shirt is 95 % Cotton !!  I EXPECT 95 % COTTON !!  I purchased the wine red one.  Label states 60% Rayon  35% Polyester<br />5 % Spandex !!! I HATE SYNTHETIC CLOTHING !!!!
3.0,Thin and cheap feeling
3.0,"Nice if layered under a vest or sweater, but It is a little too flimsy in my opinion to wear alone. Fit well and nice colors!"
3.0,cheaply made. but good for the price
3.0,Much smaller than anticipated. Had to buy a smaller billfold!
3.0,"The ring looks amazing and none of the stones have fallen out, almost 3 weeks so far. It is'nt huge it's easy to see though. She has never told me it hurts, or that it is too wide. Everything about the ring is perfect except that it says ""Titanium"" on the inside which would be a big downer if I told her it was more expensive that it is."
3.0,"Not at all close to what was pictured--pink, not lavender. Pearls are neither flat nor round, as described, and not disc, but round and flat on top, looking like lidded bowls. Clasp looks nice and is substantial but the parts are very slippery and it's uncertain whether you've actually succeeded in closing it."
3.0,In my opinion this runs a little small and the top is weird.  Material is good and the overall dress is cute.... missed my window to return it so I will be gifting it to someone it might fit better.
3.0,The fabric is extremely thin and I can't wear underwear. I am 5'7 140 lbs 36c. I will need to do some alterations side straps too long and wide.
3.0,"Cute,but shirt is small"
3.0,IT FIT TIGHTER THAN EXPECTED.
3.0,"In fairness, the glasses are as they appear in the pictures.  I didn't like the blind spot they created and they started to hurt the bridge of my nose."
3.0,"The dress is cute but the undershirt is extremely short, as in the Large was too short for my 9 year old."
3.0,These are not for cold weather
3.0,"XL is too small; it is more like size 14, not 16-18. Overall pockets and rest of design is ok.  Vest is shorter than I would have liked. Am taking a trip very soon, so couldn't get another one."
3.0,Kinda digs around the elastic band and armpit area but probably because it's a tad small on me. Other than I like the overall design and material.
3.0,For $10 it's what I paid for.
3.0,Shirt needs to be a little longer.
3.0,I bought  this as a gift. Initially she loved it but then decided that having one large open pocket was not practical and stopped using it after only a couple of weeks.
3.0,"Almost - don't think for a moment that you can wear this without a bra or top because when stretched above the bust area, it turns sheer. Otherwise this is comfortable and washes well. I've worn and washed it a few times - holds up without issue but the sheerness when stretched limits full usefulness."
3.0,Not really that water resistant. Water is in the face after just a few hand washes...I'm a can so constantly washing...still working but foggy face.
3.0,Not thick enough or high enough for me.  Maybe a bargain for someone else.
3.0,They were too small. But overall absolutely fabulous!
3.0,"I purchased this for my three year old daughter and the shorts fit, but were a slouchy/larger fit. The top fitted perfectly but the outfit is definitely cheaply made, but it was okay."
3.0,Love the patterns (bought the cream one and the black one) but the fit is just weird. Very boxy looking when it’s on. Thinner material so the cream one is almost see through.  Unsure if I will keep or send back.
3.0,"I wanted &#34;hybrid&#34; gloves for my kids and these are the best I could find. I was kind of excited to have my kids try them out after our first snow in November 2014.  A lot of people commented on the sizes and it is confusing but after contacting the seller for advice, I ordered 2 sets of size &#34;Medium/Large&#34; and they fit my kids (ages 9 and 11) just right .<br /><br />PROS: They are good quality and keep the hands warm. These would probably be good for skiing or just walking around outside, riding in the car or to and from school BUT<br /><br />CONS:  they are NOT good for snow play (like throwing snowballs, sledding or building snowmen) because the &#34;mitten flap&#34; flips open way too easily at the wrong moment, exposing the fingers and allowing snow to get in.  There is Velcro to keep the flap open but not to keep it closed. Too bad because otherwise I like these gloves, but my kids will not wear them for playing in the snow."
3.0,Love the color can't wait to wear it - tried it on and fits ok. Bottoms fits well top is shaped a bit awkward so the support is not well. But overall pretty pattern.
3.0,"These feel pretty cheaply made and rigid.  They are VERY light and thin materials were used.  I wouldn't mind having these as back up or  yard work pair I guess, but wouldn't make them my primary glasses"
3.0,Very comfy and fit well just after 1 wash tho the back is starting to fade and I washed inside out....
3.0,"it's alright, I suggest getting a big bigger size"
3.0,"Was ok for a few runs. Size was a little tight from top to bottom on the torso but that's fine, hands were fine except between the thumb and pointer finger where it is designed poorly and comes out as webbing. For the price I can deal with all of that what ended up making me lose stars is that after using it a few times the zipper broke and it wasn't tight on the sides so I was a little baffled by this. I'm sure if I cared more I could probably just put it back on no big deal, but for the price I don't want to deal with it."
3.0,"A very comfortable shoe........BUT your foot slides out and the back of shoe irritates the back of your foot, the ridged lip should have been even and not raised up. all in all it is a cute slide just wish you could tighten the strap so your foot will not slide out while walking."
3.0,It was a cool shirt!!! But it’s a weird fabric and I didn’t like the feel of it.
3.0,These shirts are made of material that clings and hugs the body.  I tried working out in the shirts but they tend to rise up when moving around.  They are not good for working out but they are okay if you need a layer under your regular clothes to keep warm.
3.0,"This shirt is probably good if you're wanting a flowy thin shirt. The shirt did not flatter my body shape so I did return it. However, the fabric seemed fine and the print was pretty."
3.0,I'd give it 5 stars except they didn't send me the one in the picture which was a snake design. Instead they sent me a leopard print which is OK but not what I wanted. I still love these and have a bunch of them.
3.0,Probably not the most accurate when comparing to other trackers
3.0,"Material is cheap and no compression. Could be a little more tighter, but since the material is cheap, it might rip."
3.0,"The masks are small for an average adult. It smashed my face, made it hard to breathe. My husband has a beard and it was a no go. It would not stay on his ears. Very cute but need to be bigger or adjustable."
3.0,"The socks are OK. No idea why they chose to emblazon them with a pentagram, but it's pretty weird."
3.0,"These are lovely, however, they pinch my ears so much that I am unable to wear them.  Wish I knew how to loosen that omega clip without damaging it."
3.0,Blouse too small  and I am still waiting to hear from seller
3.0,Gave it to my niece who is shaped like a model
3.0,Shirt to tied and short the bottom part great
3.0,it is just ok!
3.0,Just doesn’t fit right<br />Will not buy again
3.0,I really wanted to love this because it's well made but the straps over the shoulders were way too tight!  And they are not adjustable in any way.  Also the rest of the dress was a smidge too big in the chest.  Cute dress but needs some work.  Returning.
3.0,"I like tight fitting clothing so I got the smallest size. I couldn't believe how big it was hahahaha. It was so baggy on me. Granted I am 110 lbs but for real, At least they gave me my money back :-) good company."
3.0,All very short for the size !
3.0,"Love the dress, it is see through so you will need to wear a slip or add lining underneath. Overall great dress, got lots of compliments on the color and look."
3.0,"Not nearly as elegant or cute as the pictures and listing made it seem because of the drawstring waist. It looks more like a jogging suit honestly. Fabric is nice but that's about it. Cut is weird on the upper body. I'm hoping it'll grow on me and I'll find the right place to wear it, but for now it's not nearly as versatile or dressy as I was expecting it to be."
3.0,I would have liked this dress so much more if I knew how long it would be. It hit me at my calves. I liked the thickness of the material and it fit well in the upper body and waist. Just not for petite women like me. I am 5'3&#34; for reference and bought a medium.
3.0,I ended up returning this but i wish it would have had a higher back. The back didnt look as low in the images and when i tried it on you could see my bra strap in the back so it just wasn't as modest as i thought it was. But overall good quality and great color!
3.0,This bracelet is adorable but it's way too small.  It's designed for a child.
3.0,"The fit is off. The waist band is way above the natural waist. Overall, it is not as flattering as I hoped it would be."
3.0,This dress is very pretty but it runs small and it is see through.
3.0,"Looking wise cute but the material is cheap quality and once the dirt gets on the purse, it doesn't come off.<br />Watch out for the stain!"
3.0,They are nice glasses but just wayy to big for my face. I'll be sending them back. They are very cute though. Hoping to find something a tad smaller exact look just smaller.
3.0,It's not too bad
3.0,"LOVE this shirt (light FRIENDS tye-dye) because it just screams 90s, but it's cropped super short. Like, shorter than expected from the other reviewers pics posted. Even if I didn't have a pudgy tummy & was supermodel skinny there's no way I'd wear this outta the house! It comes like 3 inches above my belly button. I wear a medium & got a large for fear of it being too small. The hood is decent size but if I had of gotten a medium I think I wouldn't have been able to put it over my head. The material is decent also. not too thin but not thick enough to wear on it's own in winter. Guess I'll just wear it as a lounge around the house shirt (as long as I know company isn't coming over, omg! So yeah, I took off 2 stars for it being cropped much shorter than it appeared, maybe I have a long torso or something and just never realized it? But yeah, super CUTE and perfect for those who don't mind their entire stomach showing. But I don't feel that it was worth the price. I'm just too lazy to bother with the hassle of sending it back. Who knows, maybe one day my tummy will be flat as it was back in highschool & I'll be able to rock it out in public like it was the 90s all over again!"
3.0,El diseño es muy cuadrado y no luce
3.0,I got a size way to big on me but if I got the right size I’m pretty sure it would’ve been amazing
3.0,Not easily adjusted.
3.0,"The dress design was nice enough, just the Deep V went down to my belly and the pocket flaps on the front made it weird."
3.0,The material was nice but I ordered a large and I couldn’t even pull them up. I gave them to my daughter
3.0,"Material is a  nice quality and the color is perfect.  The sleeves on this top are HUGE! I’m pretty chesty and I typically wear an XL in shirts and between a medium and Large on bottom. Since this comes as a set I wanted to make sure the top was the right size, so I order the XL.  Surprisingly the shorts fit well (a little long but I’m only 5”) and the top is great in the length and through the chest. The sleeves are massive. Entirely way too wide and way too long. The set is fine for lounging but I would not run an errand in this set bc the sleeves constantly fall down."
3.0,"These are beautiful and I'm excited to get to wear them. BUT I ordered 00 and they are absolutely 7/16"". So I cannot wear them unless I stretch my lobes. So that's pretty lame."
3.0,Fit was true to size and straps are fully adjustable. With that being said it fits just like the picture so fitted to the knees. It looked fantastic on as long as I didn’t move much. (Size up if you have thick thighs and actually intend to walk) Once I had it on I realized that I wouldn’t be able to go to the bathroom without practically taking the whole thing off so it wasn’t practical for the party I had bought it for also I’m pretty sure stairs are a no go as well as any dancing. I decided to keep it even though it doesn’t work for a long night out but it would be good for a couple of hours out of mostly sitting or standing.
3.0,The Time isn’t corrected
3.0,"Hard to wash and have the smell gone, could not keep them after several wears"
3.0,"The print for Paradise (Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Eathly Delights) is blurry and pixelated up close, like a badly compressed JPEG file. It looks okay and somewhat recognizable far away, though. The size and fit is fine; I normally wear a small in other similar dresses. I'm 5'4&#34;, and the bottom of the dress grazes the top of my knees. I was concerned that the arm holes would be tight, but they were comfortable. Pretty much what I expected for the price."
3.0,"I wanted to like this shirt but it is a miss. The color is nice and so was the price. I am 5’2”, 125-130 lbs and it is short in the torso on me and it’s a size medium. If I bend or reach for anything, there’s too much skin showing. It fits width wise and sleeve length but torso wise, it’s awkwardly short. Also, the manufacturer’s tag in the neckline was cut out (you can see the remnants of it) so it was either used or resold from another company by this seller. I could have gotten past that if it fit better. Sadly, it’s getting returned."
3.0,"These are ok, not the best quality, not soft, color faded after first wash. overall I wouldn’t recommend them but my 3 yr old daughter loves them but I don’t let her wear them out because even after the first wash they looked old and dingy."
3.0,"Bright red, not a cranberry color."
3.0,It's comfortable but tends to roll up from the bottom.
3.0,Love the ring buuut the wooden inner came off when in1st put it on..its wasn't glued well.. and it is brittle so I tossed it.. I just wear the ring on a different finger than I anticipated.
3.0,Cute glasses but the edges are sharp you will get scratches in your face
3.0,"This belt is just okay. It's not the most expensive looking belt, but I needed a cream one and was having trouble finding one. After putting it on with a cream suit, it looked more white than cream. If you're a bigger person, it may not fit."
3.0,"I would have given 5 stars but I ordered a 20 mm band based on my Citizen Watch, but you can see the pins on either side. It doesn't fit like it should . You shouldn't be able to see any of the pins that hold the strap to the watch. Looks cheap, but its under 20 bucks sooo. Oh and its not full leather. Its leather on top of plastic. Again under 20 bucks."
3.0,"the slipper is really nice and I would have given it 5 stars, but the sizing is off.  The product says size 5-9.  Well, my foot is a size 8 to 8.5 and is very tight.  I will not send these back because:<br />1)Would have to go back to the UK which is expensive<br />2)I could always give them as a gift to someone else.<br /><br />If you have a foot that is 8 to a 9 (female), then I would not recommend these for you."
3.0,glasses are a lot bigger than i expected. more for a mans head.
3.0,Item fit as expected. Although it took over a month to receive it.
3.0,They are too hard. Not soft enough .
3.0,"It fit true-to-size and looked great when I first got it, but after one wash (cold, delicate cycle, low heat dryer), it shrunk to an unwearable size. I’m really disappointed because I loved it before."
3.0,Mine didn't come with the nozzle cap.
3.0,It was a beauty piece of jewelry. Smaller then I thought.
3.0,"Not as expected, very cheap looking"
3.0,"thin and cheap looking, very cute tho, but I knew this going in I just needed and accent piece, I wish the clasp was more sturdy but previous reviews stated that and I still bought so.."
3.0,"The top is pretty cute, fits a little odd so it feels weird on but it looks good. The shorts, however, are bad.. Super weird length and a very long crotch, I'd have to roll the hem 6 times to make them look like normal shorts."
3.0,"The shirt was definitely small. I ordered a 3X because I'm a plus-sized woman and the sleeves were incredibly tight. Thankfully, there was enough stretch that I could wear it, but it was not comfortable. Also, for some reason, when I opened it, it smelled like stinkbugs. I washed it and the smell lingered. Disappointing."
3.0,"The seller answers “large will fit women”  I ordered based on this comment.  The large barely fit me and I wear a small hat, baseball caps are usually large on me, even when adjusted.  XL would be an appropriate size for an adult.  Nice hats, well made, but small for adult use."
3.0,"I ordered two and then return them, tag said dry clean only and while I liked the way they looked, I do not have time to visit a dry cleaner whenever I want to wear the dress. It said Machine washable in description"
3.0,"These work just fine but the texture is weird and the ones with prints on them, the prints have peeled off and no longer look good."
3.0,"I really loved this dress and really wanted it to work. I am 5'4&#34; and 120 pounds....this dress made my hips look HUGE! My sister even asked if I had gained weight when I wore this in front of her. I don't typically have issues with dresses and how they fit, and I really wanted to be in love with this dress because it is so my style, but the way the pleats and fabric lay, just made my body look twice it's size."
3.0,"Colors given were rather unusable in general, but the quality was good."
3.0,"They must’ve used numerous scrap pieces of the material to put this one together, nothing like the one pictured.<br />Grandson liked it, but if it was for me would’ve sent it back."
3.0,Its nice i like it. I was just expecting more durability
3.0,Very cheaply made.  Light weight and comfortable.  Runs small.
3.0,"The dress is BEAUTIFUL, but if you're over a size 8/10 there's no way it'll fit. Also, some of the seams are terribly done."
3.0,"The cap was a a bit larger than I would like even in a snapback, otherwise im happy with the print and materials"
3.0,I purchased this dress for a church event not realizing that it is more like thin t-shirt material.  It is still a nice dress and I will be keeping it to wear for the summer.  It is stretchy and comfortable and a good length.  I bought the purple and the color is true to the picture on the website.
3.0,Nice shirt but not &#34;loose fitting&#34;
3.0,"Love the design and color,but narrow,good as a neck scarf.."
3.0,Christmas gift will not know about fit.  Fabric thin.
3.0,"Read the sizing and order accordingly, but they did fit as expected to their size charts.  No the greatest quality, but worth it for the price."
3.0,"No back light like thepicture shows... Feels cheap, but it does keep time well enough."
3.0,"Very pretty, but the chain broke after the first 5 minutes of use.  All she had done was take a picture with it and the only things she put in it was 2 things of lipstick.  My husband was able to fix with some pliers, but it was quite frustrating."
3.0,"I'm 5'1 and I had to have it tailored, hemmed and pockets removed.  This dress was designed for a tall woman. Very soft and very comfortable.  It was a bit roomy but I like that."
3.0,"Was hoping for plain wood ear plugs. The coating, on the black pair especially, makes my ears itch and flake."
3.0,Really nice quality but to small for me
3.0,"Buy a Sharpie and write on them ... but know they aren't covered in plastic of any sort, so I wonder how the words will hold up in wet weather? We'll see!"
3.0,It is very thing fabric and the sizing is right on. Order your normal size. I ordered the polka dot dress.
3.0,"Thought It was going to be a bit more sleek and fitted but its kind of frumpy , do not care for belt..<br />On the positive it is a very cozy cardigan."
3.0,"The top is beautiful. It arrived sooner than expected. Fit was just right, But I itched badly couldn’t wait to pull it off."
3.0,it is very pretty but the back is open. If you do not have a problem with that then this is the Romper for you!
3.0,Difficult to fasten. Cute. Large. Light weight!!! Not dangly enough though. I have purchased hook earings to make them longer and easier to use. (I also want to hang them while not in use. The hooks will make them easier to grab and wear and easier to see for quick matching.)
3.0,"Bought the dress in yellow and absolutely loved it, super cute and flirty for the summer. Unfortunately had to return it. The dress is super short in the back (junk in the trunk :) )"
3.0,"I am 5'7"" have a thin frame but wear a 38D cup. After reading the other reviews I played it safe and ordered an XL.  Unfortunately that  is still too tight for me so I recommend sizing up on this product.  Other than that the tank is made of a nice, soft, polyester material.  Just wish it would have fit me."
3.0,Back keeps coming off
3.0,"Beautiful mask, broke first time my student put it on for our play. The dealer did refund it. I wish it had been better made."
3.0,Good product.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the front is way shorter and back is way longer than shown. Front barely comes to waist and back is about 2 inches past the bum. Sleeves are tight.
3.0,Very nice fascinator but it didn't look exactly like the model pic.
3.0,The color in the picture looks way brighter.  When it came it was more of a pale blue.  It runs a tad bit large.
3.0,Would of rather paid $7. It's cheap material & it's not white. I'm thinking of sending it back.
3.0,"I use these everyday on my prescription eyeglasses that kept falling off my face whenever I bent down.  These will keep your glasses on your face and you wont constantly be pushing your glasses up all day long.<br /><br />However, they will tend so slide off too.  After a day or two, the rubber will  get oil and dirt in them and then they slide off very easily, sometimes falling off completely.<br /><br />You will need to go to a sink and use dish soap to clean your glasses and the INSIDE of the rubber with a Q tip to get them to stay on again.  Very tedious.  You can also glue them on with RTV or other adhesive that wont damage rubber or plastic.<br /><br />They dont look cool at ALL, and people usually think I have hearing aids, but there is nothing I could find that was better at keeping my glasses on my face."
3.0,Very light and does not look like the product described. Looks really cheap for the price paid
3.0,Love the ring but it turned my daughters finger green after three days.  Not happy.
3.0,The bottom fit as expected but the top was very flimsy and seemed like it was larger than the bottom.
3.0,It is a pretty dress but it fits poorly. I love the fabric
3.0,They broke very easily. I loved the look of the earrings but they broke every time I wore them.
3.0,It’s nice but is not equipped for 15 inch Mac book... hard to close with anything else
3.0,"Wanted to love this band. I wash my hands a lot and I started smelling something like a wet cat or feet. I was like naw hell it ain't me, it was the band. I had to wash it about 4 times to get rid of the smell then that took away some of the color. I fits great just hated the smell."
3.0,"Nice looking, but too small for a men's bracelet!"
3.0,"The front pockets are way too long. They go like halfway down the thigh and they of course are noticeable because they are leggings after all. This is why they don’t usually put front pockets on leggings and jeggings... I’m also not a fan of the cut bottoms. I didn’t realize it came looking like that. Obviously you can cut any leggings that are too long but realistically they make way more short ppl leggings than tall ppl leggings soooo short people can just buy leggings in a normal inseam, whereas tall people are the ones who go looking for longer inseams so these should just be long leggings for long legged ppl that come wearable (hemmed) for US."
3.0,fue complicado ponermelo
3.0,Pretty but they are very sharp. I've already poked at least 2 people on the cheek when I hugged them. One person even bled a little! Just be careful when you hug someone!
3.0,"The bridge is also slimmer than advertised, a throw-away pair overall."
3.0,"This dress is so pretty, but it has an awkward fit to it. It also is a very weird fabric. Not really what I was expecting. Its super cute, but the ruffle hits at a VERY weird spot on me. Still wearable, just a little awkward."
3.0,"The top fitted perfectly, the material was very soft and the color was fresh."
3.0,They are tight on my toes and slipped off while doing yoga.  I took them off before finishing the class.  I will try them again at barre class.  I wear a size 11 shoe.  I ordered the large size of the sock.
3.0,"I am 5'8, about 150 lbs and I ordered a Large. It fits however it is a little tight around the waist. Overall very nice pants, however the clasp above the zipper was broken off."
3.0,Good quality for the price. Light weight and smooth soft material. Doesnt seem to be very warm but is fine for matching dresses. Buttons are bit low quality.
3.0,"Jumpsuit material is stiff and this does run on the small side. If you want it to fit like the picture, SIZE UP! Bottom is baggy, I feel like the middle seem hits in a weird place."
3.0,"While the wallet seems well made and good looking, I'm disappointed in how small it is. After putting my passport, a few credit/ID cards and some paper money, it just about closes.  There is a place for a pen and a ring for ????, but there is no way it will close if those are added.  Also, I wish it was large enough to keep plane tickets, hotel confirmation, etc. along with passport."
3.0,I like the shape of the bag but don't really like drawstrings but I knew that when I ordered it though. I hoped this one would change my mind but didn't. Also came with a long strap that didn't fit the bag.
3.0,"It's a little shorter than I wanted in the front, almost a crop. The back detail is very nice. Good quality and very comfortable"
3.0,it was cute but the diamond should have been a zirconia it looks plastic
3.0,"this bag was nice but the straps were very thin I knew it wouldn't last long because I put a lot in my bag and it lasted 2 weeks then the straps broke, good for carrying an almost empty bag"
3.0,I really love this necklace. It's beautiful and reasonably priced. The only problem is the black bead broke out in a matter of weeks.
3.0,I bought this for a family member as a gift. The band is a little too tight around the middle. I will have to return it.
3.0,"Too light weight, color not as brilliant as pictured."
3.0,"I’m sure this is probably good for older kids, but it’s too big for my almost five year old twins. It hurts their mouths. I bought it for their Halloween costumes."
3.0,"This blouse is loose fitting and very light, stretchy and shimmery, it can be dressed up or down, however I have  only it worn it once because I find he material to be somewhat abrasive on my skin, even after washing with plenty of fabric softener."
3.0,Good looking sandals. I get a lot of compliments but the straps on the side of the shoes are uncomfortable after a while of walking.
3.0,"ok, I am using it.now"
3.0,Came with a scratch already in the lenses. Cute otherwise.
3.0,"Definitely dress sock thin, which I was disappointed about, but the description does say ""dress"". It also says ""sport"", and I expect a sport sock to have some cushion. Rolled up, these are less than half the size of the socks they are meant to be replacing.<br /><br />The socks are pretty and appear to be well made at first blush, but they are thin, and more importantly, WAY TOO SMALL. I wear a 10 or 10 1/2, and it's a stretch to put these on. These are advertised for 10-13, and I don't believe they will fit a 13.  I think it would be more appropriate to advertise these for 8-10. I am worried these are not going to last long."
3.0,Really pretty but way to long
3.0,"These seem to be on the large side of face masks, maybe for people with BIG heads only."
3.0,Battery diedafter 2 weeks.
3.0,"These were purchased to use when playing sports and working out.  The support is decent, but personally I do not feel these effectively contain and maintain location as well as other brands of underwear.<br />I did give these 3 stars because of the breathable fabric used - that is a huge plus; but I would struggle to recommend these for competitive sports."
3.0,These are ok but on the flimsy side.
3.0,"I ordered a M and got a L.  Here's where it gets confusing.  The bag has a M sticker on it but the jacket label is an L.  Seller and Amazon point the finger at each other.  A few replacements got the same result.<br /><br />I decide I want to try a real M so I ordered a S, and sure enough, it came in a bag marked S, with another ""S"" Sharpied onto the cardboard label, but the jacket was an M.<br /><br />Jacket itself is ok, the color is duller (not as shiny) and not as dark as in the pics.  Bottom hand pockets are flat so it's probably just meant for storing your hands; putting anything in them would fall out easily.  There's a stronger factory smell than usual, for lack of a better word, resembling dye or paint perhaps.<br /><br />On the plus side, the faux-Kryptek Typhon pattern is nice, and I probably wouldn't have gotten it without the pattern.  The waist can be adjusted/tightened a bit like a trench coat.  There's a wire through the hood so that it'll hold its shape with plenty of visor room jutting out to block the rain.  It probably needs the gentle cycle and hang drying.  I would've preferred the hood to be detachable; the wire makes it bulkier than regular hoodies.<br /><br />Actual brand is ""Ming Peng"" with a QR code that leads to a defunct taobao .com storefront."
3.0,I like it very much but I returned it was to small
3.0,"It looks beautifully. The only thung is that the pearls are bigger than I expected and when I try it on, it remains very separated. I couldn't adjusted or close it"
3.0,"Decent quality, but does not seem very durable, not bad for $9.99 but no clue how it was originally $200..."
3.0,bought this watch at the gray box store. Strap is great but the clasp is difficult to use and you can not adjust it for different size wrists. Really annoying. After 6 month the battery went dead.
3.0,"I’m normally a 12-13, so i erred on the side of caution and got the 13. It fit small, mostly on the small side of a 12. It still fits, just wished they went on and came off easier.  I wear these in the shower at the gym."
3.0,"Pretty, but the pins were too far apart & that made it too stretched out & loose  on the arm."
3.0,It's hard to snap in the back it's not  your normal hook in type.
3.0,"I like these glasses a lot, but I only had them for about a month when I went to clean the lens and I noticed the bottom of the lens had come unglued from the frame. I'm going to try to get a replacement."
3.0,Exactly what I expected but they don't sit on my ears properly.  May just be me.
3.0,There is a small rhinestone at the center of the scoop neck which really bothers me.  Makes the shirt look cheap and is impossible to remove.
3.0,"Its cute.  The length is ok. However, it is a very noisy necklace."
3.0,"It's pretty, but care is needed because it is not made so well.  For the price, it is worth it."
3.0,The shirts are all sized slightly different  Smaller than expected.
3.0,One of the buttons came off first time I wore them. Sewed it back on then a button on the other came off. Kind of stretched out after wearing. But they look nice
3.0,Cute for a cover up. Smells horrible.  Can't beat the price.
3.0,the color is dark bugandy not at all the color depicted in the picture
3.0,"I needed a long post with the point, to push through my old holes.  These worked for that. They are not quite as vibrant as I thought the picture showed."
3.0,It came with a rip. I have to sew it now. Otherwise as expected.
3.0,"Product not like the image at all, different color, very long, and no neckline."
3.0,"This purse was great for the short while it lasted, but both straps fell off after having it for only four months."
3.0,"It's a really cute key chain! My keychain's coloring is a bit off in some areas. The blue part of the face bled onto the white areas and the red of the collar. On the strap of the keychain, the eyes are very messy. The black bled all over the white parts of the eye. The tail is also blue instead of red. But I'm painting over those discoloration, it isn't a bit deal for me but the quality on mine isn't as great as the product photos. Although the pictures of other customers' keychain looks fine so mine might have been a manufacturing issue instead of the overall quality. It's a keychain and it's adorable!"
3.0,"The tie is not very thick at all and nowhere on the tie tag does it state the material. It only has a sticker on the box claiming to be a silk tie. Looks good, but due to overall quality, I am not expecting more than maybe a year out of this tie at the most."
3.0,It came way too small and I ordered a size larger than I usually wear. The fabric wrinkles so badly that I couldn’t get some of them out even with an iron. Very disappointing
3.0,I love the set and the colour is great but the top is way too big. I pretty much paid for half the set because I cannot wear the top it's so big...
3.0,The photo made these look like more boy short type coverage in the front. They are high cut in the front and not what I expected . But for the price I will just give them to someone instead of sending back. The material itself is a nice quality though . Just wish they were more coverage like the photo.
3.0,"These are cute, but most definitely not linen.  Maybe cotton blend?"
3.0,"A little pricey, but, my Grand-Son enjoyed receiving it.<br />( I hate the HEAT with a passion.) Nice for gift giving."
3.0,"Style, color choices."
3.0,It is extremely small even in a large. It can not fit large beasts inside the shirt
3.0,Not very well fitting if your a size 9
3.0,Got it as a gift. I guess it was my fault i didn't read what the material was. I gave as a gift anyway but got her something else.
3.0,I bought these for my daughter who is consistently a size small. They don't fit like the picture on her and won't last long until she's in a medium. Order a size up if you like roomy boxers. They are a thin fabric (like typical boxers) and are good for warmer weather.
3.0,"Super cute pattern (white with leaves) and top cut, but had to return because the bottom fit odd. The pockets made my hips look huge and was unflattering. I got a small and I’m 5’4 135 lbs 34B for reference - it fit well aside from the weird shape  from the pockets"
3.0,My son loved it but it's to small for him
3.0,So far I haven been able to put them on. Very tight😠
3.0,Style cute but the built in self sucks
3.0,"Received hat, but no Strap!  I really need a Strap!!!"
3.0,I already reviewed this product.  Maybe it was not received.  I washed and dried the hankies on delicate cycle.  They shrunk about 1 inch around.  I was quite disappointed about that.  I have not used them yet though.
3.0,"Love the high waisted, but needs to be a firmer fit"
3.0,The size was very small. I think these errings are meant for children not adults.
3.0,This bag was way too small for what I needed returned it the day after I got it!
3.0,Nice looking dress. It fit well and wasn't too short. I did not wash well. I washed it inside out on gentle and hung it to dry. It pilled badly after the first wash. I was disappointed.
3.0,"I liked that it was a soft comfortable material. However the material was also thin, so together with the pattern and the quality of the material, it looks more like a nightgown rather than something to go out with."
3.0,House shoe
3.0,"I got it fast, but it was to small for me. And I wanted a brighter green it was more pea green"
3.0,"Perhaps my expectation was too high for this jacket... I got M and it fitted lil too big and fluffy especially around arms and shoulders (my true size is XS - S). I looked like wrapped in a sleeping bag. The plastic white buttons also looked cheap, not sturdy enough. The style is unique for sure but It was not flattering for me. I had to send it back. :/"
3.0,Cute for a night or two but it falls apart with wear. You have to be pretty gentle with it.
3.0,Not what I what
3.0,Good product but could not adjust small enough for a 12 year old
3.0,"Love the colors exactly as pictures, however it's much shorter than shown. Still cute, I'm not returning. If it was longer I'd give 5 stars."
3.0,"They are nice and all but they were a little too heavy, I took off like 6 of the tiny hoops now they don’t weigh down as much."
3.0,"I was very much looking forward to really liking these and I did, BUT the thing I didn’t like about them was that it had the word yoga printed on the actual sock. Now that might seem unimportant to you but it really was a deal breaker for me, so I returned them."
3.0,"Not great quality, but this is appropriate for the price."
3.0,"I purchased this product to take towels and other things to the beach. I was expecting it to be larger than what it actually was since it advertised being able to hold a towel on the side insert. The side insert managed to hold my toddler’s towel, not my adult oversized towel. Once placing the items inside the bag, I had a difficult time zipping the bag and ended up having to leave the bag open."
3.0,Money refunded immediately. It was too tight across my chest.
3.0,"Price was certainly great, quality seems good. I sized up, my own fault, because body con dresses can be tricky. It seems the hip area is not in proportion to rest of dress, much larger. If you have an hourglass , with large hips, it will look awesome. I'll probably wear a vest over, or a longer topper. Love the neckline Color is rich for fall."
3.0,Cute but pockets tore on both sides after 2 weeks of wearing. :( total bummer
3.0,"I just had to try these. The concept is brilliant!  But these gloves are gigantic and heavy. I used them to wash some dishes and for them to work, for me, the gloves would have to fit tighter and offer some sort of grippiness, they are very slippery when wet and soapy.  The insides do have a non slip texture to keep them from sliding off your hands but the outsides lack traction.  They may be good for larger scale washing, like an automobile. Dunk gloved hands into a bucket of soapy water and rub down the car.update - these work pretty well for capturing long cat hair on furniture and even from the cat himself."
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, but bought a large. It fits fairly well. The red is a lot brighter than most buffalo check plaid, but I still like it a lot. Good quality for the price."
3.0,"I do not get the logic behind this design.  The top part is okay but lower half pups out, looks like I’m pregnant and ready to deliver."
3.0,Smaller than I thought they would be but it works better than nothing.
3.0,Good for around the house....not sure I would wear it in public.
3.0,"The bottom of this dress is just stunning - the top however was gaping open at the sides of my bust.  I ordered a 4 (which is the smallest size available) and it just hung off the top of me and was extremely loose through my waist. For reference, my measurements are 36 - 27 -39 (28G bra size) at 132 lbs. In addition the price tag said size 4 but the tag in the dress was labeled size 6, so I'm a little confused about that.<br /><br />For as pricey as this dress was, I was disappointed at how incredibly sheer the fabric was even with the lining of the dress."
3.0,"These leggings are super soft and really cute. Unfortunately, I had to send them back because it gave me major camel toe."
3.0,"I bought this for my maternity clients to go along with a bandeau top and to really show off that belly, I ordered a medium thinking that it would be the average female size and it was a stretchy material so I figured it would fit nicely on the women I photograph.  Well when this arrived, I actually tried it on first to see how it fit because it felt pretty small.  I was definitely right, this skirt was tiny, I am a small person so it did fit me but it was tight and it definitely won't fit anyone bigger than me.  The other problem I had was that the material is extremely see through, even wearing white underwear/shorts underneath you can see everything.  I am going to try and alter it to fit the girls and then just fix the transparency in post processing.  But I wouldn't recommend this skirt, it looks beautiful on the product photo but isn't quite the quality you expect.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

3.0,The frame was too wide and did not fit well on my face.  Had to return them.  Otherwise liked the glasses.
3.0,I was disappointed. It looked so nice in the picture but ended up looking like a cheap flannel gown that had some ink on it.
3.0,"Arrived as scheduled, don't know if it fits yet, it is a gift for a month from now."
3.0,overall a good bag to take with you to the beach or a hike but the straps get a bit twisted around. that's why i give it 3 stars.
3.0,"Fit was somewhat small.  Very light material, not great for cold weather.  The arms felt very weird.  Wouldn't recommend."
3.0,Boots were to small returned them.
3.0,"I think this dress would look amazing on some people, just not me.  The cut of bottom of the skirt seemed a little like a Halloween witches dress on me.  The Beck line, though gorgeous, did not sit well on my chest.  I would have needed to wear a bra but did not have a bra that could be worn with this neckline.  It fit true to size and was a true navy."
3.0,I really can't rate this as a Great hat...but it looks cute hanging on my chair on the porch :)
3.0,The item is advertised as “genuine leather” but what arrived is vinyl plastic. The vendor was very reasonable and refunded money promptly. I do believe the ad should be changed.
3.0,"I'm 6'2, 215 lbs and ordered an XL like I do every other sweatshirt.... it fit more like a #X"
3.0,mas pequeño de lo que espere
3.0,"I'm disappointed that I have to return these. I've been searching all over for flesh toned fleece leggings to wear to my freezing office with dresses but these seem to be made for children.I'm not even 5'4 and I couldn't get these up over my hips. They were a little tight, but the issue wasn't the waistband, it was that they simply weren't made long enough. I tried to shimmy and stretch them like I would pantyhose but they didn't go up. I took a picture to show where stop- over my panties. If I'd been able to get them all the way up, I think they would have fit, but been a little tight. I'm about 155 lbs. They're shockingly hard to find in this color in a size other than small.<br /><br />I don't really understand their sizing. The only options I could choose from were S/M, M/L and XXL, so I chose Medium/Large. However, when I added this to my cart it said it was a L/XL size. I was ok figuring this would work better for me. But I would not consider them that size. Since others don't seem to have this problem and I assume they aren't all under 5' tall, maybe their sizing is really inconsistent.<br /><br />Quality-wise they seem fine. I have other fleece lined tights and they seem pretty similar, warm inside, thick and comfortable."
3.0,"Sent as a gift and the recipient liked it, but it was not at all as pictured in the photo.  Not a sweater-shirt or sweater-like cardigan made of heavy, durable material, but more like a blouse made of light material.  In photo looks orange-brownish in color.  What was delivered was more yellow in color.  If you really lower your expectations it is an OK buy."
3.0,"Fits well, though mine was cut in such a way that the neckline doesn't lie flat. I fixed it myself but I don't know if others have had this problem.  Otherwise it's a comfortable, airy summer dress with a pretty pattern.  I've gotten lots of compliments."
3.0,seems somewhat distorted.
3.0,Scratched really easily but worked great otherwise.
3.0,My son did not like the seems it’s soft and has lots of flexibility
3.0,For it to look like the pic don't go a size big
3.0,Se ve mejor en Fotos que cuando las ves de frente
3.0,"I love that this visor slips right over the sides of my sunglasses as I just can’t seem to tolerate a visor that wraps around my head.  This is the second one if this type I’ve owned (did not order the other off Amazon) and on both I have had to replace the elastic loops within the first few uses.  Because I sew, it’s not a big deal for me."
3.0,It's a very cute belt but very fussy. I constantly have to keep adjusting it. I'm not sure it's worth the effort.
3.0,"fit well, as expected.Color was 👍"
3.0,Too cheap of fabric. Good idea but materials too wimpy.
3.0,"I got this pair of barbells for my conch piercing (it ended up cheaper to get the pair than one). The screw ball size was perfect for my conch, but the finish rubbed off of the post pretty quickly (but not the screw ball). After wearing this earring for a while, my conch looked like it was starting to develop a bump, so I changed the jewelry and it quickly got better. Not sure if it's nickle free."
3.0,"It's okay,"
3.0,"I like the Triple layered Necklace, the Gold chain compliments my casual wear of clothing but I was not able to wear it because it came lose and will somehow end up inside of my shirt or fall off my neck."
3.0,"This was a nice set but the size was much smaller , not for a toodler more a baby 6 months or more , it was too small for my 15 month old Grand Daughter"
3.0,Mine broke after just two days... It's pretty but really cheaply made.
3.0,No shine.
3.0,The top is amazing quality and guys week but the bottom is incredibly small. I'm usually a size 6 on bottom and got a medium. The bottoms we're barely big enough to get post my thighs. I am not sure if sizing up would have made a difference. I won't return but I would caution to buy a different bottom with this.
3.0,The quality of this tee was fine but the sizing is an issue. This women's shirt in the small I ordered is as big as a men's medium although the tag says small
3.0,not good quality.
3.0,"It seems nice to me in the picture, but it's a nice cotton fabric"
3.0,Poor stitching on some shirts
3.0,"These glasses are okay. These are flimsy quality. The huge problem I have with these glasses is that they keep falling off super easily, they need way better bridge pads. I love the golden glittery case they come with, it's really solid and protects them well and fits in my bag easily."
3.0,The coat is a little heavy and i don't care for the way it hangs like a rag on me.The shipping also took a month.Going to give to me daughter in law.
3.0,The glasses are cool and the tint is good but the crome is very reflective and usually shines the sun into your eyes. They do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. But they look cool
3.0,"Cute skirt but too small. I am a 26 waist, 125 lbs, and ordered a small. While it did zip up, it was way too short. All your goodies will be exposed if you turn or bend wrong."
3.0,"I bought the bags to use as goodie bags for the kids at my beach wedding. They work great for that, but all the bags have strange shoe prints."
3.0,This hat is kind of shallow and it kept slipping off of my head.
3.0,It’s smaller than I thought. The straps are stiff and rubs the neck and shoulders in a rough fashion. It’s a good purse for someone that doesn’t carry a lot of things. It is an overall beautiful purse but not what I needed.
3.0,"I am 5'3'' and 128lbs. I typically wear a small ankle length legging in order to get the right fit. Regular length are way too long for my short legs. I was very hopeful that these would fit right, but I was disappointed. The xs-m are too big. They are a little too long, but I can make them work, however they do not fit as shown in the pics.  I prefer the waist to sit just below my belly button as shown in the pic. These come well above my belly button, half way up to my chest! They are extremely high waisted which I really dislike."
3.0,The bottom is perfect.  The top is way too large. I'm a 38C and it's very wide and the cups are huge.
3.0,"I purchased an XS, but should have purchased a S.  However, while the pants is a bit on the tight side, the jacket is just too big and shapeless."
3.0,I like it but is smaller than I thought
3.0,They were too short waisted for me.  But my sister loves them.
3.0,"I love these so much. But the post is so big, they don’t do in my ears. It makes me sad because I would wear them everyday! I can’t wear them at all."
3.0,Order a 2XL it fit like a extra large
3.0,These are supposed to be black but other then that I like and they fit well
3.0,"Very cute and fits great, but shotty sewing, the strap broke within a month"
3.0,"Comfortable. A little small. Cups are more like nipple covers! No real support for bigger boobs so can’t wear as an undershirt without a bra but ok to wear around the house, which was the reason for the purchase.  Might be a bit sticky in the Vegas summer"
3.0,"Not what I expected. I bought theses to wear as shorts. Yeah not so much. They fit like underwear, I ordered big because well they are underwear! And they just fit but I could wear them under cloths because they are form fitting. But I’ll keep them. Maybe my husband will wear the not as “cute” pairs. 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,"I received the shirt yesterday and immediately wanted to try it on, as it did fit as it was supposed to, I was surprised that it was printed on a fruit of the loom shirt. Although I bought this when it was on sale for 4.99 I honestly can't say I would be keeping it if I paid any higher for it.<br />Overall, it does seem to be an ok shirt"
3.0,"Well, I went ahead and bought and used this on my ear in spite of all the people out there saying DO NOT USE A GUN for cartilage piercing.  They may be right about that as I've never had a needle used in my piercings and I have a long ways to go to heal this new piercing without infection.  This was my first cartilage and my first &#34;self&#34; piercing.  The earring itself seemed a little wobbly when placed in the gun and that could be, but not necessarily, why the placement of the earring was off.  I wanted it completely on the upper cartilage area but it ended up going half into cartilage and half into the little lip around the upper ear (the helix).  Anyhow, that was good enough for me.  Amazingly it did not hurt at all during or right after BUT IT HURT LIKE HECK for two days afterwards. Red and throbbing.  Ouch!  Anyhow, it is now my third day and the throbbing has stopped and it is not as red.  But boy, it hurts to touch it even with my hair which I now keep pinned back away from the stud.  Am trying very hard to keep it clean and not infected as I understand it can happen rather easily with cartilage piercings.  At this point, the product did do what it advertised it would do although I only gave it 3 stars because of the wobbly stud."
3.0,Disliked fit.
3.0,"Quality was good but the design was not as pictured. My daughter’s favorite pony is Rainbow Dash, which is why we ordered these, but none of the masks were if her or even incorporated her. Because if that, she won’t wear any of them ☹️"
3.0,"It is a very nice feeling and looking wrap but unfortunately the sizes don't run true, I got the size I would normally purchase in a store but it is too small at the hips. If I loose about 20 lbs by next summer it may fit nicely. If not I will give it to my teen granddaughter."
3.0,"Fits well, get compliments. But after a few washes the fabric is piling."
3.0,"The design is adorable. The ring is holding up pretty well with the exception of the stones, four of them have fallen out."
3.0,They look cool but the nosepieces are super loose and aren't comfortable.
3.0,"It was a nice dress, but cut way to small."
3.0,These bows are super cute but the bows come undone pretty quickly. I suppose you can use a glue gun to glue them back in place but it's a little disappointing.
3.0,Bad thing is first time I washed it the elastic inside the socks started popping out.
3.0,This necklace is darker than the picture shows. It's more of a dark mustard than the off white that is presented. I won't return because its only a dollar. But I will be painting it.
3.0,I got my husband an XL as he would normally wear. It was so tight. We ended up getting him a 3x. Sounds huge but it’s a much better fit for him. Quality is fine. Nothing fancy.
3.0,Nice but not exactly as pic. The lace part at top is a little cheaper than the look presented in pic but its workable.<br />A little bit big at the bottom but will have it tailored. To be exoected since I am slim generally but have big boobs.<br />Color is on point!
3.0,"Ok, I ordered two pairs of these. One for my mother in law who's favorite color is blue and one for myself. I was happy with how quickly the product got to my door. For that I give a great happy dance! However, I was disappointed about the lack of luster it showed when it got here. It is not as nice as the picture. My mother in law loved them but she would say anything because that's just the kind of person she is. I on the other hand expect more from what I buy. If I buy something that is like a simulated sapphire I want it to LOOK like a sapphire. This product does not in my opinion."
3.0,A little too heavy and bulky of a shoe for my taste
3.0,"The color is awesome will definitely be able to spot this on the airport turn style and the size is perfect. I was completely excited to take this from the box when I received it.  But once I actually touched it my smile went away. It is almost as soft as my cloth luggage. I'm hoping that it will be durable enough for my trip, the sides are much more softer than other hard side luggage I've seen in the past."
3.0,A little big but love the top. Glad i bought it
3.0,Ordered a youth large but it seemed very small. Had to return.
3.0,"This is a nice cross, and I have another in green that I really like.  However, the stone is NOT the color pictured.  Although the seller states that colors can vary due to the authenticity of the stone,  this is the second time I've purchased and the deep color depicted is not at all what arrived.  Both times the stone has been a very pale lavender, and I don't expect that the color shown in the description is even available.  As someone who finds color very important, this is quite disappointing!<br />I would love to post a photo, but that option is not available to me in this review."
3.0,"Nice, but one size only"
3.0,"I did return this because it was too small.  However the quality was really good, and it was a cute shirt!"
3.0,"The one downside is that once I put my phone and two credit cards in it, I couldn't close it. I think it would be easy for someone to swipe my phone if I am not constantly vigilant. I bought this to wear when I go to fairs so I don't have to carry a purse but this one problem makes me nervous."
3.0,I ordered this for my two year. I would order a size up.
3.0,"Port fell out with first use.  I guess if you’re super gentle with it, opening port verrry carefully each time...  or just cut off the flip cap and allow the “cross” split-gasket underneath to serve as your barrier... now I gotta see how to get this back on, or maybe return it...."
3.0,These are so cute...but...one of them doesn't have the red fuzz and sparkly stuff! So bummed.
3.0,still rides up my legs
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d0834a7e888b3f5bc27842230510745c]] It looks beautiful when you take it from the box but simple wear over a week or so and the pearl coating wears off and then you have a much less attractive watch band.  Disappointed how quickly the pearls wore away.
3.0,Wish blade angle could be adjusted.
3.0,Lots of strings to catch your toes on the inside. Some were not shaped quite like a foot. That being said. Zero of the socks have ripped and they were inexpensive
3.0,"not full enough coverage for me, but very pretty!"
3.0,Fit very well.  Looks more like a night gown than mumu.  Not a day dress.  But happy with purchase.
3.0,"The shirt and sleeves were long enough for me, which is impressive since I’m tall (6 ft). However there is no form to this shirt so it fits like a box. It turned into nice sleepwear."
3.0,"I fly frequently and my legs swell up like balloons. Very uncomfortable. Besides the discomfort, I am always looking for a way to reduce my risk of DVT. These socks arrived just in time for 36+ hours of air travel and they were ok. I wore them on a transatlantic flight and when I removed the socks I still had some swelling. The swelling did go away quicker than normal, but after another 10+ hours of flying, the socks did nothing to relieve the swelling. I wore them anyway and will continue to do so for the reduced DVT risk, but these socks only reduced my swelling by maybe 20%. Ill keep looking for the perfect pair, but until then, these will do."
3.0,Smaller then I thought they'd be and one earring was broken. Had to use superglue to get it to stick together since this was a Christmas present and I didn't have time to wait around for a refund or another pair to show up. Just hope my mom doesn't notice where I had to fix it.
3.0,"I was hoping these would be what I was looking for. Well, they were, but they slip off of my heel as other brands. They have a non-slip silicone inside, but it doesn't help much."
3.0,"Product would fit need, but needing to un-snap after first wear, one of the anchors pulled out of the material at the snap. Even after using  both hands to carefully unsnap each.  Otherwise,  works well."
3.0,I love the jacket but it runs on the small side.  i ordered i size up. but should have ordered 2 sizes up for a comfortable fit
3.0,not as found of the lace part as I hoped
3.0,La tela es muy suave eso me encanta pero queda un poco ajustada
3.0,"First time I bought from Gary Majdell, I wear a medium in everything These shorts are baggy and do not fit as a medium should. Disappointed in the fit Will wear them around the house but will definitely wear them at the gym where I teach yoga."
3.0,"I loved the style, but it was much too small"
3.0,Aspecto económico en la tela
3.0,"I got the green stones with silver setting. They are just OK - I was not dazzled by them.  Spending approximately $18 after paying for shipping, I would not buy these again."
3.0,"Eeeeh! It was okay, first off I assumed it was close to the size of a pocket watch...NOT. Its the size of a quarter! Secondly, its way darker than the picture shows, not nearly as nice, but I will still incorporate it into my Steampunk costume decor...thank goodness it was offered at a good price."
3.0,"It fits true to size, I love the fact tht it's long enough in the pants, I like the color I'm usually a xlg but I should have gotten a 2x I want the pants to fit a lil baggy for my ht and build."
3.0,Not as much room as I  thought. Credit cards het stuck in the zipper. Maybe it will loosen up with age.
3.0,"The sleeves are too puffy and it doesn't sit in the right place on my waist, it kind of poofs out a little. Could look better on other people though."
3.0,"I like the feel and more subtle pattern on the black that came in the multi color pack much better than all of these ones. Still, they are as pictured and as described.  Maybe I just need to wash them 10x or so."
3.0,Kids house
3.0,It's really cute! I wore it for months till I broke it trying to slide it off instead of unlatching it from the back.
3.0,"Comfortable, light weight and true to the size"
3.0,"Out of the box, this bag looks used. It is very distressed looking. I was disappointed. It is extremely well made, the leather is nice and the canvas is sturdy, but it isn't appealing to me."
3.0,"They were too small for the original person purchased for so, my husband happen to take them and loved then."
3.0,"Very pretty, great purchase for price; however, they state that they are silver plated...  My wife is not allergic to gold or silver, but she is allergic to Nickel, and she had an allergic reaction after wearing these earings."
3.0,I love the bottoms but the top not so much. Feels like a swim top. I will purchase a separate top to match. Otherwise the shorts are super cute and comfy
3.0,I thought it was hard cork but it's not. But it's a cool bag.
3.0,"They are exactly as pictured, but the tunnel itself is rather long. This, along side the weight cause them to ""droop"" which if you are trying to conceal the fact that your ears are stretched- does not work. They are also slightly obnoxious with the clanking noise they make, even when just barely moving.<br />Other than that, they're okay."
3.0,The back dose not go all the way down like the front.
3.0,"The coat is nice but, at least 3 sizes smaller."
3.0,"Nice material, not cheaply made but I have a long torso so it was too short for me."
3.0,Overall a good outfit but gloves were extremely small and stockings were very tight. The shoulder pieces are very cheaply made and fell apart. The rest of the outfit was really cute.
3.0,Not the best socks I have - a little thin for me
3.0,Way too large and material is a little cheap.  I'm 5'2 110 lb
3.0,"The shirt is very cute and soft but the pants were so tight and would fit maybe a newborn. Kind of disappointed, I bout the set as a Birthday present and the pants are not useable at all :-("
3.0,The shirt was alright. I wear it every once and awhile but it is not the staple I though it would be. It is thicker than expected with thick seams on the inside between every color change. There is not a tag so I am sure which side is front or back.
3.0,"I really wanted to like and keep this dress. However, one thing that the other reviews fail to mention is the weird fleece line. That would be great if I was buying it for the winter or fall, but I bought a white dress fir the summer. The fleece lining will definitely be too hot."
3.0,"Cute, kind of makes my butt look flat. Looks nicer if you pull it up towards your waist, above the knee."
3.0,"Most of these tops with peplums, the waist hit me somewhere between my navel and my bra!  Not a good look and I tried every size.  They were made in Asia for asían size women!!"
3.0,They're ok but I found something I like better and BEWARE - it says &#34;this item is not returnable&#34; when I went to return them.  Nice of them to mention that in advance!!
3.0,Fits small but once you get the size that works for you it's awesome.
3.0,Not bad...difficult to close sometimes....kinda awkward to put through piercings
3.0,I normally wear a medium and ordered a size large to be safe and the are still I little snug
3.0,The details are good and they don’t turn your fingers green but a couple have broken very easily
3.0,Very nice fabric but was not sized as a small. Had to take the sides in. Length was good.
3.0,"thick cheap looking, not the nicest piece I have seen, disappointed in this piece, will not use as a necklace, may put somewhere else."
3.0,"The fit was fine, but the embroidery was already showing some loose threads. Not that surprising given the origin of the shirt."
3.0,"Wanted it to be a little smaller, runs big. Kept in for maternity (hopefully)"
3.0,"The pictured dress is beautiful and what I received was beautiful, but the material was very heavy.  Reminded me of a heavy velvet drapery.  the back did not lay flat where the ""fake"" lace up is .. it just didn't work for me.  But it did arrive as expected from the shipper and was in good shape."
3.0,"A little smaller than expected. Doesn’t wash so well, getting dinghy after 3 washes."
3.0,They are a nice fabric and print. But I ordered a 3x and received one size fits all.
3.0,"Very pretty - it looks good on.  The leather is cheap though but for the price, it's nice!"
3.0,Its very big. Works for the beach.
3.0,"The shirt is nice and cute, but it's cut tighter than it looks in the model. On her it seems loose fitting. In person it's alms fitted. Design and colors are nice but not a huge fan of how it fits"
3.0,"These will work for my halloween costume, but they're not great quality. The fur came out of the package crimped and not laying smooth."
3.0,5 stars for customer service.  Zero stars for jacket.<br /> Returned.  Coat felt like a cross between a t-shirt and a thin curtain.  Easy to return and full refund issued.  Thank you for standing by your reputation when the product was subpar!
3.0,The top size smaller than the bottom for XL size.
3.0,"The case is great, and they are quite durable, however the nose bridge is extremely uncomfortable. I can't wear them more the 10 minutes without my nose starting to ache."
3.0,"VERY comfy, but It says Hand Wash, and I haven’t been able to get all the wrinkles out."
3.0,It has a nice pattern and the straps are very nice. I was was just looking for more support.
3.0,"I think it's a nice wallet. However,  I didnt like the way it felt, or that it was slightly stiff.  I returned it without any problems."
3.0,It works and looks nice but the ear pieces are super uncomfortable no matter how they’re set. The things that hold the tightness of the mask also look awkward
3.0,Quality is great...wonderful fleece and style is super cute...BUT...we ordered a medium...fits like an extra small!!...Also took about 1-1/2 months to get it since it is shipped from China...
3.0,Very cute outfit but its three times bigger than what the size should have been
3.0,"If you're looking for something to wear once or twice for a decent price, this dress will work. I was disappointed in the quality though. It's a little less crisp, fluffy, and fitted than the listing photo, and the zipper, as has been mentioned, it's definitely cheap. I also didn't like the sizing options. My little girl is a size 5, but there is no size 5 in this dress. I got a 6, and it's ok, but makes her look a little malnourished. I'm afraid a 4 would be too small. But like I said, if you want a quick, cheap, and pretty dress, this is definitely an option to consider. It's lovely, other than the issues mentioned."
3.0,"Pretty, seems well made. I ordered up one band size (36B instead of my regular 34B) due to previous reviews and that worked perfect, however, the straps are just too short. Adjusted all the way out it still rides a bit too high and cuts under the arms.<br />The cups are more narrowly spaced together than most bras, that and the wide side bands along with the padding do help create nice cleavage, but is just not comfortable to wear.<br />This bra is only going to work well on small frame ladies."
3.0,"The covers shed and look cheap, otherwise okay."
3.0,"I used to wear primarily 100% cotton t-shirts.  I wanted to get one of those new high performance t-shirts that are light weight and wick the moisture away from the body and breath well to keep me cool.  These high performance t-shits are usually made from polyester, however I have discovered that all polyester fabrics are not the same.  In fact that is probably more variation in the polyester fabrics than there are different weight and types of cotton.  This makes buying a good high performance t-shirt challenging.  In order to order to find one that worked for me I bought several and here is the results of my research:<br /><br />Denali Performance Men’s UPF 50+ ProtectUV Short Sleeve T-Shirt - Large Green<br />- I am keeping this one but it tends to be a bit on the warm side.  Not a good at breathing as the others.  OK for cooler weather.<br /><br />DRIEQUIP Men's Short Sleeve Moisture Wicking T-Shirt-ForestGreenHeather-L<br />- This one was the worst of the 6.  The fabric was prickly and felt warm when wearing it.  It got returned.<br /><br />Pretchic Men's UV Sun Protection UPF 50+ Short Sleeve Sports T Shirt Grey L<br />- This shirt was tied for best with the Amazon Essentials t-shirt.  It feels good to the skin, is light weight, and breaths well.  I plan to buy more.<br /><br />Amazon Essentials Men's Tech Stretch Short-Sleeve Performance T-Shirt, navy heather, Large<br />- This shirt was tied for best with the Pretchic t-shirt.  It feels good to the skin, is light weight, and breaths well.  I plan to buy more.<br /><br />BALEAF Men's Quick Dry Short Sleeve T-Shirt Running Workout Shirts Heather Red Size L<br />- This t-shirt has a shinny finish on the fabric and was the most “dressy” of all the t-shirts tested.  It looks nice but is not as good at breathing as Amazon Essentials Men’s Tech Short-Sleeve Performance t-shirt or Pretchic Men's UV Sun Protection UPF 50+ Short Sleeve Sports T Shirt.<br /><br />Hanes Men's Cool Dri UPF 50 Moisture Wicking T-Shirt, Maroon, Large<br />- I am keeping this one but it tends to be a bit on the warm side.  Not a good at breathing as the others.  OK for cooler weather."
3.0,It appears to be a poncho in the photo but the actual item is really more of a wide scarf.  It is much longer in front than across the back when you put it on.  Fabric has a wool/fleece feeling.
3.0,Not loving this costume but I guess it works for one day. First off: the neckline was very high and not very sexy. I cut mine down and haphazardly sewed it back together. The waistline is very itchy where the seam is sewn together. I had to wear high waisted shorts underneath. The fit is off. It was too large in the chest but a smaller size wouldn't have covered my booty. I ironed it like 3 times but it was still wrinkled. The choker kept spinning around because the velcro clasp wasn't centered properly. I just wasn't impressed at all. It worked for Halloween but I wouldn't recommend.
3.0,Very cheap and easily damaged
3.0,"These sunglasses are more of a novelty item than real sunglasses. They are huge, and make me look ridicules. Perhaps good for a summer party or at the beach. However, these are not something one wants to wear everyday."
3.0,Very loose fitting but I’m ok with that.
3.0,"Like the glasses, but don't drop!  The lens will crack / spit.  I originally paid $20+, they are down to $10 now.  To drop once and crack..."
3.0,"I ordered both sizes and ended up returning both. I’m a size 10 and a medium. The bigger size was HUGE - way too wide, but the length was good. The smaller size fit, but it was too short in the front. Also, the pocket placement was a little high. I loved the fabric and style though."
3.0,This outfit runs large. It gave my daughter a diaper booty look since the bottom is big.
3.0,"Love the earrings, but the stud came loose. Trying superglue."
3.0,They don’t seem to keep feet warm with shoes but work pretty good with boots.
3.0,Bought this for my hubby for Fathers Day. He is a professional Santa and had been looking for a Santa looking watch! He loved it! Works great! The reason for only 3 stars is that the gold tone finish is already wearing off. 6 weeks? I guess it is true ... you get what you paid for .... 😖
3.0,This set is super cute but it’s kinda itchy.
3.0,Like the exterior. Wish there would have been a photo of the interior
3.0,i am 5'6 and it was too short for me to wear but it was cute!
3.0,Runs small.  Doesn’t really have breathable fabric.  The style is great.  Not one of my favorites that I’ve ordered.  Doesn’t really move with your body.  The material isn’t too stretchy
3.0,Wished they had belt loops
3.0,Cute but runs small. Returning
3.0,Very beautiful pictures when I bought the dress but this is much more basic and simple when you see it in person to try it on. I was not as impressed as I was looking at the pics.
3.0,Quality and colors are fine but sizing is 2-3 sizes off. Ordered and received XL but they fit like a medium. Adjust accordingly.
3.0,Didn't fit like a regular jumper. Scrunch area was too high on the stomach and back. Would fit good otherwise.
3.0,"These work ok but the plastic is a bit soft. They seem to not hold as well under the load of a tight cover. They sort of work , but not perfect."
3.0,"Cute, but the gold color looks a little off. It's definitely cheap."
3.0,"These pants are really cute and comfortable but they are completely transparent!  I purchased three different ones and for the amount they sold for, I would have expected they'd at least have a lining.  I had hoped to enjoy them during the summer but I'm having to wear them with tights which makes it very hot.  I may take them to a tailor and have lining added on.  The material is very delicate so this will definitely be a hand wash."
3.0,"i try not to buy synthetics because they don't breathe well...i don't know if i overlooked something or if the product was wrongly described. i decided for 14.99 via Brad's deals, i was just gonna keep it, wear it, use it up and dump it."
3.0,"Function buttons seam to stick, when pressed. Other than that, worth it."
3.0,Pretty to look at and sturdy but functionaly could be higher to accomadate necklaces beyond 12 inches...
3.0,Pro: It's made of steel and is more durable than the rest of the wooden shoe stretchers. Con: Does not spread far enough to provide proper stretch.
3.0,Fell apart way sooner than no brand menstrual underwear. A little bulky. Has sleek look but then pants slide off. Don’t know that I’d recommend
3.0,"The idea of this dress is great but the fabric, and actual cut of it isn't. I'd order a size down if you are not gifted in the chest area like me."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, well made.<br />Dress was quite a bit longer and a little loose.<br />I am 5&#34;11 145 lbs 36A. I purchased a medium.<br />Washed in hot water and put in the dryer... Shrunk up and fits much better"
3.0,"The sequins fall off, so I wear a different tank top underneath."
3.0,Broke after a strong windy storm but looks adorable.
3.0,I don’t like the material of the sweater
3.0,This runs absolutely very very small unfortunately I’ve ordered it twice and every time I’ve ordered it it’s never been in the right size for the size that I’ve ordered is not the size it says it is
3.0,They slip off your frames. Did not really float either. My frames press me hard and this did soften up and primary reason I purchased so all good. Did what I needed it to do.
3.0,"Very wide legs. I bought these for my teenage son who's about 5'9"" skinny as a toothpick so the hem had to come up a bit to accommodate growth. It is extremely hard to find black dress pants for a size 30x36. Alterations necessary but worked out ok."
3.0,I originally bought these for a male friend of mine but they run very small and I was not able to give them to him. On the plus side they ended up fitting me so I kept them lol. The pockets are awesome but the material has started to get slightly pilly from wearing them frequently. I wish the material was a little better but over all I like them.
3.0,only prob is that it is very thick and hard to breathe thru for longer
3.0,"First of all, these are thin and silky, and my kids love them! However, I had to throw away the first one, because the stitching started to come out. I thought this was due to my error of machine washing this item even though I did wash on delicate cycle, and hung to dry.<br /><br />The second one now has started to unravel too, and it has not been washed yet."
3.0,The view is fantastic but the frame is crooked and doesn’t fit right. I am constantly adjusting them on my face and they aren’t comfortable.  For the price I will be donating these to a thrift store.
3.0,"Didn't fits me ,I gave it to my daughter was to small."
3.0,Size fit fine for me. Not a “sport” tank like they said though! Resembles an undershirt/T-shirt more than a workout shirt.
3.0,"In my  opinion;  this is what I thought of the shoes and why I return them :<br />1)  to severe of a slant<br />2)  the heel is made of very hard rubber;  and it was  light in weight which makes made me think heel is hollow<br />3)  surface is very smooth on the sole / bottom of shoe<br />Looks nice but felt very  unsafe to walk in waxed floors, smooth carpeting; any &#34;slick&#34; surface."
3.0,"Great price and color, but two issues. The collar was quite awkward, and did not lay properly. Also, the dress is rather sheer."
3.0,"Pockets everywhere, except where you want them.  Hand pockets somewhere up around your chest.  No interior security pocket, but, pockets all over the arms and in the back.  What conventional purpose does a left wrist pocket have?  Zipper on the opposite side from where you expect it, likely a British trait and mildly annoying.  Speaking of Britain, it takes forever to get here, and mailing back would likely cost as much as the product.  But, good construction and heavy.  An item best not purchased online due to personal preference.  Bite the bullet and $up for Patagonia or Columbia at local outdoor store.  Or really geek it up and go for North Face."
3.0,too short for 5.10
3.0,It was a little too big. Should of went with a medium 🙄
3.0,They took their sweet time shipping it. Took its sweet time getting here. Came in a bag with Chinese characters on it. If it is a Chinese knock off sold for the same price as a real Raceface it's hard to tell just from looking.
3.0,"Socks were exactly as I expected, good quality good fit. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the amount of time it took to get them."
3.0,Some of the hoops you have to force to lock. They hurt my ears
3.0,Sent it as a gift and it didn't come with the wording.  Kind of disappointed.
3.0,Not any different from any other leather necklaces... you can barely see the name on it
3.0,"Some fit very nice, others did not. I don't particularly like boy cut style underwear, I got 4, they will work for my workouts though. One of the underwear did rip when I tested the stretchiness, no good."
3.0,A bit larger & cheaper looking then I expected.
3.0,The shirt is super cute but it smelled like cigarette smoke. Right when I opened the bag I could immediately smell it and the shirt smelled so strong.
3.0,Nice. Decent fit
3.0,these culottes were very disappointing for me. The waist is very small and the rest is large! Silky polyester causes these pants to billow out making one's  bum & thighs look huge.  I am 5'5&#34; & weigh just 122lbs. so i was very disappointed because they are really cute.
3.0,These are nice but the nylon thickness is not as good as other brands. They are 22mm wide by thickness I mean the actual weight of the material is lighter than expected. They do look good it's just unclear how long they will last. All the stitching and hardware look good and they should hang in there for at least a couple years.<br /><br />Overall good value for the price and what you get.
3.0,This size is somewhat small than I expected.
3.0,"Not as warm as I thought they should keep my hands. But very, very soft."
3.0,The quality is ok... you get what you pay for ... obviously not a Huk fishing shirt.
3.0,"While this is a nice,stylish bag the discounted 50 dollar price tag on amazon still seems a little pricey for what you get. The material and workmanship seem fine, but it lacks decent organization . They call it a laptop messenger, but there is no padded sleeve for a laptop! The interior organizer pockets are just extra pieces of lining and give no support. The exterior side pockets are too small for a water bottle and are only good for slipping a pair of reading glasses in, provided they are not in a case! There is no grab handle on top so you have to always sling it over your shoulder. The cool green color they offer is really brown.<br /><br />If you need a bag for business this is certainly not it . If you want to stash some work clothes, a light jacket, or some gear inside it is fine. All in all a nice looking bag, just wish the design and features were a little better thought out especially at this price point.<br /><br />Footnote: after having this bag almost 2months the Velcro that holds the flap down is pretty much shot. Poorly designed, it should have magnetic snaps to hold it closed like they have on the narrow, impractical side pockets.<br /><br />Had to pay a shoemaker 15 dollars to sew a leather grab handle on top of bag. Money well spent but it should have come with one. Now I have to pay more money to have magnetic snaps put on flap so it will stay closed.<br /><br />On the plus side, the bag is really nice looking and I received compliments on it. The strap is plenty long and comfortable to wear cross body."
3.0,I love how they are tight around the waist and aren’t too long. I absolutely love the look as well! Unfortunately it’s extremely big/baggy below the pelvis where it looks like something else!
3.0,"He was happy with it,"
3.0,Hard to zip up and after using it twice pocket has a hole in it.
3.0,"Overall I love the band, and it is super comfy to wear. The only odd thing is on one side the band seems almost too wide for the area it is in. It is rolled up on the sides looking like it is being squeezed in (first picture, top on the second picture)"
3.0,Fit a little snug but CUTE
3.0,I like the case but the hard back of the case has had all 4 corners break off already
3.0,The color emerald green is not as it is on the picture. It's a lot &#34;greener&#34; so i returned it. But the quality is nice.
3.0,It was a little too feminine looking(on my wrist) for my taste.  I gave it to my mom.
3.0,Thin like really thin
3.0,"This bra &#34;fits,&#34; if fitting is what you call squeezing into it and having to do some serious tucking to avoid spilling out, lol. I normally wear a 40D but by the size guidelines was told a 36C would be perfect for me. That being said, there is definitely very little bounce going on when doing high impact moves such as jumping jacks, so I think I can get used to it if the tight fit if it means I am more comfortable during exercise. If you would rather not adapt in this way, however, you might want to consider ordering a size up from what is indicated in the chart guidelines."
3.0,Xl was not the xl that I purchased with other shirts.  This was bought for my grandson and although he likes the shirt it is not large enough.
3.0,Wheels do not feel very sturdy.
3.0,Cuteness overload but thin cheap material
3.0,"This coat is absolutely gorgeous and well made, but it fits so small!  I am 5'7&#34;, average build, average chest, and I wear a large in coats.  After reading the reviews that said the coat ran small, I ordered an XXL (figuring it would fit, with room to spare).  Nope, too tight in the arms, and the buttons couldn't even reach to close!<br /><br />If I ordered an XXXXL, maybe it would have fit.  Sizing is way off on this coat, so I would NOT recommend for ladies with a medium size or larger body frame.  If you are a size zero, the XL may work for you.<br /><br />I am in the process of returning the coat for a refund...I will put an update as to how smoothly that process goes as it was shipped from China.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Coat  came from overseas, so they offered me 50% refund (which they quickly refunded).  They said it would be too expensive to return and maybe I can give it too a friend.  I accepted the 50% refund.  Seller was very nice and responded quickly.  If they sell something other than clothes, I would buy from them again, but I will not buy clothes as the sizes are way off."
3.0,Ordered a large. Which is my normal go to size and it fit more like a medium.
3.0,Love the ring only let down is that it is black and not silver like the picture.
3.0,"These are sturdy, well made, and look lovely. They are a little snug for wide footed folks so they are a little pinchy, but I think wearing them in will loosen them a little."
3.0,"This dress looks way better on other people (I.e. model) than it did on myself. I’m 5’2 and I think that this dress would look great on a taller person, but it didn’t do too much for me. However, I loved the flowy, light-weight material and the button up part."
3.0,"too see through, didn't lay correctly"
3.0,The zipper broke after a week.
3.0,WAYYYYYY tooooo tiny
3.0,Pedometer never worked which was one of the key features my daughter was looking forward to.
3.0,Too small around the ankle/calf. I have a normal size leg (8 1/2” around) and these are too tight around the top. They cut off my circulation and make my leg swell on either side of the top band. They really are not a warm as other thin Merino socks. I would not buy them again. Gave them to a bone-thin homeless person and the fit her. It was the best gift ever in her mind.
3.0,"I want to love this but I got a medium and it's HUGE.  I'm swimming in it.  I've worn it with a shirt underneath, open and with jeans or leggings instead of as depicted in the picture and it's still cute.  I'm 5'6&#34; and wear a 6/8 in jeans.  Order a size down, because oversized is one thing, but this is really oversized."
3.0,Looks good. Size come way smaller Than normal. I had to return and order 2 sizes bigger than I normally would.
3.0,It might fit perfectly for a young girl.
3.0,This runs small.  I suggest going up 1 size!
3.0,"I had my doubts these were real coach classes but was assured they were.  Their definitely not, the sides are so thin I’m afraid their going to break when I wear them. Very disappointed that I was mislead."
3.0,"When I wear a comfy tshirt, I don't want to have to iron cuffs on my sleeves.  Those sleeves were a bad idea.  At my house that thing magically turned into a jama shirt.  I wore it last night to bed."
3.0,The sizes are smaller than regular store clothes. I ordered a large and it clung to me- not what I expected.
3.0,Very nice material and kept me warm however the type of material they lined it with sheds A LOT.... my hands and anything I touched were cover in the shedding that came off.... I dont even want to wear it anymore tbh...
3.0,"This hat came on time. With a great fit, and the lamp is actually rechargeable.  Unlike the first one I ordered. Which took the c23 battery and isn't chargeable.  This one was just as advertised. Maybe even better"
3.0,"I love this dress, it is beautiful and very well made. The lace is thick enough you know it won't tear. Unfortunately, it was super small. We ordered a medium, my normal size, and i couldn't zip it up. Sadly will have to return. I hope to exchange for a larger size and will update review then."
3.0,Very pretty.  My daughter loves it
3.0,"The design, well, I only say not really comfortable on head."
3.0,Comfortable fabric but who puts a seem down the back of a sleep shirt. I can wear this around the house but NOT to sleep in. Seems are too prominent and uncomfortable.
3.0,The product doesn't fit like the picture.  Tight around the breast and arms although I looked at the chart to make sure I ordered the right size.
3.0,"Not sure what's up with the reviews on this but when talking about these bracelets the same link pops up soo, you get a 2 for 1 special on this review.<br /><br />First up is the leather braided bracelet.  It's like 2 Stars just a basic braid that isn't that great.<br /><br />The leather is pretty thin and the color is a bit drab.  I have other costume jewelry by Sunsoul and it’s great for its price-point.  This one isn’t my favorite.  It does however, look much better when it  is paired with more items.  Easy to pull on, I didn’t adjust the size so they may be more difficult.  Overall, this isn’t fantastic or total blah.<br /><br />Second item up is the Black leather open cuff bracelet.  This is actually more like a 4 star bracelet.  It isn't overly thick (you can see it in the photos ) with copper end caps.  Bracelet or Cuff is open enough that most people should be able to easily get it onto their wrists with out making any adjustments.  If you do need to adjust this, it is simple, a small amount of pressure when pulling at the opening will spread this cuff, then reapply pressure to close comfortably on your wrist.  For me this is a bit more masculine in look when worn by itself.  But I like the materials and make of this more then the previous one.<br /><br />There you have it 2 for 1 special on reviews."
3.0,I'm 6'2 200lbs. I have the black pair and they fit great but they are made from a completely different material than these. These don't stretch nearly as much but they work for a very specific look that I will have to work out somehow. Not happy  Not Unhappy. I would suggest getting the plaid ones or the black ones over these.
3.0,"I got these to bring to the hospital with me when I deliver my son and don't find them to be super comfortable. There isn't any extra padding on the inside of the sock, so you can really feel each of the grips pressing into the bottom of your foot. It gets the job done, just not my favorite thing to walk around in."
3.0,"I wore this dress one time and it was nice, however, when I went to wear it a second time the zipper broke."
3.0,The material is thin and almost like straight spandex. I don't really like the material but the fit is nice.
3.0,"Skirt is beautiful, but was too small for me.  Ordered a M that fits my S daughter."
3.0,Had a mildew spell.
3.0,Pretty cute! The cuff was bent when it arrived so that is why I did not give 5 stars. The earring is very shiny and pretty and after bending the cuff back I can wear it with no problem. It does get a little uncomfortable after a while but again I think that is because the cuff is still a little wonky because the other one I have like it does not bother my ear.
3.0,Barely would consider this compression but I do like the design
3.0,"I do like it, I wish it were lined. a bit boxy , made me feel square"
3.0,Paint started to wear off immediately. Clasp is sturdy but a bit bulky.
3.0,I liked it but too large.  I gave it to my cousin she loves it
3.0,straps were broken
3.0,I was really excited for this as I love Rose Quartz.  The stone itself is really nice and pretty.  It was everything else I was not a huge fan of.  This looks really cheap.  It is more of something I would give my child than for myself.  The chain and design were cheap feeling and looking and not something that blew me away.
3.0,"Looks good, but one of the finger loops immediately came off.  It was fairly easy to sew back on."
3.0,"I was excited to receive this, and yes! It’s good quality with nice box! But….. it came as super dirty, I wiped off pendant.  Something seem not able to clean, I realize that hair inside of enamel😭.  I usually never complain products but feels gross to wear hair on me so I replace this item."
3.0,"Little disappointed since when I saw the key chain it shows 2 of them in the picture. When it arrived it was only 1 key chain, guess I should have read the fine print a little closer."
3.0,these definitely seem smaller than expected. I bought the right size according to the chart but couldn’t get all of the laces through to the last holes so stopped one up and they were still on the tighter side and pressed on my daughters in step area if the tongue didn’t sit right. It’s a great idea but maybe size up if you’re not sure on the fit.
3.0,Very cute. Looks like picture. Sleeves are shorter then they should be. Unless I pull thumb holes over thumb the hearts aren’t even elbow patches.
3.0,It's a bit small and no inclusions (ie insects)
3.0,Es un artículo cómodos y muy necesario
3.0,The charms are cute but some of them are not made correctly. They weren't placed on there right so the glitter could fall out at some point. Overall I would recommend buying two at a time so you will at least have one pair of each. I'd say about 8 of the glitter balls were messed up.
3.0,"I love this bag, its very lightweight and pretty. Perfect for going down to the pool or beach. However, I am not giving it 5 stars because I never received the smaller pouch that was supposed to come with it."
3.0,I wanted to love it but I just like it.  The clasp is a little confusing.  It works!
3.0,Cute but not made for my body type.  If you are pear shaped this is for you.
3.0,"Falls apart very easy, get them as temporary shoes. Barely walk around yet fell apart. Fit great. Not like originals"
3.0,I think these are in petite sizes. Was a bit small.
3.0,I wear it for everyday use. Very comfortable
3.0,"perfect as long as you don't wash it, the black faded immediately when washed on cold"
3.0,Ear holes are too small and don't stretch.  The material is thin and breathable. I want to use this while hiking to just bring the front part up and down when passing someone. You may have to cut the ear holes and replace them to use this often.
3.0,"Very gorgeous set of septum rings, but I ordered the 8mm and they are smaller then some 8mm I have on hand. If you have a super tiny nose and the 8mm are kinda big, then these would be perfect."
3.0,Ordered the 2 pack and only 1 was in it.
3.0,"It’s a pretty heavy charm, but the hole for the ashes is almost nonexistent. The charm needs a different hanging holder, it keeps flipping over."
3.0,the wings were kinda hard to deal with because of the elastic..it broke but hey we made it work
3.0,Fits really loose. Not like leggings at all. Colors are on point.
3.0,"I loved everything about this dress -- except for the back of it. If a photo had been provided for the back, I wouldn't have ordered it. It is nearly backless, with an eyehook up top and a pretty low cut on the bottom. It also cuts pretty close to the front on the side. I'm large-chested, so had I managed to find a bra that worked in the first place, I would have been in danger of some major sideboob. Not the look I was going for overall for my body type. However, the color is as pictured and gorgeous, and from the front it had a great shape."
3.0,Ordered a size 4 for my 8 year old when I reordered a 2 was still a little big but kept the 2 so she can grow into them. Her foot measured 8 incense so this was no help on the size chart because it said a size 4
3.0,"Finish and box is nice, feel the clips themselves are a little short"
3.0,Key ring ended up breaking off with In a week
3.0,"Sizing is off, runs small, product is ok otherwise"
3.0,Super cute but I’m normally a medium and had to reorder a large but still wishing I would’ve got an XL
3.0,"This shirt is made of a thin, lightweight material. It's perfect for summer and is great quality. I love this brand and the price was good."
3.0,Super cute but couldn't get around the chemical smell.  Bummer!
3.0,"A good little sock monkey, overall build quality is good, however it arrived missing an eye. Larger than I anticipated which was nice, has a good amount of stuffing and is cute. My daughter loves it, I intended for it to be a Christmas present however my daughter accidentally walked in on me opening the box. I was quite disappointed that it was missing an eye but my daughter thought it gave it character. Would have tried to return it if she didn't like it. But overall it is a very nice sock monkey given the price."
3.0,"I'm an apple not a pear shape and the cut through the top seems a bit small for my barrel chest, but my husband doesn't feel like it looks that way.  Otherwise, very flattering. Still debating on keeping it based on the price.  For that price I would like to feel better about it."
3.0,"Definitely smaller than expected, but it's SO CUTE so I stuffed myself in there. FYI not a great source of support for bigger chests."
3.0,"It’s cute but a little too boxy and big for me. I’m 5’5”, 125 lbs."
3.0,Crystal fell off the chain multiple times
3.0,This run just a little big.  After a couple of washings they still look ok.  A little bit of pilling but better than many of the other kids socks out there.  Why is it so hard to find kids socks that wash as well as adults?!
3.0,"Too small, thin fabric"
3.0,This was the second one I received that had the same issue. Missing a gold dagger(leaf). Last one had same issue: wouldn’t be a big deal except it’s one of the ones that lay across the face so ends up being very noticeable.
3.0,Skirt fits perfectly but the shirt is too small. The fabric on both are thin.
3.0,Item was larger that expected
3.0,"Nice watch,  but came with a dead battery."
3.0,"They are $8, you get what you paid for"
3.0,Gave this watch as a gift to a friend that is a starwars fanboy.  The watch itself is fine but the clasp on the band broke within a week of me giving it to him.
3.0,"These are beautifully made. I was so disappointed that they didn't fit. The sizing chart said to order a large for a normal size 7. these were definitely not a standard US size 7. I am returning them and after my account has been credited, I will re-order an Xlg. The return process seems easy enough. I was ready to reorder as I have my refund but they have removed the size chart. UPDATE: I received a refund and sent these back no problem. Reordered a larger size. Now a problem occurs as two pair are perfect size and 2 too small. See pictures. I love these but will clearly not reorder them due to their sizing and packaging issues."
3.0,This had a very odd fir and just looked too boxy. I returned it. Very soft and thick hat though
3.0,Small and it looked like something I got at the dollar store!
3.0,"Pretty earrings, but poorly made. Multiple studs with gemstone fittings lost stones just by touching them / removing them from the package. The remaining earrings OK, but bummed about the handful of useless earrings."
3.0,Need some padding
3.0,"Love this top in black, white not so much. I am 125, and it is a one size item, that might fit someone with a large bust and weight of 140 better."
3.0,not sure about smaller sizes but for bigger girls the size chart is off. ordered my size according to measurements and item was too big so I returned it.<br />overall quality of the item seemed fine for the price.
3.0,"I am not a diabetic, but I do have severe sciatic nerve pain which gives me pain down my left leg and the top of my foot at the ankle.<br />I ordered these socks because the compression of normal socks hurts.  The socks are soft and well made, but didn't quite give me the comfort I need.  I felt the compression in the areas I needed none.  These probably will be ok for most people."
3.0,The detail of the bag looks nice with a nice long strap....a nice black bag goes pretty much with pretty everything. However I just noticed a little scuff mark towards the back of the bag. When I shop I try to get things in perfect condition as my boyfriend says to me what do you expect getting bags from China lol nothing really comes in perfect shape! Thou it came in as brand new in a plastic bag. Lastly this bag probably will fit 2 cell phones anything else's it won't fit just to give y'all an idea of how much things u can really fit in. Otherwise it's just an okay bag
3.0,"Meh, they’re okay. Was hoping they were cotton. Material is more of a polyester which I’m not a fan of. Ordered XXL, yusually wear l-xl and they were still tight. I’m 5’ 9’ and they are still super long. Wouldn’t buy again."
3.0,"I loved this shirt when I put it on. Fit great and was so flattering. Unfortunately, the elastic in the arm broke when I wore it."
3.0,"A lot of fabric, order size smaller"
3.0,"It is very comfortable.  True to size, however  it looks longer in the picture.  I wanted to wear with leggings. It comes to my waist.  I'm only 5'2."
3.0,one of the pink bead  was broken. Despite the broken bread it's a very nice mothers Day gift for your mom.
3.0,"Pretty bag. Cheap qaulity though. It's likely it will maybe last one summer. I got what I paid for. It's cute just very thin and lite.<br /><br />Just an update after less than 45 days of gentle use this bad is falling apart.  The stitching that attaches the handles to the bag has pulled off.  I don't put anything by my wallet, chap stick and sunglasses in the bag.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  I knew it would probably only last one summer but less than two months is no good."
3.0,Pendant as expected but tourquoise looks fake.
3.0,"Sheer and not flattering unless you are very fit and thin! For the price it is not bad, but keep in mind you will be able to see through some areas"
3.0,"I loved everything about this shirt. The material, the picture was great, and I received it in a timely manner. The only problem is it was very very small. I ordered it as a gift for a friend. I followed the sizing chart and I even sized up so I got her a 2XL. It came in and it was like a medium."
3.0,"So I ordered the pink. The first time it arrived the chain/strap was tangled into a knot so badly I couldn’t undo it, I returned and ordered a new one. New one is fine. Cute and compact, I like it. I will say the strap is kind of short (can’t wear it cross body) and the pink is much more of a nude color. But still a cute little bag."
3.0,"Super cute,  runs small."
3.0,The charm is good the necklace is very flimsy had to buy a new necklace to put with a charm
3.0,Decent readers for the price
3.0,I didn’t expect much because of how cheap they are but they are too big & kept breaking off.
3.0,"They’re comfortable, but too big and extremely long. I got a M and they fit like an XL. They do shrink some in the dryer though."
3.0,thin for summer
3.0,Bought this for my newborn coming home outfit and it’s basically for 6 months or older babies lol! Was disappointed but I still got use out of it later. Otherwise it’s super cute! You can’t really use the hair thingy because it’s too silky and keeps coming undone.
3.0,Very pretty head piece. It is extremely heavy . If you are looking for light on your head then this is not for you . It is beautiful and hangs well just is very thick and heavy .
3.0,"Does not naturally close at front, hanging silhouette is boxy. Stiffer fabric than anticipated. Feels obviously synthetic against akin but still breathable and not itchy."
3.0,"Fits a size larger, while the t-shirt material is on the thicker side and is nice, this is just a basic t-shirt. There isn’t anything fancy, or, details on this shirt, just a t-shirt. Seems slightly highly priced for this piece."
3.0,"To evaluate what other reviewers have said about this scarf: First, mine doesn't have any scent; so it does not smell. It is soft and not that thick. It is long, which I do like. This isn't as neutral as others mentioned. All my grey clothing are true greys. This grey scarf is more grey-green, thus clashing with any shades of grey clothing that I own. Unless you have a grey-green coat or blouse/sweater, this grey (scarf) will not really complement them."
3.0,"The fabric comes off very often, it's like a shedding dog. I wish the fabric were as soft and smooth as it is without having it come off. Other than that, it is very warm and nice. But I leave a trail of fabric wherever I go, so it is easy to follow me, especially if I were trying to hide from someone."
3.0,"I use these as undershirts because they were way tighter than I expected. They don't stay very dry. However, the tank does a good job at not smelling badly after a workout."
3.0,"I tested for color fastness and it was fine. Followed the instructions, stiffened up the brim of my hat easily. BUT the only problem is that there are a couple spots where it left yellow spots. Such a bummer since the bottle clearly says DOES NOT YELLOW OR FLAKE.<br /><br />Definitely a problem."
3.0,Ok. Shipment took couple of weeks. Product is ok.
3.0,"The quality seems so, so.  It is not fully coloured as the underside is white."
3.0,I usually wear a small (5’ 6” - 127 pounds) but the small was really big. The crotch hung low and left a lot of space. The top fit well and the length was ok but the middle was too big.
3.0,She love it and now sleeps in the bath rob my bad that i didnt see it was  plushy  bathrobe not towel :(
3.0,"Like many other buyers of these glasses, I found that they were not a good value.  They just barely fit in the case and I'm afraid the fit is so tight that taking them in and out of the case will eventually damage them.  Everything else about them is acceptable, they're just not worth $20."
3.0,Nice clothing but sized way small!!!
3.0,The colors of the stones in the tail are not as bright or vibrant as those in picture. They're actually very muted and only 2 colors.  The peacock is more substantial than I thought it would be but seems to be securely on the cover.  Love peacocks and will use this when I go out or special occasions.
3.0,"its a Little bit loose, mainly on the legs. I did not used it yet, to tell you about quality after chlorine water. I'll update later"
3.0,"I think It’s a ok pants for summer.... but, definitely not for cold weather."
3.0,My daughter likes the shirt but the fabric can snag easily.
3.0,"These were better made in the 80's. For all the people complaining about the small size, back then watches didn't look like a cookie on a strap. But we also had parachute pants, so there you go. Yes, it's worth your time to YouTube parachute pants."
3.0,Looks exactly like picture and arrived earlier than expected. I was disappointed because I thought the strap would be longer since it was an over the shoukder bag.
3.0,It's nice but heavyweight empty...
3.0,"I felt 47 trying to be 17.  Attempted to give it to my step daughter, but she wasn't enthused, either."
3.0,"It's cute, but cheap. You get what you pay for... no complaints."
3.0,"Good quality,cute shirts. Only thing my daughter usually is a 6 she is 6 and is about 48lbs and these were a little snug for her."
3.0,Did not have pockets.
3.0,I generally wear a L or XL.  I ordered the XL and it is very snug.  More snug than I like to wear my shirts.  The description says 'loose' and I would say this is incorrect.  I would return but it is too expensive to return to China or I would.  It did arrive earlier than expected.
3.0,"Wow. These are huge panties. But very fun. Will probably order much, much smaller."
3.0,"Stays on pretty well, quality is okay and the price is reasonable."
3.0,"Beautiful watch... Just to small of a face! 34mm face.<br /><br />Not knowing metric sizes right off hand, I now realize how small 34mm is in terms of watch faces."
3.0,I gave 3 stars because I ordered a small and it came in as extra large. But also the shirt is very comfortable.
3.0,It looks sloppier than on the picture
3.0,"Beautiful dress but the zipper is absolutely horrendous! Worst zipper I’ve ever encountered. Took me 2 minutes just to unzip the dress to try on. Also be aware that this dress runs small. It is a beautiful dress, though."
3.0,"Sturdy, nice piece of jewelry. However, I could not fit the industrial in my ear with the snake on it because the snake is too long for me."
3.0,Ordered a small and it’s still not tight enough but it’s only waist length and I’m 6’1 270+lbs
3.0,The clasp did not work when received (new in package)
3.0,"They seem nice, unfortunately my 2 year old was still too skinny to be able to use these to wear many jeans. Stretch pants forever I guess."
3.0,"I have a few other silicone rings and was excited to order these at a discount!  I ordered the same size I normally order in silicone rings (always a size UP) yet these are still pretty snug.  I am recommending people buy at least one size larger than their actual ring size, maybe even two sizes larger if you aren't taking plastic gloves off and on while wearing them (I sometimes wear a men's silicone ring that is a little too big and have had it come off when I remove my gloves).<br />These rings are a bit thicker than I've seen for other women's rings, more in line with a men's ring and they can really only be worn as shown, and not inside out giving the ring less of a bubble look, due to the large company name stamp.  I like wearing my silicone rings this way, so that is not an issue for me.  I absolutely love the bright teal and pink colors.  It's the main reason I gave them 3 stars, along with the affordability of a four pack buying option.<br />If you want to wear a ring while swimming, working out, while fingers are swollen or while doing work with your hands and are concerned with wearing your metal rings, than I can't recommend getting a silicone ring more.<br />Pros: colors true to picture, affordable 4 pack option, carrying bag and speedy shipping<br />Cons: sizes too small and rings too thick"
3.0,"I bought them as gym and workout shorts. I find them to be true to size and light weight; however, they are not comfortable because they bunch up. You have to continuously pull and tug at them. I won’t be wearing them back to the gym."
3.0,"They look nice and block out the sun well, but the color is a little off from the picture. The tortoise in the pic looks like a spotted red and pink, but is actually orange and more of a magenta leaning towards purple. The side pieces seem a little short, so they are tighter against my ears compared with other sunglasses of this same brand. If I wear them for a really long time they hurt. I didn't save the packaging and they are cheap enough so I've kept them as my driving glasses only."
3.0,"While it looks alright, it is NOT even close to what's in the picture... The little bag it comes in is gorgeous though and that's where most of my stars are going tbh"
3.0,"Size is very large, way to big for me."
3.0,This shirt was cute but didn't fit like I was expecting it to fit
3.0,"I loved the look in the photos but this isn't the cardigan for me. The bottom hip-band is too wide and not flattering at all. The shape around the hip and wrists bulges out a lot. So rather than slimming - which I thought it would be - it looks bulky and accentuates bulk. I thought it would be thin or more tailored around the waist like an hourglass, which is how I'm shaped. It's not. It's more like a balloon, so even if I got a size smaller, I don't think I'd like it. It's pretty good quality construction, though. Solid stitching and the snaps are good quality."
3.0,"Not very durable and, in the top of the size range, excruciatingly small.  Mine hurt after under a mile of hiking over smooth terrain."
3.0,Good material and stretchy
3.0,"The shoes are cute and comfortable, but the buckle is not normal. I don’t even know how to describe it. But it is not very secure and not very easily adjustable so that it’s comfortable."
3.0,"Nice watch.  I've received a number of compliments about it.  My only complaint is that the watchband is weird.  The way it's built, you have a long end that sticks out with no &#34;sleeve&#34; or loop in which to tuck it.  Kinda bulky."
3.0,"I have tried different insoles (e.g Hydrofeet, HappyStep). The NAZAROO insoles are hard and uncomfortable."
3.0,Hopefully once they are broken in they will fit better
3.0,"I bought extra big so it would hang like the photo, but it does not."
3.0,Love the color. Picked for winter Family Pics. Loved the Velvet. However it was way too short to wear as a dress. It's more of a shirt.
3.0,"Love the product but it broke after the third time my sister used it, the pendant is heavy and the hook broke"
3.0,Great concept but ran a bit small length-wise.  I would have tried a size up but I think it would have only been wider and it was already a bit too big for me across the shoulders.
3.0,"This suit is so cute, and fit exactly as expected. But the white lining in the cups would not stay folded inside. If I was crafty I would've come up with a way to fix this and kept the suit. Instead, I returned it for a hassle-free refund."
3.0,I ordered my usual size for mini control underwear - I think I should have gone down in size for they are way too large.
3.0,I ordered  this with the high waisted matching pants. I like the shirt but they do not match at all. The shirt is more of a sherbert and the pants are a highlighter orange. I cant wear this as a set as pictured.  So disappointed.
3.0,The quality of the fabric on the short is not that great. And the size is smaller a what I was spectating.
3.0,I bought 2 of these. On for my 38mm and one for my husbands 42mm. My husband wore his all the time and after about 6 months the metal parts broke. Mine is still working great but I change my band to match my clothes so it doesn't get as much use.
3.0,and having paid as much for them (and I bought 2 for my granddaughter for her birthday)<br />it was very disappointing that they run as small as they do and she will not get as much<br />wear out of them as I had hoped. . .
3.0,Generally love Pavoli earrings for their simple and small elegance. These look cheaper and a<br />Title larger than expected.
3.0,"The shirt itself is nice, a sturdier fabric than I expected for the price. But it's way too big. Based on reviews, I ordered the 12-14 when I usually wear a 16, and this shirt was still huge. I think it would match up to a 1X or even 2X, certainly not a 12-14."
3.0,The material is thicker than I expected but it fits great!
3.0,Sleeves are a odd fit.
3.0,Broke after minimal wear
3.0,"This watch is much bigger than it appears in the picture. There should be something next to it to compare the size. Also, the band is very difficult to fasten. Took a long time to make it smaller and then fasten it so it held. I'd look for something else if I had it to do over again."
3.0,Not a horrible pair of leggings for the price. Was much more thin then I was anticipating. Probable will not buy another pair anytime soon.
3.0,"Fabric is soft, very comfortable ... but it's way too long.  I'm 5 ft 2, I ordered the XS ... and it wiping the floor as I walk.  No choice but returned it."
3.0,"I guess I should have gotten a larger size. It fit, it zipped, but it.... was not cute. It was too short and it was too tight. I like that the fabric is breathable which is nice in the summer heat. And I like the zipper on the side which lets the romper hug your curves instead of being frumpy. I was given this product at a discount for my unbiased review."
3.0,Excellent customer service but this bra was not for me 🤔😕😟
3.0,I found a small and it fit too tight.
3.0,"I bought the first 2 from Gatlinburg Tn, originally, and the first one broke with in a few weeks and the second one broke less than a year later, The second one I never took off, I put it on and left it never taking it off and it broke in 2 places. I love the ring obviously but I wish it where more durable."
3.0,They turned ears green.<br />Very disappointed
3.0,"Nice shirt, but unfortunately mis-sized."
3.0,"I and my son liked the color, very bright and very light weight.. but it was too large and very very roomy. Had to return it."
3.0,Not very windproof.  One strong wind and now it doesn't seem to work anymore.
3.0,Cute shirt but definitely runs a bit small. I ordered a L so it would be comfortable on me but it's easily a size too small.
3.0,It’s OK… Fine what I’m using it for could be a little longer.
3.0,It's cute but the only zipper is that front showing one making it akward to add/remove larger items from it...
3.0,"The fabric in much thicker than it shows on the picture almost, it run big and long."
3.0,"the picture shows the knee leigh but it came really short, way shorter the provided picture. i am 5'3 120 lb size small. dissapoined"
3.0,Bought one of these a few years ago and it was great. This one is smaller and has elastic all across the top and bottom not just the sides. It’s too uncomfortable to me to wear. I gave it to my daughter and she seems to like it. She wears it often. I would only suggest this for a small adult face maybe a teen?
3.0,"Great shoe, a bit bigger and wider but little flat on cushions."
3.0,They are not all made of the same fabric
3.0,Doesn’t feel that comfortable.
3.0,They are very cut boots
3.0,"This is a well crafter piece of jewelry. The silver definitely outshines the center diamonds. I was disappointed to get a notification one day after my purchase that the price had decreased to 59.99 from 79.99. Considering you can barely see the center diamonds. 59.99 is the much better price. Although Im not completely happy with the purchase, my daughter was happy. It was a Gift for her 25th Birthday. As long as she was made happy thats all that matters."
3.0,"I'm going to start by saying I love these because they mean so much to me. I wear the pendant on a necklace every day. However, it's showing some wear. I expected it would because it's cheap. But I will definitely buy again when the wear becomes too much."
3.0,"I bought this for a friends daughter and she just turned 5 I figured I would get a 6 as I read the reviews, and came to that conclusion. She is average weight and size for 5. I was so disappointed when I saw them, as they looked so small and not looking at the size tag, you would of thought they were a 3."
3.0,"Fits very nice, soft material, stretchy, only complaint is the length was off it’s not as long as Ide like it goes to about the top of my ankle"
3.0,The shoe is good but because of the charging wires you need one size bigger to fit
3.0,good. I used to them to pierce my nose again. the multicolor is really unnatural in my opinion. a bit hard to get it. kinda irritating but not horrible. you can see its not a full loop probably better for people with more prominent nostrils
3.0,Represented as women's size yet band very small and tight on my wrist.
3.0,Queda mucho más grande de lo esperado. Tela es cálida por lo que en climas tropicales no lo recomiendo.
3.0,Smaller than it appears and the Velcro fastener is cheaply constructed.  I don’t expect it to last very long.
3.0,Love the way they fit and feel. Top band does not hold the sock up as well as I expected. The heel is already showing wear after one time therefore I am concerned they will not last. I will not buy more because of this concern.
3.0,See through and doesnt fit my chest.  36DD
3.0,This is going to be the second time returning because of size.  First toooo BIG then to small.  I am going to try one last time because the shoes is adorable but if it doesn’t work I’m done.
3.0,Seems to be falling apart after a months worth of wear. Threads are pulling out. I wouldn’t purchase this again
3.0,Kind of scratchy But keep my feet nice and warm
3.0,"I bought these for my husband having no idea what to expect, they seemed like a decent product for the cost. Not super fancy, nice enough to wear daily but not be sad if something happens to them"
3.0,I use it as my gardening and fishing watch.<br />The band could have been a little bit bigger. The light on the watch is so so but it's okay.
3.0,Some was really dark and some were misspelled but I got the ones I needed
3.0,Cute blouse but size was too big .. Not true to size had to give it to a friend..
3.0,$18 dollars and this is how it arrives...
3.0,"Initially I was pleased, but the next day the prong broke. Did not sleep in the earrings. I don't believe they are very secured. Only one but I am going to trash them both. Too bad."
3.0,I've worn pendant and chain maybe a total of 20 hours and the gold finish is already fading on it unhappy about that but overall it came maybe within 5 days
3.0,"Great trendy glasses, delivery took longer than expected be patient they'll eventually get there."
3.0,"I’m usually always a medium when it comes down to dresses, but this dress fit me super HUGE and the sleeves are very long!! The material is really stretchy. I feel like 2 of me could fit in the dress. I’m sure it will look nice as a maternity dress once I eventually get pregnant. It’s a pretty dress though with great thick material!"
3.0,I love this wristlet but I have issues with the zipper since I got it. I would order another but I am afraid I will have the same issue.
3.0,very very see through FYI
3.0,You get what you pay for. Very loose and stretched out even looser after wearing. Also gets really dirty very quickly because of the material.
3.0,Good material for the price. Had to return coz it is too fitting. Will probably get a size up.
3.0,"This is SUPER CUTE, I love the print and the design of this item. but it has a TERRIBLE SMELL. :-\"
3.0,"The hoodie itself is attractive and made well. The fit, however, is small compared to other similar styles on Amazon. One size up may be necessary."
3.0,When I looked at the picture to buy it it looked like the colors where perfect and there was nothing wrong with them. Until I got them in and some of spots on the charms where supposed to be white but red was there and when the bottem part of the mushrooms where supposed to be white there where alot of spots of red there. So the colors where colored very porely. I wish I looked at the reveiws before I orderd.
3.0,"good fit, looks good on.  fabric is not what i thought it would be like, it's very heavy and scratchy.  only used it once and now it's in the back of a drawer."
3.0,"I find it ridiculous that even though most humans have TWO feet, only ONE anklet comes with the product.  So, order two of them...the quality is ok I guess"
3.0,"Seems like a nice shoe, seems to run a little short.  I always wear a perfect size 9. Surprisingly my toes hit the end in this 9.<br />I would have ordered a full size up to 10 so I could put a gel pad in the toe box for the ball of my feet, but they didn’t give me the option to exchange.  Return only.  So I would have to pay $125 again and wait a couple weeks for my refund until they receive the other by mail.<br />So I tried a different brand for nurses, similar looking with tons of good reviews at a quarter of the price.  And won’t have to wait weeks to get them, prime eligible!"
3.0,I don’t like the skirt under the tulle. It is too restrictive of movement and I needed this skirt for a dance. Also looked cheaper in real life than in picture
3.0,"Large in hips and legs, very small in the waist. Wish it was a bit more tapered in the body or larger in waist so I could get the correct size. Quality isn't great. Buttons ripped off after first wash. Could be the chambray fabric. Have found that the black version holds up to washing much better. Maybe reinforcing the buttons as soon as purchased would solve some issues."
3.0,"I fell in love with these booties at first site. ABSOLUTELY HAD TO HAVE THEM.  So much so that I bought them in both black & white instantly, one click, 2 day shipping.  I could not wait for them to arrive.  Unfortunately, though, these booties were more disappointing than they were adorable.  They just be be frizzle and make me grizzle.  Sorry about that.  Every now and then, my inner 'G' comes out and becomes noticeable in my writing.  My apologies.  Allow me to explain.  When my booties arrived, they looked exactly like the pictures, and I am still in love with the style.  (Fuzzy boots are definitely my thing).  And so, without question, these booties WOULD HAVE been my All-Time-FAVS, and I WOULD HAVE worn them at every opportunity .... HAD I BEEN ABLE TO. (and NO, I don't mean I have a hard time putting on no-lace-slip-on boots, nor do I have a problem putting one foot in front of the other and then repeating same while aiming for a projected location). What I mean is I CANNOT WEAR THESE BOOTIES OUTSIDE.  Major F#@king Bummer.  I wanted to wear them with so many winter outfits (the whole point of the purchase x 2) but I just couldn't.  My feet would always end up soaking wet, and the concrete would shred the bottoms very quickly.  Rocks and other debris would cling to the fabric bottom, and I could feel every single (sometimes sharp) annoying Lil' nasty thingy that was hitchin' a free ride on my beloved booties. [Grrrrrrr!!!] &#60; --- (that's a grizzle). In my opinion, for $20, they should have rubber soles or at least a hard plastic protective layer on the bottom.  It's extremely disappointing when you find something you absolutely love and cannot wait to receive, but when it finally arrives and you wear them a few times, you realize you got jipped.  Did I really just spend $40 on two pairs of booties that were made so cheaply, I can't even wear them outside? DON'T ANSWER THAT SELF. [Grrrrrr!!!] &#60; --- (you already know). See? Now you get me, so let me ask you this... Did these frizzles make you grizzle?"
3.0,Loved the skirt up until.... The zipper ripped and broke. I wore it to a wedding. And at one point if the night the top part of the zipper popped and broke. Was really sad cause I thought this skirt was quality. Now I have to figure out how to get the zipper replaced.
3.0,The fit and cut of this dress was nice but I really don’t care for the material.  It’s super shiny and “rubbery” so it ends up looking like a nightgown.
3.0,"Liked the fabric, but very loose fit and awkward at bust with the layers underneath. Returned as it just wasn’t for me. Might be a good maternity dress option?"
3.0,"This is the first time I've ordered from this brand, and considering that my usual Amazon-based sizing chart I'm usually between XL and XXL, I chose the &#34;safer&#34; router and ordered an XXL. Even considering that the specified size is XXL, it's more like a regular L or small XL, so take that into account.<br /><br />Also the fabric seems decent quality, though for some people it might seem rougher than expected."
3.0,It's really cute but the flower logo is literally just a sticky back. It came right off after the first wash. But it's cute.
3.0,I actually loved the design but the dress runs way too small.  It states the sizes and I ordered the one that stated my size and it was too small.<br />Too bad.  very cute.
3.0,Can see through in sunlight. Don't wear outside!
3.0,When I went to put the shoes on for the first time it was torn. Now I can’t wear my shoes and I can’t get my money back on it
3.0,I'm typically a size M and I ordered a L and it fits fine. I ordered the pink and its dull compared to the brightness of the advertised photo. This shirt is short so if you don't like the idea of a short shirt I'd advise to keep looking. Hides the love handles so I'm okay with it.
3.0,They were cute just look very cheap and some of the rhinestones were missing
3.0,The pendant doesn’t stay on the necklace so what I did was I actually ordered another necklace to put the pendant on from a different company.
3.0,"This shirt is very light weight, which I like but I find it a bit short and is snug in the upper arm and shoulders.  I even bought a size larger than I normally wear and still is a little snugger than I like for a workout or tennis shirt."
3.0,"Arrived as expected, but interior box looked like it had been opened... was dirty and battered. Watch strap was good, and easy to adjust with tool, however watch face is cheap looking, and was slightly scratched on face, as it wasn't covered in plastic, like it's inner side was"
3.0,I'm tall 5'10 so its no stranger to buy maxi dresses that aren't quite long enough. This dress is pretty but falls above my ankles.
3.0,The design is great and the fabric feels sturdy. I ordered a S and it fits big at the waist (125 lbs small waist) and it's a little too long for my height (5'5). I am going to exchange it for an XS because I really like the look of it.
3.0,"Looks good, but broke quickly."
3.0,"TOP PART OF THE SHIRT DOES FIT RIGHT, FALLS OFF THE SHOULDERS. I GOT A SMALL"
3.0,"The size and shape of the pearls are nice, however I did not realize these were dyed black.  The color is very dull and like luster. I haven't decided if I will keep them.  I have had good experience with JYX and I'm sure they will accommodate my needs.  I will give 5 stars to the vendor but 3 stars to this particular product."
3.0,"It is pretty, however I ordered a  XXL because many of the comments mentioned it runs small.  I will be giving it away because the coverup fits to tightly to be comfortable as a cover up"
3.0,Cute shirt from afar. Fits nicely.  Returned because the material looked and felt cheap.
3.0,Very tight. I can't use it but one of my younger children can.
3.0,Short than expected
3.0,The battery died on the third day of having it and then came back on and now only works intermittantly. It's pretty and fits perfectly on my badge but I need that watch to be reliable so I ended up getting a different one.
3.0,"Good size. The good kind of leather but it's not all leather. The inner parts are thin polyester. Cards were a bit tight at first but seem fine now. I wanted one like this where the cards came out from inside, so when it stretches they don't fall out easily, and it didn't have a useless ugly id slot. That was a bit harder to find and had to settle with this ugly pabin logo. I kind of removed it by pressing so I don't think it's heat embossed and soaking should work. Outside pocket is convenient but not rfid protected, it's just a leather pocket, but I couldn't care less about rfid although every wallet is nowadays. My proximity card still works so I'm not sure the protection even works. The metal fiber used for protection makes it stiff."
3.0,It was sized smal
3.0,"Tighter and shorter than I had hoped. Soft, stretchy material though."
3.0,Love this purse but have only used it for a month and the strap for the MK emblem is already tearing apart
3.0,"Color not as pictured, but could have been my screen"
3.0,Too small. I’m usually a 14-16 and I got the biggest size.  The arms are small.  The quality of the dress was good.  Very pretty.  I’m very curvy and this dress just didn’t do anything for my figure.
3.0,Material is great and is very soft and breathable but the tanks are very short and ride up
3.0,It's cute but very big for my baby. Maybe in a couple of month he can wear it.
3.0,These bras are comfy and the perfect length. The padding in the cups is annoying and make my boobs look fake so I took them out. The straps slide off my shoulders but I ran a paper clip between the rings in the back of the straps and made them racer back bras and they were perfect.
3.0,Great costume for my 11yo daughter. We paired with a white turtleneck & red/white hair bow and sneakers and her Halloween costume was complete. My only issue with this is that the colors immediately bled and stained her turtleneck and skin. But as long as my daughter was happy (even just for 1 day) then it's okay with me.
3.0,"Great print, but way too big. A little thin, but ok for the summer weather."
3.0,Fits slightly smaller. Go up one size.
3.0,"Used size chart, but it was too small.  I can't imagine who this would fit as I am rather thin.  Very ugly and the material is thin."
3.0,"Cute outfit but in no way squat proof at all!!! I ordered a medium as suggested when I typically wear a small, but even the mediums are completely see through when bending over. Such a shame because it looks cute but I would personally never wear to a gym"
3.0,A little tight in the ankle.  I am trying to stretch them a little.
3.0,"I so wanted to love this shoe as much when I received it as I did when I ordered it. Sadly, the shoe you see is not the shoe you get. It could be considered bronze but would be better described as a bronzed brown and the variation between the colors is barely noticeable. It's too brown to be as versatile as preferred but it is a really cute, well constructed shoe, especially if you want something brown with a little pizazz."
3.0,Brand new crown royal bags but dang that price. Way to high of a price for bags. Shop around you will find them cheaper
3.0,"This  belt is way wider that what it looks in the picture, But its not too bad so I kept it"
3.0,La calidad de la  tela no es muy buena
3.0,They are cute but when receiving the product the the stones are not quite like the picture they are smaller and aren't perfectly alined and they don't fit the ear as pictured. Still nice though and I do like them.
3.0,Thin.  Sash not sewn to robe.
3.0,"The description stated:  Snug Tank Top (a tighter fit), for a more relaxed fit, consider ordering up a size.<br />So I ordered a medium instead of a small and it was loose.  It would probably been true to size but that statement is misleading."
3.0,It look bigger in the picture. The extra fabric for shoes is a good idea but it looks funny. But the bag design without the extra bag looks real good.
3.0,Cheaply made but the Bat-man fan loves it.
3.0,Brighter colors than I expected. Soft but not real thick which is fine. Seems to run big!
3.0,"Jumper was cute but, tie string in front broke in one day was really upset because i planned on wearing it again"
3.0,"At 5 ft 8.5 and 125 lbs, I'm usually a size 0-2 in dresses, but found it hard to take deep breaths in the green dress(I'm an A cup). It's beautiful, though. If you are really petite, this could be the perfect dress for you."
3.0,"It's cute but I'm not sure that I want to keep this necklace. It cost too much to be this small! I cannot get over just how SMALL it is. When viewed from the side, it looks even smaller! It is about half the size of the pendent that holds the stone. It may as well be FLAT. smh"
3.0,Correct size but to tight. All my other night shirts fit perfectly.
3.0,tie broke before 1st use
3.0,I loved this dress. At first.  I wasn't crazy about the pocket placement but it was ok. Pretty soon though the material looked washed out in places. Like soap was not rinsed out completely.  Tried everything.  Took it of the washer today and multiple small holes in the fabric.  I had hoped this would last longer  because overall it would have been great for working at home for comfort or dressing up for dinner out.
3.0,I ordered two dresses one of them the bottom of the dress has holes and looks bad :( the other dress is perfect though... Runs a little big
3.0,I really like the print and the colors. The small is a bit big around the armpits but it's not too bad. I'll keep it! 😀 Thank you for the free returns. It helps a lot when exchanging for sizes!
3.0,The necklace and charm are delicate and very beautiful! The color is pretty. Unfortunately the necklace broke the first day it was worn.
3.0,The colors are great. They also stayed in for long periods of time with little issue. The only problem is that the top and bottoms balls both can unscrew from the bar. You have to be sure to re-tighten both balls every week or so to avoid losing it.
3.0,"Came with a rip in the seam so I returned it. I also bought way oversized so it would be flowy...it fit of course but it wasn't flowy like I wanted, it was more fitted. I'm disappointed because I really love the colorblock and style of this dress."
3.0,"I'm not going to lie, I was disappointed when these arrived. I love the gold and the great quality of these earrings, but they are just not as big as I had hoped they would be. I like the smallest pair  and the largest pair is okay...just not nearly as big as I wanted. The other 2 pairs that run in-between those two sizes are almost identical in size. There really isn't much variety in this set. At least I never have to worry about smaller sized hoops now. I'll be shopping for a bigger pair of earrings soon.<br /><br />I've included a picture of me wearing the largest hoops and the smallest that were included!"
3.0,We received no card explaining the bracelet. I wouldnt care if it was for me but it's a gift for someone  and now I'll have to explain it to her.
3.0,"Fits true to size. I sized up based on reviews and had to exchange for my regular size. Thin material, but I expected that for the price. Looks great with a slip. The top is soft and stretchy, but the bottom is stiff, which I appreciate since I hate clingy skirts."
3.0,Wasn't quite like the picture and material was weird
3.0,"Very thin sweater, very soft, but had to go back, the thinness would have made pills instantly"
3.0,Looks great easy to adjust size.
3.0,"Smaller in size than expected, however very nice and happy with the item."
3.0,"I ended up returning the suit. It fit well in the chest and butt area but the tummy control is SUPER tight. I had to shimmy to get it on due to how tight the tummy control was. Once it was on, it looked good but I didn't want to have to struggle to get it on every time I wore a suit so i decided to return it."
3.0,The material is very nice but did not fit. Was small across the shoulders and bust and too short. Would order again in a bigger size if it was longer.
3.0,It's been about a week with my wife wearing these and they are a challenge to get on. The front of the slipper should have been open more. The front makes contact with her instep making it challenging to get her heel in. I also bought her one size up so I was a little surprised.
3.0,I really liked this but I only had them for a week  and the balls  fell apart into pieces
3.0,Poor zipper construction
3.0,XL Fits like a large at most.
3.0,"Fits all around, but the model in the picture makes the dress appear to have a shine which it does not. It is baby pink"
3.0,Solid and no nonsense stretcher.
3.0,"The print quality was good and the fit was nice, but the fabric was awful. The sleeves were nice and soft but the body of the shirt was a different cotton and felt awful. Very stiff and scratchy. Returned."
3.0,I really like this loop band but I’m in Apple size 9 the medium is too small and large is too large.
3.0,"i had high hopes for this ring set since it looks so cool but it’s such a letdown. for a day it looks perfectly fine, but after that the chain broke and it just looked weird. the ring quality itself was also pretty cheap. i guess you get what you buy with the price but still it’s not very good, it looks cool from a far though!"
3.0,"Really cute, wish I could have fit in it."
3.0,a little small but great quality
3.0,I previously bought a similar style jumper from a boutique. I expected the same fit. However it fit a little tighter than the boutique jumper which made it look less stylish.
3.0,"Strap is good but was not the right size, so i had to return it. Its a good quality one"
3.0,"It’s alright. The coloring on Sandy is a bit weird, and Spongebob has a unibrow. My kid won’t care but it’s annoying. They’re stocking stuffers so I can’t say if they fit well into crocs yet. If they don’t, I’ll be back to update."
3.0,Bought this for a Christmas gift exchange for my daughters friend. She loves elephants. She put it on and the rings you hook the clasp to immediately broke.
3.0,The masks are exactly as they looked in the picture but after I got them I decided they was too much gap at the top and also not enough coverage.  I'm trying to decide if I could put a bit of fabric on the top to make them usable.
3.0,I love these. The only thing is 2 out of the 3 don’t fit properly. My white and blue ones have one earring each that are bigger so I look a bit lopsided in the earring area.<br />Still like them and for the price I am not surprised that this is the way they are.<br />See pictures to see the difference in size
3.0,Too short.  I’m 6 2 and 2 inches too short
3.0,An ok dress. Could have been worse. The pockets definitely do not lay flat and hit right at the hips. Not sure who wants bulky looking pockets right at your hips. Returning.
3.0,I think some body return this bag because I found lipstick in the bag.
3.0,"Loses time, even when properly wound up daily. I was losing about 15 minutes by midday when I would set it and wind again. I don't mind 5 minutes or so over a whole day, but that was too much. I returned it and spent a little more on another one that keeps perfect time through the day.<br /><br />The watch was attractive and the face easy to read. The quality was good-- didn't feel like it would fall apart or anything. It would make a great costume piece for steampunk activities, but it's not reliable for every day wear."
3.0,I ordered this clutch purse thinking that it would durable. The chain is very fragile because of this I am deterred from placing certain items inside of the purse but overall it is a pretty purse.
3.0,"Have to return, didn’t know they’d fit me like booty shorts"
3.0,The waist was way too high so I had to return it.
3.0,"Decent quality for the price, but I would say size down.  The bottom half the of the dress is very billowy and unflattering if it's not the right sizing.  I normally am between a M and L and I would say move to the smaller size if you're between."
3.0,"Loved the dress/top but it certainly was not pink,more of a salmon or orange."
3.0,Disappointed in the trim or finish work around the armholes. It is a mere binding tape and not the same material as the vest itself. Makes the vest look really cheap.
3.0,Not please
3.0,"It's not pink,  guess I should have read closer"
3.0,Not awesome quality but for the price it was great. Probably won’t ever use it again as the cheap plastic battery case broke. It still works<br /><br />Still recommend… I paid for what I got.
3.0,"Very soft fabric and comfortable to wear.  However, the length was much shorter that I had anticipated based on the picture provided.  I have only worn it once so waiting to see how well it washes."
3.0,"I get a blister on my heel any time I wear these with anything but wool socks!  My last pair were my favorite shoes, these not so much."
3.0,The quality of the fabric was less than expected
3.0,Too tight on face . No room . Extremely hard to converse in without it going in your mouth.
3.0,"the product was good quality, but this is not sizing for USA, i purshased anXXL and its was more of a size medium"
3.0,Uality not as hog on this items.
3.0,"Very thin and come up high on ankle, very obvious your wearing them."
3.0,"Well made,roomy, just what I was looking for,EXCEPT for the noxious chemical odor. Regretably I had to return it."
3.0,"I am 5'0 and about 125 lb. This is just slightly too long and it doesn't have much shape. It would probably be perfect on someone who is 5'5."" The material is kind of a cheapy polyester that reminds me of cheap childrens costume material. I'd probably still keep it if it fit a little better. Pay attention to return shipping policies."
3.0,The top fits awkward. But it's cute.
3.0,"I ordered an extra large, the cup is too small so its very revealing, its pretty sexy if that's the look you are going for."
3.0,Sides of my ring are sharp and constantly scratch the sides of the adjacent fingers. It's pretty but uncomfortable.
3.0,Love the whole dress but the next size up will be totally too big
3.0,"Dress is nice quality, good material, nicely made. I bought Brown/ coffee in L with long sleeves. Color and design are good, but it's little bit strange fit. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds, 36DD. Length is long,but I like it that way,I can ware it with flip flops or sandals, no need for heels if the dress doesn't streach later and become longer.Fit is loose, comfortable, but in middle section unfortunately showing imperfections and clinging to unwanted parts.The decolte is very big,deep down,still sexy,but if streach little bit more downward will become a concern.Changing the bra shape helps to achieve better fit in chest department, not too showing.Pockets are very unflattering in my case,positioning at widest hip area of mine.I think M will fit me better with siluet concern, but will be too tight in middle section, so I will keep L.<br />Sleeves are roomy, not tight, comfortable, long.<br />Overall not bad, not perfect, will keep it. Very cute with similar color hat I have with animal print collar. I think that I can pull onother look with booties and crop short brownish neutral leather jacket for different season.Disapointed because it's wrinkle when you sit and even it's loose fit still cling in my middle section. Will be more flattering with light shaper under."
3.0,"good earnings, quality good!"
3.0,good price - several duplicates in the pattern but that doesn't really matter. seemed to be sized a bit larger than I was expecting.
3.0,"Came nicely packaged , my gold diamond was not attached to the earring so that was a bit disappointing. And they feel super plasticky/cheaply made. So I guess it's good for the price."
3.0,This shirt rides up as I practice Yoga
3.0,"Warm, but too bulky. My husband doesn't like them."
3.0,"I normally wear a medium but got these in a small.<br />I’m glad I did. The small fits me as I would expect a medium to fit.<br />There is a long logo “due east” printed on the side of the pants that measures about 5” long. It’s a little obnoxious and a little hard to read because of the font.<br />The print is fun and tropical.<br />There are a lot of seams in these pants!!<br />The seams on the knees are a little uncomfortable.  It continues to the back is the knee which is uncomfortable when doing weighted dirty dogs or leg raises.<br />The seams in the crotch area are a little unflattering- it is nice that these don’t have a center seam in the front, just in the back - the shine of the fabrics just don’t seem to match up for some reason.<br />The waist of these pants hit just below the belly button - I wouldn’t consider these to be high rise - maybe mid rise.<br />I feel like my butt looks good in these, the material is fairly soft and these pants are squat proof.<br />The hem of these pant legs hit me at the top of my ankle - I’m 5’5”."
3.0,I loved it but after some use the clasps wouldn't close good so my things fell out easily. Love the idea but not long lasting. Hopefully mine was just defective because I love the size and design.
3.0,These were much much smaller than expected
3.0,I ordered 3x and it fits like 1x.
3.0,a bit too small for what I normally wear
3.0,"I wanted to have a backup suit, you know, just in case. I saw this on Amazon and figured it was worth a try. Unfortunately, the largest size was a little too small to be comfortable. It's fairly thin fabric, so I wouldn't recommend this other than as a backup, not for regular heavy usage. I liked the look and feel and wish I could have kept it. At a distance(as in music performances, because I'm a musician) it would work fine. I wouldn't wear it to a party where someone can get up close. The only thing that would work would be to wear a really nice shirt and tie to draw the eyes away from the jacket itself."
3.0,Nice but run a little large
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for this is not stainless steel it doesn't even feel like metal it feels cheap like plastic with silver metallic paint. It's okay for just costume jewelry not to wear everyday. I'm slightly disappointed.
3.0,"Not the best quality, but it was cheap!"
3.0,"Love the image. Silky smooth, but very thin. Great use for decorative over back of couch."
3.0,Pretty but fabric cheap and to tight across my chest
3.0,"I like the print, looks good, will maybe last 2 seasons of light use or 1 of heavy. The material is starting to pull away from the seams and the white can be a little too see though when wet so my guy wore a layer underneath."
3.0,A nice set...but top was too see thru
3.0,"I honestly wish I could review the ears separately. I absolutely love these ears. They are lace, they are super comfortable, and super elegant looking. I usually can't wear headbands because they hurt my head. But this doesn't dig into my head. I wore this to a ""masquerade"" Themed concert back in May. I had planned on wearing the mask, but honestly the mask is terrifying. I had bought it some time in advance so I could make sure it was here in time, and it ended up being past the return time so I just threw it away."
3.0,Tried on my 16 month old to avoid a haircut. It’s too tight.
3.0,"This is our third pair of EnzoDate frames. We really like these, but didnt receive the adjustable band, which is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. I have emailed them and still no response."
3.0,"This is a cute dress BUT the arms are too small (tight)...and the material isn't that nice stretchy material, its itchy...if I could get this dress in rayon/spandex  I would buy it in every color!  I'm 5'3&#34; and weight 150# and ordered a medium"
3.0,smaller than I expected.
3.0,Tooo small for my fat face
3.0,Sword does not fit in scabbard and paint comes at nothing. Not just blunt contact but near swipes
3.0,It's good but there was a hole in the seam. It is just a little something for my daughter's kindergarten graduation.
3.0,I bought this and another one (different color) for my girlfriend and myself. I've had them about 3 weeks now and really no complaints. They came exactly as described and are holding hippo to daily wear well. I AM slightly concerned about the elastic string on mine however. For some reason I can just picture it snapping in a month or two from all the daily wear and tear but what're you gonna do?! A good hemp string or something like that seems like the only way to insure the integrity of the bracelet but otherwise I'm pleased with my purchase (s)
3.0,It’s a nice top but it wasn’t for me. Material was a bit slippery just not my style.
3.0,Quality is ok but you get what you pay for. It would be good for a costume.
3.0,Was a little small and pocket closing was Velcro which I don’t like Velcro the fabric wasn’t quite as soft as I expected  I will still  wear them but I was hoping to buy more but I am not going to buy more for the reasons listed
3.0,"Item did NOT come in bag like description, granted either way I'm sure one would want to gift them in something other than a bag. These are TINY images. Not the best look on a guy, just fyi. They're small enough they might as well even be children's earrings. Metal and definition of the image is sub par."
3.0,They a great looking earrings just wish they were both avocados 🥑 I get lots of compliments with the 🥑 one.
3.0,The color and the pattern makes you look bigger and rounder.
3.0,"Like some other reviewers, I agree that it's too tight around the hips.  It's not cut properly unless you're straight shaped.  I don't really consider myself to have hips or a butt, but this top accentuates those in a bad way.  The cowl is very cute and the quality is nice, but this leftover mama-belly ain't working this thing."
3.0,I bought this bag a month ago and the four bottom corners are fraying!<br />I contacted the repair division almost a week ago and still no answer.<br />Very disappointed!
3.0,Not what I was expecting. The ring will stay in place but anything you handle will get caught up in the ring sizer material.
3.0,"I bought this for my husband, he is the wolverine for halloween this year.  I like it, but the chain is way to short.  This may work better for a child or teenager.  It just is not the correct length for a dogtag."
3.0,My daughter found the size 1 to be to snug.  She's a size 1 in all other shoes.
3.0,"Nice glasses, BUT the quality of the optics is not very good.  When driving I have to pull them off to see road signs at a distance. I'd pay 3X the price to have the same with prescription quality optics."
3.0,The material is great but I wish they had a different waist band...the elastic is uncomfortable and also wish they had pockets on the butt...at least look like pockets
3.0,"For the money, this is a good buy. However, the speaker cover started peeling up after less than a week of use."
3.0,I love how thick the material is.  Just needs to be a little bigger.
3.0,Not what i spect
3.0,Had a tear in the sleeve so returned it and ordering a new one. Great quality other than the rip.
3.0,"Too big and also squeaky. I would say a full size too large. I ordered two pairs, one for each of my kids and both made a loud squeaking noise when they walked."
3.0,"The two rings with the chain attached were too small for any of my fingers, and I have very small hands so I don't think they'd fit on most people."
3.0,"The gold looked a tad bit fake. (I know that it is not real) but compared to some plated jewelry I have purchased, I have had better quality and look for the same price."
3.0,Definitely meant for someone shorter
3.0,The dress fit so well. I am 5'3 and 180lbs and bought a XL. Fit perfectly but the white dress was see through. I'm sure the other colors would look awesome!
3.0,This item wasnt what it appeared to be. Its no where close to oversize. It seems to also be more feminine that uni sex
3.0,"This shirt was okay. I wanted an oversized super soft t shirt for sleeping. This shirt's fabric is like a regular t-shirt ... not a soft one, at that. It fits a little tailored to a man's body; not oversized or loose. So I still wear it to bed (couid not pawn it off on boyfriend). But it's not what I wanted or expected from the description re: soft."
3.0,Super cute but they aren't well made.
3.0,"basic white sweatshirt- fine, although I have not seen what happens after it is washed yet"
3.0,As far as feeling and everything they're a great pair of shorts I thought they were nice unfortunately even though I went three sizes larger than what I usually wear they were still too small like I could put them on but they were not comfortable because they were too tight.
3.0,I like the shirt but it had buttons at the top so I thought I could unbutton a couple of them but they were just for looks. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"Loved this dress, but had to return. Because it runs really small. I usually wear an XL, So I ordered an XXL.  Still to small. 😥"
3.0,Pretty bit the size Lg was as a small
3.0,"The shirt fabric is thick, soft and colors vibrant. However, if you have a large chest like myself do not order your regular size. I normally wear a size medium to large however in this shirt I need  XL-1X. Very pretty too just too small for my girls."
3.0,Great quality.  Runs big though.
3.0,Returned.  Not a good fit for me.
3.0,"These say Made in Sri Lanka. The previous ones I bought said Made in China. Apparently China has better elastic sources; they fit more comfortably. Sri Lankan elastic is a little more loosey-goosey. And what kind of ego must Ralph have, to say &#34;Make my name BIGGER on the waistband&#34;? It was smaller in China. I'll leave it to you to determine the politics of the situation.<br /><br />UPDATE: Six months later, I can report the Sri Lanka fabric wears out sooner, separating and ripping from the elastic waistband. Ralph, are you listening? Your quality control is in need of attention! You should hire that old lady from the Hanes commercials who used to say &#34;It doesn't say Hanes until I say it says Hanes.&#34;"
3.0,"These glasses are very stylish and hip. Mostly just fun to wear. The pink and yellow are definitely eye catching. You will undoubtedly get looks wearing these. My wife is stunning and already garners numerous ogles from men and women. These sunglasses definitely up the number of times I see people checking her out.<br />The problem is that the ones we received arrived without one of the nose pads. Surprising because there is actually a small screw that goes through the nose arm and is supposed to hold the pad. Our pair had neither the pad or the screw. Fortunately, I was able to find another pad and screw from an old pair of sunglasses and make the glasses useable."
3.0,"Fine, but the plastic started to tear while I was inserting wallets the first time--and  was very careful."
3.0,"I gave 3 stars only because the one pair of the earrings only lasted 3days because the hook came off. Overall I really like these pairs, that it looks like I am wearing multiple earrings."
3.0,Was hoping for a lighter weight boot. Comfort is good.
3.0,"Very nice. They feel the way a pair of driving gloves should feel. They look good. There is nothing not to like except maybe one little thing. The PRICE. I found a pair of black driving gloves on Amazon that looked nice at less than 1/2 the price. Instead of a snap, it had a Velcro closure. I myself prefer the Velcro even though the snap looks richer, but hey for $30 in savings I can go with being on the cheap side. My girl thinks I'm a cheapskate anyway."
3.0,"They are a tad thick for dressy laces.  I have learned to read for the word waxed.  The color is as pictured, but I could never find a brighter red."
3.0,comfy but too large for the small I ordered.  I am 112 lbs and 5'1
3.0,"Beware, the dress is a bit see-through, so make sure you have the right undergarments. It's also on the longer side. Otherwise, looks great and is fun to wear for Halloween!"
3.0,"The material is thinner than I had hoped, and the shirt itself is rather short and boxy. I thought it looked long and slim fit in the photo which was what I was hoping for so I wasn’t impressed. Not my favorite shirt to wear, fits different than I’d hoped. I’m normally a medium or large and I’d definitely size up."
3.0,"I gave these protective 3 stars because they're made to fit a small woman and no size is indicated. I made them big enough to fit husband by filling a plastic soda bottle with hottest water from tap, pulling sleeve over the bottle and then submersing it all in hot water for 10 minutes. Remove bottle from water with sleeve. Let it dry for at least 24 hours. Remove sleeve. Now it fits his arm just fine!  Now a 5 star product!"
3.0,Nice dress but I listened to the reviews that said size up. Way tooooo big.
3.0,"Chinese made, ok to tell time not a chronograph does not come with any instructions..<br />Just received it and see how it last."
3.0,Inner thigh is wearing out too quickly. Which is too bad since theese are otherwise comfortable pants.
3.0,"While the bra fits perfectly, the bottoms are a bit small on me."
3.0,I expected these to be legit Coach product but they most certainly do not look or feel legit.  Very plastic feeling and doesn't fit well on my face.
3.0,"First I have to say that this was a very well made product.  The only issue I had is that the waist is not for very petite waisted people and the belt is part of the dress and is not adjustable.  For that reason the dress would not work for me.  I think even if I had ordered a small it would not have worked simply because of the nonadjustable belt; however, it was a beautiful dress and again, very well made, heavy material, not flimsy or cheap at all.  I regret having had to return it."
3.0,I wish they were somewhat larger.  The plastic seems a little brittle when putting them on over my regular glasses.
3.0,"When I received the t-shirt, the smell from the print was so strong I had to wash it before giving it to my grandson. After washing it, it lost its shape. I was a little disappointed. But he loved the shirt."
3.0,"These are comfortable but see through, be prepared."
3.0,"Nice ring,  the color was very pale pink.  It almost looks nude in color.  I was hoping it looked more like the pink stone pictured."
3.0,Great workmanship. Unfortunately the tie has a strong musty/mildew odor that seller must have been aware of prior to shipping.  Noticeable across the room. Husband would like to wear soon. Trying to neutralize odor.
3.0,"The fabric is really nice, but.....too long!  I'm 5' 7"" and it was almost tunic  length on me.  I got it n 3 different colors, and they were all the same."
3.0,Smaller in size than expected.
3.0,"Delivery was fast.  Dress color is very different in person.  Looks PINK online, but is really more of a mellony pink.  Fabric is OK, not great.  It's OK overall -- cheap price, OK dress when U need a dress quickly."
3.0,"Bows are cute and good quality, but the headband is too big for my one month old. Tried them on a friends 6 week old and it was too loose on her too."
3.0,"Ran small, very thin material—I thought it would be more like a t-shirt.  I only bought these for working from home, but the fit makes me too uncomfortable to go out running errands"
3.0,"This is not a compression shirt, at all. Even if the product had fit appropriately (it was probably a size too large), it's rather flimsy so it wouldn't have provided any kind of compression. It's essentially just an athletic tank top, nothing more. It is comfortable, at least, but if you're looking for a tank top that provides any compression this isn't it. Fit wise I'm 5'6"" 135lb, a small was too large for me. Not even snug at all."
3.0,It is nothing like the pictures. I was expecting an off the shoulder shirt maybe made out of some fabric like cotton. I received the item a lot faster than expected but was slightly disappointed over all. Cute enough to keep but not what I was expecting.
3.0,The design looked fine but I had to rate it lower as when it was washed it shrunk fairly significantly =(
3.0,Broke an eyelet while syncing. It shapes the body nice. However it is plastic boning. the only steel is the front closure.
3.0,"the case does not shut all the way i've tried to adjust the sunglasses in every way possible, but it still does not close all of the way. also, i took the sunglasses out of the case and just tried to see if the case would close with nothing in it and it doesn't clsoe all of the way.  that is my only problem with these otherwise the sunglasses ROCK!!! they fit nicely they are not too big and not too small!!"
3.0,"Nice material, but it is somewhat small and see through."
3.0,"I ordered an XL and they’re still way too tight, I had to cut them to go over my ankles"
3.0,"Wore for Disney cruise, fit well"
3.0,This shirt is just odd-fitting. Looks close enough to the picture but the material is strange and the pocket is crooked and sits oddly on the shirt. Not flattering at all. Didn't wear it once. Guess that's what I get for shopping for clothes on Amazon!
3.0,"Disappointed as the frame arrived in a small plastic bag, not in a case as exoected. Otherwise, ok frame for the price."
3.0,"The black parts fell out as soon as I took them out of the package. Don't buy.<br /><br />Edit: included a photo of cufflinks to show how they fell out, in response to the customer service representative comment below. Basically, they look like there wasn't any glue at all. They fell out as soon as I took them out of the packaging.<br /><br />Edit #2: the manufacturer sent me a second set of these. The black parts on my second set didn't fall out."
3.0,Nice and got a size medium
3.0,"Fabric is itchy and not so nice, fit was clingy on this one... It was too warm for me, but looked and felt more breathable on my sis, who is a size smaller. Looked cute on her, but I thought it was uncomfortable."
3.0,"Much bigger than expected, and I have large eyes."
3.0,"Got holes in them after only a few times wearing! Not the best made, but pretty good for the price."
3.0,You are only getting one pack of five stickers not a carton as shown in the product image.
3.0,"The print quality of this mask is great and I love that you can see out of it, however to mask is oversized and way bigger than an adult head. My other complaint with it is due to it being flat, when you put it on your nose either makes the mask point up or down making it impossible to see out of. I bought this to be Freddie Mercury at a birthday party and will probably just bend it a little to resolve the problems. Overall t looks great, I just wish it was curved to fit and more the size of an overage head"
3.0,It fits great and you can't feel the clasp in the piercing. Sizing was great as well but after 2 weeks it started irritating my piercing. I've had my nose pierced for 20 years and surgical steel jewelry from the piercing place never bothered it.
3.0,ok.  not really what i would use for a crochet scarf.
3.0,"The hoodie fit me just right, so I kind of figured it would not fit the same when I washed it.  The sleeves had shrunk a little and I tried stretching them out to see if that would help, which it did.....although it was not enough.  It's okay for me to wear around the house but that's about it."
3.0,Way too big so returned it. Shockingly large.
3.0,Clingy material.
3.0,Nice item but incredibly light. Largest chain is only 75g. It almost feels plastic… ordered another brand and the same size chain was twice the weight.
3.0,"It's ok.  Plastic, but what can you expect.  The old adage....you get what you pay for.  Yep."
3.0,The ankle and band at the top are pretty tight and don't have much stretch.
3.0,Runs very large.  Cheap material.
3.0,Ran too small but I kept anyways hoping to loose some weight for a better fit!
3.0,"This outfit is super cute and decent quality but the large was... well, not that large.  I'm only 5'2&#34; and it was waaaay too short to wear, even with the included 'shorts'.  Also, it showed a TON of cleavage.  Not exactly the outfit to match my son's astronaut costume... even with tights, it was way too risque.  The antennae also didn't stick up on my head... which was a bummer since it was so cute.<br /><br />If you get it, you must get the white wig... looks so much more alien!<br /><br />All-in-all, it was ok for a day or two but I probably wouldn't reorder it."
3.0,good luck finding tear offs for these...
3.0,Picture of necklace looks more fuller conpared to what was sent
3.0,I like the shirt itself however the material is very rough.  I thought it would be a lot softer than what it is.  Would have been 5 stars if not for the material.
3.0,Big scratches from the first trip. Flimsy feel.
3.0,Constantly tangles!
3.0,"Let's start with the positives:  Shipping was fast!  And the size of the kimono is great and fits loosely, just as I expected.  I normally wear a L / XL and purchased the Large.  It fits perfectly and feels light.  The fringe is a cute accent to the kimono.  And the sleeve length is just beyond 3/4.<br /><br />Negatives:  I ordered the Black Floral and it is NOT black!  It's more like a dark, midnight blue.  As someone who's favorite color is black, I was really upset by this to begin.  Next negative:  The fabric.  It is NOT chiffon, which is known to be soft and smooth.  It's a hard, dry fabric that feels cheap on your skin.  I imagine it might feel nice during the hotter months, but we shall see.  I personally don't care for hard, cheap fabric.<br /><br />Really disappointed in this purchase.  I do not recommend purchasing if color and fabric are important to you."
3.0,Not as warm as they claim.
3.0,"Love the colors,  but they have a slipperness and have to be retied often"
3.0,"The material has no stretch. It’s cute,but it’s gonna suck in your bottom rather than make it look more plump with a jiggle."
3.0,Very cute but they shed quite a bit on my carpet.
3.0,"The bra itself is nice, but it doesn't stay up well as a strapless and doesn't have much push up at all."
3.0,its pretty sheer but overall it's okay
3.0,"The fit is just right. Material is thin; but, great for warmer weather."
3.0,You get what you pay for. They do the job but they are not a super good quality shoe.
3.0,"Because the seller offers one size, I won’t be wearing it. I will see if another family member can wear it."
3.0,This is truly a very nice jacket. It's extremely soft and warm. The downside to it is that the inner lining has zero give to it making it feel too tight though because the outer shell does give it doesn't look tight. It all comes down to that inner lining not having any give to it. It that would be addressed and changed this jacket would be perfect. I am really tossed about keeping it for that one negative reason. For the cost it would be worth it if it were not for the inner lining. The 3 star rating is due to the inner lining having no give at all. (what is the purpose of the zipper being all the way around the whole jacket???)
3.0,"I bought this bracelet to wear around my ankle since I can't wear visible jewelry at work. The colors are true to what's pictured, and the bracelet is soft, not scratchy or hard at all. If tied tightly, the circumference of the bracelet is 8&#34; so it might be too loose if your wrist is thin. The bracelet comes already tied in a substantial knot, and it was pretty difficult and took some doing to untie it so I could get it around my ankle.  I'm not sure how long it will last since I won't be taking it off to shower. We'll see."
3.0,"This top was cute and fit in all the right places except for the arms. I’m a thicker girl, and the sleeves were so oddly large it looked weird on me... so I returned."
3.0,Arrived on time as promised. Quality was good and we are happy with our purchase.
3.0,"Picture is of an American Eagle size 10 next to Harbeth size M. A medium is more like an XL, in my opinion and definitely closer to a 12 than a 8/9. I normally wear a 10 or Lg, and ordered 1 size down to a Medium and they are way too big! It looks like the shape/style will fit good if I can get a smaller size. Of course the Medium I was $10+ cheaper than the Small, and they currently only have the black and grey colors in S and XS. I was really hoping to order a traditional denim color if these fit well. 🤞they come back in stock eventually."
3.0,"These run very small and sadly I can not wear them.  I normally wear around a medium, but these run smaller than I like and are not comfortable.  I would recommend sizing up and these would be much better."
3.0,These are very well made boots.  I sent them back because they were too large . Seems the size is off a bit.
3.0,"This was bought as a Halloween costume and for the most part it worked. However, the eye holes were not cut and stitched correctly. So it made it difficult to see. The product came folded and vacuum sealed and was slightly damaged. In an attempt to remove the wrinkles we ran it in the dryer on low heat. That helped but it definitely was not anywhere close to the picture advertised. Not a bad price point, but not worth the purchase."
3.0,This dress was terrible. The material was almost pj like and it was HUGE
3.0,"Loved the shirt, good quality material. Hugely disappointed that the size 3X I ordered for my husband fit more like a 2X, or even slightly smaller than that."
3.0,"I was looking for a non-plastic band for my Fitbit so I ordered these. They're alright, if that's what you're looking for, but in the end I don't think it's what I want. The fabric was really lightweight verging on feeling cheap.<br /><br />I can't say they're not worth trying, they just weren't for me."
3.0,I got a lot of compliments on this. Downside is that it sheds like CRAZY! I was COMPLETELY covered in fuzzy's.
3.0,"Es demasiado pequeño, no queda holgado, como lo muestran en las imágenes"
3.0,hard to see hands and one of the hour markers fell off dont know where it is hope it dosent jam the watch.
3.0,Quality is great but it really does ride too high in the crotch area. I'm only 5'5&#34; and its hard to wear this without something like a tank underneath otherwise my boobs( I'm a small c cup)almost pop out.
3.0,Asian sizes but will stretch to accommodate any size butt.
3.0,"Thought I would try this out, since they offered me a free shirt.  The fit was fine, but the shirt was supposed to be Crimson red.  However, you can see from the picture it is more of tangerine color."
3.0,While it is a great robe; after less than a year of having it; with minimal use (only for getting in and out of the hot tub); the pocket is coming away from the robe and is falling apart. I have fixed it; but it just stinks that I should even have to fix it.
3.0,Too stiff.  Difficult to put on and off.  Not comfortable.
3.0,Love them at first. This is the first time she’s wearing them. After washing them they in cold water shrunk and became very linty. Maybe try washing them<br />And letting them air dry
3.0,RUNS VERY SMALL BUT GOOD QUALITY
3.0,"It rode up a bit.  I had to keep pulling it down, which was annoying."
3.0,This was  too small. No stretch. I suggest going up a size.
3.0,"They are very comfortable but the size was too small. I felt like I was in a children's large. Love the style,  they don't fit right"
3.0,They look nice but are hard to put in and caused an allergic reaction to my ear. These pulled up when I searched surgical steel which I normally can wear. One of the hoops broke when I tried to open it so I can't return them.
3.0,Was difficult to put in place too  flimsy
3.0,The buttons are on the wrong side for a men’s item
3.0,It’s cute but I thought It would be more fitted. It’s more like a swing dress. That’s what it should be listed as. Liked the longer length too.
3.0,I love the looks of it but it’s not big enough it needed one more Extension bit other then that it’s pretty
3.0,"I didn't want to pony up for trifocals now that I am retired, but I also don't want to lose my glasses. I decided it was time to do the old lady thing and get the chain. Several other glasses chains feature a clip for each side, which would be both uncomfortable and unattractive, in addition to probably wearing out sooner or later and snapping off. I went with this chain because of the slip-knot type of fastener, and because my face looks better with gold than with silver.<br /><br />So it's all right, but one side constantly comes loose. I adjust it tighter; it comes loose again anyway.<br /><br />If both sides were to do this, my glasses would likely fall off and break and I would be really bitter about having bought this product. However, one good firm gripper is enough to keep them from hitting the floor, and so when I see one side is loose--which occurs probably every other day--I secure it again. I suppose I could just superglue it on, but I don't always want the chain, so I'd be reluctant to do that.<br /><br />In the end, I will continue to use this chain, for now, at least, but I am not sure I recommend it to you."
3.0,"Loved the design, length and everything, but it broke the first time I wore it."
3.0,Fits as expected but the color was not as shown in the picture. I ordered a neon pink and they sent a blush pink.
3.0,Not sure if I would. Order on line again.
3.0,Look very different from the picture
3.0,"It's cute, but a bit too large.  I am 5'5&#34;, about 115 pounds, and ordered the small.  I'm not sure I will wear it because it's too baggy on the top and isn't entirely flattering."
3.0,They were smaller than I thought they were going to be but they were still cute luckly I have a second hole and used it for that
3.0,"Nice socks for the price, I would have liked them to not be so tight. Maybe a larger size would have fit better, I'm am a size 10 which is the largest it fits up to which probably is what makes it feel tight. For someone else it may be OK."
3.0,"Wallet was darker than expected, but it is very well made."
3.0,Very soft but bulky and not flattering at all
3.0,"Holy snags! This sweater arrived with some huge snags already in the fabric. I pulled them through to the inside so they don’t show. The blue color is pretty and since it’s 100% polyester it has a nice sheen, but it’s not nearly as oversized and slouchy as I would have liked. Not bad, but not great either, fairly mediocre."
3.0,"Lovely cut at the neckline, but I wouldn't recommend for anyone who has a butt... there isn't enough shape or structure to this dress to allow a proper fit, so the fabric gaps awkwardly at the low back. Quite a shame because the neckline really was gorgeous."
3.0,"These were cute. However, made very poorly. Had to return still waiting for part of my refund since I used my own label to return. Will update if not resolved."
3.0,Found out after I ordered that silk masks only provide 50% protection....
3.0,There is a reason us women try on all the sunglasses at the store before deciding which ones we like best. They need to compliment your face. I knew these were big from the picture but they are huge in person and I feel silly with them on. I keep em in the car and only use them if I forget the pair I usually wear.
3.0,Didn't fit and drape as aspected.
3.0,"Cute necklace, the mushroom charm is a lot bigger than I anticipated.  I thought it would be about the same size as those glass lampwork mushroom beads that have been on a lot of trendy jewelry lately but this one is big and plastic."
3.0,"Sent to grandkids so not sure how they work but they run extremely huge. In video of kids opening, one said"" dad got some new gloves""!"
3.0,"Difficult to open and close, which makes them hard to put in your ears."
3.0,"The material and workmanship are good but the slots are too narrow for credit cards, drivers license, insurance cards, etc.<br />I ordered brown, the paperwork says brown, but I received a black wallet.<br /><br />I'll keep it and put my cards in sideways but with the overall size of the wallet this should not be necessary.  Even the plastic insert for additional cards will only hold the size of a business card."
3.0,tight around arms. Rest of fit is very nice.
3.0,Works good just a little high price for what it is. I have found lower priced ones for about half the price that seem to work just as well.
3.0,They are nice jeans but to small.
3.0,Did not hold up
3.0,"I bought the taupe pair and loved it so I ordered it in navy. The navy is significantly larger than taupe to the point where taupe is form fitting but navy practically falls off. Very comfortable and nice pants, but inconsistent sizing between colors."
3.0,"Purchase was made to replace an identical pair lost earlier this year. Sadly, one earring lacks some tension leading to the earring not remaining on one ear."
3.0,"The necklace looks more &#34;plastic&#34; than in the picture. But its okay. I bought it to wear with my Halloween costume, so it don't need to look so fancy."
3.0,Needs ironed.
3.0,"Got 3 pairs of these, XL in Olive, Navy, and Black. The black ones are terrible, tight and the elastic constantly rolls and folds in making them very uncomfortable. Do not have this problem with the other colors, so the black seems to run SMALL. Biggest dislike in all 3 pairs is that the elastic band is half the size of the area given for the waistband so it creates a slight bulge between the hem and the elastic. Not a major problem in Olive and Navy but the Black is extra noticeable and floppy."
3.0,It fit a little small  for the size that I ordered.  I would recommend getting a size larger than usual.
3.0,"Ordered this at the same time I ordered a similar suit sold on Amazon called &#34;[[ASIN:B0111TUJ8Q ohyeah Men's Plus Size Underwear On Sale Faux Leather Solid Boxer Briefs Black Size US 12]].&#34;  It took about two weeks to arrive to an address in the South central U.S. from wherever.<br /><br />The quality seems acceptable, but it's not close to the quality of the Majdell Sport version.  Of course it's only 1/3 the price though.  The hem on top is very narrow and there is no lining in the front. In other words, this suit leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.  Viewers will know if your cut or uncut.  I wear size 32&#34; jeans, but I ordered the XL size in these because the key measurement for sizing these suits isn't your waist size, it's the circumference around your hips.  My hips measure 36&#34; around.  Though I ordered the XL size,  the suit still has a &#34;vacuum packed&#34; look when I wear it.<br /><br />I would've given it 4 stars except the design includes an overly large 'pickle sack' in front.  It's a pouch designed to hold your package but it only holds it one way.  Straight out.  No hang to the left or hang to the right with this suit.  Everything is straight out front & center.  It looks like a parrot beak sticking out.  Not the look I wanted but some might want that look.  Hope this review helps someone."
3.0,Don’t get me wrong I like the product. I am thankful to have obtained one. Mine arrived with no scope and a clear place where it used to be. I didn’t bother with a return because broken is better than none.
3.0,Pants run a little small per normal size. Order next size up for waist fit. Boot legs on these are extremely big. Not sure if I have big enough boots and I'm 6'2&#34;.
3.0,"The hat is the perfect size. The brim is also just what I was looking for. It is reversible, with washed denim on one side and tan on the other. The strap to adjust and the straps to secure is perfect.<br /><br />There is only one disappointing thing - the tag is on the denim side, which is the side I would be wearing on the outside. I am not able to cut it off because I would have to remove the seam. If it were sewn on with a logo it wouldn’t look so bad, but it looks like a tag on the inside of a T-Shirt. I regret to have to return this item."
3.0,"Wig looks great in the package, and ok the 1st time you put it on....then it kinda looks like one of the apes from planet of the apes....very awkward to put on.  Fit is good, fits a large head, maybe my hair styling skills are the problem.  Sorry I paid $25 and shipping and cant use it for the play I am in...."
3.0,Ok but not the thickness i would expect.... Thin gloves and hot glued one side of Freddie Fingers...lol
3.0,"I wear an 18-20 and the 16 was too loose!  Otherwise a good quality, cute suit!"
3.0,"Be mindful that you're going to have to make two orders to get a pair of plugs. I missed that this is only one plug for sale and so you have to buy two. Which was kind of disappointing when they showed up as only one and I had to order and wait for the other one. Also they run a little large but if your ears are a little loose then it would be fine. They are beautiful and have a really nice weight to them sadly they broke within a week and a half because they are kind of heavy and it just shattered. But hey those are the brakes, lol"
3.0,"First thing to notice is that this pin is 1 3/4 inches in diameter making is very large compared to standard pins.<br /><br />The detail on the pin is excellent, very nice placed integrate designs/pattern and the paint is very smooth throughout with no abnormalities.<br /><br />There are double posted pins on the backside due to the large size and is very stable when you have it on. It will not flop or twist around when wearing it. Seeing the safely cover protrudes out a bit, it may be uncomfortable if you have a thin shirt or sensitive head (when wearing a hat).<br /><br />The pin is individually laser numbered which is nice, but I personally do not see it as a collector's item that will increase in price overtime.<br /><br />Even though a really high quality pin, the price you pay for is very absurd. $20 is a ridiculous price point, even if at half cost and with most proceeds going to charity. A fair price I say would be around $5, maybe $7 but that's pushing it.<br /><br />I personally would not purchase this at the current full price unless you're unconditionally in love with the design and have money to burn.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review"
3.0,"I was hoping they would be more slim fitting. The waistband is tight, but that is it. They are short which I saw in the picture, but they flare out in a weird way at the bottom. They are a comfortable material. I was hoping ro wear them to work but there is a silver flower on the front of them making them look like workout pants. Material is comfortable."
3.0,Not a very sturdy or supportive shoe- but kind of cute.
3.0,"Fun boots!  Do not know how long they will last as they do not seem to be made that well, but for the price, and fun style they will do."
3.0,"too thick, didn't look good"
3.0,Too large  for me
3.0,I really loved the look and feel of these pants but they are definitely not good for working out. They fell down when I was running and squatting
3.0,Product came very early..I am xl everyday and the shirt was small to fit
3.0,"Nice bag, looks richer in the picture."
3.0,I had to return. The size really runs very small.
3.0,Made in china ugh really.
3.0,Nice cool house for the spring. Not the material quality I hoped for. Elastic at the sleeves won't allow for comfortable wear around your elbow if you prefer shorter sleeves or rolled up. Itchy material for hot summer days.
3.0,The hat doesn't have strings inside to tighten to the needed size.<br />The hat is smashed and doesn't get it's shape after 5 hours out of the bag.
3.0,"They are comfortable but the lens did begin steaming up at the end of my 4 mile run. I was hoping to avoid that, but i do live in South Florida. They did wear better than my other sunglasses. I do wish they came in other colors because these are not a color i would purchase normally."
3.0,Felt next size up would be too big.
3.0,Funny fit.
3.0,Nothing specific I disliked about it. A good skirt
3.0,"I'm 5'1&#34;, 115 lbs, and usually wear an S in spanx, although I found this one to be bigger than my other pairs. I ended up returning it bc it simply wasn't tight enough. (I wear a size 2 in other pants/jeans)"
3.0,"El material es bonito, pensé que era una blusa larga por la foto, pero es una tela para colocarse sobre la ropa"
3.0,This is a beautiful bag. Much smaller than expected.
3.0,"The material is great but it was absolutely too short to wear as a dress. I don’t think ordering a size up would have helped. I just wore jeans under it, still made a cute outfit"
3.0,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife. When she tried it on it seemed a little bit small. She said that it will stretch, and that it will work, but the image of the product must be on a small mannequin head because it looks like the hat is pretty large. I am sure that it is warm, the yarn is thick and the hat has a nice shape, but it really is pretty small."
3.0,I bought this in the white floral and love it. It’s a nice fabric and very flattering. However I bought black in the same size and it’s much smaller. The shirring on the black makes it much tighter whereas the floral is a bit looser and is perfect for me.
3.0,Ordered these and they came in with a heel strap which wasn’t advertised so I ended up having to cut it off cause my kid hates them
3.0,"This dress is so pretty, but the top is very slim. I bought the medium and couldn’t begin to get it secured in a way to wear it in public."
3.0,Workmanship poor<br />Fabric flimsy
3.0,Nice fit and good style but fabric started coming off and sticking to my son's skin.  Probably wont last very long.
3.0,"It fit like a burlap sack. Size down. Could be flattering for a bigger gal. However petite crowd should avoid this. Otherwise, material and craftsmanship were satisfactory."
3.0,the baby version of this dress is super cute but the mommy version makes even a thin person look very large :-( I had to send the mommy version back
3.0,"Sizes is not as showed to the size chart.. if you’re size 10, need to extend your size to 14 coz it’s too long and too tight. Or better order it customize in this way you might get your real fitting. But the dress is so pretty. I love it."
3.0,"This is a pretty loose knit, so it's not as snug as I would have liked.  As such, I imagine they will stretch out eventually. They are warm though."
3.0,"Very very cheap, but what can you expect for the price?"
3.0,"Look very good on picture, but real look is not, however the price is OK."
3.0,Paid $24 here on Amazon then found at Walmart for $10.  Definitely thinner material.
3.0,"It was a little too long for me, but still worked ok."
3.0,"I knew I would enjoy this top and when it arrived it did not disappoint. It got it in the color black so it matches with almost everything in my wardrobe. Jeans, Leather, skirts. You name it, it looked good.<br />The only strife I have is that it seems a bit too much for a top of this type. $21 for a crop top is just too much for me."
3.0,Received the Blue Sweatshirt by Russell made in Honduras.  When I washed the shirt it gave off blue  pieces<br />of material.  It appears this sweatshirt for me is made much better in El Salvador.  Better quality and washing experience.  The collar of this product feels cheap in quality.  I have been a Russell fan for a very<br />long time. Pretty hard to find good products.  Please see if you can do El Salvador in the future.<br />This product came from Arizona.<br />Thank you<br />Judith B. Basch
3.0,The pattern of the dress is nice. I ordered a small and found the fit to still be a little big. I generally wear a medium. The pockets are cute and this is what sold me to buy the dress.
3.0,"I got this thing it was a lot smaller then I anticipated but, hey you get what you pay for its not all bad i gave it to my sister girls love little dainty jewelry"
3.0,Like the shirt but it’s not the same as the one pictured. It is a Gildan T-shirt with iron on letters
3.0,"I so wanted this to work out! It definitely didn't look as good on me as it does on the model. I am 5 feet tall and weigh around 110 lbs.  I ordered a small. It hung on me like a potato sack and beneath my waist it poked out on each side. It was if the seams on the dress were sewn too tightly and it didn't fall or flow correctly. My second issue was the fabric. It was very thin. My husband commented on it when he saw me trying it on. I tried a nude camisole slip dress underneath it. They always work wonders when I'm wearing something sheer. Nope. Didn't work. I neatly folded it and packed it back up for a return. The price was too good to be true. Which is usually the case with my clothing purchases on Amazon. I love shopping on Amazon and I buy quite a bit on here but unless you're buying designer, clothing is hit or miss. For me, mostly miss."
3.0,"If the gloves are for a one time use, they will work. However after several wears the hem comes loose. If you were wondering, the 17"" gloves comes up just a little over the elbow. The 19 inch glove should come up well past your elbow. With these gloves you have to constantly have to pull up the gloves because they slide below your elbow. I would suggest manufacturer put some some sort of stick tape or elastic to prevent them from sliding down.  the ones pictured are the 19 inch gloves."
3.0,"A bit pricy for flip flops but very non-skid. Reasonably comfortable for short walks to the shower and back. Dries easiy under the hand drier.  One issue might be the very textured top surface, which makes them hard to dry  with just a paper or cloth towel. You really need a blower to ge them really dry--an issue with fungal stuff at the gym."
3.0,Sharp and uncommon look for a skeleton watch. Bought it as a Christmas gift and was not disappointed when it arrived.  I will update the review after i get some feedback from the recipient.
3.0,"Really nice design on the belt buckle. It clicks smooth and stays in place, I just wish the belt itself was more durable as it has started to rip in multiple places after only a month. Love the color."
3.0,"Cute shirt, but the fit is smaller than expected."
3.0,The dress is beautiful I ordered it for a wedding but I receive it and it was like an 3x but it’s an extra large I guess it just runs big but I wasn’t able to wear it due to the size I looked like a big balloon lol but the dress is nice and I will order another just maybe a medium or small
3.0,The product is very slim. It has sufficient card pockets on both sides.  The zip area is really too small/too tight (once your cards are loaded) to be able to hold coins (or a combo of coins and paper money).
3.0,"Be sure to get your exact size or this will fit like a potato sack. I got the size I normally wear, so maybe that's just how it is either way. But it's comfy and I'll wear it around the house this summer."
3.0,"I would give these these compression socks a higher score if they were longer, however by the middle of the morning I find myself pulling them back up. I will look for another type that is longer next time."
3.0,The piercings hurt if worn too long with a bra
3.0,"I was dissapointed at first, there were some inperfections but to be expected with the price given. Once I tried it on my 7 month old, fell in love! It looked so cute on her! Runs a tad small these is perfect for babies, not bigger kids."
3.0,"Loved the pastel purple color and pattern. It's very cute. If you tend to carry a lot of things, this bag is alright. I can carry a portable charger, small water bottle, phone, reusable bag, a sandwich, wallet. About 3 weeks into wear for work, the seams are starting to bulge and some string have come undone. If you're on the smaller side, realize this backpack won't hug your back. Meaning you won't be able to adjust the straps all the way, so the backpack would most likely be tugging you down if you carry heavy loads. Zippers are still running smooth. I'm not sure if this would last a couple of years?<br /><br />Update: 8 months later with regular use for work (about 5-6 times a week) the straps are starting to rip and parts where the backpack indents are ripping as well"
3.0,Colors not as vibrant as pictured.  Cut not as flowy as pictured. Sits strangely on chest area.
3.0,"Seller sent the wrong bands, sent 45mm bands instead of 41mm bands.  There's no option to contact the seller, but luckily Amazon is taking returns.  Despite the wrong size, the bands seem to be of lower quality.  Utilizing a flat, chrome hook instead of a curved titanium colored hook.  If you have an ultra watch, the hook will NOT match your watch face."
3.0,"I am not all that sure how i feel about this product. I am between a 3 and a 4 on this. It looks great when i put it on the shoes. Very Glossy in my opinion and looks great. I think it shows the brush strokes a bit more than i would like, but it is not too bad honestly. The issue I have is that it seems to run off very quickly; causing me to have to reapply frequently. The parts that are not rubbed off look great and i am pretty happy with it. It was also very fast and easy to apply. I would recommend it."
3.0,"This dress is paper thin, and just as sheer. Be careful what you wear it with, because even though it isn't clingy, it still leaves nothing to the imagination"
3.0,Is a little uncomfortable.  It's hard to shake/hold hands wearing the ring.  Looks great though.
3.0,"It fits my Pandora bracelet, but looks a bit messy and cheap. I’m keeping it because it’s the only Hello Kitty charm I could find, but I’m disappointed in the craftsmanship."
3.0,"its a little smaller than i expected, but i still wear it. anything in the pockets weighs it down alot"
3.0,"These aren't bad, but not that great.  I don't like the stiffness of the straps (that revert back to smashed flat) or the bottom sole (which is hard plastic) and makes a *thwack* sound when walking, like swim flippers.  They are also slippery.  Both of these should hopefully go away after some break-in.<br /><br />What won't go away is the barely there arch support.  The arch rise is not great and most of it is a hole where the straps are glued to the sole.  The soles leave black scuffs on tile once the initial plasticky coating on the bottom is worn off of the ""traction nubs"".  If I were a nit-picker (I *AM*!), in person, the accent color on only 1 side of each shoe is annoying me, lol.  The accent color also feels like colored masking tape.  The pictures show more curve and structure than these that are just plain straight flat sole- no curves or high and low points or bends.<br /><br />I do appreciate the pliable ribbon that goes between the toes as the cardboard like material of the rest of the strap would be a non-starter."
3.0,Cute design. But it broke within a week sadly. This is the second one Ive bought of this. First one within a few weeks began to have a strong metalic smell that I could smell even when wearing it and it would seep into mt fingers when trying to clasp it aroujd my back
3.0,Good looking but it was to small.
3.0,"THIS IS NOT LAVENDER; IT'S A PALE ROSE.<br />And I shoulda gotten a size down; that's on me.<br />What's not on me is that an inch of seam at bra hooks in the back simply wasn't sewn.<br />I should return it on principle because of the color and the sewing, but it's still pretty and I'd rather fix it than deal with the return (as prompt as they'll be, I'm sure)."
3.0,It fits well but wrinkles and had to be ironed before wearing.
3.0,"Fits a bit weird, maybe too narrow across the chest. Not particularly flattering; doesn't help the stomach."
3.0,"Looks nice. A little difficult to replace, wouldn't stay together tightly. But after working with it for a few minutes it finally stayed together"
3.0,"I'm so sorry the nose of these masks must be very difficult to sew. I am going to try to starch the edge so that it doesn't roll. for the ""fit"" rating, I chose ""too large"" because of this, but size isn't really the problem.<br />Hopefully, I can fix these because they really are beautiful, although may be hot in the summer when I want to be able to protect my neck from uv rays- but I think dampening the cloth might help with that.<br />I must say that overall, the value for the price is definitely there."
3.0,"Still breaking them, so far so good. They are comfortable. Only three stars because my son is still getting used to them."
3.0,"The vest is very boxy. Definitely will not fit my 23lb almost two yr old. Seems ok otherwise, I'll save it for next year."
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, the colors were bright, and made nicely fit great everywhere except for the chest, I’m a curvy girl and it legit rode up over my chest and made a hideous flap, then when I would pull it down it gave me the worst shape ever. Measure your body before buying. Shame on me for not doing so myself."
3.0,"I've been trying my hardest to find a Santa hat that'll fit my fat head.  This is the one that pops us when I search for it.  unfortunately, compared to the other Santa hats that I've collected this one is by far the least plush, the shortest white brim and the smallest ball.  For what I paid for it, it's not worth going to the trouble returning it."
3.0,"I really love this lined flannel shirt, but just as others have written it fits tight across the shoulders.  Sleeve length and total length fit perfect.  Feels warm and cozy.  I am returning because of the tight fit in shoulders."
3.0,I looked at the picture wrong and thought the flower was on the top also but the outside is just black. The quality of material was disappointing. It is a cheap feeling plastic. I used it and it kept the rain off.
3.0,"They are very pretty to look at however, they are very flimsy and sharp. Also, the pearl came out about an hour after I opened the package. I hot glued it back on and continue to wear them"
3.0,Midi ring was not a size 4. Love the thumb ring though.
3.0,"I bought three square scarves in one order, all from different sellers, each with an intriguing design. One, my favorite, in substantial satin; one in low-sheen durable and solid silk (almost comic-book bright, and I miss the silky/satiny shine); and the third (the one with my favorite pattern) in, as it turns out, the cheapest and most transparent low-quality silk. The second one is THIS one. So bright I'm not really sure what I will wear it with... Would have LOVED it if it were printed on dense satin."
3.0,"I love the watch, the look, the color, that it is watch. What I didnt like was I was unable to shorten it to fit my to fit my wrist, that really sucks because now I'm not wearing and I just couldn't wait to get it."
3.0,They are attractive but don’t fit my face well
3.0,These were a lot thinner than I expected. They are also larger than I expected.
3.0,"while I liked the fit, the color is pretty bad - it got really dirty within weeks and the shoes started looking pretty bad. I got them at a different store, and only because it was the only Kanadia they carried (and I could try in person). I don't even run or hike. I wore them to the office and on walks through the subdivision."
3.0,"The quality is great they are a little snug, but I think it could be the pin I. My ankle"
3.0,The style is adorable however it fits quite boxy- oversized but boxy. Otherwise it's great quality
3.0,It's an ok two piece.
3.0,I like this top but it’s thin material. Not as good of material as I’d like but love the style and flow of the top. It hides the muffin top because it’s very loose fitting. I wear an XL OR XXL. I ordered the XXL size and it fit perfect.
3.0,I dont think its real leather<br /><br />But looks cool
3.0,Looks pretty and cute but material not comfortable to wear.
3.0,"I wear an 8-8 1/2 , so wasn’t sure an 7-8 would be too small. Now they are too big. Bummer!"
3.0,Son geniales pero el material es demaciado delgado y simple
3.0,You could not wear these for anything athletic as the liner shorts are completely see through.
3.0,"Liked the shape. Shinier than I like. Was upset the red tie actually ended up being a bright orange. Would give it a 2, but the gray tie is nice."
3.0,"I really like these bracelets and pleased with them, but they are not copper beads.  Copper is not the color of brass!  If they do contain any copper, could it be on the inside of the bead which may be coated with brass?  I don't know, but then they should tell us.  That is my only input, otherwise, nice bracelets."
3.0,"I want to love it, but I don't. I don't regret buying it and I won't return it, but its very eh.<br /><br />Button quality, fabric quality, fit--- all eh.<br /><br />I will wear it once a week as part of my suit rotation for work for 6 months to a year but it won't be my favorite day of the week and I won't buy another."
3.0,Beautiful shirt and quality fabric but size is smaller than expected. Very tight on the torso. Recommend you buy two sizes bigger than your normal size
3.0,"I purchased this in a medium, and found that it fits my frame very well. There is also something very satisfying about having a giant hood to hide in. And i mean giant. Overall though, i wasn't impressed.<br />My complaints: This is not a heather green, or medium green anything. It's dark green. I fought with the seller about it, and they are refusing to update the photos, so see what i have attached. I can't get them to pay for shipping back, even though i felt it was misrepresented, so I kept it and I'm disappointed about it.<br />It's over priced for what you get. This should have cost $22. There are other sellers who have that price. Buy from them.<br />The fabric pills easily, and the embellishments are clearly cheap. The drawstrings also are unravelling and the little shoe lace caps disintegrated in the first wash.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again, and i am really pretty bummed about the color. It also looks goofy it it's not zipped all of the way up."
3.0,I loved the over all look. Except the top part. It’s made for the heavier on 🔝 ladies.
3.0,"Beautiful dress but not a true size.  On their size chart I am size 6 but it came too small, doesn't fit my bust."
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty but if wearing daily, they will change colors within about 2 months. I feel they serve there purpose based on the cost and the style. The opal still stands out but the rose gold plate is now like a copper color.  These are not surgical posts and may cause itching. My daughter's couldn't wear them a full 3 hours."
3.0,The gloves are small and do not conform to the shape of a hand which make them uncomfortable.<br />The bristles are too soft to remove dirt from fruits and/or vegetables.<br />Have not tried them for household cleaning.
3.0,"I'm not sure how well it works, I gave it as a gift for a friend who prefers the button-holder style of tie clip to keep it from blowing in the wind when he gives talks.  Not many of those style out there to be found!"
3.0,These are beautiful excercise leggings/pants. Very well made. Very soft. Love the way they look-they are very sleek and stylish. Just alittle snug.<br />I recieved this item at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.
3.0,My son loves it. However the quality is not the best. For the price it’s ok
3.0,Cheap. Not happy
3.0,Not as nice as I thought. But they are doing the job. Could have bought a better pair at home depot
3.0,"Very, very pretty earrings. A little difficult going on, and it hurts after a while, and the dangle is not as bright as the picture shows, but a decent buy for this price."
3.0,"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter to go with her Halloween costume. She is normally a medium but I read all the reviews stating that the sizes ran small so I bought a large. The Large fit her in the shoulders and chest but the arms are SOOOOOO TIGHT, holy moly! The cuffs taper so it is REALLY tight around the wrists but she totally couldn't cross her arms! haha. it worked for the costume but I wouldn't buy from this seller again as the sizes were SUPER inaccurate. No WAY what we got would be considered a &quot;large&quot; in the store."
3.0,...but you buy it anyways.
3.0,"Pants are too big, top is too small.  Ordered xxl<br />Will keep in hopes pants will shrink.  Light weight which is fine for desert."
3.0,Velcro put on sloppy and doesn't work.
3.0,"First time use was fine. However, the rubber on the back lost grip and now they slide off my feet in every use."
3.0,Love the design and weight however it dis colored pretty quickly😧
3.0,"My only complaint is that these kinda look like bottle openers. Other than that, the bat design reminds me of art deco. I also like that the earrings are light & comfortable."
3.0,On time from seller. its a little cheaper looking in person. I was hoping for a higher quality
3.0,"Updated: i just realized the words were printed crooked on the shirt.  Boooooo!  That kind of ruins it for me.<br /><br />High quality, soft, thick material.  All the things you’d want in a shirt.  The screen print is done nicely.  The shirt hangs from the body in a flattering way.  It’s not just a basic tshirt, it’s appears to be more of an expensive classy style.  Very pleased with this shirt!  Fits true to size."
3.0,"Purchased for Kindergartner because the teachers do not want shoes to tie.  They worked but have shown serious wear so cannot be used on the next pair of shoes.  I don't plan to purchase again, but they performed as needed."
3.0,"Not as form fitting as I thought and has to be put on overhead...so, BEFORE makeup...."
3.0,"The edges are little sharp, but it’s a cute color."
3.0,This vest fit fine. It just was not flattering on me. I returned it.
3.0,"I am 5’8”, 34B, 132lb. My weight is in my butt. This dress was tight in the butt and upper legs, loose in the lower abdomen/waist, a little tight around my ribs but super wide in the chest. If it was tailored to fit my proportions I would have liked it. Very cute design but I definitely think it is meant for bigger chest and small bottomed individuals."
3.0,"I don’t even know what to think of this shirt. I never had a shirt that was so… I don’t even know how to describe it.  Translucent is a good start. The material is thin and it doesn’t look like much care was given into the making of this shirt. It was wrinkled straight out of the package but I’m afraid an iron would just destroy this thin material they used in this shirt. The messy stitching is inside and isn’t visible when you are wearing it at least not that I could tell. I will keep it and try to wear it here and there, but it certainly isn’t going to be a favorite and most likely will be skipped over often. May work out great for those that wear an undershirt as I attempted to do with it so my brown belly wouldn’t show through. Even though it is thin, it doesn’t appear to be too weak. I gave it a good tug and it seems strong enough to hold up for normal wear. Not good for diabetics who may find blood from a shot will show up pretty strong on the white material. It will absorb and show straight through. I believe I would say this is a five on a scale of ten. It’s a plain and simple shirt that looks like it was rushed through manufacturing."
3.0,"I bought it for my wedding, it was okay. Shipping took forever though, I think it was over a month."
3.0,The charm came off after wearing it for only a few hours.
3.0,Was very comfy while it lasted. Don't machine wash
3.0,"I'm on the small side of medium and because of reviews I ordered a large instead of medium. I like flannels and other winter button-ups to be loose fitting for layering purposes and this particular lined shirt I want to be able to use as a light jacket on occasion with another shirt under.<br /><br />First, it took weeks for this shirt to arrive. When it did I took it out of the packaging and tried it on. I was surprised that it fit perfectly as a shirt with no roominess to speak of for another layer having ordered the large. The sleeves hit the tops of my hands.  I noticed the retail ticket that indicated that in whatever country this came from it was considered an XXXL!<br /><br />Because of the fit out of the package I was worried how it would fit after washing. I can tell you now that after washing the sleeves are an inch shorter, the shoulders and sleeves are tight and overall I'm very unhappy with the fit and I'm especially unhappy because I really like the shirt color, cut and lining. It's very soft and comfy.<br /><br />I'm going to try to order a larger size and give this to my petite daughter-in-law.<br /><br />Buyer beware. If you are on the small side of medium order an XL. Apparently, women my size compared to the women of the country of origin are giants.<br /><br />I think if you actually wear a large and still want roominess you should go for a different shirt entirely."
3.0,the butterfly clasp is solid. the leather looks and feels cheap. shipping was fast
3.0,rough not too dressy
3.0,"Product runs very small! If you want a refund, you pay for shipping, and wait, and wait and wait, cause it has to go back to China."
3.0,Thee strap does not fit in the case and the piece the goes on the end of the glasses doesn’t go in all the way
3.0,A couple was broken when we got them. My daughter was a little sad we had to glue them
3.0,The boots were gr was but quickly wore down by puddles and everyday use.
3.0,"Shiney black mystery metal lends to a cheapo  look.  Crystal remains Unscratched at 6 months, despite my wearing it face down.  Might actually be sapphire.  Other Chinese watches that assert falsely, that the crystal is sapphire, generally have tiny fissures in the sheen by 3 months.  Not this one... So far.  Keeps excellent time ... Is about 2 minutes fast since I received it.  Leather band remains pretty stiff, even now !<br />  While I'm happy with its primary function, time indicator, I'm just not enthralled with its look.  Looks better in the picture!"
3.0,"The sizing is really off. We ordered two large for ages 3-6 it states. It really only fits my 3 year old size 9 shoes see picture. My 5 year old size 13.5 they don’t look like knee highes they look like standard socks. Little disappointed for her, but she was so excited to get them that I didn’t do a return."
3.0,Very skimpy
3.0,"I love the bottoms. They fit as expected. However, the top is very small. I have a very small chest (34B) and the top barely fits. I have thrown away the top and have decided to just use the bottoms with other tops I have."
3.0,Very thin and short
3.0,I was a bit disappointed with the length; more appropriate for a boy that an adult.
3.0,"Disappointed in true length of chord, which seems low quality, thin leather. It seems made for a child than a grown woman. Also, the spacing between the beads and the pendant are a lot closer together - they are nearly touching each other. The pendant also lacks the quality expected from the Carolyn Pollack American West brand of sterling silver. Gave three stars because I will send it to my granddaughter who will love it, and because American West has usually proven quality as advertised."
3.0,Nice bag good stitching lots of pockets only gripe is the material that is in the edges where it touches your neck/shoulder area is so thick it digs in I’m not a small guy at 6ft 280 but I would have hoped for some thought on material in places it will touch skin straps are ok feel like they can slip off a little easier than normal but all in all for under $30.00 good bag
3.0,About a size and a half small. Order big.. also thinner and shorter than expected
3.0,"Cheaply made, wondering how long it is going to actually last. We will see. Door feels like it is going to fall off."
3.0,"Size 12 was huge. Also seemed to be worn. Exchanged for another pair and they are fine. Not too sturdy, however, and look like they will spot easily."
3.0,A bit tight.
3.0,"Like the navy color, the shirt fit as expected but was very thin and the lace was not the most well put together but it looks nice enough. It's good for an undershirt. There is nothing to bad to say about it."
3.0,Lots of lose ends and not a tight weave... larger than small .. I'll use it but not order again
3.0,Decent. You get what you pay for. I recommend.
3.0,"The top is cute in style, but fabric is cheap. After one wash it looks like a $19.99 top from Target. I'm not dissing Target, bcause I would have purchased it at Target for $19.99 and given it a 5 star rating, but paying over 3 times the price, definitely not worth it. Disappointed because I saw a few other tops I would have purchased in the line, but won't take a chance."
3.0,Big to it’s size and it’s just meh.
3.0,Significantly longer than my leg. Returned.
3.0,I found myself having to pull these up quite a bit as the day went on.
3.0,I guess they're so so after a month or two they start to leak I got one another one sent to me but it's Ellie
3.0,Good material cut big
3.0,Very slim... really squeezed my daughter's foot...had to return :(
3.0,"These are too big for me, but look like a good product if I had ordered them in a smaller size."
3.0,"This bra is way too small for me. My breasts pop out of the top almost completely. I made the mistake of wearing just this for a workout and could have been arrested for public indecency halfway through. In addition to that the bottom band folds under, it stopped laying flush after one wash. It's like the boning or interfacing inside flipped during the wash."
3.0,"I ordered the 2XL since I know how sizing usually goes with this kind of thing. I’m a 5’8” curvy.  I normally wear an X-LARGE or a 2 XL if I want extra roominess. This fit like a crop top. My 5’2” mom loved it though, so she got a present!"
3.0,Just ok. Elastic isn't that great. Doesn't fit as securely as I had hoped but it does the job. Sweat and my hair are not in my face when I'm working out.
3.0,Have to send back. Too big.
3.0,I need to find a  bathrobe made for guys who are bigger around than they are tall.
3.0,"My wife bought these for our wedding. They served a purpose for the day but broke by the end of it. For the price though, can't complain."
3.0,"These are very cute and funky and the frames are pretty good quality but they block zero sun, if it’s really sunny the rose color almost is worse than not wearing sunglasses, they also fogged up easily it may be how close they rest to your face. Cute but not functional. These are sunglasses you wear at a fun spot for looks only."
3.0,"Love Dr. Who, but this wallet wears and tears easily.  I am currently in search of another more durable wallet."
3.0,"I bought this for my 7yr old daughter to wear for dance class.  While it is as cute as the picture shows, and a very soft material, it is much larger than the size chart indicated.  My daughter loves it so we are keeping it in Hope's she will remain in dance class the next couple years as it will be at least 6months before she'll be able to wear it for class without it slipping off her shoulders or extreme bagginess in the bodice."
3.0,Fun shoe laces. Added them to my shoes that the base lights up.
3.0,Runs small and is more shirt like than dress
3.0,"Good glasses, well made, feel nice, but the rims were just too big/thick for my face. Had to return them"
3.0,"The pendant is tiny and will bend very easy, very flimsy."
3.0,material is very rough
3.0,"I got these because I thought I could use them at night.  Not so.  My own fault for not reading all the reviews prior to purchasing them. They're good sunglasses, but not for night time."
3.0,Had to return it.... Was a bit snug..... but the color was beautiful..... and I wished I could’ve kept it it.... was just a bit too snug too tight..  the one I replaced it with I got in a large this time and even that one is still a little as well...  it not as  tight so I’m keeping.. . they must run small....  keep that in mind when you order..... otherwise the color and style material is beautiful wished I could’ve kept it
3.0,It was perfect for my daughters first birthday. It fit but I didn’t like the way it was cropped. It should be okay during the summer though. Not A Winter Set.
3.0,The lace at the shoulders stretches a little too much for my tastes. And the placement of the lace straps makes it difficult to find a bra that the straps won't be seen. Otherwise quite nice. The material is somewhat heavier than I expected as well. The length is good for wearing outside pants especially if you're trying to hide a little belly
3.0,"The slippers did not work for me, they’re too wide so they offered no support."
3.0,This is cute but the egg pockets could be bigger! Guess my chickens lay xlarge eggs!
3.0,"It's a little tight around the neck,Other than that I like It!"
3.0,"This was my second purchase of this item. The first one was a bit large; but I still wore it. Decided to purchase a size smaller to cinch my waist a bit more, but the top portion tore - the first time I put it on - where the lace is and it lost a lot of the support. The part where you slide your arms through was a bit too tight as well. Necooer was nice enough to refund me and promptly responded to all of my concerns."
3.0,"Runs a little big. I purchased the medium and it will be baggy. Still super cute, soft material."
3.0,"After several washings they are not as soft as expected, they do wrinkle and need to be ironed."
3.0,I hate generic bra sizing. Bras are far too complicated to just choose from these limited options. But I needed it for a costume. Its a great looking piece but good luck with the fit!
3.0,The fabric is very thin.  Will have to wear a camisole underneath.
3.0,"This dress is very pretty and not to short. I am 5'3 and it came to my knees. However, the zipper wasnt functioning properly."
3.0,The price was right to go with a goth costume but they don't stay put. Was constantly fixing it on my hand all night.
3.0,I loved the shirt its so cute but i ordered a medium i got a large with out notice and the first day i wore it my button on my sleeve popped off
3.0,"Ordered these for bridesmaid's jewelry for my upcoming wedding. While they appear to be very elegant earrings and will provide the right amount of sparkle, three of the eight ordered arrived broken. Very disappointing."
3.0,"It was a really pretty dress but it didn't look as the picture. It didn't fit on the size, so I would size a size up from what you original are. It was a very pretty and elegant dress though."
3.0,Runs a tad bit large not too much but enough to notice. Got a small feels like a medium. Great material and cute style tho.
3.0,"The sweater is cozy and comfy, VERY soft. But the color is BRIGHT red, I’m talking stop sign color red. I was expecting more of a maroon red."
3.0,Pretty but not with the price for reading glasses.
3.0,"I thought this would be like soft...more like cloth ig and its really slippery not good for keeping warm keeps you cold, thick and heavy feels like its weighted"
3.0,Nice shirt but it took almost 7 weeks to receive
3.0,Too big. Sizing not accurate
3.0,Expected better quality from Sperry
3.0,The dressed fit as expected however the dress is completely see through and very thin. I sent this item back.
3.0,"Too small, too tight, too shiney."
3.0,I got kuku brand not the brand shown but it's the same item
3.0,Too short in torso. Had to return.
3.0,It fits a little boxy
3.0,material is nice.  The waist is too tight though for the size.
3.0,"These are very thick boot laces and as such, don't fit all boot holes or lace hooks.  They come out of mine on ocassion.  Appear to be strong but only have worn them for a couple of months"
3.0,SUPER CUTE pj's but they run a bit small.
3.0,"If your daughter is a crawler, stay away from these. While they are adorable, the paint wears off super easy while crawling around and shoes look bad."
3.0,"odd fit on ch hest and shoulders. great fabric,"
3.0,Much shorter than expected and elastic under bust line was lower than expected
3.0,"Cute hat... does the job, shading my face from the sun..."
3.0,They’re very big; I wish there was an option in sizes. I go through so much soap using them it’s almost not even worth it. I’m better off using regular gloves with my sponge(my hands get super wrinkly and hurt ridiculously fast🤣)
3.0,"I’ve been ordering these bonnets for years, and this time it arrived different. Perhaps a different company making them? The large I usually get for it being oversized, is now much to small to even fit comfortably. Unfortunate."
3.0,Fits great and VERY comfortable. Gold flecks are not that noticeable which was disappointing.
3.0,"These were very nice, but a whole lot longer than I was expecting. I returned them."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it fits my arms and back perfectly. It is 38 inches long, so the long part of the cardigan ends at the back of my knee caps. It almost reminds me of a robe. It is 93% Rayon and 7% Spandex so it felt nice on my skin. The tag in the back was a bit of annoyance. The color is a true royal blue although the description says ' blue ' . So the colors is 100% accurate. What you see is what you get. I actually like the cardigan, and want to keep it. Since I ordered online, the price is worth it. Purchasing this at a retail store would probably be much cheaper, for example between $5 - $10 . I thought of sending this back but decided to keep it but will need to make some alterations so that the long part can fit a higher than the back of my knee caps."
3.0,I thought the color was accurately portrayed as it was in the picture. The shirt was just way too small.
3.0,It’s okay. I was hoping it would be a looser fit but not and it’s very thin
3.0,I ordered a large fit perfect everywhere but the butt area. I have a butt and hips but I feel this dress is for someone with a fake butt or those lucky ladies blessed with a Phenomenal booty. The crunch part on the booty would be better not being there.
3.0,"It is tight enough for discomfort. However, it is beautiful, so I am going to work with it."
3.0,Good latex
3.0,We had complaints at our event that they were too narrow.
3.0,"Add me to the ""too small"".<br /><br />I need a 38. Yes, fat.<br />I ordered a 40 because, despite what they say, I expected them to run small.<br />The ones I got say 6XL and are too small.<br />Great print, though."
3.0,"Felt super comfy but the zipper on the jacket is hard to zip, kind of cheap. Ordered an xtra large. Pants are super long which I love."
3.0,"Quit small, thought they would be bigger. But love the earringvs."
3.0,"Shorts are cute, good quality, not see through but the waist elastic rolls down and folds when sitting"
3.0,It does fit a bit smaller than I expected.  Get one size up because this item will shrink.
3.0,True to size (long) but sheer. Various styles can be worn.
3.0,I thought they were way too heavy.  Disappointing.
3.0,Didnt like fit; not very oversized<br /><br />Wanted to like them
3.0,This is not a plus size item (bought it for a size 10 pants and medium shirt sized person and it fits fine). The cups were a different shape than expected but the suit seems sturdy enough to last a while. The colour is also more pink than red.
3.0,"The shoe is quality, but the size is not accurate"
3.0,"Got the main product, which I'm very happy for, but the product only comes with two filters not six."
3.0,The elastic band is annoying but otherwise it's great. I didn't believe some of the reviews and did not size up. Wishing I got a large but I'm too lazy to deal with returns and such lol
3.0,was a lot tighter than I expected- not for women with a bust. beautiful dress though. I will probably just give it to a friend
3.0,Very cute but sizing is way off! I will keep them and hopefully my daughter can wear them at home over fall/winter. I did order another pair size smaller. Hopefully they fit her right this time.
3.0,"The colors are pretty in the picture and accurate in real life, however, in real life it has more of a ""fake"" appearance."
3.0,Another gag gift for an adult. Nothing special.
3.0,Beautiful dress but it run small.
3.0,5'8&#34; so I wear it with leggings
3.0,I love them but they scratch very easily
3.0,The waist is small even with the elastic. The rest of the skirt is fine.
3.0,I bought one pullover and one full zip hoodie for the money I expected better quality
3.0,"Run small, cute, but just okay."
3.0,Gloves are pretty comfortable. Unfortunately the Velcro straps at the wrist started to tear/unravel after only two to three months of light use.
3.0,Feels good but a seam is starting to open after 3 washings
3.0,It’s probably two sizes smaller than aspected.
3.0,"I'm debating if I should exchange them for a size larger, as they do run a bit small..... I am a size 10/12 normally, and the waist of the Large is too small....... Other than that, these pants are super-cool. Love the fabric, love the pockets.... very light-weight and a bit of stretch is really nice. The fit is flattering.<br />UPDATE: I ordered the XL.... same problem, only this time the waist fit perfectly, and the rest of the pants were too big. The manufacturer is making the waist too small for the pants. Hopefully they will fix this."
3.0,"Great design and colors, and priced right.  I am an anchor nut so this is a great addition for me and the colors are very pretty.  I think that I may have liked it better if it were a canvas bag versus being leather like.  It is much stiffer than I would have liked.  I used it for about 3 weeks with no other concerns."
3.0,The pajamas are very nice but the top is short
3.0,"The product itself is not bad. The only problem I have with them is they are extremely stinky. Before I purchased these boots I looked at the reviews and saw that someone had said the boots were stinky, but the smell faded over time. I have had these boots for quite a while and the smell has not gone away. Every time I wear them they always have that odd smell on them, so I do not wear them often and they have filled my entire closet with their aroma. They are fashionable shoes, but the pungent smell overpowers them."
3.0,"Definitely size up. The shirt was so small I had to stretch it out. My normal size isn’t even an XXL, I brought that size because I wanted it to be oversized since it’s PJS. You can find better quality PJS at target"
3.0,"Love the cozy soft material! Pants are true to size but top is way too large. I’ll probably keep, but alter the top so it’s not so baggy."
3.0,Cute but a bit tight
3.0,Ordered a lg runs like a Med
3.0,This were made of a nice material and felt like they would comfortable if they fit me properly. I had to return them bc they were too long and too big.
3.0,It's a nice dress but longer than I expected
3.0,I bought it for my daughter.  She loved IR but it. Comes apart easy.  The straps snapped & she only had it on for a week.  Not very sturdy .
3.0,"These hats are cute, but definitely not for babies! My three month old disappears in it."
3.0,Very heavy. Made great...but useless to me. Too bulky. Maybe I should have known.
3.0,"I thought the cut would be more feminine , I think it’s an ok shirt was hoping for a softer blend"
3.0,A lot of scarf. It's a little bulky for someone short like me. Perfect for a tall lady.
3.0,"when you get it connected the cable will charge your fitbit, but the connector is so loose that you have to do a balancing act to get it to stay in place. I know the original cable is a little loose like this too, but this one barely stays in place."
3.0,"Eh, these are just kind of middle of the road plastic polarized sunglasses.  Certainly nothing to rant and rave about.  I have gotten better quality for the same price at wallyworld."
3.0,I have other north face vests and this one runs much snugger and it is very stiff.  It is very warm
3.0,"I love the look of these.  The big oversized sunglasses are the only ones that look good on me.  These definitely look nice.  My problem is that I live in Southern California.  We’re already having 90+ degree days in April.  So I wear them on a late afternoon/ evening walks.  Every time we were out of the shade, the sun was blinding me.  I feel like this are just not dark enough or don’t block enough for where I live.  I appreciate their cuteness, but cute only goes so far and these don’t offer enough sun protection for me."
3.0,"I'm 6'3, 190lbs. It was way tighter than expected. I normally wear a large or XL in slim fit or regular shirts. This one was very tight"
3.0,I wanted to love this product so bad but it just didn’t hit. I should’ve took pics when I tried it on. But the top fit fine cute lil crop top with a slight mock neck but the shorts sigh. Definitely made for shapely females or females with weight. I’m 5’5 and pretty narrow these days about 110 lbs and the small was so saggy even pulled all the way up high waisted.
3.0,The pattern of the dress lays awkward.
3.0,Beautiful dress....but it didn't fit. It was too tight on my arms BUT what I was really upset was that gave me a dressed all messed up! Front layer wasn't even stitched right half was straight across and then it crunched up and they didn't even finished and on the side they just left it opened as a big hole. It was beautiful over all...built in bra and very comfy material I was just an unlucky customer
3.0,2 of the 3 are perfect. The black one does not lock in which is a problem!  Disappointed! I have bought over 20 of these from different places and have never had a problem!!
3.0,"Fit too small for XL when I wear an large, sleeves were 3/5 length and not long sleeve, very deceiving.  Won't buy again and plus it looks cheap"
3.0,"This was perfect size and design.  Unfortunately, the strap attachments are very weak and break in a few months.  This makes the purse of no value.  I have tried two, both failed in the same way.  Time to look for an alternative."
3.0,Loved the look didn’t want to spend a fortune<br />Nice fit
3.0,Fit was boxy and unflattering for my curvy figure. Returned
3.0,Shorts are comfortable but does not give enough support on my bum as I wish it would of idk it could be maybe cause I have a boney bum.
3.0,"The built in bra isnt supportive at all. At best, its a comfy night shrt."
3.0,Much shorter and less flowy than pictured. But still cute and I kept it
3.0,I really wanted to like these. They are super soft and feel great. The problem is they are way to big and show in all if my slip on vans.
3.0,"Great fabric and quality is good, but it runs small."
3.0,"These are great if you don’t plan on sitting. It did not roll. As a mom I need the tummy control and this helped however if you sit, expect a painful wedgie due to the fact that they stay high up on your waist and don’t move like regular underwear."
3.0,"It's cute, but it's not quality. I am usually a medium (6/8) but went with a large (per another review) and it fit perfectly. Cute with sandals and a jean jacket!"
3.0,"It worked for what I needed it for, but it turned dark brown after the first time I wore it. Luckily it can’t be seen, but I still expected a little better quality."
3.0,"The regular crystals were very cute, the “opals” weren’t very opal and looked almost foggy like a plastic bead. Didnt expect much for the price but I’m sure you could find better in around the same price range."
3.0,it's alright. too long for my size
3.0,"I used this for my tragus kinda hard to put on but once its in and tight, it looks really cute."
3.0,Not impressed with material and fit
3.0,"Love the shirt ,but when trying it on noticed it  had a run in the back,I dont want to return due to the fact I need it this weekend ,im hoping it doesnt get worse."
3.0,"The color is absolutely different than on a picture. The pants are light baby blue ones, not dirty mint ones as shown. Fit is nice. Probably will be nice in spring/summer time. Dont like baby blue, but they are comfortable. Kept them."
3.0,Really cute and definitely durable. Super wide though. They fit me and i bought them for my 2&4 year olds...
3.0,They are cute but straps a little snug and straps are stiff.
3.0,"My 20mo does NOT like keeping her mittens on, even when its snowing and 10 degrees outside. These worked for a bit at keeping the mittens from getting lost when playing outside. However, my daughter can now open the clasps. She is obsessed with buckles and found these to be another thing to try to figure out. If you have a very curious toddler these may not be the best. I'll be looking for something that she can't get apart."
3.0,I loved this band. Unfortunately it was very hard to get on and off. I thought it might loosen over time but in the end I think I used a screwdriver to get it off. I was sad
3.0,Item came as described but was to large to fit me
3.0,"Good quality however I ordered mediums 4 pair and got 2 mediums and 2 smalls, that’s why I gave it 3 stars"
3.0,HOW do you gr8 this on? The clasp is wobbly and taut.  I will literally need someone else to help me put it on.
3.0,"Bought at fifty, now it’s Thirty dollars. Ughh"
3.0,"I gave it 3 stars because I like the design but the material for the yellow is see through, and if you are not all toned up it will show all of you.  Too bad because I really like the style it just looks cheap- I should have returned it but will use it for around the house.<br />n"
3.0,"Love the style, cards don't stay in very well though :("
3.0,lol not their fault I wasn't paying attention to the size of the chains..but was a bit OH MY Way too small for what we need (daughter loves to play with chains in her bucket....but oh well :)
3.0,"I’m a size 4-6, 34B, and wear a small in most blouses. The small was too tight across the shoulders and chest. I’m returning."
3.0,They were all right
3.0,It was a gift and nice
3.0,They look exactly as described and my son loved them but they are made for a slim fit!
3.0,The dress is nice but the fabric is kind of heavy. The v neck goes all the way to the seam at waist so it can gap open.
3.0,"Nice watch but not sapphire crystal, it has a mineral crystal"
3.0,It’s kind of big but I think she will like it
3.0,very cute but it came scratched
3.0,I’m 5’2 and it went down to my knees. Bust is 34DD and was baggy up there too. Will be returning.
3.0,Stole received was ripped from the colar. Now have to wait and see if the adult stole will be the same. Disappointed in how there was mo quality check before shipping
3.0,Pretty necklace but rose fell off easily
3.0,It’s a beautiful shirt and fits good. But it’s build different that in the picture.
3.0,Too clingy and fitted for work
3.0,This little outfit is absolutely adorable and my son looked so cute in it. The only drawback I had about it was it was made paper thin and the bow tie kept breaking. My son only got to wear it twice because after the second wash (I hand washed it the second time) it started tearing apart at the seams and had to throw it away.
3.0,"I wanted these to help my child w/ virtual schooling.. They are adorable, but the cake with numbers on the front of the lenses & I don’t know what to do to remove? The product care instructions say not to use alcohol & that’s the only thing I thought may remove it? Sadly she won’t be wearing them for school this week unless we can figure out a way to get them clean.. Soap & water didn’t do it.."
3.0,"It’s a nice style. The gathering at the bust is a little off, doesn’t fall as nicely as shown. For the price though, a good spare suit."
3.0,"It’s a little bulky, this product would be a 5 start product if they could somehow slim the overall case of the thing."
3.0,Was great at first now it is very loose and even some red paint has been coming off
3.0,"The first rectangle of this skirt is tighter to the hips than a full flow. Though it fit, I didn't like the style of it and opted to return it."
3.0,"While the dress fit well and seemed very well made, the neckline was so itchy my daughter was unable to spend more than 10 minutes in it and she had broken out around the collar from scratching. We had to return, it didn’t work out for us."
3.0,"This dress is super cute but the fabric is not super great. I have a bigger chest (36DD) and ordered a large, it fits great everywhere except my chest where it stretches out some, which is nice but it is see through."
3.0,Battery life sucks !
3.0,These run small and they looked cheaper than I was expecting.
3.0,"65% of reviews stated the fit was to small so I ordered a size up and i was swimming in the top (normally a S/M, ordered a L). I generally like my bottoms a bit loose so this would be a good fit for me, but since it is a set I have to return it. The overall quality is good. I did expect the spandex paneling in the sides if the top to be a bit thicker but they were really thin- felt  like poor quality. for the price it's a good buy."
3.0,Not very soft and pretty tight on through wrist.
3.0,"I bought it as a gift for a friend. When i opened the watch and looked at the dial i thought i got the damaged one. But then I took a close look at the original picture and the dial has some kind of bubble pattern at the center. I did not see that before ordering. You can zoom and see the center of the dial in the picture. So i have to explain to my friend that its not damaged and it is the original pattern :( Other than that, the watch is good."
3.0,"Received package the other day, needless to say I was a little disappointed that the signage was just stickers placed on a frame. I will keep it, but will look for better quality frame for $25.00."
3.0,This cardigan came at expected arrival time. It fits as a true size but the color is off from what is shown on the website. When I receive it was very light in color and it did not look burgundy at all.
3.0,I ordered the white dress. I liked this dress except it was see through. I couldnt even wear my waist trainer becuase you could see it. And it was a nude color. Besides that it fit good was comfortable and pretty. Would probably be better in a darker color
3.0,The chain was not built well it broke the second day I was wearing it
3.0,Very easy to be scratched.
3.0,expecting better. one of the straps snapped already and the eye holes really irritate your eyes.
3.0,"Cute little pendant makes a sweet little gift for young person; obviously this is not valuable so really is just a sentimental little gift idea. Cute, won't last long but looks good while being worn."
3.0,"The belt is cute, but I ordered the gray color and received a beige color.  I was very unhappy about that."
3.0,Bikini looks like the perfect bikini for summer. I love the ruffle on top and the colors too.<br /><br />Unfortunately it has taken a month of waiting and it is still not here. It is currently marked as unavailable on their listing.<br /><br />I will update my review.
3.0,They need ironing most of the time.  I have a hard time hiding the edges under things so that you can't tell it's a fake collar.
3.0,Nice feel but the grey is almost see through...I’ll have to wear a tank top under it just to make sure because in certain lighting you can see through the fabric like it isn’t even there
3.0,"I sized down one, since I wanted a more fitted look.<br />I wanted a long sleeved one for winter - the sleeves were too short, by a LOT,  but not enough to be a cute half sleeve.<br />The biggest thing was the material - flimsy Tshirt material. NOT soft, horrible lack of drape, so it looked wadded up and frumpy instead of the twist looking drapey and elegant."
3.0,"The style of the dress is cute, but the material is so so thin! Definitely over-priced for the material. You can go to Ross, Burlington, or TJ Maxx and find better quality for the same price. Unfortunately, I'm one day past my return window..."
3.0,Ok for a day bag
3.0,"The fabric was very scratchy and stiff., even after washing it twice, when I received it. Not quite as big as I'd hoped but it's a serviceable garment. Just don't buy it thinking it's gonna soft and comfy. Cause it won't be."
3.0,"I am 5'4 and 132 lbs, I brought a size s but it still fit big!! LOL how I managed to make it work was by buying a belt that tie down the middle part of the dress. Regardless, many people complimented me on it :)"
3.0,They are good quality so far and comfortable but they don’t really offer any support for even medium activity. They are good for lounging if you’re just looking for comfort and not high intensity support.
3.0,That part of your feet that is right after your toes; that bridge that rises<br />My bridge is tall and the incline is steep.<br />These slippers are not comfortable at all because I have reached the limited flexibility of these slippers long before I put it on all the way and it is almost crushing my foot to the point where I feel the blood flow being obstructed.<br />Gave them to my younger brother.
3.0,I ordered this adorable dress in the pale yellow IKAT print in a size Large.  Fit like a dream and received a lot of compliments.  Then I ordered it in the Navy Blue dot print in the same size and it fits nothing like the first dress.  It's almost like it is mis-tagged with the wrong size and could be a medium or small.  I am returning the Navy blue and reordering in hopes that I get the same experience from the yellow dress.
3.0,"I love the look of this. I usually wear a size 14 and had to order an xxl for the bust size according to their sizing. I have never ordered that big of a size. The dress just barely fits and the arms are very tight. If I wash it and it shrinks any I will not fit in it. I had high hopes for this but the sizing is way off. I loved the look, just sad that it is way smaller than the sizing chart states."
3.0,"These are well made, but fit weirdly. The crotch is far too long."
3.0,This hat is cute but too small for me.  I have a slightly bigger than average head but this hat can't be pulled down.
3.0,The ring part is fine but the carbon fiber center part is discolored
3.0,Quality was great but took too long to receive and only able to wear once due to late arrival.
3.0,Short torso- did not fit. Would be great for a petit woman. Great tummy control. Sexy top.
3.0,I've been wearing smarwool products for about 5 years. The last pair that I bought is not like the ones I purchased before. The knit is thin. The logo had a run which is about to come apart.
3.0,The kid broke them in less than a week .
3.0,The legs are very big I better bring out my sewing machine
3.0,"The boots are awesome and very gorgeous, but not made to fit my skinny legs... I still wear them though. Not hard to walk in either, given you are used to tall heels."
3.0,"Misleading, the advertisement should have clearly stated that hair did not come with this with the very first bullet point. Otherwise I suppose it's ok. I have no hair to go with it at this time."
3.0,"very dissapointed the hat came mashed and the brim was creased, i do't know if i'll be able to get that out, not pleased with this purchase at all. i guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I will be back to update this review, but I just want to say that I am in love with the grey ombre leggings, but super disappointed in the black leggings. I ordered the grey and black combo pack. The black leggings are not even the same material as the ombre leggings. The ombre leggings are completely squat proof. They stay up during my workouts and it's nice not having to adjust my leggings after squatting or what not.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the black leggings that came with the combo pack??? COMPLETELY see-through! I did a squat test with my husband to make sure they were squat proof and he said there is no way that I could leave the house in those leggings! I checked in the mirror and he's right! I always wear patterned undies when I try on new leggings and you could make out every detail of the pattern."
3.0,Fit was a little small but it is a really cute dress. I am 6 ft and the length fit below the knee. The fabric is a little thin as well so you might need a slip.
3.0,"My son will only wear these and living in a small town they are hard to find. The toes wear out rather quickly, but he loves them."
3.0,"Too tight across the bust, if you're a busty gal.  Otherwise, it was nice.  Had to return it because of the fit."
3.0,just because I prefer cotton underwear.
3.0,Fits snuggly around hips and too short
3.0,"absolutely gorgeous, but WAY TOO BIG TO WEAR"
3.0,I was unable to find what I have in my drawer...thicker cotton and print on both sides. These are one-sided print and thinner. The sewing on the edge is good and the prints did not run through the first wash (the darker colors did bleed a bit but were washed with a target white work t-shirt to monitor so no grief here. I sure would like to find more of the originals I mentioned.
3.0,order larger than you need.  Very cute but rum small.
3.0,"Love the band, comfortable, great colors, easy to use… BUT it comes un-snapped very easily and falls off."
3.0,"Well, I ordered a size larger than I generally do figuring I would be more comfy with something loose for sleeping. These are really really weirdly cut. The shorts are so very short that they are almost indecent as my butt cheeks show out the bottom of the shorts! And, if you are like me, you might want to wander around in your PJs in the morning without showing off what mother nature gave you to all your assorted family members. The top, conversely, was baggy and loose and weirdly shaped. So, nah, these really are not for me. However, they ARE made of very comfortable material, are extremely light and soft, and feel good on the skin. I just found the cut and fit to be too weird for me."
3.0,"These fit, but are somewhat small on me, and not that stretchy. When I wear them, they feel okay and provide pretty good support. If I'm sweaty from a workout, its VERY hard to take off over my shoulders."
3.0,The sleeves are adorable but I hate the twist in the front! I wish the bottom was just normal. 😢
3.0,The top of the zipper does not lay flat.
3.0,"These are cute pants but are not made well. After wearing the pants for a few hours, the cute racing stripe was already tearing off."
3.0,This dress was more like a shirt than a dress. Couldn’t wear it :(
3.0,I didn’t know how to use these.<br />They are very pretty.
3.0,"The small shorts fit nicely, but the top is too big, my boobs (which are a nice average size) keep falling out. If the straps were a bit shorter, it would work nicely."
3.0,The color is not that blue. It’s more navy blue
3.0,Love the shirt. One strap came twisted though and I can’t fix it.
3.0,"Cute bra, but need more thickness to material Fit was good."
3.0,"For the price it's definitely worth it. Bottoms fit nice but beware they are cheeky! I have a lot of hips and a lot of booty so I was happy to see that the bottoms fit comfortably. The top didn't stretch the way the bottoms did and I found it difficult to get my arms in and out but it fit, just a big pain getting it on and off. All in all, I'd order other colors."
3.0,This costume was cute but runs very small. I recommending measuring and going a size up as I went from a medium to a large and it still didn’t fit. So it wound up ripping because the bottom had no stretch. Disappointed
3.0,"Dress is pretty, but NOT FOR PETITE and there is no way to fix it even if you know how to."
3.0,The hat looks good for the price.
3.0,Good for the price but they are a little “saggy” and fabric is slightly see-thru.  Otherwise good deal for the price if paired with something that covers your butt and you’re not wearing them in Sub-degree temps
3.0,"I was very disappointed that this watchband does not have the quick release lever shown in the photos. Mine came with 2 metal spring load pieces that were apart from the band. You have to put the spring load metal peices in the band and then pop into your watch brackets. This makes changing the band much more difficult than the quick release lever shown in the photos. Also these bands are very thick compared to original Garmin band. I considered returning this band, but decided to put up with the extra effort to change bands because the royal blue color is so nice."
3.0,"Love the pillow! However, I never received the socks, I even emailed about them but I never received a response."
3.0,Nice jacket but like others have said runs very small.
3.0,WITH A LITTLE MANEUVERING IT WORKS.
3.0,The hat is a bit large even though after measuring my head it said I was in the middle of Large/ ex Large. It seems to work but as the hat falls off when I bend over it gets tiresome putting it back on all the time.
3.0,Grandaughter loved it. Good for child.
3.0,I didn't like the fabric. It's a crepe fabric.
3.0,Didn’t fit my 8 year old like we wanted. He loves it and is good quality. Would recommend for older youth.
3.0,I am 5'4&#34; and these pants are crazy long on me. The fit great through the waist and hips but the length is really too much
3.0,"Love the print, but it is not fluffy like I thought it’d be.  It is cotton and falls a bit odd compared to the lighter fabric ones that are full and light."
3.0,"The glasses fit and look great, but, after a few days, one of the arms broke. I was trying to adjust them carefully for the best fit and they just snapped."
3.0,Sometimes clothing runs small ordered a size up to be sure. Still too small
3.0,"Ordered qhat i thought woukd be right size by reviews,  but was still tight. Since receiving, i have lost ten lbs, so it fits better. Wish i had ordered in other colors too. I wiukd recommend choosing two sizes larger than suggested."
3.0,"Love color, runs small"
3.0,The metal turned my ears green
3.0,"It is a beautiful suit, the quality was better than I expected. And I love the color! But it does run a lot smaller than advertised. I am an 18/20 US so I ordered a 7xl / US20. It’s made for petite torsos. As another review mentioned the top came so low on me also, that my nipples showed . This design just wont work for an average height person. I mean, one reviewer was 5’11” and said that, but I am 5’6”. So, only get this if you’re short in the torso. And possibly only if you’re small chested. I’m a DD, perhaps that is also the issue."
3.0,"You get what you pay for - I thought this deal was too good to be true.  The bolero is okay, nothing special, quality doesn't look great.  I'm 5' 4&#34; and 117 lbs, size 34D chest.  I wish the bolero was a little larger, but okay as is."
3.0,Nice shirt. Was a bit smaller than expected but I am also a bit taller than most woman.
3.0,These are ok but very very loose. Was hoping for better quality of the material. I just don't feel these will hold up to multiple uses as they will stretch out very easily and not spring back.
3.0,The design on these is pretty hard to see. But they are nice for the price
3.0,Lapel pin sized.
3.0,"These are fine in a pinch. They fit comfortably on the face, but they fog up quickly."
3.0,I’m always a small or medium. Ordered a medium and it’s just way shorter than I like. Design is cute but I don’t like short t-shirts.
3.0,"If only they had extra large to fit my chest. Very cute but I can’t button the top button so I have to wear a tank underneath. It’s also a little short. I’m 5’4, 150 lbs, 36 D. Ordered L. I think it’s cuter without the belt."
3.0,"Runs small and is short in length, order one size up at least."
3.0,"These are not as nice in person as they are in the picture. They are not nearly as shiny. They are very cheap looking. But, they were very cheap to purchase. I guess you get what you pay for. They really are not as nice as the picture would have you believe."
3.0,"They are beautiful, but the wire through my ear is too big.  It hurts to wear them."
3.0,"I usually wear a small or medium, upon reading the reviews I ordered a large. I am glad I did, the large fits me just right. The material feels a little rough and the color looks more like red and blue not red and black. The dress is ok, but I wish the material was not so rough."
3.0,Said it was 3/4 sleeve but it was long sleeved and didn't like the material. Had to return it.
3.0,"These earrings are really cool looking, but the tassles are very cheaply made and were already in shambles falling apart when I got it in the mail. It's not worth the effort it takes to ship them back otherwise I would."
3.0,"It&#34;s ok ,not as good as another Aegend Clear Swimming Goggles , i use it as back up now."
3.0,I love 90 degree workout wear and have not had a problem until this pair. This is the first time I bought them off Amazon. I love the color and the fit bit I have washed them three times and with each washing strings are coming out of the seams.
3.0,"I bought the Obsidian hat thinking it was a black hat. To me it looks black and everywhere I have searched online, Obsidian is never blue. The hat I received instead was navy blue. For simplicity and for those of us who are color blind, the name should be blue or navy blue so others know what they are getting. I actually sent the picture to several friends and they said it was black to them. Hopefully color name gets changed so others don’t make the same mistake."
3.0,"It looks pretty cheap, and the gold is much more bright yellow than in this picture. Still cute and function tho."
3.0,"I like the rings, but the glitter rubs off all over you."
3.0,These are nice shorts BUT they run extremely small. I usually wear large & after reading reviews I ordered an XXL and it was sooooo small. Returned.
3.0,"Beautiful tiara, heavy and well made but very small. From a few feet away you can barely make out the “16” on someone’s head."
3.0,I didn’t like the elastic pucker around the off shoulder/neckline
3.0,"This lounge wear is NOT true to size genre the 3star rating.  If it was true to size I would have given it a 5star rating!  Its gorgeous, is beyond comfortable, not too hot not too cold- perfect 😊!!!  However, you MUST buy a size up from your normal size you wear & buy.  This item runs small & so you want to go up a size to ensure if it so happens to shrink it still fits you great!!!  (have not washed it.  Waiting for the bigger size to be delivered Friday!  I wear a large & returned it for an XL.)"
3.0,"This dress was a good 12 inches too long. The sizing is off too as it fits tighter than expected. It is cute and there are pockets, but it's ridiculously long."
3.0,It was as expected from the other reviews that said the material is on thin side. It is very stretchy as well and is on the large side for me.
3.0,"Very, Very cheap material used. Styles were good. Although cuffs were extremely inexpensive, I expected a better quality material to be used. I can't even bend the cuffs to adjust them to my ears."
3.0,"While the dress did fit nice, I wasn't happy with the colors.  Maybe I'm just super OCD, but I don't like how the solid, dark top portion did not match the dark stripes in the skirt portion (the top is more of an turquoise where the stripes are navy).  I feel as though it makes the dress look tacky and cheap.  I am considering returning for another color, because the dress is very comfy and the material is very soft!"
3.0,Too big but that's my fault for not measuring
3.0,I love these socks - I’m in work boots 14-18 hours some days and these socks really are fantastic for keeping my feet comfy and dry and cool.  But they don’t last.  I have 18 pairs of these and so they don’t get worn but maybe 2 days a month at most and you can see from the pictures there is a problem. They wear out in the toes (I don’t wear safety toe every day) and in the heels (I was actually wearing crocks when the heel ripped in that picture).  So I do love them but for the price…I’m not sure I’ll keep buying them if they keep falling apart at this rate.
3.0,fabric has NO STRETCH. fits everywhere but the bust. if you have big girls there is just no way in hell this will fit you. also the straps are super short
3.0,I think these are really cute.
3.0,Cool but doesn’t glow very long
3.0,This handbag is only good for a small event. You can't fit much in there and it doesn't stay shut. It can however hold an iPhone 5 with an otter box case on it
3.0,"For ladies with long torsos and smaller breasts, this swim suit is a little short lengthwise and the center V-cut area leaves room for lots of chest."
3.0,nice but smaller than I anticipated
3.0,"It’s beautiful, but it doesn’t work. You would think their was a  battery, but it seems like theirs not. I had set the time, but nothing happen. So I don’t know what to do.."
3.0,Be warned if you have a thick neck do not buy this. I had to but another necklace to extend this one. The good part is it did not change it is still in a good condition.
3.0,2 Bulky
3.0,"I’ve had a pair for years, hands down best 10$ sunglasses, however, they aren’t the color pictured, which was fairly disappointing."
3.0,Elastic started popping and breaking on the first pair I put on. The sock slid down around my ankles all day. I gave the remaining pair to Goodwill
3.0,The bad news is It's a little short(I'm 5'3') the belt was a little big for my waist. And a string was unattached in the bag but I easily sewed that back on no biggie. But the good news is it's very sexy and it was a good price. Overall I still like it.
3.0,"I liked to blue ones better than the red, but the material is too cheap and the mailing time was over a month.  Not worth the wait or shipping cost."
3.0,I’m spoiled from the Arshiner sweater
3.0,Just around the arms its a bit tight.
3.0,"They are pretty. But larger than I expected. More for dressing up, not casual wear."
3.0,"I ordered the brown, it’s closer to a mustardy tan. I actually really love the color. I am usually a size small and could tell this would be a tight fit, so I ordered a medium, but it is still pretty skin tight.  It’s cute, but even smaller than I expected."
3.0,Item was too big. I got a 3-5y for my 42lb 2 yr old who wears a size boys 4. It was even too bug for my 6 year old. With proper sizing I do believe it would make a great product
3.0,"The sweater is a perfect dusty rose and is long enough to make it great for the fall season. The shoulders are a little odd, causing the sleeves to fall often. I wish it had a button to hold it in place."
3.0,It's well made but the glass-plastic seems to make the WWE graphic hard to see.
3.0,I’ve only had for a short time and the top of the iPod case keeps coming off.. it NEVER stays on the top
3.0,blue topaz large as described.<br />didnt care for the textured sides.<br />after polishing it a few times i decided to keep it.<br />ring arrived in cheap cardboard ring box. i was dismayed by poor presentation.<br />i have purchased previously from same supplier and that ring came in a nice quality ringbox.<br />diamonds unnoticeable.<br />all in all i would recommend purchasing from this supplier.
3.0,"They don't live up to the claims on warmth or use with touchscreens, but the price is appropriate for what they are - a decent pair of winter gloves. Best for 20-30°."
3.0,"I’m so bummed.  This dress is gorgeous and I would have loved to wear to my 20s event this week.  However, it was much too snug in all the wrong places.  Should have known these kind of dresses are only good for stick people.  Would have been nice if there were bigger size options for us curvy girls with post-baby bumps.  ;)"
3.0,The US flag is all wrong and is coming apart.<br />I should have paid better attention to the pictures since they don't show the upper left of the stars on the flag for a reason.<br />Live and learn.
3.0,It was good for my daughter to wear for one day
3.0,[[VIDEOID:27c06d98573d5b94b034c8509950d9ee]] This dress has a very nice feel! And fits like a dream I’m big chested but smaller around the waist and this dress fits in a flattering way that isn’t revealing which I love but three stars bc it’s SEE THROUGH with a slip it should be fine!
3.0,"The band is much darker than it is shown in the pictures, and also feels more like a soft touch rubber texture instead of the suede look.<br /><br />Band fits the watch great. The 24mm version fits an 8.5"" wrist<br /><br />Spring bar for the buckle is removable, so I was able to replace it with my own buckle.<br /><br />I do wish the strap loop was stitched to the short side of the strap, would prevent it from slipping down."
3.0,"Chic, but fell apart quickly. I wore them a few times, max, and the rafia came unglued and started unraveling."
3.0,They are ok but a little hard to get cards in and out.
3.0,Good price.<br />Good appearance.<br /><br />Mine was defective.
3.0,"The item itself is a nice shirt,however the clothes run extremely small!!!ordered an exlg the shirt is still small😈when shopping and buying from a store a large is the size I buy!!<br />I will No Longer be buying any items from these websites!!!!"
3.0,Returned. It was too large and the  blue was almost black.
3.0,2 arrived broken. Very cheap material.
3.0,"I’m 5’8. 175. Athletic / muscular.  These pants fit great on me in the upper half. But I have smaller calves relative to my thighs, and the zipper causes the pants to bulge out a bit in the calves. Would probably give these a 4 or 5 if they fit better in the lower region ( or if I had fuller calves:)"
3.0,"Isn't a pretty as I had hoped, it looks and feels cheap, I am somewhat disappointed but the sentiment is there"
3.0,"These socks feel like the 97% polyester the label says and not the 80% cotton as advertised.  They fit me really well because they are a touch smaller than the cotton ones, which I washed on warm and dried on hot and are still a touch big."
3.0,The trim started coming off the purse after the first week
3.0,"I like that they feel good & even in 90 degrees they were cooler then most pants. Seem well made but as usual as someone who normally wears XL to 2XL depending on inseams I have been found I need to order 3xl for an inseam that is actually comfortable. In this case 2XL was it so I tried it out, waist was fine, inseam was acceptable but was so tight on my thighs that they just became uncomfortable. I have long but thin legs and a huge barrel chest so I look like an upside down pyramid. With that being mentioned- I have never ever ran into pants that were to tight on my thighs so not sure what the issue is here. I unzipped the pants leg just to see if that helps but still way to tight. Just can’t recommend based on the thigh size alone."
3.0,Nothing spectacular. The sticky foam trim on the inside was thrown on super sloppily and was barley hanging on when I took it out of the packaging. Had to cut a good part of it off as it was no longer sticky. The foam was also too large so had to trim the edges so it's not seen when worn. The PVC is bendable and forms to the head nicely. Definitely just an ok prop to use once or twice for a Halloween costume but I wouldn't say it's worth the $33 I paid for it.
3.0,"My toddler loved these when Santa brought them in his stocking, so I bought this big batch for an Easter egg hunt we had for his birthday party. Individually, they fit perfectly in the eggs. They were a big hit with our party guests (ages 3-7).<br /><br />My complaint was that some of the lights did not work at all."
3.0,Too large for size. 2x feels like 3x.Material is very thin.
3.0,"Quality seems good, great fit in waist, length is short, some may find length too short. NEEDS LONGER LENGTH"
3.0,It did not hold up. Came apart in the seam and then after a few wears it split like it was dry rotted.
3.0,"Because you could mix and match sizes, top is a little big and bottom is a little small. Donated the bottoms and like the top a lot!"
3.0,"Loved the style, quality, material,,,,however shoe runs about 1.5-2 sizes too big! Also red is actually coral/pinkish. I bought for my daughter, my son woild never wear this color."
3.0,The cancel noise very well but i get a migraine if i wear it for more than 15 min. Great for fireworks but not good for day to day noise canceling.
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these as I like wearing them under a dress jacket. They were way too small so I gave them to my daughters. Love the color. I didnt know what crop top meant, very short!"
3.0,"I am 5' 1&#34; and around 110, 30D-DD and I choose size S.  I chose not to keep the suit. The bra part is fully foam and made my boobs look like torpedoes; it looked like I was wearing a cheap strapless bra.  This might be useful for smaller bust sizes, but just looked weird on me.<br />The suit is one piece, but the bottom is attached with some mesh and the tummy part covers that mesh to provide the rusching.  This made it look like more of a tankini- not what I was looking for.<br /><br />The material feels thin, it is not lined.  I chose the red and white dot pattern and didn't like how the dots worked with the lines of the suit.  The red is more of an orange-red in person.<br /><br />I would recommend spending the money and buying a good quality suit with support.  JCrew has some nice ones"
3.0,"I tested this on a rainy day in Tennessee, where I had to be out long enough to have a good soaking.  I did not feel it was as rain repellent as I needed for this purpose.  My clothes underneath were damp.  This would be more suitable for light rain, when you were not having to be out in the rain for long periods of time.  The length was great and the sleeves were long enough to not ride up above the wrists when I was using my arms, and the drawstring in the hood gave it a good fit on the head."
3.0,"It's basically what I wanted, not overly impressed,  also not disappointed. Decent."
3.0,"Appears to be of high quality. I am disappointed that there was not a better, clear explanation of the exact product info like Saddleback Leather does. They say made in America, but they do not divulge what grade of leather this is. The edges are dyed very dark, so, can’t really do a detailed inspection. Other than that, it seems top notch so far.  I’d give it 5 stars if they were as revealing as Saddleback."
3.0,The insert to secure the photo does not fit on 15% of the keychains in this set. Very frustrating. I do love how cheap they are though. I continue to purchase them for the price. Would reccommend if you don’t mind throwing some out.
3.0,Nice quality but smaller than expected.
3.0,"The dress itself was just ok. Fit was kinda big for my 12 month old. She is tiny for age so that’s why bought the smallest size. However, I’m upset because it did not come with the head band as advertised. This was a big part of my decision but it and I feel cheated. I’m seeking compensation."
3.0,"I cant really explain it, but in person it has more of a nightgown like feel and look. It might be the fabric, which feels like a thicker rayon nightie, or the colors in the pattern which are lighter than the image on my computer. I am keeping it though as it will be good for a casual summer day. And the pockets are great!"
3.0,Love the purple but am not happy with the fit.  A little on the small side and not as comfy as I was hoping for..
3.0,I got these in yellow for a 70's party and i actually really like them.  They fit good and the length is perfect not to thick and not to thin.  The only thing i don't like is it has a really strong chemical oder to them.  I washed them in warm water and that help but it will take a few washing to get the smell out.  That's the only reason i gave it 3 stars.
3.0,"While it's still a pretty chain and design, it does not look exactly as pictured. The rings are actually further down the foot."
3.0,These gloves did not stretch very well for me. And they did not keep water out. They only mildly stopped my fingers from getting cut up for being a cut level 5.
3.0,"We bought this base to use with the Trademark Innovations Patio Half Umbrella sold by Amazon. (http://www.amazon.com/Trademark-Innovations-Patio-Umbrella-9-Feet/dp/B00LBG85JK?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00). But we had to put three 12-lb downrigger weights on top of it to hold the umbrella steady in even the lightest breeze. As other reviewers have suggested, look for a heavier base. But it looks nice (except for the weights on top of it)."
3.0,Very THIN but cute and stylish.
3.0,"I really love the dress but there is a hole on the waistband , I noticed before I could even try it on ."
3.0,"Alright so,  this dress fits perfectly!!!!!  I love it! However,  as soon as I took the dress out of the package I noticed small dark marks on various areas of the dress... Which was very disappointing.  This was part of my halloween costume... And the SECOND item for my costume that arrived damaged.  I'm pretty disappointed in Amazon as of late."
3.0,They are so cute my granddaughter loved them when she got them for Christmas. Maybe to much the sole started to separate from the material after about a week of wearing them every chance she got.  Wish they were a little more sturdier and lasted longer.
3.0,"This was a cute gift, although it looked somewhat different from the picture.  The dye used on the letter came off on the recipient's wrist, but she liked it anyway."
3.0,"The dress is cute but does fit a lil tight in the arms and across chest. I am 5'6"", 170lbs and ordered according to size chart. The length is short but I feel fine in flats."
3.0,"Nice straps but fake leather with the price, you can try and If you have small wrists."
3.0,Cute but I wish I had known it doesn't have snaps at the crotch. Not sure I will dress my baby in this since I'd need to change take it off to change her diapers constantly.
3.0,"I bought sandals and slip on shoes and they both fit larger than expected. My heel slips in the slip ons but maybe because I like to be able to wear them with and without socks. The sandal are cute but straps are too loose. They do not offer a 5.5 which is probably what I need. Sizes jump from 5 to 6 and if you read the size chart a 6 is really a 6-6.5 which means for someone who is a true 6 they will probably be larger. Unfortunately, I did not look at the size chart since I have never seen a shoe be listed as a 6-6.5 before. Probably will be sending them back."
3.0,The O ring keeps popping off. Should be good for very short amounts of time and not over night but I was using them 5 out 7 days. They are very discreet
3.0,We should have read this better and saw that you only get 20!
3.0,I gave to my best friend. Se really liked it. The only thing is that she didn't understand the single rope.
3.0,"Size says 7-8, it runs very small<br />Options are to return don't offer an exchange"
3.0,They look good. I did not try them on because I am returning them. They are not cotton.
3.0,The only problem with this product was that I ordered light grey and I was sent the whit one. Other than that it was very nice but very light so not good for cold days
3.0,I bought these for a breathable option but they are most definitely not. Too much material and sloppy design. Will not be using.
3.0,I am concerned that this one will break like the other so I haven't worn it yet.  It is really pretty and I like the look.
3.0,The built in bra lining is visible through the dress. I contacted the seller because it didnt look like the picture.They were great and refunded me 30% right away. I cut out the lining but the material is so stretchy and slippery now it pokes out  the top- whoops. Nothing a little hemming tape wont fix. I'm 5'4 about 115 lbs and the small was a little big on me. For the price it's okay.
3.0,"Weirdly loose on the sides, bra showed. I was really excited for this dress but it just didn't work on me. Maybe if they did the top with a short cap sleeve instead."
3.0,"I'm 5ft 3in and this dress was way too long on me. The fit was true to size, but the length was really off."
3.0,"I like the fit, but the quality is just OK."
3.0,"I typically float between wearing a medium and a large, just depending on the garment. I usually go for large, just to have a little extra wiggle room. So I went for large with these, since lots of folks said they run small. And they were right. The large definitely fits me more snug like a medium. But on the flip side to that, they are flattering with a longer cut (I'm only 5'2&#34; and they come down to right above my butt) and scoop neck. They are a bit thin as well-definitely a layering piece. They look cute with a longer lacy bottomed cami underneath. I for sure wouldn't wear the white top without something else underneath it."
3.0,"Difficult to get on my Costas, and the seams started to split the more i tried to shove my sunglasses into them. Still managed to get them on though, and they are decent looking. Tried to float them in a pot of water, and my sunglasses floated depending on how they fell. Didn't really expect them to fully float though, as the lenses are made of glass."
3.0,The grey scarf I ordered isn't any shade of grey. It's more of a mauve.
3.0,"Cute pj's with a matching mask. Love the color, comfortable, cottony fabric. Great deal, but I would size down a bit if you like a more sexy/taut look."
3.0,They were nice for a month till the inside started pinning and wearing down ALREADY.i DO NOT recommend these slippers. Much Better options for same price .  Update:  they have awesome customer service and sent new pair so will give another update soon
3.0,"Watch is tiny, definitely not a &#34;men's watch&#34;. Good thing I got a little man so I'll give it to him. Not a complete waste..."
3.0,Too big for my face… just fun
3.0,"I like the dress and got it when it was on sale for $9.99. My only complaints are that it's a little long on me even though I'm 5'7, and tying up the back is confusing. I'm a D cup so I'd have to tie it super tight to get a good fit, but then I can't breathe...I'm trying to drop a few lbs anyway so hopefully when I do, the dress will fit a little better. It's very sexy and worth it though."
3.0,Great but but its small pendant but a great accessory
3.0,not as on a picture - i returned it...
3.0,Shades are cheap and trendy. The plastic lenses has already started to crackle.
3.0,"This earring is fine, but note that 16 mm is pretty big for a cartilage hoop. I ended up sending it back because I didn't pay attention to the size. I think all the other hoops I have used in the past were between 10-12 mm."
3.0,"Came with tons of items, hoops, barbells and labre rings. All 16s or smaller probably. But I got these for my lip piercing mainly and the hoops are way to small to fit around my big bottom lip, sucks. But they might work for other ppl."
3.0,Other than the style it doesn’t block out the sun.
3.0,"It is an ok watch, i did not keep it because when I received it the watch is not so impressive like the picture. The picture colors are enhanced, the picture looks amazing and looked like it will stand out but not in person."
3.0,Stones uneven and crooked
3.0,"I'm a newbie at biking, so these were my first pair of shorts.  They were great for my the distances I was going ( 10-20 miles)."
3.0,This runs big but i like the different ways you can wear it...
3.0,The item looked just like the picture but is very small.. works fine for a 10 year old or 12 year old but looks nothing close to an adult size or what the actual dior glasses sizes look like. For $14 i definitely had to return mine.
3.0,"Looks nice, but it seems to wrinkle the instant I put it on. I am really only willing to wear it under a vest."
3.0,"Look nice, wash well and feel good but before your day is over they aren't snug at all until next was"
3.0,"It looks great, although the band is a little narrow for the size of the watch face.  It's also a little light/cheap, and the clasp is now broken after only wearing twice."
3.0,They look like womens pants
3.0,Nice blouse but fit a little too big for a small
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, 8-10 but I decided to get a large based on the reviews I read. The dress is super cute and I'll probably still wear it but it is a little too snug. The fabric doesnt stretch as much as I thought it would"
3.0,"I ordered this dress for halloween to wear with my angle wings and a flower crown. The color was nice but not as nice as the picture. The fit around the waist and chest is great but the sleeves are to puffy looking. Definitely not flattering on a petite girl. Maybe if the sleeves were brought in just a bit it would look nicer overall. The one thing I really liked was the way the V on the neck holds up. Overall, not the best. I gave it away."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt in a size large (I usually wear a medium to large) and was disappointed to find that the chest area is extremely small. I wear a 36DD bra and unfortunately, even sizing up to a large the bust was basically coming apart at the seams (I had the dreaded ""gap"" between buttons when something is too small in the chest). Very cute shirt, but probably won't work if you have a larger chest. Sad to return."
3.0,Gets tarnished
3.0,The dress wrinkles easily
3.0,"Items are nice size and nice in appearance.  My only complaint is there are six stones that I cannot figure out what they are.  All of them are different shades of green.  Also, I did not receive a labradorite."
3.0,I bought two of these. They aren't bad. I wish they were a better fabric. Looking for a 100% cotton turtleneck.
3.0,"I really like this shirt. Unfortunately it is about 3 sizes too small. Since it doesn't come in a larger size, the company was nice enough to refund my money."
3.0,Nice purse but too little for me
3.0,The pendant is cute but the silver doesn't look real.
3.0,"This dress fit as expected everywhere but the length.  I am 5'6&#34; and the dress fell about 4 inches above my ankles, which is way too short for me.  The dress itself is adorable though, nice material and pretty.  I wear a size 6/8 and ordered the medium and it fit great everywhere but the length.  Aside from the length the only other thing that I did not like and did not notice in the pictures was that it had a tie back.  I am not a fan of tie backs.  They always seem to make a dress look more casual. I would have kept it but for those 2 things.  Unfortunately, it will be going back."
3.0,"Overall, it is a nice piece for the price. I was a little disappointed because I ordered a maroon and gold necklace, but what I received was more of a red and gold. It was a gift for a 12 year old that was supposed to be in his school colors. He still liked it though and said it looked like a KC Chiefs necklace instead."
3.0,Wrinkles very hard to get out and keep out. Fits a bit large on me.
3.0,"The material isn’t the softest and I know black fades fast, but never after 2 or 3 washes. They were cute for the few times my son wore them but now use them for craft clothes."
3.0,"The bathing suit was cute! But after one wash, the strap snapped off :/"
3.0,The material just wasn’t as soft as I would’ve hoped for in a jump suit.
3.0,Not true to size. Order at least one size bigger if not two from what size you normally wear.
3.0,Not sure about comfort just yet. Soles are very rigid
3.0,it's ok but not so nice
3.0,"This is an okay bootie, I now own three pairs of the fringed qupid booties, but they are suede, I like the fit of the suede more than the leather, plus this boot was a little too plain for me, I returned this item."
3.0,Be careful around open flame cooking... I have never-ever seen a plastic apron for B-B-Q cooking. Maybe this was made for making salads. Or for sloppy eating...
3.0,"A medium was not a normal medium. I was disappointed in that. It fit more like a SMALL and because of the hassle of sending it back and because I bought it so LONG before Christmas, we just had to deal with it. It was a Christmas present fail. Here my daughter in law was excited to get a NorthFace or whatever they are called jacket and it didn't even fit like it was supposed to."
3.0,I previously ordered one of this company's khaki blazers about a year ago in the very largest option they offered (XL) and it fit perfectly fine. I am very annoyed as this is the SECOND time I have actually tried to purchase this Black Blazer from this company. The first time I took a chance on getting the size I usually wear (a Large) and it was too small; so this time I figured an XL would fit. I ordered the black in the same XL size as my Khaki Blazer and it was WAY too small. I mean I couldn't even hug myself it was that tight of a fit. Very disappointed in the fitting consistency as I doubt even an XXL size option would fit for this black blazer. I am 175 pounds and 5'9 with an athletic physique.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars only because the Khaki version fit so well.
3.0,This did not work well. Wouldn't hold up in my daughter's dress.
3.0,Not the highest quality but is a good backup band.  Additionally the buckle has an extra &#34;loop&#34; that's a little awkward. Fits as expected with size.
3.0,Shipped very quickly.  Product seemed a bit small.  Not sure it really fits.
3.0,Picture appears that they are white with pattern: they are not.  They are clear and the sun comes shining through so I returned them.
3.0,"This is a great idea.  However, the sound made when the button is pressed only remotely sounds like ""yeet"".  My guess is that it was recorded by a non-English speaker."
3.0,cute but ran small
3.0,The white of the fabric was that cheap blueish white and it has a tiny dark rhinestone in the top center of the neckline that people think is dirt or a bug and try to flick it off. Otherwise I like it
3.0,"This is not a midi dress.  Delendi g on your build, it will fall at or above the knee.  Since I prefer below the knee styles, I will need to find d another brand with correct length."
3.0,It was broken<br />When it was delivered
3.0,The item was ok but not what I expected! They appeared to be silver posted but had black studs . Also came with a free pair of studded hearts in which I gave to my gf
3.0,The logo on the bag is attached to bag upside down.
3.0,"I was going this was going to be longer and draped better.  I’m 5’9, 180 and the fabric was not that soft and the latter had huge white polka dots.  Didn’t look like the one in the image.  It wasn’t long enough for me, nor did it have the look I was going for, so I sent it back."
3.0,Not as cute in person then the picture.<br />Length is under knees but above ankles.<br />The split is at hip.  But to me it look like it’s turned around. The arms are tight. If you are skinny it will work for you. My big thick arms no.<br />I wear a 10-12 I got. Lg hoping the arms would be ok
3.0,"Quality of material was nice! Fit a little large, so I returned it."
3.0,"Too big for my face. Bought these cause they were cheap and they were the smallest frames available, but still too big. Bummer. Glasses are fine otherwise so I will try to give them to a friend."
3.0,"I'm 5'10 1/2 and a size 16.  The XL works but would have preferred it to be even bigger.  However, I love it anyway.  Great with jeans, skirts etc.  Wore it for the first time in India.  Very lightweight and easy breezy."
3.0,It arrived broken but I fixed it. It’s really heavy but it’s so modern I just love it.
3.0,"Used the sizing information and even went a step further knowing how Asain sized jerseys tend to run very small, so ordered 3 sizes. This jersey was still nowhere near fitting and has been returned. Quality was very nice if your sizing is available."
3.0,"I got this set through Vine and was not allowed to choose the size. They randomly chose to send me Extra Large.<br /><br />I don't usually purchase sets of clothing which consist of a jacket and pants. This is because I prefer to wear Large on top for a jacket in order to obtain a fit loose enough that it can be worn without constraint over other clothing. If I get the jacket in a size that works for me, then the pants are too big. I normally wear size Medium for pants, whether I purchase women's shorts and long pants or men's elastic-waist, cotton, exercise shorts (which are massively less expensive than the equivalent type of shorts made for women). I thought I would give this set a try anyway, taking a gamble that I might get lucky and both the jacket and the pants might fit me.<br /><br />Technically, by my measurements, I am a size 8 on top and a size 10 on the bottom. Based on that information on sizing, you will probably be as shocked as I was to learn that this supposedly XL jacket is tight enough on me across the shoulders and arms to be somewhat constricting when I am merely wearing a light, cotton t-shirt beneath it.<br /><br />The XL pants, which in any other brand of pants would be falling off of me, are only slightly baggy in the hips and thighs. The elastic waist, which has broad, 2-inch-wide elastic, is only about 6 inches too big at the waist. However, by letting the waistband hang at my hip bones and pulling the drawstring very tight, I can actually manage to keep the pants from falling down.<br /><br />As a result of the poor fit, I wouldn't want to wear this fleece set outside of the house, but inside of the house, they will function sufficiently well for me to wear them as lounging pajamas.<br /><br />If it were possible to order just the pants, instead of a Medium I would order Large. I would not order the jacket at all if that were possible because it is a real problem that an XL does not fit someone whose actual size is Small but prefers to wear size Large.<br /><br />I have not seen for sale anywhere old-fashioned sweatpants in a very long time. They used to be made of a very comfortable, soft, dense, warm, cotton fleece. It seems like every manufacturer of women's workout gear has been trying to get fancy with sweatpants for the past decade and more and, as a result, they are failing to remember that the purpose of sweatpants is to function as comfortable clothing to bend, stretch and vigorously exercise in.<br /><br />These sweatpants are made of a slick-velour fabric that is so relatively lightweight (the manufacturer does admit to it being ""midweight"" ) compared to what one would expect a sweatpant to be made of that the fabric has an almost sleazy feel to it. Most likely that's due to the fact that instead of being 100% cotton knit, it is 60% cotton and 40% polyester.<br /><br />The jacket has a fairly cheap zipper that I had great difficulty fastening and unfastening, and I don't think it is going to last very long without breaking. I don't like the hood either. Ironically, given how relatively lightweight this velour fleece is compared to old-fashioned sweatpants, the hood feels heavy and unwieldy. When I bend over, the weight of it flopping forward onto my shoulders and head is unpleasant.<br /><br />I washed this set in cold water, on delicate cycle, even though normally, with old-fashioned sweatpants, I would wash them on regular cycle. I also hung them up to dry rather than putting them in the dryer. I did this because the sleazy fabric doesn't seem like it could sustain many washings without wearing out. I also wanted to avoid shrinkage since the clothing being undersized was already an issue. This clothing seems to have survived without damage or noticeable wear and tear after being washed in this careful way."
3.0,"Super cute design, but the hat is very tall.  I have an average sized head, and there is no way for me to push the hat down enough onto my head to fill the gap on the inside.  It looks kind of strange and it is noticeable that it's too tall.  The front white part of the hat is made of thick, cushy fabric that has some wrinkles in it.  I tried to steam the wrinkles out but it's not having it.<br /><br />All-in-all, very cute and worth the money, but I won't wear it much."
3.0,They would not stay on my nose! They were cute but I feel like I wasted my money because I can’t use them.
3.0,"looks okay, its very low quality but dose keep your head warm during the cold weather. and it has a zipper pocket and mittens with you see the paw prints for your hands. it dose loose some of the fur when you first get it then it stops.<br /><br />if your on a budget for your kids this okay."
3.0,These were ok.
3.0,"Fabric was very stiff and dull. Looked old. Color, style, and fit were other wise as advertised."
3.0,Super cute but very cheeky! Not sure if family friendly - may return - ordered a medium. Normally a small fit is great just wish more butt coverage
3.0,These are not compression but they are a decent top. They are not long and sit just on hips.
3.0,"The mask is a little big. The material is stretchy. The ear loops feel like they will tear, no reinforcement or stitching. I'm using it as part of a costume and will me putting a n95 under it"
3.0,Quickly turned green around my neck.
3.0,"So there isn't a lot to say about this sort of thing.  It does fit my TicWatch Pro as it advertises and the magnetic ""clasp"" works just great so one can adjust this to fit exactly right since -- contrary to popular designers' beliefs -- not every human arm is exactly the same size or shape.  There is one thing though that is so unpleasant I have to knock off two stars for:  it doesn't actually have any give on the watch itself where it snaps in.  The metal of the band goes tight against the edges of the watch and can't move at all.  That means it sticks straight out on each side a fair bit instead of moving down to fit comfortably on your arm.  If you have a thicker arm than I do perhaps this is no big deal, but for me this makes it significantly less comfortable.  I will probably have to use a rotary tool to trim mine a bit to give it more leeway on each end."
3.0,Usually  Grace Karen dresses fit perfectly. These in particular  run small. Order a size up.
3.0,"This dress is so cute, but the material holds such a static charge it's crazy. Doesn't matter how much softener or hair spray or (insert hack here) I use, it clings and sticks like mad. Which just makes me so sad because I adore this dress paired with my grey stockings and cardigan for work.<br /><br />The neckline did stretch out after about a month and doesn't seem to quiet ever go back to shape."
3.0,Runs a smidge small. I got a large according to the sizing chart and it’s snug
3.0,this wrinkles in the suitcase badly. I couldn't wear it without ironing
3.0,It's disappointing to see what I saw on the monitor and what I saw in person. I can't feel the characteristics of platinum.
3.0,It's a great looking bad and very functional but the strap is beginning to shrewd only after 2 weeks and minimal usage.
3.0,I thought it would be a little longer but it's not it actually fits like a very very short vest
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter for christmas based on what she had put on her wish list. She's 9, but I assumed, since they're chokers that they would still fit her. About half of them did, but the others were too big. She'll grown into them and wanted to keep them. She also shares them with her older sister, so they aren't going to waste."
3.0,Handbags was lacking pins or feet to help support stance to sit up.
3.0,"The fit is good, but I'm not the tiniest girl around (12) and the material stretches so much that I feel super chunky. The pattern is so distorted that it accentuates the bad areas that it stretches over."
3.0,"Product shipped via DHL , who lost it in their own facility for 8 days ! Then turned over to USPS who took another 5 days to get it the last 82 miles ! Took just short of 3 weeks to get from Ohio to TN.<br />DHL & USPS-a real pair of service providers!"
3.0,Great polarized glasses. The frame is made of a material that flexes so it does not break easily.<br />I used to break a pair of sunglasses every few months. The Imrider was tough and no more broken sunglass.<br />Reason I am writing this review is because I am buying 2 more so I have them handy in my cars and sports bag.<br /><br />After owning these glasses for about a year I found that the ear piece has a rubberized sleeve that sides over the frame. When it gets warm the sleeve gets soft and slides out of the frame. I had to use some cement to hold it in place. I lost one of the sleeve. Mfg should come up with a solution. Because of this I am downgrading the product to 3 stars.
3.0,Way too big for what I needed them for. Alright quality and arrived in good shape tho.
3.0,It's cute but definitely not a size 7. Cute as a statement not for constant wearing. Definitely on trend though.
3.0,It fits Ok but it could be a bi better
3.0,"nice bras but they are so tight to get on, took l/2 hr to get the bra off. sorry,"
3.0,"I was supposed to use this for a patriotic photo shoot…Honestly, it didn't seem like you could really make out the eagle that well and I didn't find the crystals very sparkly and couldn't make out the color. But it's a pretty piece, just not for my needs."
3.0,I like the shirt but the sleeve is not sewn together -there is about a 2 inch hole in the seam after first wash I noticed it. Runs big. Washes nicely wrinkle free.
3.0,"I like that it onset look cheap. However, I find this earrings extremely difficult to put on. And so for that reason im rating it three stars because I have try to put them on and couldn't and went with other earrings. So I feel that it should be mention a way to put them or at least describe that is tricky to put on. Other than that, the earrings look great quality."
3.0,quality is good but size is small. For &#34;S&#34; size I will recommend to buy &#34;M&#34;
3.0,"Received item a little late, but finally arrived.  It was as advertised and should serve it's purpose."
3.0,"I ordered these sunglasses because I enjoy the retro shaped lens and overall style of them. I wish they were just a bit larger because I prefer my sunglasses to be oversized. The description states these sunglasses are oversized, and upon receiving them I didn't feel they were oversized enough for me. I returned them and received a refund immediately. While these might be great for someone looking for a normal-sized pair of retro frames, I'm still on the hunt for a great pair of truly oversized sunglasses!"
3.0,Decent coat. Fits my brother good but the quality is not the best. One of the pockets ripped the first day he wore it. We were able to exchange which was really great but we realized the coat and fabric are just of a cheaper material. We like the look of it.
3.0,They are not light weight
3.0,"The necks stretch out and come loose, of that bothers you like me it's a 1 star if doesn't bother you it's a 5 star product"
3.0,Very shiny plastic.
3.0,"It is very pretty, however, the chain broke the first time I wore it."
3.0,"I like it, but my guy says I look like I'm swimming in it.  I think that's the way it's supposed to look."
3.0,They were good till a hail storm hit and ruined the lenses after three weeks of having them
3.0,It said waterproof on the ad but when I received  it it says water recestance there is a difference this shows misrepresentation
3.0,"I like these gloves, they seem to get my hands nice and warm. The only problem is that they are loose around the wrists but get super tight around the fingers and the palms of my hands, so it's a little uncomfortable. I do like the way they look, they are a bit thicker but it is worth the extra warmth that you get. I can say that the price is not worth what you get because they are one size."
3.0,I have had to re-sew the straps because they come apart.It is lined and hangs nicely.
3.0,I think you might need a long torso to wear this because the hip seams were at my thighs. It might be worth getting tailored if you need something simple for an office job because its comfortable and the material is breathable.
3.0,"Like the look and design but it is a little snug. I only have two credit cards, an ID and a insurance card in it and it's snug with no cash in it. I may have to use a money clip for my cash."
3.0,"Most women I know where flat sandals with maxi dresses, but I would've had to wear 3-4"" heels with this one (and hemming it would've cost more than the dress itself).  I'm a little over 5'7"", normally wear an L-XL in shirt and a 16W or 18 in pants and the XXL was also too far for me in the waist/hips. Material was like a nice t-shirt, but not sure how it would wear over time with washing."
3.0,Cute but attracts lint like crazy n has some puilling after two washes.
3.0,"The dress is really pretty, definitely a hit at the wedding I attended. But when I received it, it was almost a full length sleeve and almost floor length. I had to alter it to make it look more like the picture. The silver material snagged easily on my jewelry, bummer. Measurement reference: I am 115 lbs, 5'5"" tall, 32C bust, usually wear a 2 or 4. I ordered a small (4-6) and would say even for a 4-6, this runs very large in length, but fit well in the bodice."
3.0,They are to big but fit with a pair of stockings and socks too she loves the sound they make when she rubs them together they lose a lot of glitter too
3.0,I was really excited to get this but it was so incredibly big I had to return it. It was nice material and I loved the colors just way to big. I typically wear XL
3.0,"These run a bit small. The material is stiff and uncomfortable. Nothing wrong with the material, it is just the kind it is and its a matter of preference. My husband said he will not wear them. I'm going to see if I can return them."
3.0,"Super cute, comfy and light weight, but ordered too small"
3.0,The front is high wasted but the back is not.  Every time I bend over my butt crack is exposed!
3.0,"Runs small had to return, seemed to be a nice product, didn’t have a larger size in return"
3.0,"Good quality, but a bit small.  Good for a child a lady or if you have skinny forearms.  I am an average sized man 5'11 and 170 lbs and I could not fasten the latches around the forearms."
3.0,"RECEIVED ORDER JUST AS I THOUGHT, BUT WISHED IT HAD SOME USE HINTS....HAVEN'Y USED YET  WE WILL SEE"
3.0,Not tight
3.0,"This looks like colored glass and it's got sharp edges on the wire, most especially a sharp edge on the wire at the top of the ""stone"" which faces back toward the chest, which could damage clothing. I can't recommend this. It's not the worst I've seen, but it's nowhere near good enough. For this type of item, it's average, sadly, as many are not that good, but I recommend looking elsewhere for one that doesn't have sharp edges. Good luck in your search."
3.0,nice bracelets but i thought i was buying saworvski crystals. just a little to gaudy for my taste. nice if your into big jewlery
3.0,"Only 3 stars. All four look OK, but I tried to attach one to my purse, and the little chain broke first, and then the rabbit's foot came off of the metal car/holder.  I dont know how to reattach. This was on the first day I got them, so they were not mis-used or worn out."
3.0,Footbed is very comfy.....top does not hug my foot the way I'd hoped and hoping that whole piece softens up with wear as it is a little stiff and wide at the base of my toes.  Love the color.
3.0,"PROS: Good fit, warm, waterproof. CONS: Absorb water instead of repel. Need to dry out if outside exposed to water."
3.0,Shows every bump everywhere 😳
3.0,The dress was a light silver not dark grey as pictured on order.
3.0,they to lose on me
3.0,Product is good but scratches easily
3.0,"I purchased this shirt a size larger than I would normally purchase, and it gaps at the chest. Runs about a size and a half too small. Buy larger if you want to avoid button gap."
3.0,"This dress is a great deep pigmented blue with poofy sleeves, an A-cut waist, and an extremely long skirt, a la Amish community. I love the top, which fits well and doesn't roll around or feel scratchy, the poofy sleeves are easy to adjust and hit right about elbow length, but the skirt is incredibly long and it's cut to really make you look like you're pregnant and/or have abnormally large hips. The top is flattering, but the rest is just tent size.  It's a well made dress, it's just too generous of a cut to look great on everyone."
3.0,It’s a nice looking band but it is not a grey color-it’s a beige/yellow color-not at all how it is pictured.
3.0,Got this for my husband who wear xl. Had to give to my sister who wear a L in womens. Very soft. Good quality 👌.
3.0,Thin material fabric is thin and looks bad
3.0,"I really don’t like giving bad reviews but I feel a need to regarding this purchase.  I sent this necklace to my sister for her birthday. We live  hours away from each other so I paid extra to have the necklace gift wrapped and sent directly to her home. It arrived quickly, on time the day of her birthday but the problem was...the necklace was packaged in a tiny ziplock bag and completely separate from the decorative box!!  Why?? I don’t understand. That’s the reason I chose this because I liked what I thought would be the presentation and the funny sentiment on the box. The necklace should’ve been sent to her displayed in the box. Very disappointing. She still likes it, it’s a lovely necklace, nice quality. But, really ruined it by just throwing it in separately still in the baggie after I paid for gift wrapping. I’ll try to attach the photo my sister sent me of it in the condition it arrived."
3.0,Not a bad looking belt but it looks and feels like plastic
3.0,Okay. Not what I was expecting  for the fabric. I did return.
3.0,"Quality is nice and fabric is adorable. The reason for 3 stars is that it is very short waisted so does not fit like the photo represents. I am average build and thin and the elastic  “waist” falls right under my breasts. I will wear it around the house, but it isn’t flattering to wear out like that."
3.0,"These arrived in a very nice case..they are very strong plastic, good quality and well made.  They feel comfortable on my face  , the only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the tint.  I don't like the fact you can see my eyes..I prefer a tint to be darker."
3.0,"Upon receipt my initial reaction was that we need to find another dress My daughter liked it.<br /><br />I got this for my 17 yr old daughter's homecoming. It was so thin and flimsy I thought it would simply look tacky. I bought her another dress that she hated so we went with this one since I hadn't returned it yet.<br /><br />The fit was fine, she is  145 lbs, 5'6, 34D, 28/29 waist and we ordered a medium. The material is a bit see through but we bought skin tone under garment's to combat that.  This dress has to be accessorized to be brought to life. Once u are done up hair, make up, shoes and jewelry the simple elegance in the dress is brought out and u see why the ladies in the review pics look so good in theirs. My daughter looked beautiful once the look was complete. Overall I recommend this dress for ladies who have imagination and can see the potential in a piece because ur going to need it."
3.0,"This is a pretty necklace but the chain is so fine that I am sure it will break very easily. In addition, it is the type of chain that you can't kink or &#34;fold&#34; or it will break. It purchased it as a gift and will tell them that they will need to get a different chain for it. The &#34;stone&#34; actually seems to be a very thin piece and almost appears that it might be plastic, feels like plastic and looks a bit fake. It even had a flat spot on the face of it so you could see that it was extremely thin and glued on. It is sterling silver and pretty but I would not have purchased it if I had seen it &#34;in person.&#34;"
3.0,"The design is beautiful. The material feels a little on the starchy side. I hope that once I wash it, it will be more flowy and soft."
3.0,The Earrings look nicer in the picture.
3.0,"There is a thick lining in a portion of the top on the front that is very noticeable. It's like a panel. I have no idea why it's there because the dress is not sheer at all. For some reason there is a flap of material that lines the neckline and the sleeves. Unfortunately, I can't wear the dress until that piece of fabric is removed. It looks like I have a ruler sitting horizontally across my bra. It shows through like a panty line. I bet it will be stunning once I have it fixed."
3.0,Gold plated but does not look like other gold plated jewelry or real gold jewelry. Stones  were beautiful and it was well made. I returned it.
3.0,"I love so much about this bag.  It has great structure, great fabric, well designed, etc.  However, I purchased it specifically because it has a sleeve to adhere the bag to my wheeled suitcase when I am traveling.  The major design flaw is that the sleeve is not wide enough to slip the bag over the handle of my Travelpro carry-on suitcase.  The opening to slip over the handle of my suitcase is about an inch too short.  Thus, this great bag is being returned.  But if you don't need it to fit onto your suitcase, it is a great bag otherwise."
3.0,Was an okay purse just a little cheap. I got what I paid for.
3.0,Cute earrings. Unfortunately they’re not gold colored like they show in the picture. they’re  silver.
3.0,Love the material but they run really small.
3.0,Great product loved the colors and quality.
3.0,Great buy except that the top &#34;knob&#34; is white. I thought it was silver. The white plastic &#34;knob&#34; made it look cheap.
3.0,Not as pretty as expected.
3.0,"For the positives - the color of the shirt is really nice and the fleece lining and flannel are super soft.  Unfortunately, I purchased a large based on the size chart and it is way too big.  I'm 5'7&#34; and weigh about 134# with a 34 bust size - I wish I would have ordered a medium."
3.0,"I like the design of Pattyboutik tops but as many of this brand's tops, it is too long for a top.  I had to alter the length of some of the other tops I bought from Pattyboutik but didn't want to do it anymore."
3.0,If u dont exactly fit the measurements then itll be off. It's kinda stretchy but not allot of give
3.0,"I ordered according to the size chart. My measurements are 40”x33”x40”.<br />Cons: Although the bust was perfect for size, the rest of the dress is much too large.<br />As the picture shows, the shoulders of the dress were very wide.<br />The seams on the chest were pretty prominent.<br />I had to return this and did not re-order smaller size.<br />Pros: For someone with more conservative measurements, this dress would probably fit great.<br />I liked the length, it hit me mid-shin.<br />The material is good quality.<br />The blue color was vivid, just as shown in product views.<br />Overall: If this fit more slender in the shoulders, I’d be keeping this."
3.0,this ring does not fit any of my fingers at all no size thing yall should get one you will get more money if u do
3.0,Sheds
3.0,"Very cute design but ran a bit small. Kiddo only wore it a few times because it was too snug around the neck. It shrunk a bit on my initial wash but it is stretchy material. Also, wish the ends were sewed."
3.0,a little small for my arm
3.0,The belt I received was black so I had to get another belt to wear with the dress.
3.0,"I didn't like the fabric of the sleeves. They reminded me of a polyester screen print. The shirt fit snug and was not loose at the bottom (stomach area) as I had hoped. It wasnt a bad shirt for the price, just not one I cared for."
3.0,"I like these, but they are a little big on me"
3.0,Double see through lining on bodice.  Pretty but runs a bit large. Never heard of the name brand before but seems like pretty good quality.
3.0,Made all in one mold. Hence strap is same material as sandal. Somewhat aggravating to wear.
3.0,"Definitely read the reviews. This piece fits very small. The fabric is also a very cheap and extremely shiny polyester. It did not look good, altogether."
3.0,These are really tiny so I returned them.
3.0,"A decent dress with warmer materi than I was expecting (but good especially for after you leave the party). Only complaint is that the sleeves were too short to really be a long-sleeve, but too long to be 3/4 length."
3.0,Stretches out easily
3.0,Daughter loved this Christmas gift…but after wearing it once….rhinestones started falling off of it
3.0,"Product seems somewhat small, almost think of in terms of junior sizing, not misses/women's sizing."
3.0,Washed twice and the buttons started falling off. The bottoms are cheaply made and fit odd. The fabric is really the only nice thing about this set.
3.0,"The fabric is really nice and light, but the shape of the dress is pretty boxy. I returned it."
3.0,Face of the watch is a lot darker than in the picture. Nice size. Great quality for the price. Definitely does not feel like a high quality watch. I use it as my back up watch if something happens to my daily smart watch (like I forget to charge my smart watch).
3.0,ONE USE GARBAGE
3.0,"Each pattern is pretty. They are sturdy yet breathable.  Unfortunately, they are also different sizes. Some fit perfectly and some I needed to handwash and attempt to stretch out."
3.0,"Well the pants definitely do as they’re told - they make your butt look bomb. My husband loves how my butt looks in them. They do run a little small though and I wish they were higher waisted. For me (5’4”, petite curvy build) they come up right to my belly button and then cut into my belly fat, making it a little uncomfortable. The mesh is also a little itchy on the legs. And I wish the crotch didn’t go right down the middle, it does give a slight camel toe. Overall I’d give three stars. I’ll likely really only wear them for my hubby and would wear more comfortable ones I have otherwise."
3.0,Seemed great but clasp broke upon putting it on. Then coco beads flew everywhere. May have been my fault.
3.0,It does work..but once it is dirty..I think you just throw it away. I could not find any info regarding if it could be washed with other laundry and reused. It didn't seem with it to me since it is just a disposable product.
3.0,"I’m giving these tank tops 3 stars because they do fit as expected however, I specifically ordered them because they were described as “compression” tank tops. They are not compression tanks at all. They are simply a thin poly/spandex blend. They are still great for working out but not exactly the type I was looking for."
3.0,"While I am happy with the 100% cotton knit, and the shark graphic is super cool, I am disappointed with the fit of these UNACOO Boys 2-Pack Short Sleeve T-Shirts. As soon as you unfold them from the package you will be like, on no! They look tiny! I picked up the XL for my 11 year old son and they should have fit him, as boys XL from other popular retailers work well and even offer my son room to grow. Not the case with these UNACOO T's. These fit him like a sausage skin! The sleeves are oddly short and the body hits him right at the top of his pants. The shoulders are stretched tight across his back so he looks like the hulk ready to bust out of his clothing!  My son is tall for his age, but very slim. The XL should have fit him! I see on the fabric care label that the size is 11/12T. In the U.S. the T usually means toddler. Boys sizes are usually labeled with a Y for youth. These are made in China and something is definitely off with the sizing! These will go to his little sister who will wear them for playing outside. The sleeves look better suited for a girl anyway as they are cut like a cap sleeve and on a boy just look ridiculous. I will say I really appreciate the 100% cotton knit, and these shirts actually look and feel like the 100% cotton knit that they are labeled to be! I've received many items of clothing from Amazon retailers that claim to be cotton and then a flame retardant polyester knit shows up! Bottom line, size up with these T's, or better yet, just grab the XL and let your younger child grow into them, but if like me, your boy is at the end of the size chart, I'd pass!"
3.0,Material is not very comfortable.
3.0,"Love the feel and comfort of the sandel, but way too loose to stay on my feet well!"
3.0,Ordering again because I love the look. But be aware these are “very” fragile. Mine broke 2 hours after opening the pack. Had it on my shirt pocket and lifted a pack of bread off the shelf that hit them and they broke.
3.0,"These are now put together a little differently.  The maple leaf hangs at the same place as the colored beads, not slightly below (there is no longer an extra circle attached as pictured).  I preferred the earrings as picture as it's too bunchy with them all at the same level.  Don't know if that's an anomaly with what I got or the way it is for all of them."
3.0,"Disappointed; the face isn't crystal clear, making the dial hard to see."
3.0,The black fabric is nice and soft but the collar is made of dress shirt fabric. It sticks up stiffly and wouldnt lay flat. Its nice otherwise.
3.0,Very thick material.
3.0,Quality is not very good at all. Pieces fell apart
