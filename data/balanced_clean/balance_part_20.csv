5.0,You will need to wear a tank top underneath this. It’s beautiful with great length. Perfect to pair with leggings!
5.0,Just like the picture. It's perfect. Thank you Amazon.
5.0,I have nueropathy and these are a godsend! Love them. So cushiony and warm. I will buy again when needed.
5.0,These appear to be an excellent match are good quality.
5.0,I loved the variety that I received and so did my niece and nephew. Will be ordering again soon for their spring and summer crocs. Thanks again
5.0,"I bought this Necklace for my sister, for Christmas she loves hot pink color and hearts. She said it was pretty, cool detail too it."
5.0,I'm very happy with the product.  It wasn't expensive but seemed like pretty good quality.  I'd buy it again if it accidentally was destroyed in a particle accelerator accident.
5.0,Perfect !! ... Exactly what I expected ... Thank you and God Bless
5.0,"These were big when I first received, but after washing fit fine.  I think they have better traction than Gaiam, wash for wash. Would be great if colors other than gray.  Hold plank on reformer without shifting on foot."
5.0,Neat! Hubby has not taken it off:)
5.0,i ordered a small and am 5’3 and 120lbs it fits like a crop top goes just a lil above my belly button but the material is like a cotton knit type of material its really cozy and cute the shoulder area of the shirt didnt itch or bother me at all it didnt feel like i was being choked by the shirt i think its a great buy and even if you have different bust size the shirt is stretchy enough to where its still gonna fit you nice
5.0,I like it...it fits perfectly.
5.0,I was very surprised with the quality of this dress! It is a nice soft fabric that isn't too thin or too thick. Very happy!
5.0,"Love the bag, I was a little reluctant to buy this bag as it dint have any reviews. Worth the price, perfect size and nice quality."
5.0,These were very cute and very soft.  The baby does not seem to mind and they keep her feet warm.
5.0,Love this product!. It's elastic bands on the back make it  very easy to fit different sizes comfortably. The metal buckles and metal tips on the belt are real metal with a nice gloss finish.
5.0,"I value organization and workmanship and made this purchase based on those two aspects. The bag is very nicely made because it organizes the space you have and has many niches to place items.  I am using this bag solely for nursing work and I like the fact that it is not heavy and bulky to carry.  The material is also to a large extent waterproof, but I wouldn't leave it in the snow or rain to test this theory.  The shoulder pad strap is also a nice add-on to offset the stress of any weight you put on your shoulders."
5.0,"This ring is perfect. It is stamped with the “real silver” stamp, (925) and will not turn green. Great buy."
5.0,"Factory band, as advertised.  Perfect fit."
5.0,the watch arrived on time and working perfectly. The fit and finish on this blue lagoon is extremely nice and the blue color is a very beautiful shade of blue. I think this will be one of the most desired Seiko's. The time keeping is also very accurate for an automatic Seiko. So far its been around 3 seconds fast in a day and that's impressive to me. I would recommend this limited addition Seiko if you like turtles and like this beautiful blue dial. Everything lines up in t he chapter ring are and the ratcheting is firm but smooth.
5.0,They looked just as I expected and were really cute! Highly recommend.
5.0,very cute i love it
5.0,Beautiful bumble bee. I put it on a chain around my neck and receive many compliments. It's the perfect size and has plenty of sparkle.
5.0,"I LOVE IT!  Although it does not have the sparkle as shown in the picture, it is still a very nice charm and fits perfectly on my Pandora bracelet."
5.0,I've been looking for a cardigan just like this for months in stores. Everything was either too expensive for the quality or too hot. This is absolutely perfect!!!
5.0,Extremely comfy shirt that covers me where I want it to.
5.0,I bought these earrings my girlfriend as a Valentines Day gift they were flawless in the cut and size as well is the shape they gleamed in the kight my girlfriend loves them
5.0,"Use for small cleaning jobs where just washing instead doesn’t seem enough.  These are a little longer than some and cover wrist fir me.  These are loose, which again is great for small jobs."
5.0,"Firstly yes these do make the world yellow, they are yellow lenses....<br />If you find the glare of oncoming cars and streetlights hard on your eyes the yellow lens might help. I find them very nice to drive with at night especially when there are a lot of lights.<br />So in short they worked for me, but it is personal."
5.0,Fit as expected and a decent material for the gym and around the house. Good buy.
5.0,"Soft, comfortable. Arrived when expected. Washes well. It's one of my favorites nowadays."
5.0,Nice collection.

5.0,I definitely love it.
5.0,I absolutely love these! They look great and feel great! One thing- this is actually the second pair I buy because it seems like one is normally more lose than the other and it easily falls off. (Hopefully that was easy to understand) They are super cute though!
5.0,"Wow, this set is even prettier in person. I received mine three days earlier. Thanks."
5.0,Beautiful ring very reasonably priced. My daughter-in-law simply loved it!

5.0,Such great colors and well made! My flower girls wore them and they were perfect!
5.0,Love how dark they are and the matte finish us nice. These look great on my husband and on me!
5.0,"This product is for my wife.  It's as described, as far as we can tell.  Since it's cold where we live, we can't vouch for how it absorbs sweat.  She has tried several different ways to wear it, and they fit.  We've only opened 2 at this point and we didn't notice any manufacturing flaws."
5.0,The kids love these bracelets.  Clever idea and packaging.  I have bought several 4 packs and have not received any duplicates.  Great for the money.  Well made.
5.0,lve it
5.0,"Super cute one piece. I love that the straps aren't crossed in the back (I get tension headaches) and the ruching on the side is nice. Good coverage on the booty, and I like the built in shelf bra."
5.0,I appreciate these slippers so much that I purchased a second pair in another color. These fit as expected and are very comfortable. They are warm enough in the winter and cool enough in the summer. Highly recommended.<br /><br />I wear these around the house. Not a single stitch has failed.

5.0,"I got the 2 pack of the rainbow and the black. I have small wrists, and although I need to tighten these almost all the way, they do fit! I use them with my Garmin 245 music. The two bands came with the quick release pins and were super easy to install. The bands are comfortable and the rainbow one is fun :)"
5.0,"Gorgeously crafted fully mechanical day,date,month watch with pocketwatch capability"
5.0,I have received several compliments on this necklace.
5.0,We don't use these in heavy rotation so they have held up beautifully.  they are thick and look nice.
5.0,"My wife likes this Funlingo sweater. She normally wears an XL and this fits great. The sleeves are long, the stitching looks even.  The material is medium weight. Overall it’s a very nice sweater for the price."
5.0,"Not see through, super soft, I got one size fits all and it fits great."
5.0,I lke the softand breathable material. I am taking it on vacation to the tropics

5.0,It came as expected and my son teenage son loves it.
5.0,I really like this purse a lot.<br />Great quality for the price.
5.0,exactly what my baby girl wanted
5.0,"My daughter plays Vipereine Gorgan on YouTube channel creativeprincess2012. Her caracter has pet vipers.  Her costume has sewn in vipers so I wasn't sure what we can use, then I found this cool necklace which was perfect.  It really looks good in person and wAs perfect for what we needed.  Highly recommend buying this necklace,"
5.0,"Washes beautifully over and over again AND it comes with washable filter! Nose pinch to snug around top of nose. Quality Product! Ive bought more expensive, monogrammed masks From another vendor that came with NO filter, no nose pinch and really flimsy!"
5.0,Bought these for my son and he loves them!
5.0,Nice and roomy- got quickly with dust cover. I love my new bag!!
5.0,"It's cheap insurance. I'm always dropping my sunglasses and scratching the lenses. This eliminates that problem. One word of advice though, take off sunglasses while eating. Having them on your neck catches all the crumbs."
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable material."
5.0,Adorable Charms!!!! Wonderful variety for jewelry making!!!!
5.0,"Ben's wife here. I have tiny wrists, so this fits ok. If you don't, it won't work. It's a little bendy, but I'm afraid it would break if you really pushed it."
5.0,"The creeper is cool, took a couple weeks before it didn't startle me anymore. Hung it on the back slider, scared everyone.👍"
5.0,"Excellent boot socks. Cushy, warm, comfortable, resist wrinkling, and promise to be durable. They have enough wool to absorb and wick moisture and suppress odor."
5.0,I am very satisfied with the ring. My girlfriend loves it!!
5.0,SUPER CUTE!
5.0,"They call this a “Dress Watch” but if you like Bling as much as I do, you can wear it anytime, dressed up or dressed down. I have a large wrist and was unsure if it would fit well, but it does – YAY! I’ve had watches in the past where I’ve had to have additional links installed in this type of band but these were more expensive watches, where they’re skimpy with the genuine metals. I would say though, if you have a small wrist you’re probably going to have to wear it a little looser (bracelet style) or have some of the links taken out (if that’s possible or worth it?).<br /><br />This watch definitely looks more expensive than it is and has nice big numbers that are easy to read.  I also appreciate the solid fold-over clasp with a double push button safely on it. The Rose Gold isn’t cheap looking and although I’m not sure what type of metal it’s made from, I wore it for about 5 hours today and had no irritation or allergic reaction on my wrist (which I can be susceptible to nickel blends). As far as water resistance goes, the sales page say’s it’s good for 100ft, but then goes on to say it’s not suitable for swimming or bathing. Personally, I just wouldn’t chance it.<br /><br />It actually came set with the correct time and It also comes in a nice little metal box for storing or gift giving. It’s just so Pretty and Blingy and I definitely would have no hesitation recommending this lovely timepiece.  Thank-you"
5.0,"This is my first set of sunglasses where I can change the lens. So far my favorite is blue. It's a great feature if you get tired of wearing the same thing every day. The swapping process is easy and intuitive. The band is comfortable but a little on the tight side for me, but I do have a large head.<br /><br />Riding with these is great. The provide good coverage and UV blocking.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I purchased this item with a coupon provided by the manufacturer that reduced the cost to $0. The purpose being for me to provide a review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review."
5.0,"So far, so good. I got these for my son’s shoes who’s constantly dragging and tripping over them. His laces were always coming undone. He really loves the ease of putting on his shoes now."
5.0,"Fits perfectly, feels soft as expected, glad I purchased it for the warm weather. Definitely recommend buying it."
5.0,Gave as a gift- They loved them!
5.0,Absurdly cute.
5.0,Great shoes; exactly what I was expecting.
5.0,This is the cutest bowtie ever. I’m doing a sprinkle for my daughter. And I ordered a teddy bear. It came with a tan bell which I did not like. So I ordered this bowtie to put around the teddy bear. And have balloons hooked on the teddy bear behind it. It is adorable. And he can actually wear that bell when he gets much older. I would highly recommend this bowtie
5.0,I was tired of other badge holders and lanyards breaking. This lanyard and badge holder look great and feel like they'll last forever! Shipping was super fast too!
5.0,So cute!! Definitely waterproof too. Durable.

5.0,Me encanto esta hermosa y de buena calidad
5.0,Fits just right and I received the package fast
5.0,I like how it stretched the shoe.  I have feet issues.  Really need wide shoes.  They really stretched the shoes.
5.0,"I didn't think of these being one size fits all but I am so greatly pleased these fit my smaller frame. I have never had Compression Boxers before but am SOLD on these. Great support, comfort and style all at an unbeatable price."
5.0,This dress was much prettier than I expected.  I was figuring I'd have to return it but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm a true size 14 and about 5'6&#34;.  It's long but I wanted it long.  I am very high wasted and about a 36 DD.  It fits perfectly and looks great.  It's not too see through (being it's a white background).  The V-neck isn't too low and the side slits aren't too high.  It's very pretty...hippy chic.  It's a keeper!
5.0,This dress is GREAT!!! It’s very flattering. I highly recommend for the price. Of course it’s not Nordstrom’s quality but for the price it was a pleasant surprise. I’m 5’4” and 120 lbs and I ordered the SMALL
5.0,"These are so soft and comfortable, but are easy to dress up with a cute top for going out!"
5.0,"very good price, love this product."
5.0,The bag is a good size I used for a 17 day trip across Spain. It carry on but larger size so I checked it. Worked as intended. Nice looking bag didn’t break. Recommend because the wheels are sturdy. I had ten year old Samsonite and the wheels dry rotted and were loose. This bag seemed to have same system or better than last bag. For carryon some airlines may not allow as a carry on bag.
5.0,"Beautiful.  Perfect for any occasion.  Just in time for winter.  Arrived fast and packaged properly.<br />It is small, but all snowflakes are.  If you get one, you will not be disappointed."

5.0,"Nice fit, washable, my daughter likes them."
5.0,Love it super soft great fit

5.0,I really needed a good anti fog product since I wear glasses with the masks.  The product didn’t disappoint.  I was very satisfied and would purchase again.
5.0,"They fit perfect! They are a nice fit if you have wider calves, which I do. Seem like a pretty nice quality for the price"
5.0,"So gorgeous!  I haven't worn a bikini in over 10 years, due to extra skin left over from having a baby.  I figured I'd give this a try.  I am 5'6&#34; and about 153lbs.  I normally wear a 10 and I'm a 34D.  I bought the XL and it fit perfectly!  Can't wait to wear it on my upcoming cruise!"
5.0,Great quality and the product is as colorful as in the picture.
5.0,I love quotes that say a lot in a few words. This sums it up for me.
5.0,This jacket is very comfortable. I ride it in the 80.F weather without a sweat. It’s super stylish and has a lot of zip up pockets. It’s a windbreaker with level 1 padding. I’ll buy it again. I am 6’0” and weight about 180lbs. I have an XL and it fits PERFECT.
5.0,Well made and prettier than the picture
5.0,I absolutely love the sunglasses!
5.0,Very cute and nice!  Recommended!
5.0,Ummm do not hesitate....get it!!! If wanna look boujee on a budget like seriously get it. This belt is beautiful! The G part is more brassy than the real thing but honestly to me its fine It looks great and fits perfectly if you wanna get that snatched waist. The logo also looks very legit! Hands down one of the best kept secrets on Amazon!
5.0,Fits as expected. Supports well even if pads are taken out. Like the criss cross. Would buy again.
5.0,The most important option for me is hypoallergenic material and it really is!<br />I just struggle with opening the earrings

5.0,Very helpful to use at night if you require a lot of lotions and creams. Very comfortable and easy to wash.
5.0,Got it for my wife and it fit perfect
5.0,Fits nice on my daughter and I. We fight over it - Recommend - Comfy and Stylish
5.0,I love the NON-SLIP CLIP LOOP Design. I have had Eyeglasses string holders that slip on to the end of the glasses. The problem is that they slip off while you are wearing them. I also love all of the great colors.
5.0,My four year old granddaughter loved this gift. I did have to reorder twice because it runs very large! We ended up with the size 2-3 and she typically wears a 5.
5.0,My father absolutely loved it! It fit great and the quality is amazing!

5.0,"Fit great. Love the idea, wonderful for those who coulxnt wear band before due to risk of injury or not wanting to ruin their band at work. I love it for me but really hoping to get my husband to wear it. We will see."
5.0,Love these boots!  Got them in white also.  Throw in a high heel insole and you can wear them all day long like a tennis shoe.  They look awesome and I get compliments on them every time I wear them
5.0,My 14 year old loves them. He plays first base and at a lot of parks first base faces West and when the sun is going down these glasses help a lot. Great value!
5.0,Great replacement lens
5.0,I got these for my seven year old grandson to wear at an NFL football game because he is sensitive to loud noise.  These worked beautifully and he was very HAPPY.  They fit very well and the carry bag that came with it is a mini backpack to hold the earphones so he was able to carry them easily on his own and is great for storage.
5.0,"I lost my originals on vacation and needed to replace them, a gift from my husband two years ago, and I love these!  Ray ban no longer makes them and sent me the incorrect styles, so I was thankful these would be exactly image and they were!"
5.0,For our granddaughter’s 2 nd birthday... a hundred ways to play!
5.0,comodas y las tallas son reales
5.0,Great watch. and the price was also great.<br />.
5.0,Great quality.  Feels soft too. My 4 year old loves it.
5.0,I love anything related to the moon and stars. I'd also been wanting a trendy pair of tassel earrings. These earrings fit the bill and they are even more beautiful in real life. They're eye-catching and comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them.
5.0,"I just received this dress to day, and I love it.  The product description and picture is accurate.  The fabric is not like the  typical cotton African print fabric.  The fabric is stretchy but it allows for a better fit.  I also purchased the African print high waisted skirt from this seller."
5.0,❤
5.0,perfect if you work in child care so easy to clean being made of plastic and the don't lose shape after being cleaned like cloth ones.
5.0,Too small in the waist. Didn’t realize a size X-large is really a large. If you need an x-large buy a xx-large. Material and style is really nice.
5.0,We got this for my stepson for one of his Christmas gifts. He loves it.
5.0,"A little bit short in the torso, and the cups sometimes need adjusting but overall I love this suit. Got tons of compliments. A bit cheeky and some sideboob, but all in all a very sexy one piece."
5.0,Very nice top everyone loves it
5.0,So happy with these!!
5.0,"Sized up. Would have been TOO SHORT in front if I had bought in my regular size. Quite long in the back, though"
5.0,Very  flattering. Absolutely love this dress. Was hard to tell when I ordered it if I would like the pattern—it’s great! Wore this to a summer wedding reception—it was perfect.
5.0,Great fit I wore it for my daughter birthday pay
5.0,"This purse has exceeded my expectations! It's a little smaller than I normally carry, but I couldn't be happier."
5.0,"Soft material, great fit, perfect pockets. I bought another in olive green."
5.0,"Fit as expected, legs are long but that is the desired look these days, and is as shown in the product description."
5.0,Used for 5G & EMF Radiation protection.
5.0,The dress was beautifully made. Love it
5.0,I love this blouse.. i was surprise for the quality of the product.
5.0,Love these :)
5.0,"I bought one to try and really love it.  I then ordered two other different patterns.  The fabric is soft and not transparent ( I have blue, purple and black ones). It flows very well, not tight on me and has tunic length ( I normally wear size 14)."
5.0,"Loved the look but the fit does take some getting use to, the ear holes are a little small."
5.0,Adorable jeans.  They are cut pretty low.  Just not a fit for me personally.  So cute though!
5.0,Looks beautiful on your ears!!
5.0,Oakley’s quality is the best and I love the Frogskin style!
5.0,"Beautiful! The stones are very bright and glittery, light really makes them sparkle. The only problem is the safety chain wasn't connected but I was able to do that without any trouble. I love it!"
5.0,If they had a small size
5.0,"It was really quite lovely, the person loved it and put it right on. I also bought a plain silver chain ( some people prefer that on different occasions). I was very pleased it was the perfect gift for the person I bought it for"
5.0,Both my niece & daughter love this bag!!
5.0,"I love my Wabbits feet! I gave several to friends and they were tickled silly! I have them on my key chain and show them to everyone. They may think you are a kook but too bad, I have much fun and enjoyment from my Rabbits Foot. Laugh alittle, buy them for your kids and everyone else!"
5.0,This piece is exactly what you see on the picture. The bottom clasp allows the bracelet to open up making it easy for any woman (plus size or not) to wear the bracelet. I'm plus size and the bracelet fit perfectly. The gold doesn't look fake and the triangle pieces are coated with matte giving it a unique look. Shipping was prompt! I'm very happy with this purchase. Oh I almost forgot the cute little diamonds around the triangles
5.0,"Let's face it; I don't go around traveling with an entourage to 'fix my face and hair' for the red carpet, relieving me of having to carry any sort of clutch, big or small. So, down here in the real world, where a lady performs many diverse tasks and still manages to carry herself flawlessly into a beautiful ballroom, well this clutch delivers like a mini entourage in a ""clutch""! (Nice play on words, huh?!) It offers a simple, understated elegance (in a variety of popular colors too) with an envelope magnetic closure with plenty of room and still managing to look polished and perfect. In it, I was able to carry a lipstick, credit card and ID, Android phone in a huge protective case, a powder compact and a rattail comb with a small brush. I was ready for this formal event, looking like I was made to live this life!"
5.0,It fits just right. A bit long but that's how I like it. And it's extremely comfortable.
5.0,Buena presión
5.0,"Great socks, comfortable and gives great support.  Tried another brand that was cheaper but was too hard to get on and off."
5.0,the item is of very good quality but I would like the packs of 3 to come with more variety of colors so that one can buy more since most of the packs bring almost all the similar colors recommendations put more color options in the same package for example white red and blue green yellow and black so each packet is repeated except the same color
5.0,Good fit and clear lenses. Nice.
5.0,"Muy buen material y excelente para personas con sobre peso, cubre mucho y el material es excelwnte"
5.0,Just got these earrings and love them. They are light and look so much better on than the picture..
5.0,"Great bargain, really nice little earrings.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,A lot of the reviews were mixed as fare as the fit of  this garment being too big or too small.<br />For me a medium is perfect!  I am shorter but I am not as skinny as some of the reviewers. Lol<br />I am 5'3 and 140 lbs. I am well indowd on the top half and the medium still fit very well.<br />The dress is long enough to wear as a short dress or a a tunic top with leggings!<br />This top was perfect for the first bday party I want to!
5.0,This is so cute. Super Happy with it.
5.0,These jeans are great.  Fit as expected.  They are a little longer on me then the model.
5.0,Best
5.0,Great product. Get good comments
5.0,Wow  just  perfect
5.0,Beautifully made!
5.0,Love them!!!!
5.0,Really happy with this purchase. They're beautiful and so compact. Definitely worth buying. They also are machine washable.
5.0,The dress is nicer than I expected. I ordered this dress to go with an olive print shrug and I am very pleased. It’s a nice lightweight material and it’s true to size. I will be ordering clothing from this company again.
5.0,Worked perfectly! I have wide calves and they still went up over my knees! Love them!
5.0,"Okay so I was taking a leap getting this because I am so weird with joggers and sweats. I am not a fan of them being tight to my legs or butt. So as you can see they are form fitting on the thighs and butt but they are loose on the rest.  These are like legging/Drifit material and they are SOOO COMFY. I would order another one a size bigger but they would be far too big. That is just how they are supposed to fit and I have learned to love them. They have a high waisted yoga band and they have so much stretch.<br /><br />The only downfall for me personally is I had a significant weight loss so there is some left over skin that is visible with lines because the pants are that light material. So no cropped tees for me when I wear these but they are still great.<br /><br />Give them a try, you won’t regret it."
5.0,Great value for the money; the sizing chart is a little questionable go for the size smaller when in doubt.
5.0,"I album is great, arrived in perfect condition."

5.0,It was a gift for my Mom. She loved it !
5.0,Great shirt.  Very happy
5.0,"Love it!!!! It’s big, flowy, with just the right amount of reflection and sparkle from the mirror borders, it worked great on camera, and was a hit while I was in Egypt.  I received many compliments from locals and tourists alike.  You can’t beat it for the price.  Someone wrote in another review that the mirror work is plastic, well it’s obviously not glass, who would want glass on a scarf that you would wrap around your head or shoulders, it would be heavy and not allow it to flow, plus could cause skin injury, kind of obvious.  It’s reflective appliqué I would say, that it’s obviously flexible, but very well stitched in place, and all around the borders, which makes it look a lot higher quality like, as if someone actually put the time and effort to work on that detail.  Can’t beat it for the price, and I am excited to see more colors."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:8fce7d1a2b30396cd78f5e7042064dc0]] My favorite holiday ears!🎅🏽🎄
5.0,Soooooo cool!😎
5.0,"I too, purchased this item for a friend. It's larger than what you would expect looking at the picture. I was worried the chain I chose for it would be too large for the eyelet on the pendant, but it's plenty ample!<br /><br />We love it. It looks hand crafted with initials on the back of the maker. What can I say, for the price, it's gorgeous!<br /><br />Thanks!"
5.0,"This shirt looks great on my 11 year old son. He loves it and wears it every time he goes fishing. The color is great because now when he wipes his grubby hands on his shirt you can't see the stains. It's nice and light, breathable and comfortable."
5.0,"Very comfortable, versatile"
5.0,they r exactly what i was looking for
5.0,"It is very well made and of good quality. It has a nice weight to it, and looks stunning on. I got mine in sterling silver. My new go to piece. Worth the money"

5.0,The pearls stand out and gives the jeans a stylish dressy look.
5.0,Would totally buy again
5.0,"I'm a metalhead, mosh pit fiend that's an engineering tech in an office. I'm also a PT gym rat. I wanted something tough that I can wear anywhere, and matches silver rings. Is that too much to ask? I also don't like having seams/clasps digging into my wrist, and this doesn't. It attaches on one side, goes around wrist, loops around other latch, and folds over to have magnet hold tight. Smooth. Easy to put on & take off, even easier to adjust. Original band is now a backup."
5.0,I needed a mask with a nose piece to keep my glasses from fogging up. It is soft and comfortable like t-shirt material. It stays in place without slipping and the ear loops are adjustable to keep it snug. It comes with a filter as well *bonus* I'd suggest this mask to anyone. Room to breathe and talk in (unlike other masks I have where the mask conforms to my mouth) I like the shape of the mask where it leaves space between your lips and the fabric.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet and the detail on the clasp makes it look so unusual. I love it!
5.0,Lightweight material makes it great for summer.
5.0,I'm very happy with these sunglasses especially for the money.

5.0,Love it Comfortable and fit was as expected<br />Best pullover hoodie and I don’t wear pullover hoodies but I love the color and fit
5.0,I bought these for a costume and they're exactly what I needed. They're beautiful and they fit perfectly.
5.0,Don’t know how it fits it’s a Christmas present

5.0,I bought the yellow and black. It is very nice. Fits well and I get lots of compliments on it.
5.0,"Perfect size, exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,"I gave these to my Mother for a gift and she is very pleased.  She likes the 3/4 length sleeves and the shorter bottoms for summer.  The material is pretty, soft and appears to be durable.  I think this is a you get what you pay for item. They aren't cheap but I think they are worth it."

5.0,My child loves this!  Great mask.
5.0,Semper Fi loving the cover.It's a head turner.
5.0,This necklace is very nice & it looks better in person than the photos show.  I like how the silver on the initial pendant makes it stand out a bit more than if it were all gold.
5.0,Fitted and flattering.  Nice low neckline and quality material.  Feels good on and can easily be a layer under a sweater...
5.0,These are great plus size compression socks. They are a good feel and fit nicely.

5.0,"Good Material, great fit.  Very comfortable!"
5.0,"This is my go to belt. The most comfortable belt I've ever owned and its held up well for the last 3 years, just recently bought a new one because I thought I lost mine just for my wife to find it the next day. Haha"
5.0,"This is my second purchase of boxers from this seller and I have been very happy with both purchases.  The sizes listed are pretty accurate, the quality is pretty good and the price is excellent."

Room enough for credit cards, cash, smart phone, and reading glasses, mints, tissues, etc. Very comfortable, so much so, that I sometimes forgot I had it on and drove with it on. Even in over 100 degree weather, there was no irritation from perspiration."

5.0,Very cute and flowing. Like the material.
5.0,"Classy, expensive looking, ans an accessory its an upgrade. LOVE THE PRICE, material, and function."
5.0,"Beautiful and high quality dress.  I generally wear a size 12-14 and ordered an XL.  Fit well and ruching adds to the slimming effect.  I am tall at 5'9"".  Dress is a bit shorter than I expected and hits me mid thigh.  Looks fine, but I may choose to wear it more for a nice dinner out than to mt highly professional job because of the length.  I would recommend.  Also, blue color is a beautiful muted shade of blue."
5.0,"Great product, it was as described works great looks good."
5.0,"Everyday I have to polishoes the brass on my duty belt.  In the old days I had to use a liquid and cloth, rub in and rub off.  I have one cloth at work and let other Officers use it and one at home.  This saves time and a messy clean up."
5.0,I bought them for my 8 year old daughter and she loves them. They don't give her ears any problems.
5.0,I love this set.  I ordered this mainly for the neck warmer as my wool winter coat tends to irritate my chin  and I didn’t want the extra bulk of a scarf.  It is warmer that I expected and the neck wrap can cover most of my face.
5.0,"Great product, excellent quality, perfect shipping"
5.0,"I have plantar fasciitis, so I added some insoles. But as an outside facilities technician on my feet for 8 hours a day, I have no complaints."
5.0,Good quality. Reminds me of the David Yurman box chain. Holds a lot of my enhancers and has a great look.
5.0,I'm 5'1&#34; and 144lbs and bought a M. I would have been better off buying a large because it's just a bit too firm fitting for me BUT not so much that I don't wear it. The material is soft and has the right amount of stretch.
5.0,Absolutely love this watch band. LOVE IT!
5.0,This hat was absolutely perfect in EVERY way. And I think I know hats very well. Great purchase and better Value.
5.0,Great socks! Very high quality & very effective!

5.0,The colors are bright easy to set up

5.0,Super cute with chucks and a baseball tee or flip flops and a cute tunic.
5.0,Cute bracelets
5.0,Matched perfectly to my bridesmaid dress!
5.0,I’ve bought 2 other types of workout tanks here and this one is the shorter of the 3…which is perfect for my height.  One caveat is the interior of these is slightly more “sheen” than other similar brands and therefore may slightly stick to skin upon sweating over more softer poly tanks. The material is like generic basketball shorts.  Don’t let this dissuade you from buying.  The fit alone makes these worth the buy for me.
5.0,They were a hit for my sons “oh two-dles” birthday party. Very affordable and good quality.
5.0,Where have these sunglasses been my whole life!!!!! I absolutely love them!!! They are over sized and sturdy! I will be ordering more!!!!!!
5.0,"They are just perfect, you must get it!!!"
5.0,My new favorite tee. I need more!
5.0,I liked this product because it’s as good as described. I ordered this to wear to the Marine Corps Ball where my gown was backless. I wear a 32B and the small fit great!

5.0,Wonderful service!!<br />Great Leather quality too!<br />My son loved it!
5.0,Most gorgeous men's scarf I've seen.  Love the color blue.  Fit for a king!
5.0,"A ten dollar watch that keeps time to the minute over months. Rarely need to reset it. A built-in timer, alarm clock, and night light. A battery that lasts about seven years. Clear, easy to read. Excellent watchband. After seven years almost as new looking as the day I first put it on. Just a  terrific watch."
5.0,"These are the most comfortable thigh highs I have ever tried.  I don't really like tights, but also love wearing dresses and hate cold legs, so have tried many different thigh highs over the years.  I don't even notice I am wearing these, unlike the other brands that tug and pull at your skin and are generally uncomfortable."
5.0,Sooo love this Blouse!! Yellow color is bright and really pretty!
5.0,It works just like it did back in the 70's.  Son #2 bought this for himself and likes it.  His father and I laughed our heads off.  Kids these days...
5.0,Fine unit
5.0,I love this top! I have it in two colors and I'm hoping it will come back in stock with some other color options! So comfortable and cute!
5.0,I get compliments all the time
5.0,"Extremely comfortable, fashionable, and makes getting ready in the morning a breeze!"
5.0,First off the delivery to the packaging to the material... This belt Rocks... The quality of this belt is really good I have a few designer brands that cost so much more and I really fell in love with this one. It is so easy to use just slide it on and your all set.
5.0,"The chain seems to be very well made. I purchased it to wear an antique pendant. If I’m ever needing another chain of a different size, I’ll definitely order again."
5.0,So far great boots
5.0,My daughter put it on right away and we all had a great time. The blanket is soft and well-made. It is oversized so size is expected. This panda design is just super cute! love it and would recommend it.
5.0,Great product! It was exactly what I needed at a fair price. The packaging was great so all items arrived in good condition.
5.0,Gorgeous scarf with an interesting design.<br />Thank you Grace!
5.0,"I've been buying lularoe leggings and got frustrated with the whole process. These leggings are just as soft and wonderful as lularoe for half the price and I can buy them whenever I want without fighting strangers over the right to buy a product. I think I'll be buying all my leggings here now!<br /><br />Also, I'm 5'3&#34; and 240 pounds and these fit wonderfully!"
5.0,Was pretty amazed how perfect this band is on my Gear S2 Classic.  I have bought bands for some of my higher end watches and there were over 100 dollars and are the exact same quality!
5.0,Fits my daughter perfectly.  My son and I also have a pair.
5.0,Love these pants! They are long and waist is high. Great fit and comfortable.
5.0,"Thanks fine item, please with it all."
5.0,These pajamas are super soft and I love the length. So many pajama pants shrink and become too short. These have held up wash after wash.
5.0,Fit very good. Good quality material.
5.0,Sooooo soft! Love these pants.
5.0,"These are great! Their spherical stones don't come unglued from the base, as I've had others do. It appears that the metal extends into the stone for a bit to make it more secure. They came w/ extra backs. The presentation isn't gift-quality; it's just an unmarked black plastic card w/ holes in it, but I was buying for myself, so it didn't matter. I originally wanted to buy just black onyx ones, but the price was so good for 6 pair, I decided to get the set. I have found that I wear the other colors, too. I've not had any trouble w/ skin allergies, so the stainless steel quality seems good. The gemstones are smooth w/o obvious flaws. I would buy again & recommend."
5.0,nice and soft but not very thick.. warm to a point but not heavy.  keeps my hands warm at the office when typing
5.0,So cute on my little 2 year old
5.0,"I bought three of these for gifts for my genealogy buddies (family tree and roots, eh?)  I little lighter weight than I expected, but perfect for the occasion."
5.0,My little granddaughter is the cutest little unicorn at the pool.
5.0,Sleeveless is only a little tighter than I would like. Not really my color but nice for hot weather.
5.0,Have a bunch of the Jess N Jane tops and they are all really nice!
5.0,I am very happy I could get a purple one since it is my favourite color🥰cuz only the yellow one available in my location.Sadly the light blue one didn't ship to my location😖
5.0,Have just begun ordering jewelry on Amazon. This necklace is very pretty and well priced. It is difficult to tell if you will like it from the photos on line. It is very pretty!

5.0,Had this for a couple months now and it is great quality and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants.  It actually isn't as see thru as it shows in the picture.  My thighs are a big problem and these pants totally mask those flaws. I wish they had more colors, I would buy all of them.  I will upload pictures at a later time."
5.0,I like the cut as it is not too baggy like most off the rack clothing these days.  Warm and nice for the price.  Perfect for a clean look.
5.0,My baby had on for a dinner he looked so nice in blazer. Good material
5.0,"Super Pleased!! I was hoping these would be the gorgeous color on my screen, Aqua, even though the info indicated they were mint, and They R!!  Gorgeous Spring/Summer Aqua color, soft & velvety and comfy.<br />I wear a small, these work, although I could see how they could stretch for a larger size as well.<br />Happy to say, Instant ship with upgrade fee.<br />Thanks Bunches,  Cheers,  Zoe"
5.0,Great purchase and great price!
5.0,Good quality and fit! Would buy again
5.0,"This hat was bought for my dad who is a retired Vietnam Veteran.  He lost his previous hat, so I got this and gave it to him and it made his day.  He is very proud to have served."
5.0,Wonderful!!!
5.0,The perfect loose tank! It's great for working out and just throwing on to do errands!

5.0,"Best no show socks I have ever purchased!! Ordered a second pack, because the grip makes them comfortable to wear around the house!"
5.0,This slim front-pocket wallet looks great and has a money clip built into it. And the best thing is the snap pocket where I can easily fit fobs and keys.  Love it!
5.0,"I have never seen a Carolyn Pollack piece that I didn't like - but this one is one of my favorites.  There really is leather in behind the silver work.  The mother of pearl really pops in this piece - and there's just enough turquoise to wear it with my vintage pieces.  To show you how big (and beautiful) this pendant is, I am holding it in my palm - it's attached to a nugget necklace that I've had for years - I think this would be beautiful on Carolyn's signature necklace, but until I can work that into my budget, it looks beautiful with what I have.  I highly recommend any of Carolyn's pieces, but if you want a special treat that you won't see duplicated, this pendant is a keeper."
5.0,They are comfortable and do not slip.
5.0,"I love these!  It's very hard to find 100% cotton anymore.  These are so comfortable, super soft, and wash up well.  I liked it so much, I bought another one.  Perfect for lounging in or very light workouts."
5.0,Size and color
5.0,"I.love all of the different colors and can be worn casually, or dressed up. Great colors in this collection, as they can be worn for different holidays."
5.0,This went soooo perfect with my tea party look! def recommend

5.0,Love it. Well made.
5.0,"Nice pants, nice fit too."
5.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and usually wear an 8/10. I ordered the medium and it fits perfectly!! Nice thick stretchy fabric that's very forgiving if you have &#34;problem&#34; areas.  Hits just above the knee.  Will definitely be ordering more!
5.0,You too will like it 👍
5.0,I love having the dogbone dangle from my purse handle with the charms of my pets inside.  People have seen the charm locket and have commented positive about it.
5.0,"Got this for golf on those bitey, drizzly days and I’ve only used it twice, works great, great value.  Not too heavy or bulky but provides protection"

5.0,Great piece for the price
5.0,Nice variety!
5.0,It's soft and flowing.  Makes me look slender.
5.0,These are so comfy!!
5.0,"I wanted some pajamas that kept me warm but cool at the same time, which I didn't think was possible. Until I found out silk pajamas exist. I wanted one pair of long sleeves, and one short sleeves for the hotter nights. It's super comfortable!"
5.0,"The case feels like a miniature, extraterrestrial coffin that houses optical instruments capable of intercepting flash, flicker, gleam, glint, and Glare from a thousand suns. Mirror lenses sheathed in sleek, silver frames add piercing dimension from every angle. So while the summer sun approaches, you don't have to be planning a beach-bound holiday to Guard your eyes with the most luxurious frames from the Future!"
5.0,I like the message and it's an attention getter for sure. I can use it with other belts and was affordable.
5.0,Very comfortable. They run a little smaller then I hoped. But I still like them for around the house
5.0,Bought these after seeing a youtubers review of them. reallyyy like these!! I didn't like the black pair that i bought as much as the grey pair. stretchy fabric. I do feel a little revealing in the but area but that's just me.
5.0,This product arrived very quickly for a last minute gift and is beautifully made
5.0,"I love this outdoor blanket! First of all, it's a good size for multiple people. It's also easy to keep clean. You can just brush the sand or grass off, unlike a soft fabric blanket which attracts everything. It's really perfect for outdoors! If the ground is damp, it's not going to seep through. It rolls up nicely, though I can't get it to look quite as nice as it was when I first got it. I'm looking forward to using it on our next trip to the beach. The fun whimsical prints scream beach or pool!"
5.0,"Absolutely adorable! These fit my four month old beautifully, yet he will have plenty of room to wear them for years to come! Great quality for the price!"

5.0,Fit perfect!!!!
5.0,love itt
5.0,Excelent ítem!
5.0,"I love the pattern and the fit of the jeggings.  The material is stretchy and comfortable.  The sizing in this brand’s jeggings is inconsistent, however.  I had to send back the tropical and “ethnic” (peacock type multicolor) print I got at the same time.  They were a different material, and less stretchy.  Reordered those two in 2X, which fit perfectly.  Why?  They all fit like high waisted pants, which I love!  This is my favorite pattern.  Love the pastels with a darker blue background so I don’t look huge.  I have a fluffy white cat, and have no problems with fur sticking to these pants so I don’t have to get dressed the second I go out the door to avoid him climbing on me!  I won’t be ordering the black background again because hair does stick, but the blue is perfect!  I have a hard time finding the printed ankle length jeggings in Spring and Summer so I’m stocking up now (it’s still Winter in the Upper Midwest US lol).  I don’t like capris because they interrupt the line of the leg and I’m a bigger girl, but these are my favorite jeggings (the full length).  I hope they never stop making these!"
5.0,Great for the price and excellent fit.
5.0,"The package came earlier than expected. The glasses looked great. They came with a zip up carrying case, a lens cleaning cloth and a carrying bag too."
5.0,"Heck yeah! These are awesome! These are SO soft, and super comfy. The high waist means no rolling down - even better. Not see through, so that's not an issue. Well made - the seams are really well done. They are just like the Lularoe- they are SO soft!! Like, I was very pleasantly surrprised when I put them on! But I'm not paying that price. Super cute designs when worn, also. I really love these and will be ordering more."
5.0,Love these shirts. Would wear them every single day if I owned more than 3 lol. I sized down (small) for a tight fit.
5.0,"They are beautiful, I absolutely love them!"
5.0,I love the cotton softness of the fabric and they are very comfortable.  Wish they came in more colors.
5.0,She loves it!
5.0,"I recently purchased this from LeatherPaKs from Amazon, and have been totally pleased with my purchase. The briefcase appears to be well made: sturdy, with all the room I need for my 13"" MacBook Pro, iPad, power adapters, papers, and plenty more. If you are looking for a quality laptop bag/briefcase, take a moment to check this one out. I purchased the TAN but it also comes in BLACK and CAFE. My experience with LeatherPaKs was professional in every way, so check them out when looking to purchase this briefcase or one similar."
5.0,"Amazing Sunglasses! The quality, feel, comfort and style for the price are truly unbelievable. I was skeptical at first, especially about the lens polarization but it's true! I now have 3 pairs from Sojos and wear them all more often then my designer Dior pair. The convenience and affordability of these sunglasses allows me to leave a pair in my car, at work, home and in my gym bag, and that's a big plus too! I have light colored eyes and I am very sensitive to sunlight. Living in Florida makes sunglasses a necessity and now I am never without a pair. They aren't just for fashion either, the aviator style is ultra light weight and the arms wrap around my ears, no slipping when I run or bend over. Looking forward to adding more pairs to my collection :)"
5.0,"Fun item, great conversation piece at a black-tie event. They're nothing fancy in terms of quality (more like costume jewelry), but since they'll only be used occasionally, the quality seems adequate for the price. Appreciated the inexpensive shipping. And they arrived very quickly - thank you, seller! Overall, a fun splurge to make a formal event more light-hearted."
5.0,I really like my caps with the 2 buttons to hold the straps off and away from my ears.  I love the material used and finally found a pattern that didn't overwhelm.
5.0,"Love these shorts. They have definetly helped keep my rear from getting too sore. These are intended to fit snuggly although personally, I hate anything that fits this snug. These are really unattractive on me but functional"
5.0,Great bag. Fast delivery
5.0,"Good fit, much better than expected. No cutting into my leg. 5’9” & 225lb"
5.0,Was looking for a reasonable cost leather band for a Seiko pilot watch.  Found many that are similar to this one but the cost was moderate and the product was even better than in the photograph.  It even came with new spring bars.
5.0,Great fit and brightly colored. Exactly as described in the listing. Extra stitching which adds to durability of the shirt when wet.
5.0,Fits our 23# toddler as expected.
5.0,Perfect for the beach!
5.0,Nice4price-soft fabric great fit-accurate sizing
5.0,"Bought for son, works great for him"
5.0,These are so pretty! All of my customers love them on their bracelets.
5.0,Best socks.  Sooo comfortable. Great price for great quality!
5.0,"I got a compliment the first time I wore these out, at an art museum gala no less. The design is simple and elegant with a hint of history in the symbol. It doesn't seem to represent any googlable ancient Egyptian symbol, but the best description I can come up with is: triangle spiral symbol. It's got more style and elegance than its price tag would suggest."
5.0,Very sturdy and stylish. They are going to make the prefect gift.
5.0,Very high quality.
5.0,Fits well. Super soft and comfy!
5.0,"Love, love, love this dress! It makes me feel beautiful. It fits my curves well and is exceptionally flattering. It is also amazingly comfortable."
5.0,Cute and comfortable wearing. Wont regret buying them i love them! Expecially for not wearing earring for while not had a proble with them in yet. Been wearing them over 2 months now. Feels like im wearing nothing
5.0,Perfect for plus size girls with big heads. Clear and sturdy
5.0,Seems thin. But comfortable to wear. Will order again in differnt colour.
5.0,Great product as described.
5.0,I have arthritis in my fingers and wrists and I find the pain to be gone when I wear this bracelet... I love this!
5.0,I have had this purse for 3 months and it is holding up so well! Great purchase.
5.0,😍😍😍😍😍
5.0,Fit is perfect. Pretty colors.
5.0,I like that I don’t have a belt bunched up in front
5.0,I bought this for a scientist who loves coffee!
5.0,"Love love LOVE this septum ring. Others have stated “it’s hard to open and close”... um, you pierced your nose. No one said this was gonna be a picnic. But that being said, it’s easy enough for me to put in, take out, open, and close. It’s the cutest and classiest looking septum ring I own. I’ll definitely be buying more as needed."
5.0,"I chose Marie Antoinette for my Halloween costume and really wanted a pink or cream colored dress, but this purple one caught my eye. The color is beautiful and changes in different light. I was concerned that I wouldn't find a dress that was long enough. I'm 5'8.5"" and this dress just touched the ground with my paniers underneath. My outfit came together beautifully. I got far more attention than I could have imagined. This was probably the best costume I've ever worn."
5.0,My son adores this hat. His school colors are black and orange.
5.0,"Keeps my pants up, looks classy, and is inexpensive.<br />I literally have four different versions of this belt.<br />The only problem is that sometimes the webbing wants to pull away from buckle, but that's an easy fix, you just undo the clamp and recenter it."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I had an event to go to and I wanted to get something new and a little bit fancy. It arrived on time and in great condition. Be advised that the dress comes folded, so it does need to be steamed before you wear it.<br />I got a medium. For the size chart, I went with the bust size for fitting. The fabric stretches a little so it creates a nice fit. (There is a zipper on the side that I didn't even realized was there. I was able to fit the dress on the first time without even touching the zipper. Oops!) The skirt has a little body - it's nice that it doesn't lay super flat. There is a little bit of an imperfection in one of the seams so it kind of creates a wrinkle I can't get out, but it isn't something that I am really worried about. I only noticed it when I was steaming it.<br />There are no inside straps for hanging and I didn't want to use a pant hanger on the lace as I was worried it would stretch out. I have mine hanging in half through the hanger and that seems to be working out.<br />Overall, I would recommend this dress and seller. I am considering getting the same dress in the other colors - that is how nice it looks on!"
5.0,Thick material and so adorable! You would want to order a larger size because babies grow constantly and fast! These cover ups run a little small so take extra precaution. My baby is just turn 3 mos and I purchased the 6-24mos cover. The color is just as pictured! I am satisfied with my purchase!
5.0,"Love Betsy Johnson purses. This purse is really cute , get lots of compliments"
5.0,"If you are obsessed with nylons, and want your guy to be wrapped in pleasure, these are the fit foryou. Just writing this review is making me feel tingly and ready to put one on. The feeling of pantyhose tightly rubbing is amazing and impossible to stay soft."
5.0,Beautiful.shirt!
5.0,"WONDERFUL PRODUCT, WORKS PERFECTLY JUST AS ADVERTISED AND DESCRIBED BY THE SELLER...THANK YOU."
5.0,"Love these. Took a minute to get in, but I was successful after I mastered the first. Just don’t give up! They are super cute. I love that they are small and do not feel when sleeping."
5.0,"Just the look I wanted, good price"
5.0,"Excellent full-size clip-on sunglasses, perfect for those of us who have specialized lens needs precluding other solutions. The flip-up may get you some funny looks, but the are perfect for ,say, grocery shopping, where you cross from blinding sunlight in the parking lot to regular light in the store. They clip on as easily as they unclip. I love them.<br /><br />These were delivered quickly, and perfectly packaged in a usable plastic pocket, with a minimum of safe but throw-away shipping packaging."
5.0,Product fit perfectly order usual size
5.0,They are a pair of beautiful earrings and their not hollow. Satisfied once again!
5.0,I’m 5’9 and ordered a small. Was pleasantly surprised that the length was modest. Super comfy!
5.0,"Sharp,classy,comfortable,affordable,anything else?  Love them!"
5.0,My original band broke and this was an easy fix and is holding up well
5.0,It’s completely gorgeous. I had so much compliments about my dress
5.0,Liked the earrings.  Had to return them.  They were a little to small for me to grip.  The colors were very pretty
5.0,Love these under my scrubs! Second time I’ve bought them . Great quality! I got large size fits perfect!
5.0,Look really Nice!! . My husband love it .Very Happy with my purchase.
5.0,I got it for myself
5.0,Bought as a gift for my Dance Mom daughter. She loves it and says it makes packing and traveling for competitions and whatnot so much less fraught and back-breaking. She's pleased with the quality and finds it to be both attractive and durable.
5.0,Its lovely.. thank you
5.0,"Great little lights for camping, trick-or-treating, or playing around in the dark!<br />Once in a while, you'll get one that doesn't quite work, but hey, you get what you pay for and these are a GREAT deal!"
5.0,"These feel like butter!!  Not too thin but not fleece lined either.  Good Quality.  I haven't washed them yet, so we'll have to see how that does.  I'm 5'-5&#34; and approx 125 and I got a medium.  I find that smalls seem to be just a bit tight in some brands.  Ordering from Amazon I could return and exchange for a small if needed, but I like how the medium fits!"
5.0,refunded.
5.0,"I purchased this for my boyfriend and he looks so good in it! However, before buying it, be sure to order the next biggest size of be has muscles. This ran a little small. We had to return it for a bigger size.  Overall,  we loved it"
5.0,Great weight & they look like a million dollars.
5.0,"These bracelets are so pretty! Not cheapy looking, very durable, eady open/close side snap, oval in shape for laying beautifully on your wrist! The crystals are set in and sparkle! I am very impressed with the quality and feel of them, I’m going to order more!"
5.0,"Looks awesome, great quality and easy to take on and off! Covers a good amount of the boot so no worries,definitely a boot saver if you ride hard. I have Harley boots and they are not cheap!"
5.0,These are well made boots and they are comfortable.
5.0,"Love, love, love!!!"
5.0,Very detailed!
5.0,Love my Deadliest Catch hat
5.0,"Highly recommend! Suoer comfy, cute,  veryyyyy soft, not sheer and overall doesn't look cheap! I got animal print size 2x."
5.0,Fun and stylish ring
5.0,Beautiful! Bought it as a gift for someone and she loved it!
5.0,Purchased for summer. Perfect weight and fit
5.0,"This hat is simply wonderful.  The material is soft, but maintains its shape very well.  The badge on the headband is beautiful and looks sharp (as in &#34;stylish and tasteful&#34; not &#34;it will stab your fingers&#34;)"
5.0,So cute and comfy! Easy to adjust and take on and off.
5.0,This bracelet is just beautiful. I love it.
5.0,"Lovely piece, is beautiful as a modesty panel in dresses or blouses. It is true to size."
5.0,I like purple. These come in purple. I've been wearing them for a couple weeks and they haven't apart yet. Compatible with Pebble 2. Decent quality.
5.0,manly but not obnoxious
5.0,I mean. What can I say this looks amazing. Fits great. Lots of comments.
5.0,i recommend. Its just that i somehow ordered  wrongly and didn't notice i was ordering a toddler size....so it didn't fit my school boy son.  We are trying to sell it now.  Anyone want it? email me at cobist@hotmail.com
5.0,This current version of the watch has a thicker wrist band that is less likely to break.<br />I've owned several of these same basic watches in the last 25 years. If the band breaks you may as well buy a new watch because the replacement band is almost as expensive.
5.0,"Xsmall. Fits me perfectly 5’2”, 105 lbs."
5.0,Thank you hellyeah
5.0,A little snug on the shirt but the pant and robe fit perfectly!
5.0,The seller packed the hat just right where it was in great condition. The hat itself was beyond perfect!!! I have many Stetson hats and a couple other known brands and this hat slid on my noggin like it had been there for 43 years!!! I love it!! It is so “just right”!!! It’s exactly the right size for me and I was scared it was gonna be too tight or too snug because sometimes you just need to try a hat on first… not Atwood!!! Just order your size and you’ll wanna live in it!! Perfect!!!
5.0,This necklace is amazing. Bigger than expected will shop brand again.
5.0,Good product very good quality
5.0,My daughter loves her new ring!
5.0,Super cute dress! Wore for my engagement pictures with beige heels. Can be dressed up with a necklace or leave it as is since the laser cut at the bottom is gorgeous!
5.0,A gift for my granddaughter 12th birthday and she absolutely loves it.
5.0,I’ve had a pair of light purple gem earring forever and didn’t have a necklace to go with them so I just had to get this one when I saw it. The length of the chain is perfect and matches my earrings amazingly well.
5.0,Best glasses on EARTH!!
5.0,I was hesitant about jumping into the choker trend but this was different than the others that are being worn commonly now and so cute. I love it.
5.0,I like it it fits good it kind of has that stretch material to it
5.0,"Like others have said, get a different chain. It just comes with the bead chains (like on faux dog tags, or a ceiling fan. ) Bet the quality is great, the demon claw is silver tipped like the one picture. My wife loved them, highly recommend."
5.0,"Ordered it for my son. He loves them, cozy and warm. Two months of use- they are still like new, but have to admit, my child is very accurate to his shoes at all, so I can tell you definitely about my purchase."
5.0,"Good quality belt, well made and will last along time. I have bought many in the past and never had a problem."
5.0,They still come up too high...make them half the length...<br /><br />Still love them
5.0,"I used this particular button as a part of a costume, and it's worked out really well, the size fits great and was as described in all wonderful item"
5.0,"This is a beautiful, impressive product.  It's not just a costume piece, it feels authentic. I was pleased with the quality for the price and it arrived in a timely manner.  Thank you!"
5.0,On time and just right
5.0,It looks so fancy! I love it!
5.0,I bought the large as recommended and it fit perfectly. I’m 5’9” and 175lbs. It’s flows against the body but not too fitted. LOVE THE POCKETS and the length. Haven’t washed yet. Ordered two and will plan to order more.  It’s a perfect weight for summer weather maybe in the 80’s but wouldn’t recommend for the winter w/o some leggings. The length comes to mid knee and happy about that.
5.0,"Good quality, well priced, quickly delivered. Very happy with this purchase . Thank you"
5.0,"I do like the comfort of the dress, I did not realize that the small was not going to be a little more form fitting. I do love the style of the dress though, and probably would purchase another like it, although in an even smaller size. Lots of side boob action going on, which I'm not use to, but will certainly be wearing the dress either way!"
5.0,Llegó a tiempo
5.0,These are super great for their price point. I kept saving them for later purchase...and I don’t why! I want to get so many more colors.
5.0,I have used a couple different stillettos but this one is really the best. It is so comfortable in my hand (I have arthritis) and the extra pressing end is a great little feature. The tip is some how different in that it just doesn't slip. Nice.
5.0,Had one break
5.0,Thank you! My client loves them!
5.0,Very good product looks good too
5.0,Finally found my perfect socks
5.0,I love this item it goes to work fast as soon as you put it on you start sweating around the waist immediately. I love it.
5.0,Love this band. I had to remove one link and it was easy to do. I cannot tell you how many complements I have gotten on this band.
5.0,Great looking top.  Bought to wear with leggins and it works perfectly.  Covers your butt!  The neck can be a bit less drappy vs. the picture but overall a great top.
5.0,Great buy.  These are great tie clips and they work well.  They give a nice subtle style change for each day.
5.0,Wow very nice shoes my son is absolutely love it !
5.0,"They fit comfortably.  Would like a little more cushion for the feet, but still like them a lot."
5.0,Love these slippers.  Deep rich purple color.  Very soft and comfy the very first time I wore them.
5.0,I bought a couple sizes up to get the fit I wanted. Very cute light weight cardigan. Quality seems very nice though I haven’t washed it yet. I usually wear a medium but I bought the xL
5.0,"Fit is a little more relaxed than I expected, but that's fine with me. Great quality denim. Wash is light, as pictured. There's underlining / patches of fabric that's fairly visible: red and white stripes and blue and white stars. Perfect for the beach or casual event. Worth the price, I'm so glad I decided on the purchase."
5.0,nice t -shirt very soft and comfortable i will purchase another in a different color
5.0,My son loved this! What a great Christmas gift! One of his favorites. It’s very unique and of good quality. Keep them coming screenshot!
5.0,These are wonderful.  Super flattering and perfect weight.
5.0,"I really like this set, you can wear them as lounge wear or as pajamas. They’re lightweight and fit as expected. The quality is good and no issues with the stitching, the colors are as described."
5.0,Great fit and comfortable material.
5.0,Fits amazing
5.0,VERY ATTRACTIVE
5.0,"Bought for winter, works great, i bought a few more."
5.0,It is a wedding present for  avid campers. His fiance said he was really excited to get that brand. I was satisfied
5.0,"Loved the dress and look of it, dress comes a lil above the knees, has a nice amount of stretch about 2%, fit to ur curves, I’m about 230 pounds and 5’6 in height"
5.0,"Very pretty dress. Color is spot on. I love the way it fits me, very figure flattering!"
5.0,"Exactly as expected, just like the original factory piece."
5.0,"Shirt is so soft and comfortable! I fit into a medium perfectly and I am a 36B bust 145 lbs. It's extremely flattering and hides all those ""not so flattering"" tummy curves! Absolutely love it!"
5.0,I LOVE these socks. They are so soft and comfy. I wish I had pjs to go with them. Will probably buy a pair for each of my sisters and Nieces for our next get together.
5.0,Fit my grandson well and they are stretchy to help when he grows. Wash well. He said they were comfortable.
5.0,Great product so far. Will update after some daily use.
5.0,Fit and look were exactly what I was hoping for out of this product
5.0,Purchased in black and another in white.  Loved them as always with  vans.  I wear 8.5 wide fit exactly the way they should.
5.0,Good quality - good price.
5.0,"So many of these ""gold plated"" pieces just are made poorly. This isn't the case here, this labret stud has been worn since I got it (about a month) and it still looks new!"
5.0,Got here one day before the 4th of july! Can see pretty clearly out of them and the flags look really good.
5.0,Very well made and sexy. Flattens tummy too.
5.0,They work great. I need to keep my prescription glasses on and these clip ons work very well with my glasses.
5.0,"Just Beautiful.  I received this from hubby 4 years ago and it still looks as beautiful as the day I received it and I still love it and it looks amazing.  I sometimes wear it instead of my wedding band and engagement ring.  I have become accustomed to wearing less bling and this one ring alone is tons of bling on one finger, enough for two hands.  BTW, I have platinum diamond and wedding band and this ring pairs nicely with those, you cant tell the difference between the metals.  I love it, either alone or with all my other diamonds.  I do prefer to wear it on my right hand either alone or with my right hand 3 stone 3 ct. diamonds when we go out on events.  Gorgeous! a ton times over"
5.0,"Just what I needed after my surgery!  Fit well, I could even put gauze/pads under and still feel comfortable!"
5.0,Super soft & great quality. My new favorite!
5.0,This sunglasses looks very cool and sporty.  I got it for my 5 yrs old son and he loves it so much compared to other sunglasses that he has...
5.0,Product is extremely comfortable and fits perfect! Just the right amount of stretch and softness. Elastic around waist is a thick band and doesnt cut into my tummy. Definitely will buy again.
5.0,"This is super adorable, and love that is still has some holiday ""magic"" but I don't have to stress remembering toove it or create scenes."
5.0,Perfect summer dress... nice fitting
5.0,My 8yr old loves these.  We are going on our 4th pair. She's has worn them for 3yrs (new pair every year).  She wants these over her sketcher sandals.  They keep toes covered and playground tested.  They are not cute and danity but rugged and great for an active child.  She wears them everywhere. I just wish we had more color options.
5.0,So cute. Perfect for our trip to the zoo
5.0,EXACTLY as described  Great straps
5.0,special ed fabulous
5.0,This dress is so pretty and fits perfectly! Comes from China!
5.0,"Soft, great material, keeps my bum warm. Great buy."
5.0,Could not be more pleased with this company and products. Stumbled on them while looking for a gift. Will definitely shop here again!
5.0,Very cute........
5.0,Breathing Smoothly !
5.0,This shirt is very comfortable and cute! It's fits perfectly in the top and flares out a bit starting right beneath the breast. It is very flattering if you have a bit of extra weight around the middle. I'm 5ft3in so it almost looked like a short dress on me and looked great with leggings. I received many compliments and was asked if I had lost weight.
5.0,Great light weight sweater
5.0,My eyes used to be straining while viewing movies on my eyes iPad. I have also been using them to address the strong blue light emanating from the television and found it a great help. Now my eyes are much more comfortable.
5.0,Bought for my son to give to his God Mother.  She loved it!
5.0,"Theses compression  shorts are flat out amazing. I workout regularly and it can be tough to find anything that is breathable and feels good throughout the entire workout. These compression shorts do the trick. I tend to do cross training for 1 -2 hours a day and in a closed studio, so no friction and breathability are essential to me. Also, I washed them by hand and they dried rather quickly 15 -20 minutes, which is a plus if you need them in a pinch. I would highly recommend giving the shorts a try. You will not be disappointed."
5.0,This owl locket is so cute!  I bought one for my granddaughter and she loves it!  It came in a cute little gift box.  I was totally happy with this purchase.  It was good quality and the company was great about shipping it promptly.
5.0,Really like these pants (& I'm not one who usually likes pull-ons).  I've got 4 pair!  Hope they hold up well; haven't had them long enough to really determine that.
5.0,"Came in great condition, great quality, and is as pictured."
5.0,Love Columbia. Love this style. Fast service and great price!
5.0,"So simple,  great material almost as bikini one, fits perfect, easy to wear it. Whatch the size they run small sizes so if you wear M this is perfect."
5.0,"My husband had a hard time finding sunglasses that weren't too tight on his head. We tried so many and just couldn't find any that were comfortable. These were great! They don't squeeze his head, and they give his eyes great protection. The price was awesome too!!"
5.0,Good quality for the price you pay. Light weight.
5.0,I really like this necklace . The colors are beautiful and I highly recommend it.
5.0,I like the durability of stainless steel and a good value for the money.
5.0,I really like the dress just wish it was a little longer I am 5'11
5.0,"Good price, good fit. Would order again."
5.0,Drop Dead Gorgeous!!!  Dress is just as beautifil In person than it is in the picture. The look and feel is sexy  I’m 5ft 10 and the length is perfect.
5.0,Great feel & great fabric. I will probably order another pair in a brighter color for summer.
5.0,Add a little length
5.0,"These are great slips. Very simple and exactly what i needed for some more see through dresses I purchased. They are fairly study and the quality is good. Straps are adjustable and coverage is decent. Material is your basic slip material. Not the most extravagant l, but not super sheer. I'd say for the price and the fact there is two, it was worth every penny."
5.0,"So soft, I wear this as a run errand top.  Can't really dress it up, but it's great for running errands and is nice and loose, so it is the perfect to go to top"
5.0,"super cute, love it!"
5.0,Perfect fit. Perfect material. LOVE
5.0,"It was big, but I wasn't sure which size to buy. I work fitted black. bike shorts underneath."
5.0,"Love these, look just like the picture!"
5.0,"I was concerned about buying a watch that was so inexpensive, but this one looks much better than you would expect.  The green dial is very luxurious-looking, and so far the watch is working perfectly.  It took me a while to remove the extra links in the band to make it fit, and I'm sure a jeweler could have done it more quickly and easily, but it's something anyone could do with the right tools.  Like most Japanese watches, you set the day and date by pulling out the crown just a tiny amount and then spin it one way for the date, and the other for the day.  It's sometimes hard to get the crown pulled out just enough, but my Seikos are the same way.  The watch has a quality appearance, and I hope it continues to look this good after months of wear.  FYI, the watch comes packaged in clear vinyl bag, not a box, and does not include instructions, so you might not want to order it as a gift.  But for the price, I don't think you'll find anything better.<br />UPDATE:  I've been wearing this watch every day for five months now, and it still looks like brand new, and still keeps perfect time.  I am very impressed and pleased<br />UPDATE 2:  After wearing the watch daily for over a year, I banged it into a doorknob and knocked loose the little gold bezel around the day/date window.  Otherwise the watch still looked brand new and kept perfect time.  Considering the cost of repair, and the need to eventually replace the battery, I just bought a new one.  It's just like the old one, so I'm sure I will be pleased with it.  I just need to be more careful."
5.0,"My husband is a BIG Chicago Fan (Football, Baseball ) it fit him just perfect and of course he love it, i on the other hand it's okay I'm an Astro fan. LOL"
5.0,These were exactly what was described. I like the product and would buy again.
5.0,Perfect necklace! Must-have for casual wear. Great with maxi dresses
5.0,Thought they were the tiny bags
5.0,"I received my Red River Jasper bracelet this afternoon, and soon, I began wearing it. I have to say first that, I am expecting twins...and have been a little fatigued lately. I hadn’t realized, until hours after I was wearing the bracelet, that I had cleaned the entire kitchen! Lately, my husband has been helping around the house, but wow! Today, I did most of the work! I’m sure he’ll wonder what happened when he comes home from the office this evening!  Everything that Red River Jasper is supposed to be, this bracelet has it! I’m so grateful."

5.0,"Fit great, sturdy.  Love the colors.  Great value!"
5.0,Nice run to the beache

5.0,Nice watch for the price<br /><br />Pros: Nice size<br /><br />Cons: Leather strap

5.0,Queda bello
5.0,Hit of the 4yr old birthday party
5.0,Fits my fat body good. Only complaint is that the front pockets are a two small for my hands but at least it fits great. Can’t beat the price either.

5.0,Nice top very comfortable . Size as expected 5.5&#34; 36 DD 148  pounds large fits perfect !
5.0,Saw this on facebook--I laughed at thought &#34;how true&#34;.  I ordered it for myself--having more fun with it---when I wear it to the store most of the<br />female customers shake their head with a &#34;yeah of approval&#34;. I does draw attention--I'm a great grandma-so been there done that and loving it.
5.0,"The flexibility offered by the Grid-It is unmatched for storage. I organize all of my small electronics and accessories in my backpack using this. One thing that was not apparent to me until after I received this, is that there is a zippered pouch on the back for additional storage. I would highly recommend this item to anyone."
5.0,Re cheto
5.0,These are my all-time favorite headbands. They're great for working out or with a cute outfit. They always stay put during my workouts and don't give me headaches. Plus they come in a variety of insanely cute patterns. Can't go wrong!
5.0,Funny gift for chocolate lover
5.0,"Comfortable and classy. The sleeves are long; but, I like that! The sleeves can easily be rolled up, if you don’t like them long and look just as nice."
5.0,We bought two of these for our boys.  They fit well and the boys love them.  They look really warm and appear to be well made!  I was very happy with this purchase!
5.0,Dress is beautiful. My daughter wears a 3T-4T so I ordered the 4T. I probably could've gone a size up. It was a little smaller than I had anticipated especially in the arms. She will be able to wear it for Halloween but it may not last much longer than that. I would recommend this product!
5.0,These are super cute. My 11 year old loves and in spite of how rough he is on shoes they still look great!
5.0,"I was worried that the material would be cheap and thin but it was not. Great quality, thick and looked well made. My daughter loved wearing this dress. Definitely worth the price."
5.0,beautiful.  looks very expensive.
5.0,Nice pin. Worked well for my grandkkids.
5.0,"Best little travel backpack ever! Fits more than expected, and has water bottle holders on the outside. Also has a perfect phone pocket. Straps can be a little uncomfortable after wearing all day."
5.0,"I bought the white shirt, size Medium.  I am 5'6"" and weigh 140 lbs,, age 58.  I have been active all my life, and like to look good as I go to and from workouts. I love work out clothing that can double for travel--easy to wash, not likely to wrinkle, and versatile with many outfits.  This shirt can go anywhere.  Slightly longer in back, curved edge, very flattering.  i will wear it for workouts, travel, hiking, and under a jacket for work. Material is thick enough to look classy, but flows."
5.0,This ring and others I have purchased are really nice and the price is fantastic.  I've had many compliments from my friends and co-workers.
5.0,Looks great! Fits like a normal long sleeved T
5.0,I love this swimband. It adds a lot of pop to my plain black wetsuit! It's my second swimband of this brand and it's not gonna be the last. Great purchase!
5.0,Fog free and comfortable...stylish is a plus.  Took a while to get but worth the wait.

5.0,Great value for the price. Everyone asks where I got it!
5.0,My son fell in love with these. Shocked me! We already ordered more!
5.0,"I really like the fit of these joggers. I appreciate the weight of the fabric, as I wanted something a bit warmer for chilly days out on the golf course."
5.0,"It’s easy to get on and off. I had rotator cuff surgery and this really helped. I bought another one after a little while because I like wearing it so much good for a rehab because when they put electronic stems on me, they can just unbutton it and get to my shoulder, I will continue to use this until they wear out because they’re so comfortable to sleep in. Expensive but worth it. I got a two XL normally I would just wear a large. It’s pretty hard to put shorts on for the first month and this fits the bill."
5.0,"Excellent product. Very soft cotton, happy with my purchase."
5.0,Love this suit
5.0,The T-shirt is quality fabric that washes and wears well.  The graphic looks great and is also of good quality.
5.0,This is Great hat.  The white kind of sparkles.  The chin strap keeps it in place when it's windy.  Great sun hat.  It's definitely the prettiest sun hat I've ever had.  I put some embroidery on it and it's even prettier.
5.0,"These are indeed soft comfortable socks. But they simply aren’t cold weather boot socks,  unless  you intend to use them in a southern tier state and or predominantly indoors. They meet my definition of rather nice dress shoe shocks. I’m a 6 foot tall male with  size 10 feet. They fit me well but they only come up a measured 8 1/2 “ from the bottoms of my feet. Not high enough for a boot sock.  If your feet are larger they might also be a bit small.  Very soft for wool but also not very thick. They fit, feel and look like dress socks. As they are advertised as dress socks I have no issue with this. Thinner than a cushioned athletic sock.<br />If you’re looking for a very warm winter boot sock and live in a northern tier state , Alaska or Canada I would suggest you try another sock.<br />If you want a warmer dress sock or live in a more moderate winter climate they are very nice socks."
5.0,"Simple, cool, great texture!"
5.0,Easy to use and effective.  Good overall product
5.0,Good for pretending to be a pokemon trainer
5.0,"Lightweight, excellent metal"
5.0,This is a little heavier weight than a normal tshirt but light enough to layer. Color blocking is a nice change. Will probably add another in a different color.
5.0,Well made and my son loves it!
5.0,"Perfect fit, heavier than I would have thought. Would love to see this company pull off a Flash ring and Green Lantern. Will be looking for more from this company."
5.0,Great for Rain to cover hair
5.0,Very nice boy Scout hat.
5.0,"The belt is sturdy and attractive. I havent had opportunity to use it in an airport. At the suggestion of other posters, i ordered it one size larger and that worked out."
5.0,Such a fun vintage looking piece of jewelry to wear. Can’t beat it for the price
5.0,I love these little charms (for lack of a better word).  Their colors are bright and cheerful.  The ideas are sweet.  It's a cute little way of changing out a decoration each month on my dining room table.
5.0,My husband loves these socks.  I have ordered 3 times and each time he says WOW I love these socks.
5.0,Too hip gotta go!  The price was right.

5.0,4th pair I have ordered. Love them!
5.0,"Theses gloves are true to size and fit well at the wrist, they're perfect for year round wear."
5.0,The two pair of sun glasses is just what I needed. I had both of my lenses replaced several years ago and most light sources kill me. These glasses do keep alot of the light from penetrating my eyes. Money worth while spent. Would recommend these to everyone.
5.0,I’m happy with the product
5.0,My son loves it. Exactly what he wanted. The fit is larger on him.
5.0,"My daughter and I have both purchased SYROKAN sports bras. They appear to be well made, fit well, and are much less than other ""name"" brands."
5.0,These leggings are super comfy and perfect for working out. Fits as expected!
5.0,"Great quality, wonderful piece of jade. I'm in love may order more!!!"
5.0,I love this band..
5.0,Great shirts
5.0,"Looks small but when I put on it hugs my body, surprisingly didn't roll and sits firm, will be buying more, just took forever to deliver, but worth it"
5.0,"I love it, he loves it. Not to thick, fit him just right! I bought it for him as a surprise...he wore it home from the hospital, this is his cancer fighting shirt."
5.0,"Beautiful beautiful dress, 😍it’s for my daughters birthday party and it gave me the puff and wow and princess theme I’m going for . Only thing is your gonna need to put something underneath. There is no slip or anything underneath. She loved it too"
5.0,"I love it, it looks just like the picture! It fits well and I’ve already gotten a few compliments on how unique it is."
5.0,Bought these for my husbands groomsmen. They loved it and it was super cheesy for the pics. Loved it
5.0,"I love these, they look great"
5.0,I just spent $700 on new glasses and they're miserably uncomfortable. Along came these and they really help keep my glasses from slip sliding away. A great bargain!
5.0,Very nice wife loved them
5.0,Great dress...exeptional quality for the price. I was impressed and very happy with the outcome. Purchased last minute for a wedding. Was very flattering!  I'm quite curvy... 5'2&#34;... 165lbs... 38D. Short waisted. The ruffles helped camouflage any lumps and bumps. It was stretchy and comfortable. I thought the v-neck was just right. Not too modest...not too over-the-top. Sorry no pictures as I am always the one taking them. If any show up I will post later
5.0,I'm pleased with this purchase!  The size and fix are perfect.  I also order the sliver set; I'm pleased with them as well.  I'd highly recommend this item.!
5.0,"This is a lovely watch, the rose tone is very pretty, softly feminine and expensive looking. The description states this is a 30mm case, It's bigger than that more like a 32.5mm which is a nice size, not too big or too small right on trend. Due to the comments on the bracelet opening, by a few reviewers, I had the watch deployment clasp checked out at a watch repair place and they said the clasp was fine. I had 2 links taken out leaving a loose fit and I haven't had any issues with the clasp opening. This is a great everyday watch. I'm giving the watch 5 stars based on appearance and comfort how the watch holds up remains to be seen, so far everything is fine."
5.0,Amazing quality for the price!
5.0,"Soft, quality material and structure.  Hangs nicely.  Only issue for me was size Small was still too large through chest area and shoulders.  Had to make alterations."
5.0,"So far it's very nice. As long as it holds up, I will be thrilled. I bought 3, one for me and two for gifts."
5.0,Excellent i use it to play tennis
5.0,Fantastic belt.  Came in excellent condition; even had a small &quot;belt bag&quot; that I will probably keep for traveling.  I will definitely buy from Bulliant again.
5.0,I think these run a bit on the small size so I'm glad I ordered a size up.  These are nice looking and super comfortable.  These are great for wearing under boyfriend shirt or sweaters and also work well for sleeping in.  These washed up well and are definitely in my comfy pants area of the closet.<br />I received product for my unbiased review.  All opinions are my own.
5.0,These are the softest sheets I've ever had. Love them. Definitely excellent choice.
5.0,easier to get on than the ones my insurance company pays for.
5.0,"I ordered 3 midi dresses from 3 separate vendors and this was my favorite. Material is sturdier and more forgiving, and the fit was true to size. I'll probably try different colors in the future."
5.0,"Son muy cómodos a mi Niño le encantan , protegen los dedos del pie y secan rápido cuando se mojan ."
5.0,Fabric was soft and cottony feel. Fit was perfect. Fit a big bust very well. Super value for the cost. Going to get another in black.
5.0,"I was looking for a hat for my mother to match her cream colored coat. I got two that looked cream in the photo but ended up as beige. The were prime and easily returned. This one said white, but in the answered questions people said it was actually cream. It is cream and I’m happy about that . Cute hat looks nice on my 90 year old mommy and she loves it with her cream coat! Happy"
5.0,Absolutely love it! Wanted a dress that would be flattering (not feeling my best after having a baby) and this dress delivered. Will probably buy other colors as well.
5.0,"I WOULD RECOMMEND. Of course, I purchased this because i'm an aspiring stylist. After taking the classes with SOS, I figured I needed to have this recommend starters kit to get my foot into the business."
5.0,Great colors and fits as expected. I ordered a Large  Material is a good quality. I'm very happy with my sweater.
5.0,Fit perfect!!!

5.0,super soft!!
5.0,Super cute and arrived quickly!! Nice and warm too also they fit like a glove.
5.0,"Just the right size, needed a heavier chain. Needed something that looked antiqued, at first I thought it wasn’t going to work. (Still liked the way it looked). Looked perfect for what it was bought for. It does catch a little on the hair but nothing that most chain catch. Very very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,I work with a lot of kids and use this as my work badge holder. It's nice to make all the MHA fans smile and bring joy to their faces. Plus who wouldn't love to pretend they work/go to UA High? That's part of the fun!<br /><br />Go Beyond! Plus Ultra!
5.0,Buena calidad.  A mi nena de 9 años le encantó.
5.0,"I love my boots. They are comfortable, i wear them walking around the city even. The leather is beautiful and they fit my big calves, which is near impossible to find except with lucky brand boots. This is my fourth pair of lucky brand boots. If you have thick calves and have trouble finding boots that fit, try these."
5.0,"I like it .. it fit her perfectly.. she’s 5 months ..16 pounds , and 25 inches long  for"
5.0,This is now my favorite warm weather shirt.  Quality is really good and it's very comfortable.
5.0,"The material on the dress is great, however the bust does fit a little tighter than expected. Everywhere else fits wonderfully. I got the dress in a large because I am busty up top (34DD), but have a small frame, I feel like if I go up to an XL, it will then be too big. I ordered for a 50’s themed photo shoot that I’m excited about with a group of friends. I think the dress is unique and will stand out. It’s not as see through as I’ve read in some reviews, it actually doesn’t show anything. There were suggestions to get a petticoat to wear underneath for that extra fluff, however I already have a black Tutu that does the job!"
5.0,I love this sweater. Its very comfortable material and it fits nicely in the right places.
5.0,Fits great and love the color!
5.0,I love them very light material and soft great for summer! I ordered large I wear jeans size 8-10 and these had plenty of room maybe could have ordered medium but no big deal I prefer lounge around pants loose.
5.0,"Just what I was looking for! Great over tights or skinny jeans! I ordered a medium, I’m 5.5 and 150 and it fits just right! Semi fitted at bust but not tight (I’m a 38) and great for nursing. The fabric is a bit stiff (like a dress shirt) but I’m sure it will soften aftern washing! Overall very pleased!"
5.0,Just as described but cooler. Remember remember the 5th of November....
5.0,"I got so many compliments and people couldn’t not believe I got this on amazon. Not the best material but if you know how to dres things up it doesn’t matter, fast chipping and great for the price. I got a large and it was good so size accordingly if not it could be snug."
5.0,She loved them. Looks just like the picture
5.0,Works great. Don’t pay $50+ for “name brand” ones.  Would repurchase.
5.0,These are great- very comfortable and perfect for dance class!
5.0,Need to order in bulk
5.0,"I use band for my Samsung watch. I absolutely love it. I had a problem with one of the chains of stones coming loose and they immediately sent me a new band, you can't beat that for customer service!  If you like bling you'll love this band!  I do!"

5.0,Comfy and versatile T shirt soft jumpsuit. Absolutely love this thing!!

I suppose I'll have to take them off when I go on the plane, but it will be the first time since I got them. Being stainless steel they do not tarnish eigher. Hooray again."
5.0,GREAT NECKLACE AT A GREAT PRICE!!!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:502c0a55116ec4cebe4a6ccd789d33a9]] I ordered the ¾ length sleeve tunic in Gray in an X-Large.  I'm always nervous buying clothes online; it's such a pain to return if it's the wrong size or you don't like it so I always check sizing charts when available.  This is the size recommended for me on their sizing chart and it's pretty accurate. The color is spot on to the product picture.  I hate when you get an item and it's not at all the color you thought you were getting!<br /><br />I always check for imperfections when I buy new clothes, and I couldn't find any so I was pretty happy about that; no one likes a shabbily made product! The shirt fits a little tight across the chest, but not so tight that it would prevent me from wearing it.  It is a little on the sheer size, so a cami or tank top underneath is a must for me, no one wants to see my unmentionables! It's also a little long in the back but that's not uncommon for me because I'm only 5'2!<br /><br /> Overall I'm pretty impressed with this shirt.  I think I would have to tuck the back in if I wore it for work as it would be longer than my suit jacket, but I can definitely see myself wearing this out for a night with friends too.  Check out my video if you want to see the shirt on me and how it looks on!  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion."
5.0,I looks good on me and I love is.
5.0,Perfect for hiding drugs
5.0,Great fit.  Soft and confortable.
5.0,"These have a great cat eye look! Exactly as advertised, and one of the great things about them is that they don’t have that yellow tint that some other blue light filtering glasses tend to have. These have completely clear lenses. Also the packaging is adorable. They come in this classes case that is gold sparkly - I love it. All in all, great product."
5.0,Looks great. Learning to handle the magnets takes a couple tries but once you get used to it you will love it. It can pull arm hairs a bit but not too bad.
5.0,I bought this bracelet for myself and am very happy I did. It arrived a day earlier than expected. Always a plus. I'm a pretty big guy and was a little afraid that it might not fit my wrist. I had nothing to worry about. It fits great and looks great. A very satisfied customer.
5.0,This dress is much higher quality than you would expect for the price.
5.0,Beautiful and exactly as described.

5.0,product was better than expected
5.0,Super cute! And no skin irritation!
5.0,"Although I ALWAYS take a size 6 shoe and never larger, I ordered a size 7 thong and it is perfect. A relative let me try on her size 7 thong and advised me to order a size 7 even though I take a size 6 shoe. You don't want to have your toes sticking out over the thongs.<br /><br />The thong is very cushioned, but I only purchased them to use at the pool. I really don't like having something between my toes."
5.0,Compliments every time I wore this dress!
5.0,It fit to some of my outfit
5.0,Super cute. :D

5.0,Does the job. Basic shower sandals.
5.0,"I have worn this belly ring continuously for about a month now and absolutely I love it! This is the only belly ring that I own (I have at least twenty) that does not cause any type of irritation. I have not had any problems with the rhinestones coming off as well.

5.0,"I got this watch as a gift when I was a kid and now it is the only kind of watch I ever buy. Any time it gets lost or breaks I always seek the exact same one out. I have a friend who is the same way about another Casio watch. It's just so simple and intuitive, and it does everything you need, there's no need to spend more."

5.0,"This dress is so cute in person ! The colors are very bright. My favorite part of this dress has to be the pockets, I don't always like carrying a purse and this is perfect to just slip my phone into. Would definitely purchase this dress again ! I am 5'5 and it was a little long but worked well with wedges I liked the length of this dress much better than most other maxi dresses I have tried."

5.0,"Great pair of sunglasses thank you ,I have two more pairs to return back to Amazon different brand they brook already<br />Best regard<br />Lias h"
5.0,"I like that they're not the spandex type of yoga pants and are a nice, thick fabric...but not too thick that you can't move.  I move around easily in these without feeling confined.<br />Really nice yoga pants."
5.0,"Color was lovely- the olive green. It fit a bit large but shrunk to the perfect fit after one wash. Comfortable, great material. Can’t say enough!"
5.0,"Comfortable watchband which doesn't pinch like my other twisto-flex type watchbands. And I've gotten compliments on its appearance, too. I've been wearing it for a a couple of months now, and so far I am very happy with it. I can't deal with clasps on watchbands, so this type works for me. My wrist is probably average for a woman, about 7&#34; to 7.25&#34; and it fits me just fine. If you have a tiny wrist, it might be a bit big for you. I don't like tight watchbands."
5.0,I wore it for Easter
5.0,"I wear one of these bands every day at work to carry my office keys.  I put the band around my upper arm so I never forget my keys.  I hate them on the wrist because then the keys bang against everything and I hate lanyards because then keys dangle from your neck.  These bands are great quality, very durable.  They easily stretch to fit whatever size you need and keep their form.  The current price of this pack is very reasonable for 20.  I love the colors in this pack.  They are very neutral, earthy tones.  There are beige, navy, brown, maroon, and grey colors.  They will work with any outfit I wear.  I definitely recommend these for keys."
5.0,Love these shades they fit beautiful they are lite weight and I really love them
5.0,Fabric is terrific as is the fit and comfort. After washing they’re still a great fit/look. My 90 year old aunt who’s in assisted living absolutely loves them. So glad to have petite sizes too! Now she wants the blue stripe!
5.0,"Is my favorite hat. About one in Missouri from Leeds and lost it I camping trip, seen it on here and had to get it."
5.0,"Nice and soft soles, but I wouldn't want to walk in them all day long.  I feel like I have to curl my toes to keep them in place."
5.0,This is a nice fitting shirt. The sleeves aren't loose which gives them a slim fit on the arms. I normally wear mediums for shirts but I ordered a large and it fit perfectly. I don't know how this shirt will stand up to the wash but I am satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,"This band is beautiful and came with an entire kit to install, which I overlooked in the description, so that was a pleasant surprise. It matches perfectly with my existing watch face. Highly recommend as a classy replacement"
5.0,Very sturdy! Good product
5.0,"Amazing leggings!  I have ordered so many leggings on Amazon hoping to find my perfect pair (I am very picky) and these have exceeded my expectations!  They are soft, smooth, high quality leggings.  I am hopeful that they restock soon!<br /><br />As far as sizing, I used the size chart on my first order, which originally said to order “small”.  However, when I tried them on, they were a bit large on me (waist gap).  So I returned those and reordered in XS and these were perfect!<br /><br />For the seller, please continue restocking and bringing in various colors.  I will be buying ALL!<br /><br />Highly recommend these leggings—so flattering!"
5.0,I knew what I wanted & went in search of it.  It arrived in perfect condition & is exactly what it is represented to be!

5.0,"How long was I looking for something like that, sooo so happy, can spend all day in it"

5.0,super sexy wore this to the beach in Jamaica
5.0,"Great looking, high quality shorts"
5.0,"There wasn't much in the way of a description of this bag so I was a bit wary. The material seems to be a woven nylon which is thicker than most packable bags. when you remove the bag from the zippered bag, it folds out in a way that the circle with the zipper is on the outside of the bag and makes for a small pocket. Cute bag and seems more sturdy than I was expecting.The circle is about 5&#34; in diameter so it's not a keychain sized packable bag, but  the fact that it turns out to have a small zippered pocket is pretty cool."
5.0,So comfortable and cute
5.0,Love perfect fit
5.0,Beautiful. Nice heavy sturdy.  Good gift.
5.0,These are awesome! Definitely worth it! They’re stretchy and soft and warm. I got them for my son since he likes to move all over but it gets cold where I live. These are awesome!
5.0,"I found these to be cute and comfortable. I liked the feel of the material, kind of like a yoga mat. They lasted about half a year, until my dog got to them. I'm actually buying another pair right now."
5.0,These are great for layering and they hit below the waist. Perfect!
5.0,High quality.  Good value for $
5.0,This is my favorite necklace I own! Had it for almost a year now. It goes with everything. Has held up very well. I love it!

5.0,Fast shipping low prices and great service!
5.0,"This top is so cute, it's made fairly well alas a little stiff.<br />It fit true to size, I wear an xs and bought the 0-2"
5.0,"I am not sure why I assumed these would come off easily...I rate this product 5 stars because I am the dummy who didn't realize these were just like any other temporary tattoos.  I used everything I could find to get them off, and eventually, after an hour and some rubbing alcohol/sponge, I got most of it off.<br /><br />Aside from my foolishness, these looked pretty cool when my little one was all dressed up and ready to reign some terror."
5.0,Great copy.
5.0,"I love these pants! I work in a hot kitchen and these are perfect, especially since there is a nice pocket where I can put my ipod."
5.0,"This is form fitting, very cute and great colors!"

5.0,a gift and she loved them
5.0,Love this bracelet very durable
5.0,It’s so cute and is made with great material!! And also not see through :)!
5.0,"Received my order today, socks feels awesome on my feet. Was a bit worried the socks might fit too large. Socks adjusts to foot size, very light and comfortable. The colorway makes the socks even better."
5.0,Adorable Christmas outfit!  Fit perfectly!
5.0,I love my Selena Face Mask
5.0,"No one will know its not real! I own two real fur coats (mink and fox) so I know how fur should look and feel and this is a perfect imitation.  I even ordered a faux fur stole from the leading American faux fur retailer last year that doesn't compare.  This can pass even after touching it!  It is large and soft and silky.  I haven't worn it outside yet but it is so cozy around my neck I am sure it will be warm. Shipping was also excellent.  I was expecting my delivery after Jan 8 and it arrived on Dec 15, well ahead of schedule! VERY pleased."
5.0,Great to wear to work or for a casual get together.
5.0,Bought this for my husband who is a Retired Navy CPO of 22 years.<br />He loves it !!
5.0,Nice fit and look
5.0,Very light comfortable shoes.
5.0,I brought it for my son
5.0,Exactly what was expected! Definitely satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,These frames are soooo cute! I've gotten tons of compliments and the price was great! The frames are very sturdy and stylish....I'm going to order another pair!
5.0,"So light and so beautiful without demanding everybody to stare at it.<br /><br />That line was supposed to be my headline for this review, but it fits so much better inside the body of this review, just as the scarf fits so perfectly on the body of my wife.<br /><br />Not sure if the lightness of the weight or the lightness of the color is the most welcome feature. I am exhausted by the vibrant colors of so many articles of clothing that women wear nowadays, so, perhaps, the light color and the almost invisibility of the scarf is what I most appreciate."
5.0,"Great quality, fit, and look! Another great product from a killer brand!"
5.0,Fits perfect love the material it’s so thick and nice
5.0,Love this swimsuit
5.0,Got these for my wife because she wanted some to wear with her tall boots. She is 5 ft 9 in and these easily go up to her thigh which is exactly what was wanted.
5.0,I love it!  It's super cute and comfortable!!
5.0,Lenses are very slightly narrower than the stock lenses.  This is really only noticeable when cleaning the lenses and they want to rattle. The polarization is almost on par with my much more expensive 580 lenses found in another famous brand.
5.0,I just love this tote handbag.  It is lightweight is very versatile.  I am very glad that I ordered it. I am planning to order one for each of my two daughters.
5.0,"Great masks. They match all my uniforms, any clothes, fitness equipment, and can run errands in the grocery store. I highly recommend it."
5.0,Perfect face cover for those times when I’m around those who are scared of Covid. I can pull it up fast and it looks awesome.
5.0,"These fit great for my partner. Unfortunately I can not provide her size as she does not wear regular bra's ever! The medium fit her very well. The paddy is a bit big, however, they are removable! True to color as well"
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! I am so excited to wear this to a summer party. I'm 5'8 and 140 lbs, 34C, I ordered a large, it fits snug but not tight. It is very flattering. You can't beat the price, but do follow the size guidelines. It is not at all loose fitting like the photo."
5.0,Perfect size for hanging off a tassel
5.0,Bought for valentines day to wear to work. Fit was great. Good quality. Would buy again.
5.0,Received my purchased today and I love it! It is exactly what we're looking for groomsgifts!
5.0,"I love these boots and I’m so glad they actually fit me. The sizing was sooooo confusing, especially if you go to the Rossi site. Seriously, wtf. Thankfully, another reviewer who had recently bought them said to just order down a size from your regular US size. For me, I’m a US 9, so I ordered the boots in 8. They fit perfectly. The boots themselves say on the bottom the Aussie sizes of m6/w8.  The box says a Womens us9. I love these WAY better than Blundstones. They actually have a nice footbed with support and cushioning."
5.0,These are exactly what I was looking for. Oversized but not ridiculous. Only slightly cat-eyed. Good quality. I'm buying more 2 more pairs.
5.0,For a night out it’s perfect and very sexy
5.0,I’m happy with it. I do wish it had an extra piece to hold the excess band for small wrists. But I like it and it doesn’t get stretched out easily.
5.0,Haver purchased a few pairs of these slippers and love them.  They wash up great and are warmer than a sock but not as structured as a house slipper.  Well worth the money!
5.0,I love this dress...it fits perfectly. The material is very soft and holds everything in place.
5.0,"This is the second set of these mittens I bought for gifts.  The recipients love them!  They are nice and warm with the thinsulate lining, and the sizing is perfect. They are not bulky like some mittens are, and can easily handle other items without taking them off.  Highly recommend them!"
5.0,These are easy to install and help justify the price of the glasses.  I would buy again.
5.0,Very soft comfy pajama
5.0,"Great product, great gift."
5.0,So cute. But smaller than anticipated but still good quality
5.0,Love it when I had it but then it got lost :(
5.0,All of these items are super cute! Perfect for the party. I wish the bow was fluffier but it’s a perfect set. The tutu isn’t fluffy but I grabbed a petticoat for underneath
5.0,"really loved this! the quality is pretty good as well, i was just expecting the fabric to be a bit thicker. i weight 127 lbs. and i measure to 5’7”, and got a large. you could probably buy a medium, but i like wearing more baggy/bigger clothes."
5.0,"It is soft and fits well, with nose wire.  Has a pocket for filter."
5.0,So cute and comfortable to wear!!
5.0,They work perfectly & they were way cheaper than getting new screw posts and new backs at the jeweler
5.0,Awesome hat!
5.0,"Love this skirt.  I’m not sure my boss will be happy to see me wear it to the office but I will wear it and see what happens.  The Dino print may not be for everyone but as a preschool director, I think I can pull it off.  I love the Dino print, it’s so unique and whimsical!  I love weird clothing that take people by surprise so I’m all about this pattern.  Can’t wait to wear it to work!"
5.0,I love this purse.  It is just the right size and the strap is long enough to put over your shoulder.  It has more pockets than I know what to do with and how often can you say that about a purse.  I have had another style of VB purse in the same fabric for over a year and it has held up beautifully.
5.0,"got these super quickly and they were exactly as described! i decided i wanted them a little bigger so i emailed Lex & Lu and they responded, again super quickly, this company is great and helpful!"
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he likes it and I think he looks very cute in it!! Fits as expected and seems of good quality!
5.0,Flows
5.0,I absolutely love! I am 5'6 152 lbs with 40D breast and this looks so amazing! My Husband absolutely loved! Great coverage and well made!
5.0,Awesome quality of the material.
5.0,"I love this top. I sized up a size and was glad I did. There’s a little stretch. The hood seems a little heavy, but I love this top. I’d order another. I get lots of compliments. Nice soft material."
5.0,It’s a great shirt for after surgery it’s soft it’s not a heavy Material very comfortable stretchy  I highly recommend the t shirt I love it
5.0,"Great workout shirt, especially for lifting. It fit very well, the material is incredibly soft and it was easy to move around in. I definitely plan on buying more of these."
5.0,Love it! Only problem is I only ordered one!
5.0,"Like most of women, I really love my wedding ring. And don't want anything bad happen to my “best friend”. I was always taking my wedding ring off when coming home, before washing dishes, gardening, sleeping, going to swimming pool, etc. So I was not wearing my wedding ring most of the time.<br />I have a couple of friends who bought silicone wedding rings before going to vacation. They were very satisfied with that rings. But they payed $40 for each ring! I think, it's too much for just one silicone ring! The quality of these silicone wedding rings by  FLUXActive is not lower than that expensive rings have, but the full price is $10 for 4 rings, which I find very good and reasonable price.<br />These rings are very comfortable to wear, so I don't take the ring off when I go to the shower or to sleep. We are going to vacation soon, so I would be glad to test it there, too :-)<br />Rings look amazing. And you could choose different ones for different swimsuits/manicure/mood. My favorites are purple and pink now.<br />I really like these silicone rings and strongly recommend to buy them."
5.0,"Beautiful Bag.  I love the size, color and the quality of this Dooney bag. Receive compliments when ever I carry this bag."
5.0,Exactly what we wanted. Great quality.
5.0,"Im very picky with my socks. These socks are great. They even have like a little rubber thingy on the inner-heel to keep them from slipping. Quality is very nice, not like that itchy cotton stuff. I used to only wear the KB socks from Costco but these are my new go to. Worth every penny."
5.0,I got this for my daughter who loves cats and to match a pair of Uggs sandals I got her and she is pleased! It's a small purse for a teen girl perfect for lip gloss gum and stuff like that.<br />The fact that she's happy makes me happy so I know I made a good choice getting it for her!
5.0,"Love the looks of the warch. They look expensive.  The only thing I don't like is setting it.  Hour hand is very senitive, making things a little hard.  Hope it holds up well."
5.0,So far so good. My daughter has extremely sensitive ears and has struggled with infected ears for the last 4 years. We've tried every type of metal and nothing but 14k gold works. My daughter is only eight and recently lost her gold earing studs. It's way too expensive to keep buying gold earrings for a child who will lose them often. I gave up and decided to let her holes close and have her pierce them again when she's older. A week later I happen to come across these plastic earing and thought I'd give them a try. She's worn them for a week straight in the picture I posted and her ears are perfect! Not even a hint of infection. These are a wonderful substitute earing for those kids with highly sensitive ears. However I wish they came in more colors and designs.
5.0,I love this bag. There are two zippered main compartments which enable me to separate daily usage items from other items. There is also a zippered inside compartments along with two inside pockets. I put my cell phone in the outside back zippered compartment for easy access. There are also two front zippered pockets where I keep my keys and lip gloss. The bag is large enough to carry a tablet if you would like. It is also quite lightweight so it doesn't weigh you down. The color is exactly as expected. I would easily purchase this bag again.
5.0,I have one already but my girlfriend loved it so got her one also. Just the right size and very cute.
5.0,"Everyone has compliment my son on this outfit, its very soft and comfortable for him. Its so cute!"
5.0,I really love this outfit! I am a preschool teacher so I wear this when I may be near the sandbox so sand can’t get in my shorts! The straps are very thin so I wear a shirt over the top. If you like it loose size up! I wear a women’s 14-16 and it fit me alright.
5.0,Good  Quality
5.0,They were exactly what I was expecting
5.0,Beautiful and fine set! I loved!
5.0,Purchased as a birthday gift for a friend who can no longer smoke his cigars. He just loved it. Thought it was a pretty fun gift.
5.0,"I love this dress, used the sizing chart to select size and it fits like a dream. Came a bit wrinkled but nothing a little ironing couldn't smooth out. The lacey top is quite stretchy and not itchy, the bottons on the front allow for the dress to be as modest (or not) as you wish."
5.0,"Love it. The material is stretchy and satiny soft. I ordered the dark red one and the colour is beautiful. Fits perfectly. I might order another one in a different colour! I have an average frame, with some areas I like to keep hidden. This design is sooo flattering."
5.0,"Perfect little dress, I like that is in one piece , fresh,not overwhelming fabric, can get wet and dries fast, my 3 year old loves it!  I will give it a A+ Looks amazing, the print on the material is very colorful, and the little purse that comes with it just right."
5.0,"This item was a Mother's Day gift for my wife. She was surprised and pleased, immediately wearing it. I found it slightly smaller than I expected, but it was delicately made."
5.0,I’m very Happy with the quality of this bracelet. I bought two of them. One for my daughter who loves it too. Others asked where a I brought it and purchased for themselves. Great little gift !!

5.0,I helped my mom buy 8 of these for her great grandkids. They are soft and beautiful. The kids are going to love them!!!
5.0,Love this cardigan! The sleeves are a bit long but the material is so soft and it's really comfy.

5.0,very nice top!! looks great and very flattering.. good quality too!! love it!
5.0,I love the flower mood necklace.
5.0,Love this however the little hanger is small and the bag holds more than I'm comfortable hanging it up to support.
5.0,This dress is amazing!  Fits me just right.
5.0,She loves the shoes!!! Happy Daughter equals happy Dad.......But the quality of the shoe itself is not the best but for a child thats really young its not going to last her forever
5.0,I love this dress so much I bought it in all available colors. I get high compliments every time I wear it. Great buy! ❤️
5.0,"Excellent product. I have followed Jake, the owner, online and through social media almost 2 years now and have had my wallet a year and a half. Holds up great! Is also a great conversation piece when I pull it out to pay again places."
5.0,My lady loved it! She wears it all the time
5.0,"Yes its great. Geeat colors, fits great and doesnt hurt my sore shoulder"
5.0,"Just a real five star experience in every way. First, before ordering I asked a question on the product page about whether these would work with my existing golf shoes. The answer provided was perfectly adequate, but the seller even let me know that I could send in a picture of my shoes so they could weigh in on my shoes specifically. I emailed the photo and no joke within an hour I had a personal reply with my own photo marked up with little red boxes to show where the Golfkicks should go!  I ordered them then and there and installed them according the instructional video. I used Gorilla Glue clear silicon adhesive, and after 5 range sessions so far they are just 100% locked in and awesome. SO glad I didn’t spend $100 on new shoes and instead refreshed my existing ones with these things! In my case, my shoes were in excellent condition except for the “spikeless” spikes, which had worn way down. Fully recommend these - they’re just great!!"
5.0,"First of all.. I am a dog lover, one of the reasons I chose this apron.  The fabric is very comfortable, good quality and water/spills resistant, I have been cooking and baking in my kitchen almost every night and over the weekends. And my cloths are very grateful as well, this apron protects them from tomato sauce spillages :D.<br />It adapts to my waist easily (I am a size 10) and has an adjuster for the neck.  The pocket is a bit small for my rag but I am glad I at least have one."
5.0,I ordered these so I wouldn't loose my Costa sunglasses while fishing.  I followed the instructions on how to put the strap on my glasses and had no trouble.  They seem to be attached securely and do not feel uncomfortable when I'm wearing the sunglasses.  I'm happy with my purchase.
5.0,Looks simple but elegant. Belt Color is beige.
5.0,Ty so much
5.0,"Cute dress! Fabric is pretty thick, couldn't really see through it too badly. Fabric is a little stiff, but have a feeling it will soften up with some more washing."
5.0,"Came in perfect condition, love this pin."
5.0,Keeps glasses from slipping so I'm not constantly pushing my glasses up.
5.0,gave this necklace to my girlfriend as a gift and she absolutely loved it. the chain wasn’t too thick and the pendant wasn’t too big. it was just about the perfect size.
5.0,"The vibrant colors and texture of the fabric are so beautiful!  The dress fits perfectly, it flows nicely and the pockets don't stick out, they fall nicely with the curves of the dress.  This dress is ideal for spring and summer or for your beach/resort getaway.  I REALLY like the bright colors and pattern of this dress. It's the perfect length, too."
5.0,Good very good..
5.0,"My wife looks great in cardigans, and she is always interested in trying ones made of warm materials. When I saw this one, I got it for her to test. After wearing it for a number of days, she's very happy with it. The material is soft and comfortable. There are no buttons. There is slightly thicker material in the center, where buttons could go, and this looks great. It's got a longer look, and overall is a tiny bit above the size stated in the product description. But it works and looks like it's meant to be that way, as opposed to being out of proportion. The pockets are quite noticeable, and they are also on the larger side, but still look in proportion. After a few wash/dry cycles, the material still looks and feels great. I recommend it."
5.0,"Even more perfect in person! Very stable, good quality!"
5.0,"great product, exactly as described. i will be buying them in a larger stud so i can have more than 1 pair"
5.0,"FAST shipping, and SO comfortable! Much more comfortable than a regular versa band."
5.0,This is a must for anybody who wants to look like the Clubmaster in rain or shine. Good fit and lens darkness.
5.0,Son ligeras y frescas
5.0,"This mask is perfect! I have a tall, slim, physique so even tho that this mask looks bulky, it has foam padding on the inside of the cheek, head rest, and other areas so that you won't get your face scratched up. However, wearing it for long periods of time could result a gross amount of sweat build up that is not fun to deal with and after awhile you will want to take it off to get rid of some of the excess sweat from your forehead. Other than that, this mask is amazing. I would recommend it to friends and other people who are interested in buying this for a haunted house or just halloween in general."
5.0,Love this...very comfortable
5.0,This inset is cushier than more expensive ones that I’ve used while still provided the arch support that I want.
5.0,"Actually, surprisingly, a nice, soft t-shirt.  Seems well made!"
5.0,"I am 5 foot 7 inches tall and 219 pounds. I was afraid the size xl dress would be too small since some of my other xl clothes no longer fit me, but I took a chance and ordered the xl anyway. And it turned out that it fit me perfectly. I hope  that this information is helpful to someone in determining what size to order.i"
5.0,Super soft and comfortable.  These arm warmers cover from my knuckles to just below my elbows. Very warm too.  I just love how comfortable they are and how soft they feel against my skin.<br /><br />I received these for free or at a discount for my honest product review.
5.0,Nice!! Pretty.
5.0,My boyfriend loves it!
5.0,Perfect and great feel
5.0,"I purchased these for my husband. He loves aviator sunglasses, but always buys cheap ones from the dollar store and they end up breaking in a few months, so I wanted to get him a pair of good quality sunglasses. These were very reasonably priced. They look great, and they protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. They are really comfortable to wear, and they come with a nice case to store them in when you're not wearing them!"
5.0,I bought this so I could add it to a floating diamond pendant that I have. I looked into getting the chain lengthened by a jeweler but he wanted upwards of $100 to do it. This accomplished exactly the same thing at a fraction of the price and I can mix and match them to change the length depending on what style I’m looking for.
5.0,Bought these for my daughter and she loves them! She wears them all day everyday to school with no complaints.
5.0,"Got here fast! Lightweight, love the color & feel of the fabric. True to picture."
5.0,Super comfortable. I'm size 7.5 US. ordered that and it fits great. Good quality and very pretty. Looks just like the pictures
5.0,"My coworker loved them! Thanks, Merry Xmas."
5.0,Amazing! Fits perfect
5.0,"great leggings, hold you in all the right places."
5.0,"I ordered the combo set with black & gray. I received them quickly, which is always nice. I love that they fit correctly onto my Fitbit Charge 3, no moving around. They are also very comfortable. I will forget I have it on. There wasn’t a choice of size given, but they fit my very slender wrist just fine when I’m on the very first hole.  So I do think they would fit almost everyone. I plan on getting more colors now."
5.0,The set is perfect. Flat and not rounded on the edge.  Colors are varied from dark to light. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Perfect exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,"Great fit, cool design and lenses are fantastic!"
5.0,😍😍😍😍I want all the colors
5.0,Great shoe!  Quality workmanship.  VIONIC all the Way
5.0,I bought this for a man who was a witness for my wedding ceremony. He liked it and immediately put it on his key chain.
5.0,It looks very cute on. Good fit.
5.0,"These watches are a pleasure, I’m very impressed with the Chinese automatic movements. How they have managed to create an automatic watch at this price point, I am guessing that all these automatic watches are probably using the same movement, which is fine because it’s opened up an entirely new world of watches that are incredibly accessible because of the price point!"
5.0,I have worn boxers my whole life i decided to try these and figured I could throw them away if it was uncomfortable or too weird but these are by far the most comfortable underwear I have ever had i wouldn't tell my friends I wear them lol but I will tell you all you won't regret the purchase but the papi thong is my favorite
5.0,"The bracelet is great quality and the parents I gave it to we’re thrilled.  The box that it came in didn’t represent as well as the bracelet, but a little jewelry bag was included so I removed the bracelet from the box and placed it in the little velvet bag."
5.0,very colorful and unique
5.0,"These are soft, colorful and breathable ones. I haven't lose a single of these thankfully unlike the other loose socks, cz they're not too loose, nor too tight, so hoping to keep them long as it is. But Most importantly they're breathable and leave no mark on my girls ankles again unlike other too tight ankle socks. Best suits this time of the year. Might feel thin during winter."
5.0,Bought as a gift. Recipient loves it! Quality appears to be good. Looks great on the ear.
5.0,a little chunky but I still like them
5.0,"Beautiful summer dress, the fabric is soft but not clingy! The color of the embroidery like patch is not as bright as in the picture but I love the simple yet elegant fit.  I plan to buy it in another color! I’m 5’7 and 160lbs, the large size is a little roomy for me but I like it."
5.0,"I love my Adventure Time watch! I got it for a 2020 Christmas gift However, the band is ripped after these few months of gentle wear.  I'm looking for a replacement band now."
5.0,"I bought a 40 of these in the hope that we can use them on night hikes at the forest where I volunteer. I bought so many partly because of the low price and partly because I expected equally low quality and that some of them would not work. I also expected to need to buy batteries for the lights. I could not have been more wrong!<br /><br />Out of the 40, only a couple have a minor problem with the switch, which I can fix. One was missing a finger strap. Not bad at all! Another pleasant surprise were the LEDs themselves. I assumed that the color of the light came from a white LED shining through the colored case. Wrong again. The LEDs themselves glow with the color of the case. And each light has three button batteries in it.<br /><br />With three batteries per light that is 120 batteries and 40 LEDs, 30 of them colored. This alone is worth well over what I paid!"
5.0,I liked everything about this product except the size. It is a little too big. I liked the comfort and feel of this product. I will order it again in a smaller size
5.0,These gloves are very warm and can be laundered in your home machine.
5.0,Love this line of clothes. Knows woman’s curves. Good quality material and cut.
5.0,Very cute for the price. I purchased it as a gift for my mother. She loves doves. I think she'll like it.
5.0,It is just long enough and nice light cotton! I would by this again.
5.0,Very easy to install on my fossil 5 smart watch. Was easy to make smaller to fit. Sturdy and cute.
5.0,I wanted PJs that were similar to what I bought years ago because they were so comfortable and durable. I was surprised to see these Jockey pajamas online for less than I paid ten years ago. These are quality clothes and comfy too. This was a good deal.
5.0,"Beautiful color, very comfy material! My daughter is 3 months, and just starting to explore movements. These pants are no problem, she moves freely and yet is protected from chilly weather this October. A wide and soft waistband is a wonderful feature, too. Love this item! Its WARM and COZY and Natural."
5.0,Love these! The look fierce on me!
5.0,"Great every day push-up bra. Also came with another strap that is difficult to describe the look, but transforms it into sexy and strappy."
5.0,Fits great feels great looks great what else do you want?
5.0,Love this hat!! It's super cute and comfortable. I ordered another one for my running buddy!!
5.0,Great color options and great price. It fits the torso length very well (I'm 5'7&#34;). Currently using them to layer under some off shoulder and open back tops and they don't over or underwhelm the thinner fabrics of my other shirts. Will be buying again in the future.
5.0,The round backs are great
5.0,I bought this with a promotion coupon so I got a great deal on it! Great quality!
5.0,Love this... got lots of compliments! A nice unique twist on the popular bar necklace. Get it!
5.0,Puts buttons back on my shorts & Shirts easily & quickly
5.0,Best panties I have ever tried. Worth every penny
5.0,My son was extremely happy with the overall fif
5.0,I love this top! I'm happy with the color and the style. The mock neck is just the right height. It can be worn all year round!
5.0,"This has got to be one of the most comfortable watch bands I've ever gotten. It doesn't irritate my skin, stays in place, isn't too tight and it hides what is left of the strap so you can't knock it undone like other watch bands. I highly recommend it"
5.0,Bought these in particular for the scarves for my 4 year old son. The are the perfect length for him and are able to wrap around a couple times with still come length to “dangle.” They are very soft and not itchy at all. The hats and gloves are just as soft and hot as desired for a 4 year old as well. Great buy.
5.0,"I own these leggings in just about every color by now! I’m a size large in these and I’m 5’7, 160 pounds. I cannot express how much I love these leggings and how confident they make me feel. These are 100000% a dupe for NVGTN but I actually like the fit of these better and they’re half the price. Do yourself a favor and buy these!"
5.0,Love love love!  I’m 5’7 around 195 and they fit perfect. Not too long and can wear with flats.
5.0,I gifted it to my boyfriend. He uses it for his Rolex Watch. He love it

5.0,Well designed and looks great
5.0,"We have only had the watch for a couple of weeks, and so far my mother loves her new watch.  Having severe arthritis the magnetic latch has made it possible to take off and put on her wrist. THANK YOU!"
5.0,"My son LOVES this T-shirt!  It's just his style, and he likes the feel of the fabric, too."
5.0,Got these for me and my wife before a trip to Denver.  Used them the whole weekend and they worked perfectly.
5.0,My wife loves it so I am happy with the purchase
5.0,There's not really anything I didn't like. I made sure they fit and then washed them. I got black and they didn't bleed. I will be buying more in the future.
5.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. Told me she received many compliments on it.
5.0,I ordered a Large based on other reviews. It fit perfectly. For reference I wear a size 6.
5.0,These are great sunglasses. The lenses are very large and cover part of my upper cheek. Great polarization.
5.0,I love all here accessories.  The quality and workmanship are wonderful.
5.0,"My granddaughter loves anything that is Jo Jo Siwa.  This is a very beautiful well designed baseball cap.  It is sure to be a standout at her Girl Scout activities.  It was priced extremely well.  The delivery of the cap was spot on.  Thank you, Amazon.  Also, it was a great fit for her underneath her very curly hair."
5.0,"They are super cute. Was very cautious after reading all the reviews & this is the 1st time I have purchased a Big Kids size as opposed to a Women's size. I normally wear an 81/2. The Big Kid size 6 is perfect. A little snug but that is good because everything I've read says they will stretch some with time & I wouldn't want them to end up being too big. Saved money buying the Kid style. & that is the exact style I wanted. Which I couldn't find in Women's styles. They seem to be made well. Sturdy, with no apparent flaws. & r very comfortable. Adorable. I am beyond pleased."
5.0,Color and size were as advertised. Excellent quality compression socks used for running.
5.0,really needed these XXL my XL gloves were just a little to tight
5.0,I wore it for an all white affair.
5.0,I love it is so cute so Soft my glass fit so good I don’t need to worry if they going two break I will be buying more
5.0,This product is amazing! I got it for my boyfriend as a Saint Patrick's day gift. Item looks exactly like the picture. Shipped fast too. It say's not to wear it in water but my boyfriend wears it in the shower and nothing happens to it. He never takes it off and the rope cord is still strong. I also love how it included a little postcard of what the four leaf clovers leaves mean. If you're looking for a genuine four leaf clover product this is a great buy!
5.0,Love how it looks and feels
5.0,Happy with earring purchase!
5.0,Has pockets very good quality great fit
5.0,"Once I got them the are awesome!  and the buckles were papered ,so I know they weren't worn! Very pleased"

5.0,Came prior to the date! Love the color
5.0,Bought these for first graders. They loved them and every single ring lit up!
5.0,Great gift bag for nephew’s birthday party 🥳
5.0,My son wanted a slip on and these really fit the bill. They fit and go on like a sock but are a sneaker. Very easy to get on and he really likes them. My son's feet smell with basically any shoe and these are no different but that's definitely not the shoe's fault. Great value!
5.0,These look very nice on! I am 7 1/2 shoe size and they fit perfectly! Nice colors. I bought to wear with my Converse on my wedding day.
5.0,Weird material.  But so cute. Love this shirt
5.0,Very pleased. These bras are comfortable for me perfectly and are easy to unsnap when my little one needs to nurse. I am a 40 D and ordered XL because my breasts swell while nursing and these bras are super comfy.
5.0,Really good quality but the strings need additional security.. Can come off
5.0,I live in this bra I absolutely love the fit and coverage it gives
5.0,"Awesome Carter's quality. Look exactly like the picture, and make for some very stylish pajamas. My 2-year-old can't stop checking herself out when she has one on :)<br />They hold up very well in the wash too."
5.0,"Love these, bought a second pair! Oversize and polarized. We live on the water and these really cut reflection and glare. We need to look good but have functionality."
5.0,Love this suit.  Nice quality and fits well. I would prefer if I could order separate piece sizes.
5.0,These are great quality well made mens sun glasses! I recommend this product 👍
5.0,"Excellent quality product,  excellent price and look great!!!"
5.0,Flattering fit and pattern. I would order in other colors.
5.0,Got this for my boyfriend. He liked it so much. It was exactly what he wanted.
5.0,They’re super soft! The packaging was very neat and the material feels great.
5.0,Love this  watch
5.0,Let me just say if you have flat feet that hurt all the time...get yourself a few pairs.... I can't live without them!!!! They give me an arch that I know longer have... I hate taking them off :(
5.0,An easy go to cozy shirt that looks nice
5.0,Skirt is wayyy too long. Once it starts to tear RIP and interrogate.
5.0,"These readers were so cute! I unfortunately ended up returning them because the magnification was not quite right (I tried two different pairs with different strengths and the other was better). I may order another pair in this style if the right magnification is available in the future. The style is really cute, so would recommend it for sure."
5.0,I bought these for my one year old granddaughter. They're lightweight so she doesn't trip when she walks. I read the reviews before I ordered and many said they were cheaply made and didn't hold up. We've had them for 2 weeks and they've been worn almost every day. They still look perfect. I just ordered another pair to keep at my house. I feel they are well worth the inexpensive price.
5.0,Love these bracelets! The beads don't shift around but are lose enough that you can arrange them however you please and they will stay put. Got them as a gift and absolutely love them!
5.0,"For me, these socks fit perfectly! Definitely not good for colder weather, but they look adorable and are comfortable! Probably won't fit size 9 women's or more, I wear between a size 8-8.5 and if my feet were any bigger the socks probably wouldn't fit how I want. Overall, great price and appearance! Quality is also really good, so far each pair has held up in the wash. I washed them like normal and popped them in the dryer, no shrinkage or anything of the sorts. The ruffles haven't gotten miscolored yet or anything, they stay in place nicely. Overall just good pairs of socks! (PS. They pair beautifully with Timberland boots!)"
5.0,"material is good, but size is a bit going larger in most of Tommy product"
5.0,These turtle earrings are well-made and adorable.  The perfect accessory!  I receive so many compliments when I wear them.
5.0,"I got lots of compliments. Beautiful dress  Sits just below my knee. Very stretchy, and very warm! I wish they had some in a floral pattern."
5.0,Got it for my sister
5.0,Very pretty and pleased thought I purchased this beautiful piece.
5.0,I loved !!!<br />Exactamente lo que necesitaba! No súper lujosa ni sheap. Lo mas importante es cómo la combines !
5.0,"Tres sympa, par contre ca blouse pas comme sur la photo, en tout ca pas pour moi. Je ne sais plus la taille que j'avais commande, mais elle va apparaitre sur la revue, sachant que je  fais 1m60 et 50 kg."
5.0,"Has great quality and looks amazing as shown in the pictures, slightly less vibrant though."
5.0,i purchased this watch over a yr ago and it still works just like the day i purchased it and its beautiful on my wrist.
5.0,Very happy with this product. The color is exactly what I was expecting!
5.0,"The dress was a little darker than pictured, but still like it."
5.0,Good quality and fit. Fast shipping
5.0,"This body jewelry set comes with hoops, naval rings, eyebrow rings and studs for various piercings. They came in a little box bagged by “type”. I’ve not had any reaction to the jewelry. I put a few pairs in my ears and sleep, shower, workout in them and all is good so far."
5.0,Charms are very well made and quite heavy for the price.
5.0,Cute hat perfect for kids or a gag gift. Well made.

5.0,Very cute and comfortable.  True to size.

5.0,Love these earrings. Glad Charmin Charlie is back. Fast delivery.
5.0,It sparkles beautifully and 22 inches is just the right length to be visible under an open-collared shirt which is what I was aiming for when I chose the length.
5.0,I love this sweat suit!! The top is pretty cropped which I like. The material feels really nice and is kind of thick. I had to tie the strings pretty tight to keep them in place. This outfit is really great to mix and match. This will be nice to have for fall/winter or just wearing around the house. I wore the pants with a tank top to the park with my daughter and they held up perfectly so they will work well for working out too. I love this outfit and how well it fit my body!
5.0,"Worth the $10!  They were exactly what I wanted.  Large, dark enough, lightweight, and comfortable."
5.0,"I like this dopp kit a lot.  I've used it quite a few times since I purchased it.  It has a lot of space for the things I need.  It's well made and inexpensive.  I particularly like the wide mouth opening.  On a longer trip where I want all of my toiletries I load it up with the following:<br /><br />Contacts (5 pairs or more)<br />Contact solution bottle (full size bottle)<br />Face moisturizer (small bottle)<br />Beard oil (small tin)<br />Electric toothbrush (in a travel pouch)<br />Toothpaste (full sized tube)<br />Safety razor (in a leather 'holster')<br />Shaving soap (in a plastic cup)<br />Shaving brush<br />Deodorant (full size tube)<br />Cotton swabs<br /><br />That'll about fill it up and it's exactly what I bought it to hold.<br /><br />Looks great, works great, keeps all my toiletries nice and snug."

5.0,Very soft and the side pockets are perfect for phone and keys.
5.0,Nice shirt! He liked it!
5.0,"This jacket is awesome! Very complimentary to curvy figures (e.g. size 10/12 large breast, small waist & round big hips/butt) I usually wear a large & got an extra large based on the reviews. It fit comfortably for hours! Will likely order more in different colors."
5.0,Kind of small for me  but love them anyway would like to get products to try and do review on them thank you so so much
5.0,"Keeps feet warm and comfortable. Strong, should last a good while."
5.0,Was 6 yo son absolutely loves his glasses! They seem built to last and come with a great little bag to be kept in.
5.0,Recieved as a gift some time back. They are both very warm and comfortable against the skin. And they seem pretty snazzy too. Highly recommended.
5.0,I love this! It’s simple yet fashionable. You can put a lot in it. I’m very happy
5.0,Great gloves! My bf loved it as a gift. I like how they are so warmly lined and the touch screen worked great too. 10/10
5.0,its exactly like a picture. more cuttenest on person

5.0,"Once in a while I purchase something that fits just right, looks amazing and was worth every penny. This was one of those purchases!"
5.0,Super cute and fun. Just what I expected
5.0,My child say they are so comfortable to wear. The ear loops are so nice. They are breathable so nice when the kids are wearing them 8 hours in school. They wash and dry very good. The kids just love the color and patterns
5.0,Bigger than initially thought but really beautiful
5.0,I have many great tops from Doublju... I always buy size Large and they fit great!<br /> Doublju Womens 3/4 Sleeve V-Neck Lace Paneled Top runs very small.
5.0,these are awesome!!!!
5.0,So far so good. Needed this for my Gear S2 classic. Metal band was too loose and needed a tighter band for my new position at work. Fits well on the 3rd hole in. I purchased the blue as a back up if anything happens to the black one.
5.0,"Surprisingly good find! Love the material, this will be great for a hot summer day plus it doesn’t wrinkle! Very comfy."
5.0,"Nice, love them"
5.0,"I loved the color, material. It's very comfortable and flattering to the body."
5.0,"Love, love, love these boots.  Purchased black pair.  Ordering beige and another black pair."
5.0,"Dress it up, dress it down. This dress is my absolute favorite find!!!"
5.0,Feel comfortable when wearing
5.0,"This ranger belt is sturdier than most.  The strap that goes through the buckle is a thicker piece of leather than on other ranger belts I have owned.  On ranger belts, his strap tends to get cut in two by pulling against the buckle to adjust the tension.  I have read complaints from other users about this strap failing after only short usage.  You learn to be careful with the strap but it still is the most vulnerable part of the belt.<br />I also love that this belt is tanned and smells like my granddad's saddle.<br />I liked it so much that I ordered a black belt to go along with my tan belt.  This is a better than average product that I am happy to endorse and recommend.<br />."
5.0,"Very pretty, the material is soft and nice, lenght appropriate, overall I would stringly recommend it !"
5.0,My son loves it. With school starting back up he’s only 5. This will be easy for him to take off and on for lunch.

5.0,"RVing in winter weather and filling the water tank is a freezing cold job for my hands and fingers. These are great. Water never touches my hands anywhere, even if the hose sprays back on me.

There are even  pockets with in one of the main  areas so that I can organize my items and keep them from getting jumbled up. The weight  is good. It's not too heavy.  If it holds up well with use,  it will be pretty much my ideal  sling bag.!!!!"
5.0,"to keep my glasses from falling off when I go shopping, walk the dog, and all other things I do during then day."
5.0,Love the color and the fit. Iam a 15 year old girl and bought a size 5 in big kids. Great shoes.
5.0,"This is my 4th pair of Pajama Jeans!  I took some heat from my co-workers and clients when I said I was going to order my first pair.  Well, now that I've worn them to the salon, clients are now ordering pajama jeans for themselves!  They're SO COMFORTABLE and I love them!"
5.0,"A mi esposo le encantaron , súper cómodas y seguras"
5.0,I’m a true size 12 with a 40D chest. I decided to go up one size because this is a body on dress. I don’t like my clothing too tight and showing all of my flaws. I ordered an XL and it fits well. I love the material of the dress. Very cool to touch and perfect for an outdoor summer evening wedding!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:86163d5e490440049f4dfde68eb4611b]] This is so pretty, if you like furbabies, or knows someone who likes or loves furbabies, I would definitely suggest this one. I love the stones that are on the paw, they are so pretty, and catch the light perfectly. Even though they are  black cubic zirconia stones, they still sparkle beautifully.<br /><br />This also has a really nice necklace, and after pulling on it and trying to pinch it a lot, there were no kinks, so I can say that it is definitely a durable necklace and it can be worn daily. It's 18 inches long, and it has a two-inch extender, so it's pretty versatile on what size neck it will fit on, or how long you wanted to hang.<br /><br />I think it's a beautiful necklace, I love the little paw print inside of the heart, it's a great design. It also comes with a polishing cloth so that you can keep the sterling silver in a perfect and shiny condition. It's really easy to keep clean. I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review."
5.0,Great a little short but I’m tall
5.0,This was a gift & both myself and the recipient were very satisfied. Beautiful product and packaging. Intend to purchase another one.
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Thank you
5.0,i wear it as a chocker
5.0,I love how heavy it is! Also has real pockets not some tiny things that wouldn't hold a quarter. A little bit longer than expected which is a good thing!
5.0,Love how comfortable this dress is and it dresses up or down so easily
5.0,"I love this bra, perfect fit, it lifts and centers the bust achieving the minimizing effect. Also looks good!"

5.0,nice looking
5.0,I love this dress. I am loosing weight and the pattern on this dress is amazing. Makes my waist look so small. Totally in love.
5.0,"Sizing is true to size for a novelty pajama. Very comfortable. Top is cotton like material and breaths and is a nice light weight for sleeping if you don't like to be too hot. Pants can be a tad bit warmer but not much, they are a bit warmer than the top as they are made from a softer material - very comfortable. Colors are vibrant and the graphics are very well done. These were given as a gift and the person was delighted and wore them till they had to be washed : )  3 weeks later LOL"
5.0,So cute! Stretchy and comfortable! Love it
5.0,"I was a little concerned when I saw the size. I ordered XL, but packaging and tag showed 3XL. They fit, so all is good. Material is thinner than most, but it’s all good."
5.0,Beautiful and makes a great gift.
5.0,"Love This dress it's very pretty. I got it in orange, and plan on getting it in another color. Perfect dress for summer."

5.0,Good price and surprisingly attractive for the money.  Pleasantly surprised!
5.0,Great slimline design. Elegantly packaged. Bought for gift.
5.0,Perfect for my Aqua Zumba classes in the pool outside. He sun shines on the left side of my face only during classes. This hat prevents dark spots on my skin. Perfect fit. Stays on. Looks good.
5.0,Love the fit and that they stay in place!
5.0,"Was expecting plastic, was shocked at how good of quality this crown is!"
5.0,Great hat more than I expected!
5.0,"This is the perfect dress for Spring, although sleeveless the cotton is super soft and lounge worthy. I wore it to work as it has a business casual vibe. My favorite part was the pockets! Who doesn't love a dress with pockets?! And they are large enough pockets to hold my phone and keys. Bust line fit as expected and so did the waist line. The dress is long but doesn't drag the ground when I walk and I'm approx. 5'4. I normally wear a XL shirt and bottoms but as I stated, sizing was perfect. The vibrant colors and flower pattern are chic and definitely in style for this year, it pairs fabulously with some cute flats or sandals. I wore flip flops with it. The long maxi dress is flowy and loose fitting for a perfect breeze, I was thankful for that as it was almost 90 degrees outside! I received so many compliments at work and from my friends/family, they loved it! Unique and beautiful!"
5.0,Nice to pull colors together in an outfit
5.0,One I’ve rhe best so far
5.0,"I personally loved it! The fit, the style and of course the color. It arrived a few days before the All White event I had to be in attendance for. I ordered an Xl. I usually wear an L/Xl, depends on how it's made. I'm 5'9 1/2 and am about 44 inches at the hips, so it seemed like the perfect length/width for my long legs and wide hips. Lol. People at the party seemed to like the outfit on me more than I did & I loved it."
5.0,"This summer dresses everything! I ordered an extra large and it fit perfectly. The material is soft, flowy and not see through. I think I need another one. Lol!"
5.0,Great shirt…bright colors…quality material! True to size. Great buy!
5.0,Bought this as a gift & he loved it
5.0,Great! My family loves these!
5.0,"These head nets are perfect for keeping off the mosquitoes, which are particularly voracious this year. They are roomy enough to put over a hat, which is great."
5.0,"I have only been using this product for a few days, and it definitely seems to be making a difference.  It has not completely eliminated the fog, but has made a noticeable improvement.  I suspect that with additional applications, it will continue to improve.  A product worth trying for anyone wearing glasses!"
5.0,All the earrings were beautiful. Packaging was great and all earrings were fashionable.
5.0,Superior quality
5.0,"These feel great. The leather is nice and soft and the fabric inside is smooth and keeps the hands warm.<br /><br />It does work with touchscreens, but it is not very accurate which shouldn't be a big surprise."
5.0,"Easy to walk in, perfect for the office & a quick walk over lunch. I'm usually a flats wearer & i hardly notice i'm wearing a bit of a heel"
5.0,"Going by body measurements i figured the 3x would be right.  I wear a solid size 18 or xl in American sizes and my arms and legs arenpretty swollen.  This fit exactly and  there is an in-seam that could technically be let out to allow for extra room tho i don‘t know how that would work for the neckline.  I am very happy with the product size, look and fit.  The neckline fits pretty high which is an awkward feel but looks okay."
5.0,"This is my second ratcheting belt.  They are a bit more difficult to take on and off, but they are much better at getting a proper fit.  Many times with the old fashion type, one notch is too loose and the next is too tight.<br /><br />Only minor issue is some dress pants need a fairly narrow belt due to the loops being small.  This belt works on most pants, but if you have the real narrow loops, it may be a bit too wide.<br /><br />It is very easy to cut a long belt to make a belt that is perfect for you."
5.0,"Easy to handle, good material, perfect for the job."
5.0,Fits a little to tight around my knee area.
5.0,I really like it. Prefect length and comfortable to wear.
5.0,Was looking for traditional looking automotive work shirts i grew up with. Found the design and rugged quality
5.0,These are awesome and slimming! I wish I could get more patterns but they seem to be sold out of all the &#34;good&#34; ones.  I will get more.  The lining is perfect for winter/fall outdoors stuff and comfy.

5.0,This was my daughter’s Christmas present. She is in love with it. Fits great.
5.0,"I'm 5'6, 34A and around 130ish lbs and got a small. Fit perfectly! Doesn't cut into my armpits and the band under the bra part is thick and the perfect tightness :) Very happy and probably will order more!!"
5.0,I was so stoked to receive these. I wear a bandana under my hard hat to keep my face somewhat dry. I literally have every color I could ever need now.
5.0,Awesome dress.

5.0,So many compliments on the color and fit. Would definitely recommend it.
5.0,"I loved this dress! I got a lot of compliments on it, I wore it to a wedding in San Diego and it was perfect! I wore it with low heels and I am a bit shorter than the average but it was perfect height. I believe some people said it hit at their ankles but since I am shorter than most, it was the perfect height for me.<br /><br />I can't wait to wear it again for another event because it was just that pretty!"
5.0,Its a very nice chain good detail and she wears it alot
5.0,I love these performance shirts with beautiful pictures of National Parks on them.
5.0,i love it .
5.0,"The color is as ordered. It fits perfectly. It can seem a teeny bit on the heavy side, but it is a lot of material...but not too much.  The material is thin which is a plus if wearing in the summer time."
5.0,Love these gloves.  They worked so well that I ordered a second pair for back up and I also ordered a pair for a friend of mine.
5.0,This sneaker is great because it works for any occasion to dress up your children. They are flexible and easy to put on. It comes in different colors. The cotton material is great and the shoe seems to be durable over time. I will love to buy this shoe in other colors. Do follow the sizing recommendations.
5.0,"I have good vision at distance, but not good for reading. I got the 1.25/2.50. These let me watch the road through the top but also read my GPS through the bottom. It was exactly what I hoped for."
5.0,Love the flexibility to change to different rings and have so many
5.0,super cute and perfect size. Good quality as nothing has fallen
5.0,"Beautiful,just the right size"
5.0,I liked the the picture and the logo on the tee shirt. The color combination was also nice.
5.0,"I haven’t actually worn it yet, but have tried it on finding it fits as advertised. Belt is dressy and very attractive."
5.0,"I adore this dress it is extremely versatile and can be casual or dressy. The dress can be worn with flats, tennis shoes and boots. The material is synthetic but does not feel scratchy or anything. The weave is full and hefty but not heavy and the color is perfect for autumn and early winter. The front has small darted holes that do allow for air to seep in so this would not be good for winter to keep warm without a jacket. The turtleneck makes the dress feel comfortable and cosy, it is the feature I like most about the dress."
5.0,"Great value, well made product"
5.0,Product was as described. Given to my baby sister for Christmas and she loved it. She just bought herself a brand new car and thought she’d like a brand new keychain.

5.0,"Very small, but very cute! My girlfriend loves it. She loves the necklace so much she is afraid to wear it😂"
5.0,"Very comfortable and pretty . If you have a larger chest, you may benefit from some fashion tape, as the top does tend to unfold/open a bit at the edges. But overall, I enjoyed this for my cousins wedding. Fit very well at 7 months pregnant too ."
5.0,Finally a strap that  holds glasses without them falling off because of the long cord.  My husband loves them so I am a happy camper
5.0,Es cómoda y agradable  me gustó mucho  espero que a futuro saquen nueva mercadería con otros diseños son los mejores en lo que hacen realize una buena compra

5.0,Just what I wanted. Fast shipping.
5.0,"I originally bought this to be a backup for my other swimsuit for an upcoming cruise (which I just got back from last Friday), end up never wearing the other one. Was incredibly surprised when I tried this on when it came in and it actually FIT, given the various sizing reviews that it had gotten previously. Am 5 foot 5, about 136, athletic build, and the size Large fit. Bottom was a wee bit snug, but it stretched and worked out fine. Fiance loved it on me, always a nice plus. ;-)"

5.0,"Tested with 450nm 10watt laser and 30 watt 395nm UV light. Cut both down significantly. The laser is quite intense and while I still wouldn’t look directly at the dot, all reflected or scattered light was eliminated. Only aware of light intensity from peripheral vision."
5.0,Very comfortable for hubby ordered 2 colors 2  different orders! Awesome pajamas
5.0,"My husband loved it, it fits and it’s great for doing anything, even holding hands, it’s like it’s not there."

5.0,"This is a cute comfortable dress. The quality is great especially for the price. I would buy this one again. The sleeves and total length are long on me since I’m short, but the way the dress is cut, it doesn’t really matter."
5.0,Bought two different colors for my grandson for Christmas and he loves them!  They are soft and fit him great.  It was a WIN!!!!
5.0,These are awesome.  Love them for the gym.  Way worth the money
5.0,"A nice keychain. It's huge, but the quality is good, so I wasn't disappointed. It does have a clear coating over the top of the design, so I don't worry about it scratching as easily."
5.0,My husband is crazy about this can this be engraved?
5.0,Huge hit at the birthday party!!!! Size was very true to what it said online!
5.0,"I bought (2) pairs and only received one pair. I like the way they fit. They are comfortable and working 12 hour shifts, my legs weren't tired at all!!! I love them so much that I'm buying more of them. I just hope I get both pairs this time"
5.0,I accidentally ordered the gold and black wanting the Black & White.  I emailed my mistake before it was shipped.  The correct B&W scarf arrived.  Shipper is the best.  I love this scarf.  Light and airy perfect for the spring and summer.  Thank you.
5.0,"Love these. Linen material, very breathable, not too short."
5.0,I really love this necklace. It's dainty but not too small and looks pretty high quality. The packaging was super cute too. So far it's holding up good but I'll edit this if it breaks anytime soon. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"I'm a junior S, or petite xs (5'2, 105, 34D). Got the small and it fits me very well. It's very form fitting so it does show imperfections easily. The sweater is on thinner side, slightly translucent, but soft and comfortable with a bit of stretch. I'm guessing I can even get away with xs but it would be tight. Like another reviewer said, the turtle neck doesn't choke or restrict breathing, which is crucial to me as I am very sensitive and would get a headache super fast if it did. Glad it doesn't.  Would love to have it in more colors. Definitely size up if your normal sizing is women's sizes."
5.0,"Very cute and thicker material, not see through I order the more blue and purple looking color and it looks exactly like the pic. Is alittle long but I did order in a large and iam only 5'4. Over all very cute would recommend."

The company fully refunded my purchase and Amazon fully refunded the international shipping!  All email interactions were also super prompt.  Also I literally get compliments on the boots every time I wear them.  One time a lady yelled from across campus, &#34;Damn gurl you put that outfit on!!! WOOOO!&#34;"
5.0,"Bought this dress for my fiancee's Christmas party in December and when I tried it on... GORGEOUS. The material is soft and the dress is beautiful! Great buy! I got a size medium and I'm 160 lbs 5'4""."

5.0,"Cute shirt, nice details"
5.0,"Bought these socks for my daughter who works at a barn and is on her feet all day. I notice that she wears them first over her other socks. I feel that the compression is a good idea. If you are between 2 sizes, would recommend the smaller size for a woman."
5.0,"I am pear shaped and this dress fits me perfect.  It is so soft and comfy and glides over my hips with extra room so it hides all my flaws.  I love the color.  I’m tall, 5’10”, so will wear this as a long tunic with yoga pants.  It’s true to size."
5.0,Loved the three bands. Colors go with most anything.
5.0,"Somewhat large, not super comfortable but very cute and good for the price. I will probably just put inserts in and solve both of those problems"
5.0,My granddaughter loves it.  That’s good enough for me

5.0,We have a survivable watch at modest cost.  Good times!

5.0,"I got these because I liked the design, but wasn’t expecting much because they were priced so cheap. They feel and look great, plus they came with a soft case, polishing cloth and even a mini screwdriver to tighten screws if they come loose. Really nice glasses."

5.0,Very nice sunglasses.  Comparable to much higher priced sunglasses.
5.0,My favorite workout/lounge  shirt.<br />Flattering on my frame<br />5’7 and about 155-165 pounds.<br />The open back is just the right size to conceal my problem areas on my back (I carry a bit of fat in the side boob region as well as on my lats) yet shows enough to be sexy and make me feel confident.
5.0,My daughter is 17 and it is tough finding a dance recital gift now that she is older.  I usually don't bring flowers since they don't last too long. This was pretty and well- made. She loves it.

5.0,High quality.  Better made than the Saks straps (much pricier) I used to buy.
5.0,very great like it.
5.0,Perfect for travel!  Kept the sub out of my eyes by the pool in Hawaii and still kept its shape even though I just crumpled it up in my suitcase.  Great convenient travel hat.  The brim is a little longer than I expected but I didn't mind at all.  I got it more for practical use even though it is pretty stylish for the price!
5.0,"I love this outfit, fits amazing."
5.0,Nice lights weight face masks that don’t interfere with glasses and hearing aids!!!!!!
5.0,Super soft and fits great!

5.0,Looks beautiful!
5.0,This is a very comfortable bracelet.  The Swarovski crystals are beautiful. I already had a gold plated bracelet and that is why I bought it. The color of the Swarovski  crystals look like opals.  A wonderful purchase from Amazon. The designer is awesome . Will continue to shop with Amazon.com.  They have great deals!
5.0,My granddaughter loved it!!!
5.0,Love the color and the concept
5.0,Love th bracelet I wear this bracelet everyday
5.0,"I read the other reviews regarding size and ordered one size smaller. It is cute, and will be great for summer. The only drawback I see is that it will have to be ironed after washing it."
5.0,I don't think my dd has worn any other earrings since receiving these.
5.0,"It is the go to basic toiletry bag. It literally can hold all of my makeup, brushes, and even toothpaste and toothbrushes in the side pockets! Love it."

5.0,"Received quickly, no faults in the hat and it fits great."
5.0,"My kids love this set! This was a home run... no, wait... scored a TOUCHDOWN with this purchase! Can't say how long the football itself will last, especially with the kids constantly leaving stuff exposed to the elements, bu they both love the size of the ball and how easy it is for them to throw and catch (ages 7 and 10). The belts are pretty useful and the velcro tab attachments seem to have sturdy stitching."
5.0,"I bought this for my husband to use as a travel laundry bag. Although just a touch heavier (minuscule difference) than the cheapo mesh bags, it's 100x better quality! This could hold so much more than just laundry. I love the navy color too!"
5.0,"They are the best glasses I’ve ever worn, it really helps with protecting my eyes against screens. Recommended product for sure!"
5.0,Love them! Fits perfectly! Got it in a large and I am 5'6 and about 167 lbs.
5.0,This shirt is perfect I am sooo in love with it the material is super soft the design is beautiful and it washes amazingly<br />  Thank you
5.0,These looked so cute on my daughter's feet for her photo shoot
5.0,"About a week ago, I was browsing Amazon looking for a watch for my wife. She wanted a Timex Easy Reader, but while I was doing my search I came across this watch. I figured -- at $40 -- why not. I didn't need another watch as my watch box is full, but I was intrigued by this one.<br /><br />When my packaged arrived, the watch was housed in a beautiful and sturdy gift box. Casio should take note. But before opening said box, I wasn't sure what to expect as there weren't many reviews and no photos of it.<br /><br />I must say after opening the box I was very pleasantly surprised. The photos for this listing does not due this watch any justice. But it does depend on the lighting. The case looks brown in soft lighting, but under brighter lights -- say florescent -- the case has copper tones. Same for the watch face, which is silver. It can look almost white to a darker gray. Again it depends on the lighting.<br /><br />As for the chronograph function, it works for me. The chronograph second hand hits all of the ticks and it resets back to zero.<br /><br />The one downer -- at least for me -- is the NATO strap. Not a fan. I knew that going in. In fact, I have several Army green canvas watch straps in my Amazon cart as we speak. But as I decide which one to get, I put this Timex on a RECHERE Mesh Stainless Steel Bracelet I bought here on Amazon last spring for a Seiko diver. I think it looks great. Adds a little weight to a light watch and it matches well since the chronograph buttons and crown are silver.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found a nice Army green canvas watch band here on Amazon. I think it evens looks better on this Timex."
5.0,this is the lightest shirt you can get. its like gauze. just right for the carribian. there are similar shirts on amazon but none as light as this one. I bought a few and am gong to dye in some other colors. order large at least one size up. same shirts in Jamaica go for $60+
5.0,Product was shipped promptly for my son’s birthday party. Was soft and fit him wonderfully. It’s still a favorite of his even after the 🎈 party!
5.0,Can you hear me now?  No I cannot.
5.0,was very please with quality and color.
5.0,I own two pair! I love these! Super cute
5.0,These are the cutest!  I get asked all the time where we got them!  They are easy to use and durable!  Absolutely adorable!
5.0,it was so sleek.. very nice and sophisticated looking.. i highly recommend
5.0,These are great!  Smaller size fits good and cuts out almost all the wind when riding.  I have bought probably ten pair of riding sunglasses and none fit great and cut out the wind.  These look cool and work better than more expensive sunglasses!
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my wife, and she professes to love it! It is a nice sized amethyst, and has a lovely pale purple color. Reflects light nicely! Came in a nice giftable box. We're very happy with our purchase."
5.0,Perfect shirt and no need for mask
5.0,"Colors and quality are great, fit a bit more snug than I like but that's because of my build being more muscular."
5.0,"Beautiful rich color, very comfortable, great value. The material is so soft and silky. I love that it came in a large size."
5.0,Timely arrival. Socks are great. I will buy more.
5.0,"I have some pieces of turquoise that I like, a watch and pendant, but I don't often wear earrings. These are delightful just because they are so small. I've had more compliments on them than on most of my other earrings"
5.0,This skirt is amazing! I think its my new favorite skirt. I used the waist tie as a neck tie and it worked out perfectly.
5.0,A funeral service
5.0,Just the right size.
5.0,very pleased & great price.
5.0,I wore this hat to a Kentucky Derby party. It was a hit and looked awesome! Quick delivery and it was packaged with care. I was very impressed with how well it was made as well! I would buy it all over again!!
5.0,my kids love this thing
5.0,"These earrings are just what I needed as a basic accessory.  The design and style are quite attractive.  I also like that, as hoops, they are not too heavy"
5.0,These were perfect for long temples and the adjustable nose pads were great.
5.0,"Awesome, just as advertised."
5.0,This was a gift for an avid Nuggets fan.  He loves the old logo and this was a great find for him.  The quality is great and it was shipped quickly.
5.0,I have had many shirts but this one by far is perfect great product and price
5.0,"Soft, comfortable material and pretty design. Not fitting but flowing. Looks so nice with blazer for work (medium)"
5.0,Does the job! Cute
5.0,"I picked my size according to the size chart, it fits me perfectly.  It comes with an extension clip which adds about 1.5 inch and the straps are adjustable so I think it should be fine if you order according to the size chart.<br /><br />I really like the texture of the material, very soft and comfortable.  92% nylon and 8% spandex, doesn't have any under wire but the material really provides good support.  Some maternity bras are either too thin, too soft, or lack elasticity, this bra from Topwhere is perfect.  The tightness is just right, the extension clip really comes in handy because our bodies are going through different stages of the pregnancy.  The snaps are really well made, easy to snap and unsnap.  There's an opening for nursing pads, a bit small in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall good product, would recommend!  Sample given."
5.0,Love the jeans :)
5.0,5 srar
5.0,The material is very sturdy but I felt the fit was small. I liked it so much I ordered three more in a size up. Gifted the smaller ones to my spin instructor.
5.0,I received many compliments whenever I wear these earrings. I like them a lot.
5.0,Like the soft leather
5.0,"great condition, fast delivery, good quality, thank you"
5.0,These worked great. Adds extra protection.
5.0,"Very cute, definitely titanium. I have really sensitive ears and cannot wear anything but gold and apparently titanium. These worked great! Still wearing them months later!"
5.0,Great for out in hot sun
5.0,straps look and fit great and the quality is good.
5.0,"The style is great. Just got it but if it functions like the others purchased, it will remain a nice watch."
5.0,"I LOVE these earrings. Pretty, decent weight.  I can only wear gold, so they are happy on my ears!"
5.0,This is an adorable outfit on my granddaughter.
5.0,Eazy to wear
5.0,So cute! Buy it! Great price
5.0,Small. Good for kindergarten age
5.0,These socks feel amazing. It fits my archs perfect. Do not show in my tennis shoes. Warm but not hot. Highly recommend these socks. Perfect to size.
5.0,"Classy, unique, with a spin of vintage taste. This shirt has become one of my arsenal of daily wear. It can be worn tucked for a formal undershirt under a nice blazer, or untucked for a more laid back relaxed summer look.<br /><br />It fits perfectly, not baggy, but not too tight in my size. Would recommend. :)"
5.0,"I'm in love with this top! I cant even begin to say enough about it from the beautiful crochet lace that is stitched on tight you have no fear of taring it off when placing the blouse on. The fact that the fabric is so soft against your ski, the color was also on point with the picture everything I wanted out of this top I got I did order a size up from the reviews and it fit perfect so I would keep that in mind when ordering,"
5.0,"The clover token is just what I had hoped it would be. The clover has been dried in a position that is perfect. The token is a nice size. I am so happy with my order that I am ordering another. I think it is a great little symbol gift when you want to show support for someone, celebrate a milestone, or wish someone well when they are moving away."
5.0,Bought it for my 11 year old and she loves it!
5.0,My little girl is special needs and has a lot of sensory issues. School can be extremely overwhelming to her. So much that there are days she will try to run out of the school because of the overstimulation. We bought her this hat because we noticed she like pressure on her head. I was a little skeptical at first because this hat was so much cheaper in price than the other ones I had seen online. I did like that it was one we could afford and wasn't as bulky as the others. When we received it in the mail I was shocked to see how well made it was. Once she put it on you could just see the relief in her face and posture. You could physically see her relax. That was about six months ago and the hat still looks brand new. My daughter refused to wear any type of hat before this one. She has worn it to school everyday since we received it. It has helped her stay calm and safe due to it being able to meet her sensory needs. I HIGHLY recommended this to other families.
5.0,Love the design & use of lightweight fabrics for a sporty look.
5.0,Father’s Day gift from kids for grandfather
5.0,Bachelorette weekend get away girls night out.
5.0,this dress are so comfortable the material is soft but runs small you have to pick bigger size then normal size
5.0,"A Gift to my Beautiful Wife, very elegant, lovely cut.....thanks"
5.0,I bought it for my boyfriend an he absolutely loves it!
5.0,these shoes give my son a great deal of stability and surety.  He is thrilled to have them.
5.0,I was looking for just a plain black pointy heel for work. This shoe is exactly what I was looking for looks just like the pictures online. Now only thing is normally I wear size 6 in all shoes and this shoe only came in a 6.5 which would be fine too since I would be wearing socks. But it felt like if I had order a size 6 not 6.5 so not to big at all fits perfect which maybe cause its a pointy toe?  But also I have ordered boots in 6.5 and wasnt big so wasnt a big deal for me to order a size 6.5. Have only worn them with an insole to have cushion to be comfortable. Feels like the shoe is made good too.
5.0,I just got my order today it came in earlier then expected. The shipping was a little expensive but so far worth it . It's exactly what I ordered and its the perfect size.
5.0,"Very comfortable, breathable  and fit perfectly ,good quality"
5.0,Fits great! Love the color and flexible material.
5.0,Love my Egyptian bracelet. It wards off bad bosses.
5.0,"Beautiful! This set of rings speaks for its self. I love it. The design of this ring is gorgeous. Packaged beautifully. Comes in a pretty ring box, with a gift bag, piece of tissue paper, warranty ID card, certificate of authenticity, a cleaning cloth, a brochure with information about the ring, and a for you card. Totally recommend!"
5.0,"The quality of the glasses are a lot stronger than how much i imagined for the price! Also, getting 3 in these specific colors complement absolutely any outfit! LOVE!"
5.0,I Love this gown! I bought 4 different ones size medium which I do wear I should have gotten large my shoulders are broad!
5.0,"Wonderful, loved them!"
5.0,Just what you’d expect from slippers!
5.0,Great quality and cute colors! Will definitely order more!
5.0,I was so pleased with this product and was very proud to give it as a gift.
5.0,"Es un arete de buena calidad, en su cristal, su clip y la circonia. Trabajo bien hecho, firme y de buen aspecto. Hecho para personas mayores."
5.0,Love the colors. Wish they were slightly longer but really love wearing them when it is cold outside!
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Very nice quality. A must for everyone who is a Tiger fan and owns an Italian Charm Bracelet.
5.0,First off the socks work great and the price was also a plus. I plan on ordering more as I’m a diabetic with 3rd and 4th toe amputation plus the metatarsal and Dr recommended compression socks to improve circulation.<br />I did have one problem and that was the email that was to give me info on the sock it just a black space on the email and I cannot see anything.
5.0,Very study and surprisingly versatile
5.0,"Love this cloth, use it a lot!"
5.0,"Beautiful dress! My daughter was in love!!!!!! She’s a size 3t. We order the 3-4 it was a little big big around the under arm area but it was totally wearable, no big deal! She looked like a princess!"
5.0,"Fit well. I was worried because I'm 5'3"" & super hippy but the pants fit well. Wasn't sure how I felt about my belly being out as much at 50, but the husband liked it soooo..."
5.0,Good material and quality for the price. Fit as expected- just a tiny bit extra room to grow into for my almost 5 year old.
5.0,There awesome
5.0,"Nice and thin for warmer weather. Good shirt, thinking about getting another color."
5.0,"IMHO I believe wearing PPE is and investment and more economical that a trip to the emergency room or hospital stay. I would recommend these chaps for farm, home or ranch work. I put this pair to the test while cutting up three large trees that were removed for safety reasons. (Three replacements will be planted in a more suitable location.) I’ve suited up with the chaps several times and once adjusted, they are comfortable and fit like a glove. And yes, these, and any chaps are hot to wear during warmer weather.  The material appears to be quality and fortunately I have not had a situation requiring them to stop the blade and prevent injury.  The only downside to share is the leg attachments (male/female components) are plastic and could be a tad bit more ruggedized. The good news is they attach behind your legs and should be out of the way of impact. However, with tree work, one must be prepared for anything. I selected the size for my height and the fit was spot on. I recommend this product. Now, time to suit up and start cutting."
5.0,"I love this compression shirt. Fits tight to the skin, but comfortable as expected. An awesome shirt for bicep days at the gym! I ended up buying another with a different design. Wearing one of these while working out is likely the closest I'll ever get to being a Saiyan, lol."
5.0,So many compliments.  Need to wear with little bootie socks.
5.0,Light and airy dress perfect for summer! It wasn’t see through and fabric was a nice quality. I ordered a large to accommodate my postpartum and nursing physic. The ruffles overwhelmed my narrow shoulders and added volume to my chest so it wasn’t the best look for me. I do believe it would be absolutely wonderful on a taller or smaller-chested frame.
5.0,Very cute picture if Eeyore. Wish it had a nose piece.
5.0,"When it's chilly, you don't want a nightgown to ride up during the night as they all seem to. This one has stretch in addition to 90% cotton plus long sleeves, so it keeps you covered. Also, I like the buttons in front to cool off when needed, and the collar keeps you warm. I weigh 130 lbs and am 5 ft tall, so the small/medium fits perfectly. I noticed no shrinkage at all after washing and drying on medium."
5.0,"I’m not sure... It was a Gift, and she ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT !!  So I’m guessing it was a hit outta the park :)"
5.0,"Great suit, awesome deal!!"
5.0,These sandals are adorable and they fit well. I love the look because it matches well with any style of clothing. You can dress them up or wear them as casual wear.<br /><br />My two year old wears a size 6 so I purchased the 6.5 and it fits him well with a little extra toe room as I had hoped it would. He can run freely in these shoes and even after 3 hours at the park his feet showed no signs of blisters or rubbing. The shoes are solid and well made but not too heavy or bulky. We are very happy with them.<br /><br />Product was purchased with a promotional discount for review.
5.0,Bought this sweatshirt for my daughter. She likes over sized sweatshirts so we got a 2x and it was big just like she wanted it. We have washed it and no shrinkage and we let it air dry. Material is great not too thick and not too thin.  She’s 5’5 and weights 160 pounds hope this helped
5.0,"This product is way worth the money, and so many cute designs to choose from 😂"
5.0,Perfect for summer 😍😍😍😍😍
5.0,"Good quality material, fits well. Surprised how big the 4X came. I'm 6'2, 320 and it fits just tight enough for some compression and gives a great sweat."
5.0,Did I mention comfy? Super super comfy.
5.0,"I bought these shoes to go to a dinner, they fit perfectly as expected. The color is subtle and kind of pastel. The quality of the actual shoe is great they’re very sturdy, I walked and danced all night and They endured through it all without problem. Would definitely recommend it."
5.0,"Love my shoes, fit as expected."
5.0,"Best sunglasses I ever had. My goodness , love it!"

5.0,Fits normal size. So soft perfect foe loungers or out and aboutà
5.0,"This fits as expected. This is soft, stretchy and comfortable! You don’t know exactly what you will get because the pattern placement is different on each one. Very glad I bought this."
5.0,Loved this sweater is definitely oversized which is what I wanted! Was perfect for my California trip and the chilly weather up there. If you don’t like an oversized look I definitely recommend sizing down!
5.0,"This is my second pair of these earrings. I was afraid I might lose one and since I wear them fequently, a second pair is my assurance AND insurance I will always have them available! Their colorful sparkle brings many nice comments from friends."
5.0,This purse is nice in person.
5.0,"Lighter weight than expected. 85% cotton, 15% flax, use care wash/dry. I ordered LG. I'm 5'7"" and 170#."
5.0,I gave this as a gift and she loved it
5.0,We own a bulldog so we get a bulldog calendar every year. This year we opted for one with puppies. We are very pleased with our purchase and with the speed of delivery.
5.0,Love this gown. It is so soft.
5.0,Awesome. Will not travel without it.
5.0,Very cute necklace- it looked exactly like the picture!
5.0,"Much thicker/heavier than a dog tag. This keychain charm doesn't feel like it was haphazardly stamped. It's a good quality, and a nice reminder/encouragement."
5.0,Awesome<br />Hanging from my mirror now
5.0,AWSOME PRODUCT !!!! It was a hit!!!
5.0,"Really nice sweats, But returning. Purchased size small but fits a bit too big will re-purchase for an extra small"
5.0,"Very easy to read and does everything I want it to. This thing is built to last and endure basically  life can throw at it (minus deep sea diving). Keeps time well and is very dependable, had it in the shower multiple times and in the pool and it's held up. If you need a functional and dependable watch at a very low price that has some cool factor, this is certainly the watch for you."
5.0,Great Christmas stocking gifts. Looks JUST like the pictures
5.0,Great.product for the price. Real impressed with things I've. Bought from tailwind jewelry ltd. I actually ordered four more items from them. Still looking forward to receiving these. Hope I'm not disappointed. Previously bought a turquoise  necklace from them I enjoy wearing as I usually get compliments when I wear it.
5.0,Love how it doesn't not slip off like other no shows. I now wear these as my everyday socks with no issues!
5.0,Wore on my graduation night! So cute
5.0,"ran a little large, I thought, thet colors were very bright an vibrant.  the fabric is not at all absorbent, but very silky feeling and flows with movement"
5.0,Beautiful bracelet and very much unisex.  Great color and size.  It's magnetic and also has a safety notch which is wonderful because magnets can get pulled apart easily.  It also comes in a lovely black velvet pouch.  I would highly recommend!  I did receive this item at a reduced cost for review but all opinions are my own!
5.0,very comfortable! it's exactly as in the pictures
5.0,"The quality of the bracelet is excellent, and the story behind the beads is cleverly thought of and charming.  I wore it for almost ten years until the black started fading from the three square beads, so I just ordered a new one!"

5.0,Muy lindo gracias Amazon
5.0,"Honestly I liked the look of the necklace based on the photos, but I am always skeptical of how &#34;cheap&#34; the product actually looks when it shows up.... this necklace exceeded my expectations for what I thought I was getting.  It is heavy, it's quality materials, and it looks a lot more expensive than it costs.  I am very pleased with this product."
5.0,Nothing and like that works with batteries and electricity
5.0,This is my fancy going out watch and I like it a lot. Looks good and keeps on tickin

5.0,I like these a lot.
5.0,Cable knit sweater
5.0,Thank you my daughter loves it
5.0,Perfect fit.  I had to go up two sizes.  Looks just like the picture and great quality fabric.
5.0,"Really like this dress! Super stretchy and comfy, sucks you in, and you can wear a racer back bra under it without the straps sticking out."
5.0,loved the colors could not find in stores only here on amazon thanks
5.0,Love my pajama jeans!! They are so comfortable and no one knows they are pajama jeans. Would definitely buy them again!
5.0,"Got these for Mr. Clause. The ones that came with his suit was very short. Plus he is a big man, just needed something bigger and longer and these worked out great."
5.0,My grandchild  loved it and it fit very well.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my girl and it looked amazing on her. Fabric is really soft and thin enough for summer wear. Is slightly see through so you’ll need to take that into account on what you wear under it
5.0,Best product ever! A must buy! It really snatch you in and you decide how tight you want it to be
5.0,"This thing is a beauty! I ordered an Anchor Hocking high ball glass similar to this but  i returned it because it didn't look the same as the one advertised.<br /><br />I was skeptical in ordering this at first thinking that it would look like an ordinary glass in a small restaurant. Im happy I took a chance on this. The glass is on the heavy side and felt like the expensive crystal glasses.<br /><br />The bottom of the glass has some dip on it so it will have some water in when you put it in the dishwasher. My husband said that the dip under the glass helps in keeping it stable. Plus I really don't mind the little water there.  I have a lot of items that does that when I wash them in the dishwasher.<br /><br />One downside is the sticker on the side. It doesnt come off easily. After first wash, it was still there and didn't even budge from the hot water in the dishwasher. I had to take them off after the first wash then run another wash to get the leftover sticky part.<br /><br />All in all I'm happy I gave this company a chance. They surely made a beautiful and sturdy glass!"
5.0,My husband has always had a pocket watch.  They do break with (man's outdoor) use.  He so far really likes the dial and contrast of black and white.  Thank you.
5.0,"Good delivery time, bag string fell off, but for 99 cents, it's alright. Bracelets are alright too."
5.0,So cheap I bought two pairs to leave in the car in case I lose my nice glasses.  I can't buy regular sunglasses for this price so it's a great deal for me.  And these are polarized sunglasses.
5.0,"Easily accommodates everything that I carry. Pockets in many places. Also, great quality."
5.0,I love my new sweater I plan to buy more in different colors.
5.0,"These are a bit heavy on the ear but they are beautiful and have a lot of debris in the amber, which makes them interesting.  I do love them..."
5.0,this is a warm jacket but it needs to be longer in length if you are tall.
5.0,I am cautious because I have sensitive skills and these earrings I had no irritation
5.0,Grandson loved this.
5.0,I can't write a review on shipping or quality. Ordered it for a friend to their house. I'm assuming it was a great product as he's never mentioned it upon receiving/
5.0,Love the material. Love the way the material feels.
5.0,Product was great! Daughter looks adorable in it!
5.0,shoes on much easer
5.0,"I chose the 4mm size, and they fit nicely. I like small earrings, and these are perfect. I had not tried screw back earrings before, so it took a few tries to get the backs in place. They are tiny. However, this means that my hairbrush doesn't catch on them as frequently, and they don't pop off and get lost."
5.0,"super lightweight, really nice shape and good value"
5.0,Great look to the band
5.0,It's a zebra lanyard; it would be hard to mess this up.
5.0,seem like quality
5.0,"These are much prettier and nicer than I had expected for the price. Fun to wear and though I wish they were just a little longer, I am very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"great price, great product. fast shipping. I would buy from this seller again"
5.0,"Love the material, super flowy and feels amazing. Would highly recommend. Doesn't look cheap, and the elastic waistband wasn't overly tight"
5.0,"I was not sure what to expect from this as I am a plus size girl.  This is beautiful.  It is so soft to the touch and will be great for the winter months in the south when you just need something extra.  This is very large and can almost be used as a throw type blanket over your shoulders.  It is not thick, but will look great for grabbing a small blanket/jacket/shawl when it is a little colder."
5.0,I LOVE IT SO MUCH
5.0,These earrings have exceeded my expectations. They sparkle like real diamonds.  I think that this is an exceptional deal for only a penny. It just doesn't get any better than this.
5.0,Thick and good loose fit
5.0,"This gym ensemble is a MUST. Super cute, super sporty and the fit is excellent. It hugs your curves without digging into your skin. The material lets your skin breath while working out and stretches when necessary. Love it"
5.0,Very comfortable. Well worth the money.
5.0,I liket .
5.0,Product is about 1 size larger
5.0,These are for my teenage sons and they are very pleased with the product!
5.0,"This dress has such soft material and fits like a glove, it hugs my body just right.  I weight 128, 5'5 and I ordered a small. Above the knee. Very pretty on."
5.0,"I gave the socks for a gift to a friend Who has circulation problems and swelling.  After trying several brands with the same effect, he reports these socks make a big difference in the pain and swelling all day.  Best compression hose by far."
5.0,Wish this shirt came in more colors!
5.0,The crossbody fabric will need to be pinned to stay in place to not expose your bra but other then that this dress is so gorgeous
5.0,I'm very happy with this bag.  The leather is beautiful (smells great!) and it is well made.  There are just enough pockets with just enough variation to meet my needs.
5.0,Great club wear
5.0,This is such a cute and unique bag! I love everything about it. I will tell you because I was unaware the bunnies have nose rings but I thought it added to the cuteness!
5.0,"nice fabric, perfect for outdoor activities,good purchase"
5.0,"First, I had a coupon so paid about half the price for this sweatshirt which was amazing! I love the side pockets so they are two separate. pockets and do not join.  I like that this has a high neck, but no hood so it will fit in a coat no problem.  It is long enough in the back so I can wear leggings without being self conscious.  I weigh about 120 lbs and am 5 feet tall and a small fits perfectly!"
5.0,I get complimented on this necklace every time I wear it
5.0,Perfect fit and looks great on
5.0,My favorite dress.
5.0,I love the fit of this dress. The picture was right on. It is made very well. I'm going to wear it to a beach wedding so I'm very pleased. Light and flowy too.
5.0,Sooo adorable for colder weather!!!!
5.0,Good Quality like they got three for the price
5.0,I use these to go around my rolls of wrapping paper and vinyl.  They hold them tight
5.0,Nice UGGS but too large.
5.0,The luggage is made in perfection and is really tough and durable. Its very light for its size and has fantastic texture & finish. I cannot find any faults in the craftsmanship.<br />It has a TSA combination lock factory fitted and is spacious with good quality fabric. For the price I couldn't have asked for any more.<br />The 4 wheels move well and smoothly and the handle is sturdy and strongly built.<br /><br />If you are looking for looking for long lasting stylish luggage look no further. Fergé has always made good products in the past too. I have 4 luggage of Fergé in Total which are doing very well and have been overseas many times.
5.0,The size is perfect for toting a  tablet and all my daughter's teaching supplies. Plenty of individual spots to stash all kinds  of things.
5.0,"I really like this bag.  The embedded design on the outside reminds me of hieroglyphics.  It's a larger bag, which is nice for carrying all of my essentials.  It came pretty quickly too."
5.0,Very well made. Pretty detail. My daughter loved it!
5.0,"One of the best shorts I ever ordered on amazon.  Very soft and made will, true to size, the inseam and leg openings are perfect and I usually have an issue with this because I have a small inseam. The pockets are nice and deep not something you normally find on women’s shorts so a big 👍’s up for that as well as everything I mentioned above. Was well packaged and very quick delivery. I’m very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,I been monitoring this watch forever ...I got it for $240.00 hard to get .it was $399 for a year finally went down . In my humble opinion the best presidential homage there is with a robust movement.
5.0,I put these pants on as soon as I opened the package and wore them the rest of the day.  Got up the next day and wore them again.  These are so comfortable and look AWESOME! I'm going to need more than one pair.  Wish they were available in more colors.
5.0,"I was wanting to ride my bike, but my seat was not as comfortable as I would have like. I purchasing these padded shorts has made bike riding so much more fun."
5.0,"great product, holds shape well"
5.0,I love how simple and easy they are to unbuckle.
5.0,Good looking Hat
5.0,Easily one of my favorite things I've bought on Amazon. Works well and comes with four extra bands just in case.
5.0,"10mm is a nice size for a mature look, I really like them because the earrings can dressed up or down an outfit."
5.0,"very nice bracelet, pretty design lovely color combination, beautiful scroll design."
5.0,"Didn't have any defects, wore well, and didn't feel cheap. What else could you ask for?"
5.0,I like the dress little big but it is fine love it
5.0,"Bought this for my niece to give to her Gigi. Their bond is so strong and heartwarming, so this was a perfect birthday present for her. Great quality!"
5.0,"These are almost not noticeable when wearing. Be careful when trying to scratch your nose too hard or messing with your nostrils, because this will come out a bit. Other than that, it does the job."
5.0,I love this little bracelet.  It's super cute and the magnetic clasp makes it SO easy to put on/take off.  I like that it comes in a gift box as well.  Quick shipping was a plus.  :)
5.0,Very attractive; lovely packaging—a great buy!
5.0,I have no dislikes about this product. They feel some awesome and keeps my foot warm. Plus its a headturner too.
5.0,"It's amazingly comfortable, the waist fits at the right spot and is super flattering. LOVE the pockets. Perfect for date night or parties. And so soft!"
5.0,Finally found a size that fits me. Very pleased with this item.
5.0,"Beautiful just like the photo, looks good on"
5.0,Quick shipping and great value.
5.0,"Very nice and durable shoes. We love Robeez shoes. Target and Walmart sells similar shoes carry other brand names. Those are filmsy and not durable. The materials are also not as fine as Robeez. It really worths the price, especially I bought this on-sale, almost the same price as what's in Target."
5.0,I use it with my turquoise jewelry all the time.  Weight wise...it's heavy but I've gotten used to it.  My eye sight has gotten bad as I aged so I have difficulty reading the time since the watch face is small.
5.0,Love love love this nose ring. I did have trouble  with getting it on at first but I took some pliers to it and brought out the hook alittle so now it fits perfect. Super sturdy and you don't have to worry about it coming out!
5.0,"I love these.  They look like they cost a lot more.  Also, sunglasses are often too wide on my face  (I am a grown man with a narrow head), and so buying shades online is risky, as I've learned by trial-and-error.<br />I bought a second pair and am thinking of getting a third.<br />The first package came with a discount code for the second, which did not work on Amazon, so I contacted Linvo customer service, who got back to me immediately with another discount code.  Very happy."
5.0,"Thanks for the expedited shipping! Received my watch quicker than expected. Very light weight and it looks amazing, awesome quality. I can't wait to use it as a conversation starter! a great gift idea for a loved one or even yourself."
5.0,"Cute and cozy.  Flattering not floppy.  Heavy fabric, better for cold days. Wash and dry well."
5.0,awesome!
5.0,Fits easily and has adjustable straps etc like a normal bra but feels like a lounge bra holds up the girls a bit ! I have a large heavy  but not (extra large)and I feel decent running around for errands not as much lift as a regular bra or sports bra but just right for Sunday’s COMFY :)
5.0,"Love this necklace! You can dress it up or down, goes with everything! I get lots of compliments when I wear it!"
5.0,Excellent product.  The material was nice and thick. Will buy again
5.0,Great look great fit. I will buy it again.

5.0,"beautiful color, fast shipping and i'm allergic to all metal but surgical steel and have had some problems with even hypoallerginic earrings, but these caused no irritation at all"
5.0,"Light fabric, awesome colors"
5.0,"Fits US sizes, nice standard striped shirt."
5.0,"super cute, great quality"
5.0,great colors!
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, perfect for the holiday season. I love the combination of beads and charms. Very feminine."
5.0,Liked the bra. Great for summer styles.
5.0,"Got these bralettes to wear after a lumpectomy surgery. They are so comfy! The soft lace is so nice and they look so much more feminine than a standard sports bra. Only con is that the padding doesn’t stay in during washing, but it can easily be replaced."
5.0,"This bush hat is amazing on so many levels. It performs as it was designed to. I bought this a few years ago. I wear it every spring, summer,  and fall. It actually keeps you cool in hot weather. It keeps sweat and the sun out of your eyes and off your head. At times, off of your shoulders as well. It also protects you from insects like gnats, you can even spray it with bug spray for added protection. You can spray it with CampDry to keep your head dry in the rain. I even wore it in a wind storm. The strap kept it on my head, it never flew off. This headgear is very light but tough. It fits perfectly, just be sure to know your hat size. This is perfect for hunting, hiking, fishing, bicycling, boating, cutting grass. It folds and packs easily in a cargo pocket or backpack. The Flecktarn camouflage is the best camouflage around."
5.0,"I am 5' 4&#34; 135 lbs and purchased a SM and its just right, beautiful fabric and excellent quality!! Love it!!"
5.0,Can you try to get rainbow calf socks and rainbow fuzzy socks with no treads on the bottom.
5.0,Great quality. I will buy again.
5.0,very helpful product
5.0,"This vest is just cool, I love wearing it."
5.0,"I love this dress and received many, many compliments on it. It fits nicely. I'm 5'5, 134lbs and ordered a medium. I love the long flowing length."
5.0,These glasses are understated while also sophisticated. I had my prescription lenses put in. I’ve received many compliments
5.0,Perfect. Item is as advertised and described.
5.0,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."
5.0,"Wow! Every now and then you get a t-shirt that's just PERFECT, and this one really is for me. It's super-super soft, but well constructed with moderately thick fabric (should last 1-3 years rather than 6 months before showing wear). The color is perfect (as pictured), the sleeves are on the short side (unlike men's sleeves, which come nearly to your elbows), and the length is long enough to cover your butt if you're wearing leggings. And did I mention that it's butter soft? This is already my new favorite shirt"
5.0,The size was small....so it was returned.  Great quality garmet!
5.0,Purchased for spouse
5.0,"These earrings are cute! If you’re on the fence, but them! You won’t regret it :-)"
5.0,Dress was as described but was a bit too large for my daughter.  It was returned but we did love it for a Homecoming dance.
5.0,Love these! There so comfortable!!
5.0,I paid $5 for this! Its way cuter than I expected. The material is actually pretty nice. I would suggest hanging to dry! I ordered 0/3 and my daughter wears 3/6 so it runs large
5.0,Needed shoulder pads under jacket.<br />This item worked great.
5.0,Cute shirt...good quality
5.0,Ive never liked shopping for panties or bras but i absolutely love these panties. They truly fit my body and the material is sooo comfortable.  Im buying another pair very soon. I want all colors!
5.0,Good watch!
5.0,"It came earlier then I expected...and I love it!! It's so cute, I highly recommend!"
5.0,These computer glasses are far better than I expected. They are exactly what I needed and wanted and seem to be of a better quality than the computer glasses I have been wearing that cost far more. They are very clear! I am very pleased with them.
5.0,Boys love them
5.0,"Absolutely love these jeans!!  My favorite store closed and I can't find anywhere that sells jeans I want, that fit for a decent price.  These are perfect!!  I typical wear either a size 3 or 5 depending on the brand.  I ordered a 3 in this jeans and a 5 in another design (la idol) and the 3 fits me perfect.  I returned the other pair with no problem and will be ordering those again in a 3.  The material is heavy duty so I don't expect these wear out soon.  They make my behind look amazing too!!  If you're looking for sexy quality jeans look no further!!"
5.0,Very pretty And good quality
5.0,"Good belt for if you are in between sizes. It's a wider belt. Works with jeans, but too wide for Dickies."
5.0,Adorable and comfortable! I love this dress!
5.0,I bought this for my son who is a distance runner and he has been using for a couple weeks now.  He said it works very well and no issues.  It arrived quickly and was exactly what we ordered and expected.  The fit was true to size.
5.0,Great quality material that is comfortable.<br />Adjustable Velcro on the back makes sizing easy.
5.0,great for a cleaning of the silver
5.0,Love them! So comfy and soft! One of my go to lounge sets during this beautiful fall weather.
5.0,Very comfortable and cute!
5.0,"Fits nicely, will be long enough to wear for a walk to the beach"
5.0,So cute and absolutely does not feel cheap or low quality. Love the charms
5.0,Super comfortable. Fits as expected. I love the pockets!
5.0,"Good quality printer shirt. The sizing was what I expected. The print is like all screen printing, it may break down and wash off after a lot of washings. But washing inside out will help delay that.<br /><br />It was a gift for my brother and he loves the hilarious graphic."
5.0,I wear them for Pilates . The last pack lasted a year. Just ordered again.
5.0,It fits true to size; not too long. i am short  5’1”. Color was nice and it has pockets which is a bonus
5.0,Love this black top.  I bought it in white also.  The ruching is great . It hides a tummy and that dreaded muffin top so is great with jeans.  I’m normally a medium and returned it and got a large.  Was too tight for me since I’m a 36DD and 127 lbs.  Was also snug through The body.  Nice fabric and didn’t shrink. The white is a bit see through so a bra is needed. I can wear the black without one.  It looks cute with joggers too. I would  recommend sizing up. I plan to get red for the Fall.  👍🏻
5.0,"These are beautiful, very sparkly!  I gave them to co-workers and everyone remarked how pretty they are!  I wished I'd ordered some more!"
5.0,I liked the product but to small
5.0,"I like to workout on fitted clothes and these fit perfect. Unfortunately, I made a hole attempting to try these on, either a defective pair or bad quality overall. I contacted the seller, who sent me a new pair to make up for the damaged one. I have had no issues with my current pair. These are my favorite workout pants. I rate this 5 stars because the seller's response was to ensure my satisfaction as a costumer."
5.0,"This necklace looks just as good in person as it does in the picture. Gave it as a graduation gift, looks good!"
5.0,"Love this top so much! It is so adorable! I usually wear medium but a lot of the reviews said to size up, so I did and they were right! This large is perfect! If you have big arms though, you might want to size 2 sizes up. It’s a little tight at the top."
5.0,This is small size and Magnet working fine even for swimming. Almost same with the magnet strap for garmin active but little shorter. Hope to make just 1cm longer.
5.0,Excellent Product!
5.0,Love! These shoes are beautiful. Yes the heel is 4 inches with no platform but they are really comfortable. They fit true to size. The laces are leather which makes them really sturdy. I have high arches and they fit comfortably and are in the right spot which is really important for comfortable wear.
5.0,"This band has a little softer/less stiff texture than the original Fitbit band, but fits the same as far as sizing. My original Fitbit Charge 2 band is a size small and I ordered a small. Fits perfectly."
5.0,"The fabric is soft, feels so smooth, but not slippery."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:640cdf63b3163a759a923d7ca1e7f35a]] The material is very nice not cheap thin fabric, fits just as I suspected"
5.0,"Bought this because I love baggy sack dresses. I just am very comfy in them. Also , I am pregnant now and these work superb. I ordered a small and I am 5'4 with double d chest and still has the perfect baggy fit."
5.0,Very Cute. A great buy and nice repackaging via Amazon Warehouse.
5.0,"Like the way it looks on, my grandson loves the look and feel!"
5.0,"This watch band has a great design and feel to it. I was able to replace my current watch bad without any issues and it very comfortable. However, you get what you pay for when you buy this item. I paid about $8 and it works exactly like i would expect an $8 product to work.<br />I expect to use this band for about 3 months before i get bored of the design and look for a new one. I expect to go back to this seller as i am pleased with the product. My only complaint is that the band does not &quot;stick&quot; to the watch face. There is a very small gap when stretched which the original watch band did not have.<br />The band itself is more stretchy than the original band. This may help or hurt, but i felt it necessary to include it."
5.0,The shoes arrived on time and the look looks great. I bought them for my daughter and she loves them
5.0,A must for young Peoples glasses
5.0,"Love everything about it, and so does my daughter. She dresses up with her brother and play “Spider-Man into the spider verse” =D"
5.0,My daughter uses this as a face mask when we go to the grocery store and everyone stops us to tell us they like it and asks where did we get it from.
5.0,This tutu fit like a glove on my 4 yr old cousin. Her mom was very pleased with this tutu we bought it as part of a wonder woman costume for my cousin who is playing wonder woman in a school play and this tutu looks amazing on her.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!  So well made down to finest detail
5.0,"Love these shirts but they are too big and tried to return them but never got a response which never happens. So I am stuck with them,  guess I'll were them over a bathing suit top or under a shirt."
5.0,Good deal and value.
5.0,I love it. It's great
5.0,"They are so warm! I use them on camping trips, bonfires and just sitting at home if I'm cold. I love them"
5.0,LOVE THIS SO MUCH!
5.0,I remember this! i used to have one when i was a kid and adored it! still a SM fan. this toy works great and very durable
5.0,"these are great toddler shoes for the price.  flexible sole, kid seems to like them"
5.0,It's a very pretty swim suit. Love the fit and color.
5.0,"I love them but I am going to have to put two socks on , on one foot.  One shoe is bigger than the other.  I have never had that happen before."
5.0,"Made out of nice, silky soft material. Quality exceeds my hopes!"
5.0,They are so comfy!  I’m glad I bought them- hoping to snag another pair!
5.0,I got this watch for my mom for Christmas and she loves it and wears it everyday. Maybe not everyday but she has it on everytime I see her.
5.0,This is a great swim suit for my water aerobics classes. It is comfortableand true to my size.
5.0,Great gift for Elvis lovers
5.0,This costume fit great. The outfit allowed comfort and a good look.
5.0,Great product. I prefer crep over Jason markk to keep my Jordan’s clean!
5.0,"A little smaller than I anticipated, but not a problem. I needed a simple clip and ring for my ID tag in the fire department and this baby did the trick. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a clip/ring combo."
5.0,Beautiful sink that replaced a glass vessel sink. This sink is quite heavy but matches my vanity perfectly. It went in very easily. I have have an oil rubbed bronze faucet and stopper for it and that matches nicely. Seems very durable and I hope will last a long time
5.0,Complete option more than its price
5.0,"Got these as a gift for a cuphead fan, very cool!"
5.0,"My six year old loves them, fits comfortably"
5.0,Works great for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 with an Otterbox defender case on it....perfect fit and I am able to use the phone thru the clear plastic. Great quality and so far no issues with the strap...seems very durable. I chose the one without the mirror so it had two closure spots.
5.0,Very nice quality and fits perfectly. Fun to fidget with and spin when you are bored!
5.0,This pearl earring set is a great value.  The set of 6 pairs of earrings in different sizes gives you several options to fit your mood or wardrobe for the day.  Another option is to split up the pairs to give to the younger ones in the family.  My fiancee is keeping the 3 larger sizes for herself and gifting the smaller 3 pairs to her niece.  The sizes are as pictured and the quality of the earrings are good.<br /><br />The backings are standard metal backings.  The earrings come packaged in a sturdy gift box so this set would be good to give as a gift as well.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased honest review.
5.0,These are great driving glasses. They are slightly oversized and curve around to completely block almost all sunlight from every angle which is really nice. They have UV coating to protect your eyes and are polarized to reduce glare and help prevent eye fatigue when driving. I found them really effective when I used them while driving around over the weekend.<br /><br />These sunglasses are lightweight with plastic frames but they seem very durable. The hinges are strong and can flex which helps provide a secure and comfortable fit. The glasses felt good on the bridge of my nose and I never and any problems with them sliding down or needing constant adjustments. These glasses come with a really nice protective case with a magnetic closing latch. There is also a cloth drawstring carrying pouch included that can be used in addition to the protective case. I received these sunglasses for free to test and provide my feedback and review.
5.0,"Really beautiful, but extremely heavy.  Not for sensitive ear lobes"
5.0,"They are very nice slippers, nice sole on them and the style is very nice also.  They fit perfect!"
5.0,"They fit as expected, are comfortable,  and work perfectly for yoga class.  I bought the blue ones and am thinking of buying a white pair."
5.0,I love this charm and it looks so pretty on my bracelet. This charm is as nice as any that I have had and is so brilliant and sparklingly.
5.0,"A great quality product for a reasonable price!  The rain pants are not only great for keeping his pants dry when rainy, but has also been great for his playtime in the sandbox!  I’ll be buying another pair when he outgrows this one!!"
5.0,"It fits good. I usually wear a medium or size 6. I ordered the medium and it fit perfectly. Due to the stretch, I probably could've gotten away with a small but very happy with them."
5.0,Very useful for outside our camper especially with little ones.
5.0,"I work in a very cold office and when I’m not using it as a blanket, it becomes a part of my outfit. I love it and it’s worth owning at least one."
5.0,Light weight and fits kinda tight that was not a problem for me it felt like it was more secure from the wind blowing it but I love this hat style and and the flamingo print.
5.0,"Most sunglasses, especially unisex ones, look ridiculous on me due to my smaller sized face. These actually look and feel great. The lenses are a bit dark but fine for using in full sun."
5.0,"I love these shorts, very comfortable and length is perfect. I am a size 10/12 and choose a large and it fit perfectly."
5.0,"I bought myself a one of these new batteries to replace my old one for my Ororo vest. I love the size and the fact that it doesn't have the sharp edges. My original battery wore the fabric out on the pocket made to hold it, therefore I had to sew it back back together. I will be buying another battery for my Ororo Jacket next."
5.0,This is good quality material nice fit true to size
5.0,"It looks EXACTLY as the picture! I’m really excited for when my 6 year old son opens it on Christmas. He’s IN LOVE with Among Us and enjoys wearing hoodies inside his cold classroom. It’s a little smaller than expected, so I would size up. It will still fit him so I’m not worried too much."
5.0,It was for my daughter and she loved it.
5.0,"I got this for my wife as gift for the upcoming Gilmore Girls release on Netflix. We had binge watched all the seasons earlier this year so she was super pumped that they were coming out with more episodes. What is better to wear than sweats while binge watching one of your favorite shows? I purchased a medium with the hope that it would be a little larger so she could wear it with leggings since the mannequin pic makes it look normal length. It ended up being just a smidgen shorter than she would have liked, but she is still able to wear it with leggings and very soft. The scoop neck hangs off one shoulder to give it that trendy &#34;jazzersize&#34; look if that's a thing. She basically wears it all weekend long unless we leave the house, just kidding she wears it everywhere and usually gets a compliment from at least one person. Full disclosure, I am also super pumped they have more episodes coming out. Team Jess!"
5.0,"Since the watch had to be charged every 24 hours and that requires taking it off, the band should be made of a material that won't break due to being flexed a lot. Wire mesh maybe but plastic bags keep breaking. This is a good quality replacement for the original band though."
5.0,This jacket is not thick so easy to wear i like it thank you
5.0,"My 9-year old daughter is IN LOVE WITH THESE!  Bow-ties are the ultimate in &#34;cool&#34; according to her, and these come in many cool and feminine colors."
5.0,I have older pets who need lots of care. These are just right for messy cleanups. No problem with tearing. They arrived in a small package. Packed well. I use a tissue box for dispensing the gloves. Satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,It's a warm easy to use knitted scarf.
5.0,"I really enjoy like men's jewelry (I have 3 necklaces and 4 rings), and this necklace is one of my favorite items. It's an excellent size, and the design is striking and powerful. For $15, this necklace is a steal.<br /><br />The cord that the necklace comes with isn't my favorite, so I removed the pendant and supplied my own cord. I give this 5 stars anyway, because the pendant is easily worth the price."
5.0,Works great I have big hands so it helps allot.
5.0,Great selper
5.0,"Easy to use, great looking ear wear. Affordable and come Individually marked packages so you dont lose your gauges"
5.0,"Great value for the money. Arrived way sooner than expected. I bought 2 pair for my girls, and they both love it!"
5.0,This is a beautiful simple and perfect headband.  It can be worn casually or with a formal wear. I absolutely love it!
5.0,They just came in today and I was so excited! They're so thick and soft on the inside. Finding decent mittens in stores (or mittens in general) is pretty tough and I was skeptical about buying them online but I'm so glad I did
5.0,"The first time I wore the wig, it was kind of puffy, but then again it was my first time wearing a wig. I got used to it and it ended up fitting perfectly. It does puff up a lot due to Isabel's crazy hair style, but that's what I really like about it. It does look a bit more brown in certain lights, but I also like that because her hair is a redish-brown and people exaggerate on the red. This wig is easily my favorite out of the three I have now!! I also found someone else wearing the same wig at the Arizona Matsuri Festival!!"
5.0,"I purchased this gift for my husband who takes off his wedding ring during sleep.  He was leaving his ring on the dresser but I always worried about the ring getting loss.  Since I do yoga, I thought this would be the perfect gift  . . . a yogi in a pose that could hold his ring safe at night.  I wasn't sure my husband would like it but he LOVES IT!  He likes the idea of having one place to keep his ring safe.  This is a great gift for anyone who enjoys yoga and it works perfectly for holding rings."
5.0,Good quality sick and nice detail for all those bronco fans. My husband loves them.
5.0,Beautiful small heart necklace. It was perfect for the teen girl we bought it for.
5.0,They look great on
5.0,"Watch arrived well packaged and in excellent condition.  It is much more attractive in person and feels quite substantial. The non-leather band does not do the watch justice, but I had a genuine leather pilot watch strap waiting for it. Seems to be a bargain for the price. We'll just have to see how well it holds up over time."
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Daughter loves them! Ordering more
5.0,"Bought it for my girlfriend, really tiny, just as described but look perfect on her! :)"
5.0,My grandson loves the design of this t-shirt. It is a lightweight fabric with great graphic design.
5.0,Absolute love 😍😍😍👌🏼
5.0,pretty silk
5.0,"This fit me perfectly, and the style is really cool. The fabric is thicker than I expected, with a surprising warm to it as well. I really like the double zipper style in the front, it's very unique and it can be worn a few different ways. Super cool top!"
5.0,"If you like a quality leather belt but choke on paying $150+ for it, this is a great choice.  This Spanish leather belt is in that $150 range quality/craftsmanship, for a lot less.  Order with confidence."
5.0,"Works as advertised. Just note that the fabric is perforated but is super comfortable for working out. Easy to clean. No complaints. Also,it's really nice to run in but because it is a little loose-fitting it can start to bob up and down a bit. I'd suggest maybe going a size down if you're going to be running."
5.0,I got this for traveling to Canada.  Women's wallets are so big so I decided to get a man's wallet.  Pretty in olive green.  I wanted this for holding bills and then a change purse for coin.  You can accumulate a lot of coin in Canada and didn't want to load up the wallet.  It's perfect with a small bag.  Like very much!
5.0,"I love this belt, I am between typical belt sizes, normally one hole is WAY too tight and the other is too loose and thus a waste of time to even have a belt.  I like that I set the length of the belt and forget it from there it fits perfect every time.  Its a really simple solution in that regard for one of my biggest issue with belts in general.  The buckle is a brilliant piece as well, I travel 40% of the time for work, and have to go through metal detectors at the airport, this belt having a carbon buckle doesn't set off the metal detectors going through the TSA precheck, its nice to not be messing around with my belt as I grab my bags and head toward the gate.  The buckle itself is brilliant really easy to latch and never comes undone."
5.0,Fits awesome
5.0,"This pin is beautiful, I gave it as a gift but I really wanted to keep it for myself."
5.0,I had to repair the seams in order to wear it the very first time but I was very happy with the look on. I only wish it was as long on me as on the model
5.0,I have a glare problem in daylight  These stylish wrap style glaqsses keep the glare from distradting me when I'm outside in the Texas sunshine.
5.0,I have a stitch obsession so of course I loved my mask
5.0,"It actually fits pretty good and it's the best corset i've had so far. Although the thong did break when i washed it but i could've done that while getting the clothes out. But the thong isn't that important. Other than that, it's pretty great"
5.0,My niece loved 'em. Good quality.
5.0,"I ordered this hoping to try a new bra out that wasn't name brand and I wasn't let down. It's a very comfortable bra and really is seamless. I wear it with a lot of different tops and you cannot see the outline in any of the blouses, tops, or dresses I wear with it. Offers great support and many size options."
5.0,I really like this wallet.  This little wallet holds a lot of stuff.  Best part is the little pocket on the outside where I can keep the card I use the most.
5.0,I make earrings didn't realize that the set only had one of each color... that was my oppsie but maybe something more in the description could indicate that otherwise they are very pretty lol
5.0,"I have POTS and read that compressing belly area helps return blood to brain and heart, so I ordered these. I guess the actual compression numbers are less than the stockings, but still I find these leggings very helpful in dealing with my dizziness. recommended. Also looks cool."
5.0,they have a decent weight to them so they feel nice without being too much.
5.0,"Very comfortable fabric, roomy."
5.0,verygood .... I like
5.0,my daughter loves these! warm and light
5.0,Nice for the $$ !!

5.0,AT FIRST THEY ARE WONDERFUL.BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THEM CONTINUOSLY OR THE ROSE COLOR WILL TURN TO SILV ER
5.0,Came on time and my daughter loved it. She wore it to the Chic fila dress like a cow day. She looked adorable!
5.0,"Excelente reloj , liviano , elegante y casual"
5.0,I love the big face on this watch. My eyes aren't what they used to be so this is very easy to read. I love the black numbers also. I would recommend this for anyone whose eyesight is not good.
5.0,"Soft fabric, breathable, great for hot weather."
5.0,Super cute and super comfortable! I love this dress!!
5.0,"Very easy to put on, but secure and very comfy once it’s there. Absolutely love this ear cuff!"
5.0,Exactly what I need
5.0,"These sunglasses are so comfortable! I live in the middle of the desert so I really put my sunglasses thru the test to see if they will stand up to the unrelenting sunshine. I can happily say they do! They protect my eyes from the harsh, unforgiving sun yet are stylish and ultra cool. I have worn them for a few days now, all day, every day and I have absolutely no complaints of any discomfort from wearing them. Sometimes sunglasses will make the backs of my ears ache, but I am happy to say these do not do that for me. The green print around the frame is cute! It sets my sunglasses apart from everyone else plain jane all black frames, which is perfectly ok with me because I like to stand out in a crowd (in a good way). The nose pads are typical nose pads, they did not give me any trouble or discomfort either. Overall I am very happy with my new cool sunglasses as they have quickly made their way to being my favorite pair. I received these sunglasses at a slight discount in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, I am very happy with the style, sturdiness of the frames and the protection they provide my eyes from the sun. I would highly recommend these to anyone that wants cool sunglasses at a fraction of the cost of overpriced brand name ones."
5.0,They are comfy and look the best with sandals in my opinion.
5.0,Excellent product!!!!!
5.0,Absolutely love these shirts on my son but I do not leave them folded on the bottom.

5.0,Loved the sweater!! It came just the way I expected it to!!
5.0,Looks exactly as pictured. Purchased this as a gift for my younger sister she loved it!!
5.0,I got for my son for baseball and he loves it. He likes that they are adjustable and the color.
5.0,"Purchased this for a bachelor weekend! 175lb, 5ft 5in and was 15weeks preggo! It was a comfortable and flattering dress!"
5.0,"My fault, I ordered xl instead large. They are lovely. I will use as a gift."
5.0,It really helpful. I highly recommend it for others shopper
5.0,"I love everything about this dress!<br />It is very well made. Lightweight, flows very nicely. Love the navy blue color and all the other available colors actually look great so it was hard to choose.<br />I’m 5’7, 172lb, 36B, got a Large and I really like the way it fits!<br />I think it’s an excellent dress- dress it up with a pair of cute heels and a statement necklace and you have a perfect dress for a wedding or graduation, or dress it down with some flat sandals and it’s a great effortless look for the beach- so many options! Absolutely love it!<br />P.S. did I mention it has pockets?"
5.0,This dress is better than I expected it fits great fabric is perfect great buy
5.0,"It was really soft, moveable, and made with a comfortable material. I like it!"
5.0,Very nice cross for the money.
5.0,Beautiful and compact
5.0,Very beautiful! And not cheap looking!
5.0,"I bought this dress for an Easter dress that you could breastfeed in.  It definitely works for that purpose, but also works for a pretty dress.  The material was flattering and it fit just as expected."
5.0,Kids put them right on
5.0,The part was delivered on time and was a perfect fit.
5.0,They are gorgeous very well made same prints from picture love it.
5.0,"Perfect fit and so comfortable, I bought a second one."
5.0,these are the ones im looking for. i love these. cheep and has some glare to them cause they are nice and flat true loc style. but its worth it. looks great on my shape head. do not get the polarized ones. they are nothing the same.
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Super cute!
5.0,looks great and was nice to change out for the ones with clips.  quality good!!
5.0,"Ordered these for a dance recital - they were perfect. The snap ensures a nice, snug fit (necessary so they don't fly off while dancing!)  Highly recommended."
5.0,Bought a couple of these dresses to take on a trip. I was very pleased.  They don't wrinkle much or take up much space in the suitcase.  Love the pockets too!
5.0,I love how easily these earrings go on and how lightweight they are. The crystal ball on the earring is an eye catcher. Love them!
5.0,I have a skin condition & only wear 100% cotton.  This pajamas are so soft.  The drawstring bottoms allow me to tighten or loosen as my weight fluctuates.  I will be ordering another pair or 3.
5.0,I like that the straps are adjustable and relieve pressure from my ears. So far my glasses have not fogged up when using these masks. It fits my face just enough. I would not recommend these for people with large/wide faces.
5.0,"Gave these to my daughter as a gift, and she loves them. They're very soft, but sturdy, and I'm sure durable. She loves the fit and the color, so I done good!"
5.0,I bought this as a father's day present for my husband as we had our fist child a few months ago.  Since our baby is not yet big enough for this size (purposely bought large to wear down the road) we have not yet tried the product on.  However my husband was thrilled when he received the present and is very excited about getting to wear it soon!
5.0,"It is beautiful, delicate and light. Comes with a metal choker that is also delicate. It is very well designed. I love."
5.0,"Very good quality socks. Mine looks just like their web page pictures and well made.<br />Inside thread loose-ends are short, so toe jams are minimized.<br />I would call it a medium thickness, not ""thick"" as listed. Actually it feels thin in some areas, especially where they are meant that way for ventilation which really helps in preventing feet from getting sweaty. Areas that need cushioning, such as fore foot and heel, are padded.<br /><br />This socks seem to be offered in only 2 sizes, L and XL. This was size L and supposed to be for U.S. men 4-8 size. I wear size 7 and it fits fine. It stretches quite a lot and I think it would be too loose for people wearing size 4.<br /><br />Price is good. I like it."
5.0,I had been looking for wooden beads for the longest to replace some that broke a long time ago. These are quality made and met my expectations!
5.0,"Very high quality, looks good with any outfit"
5.0,I think I want another one!  Can't tell I'm wearing it...very comfortable and forgiving.
5.0,I love these. They're so light weight and constant attention grabber. I wanna grab another pair if them!
5.0,Sexy af! It's honestly very stylish and sophisticated.
5.0,"I love everything about this hat. It looks great! It's very comfortable, very warm and was VERY INEXPENSIVE. Who cares it's not &#34;official&#34; and over priced? It's perfect."
5.0,The shoes were even comfortable enough to manage recess!
5.0,Awesome very impressed with the durability. Very well put together product.
5.0,"The color of the leather is nice, and looks great with the black watch."
5.0,"First off, this blew my expectations. For the price and design I was thinking it'd a waste of $20 but the beanie was incredible. For a smaller person such as I, the size I've seen a lot complain about was no problem. The sound quality was great, the material was nice and comfortable, and if you make sure to turn off the beanie when not in use the battery lasts quite a while. Only complaint is that the headphones make the sides slightly bulky, but only by a hair. All in all love it, would buy again, and HIGHLY recommend it to all reading this."
5.0,I love these socks. They are thin enough that they don’t take up room in my shoes. They are thin but not to thin.
5.0,"Love this bag! Perfect purse for moms. Holds everything and super comfortable to carry. Not too big, not too small. Just wish there was a cross body strap for other carry options."
5.0,"Very cute shirt. Fits great. I usually wear a M, and that's what I ordered and it is good."
5.0,"Unfortunately all the reviews made it seem like it run small, and it did a little for what I wanted it for. But honestly it fit me perfectly (5'6, 130lbs) although I wanted it to be a little baggy. It is thick and cozy and amazingly made though, I love it still!"
5.0,I’m obsessed! I brought one. But now I need 3 more
5.0,Bought this for an average size 9 year old boy. He absolutely loves it.
5.0,"I love this suit, Its flattering and the pattern is interesting.  I ordered same size as their sizing chart and fits great."
5.0,"Fit appears large on arrival, but shrinks on first wash to the expected size. Very comfy."
5.0,"Standard snapback/trucker hat. Love the colors, love the fit, love my Indian."
5.0,"Fits great, lots of compliments too!<br />Love it!"
5.0,"The first thing that I could think of this shirt is it's VERY FLATTERING! I am a mom and with how my body changed after giving birth, I struggle with buying clothes online that fits well and is flattering for my body shape. I gave this shirt a try and I am so glad I did! The fabric is thick and soft, and it fits me really well. The buttons and v-neck cut added a nice design to the shirt. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a trendy, quality shirt!"
5.0,I like this necklace. It is precious and elegant. I got this for my daughter. It is just right for her. The total length is 17 inches with additional ring at about 1 inch to the end. So it can be shorten to 16 inches to wear it higher. It is made of sterling silver with 14k rose gold plated that is one of the key reasons that I go for this one. It is safe for her sensitive skin and it is also right size for her. The necklace comes with a pretty jewelry box that makes it a good gift wrapping and also good for putting away when not wearing it.
5.0,does what a headband is meant to do.
5.0,"I bought these for my 7-yr old (size 2), and they are true to size and of course beautiful!  I only wish they were sold in half sizes as well."
5.0,I love these socks. I had a hard time finding socks that would fit my legs and  now I have  the perfect fit. Good stretch  Good price and Good quality  and when you wash them they do not shrink.  I recommend that if you are a person with very swollen legs you buy these socks. I know that you will love them too.
5.0,"This dress fit perfectly, exactly true to size. It was very long fro my 5'3&#34; frame. The bust is firm, not soft and pliable so it keeps you in place."
5.0,This dress is beautiful! Will be wearing it to an evening wedding.
5.0,Fit my petite 5 yo daughter perfectly and they stay in place and don’t slide off her foot
5.0,Love the convenience of not having to carry my things in a shoulder bag.
5.0,Fit was perfect. Love the saying.
5.0,This earrings look really good and feel great!! Lots of looks! I bought them for my girl friend an ended up wearing them myself lol.. I like them very much!
5.0,These glasses withstand nearly anything. My rambunctious 4 year old has not even put a scratch on them.
5.0,This is the second time I purchased this product to sleep in it is too long to where outside the house. I love wearing them around my house. Can't go anywhere so be comfortable at home.
5.0,Not just a thing to give...but a memorable experience in giving!  These are great and were the hit of the party!  So much fun!
5.0,"This thing stays put!  I worried that it would fall off when I moved around (I'm a restless sleeper), but it didn't budge.  It's lightweight and comfortable, with elastic that's strong enough to hold it in place but gentle enough that I literally forgot I was wearing it.  Keeps my hair from getting tangled as I sleep, and keeps it out of my face.  Wonderful product."
5.0,Loved it !
5.0,I love hoop earrings. . Most of the time I wear bold  ones .. Recently I started my hunt for thinner simple Hoops ( still large as in 1 1/2 ) but thinner and shiny .. These are perfect ..Just what I was looking for ..Well made .. You won't be disappointed. . TRY THEM U WILL LOVE THEM
5.0,"Great socks-gift for my boyfriend who is a mail carrier and kept his feet warm all winter. Difficult to find nice, quality socks for big & tall (size 10-13), but these definitely make the mark! Would purchase again"
5.0,"The very first thing I noticed about this dress was the quality and weight. Seriously, the moment I took it from the packaging I was floored with the intricate beading work. Thousands of beads perfectly stitched and I could not find a single flaw. (That's very rare for beaded items, and practically impossible to find such good workmanship at this price point!)<br />I was a little worried about the fit, as I have wide hips, but I followed the inches chart in the listing and it fit perfectly. (I highly recommend any woman get their correct measurements and always order using those and not the standard Amazon size chart.)<br />The design of the beads is also very flattering, which I feel had an impact on the overall look of the dress, as the cut of it would usually not look good on me.<br /><br />I was lucky and able to wear it to a 'The Great Gatsby' themed NYE party, and I got so many compliments because this dress was so perfect for the era.<br /><br />Above anything else, I have been genuinely impressed with the quality of this dress, and plan to order from this seller again if I ever need another upscale dress!"
5.0,I chose this outfit to wear to an all white xmas party. I loved it more once I put it on. It's made of good quality with stretchy material. I want another one in a different color.
5.0,"I like it a lot. These are very useful to packaging and I use it to separate clean and dirty clothes, I recommend it"
5.0,It is good quality and fit to myself
5.0,"This is my second Tough Headband, and it fits just like the first one. I have a smallish head, so I could see it being a little tight on someone with a big head, but for me it is perfect. Very comfortable and lightweight and stays in place. I mainly use it to hold my hair out of my face when I work out, and it services this purpose nicely. It does a fair job of keeping the sweat from dripping down the sides of my face, but I didn't intend it to be a sweat band. Love the flower/skull design."
5.0,This belt is not as intense a color as it appeared on my computer screen.  It is a lighter yellow color.  It fits well and I think I will enjoy using it with my work skirts and dresses.
5.0,"I'm 5 foot 2 inches. 115 lbs. This fit perfectly skin tight. If I were an inch or two taller, I'd go for a medium.  Pretty good quality, too!"
5.0,Always get one size bigger. My daughter wears a size 5 and got her a size 6 and they fit perfectly. Cute shoes for everyday use.
5.0,Great little stocking stuffer
5.0,These are great!  I love the fit and all the colors.  If I work outside I have to wear a sweat band and I like the width and comfort of these.
5.0,i would highly recommend these socks to anyone suffering from feet pain for me the pain was gone almos as soon as i put them on
5.0,"The raven pendant is just as described, and will be perfect for any Bellatrix cosplay. The necklace itself is some kind of plastic material--it's a durable weave and more flexible than you would think. The necklace clasps are adjustable for a varied height. So far I've worn it to two Halloween parties and a Renaissance Faire, and received a lot of compliments!"
5.0,perfect gift for my mom!
5.0,Love this watchband
5.0,This is a great cape! The material is soft and pretty good quality for the price. It was a good length for my 8 year old son who is about 45 inches tall and smaller for his age.
5.0,"I love this jacket for fall and spring. I have a big puffy coat for winter and needed something that would keep me warm in between the freezing temps that is also lightweight. I think this is a great jacket, it's comfy and cool looking with the added length and I'm happy with the quality. I am 5'2, 100 pounds and this fits me very well."
5.0,It’s adorable and I love it
5.0,Beautiful dress! Not too revealing with the right amount of sex appeal. I received a lot of compliments.
5.0,My mom loves them
5.0,Really like this band much nicer than I expected....would recommend purchasing if you like bling.

5.0,The masks are soft and adjustable. Very good product!
5.0,"Wore this for my daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner.  Loved it, got compliments and it was very comfy.  Would buy again!"
5.0,"I have purchased Bearpaw boots for my niece for the past three years. Excellent product. Great rubber soles, warm fleecy lining, suede outer held up very well with a little suede spray. Can be passed on because they held up so nicely. Purchased 2 pair for next winter"
5.0,These went perfect with a dress I was trying to match!
5.0,The watch is very pretty and it works well. It arrived timely and in excellent condition.
5.0,Attractive and very well made. Larger animals have two pins on the back for stability.  Great for decoration on handbags and backpacks.
5.0,Baby is 9mo (50th percentile) wearing 12-18mo. Very happy with this outfit! Great value 😊 Baby was very comfortable in it.
5.0,Great sweatshirt!  It was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. Size was perfect fit and looks great on him. Shipping was fast and easy. The sweatshirt arrived on time and in perfect condition. Definitely recommend this brand.
5.0,"This glass diamond looks great!  Excellent product for the price.  Mine doesn't have any impurities and has a nice weight to it.  In normal room lighting, it's slightly darker than the picture, but that doesn't bother me.  Note that the item comes bubble wrapped in paperboard box; you'll need a different box or bag if giving this item as a gift."
5.0,My son loves these sunglasses. His younger siblings have &#34;borrowed&#34; them without permission several times and they are still in one piece. Very well made item.
5.0,This is a great reusable hair net.<br />I bake at home and needed something I wouldn't just toss in trash after.<br />These are perfect.
5.0,Got them for my husband for snowmobiling.  He loved them for the bright snow days…filter the light nicely.
5.0,LOVE LIVE LOVE. I get so many compliments every time I wear it! It does not wrinkle and is so comfy

5.0,she loved the earrings

5.0,"I purchase this limited edition watch when it first available, 2 or 3 years ago. That was the first run. I paid around 5 hundred dollars , I purchased this watch China. All papers and stamped purchased warranty card. Not grey goods. I have never worn the watch , I'm a watch COLLECTER, And now I can easily sell it for 7 hundred dollars. Looks great , aligned bezel. If you like it, Buy it.  Sonny , Collector."

5.0,"Great plugs, good variety of colors"
5.0,"Honestly this was the first EVER piece of clothing I've bought from Amazon and I'm an Amazon regular since 2014. This outfit came quickly and it was CUTE AF. I wore this outfit for a New Years party and I looked bomb. It hugged in the right places. The material is breathable and the top is ADJUSTABLES. You can make the straps how you want and you can move the cups depending on how your breasts sit. It was a cute outfit. Once I find my pics, I'll upload them here"
5.0,Well-made piece.  Recommended purchase.  Gave these as a gift and they are worn time and again with no faults noted.
5.0,Great no show to wear with flats.  No stinky feet.  They have the silicone pad in the back to keep them on your feet.  I like these a lot.
5.0,I play guitar and live in a warm climate. These help me prevent getting skin oils on my guitars and I have the option of using the thumb hole where I can hold a pic.
5.0,A bit big for my 8 year old but he loves this watch!
5.0,"I was concerned that this hat would be too small because the description says it will fit up to 7 1/2. My hat size is 7 5/8. I was pleasantly surprised when the hat came because with the pegs in the last three holes of the adjustable band it fits perfectly! Very comfortable, too!"
5.0,love the watch
5.0,"I was looking for something tovisually tell two sets of keys apart.  This has fit the bill.  I like the quick opening to separate car from home and other keys.  So far so good, hope the last."
5.0,This dress is so beauty and good quality. Love it
5.0,Beautiful but I had to send back.
5.0,"Im suprised that Im the first person to review this bracelet. Im a man and i dont like the feminine look of most mens bracelets. The black and steel look of this bracelet along with the width is very cool. Chisel is the maker and they have made a great product. When i purchased it i just liked it and wasn't fishing for compliments....but DAYUM....i get a lot of comments from friends, family, sales clerks in stores...etc. Its well made, the clasp holds securely, its easy to clean and those basic things make all the difference."
5.0,"Will certainly buy again, very nice and good product for the price."
5.0,So far so good. Our toddler likes these shoes. They are a solid option for tennis shoes on a budget. Seem to be built well. I’ll update my review if they turn out to be less durable than they seem.
5.0,"My husband approved dress lol ... A Very feminine, classy and sexy dress. The material is very soft and the design of the dress is very attractive to a curvy body. I’m 5”1 147 pounds- 36D-31-44  I ordered a large . I wear a 8-10 in most dresses and pants size 8. I do not have a tummy.  Great dress I recommend it."

5.0,I love wearing this out on chilly days. It's cute and goes with most of my wardrobe.
5.0,This belt is well made I've owned it for over a year and I love it I would recommend it the canvas is thick and well made and the holes are in the right spots
5.0,"I like this hat so much that I've bought a second one when I couldn't find the first. It's a great size to keep sun off your face without getting in the way or getting blown off too easily. Other reviewers mention that the hat does have a bit of gold sparkle, but I consider that a PLUS! I get compliments from other women every time I wear it."
5.0,I have no dislikes (maybe that it is only 8 oz). Used the product on some very tight shoes and chelsea boots and WALLAA! No more pain from the critical points that needed stretching!
5.0,Absolutely love the quality of material
5.0,I’m 5’7 and 140 pounds. I range from a small and medium. I bought a medium and it worked out fine for a nice loose fit look. I think a small would have given a tighter look I like the medium though. It looks like the beautiful just like it’s displayed.
5.0,Perfect fit and color!
5.0,Super comfy and soft. Would wear it all the time if I could.
5.0,"Cute packaging, great quality!"
5.0,Very easy to use.

5.0,So great! One of the best bags!
5.0,Okay this is my second dress like this and it’s nice quality for the price. It fit well too.<br /><br />I wear a size 8-10 jeans and due to my chest being a 38DD I wear a 16 top... so finding something that fits nice is hard.<br /><br />I am 5’3 160lbs and the 3XL fit perfect. (XXXL) my first dress was a 4XL and it wasn’t too big but I knew I could go down a size.<br /><br />Now I have only dry cleaned my first dress and it did not shrink.... so I don’t know about shrinking if you wash it at home.<br /><br />But IF you try washing it at home COLD water gentle cycle and I would hang dry or a cool dryer. Then warm iron with starch to press neatly.<br /><br />I did put a petite coat underneath and it made all the difference I feel any type of “bell shape” dress like this looks so much better with a knee length petite coat.... spend the extra 12  to 15 bucks and get a petite coat.<br /><br />You will love it!
5.0,Was for my sister for a play she was in.  The wig looked good.  Soft curls and straight where expected.
5.0,Super cute. A little boxier than I thought would be but it’s super super cute. Good quality.

5.0,"Great little dress, good quality and super great price"
5.0,Excellent quality for the price.  Beautiful color and it fits well.  Prompt Delivery!
5.0,These are very nice. Go on very nicely and look vivid and clean lined. They only lasted about a day and a half though before starting to flake off. There's a lot ofthem though so just put one on every day if you want :)
5.0,Look just like real ugg boots! Warm and comfortable and stylish
5.0,Love the earrings. Very elegant. Received complements. The only con is the clasp. Not very secure but I can live with it considering the price point.
5.0,"This is my third &#34;Spartina&#34; bag and this one is as great as the others! Outstanding quality, roomy and easy to get into and out of and quite distinctive in style and look.<br />I am a loyal fan!"
5.0,"I love these pillows. They are well made and sooo soft!  I have ordered 8 so far for myself, my children and for gifts.  These are the best!"
5.0,"The description on Amazon alleges that this scarf is super soft, and this scarf is really soft.  This scarf is also attractive and versatile.  This acrylic scarf can be wrapped in a traditional loop, or can be tucked under in an infinity style loop.  The scarf can also be draped as an accessory to a jacket, coat, or sweater.<br /><br />Washing is a pain because hand washing and lay flat drying is the recommended care.  Unfortunately, the care required for this scarf is more than the significant other would prefer.<br /><br />We considered this soft, versatile scarf to be affordable and attractive.  Accordingly, our assessment of value is average to above average.<br /><br />Our overall rating is five stars.  While it would be easy to take a star away because of the hand wash and lay flat drying, the significant other likes this scarf too much to let washing affect our rating of the scarf.  Accordingly, she is quite enthusiastic about this scarf and would certainly recommend it to others.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
5.0,Ordered this dress for a Gatsby themed holiday party.  I read the reviews for the dress and ordered a size larger than usual.  I'm 5'5 and typically wear a size 6-8. I went with a large instead of medium. It was perfect considering it's supposed to be a bit baggy.  I wore it backwards for the scoop neck. It was perfect for the party with some fish next hose and accessories. It's very well mad and just enough sparkle. Can't wait to wear it again for NYE!
5.0,Crazy cool and cheap.  Looks and works like a much more expensive watch.
5.0,"I have several of these bracelets and I just can't get enough of them I just like them just because they hold good energy so if you're looking for something to give you daily up lift daily. This is it, you are reminded when you look down on your wrist having holy saints, Jesus, and Mary. I am not Catholic or super religious but I am spiritual so that is the reason why I like to wear the bracelet."
5.0,these glasses are great. I did brake them though and hopefully can find them again. definitely a good style. thanks for having them.
5.0,Keeps my sons hands warm good quality
5.0,"While still a very very beautiful watch, the picture makes it look a lot more orange than it is. It's more of a golden bronze shade.<br />I bought it primarily because I wanted an orange self winding skeleton watch so I was a bit disappointed when the image did not match the product."
5.0,Love this dress! It fits perfectly!
5.0,"They fit a little bigger than I expected, but I still like them and would would recommend…"
5.0,"Oh my gosh, I am OBSESSED with this dress. The quality is absolutely incomparable and it’s so lightweight and comfortable. I love the color, and this dress you can wear casually or dress it up. It’s mini but doesn’t come up too far and fits perfectly! Absolutely love and would 10/10 recommend to ANYONE!"
5.0,"Bought one for myself, and was so delighted with the look & quality I ordered another right away to give as a gift. Nice quality. Stainless steel so it will not tarnish nor rust, yet appears to look like sterling-silver but at a fraction of the price. a little smaller then we imagined from the photo but still nice. The chain is a bit too long and can be easily swapped out. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I LOVE THESE PANTS!! When you are required to wear business casual clothing 5 days a week, you need a good pair of dress pants. I bought two of these and I love how they fit and appear on my body size. So many pants these days look more like leggings rather than dress pants so finding these really was a life saver. I definitely will be buying more soon!"
5.0,Love it!!! Soft and perfect size .
5.0,Love it! Came a day early too. Has a lot of shine too it as well.
5.0,"These are great material, I love them. I have them in several lengths and colors."

5.0,"This is my favorite watch, I wore it every day for like 3 years until it finally broke and then ordered a new one. 11/10 a good watch"
5.0,Saw President elect Trump wearing this hat after he was elected and just had to get one for my husband.  Really nicely made!
5.0,"My five year old loves this back pack, and it is really the cutest. Super durable and easy to get in/out of, the side pockets are deep and hold her water bottle well. An inside slip pocket fits her daily folder and spiral perfectly. Highly recommend! The charm didn’t last long before falling off, but that didn’t bother her."
5.0,I gifted this to my husband for his birthday and he loves it!
5.0,Bought these for work and wasn’t disappointed. They fit great and are so comfortable. I was worried that it would show too much ankle but thankfully I’m 5’2 and a small fit me just right. Perfect pants for my restaurant job

5.0,Very comfortable and very well made. Fits well.
5.0,Fit as expected.  They are really nice and comfortable for working out.
5.0,This is one of my better purchases on Amazon. This is an adult sized beanie. It is comfortable and is easily recognizable as Thor's helmet. I am mad at myself for not ordering 2 or 3. I want one to give as a gift but that ship has sailed and there are no more available.
5.0,"High quality masks. Includes metal, flexible nose-piece, pocket for filter which, in my opinion, is not needed as the mask is thick enough for protection, but no so thick that it is not breathable. Would purchase again."
5.0,"Trying to find a suit for my growing daughter (12) that doesn’t make her look older than she is while honoring her wishes for a two piece (easier to go to restroom) ... this is it.  It’s tasteful, good coverage, and looks great on her.  The blue is very pretty.  Suit is lined and seems to be well made.  She loves it so it’s a win/win."
5.0,They are fun and witty!  Cute for the evian water lover in your life!
5.0,Our grandchild loves them!
5.0,Such a cute shirt- bought this for my chemistry-loving nephew and it's his new favorite.

5.0,Soft and well worth the  $$$
5.0,These clips that attach to a purse or carry on bag will allow you to carry a hat on the plane without smooshing it.  I hope my hat will make it without damage.  Planning to do a great deal of  walking in summer weather and want to avoid a sunburn.
5.0,I received so many compliments on this dress!! So comfortable and easy to wear. No tugging or pulling required. I am very happy ❤️

5.0,I liked the multiple ways to custom adjust for proper fit.  My concern for the fuzzy inner material might be too warm is gone...  We are having 100 deg days in Texas and I am happy in every way with these shoes (including the temperature)  (not too hot for me...  just great comfort)
5.0,"Well made, comfortable and utilitarian. The 3-pick holder is a great feature."

5.0,Love this watch !! Great deal
5.0,"Great little bag for what i wanted it for, so good that I went back and bought a second one so that I have a backup when the first one wears out."
5.0,ok so I love these!!!! 🤭<br />Tgey fit true to size. So if your a 16 or 18 you need the 3x. Tgey are comfortable and they don't have to bad of a chemical smell. And the do exactly what they say they do. SWEAT YOU!!! And the fact that they have pockets are the best
5.0,This shirt looks nice .like the details
5.0,"So so cute, it’s almost silly! Yarn is soft and vibrant in color. It’s a nice crimson red. Looks just like the pictures. Using for baby pictures tomorrow!"
5.0,I love this toe ring. its perfect for my foot!!
5.0,"I believe if I had measured propery I would not have ordered this item. It is snug, and I discarded the mailing package so will not attempt to return it.  It is most likely very supportive.."
5.0,"Love the design of the shirt with the neck; can wear informal or business casual with the right slacks etc.  I wish pattyboutik made more of its tops a bit longer to cover the burr completely, but given the range of offerings this is a great top.  Soft too!"
5.0,"Best belt I have ever purchased, but I guess I need the longer belt to have more adjustment!<br />I'm a 40 inch waist and I thought the 43&#34; belt would give me the tolerance i needed but its slightly too tight!<br />I have contacted vendor by email and asked for the longer belt, the buckle looks and works great!"
5.0,I love these pants. i love the pocket. I love that they fit my very short torso well.
5.0,"Giirrrllll!!! (Or whatever you chose to identify as) if you are looking for a cute off the shoulder dress this is it! Comfortable, sexy, short for me...but I’m 5’7” kinda on the tall side.  I followed the instructions for the measurements and it came out perfect size.  The material is quality. Plan on wearing it all summer!"
5.0,These oversized sunglasses are the best. They not only look great but they really protect against the sun. Great blend of fashion and function. I am very pleased with these and highly recommend.
5.0,Not brazed (no seam) so no weak spot.  Exactly the size of Navy signal flag hoist rings.
5.0,I really liked them. Easy to carry. As a pen
5.0,Keeps everything organized!
5.0,This is a beautiful chain and I love it.  It is a pretty chain that looks expensive and is also sturdy.
5.0,"I was worried at first but when I saw this dress and felt the material I was totally impressed. Its everything its just as discribed, vibrant color blue and crisp white threading detail at the neck and around sleeve. Love this<br />unique dress."
5.0,"Great fabric, we'll made & durable. I work outdoors in Alaska & they are perfect for cool mornings and evenings. Wash well and withstand a lot of wear and tear. I also wear them traveling as they are lightweight and very comfortable, with great pockets"
5.0,"I bought this to give to my sister for her birthday. I liked it so much I kept it for myself. However, whilst I was out with her and wearing it, she commented on how cute it was, so I had to give it to her, anyway. Really liked it."

5.0,Works well every time!
5.0,Great quality and fit fast delivery
5.0,"I had a few people tell me how nice these looked, and I was bummed when baby girl lost one, but a neighbor found it and returned it to me because he &#34;knows those shoes are expensive.&#34; ;) They fit great and are so cute!"
5.0,My four year old wears this everywhere! It is warms density!
5.0,She loves it!!!!!
5.0,This top is awesome!  I bought it to fit a little larger.  It is true to size.  It looks so nice on and is a little sexy too.
5.0,I've seen poor reviews on the band but it's strong nylon guitar strings style. Stretches and goes right back and I can't seem to break it if I tried.  That's a lie. Just be gentle but its pretty great. And it looks great. Get it and enjoy
5.0,Love these. Wear under skirts in the summer. Nor sticky slip.
5.0,"Super cute, nice detail for the price! It does fit somewhat small/tight because the laces in the back have a lot of give. The size fit me perfectly as far as fit and length went, but there was a gap in the back where the laces are as they had to be let out so that it would fit around me. Boyfriend loves it, it's very flattering, and stood up to my pulling on it quite well!"
5.0,"Per the other reviews, I bought up a couple of sizes and the shoes fit fine with a medium weight wool sock.  The keep my feet warm and dry (even when the temp is below zero (F).  They're comfortable, and need basically no break in.  I have wide feet, and tried on several other makes of winter biking shoes,  Most were too narrow, but these are great.  I'm very satisfied with the shoes (and generally)."
5.0,Large ended up being a small medium.
5.0,"Nicely made, not heavy! Perfect for football game I went too!"

5.0,"It's very cute but it was a little short on me and I'm pretty short myself, I am only 4. 11” and it was short on me."
5.0,"These earrings are about 1&#34; in length. They are beautifully finished in rose gold. The color is warm and rich. The multi colored stones are beautifully cut and give a really nice sparkle. The stones are pastel colors of pink, green, blue...and clear. The back of this earrings have a filigree cut out in the metal. They can be worn with the back facing forward for a all metal look.  They arrive in a cute little blue ribboned gift box with a velvet interior.<br /><br />These close securely.  If ever having difficulty closing  earrings with this type of closure, simply push the bar up slightly and gently and they will close.<br /><br />This company sells really good quality, well made jewelry. I ordered 3 pairs of their earrings. They are all excellent quality, with beautifully cut stones and the electroplating is done especially nice on this pair.  They appear like gold."
5.0,The compression sleeves are good and I will definitely order again.
5.0,As good or better than original lenses
5.0,Easy application....
5.0,"Good quality, just what I was looking for."
5.0,"Read over the description and the dimensions.  If that's what you are looking for, you'll be happy."
5.0,These are amazing.  I was training for a 7 day backpacking hike and these things kept my legs from swelling while I trained and while I hiked.  I would highly recommend them!  I trained part of the time (4-5 mile daily hikes with a 25 lb backpack) without them as I didn't get them until 1/2 the way through my training.  I could tell an immediate difference the first day I wore them.  I didn't get nearly as tired.  It made training - and hiking - so much more pleasurable.
5.0,Fits good in all the right places. I love the way this looks on my. The material feels good.
5.0,Love the dress love the material just too big according to measurements
5.0,"SO CUTE!!!! I’m in love with this top!!! It’s perfectly fitted, and I love that even though it is a lightweight and airy material, it’s not see through!! I got the white with red polka dots and I can easy wear without a bra with no worries!!<br /><br />For size reference- I’m 5’5”, 105 pounds, 32B, and I got the smallest size!"
5.0,Fit true to size. Seem like better quality than some discount Box Store brands.
5.0,"Great quality. Nice brushed cotton fabric. Adjustable, with a clip and a slot to hide the adjusted end. Nice graphic."
5.0,Great fit the size chart is perfect.
5.0,"I ordered these tights about 3 months ago for my daughter and they fit well, hold up to wash (in the machine in a lingerie bag), and she says they are comfortable during ballet class. Also, they have not faded."
5.0,Most comfortable socks ever. Love them
5.0,I'm 5'6 175. This shirt is cute. Nice fabric. It does run large. I got an xlarge because of the material but definitely should've ordered a large.
5.0,This is so cute and just the perfect size just like I expected I loved it.
5.0,Love this jacket.  It’s tight in the arm pits though. Other than that it’s comfy and very warm 😊
5.0,"I wanted to buy more expensive ones. But I found this one at Amazon and since it was ""prime with free returns"" I gave it a chance. That was beyond my expectation. Comfortable, warm and good looking. I like it! Be aware that like any other new towel, it makes some lints for the first uses. You may wash and dry it in a dryer to remove the lints."
5.0,Very heavy weight. Great look. Very pleased with purchase.
5.0,"My 5-year-old daughter loves everything pink, and these sandals are her new favorites. She says they’re comfortable, and they’re easy for her to put on herself. She doesn’t mix up which shoe goes on which foot as much with these sandals as she does with other shoes, so that’s a plus."
5.0,Fits great! Very nice product and love the laces! Will definitely recommend these!
5.0,"Great quality, described correctly in description, and arrived on time."
5.0,"my son loved this, he has a dodge truck"
5.0,"I ordered two sizes up because i felt that it would be small and I was right... I would have gotten a medium for a size ten... but I got a 2 xl and it’s perfect.  It’s also really, really short... but i’m short so- its ok... I got it for a vanellope costume.  If you’re over 5 foot five... you may want to rethink this one - it won’t cover your bum."
5.0,My son is Autistic and the material of this shirt did not bother him. He really loves the shirt. When purchasing online it is a little hard for him because the material always makes him itchy or feels uncomfortable. But this material feels great and it's breathable.
5.0,Many uses
5.0,"Beautiful,high quality pearls fit for a queen!<br />I’m so happy I purchased them."
5.0,BEAUTIFUL!!!! momma loves it! such a good price for a amazing piece! THANK YOU
5.0,Exactly as pictured! Shines nicely it is sure to put a simile on your loved ones face!
5.0,"Material is stretching. The style look classy. True to size, i'm 5""3, 125 lbs size M. Only problem is the sleeves too poofy. I open the first sewing line and put everything in for make half sleeves,  it is pretty."
5.0,"Opening the package, the socks were neatly rolled up. Upon touching them, I noticed they felt a little thin. I live in the north so it gets pretty cold. I also work outside. These are definitely not outside socks. However these are wonderful to wear inside and despite being thin I'd say these warm you up incredibly well and I get cold easily."
5.0,Really cute shirt to wear with stretch pants and it fits as expected.  I love the pockets.
5.0,It's a beautiful shaw.
5.0,For use under ice hockey helmet.
5.0,"This is my favorite hat to wear under the sun. It packs light and folds nicely, and keeps a decent shape to look nice. It’s perfectly proportioned for my XL head, which will not look good in “regular” hats that claim to go XL. It works beautifully in the dry desert and in very humid, hot, sunny tropical islands. The removable chin strap is great for the windy days, because the hat is so light and wide brimmed, that it lifts and pulls. I’ve only had it for a month, so I have no idea how long the hat will last. I’ve been wearing it nearly every day now. Personally, I really guard against skin damage from the sun, and I still wear 50+ sunscreens and sunblock. The hat still looks good, after being packed and travelled  on 3 trips already."
5.0,"I've never played hockey but this seems like a legit jersey. There is even an elastic snap in the back that I can only assume would attach to hockey pads. Everything is sown or embroidered. Nothing is printed. I figured it would be roomy as it's supposed to be a jersey and have lots of pads underneath it. I'm 5'9"" and the Medium is good and ""baggy"". The black part of the sleeves goes bast my wrists but I fold them under and it works fine. It's probably that way due to the extra length needed when wearing pads. I've not washed it yet and there is no washing instructions tag, so wash carefully. Would buy again and recommend."
5.0,"Very pretty bag, perfect for daily life"
5.0,"Was looking for a dress for my cousin's wedding near the end of October.  Nothing too fancy but something good for a wedding and this fit the bill.  I also like the A-line type dresses, haven't worn it completely yet.  But tried it on once it came and it fitted like I wanted it to."
5.0,Very stylish and fits great. This dress could be dressed up for a formal event or worn as is for a more casual event.
5.0,Excellent quality. Exactly as described.
5.0,These are so cute I love them there great go with my dresses
5.0,"Beautiful , not too big but not too small, just the right size for daily wear ; cannot beat the price and it looks a lot more expensive than what paid for."
5.0,"Extremely accurate watch for an automatic under $100. Only had it a few days and cannot record more than a few seconds lost daily. The watch is a little big for my wrist size, but it is easy to see unless you point it at a bright light source. The bracelet that came with it is rubber and does not breathe, but its rather comfortable. I replaced it with a black soft leather bracelet which makes the watch look more expensive."
5.0,very comfy and stretch with you moving easily.
5.0,Bought this shirt for my husband and the quality is very good for the price. I really like it!
5.0,"Very cute!! 5’0 foot 112lbs, fit perfectly."
5.0,"Great product... works exactly like it tells you. Very nice color and the product is well protected by a hard coating!!! Key ring is easy to use and not big enough to get in the way. Fits great in your pocket and doesn’t weigh down on the ignition switch in your car, very lightweight but super strong. The spring loaded clip on each side closes tightly and doesn’t allow the keys to come out unless you open it."
5.0,This bag is just perfect for what I need. The outside zipper fits my iPhone 7plus which most don’t
5.0,Cutest earrings ever!! ❤️❤️❤️
5.0,Nice sweater.  I did size down. Comfortable and cute.
5.0,My daughter ordered this to carry favorite photos.  she loves it!  It is larger than expected and allows her to carry larger pictures.
5.0,These were durable and held up great for my costume. Super cute!
5.0,She loves it!!!!!!
5.0,"Great hat! Worn it all last winter here in Maine, and it was perfect for the cold mornings and nights. Great fit and weight, super comfortable. It’s a favorite."
5.0,"I have been trying for a long time to find a bra with padding and coverage that was comfortable. It is challenging for me due to a bone growth disorder. Anything that puts pressure on my rib cage causes pain. This is the first bra I have found that is actually pain free for me. The bra seems to be constructed well, so hopefully will last a long time. I have ordered two more. I also ordered one in a similar style that I haven't yet received.<br />But, as other reviewers have stated it does run small.  I ordered a large based on the reviews, (thank you), and it fits well. I am a 34A."
5.0,The price is great for this awesome silk scarf lives up to expectations and more it is a beautiful work of art to wear
5.0,Beautiful embroidery
5.0,Beautiful and well-crafted. I love them!
5.0,"This is a really nice casual summer dress! Great color selection and fits true to size. The fit of the dress is really nice, flows down so it doesn't stick to your body. The length of the dress is perfect for me. Right at the knee, not too long or too short.<br />Personal preference, I like wearing it with a belt, kind of gives it a fit and flow feel. Favorite part of the dress...the pockets! I've had some dresses that the pockets are bulky and sit awkwardly. These pockets on this dress don't do that!<br />Overall, I'd recommend this dress!"
5.0,Love love this dress. I always received compliments. It fits perfectly!
5.0,This is very nice quality - stitched numbers and letters!  Amazing price!
5.0,"Plenty of room for small bag, great clutch and if need crossover strap is long enough."
5.0,This is perfect for storing my daily contacts. The original contact box holds 90 contacts so it's a bit bulkier to store and once open the box doesn't shut. This glasses case will hold 20 contacts and since it came with 2 cases I can use one for each eye since my eyes are different strengths. Perfect for storing my contacts in a small bathroom drawer or perfect for travel.
5.0,My husband loves these.  Fit and function at a reasonable price.
5.0,"The watch was smaller than I imagined, but it is a perfect fit. Very comfortable. So simple, yet throwback stylish. Very much recommend this watch!"
5.0,Great! Love it!
5.0,its fits and comfortable to use
5.0,Great quality and price. Much easier to screw on than the tiny opal ball I used to have. Very pretty as well!
5.0,it's made of metal and is high quality. ggave it as a gift but it holds up and is really awesome. a little less vibrant orange than the photo
5.0,Great product will buy more and tell friends
5.0,"hey matt,<br />in regards to your &#34;with all due respect&#34;ful opinion, let me suggest you keep your messages about reviews to your self as it doesn't matter what you think about my opinion, least of all to me. my review of the &#34;product&#34; was in the first line, and using the term &#34;wanker&#34; I would assume you can speak and read and understand the queens English, so the fact that you missed it seems somewhat confusing. Also, anger is not an emotion I would have interpreted from my statement since my opinion of the anger directed toward the seller seemed unjustified. &#34;graduated A sniper school&#34; your lack of knowledge about the heritage and meaning of the HOG Tooth is only matched by your in ability to comprehend written prose, and finally for your benefit, I digress to a vocabulary that you might be able to piece together or maybe just have someone read it to you, slowly. Don't be a dumba$$, I truly hope that your two examples of your version of a &#34;valid&#34; review, (what is the lace made of? and is the bullet burred around the drill) were just cursory examples, there are plenty of positive and negative reviews and not one of them questions the workmanship of the product, and it isn't a &#34;lace&#34; you douchebag, its 550 cord (go look that up, or find the first man you see that isn't loaded with estrogen like you and ask him what 550 cord is)"
5.0,"Nice boot, runs a bit small so had to exchange for larger size."
5.0,This is a soft comfortable shirt better than expected.  I received many compliments at our campground Luau party.
5.0,Lovely Art Deco style
5.0,Perfectly small and glittery. I'm not a major jewelry fan so these are perfect for me.  Enough bling to go with anything and everything.
5.0,Good quality and very comfortable
5.0,"Very cute short. Not sheer, hangs well, washes up nicely."
5.0,"I really like this shirt.  The image is clear and the shirt itself is very soft.  My only complaint is that it is a little smaller than I expected.  I thought an XL would end up being slightly “baggy”, but instead it just fits me.  I would def suggest ordering up a size.  It you want a more loose fit with plenty of extra room, maybe order a couples sizes bigger than you normally would."
5.0,Love the shoe compartment!!!  Great gym bag!
5.0,They are stylish and very comfortable!
5.0,The stones fall out
5.0,I get so many compliments on this shirt!
5.0,Easy to install just remember to cut the bottom of the bifocal lens where it thinner
5.0,very stylish
5.0,Nice quality. Nice packaging. Came with extra backs and a cute storage bag.
5.0,Cutest teacher dress on the planet. Love it!!
5.0,very comfortable and look great too. The stud balls have 2 different (levels) holes to go through. I guess it depends how big your ear lobe is.
5.0,"I'm very happy with this jacket, especially for the great price I got! Fits well and comfortably, has lots of pockets, looks good. It is a fairly lightweight fleece, so not for very cold climates, but great for Fall weather or more moderate climates."
5.0,Everything wonderful and beautiful .. I recommend it
5.0,"These are the perfect dance tights. Having been a dancer for 15 years prior to my little girl starting dance, I know a thing or two about dance tights quality. These fit just as expected, are thick without being too bulky, and are soft and smooth for comfort. A+++"
5.0,"Perfect pencil skirt, fit exactly as expected. Looks cute as a casual outfit or dressed up for the office."
5.0,I bought these to make some homemade essential oil bug spray and these were a great buy for it!
5.0,Looks great and fits prefect
5.0,"Although I've only worn them once, they're far more comfortable than I thought they would be.  The color is perfect and the material is soft."
5.0,Fit was a little large. Repels water well.
5.0,My husband loves this shirt
5.0,"These are just right as far as being invisible in shoes, but still have enough coverage to be comfortable & most importantly stay in place. The silicone heels work great. They seem to be of good quality as well so far."
5.0,"Comfortable, like the feel of the material and just fits good. Bought it for a friend but tried it on 1st."
5.0,"My daughter wore this dress to a friends graduation party, she received a lot of compliments."
5.0,These shorts are so cute and have a lot of detail on the pockets that you can't see in the Amazon picture.  Very good quality.  Well worth the price.
5.0,I like this item
5.0,Great visual effect and comfortable straps. I was able to wear it throughout the whole night at EDC LV with no discomfort whatsoever. The material is nice and seems durable. I anticipate that it would last me a while with more events to come.
5.0,Cute & Great for a friend that’s moving away! She loved it!
5.0,"I LOVE these earrings! They are so sparkly in the sunlight and I received tons of compliments when I wore them yesterday. They are clip-ons so they bother my ears at times, but totally worth it! :)"
5.0,"Bought as a gift, fits perfectly."
5.0,My gf loved the gift. It’s very cute and the notecard came well packaged.
5.0,"Bought this dress for my wedding. It was beautiful and comfortable. Pretty short in the front but covers everything it needs to cover. I'm 5'6"", 220 lbs and I usually wear a 2X not I read the other reviews and sized up one. It fit perfectly."
5.0,Great shirt. Better quality than expected.
5.0,Comfortable and durable. No complaints.
5.0,Very fun. Created one happy 9-year-old boy-monster. Note this is copied from handmade versions (see Etsy). More of an investment but if this was for an adult or a knitting enthusiast I would have splurged.
5.0,I love the the tourqouis.
5.0,Our school was doing a production of Lion King Jr so I bought a set of these for myself and for the director. Cute and well made.
5.0,"I really liked this dress, had to return it, because it was too short. I am 5'-7&#34; and ordered a medium. Quality was nice for the price."
5.0,Perfect! Thanks!
5.0,"Just for reference I'm 5'7"" and about 179 lbs. I got the medium and I have plenty of room. It's very flattering on the waist (I even got compliments from my bf) the only think that I'd say is that it's kind of see through. I put a white tank top since I was wearing it at work. Packaging was absolutely pretty really cute for a present!"
5.0,I will be orders more in different color
5.0,Well made and I like the inner removable lining that abates sweat entering into the leather!
5.0,Our 3 year old loves them
5.0,"Probably get another pair, different color."
5.0,These earrings were a gift for my grandsons' girlfriend and she loved them.  They are good quality & very pretty-great buy!
5.0,excellent - fit as expected and very comfortable.
5.0,"Loved it. My daughter loved the hat, the parasol, Pearl's, gloves, and the feather fan. The feathers are messy but if you spray a little bit of hairspray on the feathers it won't be a big mess. Other than that perfect for the price."
5.0,"It's perfect for my lapis lazuli pendent, lightweight to where I can wear and even sleep with it without feeling discomfort. The other neckbands that usually comes with pendant was bleeding dye everytime it got wet or if I sweated a little. This, on the other hand, does not..."
5.0,I have these in almost every color. They are contouring to my figure and the material doesn't make me overly sweaty. I got some for under my scrubs too. I wear one almost every day
5.0,Awesome value. Only complaint is a few of the earrings are too big for my cartilage piercing. I still got plenty to use though. Would buy again!
5.0,Love this crop top. this is really sexy. Goes really well with skirts.
5.0,These are better quality than expected. Very excited about them.
5.0,My friend loved it!
5.0,Love love love my hat fits perfectly and looks good I always get compliments
5.0,"First I ordered the medium, it was small so I ordered the large and returned the medium. It fits very well, good material . values my curves  and is very sexy with the belt. Love it!"
5.0,I love the prints and quality. The camo and leopard are my favorite. The waistband is comfortable and the material is so soft. These are by far my favorite underwear and the socks are great too. I’ve ordered 3 packs now!
5.0,"These glasses were the hit of the festival. Over and over people made comments on them. I plan on buying a set for my friends for the next festival I go to, and I recommend you all to do the same."
5.0,Great Fit. Very elegant
5.0,Overall cute t with a cutout design on the back which is a little something more then your basic t. I’d buy it again in other colors. Quality is good. Material is comfortable.
5.0,"Love it! Very soft material, was not expecting such good quality."
5.0,Absolutely perfect!
5.0,"This 5oaks ladies coat will keep you warm and dry come what may. It's perhaps a little less fashionable than other models, but makes up for it in utilitarianism.<br /><br />This synthetic-material coat has the classic ""Michelin Man"" look and style of construction. Mrs. Stone Dog reports that not only does it keep her warm, but it wicks moisture away from the body. It will also shed rain well as you can imagine. The zipper seems quality but she doesn't use the buttons. Cuffs and hem are reinforced.<br /><br />It does keep you warm, but it has real practical advantages for really cold weather. This is a true ""snorkel"" type hood. When you zip all the way up, it covers your mouth, only leaving part of nose and eyes uncovered. For less cold days, just zip it down a few inches and you're comfortable.<br /><br />This 5oaks coat will keep you warm and dry in the worst of the elements."
5.0,"Rings were just as described, and arrived on time, so far they seem to be holding up good."
5.0,Most of these ball supporter man panties are so expensive but these were a very good deal. Purchased for a disabled man who spends a lot of time sitting which causes his bean pouch to get squished. These help a lot. Will only buy these chonies for him from now on. Thank you!
5.0,These are exactly what I wanted and super cute. Never buying body jewelry from another site again.
5.0,Swim coverup. Came very wrinkled. Hop when it’s wet that it doesn’t do that!
5.0,"I tried several, and this one was the nicest fit, coverage of coils, and price. You won't regret it!!"
5.0,Love it hugs my curves
5.0,Me encantaron
5.0,LOVE THESE LEGGINGS SO MUCH! Currently 6 months pregnant and I got the size M. I have so much room still. They’re soft and comfortable. BUY THEM NOW!!!!!!
5.0,"Cute, just what I needed.  Decent quaintly for the money."
5.0,"I absolutely love this shirt. Its soft, comfortable and fit perfect."
5.0,Looks very nice. The chain is a good quality and is thankfully longer than &#34;standard&#34; so it doesn't feel like it's too tight. It is also a strong chain which was something I was worried about initially. We have a toddler who occasionally will pull on necklaces and this holds up to that so far! It's definitely a great option for the value!
5.0,These are super comfortable and cute!
5.0,Husband loved product wears frequenltly
5.0,"I bought for my granddaughter , she had the whole set which we got a year ago, and the first one was all torn apart, when I saw just the cover for just $40 dollar fitted just wonderfully on the old plastic mermaid tail she had, very resistant even better than the original we bought a year ago. Just loved it, now look like she has a new one. I highly recommend it. The little girls will love it . Great purchase ."
5.0,"Very pleased with product! Outside is soft, love the colors. Inside is soft as well. Before I put my sunglasses in I was skeptical bc I didn't think they'd fit...they fit perfectly. Would buy again."
5.0,fabulous
5.0,Very comfortable and fits great!
5.0,I’m very happy with the bracelets.  It also arrived in a gift  I will order from this seller again. Thank you.
5.0,"Best Puffy Coat, I’ve Ever had!"
5.0,Really liked this fleece. Soft. Warm. Great color. Only negative - no inside pockets.
5.0,"The style is so in fashion, and my 2-year old grandson looks great in these shoes.  He wears them to church and with casual outfits. I was a bit surprised that they fit so well because his feet are wide.  He never complained about the shoes being too tight.  I'm glad I didn't have to send them back."
5.0,I got an XL I like the material the way it feels I'm a 38D and covers pretty well.
5.0,"The keychains were a gift to my son who just got his first car. They look is sleek for his age group, durable and for the price it was worth it."
5.0,This is one of three MdnMd dance leotards I've ordered. It is absolutely adorable and the quality is great. My daughter looks so cute in them. They do fit a little long but not enough that it is really noticeable. I would definitely recommend this :)
5.0,What ever is your size order one size larger like if u wear large order xl
5.0,This costume includes everything it looks really cool and it is fitting as expected. Lots of accessories included
5.0,Out of all the sweaters that i have this is the best! Its very comfortable:) i feel like a Fluffy Bear when i wear this:) it keeps me very warm... and its also very stylish:D  i accidentally made a mistake by ordering a bigger size but its doesnt matter.. its still pretty comfortable:D I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a stylish and comfty sweater!:D
5.0,Good quality. Soft. Great fit.
5.0,Bracelet looks just like the image shown. A great gift for any lover of outlander!!
5.0,Excellent yoga/work-out pants.  I love the pocket in the front of the waist!  They fit well and seem to be quite durable.
5.0,"These are some of the best NATO straps available.  They compare very well with my Omega strap, and for a fraction of the price.  They are soft and strong."
5.0,Dug it.
5.0,A+ seller! Love it!
5.0,"I don't usually have luck with purchasing clothes online, but this was a great find.  It even fits very well and I love the length of the shirt.  It even held up in the wash cycle.  Of course, I love clothing items with pockets and this one had pockets on the front of the shirt.  I only had to touch up with an iron which is a bonus!"
5.0,was as add. good looking belt
5.0,"My son loves these shoes. Comfortable, easy to get on."
5.0,"This dress is amazing! Full circle skirt, tight in the right places generous in the right places very flattering! I normally wear a 20 and the 2x was great- I am larger on the bottom than top of that helps!"
5.0,This is an interesting piece with me only being 4'11&#34; I didn't think that the legs for the shorts would fit right but believe it or not they do. It's a pretty piece and I like that it is crotchless.
5.0,I’m about 2.5 months pregnant now and I wanted a nice long stretchy dress to wear this summer. I normally wear a medium and so I ordered that and it fits really nice. I got the white dress with the navy stripes and it’s kinda see thru but it’s really comfy. I can’t wait to wear it this summer when my bump finally comes in!
5.0,i have 2 pair of these i loved them so much
5.0,"Love this hat and get complinemts on it all the time, although that my be because I live in the South but in any case, irally like it and it fits very well."
5.0,I have tiny wrists and 6.5 fit perfectly. I love it!!  Will order more from this company.
5.0,"This is a classy purse.  It looked good in the picture and when I got it, it looked even better.  The style and quality are similar to the purses that are sold in the higher end market. It has two side compartments with zippers and a middle compartment that can be snapped shut. It looks very stylish and can be worn cross body.  I am very pleased with this purse and will look for some more from this company."
5.0,"I love them, so comfortable and good price!"
5.0,I was impressed
5.0,This is a very nice watch band and very easy to change. It came with tools as well so it took me less than 5 minutes to change the strap
5.0,"My friends and I really love this, it's very fit to our bike helmet!!! we also use this headband during working out in fitting room. we are very happy to have this headband. Recommended!!!"
5.0,"The style of the dress is great for multiple body types. I am a size 12/14 and the XL fit perfectly. The waist is high as other reviews stated, so I paired with a belt. The color was a deep beautiful green. I got many compliments."
5.0,Personal use...Beautiful
5.0,This dress was very comfortable and the quality was nice. Very stretchy
5.0,Works great.  My silver never looked so good.
5.0,"Love this dress, worth the price"
5.0,My friend bought me this dress to wear to her wedding and it's fits perfectly. I am 5&#34;5 at about 195 pounds with a bra size of about 36D. I am always usually skeptical about buying clothes online but was very pleasantly surprised!
5.0,So super cute & funny! My kids love them.
5.0,"I know sometimes you order a cloth online once you get it , you see totally different thing but this knit pullover looked exactly like the picture and fit as expected. I am very happy with this purchase,"
5.0,"Good quality, comfortable and cute."
5.0,This product delivers exactly what was promised. I see so much better when I wear them.
5.0,"This little pajama set is so cute and well made. The colors are nice and vibrant and the stitching was great.The elastic in the waistband is good, not that uncomfortable elastic.  It is made of a nice stretchable cotton, I'd say the cotton is thick, but not too thick. With the weather getting to be in the 80's where I'm at, I was looking for some fun, comfortable pajamas for my little one and these are perfect.  My daughter will be turning two in a week and is wearing 2T clothes for the most part, I ordered the 3T and they are a little big on her, but they definitely are not falling off.  I think if your little one is in 2T clothing the 3T would work well and they could probably wear them the next year as well. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion of the product."
5.0,I think it can protect my eyes.
5.0,"Cool pair of Shades that fit anywhere. Better Built than they could be, but the rubber tips tend to pull off of the telescoping arms. A little glue should fix it."
5.0,I freaking love this dress. The colors ate so vibrant. Material is thick and stretchy. Great quality.  So many compliments. Great for work. I JUST LOVE IT wish it was in different colors!!!
5.0,Love these!  Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,Great walking shoes. Look sharp too.
5.0,They are your typical acrylic plugs. They're a bit longer than any other pair I have so if you have thick lobes they'd be a good fit for you.
5.0,"I love the earrings, they're beautiful. I got them at a good price and got them pretty quick.<br />They also are a great witnessing tool."
5.0,Really like this dress. Classy and just a bit sexy.
5.0,Great value and a great look.
5.0,"After losing a back off my very expensive, less than 1 week old earrings, I stopped wearing them. I was too afraid of losing 1 but these backs have kept them on with no problems at all!"
5.0,"These were very well made, I recommend them!"
5.0,It was given as a present and he lives it. I haven't seen anyone wearing one like this so I thought this would be a nice one.
5.0,"very nice dress , I wear this to parties and get great comments."
5.0,"These are gorgeous pieces of jewelry! I was really disappointed when I found out the bar was too short to go through my lip, but that’s my fault for not paying attention to the size and no reason to give a lesser rating."
5.0,Perfecto así como esperaba
5.0,"I bought this as a birthday present for my girlfriend, and it was received famously. Thanks for the great product and timely shipping."
5.0,"I am normally a men's Large but decided to order XL after reading reviews. These are Women's Vests with zippers on other side but who can tell when they're on. That's why you need to order up a size. XL fit me perfectly.  Best part is this vest keeps you warm all day. Love the heat location's too. I just Umpired a Tournament in Reno, NV 13 degrees and I  was sooo warm all day. Great Product."
5.0,"Great buy. Sturdy build and they last me a while. They also look great. I have ordered them 4 times. I broke them one time and the other times I have lost them. They are stiff in the beginning when you unfold them but as you continue to wear them, they loosen."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it, wears it every day."
5.0,I really like it. I’ve had it for about 2 months and so far it keeps great time. I’ve worn it in the ocean a few times without issues. Totally worth 80 bucks
5.0,this is a beautiful bracelet and all true to colors as pictured<br />i love the ceramic stone feel to each and seems strong
5.0,These are some nice slippers. Sturdy and soft. You can ware them inside or outside. I wouldn’t ware them to a store or anything like that. Just to take out the trash or get the mail. I would recommend ordering up i ware a size 10US. And I ordered the 11/12 size and they fit me. No extra room though. So you better order up a size. All the price is great for what you get. Happy with purchase.
5.0,Cute and Versatile
5.0,"These shoes are great! Good fit, nice look, reasonable price. My daughter doesn't balk at the look of it (seems like most indoor gear at this level is marketed for boys... even the pink stuff) and she seems to be comfortable in them after one game"
5.0,"The quality was fine, but it was too large, specifically in the top.<br /><br />I am currently between a size 16 - 18, but my chest is 44 DDD, so I thought I would order a 3XL. I recently ordered a different suit in 2XL and that one was too small in the top, so when I saw this one, I thought I'd size up, but apparently, this one probably would've worked in a 2XL. But that's the only reason it's going back.<br /><br />So moral of the story is, if you're a 16 or 18, probably go 2XL, even with a large chest.<br /><br />Quality and style was nice, though."
5.0,"I bought this product for my retiring co-worker. He loved it. It was a perfect gift. Looks like, I will be buying more."
5.0,"I absolutely love this necklace, the T in my name was kinda sharp but overall great price for great quality"
5.0,"My hopes were high, but actually they are really cute.  My feet look smaller than what I was picturing."
5.0,I love this nose ring . I own 3 of them now. I use two of them as lip rings and they work  great as that as well. The ball on the end keeps them from coming out and they are very comfortable to wear as well. Of course also so beautiful. I was looking for a small petite nose/lip ring and these are the perfect size!  Well worth the money!
5.0,"Fit as expected, very comfortable and elegant! Wore it on a cruise dinner."
5.0,That are great!!  They are a little shorter than expected but very nice quality.
5.0,"Perfect, is just the right size for my hats,"
5.0,Great quality. Bought this for my teen &#34;nerd&#34; daughter. She loved showing it off to her friends.
5.0,Great buy great value for money 👍

5.0,"Soft, comfortable easy to wear & sleep in."
5.0,These workout pants are a pleasant surprise. They look very stylish and are really comfortable. I am getting another pair. R<br />I highly recommend them.
5.0,"Wow. This is one of Santa's Gifts; that will make my baby leap for Joy. Joy, Joy and Merry Christmas to you all.😇💯"
5.0,"Loved the color, style, and type of fabric."
5.0,So soft and flattering! It seemed thin so I thought it would be see through but it’s not at all! Great quality for a great price
5.0,"It took me like forever to decide about what bag I should buy to carry my laptop! I am so glad that I made up my mind and bought this beautiful bag. The color is exactly as it looks in the pic. The material is beautiful and my laptop (13 inch macbook air) fits like a glove. The bag has three compartments so I put the charger, mouse, mouse pad and my earphones inside the second one that comes with the zipper and inside the one in the middle that closes with a magnetic clip I put my wallet, keys and phone for easy access.<br />I really am ecstatic about the bag and let me tell you something I normally never talk about but that is a big part of my life. I suffered from hemiplegia I suffered partial loss of movement in my left arm and leg (I can walk but I can't use my hand) so closing some zippers requires using my teeth to aid my right hand which is why I would usually left my others bags unzipped so I could reach everything inside easily, but there was always the risk of something falling and getting lost or damage; that is not happening anymore with this bag I can close the zippers in the Yahoho bag with just one hand and there is no risk of nothing  falling from the middle compartment it closes automatically, and I can still reach everything I need in no time.<br /><br />The seller was awesome as well they send it right on time and it came inside a fabric bag and bubble wrap over it, for protection, they really fulfill my every expectation. I might buy the other three in every color.<br /><br />Thank you so much."
5.0,Cute and can look dressy or casual
5.0,There’s a person who doesn’t  understand kid robot or zipper pulls. It’s mostly a zipper pull so it’s small on purpose. Also the box has to be opened prior to know what character is inside. These are typically blind box items.
5.0,Love the set.
5.0,Really nice top for the money.  Fits perfect.  Lots of compliments.
5.0,"Great little earrings, were going to be a present but they were small, (my fault tho I didn’t check measurements correctly) bought some locally and my mom loved them. I kept these and I love them. I think it is gold because my ears are fine. I use them daily, I shower/sleep with them. They look like the moment I received them."
5.0,Great socks for the beach especially if you hate sand between your toes.
5.0,I actually wore this dress to a funeral in the islands. I was told to wear a bright and festive color but couldn't see myself doing so for this occasion. I ordered the size 8 and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Great stockings stuffers
5.0,"The band is cool even though it's a bit large for a woman's wrist. So if you wear an 8 inch bracelet it'll work even without the stretch. If you have a larger wrist, the stretch is a major plus."
5.0,Very nice color. True to the description. Loved it.
5.0,"Very lightweight and definitely sparkle! I didn't vend up using them for my wedding, but I will use them for something else."
5.0,My wife loved it! It even came with a spare battery!
5.0,I love this necklace! I get plenty of compliments on it whenever I wear it out!
5.0,good look light weight and fairly priced .
5.0,These are lightweight and comfortable and the lens is nice n dark n works great in the sun i love these and there are much more expensive ones of these and these are the best value!
5.0,I love the fit of this dress. Very comfortable fabric. I wanted a pink top and was worried when it was called rose red but it was indeed a dark pink. So pretty. Exactly what i was looking for. I usually wear an xlarge but ordered xxl because one review said the sleeves run tight. It fits perfect.
5.0,"I absolutely love this sweater it is nice and roomy, the sleeves are long and it is relatively thick I would definitely order more if they had some different colors I liked!"
5.0,Nice dress up headband.
5.0,The watch is beautiful and well-made. It is light as a feather. I bought it as a gift for my future stepson. Truwood is an excellent company to deal with. They helped me with shipping details to rush The Watch to me before my international flight deadline. This was an excellent transaction without any issues.
5.0,I like to watch it is a very nice. This is my second one.
5.0,I ordered this for my granddaughter who is a big R5 fan.  The bracelet arrived in a very nice jewelry box and was prettier than I thought it would be.  She was so surprised when she opened her gift.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a tween daughter or granddaughter
5.0,Made my niece super happy.
5.0,It's just so beautiful!
5.0,"I have been getting items from Nic-e-shop for a couple months now and am Very happy with the quality and value. I just do not comprehend  how anyone can manufacture and ship at these prices and still make profit. The only draw back is the 17-28 days shipping time. As long as You are aware of this when ordering, I highly recommend them.  If bought locally in the USA price would be 10-50 times the price. (This is not an exaggeration)."
5.0,"this is reported to be ideal for the woman who was younger yesterday, whose figure still has it, but will not stop heads on the beaches of Brazil.  It fits well, knows what it is to cover and what to hide and makes her feel sexy.  a true winner"
5.0,Me quedo super bien la tela suave me gusto la orma y buena calidad
5.0,"Bought these for my daughter to help with her disautonomia.  Exercise is part of the treatment for this condition, but without the socks, those workouts were very difficult.  Really nice to see her be able to do them.  Great product!"
5.0,Review had been based solely on inspection. As our daughter had to wait for Christmas to receive them. She's gonna love them. They are as described need I say more.
5.0,"I looove this product, thwe quality it's amazing, all the bags looks really good and they have this kind of expensive appearance. Despite a few loose threats, there's no more things to complain about it, and actually for that price it's more than a bargain.<br /><br />I get this item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review."
5.0,It has all the features of this $40 watch everyone else bought in BCT.  All my battle buddies were jealous of how cheap mine was.
5.0,Perfect I used it for a outfit of choice in a pageant for my disco wear. I was pleased and the judges loved it!
5.0,"Great Quality! I ordered this because one day getting ready for work I needed something to perk up my<br />plan blouse, Just to give it a little something. The little scarf did the trick. I have ordered several and I<br />love the fit."
5.0,They are amazing! Perfect size and color!
5.0,Bought as a gift for my daughter's friend as an inside joke about sloths. Whatever. It fit her perfect and super cute.
5.0,Just as expected. nicely made.
5.0,Great fit and quality fabric! Wore this for my bridal shower and was highly satisfied!
5.0,"Lenses arrived in short order.  Simple install and they are like a new pair of shades. As Good of quality as the original lenses if not better (better in my case since they are ANSI certified for impact) and the installation video made it a snap to get them in.  I highly recommend these replacement lenses if your frames are still good, less than half the price of a brand new pair."
5.0,The colors look very classy and the material feels high quality. The bands are adjustable and fit comfortably snug on my wrist. I would recommend to anyone looking for some new color options
5.0,My wife loved it!!!!
5.0,This locket is beautiful and looks much more expensive then it cost!
5.0,Perfect size and great quality...especially for $20!
5.0,"I maxed out the tricep pull down machine, so I need to get something to add more weight to my triceps; this did the trick! Super comfortable, super durable, easy to use, and it helped me raise my max for pull-ups!"
5.0,I love them. They look very nice on the feet
5.0,I think it will look great with a belt.  Like it a lot.
5.0,Cute gift for a vegan friend of mine who is obsessed with avocados. Nice quality pin that is a little bit larger than most lapel pins come.
5.0,Excellent watch!
5.0,"The top is larger than expected, but I love this set. Cute and comfy, and was priced well."
5.0,Bought them for my mother and she likes them very much. Good quality and perfect fit.
5.0,These pants are pretty great. They’re made of durable material and work great for the gym or an under layer. For the price these are too good to be true  I have several more expensive pairs that are not as nice of quality or appealing to me.
5.0,Great shoes! Thank you so much!
5.0,I got the small because it was the cheaper option for halloween. it fits finebut i wasn't able to put the hood on without the entire cloak rising up because it was a little too short for me. I am 5'6''.  but other wise its good.
5.0,Beautiful Rosary--no problems with delivery.
5.0,"I fit perfectly, good quality at a good price!"
5.0,Like them fit well feel good
5.0,material was perfect and it was fast delivery<br /><br />thank you very much
5.0,They are worth the cost!
5.0,Beautiful. It was a gift that was very well received.
5.0,"For under $30, you can't go wrong with this army jacket- it looks great and has no surplus storage smell; It appears to be waterproof and entirely wind proof- the color is nice, and the fabric is quite strong. You have many pockets on the jacket, along with removable rank patches and an nice drawstring waist.<br /><br />  If you like functional military surplus, then pick one up asap!"
5.0,"I bought this dress on a whim and didn’t expect to love it as much as I do. It’s very flattering and flowy. My only complaints were that I bought a small and still had to hem it to wear it with heels. Totally worth it though. For reference, I’m 5’4 and 140lbs."
5.0,This is a really fun dress that I bought for a beach wedding in Florida. It fit perfectly and the pockets are just the right size for our overly large phones...
5.0,"Boonie looks cool, seems to be well made no loose threads or seems. Fit as expected. Fit better after1st wash."
5.0,I've bought these boots three times now in different colors because THEY ARE THE BEST!!!  They are super comfortable and I wear them for 18 hour shifts for work.  A little stiff at first but after the first few wears they are seriously perfect.
5.0,"These are my favorites! I've already bought two packs! There long enough to cover my butt, and pretty durable. I wear under my scrubs every single day and they are awesome!"
5.0,"This is an amazing jacket, so amazing I got 3 colors. I love the green, grey and brown. It is a warm jacket that fits perfect. Very flattering! I am 5,6”, 155lbs and got a medium. It sits right on my hips. I wear it to work, on walks or a cute outfit out on the town."
5.0,Just what i expected. will buy more colors in the future
5.0,"I really like these shirts a lot.  For $6, you are getting a shirt that is fairly soft, comfortable, and holds up well in the wash.  For the price, I expected the shirt to not last long - not so.  I have washed these over and over and over again, and they hold their shape (and color) beautifully.  I am honestly shocked - and pleasantly surprised - at the quality of these.<br /><br />I have since purchased several other pairs.  FYI, although the shirts are $6, the shipping was $3.99.  When I purchased several other shirts at once, the shipping was still $3.99 for several shirts.  The shipping costs did NOT go up even with a very large quantity of shirts purchased at once.  If you know your size, I recommend buying several at once (instead of one at a time) to reduce your shipping costs.<br /><br />These do run small, and they are fitted.  I am 5'4&#34;, 140-ish muscular pounds, and I wear an XL.  I have also purchased the XXL, and fit in those as well.  There is no way I could wear a Large - it's too tight, too small.<br /><br />Another FYI, this is a &#34;Zenana&#34; shirt (as noted on the label), if you're familiar with that brand.  They are sold under several other names of brands and sellers.  But that is a t-shirt brand I've always liked.  I didn't realize it was Zenana when I purchased it - it doesn't say so in the description."
5.0,wife like it
5.0,I love the color and the size of the bag. The leather is so soft. I am very pleased with speed of shipping also.
5.0,"Shipped fast, material soft but not too thin and not too thick, fits nice, armholes not too large. I’m between a Med and large, ordered large, fits good not too tight. If you are a fuller large and don’t like a real fitted look you may want to order the next size up."
5.0,Good looking.  Everyday wear.
5.0,This is only suitable for younger children under 5
5.0,"The boots work for me, but I did not but then for hiking. I am diabetic and it is only type of shoes  I Can Wear. They Fit Good I Brought Them Large Cause My Feet Swell So It Works."
5.0,"Just what it says, and perfect sizing!"
5.0,I purchased these for my keychains and they are perfect!
5.0,I bought this in multiple sizes because it's so cute and soft! It runs slightly big but I don't mind.
5.0,"Great quality for the price, love this band"
5.0,"These earings are beautiful, rarely wear them without a lot of people making comments about them!"
5.0,Fits great and is super comfortable! I weigh 133 lbs and my measurements are 34-28-36 and the size small was perfect.
5.0,My granddaughter loved it. This pandemic has really taken the fun out of life achievements. This message bracelet gave some fun back to her.
5.0,Love this card holder.  It holds so many cards. Just what I needed!!
5.0,This is my favorite T-shirt! The material is soft and has gone into the washer and dryer several times already and still looks great with little to no shrinkage.
5.0,so light and comfortable i forget they are on.  received many complements on them.  highly reccomend them.
5.0,Perfect fit.great color
5.0,Beautiful lightweight earrings
5.0,Love my bracelets 😃
5.0,"LOVE this simple dress!  I bought it to wear postpartum and it’s perfect!  I wanted something comfy, that looked nice and was easy to nurse in.  Couldn’t ask for a better dress!  I bought a size medium (my typical size) and it fits very well.  The length is also great!  It actually fits like a true maxi!"
5.0,"beautiful. just like in the picture, if not prettier."
5.0,Thank you...
5.0,Bought this for a neighbor as a Christmas gift.  Was a great gift and very well made.  Price was ok but price didn't matter..... Product and quality of this product was great and to see the excitement on a persons face to received this gift was priceless.
5.0,"An awesome set of readers. Quick and easy to unfold and use, and the flat folding case makes it very convenient to store; either in a pants or shirt/ jacket pocket. Have owned a pair or two consistently for the last several years, and have had very positive compliments, or comments on their versatility."
5.0,"Nice wallet as advertised. Nothing to dislike,"
5.0,Absolutely delightful! Received so many compliments  - I ordered a second color. Ordered size Large - typically I'm a true size 8-10. Length was a little long ( I'm 5'3&#34; ) so I WEAR HEELS - fabulous quality / rapid shopping / incredible pricing... Treat yourself!
5.0,"I’m plus size, (size 18) and I was afraid it wasn’t going to fit properly like other brands but this fit me just right and I love the little pocket with the zipper, it comes in very handy. The pockets are nice and deep and the material is very lightweight and easy to clean. I will most definitely buy these only in the future. Looks just like the picture!"
5.0,"This is a really neat badge, large and hefty, and well worth the price.  It's everything it's advertised to be."
5.0,"Comfortable, and adds warmth to whatever I wear during the colder months. This is my go-to shirt for under sweaters or long sleeve shirts all winter long. There are better choices for outdoor activities where wicking is so important. But for everyday wear around town, this shirt does the job. I came back to buy more."
5.0,These are wonderful cozy socks. I enjoy wearing them with boots.
5.0,"Many abalone earrings on Amazon are just stickers on one side of a plastic disc.<br /><br />However this pair may or may not really be real - but it sure feels like it! They have a nice heft to them and the pattern is on both sides. Love, love, LOVE!"
5.0,This was given as a Secret Santa gift!! But I loved how soft an quality it was !!
5.0,Beautiful ring. Runs very small ordered my fiancee one size bigger had to exchange it for bigger. My suggestion would be order 2 sizes bigger
5.0,This is perfect. I love the color. It's just like the picture. I don't like purses so I decided on a mini backpack. I needed it for a trip im taking in June. I haven't seem any recent reviews on this so I was hesitant on buying because other reviews said the straps weren't good. It looks like they fixed the issue and they are just like regular straps. The pocket in the back ment for a phone won't work if you have a bigger phone. I have the galaxy s20+. The pocket in the front will fit a bigger phone. It's very good quality and it's perfect for what I needed it for.
5.0,"Gorgeous necklace. I have received so many complements on this necklace after only wearing it twice. It dresses up any outfit and it the style right now. Being a major fashionista, you can not go wrong with this very cute black velvet choaker.<br /><br />By the way it came extremely fast in the mail!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:996093cfa01658efd1cdd53ee9ca7e90]] Love this dress for this upcoming season, Fits great."
5.0,These pajamas were very soft and comfortable. Great value for price.
5.0,"I love these lounge pants!! Soft, comfy and long!  I’m 5’9 and the still hit the floor."
5.0,Cute and comfortable !! Fits according to chart
5.0,"Valió la pena la inversión, buen material."
5.0,"Spent what seems like forever trying to find large star earrings!! These are exactly as in the picture, even size wise!!"
5.0,"A couple of stray threads right out of the package, but still seems like they’ll hold up. Good fit on normal/smallish calves. Soft material. Great gray color."
5.0,Really charming bracelet and necklace
5.0,Beautiful quality silk pocket square
5.0,I have 8 hats and they all fit great and look great inside the case.  I was storing them in shoe boxes and we're taking up space and looking a little ghetto.  This hat organizer/storage was exactly what I needed.  I also really like the soft suede like material the case is made of
5.0,"I bought this for my wife, and was a little worried about the size since the smallest listed is US 6-8 and my wife is a US size 4, and about 5'4&#34; tall. I contacted the seller and they said it should fit, since it's made to stretch to a size 8, and that if it didn't fit they would let me return it.<br /><br />When it came, it looked mind blowing just out of the package even before she put it on. She tried it on and wow! It fit like a glove and is very sexy. She said it is very comfortable and it easy to get on and off, also no funky smell or anything out of the packaging, but it's still a good idea to rinse it before wearing. It is a little tight around the neck if zipped up all the way, but even unzipped a little it is amazing on her.<br /><br />If you want a nice but inexpensive catsuit definitely give this one a try. I know we are not sorry we did."
5.0,Very vibrant  and pretty colors. The dress is so soft and comfortable and has plenty of stretch. Seems to be good quality as well.
5.0,My son love this sock. Its comfortable i like the fabric seems strong and can be use for too long.
5.0,Work really well stays on and holds glasses good
5.0,The style and cut is very flattering to my body. It fits perfectly. I love it. I’ll wear it with a pair of shorts to a beach party.
5.0,"Love the shirt, looks great. Great product."
5.0,Wow these are really comfy. They stay up all day don’t ride down or anything and they’re seamless . Love the winter colors!
5.0,My husband and I have been looking for lanyards that are adjustable and comfortable at the same time.  We love them.
5.0,I got these to put in goody bags for my kids friends. These are priced great. They work very well and the kids loved them. There were quite a few left over so we kept them and my husband and I have used them often. The clear ones are actually bright enough that I've looked in my sons mouth when he was sick with one. I highly recommend!
5.0,"Super feminine and delicate. Length hits just right under my collarbone. Has not turned while wearing over night, exercising, and showering."
5.0,Loved it. Nice on field replica
5.0,True compression sox that don't slip down or press too hard leaving large unsightly visible indentations. I really like the design they went with its very Battle Star Galactica 1978. I do love the color but blue sox that come up that high pick up everything off the floor. These are NOT thin nor are they Asian School girls uniform knee sox. These are thick and more durable I am hoping these will last me a long time but i wear boots a lot and most sox don't last more than six month before thinning out and getting holes.
5.0,Really beautifully made and packaged. Very high end looking.
5.0,Half dome gloves.  Very grippy on the cables.  Used leather gloves on previous ascents and these were much better!
5.0,I ordered this dress for my mom who is going to a 50's themed party.  Absolutely cute dress! It fits a bit big but it's comfortable according to her. She loves it!
5.0,Perfect for a gift!
5.0,"I am well aware of the great quality of Yianna brand as I currently wear their waist trainer and it works great. This is made of great quality and sucks me on well. It’s comfortable as well and doesn’t make me feel like I can’t breath. I wore it all day in the home and even ran errands with it with no issues. I did have a little trouble getting over my big thighs, nothing big and it didn’t take long to pull it up as I ordered this based on my thighs measurement and not waist. I could’ve pulled it up more but I find when I allow things to go up further it makes me feel nauseous so I left a gap for my own comfort. It has a pee-hole for easy bathroom use so this going to be great for wearing it out under dresses. I’ll definitely be buying more as I lose weight and will wear this to help me in my weight loss journey."
5.0,Really cute and fits perfectly on my phone the item arrived and was delivered in no time just a couple of days and it showed up in my mail box I've got alot of compliments on this cute little charm it goes perfectly with my Snoopy phone case thanks Amazon
5.0,Fluid fit and gorgeous fabric. I have these in 4 sizes!
5.0,Comfortable to wear
5.0,Extended my necklace perfectly.
5.0,Everything was pretty. And Durable!
5.0,Very cute out even though I received a different color maybe they thought pink is green???  Overall cute and comfy no pictures needed outfit is as it is on the pictures
5.0,"These are very comfy, with a somewhat smooth-feeling (but not shiny-slick!) fabric that is tightly woven, but light-weight. I don't feel stifled during sweaty workouts. The fabric molds to your shape and the waistband isn't overly tight, so these are perfect for yoga, but probably less suited to high-impact activities like running. When it comes to opacity in the rear department, I will at least say that I've not had any underwear &#34;peek-through&#34; brought to my attention, the couple of times I've worn them; if they are at all sheer, it's well-disguised."
5.0,"thick, good quality cotton knit. fits snugly and stays in place during yoga/dance movement. after wearing a few times, i ordered a couple more."
5.0,Beautiful dress color style and fit was perfect.
5.0,"I got this as a Christmas present for someone, so I was a little worried when it took several months to arrive; but, it had to come all the way from China, so I get it. I liked how the quality of the material seemed high, solid, and had a bit of weight to it but not to much for a keychain. It was great to see that the pointy bits at the bottom were not sharp."
5.0,"These pants are perfect - exactly what I wanted. They are quite sheer but in the dark color you can’t see through them. It makes them very light and perfect for summer. I prefer long pants and these are at the ankle, but they aren’t too short. I’m 5’ 5” and 150 lbs and I ordered a medium. The elastic is pretty tight, but the medium fits right at my belly button. I probably could have ordered a large if I wanted them to sit lower. Love them! Pattern and color is beautiful."
5.0,"Beautiful dress, great fit. Buy it"
5.0,"Great quality, thick but soft leather"
5.0,"A pretty good balaclava. Material is very thin, but it is still a lot better than the raw wind on your bare skin. Elasticity of the material is really good. I wear it almost everyday now that we're seeing temps well below freezing."
5.0,My daughter loves this dress! Fits snug but not tight- true to size.
5.0,Beautiful! I usually wear a large but the small fits me perfectly!
5.0,It worked out really well and I love the mesh design!
5.0,"Fast delivery, good so far, would buy again"

5.0,Fits as described and is easy to clean.
5.0,Loved shirt
5.0,"I love the fit and feel and the curved bottom hem. It offers great freedom of movement, doesn't bind or chafe & I like the look of it. I can't speak for bigger men, but it fits me perfectly. (I'm 5' 8"", 145). Not too tight, but not a lot of extra, either. Tailored but comfortable look. Will buy again."
5.0,These are great! Got them for a Vegas trip and they do exactly what they're supposed to! The hearts looks so good!
5.0,"Perfect bag to hold your cash, cards, phone, keys, smokes... ect.  I get complaints on the regular.  Bigger then your average wristlet."
5.0,Love it works great
5.0,Good case for a good price
5.0,So far good watch I like it. Good value for the price

5.0,Nice thickness of leather with vent openings.
5.0,i got these for $2.23 and free shipping im happy with the purchase these earrings look like something most stores would sell for $10-$15 the purple stone has a nice little reflection to it and sparkles. as long as the stones hold up and the metal dont tarnsih i think these will get lots of wear!
5.0,Fits great the bill could be a little stronger
5.0,"Our favorite bibs. The milk doesn't run down the neck. Looks nicer than those tacky terrycloth printed bibs. Very nice quality. Washes well, and truly stain resistant."
5.0,Nice watch. Just as i expected.
5.0,I loved this  mother and daughter dress .!!it came very fast.! I’m a bit short so I had to cut and ham a little bit.. either than that everything else fits perfectly..!!! I gat last of comments on church☺️🤗
5.0,"I've had this awhile now, and it's holding up beautifully. Any key can come off or go on easily.  It's lightweight and fits in my pocket easily."

5.0,"Comfortable and creates smooth lines under clothes . Finally a bra I can wear all day and doesn't move or become uncomfortable. Just sad I can't wear it with all my wardrobe. The bra shows along the chest with most of my 'V' neck shirts and blouses, but wear it every chance I get. I'm a 36 B and wearing the large. I will be ordering this again!"
5.0,The stretch and flexibility of product and breathable
5.0,"I adore this dress! Bright colors are my favorite. Add cute heart buttons and a little ruffle, and I hit buy so fast I nearly got a finger cramp.<br /><br />It was even better when I got it. The cut is very flattering, and the fabric is durable and a little stretchy. I ordered the orange color, and it's a true orange rather than a coral.<br /><br />My details: 5'3&#34;, 155 lbs, 36B bra.

I also love that the front part is not too much fabric so that my forehead doesn’t look twice the size!"

5.0,Very soft fabric and comfortable.
5.0,Really like it.  Am glad it is loose fitting without tight band around chest area.  Provides enough coverage so works well under tight fitting shirts.  After the first one I went ahead and order a second one.
5.0,These masks are playful and cute.  Adults and children love them.  They are true to the style and detail of the picture.  Since there are so many I do not bother to wash them and I do not remember are they even washable.  They are very nice

5.0,Looks expensive and intricate but is very affordable! Love it!
5.0,So cute.  Carter's quality and nice fit.
5.0,"I wore this lovely dress to the theater. So comfortable, better than a Tee and jeans. AND it has pockets, can it get any better than this? The knit material is about a medium thickness, so unders don't show through, but light enough that the long sleeves are great up to about 70 degrees. the fabric is so silky and after sitting for a couple of hours in the car - no wrinkles. I may just have to get another in a different color!"
5.0,"Fun print, kept toddler interested in wearing it. The adjustable ear loops were easy to maneuver while on their face and I like the bendable nose piece feature. The fit was right."
5.0,I bought this for my 8 yr old son. Fits perfect.
5.0,"Great value, quality socks. Bought a pack of 5, 3 black, one grey and one white.<br /><br />The packaging is great, and the build quality is superb. Size wise, the socks fit me perfect (I wear regular size 8 shoes), not too tight, not too loose, just right. It says one size fit all, anyway.

Also, it will  help spread this review with others to help them make an informed decision<br /><br />Thanks, fellow reviewer"
5.0,A little too big from my 6 month old. Wonderful quality and a very good price
5.0,"I really like these shorts.  I have some of this brand sweatpants, and I was so satisfied with the results of them, that I decided to try the shorts.  The fabric is a quality French Terry that is thicker than a traditional jersey short.  The waistband is well made, and non roll, combined with drawstring to tighten the waist if needed.  The length is above the knee, which is not like the tacky baggy basketball shorts you see guys in today, and the cut of the short is a tad slimmer, and makes the shorts look more designer than just a sloppy pair of workout shorts.  They pair well with a tee shirt or sweatshirt.  the fabric being thicker may be too thick for warmer climates, but for early spring in Georgia, they are perfect.  I am very satisfied with the quality in these shorts and I am certain you will be as well!"
5.0,Exelente entrega y muy bun material
5.0,God I love this necklace. The colors are so pretty and it's definitely the right kind of statement to make!

5.0,"Purchased these as a baby gift-they are even cuter in person! So soft, too. I know my expecting mom friends are going to love these! It's also nice that the patterns are neutral and would work for a boy of girl. They are also adjustable, so can be used for several months, I hope!"
5.0,"Love them , nice material"
5.0,"I wanted to update my black bags....and this big, bold, studded Hobo is definitely the way to go!!  This one is big, so be prepared....but it is very stylish, very well made, and really has the look of a real leather!!  I am a big fan of the single strap...doubles always seem to slip off me.  I love the attention to style it has, and also love the touches of gray, as I don't care for solid black.  This one will really stand out with my fall/winter wardrobe and give it a nice kick!!!!"
5.0,"Glasses are of great quality. They look good, feel good, and for the first time, it actually fits my watermelon of a head! Thank you for thinking about us big head guys :)"
5.0,Item was exactly as described and fit the watch it was intended for excellent.  It was also received in a timely manner.
5.0,"When this cardigan arrived it was way better in quality and style than I expected!!! I purchased it for only $20, but it should have been priced much, MUCH higher for the quality. It's lined, so very cozy and warm. I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 126lbs, and I ordered a small. It fits perfectly. I'm normally a small, so it is sized right. I'm am very pleased with my purchase. If fact, I going to see what other styles are available."
5.0,"Omg it’s so cute!!! I love how this thing fits , I like the side zipper , but when trying to bend certain ways it has popped open , not hard to fix but unsettling . I bought this to perform In so the corset popping off during the middle of a show is gonna take a bit of seamstress magic. It’s so flattering I wish I had a pic to share"
5.0,Only received 33 of the 35 but they came fast
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ba9a02b8fb851ec4cd4742cf1bb6272e]] I was SO hesitant to buy this online as my family is so tall. Even when I order from the tall stores, sometimes they just dont fit right. My 11 year old needed a vest for school. He is in the orchestra and they do concerts and events. I didnt want to buy him another suit that he would just outgrow and thought this would be a great idea. It really was! It not only looks great with his black pants for the concert, but good with jeans just to wear to school. He is thin for his height but with the belt cinch in back, it draws the vest in perfectly. It was very easy to wipe off, as the minute I put it on him he spilled something as kids do. It looks as nice as the vest we were going to buy him but the cost was 3x this amount so we didnt. I would highly recommend you get this item. The size is true to fit and its great quality"
5.0,"I bought the wooden beaded cross necklace and I love it so much! It looks beautiful and seems like it will hold up. Great price! I’m excited to wear this everyday. I’m 5” 8’ and was worried it would be too long, but It’s not too long at all. It’s perfect!"
5.0,"The fit is spot on, I normally wear a shoe size 10, and that's what I ordered (43 euro size).  Lots of compliments on the boots, looks great with a nice pair of jeans."
5.0,Love these. I have sensitive ears and they don't react. Even though the backs are big you can move them a bit to show a lot of higher up and more subtle. I had no problems talking on the phone with these and they did not fall out.
5.0,works good to separate one's toes
5.0,Love  them
5.0,"Very nice, change broke"

5.0,"Was delivered exactly as stated. It is a little tight...Wish it was about 1/2 inch bigger but I have a large head, so I expected that. I love the ponytail hole and the wide brim and that it folds up small. I wore it to my grandson's trackmeet-all afternoon standing in 98degree sun. Worked well! Bought another one for my daughter.  Fits her perfect (she has a smaller head) and she loves it!"
5.0,"I like the way  it fits, Especially that it doesn’t  flip flop when you walk .Soft  to your step.i can honestly recommend this Product."
5.0,Great hat! Not as warm on the head as other uv hats. Brim is nice and firm not floppy. Came folded but it is easy to reshape. Love the hat.
5.0,"These fit great and stay up/on better than most of the baby socks I've come across. At first the number of socks seemed to excessive, but given how many seem to go missing between daycare & laundry, these were just right. Super fun colors and patterns are an added bonus!"
5.0,"Beautiful shoes. To pretty to wear, I actually put them away because they were so cute and I think my daughter out grew them. So wear them while you can!"
5.0,This bag is beautiful in person and fast delivery.

5.0,Size was perfect. Lots of pocket space.<br />Exceeded expectations!
5.0,I love these masks! They are definitely not the best quality ever but I never feel like I am suffocating in them! Nice and thin/stretchy material. I would say these are a little on the small side so I would not recommend if you have a bigger face

5.0,I received SOOOOO many compliments on this dress!  Great find.
5.0,Excelente calidad y muy bonito.

I may give them as Christmas gifts to my grandkids who travel often!
5.0,Love it.....
5.0,Too little for my neck
5.0,Perfect fit. Great feel. Quick delivery.
5.0,"Great pair of sunglasses for my 3-year old.  He loves the fit & feel, and orange is his favorite color.  They're especially nice in the orange color being that he left them at a public facility which easily found them when we called.  I'm sure that any ordinary, average glasses would not have stood out as much."
5.0,This is one of our Granddaughters birth stones.  She asked for it and she loved it when I gave it to her. For this price you can not go wrong and never have to worry about her losing this one.
5.0,I ordered this in Olive Green and I totally love it. My husband told me it makes me look like a “davenport cover” but I don’t even care because it’s comfy af and if he keeps it up he’ll be sleeping on the “davenport”. For reference I’m 5’8” and probably 145lbs/5.5mos pregnant and the medium fits great.
5.0,Nice real leather looks sharp
5.0,Semi-formal outing. Dressup with matching necklace. Worked well.
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves pj masks. This was her big present and each night she has to bring these in my bed. If she forgets one she will get up in the middle of the night to get it. This has been her best Christmas with these pj masks dolls that are quite big. They’re very well made. I wish they had Romeo and the ninjas she would love the whole collection.
5.0,Pretty ring that I ordered for my Grandaughter!

5.0,Perfect for what I needed!
5.0,"We took these years to Disney with us for my toddler, she wore them no problems, I was able to attach some elastic to put different bows on it for different days. By the end of the week they had some damage but for the money and the use I was happy!"
5.0,"Simple and super cute. My sister worn this out for the evening. It is paper, but held up all night."
5.0,I replaced the band with a NATO strap and I get lots of compliments on the watch.  Just be advised that this baby is HUGE!
5.0,"Wow. I never would have given these the time of day but my bf told me to get them. Very practical for my line of work - provides comfort and fashion. I can stoop and not worry about my shoes crushing my feet as they crease or getting crease marks in the shoe.<br />I wasn't sure about them but after putting them on and walking in them I'm very glad I got these!!<br /><br />Fits snug at first, like socks almost. Toe box is wide so you can move your toes around plenty. DO NOT SIZE UP unless you plan to wear thick socks every single wear. These are GOING TO STRETCH as they are leather and naturally do that with wear ............ Keep that in mind when selecting your size.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, buy them!"
5.0,Great lanyard. Durable and will last under any conditions. I recommend anyone that wears lanyards to buy the last one you’ll ever need.

5.0,"I'm so glad leg warmers are back in style because I just can not handle the cold and I'll take every extra bit of protection I can get. These leg warmers are cute and simple and just  perfect for fall. They cover that little gap between my jeggings and ankle boots that I always have and always get a cold draft from.  Now I feel much less worried about how cold I'll be at all the fun outdoor fall activities plus I'll be super cute. Best of all was the 3 pack for $10. Get these, ladies."
5.0,"Una hermosa pulsera para todos los días, infórmales y de fiesta.<br />Excelente servicio del vendedor."

5.0,A wonderfully comfortable and stylish pair of pants!  I love them!
5.0,"The jacket is very light in weight,and very thin,like a spring jacket At 25 degrees,wind chill 5 degrees I was comfortable warm.Read about zipper problems.I took a candle and waxed the kipper.Smooth."
5.0,"I bought it as a gift to my mom, who is very fussy. She loved the colours, materials and fit. Washes well and the side zip is convenient. Length is just below the knees."
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves it. Bought her the watch for her 5th birthday. It has games, let’s her record her voice (she loves to sing and make up songs so it’s cute to watch her play them back), and takes pictures! It’s awesome."
5.0,Keeps the sun off.
5.0,Stylish and strong fabric. I highly recommend it for the fashion forward.
5.0,"Although this shoe is described as being &#34;entry level,&#34; a casual rider such as myself will find it to be sturdy, not terribly heavy, and not too garish in its design for wearing around town when necessary. Good shoe for the price. Satisfied, would buy again."
5.0,My wife bought this for me as a wedding ring. I love it. I can now where a ring to work. My gold ring is too small  now and soft. This thing is tough and looks exactly like the photo.
5.0,"I've enjoyed wearing these fashionable scarves throughout winter.  The beads are plastic, but that's okay by me as it makes them lighter.  They are perfect for times when you might want to add a little to the neckline on a sweater, or you don't want to wear a necklace with something like a turtle neck.  They are nicely colored, adjustable in how you want to wear them, nice fabric and pretty.  They arrived earlier than I expected and without any damage.  I had planned to save one or two as gifts, but I liked them so well,  I wore all of them myself."
5.0,Its a good thoughtful meaningful gift.
5.0,Got this lunch box for my 7 year old ASD daughter who has found a love for Peanuts. It's very big and has lots of room for the amount of lunch and snacks she takes for school. It's super cute and perfect for her!
5.0,Just like the picture I recommend I’m 168 pounds and I’m 5’1 and I order medium and it fix perfect just like I want it I hope this work
5.0,I really like this jacket. It suits me very well.
5.0,"Great shirt for post  rotator cuff surgery. Easy to get on and off. Good for wearing inside, sleep, and going out during recovery. I am two weeks out of surgery and wear them everyday. Bought 4. A little pricey  though.<br />Size up for comfort. Cannot praise this shirt enough during this difficult time. Dr’s office staff impressed too dressing after surgery and post op exam. Best shirt for post rotator cuff surgery."
5.0,Adorable set for an 11 month older pre-walker. You can't go wrong with Carter's!
5.0,Awesome little costume. My daughter is 2 and smaller. She was wearing 18 month clothing at the time and it was perfect. The hair was a little annoying as it wouldn’t stay on perfectly. Great outfit.
5.0,Great starter kit for my daughter! Came 2 days early!
5.0,"The dress is beautiful, but I was sent a very small dress, it didn’t close. Either Amazon or the manufacturer messed up the size. I ended up returning the dress :("
5.0,Right on time and a quality product.
5.0,The bra cup size is small.. but fits well... extremely long strings!!!  Not as gold..more black with shiny gold shimmer.
5.0,"Adorable, and well made. Runs long so if your children are short like my 2 girls, u may need a smaller one. Ended up buying multiple for my 6 and 9 yr old girls, and they adore them. Nice material, well made, non itchy so my oldest who is autistic doesnt have sensory issues with the dress like she does woth some materials. Bonnet is a bit small though, but wearable. I like this brand, we have gotten a few other dresses, and all have been great"
5.0,"Inexpensive but, beautiful."
5.0,It was easy to put in with the rook piercing. I ABSOLUTELY love the way it looks! And it's comfortable to sleep in too! :)

5.0,Fleshy!
5.0,"Fits great, looks great."
5.0,"Bought these as a gift for a colleague who had been admiring a quasi-similar pair that I had. Arrived quickly, not overdone on packaging (something that really annoys me is getting a jumbo package for a tiny item), and looked as they did in the picture. She loved them."
5.0,"I bought this band for my Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The band that comes with the watch is very nice, but combined with the engraved bezel, it has a bit of a manly look, and I wanted something more feminine. The red color pops nicely, while staying in proportion with the large watch face. I have very small wrists, so I did have to add a hole to the band to get a snug fit, but once that was done, it fits nicely and holds my watch securely in place. The quick release pins make switching bands very quick and easy. The band is made of a nice, smooth leather and looks much more expensive than it is. It wears very comfortably and remains snug all day."
5.0,"If you buy it, you wont regret!!!!"
5.0,"So soft and warm. I currently have a clam shell cast due to a broken humerus.Because of that and a sling for support, I wear a lot of tank and sleeveless tops. When I get chilly, this is easy for me to put on and take off one handed. Several friends  have asked where I got it, as they want one too!"

5.0,Works well with any dress shirt
5.0,"I paid for expedited shipping (1-5 days) and was told it would be here within 4-7 days.

5.0,"Love the feel of this fabric, very comfortable"
5.0,"Earlier this summer, I decided to purchase some nice dresses to add some variety to my wardrobe. I wanted dresses that are very versatile so I could wear them to weddings, the beach and while running errands. I saw a friend had a dress similar to this and loved it so much that I wanted to get one too, just in a different color since we have different complexions. I found this dress sold from several retailers, although they are all different brands, but this particular brand seemed to get the most positive reviews so I decided to take a chance and hope I made a good choice.<br /><br />When this dress arrived, I immediately tried it on to make sure it fit and it did! For reference, I am 5'6&#34;, 155 pounds with a 36D chest and I purchased a large. I used the suggested size chart which is located in the product description of this page and that, along with some of the customer reviews, helped me purchase the correct size. It is very comfortable in the chest area, not too tight and not too loose, and it flows nicely down my figure. The neckline is a scoop neckline and is very decent if you prefer not to show too much. The dress stops right at the bottoms of my ankles so it's also a nice length and I don't trip on it while wearing it. I love chevron prints and this one is beautiful and flattering for many figures. I ordered the black one and the top part is a soft black material and, from the waist down, the dress is chevron print with alternating colors of black, coral pink, white, and grey. This dress is made in China of 95% polyester and 5% spandex. The washing instructions say to wash dark colors separately and I didn't want to risk ruining the dress so I tossed it in a lingerie bag in the washing machine, hung it up to dry and had no problems whatsoever. I packed it in a suitcase to take to a wedding and hung it up in the bathroom to help smooth out the wrinkles using the steam from the shower. There were still some wrinkles but the chevron pattern hides them fairly well. Because some of the lighter colors may be situated near the rear area, I would suggest wearing lighter-colored underwear since dark colors and patterns can show through if the dress is pulled tighter to your body.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this dress and love the way it looks on my figure! I like that it has a solid color on top and chevron print for the rest of the dress so you can add some jewelry without the look being too overwhelming. It is nicely-made and very comfortable to wear during the summer. I didn't get too hot while wearing it and I got several compliments on it. Out of all of the dresses in this same style I found, this one seemed to be the best quality and I'm glad I chose to purchase this particular dress. I recommend purchasing this dress if you are looking for a chevron-print maxi dress for warm weather!"
5.0,Length is perfect not too heavy and not too light I love it!
5.0,Looks really nice.  Provides enough light but is not too bright.  Great access to charge phone right on umbrella is a cool option.  Good and bright colors.
5.0,Too small...  Unfortunately having to return...
5.0,"Beautiful vibrant colors.  Got it for my son to wear on patriotic holiday weekends.  Looks classy, unlike the stars and stripes forever renditions."
5.0,Fun dress better in person fits right
5.0,They are perfect!!  Covers my ears and are so soft and warm. I recommend this product
5.0,Very comfortable! I would buy this item again.
5.0,"I've been buying and wearing Wigwam Socks for over 20 years. Great quality, super fit, super comfortable and still uncommonly made in the USA."
5.0,This top  beautiful!!! I just love spiral clothing. The sleeves are amazing I would buy more tops like this.
5.0,I was so impressed with the quality and beauty of this item that I immediately ordered another one! Very well worth the price! I'm very pleased! Thank you!
5.0,Best thing I have ever ordered!  I recommend everyone buy one of these to protect ur car key.  I drop my keys so much and replacement keys are super expensive.  This key cover has saved me hundreds of dollars!
5.0,"It’s really hard to find cute bras for 34ddd at a reasonable price. I didn’t have high expectations given the price was so low. I was pleasantly surprised. They fit great, and are very comfortable. They also don’t look like a “granny” bra like most in this size. I also like how the straps can be converted into an X across the back. I ended up ordering 3."
5.0,Great under shirt
5.0,"I really love this dress. I bought it for my low-key birthday celebration in NYC in July and got tons of compliments. I met a nice guy at the bar who bought me a drink and got my number (currently about to have date #5). Then I went home to Texas and got tons of compliments as well - even from the waitress at a bar/restaurant. My southern mom, who is a somewhat conservative dresser, told me it was very &#34;becoming&#34;. I would totally buy this again, and I highly recommend it!"
5.0,"Pretty and soft.  When wool socks are too much and bare feet not enough, these are perfect.  Medium weight cotton is good to take off the chill without making your feet sweaty."
5.0,These earrings are super cute. The detail is great. I would definitely buy these as a gift for someone. They are a value for the money.
5.0,So beautiful! I want all the colors now!
5.0,love them !!!
5.0,Nice selection.
5.0,Very good quality for the price. So cute in person. Was very long and a bit loose.
5.0,I have these in lots of colors. Love them.
5.0,Everything was nice
5.0,My Grandson just loves it. Very satisfied.
5.0,"You know, I really wasn’t sure about this one, but it’s a really cute little summertime dress! The fit is really flattering, and it’s short, but not so much that I feel uncomfortable in it (which is saying a lot because I’m 90% leg and have a difficult time with that). Fit true to size"
5.0,"Loved these frames, but they were too big on my face. The seller was great and quick when it came to returning them. Will definitely purchase from this seller again."
5.0,"Great heavier material makes it nice and thick a luxurious feel, but not heavy weight feel. I order a whole size up to be safe and it was good so runs a little small. Nice thick tie strings so no fraying. Pockets in front and in back of the pants so very handy. Hooded jacket with pockets as well. Extra comfortable . Easy to maintain."
5.0,This was a Christmas present for my mother.  The color is vibrant and the material is really soft.
5.0,Really awesome and cool looking party glasses/shades. A fun accessory that's sure to make you the talk of the party. Kinda takes getting used to though but overall fun to wear. Batteries do last a few hours as well.
5.0,They're great. I love them
5.0,"Way too short! Which is a shame, cause the dress is really well made. Nice, thick material, and nicely stitched. But it's just too short. So I had to cut it up and turn in into a skirt."
5.0,great product would buy from seller again.
5.0,Loved it so beautiful and white. Easy care wash.
5.0,"As with most Asian brands, the sizing is different than standard US sizing. I generally wear a small or medium in US size, but usually purchase medium or large respectively.<br /><br />With that said, I have 5 pairs of these in US Large size, which is one size up than I would wear for this style. Despite these being larger than I'm used to, they still fit okay. With the elastic waistband and adjustable drawstring, it seems like these shorts could easily fit somebody with a 32&#34;-38&#34; waist, which is why I said they run a little small. I cannot confirm this, but judging by the shorts I have versus my body size, if you have a 38&#34; waist or higher, you may consider purchasing the next size up than you are used to for comfort, otherwise it may be a little on the tighter side.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lightweight<br />Breathable material<br />Very strong but comfortable waistband<br />Built-in jockstrap<br />Short legs allow for easy movement<br /><br />Cons:<br />The mesh material is very see-through (especially the white one)<br />May be a little too short depending on your build<br /><br />-<br /><br />These shorts are very comfortable to use while being active. The legs fit to your body providing great comfort while jogging or running. The mesh material allows for a nice cool workout, but is a little more see-though than I expected (I've noticed this mostly with the white color.) The legs are a little shorter than I expected by the pictures, but if you're used to this style of shorts, it is not really an issue.<br /><br />The inside of these shorts is equipped with a jockstrap-type section allowing for extra security and comfort while moving around. As they are on the thinner side, I would suggest hand washing or throwing in the delicate cycle in order to keep the quality in tact after repeated washes.<br /><br />Excellent quality and comfort. I would recommend these as work out attire to anybody. If you're on the shy side, perhaps only wear them in private as they are pretty short and slightly see-through, but if you're used to this style of shorts, then it won't be a problem."
5.0,"Great watch strap. Very well put together, feels like it will last. I have fairly small wrists and it fits perfectly, with a couple of holes left to go even tighter so no worries for those of you like me.<br />The quick-release means it was super easy to install. So far I haven't had any issues with scratches or chips on the metal fastenings, unlike other bands I've owned in the past."
5.0,Sooooo great for seniors! EVERYONE loves them to keep in the car!
5.0,"Very soft and comfortable, and I love how it feels against my skin.  Loved it so much, I bought another one in a different color!"
5.0,This little tool worked surprisingly great. Have a large invicta watch. The dies supplies worked perfectly. Took me several tries due to my lack of experience it in the end it did the job
5.0,Even more beautiful in person! I would definitely recommend!
5.0,It is beautiful so many compliments!
5.0,This shirt is very slimming and fits perfectly. My fiancee' is about 5' 3'' weighing 120lbs. The sleeves hit at the right length and has room in the chest to comfortably bend over without pulling a &#34;Fat guy in a little coat&#34; Tommy Boy style :D
5.0,"Super fun & cute, really hard to see out of though"
5.0,"Fits great, so great material. I’m going to buy another color."
5.0,"I already owned these sports bras, just replacing some that are wore out. If your on the fence about these, I love them personally. Only ones that are comfortable enough for me. I'm not looking for support or endurance so can't say on that, but coverage, and comfort is there. Love the adjustable straps. I would say don't dry them in the dryer if I had any product critique. Air dry. Otherwise, came as described."
5.0,"Love these socks!, they are very comfortable, great quality, just like a photos"
5.0,Its comfortable and lightweight.  It stretches and I like how it feels on my skin.
5.0,"I purchased a pair of these to be a beater pair to wear in place of my rayban RB2140's I love so much.  I saw the picture of the item described and decided to take a chance.  The quality of the tortoise shell model is outstanding.  they have full metal supports down the legs like my Raybans do and the hinge seems to be of great quality.  The tortoise shell acetate is comparable to the rayban pair and the fit and function is top notch.<br /><br />They are accurate to the size quoted on the listing, slightly smaller than my 54mm bans. They also do not have the aggressive angle of the classic wayfarers, more like a mix between the new RB2130's and the RB2140's we all know and love. The polarization is even and professionally done, and the brown tint looks amazing."
5.0,"Arrived on time and yes, with the proper light I can see the coloring. My shipment apparently also included some free earrings."
5.0,"Wonderful hat for the winter months. This actually looks better, has a nicer lining and feels even more comfortable."
5.0,"Wow! This is the best quality Halloween costume I’ve ever had!<br /> It’s plush, cozy, flattering! Pretty sure I’ll be a devil for the next 5 years! I’m 5’11, size 14 and it fits perfect. Even longer than expected! Covers your whole butt unlike most other costumes."
5.0,I have tried for years to find gloves that really protect my hands from the cold.  I finally found them.  I got these on a day that was 20 degrees with a real feel near zero.  My hands were warm and I could fish out my car keys without removing my gloves.  I could also drive comfortably with them on.  I've only had them a week but I'm pretty thrilled.
5.0,"Lovely, but not as large as I had expected..."
5.0,"This dress It's gorgeous! I had so many compliments! I am 5' 4&#34; 160 lbs, the large fit just right."
5.0,Great color and material. Nicely stitched together. Very fashionable. Great value for the cost. I feel this runs a little big.
5.0,"Excellent product. Fits an adult male perfectly, very comfortable, very breathable. I plan on ordering more."
5.0,Great Hooded but it will have a lot of lint when washing make sure it turn inside out.
5.0,"My son is four and extremely into dinosaurs at the moment.  I originally bought this at an add on to a dinosaur cape and mask I also purchased on Amazon.  I figured it would add to his Halloween costume.<br /><br />As soon as I took it out of the packaging, he absolutely loved it.  The material is cotton and the spikes are made of felt with a Velcro piece to attach around the child's waist.  It's extremely light weight and looks very easy to clean.  Honestly, my son loves this so much, I'm sure he will be playing with this all the time."
5.0,"Purchased these for bracelets for a 5k walk. Other than one out of the 61 charms having the name of the manufacturer on it (why there's 61 instead of 60!) and having to find and remove it, they were perfect! The quality of the charms was a delightful surprise! The word on each one was crisp and clean. The edges were all smooth and rounded.  The metal itself was sturdy. They were an exceptional value for the price!."
5.0,I was going to pay 20-30$ for one of these and took a chance with this one. I wasn’t disappointed. Very high quality and comfortable. Highly recommend
5.0,It was a perfect fit for my reborn except at the neck area it’s too big. She’s 24 inch’s so she could have possibly fitted in a 0-3 months instead of the size 3-6 months. Otherwise beautiful outfit
5.0,"very comfortable, surprisingly good quality"
5.0,Great for  money!!
5.0,My wife loves her style and this was a home run birthday gift. Very classy look but sexy at the same time
5.0,Great if you have a light vascular disease the support is light burn effective
5.0,"THIS GARMENT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED.  THE BEST SLEEP WEAR I HAVE EVER HAD.  CHARLES BARIS, NYC"
5.0,"Best luggage I've ever owned. And I think it will last forever. I've traveled to at least 30 countries with this already and other than a few tiny scratches, it looks great. Sturdy, comfortable... it's a beauty."
5.0,"Just as expected, my daughter wears them all the time. So cute"
5.0,"I love these “like-butter” smooth leggings! Pattern is nice & viewable. Love the pockets on both sides. Fits and contours very nicely. Very good strong waistline, won’t fall down. There isn’t a hem at the bottom of the legs. Not sure if that’s the way it’s supposed to be. I just tuck them under anyway because they are longer than I need. Works great for me. Could be sewn for individual needs though."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:fefc81db2b30d1971cce060d3bd2a25c]] great size for price, and i love the design! proud to be a leo."
5.0,Short was a gift for my son. He said it was perfect. Very soft.
5.0,very classy and nice
5.0,"Bought it to wear for Christmas, but I am going to be wearing it more than that, it is too cute to just wear for Christmas.  It is a very nice and warm sweater. Perfect for the dropping temperatures."
5.0,This was a Christmas gift to our granddaughter and she loves it. It is a real pretty and sparkling bracelet.
5.0,Can’t believe the Quality and the price I bought many set no body believe is this price
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect from the price point but this is a wonderful little dress. Perfect with leggings. The flare at the skirt is very flattering and the scooped neck at the front and back is perfect without being &#34;here's my bra straps&#34;. Material is decently thick with a subtle stretch. Mine just arrived yesterday, I'm wearing it today and got on to order in another color. Fit is accurate to chart provided."
5.0,It's hard to make it face the right way. Very good looking when it does though.
5.0,Good quality big enough to hold my phone
5.0,My 9 yo says that they are comfortable. They have washed well for me as well
5.0,"I was a bit skeptical of this because I always, always choose a large, relatively structured totes with a cute, hippie pattern.  So, yeah, this was way out of my comfort zone!  But I am so glad I got it!!!  Now I did receive this in exchange for my honest feedback here.  I'm so glad this review opportunity came up bec a use this bag is perfect for me and my lifestyle.<br /><br />Pros: very cute, fun color.  Color very similar to as pictured in listing<br /><br />Made of a nylon type material.  Washes up easily and dries fast and protects your belongings if it gets wet. Keep my stuff safe when I was caught in a rainstorm.<br /><br />Adjustable straps so you can wear it crossbow or on one shoulder.<br /><br />Many pockets for organization.  I keep my cell phone in one and keys in another.  No more dumping my whole bag looking for these things.  A handy third, outside zippered pocket for papers/coupons/ etc.  Rarely even have to open bag!<br /><br />Summer just started and it so useful for going to the pool and parks etc.  Extremely lightweight, but takes a beating.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I mean, it's not an evening bag. But it's not intended to be one anyhow."
5.0,Very nice and stylish. Great quality and makes my Fitbit look like a new piece of jewelry.
5.0,Getting up at night much better when I can slide these on.  Very comfortable and helps with my plantar fasciitis.  Excellent shoes.
5.0,I love this watch. It’s so pretty and easy to read.
5.0,Great product!!! Can't believe the price and what great quality bras these are... well worth the price. Shipping didn't take long. Very happy with this purchase!!
5.0,I used this bag to store my sunscreen and other beach essentials. It held up really well and was super cute
5.0,Very comfortable. Good purchase.
5.0,"Very cute, I love wearing it. Very good for some one who likes the sky or earth"
5.0,"Typically wear a large and this fit perfectly. Long enough for leggings and I'm 5'9&#34;.  Light, soft feel. Haven't washed it yet...<br /><br />Update:  washed well on a normal cycle and dried on low heat."
5.0,"Perfect, just what I wanted now I can wear my favorite jeans with my boots. Great for skinny jeans.<br />Love them. Plus you can wear them without straps for a casual look."
5.0,"Although I'm giving this as a gift for Christmas, I would love it for myself. The colors go with almost everything, and the quality is perfect."
5.0,"Love this watch! I’m a female but wanted a big chunky watch and this one is perfect! A little tricky to get the day of the week set correctly, but once it got figured out, it was all good! I was skeptical skeptical about buying this from Amazon but it’s a great purchase for the price it’s definitely up to par. Also easy to remove sections (using the provided tool) to adjust the size. It also does not have a battery so it is reliable at all times, and you don’t even need to wind it!"
5.0,"Comfortable, great color and fabric, is not reveling and looks great"
5.0,This jacket is sooooo cute!
5.0,Great leggings to workout in
5.0,"Lenses look good; had to get a different nose piece as the Oakley one does not fit.  Once you get past that, Lenses are great.  The company is very accommodating and want to make sure you are happy."
5.0,"What a perfect dress. It is flattering. It is light. It is not see through. It's comfortable. My only complaint  - not great for windy days. A gust of wind blew the dress all the way up and I flashed some unsuspecting stranger. Oops! The wind continued to try and repeat the incident so I had to hold it down for the duration of my time outside. OTHER than the fact that I will never purposely wear it outside on a windy day, this is one of my favorite dresses. Hence why I now own 5 of them. I am 5'4, 140 lbs and it comes just below my knees."
5.0,Earrings are tiny and delicate. Beautiful! Great for a top ear piercing or just a subtle look. Works for my sensitive ears too.
5.0,"Thanks for the comfortable intimate apparel.  For a petite 36B frame, your medium set fits well.  I appreciate the ruffles but not the little bow.  The bow comes through well fitting shirts as creases."
5.0,Love it Thank you God bless!!
5.0,I baught it for my post delivery - didn't use it yet but I ordered some other brands who had cheap look and felt like dipar- so happy that I chose this brand.<br />I read the reviews before I baught and I ordered one size up and it fits me.
5.0,"Perfect size for flights. iPad, Kindle, ear phones and magazines all fit. Sturdy fabric and zippers. Lots of pockets."
5.0,Very nice!! My daughter love them!!
5.0,Love this romper! Got so many compliments at a wedding that I attended (I wore different shoes!). Cute with open toe ankle strap shoes. I’m 5’3” and 145 lbs. I purchased a medium because I am hippy and curvy at the bottom but I have small breasts. The top was a little loose and I possibly could have purchased a small but glad that I purchased the medium so it wouldn’t be too fitted.
5.0,Loved them!!!<br />Would buy them again.
5.0,fits snug but looks flattering
5.0,"very pretty ring , the picture does not do it justice, I love this ring, I would buy it again and the center stone looks about the size of one carrot and looks real."
5.0,Realmente me ayudó ya que estoy iniciando a cortar el cabello de mi hijo y el de mi esposo y lo ago el mismo día y era un tiradero de cabello pero ahora todo es más fácil con este producto
5.0,Set of two ratchet belts these are very heavy duty they are easy to put on and takeoff very nice quality I got these from my husband because he has a hard time putting belts on and taking care off these are very easy for him to highly recommend if anybody’s looking for a nice quality belts
5.0,I love these so much that I bought a set for my sister.
5.0,"These scarves are so cute! They can be used for tying on a purse strap or in your hair for the season. This set is Christmas themed, so it was a bit late for them for this year, but I did put the one with the snowmen on my purse strap. These would also be really cute for tying to a basket or gift at Christmas."
5.0,"These booties are perfect!! I usually wear 6.5-7 in most shoes, and have small ankles. I usually don’t like booties because they have wide gaps around my ankle. These fit perfectly, are really comfortable, and fit close to my ankle. They are prefect for skinny jeans and dresses. My new favorite pair of shoes!!"
5.0,"Much heavier than I thought it was going to be, thoroughly impressed! Great quality and nice black finish"
5.0,My husband loves this sun glasses and I get them every year or so for him. They are well made and look good on males and females.
5.0,Love this set!!! Sucha a great price for beautiful sets of rings!!!
5.0,"I wore the necklace to see Black Panther, and I got so many compliments! I felt like an African queen the entire night!"
5.0,"This was a gift for my sister. She loves it and has it hanging in her car.  Very well made, beautiful vibrant purple, and a good size so you can see all of the details."
5.0,"I'm 5'1"" and chubby and these are SUPER high waisted on me, they meet the bottom of one of my longer bralettes. I do enjoy it, because it helps me feel supported. These leggings don't feel like they're going anywhere. The waist band is thick and sturdy, and only the top 1/4"" gets bunched up when I'm sitting, the rest doesn't fold at all. They are seamless so I feel like I can move all around with no restriction. Because I'm shirt, they are a bit longer than I need, but they don't bunch at the ankles because of the material. They just don't stretch that far down and look good. Would recommend!"
5.0,"Beautiful, modern and minimal - the perfect keychain!"
5.0,"These are great and the shade of red was very complimentary on me, as I usually don't do red. Cute and Fun!"
5.0,My son loves these. Would buy again.
5.0,"I own 4 pairs of Roma's so I knew the fit and comfort were gonna be great. But, man, I thought my canvas Striped Roma's were good looking but these Gray/Red Geometrics are so unique and look even better in person and on my feet and these shoes fit true to size for me.<br /><br />And I really, really love the shade of gray used for the leather and the two different shades of red works well with the gray to form the tiny cubes on the pattern of the shoe. I also like the nice touch of using matching gray for the rubber bottom and the rubber on the front of the shoe. And with all my Roma's the fit is great and the comfort is nice and soft on my feet.<br /><br />Now with most Puma's if you have wide feet these shoes might not be for you. But for me these shoes are definitely 5 stars.<br /><br />P.S. Here's what my Striped Roma's I'm talking about look like. https://www.amazon.com/PUMA-Striped-Sneaker-White-Peacoat/dp/B00LV7XQNY/ref=cm_rdp_product"
5.0,"Love this bracelet,  beautiful,  and great price"
5.0,"This is SOOOOOO comfortable, very flattering and there are POCKETS!!!  I felt like i was wearing a nightgown, its so soft!<br /><br />I got the army green and its more of a sage color."
5.0,Soo cute.... definitely way short but with an undershirt its great.
5.0,This was something my granddaughter wanted. It was exactly what she was looking for.
5.0,"This is a great watch for work or sports or play.  The only problem is you have to be careful at work, because if you hit one of the bottons it will change the time or place you on 24 hour cycle.  Then you have to stop and reset.  Just a minor issue and NOT a problem."
5.0,I have had multiple wallets of this model by Vera Bradley. Super lightweight and great function. I understand a leather wallet might last years longer - but I love these cloth wallets.
5.0,Love it! Looks great with my Oris big crown small second 44mm!! Excellent excellent value!!!
5.0,The dress is absolutely GORGEOUS!!! It's a bit big in the waist but not too noticeable. The price was so affordable. I will definitely order from this vendor again.

5.0,"I got 3 of these for my Halloween costume this year. (I'm gonna be a kitsune)<br />They all arrived yesterday, and they were very fluffy!! I'm gonna be so happy while trick-or-treating! (Which shouldn't be too far away...) ~ The daughter of the account owner"
5.0,I bought this for my newborn grandson.  I had no idea how it would fit. I was shocked when it fit him perfect!  And he should be able to wear it for a few months..  I love it. It’s warm and fits great. It’s difficult to find good fits for newborns. This works.
5.0,Fits me perfectly. Gives me a smooth silhouette. Doesn't squish me. The boning in the back prevents 'back fat'. Buying more.

5.0,This piece is big and bright. It’s beautiful too. Very dressy piece and bright on the face.
5.0,I think it's a great bag for the pool. We've used it several times now and it's so nice to keep the small things in all the outside clear pockets so we don't have to dig around a huge bag to find a small toy or goggles. I just keep the towels in the big part and try to keep everything else in an outside pocket. I really love this bag and has made my life much easier.
5.0,"Super cozy, soft and warm! Love them! Even one of my cats loves them. I left these neck warmers on the table, walked away, came back and she was sleeping on them. I took one for myself, but she is currently hogging the remaining 3 as her new favorite nap spot. 🤣 #crazycatproblems"

5.0,"Color: Black Sweater/ White Words<br />Size: Large<br />Height/Weight: 5'7, 135 lbs<br />Purchase Date: July 9 2016<br /><br />I placed two orders purchasing this sweater in two sizes, (XL and L) in July of 2016, a little less than a year ago. The LARGE came with a fitted waist band and fitted wrist bands, in perfect condition. The XL did not have a fitted waist band, or wrists and the &#34;Wifey&#34; writing was completely stuck together as soon as I took it out of the envelope, so I tried to pull it apart but it just kept ripping the lettering- Thank goodness for amazons fantastic return policy! I purchased them both from the same seller, so I assume they are not all uniform to each other, as some have fitted waistbands and wrists and some do not.<br /><br />I ended up returning the XL that was ruined upon opening and kept the Large with the fitted waist and wrist bands.<br /><br />I would definitely say that these sweaters RUN VERY SMALL, as I am very petite, 5ft7in, 135 pounds and usually fit in size small, but large is a pretty good, slightly baggy size in this sweater for me. If I wanted slouchy baggy, XL would definitely be better. I have washed it probably 20-30 times over the course of the 10 months I've had it, and the lettering has minor fading and cracking now, but I still LOVE it just as much as when I opened it in the mail!<br /><br />Its not a sweater thats going to keep you warm in a blizzard or really cold weather, but if the office is cold or you just feel like being comfy, just throw it on and go! For $16.18 it was definitely a good buy for me, and I will definitely buy another color in the future!"
5.0,Love this combination of patterns.
5.0,My husband has been dealing with swollen ankles and feet for about a month. The doctor after many have not found a medical cause yet but suggested support socks/hose. I found these to give them a try. The swelling went down the first day and as long as he keeps them on the swelling is controlled. And unlike many other brands and styles they are comfortable.
5.0,Super nice for the holidays.
5.0,"This ring is beautiful I have one already, this one is a gift for my sister, she will love it!"
5.0,"It's not turning colors on me, I've wore it every day for the last two weeks."
5.0,"My wife was looking for this kind of socks with toe grips for a while, then she found this one.  We received them yesterday, they are very soft, nice, and the right size. The gripper at the bottom is also a plus to her, it works well specially walking on our wooden floor.  We love it and will definitely buy more."

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a491f126a63915816408a3504ba314d5]] When I recieved my Diophy Faux PU leather tote, I was so excited, and impressed by the size.<br />Not only by the size but by the fact this was reversible.<br />When I first opened it up out of the bag, I went to smell it, to see if it smelt like leather, and it did have a unique smell.<br />But I let it sit out for a couple of days, thinking it was just from the plastic bag it came in. I was correct.<br />That smell has drifted away, and the good old smell of leather is there.<br />I like the fact that there is no inside zippered pouches, or sections inside this purse.<br />Nice and opened.<br />Now everyone has said compared to my other purse, that I needed a bigger purse. Well I got one.<br />I like how the shoulder strap sits on my shoulder and doesnt slide off. I believe its because of the width of the strap, and how it fades thicker right down into the purse itself. Compared to other purses, where the straps are usually sewn into the purse.<br />I like the tasle that hangs and has a chain, that where you can connect this together.<br />This is a hobo bag where there is only the one open pouch/ which is the purse itself.<br />This is very stylish.<br />Now I ordered the tan one, and with this one it comes with a very nice silky design on the inside, and this is reversible. So this is like 2 in 1.<br />Approximate Size: Length 15&quot; x Width 8&quot; x Height 20&quot;<br />I can fit many different things in here: even an ipad would fit with all your typical belongings one would put in a purse.<br />Since I have changed over to this purse, my friends are like &quot;Wow!, where did you get that?&quot; They seem to like it as well.<br />They like the style of it, and actally the feel of it as well. And like I said earlier, the inside is quite beautiful.<br /><br />The only down side that I could really see is that there is no extra pocket inside. Some people probly like it when they have the extr pocket instead of the full open purse. But that is not discouring me by all means.<br /><br />I was greatful to have recieved this Womans Tote Purse for a promotional discounted price for my honest and unbias review.<br />With that being said, this is in my own words, and opinion, with the use of the purse.<br />At no time was I promised anything for my review.<br />I would highly recommend this to all of my lady friends."
5.0,"Very good quality, with great fitting."
5.0,"These jeans fit exactly as I had hoped. I am 5 ft 7. Weigh 210 waist 38 hips 47. The material is firm and soft, stretchy without being like those pyjama leggings which look and feel like gym clothes. They have 4 functional pockets and belt loops. I am currently on a weight loss journey for my health 50 lbs down I just hope they make them smaller than a xl I want more. I hope this info is helpful to my curvy sisters out there. I think they cld definitely fit up to a full size 16."
5.0,"This dress was very impressive once I put a belt around it. I got so many compliments. It also does run big. I'm 5'9, 160lbs and a medium fit me with room. 🔥"
5.0,"I bought the two pack in February of 2016 and I'm back to purchase again. The waist is super high and extra slimming. I brought this and was skeptical because of the sizing, but I'm a size 12-14 and 5'2&#34;. The leggings fit well with some room to give. I have washed mined several times and there has been no pilling or fading."
5.0,"Bought this for my teenage son.  We do not have harsh winters here, however, he goes camping quite a bit and it can get cold at night especially when it is a bit damp.  This coat kept him warm and dry.  It is nice looking and fits great.  Has pockets for gloves, phone, headlamp or whatever you need to keep close."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.... perfect
5.0,Everything I expected!  :)
5.0,The four pair of nonslip silicone dot cotton socks for women are an excellent value.<br />Truly nonslip and easy to put on.....keeps its size when washed.
5.0,Excellent product delivered on time.
5.0,Bought for my teenage son for his truck because he needed key chain. And i wanted it to be funny and cool. It was a good idea!
5.0,Purchased for my husband and he loves them. They are of good quality and stay up well. They are a heavier knit and warm
5.0,beautiful band
5.0,My daughter loves her hoodie. She is very happy. I have to make sure she has a shirt on under it bc it is short. Thankyou for your business!
5.0,"This watch is just fantastic! It's the lightest watch I've ever worn and the leather is so soft that I barely even feel it when I wear it. The design is great and I've gotten complements from several people on it. Even though it's so lightweight, I think it's actually pretty durable. It's not something I'd suggest wearing in the water, but you could drop this and I think it'd be perfectly fine. I think the leather will look much better once it gets worn out a bit so I'm enthusiastic about how this watch will look after about a year or so.<br /><br />Absolutely 10/10!"
5.0,My grandson loved these pj's! Will order again!
5.0,"This bra is so sexy and the color is just as shown, a very pretty turquoise! It is also super comfortable, and the straps over the shoulder are soft and just the right width! LOVE this bra!!"
5.0,I just got these and i love how adjustable they are and now i dont lose them so easily.  Very comfortable as you can adjust the tightness around your ears .  I only wish they had different colors then I would buy alot more. I really appreciate how they can just hang around my neck and pull on and off so easily.
5.0,Great value! Very fast shipping.
5.0,My daughter loves this
5.0,"I was looking for a watch to replace my USB watch that refused to recharge after a month or two. This one fit the bill perfectly! It's lightweight, tough, and won't break the bank! My only complaint is the backlight which only lights up the left part of the watch. Other than that, it's a blast from the past that works great!"
5.0,great for summer
5.0,"I needed a light band, water resistant for my Fitbit and this is perfect.<br />It is adaptable to any wrist size, easy to put on or remove and you can shower with it with no issues, dries fast.<br />Best part? NO smells.<br />Great product, suggested!"
5.0,"I bought the dark green in a small, I'm 5 feet tall so the length is good and the dress is comfy, with pockets which is fun! This is a nice, lightweight, comfy dress. The material is soft. Casual or dress it up with a belt. I plan on wearing this to my office and eventually getting more colors."
5.0,Very cute but size up.
5.0,Eliminate swamp foot
5.0,I have worn Ellen Tracy briefs for about 5 years.  I first bought them at Sam's Club but they are always out of my size.  I found them on Amazon for about the same price and I was delighted.  I would not wear any other kind.  These briefs never ride up and they have full coverage.  The material is extremely soft and the waistband is not binding at all.  In fact you never feel the waistband.  I love the modern soft colors.  I bought 2 packages of 4 in each package so I would never run out in case they ever discontinue them.  I believe that you will love them too!
5.0,"Cool design, the material was a little thicker than I had hoped, and it ran a bit smaller than I expected.  Nonetheless, really cool t-shirt for a two year old who loves the Beatles."
5.0,"I love it so much I am purchasing one for my Daughter.Great fit<br />Fast shipping,thanks"

5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, love it!"
5.0,"i look very cool in this shirt, its a bit big on me, but i like it that way"
5.0,Pretty. Wore for the holidays
5.0,I really like this ring. Customized and with birthstone. Great quality work. Very satisfied
5.0,"Bought it for my FIL.  Fit perfect, great looking hat and well made.  FIL loved it.  81 years old, don't know why no one has bought him one before.  Great looking hat."
5.0,This was a great bag that fits perfectly on top of my large luggage it has more room than you would think
5.0,"Thick and soft, perfect to wear without a filter (although I still wish they had the pocket for the option)...perfect for adverge size faces, but too small for larger faces so sadly I couldn't share them with my mom"
5.0,Awesome jersey - my nephew loved it.  If I had to guess I would say it's true to size (for a Jersey).  I feel like they're always a bit toward the larger size compared to a t-shirt.
5.0,"For the price I paid for this jacket - the material is excellent (really kept me warm on very cold nights out), olive color was great, the fit is good - just as I expected. The length was just slightly past my butt. I got many compliments on the jacket and my friends couldn’t believe I only paid $21 for it."
5.0,Nice genuine leather belt.

5.0,Perfect pants! I will definitely be buying a second pair
5.0,"Can not say there is anything wrong with these pins. The real issue is my big hands and fingers. However, I did a better job than the foolish person at the mall who installed a band onto my watch that did not come close to fitting my wrist!!??"
5.0,Beautiful dress very well made.
5.0,The sleeves are a little loose but I was overall very pleased with this order!
5.0,My boys love the shirt and it great material. Thank you.

5.0,"Este brazalete es muy bonito, muy bien hecho. lo unico que no es muy elastico, tuve que enjabonar mi mano para poder usarlo."
5.0,Gorgeous colors and ohhh so soft!!
5.0,I thought it was a bracelet but I love it.
5.0,These are awesome... I love the color.. I wish they would come out with other colors. I just ordered my second pair of these same exact glasses. This time they were a little cheaper then the first pair..
5.0,"Great product! Extremely soft, fits well, arrived on time. I would definitely recommend this product."
5.0,"This is a good quality shirt, with nice fabric, good stitching and no hanging threads. I usually wear an XL, I ordered a Large and it fits perfectly, with no pulling at the bust, and falls over the hip. From the picture, I expected the color was more of a teal blue, but the actual shirt is more of a dusty blue or cadet blue. I'm happy with it, especially for the price."
5.0,Beautiful hat but was to big so I had to return it.
5.0,It came fast and fit great. Back clasp was weird.
5.0,ITS SO AMAZING. This is the perfect size and i looooove the pockets on the inside. Great material and the same colour as pictured.
5.0,Honestly just a piece of cotton cloth that absorbs your snot. What can I say? They're convenient.
5.0,"Great quality, great price, beautiful piece"
5.0,Am 140lbs. 4&#34;9.  Ordered a small.  Fit perfect. Good quality.  Nice dress
5.0,Best rain jacket ever! and perfect fit!
5.0,Loved them so much this is my second pair!
5.0,Beautiful color and perfect fit.
5.0,"Love it, it's adorable. It comes with an adjustable band on the inside with a little velcro that you lift and secure so that it fits your head . It also comes with a detachable shock cord chin with a toggle, a little bit on the flimsy side but it does the job and held on when I was wearing it on the top of the ferry boat in strong winds. As a soccer mom I bought this to keep the Sun out of my eyes at evening games but I wear it for so much more already."
5.0,"While it took a while for the hat to arrive, it was worth the wait. It is extremely warm, I've used it in subzero temps with not the slightest bit of cold hitting my head. The fabric on the outside is almost a canvas-y type of material that is extremely waterproof. The faux fur prevents the wind from entering and the flaps have a plastic clip that keeps it nice and tight on the head. This hat has been a serious lifesaver for me this winter with commuting on public transportation. Even though it's a men's hat, it fits me well and my boyfriend wore it once on his big head and it fit him just as good as it does mine. Buy one for each person in the house!"
5.0,Very compact and nice texture.
5.0,"I delivered my daughter via c-section 6 months ago and had to wear high-wasted underwear for a while. These are my next step to ""sexy"". I read the reviews and did choose to size down. I am 5'7"", 165 lb and I typically wear size 8-12 depending on the brand. Medium is perfect for me."
5.0,My hubby LOVED this its super sexy and you can leave it on the entire time (wink wink) great buy cant go wrong with lingerie.
5.0,"Due to a surgery, I’m required to wear a compression garment (like a faja) for many months. My biggest worry was going to the restroom and making sure I don’t soil myself. After researching online, I came across this nifty devices. I was very hasitant at first but I was at a point where I would try anything to make my bathroom breaks shorter and less stressful. I have to say, I was very excited when I got this delivered. I could not wait to go pee! It took a few tries to get the device just perfect around the open gusset of my garment. My first attempt was a complete fail!!! Glad I was home when I tested it out. It took me couple more tries to perfect the right position and how to hold this crazy but wonderful device. I take it to work and wherever I go. Cleaning is a breeze. I carry wet wipes with me and a zip lock bag for it. I wish they recommend this device to everyone who has to buy or wear a compression garment or a faja (with the open gusset, of course). I’m so glad I came across this product. I love it! Kudos to the lady who invented this product! Way to go!"
5.0,"Love this light weight long sleeve shirt...I’m 5’5”, approx 148 lbs, 34/36 C/D bust, average length torso so I ordered a medium size and it was just the right size to sport the look of this shirt being a bit baggy/loose fitting but still being able to flatter my figure...Machine washed it inside out and hung it over a chair to dry and it still looks and fits perfect"
5.0,"I got both my feet ran over by a tractor trailer dolly, my feet was so bruise that I could barely walk for two weeks these compression socks help with the swelling tremendously."
5.0,Looks so nice! Buy it!
5.0,This item is very warm. Covers head and neck. I use backpacking with a quilt sleeping in cold conditions.
5.0,"love Love love!!!! This little apron is amazing, good quality it’s 100%adorable! my daughter loves filling up each little pocket"
5.0,Bought for my partner to use in her first Spartan Race. They fit her perfectly and kept her from getting calf cramps. The bright pink was just an added bonus. Will definitely buy more of these.
5.0,Absolutely love the dress
5.0,"Wasn’t expecting a velvet material, but super cute and great quality! Fit well and looks great."
5.0,These are super comfy and flattering. Definitely a softer Denim than expected but I love it!

5.0,"I had this for about three year I LOVED THIS NECKLACE, then i started having issues with it. Kept getting lose and falling off. Then about 4 months ago I was over tile floors and it fell off and broke. I would always recieve compliments on this necklace, a must buy!!"
5.0,Really love it.
5.0,"Been using this to train in the pool, has held up well!"
5.0,I wasn't expecting much more than the usual when I bought this insert.  Every insert I have previously bought has lasted for less than a year with either the windows tearing or becoming sticky and causing my cards to get stuck to them.  However this insert looks and works as good as new more than 9 months year after purchasing it.  I have to assume the quality and thickness of the vinyl used by this brand is superior to others I have purchased in the past.
5.0,"This dress is the best material. Super comfy, stretchy, and soft. Love how comfy it is and perfect for snuggling up and sleeping in."
5.0,Just as described works like a charm!
5.0,"I love the pattern, if fits my personality...."
5.0,"I have been using this hat a lot and it is comfortable, not too small or too big, and I even got a compliment on it! Considering I chose it bc I liked the design and especially the price, I'd say it was well worth the buy!"
5.0,Our son (2 years old) was given a pair of these for Christmas and we fell in love with them.  He is already outgrowing them so we bought more.  They are very pricey for toddler shoes (as fast as they grow) but they are super well made.  Our outgrown ones will be a great hand-me-down for a friend.
5.0,"I love it!  I bought it as a shirt and am wearing it at work now.  I am 5'8&#34; and a size 10, I ordered a large. The length on me is about the same as it is on the model in the picture.  Wearing black ankle pants and heels, look forward to wearing it with my new white slacks too.....  the length on me is about the same as it is on the model in the picture."
5.0,"I love this bracelet ❣️ It's got a nice extension to be able to fit it over your hand and tightens nicely. I live where it gets pretty darn cold out and the day it had arrived, it was still in tact❣️ After wearing it for a couple days all day and night it loosened up quite a bit so it wasn't that stiff feeling as it's brand new. I just LOVE this and can't say enough!"
5.0,"Have been using the Premium Waist Trainer Sweat Sauna Belt for about a week and while I can't say I see much weight off the gut, it most definitely makes the covered area sweat profusely. As an older male with a few health issues my exercise is restricted to walking, either on the horse trails around our community with the dog or on our NordicTrack. It's amazing how soaked you get around your waist.<br /><br />Cleaning directions are quite explicit. Do not machine wash. Instead warm water with soap using a soft cloth. I then let it hang dry and it's ready for the next morning's hike. I'm keeping track and we'll see just how effective it is in slimming your waist area after 30 days."
5.0,I love the bright colors and the pockets of this dress. My girls love wearing them
5.0,"Iam actually size S or XS so maybe this is a little small for you. I order it in M, as you Can see it “baggy” on my waist line but almost nothing."
5.0,It's good. Just the projected words don't show up very clearly. That's all.
5.0,Was a gift for my daughter. She seemed to like them.
5.0,"I bought these for my son who has taken up running. They are lightweight, well made and cool. The shirt doesn't ride up when he's lifting weights or running. He weighs 250lbs and the xlarge was perfect!"
5.0,Thin material but expected for the price.
5.0,"I have small feet (size 5) so these socks don't show my toe but I'm not sure for others. Overall these are very soft and stretchy, good quality for the money."
5.0,"I ordered two of these hats. One in tan and the other in black and I love them both.  First and foremost, they arrived very quickly and was packaged very well.  The straw material is really nice, flexible and the wire at the brim makes it extremely easy to mold or bend in most desirable shape of your choice.  I am certain that I will enjoy being protected from the sun, fashionable as well as feeling oh so chic and glamorous, wearing my sun hats. I would recommend this item."
5.0,"This is a really great set with the unexpected addition of matching cufflinks. The tie was a good length and tied well, and the pocket square looked perfect. No use for the cufflinks yet, but they match and look great."
5.0,"Awesomest Cap ever!!!!!!!!<br />We had a mini election in school, my daughter of course was to play Trump. My daughter was high when i ordered these for her Trump team. These caps got the entire school up and jumping. It was the coolest ever. It completed the look. Trump's cap! Our next president's cap! What can be more exciting then owning one of your own! The quality is super great, the red is of great color and it fits just right. You can adjust it in the back if needed."
5.0,Worked for a Halloween costume. Exactly as described.
5.0,"I ordered this necklace for my girlfriend as part of her birthday gift, it came on time and was absolutely beautiful. My only complaint is that the name if the company was printed all over the box, &#34;finejewelers.com&#34; and inside the nice padded box that held the necklace. If they took off the .com part I would have felt a bit better. That aside it was a great purchase."
5.0,Todo me agrado
5.0,Top notch bracelet. Looking for a watch to have an excuse to buy another.
5.0,"Nice fabric, good zippers, good sizes and finish for reasonable price."
5.0,Great product for any Ag!
5.0,"This watch was exactly what I was looking for.  I have had this same watch years ago and liked it very much.  It simple, light weight, and only has the functions I want.  The band of course is plastic which will last many years as will the lithium battery.  Very pleased with the cost and everything."
5.0,I am pleased with the look and weight of the earrings. I have only worn them one day but I had no discomfort.
5.0,I like it very much. I paired it w/a short black jacket. I like cut and material. Would buy again in another color.
5.0,It worked great for keeping moisture in my hair!!1
5.0,Great product. Very fashionable and good to see.
5.0,Lovely sunmer sweater
5.0,Was good for party
5.0,"These are freaking amazing. Perfect fit, great fabric, excellent price."
5.0,Great buy! Wish they had grey color.
5.0,"Finally, a hat that doesn't cover his face but covers his ears!"
5.0,I purchased these are earrings for the 25th Essence Festival. And I was thoroughly impressed they went with my outfit wonderfully they're so colorful is what originally drew me to them they are so lightweight that I actually forgot that I had them on until it kind of got stuck onto my shirt but they are really amazing and kind of heavy-duty I purchased a different pair earrings from another company and one of those Loops kind of broke off these are great they're beautiful and I definitely have recommended to other friends and family and looking to get things in the near future from this particular company
5.0,"Great watch for everyday. Accurate, easy to read, and what a price. Unbelievable,<br />Christian"
5.0,Love this hat.  Very comfy and the pattern is AWESOME!!!!  Seems well made and great for hospital work.
5.0,Husband loves it. He just wanted something that didn’t turn his finger green and he picked this one.
5.0,My favorite shoes to salsa in the cold days.
5.0,"I purchased the 6.5 inch bracelet, because I have small wrists. It fits and can be adjusted to my liking.  It is polished, shiny and captures the light and sits on your skin with a slinky, fluid drape. It appears to be good quality. I expected it to be wider for 4mm, but it is still a nice size. I plan on keeping it and I hope the quality will last."
5.0,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. It’s not terribly supportive. Better for yoga or just under a cute top.
5.0,So Beautiful A great Gift for your favorite Hair Dresser.
5.0,Represent 👍🏼
5.0,"EXCELLENT value, well made, polarized, good deal!"
5.0,"These jeans are AWESOME for women with wide hips and a small waist. They are literally the best fitting jeans I've ever owned! I can wear them without a belt with no fear--which is particularly great because belts and curves just don't get along. In addition to the perfect fit, these jeans are super comfy and look great. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch, so the jeans fit well but are easy to move in--but they don't overstretch as you wear them and get too loose, as some jeans do."
5.0,"Very comfortable,  band retainer doesn't slide around,  looks excellent,  doesn't look cheap."
5.0,I cannot say enough about the quality of Under Armour.  I have always been pleased with the way they wear.  The shoes are comfortable and stylish and the kids gravitate towards them.  I have been pleased with sizing and know what to order next for them.  UA has a lot of half sizes usually which makes it easy to pick a size for growing feet.  These made it through a basketball season  and on into the year.  I would buy these again.
5.0,Bought this as a gift and she loves it.
5.0,Kept my hands warm in recent 9 degrees weather recently.
5.0,"This is a nice addition from kipling! Its not too large, but it offers great organization for cables and charges"
5.0,"I love this dress although I bought too large. The material is much thicker and higher quality than I expected, the pattern is nice and clear and it's very comfortable. I bought an XL but truly should have probably gone with a medium."
5.0,"Vary soft and comfy fit. I have a 28inch waist and this holds up nicely. Deffinatly can accommodate a larger size. Alot of the poof is at the base of this petticoat, which may not be the desired shape depending on what skirt your useing. The bow is removable."
5.0,it is great just like the photo
5.0,I love this ring!  I am 38 and recently divorced.  It is a way to remind me to wait for the right one.  True love waits.  I have had this ring for a couple of months and have had no problems with it.  I do take it off when doing dishes and other odd ball things but it has help up well.
5.0,I ordered the gray and this sweater tank is EXACTLY as shown in the photo. Such a flattering fit and lightweight material as well. Really happy I was able to get this on sale. Such a good find
5.0,"Soft, comfortable & cute."
5.0,"i was expecting a higher quality glove, but when I to a few ropings I saw that these are the industry standard.  They hold up well, fit snuck, allow for your hands to breathe and not get the gloved soaked in sweat.  Very pleased with the product."
5.0,This top is so cute and I have received lots of compliments.
5.0,Great product. Me and my wife loved it.
5.0,"Love these!!  It is really hard to find fuzzy socks for men, and these are getting raves from my son and husband.  Great stocking stuffer, wish there were fun &#34;manly&#34; prints or stripes!"
5.0,Love the look of the shoes. But it did not fit. I have fat feet and they only had wide shoes for smaller feet why?<br />Let them know that some tall guys have big and fat feet
5.0,"Great, no nonsense skirt that is appropriate for work or school. Not too short and flares so it is a bit flirty but sublte enough to be &#34;Mom approved.&#34;<br />My daughter has been wearing this skirt with sweaters and boots, sort of the 60's look as that appears to be &#34;in&#34; again.<br />Great look for and really fair price.<br />I have several items from this store and have never been dissatisfied, so I can definitely recommend this skirt!<br />It is easy to wash and wear, doesn't wrinkle, and I bought the vlack skirt and so far, no color fading after multiple washes."
5.0,Perfect fit true size and good quality product
5.0,"These shoes WON the first day of second grade best shoes title!  There is no such thing, but they feel great, look amazing, and mothers want to know where we got them. I'll be shopping for other colors. Amazon delivery was fast and efficient. I remain a fan"
5.0,I love these socks. They are so warm though I haven't worn them by themselves. I have to wear two pairs in winter here in Michigan or my feet freeze and turn purple or white. I wish it had more than 2 pairs of socks in a package.
5.0,"I was looking for a Mets pullover that I could wear on the golf course, but when this popped up for a great price, I had to jump on it.<br />Much warmer than I expected.  It will be good for April games and maybe May night games--and hopefully October playoff games!!<br /><br />Majestic makes a good product."
5.0,This is my second item from Przewalski and they are a really great value.  Comfortable pad and excellent fit.  On par with bibs 3-4 times the price.  Make sure to order a size up than you normally would.  I am 6'4 230 pounds and the XL fits perfectly.  My only gripe is that I wish they came in all black.
5.0,This is a lovely dress! The dress can be dressed up or down to fit multiple occasions. Pros:  the fabric is heavy enough to not look cheap yet it is not too hot--I wore it on an 80 degree weather; the seams do not pucker; You can sit all day wrinkle-free; food spot cleaned with water.  Con: the label on this cream-colored dress was sewn with a black bobbin (the under thread) and at first appeared like dirt near the back neckline (a simple fix if you have basic sewing skill otherwise the fabric could rip or pull--it's time consuming in a production environment but Change the Bobbin thread for labels ).  But that's just me and I am a dressmaker so I am a bit picky.  I still give this five stars and would recommend to a friend--I got a lot of compliments at my high tea affair.
5.0,Beautiful star and I love it.
5.0,This shirt is made from that silky material so it will not be shrinking. The picture isn’t quite as clear but it’s a cool shirt. I like it.
5.0,It fits very nice.
5.0,Was perfect for my kiddo on my wedding day. Easy to read and great quality. Wish I would have bought two. The other one I got for my other kiddo was silver and much harder to read. This one was perfect ❤️
5.0,They don’t pull my daughters hair.
5.0,Just got mine in the mail today.. I LOVE IT 😍 I can’t wait to wear it...
5.0,Had more than expected! very good quality.
5.0,Very easy to enter the information.
5.0,"Super cute!!  Wearing for St. Patrick's day.  Will buy additional dresses in different prints.<br />I wear a 10 and bough L, glad I did."
5.0,Perfect water shoes
5.0,The pearls were shipped fast and they look great.  I am definitely not a pearl expert but they look great on my wife for the small price I paid.  Thanks.
5.0,"High quality, pleasant coloring, cotton.<br />Convenient and simple when clothing.<br />The granddaughter approves!"
5.0,This is very nice!  Had several compliments!!
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.  It is perfect!
5.0,"This was a gift for my son,  he loved it so much that he said that he's going to wear it every single day."
5.0,Used it for Halloween great choice.
5.0,"These beautiful earrings came so fast! They’re absolutely gorgeous! I love the way they drop off my shoulder! The quality is excellent, and they’re so glamorous! Thank you so much! Will order from the seller again!"
5.0,"I have severe claustrophobia.  Having a mask that won't collapse in on my face is vital. The fan feature in this mask, makes it much more comfortable and even pleasing to wear."
5.0,"Fast delivery and nice shirt, true to size"
5.0,Very cute. I love it. Elegant.
5.0,"I've been impressed with this hoodie. It seems well made and it looks nice. It's not super thick, so it's not for super cold days, but for mildly cooler days, it's perfect. The hoodie part is lined with yellow material, so it's thicker, but the rest isn't. The inside is somewhat of a terry cloth like material. It's not something I'd want against my skin, but my children always wear a T-shirt underneath thier hoodies(so they can take it off if it gets hot). My 8 year old has been the main wearer of this hoodie. He's loved it and though he shares clothing with his brother(that's pretty much the same size as him), he has claimed it. It fits him great. We've been pleased with it."
5.0,"This is a very sharp-looking chronograph and at 108 grams, is lighter on the wrist than one would expect, considering the size. I've had mine for over two years and it gets frequent wear."
5.0,One of my favorite long sleeve shirts Overall I would give this a 10 out of 10 I love to wear it in the summertime and snuggle in my bed
5.0,Really cool shoelaces and a perfect gift. My friend loves them!
5.0,Great study product. Holds a dozen life jackets ready to put on when you walk into the dock. Lasted all summer with no visible wear or tear.
5.0,"Not much to say about socks.  They fit, are warm and fairly soft.  Would recommend"
5.0,gorgeous great value
5.0,I found this case an excellent way to show off my glasses and sunglasses. Everyone who sees it has commented and expressed some compliment about how they displayEd. I’m happy.
5.0,Todo me agrado.
5.0,looks good. fits well. item was recieved on time and looks just like the picture. im happy with it thanks.
5.0,"I did not expect to like this ring so much. I used an online ring sizing guide to help choose the size needed and it fits perfectly. I wear this to the gym, in the shower, cleaning the house, I pretty much never take it off. I will occasionally clean it with an alcohol swab but it's not necessary. I also love the glow in the dark feature. It glows green just like in the picture the seller provided and requires no special care. If I lose this or somehow damage it, I will definitely purchase it again!"
5.0,"Nice key fob cover. Initially, it makes it a little harder to push the buttons; but after a few weeks of use it softens up."
5.0,"I have never been a huge fan of swimsuits, they always make me feel out of place. I ordered this for a vacation, hoping it would give me the confidence others did not and it was perfect! It fit amazingly and was super flattering, plus it looks just enough like a dress to be worn around before you head to the pool.<br /><br />I will note, however, I normally wear a M/L but ordered a 3X, as I expected it to run small."
5.0,Fits like a glove and is not see through. Definitely wearing this for my wedding reception.
5.0,"Great bag for stadium! No issues with NFL, no hassle at the gate.  Comfortable strap length.  I’m 5’7” and bag rested just below my hip where I like cross body bags to sit.  Hardware of the bag is durable, zipper and adjustable piece worked without issue.  I bought 4 and everyone was happy with it."
5.0,"Need to pair a size M top with size L bottoms, but it totally works and I love this suit."
5.0,"Love this item. It keeps my keys organized & allows me to just carry my fob if needed, without the extra weight of all the other keys!"
5.0,It's perfect for the price and great material thanks
5.0,"Good item, enjoyed met expectations"
5.0,Very attractive and well made—can be dressy or casual
5.0,"Great quality shirt, light weight, and holds up well in the wash."
5.0,Love them would buy again. these are very light compression
5.0,Good watch classic
5.0,Product as described. Great hat for a toddler. 2 year old loves it. Fast shipping.
5.0,Sturdy and warm. Great buy.
5.0,I don't know why i didn't buy this before. It is so convenient. I looked up tons of other options and this appeared to be a great deal. I don't regret purchasing it the quality seems great ! I love that i can slip in into my purse and carry it anywhere. Of course it hurts like hell. But that comes with exfoliating with any spring epilator. If you can tolerate the pain i suggest you buy this and save a trip to the salon.
5.0,"Perfect for my costume, I got one and so did my friend! I kept on the string because it's not big head friendly."
5.0,"First off, this stuff smells great and does an excellent job of really bringing out the beauty of the leather.  It WILL darken your leather a few shades, as you are adding oil to the surface which then soaks directly in to the leather.  It really does make the leather look and feel great!"
5.0,Great Halloween costume for my 5 year old. Good quality
5.0,totally like this swetshirt
5.0,Fantastic and so cute! Perfect for  kids learning to walk
5.0,Fit great. Don’t cut off circulation. Love them!
5.0,"love this new purse! the color is perfect for fall, the leather is super soft too!"
5.0,Beautiful dress that fits true to size and very comfortable
5.0,Nice quality for price. Ran a bit small but fit still. Looked good on stage
5.0,Love these gloves!!!!!!!! Friends liked them also. So very comfortable. Looked old which was perfect
5.0,"I'm 167cm tall, 62kg (US size 4) I ordered a medium which was unfortunately too big for me. I'm going to wait for the small in red to be back in stock as it is such a lovely dress!!"
5.0,"I love to have a little ""just running errands"" crossbody bag. This is it. Fits all your essentials. Looks, and feels great!!!"
5.0,My daughter is going to a Special Needs Prom and the dress is perfect. Thank you
5.0,this band is a great way to dress up the watch and add some additional flair
5.0,Got it for my fiancé he loves it<br />Comes with clothe to put in the inside very comfortable
5.0,I went off the other reviews to determine my size as well as measuring my foot (that was off said I should wear a 7.5 when I normally wear a 10) but based off the reviews the size 42 fit me perfectly. There were some loose strings and glue gun string but those came off easily without ruining the shoe. There was a white coloration to the strap (picture included) but came off with water and soap. So far very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Liked the material and fit.
5.0,"I’m always a bit nervous about purchasing lanyards online because so many have cheap and thin parts. Thankfully, this set isn’t cheaply made. The connector (claw opening) feels strong, and the stitching looks well-sewn. The pictures accurately show the colors. I really like that it came with additional connectors (key rings, etc…). In addition to using this around town, I plan to take it on an upcoming cruise. I’ll simply add the key ring to the oval part (where the fabric connects) to hold my key card. The fabric was a bit stiff at first and not comfortable on my neck but a quick handwash seems to have fixed that issue."
5.0,"Fits very well I am 5'6"" and weigh 185 pounds. I bra size is 40 D and I wear a size 14 pants. I bought a large and it fits prefect. It's light weight and flowy. The dress comes almost to my knees which is great since I have a 2 year old and am constantly bending down to grab him or chase him around."
5.0,"This is a gorgeous dress!! The dress has a good amount of stretch to it. Fits great. I originally purchased a large but sent it back for the medium. I am a 34dd and normally wear a 10/12 pants. Buy this dress, you won’t be disappointed"
5.0,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!
5.0,They look awesome and they don't feel heavy at all.
5.0,PERFECT FIT
5.0,These are very comfortable leggings. I'm going to get some black ones if they have them. This picture was taken on my birthday which is 8/2.
5.0,Love it. Great quality for the price. Taking her everywhere.
5.0,They’re very thin. Not much to them. Lightweight.
5.0,They fit well and are colorful.
5.0,"Adorable!! I bought it in medium and it fits great. For reference I weigh around 135lbs, 36&#34; bust."
5.0,Apparently there is a quality difference between the barrette designs.<br />These felt roses are beautiful. The metal hair clip is completely wrapped in ribbon. I'm very happy.
5.0,I was looking for something fun and different and found this. I wasn't sure I would like it...well I actually was more than pleasantly surprised as I love it! The style and material are fabulous although it is a little warm for summer days. It clings in the right places and very easy to clean. I ordered one size larger and was glad I did.
5.0,Beautiful!! My daughter was the best dressed little girl in her 1st grade x-mas performance ;))
5.0,A little thin but still great.
5.0,These are awesome it’s like wearing nothing at all. Usually wear a L ordered XL fit perfect and the pouch has plenty of room ordered another pair.
5.0,At first I thought the earring was too large but after getting a lot of attention I wore them all the time.Fun and pretty with all occasion dress- fancy or simple
5.0,Love it...great price too
5.0,It nices
5.0,I like the way it looks on me.  Lots of complement.
5.0,Beautiful dress! Gorgeous! But i has to get it hemmed because it was wayyyy too long... but my daughter is on the shorter end... still needed about 6 inches hemmed though
5.0,Daughter loved it. Very light weight. But she got warm.
5.0,"Love these! Well worth the money! People have commented that they are thin, however I love them because they are thinner then normal clothes."
5.0,"Good quality, nice color"
5.0,Amazing earrings! They don’t irritate your ears and they stay in and don’t fall out easily! I rarely write reviews but I love these!
5.0,"Very good lenses, good strong frames, fair mount to face appeal.  Very good for the money."
5.0,Got this for my nephew who just turned 3. Got a 4T fit just right.
5.0,Cute glasses. When I am going to spend a lot of time on screen I use them so I don’t get eye fatigue or headache. They work and the look very nice. The fit is comfortable too.
5.0,These are perfect
5.0,This is my second ring like this and I love it as much as the first! I broke my other one had to get a new one.
5.0,This dress is great! I bought this in Black for a semi formal event and I was able to dress this up or down. I literally just added accessories and heels then took it off and wore flats. It's not thin and great product for the cost.
5.0,"Great product, just what my son was looking for. Fast shipping. bought 2 and both were delivered on time and worked flawlessly."
5.0,Great shirt. I get a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas & he liked the quality of it & sizing was good even purchased online. Need one for myself now.
5.0,I have a 10 year old son who will not swim unless he has goggles on. The goggles you buy at the big department stores seem to last for awhile but it isn't long until they break. These fit his head and are easily adjustable.  Made of a thicker material and so far has held up well and keeps the water out of his eyes. As long as they continue to perform as well as they have I will continue to buy them.
5.0,Love love!  Sleeves are so cute and fit me fabulously!  I’m 5’6” 124 athletic build 34D and a small looks great.  I was nervous because other review say these tops are small but I bought 4 styles in small and all are spot on!
5.0,These socks are adorable!  They fit my needs perfectly!  There isn’t anything I don’t like. Will buy again 😊
5.0,"This is the best sweater / jacket I have ever owned!  It’s 30 degrees and snowing today, and it’s all I need!  Super soft, extremely well made, and very warm."
5.0,Gave it to my niece for Christmas and was surprised at how great the quality is!
5.0,Love the length and fabric. Fits well.
5.0,Mi esposa quedo feliz!
5.0,My granddaughter was thrilled with this and reports it keeps her nice and dry and that is all I have.
5.0,"Excellent value, I love the colors."
5.0,Arrived on time. Love these sunglasses.
5.0,"I now have several of the scarves from the seller &#34;niceeshop(TM)&#34; and I love them all. The fabric is a nice quality, not flimsy or scratch. The color dyes are vibrant and rich. They are long enough and wide enough to wear several ways. I'm a scarf junkie and wear them year round, so I have quite a collection. I will no doubt purchase more from this shop!"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful !!!! A definite must for your wardrobe. You will love it too 🙂
5.0,"Love it! Great quality for the price, pretty neckline, flowy fit. Yay!"
5.0,"I love the asymmetry to this dress, it is very flattering and can double for business or night life wear.  I bought the black with the red belt version.  The patchwork is unique and I have not seen many dresses like this before. You would just have to take off the belt and change your shoes and you can get a completely different look. The belt comes wrapped separately so you can choose to wear it or not.<br />I ordered the size that I usually wear and it fits just perfect and it is easy to zipper up the back.  It is fairly light weight without being too thin and of course you can add a cardigan or a jacket to it in the cooler months.<br />It is very comfy and I can wear it all day long, as long as you wash this dress on gentle, it should last a long time as it seems well made. I absolutely love it and am so happy with my purchase."
5.0,This was a great accessory that really helped pull off the outfit for my wife.  It was a bit tough to the get clasp tight enough to secure it to my wrist.  It needs to be very snug due to the weight of it.
5.0,"Wow! Colors bright, could wear with just a bra but I'll wear a tank. Very pretty"
5.0,The quality and workmanship of these earrings are everything I have been looking for with this particular clip back  I have had a lot of trouble losing earrings until I found this particular back. Not any more!!
5.0,My thirteen year son loved it
5.0,"Perfect size, love this bag!"
5.0,Nice product and great heavy material
5.0,Love them. Right size. Pretty. Can be a nice every day pair.
5.0,Swatch is guarantee of quality and excellent design
5.0,Very cute and fits true to size. Good quality shirt. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Great buy, great quality, great fit! All around I'm super happy with this hat."
5.0,Watch received in good condition. Very nice. Thank you.
5.0,These are very soft against the skin.  They are very warm.  The pockets in the bottoms are nice and deep.  I could wear these all day.
5.0,This Ralph Lauren did not disappoint.....shipped on a hanger in a garment bag  ! My Wife is 5’3”....134 pounds....size medium was perfect.  This is an amazing Amazon Find!<br />Buy Before they are Sold Out!
5.0,"Sure, it's not super fancy or amazing quality, but I think the price reflects that. It's one of my favorite necklaces and I wear it all the time! The cord is adjustable, the pendant isn't lightweight or cheap/flimsy by any means--it's sturdy. I love it!"
5.0,Loved it. Perfect gift for a young female. Great price and fast ship!
5.0,"I received quite a few compliments on this dress. Love the durable, stretchy material. I'm 125lbs and 5'2&#34;. I usually wear a dress size 4, but I ordered a medium, and it fits perfectly."
5.0,"I have been a professional singer and musician for many years and I have tried several different bags/cases in my quest to contain my flute, Irish whistles and other associated items when on the road. I just received the Case Logic Sport(standard size)Backpack with flute storage. It is quite roomy, well organized as far as pockets are concerned and seems sturdy. It is well padded, appears to have good zippers and firm stitching.<br />My French style flute case fits the designated pocket, with room enough to spare, for a flute stand.<br />My Irish flute roll & 6 whistles fit into the laptop compartment.<br />There is also plenty of room in the remaining pockets for tuners, important papers, there are ink pen holders etc. etc. I see only one possible drawback for a very small group of potential purchasers:<br />If you were to need to transport a ""low whistle"" or wooden flute that does not break down into two or more pieces; they would have to be transported in another manner. This backpack isn't long enough.<br />I am certain that this bag will be a God send for me when I am bouncing between theatres and festivals this summer.<br />I am very pleased with this purchase. Shipping from Musician's Friend was SUPER FAST. Awesome bag. Awesome service."
5.0,I sent these to my daughters and granddaughters. They said they loved them and they look more expensive than what I paid. I just ordered one for my grandson as well.
5.0,"I love this for my aerobics class , comfortable. Came looking for another but dont care for the colors"
5.0,Muy buena calidad y muy bonito
5.0,"Got these for a group event as a Retro Ski theme night. The glasses were a hit, many compliments given to the group, and people wanted to try them on / want them for themselves. Super fun and easy way to dress up your group in costume! Items are as shown and well packaged. Could be snug on bigger heads (males). But overall good quality - lasted a whole night out for everyone."
5.0,"Loved how it fit but unless you tie ankle tight, sand will get in MINIMALLY. It wasn’t a boatload but it wasn’t as bad as other shoes I’ve purchased. Worth the price"
5.0,I love this skirt and have received many compliments on it. Fits true to size I ordered a small.
5.0,"Wash inside out and light dry, so color does not bleed"
5.0,Daughter loved it as I made a superwoman outfit out of a patch and red tutu.
5.0,Suggest buying 3x the size your kid wears in american clothes.
5.0,We got this for the grand baby and they look great on her.
5.0,nice fabric and beautiful design
5.0,There’s good arch support and a spot that’s molded where the bottom of your toes go onto your foot if that makes sense. Stylish. I’ve gotten many compliments on the shoes you can wear them with casual or dress up
5.0,"Gorgeous color, quality leather, well-made. It has plenty of pockets on both the inside and the outside. I just wish it had a larger exterior pocket without a zipper. The shorter handle is still long enough to fit over my shoulder, which puts the bag securely under my elbow instead of flopping around when I walk, like bags with longer straps do."
5.0,They hold so much stuff.  Wow.
5.0,I love the colors and the style
5.0,SO CUTE!!!
5.0,"Love it , I use as protection of my neck when doing snorkel and for sun protection of my ears and neck while on the beach  , also when running . My wife love it aswell.<br /><br />Saludos,<br /><br />Juan Paz"

5.0,No snuge
5.0,I love these earrings! Honestly for the price I don’t have a complaint!
5.0,Definitely worth the $ ... stylish!
5.0,"She loved them, everyone thought they were really cool how they fit and have the illusion of going through the actual earlobe."
5.0,Gift to best friend
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ed83e7c2bb7b1a4c220c4744196e6120]] Was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Unlike some other shells, this has two layers of material. As you can see in the associated photo, around the arms and front of the body it's a double layer of the outside material and then the back is a single layer + mesh lining. As you can see in the associated video, the water beads up and runs off nicely, my arm felt very dry.<br /><br />The size medium would be a snug fit for someone who wears a 38R suit jacket."
5.0,"I can't believe I have the same watch now as I did in grade school. It's a classic, it's cheap, and it works. I still covet the one with the calculator, but nah, this is a better deal. Loving it."
5.0,"Don’t care for how it looked on me, pattern was a little ehh fit well though"
5.0,Love John Wayne!
5.0,Needed this for EMT training. Works well & has been resistant to water so far
5.0,"The best thing I can say about this bracelet is that it looks exactly like the picture provided here.  The colors are nice and it seems quite durable from what my wife has told me.  Both the gold plated and black rope portion of the bracelet look nice and the crystals and gems look nicer than I'd expect for the price point this bracelet is at.  I like the way it looks and more importantly so does my wife, which is all that matters to me!<br /><br />Overall this is a nice piece of jewelry and is highly recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review."
5.0,"I bought a Fitbit watch a while back which I love. The original band was a pretty pale pink silicone.  Unfortunately, I learned I have a bit of an allergy to silicone.  I ordered a couple different types of watch bands, but these were the best. Material is some type of nylon with velcro straps on one side which makes it so easy to adjust tightness. Easy to change out the watch bands to. Overall.....great find!!"
5.0,"I’m sure this band was meant for vintage watches with compact lug-to-lug dimensions, because on my eight inch wrist with a modern 42mm watch I use the second to smallest adjustment hole for a semi-loose fit. I’m confident this could fit a 10 inch wrist on the right watch. That being said it is great quality, looks great and has held up great for the couple of weeks I’ve used it! I’m also happy that it came with its own spring bars, they seem decent quality when switching between this band an a NATO that I often go between."
5.0,"These masks are extremely comfortable, lightweight, and yet makes me feel very safe. It is not irritating to the skin, and does not make me have a sore throat even if I wear it 10 hours straight. Thank you for a very well-made product."
5.0,This MIRRAMOR natural stone ring is lovely. I chose the lapis as it is my favorite stone. Nice wide band that looks great on my hand. Larger rings always look better on my hands. Very comfortable to wear and definitely fits true to size. Love this ring.
5.0,"I love this dress so much that I keep ordering it again in different colors. The basic A-line is pretty and flattering and basic enough that people don't notice that it's the same dress because I can change out the accessories I wear with it. The material is heavy enough that it doesn't cling unflatteringly, but not too heavy to be unbearable in the summer heat. The skirt has the perfect amount of fabric without needing any crinoline underneath. The neckline does come up kind of high, but not uncomfortably so. I have the royal blue and the fabric is shiny enough that people have thought it was silk; I also have the green and black geometric and the pattern is so classy and interesting. I always got tons of compliments when I wear either.<br /><br />One word of caution: you will need to be high-waisted to wear it and have it fit well. I am 5'8&#34;, 147 pounds, and the Large fits perfectly after that first wash (note: do NOT dry in the dryer; hang dry and then iron). The dress comes right to my knees so I can see someone shorter needing to have it taken up."
5.0,Perfect leg warmers
5.0,Loveddddddddddd it; thank you sooooo much❤️❤️
5.0,"I found it a little tight which I thought was funny because another reviewer said it runs a little big!  The headband is elastic and I expect it will loosen a little as it breaks in, and according to a fedora I bought at Wally World I have a L to XL hat size.  When snug on my head the ear covers come right to the bottoms of my earlobes and the fleece material feels very plush and comfortable on the ears.  Nice everyday hat!"
5.0,Super cute and came in a nice zip lock bag protected with tissue paper.
5.0,"This bag is better than expected! So cute & pretty spacious, bigger than I thought it would be. It looks really nice & is made well."
5.0,good quality.pretty as picture

5.0,Super cute and fast shipping.
5.0,"It isn't lined, so wear a slip. But, it's comfy!"
5.0,"I wear a 13 , It was a lil loose but was comfortable"
5.0,This dress is beautiful!! Recieved so many compliments and I felt great in it!! Wish I had more occasions to wear this.
5.0,This thing is really workin' for me. Small with a strong spring so I don't have to worry about it falling off.
5.0,Thank you for fast shipment and good price.
5.0,I got this for a show which took place in the fifties and it was perfect!
5.0,Perfect for what's needed

5.0,I LOVE IT SO MUCH. MY HUSBAND TO AND HAD ME ORER 2 MORE..)
5.0,"Great for the price, might need a friend to help you get them on, but friends are good for ya!"
5.0,"So many compliments. Easy wear, no iron needed (unless you ball up the dress). Works for last minute dressing events."
5.0,"I get cold very easily so I was looking for something that would keep my entire body warm, and this jacket did just that! It's the perfect length to keep my legs warm without having it seem too large.<br /><br />The material is so soft and warm, it feels so comfortable to wear. It's a winter closet necessity!"
5.0,"Exceeded my expectations in every way. True to size, really soft, looks more luxurious than the photo, and is really comfortable.  Got multiple compliments on it within minutes of walking out the door. This one is a keeper. I did note that it requires hand washing, so just know that before purchase. I LOVE it."
5.0,I love this!  It sparkles and shines. I actually bought it to hang from the rearview mirror in my car. It makes me smile every time I look at it.
5.0,Better than expected! Expands easily without losing shape. Love it!
5.0,I loved everything about the dress! It fit my daughter perfectly! Nice summer dress!
5.0,Great dress for prenatal wear. I can’t wait to wear it after the baby comes.

5.0,Love this shirt!!
5.0,I use these daily and when I wear them I can't even feel them on.
5.0,qeuvik and beautiful
5.0,"I am very, very happy with these socks. My doctor requires me to wear compression socks, but most medical grade compression socks are expensive ($30 - $60 per pair) and come in very basic colors: plain black, plain blue, plain white, and often are not high enough to go over the calf, so they slide down. These socks provide solid graduated compression (20-30mmHg) that I really feel. They are comfortable, go completely over the calf (so they stay put), and have a great design. Absolutely unbelievable at this price. I bought 3 pairs and will definitely buy more."
5.0,Great colors and quality!
5.0,Pretty cool.  The hat is of good quality.  The advent strap is fabric and comfortable.
5.0,They are great water shoes. They aren’t comfortable but that’s sorta the point. They’re minimal lightweight and can even be rolled up.
5.0,Excellent quality and price.
5.0,I really like the pouch. I should have gotten it a little larger. Still love the pouch though.
5.0,They were shoes for my grand daughter and she loves them.
5.0,It is a great summer T….

5.0,I got this present for my roommate and she f*cking loves them.
5.0,Perfect design and  size i wear them most every day.

5.0,My favorite set of plugs! Awesome quality for price. They fit great.
5.0,Will use it this weekend
5.0,"Paired with a crop top, it's adorable. The buttons are annoying to do everytime i wanna take them off or put them on, but I like the look of them. The material is really nice, I just over all really like them :)"
5.0,"Highly recommend, the fit is perfect and little long but I'm tall so I like it. They are stretchy and perfect for sleep or even day to day wearing. I ordered grey and black. Whish there were more colors, I'd buy them all!!!"
5.0,"They are very cute! The cat was a little larger than I expected, but it's better.<br />Can't wait to give them as gifts."
5.0,just as good as what you pay triple for in stores
5.0,Good Deal!
5.0,"LOVE this dress! Knee length, shape is perfectly flattering, and it washed up well."
5.0,"I LOVE these sunglasses, I got them for my husband because he has a hard time finding sunglasses he likes. These are perfect, they’re cute and a tough material. We love all the accessories that came with them, which you’ll see from the pictures. These are great!"
5.0,Very pretty but a bit short to be a dress unless you order a size larger
5.0,this is a lovely nightgown that launders well and my 5 year old wears almost every night to bed!!
5.0,Super Elegant!
5.0,I bought these for my husband and brother-in-law since they are big fans of the Blues Brothers movie.  I feel they are a quality for the price.  Both pairs survived a week-long beach vacation and occasional wear after that.
5.0,Bought as a present she loves them
5.0,"Very comfortable and they dont cause my glasses to,fog up like other masks"
5.0,"Love it, very pretty.  Got the Lotus-purple color, very close to screen image.  Cracks me up how the tag says 100% silk feeling."

5.0,"My wife loved it, chain was a bit thinner than we would have liked, but still a good buy."
5.0,I bought a large based on the size chart.  I needed a small.  Had to send back. The suit seemed well made and quality materials.  Unfortunately I dis not get to use it
5.0,"Loved it. Cotton, soft, comfortable, fit perfectly."
5.0,Looks just like the pictured item and is comfortable to wear!
5.0,This fits like a dream. I was unsure at first about how high the pockets seem but I love this jacket. I can put my cellphone in my pocket and even bend over and it wont fall out. It's not heavy but it cuts the wind well. Amazing price.
5.0,The socks are super cute! Bought them as a gift and she loved them!
5.0,So cute I ordered one for my other granddaughter!
5.0,Even better than the picture on line
5.0,Comfortable and beautiful
5.0,"Very well-made!  Material, stitching and lining are all very high quality. Thick material, great stitches & the torso lining is fantastic. The only thing I would like better about this dress is if it were a wrinkle-free or wrinkle-resistant fabric but you can’t buy a dress that’s almost all cotton and expect it not to wrinkle. Received many compliments...wore a light pink petticoat underneath."
5.0,"This jacket so fit the bill.  I ordered one and loved it so much I bought two more in different colors.  It's light, yet warm. Soft as silk on the inside, and you feel hugged when you put it on. It is a true size, so a small fit me to a T. Lovely semi deep pockets, silver zipper that flows with ease, and there's a color in the chart for everyone. I'm so weary of down jackets now that February is here. Now, I have something to wear as the days become a tad warmer and I don't need six layers!  It's a steal. Get several.  Love all three of mine tons."
5.0,Fit perfect and beautiful!
5.0,Is it a cheaper watch? yes. does it look beautiful? Yes. Do you have to maintain it like any other Automatic watch? Yes. I recommend checking the back plate occasionally to prevent water from getting on the inside. I had that happen once.
5.0,"I got a Small. I’m 5’1, 108 lbs. it fits great. Loved it."
5.0,"I already sent you my review,  this is a duplicate if what I completed for you  A beautiful crafted key chain"
5.0,This is a great hoody for providing medium warmth. It has a classic style and it is lined with comfortable fleece. The cuffs are elastic and the hood has a drawstring. There are hand warming pockets.
5.0,"This fit great and was very pretty. Amazing for the price, very comfortable and I loved the sparkles."
5.0,i love this dress. it's very comfortable and fresh. this fit is perfect. it wasn't too long or too short... at first it was a but long but after the first wash and dry it shrunk a bit and fit perfectly..<br />the length was perfect and there was no need to cut off extra fabric... I ordered a small and I am 5'1&#34; weight 120
5.0,Haven't wore this as yet I bought it for my birthday weekend outfit I knw exactly how I'm going to hook it up I will definately send the finishing pic .
5.0,Fits well. Appropriate length and still cute
5.0,"I’m 5’9” 200lbs and out of shape. I bought size large and it fits snug, which is good for my intended purpose of use. It’s easier to put on than to take off.  Size up if your arms are not limber and think removing it would be an issue for you. For the short time that I’ve had the Vest I would say its good quality. I’ve actually been using it as my inexpensive wetsuit vest for surfing, $$ saving “surf hack”. Simple, surf logo big brand Neoprene vests in surf shops cost $50+. I Previously bought a similar sauna vest from the big blue retail chain store for twice the price and the neoprene and construction was not as good In comparison."
5.0,these have really intrigued my friend and the people I bought these for. . very detailed and stronger then they look but still delicate
5.0,Love love love.. And they r so comfortable.
5.0,"Product is fine, works as expected."

5.0,Bought for myself but my son saw these socks and fell in love with them. He has big kid shoe size 3 and it's a perfect  fit.
5.0,"They keep my sunglasses in place as I ride. The ""no tail"" design is comfortable, not having anything block the fit of my helmet. Perspiration isn't a issue either. The grip on the arms of my sunglasses stays tight with no slipping."
5.0,Super cute and overall a well-made pin :D
5.0,this product was for my motorcycle vest--worked out great--good looking too.
5.0,bought this for the 50's day costume at my daughter's school. she says they were easy to wear and they looked really cute.
5.0,Fit great and quality was excellent
5.0,Beautiful color and perfect fit! I love it! It's a gorgeous unique design which sets it apart from other sports bra.
5.0,"The product is soft, stretchy, and has pockets. I did not like the fit at first since the bottom was longer than I would like and the top part wasn’t fitting as I would like it to be. I washed it and that seemed to help the fit. I got xl and it was a little bit on the top but the bottom fit nicely. Again I would like the dress to be more knee length. I would highly suggest this dress to really tall people. I’m 5’6."
5.0,"This accessory is very elegant and versatile. It makes for a great gift. Honestly, it was little big for the phone, but I used it on my bag and it looked excellent.<br />High quality product well recommended 👍"
5.0,"These were cute and fit good, I am a 10-12 ,5'2 150lbs & ordered the L. The colors are as pictured. Good bum coverage and true high waist but not tight for any tummy control . I returned due to a different top I ordered didn't match. So for the price & fit it's a yes, but keep in mind I did not get them wet."
5.0,They were uncomfortable!
5.0,Perfect for a New Years party! I will probably wear it again next year! Great fit and feel
5.0,So far its everything that was advertised... really good quality product.

5.0,I took this shoe also to Costa Rica and hiked from the mountains to the beach. Great shoe.
5.0,Great accessory
5.0,These are adorable shoes and the sizing was right on!  It is so difficult to find the right size shoe for a baby :)  I love the rose gold color!

5.0,Just as described .. great service
5.0,"Love these! I use them to secure pins to my leather jacket and my hiking day pack. They hold the pins on through a lot of wear and tear, including airport security and hard climbs/hikes."
5.0,"My one daughter normally wears a size 10 so I ordered her a size 140. My other daughter wears a size 6 so I bought her a size 110.  Both fit perfectly, she is very comfortable in it. It is made with very soft and not tight material.  Very happy with it. Price is amazing for the quality."
5.0,"Love these shades the second I put them on! They're comfortable and the fit is just right. The oversized shape is not too big for the shape of my face and not too bulky in my handbag. Of course, the price is amazing! I've spent a lot more on shades before and wasn't happy. This one is a keeper!"
5.0,"These are the best legging I have ever bought, I bought one pair off of amazon and went back and bought 3 more pairs. The quality is high. I was looking for crop leggings, theses are suppose to be mid calf but I am about 5'0, 130 pounds and they are perfect as crop leggings, just above my ankle. I ordered them in a size medium, I also work out in them very often, they do not fall down and are HIGH quality. they are not see through in anyway. the best cost and quality option around!"
5.0,"As a diabetic I cannot travel light. Besides the usual items, I must carry diabetic supplies. This includes insulin in a cool carry bag using cold packs. As such my carry on is heavy. I used this this on my carry on bag and it was perfect. I was able to pull my bag with out stressing my hand, wrist or arm. On arrival back home I linked my check in bag and carry on together and the handle made this load easy to handle. I will not travel again without this marvelous device."
5.0,Many compliments.
5.0,"As I am constantly reminded by my four year old granddaughter that her favorite colors are pink, purple and yellow AND she just started gymnastics this was a no brainer. I ordered the purple and it is a very rich color, not blue but true purple. She also loves anything with glitter, so that added to the happiness quotient.  The fit was perfect. She is long in the trunk is 4 1/2 years old and slim. She has a pink one so I guess the hunt for a yellow one is in order. Make her happy...give her the glitter!"
5.0,Best amazing purchase I made all year! Amazing material and fit like a glove!
5.0,"This watch is an inexpensive, great quality, visually appealing, and good performing stunner! This is my second watch from Pagani Design. I've owned this one for about 2 weeks now. I regulated the movement myself as soon as I got it.  I can't remember the error out of the box, but it was actually pretty close to being spot on and only needed a minor tweak. The lume is only okay, not great, but for a watch of this style it's more than adequate. The looks are amazing. Visually very appealing and looks way more expensive than it is. The cyclops seems to have good magnification and makes the date easily readable. I think this is a great little watch, not just ""for the money"", but something that I will actually enjoy for quite some time I'm sure."
5.0,It is very pretty and the fit is good
5.0,Excellent fit; just what I ordered and wanted.
5.0,"Great sox, keeps it shape when washed and they are warm."
5.0,"Excellent, would buy again. Recipient said it was &#34;like wearing a muppet&#34; on her feet."
5.0,"This is a very cool bag.  It opens up in order to put many bulky things inside or when empty, slims down very nicely.  The buckles, belts and materials are all top quality.  Great for daily use.  I was looking for more of a hiking backpack but this will do for now."
5.0,Shirt is amazing
5.0,Beautiful ring! Very shiny!
5.0,Very nice material<br />Sun Protection<br />Breathable<br /><br />I am a mail carrier that works under the Sun in Florida so i know when i say this a good product.
5.0,"Fit my daughter perfectly, they don't quiet hit her ankle, but shes long legged and wears a 14 in girls. They look really cute hitting just above her ankle."
5.0,Loving my new socks! My legs feel less achy after standing for a shift at work. Definitely going to purchase a few more :)
5.0,I got to wear the other day and it was a little cool.  My hoodie was perfect.  Very comfortable.

5.0,"Thin material, but really really nice pants.<br />  Fit perfectly.<br />I’m 5”3 180 and got the xl.<br />They are so comfortable.<br /> I wish they would have dark black so I could by a few as my work pants.<br /> They look expensive, but very reasonable.<br /> Great pants🥳"
5.0,"Size was perfect, colors were bright, and most important my daughter loved it!"
5.0,Love these tops.  Already bought 3.  They are great with leggings and jeans.
5.0,"I ordered one in black and another in brown. They're just what I needed. They're very comfortable, readily adjustable, and not overpriced like so many others. They didn't sacrifice good quality for low price, which I'm even more delighted about. I should have bought them years ago!"
5.0,I bought these for my 10 year old daughter who is learning to cook and bake. She loves helping me in the kitchen. These give me the peace of mind that I need and allow her to learn by doing. They work well. I'm happy with my purchase!
5.0,"Nice little watch. Fits my small female wrist. Light only comes from one side of display, but is adequate. Great deal for the very small price."
5.0,"I have just discovered this lovely gem of a sock company called Kold Feet and I must say I'm a new fan for sure. I already own a few pairs and have plans to expand the collection as they offer a great variety of style & design to select from. I currently have the high length winter socks, ankle length and these low cut athletic socks. These low cut socks are made of 68% Polyester, 26% Cotton, 4% Spandex & 2% Nylon. The description states there's channels stitched on the bottom to allow air to move around the foot more easily. That's interesting to know as I originally thought it was to offer flex to accommodate movement better as that's how they feel. However they are also cool enough where they don't sweat too much so I believe the channels do their job. The heels & soles offer good cushion for anti blisters, there's a y seam at the heel so the sock conforms to the foot well and not slide off & the toes are sewn stich by stitch & reinforced for a flat look & durability.  There's no bulkiness or bunching up but a smooth toe line. I love the sparkling trims at the ankle, makes them  aesthetically pleasing. Kold Feet offers great quality socks at affordable prices which is what initially drew me to the brand. The socks are well made with no loose threading, excellent stitching & very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend these socks and for everyone to check out the brand."
5.0,My daughters favorite color is yellow which led us to these. Grateful for the options. Fast shipping and product works well.
5.0,Bought these gloves for my sister and she said she loves them.  They have the touch screen fingers and they are warm but not too bulky.
5.0,Love ❤️  it
5.0,"5' & 110# ordered a small, true to size, and fits perfect aside from the hem which fell 2 inches below my knees. It was an easy fix. Definitely recommend this dress"
5.0,"Love it! I will be shipping this gorgeous skirt off to a friend as a gift, but I am so tempted to keep it for myself even though I could use a smaller size. Sooo nice. It looks like it will fit her nicely, but I can't be absolutely sure until she receives it and tries it on. I tried it on and it comes down to the top of my feet, which is hard to find for someone who is nearly 5' 8"" tall."
5.0,Fantastic for the price. I would buy again.
5.0,I gave these to my granddaughter. She is infatuated with Disney Princesses. She loved them and immediately declared one as her favorite. As a proud grandfather I think she looks beautiful in all of them.
5.0,"Great product, durable!"
5.0,"Great material, fits Perfect! Good looking shirt."

5.0,I LOVE THIS JACKET. Goes with so many outfits!! Great buy for the price.
5.0,"Using this dress for a wedding I will be in. Its a liiiiiitle tight around my midsection, and its very long (Ill need to get it hemmed a couple inches), but the rest fit flawlessly. Its very flattering! Nice and flowy."
5.0,Fits great looks great very nice jacket. Much better than expected. Would definitely recommend
5.0,Good leather. I’ve been using this belt over a year now for my work belt and it has been doing a great job. I must say I’m think about buy another. I’d recommend it
5.0,I wear this for working it holds my iPhone XR! Love it
5.0,"These caps are extremely comfortable, they are optimal thickness.  I love the ear saver buttons and the sweat band other inside. Beautifully made. I highly recommend."
5.0,Arrived on time and is exactly as expected!  Can't wait for her to open it up on Christmas day!
5.0,"I took a gamble on this dress and I'm so happy that I did.  I'm 5""2  in the 200 range with a modest boob size and generous hispanic booty and am working on losing weight. I ordered a size xl. I know it's listed as a nightie, but this dress could easily be a casual dress for going out or even date night.  I love the detail on the bottom; it reminds me of a flower bud, blooming.  The dress comes to around my knees. The elastic at the waist is comfortable and this dress really makes me feel pretty and feminine.<br />If you're thinking about it, give it a go!<br />I'm happy that I did."
5.0,"Great, comfortable boots.  Excellent support with great heel stability, support, and resiliency. Perfect for inclimate weather."

5.0,"Omg, this thing is amazing. I was super skeptical but it reallllly works!!"
5.0,"Dudes, I did good this Valentine’s Day for my husband with this shirt. Shout out to the fast delivery and amazing quality. The only problem I’m going to have is getting it off of him to wash it."
5.0,"If you want the feeling of being wrapped in a piece of fleece heaven, this is it! I live in a colder climate and it's a must-have! The only thing that would make this better is having five of them."
5.0,This product is fantastic! It’s exactly what I needed to wear under dresses and hold everything in a little better!
5.0,Better than I expected. bright colors. Love the length
5.0,Perfect for our teams at work.
5.0,I am using these for muay thai and kickboxing training. I was worried they would be too tight in the crotch area but they fit pretty nice around the huge flappy boys.
5.0,As described and fit my son great!
5.0,Having been to the Big Cat Rescue facility in Florida I had to have this bracelet. Pretty in person and Big Cat Rescue will send you an email on how to preserve the shine of your beads.
5.0,Adorable! So soft and comfy and he looked adorable. I completed it with a bow tie. One of the comfiest dress up outfits my little one has.
5.0,"I bought this dress for a casino themed work event and it was such a hit! I got compliments all night from coworkers! The fit was fantastic. I’m pretty busty (40F) and carry a lot of my weight in my midsection but this dress made me feel fantastic! The only downside to this dress is the sequins around the arm can be scratchy but when you buy a sequin dress you should expect that. Overall, love this dress and can’t wait to wear it again!"
5.0,"I purchased this as a replacement for one lost to a teething puppy. It is as described and I am pleased with the product. My 7 year old daughter’s review is, “I love how it’s rainbowy and feels fluffy soft. It’s the right size so it doesn’t like weigh down your backpack because it’s so light.”"
5.0,"I got them to store my shoes,  they keep clean and fresh."
5.0,Just like the picture!

5.0,"Love it.  Good looking, practical and sturdy."
5.0,Easy to use and put on. Fits perfectly!
5.0,My DIL loved it...beautifully made.
5.0,"I like to make prosthetic noses and such for special effect makeup.  This stuff is great for flesh colored prosthetics. It blends very well and with a bit of moisturizer, can be very easily sculpted. Without lotion or another type of moisturizer, this can be slightly sticky and gummy and hard to deal with. It comes off easily when you're finished and can be used again and again (at least I do! :~D)"
5.0,"I tried it out on a 11miles run at 80 degree weather and it was perfect! Keep the sweat away from my body, didnt heat up my body which was a concern when i ordered it on black. The fit is excellent. I order it larger than needed since i dont like tight shirt when running. My roommate at 6' and 170 the M was perfect compression shirt for him. Goes well with the compression 3/4 runnning leggings. The fabric is amazingly soft and no friction due to the seam being done well. The details are on point."
5.0,"Comfortable, not flimsy, strong colors, really good deal for all of these bands"
5.0,Awesome. Comfortable. Holds weight really well
5.0,i'm usually picky when it comes to sports bras because i'm on the smaller side so many styles don't fit well with me. these ones fit perfectly and are super comfy
5.0,lovely feel and color
5.0,"Four year old son LOVES it! Vibrant colors, good material, sewed together well. Have had NO issues."
5.0,"Wonderfully packaged. 13 days for delivery, Not too bad coming from China Item exactly as seller described. I hope to do business with this seller again! Thank You! These slippers are extremely adorable, & very well made. They are listed as baby/toddler. But they are only slightly large on my 3 month old niece. I'd estimate them to be sized for 6-12 month old babies. In their description, they said, you'll get 5 pairs, we have a wide verity of styles, the picture only shows part of the styles. I really only wanted the rainbow elephants, because the mother of the baby I was buying them for collects elephants. So I bought 2 sets, thinking out of 10 pair, one would have to be the elephants! NO, just not my luck! I got 4 pairs of rabbits, 2 sets of bees, 2 pairs of ducks, & 2 sets of frogs. Oh well, like I said, they are cute, & they will get used. & Baby's Mom won't be disappointed because I didn't tell her there was an option of elephants! I received this product for free or discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Disclaimer"
5.0,Just as lovely as any of the high-priced beads!
5.0,Fidel cap excellent. Service excellent. Deliver fast. Highly recommended
5.0,"way better than anticipated, i’m a nail tech and i bought them for nail piercings. one came bent but that’s no biggie. also they don’t come separated i hand organized them"
5.0,This is the cutest dress fit great
5.0,Soft material and looks great.  I ordered a total of 3!
5.0,This scarf is shockingly nice for the price. It’s by far the softest scarf I have ever purchased. I will be ordering more colors.
5.0,Very thin and small but it looks nice on my wife’s pandora bracelet
5.0,"I love this! I was getting so frustrated with my glasses. They just kept fogging up unless I have them right under my eye which can become uncomfortable after a while. It’s mandatory for us to use mask, so while shopping I would have to just try and see through the fog. But these work and are so helpful. I’m planning on buying a couple more to keep in my bags and the car."
5.0,I was constantly catching my diamond on things and scratching children by accident.  These will prevent that and I will not fear ripping off my finger if the band gets caught.  I ordered my normal size and it's perfect.
5.0,These masks fits very well.  They are soft and comfortable and also have adjustable ear elastics. Copper is also suppose to help kill germs.
5.0,Exactly what I expected. The quality is good and I would buy them again.
5.0,i love and is very nice
5.0,Everything I needed in one package.  Dress was was very made and and the accessories complemented it well.  Even included fish net pantyhose.  I was very pleased with purchase.
5.0,These are a little big on my 4 yr old but she is small for her age. Nice & light. Sizing is just right. Would definitely order again. She is only 30 lbs.
5.0,I love these jammies. They are super comfortable - the material is soft and loose fitting but there isn't so much fabric that they get caught up or twisted while in bed. The top doesn't seem to have a tag indicating back vs front which is fine since its boxy and comfortable anyway. I love the cuff around the ankle as well. I would definitely buy these again.
5.0,Shirts fit as expected. Prompt service and reasonable prices.
5.0,Exactly what I ordered looks good and right color
5.0,I bought them as a fun gift. Do not know about the lens being of any quality. I bought them because they were pink and heart shaped and to be used as a costume accessory.
5.0,Really tiny print but I know what it says and isn't that the idea?
5.0,Very pretty necklace.I purchased for my 5year old for her birthday and she loves it.she really loves that it has her initial would definitely recommend and I will order from this seller again
5.0,I am 5’9” and 165 pounds. I found the large was perfect. This dress is so cute! Light T-shirt material makes it a casual dress for a summer date night. I couldn’t resist a little twirl - did not disappoint!
5.0,Awesome I was a little nervous due to a recent review I had seen posted on the glasses on amazon.. recieved them today and the were 100%authentic certification and all ..! I wear dita avocet and I loved the mach ones
5.0,I love this card wallet . It is the perfect size and easily fits several cards into it plus reward cards . It was a great purchase!
5.0,Sooo cool and perfect
5.0,Absolute best tie I ever purchased. Non-stop compliments from people. (Doesn't hurt that orange is my favorite color). Feels like every other tie I own in quality terms and looks amazing.
5.0,They are very soft and will make the perfect gift
5.0,"Finally I found some stuff on amazon that is not that polyester material. This is a very stretchy cool feeling cotton/nylon material. I am 5'6 , around 175 lbs. I wear a size 10 in jeans. I have bigger legs and butt. I ordered a size XL because I wanted the nice flowy look nothing super tight. It fit just how I wanted. I could have fit a large but it would have given the same effect for the looser more casual look. The off the shoulder on this looks really cute also to hide bigger arms!"
5.0,This is a great item! Just the perfect space and comfortable to wear.
5.0,"I got this for commuting by bike, wanting something that would let body heat out and prevent rain from getting in. Fit both bills. Plus, it is a good-looking jacket--sleeker than the puffy picture suggests."
5.0,I absolutely love the color of this shirt and it is so stretchy and comfortable to wear! I have gotten so many compliments on it and love to wear it! Highly recommend!!! It is amazingly comfortable to wear all day long!
5.0,Perfect size and quality; Modest. I LOVE THEM!!!

5.0,very soft. love it.
5.0,They kept the sand and rocks out while protecting his feet. The sole is the perfect thickness.
5.0,"I bought this hat for running because i wanted something fresher for my head and i just loved and the color is super bright im sure i will be seen now, i will buy more neon colors specifically this brand. Very pleased with the hat."

5.0,Perfect! Looks great frontwards or backwards. Fit is perfect.
5.0,"I love majority of the dresses from this company and plan to opurchase many more. This dress is comfortable and so stylish. LOVE IT! Even though I'm tall (5'9), this dress still is professional enough for work and is long enough for me not to worry about showing too much. All the dresses I've purchased from this company have been WONDERFUL so I'm planning to buy so many more from them."
5.0,Great buy for the money. Love the pockets.
5.0,"Great item,<br />My grandson loved them.<br />Super fast shipping.  👍👍👍👍"
5.0,It is beautiful! Totally worth the money. I have been getting nothing but compliments from everybody. I bought 1 for myself and 2 more as gifts and the people that recieved them are equally in love with the necklace as I am.
5.0,Very nice quality and fit!
5.0,Fits great and keep my legs happy during my 12 hour shifts. I'm 5'7&#34;/145 lbs and these fit perfectly.
5.0,Belt runs small (or I measured wrong). It works for what I need it for which is when I ride on my horse in parades.  The gems are sturdy I have not lost one yet after 5 wears and a horse trying to bit the gem this year.
5.0,Surprising good quality for the price! Runs about 1/2 size small and is short but I didn’t mind that. I’m 5’5 and could move around in it just make sure you don’t bend over or everything’s out for the world to see. Unfortunately had to return this because I forgot I ordered a similar dress online that I couldn’t return.. I wish I could have kept this one over that one though. The other was much more expensive and didn’t fit as nicely!
5.0,This was a fun set to get in the mail. Was as described.
5.0,This is a perfect fit flattering dress.  It can be casual or paired with a nice jacket for a more business look.  Wish they had more colors so i could buy more!
5.0,Like the design and fabric. It’s cool against my skin and I really like that the upper arm is adjustable for bigger arms. Washes well and cute color.
5.0,I was very impressed that these were comfy and thick!
5.0,I bought this for my 2nd gen Moto 360 and it is really nice.  The quality of the steel is really good.  It matches the finish of the silver very well.
5.0,Excellent glasses I love it!!!!
5.0,This necklace was as nice as what is pictured.
5.0,This shirt fits great and feels soft too
5.0,"Very soft. I was looking for a summer sweater and this is perfect! Quick delivery, merchandise as described."
5.0,Great for working out and the price is right.
5.0,"With many things being converted to online, we are on our computers A LOT more. I got these for my teen boys and they love them! They really like the style and how they fit. I like them because of their flexibility. They’re great quality, especially for their price."
5.0,Really great hand bag. Love it alot.  Great medium size.  Has two handles.  A nice shoulder bag. Don't think handles are long enough to be used as a backpack as someone wanted to know. Have been using mine since April. Great price and love the classic black and white strips. Would recommend this handbag.
5.0,This was a fife for a friend. The material is soft and true to size. My friend absolutely loved it.  I would buy again
5.0,I got this dress specifically for a wedding. It. Looked. Amazinggggg on me! So happy I bought it. & I’ll def be wearing it again. Just be careful on not snagging the material on anything. It’ll snag pretty easy. It hugged my curves perfectly.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for a die hard fan. He loved it do much. He proudly wears it every Panther game.
5.0,I was purchasing the UnderArmour for an extensive period but became irritated that their lack of overall availability or in specific colors along with their prices keep going UP!! I do not paying for quality but having to wait several months became a major issue.  I'm a devoted fly fisherman who is ALWAYS LOOKING for quality products that will keep me comfortable in warm or hot weather ALONG WITH BEING able to camouflage myself while attempting to catch extremely wary fish.  This brand of clothing and will be purchasing more shirts in the near future.
5.0,Sexy and god fit
5.0,fits GREAT!
5.0,I got my son the youth size. It's a bit snug for him..hes 4. He loves it. Had a strong weird smell when opened. I just let it air out. Before hand

5.0,Fun fun fun
5.0,"So soft, beautiful color. Love it!"
5.0,"They seem strong like they will hold up for a long time, they work great for large collars."
5.0,excellent price and quality.
5.0,"I purchased these as the smallest in a group of three 14K WG Balls 2mm-4mm. I tend to wear my earings without taking them out at night, so I can attest to the fact that they are extremely durable and look as good as they did the day I donned them over 30 days ago.. Well worth the price paid."
5.0,It looks dressy! I’ve gotten lots of compliments on it!
5.0,This heart stole my heart! What a lovely treasure!
5.0,Loved every pair!  Great colors!

5.0,Love the shorts  but runs large
5.0,"I liked this so much I ordered a second Color .  It’s super comfortable , runs a bit big ( I am 5’6, 160 pounds ordered A medium )- nice scoop neck and tapered at the bottom and POCKETS !!"
5.0,This dress is very cute and fits true to size.
5.0,"I wanted some variety in my earring wardrobe so ordered these. I was pleasantly surprised. They are lightweight and decent quality (comparable of what you would find at Target). Price was amazing for four pairs. If they break, I wouldnt be too upset since they were inexpensive. The black and white metal pair and the green hoops are my favorite."
5.0,"These were a bit smaller than I expected, but serve as perfect party favor bags."
5.0,so very comfortable..it's always a balance. Would not last long. On opening the packet  found strands coming out socks<br />Comfort is most important to me .. so 5 stars.
5.0,It fit perfect!! Looked great and was happy with the way it  looked.
5.0,"Bought this watch for a gift,so cannot say much about it. But it does look like a very well made watch."
5.0,"The are absolutely wonderful. The foot is perfect, lightweight force and warm. I would like a dear fall Of these for winter. I doing to long do My pajamas wardrobe us growing. I dear them all day. Size one right on."

5.0,Looks great and professional under blazer for work office settings.  I loved it.
5.0,I just LOVE this head band. It does not slip and looks fantastic.  My only recommendation is when I'm working out I sweat and wondered if there's a pretty colored headband that will absorb more sweat...it does an ok job but I'd like to buy one more absorbent.
5.0,Hay que comprar una talla mas pequeña que la que usas regularmente. Es un poco grande. Pero me gustó la tela. La volveria a comprar
5.0,no residue.so good
5.0,Person I bought this for loves it<br />I almost kept it myself<br />Very nicely made
5.0,"Love it, fabulous color. Sexy!"
5.0,"I dont wear it but he like it. Seems like good material, nicer waistband than others."
5.0,"I am 5'5"" 190 lbs.  XL fit me well at the waist & abdomen & rear.  Legs are too long for me, but i could hem them up to hit right at my shoes. Know that they would need stitched (if long for you) due to the fabric being so smooth and light - it won't hold up if you just rolled the legs.  And the fabric is quiet when you move!  Pockets do not awkwardly gape open."
5.0,"Good feel, good fit!"
5.0,I really like these. I would buy them again. They would look good on my crafts.
5.0,"Just what I was looking for, soft and comfortable. Not too thin and not too heavy, just right. I ordered a second one. Love these flannel night shirts."
5.0,"Finally a pair of sunglasses designed for us big head boys. I have owned so many pair of sunglasses from cheap to very expensive, that did not fit well and in fact gave me a headache from being tight against the sides of my head. These sunglasses, are EXACTLY as described on Amazon, and when I put them on, I knew they were perfect. I've never had a pair fit so well. These are highly recommended for large heads. I would buy these again in an instant. Thank you GooglesandGlasses for the fine product! Job well done!"
5.0,I wore this dress to an outdoor even on a very hot summer day. It was cool and comfortable and perfect for the occasion.
5.0,This dress is super cute! Love the colors in it. Very comfortable
5.0,"Got these for a kids party.  They liked the variety, and I liked that they were washable and didn't dry out quickly."
5.0,"One of my favorite shirts. Also, thank you for the on-time delivery."
5.0,LOVE the colour and fits great
5.0,"Works great! I'm a new motorcycle rider , I dont even know how to shift gears! I fell off my first time and landed pretty hard the bike fell on me and because eof these guards my elbows, wrists and back were all fine! Definitely would recommend,  it looks funny but I wear this armour with a sweater overtop and that helps me alot to disguise it I suppose. Safety is #1 no matter what anyone says"
5.0,"Love this bag, maybe a little bigger than expected but still suitable for my needs."
5.0,"This watch was for me. I love this watch.  If you are a Disney fan, it is a must have!!"
5.0,Darling piece of jewelry.  Great with long sweaters!  Not super expensive but a super purchase!
5.0,My friend and I got them for a pep rally and fit nicely. I am 5' 8&#34; and she is 5' 4&#34; and both fit us different but still flattering
5.0,Great just what I wanted. Perfect fit.
5.0,"These are great. I ordered one for each of my two sons with autism/ADHD. I will say they are a bit long on my boys, who are both average height. They are 2.5 and 4 years old."
5.0,I love this shirt!!! Washed it a few times and still fits the same!
5.0,It’s a great hat! Great for shoveling and walking after dark!
5.0,"Pretty and unique. I work in a veterinary office and get complements on it all the time. I only wish the bale (or what ever the little slide-y part on top of the pendant is called) were a touch thinner. I feel it overwhelms the piece a bit.Otherwise, I would definitely recommend."
5.0,"This dress is super cute in the photos, however, when I tried it on…not so much.  The problem was that my chest size is smaller than the cut of this dress.  Thankfully, I have a grandmother who is super at alterations.  I tried it on for her and she said it would be an easy fix.<br /><br />After she altered the dress, it looked great.  Now I feel like I can wear it without being afraid of showing too much from the side.<br /><br />I ordered the dress in a size Large.  For reference my measurements are 34” bust, 28” waist, and 36” hips.<br /><br />The measurements for this dress in a size Large are as follows:<br />______________________<br /><br />Length - 34”<br />Across chest - 19”<br />Across waist - 14 1/2”<br />______________________<br /><br />Once it was altered I thought it looked great.  The bottom of the dress has a wire running through it to help hold its shape.  You can bend it to how you want the bottom to look.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

5.0,Beautiful blue
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful and well-made. The color of the stones is lovely. I’m sensitive to a lot of jewelry, but I’ve been wearing these for several days and have been fine! Very nice earrings. I’m happy with my purchase."

5.0,Beautiful....Looks great on
5.0,Very nice shirt a bit light weight but acceptable.  Good graphics
5.0,Absolutely love these earrings! Two of my friends ordered them after I did!! That’s how cute they are!
5.0,It is good and sturdy for the price..dosent sag...
5.0,"Love this dress! Very flattering and forgiving to my post partum body, and I love that the virtually hidden front zipper gives me access to nurse my baby in style."
5.0,Very good quality. I love it!
5.0,"If you're looking for a high quality hoodie -- I mean, that  is not what this hoodie is about. It's not going to keep you mega warm.That being said though, it's a cool looking and light enough for a fall hoodie. Plus you get to be a part of the Kobra Kai squad. GET HIM A BODY BAG!"
5.0,"Surprised this wasn't a scam somehow to be honest, but fits perfect, same color as in the picture, and is super comfy. It sheds like crazy but I'm sure that will change after some washes."
5.0,"So convenient. Used for a cosplay costume and stored my id, money, and business cards in the sleeves."

5.0,Fun socks. My 12 year old loves them.

5.0,Very quick and great product!
5.0,"Beautiful skirt, has elastic waistband. I wear a size 18-20 and I ordered a 2x. I was afraid it wouldn't fit, however it did and it fit perfectly! The color is just as shown. If you have questions about the blue in the skirt, it is more toward the royal blue family, however, it is a little bit lighter than pictured."
5.0,easy to wear. good selection for the money.
5.0,Quality is not the best but good for the price
5.0,Quality fabric and cute embroidery. I’m 5’3” with a short torso so the shorter length works for me. If you’re taller it will be a crop top. I got the navy and the white really pops. I love it!
5.0,awesome....loved it
5.0,the works great
5.0,It's a lovely bracelet.

5.0,Super cute and flattering dress. I received lots of compliments.
5.0,"These are super cute, lightweight socks, and they're even individually packaged so you can give them as gifts. If you plan to give them as gifts, know that they took about a month to arrive, so plan accordingly. The listing claims they're cotton, and they feel like they really are cotton or at least a high-cotton blend... but the package doesn't have much English on it, so I couldn't say for sure.<br /><br />They are a little on the small side-- they fit my size 8 feet fine, but they probably wouldn't fit much larger than a ladies' size 10.<br /><br />One pair had a little grayish grime that came out completely in the wash, so I didn't care."
5.0,Work very good
5.0,Its beautiful and fits nice
5.0,Great cmas gift

5.0,Awsum.....Got a lot of compliments!
5.0,Beautiful all the way!!!!!
5.0,"I ordered two of these, in yellow and grey. First let me say, fast shipping. These could have taken up to a month to arrive, but I got them in less than 10 days.<br />They are long and fairly wide. Theyre a silky, sheer, thin material, that isnt at all bunchy. So while they are very pretty and I would def wear them, they prob wouldnt be the best for a warm layer in winter. These are mostly a fashion accessory.<br />The grey was pretty true to its description, but the yellow wasnt the bright yellow I was expecting. Its a more subtle, almost nude shade.... but I almost like it better that way.<br />Overall, a great buy for the price. Would recommend. :)"
5.0,LOVE MY DRESS WEARS GREAT AND FEELS SO SOFT TO WEAR!!
5.0,"Good quality, very comfy, fits as expected. Tons of compliments!"

5.0,Great hat. My husband loves it. It is a little large for him but the next size down would have been too small so its his head and not the hat that has an issue. A small insert under the band fixed the problem and he is very happy with it and wears it all the time.
5.0,"Finally, someone has decided to make a frame that has no spacing! Love this new frame, bit shinier than the stock frame and paired it with a Milanese loop band I got a while back from a different company. I was worries upon purchasing this that the straps may not fit but thankfully, these do. The pins for the strap fit in perfectly."

5.0,Nice color dress. The texture is not cotton but I am not sure what type of material is it.  Is a light material but not see through. I like it for the summer weather.  The dress is long for my height 5. 1 but I love it.

5.0,Got many compliments.  Love it.
5.0,"These are nice. I needed some socks with grip for Yoga and they are perfect. I would recommend to moisturize the heel of your foot to make sure they don't move on you when working out, because they are very short."
5.0,"The case is perfect, exactly as promised. Very flexible. I love the pineapple on the back!"
5.0,Needed a thicker sock to make my ECCO shoes for better.  The extra padding on top protects the top of the foot better than the light hiking socks.

5.0,Great quality. I love the box they came in however they do not have dividers for the different sizes so you'll be sifting through them for a matching pair. You could also be like me and just toss them on the floor five minutes before work. That's the fastest option.
5.0,Bought for my youngest granddaughter as an extra Christmas gift - she loved them when I watched her virtually open them!
5.0,"Okay it's a hockey jersey....with the Slayer logo! Best combination ever!  Besides the amazingly obvious, it fit just like a regular guys jersey. Well constructed and the logo is embroidered.  I saw a guy wearing this jersey at the outdoor Stadium Series and HAD to have it, ordered it right there at the game from my phone.  Arrived faster than Zdeno Chara's slapshot!"
5.0,"Dad loves it, as long as the design holds up it is worth it."
5.0,Looks just as pictured

5.0,Earrings are very pretty and go well with a ring I had purchased earlier.  Great item.
5.0,"I love the length, pattern and it feels great on my skin. I wear it for any and all occasions."
5.0,"I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday and it is probably my favorite shirt of his. It fits true to size, is soft, and the printing is great quality. Washed once and the printing is still intact with no cracks and the shirt didn't fade at all. Extremely satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend."

5.0,"It's actually really nice. I never buy clothes online, and now I think I'm addicted."
5.0,"Great backpack! It’s super convenient for someone who doesn’t want a bag to take up lots of room. This thing folds up to the size of a roughly a sandwich bag to give you a perspective of it. Lots of pockets which make its perfect for traveling with lots of stuf. Perfect item for a hiker or just someone who prefers to travel with a carryon. Although I do prefer padding on the back and in the shoulder, but if you don’t then this is perfect."
5.0,Keeps me from overpacking!
5.0,Fits as expected. Holding up well so far.
5.0,Lovely suede cap that came wrapped nicely so that it was not crushed in transit. The material is supple and the fit is perfect. This hat will continue to wear well over time.
5.0,They are a thick opaque knit material and best worn in cool to cold weather. They're really high waisted and little to large for me in the waist area but they are still very comfortable. Works well if you'd like to hide your tummy while creating a shapely look. Have had no issues with underwear showing.

5.0,Muy linda y comoda

5.0,Love these sunglasses. Great quality and good price. Very cute.
5.0,"This dress fit nicely. I expected it to be just below the knee but it was below the calf. The model is probably 5-6 inches taller than I. It looks nice on.

5.0,About this for my grandson and he loves the lights and the music on the bomb

5.0,"I bought this as a gift, but the hat and gloves seem to be made very well. They are thick and I expect that they will keep the intended wearer very warm."
5.0,"Not as oversized as the model but really cute! You'll need a tank or scarf to cover the deep v area. I'm a size 14 fitting into this one size sweater. The color is very pretty! It's somewhat short on me, I'm 5'3 and will be wearing tights with it this winter."
5.0,"I used it for a wedding, the dress wis very elegant and the price was great"

5.0,"Maybe just a touch big, but this tunic is so sweet I will forgive it because just by getting rid of the ribbon waist cincher and adding a red belt makes it shine. The material on the bottom is fairly soft, a bit like linen and the chest area is made of a cotton jersey knit."
5.0,These are just as they appear in the photo.  So very cute for the sea-animal enthusiast!
5.0,Perfect i.love it and it matches my shoes perfectly
5.0,"I really like these masks. They are well-made and fit all of our faces. Please make them in different colors. We would really like to see some options available in reds, pinks, creams, browns, purples."

5.0,Nice quality. Super cute and dainty!!
5.0,Product is great. I love the adjustable straps! I honestly prefer the adjustable straps than the snap on ones

5.0,Loved it perfect fit
5.0,"strap is well made and colorful and just the right length, not long."
5.0,Band fit perfect on my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Arrived with all pieces. Adjustable band is great if you fluctuate weight as I do. Dries quick if ever gets water on it. Has been very durable through workouts and daily lifestyle. Super simple installation.

5.0,"This fit my 18-month, 21-lb daughter’s head nicely for her Jessie costume. It was a little loose (but didn’t fall off) so it would fit older children as well. I was impressed with the quality for the price. We were also able to use the red bandana for her dad’s Woody costume."

5.0,The rubber tips stretched perfectly over my sunglasses arms. No more sliding off and hitting the concrete!!!

5.0,"I received this cross as a gift about 3 years ago. I still wear it regularly and get many compliments on it. Recently the wording fell out. I'm looking for a way to fix it. But if i can't, I'll buy the same cross again."
5.0,The design and it was a perfect fit
5.0,Great quality. Perfect for my other jobs where I can't have names or logos
5.0,these pants are nice looking as well as being very comfortable!
5.0,"As an optometrist, I was skeptical if these glasses would help with red/green color deficiency so I purchased a pair myself and tried them with a couple of patients who had initially failed the Ishihara color plate testing.  Using the glasses, they could detect the numbers on the plates, so they were anxious to purchase a pair for themselves to experience real life settings with them."
5.0,Perfect. I wanted this to add some interest when wearing a boring tank or shirt. It is so cute and I get lots of complementstuff all the time. Just enough sexy without being offensive. It was a bitter larger then I expected so I have to wear it over a bra like a crop top. But over all I am very happy with my purchase. Would buy again for sure.
5.0,When this item came I feel in love with this. I am a heavy set girl and it fit a little tight but I made it work to fit me and I get complements on this. Very much worth the price and wait to get it.
5.0,"Get so many compliments on these, good compression socks. Love these for my 12 hours shifts."

5.0,It look great on me
5.0,Works fine. Filters I already had fit in the filter pocket
5.0,"I like this tote bag purse. It's sturdy, yet lightweight. Can hold of my items and I like that it has extra storage pockets. It's my new favorite! In fact, I liked the first one so much, I bought another one as back up for future use!"
5.0,Love it. Am wearing it now.
5.0,"It's very pretty and surprisingly well made. I bought it for my middle finger and it fits well. I frequently wash my hands with it on and it hasn't changed at all. Some lights make it sparkle more. Worth the cost. However, when I bend my knuckle the point sticks up. I have gotten it caught in my long hair and shirt but no damage has happened to it or me."
5.0,"I did not receive these free or at a discounted price in exchange for my review.<br />I love these, for several years now I've worn a scarf, covered by a snood, with a matching headband, this combination is all in one, it's great! I will definitely buy more and highly recommend for anyone wanting a stylish way to cover their hair, the wide band is soft, stretches nice & easy for a very comfortable fit, I love it!<br />Perfect hair protection"
5.0,So roomy and classy. Love it!
5.0,Very pretty necklace especially for the price.
5.0,"La gafas son excelentes, creo que ha sido una buena inversion, buen acabado, cómodas. Lo unico que la marca debería ofrecer son sujetadores, para evitar por error hacerlas caer. Las mia han tenido 3 caidas lo que me ha asustado pero ni un rayón. Esperamos sigan así."
5.0,Nice long necklace. Cute design.
5.0,"My son loves his shoes, and they fit perfect."
5.0,Great pin to go on my German hat!

5.0,It's pretty! I love it!!
5.0,"Love these leggings! They are just as soft as LuLaRoe leggings, but the higher waist is a plus. They are completely opaque and fit beautifully. Looking forward to see how they wash up, but I foresee myself stocking up on these!"
5.0,Easy to recognize and helps keep my suitcase together if the baggage claim or workers destroy it
5.0,My co-worker will love them. She has a strange sence of humor!!

5.0,"This is my second pair of pants in this style.  Black, of course, but now RED!  Fit like a glove - let me tell you, I have a 28"" waist and 36"" hips.  I am 5'8"" and now you can wear any pants.  Regular, cropped or?  They are the perfect length ankle pants.  I know, I know, Christmas is 3 months away, but living in AZ we live for fall/winter time!"
5.0,Update: I originally rated this wallet 5 stars because it seemed durable and had tons of storage! I have had this wallet 2 years now and it is really starting to show some wear and needs to be replaced. I use this wallet almost daily and have not treated it delicately so honestly I still feel like it’s still a great buy for the price! I purchased knowing that it was not leather so the wear was to be expected. The zippers and wrist loop are still sturdy so the quality is very good. I still love this design because I have tons of room to organize my business receipts and my money/cards/etc. Also it has been easy to wipe down and keep clean. Great buy!
5.0,Great small wallet with Key Chain attached. Has lots of room for cards and cash for a small type wallet. I use this for work id and keys to office.
5.0,Love these. They look and work great. Love that I can just flip them up when out of car for a few minutes
5.0,I bought these for my husband and sons. We bought multiple sizes and they all fit as expected. They are very durable yet lightweight. They arent bulky at all. They said they were very comfortable. These worked well even in deep water.  We are very pleased.
5.0,Adorable..my daughter loves them
5.0,Perfect dress. Excellent fabric quality and super flattering cut.
5.0,Bought as a birthday gift and they are amazing. I am not usually able to wear earrings more than an hour and after 24 hrs I still have them in and no pain or irritation. Beautiful look and don't want to take them off.
5.0,"Tue fabric is a little thin, so you need to keep the pads in, but if offers good support and fits perfectly. Great product for the price!"
5.0,"I like it, perfect fit, need more colours for the same price"
5.0,These are so comfortable and breathable. And they have a little extra stitching for the breast area. Which makes the shirt the same “size”
5.0,The necklace is very nice and my girlfriend loved it.
5.0,I absolutely love it.
5.0,Yes yes and yes!!!! Adjustable size helps this well made ear protection last for years. 10 stars.
5.0,My husband is a plumber and these were perfect for work. They keep his hands warm and protected but make it convenient to do his job. They are made of great quality and will definitely be ordering a couple more pairs.
5.0,I LOVE WHAT THESE SOCKS SAY!<br />LOVE IT
5.0,Love the style of the dress and it fits perfect .
5.0,"I purchased this bikini from Amazon. I really like the style of this bikini. The top has a high neck crochet and ties at the back of the neck. It also has a clip that clasps at the center of the back. The bottoms has crochet at each of the sides. The back of the bottoms is solid color. After reading the reviews, I purchased a size up. I purchased a large and large is a little big. The elastic under the boob area is loose. I like this bikini and I think it was priced reasonably."
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these glasses! I chose the silver wire with reflective smoked lenses. The lenses are a great full coverage size and I absolutely love the very distinctive design. They're a nice heavier weight, NOT flimsy."
5.0,I got this for a strapless bra where the band was so loose that it would fall completely down if I wore it throughout the day. The clip did it's job and it now stays in place! Saved me a lot of money so I didn't have to buy a new bra.
5.0,I like this dress very much. I did not expect for this price Great quality
5.0,I like the helmet. Will probably get another.
5.0,"Loved  it, lots of complaints!"

5.0,Very comfortable and decent support.
5.0,Great shorts
5.0,"UPDATE ... I learned something new.  Apparently, the reviews go with the watch, no matter who is selling it and at what cost.  I bought all mine thru River Edge Jewelers, who were great, and I paid $325 for them.<br /><br />In researching the various Luminox watches, I noticed that many people with questions self-identify as military or law enforcement.  Many are our US Marines.  Since I collect watches, and I am a vet of both the Military, and Federal Law Enforcement, I thought I might offer a few comments for those considering the purchase of this, or any other ""tool watch.""  I’ve seen very few watch manufacturers with so many variations … and some might find them confusing.<br /><br />Short version, IMHO, this 3801 is the best bang for the buck Luminox offers, that is actually suitable for its advertised purpose.<br /><br />To that point, note the difference between waterproof depth certifications … 300 Meters on this, to as low as 100 or 200 meters.  This is recommended for Scuba diving, the others are not.  This strikes me as odd.  I’ve been a Divemaster more than 40 years, so I am well aware that Scuba divers do not dive at 100 Meter depths, let alone 200 Meters, yet the watches certified to 100 and 200 Meters are not recommended for Scuba Diving.<br /><br />They call many of their watches, SEAL versions, yet they say they are not suitable for recreational Scuba divers?<br /><br />Look at the case backs.  Luminox case backs either screw on with four screws, or they have a screw-in case back like this one.  Note that the more expensive ones from Luminox (and pretty much everyone else from Seiko to Rolex) intended for serious use, all have screw-in case backs.<br /><br />Similarly, note the screw down crown on this watch.  I suppose I’d shower with a watch without one, but they don’t recommend them for diving, and I wouldn’t buy one.  Any real dive watch in my collection (pictured) has a screw down crown.<br /><br />Crystals these days come in mineral, hardened mineral, and sapphire.  It is very hard to scratch hardened mineral, but sapphire will never scratch.  On the other hand, if you scrape it against something like a coral head that will not scratch the sapphire, you’re likely to scuff up the bezel and case, trashing the looks of the watch anyway.  Go either way, but this sapphire is better.<br /><br />It may sound odd, but ANY quartz movement keeps time better than the most expensive automatics.  Seriously, you can buy a quartz watch for under $50 that will keep time FAR more accurately than a $10,000 Rolex.  This Ronda 715 is generally recognized as a very good quality quartz.<br /><br />CAUTION … if you like automatics, as I do, there is a seller on Amazon selling what they identify as a Luminox Master Carbon SEAL AUTOMATIC 3801, and charging more than double what this watch costs ($725) accordingly, as one would expect of an automatic.  This seller seems to be the only seller in the world offering the automatic version of this 3801.  That's because there is no such thing.  IT IS NOT automatic … they list the movement in specifications as a Ronda 715, which is this same quartz in this one.<br /><br />T100 vs T25 Tritium.  T100 is much brighter (4x) than this T25 Tritium.  I’m long done with night vision operations, but I still do not want a watch that is any brighter than necessary to see clearly at “Zero Dark Thirty” when the lume on everything else I have is dead.  You guys know how far away you can see a lit cigarette with night vision … I don’t need a torch on my wrist, for me, this is perfect.<br /><br />This is a BIG watch, bigger than anything else I have except Panerai, with a band long enough for any human wrist.  At my age, I like a big watch with big numbers.  For comparison, most Submariner style dive watches are 40mm - this is 46mm.<br /><br />Finally, a point which may be of interest to nobody but me.  Every watch I wear regularly has a custom band and deployment clasp.  Bands typically come in 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 mm widths.  Some of the other Luminox watches specify a 23mm band, which is fine unless you want to change it. This is a 24mm, that I replaced with a stingray band and a deployment clasp.<br /><br />We all know about opinions, but I have three sons in the military, and a daughter-in-law who is also a US Marine.  I took advantage of the dropped price and bought some gifts.  I really do believe that this is the best ""tool watch"" offering by Luminox for the money.<br /><br />This seller was perfect, it was out via FedEx the day I ordered it, carefully packaged, complete with box, papers and hang tag, but if this price goes up, you’ll find this watch on EBay and everywhere else on the Net.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful."
5.0,"Looks a little more &#34;cheap&#34; than in the picture but still cute, great price."
5.0,Really great watch band- very comfortable.
5.0,Nice and loose
5.0,"Beautiful, everything it's good, long, material  color ,size,makes my body look nice shape 😀"
5.0,These are so soft and comfortable.  The fit of xl is as expected ... I like pj's a lil loose.
5.0,I get many compliments!  All masks are comfortable light cloth with adjustable straps. Everyone should wear these so you can lip read!
5.0,"LOVE THESE PANTS. I was nervous buying jeans online without being able to try them on but after reading reviews I went for it. These fit beautifully, make my butt look awesome and are SO COMFORTABLE!!!"
5.0,"My wife and I bought this (ok, I bought it for her) for some sexy role playing so I could tear her clothes off without feeling guilty about spending too much cash.  Worked like a charm!"
5.0,"I love this dress! The material is much better than I even expected, it’s pretty thick, not see through and easy to move in. I’m very tall, 5’11” and it goes to my knees. Great for weddings or special occasion. Only thing I didn’t like was how deep the v was cut being small chested, but still looks great !"
5.0,These are my most favorite slippers ever. Fit is perfect. So warm and comfortable. Sturdy enough to wear outside.
5.0,"Bought this to organize my &#34;work&#34; tote bag.<br />Highly recommend this!!<br />Well made, lots of pockets"
5.0,Gift to husband and he loved it! Perfect fit and looks cute
5.0,"This was a very nice dress. It felt heavy and good quality. However, I did not think it suited my short pear-shaped body frame up top. It was kind of snug at the band up top under the arms , and kinda made my skin pooch out. It was baggy everywhere else though so sizing up wouldn't have helped. If you have extra pounds I think this band might highlight that. Or it was my short torso I dont know. Pretty dress though. I would think it would have to be ironed after washing because of the heavy material. Would probably be very pretty on a taller person"
5.0,Sweet Clothing Line
5.0,"I was a little skeptical at first when I seen some reviews stating how it doesn't really fit properly and slides off the phone easily. Despite some complaints on this product, I decided to take a leap of faith and buy this adorable Winnie the Pooh case. It actually came a day earlier than expected and I love it!!. It fits my phone nice and snug and the buttons work properly. It does make the phone more bulky, but I actually like it bulky lol. It draws attention and compliments and I even made a friend in college from this adorable phone case!"
5.0,Very nice quality feeling and packaged gloves.
5.0,Came in early. Love the way it feels. Didn't find anything wrong with it. Very pleased.

5.0,Purchased this for my daughter.  She teaches daycare and loves it!.  The pockets are great.
5.0,Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.
5.0,I love this hoodie for the price. It's not as thick as the Russell or Fruit Of The Loom hoodies that I have but it was less expensive and it is very soft and comfortable. I am 5'10&#34; and I am a muscular 195 lbs and the XL fits me just right.
5.0,Yes!<br /><br />No more black feet at the end of my showers at my gym... Looks stylish and is lightweight. Its perfect and would recommend.
5.0,"I bought this bag for my mother-in-law for Christmas. When I received it, I almost kept it for myself. It was packaged wonderfully, and was beautiful. The leather is a deep rich brown and it is very well made. My mother-in-law has received numerous compliments on the bag. Eventually I plan to buy myself one."
5.0,"Finally I found what had been so evasive,  boxer briefs with the right material,  95% cotton,  bellow the belly button,  tight legs<br />NO ROLL UP !!!!! . I  reordered, definitely would recommend this product.<br /><br />Hector"
5.0,"I love this bag. The embossing is beautiful. It's a little bit smaller than I was hoping, but it still holds enough to get by for a day of errands or a night out. Very good quality for the price."
5.0,Perfect size. Not too big or too small. Very roomy. Leather is soft not stiff. Plenty of pockets. Would purchase again. You will not be dissapointed!!

5.0,My mother loved it.  Great gift!
5.0,This heavy duty an well engineered Keychain clasp thats heavy duty enough to wear worry free on my belt loops!

Time will tell but this great design and heavy duty construction leads me to believe I've finally found the very best!
5.0,yep
5.0,Fits great 👍🏼
5.0,"I received my scarf way earlier than expected. I ordered it on September 7 and when I checked my email it informed me that it would be here in October. I then received an email stating that my package my had shipped on the 11th of September. I was in no hurry to get the scarf because my plans for it is to get it monogrammed for a family member for Christmas. On Wednesday, the 20th of Sept. my scarf arrived. It has such bright and vibrant colors. Since it arrived early enough, I'm thinking of ordering one for me, my daughter and mom also.<br />The blanket scarves are so versatile that you can wear them so many different ways. That's why I think this would make a great gift for females this holiday season, and at this price you certainly can't go wrong."
5.0,Love these shorts! Fits perfectly and perfect length
5.0,Vivrant color and good quality. It runs large.
5.0,"Exactly as described and I will enjoy it every 4th of July. This scarf is silky and lightweight, which I prefer over the scarves that are puffy and/or heavy. Arrived quickly."
5.0,This necklace is beautiful. It can be used to dress up or down an outfit. I was very pleased with it.
5.0,Great Easter/church dress. I got lots of compliments on how beautiful my daughter looked in her adorable dress and hat.
5.0,Everything was as expected from the explanation and size chart.
5.0,Our basketball team loved them and they look great. They look very costly even though they were very affordable!
5.0,"This product arrived on time and well packaged.  I ordered this to use for a newborn photo session as a photographer and am thrilled of the quality and color.  First the size is better than others because of how stretchy it is.  I know it fits a newborn well because of another review that was posted with pictures.  That already is much better than what other products offer online, they almost never fit according to reviews!!  Also I tried it on my one and two year old children and they fit both of them very well.  I am so appreciative of the variety in age that this bib offers!! I believe the color is softer and more baby like in person.  I can't believe how inexpensive it is, a seriously great find!!!<br /><br />  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my 100% honest review, this discount has not altered my opinion in any way."
5.0,Awesome item! I deliver groceries as a part time job and these bags work great at keeping food hot or cold! I'm very happy about this purchase
5.0,"WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS, BUT I DO LOVE THEM. THEY LOOK MUCH BETTER IN PERSON. PERFECT ON OUR WALLS IN OUR HALLWAY TO GO WITH OUR TIKI THEME. I LOVE THEM."
5.0,"This workout set is really great…it comes with a sports bra and shorts, both with the perfect amount of stretch. The bra does have a bit of padding to it. The shorts are higher waisted and conform perfectly to curves. The set is very on trend with the asymmetrical lines and the multiple cutouts. All in all, I think this set is perfect for light to mid impact workouts. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Great quality, great price and looks and feels just like the over priced name brand"
5.0,I have never bought a pair of Gloria Vanderbilt pants that I didn’t love. I’m curvy and they always fit perfect.
5.0,"This has made a big difference in my mask wearing. I sometimes do deliveries, and breathe heavy when I walk/sprint up and down apartment stairs with packages. This has made it MUCH easier to breathe and not feel like I'm suffocating in material from my mask. You will have to sew it in to the mask, but the plastic has tabs you can slide it in and out of the mask to wash it, if you sew it right."
5.0,"Very cute, and works great. Nice and sturdy for your heavy knits, but light enough for your gauzy and jersey knits. The small is about 4.5 inches."
5.0,Holding up well to my 3.5 year old boy’s wild lifestyle.
5.0,I received so many compliments on the dress! It fit perfectly! The pockets are fun. The zipper is amazing! I didn’t have to use it though. I was worried about the yellow bleeding on the white in the wash but wasn’t a problem at all!
5.0,(1)it came earlier than expected.i love it!!!!
5.0,bought as gag gift for upcoming baby shower - very cute
5.0,"This was just what I needed, I am SO glad I ordered two. Very well made, silky fabric that skims the bed under you and doesn't feel cheap, or clammy in warm weather. Heavy enough not to ride up but silky cool and comfy. I love it in any weather. Toss and turn to your hearts delight."
5.0,"I tend to focus on attractive products at fair prices due to budget constraints. This watch qualifies. Sleek in appearance and slick on the wrist, I'm happy with my purchase. It looks much more expensive than the actual price."
5.0,It works great. I was able to save my jewelry
5.0,Looks nice. I bought it for a nurse who works with me every day she is on. Four days of the week. I love the woman she has a beautiful heart....!
5.0,"Fallout fan, looking for a nice size small size dopp bag? This is for you! It has space for everyone I want to Carry with me and then some. Over all can’t complain, this bag is a nice size and has pockets for everything I wanted, also it’s fallout."

5.0,"These earrings are so pretty!  They are perfect for spring and summer.  They are not heavy, so they do not pull your earlobes down. They also came with an extra pair of backs."
5.0,"The 2T fit my 2 year old perfectly with just enough room to grow! I needed to cuff the bottoms for him, but it doesn't look too baggy. They are cute as can be!"
5.0,I love this knife
5.0,"Shrinks really easily. But other then that, these are a great fit and shirt!! Love them!!"
5.0,These gloves are so comfortable and the fit was perfect.

5.0,Loved this dress. Such a great price !
5.0,Really a beautiful necklace.
5.0,We bought this for our daughter who loves captain marvel. This is one of her favorite shirts now.
5.0,I have bought similar items  in Caribbean beach shops for more than double this price.  THIS was the colors I have been looking for.  Deliver was swift considering I am in Alaska and for good measure I also bought the pareo in the same pattern and colors.  I highly recommend this product and seller.
5.0,Fits great. Nice and warm
5.0,"Well fitted, kool looking....comfortable!"
5.0,"This sweater is so cute, and the asymmetrical hem is both flattering and unique. Sleeves are stretchy and plenty long. The ivory is slightly see through so I’ve got a cami on underneath. 5’4”, 130 lbs and I got the small."
5.0,It is super cute and very soft!
5.0,"Bra was exactly as advertised. I didn’t think I bought a large enough size at first, but I put it on, cinched it up and fastened it, and got boobs I didn’t know I had. Dang!"
5.0,"Its looks great, Next time, I will order one a little thicker."
5.0,Love the quality of the robe.
5.0,Great quality and fit. Perfect
5.0,Really like the colors and comfort.
5.0,super cute even though I should've sized down
5.0,"I've read previous reviews on these Jaragar watches, and I'll admit to being a bit reluctant to buy one. If all of them perform as well as this one, I'll purchase additional watches.<br />The watch is quite well-made, finished nearly flawlessly, and is neither too large nor too small. All the date-numbers line up perfectly in the small viewing window, and the sub-dial pointers line up precisely to the corresponding numbers on their dials. I especially like the contrast between the watch's hand color and the face, it allows you to see the time without having to be in optimal light. The watch is well-calibrated and keeps perfect time. I have compared it against my digital atomic desk-clock, and it is within mere seconds of being spot-on. Give the crown a few winds (I think it's clutched against over-winding) then the motion of your arm is enough to keep the watch running. The crown is a bit difficult to 'pinch' between your fingers to wind, but it can be wound in this manner.<br />The exposed balance-wheel gives the timepiece additional interest and is fun to watch!<br />My one gripe: although the hands are luminous, they don't hold light for very long. Other than that, I love it."
5.0,"These are good quality, great value, my son absolutely loves them. Easy to put on and take off."
5.0,I spend a lot of time fly fishing.  I also border on macrocephalic.  The hat is easy to adjust and fits great.  Its light weight and a damn fine looking lid.  The long bill helps out a lot on the water.

5.0,Great product.... perfect food motorcycle.

5.0,Fantastic fitting Jacket. Bought it as a gift and it came on time.
5.0,"My daughter wears these under her white button down uniform shirts, she has OCD about material quality at 5 (everything makes her skin itch) these worded for her, nice and soft with good return stretch. it’s been over 4 months, I wash them every week and they are still in great condition. Will definitely re-order."
5.0,Its exactly what I need it.
5.0,Love these! I am extra so they suit me perfect!
5.0,Thanks👍🏻 I lovet.
5.0,"I am very pleased with my purchase from Efy Tal Jewelry. Before purchasing, I contacted the seller to ask about ordering a custom length and color on the necklace. She responded quickly and told me she would be happy to do for me without extra fee. The shipping was much faster than I'd expected. The necklace is beautiful and my mom loves it. She told me she hasn't take it off yet. Highly recommend"
5.0,"Needed something other than my neoprene for this florida heat. Great price,  great fit. We'll see how well they hold up in saltwater. Seem comfortable. Avid Florida wade fisherman. Carry them in my truck 24/7 with gear and tackle. I'll add  another  review later"

5.0,Works great.  My son’s glasses don’t fall off.
5.0,Lightweight and very comfortable! Fits better than expected!

5.0,Tryed it in Romania for geese and duck shooting<br />Tryed in my country (Kuwait) for dove shooting<br />Nice camo<br />But its not that good for cold weather
5.0,Very nice but hook is small

5.0,"I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter for Halloween. I painted her face like a cheetah. She criss-crossed the scarf across her throat and put her &#34;paws&#34; through her jacket. The costume was a real hit! And the great part about it is, she gets to continue wearing this thing all winter long as well. It's her favorite winter item and I don't have to bug her any more to wear hats or hoods. Nor is it a hassle to help her pull on her gloves. Every little girl she own one of these. Just so much fun and functional!"

5.0,"Love, love, love this dress! It is just as described including the color and the sizing. The stretch is not too tight but helps you to move freely. I am so happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Fits perfect for this tattooed 50+ old lady 😉  Shows shoulder tats nicely ❤️ I am 145 lbs 5’4 and medium drapes nicely over my middle age ‘spread’.
5.0,"Best laptop bag I've ever used.  Very well built with thick, strong leather.  Real metal zippers that work.  Will buy another if I ever wear this one out!"
5.0,"My wife loved it.  She wanted the Faith, Hope and Love Anchor that wouldn't get caught in her blouse and this design was perfect.  The pendant was beautiful; an eye-catching piece of jewelry."
5.0,Mint color is beautiful. Very soft. Medium fits loose. I'm 5'2&#34; 110lbs.
5.0,Got this for my sister birthday! I was skeptical with the pictures that I would be cheap because it looks green but it came yellow and what it is supposed to be. Great quality!
5.0,The style is amazingly unique and the comfort is unmatched!<br />Also my husband currently has about 40 different sneakers in his closet so the “most comfortable sneaker he has ever owned” is coming from a source that has worn a lot of sneaker styles
5.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  It was delivered quickly and is just as described .  It's adorable and I'm certain he's going to love it.
5.0,The classic case that you are looking for to replace the broken case that you've had for years.
5.0,"Love these pants! The fit was great, not too tight. The pockets are awesome! Used these to work out and walk around theme parks"
5.0,This is the perfect size purse. The flexible leather stays folded in until you need to enlarge your carry space into a full tote. Fossil offers great quality in all of their leather goods.
5.0,Worth the wait to receive the case it’s beautiful and well made
5.0,Great.Second time purchased.
5.0,It’s all Beth kinda of shirt
5.0,"Really nice charms, great for springtime jewelry making. They seem to be of good quality. They're around 14-15mm, I like the small size. Happy with my purchase."
5.0,For anyone who is unable to wear pierced earrings these are a must have. They fit perfectly & I could hardly tell I was wearing them they were so light & comfortable. The boxes they came in were super cute & I loved the free gift :) I'm looking forward to owning as many Earlums as I can get my hands...& ears on!!ha
5.0,"Please note: it says in the description that this doesn't come with a power source, that's why it's so cheap! But my stepdad has a half dozen power banks just randomly sitting around at home, so that's no problem for us! He really loves this coat! Mom says they can sit on the patio at restaurants and don't even need to be near a heater anymore. My stepdad is one of those people who is eternally freezing, so this has improved his quality of life considerably. Hooray technology!"
5.0,What can I say? 5 countries and we weren't pickpocketed and had no issues with credit cards. It could be a coincidence or it could be this awesome wallet. Handy to keep your passport in and it fits in a pocket easily.
5.0,High quality well constructed
5.0,"Very nice ring, nice weight and nice fit. Very good looking ring for the money."
5.0,"Súper cute, modern."
5.0,So warm and comfy that u do not want to take it off!!!! The hood is wonderful!!! I bought the burgundy/wine beautiful !!! My mom liked it so much that I bought one for her!!!
5.0,"Hat's look mint, they came in a box and not crushed like others have done.  Big thumbs up"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:94083b572e96fd63ec65d8fe1cc93ef9]] This is reeeally cute. It feels like a scrunchie rather than a watch band. Very very cute & comfortable. Happy w my purchase, would like to get more patterns (:"
5.0,COOL ! !
5.0,Very nice. Good quality.
5.0,So adorable. Perfectly warm and soft. Goes well with school uniforms. Will order more!
5.0,"Love these socks they fit great, don't slide and sweat resistant. Not to hot to wear in the summer!"
5.0,"I need to wear EMF clothing, but most of it makes you look like a cross between a medieval mendicant and an extra in a post-war sci-fi B movie. This scarf is a welcome change! It looks and feels fantastic--very soft with a subtle sheen and a flattering gunmetal blue color. I hope this company comes out with a whole line of clothing. I'd definitely buy more from this line."
5.0,Beautiful! Can’t wait to give it to my sister
5.0,Great wallet. Simple but effective.
5.0,Excellent for travel.  Pretty tight but that's what you want!  Both my husband an I use them for travel.
5.0,The article is exactly what was described/ordered.  It arrived quickly.
5.0,"Interesting that this asked me to rate the fit, since it is a cleaning product.<br /><br />It works as it should and keeps my boots looking great.<br /><br />Much easier to apply with hot water and a good scrubbing sponge. Does not leave a gloss finish on boots, which is good when they spend all day in the dirt."
5.0,just as pictured and described
5.0,I love the drawstring at the back. Free the people has nothing on this dress
5.0,"This dress is absolutely a great fit – perfect for professional or dressy casual wear. I got this dress in medium green (I am 5’7”, size 8) and this dress fits so snugly and perfect. Hugs all my curves beautifully since the fabric has a lot of stretch. There is a side zipper to help get the dress on and off. The material is of a reasonable thickness and opaque, but show undergarment lines (would recommend seamless panties). With how stretchy this material is, the dress is extremely comfortable in addition to looking very attractive. I can’t wait to wear this out!"
5.0,"Me gusta todo desde la tela, hasta el estampado"
5.0,These are so cute I wear them out and I get complimented and my husband says I don’t look like an old lady anymore. They fit my big Afro too!
5.0,"These are wonderful socks.  They fit well and have a  nice snugness around the middle of your foot.  They have a nice fabric feel, very soft and cushioned.  I think the wicking/warmth feature is the best in socks I’ve tried.  I always have cold feet so when I say that these socks are dramatically better at keeping my feet warm, it’s true.  They also stay on my foot, but have the no-Show profile."
5.0,Fits nicely. Perfect length and very light. No pockets.<br />I’m 5’6. 180lbs. 40D.
5.0,Extremely gorgeous necklace. Worth way more than I paid for it! Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you
5.0,They are really cute and stay put on your clothing.
5.0,"So cute! Looks just like it does in the pictures, and the medium fit me perfectly- I am a size six, 5'7&#34;, and about 140lbs. I wore this without a bra and the fabric is thick enough that it's not see-through at all. It pairs really nicely with the chokers the seller has as well. :)"
5.0,This is the my wife really wanted. She is thrilled with it. She was surprised with how small a box it could fit into. I would say it has no stiffners in it to make it bulky. She will be using it as a vacation/trip purse
5.0,stretchable awesome product
5.0,Perfect!!! Just what I wanted!!!
5.0,No problems of any kind.
5.0,Lovely craftsmanship. NinaQueen Bead Quality.
5.0,I was excited to find these as my husband and son have worn Maxx sunglasses purchased at a local golf course for years.  They had always ran a little big on my son and fell off easily.  These are great for a junior size person or those with a narrower head.
5.0,Beautiful piece fast delievery
5.0,"I sent it to my daughter. She called me in tears , she so loved the sentiment. No special occasion, which made it more of a surprise."
5.0,"Great product, very cute design. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,"I was a little. Surprised at how much I love this sweater. It's very flattering on me and it looks even nicer in person. . I ordered my usual  size and the fit was perfect,  it's made from very high quality material..... So comfortable and very warm. I love the little details on the sleeves and the criss cross tie up at the chest area..... It gives the sweater personality instead of it just being another basic sweater. I love that the color matches pretty much everything which is a huge plus for me cause I take these things into account when choosing things like what eyeshadow shade to wear. I highly recommend,  this was a great purchase that I'm more than happy with"
5.0,Fits well and material is very soft.
5.0,Nothing bad to write just please be aware this mask will not properly protect you if that’s what you are looking for crystals all in place fits and looks lovely
5.0,"The belt arrived very quickly. It's easily as good looking in person as it is online. Works just as described and the size was also as advertised. But, you will REALLY want to use the release a few times before you need to unlatch it in a hurry. If you know what I mean. It's very simple to use but I had about a half second of panic before I got it undone.😁<br />Great product!"
5.0,"Runs very small, so just order it 1-2 sizes bigger and its great!"
5.0,The earrings are wonderful and beautiful but they were very small so they look tiny on my ears. Yet I would recommend 😊
5.0,"These were very cute. Some people said they did not like the tail but it worked well with the outfit I used it with. I just used a safety pin to attach to back of pants, and the top of my shirt covered that part."
5.0,A really big and chunky dive watch that is as easily recognizable as any Rolex dive watch. A true professional diver's tool.
5.0,Great looking tie! Dress to impress with this one!!!
5.0,Loved it. Very comfortable.
5.0,Beautiful color and fits perfectly!
5.0,"Very cool, good quality"
5.0,"I plan to order again - it did take a long time to arrive, but worth the wait :)"
5.0,"My second purchase from Efy.  Wonderfully packaged, personable and just beautiful.  Hand crafted from her heart to ours!"
5.0,"This was well made and cute.  I am 5'6&#34;, 128lbs and I ordered a size small based on others reviews, but the small was very tight and no stretch.  If I kept it up very high, the small would fit, but I feel like the medium for me could have been more comfortable and lay in a better spot."
5.0,"Perfect for security uniform.  Good quality for the price.  Would definitely buy again, however, I need a darker LAPD Navy.  The navy was just a little too light for our dark navy shirts."
5.0,"Great socks for Pilates, yoga or barre workout<br />Easy to wear, having the toes separated helps for more flexibility of the feet.<br />I have bought several pairs from this brand and I am very happy with the design and quality"
5.0,"i ordered the correct size, based on the buying/size tips on the site.  i ordered a size larger than i normally would, and this fits perfect!  love it!"
5.0,"This bikini is so cute!!  I am usually a small, but because of the other reviews, i ordered a large and it fits perfectly"
5.0,I love this dress. I get so many compliments when I order it. I love the color and fit. The tie and pockets are the best part.
5.0,For perfectly. Daughter loves the design and colors.
5.0,I love the way the dress fits the only thing was the sheerness of the white. I definitely would buy it in a dark color again. I wore it to a wedding and got a lot of compliments. I’m 5’7 235
5.0,Cute case!
5.0,My son loved this shirt! It's a cotton t- shirt not a jersey type material. Great product!
5.0,Great product...excited to use it for photo prop
5.0,I love the cost. It is warm and cozy.
5.0,Great quality. The shirts are true to size.
5.0,"it's great, it cleaned my necklaces and look like brand new. I like the size and it came on time."
5.0,Quality is great.  Arrived on time and fit as expected.
5.0,Keep this in a prominent place in my prayer room and appreciate using it in daily prayers. I enjoy using the scriptures written into it as part of my prayer routine. The quality is fine and I like how it looks and feels. Its a blessing by enhancing my prayer time.
5.0,It was nice. As pictured.
5.0,"I regret not buying a size up (4T-5T) for my 3 year old(turning 4 in December). After reading reviews that indicated the clothing ran a bit big I decided to buy size 3T-4T. I noticed the shirt was a little tighter than I would of liked (still comfortable enough to wear though), he probably won't be able to use it alot since he'll out grow the shirt soon. Over all, beautiful shirt and looks just like the picture. Also, great quality! Did not have any weird odors. Made my son look super adorable. Great clothing for a hawaiian theme party!"
5.0,Must have bag lots of complements
5.0,Perfect belt
5.0,"Great product, great price, and it shipped quickly and securely."
5.0,Loved that it was stretchy
5.0,You can style it!
5.0,"This scarf was very nice. It looked really good. It really can add a lot to an outfit. It can make the whole thing look different. It was pretty versatile and would work in a wide variety of settings. Likewise, I felt like it was good for both someone younger and older.<br /><br />I was pleased with the quality. It felt durable. It was very soft.<br /><br />It was comfortable to wear. I also thought it was very flattering. It looked nice on. This would also make a nice gift. I would recommend it."
5.0,That's great
5.0,the shirt arrived vert fast and it fits perfectly
5.0,I was concerned that this wouldn't be as pretty as the photo seems but it is really lovely.
5.0,Pretty much just what I thought it would be.
5.0,"I absolutely love them!! Not only are they adorable (and I've been looking for ombré leggings FOREVER), but they're nice and long too! They don't look long out of the package, but when you put them on they stretch or something! I'm 5'11 and they hit my ankles (no scrunching though). And the gray color at least is totally squat proof if you size up!"
5.0,"So beautiful, classy, and high quality. I can't wait to display necklaces on this. Great linen-like covering really makes gold and earthtones pop!"
5.0,"This pendant is simple and beautiful.  I recently purchased it for my sister after we lost our beautiful 17-year-old kitty, Wendy.  My sister loves it and wears it every day."
5.0,Ordered this for my granddaughter she loved it. The Magic dust glows so bright you can even see it in the light. She put the necklace in the sun for a couple of hours and it glowed all night.<br />More than I expected in quality.
5.0,These fill extremely well and are so comfortable! I will buy again.
5.0,"Love this dress so much! With a little heel the length will be perfect. I am 5'5"" and 128lbs and a medium was perfect. I don't have boobs so take that for what it's worth haha."
5.0,Very nice cut and construction. Better than expected fabric quality.  Quality elastics.
5.0,These work out great. I am a nurse and work 12+ hour shifts with arthritis and these help keep swelling down with my ankles.
5.0,I gave them a 5 star bc they are super cute on me but if i had to rate them on quality i would have given them a 1 star. but i guess it's one of those deals where you get what you pay for!
5.0,Fit me like a glove ...to cute !!
5.0,I will enjoy the warmth that this coat affords.
5.0,Great quality. Good price.
5.0,"I love this dress.  I wear a medium in shirts for the most part and have a fairly large bust, and the medium fits perfectly.  It's a little long but I'm only 5'0&#34; so I expected it to be long.  Very flatter cut and forgiving material.  Love the colors."
5.0,cute and perfect size
5.0,"I wear them everyday at work I simply just love them! Yes, I will buy them again. They are not too large, so you look like the 85 year old driving down the street, pretty stylish for over the glasses shades."
5.0,Bellas y delicadas me encantaron
5.0,"I absolutely love my new watch!!! It is just as described in the description. It has a good weight to it but not heavy. The chronometers do work but it took some patience. The mesh band has a nice feel to it. The buckle has not come undone nor caught on anything. If you have an 8” wrist which is larger like mine this will fit you, I have it on the second to last hole."
5.0,Cute wear it everyday
5.0,It is a great leotard.  I do wish it had snaps underneath for the bathroom.
5.0,The [[ASIN:B019G9KXXO SnuG watchbands Women's Moto 360 16mm replacement Watch Band for 2nd Gen Moto360 Quick Release with Rose Gold Deployment Buckle (BLACK with Rose Gold Buckle)]] is a great looking watch band and matches the Rose Gold finish perfectly. Adjusting it to my wrist was easy and now it fits &#34;SNUG&#34;. The only issue is the unpleasant odor the band has. I am going to try washing it in some of the<br />Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser to try to get rid of it.
5.0,My kid ordered this without asking. While I think it looks dumb... I have checked thoroughly to make sure this won’t hurt her teeth in the long run and let her wear them for stupid pictures. It’s lasted awhile with no show of wear. So if this is your kinda thing I guess I’m giving it 5 stars. I still find it weird but to each their own.
5.0,"Great purse, took on a cruise. Was lightweight, has lots of secure zip pockets. Love the outside pockets which securely held my glasses.  Strap could go on shoulder or cross body, adjusts easily. The various shades of pink are very pretty. Reasonably priced. One of my best purchases!"
5.0,"Fits well. Flatters. Pockets are reasonably sized. Very soft and comfy. Not too thin, slightly stretchy t-shirt knit. Neckline may be a little low if you're looking for something for work /church, but a great little dress for every day errands, lunch, etc. I probably going to buy it in another color."
5.0,absolutely loved it!
5.0,They are very vibrant colors and the length were perfect for my braids!! They kept my braids fresh for 3 weeks straight!
5.0,"Beautiful ring!  Well worth the price!  I ordered a size 6, I always wear a 6.  I could put the ring on, but it was to tight and could not bend my finger.  So I ordered a 7 instead, hopefully the ring will fit better.  I think because the ring is so long in length that it just fits tighter."
5.0,"Arrived very quickly in good condition, looked exactly like the picture. Love it!❤️"
5.0,"Unique and different, easy to wear, and comfortable."
5.0,Work related
5.0,cute and fits well. just as the picture. i like it
5.0,Very nice watch and very good price when compared to buying from a store.
5.0,"I am frequent buyer of these glasses, and I am always satisfied with my purchase!"
5.0,"I am 64, 5'1&#34; and 119 lbs. Got a small and they are perfect! I love the material it makes you look awesome. Really the best workout pant i own they really hold you tight!"
5.0,I ordered these and ran my first 10K in them! The most comfortable tennis shoe I’ve ever owned and the most affordable! I will definitely buy a new pair when mine wear out. So far I’ve had them for a year with regular wear and they are holding up fantastically!
5.0,This was inexpensive and good quality. It's bright and fun! I'm glad I purchased it!
5.0,These are amazing and I recommend to anyone that has to be on their feet all day or night. I could not be more please with my purchase.
5.0,Nice quality and great fit
5.0,Excellent product for the price I paid!
5.0,"I was impressed with the shape of this dress. It fits so comfortable and looks so beautiful.  I'm a size 10/12 pants and a Large for shirts. I'm 5'5"" and ordered a size XL. It fit loose and comfortable but I exchanged it for a size L and it fits perfect now."
5.0,"Love these earrings, the color is beautiful and I love the design around the stone. They are light enough that I can hardle tell that I have them on. Definitely would buy again."
5.0,These work great. I used them to catch a wild cat who has ear mites and needed care. I also used them to catch some wild kittens who needed care.
5.0,Looks just like the picture! Great tie!
5.0,These were just what I was looking for. Really nice variety of colors and the quality is that same as the bows you find in boutiques for a fraction of the price. Would definitely recommended!
5.0,Fit is true. Well made and comfortable.
5.0,"Great sweater , soft and slouchy and a wonderful value."
5.0,Really functional product. I'm pretty sure these are made by Alaskan Guide Creations being as how their logo is on the harness. This pack not only keeps your binos protected and handy but also has a ton of storage for small stuff you want to keep easily accessible. Quality made product! Would highly recommend... You want be disappointed!
5.0,"I LOVE these caps! They are super light weight and you don't even notice it's on, but tie down well so it does not come off every time I take off my PAPR. I have a lot of hair and the cap is big enough to let me tuck all my hair inside and still cover the base of my hairline. Monday was my first day with it and such a relief. I wasn't having to constantly readjust a hair net and then subsequently my mask straps every time I took my PAPR off. Because my head is smaller ill have to move the buttons up as I actually have to fold the edge of my cap up, but that is small thing compared to how great this is. It's super comfy and terrific value!"
5.0,Bought it for a friend and she loves it
5.0,"Plush , plush, plush!!! So soft and the quality is excellent. It’s not too heavy . I am a robe collector- this one is the new fav.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
5.0,"Great product, good value!"
5.0,Beautiful item!
5.0,My wife looks so pretty in this
5.0,They're just as I imagined
5.0,Exactly as described and comfortable to wear!
5.0,Material is so soft! Wear great and don't ride up your leg! They fit perfect
5.0,The necklace is pretty and well made. I love it!
5.0,Great tape. I use them on my mask to keep my glasses from fogging up. Make sure to lotion your face first or its like ripping a bandage off. Tape sticks good!! Bought 2 sets! 4 stars on comfort because it painfully sticks too well. Hahaha. I'd buy it a 3rd time!!
5.0,"Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of pricey watches.  It tells time, date and has a good stopwatch and one alarm.  Nothing fancy here but it works fine and looks cool.  Can't beat it for $13.  If it gets destroyed, who cares?"
5.0,Bought as a gift mad now i want one
5.0,"I like it, but I think either they should make it smaller or have two sizes"
5.0,Like be it! Bought one in gray for a friend they love it too.  Inside nice and roomy for all my things
5.0,exactly as picture! My boyfriend loves them!
5.0,"Such great quality, and light weight! Already ordering more pairs in different colors!"
5.0,"Too darned cute and I got one for my son, too. Mine lives on my walker and I have received tons of compliments on him."
5.0,Fits to size! Perfect! Highly recommended
5.0,Fits perfectly; Lots of compliments!
5.0,This suit is made of premium quality material and stretches alot.  It is definitely worth the money you will be happy.
5.0,I love how it fit and got compliments on the dress.
5.0,Love these sunglasses!
5.0,This item came almost a week ahead of schedule! Very happy!! The champagne color is also beautiful!!
5.0,Thank you to those who made this. Perfect fit. Perfect logo. Love it ready for 80's parties
5.0,This dress is super cute and comfortable and can be paired with leggings or even skinny jeans. Super easy to dress<br />Up and the price is amazing.<br />I bought two!
5.0,Love these readers! Gave some colors to my friends! I kept the blue. Very good buy for the money!
5.0,I was concerned about how they would do/be. I bought ones on sale just in case they wouldn't be all that. Well I wore them to work Friday and then to Shinedown concert. Here's the deal I am very impressed!!! My feet do not hurt!! I have been dealing with bad case  of plantar fasciitis. I really like these shoes a little on wild side look for me but I am genuinely happy with these shoes!!!
5.0,"These fit very well, I am fairly tall, 6'4"" and these are a great fit and the pockets are nice and roomy."
5.0,great item ad a great gift good quailty
5.0,I have ordered 4 pair of sunglasses from here and all of them are amazing!
5.0,"Wow! Not sure if its truly 'gold-plated'; but it is nice & looks awfully good next to my other pocket watches, in the same price range. In real life, you do NOT get that black cut-out effect - just a very nicely subdued, not brassy, gold-look. The white hands are easy to pick out for time-telling purposes, it's as accurate as any of my other 17J Chinese watches - which, since they aren't Rolexes, is pretty d***** good & for the minutes it gains every week, it's easy to adjust.. I now have over a dozen of these inexpensive 17J Chinese pocket watches now & with one exception, they all work reasonably well. And I get a smile on my face every time I open the wooden box they're stored in & hear them ticking away - to me its amazing that we are able to produce such intricate, delicate time-pieces as such a low price-point. I have one Manchda model which after dropping on a hard floor, I subjected to my inexperienced watch-repair methods in order to replace a digit that was literally floating around inside the mechanism - this hardy piece endured my attack, never stopped ticking during the whole 20 min. (or so) of the operation & continues to tick along. I have a few 17J Swiss models that should behave so well!!!"
5.0,"Nice, very roomy"
5.0,Got my room mate to order me this and when it came it it looked off but when I tried it on it fit comfortable AF I am pretty sure this would work in Warmer climates like Hawaii or SoCal but I recommend this especially for Social distancing at night
5.0,Good for when you need to undertake water sports. I use this every time I surf. It's a high quality product and has not shown any signs of failure.
5.0,better than I expected.
5.0,I love Nightmare before Christmas BB it usually never buy alot of merchandise because it is very expensive. But my husband got me this because he knew I would love it and I do.
5.0,Arrived earlier than expected and was as promised

5.0,I look so sassy on this pair of gold aviator sunglasses.
5.0,I love this piece very much.  I tend to wear only black and this looks fabulous and definitely way more expensive looking than I paid for it.  Received numerous compliments with women wanting to know where I got it.
5.0,Tool works!
5.0,Granddaughters loved them.
5.0,"Love it. Soft, fits great & the color is fantastic"

5.0,I know they fit the wire earpieces on my regular glasses as well as the wide earpieces on my Ray Ban Wayfarers so I imagine they will fit just about any style of glasses?  The strap is light and comfortable on your ears and is plenty long enough so that you can slide the connector way up on the earpieces to hold your glasses securely.  I recommend these eyeglass straps completely.
5.0,"Very pretty necklace on a card with a beautiful saying , very nice:)"
5.0,"At first I was unsure about this top. The material was different than I imagined. Kinda both satin-silky like. I ordered the red, but it’s definitely more orange than red. Also, it’s very loose, and at first I thought it looked funny on me. I went ahead and packed it for my beach vacation, and I’m glad I did. I initially tried it at home with jeans and shorts, but it’s very cute with jeggings and with hair up. I felt cute and comfortable. Effortless. I got a lot of compliments, including from some guys in our group. One said he really loved the “orange”. So yeah. Definitely more orange. For reference, I wear an xsmall in misses shirts. M in juniors. 32B chest. I ordered the small."
5.0,"It is beautiful, and manly looking. It is a great ring for the money."
5.0,"These rubber shoes worked very well with my Elf costume.  However, be warned, they are only good for one wearing especially if you are outside.  The shoes I received did not have the ball tassel on them, but the store called me to let me know.  Great customer service."
5.0,Just as pictured! The good part is super adorable also. The shorts are a bit on the thin side which is the only thing I'd note.<br /><br />I'm a 4-6 US and this fit really well.
5.0,This product fits just right as a sundress on my cruise .
5.0,"Love love this dress.  The sleeves are a bit short, but th3 fabric is thick and looks adorable!"
5.0,The gift was greatly appreciated
5.0,"I bought the black 2-pack working caps. My hair is slightly below shoulder length and is comfortably contained in the pouch. If you have very long and thick hair, the pouch may not fit comfortably. I've ordered this on 2 separate occasions and the terry cloth in the band was different for each order. I did not mind since the cloth felt similar enough to not be an issue. For solid dark colored caps, you may need a lint brush as the outer cloth attracts lint and it stands out noticeably."
5.0,This is my second dress from Homeyee and I’m really satisfied with my purchase one more time! Great dress for work!
5.0,Sized right and lined
5.0,"Cute and fits as expected. I love that the ball is removable, it can totally change the look"
5.0,Gifted with a big smile and a thankyou
5.0,I being from NZ could not be happier
5.0,Beautiful bag for the money
5.0,My father loves his new hat. He wears it everyday.
5.0,They look very stylish!
5.0,But it look just like the picture
5.0,"I'm 6 foot tall, 198 pounds.  The Large fit perfectly, about 1inch over the top of my foot; not droopy like the illustration shows. It was was snug but not too tight.  Light weight flannel, not heavy like one would get in sweat pants.  Heavier than the light cotton in Haynes men's Solid Knit Pant which I also ordered.  Haynes had about 3  inches over the top of my foot.  I kept them both, but I ordered a second one of these.  This is good for cool weather; in hot summer the Haynes would be more comfortable because the fabric is about the weight of a tee shirt."
5.0,"So I bought this specifically for my Colorado trip. I was very much worried whether the windy weather is gonna make my ears numb. But this product was a lifesaver. It completely covered my head and also my ears thereby saving me from the harsh weather. Plus, the bluetooth speaker is also helpful when you want to listen to some music as the need for manually holding the phone is not there. Worth the price !"
5.0,Muy lindo pero me quedó pequeño del pecho 🙁🙁🙁
5.0,Great fit. Soft material. Washed and dry no shrinking.
5.0,Good sneakers arrived on time and fit as expected.
5.0,They fit my granddaughter perfect. Very well made.
5.0,It was fantastic!
5.0,They are the perfect size! I have a allergy with fake jewelry and these I can actually sleep in without a problem!
5.0,very soft and nice material
5.0,Absolutely love it ! Will buy more colors content://media/external/file/8734
5.0,"This shirt is perfect! I do a lot of yoga, running, and lifting weights and this shirt has lasted through it all. I've only had it for 2 weeks but I definitely plan on buying more in different colors! I'm 5'8 170lbs and o bought a large and it fits great."
5.0,"Fantastic costume for the money. Looks sick! It’s not necessarily “thick” or too “warm”, but it’s a costume. Is it really supposed to be? I mean, it’s not the thinnest in the world for a costume either. It is as expected. And I’m very pleased with the look of it!"
5.0,Bought this for my daughter's apple watch series 1.  Very easy to put on and looks so cute!  She has received many compliments.  I would definitely purchase again.
5.0,"Just like shown in the picture. They are cute and discreet, I like them very much."
5.0,Bracelet is gorgeous!
5.0,My necklace arrived early. I ordered 2 prayer box necklaces. This necklace is everything I was looking for and then some. Its has a magnet to keep it closed. I replaced the scroll with the scripture on it with my own personal wish. I have gotten numerous complements on it. I love it. I am considering buying 2 more for 2 more wishes. I recommend it to everybody. Its very reasonably priced. I wear it everywhere I go.
5.0,Quality belt that comes with a hole punch tool (for extra belt holes) and a nice bag!  Good material and craftsmanship without the high price.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:5139b27cde3ec537f7a513aa4662bc3]] Great replica to band into replicating. Strong magnet and comfortable
5.0,I love this shirt! It washes well and fits great! Light weight too. Nice material! I want more of them!
5.0,Use it as a neck gaiter and it works just fine. It's soft and looks like it will last a while. Thanks!
5.0,I had some years ago loved them so we will see how long these new ones last<br />I think they are what I was looking for and I am happy so far
5.0,"These and all Wittnauer watches have been out of production for a couple of years. Bulova and Wittnauer have been owned by Citizen since 2008. Citizen brought the Wittnauer name out of retirement a few years ago to try to expand their upscale fashion offerings without success. They pulled the plug and this and the other Wittnauers are all old stock as of this writing. Expect the battery to be near depleted upon arrival as a result. However, I wouldn't downrate this watch for that. It's worth spending a few dollars to replace the battery when you get it considering the watch you are getting. Mine actually came with a spacer placed beneath the crown to keep the battery from being depleted, however. I'll probably replace it soon anyway.<br /><br />So what are you getting? A well-built quality watch made by Citizen with a Citizen Miyota quartz movement with an actual sapphire crystal. Good luck finding another watch anywhere near this price (20 bucks, seriously?) with a sapphire crystal.  Heck, there are very few Citizen or Bulova watches that use sapphire and they are all $300+ at typical sale prices. The way I scratch up the usual mineral crystal, this watch is worth it just for that.  Case is very solid and well built. No you don't get eco-drive as Citizen keeps that feature for their own brand, but standard Citizen Miyota movements are about as durable as they come. So if you can get past the possibility of getting one with a dead battery, go for it."
5.0,I love the hat I love the look I love the fit awesome!
5.0,It’s too long for a crop top but a bit short at the waist
5.0,"It is just slightly too small! But I can fit it. But it’s not their fault, I’m just a puffy extra large!! :-) but otherwise I’ve worn it for two days and gotten compliments each day! I also like it! It’s puffy too, so be warned! Lol!"
5.0,Very soft and comfortable material! Nice shape for the body and cool during workouts! I plan on ordering more!!
5.0,"It's durable and comfortable.  It has plenty of extra pockets. It also has a hole for the water tube to come through, allowing you to zip up the pocket with the water bladder in it, keeping it insulated and cold.  The water bladder also has a large opening, making it easy to fill, clean and add ice cubes.  I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,"If you are on the fence about this dress, get it!!! You will not be disappointed. I am 5’3 190lbs and I bought a size large. The fit is perfect and the length just touches the floor and I am still able to wear flats without the dress dragging. I am in the middle of my weight-loss journey and have already lost 72lbs (woot-woot). It has been decades since I have been able to wear a dress that makes me feel beautiful and this dress does just that! As I lose more weight, I will definitely be buying more."
5.0,Can be used with any pants
5.0,It was super cute and I hadn’t realized it came with its own belt so it made it better to tighten it. Really cute
5.0,"Sooo soft and comfortable with a great fit, I could buy in every color"
5.0,"These are absolutely perfect. They are super teeny-tiny, just like I wanted them to be. As several others have said, they're great for a second hole. I'll definitely be ordering the yellow gold ones in the near future! I'm so happy I found real gold earrings for my second hole without having to pay an arm and a leg. I'm so happy with this purchase."
5.0,My husband loves these.
5.0,"I wanted some simple gloves for the colder weather so decided to try these out. They’re well made, comfortable, fit my smaller-sized hands and work with touchscreens. Not to mention affordable. What more could I ask for?"
5.0,"I like this style of bedroom slipper and have difficulty finding them.  I like the quality of this slipper and the comfort. These are what I wear in the summer time, so glad to find them"
5.0,It’s nice but a little taller than I expected
5.0,Perfect for work and super comfortable. I move a lot and this dress allowed me the freedom to do that with ease.
5.0,I love this purse it is even better then I thought it would be.
5.0,"Love these!  They work great, feel very comfortable, wash well and go with almost all my pants :)"
5.0,So comfortable. Stay put - no creeping. Very affordable. Love these!
5.0,I do not dislike anything about this nightgown.  I relax in it and sleep in it.
5.0,"Great product, 47 is a bit long for a size 30-32 waist. Will order another in the shorter length."
5.0,"These masks are stamped as KN 95 although nothing is mentioned in the description, so just FYI. I am not sure if these meet KN 95 standard but they are a good fit, Five layers, ear loops are strongly fixed to the mask and nose adjustment works well. This mask is designed to keep the air from coming in sideways; its sides go tightly against your face and allow less air to come through compared to the regular disposable three ply masks. This is a pack of 20; with 5 masks per individual pack, total of 4 packs inside."
5.0,"I purchased this for my friend - He's typically a XXL, and this fits very loosely on him, and he's able to put several layers on underneath. It's soft and fairly thin (not bulky). So far, very good purchase, especially for the price!"
5.0,Just love it! Love the heavy and stretchy material!  I hope all their products are like this one.
5.0,"Super cute bathing suit, but sizes are way off. I am a 34 DD and normally wear medium in tops and pants. Based on the other recommendations from previous purchasers I got an XL, which does fit in the cup, but the band is too big. It's easy to sew it and make it tighter though, so it's not a big deal. Overall , very happy with the purchase"
5.0,Me gustó mucho lo puedo cambiar fácilmente.
5.0,"If you love Snoopy, this is a must have.  I wore it to work (I work in a preschool) and the kids loved it."
5.0,"I usually am a medium but in this the XL fit perfectly, well made, looks good and arrived ahead of schedule. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Very nice well made belt
5.0,Perfect for my granddaughter going in to first grade.
5.0,Girlfriend loves it and looks great in it!! Excellent shirt!
5.0,Very good  wallet and very convinient..<br /> Thank you much
5.0,Nice keyring
5.0,The Marino ratchet belt is very easy to size and to use. It works well and looks great.
5.0,This is so close to a high end sapphire that people think it's a Tanzanite. It's such an unusual color that people don't think it's a lab gem.
5.0,works will and cleans your cowboy hats wonderfully! great gift for my dad!
5.0,Cute and functional! My 7.5 year old loves them!
5.0,These cuff links were a great Christmas gift for my Oregon loving boyfriend! They shipped very quickly and looked just like the picture. Good quality for a great price.
5.0,Fun shirt! Bought these for my team for an obstacle run.
5.0,"I loved it! I hope this suit becomes available again. I would like to order another. Yes it is built for a small frame but for my personal shape (I have a 29in strap size, but 32B) it fit like a glove. Better than any suit I have gotten. I have had no problems with the closure and it stays clasped, I have had it for an entire year now. Great price for a great suit."
5.0,Shimmery and a bit weighty. I am actually impressed with the quality for the price.
5.0,"Makes me feel really sexy.  Love the fit, feel, and shape.  Have received so many lovely comments from other CD's."
5.0,A beautiful dress for summer time
5.0,"I'm 5'3"", about 132 lbs and this costume fit me perfectly. The length is mid thigh on me. I'm a 34D bust and it was an exact fit. Very comfy. I'm going to wear a white long sleeve compression shirt under it so I don't freeze at night."
5.0,Very cute workout top or just for everyday wear. Got compliments on the green color.
5.0,Love these! Wore them throughout my whole pregnancy. Love love love them!
5.0,Very nice. High quality and stylish.
5.0,Great Vintage style shirt with shoulder pads. Love the look
5.0,I was very surprised at the quality of this set of earrings. The stones are clear and the mountings are better than I thought they would be. I am currently wearing the 7 and 6 mm size. The only reason I am not wearing the 8 mm is because my piercings are close together and the earrings were actually touching in one of my ears. I may switch to the 8 mm and wear the 4 or 5 mm with them.  The negatives are the backs are very small so I changed them with some stainless steel backs that I already have. The other is that the posts are very thin and they might break if you change the earrings very often but at this price they are definitely worth buying several sets.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my niece(the girl who has everything) and was worried that she wouldn’t like it because she has a large and wealthy family that gives her the best of everything, even jewelry. I was afraid it would look like it was cheaply made but when it arrived it was so precious and prettier than the photos! She’s had it for a while now and she hasn’t taken it off once yet. She even prefers this over her multiple hundred dollar necklaces. It’s also durable because she plays multiple sports and she wears it while playing.Highly recommended"
5.0,"So far these are my closest align dupe to date. I am 5’5 155 waist 29 and Large fits perfectly. Hits right above my ankle, I tried the 29’s and they were too long"
5.0,I love these chokers! I was looking other places for them but couldn't find any I liked that were worth the price. There are different styles and different &#34;vibes&#34; with each choker. They are good quality and have an adjustable chain for 5/6 chokers. I would recommend these to anyone
5.0,"I do not do yoga but I do run around in my socks all day and with laminate floors  my socks were getting holes in them quite quickly.  These not only protect my socks, they are skid resistance as well.  Will have a supply of them on hand all the time now."
5.0,This is a must buy!  Absolutely beautiful top!!
5.0,Un poco grande me quedó pero bien
5.0,Very nice joggers for the gym or casual. I have a 34” inseam and a medium was long enough
5.0,These slippers are warm and comfy. The size guide was confusing so I ended up ordering big ones and I'm glad I did. They are roomy and easy to put on and take off. Genuine shearling is the way to go if you really want a warm slipper and I couldn't be happier.
5.0,These were excellent quality and a great value.
5.0,"Loved this shirt as a teen, great to find it now.  Quality of shirt is top notch.  Not too heavy, not thin - just perfect.  Survived many washes and drier visits.  Would buy again and sooner if I would have thought of it!"
5.0,Gave as a gift. She loves it and it fits just right
5.0,These do a great job of keeping my sunglasses on me and it's water friendly!
5.0,excellent value! arrived earlier than estimated
5.0,Great duffel! Lotsss of room definitely enough room for one person!
5.0,The product is very good. the length is just right. it is easy to use when going out. and there is no need to look for glasses everywhere. Logistics is also fast. Will patronize if necessary in the future.
5.0,"Can't say more, these are beautiful! ordered one set just to check out the quality, now ordering the rest for my bridal party, they are perfect!"
5.0,"Shoes very comfortable, used because of planters fasciitis."
5.0,"nice. could use a liner, but nice"
5.0,Very pleased with this top.<br />Fit True To Size!!
5.0,Super cute necklace! Great quality!
5.0,This is a very nice sweater.  I love the way the sleeves puff at the shoulders and give a more defined silhouette.  It is a good length and a nice fit.  I feel it is true to size.  For reference I am 5’3”  145lbs and I ordered a large.  It is very good material and very well made.  It launders well and the color goes with so much stuff!  I am so happy I choose this and have worn it a lot.  I would highly recommend this sweater.
5.0,"As I use it for sea kayaking, the floatability and retaining cords are the big attraction. It's a good looking hat with high quality. The secret pocket is a plus. While there are models with more high tech materials, I prefer this retro classic. I'm tempted to buy a supply in case they discontinue the cotton line."
5.0,"garnet is my birthstone, have been searching for this, beautiful, great fit, stylish, would recommend to anyone, great price"
5.0,I love the color and the cap. I am big New York Yankees Fan. I cannot wait to wear the cap for my Hawaii Trip to represent NYC.
5.0,A+++  Love this wallet... well made!  :)
5.0,Is a gift for my boss who is retiring.  The watch is exceeding my expectations.  Is a good looking whatch.  The way is presented is like Rolex quality.
5.0,"Like that it is stretchy..  the Paracord material on my last one , if it got caught in machinery at work, could rip my neck off. Stretchy is actually safer"
5.0,I love these! They are super high waisted. Lots of stretch. Comparable to the high waisted old navy activewear leggings (I wear a medium in those) but with the added bonus of no uncomfortable crotch seam! For reference I am 140 lbs. Pear shape. About a 27 or 28 in waist and the S/M fits perfectly. I am curious to see how these hold up over the long term and in the wash. But first impressions is that I am very satisfied with these.
5.0,"Love this top-would order more in other colors. Fits great, is soft fabric & washes well."
5.0,Fit great lol and feel comfortable
5.0,"These leotards are really high quality and fit really well provided you size up. My daughter is a pretty average sized 3-year-old (36 inches tall and about 30 lbs) and I bought her the 4-6 size because previously I bought her the size that I expected to fit her (2 - 4T) and it was tight on her. If you size up, these leotards are great. I've also purchased the tank version of Capezio leotards and love them too."
5.0,Loved this!! Fit as expected!!
5.0,Very comfortable & dressy for pagamas. I love them!
5.0,"Top not product and service. My original package was stolen off my front porch, which is no fault of the company, and Tom S. of Brusa distributing went above and beyond and sent me another pair free of charge. You just don't find that quality of service anymore. Sandals fit as expected and are much lighter and supportive than I believed they would be. Perfect for showering in the gym or visiting the beach!"
5.0,"I alsolutely love this shirt! My order came right away and my shirt fits great and the quality is good. You could say sleeves are a little snug, but not much of a bother at all. I would personally recomend this shirt"
5.0,Got for my mom and she loved it it was true to size!
5.0,"I used it on my recent trip to Europe.<br />It was light weight but big enough to carry everything I needed for the day, small camera, water, glasses, compact rain jacket and pants.<br />Also, it was big enough to carry some small souvenirs - books that were ~ 9x12.  It can easily swing around to the front so that you can get at the items or hold the contents in front of you - crowed placed, palaces, etc.<br />I highly recommend this for travelers looking for a comfortable, lightweight day pack."
5.0,Plenty space .. nice one .. good choice
5.0,Beware that like they say the fabric is thick.  BUT it makes the dress keep the style.  Looks very elegant.  The small dots are silver (a bit shiny).  So far I find the BASIC MODEL dresses worth it.  I like them.  Quality stuff.
5.0,"They had so much fun, the 18 yr old and 8 yr old both."
5.0,These fit well and are quite comfortable
5.0,"It's a great necklace and it's nice and subtle. Just a nice little touch of style, but not too bold. I would've wanted to chain a little shorter, but it's still a good length."
5.0,These shoes are so cute.  My 3yo daughter was so excited when I showed her them. They fit well and the strap around the ankle keeps them on right too. I bought these to go with her Christmas outfit but she loves them for playing dress up too.
5.0,I love this hat! It is so warm and soft that I actually look forward to cold days!
5.0,"Awesome watch, it's worth the price. I use it for work and it's not a big watch which makes it more comfortable."
5.0,"Super comfortable, good support, very soft texture"
5.0,IT FITS AMAZING..... I WAS A LITTLE BIT AFRAID.... BUT I TRULY LOVE IT
5.0,These socks are hard to get to stretch over my heal.  They probably would work if you can get the on.
5.0,Appears really well made. Great for gym workouts or exercise.  Dry quickly. Look great.  Very pleased with shorts.
5.0,"I love this thing - it makes taking the watch on and off a fraction-of-a-second thing.  No muss, no fuss.  It keeps it's shape and lets the watch sit up on the bedside table when it is charging.  It looks great, and it makes my apple watch look unique.  The quality is top notch, which is good, because it costs way more than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />I got the medium/large band because i was near the top end of the measurements and I initially thought it was too small.  Spiedel sent me some extra links for free.  I didn't want to install them myself and even the watch repair guy seemed to dread the installation.  Instead, I wore the band at factory length and have decided ti fits as-is (lucky me, for now).  The instructions for expanding or shrinking the band do look truly daunting, so definitely measure your wrist and get the right size."
5.0,I've Been a Demolition Union laboror for awhile and Hands Down these Socks are the Bomb 💪🇺🇸 🦅
5.0,It's great love it
5.0,My husband loves them I will be ordering for his crew at work. He said they are really soft and you can breathe through them.
5.0,It was a hit with 11 yr old and his x-box player days
5.0,"Great no show socks for boat shoes. Grippers on the bottom help socks from slipping and sliding within the shoe...and on our wood floors. Decent quality, overall very good purchase."
5.0,"Really good!!! I loved this underwear, the right color and size."
5.0,"purse a little bigger than I thought, but is a nece purse anyway"
5.0,It is way better than I expected! Worth every penny :) I dont know if ill be able to wait until my husbands birthday to give it to him haha!
5.0,"My children needed black headbands for a spring parade that is often chilly. These stayed up and kept them warm throughout. Previous parades have ended with them having chilly ears, but not this year! Thanks for a good product."
5.0,I have a lot of plastic containers stored under tables and these stick on wheels have been the perfect solution.
5.0,Good price for compression socks.
5.0,"Comfortable, cute and easy to put on!"
5.0,I ordered a size bigger than what my husband actually wears and they fit him. I would definitely size up 1 size .
5.0,"Excelente reloj, Oris es una gran marca y esta referencia no es la excepción. La calidad de estos relojes salta a la vista, son una joya que además de lucir da la hora."
5.0,My hospital stay
5.0,Wear these pants all the time for work. Haven't failed me yet. Lots of pockets and plenty of breathing room.
5.0,This was a gift for our Granddaughter  she loved it.
5.0,"It’s super duper cute and looks exactly like the photos :) I am 5’10, 160lbs and got a size medium and it fits great!! It’s not see through and is a great length! Super duper impressed and am so happy with this purchase!! :)"
5.0,"Nice thick stiff nylon band, seems very well constructed.  If I had to change anything (nitpicking now)  it would be that the included springbars insert fairly shallowly which is fine for a watch with a metal case, but I am using this on a Pebble 2 which is plastic.  The springbars on the silicone strap included with the Pebble insert deeper than these springbars. My only fear is that in time the bar could distort the plastic if pulled hard enough.  I could always get different springbars and keep the strap, but I am using the included ones for now."
5.0,Arrived as expected. Very cute t-shirt!
5.0,My mom loves this who is a first time Oma! She wears it's everyday!
5.0,Beautiful! Wore for a wedding and everyone loved it.
5.0,Good looking watch. Looks expensive.
5.0,Love it! Perfect to carry the things I need for work etc.
5.0,Cutest lil thing he says when it's being worn
5.0,Pretty have only worn once and got a  complement
5.0,"I am 5'3' and weigh almost 300 pounds<br />The length is long, but with the adjustable fold down top makes the length I need<br />The fit around is fine"
5.0,Very cute! Scent is not as strong as the ones with the pads.
5.0,Carters is a great product. Can not go wrong. Soft and cozy. Not too heavy or bulky.
5.0,"Use for working out, going to the lake or casual day"
5.0,Haven’t used yet.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:2b209fb055529597f62aeab376ef6d13]] These are beautiful in person! Great size and quality. Product as described.
5.0,"Item as described and arrived on time, great transaction!"
5.0,It's hanging proudly above my tv.
5.0,Great quality and price. Good size for a kid or adult.
5.0,"Very sleek and sexy! Wish they were less expensive, but good for special occasions."
5.0,Great for winter
5.0,This is a nice face mask of good quality. Not flimsy and disposable like a lot of other halloween and costume products.
5.0,"I purchased it in it's smallest size to fit my 12 year old son, the 34. He is wearing uniforms to school and needed a black belt that would last a whole school year. From the quality of this one, I would say that this wil last beyond that. We typically but store brand belts, which even in leather do not hold up.<br />I did have to make an extra hole for him. And that took some time. It was very difficult to make without being aggressive an ruining the belt. I used a knife and put the belt on a hard surface and spun the knife around until I was all the way through. Then I did the same after i flipped it over. The hole was still small and so I used the belt tab thing to widen it. It came out pretty good and it hasnt streched out in the month its been since I made the hole.<br />Overall, this belt has exceeded my expectations for it and would definitely reccomend to those who are skeptical or wary of buying from the internet. This is quality leather.<br />I recieved a promotional discount on this belt with the promise to review it for Boston Leather and provide them with valuable feedback on thier product."
5.0,Fit perfect and just as described! Quick shipment. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"This is cute.  I really like the layered look.  That being said, it is not expensive jewelry, so it is not going to look like expensive jewelry.  It is a sexy, cute, fun layered necklace and I am going to have some fun with this!<br /><br />I have purchased this and was fortunate enough to receive a discount in exchange for providing my unbiased review."
5.0,"I was hesitant when I ordered this dress but it exceeded all my expectations! The fit is perfect, the length is perfect, and the material is great!!  Couldn’t possibly say enough good things about this dress."
5.0,Very cool thanks
5.0,Sturdy jewelery and proper sizing. Balls have metal threading in them unlike a lot of jewlery that breaks easily.
5.0,I love the necklace and saying.  Wasn't too crazy about the clear bag it came in.  Better if in a gift box
5.0,Love this top...Its very flattering.  The material is good quality... I usually wear a M and this XL fits perfect... Wish there were more colors available.

5.0,I’m in love my Daughter in law is going to love it
5.0,"It's soft and cute, and I love the chin strap!  It does run a bit big though; the X-Large size which indicates 4 - 6 years old fits both myself (5'3"" female) and my husband (5'11"" male)."
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves these gloves. They are a must for her when she rides her quad, as he them starts hurting when barehanded from pressing the throttle. These have held up well, and the price for them (I paid $11) were amazing!"
5.0,Love the material great quality
5.0,Just the right length.
5.0,Love It!  Works great and is a great visual!!
5.0,Its a gift for my mom.  She will love it.  Great price 👍  worth buy trust me
5.0,"Second purchase of a hat from the same company, no complaints"
5.0,Absolutely love this shirt! I am 6' 172lbs and don't like tight or baggy fitting clothing this was perfect for me. And arrived on time for motoGP weekend in Austin TX
5.0,I bought these for the cargo net in my SUV. They do the job well and seem well-constructed.
5.0,Super cute but the material is a little raw against my skin
5.0,All is good!!!
5.0,Great purchase. Received it in 2 days on prime. Will purchase more in different colors
5.0,"Great sunglasses. Good protection from sun,most importantly"
5.0,Oh I love everything about this dress. Its length and the feel of the material... very nice!!!
5.0,Love the colors and matching cufflinks
5.0,"Genuine leather strap/watchband made by Red Wing in USA.  Accurate time, indiglo night light - takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!"
5.0,"The fit was somewhat small and I had difficulty putting them on.  However, I ran with them and felt no pain at all.  They are well worth the money."
5.0,Excellent choice great quality nice price great fit as I'm having your elastics at on stretch in the makes you look Slim it's just a little longer with like 4 inch heels was perfect
5.0,Bought for a basic black tie. Love the zipper tie so easy to use!
5.0,love this company order several products from the and will continue sizes are acurate and shipping is not too long
5.0,Really cute high tops. Granddaughter wouldn't wear right off as they were a bit large. Wearing now
5.0,"Bought this to wear after my elopement, & it looks like an elopement dress itself. I was surprised how well this dress was made, since they sell the same version at certain boutiques for more than $100. Definitely a great alternative."
5.0,These sunglasses are adorable and work fabulous! They fit great without sliding around. They have excellent sun coverage. I love that I can move around and not worry about them falling off or sun coming in from the sides. They came with a small carrying bag and a cloth to clean them. I highly recommend these. 💜
5.0,While I'm a male.. and haven't noticed it's healing properties.. it is a very lovely piece made of real moonstone!<br />The customer service is great to.. they didn't send me the selenite and responded immediately and it's on its way now!<br />Definitely a great gift or piece for energy work
5.0,"I can't say enough about these.  First purchased at a local scuba shop (had never heard of Peppers before then), and was amazed that they actually do float if you drop them in water, plus they're polarized (bonus!).  I've already experience the &#34;oh bleep&#34; moment once when they fell off the dive boat but was relieved to see they just floated there waiting for me to grab them.<br />Not every Peppers product floats but I'd definitely recommend seeking out those that do.  Even if you never go to a pool, beach, etc., you'll appreciate how incredibly lightweight they are.  Allergy sufferers, take note:  you know how heavy your glasses feel on the bridge of your nose when you're all clogged up?  These are what you need.  Seriously - they make that much of a difference.<br />This particular model hugs your face wraparound-style, so good for wind protection, plus the stems are slightly curved so when you push them up on your head they stay there.  There are also other color options, so check them out!"
5.0,"Fun accessory...a very nice accent to wear with casual outfits...just the right sparkle and it moves as you do.<br />Kinda sexy...only for a confident woman who knows herself and wants to add a bit of allure to her everyday<br />dress --- not, however for the office."
5.0,Design is as shown. Very cute and soft.
5.0,Good material deliver earlier than expected husband loves it!
5.0,"Got compliments all night! I wear a size L top & 14 bottom so I got the XL size & it fit great. Wore this to a business casual dinner paired with black heels & everyone was lovin it. It will need to be steamed when delivered due to the way the dress was packaged, but quality was actually better than expected. Lace had a slight stretch and the skirt landed just above my knees (I’m 5’3”). I would definitely buy again."
5.0,I normally wear a large and bought the extra large and it's a perfect fit. It has some flow to it. I received multiple compliments on it too. Very comfy.
5.0,Fit is great! My daughter in law love her shirt. The color dud not fade after washing.
5.0,These are comfortable and well made.  Nice looking shorts.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter who works  12 hr shifts as a nurse.  She loves them. I ordered 2 more pair for her. She said they make a big difference and keep her legs from being tired. I highly recommend then
5.0,Love them!!! Fits great and very comfortable for all day.
5.0,"I ride my bike quite often and these gloves are definitely perfect for that purpose.  The padding provides good comfort. They fit as expected and are made with high quality material. I can tell these gloves are very durable. They are made to last a long while! I also like to wear them, especially in this winter weather, give me some warm, yet, with the half fingers feature, I am still able to use phone, etc, without taking them out.<br />I also use them when I work on some tasks around the house.  They are comfortable to wear . They have a good grip to<br />them which makes work a little bit easier. These gloves don't tear easily and the stitching is perfect<br />that it doesn't look cheap. The straps also let you adjust how tight you want or shares with other when needed. Product received at discount in exchange for honest review."
5.0,"Wife & 10 yr old daughter tried on glasses, good fit.<br />Haven't been to range yet. So far so good. You get Two pair of glasses & ear plugs. Great Value.<br />Pull the trigger."
5.0,Bought it for my daughter. She loved it. Wants to buy another one. Hoping it comes back in stock!
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for a friends daughter and she LOVED IT! Per mom she always has her purse on
5.0,Bought these for my granddaughter she loves them they are well-built
5.0,These gloves are very soft and fit as expected. They kept my hands warm and I was so pleased that I could still use my phone! I would definitely recommend these gloves!
5.0,"Great fit with plenty of padding in the palm. Old gloves caused a lot of problems on long rides. My hand/wrist doesn't have tingling anymore. Really believes it minimizes the stress on the palm that would cause this feeling. Easy closure. Little snug in coming off, but not a big deal. Typically any sweaty glove will have the same effect. Item was sent to me for review purposes."
5.0,This shirt is of good quality and the logo is perfect.  Boston Strong and represents the Red Sox well.  The item was a gift for Christmas and it was perfect.
5.0,I love this dress and got so many compliments! I ordered my normal size of a medium and it fitted very well.
5.0,Good  quality. Great price.
5.0,Good purchase..fit great my grandson...

5.0,Granddaughter really like these and they are jist what she wanted for her Cosplay
5.0,I love this bracelet!  I only bought one because I wasn't sure if I would like it but turns out I love it so I will probably purchase another because they will definitely look better stacked with another or even a different bangle.  Very sparkly and love the way the crystals reflect.  Go ahead and purchase you won't be disappointed.
5.0,Love it! Nice and soft. Drapes nicely.
5.0,they are cheap but dont look too cheap.<br />the lens itself has been very good so far.<br />frames are impressively sturdy and have held up against my rugged lifestyle.<br />If i lose or break this pair i will just get another from them. happy with them for sure!
5.0,"I think this is the best wallet I've had.  I don't like bulky wallets.  I can hold enough cards and a few dollars in this, and just slip it into my purse or pocket.  The material is nice, like a soft leather suede, and the color is a nice beige/pink."
5.0,I really like the bracelet.  Thanks for fast shipping.  Priced just right.
5.0,"Both bands are extremely comfortable. I wear them both but mostly I wear the silver mesh one daily. Still in new condition, no problems at all. I highly recommend buying!!"
5.0,Beautiful. 😃
5.0,"Thin material,  but good length,  and extremely comfortabletrye to size fit."
5.0,LOVE the material!!

5.0,"Awesome dress, fit perfectly and looks great"
5.0,Love it fits very well could not be happier with it
5.0,My 3 year old Grandsons LOVE the pillowcases and totally LOVE their nicknames being on them!!! They know that none of their siblings can use it on their pillows by mistake. My daughter said that their eyes light up when they come home and see it on their beds 😊
5.0,Really adorable. My son loves them and they are pretty durable.
5.0,I loved 💓👏🏻
5.0,"Love these shirts! The fabric is so soft and the fit of the shirt is very flattering.  Seriously. Did I mention how nice the fabric feels? I have this in a couple for colors now for this reason.<br />I find the product fit true to size; however, I'm one for a looser fit and ordered a size up (large) to achieve that."
5.0,Great smart watch for young children who are Frozen II fanatics!
5.0,These socks are awesome!
5.0,The leather broke apart
5.0,These were what I was looking for I like them
5.0,A great mask. Well worth the extra few dollars for superior quality and protection. Will be the only ones I buy from now on.
5.0,Looks great with matching saree! Arrived on time.
5.0,Every PattyBoutik I’ve bought is excellent! 😀
5.0,"This a nice and roomy shirt, it has a bat wing style wearing a tank top underneath is must."
5.0,"Love this scarf.  It is light, and very pretty."
5.0,"Im in law enforcement, always looking for a good compression shirt for under my uniform, they breathe well, comfortable and don’t feel like they suffocate you. True to size medium. Does roll up on the bottom a little, but for the price and quality you can’t beat it"
5.0,These are so very comfortable!! I now have three styles of  Sanuk and am hooked!!
5.0,"Crazy comfy & soft. A little complex to put on but once you do it twice you pretty much have it down. It fits great everywhere except at my hips / stomach, where it's a little too small, but that's the area I buy clothes based on. Also - when you get it out of the package it reeks of dye, so be sure to wash it before wearing."
5.0,My wife loves the fit and comfort. Great gift for the winter months.
5.0,"My wife loved the design and shine of pendant, has the sparkle of a real diamond, would recommend to any one."
5.0,I like my bracelets very much. I thought they would be like the Lokai braclets but these are beaded ones instead. But I love them very much.
5.0,"Oh wow, didn’t expect it to be this nice! It’s an unusual but pleasant to the touch soft, stretchy fabric with just the right thickness to it. I’ll have to wear my bra straps a little to the side but it won’t be a huge issue. Flattering, appropriate for many occasions where you need a simple but classy black dress, and very comfy. I forgot it had plastic boning in it, it’s so comfy. Haven’t washed it yet so I may have to update this review if something bad happens during the wash, but I love it so far. Ordered a medium based off of reviews and that was definitely the right size. My measurements are 37 inches bust, 29 inches waist, 5’7’’ . Goes past the knees on me, so it might be a bit long on shorter ladies."
5.0,Great bag!  Authentic!  Perfect size to use inside backpack so I can find my stuff quickly!  Seller shipped fast!
5.0,"I really love this skirt, a Arrived early and it was the exact color in the image and it fits really great."
5.0,"Great dress! Will be ordering another! After reading reviews, I decided to order a small (typically I wear a medium). Glad I did! This dress fits great on my top, perfect at my waist, and is just the right length! I am 5'3 with a 34B chest. The dress hits just above my knees. Also, it has pockets!"
5.0,I loved this dress because it fitted like I expected it would. It was just my size. I wore it to church soon as I received it. The accuracy and fit was perfect. I would buy it again if I had to.
5.0,"Was nice, I didn’t have to use it, so I returned it."
5.0,Has worked very well for work.  Very secure yet my id can be seen easily.  We'll have to see how well it works when we get to the point where we have to card in with it!  I'm 5'5&#34; and had to tie a knot in the loop so it wouldn't hang down too low.
5.0,Beautiful and very sexy on. The fit is perfect.
5.0,"this little wallet is super cute!  It's not really what I would consdier mini - it seems like it's the size of a standard tri-fold wallet to me.  i thought it might be very thin or just large enough to hold some credit cards, but it seems like a normal wallet.  I love the little key ring on it, so my daughter has a place to put her house key on it.  the wallet is beautiful and seems well-made and sturdy."
5.0,In love with this top! Stylish  & very comfy!
5.0,The absolute best product for your baby!!! Socks do NOT come off!!!
5.0,Its fake but in low light you cant tell lol.
5.0,"My skin is super sensitive to cheap materials and my piercing holes will swell and puss (even after 15 years) if I wear low-quality posts.  I have had these earrings in for 5 days and nights straight, and they still feel good. They do look a lot like the picture, with maybe even a little more of a green &amp; red reflection in the light. I should have expected 4mm to be quite small--but I think they make the perfect size for a second hole piercing."
5.0,Great band for the price! Will deff be ordering more from this company! Arrived quickly and on time. Feels very secure when on. The coloring is just as pictured if not better! I have received many compliments while wearing it ! Worth the money!
5.0,i love all the different designs and shapes they have!!😇
5.0,"These sunglasses do the job, they have that wayfarer look but at a reasonable price."
5.0,"These are great aprons. The fabric is quite solid. I gave these as gifts to my in-laws and didn’t wash them first, but all of the other products that I’ve used from this company have been really durable, so I’m not worried. If they start to fade or unravel, I’ll update, but I doubt they will. They match a grocery bag I bought from BeeGreen perfectly 😊 The cutest."
5.0,"The slightly more expensive pair was sold out, so I bought these, and they are excellent."
5.0,"Got this for my wife. She liked it so much, I bought two for her."
5.0,"I dance and I needed these pants, they are really confortable"
5.0,I absolutely love Vince Carter. Best $120 I've ever spent. Exactly what I've been looking for.
5.0,"I’ve been wearing Reebok Princess shoes for decades in both the black and white, and take really good care of them. They are cleaned and polished regularly. The Shoeboy cleaner works great on them. I like that it doesn’t take much cleaner, so the bottle lasted a long time. The brush is great for cleaning the bottom and sides of the sole.<br /><br />Even though I like the product, it’s pricey, and there are other household cleaners that work just as well. I’m still giving it five stars because it does work, but, at that price, I won’t be buying it."
5.0,Quality made snap back !..All the way!
5.0,Really cute dress and really cool for summer time
5.0,High Quality! Genuinely happy!
5.0,"The package was in great condition and it is as advertised. This lil guy is the cutest thing, and I definitely need more now. I will cherish this cat."
5.0,Came quickly and is just as described. So comfy and kind of chunky
5.0,Nice but bigger than it looks
5.0,Had my mom try it on for pictures. It’s a great dress. Perfect quality and looks great.
5.0,Good pair changes from clear to sunglasses. Comes with a nice holster.
5.0,"These are good shopping bags.  They have a little stretch to them, which means you can fit in a lot of groceries without ripping the bag.  The handles fit over my shoulder without digging in and were a good length.  I have several now and they can carry gallons of milk without ripping.<br /><br />As for the compost ability, it will be some time before I can test that!"
5.0,"Everyone ask were I got it from!! Perfect price so.cute!!!! TOTALLY would buy again, which delivery even though it said later!!"
5.0,Bought it for my 10 years old daughter .She wears it with formal dresses and receives numerous compliments.
5.0,Works as described. Keeps sweat out of eyes and is very absorbant. I would buy again
5.0,I love this sweater. Fits perfect and construction is very nice. Soft
5.0,ADORE this pack!! The plugs are amazing quality and quantity for the price and would hands down recommend!
5.0,"love this, i have been having a hard time finding a scrub cap that fits around my bun. this one fits well and is very nice material. 👍🏻"
5.0,I love everything about this necklace! It's nice and heavy and the color goes with everything!
5.0,A very good buy.
5.0,this thing is huge but my wife loves it.
5.0,"UPDATE 9/19: So again, these are EXCELLENT masks for people with big faces (like me).<br /><br />The mask I tried at work was great. My HEPA filter cut outs fit in nicely. I was in a super market today and heard two people commenting on how much perfume this lady was wearing - didn’t smell a thing so it’s filtering out a lot and still breathable.<br /><br />The inner layer is a little scratchy. The ones I washed with fabric softener we’re super soft and fixed that immediately.<br /><br />I’m not a fan of the behind the ear thingy but these have a rubber mob (like on an eye glasses leash) making it adjustable for the tightness you prefer.<br /><br />I’m keeping one as is but I usually customize mine with a large over the head headband. For me: Holds them tighter and I can lower it to my neck when not in use.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I’ll submit a more in depth review over the weekend but I wanted to let people know these are EXCELLENT masks for people with big faces like me.<br /><br />Fits under my chin Over my check and nose and has an adjustable nose bridge.<br /><br />The filter pocket is great for the disposables they send you (I put in my fabric electrostatic HEPA filter in there. I swear they put lunch in front of me today and I didnt smell it until I removed my mask...and her still very breathable.<br /><br />I tried one today at work and washed the rest.<br /><br />I’ll let you know if a few days how that goes."
5.0,I think it runs small. I am glad I ordered a large which is perfect. I am 5'3&#34; and 118 lbs. Love the vest.
5.0,You get what you see
5.0,My sister loved her dress
5.0,This white hoodie fits nicely. It's not to big or to small it is the perfect length. Great look and very comfortable to wear.
5.0,I love these sweaters. So cute and soft. Great price.
5.0,This was as expected. I purchased it to wear with bathing suits and at the beach. I did not have high expectations and was pleasantly surprised.
5.0,"Great look, excellent quality, very comfortable, sexy, and fit perfectly. No regrets. ******!"
5.0,Excellent presentation and a beautiful product
5.0,"It is a little snug around d the arms, but otherwise my wife loves it. I got it as a birthday/mother's day gift for her."
5.0,Very pretty. Love it..
5.0,These gloves fit to my hands perfectly (sizing chart was right). I needed a pair before a Thanksgiving day race and was worried if i would receive them in time. They ended up getting to me a day before the earliest scheduled delivery date. A top notch company with fine leather and wonderful customer service! I would definitely buy these again.
5.0,"Well it won me the ugliest sweater contest at work, so job well done.  It does run small so order 1-2 sizes bigger.  Very comfy."
5.0,"I have bought at least four tungsten rings in my lifetime,  this one is one of my top two favorites.  I skateboard  so I need rings that don’t scratch. This ring has been put through hell and back and still looks amazing"
5.0,"My husband loves these glasses. It is impossible to find the larger sunglasses in stores. I've checked every rack in every store I've ever been in,  the ones for big boys<br />aren't there. Thank you."
5.0,My grandson absolutely loves these slippers
5.0,Love this shirt.  Very comfortable and I receive compliments every time that I wear it.  The only complaint is the price.  Expensive.
5.0,"These are terrific , light & enough warth during the fall evenings"
5.0,comfy hold up nice and help for my long 12 hour shifts
5.0,Perfect for the gym
5.0,"It was gift for my niece, but apparently, she loves it!"
5.0,pretty picture on bag
5.0,Very happy.
5.0,"Great slippers, bought them for a birthday present. Thought they were going to be heavy but they are very light and comfortable."
5.0,I was hesitant about purchasing these goggles because I never had much luck. with them. I have been using them for recreational swimming.  They do work very well at holding water out and not fogging up. They fit well on me as well. Very pleased with the purchase. I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
5.0,Love Them !!
5.0,I bought 3 of these for each one of my granddaughters. These are their Christmas presents. Very nice.
5.0,The best fox fur pom pom that I have seen so far. Very full.  Excellent service. I love it!
5.0,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.<br /><br />I've recently been getting into doing wire wrapping for jewelry and when I found this via Amazon I thought I would give them a try, and these exceeded my expectations. I was really surprised to with the quantity and quality of the stones. My package came with 5 beautifully colored, polished, and shaped stones.<br /><br />Just some facts about Purpurite. It is a semi-soft mineral with 4-4.5 on the Mohs hardness scale (for reference Quartz has a hardness  of 7 and Calcite has a hardness of 3) so it can be on the easy side to scratch, but you need to at least do a little work to scratch it. That said, the way it was packaged and shipped was perfect, not a scratch. (The triangle pendent in my pic does have a small scratch in it due to me dropping it, no fault of the vendor).<br /><br />I would definitely order from this vendor again!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:fdc11517998d241c8a0aa4615c33d10b]] So this is a gift for my wife, for a specific date coming up (not yet occurred). I think it's awesome and hope she does too 🙂. See my little video review."
5.0,i liked the stretch in the pants and they are very comfortable. i ordered a second pair seeing how comfortable they were.
5.0,they're great!
5.0,Product arrived well packaged undamaged.<br />Xmas present to someone so unable to say if it's a good product.
5.0,They’re super breezy
5.0,"This is a great set to dress up solids such as black, white or red. I always receive compliments when wearing this together."
5.0,Love this blouse and every time I wear it I receive compliments from men and women.
5.0,Very light weight for warm weather workout
5.0,Very comfortable and supportive.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted,...zippered, long, light-weight summer robe with long sleeves that fits perfectly!"
5.0,Curve hugging casual dress
5.0,Lacrosse practice and games. Keeps sweat from dripping down your face.

5.0,Works very well.  Slides easily over my wrist.
5.0,Para navidad con pijama
5.0,"I really like these boot toppers, they look great with all boot heights ankle to knee high."
5.0,This dress is absolutely comfortable and cute. You can use it as it is (loose fit) or wear it with a wide belt to show your curves. Looks amazing. Great for the beach or just for any summer day.
5.0,"These are really warm and comfortable. They also have a tummy control top, which was a nice surprise. They have a strong chemical smell so you'll definitely want to wash before wearing."
5.0,Just what I wanted. Timely shipment. Thank you!
5.0,"Really cute cap, adequate size."
5.0,"Wanted a smaller (less fat) type of RFID wallet so use on vacation, one where I was only going to take a few cards with me plus room for drivers license, insurance card, etc.  I have one of their other wallets which I use every day.  Would I know if the RFID is working?  Probably not and can only go by what the seller has stated.  But I do feel that my cards are more protected in using this type of wallet.  Buying one is a decision that each one will have to make on their own - some may not think its worth it and others (like myself) will think its worth every penny.  I did choose the gray fabric one for this wallet, simply to be different from my black leather one.  I am happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Great quality, we were very pleased"
5.0,I got so many compliments for this item and I did not realize the name is so Special Michael Kors~I just happened to like the colour at the time and now I am also proud of the name~Martha MacPherson
5.0,"Perfect gift for a Star Wars fan and veteran. Nice material, thick and warm.Very well received, and it looks great on him :)"

5.0,Look really good and are comfortable.
5.0,I bought these for a Christmas gift for my daughter and kinda sad I didn’t buy another pair for myself. They fit awesome and are made very well. Not like the cheap ones at the stores. Very nice!
5.0,Nice fit. Beautiful design.
5.0,The lenses are high quality optics and at a good price. They have a lot of variety and prices depending about what you looking for and the warranty and customer service is second to no one.
5.0,"Soft, warm, comfortable and performs well during exercise. I’m a runner, I sweat a lot, and I live in the NE USA so I need quality long sleeve shirts for exercise but I’d be tempted to wear these all the time. The seams are flattering as is the cut. The fabric is butter-soft and I really like the way it looks.<br /><br />I prefer to wear shirts like this kind of bunched at my waistband, as you can see in the pictures, and the shirt sits well that way. You can also pull it down, it’s plenty stretchy (also shown in pics). I am 5’6 135 lbs, I normally wear a size small and it fit perfectly. Shoulders/bust are my “concern” areas and it fit well, neither were constricted.<br /><br />I got the green, blue and gray pack. The colors are gorgeous! I’m not typically a fan of heathered/“space dye” colors so this was a risk for me but I was very pleased! In fact I think I prefer the heathered blue and green to the more flat gray (see pic for comparison)."
5.0,Bought it for my grandson he likes it a lot. It was a medium. He is like 99lbs and 5’5
5.0,"This dress is awesome!! Too many compliments. I ordered a medium and it fits so good, please note this material is stretching so its a comfortable feel."
5.0,Excellent quality hat. Exactly as described.
5.0,Cheap and cool. Made me happy.
5.0,"It was just like explained in ad, works great and the fact is retractable makes it easy to take with you and store it"
5.0,"True to size , I love it"
5.0,I bought this as a gift. The person I gave it
5.0,"These shoes fit great, and are an incredible value for the money. I was looking at much more expensive shoes that were similar in nature, and these looked just as good, if not better!"
5.0,Amazing product and recommending to all my friends. It fits perfectly to my size and does as it is described. I am never going to let it go.
5.0,I can't tell you how many people complimented this shirt the first time I wore it to work. It's very different looking  and has a flattering fit. I recommend it! Looks nice with jeans and boots
5.0,"I used this on my new boots. Worked great, softened the leather and helped with waterproofing."
5.0,"Great masks! Comfortable, fun, and festive! Fit my whole family well!"
5.0,I’m so happy to have found these... I am a plus size woman and I live in skirts! These are perfect.
5.0,wife lives the scarfs rings
5.0,"I love organization and these travel cubes are perfect. Well made, too"
5.0,Very cute and comfortable!!
5.0,"Very well made, look just like a picture. Happy with my purchase."
5.0,I received this yesterday and I really like it. It's a Christmas gift but I like it so much i'll keep it and order another.
5.0,"Like many women, my bag is my portable life, so it takes a lot of research to find one that does everything I need it too. This one hits on all cylinders. First, it helps me stay organized. If you like exterior pockets, you know they can be hard to find. This one has one outside pouch that is roughly 9&#34;w x 8&#34;h -- large enough for everything I want easy access to (sunglasses, keys, phone, etc.). Inside, there are several more pockets in the lining, each roughly the size of an eye-glasses case or a mini umbrella; one wide zippered pocket is perfect for cosmetics; and the main compartment is divided into two sections. (I use one half for work stuff, the other for personal stuff.) Second, it's beautifully made. The leather is soft and gorgeous, the stitching is tight, the bottom corners are reinforced with more leather, and it has metal &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom, so it can stand up on its own. I don't usually carry my laptop, but the padding inside would provide ample protection without being too bulky. Third, it's the perfect size (for me). I can easily slide in several manila folders (or a change of clothes) and my iPad, and it still zips up nicely, but I don't feel like it's size overwhelms me. (I'm 5' 2&#34;.) It's a little weighty even when empty, but that's true of all leather bags.The handles are comfortable on my shoulder and long enough to hang comfortably, but I can also hang it from my elbow when needed. In short, I don't expect to to go bag hunting again any time soon -- unless I decide to get the exact same bag in another color!"
5.0,The necklace really surprised me with it's beauty and originality. This is genuine craftsmanship and excellent workmanship. Well worth the money spent!
5.0,Good quality. Fits a kids 11 year old size. Good print on outside happy overall with product
5.0,These are so comfy they are instantly my new favorite pants. Love the pockets
5.0,"I love this bag! It arrived almost a week early, is a great size for everyday use (including for work). The multiple inner compartments make it easy to organise my items without losing things, and the strap is easy to adapt from short shoulder loops to a long cross-body strap.<br />I am so happy to have ordered it here, and for the price is great.<br /><br />A perfect bag for those who want cute cat accessories"
5.0,"I got some new hiking shoes and they made all my socks slide down which was super irritating. So I thought I'd try these and they stay in place! They're really soft and comfortable, but also supportive. I'd definitely buy again."
5.0,"I love this cap. The fit is great even for my 'big' hairstyles. Visually, it's just a beautiful cap. I get compliments from staff and my patients every time I wear it."
5.0,Went great with Halloween costume.
5.0,Luv Luke Bryan and absolutely LUV this hat. Just like the one he wears. Amazing fit and quality... BEST purchase and great price. :)
5.0,My grand son loves Thomas the tank engine and loves everything Thomas. He put the out fit on as soon as he saw it.
5.0,"These Pearl hoops are beautiful. A perfect gift for any hoop lover or any Pearl lover! They are lightweight. Not too big and not too small. Packaging is perfect to make it show you put in a little more effort. These could be a holiday look or a summer look. All about how you style them. Do not hesitate, get these!"
5.0,These are now one of my favorite earrings!
5.0,Wearing these as I write.  Look exactly like what the picture does.  Very cute and minimalistic :)
5.0,As expected fit nicely. The pads in the cup part were a lil small but that was okay.
5.0,This is a very nice ring. I want another!
5.0,I ordered XL and it fits well. The fabric is sheer/thin but not too thin. Tank top underneath is needed! I wear 38 D in bra.. 5'4 180 lbs. I would order a size up if your stuck between sizes I usually order a XL and this fits a little smaller than I expected. Hoping it doesn't shrink up too much if I accidently dry it! Lol
5.0,Exactly as advertised color and size. Very nice.
5.0,"I should have measured the inseam before ordering. At 5'2"" these bell out about 3 inches above my ankle and look silly. Too bad because the rest of the leggings are well made, a great color and have pockets! The waist was comfortable, and the compression was enough to be flattering but not so much as to be restrictive.<br /><br />Unless you are either good with a sewing machine or of average to taller height, I would skip these though. The length just doesn't work for petites."
5.0,Loved the pink pair...perfect for vacation
5.0,Dress arrived just as described. Size medium.
5.0,"It is very cool and is just like its described, also its perfect for cosplay!"
5.0,Very cute and comfortable.  Fit true to size
5.0,I love these earings and they are everything I thought they were. Because they are real 14K gold my are not irritated.
5.0,"I now have 6 of these leggings and love them! I am 5 '1 and like the capri length, they fall a few inches above my ankle and are perfect for shorties like me. I love the buttery material and side pockets. You can sort of see the seams on darker colors but that is a non-issue for me. Especially at such a low price."
5.0,"These make your vehicle go faster, regardless of type of vehicle. And never tell me the odds."
5.0,Cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
5.0,This dress is true to size. Fits perfectly to me. I will add pictures when I can actually wear it when it gets warmer. I love this dress and so all the girls who will buy this.
5.0,Very nice brush metal makes the Fitbit feel more like a Watch
5.0,I love these dresses
5.0,"I love these bands! They look nice, but more important, they are comfortable! The plastic bands that come with the Fitbit are good for swimming, but they are not comfortable and they collect sweat when working out. These don’t and they are easy to wash. I just throw them in a small laundry bag and toss them in the wash with my other workout gear. Totally worth the purchase."
5.0,"We got these towels for our boys to take on our beach trip, when I got the grown up towel. I am really happy with these towels, especially the pockets! I don't have to carry everyone's stuff anymore! If they want it to get there and get home, it's their responsibility now! These towels are great, super soft, durable, and big enough for the boys to sprawl out on! Thanks TowelMate!"
5.0,I bought this for myself but my friggin wife stole it because it's so awesome. Unisex AF and pretty warm.
5.0,"These spikes fit well, look good, and are comfortable. Good quality. Whatever you do don't drop the spike piece like I did. Believe me you don't want to spend 15 minutes searching your floor for such a small piece."
5.0,This dress has fabric that stretches to fit smoothly around waist and generously flares to flatter hips comfortably. I liked the grey almost silver shade with blue flowers.
5.0,"I’m starting a presidential collection. Also have JFK, Lincoln, and Jefferson.  They have Obama too. Give me more!  FDR? Nixon?  What about founding fathers like Franklin?"
5.0,I bought this for my husband who is a die-hard Islanders fan and he loved it! It fits great and he’s afraid to wear it so it doesn’t get ruined
5.0,AWESOME! All the kids at my daughters school want them now.
5.0,"I didn't realize this wasn't a full length shirt when I bought it, but it's so cute I didn't mind it. Fabric is thick but comfortable."
5.0,"I have the coldest feet and these things are incredible! I wear them all day every day since I got them. The insides are so soft and the material has held up really nicely. Also size wise..my feet are size 9 1/2 - 10 woman’s and they fit perfectly. I really am so so pleased with this little splurge. Would be a perfect Christmas gift for a daughter, sister, mother, wife or girlfriend. Honestly get them for your man too, no shame!"
5.0,"Gorgeous, adjustable leather belts for a great price.  My fiance's last name begins with a G so these are even cooler for me with the G buckle, lol.  They are really gorgeous leather."
5.0,Overall this one was great; slightly too big so I did return it because I purchased a couple others I liked. But for the price it was a good dress
5.0,It Was more than what I expected.
5.0,Great on my jacket
5.0,"Personally I have very small wrists, sadly these didn’t work for me! HOWEVER, The company  emailed me on their own willing to give me a full refund, keep the 3 bands, and get new bands once they are manufactured! Highly highly impressed!!"
5.0,"I have been wearing this continuously since it arrived. Beautiful, good sized- I have med sized wrists but larger hands. Adjustable, Beautiful with incredible etching detail. ! It came with a lovely note from the creators/sellers...just lovely!"
5.0,Love this dress and the pockets. Was slightly wrinkled when it came to me but came out after a few minutes in the dryer. I added the belt just to accessorize but looks cute without it as well. My favorite maternity outfit.
5.0,Love the material... light weight and perfect for summer
5.0,"Easy to place in, fit perfectly!"
5.0,The necklace is just as it looks in the picture. I have had this product for awhile and it is still holding up well. It looks great with a solid color top and I've gotten several compliments on how cute it is. The price is unbeatable and I would definitely recommend!
5.0,Really comfortable. Nice material.
5.0,"This dress is better than I expected. Fits perfect and the fabric is soft and very colorful.  I am 5""2"" and 130 lbs."
5.0,"These pants are amazing. I'm probably going to order a second pair shortly, but in one size smaller. I'm usually a true size large in any leggings which is the size I ordered, but these are so stretchy that I think a medium would fit better (I'm a size 12 jeans). They are silky material that has a similar feel to 'dry fit' and are not too thick but also not too thin either. Not at all see thru (I have the gray/guava ones). Love them!"
5.0,Use it as RN  scrub hat. Very comfortable.
5.0,"My son  (who's 14 years old) loves these, he wears them every time we go to the pool. It's so convenient to have a case that they fit in too so they don't break. I recommended then!"
5.0,Love this very comfortable dress!!!!  Unique too
5.0,Great! Arrived on time!
5.0,"Beautiful belt and buckle, fit is perfect.."
5.0,Loved item! :)
5.0,best wallet I've ever owned.  enough space for just the cards I need to carry and a bit of cash. looks great & good quality!!
5.0,"Fit as expected! Super cute, my daughter loves them!"
5.0,"Haven't had the belt very long, but works well easy to adjust and loosen. Good selection of colors and buckles.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DQIV1JG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
5.0,These will work great for the minimal wear.
5.0,"This dress is extremely flattering and comfortable.  Fits just as described and isn't see-through like a lot of dresses this color.  Also, I love that it doesn't show every bump and line."
5.0,larger than my existing ones. Covers my whole ear with room to spare.
5.0,Looks like a strong rigid pole.  So far it is working great.  I had to replace the lower pole for a new umbrella I had just purchase.  The original pole was made from aluminum and bent the second day we used the umbrella.
5.0,My daughter loves this necklace! She she ordered the shorter one of the shorter lengths.
5.0,these are lovely earrings but they are a little heavy
5.0,Great buy and great customer service
5.0,Comfortable and flattering!
5.0,"This dress is amazing in fit and quality of fabric.  Stretchy, thick and soft.  So happy I got this one!"
5.0,Good quality and lush inside
5.0,Fits as expected and super soft!
5.0,I now have hats that stay new longer. Love the stuff and spray it on all of my hats.  It really does stiffen up an old Barcelino!!
5.0,"This watch is a nice surprise. It has some weight to it and does not feel cheap. Also, the watch came with a nice box, extra links and a tool to adjust length.  The watch itself has a blue hue to the face and works great.  I did not expect the watch to be this nice."
5.0,"Very nice pendant.  Has a nice weight to it.  It was delivered several days early and came in a nice, pretty pouch."
5.0,"Great quality, fits great, comfortable"
5.0,Really comfortable and I LOVE the side zipper!
5.0,It’s fitted perfectly! I was kind of nervous because I read mixed reviews on this dress but it worked perfectly for me!
5.0,These are solid hooks.  Similar hooks at the Hardware store say they can support 90 lbs.
5.0,Just one word ... GORGEOUS!!!
5.0,Good tights
5.0,"These little guys are amazing. I love the bright colors, easy to spot at baggage claim. The can hold so much. Plus they fit perfect in the large Bago duffle. All your stuff stays organized and easy to get to clean off if they get dirty."
5.0,Constructed of heavy material and well-made
5.0,"Soft, comfortable fabric and a great fit. Very happy with this dress."
5.0,I BOUGHT 2 LOVE IT
5.0,"This skirt is really lovely! The color is a deeper purple than I saw on my screen, but it is very pretty. The cut of the bottom of the skirt makes it swirl and flow very nicely. Would definitely order again. May order another color."
5.0,I have wide feet and these were perfect! Shipping was prompt!
5.0,I was pleased with this beautiful bracelet and I wear it everyday!
5.0,"I love these. I'm 5'7&#34; and 130 lbs. They got great. They are BARELY long enough to reach the malleolus (I'm pretty lanky) but short pants are back in style so hey. I bought a pair and ripped them on a rock while hiking (aggressively), and I'm buying another of the exact same ones. Worth your buck."
5.0,I'm a huge Eminem fan so I was pretty excited when I came across this. It's a good quality
5.0,"Perfect size! Phone, credit cards, cash, sun glasses"
5.0,Favorite lounge shirt!
5.0,"I made robes for a Hogwart's birthday party, including my Hufflepuff robe.  Very happy with this tie!  I'll probably wear the tie when I visit HP world at Universal this fall.  I suspect the tie would be a little long for a child, though."
5.0,I have been looking for this type of belt. It works perfectly and keeps your pants in place all day long. Some belt loops are smaller so just insert the clip end sideways and it will slide right in the loop.
5.0,Beautiful bag! The leather is so soft and the size is perfect!
5.0,"I love these tops....I've now ordered 3. They are sheer which makes it more comfortable to wear in layers. For the money spent, it is a great purchase. Will probably get a couple more colors."
5.0,Favorite sunglasses and dont seem cheap
5.0,Love it. Very sexy
5.0,Great workout or simply comfortable band to wear.
5.0,Same another store but they are good and have a good price too. Thank you so much seller !!
5.0,rose charms used for making bracelets
5.0,"Ibusualy wesr medium or large i took large size, it fits great, colors are exactly like the picture.<br /><br />Its not alot of sgnthetic material, it feels soft and cool. Not 100 percent cotton not all nylon and aynthetic either.. Its feels soft abd breathable, yet doesnt wrinkle.<br />Perfect for inhome or outside."
5.0,The product came as ordered and was even more beautiful than the photo. It also is original. I would buy it again and again.
5.0,Thick but comfortable.  Most comfortable mask I have worn.
5.0,Much thicker than other straps. Great look and comfortable. Definitely 5 star quality.
5.0,My favorite jeans ever!! This is my second pair. I had lost weight and needed a smaller size. LOVE!
5.0,They some durags and a stylish one at that
5.0,"Happy to find a ""politically correct"" onesie!  lol  Grandpa's special gift to his first grandchild."
5.0,Love this cardigan and it arrived on time
5.0,"The skirt is absolutely beautiful.  It fits just as I had anticipated.  I would definitely buy this product again, in another design of course"
5.0,Both perfect! Fit her Disney Princess Ariel.
5.0,Fits great. Warmer than a regular hoodie.
5.0,Love the look.  An  enhancement to your day.
5.0,My daughter loved the sweater ordered an extra large one size up still fits a little snug other than that she loves the sweater.
5.0,"I have tiny feet, a size 6. If I can't buy socks in S/M/L, I usually opt for kids sizes. These however fit me like a DREAM but if you have bigger feet than a size 7 I would not recommend these. Also, dont put them in the dryer!"
5.0,Excellent product and a great price
5.0,"Adorable shirt!  I’m 5’6”, 130lbs, 32DD and ordered a Large.  Love it.  Ordered the red also."
5.0,Nice shirt. Wish I had 5 more.”
5.0,I love this top and will buy it in other colors!  The best thing about it??  The sleeves are long!  I can't stand buying long sleeved shirts and the sleeves barely reach my wrists.
5.0,"This is the last shoehorn you will need to buy. It is perfectly anatomically molded for your hand (left or right, it's ambidextrous) and your heel. I didn't think there was a difference, but after breaking the umpteenth Ikea $0.99 one, this is like manna from heaven.<br /><br />The pictures aren't deceiving - it is NOT hollow, nice and heavy single piece of aluminum (aluminium). It's branded &#34;DEWAHSING&#34;, their website is down, so I suspect it was a limited designer item which is not going to return to the already limited Japanese market. So get this gem while you can!<br /><br />The biggest pro: you may experience a shoegasm!<br /><br />The only con: You will fight with your loved one over who gets to take it to the grave, so you might as well just buy two of them!"
5.0,Works great and matches anything you wear
5.0,"Fits great, very sturdy."
5.0,I bought 2 of these and they are PERFECT!!  Arrived right on time and I am so happy I did order  them.
5.0,Love it. I am very allergic to metals and some sterling just does not work for me. I must say I love this item. Has not bothered me in any way and I even taken showers and bp baths with it on and it has not not tarnished or faded and the price is good:) I plan to order a couple more to keep on hand.
5.0,They are attractive and very useful during the pandemic and the need to wear a face mask most everyday.
5.0,"This watch is really nice, has a good weight and doesn’t feel cheap. The display and the brown wrist bands give it a nice “expensive look”. I like the day and night rotating display that changes from sun to night sky along with the time of day (have never seen that feature before) and includes a functional stopwatch."
5.0,Comfortable and stays in place during Pilates.  Definitely worth the extra money.
5.0,Great fit. Love the shoe.
5.0,I bought 3 of these shirts and I don't have any complaints about them. Good buy and lots of patterns to choose from.
5.0,As a huge Overwatch fan I love this hat. I do not really like the snapback hats so finding one that was stretch fit was super cool. The hat fits my head just right and the design is great. I definitely would recommend if you like Overwatch.
5.0,GREAT MATERIAL!!
5.0,Love love love knockaround!!!!
5.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BHKELRY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
5.0,"Good for a day out, lounging at home or as a cover up.  Excellent quality construction and material."
5.0,"I discovered a pair of Happy Socks on the clearance rack at a shoe store and bought because of the high cotton content.  After I read the label about the company and its ""Happy"" message, I decided it made a great Christmas present to spread the happy message of colorful socks with cotton as main ingredient and was glad I found it on Amazon."
5.0,"Stylish and functional!  The first pair I received had a flaw, and the company replaced them quickly with no problem!  Impressed!"
5.0,Excellent quality! Very comfortable.
5.0,The item is exactly as described and came very quickly.  I'm pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"Perfect fit for my girls, bought two of them a green and a yellow,  they love them and have worn them everyday since purchase."
5.0,These are great pants. Very comfortable for working out or lounging around. I'd hate to call them sweat pants because they look and feel so much better. Size is just right and color is just as advertised.
5.0,I like it was nice
5.0,"Using it as an undershirt for a costume. Lightweight, fits perfectly. Very long."
5.0,"It fits as expected, and it's perfect for working out!"
5.0,"Brilliant, beautiful colors.  Sometimes markers seem to be starting to dry out even when they are new, but that was not the case with these markers.  My granddaughter loves them.  I would buy them again."
5.0,"Surprisingly really good quality. Still use it every day, and the wood accents are really nice. Won't turn any heads, but won't look cheap either."
5.0,Great mom purse. Unisex so my teenage boys aren’t embarrassed to carry “mom’s purse”. Huge bonus. It’s held up great to Indiana weather and being THROWN all over the car.
5.0,They look so sturdy and nice. Love them
5.0,These have been a great purchase. They do have the inserts in the bra that are removable. Will purchase again.
5.0,It’s a great warm sweatshirt I’m happy with my purchase! I even ordered another
5.0,Will fade as instructions states. Works great for my purposes.
5.0,Awesome!!!!
5.0,This product appears to be of high quality and suited our needs.
5.0,"Absolutely love the quality!<br /><br />This does run small, so whatever you think you want to order, order a size up :)"
5.0,Awesome love da color
5.0,An appropriate for the occasion gift together with an affordable price.
5.0,Got it to display with my Marine Sgt. Fathers Marine urn. Perfect combo!
5.0,"This is flowy and unusual colors.  It will help pull any outfit together.  From Jeans and a tee, to a nice black suit.  and it can be worn all seasons.  Black with flowers is a wonderful mix."
5.0,"Cool Shirt, love it."
5.0,My daughter loved the crocs. Good price and very comfortable
5.0,Perfect for summer when you are sick of shorts. Easy and comfortable. I get lots of compliments.
5.0,"Just as described, kept me warm."
5.0,Lightweight and cute!
5.0,This material is super soft and comfortable... Love this shirt!
5.0,These are perfect. Only thing is they do run a little small. They fit me just fine but they are tight and I have very skinny fingers. Anyone with ring size 6 and up needs a larger size.
5.0,Order 1 size larger then what you wear normally. Great shirt for the price. I got 5 for my work uniform and if they get stained it's ok since they're so inexpensive.
5.0,"Very cute and lays nicely on my neck,"
5.0,This sweater tank is so cute. It fits true to size and is comfortable. Matches with anything. V-neck makes it sexy if you want to dress it up.
5.0,The mesh bag is great! Love the little bit thicker drawstring which helps when wearing bag. Great size . Color was true to picture. Already bought a couple more.
5.0,I have the Tendency to pierce through shirts this has help me minimize my nipping problem and they fit very comfortable over any style of shirt. The great thing about them is that they are able to be versatile for any occasion and you can have it ready to use at any time when used over a shirt.
5.0,They are small enough for my ears and so cute when worn!!
5.0,I like very much how they enhance the appearance of my boots.
5.0,"Great long sleeve shirts. Vibrant colors red and green. Ordered one size up, usually a large but ordered xl, perfect fit. Received two shirts promptly."
5.0,"I contacted the seller because I wasn’t sure the delivery window would work for me- they were quick to reply, and all but guaranteed delivery at the quicker end of the window. Well, they just arrived, they’re the real thing, and it’s two days before I needed them -<br /><br />Altogether, things couldn’t have gone better.<br /><br />Many thanks-"
5.0,I used it as part of my daughter’s unicorn costume
5.0,Looks modern and pretty. Good quality.
5.0,"Love them, will fit for another year or so; runs a bit bigger"
5.0,My favorite sneakers. Comfortable and easy to put on. I have purchased these twice.
5.0,"I liked that they actually stayed on my head. Since I am not a headband wearing person, I’m using them to sew buttons on the side for my face mask."
5.0,"These crease protectors are really well made and do not cause discomfort when wearing shoes. While wearing the shoes with the protectors, creasing is extremely minimal or none. I will repurchase for sure."
5.0,"I got it as a gift god my brother long time ago, he still wears it"
5.0,Quality for the price is very good. Adjustable to fit different wrist sizes by pulling the two drawstrings. Comes with a variety of colored felt discs to swap scents easily. The felt holds the scent for a long time although I think this might depend on the quality of the oil you use (I use Young Living and Doterra). Materials hold up well when wet (I waitress and bartend so I constantly have my hands in water).
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:923cfa669b799cf1a8fae33ef8365cf0]] Emour Satin Rose Rhinestone Evening Bag is well-designed and stitched with smooth material! The rhinestones are nice accents, but do not shine as much as the photo represents. Personally, I prefer it that way, because it doesn't overshadow the sheen of the satin material. The purse snaps tightly closed without any opening. Some twist closure bags do not close all the way leaving a gap, unlike this one. The roses are well-stitched and are not coming undone, nor do I see any loose threads. The rhinestones are secure on the fabric without any evidence of adhesive.<br /><br />The inside has a small pocket that is too small to fit your smartphone, but good to put a compact or tube of lipstick. This evening bag can hold your cellphone, a very small wallet and a few cosmetics. There is also a long chain located inside to make this a shoulder or crossbody bag. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality up close. I didn't know what to expect, but the manufacturer definitely has quality control. This bag even comes in a nice red gift box! Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Given sample to test and return my personal honest opinion. I create videos to demonstrate that I have tested the product and have made no false statements."
5.0,"It is a beautiful charm , great colors ... fun to carry and look at- I am going to get another for my sister !"
5.0,"My ex-wife is now gay, this sweatshirt rubs her the wrong way. Mission accomplished."
5.0,For smaller wrists. It hurts me a little. It's not quite 7&#34; around. But the piece is beautiful for that price.
5.0,The best fitting and warmest socks. Love them. Have  bought three pkgs.
5.0,The most comfortable t-shirt dress! Stylish high/low hem. Dress up or wear with flip flops. I ordered multiple colors and live in them in summer/fall. You
5.0,These boots are perfect.......stylish and practical
5.0,Great belts!
5.0,Best boots in the world!
5.0,What I want but the colored seems washed or faded. Not what is on the page.
5.0,Beautiful necklace! The only downfall is it gets tangled easily.
5.0,"Very soft and comfortable, high quality material"
5.0,"Tried this on at my local sporting good store and then purchased it here for almost half the price! Size is accurate with room for my orthopedic inserts. And the support and style is exactly what I need for work, light aerobics and walking."
5.0,They look awesome by my bonsai tree!
5.0,Nice swinsuit. You can wear it all day long!
5.0,Love the pants.
5.0,"Perfect fit, quality material and construction."
5.0,This was a way better quality than I was expecting! It is sturdy and I love it!.
5.0,"They fit perfect! They matched my bridesmaid dress perfectly and gave me more stability than heels. My only complaint would be that they are a little big. I normally wear a size seven, I ordered a size seven and they were a little bit big. I am overall very pleased with these wedges."
5.0,"An extremely well made patch. Looks awesome, can wait to wear it paintballing! Very good buy and well worth the price, perfect for cosplaying."
5.0,"Very good, thanks"
5.0,My 5 year old picked this out. The colors are exactly as shown and the print is done very well. We are both very happy with it!
5.0,I pray every night we play the Astros on the ALCS.
5.0,"Loved these headbands! Used them for a Christmas party and they were a nice added extra. The product arrived on time, was well packaged, and nicely constructed, very colorful. Sadly I can't submit a photo because they were taken by the party goers.  I would definitely purchase them again."
5.0,: D
5.0,Super cool!!
5.0,I can wear it loose or with a wide belt and it looks fabulous.
5.0,Bought these for my granddaughters for Christmas and they both LOVED them.
5.0,"This is probably my fourth or fifth Casio Digital Sport Watch over the last 40 years. They truly last and are very light, comfortable, and reliable. They are perfect for outdoor activities. The resin watchstrap is easily replaceable at any discount department store if and when it ever breaks. There is probably no better watch for the price."
5.0,My daughter needed a bag to carry back & forth to piano lessons & this is the perfect size!  The artwork is vibrant & the zipping small inside pocket is perfect for flash cards & pencils!
5.0,Fits great and keeps a gal cool on the course!
5.0,Our daughter had the best Cruella costume of all the ones we saw while out trick or treating and we saw several
5.0,"It's lovely - looks just like the photo on the website.  The clasp is small so I thought it would be hard to  open and close , but it's quite easy to adjust according to the neckline you're wearing.  I like it for myself but am thinking of offering it to my 12 year old granddaughter.  I think it would look beautiful on her but not sure if  it's what young girls like these days.  I love the stars, moon and little white pearls.  Looks a lot more expensive than $10.00!"
5.0,"I use these for swimming laps. Great alternative to speedos. I go through a couple suits a year swimming a few days a week so can beat the price. After this pair wears out I'll get a couple pairs. As I said, can't beat the price."
5.0,Worked great to haul my kids dirty rc card/trucks in when transporting in the car.
5.0,follow sizing instructions at the top
5.0,Nice lapel set and matches with most of my suits.
5.0,"I love this pullover, the quality is great and it is so soft. I’m 5’5” & 130 lbs and ordered a size small and it fits great. Thinking about ordering more colors!"
5.0,"These are my favorite bras, no pinching or clasp irritation. Great for fibromyalgia sufferers!"
5.0,"these bracelets are beautiful,  and half the price of Alex &Ani I ordered a few more."

5.0,Love it for airline travel. Lightweight
5.0,Nothing daughter will not take it off
5.0,"Haven't worn it yet, but it looks like a beautiful addition to the special outfit I'm wearing to church."
5.0,This is a great deal for five sweatbands and they have really come in handy this year with the high heat. I like to wear them while I am doing yard work or doing a high intensity workout on my tread climber. It is good to have this many so I can share them with my husband and not run out before I have to do another load of laundry. These are also not too tight around your head.
5.0,"Excellent quality that doesn't pinch.  These are like they are tailored to him.  I like how they peek out the top of his shorts to let everyone know he is wearing a baby diaper.  He wears diapers 24/7 and I will only allow him to wear very babyish designed clothing.  I know he is constantly trying to hide them, but it only brings more attention to him when he does.  I absolutely love how obedient and submissive he becomes.  I only wish they were noisier."
5.0,"True to size, maybe even a little larger. Really beautiful and good quality. Worked perfectly because i'm 4'11 but do not see this asa  dress on someone over 5'2"
5.0,"adorable suit.  great quality, great price."
5.0,"This chain is the perfect length and I only wear silver jewelry, so it was exactly what I was looking for. And you can beat the price."
5.0,Present for my 4 year old grand daughter . She loves them
5.0,Stylish and very comfortable. Fits perfectly and looks better than other masks I have owned. Really unique idea. Buying more for family & fiends for holidays.
5.0,I love these. Feels almost like I'm barefooted.
5.0,Nice shirt! Fits great!
5.0,"I was getting headaches every single day after using my computer.  I put these glasses on and the first thing I noticed was that my vision was absolutely crystal clear!  The best vision I've had from a pair of readers without going to the eye doctor.  The amber/yellow tint is soothing to me and I prefer it over glaring light.  I've been on the computer for over an hour now and so far, no headache or strained eyes.  I watch a lot of Amazon TV and will wear them for tv too.  In fact I'll wear them all the time.  The frame doesn't look so hot on me, but There's no one to impress but the cat when I'm flat on the couch binge watching or compu-shopping."
5.0,"I bought this as the basis for a Little John tunic for a Halloween costume.  It worked out really well. It's a really well made, high quality sweatshirt. The material is very soft and thick. My husband stayed very warm on a cold Halloween night!"
5.0,"LOVE THE STYLE, AND IT FITS GREAT ON ME. 150 5'5 AND GOT A SMALL."
5.0,Perfect size and color.
5.0,I just received this and I am pleased with the design quality. The little crystals seem to be secure and the design is very attractive. It will be my go to mask for March.
5.0,These shades work really well for me. Very happy with the product and the responsive service to my questions and issues re the Yellow Night Vision glasses which I also bought.
5.0,"Dress is perfect, fits great and good quality"
5.0,"Very cute and quality made. The skirt part is so adorable. The bottoms fit more like a Brazilian or thong type definitely though, esp if you have a big booty. Back was only slightly wider than the front of the bottoms. Top is made for women with small breasts definitely.. this fits well and I am a petite woman 5 3 and 170 lbs and the large fits perfectly but I would have bought an XL had they offered it. Overall very satisfied"
5.0,"I like that they are roomy, not too tight. Some wraps give me a headache."
5.0,Really cool shoes my sin loved these.
5.0,"I love these pants, great quality and the fit is perfect.  They are my new favorite pair, I only wish they came in different colors."
5.0,"As an interpreting major, I got these for all my friends for graduation. A little expensive I think but adorable."
5.0,These are so pretty and so easy to use
5.0,Beautiful bracelet. Love it.
5.0,I got this dress in a XL. It fit perfectly. Was scared at first when I bought it. But I totally love it. Pair it with a blue Jean jacket.
5.0,"Bought it as it goes well with other tags I have. Like the leather look of it. I use it for international travels primarily. Tags look sturdy, but lot depends on which airport is handling you bags too :)"
5.0,I loved everything about them
5.0,Tal cual como la imagen
5.0,Love the socks-great quality
5.0,Just as in description received early thank you very much
5.0,"This vest fits so well. Great price, warm, perfect thickness. I may order another in a different color, but the wine red goes well with a lot"
5.0,"Nice color, good quality, flattering fit!"
5.0,They are the perfect leggings! So soft and just overall just amazing. Im 5'3 and weigh 220. And this pair of leggings grab everyone's attention and makes everyone wanna buy it

5.0,Nice for long walks when it's cold
5.0,Amazing! I recently had ankle surgery and these were recommended by my doctor and they have been great. My swelling is way down and they have done wonders for my recovery. I plan to purchase more for the next few months.
5.0,LOVE this dress!!!  Can't wear it enough!  I'm 5'8&#34; and it is nice and long on me.  Love it!!!!!!!!
5.0,"Cute and seems to be good quality! I only wore these for two hours, but my ears didn’t hurt from the weight or from the metal. These are not very heavy."
5.0,"I was looking for a basic solid-color top to wear with my more patterned trousers. This is a great pick! The material is a bit stretchy and on the thinner side, giving this top sort of a closer fit, but I didn't mind that."
5.0,Great for yardwork . Always sweating as I mow or work in garden. These help alot.
5.0,"This swimsuit cover is so soft! I have had some in the past that feel scratchy but this one is super comfortable. The sides are very adjustable, I’m a size 10 and didn’t need to adjust it any but it is laced up the sides so you can loosen them to fit any size"
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous and was everything I wanted it to be! I bought it for my engagement shoot and I can't count the compliments I've received. It's stunning, lightweight, but not see through at all. I'm 6'1"" so it wasn't insanely long on me, above the ankle. I'm also about 135 pounds so it was a little loose around the waist, but I also have a smaller waist. It fit perfectly, exactly what I wanted. I paired it with burgundy velvet high platform heals and it was perfect. Seriously, buy it, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,"My Wife really loved it. I was very impressed by the quality. Would definitely buy again, maybe try another color."
5.0,"Like that it's easy to wear, I have arthritis in my hands. The velcro straps make it easy to secure, and they are attractive."
5.0,Fuzzy?  Yes. Warm?  Yes. Does the job?  Yes. Great for warming your fingers?  Yes. What’s more to say?
5.0,Great product! Great price!

5.0,"It took a little while for us to get the shirt, but it was printed really nicely. It was well worth the wait."
5.0,I love this dress. I am 5'4 195lbs and I purchased a large. The large fit as expected. I also purchased an XL and it was too big. The material is like a ribbed tank top material but is it thick enough to not show undergarments. The material is very breathable. The royal blue is a nice color. I have washed the dress multiple times with. I shrinkage and no piling. I have not dried it. I just let it air dry.
5.0,Pretty and well made. So pretty on my chain.
5.0,I AM 5'9 AND 210 LBS<br />I LOVE THIS DRESS THIS DRESS DOES NOT RIDE UP AT ALL IT HUGS BUT NOT TO TIGHT!!! I DON'T HAVE TO PULL IT DOWN WHEN I SIT STAND OR WALK!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS!!!<br /><br />IT IS VERY SEXY WHILE STILL BEING VERY CLASSY!

5.0,Cutest dress ever. Can't wait to wear it in Vegas.
5.0,"I have a hard time finding clothes that fit well, and look good, so I was very excited to discover that this top was comfy, AND, good looking. The material is soft, and has some give to it. It’s like a T-shirt material. I have already worn it twice. It washes and dries nicely. The color didn’t fade, and the top didn’t shrink. I would definitely order this top, again!"
5.0,fits perfect and looks good.
5.0,Really well made with wonderful pig images. A big hit as a gift.
5.0,My grandkids love them
5.0,Great product!! Fast shipping!! Very pleased!!
5.0,"Seems like a good effective mask. Adjustable straps work well and are not uncomfortable around the ears. Filter is a bit awkward to get in, but not a game changer. All in all a good buy."
5.0,"I got this for my little grandbaby and it seriously is super cute. The material is soooooo soft and cozy and my grandbaby just loved it, he was so snuggly! Definately would purchase again."

5.0,"This costume was INCREDIBLEEE !!! Wore thisfor my office Halloween party and I got so many compliments ! The material, the fit ! Everything ! Amazing!<br />For reference I am 5’2, 105lbs and I got a small. The tail is really long (specially for my height) so it did drag a lot and I also carried it a lot. Would have probably dragged less had I worn heels. All in all, great purchase. I usually resell my costumes after I used them, but I’m definitely keeping this one.<br />So yeah! BUY IT"
5.0,Fits perfect my daughter is 11. I ordered a medium. She loves swimming with this tail. Overall quality is 5 stars
5.0,The hat and gloves were exactly as described and also soft.
5.0,Looks awesome ♥️
5.0,"Cut resistance and grip is far superior to any gloves I’ve had In The past. For someone who works with glass, this is the best glove. my gloves are 2.5 months old with extensive daily use and they  have yet to start separating from the fabric."
5.0,"I am pretty surprised at how nice this shirt is! I ordered it in black in case it was thin, but now I wish I would have ordered the white because it’s very thick material and not at all see through. Now time to find some bottoms to go with it!"
5.0,I really like the color and the way all the stitches are made.
5.0,"Great, thanks!"
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOOOVE this tank top!! Fits perfect and is super cute! I got it in multiple colors!

5.0,My daughter love the sunglasses they are perfect.
5.0,Amazing!!! Thought they were ruined. Now new again!

5.0,"This is such amazing quality! Just like Artie, but took along time to arrive"
5.0,Fits great. Good support.
5.0,"this white blouse  is  perfect,  specially  for the price."
5.0,This dress was perfect and so was the color and feel of the material!  It was super soft!  It was for a speciaL event and it came in just in time!  Only sad thing 2 washings and the thread started aiming loose in seam.
5.0,"I have been wondering why we can't get cheaters for distance for years, then I thought, check on Amazon, they carry everything.  Voila!  Distance glasses!  I only need a little help when watching tennis matches at a distance to see the score and night driving in unfamiliar places, and the -.5 are perfect!  Would maybe like them to be a little more fashionable but since I only wear infrequently, it's all good!  thank you!"
5.0,Beautiful colors seems like made well.
5.0,Nice but very delicate. Be careful
5.0,My mom got an Amazon gift card and wanted this. She likes that it has pockets
5.0,"I'm required to wear sleeves at work, and these are quite awesome. They definitely have a cooling effect, thought it's not quite as noticeable anymore as when I first bought them. Yes, they do run, at least one of my sleeves did, but it is only slight cosmetic damage and does not ruin functionality.<br /><br />These things looked small but stretch far enough to go from my wrists to my elbows. I do a lot of lifting and moving and they stay in place really well. Will likely buy another pair soon.<br /><br />As a side note, being outside in the sun, these get hot pretty quickly. The cooling effect only happens when there is some amount of wind, or when I go inside."
5.0,"Wow! I am so happy purchasing this headpiece...I was the show stopper of my holiday office party. The fan and lace finger-less gloves all came from Amazon. Headpiece was comfortable, studs place perfectly, feather not heavy very light, doesn't look cheap. Great purchase.<br /><br />From Brooklyn, New York - you know we're hard to please!"
5.0,"This product is sold 100% as advertised. It is elegant and very beautiful. I totally give it a five star rating. That being said, my order was fulfilled in Israel. Shipping was through DHL. Expedited shipping was paid for and it was shipped quickly. The shipping went way beyond expected delivery and I was refunded the expedited shipping charges. If you can be patient the necklace is well worth the wate."
5.0,Super cute! My daughter normally wears a size 5-6 and we did order one size up. Fits perfect!
5.0,Looked exactly like the picture..... I have worn it thrice in this 1 month I got it and it is still the same color
5.0,This  great !is really
5.0,I loved is cute comfortable and lovely colors and the texture nice and soft

5.0,Purchased these packs several times now - they last and are warm bit not too thick
5.0,Not sure what to say about a pair of slippers.  They slip onto my feet and don't scratch the hardwood floors.  8-)
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my Mom, she loves it"
5.0,"Es muy lindo el disfraz me encanto pero es un poco transparente, me toco ponerme algo por debajo ... pero tbn recomendado"
5.0,Perfect! As described!
5.0,"Ordered medium in navy. Perfect fit: I am 34C, 29 &#34; waist, 36&#34; hips, 5'4&#34;, 134 lb. I LOVE this top!!! It is well made (excellent stitching throughout, particularly on trim of bell sleeves. Material is medium weight, perfect for autumn and winter. I saw an exact copy in NYC (I know the quality is different) for $350. But since it is a trendy (vs staple wardrobe item), I could not be more pleased. Customers in the NYC store thought I had bought the top there and were asking questions about comfort and fit."
5.0,"Adjustable sizing works.  Size large fit my 21 month old perfectly, with room to grow.  Great for use at beach, pool or other outdoor activity."
5.0,"I have only been wearing these for half the day and I have gotten compliment after compliment! The packing states &#34;We Love You&#34; and and fine a quality as these are, I believe it. Thank you. :)"

5.0,Cute af♡
5.0,Love. Love. Love. The material feels great! I have had multiple compliments when I wear it.
5.0,"My daughter LOVES it! Trying to maintain it has become difficult so it is looking a little ragged, but hopefully I can brush it or tame it. What can you do when your daughter wants to wear it all the time and a little brother who wants to pull hair? LOL"
5.0,This fit my wide feet like a glove. I wear an 8.5 - 9 and purchased the 9.
5.0,These things are like super non-slip hugs for my feet! I purchased them to wear at the hospital after my surgery instead of the awful ones they give you and these are exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Beautiful robe! Sooo soft and cuddly!
5.0,It was a gift for my daughter in law and she loved it!!!  Exactly what she wanted.

5.0,Great pair of sun glasses cuts the sun glare better than my more expensive sun glasses.  I'm getting another pair.
5.0,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas. He loves that they are stronger silicone than the ones he buys from the stores. The colors don't match up exactly on the marbled ones, but I think thats the point. All the sizes were right. He loves them. Great buy!"
5.0,"Had issues with locking clips, they were addressed promptly and more than satisfactory."
5.0,"A decent price for a decent product, if you like this sort of thing. This was a gift for my uncle, who is happy with them."
5.0,"I love the dainty, sparkliness of this gorgeous necklace. The citrine stone is the center of attention surrounded by smaller clear rhinestones at the bottom of the drop. It sparkles and shines in the perfect light. I can pair this with just about anything I am wearing. A beautiful addition to my jewelry collection!"
5.0,"I must have purchased 20-30 different products that would keep my eyeglasses from falling off of my face and either breaking or getting lost. This is the BEST! The most comfortable, easiest to use, and nicest looking piece. I had these darned tails sticking down, had to use barbie pins, etc. This fits perfectly and is so comfortable. I must have spent $60-80 on these items, until I found these Croakies and I must say, I AM TRULY EXCITED about these!! ENJOY!! THANK YOU!!"
5.0,"I love this wallet!  It is soft leather, a great size for me and holds the number of plastic cards and paper cards I need.  Do keep in mind that due to the size, although pictures show 4 card slots on each side, the bottom 2 slots in each side are the same space, so you can really only put a plastic card in 1 of the 2 slots.  I put a paper card in the other of the 2 first slots, so it works fine for me.<br /><br />I purchased the UsefulThingy wallet first, but it was way to big to fit in my pants pocket. That wallet barely fit in my pants pocket,  and eventually I was going to ruin a pair of pants trying to extract that huge thing.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01AUSVYQU/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />This wallet is a much better option."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.  I gave it as a gift and she loved it. It sparkles like a diamond.  Great buy

5.0,Son is gun collector and car buff. It is great.
5.0,Great tshirt! Heavy and big in FL heat. I’ll order a smaller size next time. Don’t get pulled over wearing this shirt! Lol!

5.0,Like this hat. Fit my head and hold my long hair. Keeps me warm.
5.0,Very cute! They stay in my 7 month old's hair really well!
5.0,"I love this top! It's super cute and is one of my go-tos. Iheartraves fitted tops always fit really strangely though. They fit insanely tight in the arms, like seriously jammed up into your armpits, so keep that in mind before ordering. I am 5'0&#34; and 92 lbs and I got a medium and it fits perfectly!"
5.0,These keychains are sweet.
5.0,Love it . Look the way I expected it.
5.0,Item is somewhat heavy and feels full. I like the tool that came with it to change the links. It was very handy. The wife has small wrists so I have to removed 3 links from each side. She loves the band and it looks very cool. She gets a lot of great remarks on it.
5.0,"The bottoms are a little small, but I still like the swimsuit. Trendy look."
5.0,Fit perfect and does not show my cellulite

5.0,It fit better than I expected. Everyone said it looked great on me.
5.0,"This popped up in items suggested for me and although I've never wore I've never worn a pair of wooden earrings before, I liked the design so I thought, for 10 bucks, why not. And I love them! Lightweight, beautifully made and the wooden posts are the 1st earrings I've worn that are non irritating. My only want is the option to purchase replacement posts because being thin bits of wood, they're likely to break like toothpicks eventually and then what?"
5.0,"Gift, arrived on time, wife loved it."
5.0,Just what I wanted.  Fits loose but I prefer that.  Looks nice.
5.0,Its very cute. I got the two-piece in pink and its actually adorable.
5.0,I thought I was ordering a small mask for my granddaughter but they ship out an adult (medium) mask by default if you don’t specify small. Seller graciously eventually sent me a small one at no additional cost.<br />My granddaughter loves wearing it to karate class.
5.0,My sister loved this bracelet.
5.0,Fits great.  Love the short.
5.0,"I really like my new bling bling mask. I know that things are starting to open up. However, I'll continue to wear my masks with a filter to keep me safe. Oh yes I had my vaccine. Sharing them with my daughter's wedding party.  The look is  perfect  and complete the wedding."

5.0,Love LOOOOVE these glasses. I bought pink ones previously and needed a second pair. These are bright and just as comfortable.
5.0,"This is a great hoodie, it is thin so you can get more wear out of it in the hotter states.. great colors, fabric is soft."
5.0,"I live in a drafty house that was built in the 1920s. These socks are warm and soft so I don't need to crank the heat up all day. Pair with some house slippers for extra comfort. Great value, highly recommend."
5.0,"Fits great, looks cool."
5.0,I ordered these for my teenage granddaughters birthday.  I loved them so much that I ordered myself a pair!
5.0,So adorable! My grand child loves this product. She has one on each glove and attached to her Jacket so she don't lose them. They just clipped to her sleeve and grabbed her little mittens tight. They are pink her favorite color. Now we won't lose her winter ware and we will know at all times where they are. They stretch too! They are a five star rating for sure. Love it! They come in other colors too! My grand son needs some too!<br /> I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.
5.0,"These earrings are EVERYTHING!!  Annnddddd... they were only $12 for all 3 pair.  If I had the money, I would literally buy these for all my friends & co-workers.  They are perfect and so versatile.  I typically wear BIG earrings and was a afraid they'd hit by my chin and be too small.  And they sort of do (chin), but they're so amazing that they look incredible regardless.  ON EVERYONE!!  Because a few of my friends have now tried them on.  If you're on the fence, get off!  And buy these.  You'll be as happy about the purchase as I am, I'm sure of it :D"
5.0,"I LOVE this shirt!! It runs a little big, but that's all right with me. A little more room never hurt anyone! Nice quality and love the pockets in it!"

5.0,"I typically have trouble wearing rompers because I am 5'8 and long-torsoed, but I decided to give this one a chance for my honeymoon trip to Hawaii. The straps are adjustable so I was able to lengthen it to about the right length- meaning it was barely long enough for me. This romper is so comfortable and cute. perfect to just throw on to stroll around in warmer climates. And plenty of booty coverage, a little longer in the back than in the front. Enjoy!"
5.0,Love the way it fits and looks.
5.0,"It’s long and a little bit wide, but since it stretches it’s great when moving. I like the material because it’s soft and smooth."
5.0,Was gorgeous! Got for a friend who graduated nursing school late in life! This is her motto!
5.0,Feels great and just right.. I would buy it for someone else and you recommend it to others

5.0,Get complements where ever I go. Very comfortable.
5.0,"Perfect open back tank for hiking! Soft, wicking, super lightweight fabric makes it nice and airy when it’s hot. Loose fitting makes it the perfect hiking/outdoors tank! Colors are exactly as listed and sizing is true to the chart provided. I ended up buying more!"
5.0,"Very comfortable, nice fit."
5.0,"Works nicely, good quality, easy to adjust, great price for three."
5.0,Nice n stylish watch. Liked it.
5.0,These are beautiful and thick enough but still breathable.
5.0,They are strong enough to carry really heavy loads and for over the shoulder.  Woo hoo...no more plastic bags!
5.0,It’s a loose fit but actually a good thing. I’ve purchased the Bayleaf brand which is more fitting. Keeps me cooler than short or no sleeves shirts.
5.0,I love this!! So cute!
5.0,I love this pj set I bought. It is very stretchy and form fitting. It's nice to wear around the house and not look like you just woke up. after washing it doesn't shrink. I will be buying another set soon.

5.0,"Like the different colors,  go nice with my suits."

5.0,A mi me encanto bello
5.0,Very pretty and works very well
5.0,"Lots of confusion with the sizing.  My grand daughter normally wears a size 11.5 in US sizes.  Her foot is 6.5&#34; long.  According to the company sizing chart, I should have ordered her a 8.5 toddler. I added half an inch to her foot measurement and ordered a 10.  Her toes come to the very tips of the shoes.  She won't be able to wear them for very long, but she loved them so much, I couldn't send them back for a bigger size.  I wish I had ordered her usual size instead."
5.0,It fit just as I hoped it would.  Good quality.  Fast shipping.
5.0,Good kids sunglasses at a low price
5.0,"cute hat, a little hard to flip. Seller was perfect"
5.0,"Loved it for my purpose!  I used it for essential oil therapy while riding on the back of a motorcycle.<br />I cut a small piece of a cotton pad, applied the oil, and placed on in the locket. It worked GREAT!<br />It also fit into the motorcycle &#34;look&#34;.  I'd love to find something similiar with more of an edgy look but this worked very well.<br />Some reviews said it was cheap looking but after all, it did only cost $9.99.  Duh.  But still, it was very OK.  I recommend this for my purpose.  Glad I had it along."
5.0,Looks pretty & easy to wear/combine for casual or more formal occasions.
5.0,This item matched up well with my shoes.
5.0,"I needed some new shorts because I started running again with my kid. Something for a few miles, but we're not doing marathons yet.  The Gafeng Mens Running Shorts seemed to be good for the purpose.<br /><br />The fit is fine, size is right on. The cut is good and has lots of space for a guy. The material is soft and light, good for running. It says compression, I'm not sure I would call these ""compression"" shorts. I'm not sure I really would want that for shorts. A good compression leg brace is something else. But I had no problem with the shorts.<br /><br />The design is nice. It's subtle running shorts, not too flashy. The pocket is a bit small for a regular 2020 cell phone, especially if it's in a case. But it's useful for keys or other things.<br /><br />The prices for these shorts fluctuate a lot, but it's a good deal for under $20.  I recommend them for a good pair of running shoes. I am happy with them."
5.0,"Comfortable, look exactly like picture. Glad I made the purchase."
5.0,It fits like a charm
5.0,This works well and is a good way to save money when gambling.
5.0,Material is so soft and it fits perfectly.
5.0,"Very nice basic cardigan, looks and feels much more expensive, so a bargain!"
5.0,"I wish I would of orders these straps before the other ""cheap-o's"" I used to receive.  These feel very comfortable and are also durable.<br />*No regrets"
5.0,Love the hat got one for my grandson and his father. I would buy again.
5.0,This is by far the best thing I’ve bought very durable very flexible very comfortable and cheaper than the Apple ones which I think these are way better
5.0,wonderful gift idea. great quality.
5.0,This dress is very flattering. Accentuates all the right places! And it has pockets!! I ordered an XXL so that the waist would hit a bit lower. I am 5’4” & 210lb
5.0,Very attractive. Thanks
5.0,"My husband has been asking for some slippers for winter since we have tile floors throughout most of our house. These ones are really soft, simple design and supportive. He says it’s like walking on a cloud and is already wearing them even though it’s not really cold yet. The grey color goes with everything and I figured it wouldn’t show much dirt hahaha. I snuck my feet in them and they do really feel like a cloud! Way to go Amazon on providing great slippers in the right size on the first try!"
5.0,Luv the design. Get compliments all the time.
5.0,Love the color and the style.  Nice wallet for the price. Matches the purse I purchased it to go with.

5.0,Wife loves this dress and it's become her go-to outfit for casual outings :)
5.0,Warm and Fuzzy Just like I wanted.
5.0,I bought this for my woodworking. I like the material and the look of it. It’s not as comfortable as I would like but looks stylish and the material is nice and durable.
5.0,The quality of the material is great. It looks adorable on my granddaughter
5.0,"This hat fits snugly and keeps me warm and toast in the cold temperatures.  If I get too warm I simply lift the ear flaps.  I've received a number of compliments, this hat is cute on!  It doesn't provide shade from the sun - I saw that listed when purchasing, not a problem - I love this hat!"
5.0,Far exceeded my expectations I love the material and the straps make it so you can adjust accordingly also has a spot for a filter. I have received many compliments. Even though it took a minute to get here it was worth the wait.
5.0,"Its costume like, but that's nothing didnt expect. It's still really well fitting and pretty, I love it alot ❤"
5.0,"I thought this dress was the absolute CUTEST thing! I work at a salon so I wanted a dress that I could wear for work that wasn’t too short but still very pretty. This was the perfect choice!<br /><br />I’m roughly 5’4-5’5 and I’m about 175 so I got this in a large. It fits so beautifully and I am so in love with the pockets, I got SO many compliments on it lol I’m pretty curvy and busty but it still fit so well. I love it, definitely ordering more colors!<br /><br />Only thing that sucks is that it drags on the ground a little. Possibly because I’m kinda short I guess, but yes, it does drag. Not enough to make me take a star away, but still keep that in mind!"
5.0,Purchased as a gift. The recipient loved it. Looks exactly as pictured.
5.0,Bought one pair for my toddler then bought another pair for my infant. Super cute!
5.0,"Great Product, as described"
5.0,Great simple watch. Accurate and durable for the price. I tried saving a few dollars by getting a knockoff but the quality was terrible. It gained time quickly and soon broke.
5.0,Should  have  bought  a large  instead  of  xlarge  will  purchase  again
5.0,"I bought this for a minotaur costume, had an amazing time for Halloween."
5.0,"Finally broke down and replaced the rubbery strap that came with my Smartwatch a couple of years ago. These replacement straps are very good! Easy to replace the old strap with the new one, and the leather is much more comfortable than the original which was making my wrist itch. Shipped quickly too. I bought this black one and also their brown one and am sure I will order more. Recommend!"
5.0,"Love the little pocket, my iPhone fits perfect."
5.0,"Perfect! Fast release, awesome fit!"
5.0,Longer than expected but beautiful colors!
5.0,Based off of the reviews I ordered a size up for my daughter. They fit perfect and are excellent quality. I've ordered all of the styles!
5.0,a little large but I expect some shrinkage. I can wrap it about me and sit in my chair and I find that it is quite warm for me to doze. the sleeves are quite long but fold up easily and they stay  and look like a cuff. it does stop any drafts around my legs. the best part is the pockets it seems I am always in need of tissues and I can fit half a box in easily. lastly the hood is great. at seventy five I doze and pull the hood down over my eyes. some at my age may find it a little heavy. as for the size you may have several men of different sizes with different size robes on and where the length comes and where the arms come unfolded.<br />Thanks<br />Grampa
5.0,So cute and keeps our teenager from losing her keys. It’s large enough to be easily seen but not too big to carry on her wrist like a bracelet when she’s out.
5.0,Very pretty. Looks very much like a very popular French silk scarf brand.... No one will ever know the difference!
5.0,"I love my new gloves! Outside is opening back up, spring has begun! Now that it's time to let fresh air in and start going out again, I found a solution for sprucing up my house and keeping my nails looking presentable. These gloves are durable and can handle the very hot water I like for dishwashing. There is a scrubby texture on the palms and finger tips, so I use them to clean each other while still on the hands after I get them dirty. The grip also helps with hand washing clothes. There are 4 in a pack so you can have for different chores if you like. My sleeves stay dry, my nail polish lasts, and you can't believe the pleasure of not worrying about jewelry when you just want to jump in and scrub something! But the best part are the embossed heart shapes on the sleeves. They add sweetness to an otherwise utilitarian object. The color itself reminds me that these are natural and doesn't dissuade my partner from enjoying them too (which is the real way I achieved my original objectives hee hee.)  ...If I may read your fortune in the soap suds: the new order of things may have you online shopping more often, so keep your tape measure and conversion charts handy to avoid unecessary anguish over the size and origins of a product. It won't matter where the product is made if the largest and smallest sizes on the chart tells you that it will not fit you. The chart provided by the maker of these gloves is detailed and accurate and gave me a perfect fit. Give yourself a half of an inch, but don't go too big as that will make them slip and let water in.  Happy spring to you!"
5.0,Very light  and perfect to run  on indoor soccer .
5.0,"Love this line!!! This is my second. I own 2 Skagens and a couple of others and these look just as nice. I get compliments all the time. Love the fit and accuracy. First one still going strong after a year for under 30 bucks! First one included an extra battery, this one did not. You cannot go wrong with these!"
5.0,I liked the variety of sizes of butterflies.  I do wish I could have purchased just silver as I paint them n wax them n the silver is the easiest to cover.  However the others work fine.
5.0,she likes it
5.0,Just received this . It feels very solid.  Took a picture to show how its hanging . But I need to adjust to my size . I'd recommend this
5.0,"So warm and HUGE. Can double as a blanket. Fuzzies EVERYWHERE even after several washings. I actually cut mine...it was so large. Warm, as well."
5.0,Nice fit. Surprisingly soft material for linen!
5.0,The necklace is cool...it looks good I to wear with white shirt and jeans
5.0,"Excellent handbag, genuine leather (cow), perfect size,."
5.0,Very cute an simple
5.0,Really cute glasses for the price. Very happy.
5.0,Nice fit. Hard to find slim Bootcut jeans at a reasonable cost
5.0,I love this dress! It is so comfortable. It does have an unfinished look to the edges but that's part of the style. The pockets are fine. I am 5'5&#34; and 145lbs and bought a size medium. Pear shape. I haven't washed it yet but I plan to not run it through the dryer and just hang dry.
5.0,This dress is amazing. The jersey material is of great quality! It fits great and feels even better. I love it! One thing if you want it to as baggy as the model you should order a size up otherwise getting the size you wear will just hang comfortably but not baggy. I love this dress!
5.0,this is a nice blazer it looks of higher quality
5.0,This dress is so pretty and fit  true to size! I love mine!
5.0,Love the fit and feel.
5.0,"Nice colors, very elegant and formal looking, glad I purchased.  Shipped quickly and matched coat perfect."
5.0,Loungefly is amazing. It’s on the pricier side but I’m so In love with my bag! I get so many compliments.
5.0,"Good quality fabric, medium heft--not thin and flimsy, as some inexpensive sweatshirts are. A good buy for the price (I paid around $15.00)."
5.0,Oh my gosh this blouse is so gorgeous so trendy and so comfortable yet makes me feel and look thinner ! Perfect fit as I like my clothes to not be too lose I like to accentuate my body (lol) I'll def order more in different colors!
5.0,"It was always hard for me to find a belt my husband didn't mind wearing but he never liked the holes or didn't like the fit. But with this type of belt, it really has helped him feel more comfortable in a belt."
5.0,Grandkids love them
5.0,"Strap is very pretty, very much Hawaiian looking.  Very soft."
5.0,I like that they are simple and elegant. I would like to have more colors to coordinate with my outfits.
5.0,These skirts have a very forgiving fit.  You can fold over the waist band to make them shorter.  They are very stretchy without feeling tight.  They hang beautifully with a slight flair at the bottom.  The only possible downside is that they should be dry cleaned or hand washed and dryed hung or flat.  For me that will be hand wash as there is no dry cleaner in our town.  I am very pleased with them and can recommend them as a wonderful bargain.
5.0,Had to return as mine was defective but it was really cute for the price.
5.0,Very pretty and super high quality. :3
5.0,Perfect for a night out or a small purse for a little girl
5.0,"Fit perfect, slightly longer in the back to compensate for women with a booty, big pro on shorter length dresses"
5.0,"Got this bag for my wife and she fell in love with it! Very nice material, stylish, great size for what she carries, looks awesome!"
5.0,"The material is lightweight, soft and a perfect fit"
5.0,This dress is adorable. I get so many compliments on it! It’s super comfortable as well. Great find and buy!
5.0,"I really love this sweater and get lots of compliments on it! I was really surprised at how good the quality is too. It is one-size only but runs smaller than the picture (typical of Asian clothing). It looks like an oversized fit in the picture but fit more like a regular sweater. I'm 5'6, 125 lbs, and a 34C and wear small in sweaters from GAP or Express. I'd imagine it'd be too small for anyone that wears large or bigger."
5.0,"Because of how much I sweat out of my head, I have to wear a headband for any sustained exercise (even walking).  But conceding I have to wear one to me doesn't mean looking mismatched.  So I bought this collection of headbands, which allows me to match them with the various colored shirts I wear while walking.  I look less goofy in race photographs now and I can see where I'm going by the end of the race."
5.0,As described very cute
5.0,"It's so pretty, I can't wait until the weather is warmer and I can pair it with a white t-shirt!"
5.0,Bought as a gift for my husband. He loves it.
5.0,It is not a flimsy bracelet. It is great quality. I recommend this highly. I am going to order more as gifts.

5.0,"Good product, as described."
5.0,"I love this dress! It fits beautifully. I’m trying to find more dresses, from this seller.<br />I hope you see this and get back back to me."
5.0,Perfect sizing all the way around and looks terrific
5.0,give me more fit/tone body
5.0,Classy look and fit great.
5.0,"Loved these as soon as I put them on. I am 5'5"" and about 145 lbs and ordered size medium. The material is fantastic and nothing about them feel cheap, but somehow.. they are incredibly cheap. Just went back and bought a second pair."
5.0,"This scrub cap is so adorable.  Very well made and not too heavy where you will sweat, and the buttons are placed perfectly for my N95 mask.  I also have very long hair, that I can twist into a low bun and this will tie around it. What I love the most? they are a small business and we need to support them now more than ever!  I bought two, this one and a plain black one.  I will absolutely stay with this company.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Disappointed. I ordered a Youth large but my grandson recieved a full large. He was not happy with the color either. We will be returning this order by UPS from Great Falls Montana.
5.0,These ties are gorgeous and came as expected. I really like that they're matte and soft.
5.0,"My husband wears a size 14 shoe. They were a bit difficult to get on because they were so snug. Once we got them snapped, though, they were perfect."
5.0,fit just as implied. was given as a gift. the tiny details are very clear. good graphics and quality material
5.0,From my daughter love it

5.0,"This is for my husband, I did find it sort of short but is okay as my husband is.  He is a huge New York Giants fan and the graphic picture on the back is wonderful."
5.0,Very fashionable.  Easy to wear .
5.0,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to order an XL. I am 5'6&#34; with a 34&#34; bust, 27&#34; waist, and 36&#34; hips. Normally, I would order a S or a M if the sizing was based off of realistic measurements, but this brand seems to cater to smaller sized women. Not a problem, I just sized up and its perfect. The print is even more beautiful in person."
5.0,This is very cute and functional.  I gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter Birthday , she loved it make her feel like a star !"
5.0,"Bought these for my daughter. Colors are vibrant. Bracelets are more subtle than others I’ve seen. Perfect for preteens. That side, I’ve worn them myself and been complimented. Super cute accessories. Great gift idea. Great value."
5.0,Fits Great!!!!!!  Love it
5.0,Super cute necklace--goes with everything and so many fun ways to wear it!
5.0,"I have several pieces of this red Delsy luggage, and was searching for the matching personal bag.  The department stores that usually carry it were all sold out of this bag in red.  They only had blue left, which, of course, wouldn't work.  Only on Amazon was I able to find the red bag and at a reasonable price.  I just love it"
5.0,Super cute and soft leggings
5.0,"best band I have had strong easy to keep clean does not hold odors, great for active people."
5.0,"I love the Greg Norman Polos!! They are incredibly soft, come out of the dryer wrinkle-free, and last forever. I have washed this shirt numerous times and it never pills or gets snags. It is truly PERFECT. Plus, it is great for these HOT summer months. I would highly recommend this polo."
5.0,My wife loves these things as they look good for years and stay in place during running or other exercise routines.
5.0,Love love my boots
5.0,These look so good on my friend face I got it as a gift for him looks really nice on his face
5.0,"I got this necklace for my autistic daughter who is extremely hard on her jewelry.  This is a beautiful and sturdy necklace without having to double reinforce to prevent breakage with a different clasp.  Clasp and nedklace still intact, beautiful quality, and GREAT PRICE!!"
5.0,Fantastic! Super soft and look great!
5.0,"Excelent product, nice and strong. Good looking material, nice feeling to the touch. Plenty of room inside. I carry an iPad Air 2 inside, among other things, but it could take a regular size laptop with no problem."
5.0,My daughter and niece love these!
5.0,Makes my husband look very muscular with the style of this shirt.
5.0,These were the perfect present for my daughter and her roomies! And the size was perfect. They were soft too. They loved them.

5.0,"Have trouble finding shoes with support, good fit and comfort. These are outstanding. Best walking shoes I've ever owned."
5.0,"This belt has a multitude of uses.  With a loose blouse or dress, as a renaissance accent.  And Zi wore as a belt being Captain Hook for Halloween and was comfortable all day."
5.0,So gorgeous I love it
5.0,Very nice!  Look great!
5.0,Nice pants however they are smaller than described. Ex. If you wear a 12 get a 16
5.0,"Beautiful, but runs on the small side. A tight fit at seven inches"
5.0,This 3 pack was a great deal! My daughter gets so many compliments on her hats. Love the dark blue! They fit from about 6 months up unless you have a baby with a high head circumference.  My daughter has been wearing them for about 2 months and just the pink one is snug. However- she spit up on that one and it got washed. I would recommend hand washing or setting on something to stretch out the hat as it dries to keep it from shrinking. Overall I would purchase again and recommend.
5.0,Me Quedo Muy Bien. Y Es Muy Agradable La Tela.
5.0,I absolutely love this bag! It's so soft and well made.
5.0,Got this for my boyfriend who is a die hard Green Bay fan. It fits true to size and he wears it all the time. It’s held up well too! Highly recommend!

5.0,Daughter really liked it. Perfect size for the essentials. Very happy. Pretty color.
5.0,pretty boots look nice
5.0,"These arrived super fast and were so cute! Exactly as described and very comfortable if a little big, plenty of room for warm socks. The width around the calf is slightly large, even with the laces tied very tight. I have larger calfs but I think this may be too big for some people. Overall I love them, thinking of buying them in another color as well."
5.0,Muy hermosas
5.0,Just what I needed  As described and delivered promptly  Thank you

5.0,Excellent non ribbed shirts!
5.0,Using as a change purse
5.0,A compliment magnet! Be ready to be noticed!<br /><br />I ordered in a two tone Burgundy. The color is beautiful. The beanie fits nice. I would have loved if it was a bit more slouchy. But it's amazing as such!
5.0,My bridesmaids absolutely loved these earrings. I also ordered an extra pair for myself after and i'm thinking about ordering for my soon to be mother in law as well. They offer several other earrings that are similar if you prefer more simple or more extravagant. Either way it was the perfect gift.
5.0,Came quickly and just as described!
5.0,Wife likes them - that is all that matters.
5.0,"This is my first time purchasing these wraps.  I am speechless (in a GOOD way!!)  They are stretchy, wide and long.

5.0,This robe is colorful and silky! It was a good buy for the price. It's lightweight and I like that it comes with a belt. Would recommend.
5.0,LOVE THESE! I have gotten compliments on them every single day I’ve worn them
5.0,Loved it.  Its perfect for what i needed it for. I used it under a low cut dress for a wedding and it did the job great it made the dress a little less revealing but still kept it sexy
5.0,Its everything I wanted
5.0,"Great quality affordable basic tshirt. Thick but light and breathable fabric. Affordably priced. Fits my husband well. Ordered a XL and he is 6’1” approx 220 lbs, muscular build. He’s a fan. It’s soft and doesn’t hold in too much heat. Would recommend."
5.0,Very hood quality I like it it stylish too
5.0,"There are better pineapple shirts out there, but it was what I expected, so happy purchaser."
5.0,Very soft. Fits nice. Hides my muffin top nicely. Good quality.
5.0,These are thick and look great!
5.0,My grand daughter turned 2 and is obsessed with Minnie! She put all of her &#34;friends&#34; in the suitcase right away!
5.0,Lack of compartments.  Maybe a before strap with a key clip.
5.0,I'd definitely buy again.
5.0,"Fit was good. My 10 year old loves it, and it has a good quality feel to the fabric."
5.0,"It's too adorable! Yes, I agree with other buyers, order it at least 2 sizes larger."
5.0,Comfortable sock and very lightweight
5.0,"My father,, an 80 year old AF Vet, is now proudly showing his colors with the grill cover.  Looks great, seems to be substantial and fits."
5.0,These sunglasses are wonderful. I love the look of them and the fact that the lenses protect my eyes from the sun without making everything around me look too dark. The carrying case is also great! I can throw them in my purse and don't have to worry about them being scratched by my purse. Very happy with this product.
5.0,Pretty and easy to use.
5.0,My granddaughter loved this dress! It was so cute and she wanted to wear it again right away. It fit well and the material was super soft. It did not shrink in the washer and came out of the dryer looking brand new.
5.0,Bought for my son. True to size and love the color
5.0,Its was what I expected. A very nice hat for the price. Would recommend as a cheaper alternative to a more expensive brand.
5.0,These underwear are absolutely adorable! They are soft and stretchy. My 4 year old son is 45” tall and weighs 42 lbs. He has very thick thighs so the briefs I have bought him in the past are tight around his legs. I bought him the XL in these underwear and they are perfect! He even has a little room for growth. Highly recommend these undies!
5.0,"I used the size chart on this and it fit exactly right. I am 5'4 145lbs and I got a large, but I also have a larger chest, if you have a smaller chest go with a medium. Shirt is well made and comfortable, not sheer at all. Will buy in other colors"
5.0,"Love this dress, fit perfect and looks just like the picture. I'm 5'6 130 and I ordered a small"
5.0,I like this beautiful bracelet. It is also very comfortable for me.
5.0,"This is a great jersey! The material is perfect and not cheap feeling. Quality shirt, and im very picky about clothes. I bought this to use for paintballing since it was hot and I needed breathable clothing that covered up my skin. Good multi purpose shirt! I am going to use it for snowboarding this year as well. Great fit. Recommend"
5.0,"I give this item as a gift to my sister on her birthday. She love it. It's so beautiful that I order silver  color of same kind for myself, hope to receive it so."
5.0,"This is a must have.! I love how super soft the material is, I love how it feels against my skin. The robe keeps you warm and is long.! I ordered a medium which is my own fault but I should have gotten my normal size. All in all I love everything about this robe.!! Highly recommend.!!"
5.0,Looks cool just like pic
5.0,Very comfortable and offers a lot of protection to your clothes. And funny graphic
5.0,My daughter loves the colors and they are very comfortable. The little flowers sewn on each pair is such a pretty touch. Best quality I have seen in little girls underwear. Will definitely order these again.

5.0,"A classic, dependable, little-frills time-keeper. Super lightweight and easy to set up."
5.0,Nice hat. Would buy again

5.0,great fit true to size
5.0,love this - a tiny bit small but it's  5 stars for me ty
5.0,"I bought this for my Nana, of course, and I cannot wait to see her face light up when she opens her gift. It's really beautiful and dainty just like I assumed it would be! Shipped rather quickly then I thought it was going to be"
5.0,Verg beautiful shirt but I wear a xl a s it fit like a med. I'm re ordering a bigger size. Bc I love the shirt
5.0,"product is very light weight and not stiff fabric, boosts confidence as it flatters the figure! I was worried that this too would show off more than I wanted to but I am very pleased with the coverage!"
5.0,Excellent Tie! I love it!
5.0,One of the cutest skirts I own.
5.0,Cheerful design and good colors.  Convenient way to carry just essentials from casual wear to occasions. Strap is very useful.
5.0,Tuve que ordenar dos veces la primera me había quedado grande. Solo recomiendo que la compres una o dos tallas más chica. En mi caso yo necesito algo que me compima brazos y abdomen por eso ordené la talla chica.
5.0,It worked greT
5.0,It's for my daughter for her birthday
5.0,"I bought these as an accessory to my Demon Slayer Nezuko costume and they were perfect!! Now I don't recommend them if you're walking around much, by the end your feet will hurt. But they were very true to the character."
5.0,"My daughter is little for her age and it came right to the ground. (She could still walk fine lol) it is a bit big on her but she loves it and so do I. Plus this just means she can keep it longer anyway. Soft to the touch as well which is nice because lace usually makes her ""itchy""."
5.0,Perfect for my daily life. Great fit.
5.0,Comfortable and easy to use!
5.0,I purchased this for my husband when he had shoulder surgery and it was the best purchase we made!  We put in on him before he left the hospital and slept in it for days after.  Never had to lift his shoulder at all.  Definitely worth the purchase.
5.0,We used them at Disneyland and they were perfect!
5.0,Beautiful but it runs small..love it!
5.0,"Both my granddaughter & I are fans of no show socks. Between the two of us, we own several pair and wear them almost exclusively. Up until now, my favorite brand were Nike, but they’ve been bumped from the #1 spot! These no show socks from Kosy Komfort are very soft. They’re thicker than most no show socks because they’re padded at the heel and ball of the foot, but not so thick it makes our shoes tight. Unlike other no show socks that have a low scoop and an elastic band that can become too tight across the top of the foot, Kosy Komfort no show socks are cut with a slightly smaller scoop and a ribbed knit band that holds the sock in place. The ribbed band is both softer and more comfortable than the elastic other brands use (see photo for comparison). Additionally, there are rubber strips in the back of the sock to keep the sock in place on your foot. The socks are made from lightweight cotton that allow your feet to breathe reducing moisture and odors. Overall, these socks are the most comfortable no show socks I’ve ever worn. I love the pastel shades and the contrasting trim too."
5.0,I gave this to a friend of mine and she loved it and wore it right away as a pendant..everything about it is perfect. thanks so much-give this an A++++++
5.0,"The size says 2t to 3t. My son is just transitioning into 2t, and it will take him a while to fit properly into this shirt. It's a good quality and looks just like the pic! So cute!"
5.0,Beautiful scarf.  I wore it yesterday and received many compliments.  I am wearing it right now.
5.0,Absolutely love it!! The zipper doesn’t get jammed and it’s very spacious
5.0,"Nice weight, beautifully made, and gorgeous color."
5.0,This is a high quality mask. It has an insert able filter and is adjustable. I love the doggie print!
5.0,Great looking and easy wearing tops. There are actually 2 tops here. I got the black and brown. They can be worn separately or together (or at least I suppose they could). I only wear one at a time because they have enough coverage that I don't feel I need to double up and that gives me 2 shirts instead of one. The fabric is nice. It's smooth and lightweight without being flimsy or see through. They work well for every day which is what I've been using them for. I really like the look and feel of them.
5.0,Just what my son was looking for.
5.0,This is my favorite new top. The colors are beautiful and the length is good. I also like the long sleeves. I'm just under 5'4&#34; and the arms aren't ridiculously long and the hem doesn't go to my knees. It's not perfect; a taller person could wear it too. And the material is a little thin. But it's gorgeous and I get a lot of compliments!
5.0,love these headbands for my baby girl! they are very soft and fit her perfectly! no rough edges and stayed the same size after washing & drying.
5.0,Me encanto muy cómodos y buenos
5.0,"Love these shoes. Very comfortable, my wide feet fit just right into them."
5.0,Very comfortable and flattering.  Wash and dry like a dream.
5.0,"This item is fabulous, warm and over-sized in style. I wear mine as winter loungewear. I am 5' 5"" and 145 and the small is very roomy and the length is perfect. Washes and dries like a dream. I am wearing one for the second season and buying more!"
5.0,Love the material. I can dress up or down. I ordered black/white pokodots then ordered 2 more of these dresses in other colors. Love the way it looks on me
5.0,great thanks.
5.0,"This tape works, the price is good, and it arrived promptly. I guess I have a small head because now all of my hats fit better"
5.0,"Great Length!! These shorts are long enough to cover your knees, but not so long that they look ridiculous. Great quality, and a matching belt for free! Remove straps in the legs, wash with fabric softener, and iron, and you're good to go!"
5.0,"This is very flattering, especially if you are plus size like me and want to hide your tummy without wearing spanks in the summer heat"
5.0,I ordered one size up and it was perfect. Bottoms and top work together to slim you in the places you want it. I definitely recommend this bating suit.
5.0,Looks and feels great. My husband loves it! I'm glad I decided on this one.
5.0,Love it.  Love dragonflies.😍😍
5.0,Was a Christmas gift for my mother. She loves filigree jewelry. She was blown away by how beautiful the set was. I think I may get my own set soon!

5.0,Great size for a big guy like myself. Comfortable too.
5.0,"Very comfy, love that it looks ""dressy"" like my thin leather band but is silicone and can stand up to workouts. Means less changing bands, and is a nice dressy, feminine look with a less chunky band."
5.0,Beautiful and cute dress. Like it very much.
5.0,"Love it, a little too long for me but only because I'm short. Very thin cover up for the summer, when you don't want to carry around a jacket. Will but it in other colors"
5.0,I am 3x(22) top and 2x (20) bottom and it fits me the same as controlled tights from lane Bryant
5.0,sleeves were a bit short and tight in shoulders. material is top quality
5.0,heavy duty and as described.
5.0,This was a gift for my husband and he really likes it.  It fits well and washes well.
5.0,"I'm glad I purchased the set of all the different sizes. Having 3 holes in one ear, I like different sizes of the same earring.  This set has very pretty colors and I can match any outfit.  I will probable never wear the largest ones are they are a bit too big for me, or the smallest one as they are the right size for a child.  But the others are perfect!  I also like that they included plenty of backings."
5.0,Todo muy bien. Es lo que me esperaba
5.0,Love these new watch bands! Colors were true to what was displayed on site. I’ve been switching out the bands regularly. No Issues so far. Would buy again.
5.0,These are my favorite pants. They fit perfectly and are so comfortable but look amazing. The color is fabulous. I will definitely order more as soon as I can. If these were the only pants I was allowed to wear for the rest of my life I would be happy
5.0,"i really enjoy this device. i have a pocket full of keys for many purposes in my job. every time i squat down i was getting stabbed in the thigh. ugh. i came across this thinking that it was a little odd and really unsure if it would work right for my purposes. it took a little time to get things just right to fit perfectly. this product has saved my thigh from getting stabbed by keys on a daily basis. i think i will have to buy one for my boss, because he has more keys than i do.<br /><br />price is very right for how this can save your leg"
5.0,Purchased for 5 year old.  She loved it.  Good quality for the price
5.0,They look amazing with my white frames
5.0,Loved it. Great quality. Runs a size small.
5.0,This bag is used daily by my fiance. The added carry strap is a nice touch. The rope straps feel sturdy and thick and the bag material seems very durable.
5.0,"Me encanto, buena calidad de tela."
5.0,Love this coat.  Not too heavy for Dallas nor is it too light.  Just right.  I usually wear XL but ordered 1X & am very glad I did. I probably could have worn a 2X as the coat run a tad small & I like a roomy coat.  But loved the price & loved the coat.  Highly recommend it
5.0,great sparkle
5.0,Great fpr grocery shopping
5.0,I believe this brand is one of the better quality. Nice looking and pretty easy To install.

5.0,I came back for the purple one.  Love sweet paw.. may have to come back for another color.  They are so cute.
5.0,"Fits nicely, a little snug.  Even though it looked very thin, it keeps her warm working in a freezer."
5.0,"I recently purchased 3 of these workout shirts. One of them had a snag after the first wash and the seller quickly offered me a replacement. After multiple washes, the new shirt has not had a problem. The first one must have had an issue with the stitching.  As for the fit; it is great for it covers up enough, so my pecs and nipples are not exposed."
5.0,"Packing cubes are a traveler's best friend.  Love this size for my larger clothing items, put it in, zip and viola more room in your suitcase than you had before!  They are also great for keeping you organized with shirts and undergarments etc all neatly squared away.  Keeps clothes tidy and suitcase organized with a little extra room for the souvenirs!"
5.0,LOVE this dress!!
5.0,wow this hat is amazing! super good fit and a lot more comfortable than expected ( due to the great price) this hat came 3 weeks earlier than expected and overall it is a must ! great buy! for sure ordering again :)
5.0,This dress exceeded my expectations it is much better quality than I expected for an inexpensive sun dress.
5.0,Very well crafted dirndl with beautiful details. I have received many compliments on this and the quality feels that it will last for a long time. Well worth the price.
5.0,love the colors and how they’re all adjustable so i can make any of them chokers or not and wear seperately or all together
5.0,"Beautiful, just as shown, looks great and has a pic of my doggie so whats not to love!"
5.0,"Great hat, Very comfortable, this has become my favorite hat and i wear it every day! Very pleased with the camo pattern and color."

5.0,"It looks very pretty, size is perfect."
5.0,Loved these Pajamas.
5.0,"This appears to be a good buy.  Unfortunately I won't be able to give them a good test for a few weeks, when we go to the mountains.  But the fit is good, and they look like they will be warm."
5.0,"I got the beige one and it's really more of a taupe color but that's okay. I love that this purse has just the right amount of pockets and the bag expands, too! I plan to use it on an upcoming vacation as I think it's the prefect travel purse."
5.0,"Great buy, highly recommend."
5.0,Very soft material to coddle the boys.<br />Breath well. I think they are the best I’ve tried and I’ve tried several types. This is my 2nd order.
5.0,It is a lovely necklace
5.0,"Love the size of the bag, dislike the shoulder strap. This bag needs a better strap that adjust for Individual use."
5.0,So pretty and I've gotten so many compliments!!  They stay in place the entire time I wear them
5.0,Fantastic value for perfect gym & walking shoes! These are so stylish and comfortable. I am in love!
5.0,Clarity of vision.  Nice fit.  Comfortable.
5.0,Very soft and lightweight just like I expected.
5.0,"It was a Christmas gift for my daughter, she loves it and put it to good use right away 👌"
5.0,"Really cute shirt, very lots of comments on it from the kiddos at school."
5.0,I took this to Hawaii recently and it worked out great.  I love the blue detailing on the top which makes it unique.  It holds a lot without being too big.  I just wanted to leave my expensive bags at home and carry something easy and light.
5.0,"This is really a great bag. For nearly 20 years, I have carried an Ogio locker bag, which is extremely convenient in the locker room itself, but since it has a rigid frame, it's pretty heavy and cumbersome to carry. I finally tired of lugging it around and decided I wanted to find a truly small bag. I really need to carry little to the gym - I work out over lunch and the gym is in my office, so all I really need in the bag is a pair of shorts, a t-shirt, a pair of socks, a pair of running shoes, a pair of shower sandals, a pair of headphones and a hair brush. This little bag handles all of that with ease, and the small form factor makes it both easy to carry and simple to slip in a locker. I  see a lot of guys in the gym with absolutely enormous bags, largely empty, and was really glad to find this small one that still has enough space what little stuff I do need to carry. It wasn't an easy search!<br /><br />For those wondering about the shoe pocket: I am a guy and wear a size 10.5, and my shoes fit in the pocket just fine. I was worried that they might not, as most of the reviews seem to be from women, but lo and behold, this was not a problem at all. It's easiest to put my shoes in there when there's nothing else in the bag at all, but now that I have figured that out, it's not an issue.<br /><br />Other things of note:<br /><br />The navy color is very attractive and neutral. It seems like Vooray's products are largely marketed towards women, but in the dark navy color, this bag is works great for me as a guy.<br /><br />The metal hardware is clearly of high quality. Everything appears to be really well constructed.<br /><br />There are ample pockets, both inside and out, and the large zippered one inside easily holds my wallet, keys and whatnot while I exercise, while the faux-fur lined one on the outside easily accommodates my phone.<br /><br />On the navy mesh version of the bag that I bought, the handles are not leather, as described, but rather are covered in the same navy mesh fabric as the rest of the bag. Not a big deal, and also fairly apparent from the photos, but just something to be aware of. Also, while the handles are indeed (very weakly) magnetic, that function really doesn't seem to work very well, but I don't really see the need for it anyways, so I won't deduct any points for that.<br /><br />All in all, this bag was a great purchase and is fulfilling my needs perfectly! If you're looking for a very small, highly functional gym bag, look no further!"
5.0,I absolutely love the shoes. My kids love them too. The lights are epic! Stitching is great.
5.0,beautiful tshirt
5.0,"This dress is exactly as I anticipated and perfectly described by the seller. A loose t-shirt dress. The material is nice and light, even if a bit thin. It fit as expected. The sleeves, neck and chest all fit like I would expect my t-shirts to fit while the body of the dress was loose and flowy. I am 5'3, 150lbs, standard medium size (8-10 USA) 32G bra.<br />The size medium hung to just above my knee, which is what I was hoping for, without clinging to my backside. I really love the bright blue color and wish they sold the symmetrical dress in the same color because I just can't around the asymmetrical cut and am sending it back. It's just weird to me. The entire dress is cut at the same length except for one side of the front which is several inches longer.  It just seems odd.<br />Otherwise a great buy.<br />If I were to keep this dress I would not put it in the dryer for fear of it shrinking."
5.0,my grandma loves these
5.0,"Cute shirt casual, can be worn with jeans or even flowy yoga pants . Comfortable, you should probably wear a tank top underneath, the white one is pretty sheer. All in all a basic, simple addition to any wardrobe"
5.0,"If you love Christmas parties as much as I do, you'll definitely want this dress to feel extra festive!"
5.0,"The larger pair is thinner and very large! I will probably wear them occasionally. But I love the smaller pair! They are thicker and a little heavier than other clip ons I have, but they have secure clips and stay on well. I will buy this brand again!"
5.0,I am very happy with my cover it has held up well.  Thank you
5.0,Buy
5.0,My grand daughter loves it
5.0,Awesome! The
5.0,Look ok but too heavy for me
5.0,Great shorts love that they are a little stretchy!
5.0,"i like to wear these fingerless gloves nippy mornings and evenings (los angeles) or whenever i want to feel warmer. they're thin, but cozy. after ordering and receiving them in cream, i ordered both gray and black. they are generously sized; i have large hands and long arms."
5.0,Love this necklace! Wore it with many differently styled outfits during vacation also with business casual dress for ofice. Length is great. I've only had it for over a week but quality seems good as well.
5.0,"This Buckle is a good piece of art in and of its self. Not too big. Not too small and the polished pewter-like appearance is beautifully done. I'd like to have them make one with the head of a TX Long Horn Steer. Anyhow, if you purchase one you'll love it."
5.0,I got these for my girlfriend for her birthday because I thought they looked cool. But my girlfriend absolutely loves them and wears them very often. This was an excellent purchase. She says &#34;the colors of the trees look exactly like the pictures and they are very good quality rings. They are not too heavy to feel bulky and not too light too.&#34;
5.0,was as shown
5.0,"Same as pictured, nice earrings"
5.0,"like it, works well. just keep rolling up"
5.0,"This is a great quality shirt, but runs pretty small!! I normally wear an XL/ 40D and I ordered a 3XL and fit like an XL but kinda baggy through the armpit area. I wanted to be able to tie it up around the waste and it just barely ties."
5.0,This suitcase is absolutely awesome! It's extremely light and it has a lot of room. The material it's not the must durable but for the price it is a bargain. The bottom tear up after my last trip but I took it in 7 different flights so I'm happy with the use I got out of it. Def getting another one before my next trip.
5.0,"Luckymens Women's Notch Collar Satin Pajama Set Long Sleeve, Red, XXL.<br />These are the best satin pajamas I have found, they're very soft, easy to wash, and fit perfectly.  I usually wear XL or XXL and purchased the XXL.  Happy that the shirt was a little baggy and the bottom was not tight.  The color is a bit more burgundy, than a bright red.  They're actually more luxurious than what the photo shows.  Purchased another in the blue.  Two thumbs up."
5.0,These are so cute. You can wear them to work with pumps and a blazer/cardi or my favorite- casual with a tee or oversized sweater half tucked with a pair of booties(and maybe a leather jacket)
5.0,It’s a great design and not too flashy.
5.0,Love these!! Color is exactly like the picture! It is wonderful to wear at the beach. Protects your eyes really well. And super cute!
5.0,"The material is of great quality and I love the slight stretch. I purchased the dark blue just to get out of my rut for black. I'm wearing this to a casual country wedding this weekend, maybe with a pair of cowboy boots! Lol.."
5.0,"This is a beautiful piece, it is smaller than I was expecting. About the size of a quarter, but still beautiful none the less. the silk cord it comes on does not do it justice!"
5.0,Very good cleat. I have wide feet so towards the end of the boot it gets tight but once you break them in it gets a little better. Very comfortable and light too. Overall feels great and looks clean.
5.0,"Cute, fits nicely.  Great price.  Good quality."
5.0,Super soft and fits great
5.0,"So cute. Bottoms looks safe with the slight suction feature. I ordered a size up for growth: at this price, they need to last ;-P My daughter absolutely loves them!"
5.0,"Very good case for my camera, great fit."
5.0,"I love my display case! It looks great, and it is the perfect way to put a collectible on display. Mo, the owner, really cares about his customers. I will never order another display case from anyone else."
5.0,So easy to use.  Washes up well.  Would recommend.
5.0,Beautiful!!!  Versatile!  Got lots of compliments!
5.0,Love this. Fits as expected.  I get compliments on it at work all day long =)
5.0,Is beautiful i can't wait to give it to my boyfriend for Christmas

5.0,Clean socks for my son who happens to be the world's number one fan of the O-ducks... They look great too!
5.0,"Love the dress, flattering top skirt just the right amount of material"
5.0,"it made me look so good, thank you! I love wearing this for outings with a sweater"
5.0,Good quality...quite heavy!  Good for winter.
5.0,Great fit.  Comfortable to wear
5.0,Super easy way to adjust the size fitting for the mask we all are wearing now.  In order to put on the elastic straps will need to get bobby pin to put on.  Just take couple seconds to put on.
5.0,"Love these sunglasses, perfect fit for me. No bouncing or slipping when I'm out running & getting sweaty."
5.0,"Not bad for the price - The neck area was a little large on me? but super fun dress and shipping was fast. I'm 5'2&#34;, 110 lbs - size 34 chest and I purchased a small. The length was a little long, but I'm on the shorter end of the spectrum? Also, if you're looking for the fuller look -purchase a petticoat to go underneath."
5.0,Nice 4th of July outfit
5.0,Bought this for my friend's daughter and she loved it!
5.0,"I bought this product because I'm a big Egyptian art fan, I recommend the site to anyone who asks about it."
5.0,Cutest shoe ever!  So many compliments!
5.0,Lo amé 🥰
5.0,The skirt is very lovely and feminine.  It is exactly what I wanted.
5.0,My daughter was ecstatic to get this delivery. Very good quality all around.  If she still has the set in 5 years I wouldn't be shocked. Perfect for the anime fan.
5.0,"This item is exactly as shown in the picture and the leaf detail midway through is beautiful up close. I am very happy with these gloves and more importantly they are warm, which for someone with poor circulation, means a great deal. I own multiple pairs of finglerless glove for just this reason and these are one of my favorites.<br />  My only concern has been that these gloves are obviously a hand wash only item and with one wash under its belt, the yarn has begun to get that cloud of frayed sections that you will be familiar with if you have ever worn wool. Still, I would recommend these gloves to anyone."
5.0,My dad loved the mask.
5.0,"Great cover, works properly"
5.0,I loved them so much I ordered  another pair they are so comfortable
5.0,These are really cute I haven't worn them yet but they look like they were made well..they fit perfect.
5.0,I'm 5'5-160lbs and the medium fits perfect. Have some room to move around so it's perfect. I love this dress already. The material is in the thicker side and the colors are just like in the picture.
5.0,Adorable and great material!
5.0,"The crayons gave me exactly what I needed, it last all day and can be wiped off effortlessly. Decent for the price."
5.0,The colors don't show up as much as I would have liked but my husband insists it is beautiful and can see all the color.
5.0,"This bag is great, it is long lasting and it has space"
5.0,Blah haha 😄
5.0,"Much better quality than expected, could be used daily, though it is a novelty.  It has a magnetic securement that works well rather than a cheap flimsy latch.  I will purchase more."
5.0,"I like the confortable theyre when they receive the light of the sun, your eyes rest enough from Uv rays.<br /><br />They are light weight and ver confortable when you where it totally worth it by a Great Price"
5.0,Up coming wedding
5.0,Super cute exactly as in the picture.My daughter loves them
5.0,I bought like 30 pants for resell and this one have the best quality
5.0,I've already worn it twice! it's so comfy and pretty! Fit perfectly. Pay attention to the size chart
5.0,Beautiful dress the color and the fit was perfect.
5.0,"These are pretty, and I love having a different necklace to wear with different outfits.  The price was great, too!"
5.0,"What a beautiful watch. My first real time piece, and it won't be my last from Orient. The second hand is smooth. The watch has great weight to it. The band does not pinch your hairs. Adjusting the band is also quite easy. I have a small wrist for a 6 ft male, and it fits me great. Great watch for under $200. I bought mine used for less, and couldn't be happier with a pre-owned watch. However the watch is 10 seconds slow every day. Which I read is not bad for a watch like this. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone."
5.0,My wife loves the hat! Fits great and keeps her head warm.
5.0,"Very strong glasses and comfortable, I’m wearing and using them for 4 months already"
5.0,"These socks cover more of your foot, so they don't slip off, and they don't show under my docksiders. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,"If you wanna spice up your wrist, get these.  You can get three at once in a package deal.  What's better than that?  A band for each outfit is fun!"
5.0,Bought these cute tights to jazz up my two year olds dance outfits and wow!!! Great quality and my little one has room to grow. Loved it so much I bought a pair<br />in white. Plan on using these for more than just dance but for fancy dresses
5.0,Beautiful and functional - great quality
5.0,"Fits amazing, looks way more professional than a standard tank top, you can actually see your muscles a lot more during a pump and you can just see a lot more muscles and watch them as you workout, I love these shirts bout to order another 3 pack right now. Amazing workout shirts"
5.0,exactly what I wanted
5.0,"This HODO SPORTS Men's UPF 50+ Long Sleeve Sun Protection Quarter Zip Pullover Shirt was exactly what I was looking for. My teen son is usually outside all day during the summer, and rarely remembers to reapply sunscreen. To make things safer and easier for him, I've been testing out lightweight, long sleeve pullovers that he could just throw on to cover up. This medium size, Dark Grey HODO SPORTS shirt arrived in good shape and well packaged. I was immediately impressed by its nice finishing and solid feeling zipper. My son tried it on and said that the shirt fits great, is comfortable, and exactly his size. He likes the attractive, heathered-looking pattern of the material, and the smooth feel of the shirt. He also thinks that the quarter zipper works well and is a good design addition. The fabric (100% polyester) is lightweight and doesn't make him overheat in warm weather. Best of all, the product information says that this shirt provides UPF 50+ protection which is very reassuring. Given how well this shirt worked out, I’ll likely order more of these from among the remaining colors (Navy, Black, Light Grey, and Maroon)."
5.0,Great rain poincho.  It is a little larger than the size on the package. The princess graphics on the back are lovely and cheerful.
5.0,I have already purchased several bracelets or necklaces from amorwing. They are very well made with excellent quality stones. Yes they are made with elastic but with common sense and with normal wear and usage I do not think that should present any problems. They seem pretty sturdy but I wouldn't play tug of war with any of them. I have been amazed with each item I have ordered at how much prettier each piece is in person compared to online. I do believe the stones/ beads are real quartz so I have no idea why another reviewer went on a rant about them. I truly am in love with every item that I have purchased from amorwing. The shipping time is also excellent as I believe these are shipped from overseas. You need to experience the quality of their jewelry yourself. &#34;This product was received at a di scounted price in exchange for my unbiased r eview.&#34;
5.0,These charms are very nice. They are all in good shape and I only found one out of the whole bag that was a little misshapen.
5.0,It’s so cute I 100% recommend
5.0,"This was not what I expected but the socks are better than I had imagined.  They cling as if made of some space age stretchy material, which I suppose they are.  I wanted something to wear around the house to keep my tootsies warm like socks but that I could also easily slip into my flip flops when I had to step outside for a minute or two to turn off the water or other small shore.  I looked for comfort----check. I wanted convenience....check.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money either----check.<br />  These are very light weight but do the job.  I like 'um.<br />  Blinding fast service as well."
5.0,"Love love love this fun top! Comfy!  Bought a 2X and I’m an XL-2X. Fit like I wanted! If you want it slouchy, size up!"
5.0,"I love this dress. I got the navy with flowers and it looks beautiful. It can be dressed up or down and used for many occasions or to lounge around. It fits loose like I thought it would. It is very long and hits the floor, but some nice tall wedges can fix that. I was very happy with the look, fit, and length. I bought a large and it was bigger than most large sizes, but it still worked for me. Also, LOVED the pockets. It hard to find dresses that have them."
5.0,"I like the Red, White and Blue"
5.0,I LOVE IT!! I get so many compliments 🥰
5.0,"This is a great sweatshirt! I ordered for myself a men’s medium which is a little big on me but gives me lots of room for a blouse, turtleneck to wear underneath it. The length is perfect to wear with leggings. The quality is top notch.  I wash in cold water, delicate cycle and add a little white vinegar in with detergent to keep color from fading also add fabric softener to rinse cycle. This practice keeps sweatshirt looking brand new!"
5.0,Very cute !! My daughte love it 🌹🌹
5.0,Good for dress up ! Like that it’s a bit longer than most I had seen
5.0,"Love this dress, super cute & comfortable. Good fit. It can be worn casually or can be dressed up for going out. Highly recommend"
5.0,Loved the set for using as bulletin board pins.
5.0,My daughter loves them.  They are durable and work well with mud season.
5.0,I Bought these for my wife's birthday. She loves them.She loves the long earwires and says they are very comfortable.
5.0,Good fit and good material
5.0,"It was a little big for me, I ordered a small. But I was able to pair it was a nice belt and that made up for the size. :)"
5.0,Arrived in a timely manner. Received what  I expected.
5.0,"I practice hot yoga and vinyasa, and after about 2 months of regular practice, these shorts have been a slammin success. I'm a a large fella from head to toe, and these fit me great. Enough room in the legs, and while you can definitely see what I have up front, I don't feel like I'm giving everyone in the room an unexpected sneak preview. The perfect fit for a guy like me with a little around the middle where I can have shorts fitted enough to float into plank and do inversions without them bunching or billowing like running shorts do, yet comfortable enough shirtless that I don't feel self-conscious like I do in tighter shorts. Buying another pair. The liner works great, and they breathe well."
5.0,A little tight but I loved it
5.0,"Thanks,  my wife loves it, she said its roomy,pretty and its her,s"
5.0,"Great scarve, very soft."
5.0,It's a good cosplay and I think the bag is bigger than the one I bought separately from another buyer.
5.0,My husband wears it everyday. It’s beautiful and lots of compliments from both genders.
5.0,"Great fit in all the right places. Did not shrink after washing. Will buy more, especially for the price!"
5.0,I love this necklace. It is heavy enough to feel that it’s there but not to heavy that it’s irritating. This is my second one. My first one broke after four years. The details are beautiful.
5.0,Great sunglasses for the price.
5.0,"Love this dress.  It was custom made and fits like a glove. Also, I was emailed from the dressmaker and they could not have been more attentive to my needs. Thank you so much,  the wedding is going to be a real joy for me."
5.0,Great bag! Much more stylish than the typical laptop bag and holds everything I need for both travel and daily use.
5.0,I am very pleased with this product! I hand roll clay beads to make rosaries and these are prefect.
5.0,I usually get these at Sam's Club. Found them here and am very happy with them.
5.0,Fits perfectly. Cute look and comfy
5.0,"Adorable and soft, light weight cotton.  My son loves them!"
5.0,Love it! Looks just like the picture and is true to size.....been wearing it every day for 2 weeks.....no issues!
5.0,Very comfortable and the quality was great. I bought the gray & wine color in a medium and they fit perfectly.
5.0,"So comfortable, cute and sexy. Fits true to size! I love this sleep shirt"
5.0,So beautifull and looks good.
5.0,"Nice casual chic sweater. It is warm and comfy, well made. The side pocket are not as deep as I would like but it can hold keys and small things in it. I love the color it is a nice comfy sweater for cold evening! I like the style as well."
5.0,"These earrings are a perfect complement to Swiss blue topaz, and turquoise jewelry."
5.0,"Very nice Cardigan.  Well packaged for delivery.  I ordered in black and just ordered the coral, which is too pink for coral, but I can make it work.  I just wish they had the 3/4 sleeve in aqua.  Very pleased."
5.0,Very nice bandana s. They will be large enough to block the dust and prevent us from breathing it in. When we go out on the side by sides.
5.0,I love the dress!!
5.0,"seems very sturdy for thin material that folds down to almost nothing flat. great item to pack inside a suitcase to bring back the goodies always rounded up on my trips home to visit family. not sure it will be sturdy enough for my husband to pack his hunting gear and throw around being he is a rough heavy handed man, but for casual use it seems it will be perfect. I can stuff a bag now, so I will come back with an update after my trip home this holiday season. love how the handle locks together to be at the ready. nicely constructed zippers with sturdy plastic tips. O rings on each end with a delightful surprise of a long shoulder strap that can be removed. This thing is big enough to fit a weeks worth of clothes, shoes, travel toiletry bag, seriously, I think I could fit my 7 year old grandson in there!! huge. reminds me of the size of an army duffel bag except a little shorter but bigger around. anyways. very pleased and excited to try it out"
5.0,I purchased this to carry into the football stadiums. It seems to be well made and is big enough to carry basics. I did not want one of the larger clear bags. I think I will be very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,"I love these so much. I bought 2, one in white and the other in estate blue, which was basically navy. They are very lightweight but I didn't buy them for warmth, more for just coverage so I can wear my sleeveless tops or dresses durring the winter. The material is crazy soft and the neck is a little higher in the back but you can fold it down, it looks good either way. The waterfall front is pretty. My white one is a little see through but, I mean it's white and that's just the way that goes usually, it's not like you're not going to be wearing something under this anyways. I'm 5'5 and 170lbs and I bought a large and it fits perfectly. The front hits me mid thigh and the back a little below my butt. Highly reccommend. I will be buying more."
5.0,"Shirt quality is great however due to being a slim fit, I'd recommend going up in size.  I ordered a small for my daughter who is 5'3 106 lbs and it was a snug fit."
5.0,Grand daughter loves them and they stay in her ears and small enough to not get snagged or pop open. She doesn't pull on them so I know they are comfortable for her.
5.0,"Love, love love this tote.<br /> Durable canvas, screen printing clear, colors bright. Very happy with my purchase"
5.0,Loved it used it for my daughters photo shoot and she looked beautiful. I also love the quality and prove. She will be using it to bake as well.
5.0,Very flattering dress! A tad on the short side but I am tall 6' I would definitely recommend this dress.
5.0,Very satisfied with the wallet and service. Five star rating.
5.0,"Great earrings.  I love, love ALOR jewelry. I have 5 pieces of ALOR and love them.  Jewelry is great, different, and I get a lot of compliments when I wear these earrings or any of ALOR jewelry.  Highly recommend"
5.0,Very strong
5.0,"I love the pants, I want to order another pair"
5.0,Cute dress-- a bit short.
5.0,"I like everything about this vest.  Comfortable, good fit, weight is just right for wearing over a thin long sleeved tee.  I now have two exactly the same.  Washes well and dries on hanger in no time!"
5.0,"I don’t write reviews often but felt the need to with these tops. Such great tops, great quality, I’m already living in them. The length hits me at a flattering point and the sleeveless cut is perfect to hide the bra overage :) Wish they had more colors and options because I’d buy them all."
5.0,I'm 5'4 bought size xl
5.0,I wore this for our gender reveal and it was PERFECT. It didn’t stick in any weird unflattering places AND it was super comfortable. Would buy again.
5.0,Great shoe for really good price!
5.0,Runs two sizes small it's more to return it than you paid for it! I gave it to the goodwill
5.0,"Love these slippers - exactly as expected! True to size, color matches photos, fur is soft. One thing I will call out is that they do not have a soft and cushy bottom, but it's very supportive.. which for me personally is a plus. You can certainly walk outside in them if needed (I saw another review say you can't). Now we wait to see the quality! If they last I will certainly buy more colors :)"
5.0,"Al usarlo se curo mi nuevo piercing (que había tardado mucho en sanar) este es el que ahora uso, muy contenta con la compra"
5.0,love the feel of the leather and the style
5.0,The package came in a little Ziploc clear bag with the information stickers on it and just thrown at my front door and it wasn't even zipped all the way so it wasn't delivered properly but if it's great I love the outfit though
5.0,Worked perfect on the Fiber Art Christmas wall hanging making for my daughter.
5.0,very nice piece.  Vendor shipped quickly.
5.0,"Nice design , Sturdy build"
5.0,Loved the quality. Looks great on color skirts!
5.0,My grandaughter is the most popular girl in school !!😀
5.0,Costume was as expected.
5.0,It's perfect.
5.0,Pretty and sturdy. Person who received it as a gift was happy.
5.0,"Perfect fit, great colors!  My nephew loves Godzilla and really liked this outfit!"
5.0,Gorgeous and looks real is beautiful
5.0,"Love it, super cute, noristudio has a great Etsy shop too"
5.0,Loved everything about this item!!! Grandson who is  14 Also loved them. Great color!
5.0,"Great little watch band! I love the stylish leopard print, but what I love most is how thing the band is. I don’t like a bulky watch band, so this is perfect!"
5.0,"This really takes the tarnish off silver, better than a dip that I use, better than any cleaner I have used!"
5.0,Had to buy these because of recent ankle surgery.  Wore them for some holiday shopping.  My foot and ankle did not swell up like it has done before.  You will get the pattern on your skin but it looks cute.  Any way love these socks.
5.0,Nice fit and weight for what I wanted.
5.0,"I've ordered two of these handbags, the clay (a soft, understated metallic that will complement gold, silver, etc.) and black. I am 5'2 and don't like to look like I'm on the way to the airport. The measurements are 13 1/2"" - top width by 13"" tall, but the top 3"" are slouchy and will fold over, making the overall size smaller. The leather is very soft and a pleasure to carry and use. The design is the best feature with 7 separate compartments. From the top, a magnetic closure conveniently closes one area (not like a zipper, but that's the place I keep my Daytimer). There are compartments inside of two side zippers, and extra sections inside the bag as well. It's very comfortable. Not terribly wild about the lining (a signature type silky rust animal print) which is the same in both colors. But it does make it easier to locate things, not matching the leather. The price on Amazon was very good. A great purchase!"
5.0,It is a cute shirt. Way to big but that's all my fault I am use to ordering china stuff and I order biggest always. I am going to rock this one as a night gown an order me another one to fit. So folks these fit true to size dont order bigger. I love it though the sleeves are lil past elbow so it's not really short sleep. I will stitch it if I need for summer. Over all great price and quality fast shipping
5.0,Great for a gift!!! :)
5.0,Nice quality thank youFirst delivery good quality can you send me your email so I can buy some more items for you guys thank you
5.0,Life changing.
5.0,This was just what I was looking for!  Simple easy and effective
5.0,It's true to size and fits my small feet. It's part cotton so breathes better
5.0,"not big glasses like some of the other electric glasses, awesome fit and real stylish. If you have a small/medium face and dont want huge shades these will fit perfect."
5.0,"Love, Love, Love this top!!!  Looks exactly like the picture.  The fit was just right"
5.0,Like this mask because it is soft and comfortable.  It is thick but breathable.  Love the bee. Save the bees.
5.0,Hella cute
5.0,Like this shirt alot and got tons of compliments!! 👍🏾👍🏾😊
5.0,Love this shirt for fall and the color! Goes well with black leggings or jeans. You can lift it up to fit as a crop top which I like. Love the sleeves. Not too hot or thick which is good for Texas fall weather. It’s also very comfortable. Would purchase in other colors. This item was sent to me for free in exchange for my honest opinion.
5.0,Perfect complement to my wedding dress!
5.0,"It's just a tad on the small side, but I still love it. Boxing days get a bit cramped with gloves in there and all other gym gear. I'd love an external bottle holder, but I knew all this before ordering. Fit and function, quality, finish, etc... all good to go. I'd recommend. For shoes, shorts, tank, lifting  gloves, goggles, towels, hats, shower shoes, etc, just the right size."
5.0,"I thought these were going to be too small when I saw them but the stretch nicely and even slim my &#34;muffin top.&#34; As far as I know they aren't see through. Very cute, I'm 5&#34;2' and the length is perfect"
5.0,Great sports bra. Easy to get on
5.0,"It was perfect, she loved it"
5.0,Now I look just like this guy
5.0,Very comfortable sunglasses- love them!!!
5.0,These gloves a smaller than advertised; however I have small hands and they fit perfectly.  Good quality
5.0,They are tight... but the stretch makes it bearable
5.0,"These are crazy -- but they are PERFECT for what you'd expect from new bell-bottom trousers in the style of 45-50 years ago! I ordered my correct size and they FIT perfectly. The material is also slightly stretchy, so even if they were 1 waist size smaller, they'd still fit comfy."
5.0,Excellent gloves.  Thank You
5.0,These earrings are gorgeous. The green color is luscious. Each earring is a little over 1/4 of an inch. My wife loves them.
5.0,"Everytime my daughter goes out in this dress, people compliment her! It's adorable"
5.0,Perfect in every detail want in different colors.
5.0,Adorable & Pretty
5.0,Made everything come<br />Together for prom was so beautiful and fit perfectly it did snag on my<br />Hair a little bit but other than that it was a great product. Best used it you have a middle part as advertised
5.0,I am so pleased with these socks! I spend 10-12 hours a day walking on a hard tile floor and at the end of the day my legs and feet are killing me. I have worn compressions socks for years but never have I felt relief like I do after wearing these socks!! Thanks for your product!!!
5.0,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she absolutely loved it.  It's prettier than the picture.  Very pleased that I bought it.  Fast shipping too.
5.0,"I received this DVD last Tuesday and have done the workout every day since! An incredible workout without having to learn a lot of choreography. Easy to follow as she adds on punches/kicks a little at a time to each combination. It's low impact and not hard on the knees.<br />Iliana is very pleasant and an absolute pleasure/inspiration to watch. Her form is impeccable. She encourages proper form first, then height and speed later.<br />Great addition to any home exercise DVD collection!"
5.0,Excellent product for the money. Well worth it.
5.0,"Very soft and nice looking, does Frey but it’s not to much.."
5.0,"Omg where do I start!!! First off being that I'm 5'8 and 164lbs, sometimes it's hard ro find the perfect dress that's not too tight or too loose. This dress drapes my curves so perfectly.  I recieved so many compliments and I am pleased. The material is lovely as well as the feeling of the material.  You deserve the best ladies get the dress 👗 😘"
5.0,Only issue I had was with the zipper. Everything else was perfect and worth the money
5.0,I wear this to work every day and it's incredibly comfortable and keeps me warm in the slightly cool office AC.
5.0,"Love these so much. I have been looking for larger sunglasses that don't look awkward on my face and these work. The only thing with plastic frames is that they bring on static. So if you live in a place where it gets cold and dry for winter or if the air is dry at all, be careful when rubbing your shirt on the lenses to clean them. Major static!"
5.0,super cute and comfortable!
5.0,"This dress was perfect for my last fraternity formal. My only warning is that it might be short if you're taller than 5'5&#34;. I wore it with flats sandals and it was the perfect length, heels might be an issue."
5.0,Gave these to my best friend she loves them and so do I!
5.0,Love this outffit ! fits perfectly and quality made.

5.0,"Very nice,  .Grand daughter loved it"
5.0,This chain in a jewelry store would be three times this price.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, colors are true to the picture."
5.0,"Tie has good weight to it, feels very premium for the price. The colors are vibrant, the gold has a sleek shine to it. This shop for ties will be definitely on my radar going forward for when I shop. Thanks!"
5.0,Just as effective as a cloth mask 👍👍
5.0,I'm so in love with this piece. I dont have my ears pierced and sometimes fine it hard to fine beautiful and elegant clip style earrings but this has really exceeded my expectation. I cant wait to wear it!
5.0,"I usually wear a large in bottoms, but a medium would have been better. Size down. (Cute though)"
5.0,It was perfect I have a friend who enjoys wearing odd hats to work. He loved it.
5.0,Just buy it. You will not regret it.
5.0,I have had these before and the work great
5.0,I love the way it fits my body! Perfect!
5.0,Bought as a gift for my son. He loves them.
5.0,Watch band installed easily and is very comfortable to wear. Much more breathable than original band.
5.0,simple and elegant. I bought these for a rehearsal dinner dress. They seem a little fragile and hope they hold up

5.0,Gorgeous addition to my collection
5.0,Muy buena calidad...

5.0,"This runs 2 sizes small, ordered extra large it was a medium.glad I ordered big, nice designs, longer shipping times."
5.0,I would compare this product with Eileen fisher products or other high-end linen goods. Very good quality for the price
5.0,Love the fit and comfort!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:7d6766644720f50d446375ff34385ef1]] Nice bag. I have also included a video review which I hope clarifies some of the written portion and/or augments it to allow you to get an idea of the ins and outs of the bag. As I mentioned in the video, Prottoni has to garment bags on Amazon, both of which are very well made and well thought out designs and I believe made with different consumer needs in mind.<br /><br />Features:<br />-4 Large Pockets<br />  &#60;&#62;These pockets are deep and extend the length of the bag. Each is zippered shut and each is wide open meaning it does not contain additional<br />  organization features you may have seen in similar type luggage such as extra pockets for organization .Functionally this makes sense as<br />  anything in this type of pocket would fall out when the bag is hung in the open position and you would thus lose the organizational benefit.<br />-Shoulder strap with comfort guard<br />  &#60;&#62;Whats nice about this is that it clips on opposite sides of the bag which allow the user to comfortably carry it because it more equally<br />  distributes the weight throughout the bag.<br />-180 Degree zipper closure<br />  &#60;&#62;This is nice and a feature not included in the 45 inch model. It keeps you belongings more secure and does a fine job at preventing the<br />  elements (be it rain, snow, sleet) from gaining access to the bag contents.<br />-Dual sided hand carry straps<br />  &#60;&#62;These are made of nylon and are very strong and comfortable on your hand. The 45 inch model has a more elegant handle in my opinion.<br />-Main hook<br />  &#60;&#62;The main hook that the entire bag hangs from in the open position is nicer on this bag (IMHO). The other model has a nylon strap that serves<br />  this purpose.<br />-Full internal zipper closure<br />-Strap on inside that keeps items in place<br /><br />I don't believe there were any drawbacks to this bag. I have used both this model and the other on trips and think they were both made well with different users in mind. So please also check out my review on the 45 inch Proton bag to compare and contrast the two and make an informed buying decision.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased review."
5.0,Great product. Thank you!!!
5.0,Love everything about these jeans...and quick delivery in perfect condition!
5.0,"This product fits most fitness bands.  The MyId program is easy to use and easy to update when my meds change.  My wrist is small, and sometimes the product pinches between the clasp of my fitness band and where the product sits.  I'd buy it again."
5.0,Great fit and very comfortable
5.0,So far so good Mom loves it!
5.0,Love these for the superior quality at a cheap price. Didn’t like the fact that they took 6 weeks to come in.
5.0,"Totally in love with this dress! I wish they had other colors. Material is nice, not cheap and flimsy. Very well made. Please make in other colors!"
5.0,Material is on the thin side but the print is too unique (and of good quality) to pass up! I'm expecting to only wear these sparingly so I'm sure they'll hold up for a little while. Taking them to Tulum with me! Should still be comfortable to wear in the Mexican summer.
5.0,It is fine.
5.0,He loved them and wears them often.
5.0,Just what she needed
5.0,beautiful. loved it
5.0,"I bought these for an impromptu snowboarding trip at the end of the season in warmer weather.<br />I was glad they fit well in the waist and had space to fit tightly over my snowboard boots.<br />I am usually a 32x30 or a M in most pants.  I bought an S, and it worked out great.  I wore moisture wicking tights underneath."
5.0,Daughter loved it as a Christmas gift
5.0,"Love the simple and elegant hollowed-out style and light weight. However, it looks much bigger than expected for my taste as a daily wear, although the dimension described on product page is correct.  I wish this has a smaller version in same style."
5.0,"If you ever feel invisible and wanted to be seen or you are about to attend a party and you really want to be noticed by someone special, then this fascinator should be your go-to head covering. In an era and culture of over exposure, pairing this hat with a well-fitted red or black turtle neck will turn heads and gather many compliments. I recently wore this head piece to a jazz themed party over the holidays with a bright red dress and I was in the eye of the event photographer the entire evening. This is truly a unique and impressive adornment and I look forward to wearing this into 2020 and beyond.<br /><br />As far as this staying on, there are two clips attached to a pear-shaped cap that clip easily on top of the head and work with an up-do or down hair. I like to wear this with loose waved and my hair down but I could also see a messy teased low ponytail look fantastic or even a highly polished curled up-do. I had a lot of fun wearing this and I look forward to taking one step forward and two steps back with fashion in the roaring 2020's. Thanks for the snazzy hat ;)"
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! So, so comfortable, breezy and flattering. Well made, soft, great color. Highly recommend."
5.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry!
5.0,These are great for my small 6 year olds & average 10 year old. Soft and comfortable and they like them a lot.
5.0,I love how breathable they are.
5.0,"These are very comfortable and easy to wear,even while doing my beadwork.<br />So I will likely buy a couple more pairs - just wish they came in more colors."
5.0,"This dress is beautiful!! Unlike some of the other similar and slightly less expensive dresses you can find on Amazon like this one, the skirt is not see through and the design on the top is made from embroidery, not just a print of it. It was a little bit snug on the belted part of the waist, but it still zipped fine and fit overall really well. It is so nice and doesn't feel or fit cheaply at all. I will definitely be wearing this out this summer."
5.0,"I absolutely love it. Very nice quality, came in fast, and looks exactly as it's advertised."
5.0,"These are the perfect size, not so big as most others. I'll give everyone a tip about keeping these in place-do not try to use the shoulder strap Velcro on these (or any other shoulder pads), they will never stay in place - buy Velcro dots or strips and put them on the top of these and on the top you're wearing. I have even used masking tape rings on the top of these pads, super easy and they never move!"
5.0,I Love this set. It looks exactly like the photo
5.0,"Attractive, well made, very functional, reasonably priced. I think that means that it deserves the full five stars!"
5.0,Just received the package and tried it on so the 5 star is based on the product right out of the package.<br />As I was taking it out of the packaging I was a bit skeptical. I was expecting this to be possibly stiff and baggy in the wrong areas and possibly just unshapely. However this fits pretty well. There's one zipper on the side<br />This is really cute!
5.0,This dress is cute and comfortable. Material is soft and wears easily. I’m wearing a size large and typically wear a size 8 to 10 in dress. I can’t wait to layer it in the Fall.
5.0,Perfect size for my needs. Keeps my arms and hands free for other things.
5.0,so cute and they look great when the sun hits them
5.0,A really good company to work with! I was really surprised that the dress was well made and just as cute in person. Thank you.
5.0,Exceptable
5.0,Great hat. Material is good amount of thickness
5.0,"I'm a big girl, 5'2'' @ 270lbs, and the Large fit me perfectly, not tight at all, but not as loose as it appears on the model. The material seems good, too. Everything's as pictured."
5.0,The chain was of a good thickness as was the pendant. Will see if it changes up in color in the next week or so
5.0,I really LOVE this necklace.  It is gorgeous!  It fits well and is very elegant! Got so many compliments!!! Can't wait to wear it again...
5.0,I love the blouse only one thing it was to small had to give it away. I got it in a xlarge my normal size is large.
5.0,"This t-shirt rocks! Long, not too low v-neck, thick quality, sewn well, inexpensive!!! Yay!!!! I'm buying one in ever color! Note this is junior's sizing for these shirts. I'm a small, 5'5, 135# adult female, and ordered a large. New fave!"
5.0,"Love this bag for its average size, material that is easy to clean, the pockets on outside and easy straps that are flexible and comfortable on shoulder even over a heavy coat."
5.0,I received this belt as a birthday gift and I am absolutely amazed at the quality of it for the money. The plates are all painted nicely and the strap is well made. The belly is much heavier than I expected. I definitely recommend!
5.0,Shirt is great. Soft and comfortable. Returning for a smaller size but expected i may need to do so because of my daughters size.
5.0,"Better than expected, love it!!!"
5.0,My brother loved it.
5.0,Bought these to wear for a Graduation - they fit beautifully!!!  Hides any flaws.  Will be buying more pairs!!
5.0,"My son loved this shirt, it's lightweight very Comfortable. 5 stars will be purchasing more from this seller"
5.0,Just got the eyelet headbands! They are adorable and fit my 7 month old perfectly. ..the colors and material used is perfect! Love them!!
5.0,"The only thing I wish was added to these briefs, is an H style fly, for easy access. It's amazing being able to walk around with the security of underwear, but having the freedom as if I were not wearing any."
5.0,"These look really cool and the fit and seal are great.  I like the UV protection, and the handy case that they come it which will definitely extend their life.  I usually don't keep the clamshells that my goggles come in because they get squished and are hard to re-close, so the nice case was a bonus.  Great purchase!"
5.0,He said he wanted no clothes but I bought this anyway for my 8 year old grand son. He said he loved it! His mother said he would definetly wear it ! The colors are very bright and he really loved the figures on it. Age appropriate.
5.0,"The leather is of nubuck type which marks easily and isn't fixed by rubbing it with your fingers. It arrived with what appears to be a black pen mark in the upper right corner of the pocketed side.  It has a soft feel on the surface and is very sturdy because of the thickness of the leather. It comes with a wrist strap and a shoulder strap that are made with good quality hardware. I was impressed by the way it was carefully wrapped in a soft dust bag, which is good for storing it when not in use, and then wrapped in a plastic bag prior to being boxed up for shipping. I believe it's a good value for the money but not sure if I'll keep it because of the markings on the exterior. I think I'd prefer the other darker style one that doesn't appear to be nubuck leather because it's more visually appealing and would be easier to care for/ maintain the look of it."
5.0,Beautiful! Met all expectations.
5.0,"This is the perfect dress! Super soft fabric, perfect length (I’m 5’4”)  and just gorgeous!"
5.0,I'm 5'4 and weigh 130 lbs with a size C34 bust. I got an XL based off of reading the reviews and the sizing and it fit perfect. Arrived fast and looks so cute on! Great material and style for the price.
5.0,Statement earrings. Dresses up an outfit. Chic and comfortable.
5.0,"Mom is in nursing home , she loves the dress"
5.0,Nice brilliant colors. Very well made and comfortable.
5.0,One of my favorite necklaces.  I get so many compliments on this necklace!!
5.0,"Needed a break-away key chain for my vehicle key, and this works perfectly!  Very small, unobtrusive, clip is sturdy and it has held up over several months just fine.  Would absolutely recommend!"
5.0,My son loves these trunks.  I bought them as an alternate pair in case his other shorts are still wet.  I bought next years sized so he could wear them next year also but they just fit him now.  Not work the money for not being able to use them next year.
5.0,"My first time I got this watch was my 7th birthday. I’m almost 40 now and I am on my 3rd one same model.. great price,, not too bulky,, long lasting,,if it gets damaged just buy another. The rubber strap wears out after many years of use which is understandable"
5.0,"BEAUTIFUL, GREAT QUALITY!!"
5.0,"Love them,  perfect fit,  thinking about buying again."
5.0,"I love this T-shirt Dress! It is true to size, I am 5&#34;10, 150 pds and ordered a Large. I usually order Medium but I wanted it to be long enough so my booty wasn't showing. The material is very soft and comfortable. Definitely not cheap feeling or looking. Goes perfect with knee high boots!"
5.0,Looked good but poor fit. Returned.
5.0,"These arrived the next day after I purchased them. Each with their own little cloth sack. Cute and nice quality, very happy with them. I keep one pair at home and one pair at work for the computer screen."
5.0,Just as beautiful as picture and gift recipient liked it.
5.0,Súper elegante
5.0,"This gloves are a gift for my girlfriend, She said this leather glove exactly fit as her expectation. She like these black color and the special design. They look very cool and definitely work well with her phone while she driving her car, they keep her hands warm and comfort because the lining is made by a good material. they are real leather but just with a little bit fur smell. Not only competitive pricing, but also good quality and shipping service, she strongly  recommend everyone to choose this glove."
5.0,The men in the family loves them.
5.0,Love these! They’re super cute as a gift for a nomad traveler like me!
5.0,"Just gorgeous! Top has no lining, but I wore a nude bra and it was perfect. I'm 5'4, 155lbs I ordered a 10, fits prefect!!!"
5.0,It's  really  beautiful I love it.
5.0,"Tory Burch belt is well made, fits perfectly and looks great."
5.0,Excellent fit and quality. I ordered a large I'm a slender 175# 5'6&#34; it was slightly big but I would have worn it anyway but fits my daughter perfectly so I'm gonna go ahead and try a medium for myself.
5.0,Every day use.Every Day!  XMAS gift’s
5.0,"Colors and image print are great, we have washed and worn multiple times and it’s still holding up just fine! A+, your little one will<br />Love it!!"
5.0,"Very green zeosite/ruby (ZR) bracelet that can stand up to sports and showers, and still look good on a dinner date.<br /><br />I read that ZR is supposed to help heal ME/CFS, and after years of fighting extreme fatigue, I will try anything!<br />A Reiki healer told me that stone bracelets have substantial direct contact with the skin, and would this transfer more energy. I do feel a very subtle difference with it on vs off, but personally have no idea if it has healing powers. It doesnt hurt to try!<br />Plus it goes great with my new forest green outfit."
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for in a warm wool sock. Great value for the price, and well made. Will probably order these again."
5.0,Feels good and reduced swelling.
5.0,Good quality and breathable.
5.0,The fit is great. Would by again
5.0,Good short I need that they have more colors
5.0,"Adorable, soft, flattering & sexy!"
5.0,look good and fit is amazing
5.0,"I purchased these for a 2 week trip to Disney World. They were extremely easy to use, lightweight, and held up great! We were able to slide these off and on when we needed to and it took no time at all. They fit very comfortably on a watch band- no rubbing, blisters, or anything else that could make them uncomfortable.  I 100% recommend this product!"
5.0,Excellent quality! My daughter loved it!
5.0,"I wore them for St Patrick's day bar crawl, my friends loved it!!"
5.0,I love this eyeglass chain!  I use these everyday on my readers.  The chain looks great and is nice and smooth.  Works very well!!
5.0,"Doesn't look cheap or expensive, just a fashionable accessory.  Only issue besides possibly coming from a sweat shop is that the setting is slightly uneven and I believe the reviews claiming the emerald fell out."
5.0,"Thank you, I really like it, but the first time I wore it broke.  I was so disappointed, but I am going to try to fix it."
5.0,The Wonderlust socks are working fine for me. They are well made and I think they will last for quite sometime.I have paid much more for other compression socks that did not last more than a few months.
5.0,Bought for a nursing dress at 3 weeks postpartum- highly recommend! Perfect for nursing and the fit is so flatting for postpartum.
5.0,Was given as a gift and she loved it!
5.0,"delivered before delivery date, which was great. its slightly big in the waist but it fits the bust perfectly."
5.0,"It's very cute design dress. However, the color of this dress is not expected.I thought that it's blue but deep grey anyway...this company's service is excellent,so I put 5 stars in this time!!"
5.0,"So pretty and sparkly. Smaller than I realized, but that's ok, they're still so cute!"
5.0,I love this dress.  I normally wear a 12/14 in U.S. sizes and I was torn between ordering an XL and XXL (my natural waist is 35&quot; and chest is 34).  I went with the XL and it fits perfect.  I'm 5'4&quot; and the hem comes just below my knee.  I think the shape is flattering and the black satin belt helps define the smallest part of the waist.  I think this dress would look really good with a black petticoat but is also cute without for a more simple look.  I will likely buy more Miusol dresses now that I know what size I wear and have seen the quality of this brand.
5.0,I LOVE this jacket... it's feels like an elegant twist - alternative for a peacoat in a way too me. SO well made and unique. Easy and versatile. Originally purchased it in the XL but was swimming in the XL so I ended up exchanging it for a MED and very happy I did... this jacket runs large... I am 5'3&#34; and aprox 150lbs .... The MED is still roomy on me. I was worried that by going down to the MED the sleeves would be too short - tight  but the MED is perfect and STILL has the 'oversize' styling to that I like about the coat and I can still fit a layer under it. Being short the length is perfect for me as well. The coat is perfectly 'me' sized.And I love the charcoal flexed grey. It a perfect alternative to black and much more flattering than black on me- I always end up looking like an old Italian widow  out a movie from the 70's when I wear black so I am always on the look out for neutral alternatives.  It's a perfect fall jacket or a perfect 'winter' coat  for places like southern CA that don't get blizzard cold. It's super easy to wear and be dressed up or down. Been looking for a piece like this for a long time and so happy I took the chance and ordered it. The company-amazon made the size exchange super hassle free easy and fast too.
5.0,"Fits perfect, love the two size choices so my son can grow into it."
5.0,They were very nice. Great fit. Love that latch and don't easily come off.
5.0,Nice and bright!!!
5.0,El color es muy lindo...
5.0,"I love this dress! I love the pattern and the sewing. The length is perfect, and it was easy to wash (several times now.) There have been no loose strings. I got several dresses on Prime day, and each one was perfect! I measured myself and was sad to see I was about a large. Except in the bust area-then I'm not even close...too small. I had read that many large-busted ladies fit into these dresses comfortably, so I purchased this assuming I'd have to take it up in that area. I didn't! The way the cut of the dress works, I can switch to a bra that adds a few cup sizes, and it looks just as good as if I were to wear a thin one. I absolutely feel comfortable in these dresses. It's fun to hear friends and family members express their surprise that I'm in a dress..and more surprise that I'm comfortable in it! I am typically not a dress-wearer. If you wear leggings with this dress, a slip is required. It *will* ride up without a slip. Just a warning: I'm posting this exact review on nearly every dress I purchased that day because I have literally the exact same feedback for each one. I love them! Also-I intend on purchasing more. I love them that much!"
5.0,Love it went great wit my dress
5.0,I love this cute little bralette so far! Nice support and adjustable straps.
5.0,"Great costume Large fit my son who is 5'6&#34; 176lbs. Only had ro roll up the sleeves a bit. Besides that perfect. Good fabric, fantastic for the price"
5.0,"Completely in love with these gorgeous earrings, unfortunately I haven’t been able to wear them, because the clip on one of them is not working, my earring keeps falling off my ear"
5.0,Comfortable warm and soft.<br />Perfect for any boot or hiking wear.<br />Flex in the socks allow them to go with a lot of colors
5.0,Liked the fit! Used for working out!
5.0,Adorable and worth the money
5.0,"Tengo 20 años usando zapatos Nine West, me quedaron bien!"
5.0,"I’ve now had this bag for over a year as my everyday bag that I bring everywhere with me. And I have to say that it is holding up really well. It’s still super solid and it’s been through several cycles in the washing machine and is still holding up strong. I love love love this bag, not to mention that i think it’s super stylish and I get lots of compliments on it"
5.0,Unique and kinda sexy.
5.0,My husband LOVES this ring. It’s heavy and looks beautiful! We will definitely buy from Sophie’s Treasures again. Hopefully we can find more of NE’s rings!
5.0,Best brand hands down for sexy comfort
5.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh 130 pounds. This dress is great. The skirt is full and looks so cute when you tie a bow around your waist. The top is cotton and stretchy, and keeps you pretty warm. I've gotten so many compliments on this dress, and it's great."
5.0,"I was quite pleased, this purse is quite attractive, holds my Kindle easily, and I have a lot of room for my stuff. The price was good. It is small, which is what I was looking for as I have back issues."
5.0,Love the fabric and it’s very comfortable for wearing around the house!
5.0,I love these!
5.0,"Great boots. The first guy says they are not waterproof...  I disagree 100%, they are indeed waterproof! Took about 6 - 10 hours of wearing to really break them in because from the factory they are extremely stiff.  BUT.... once they are worn in a little, they are great!  I have been all the way to the top sank down in mud and water in these boots and they did not leak one drop.  Loading and unloading boats on the boat ramp submerging boots in pure water and not one drop of water leaked in!  I wouldnt stand in it for 5 hours to even test it, but for crossing creeks, walking through a bunch of water, mud, anything they do their job.  Very comfortable boots once broken in. As far as being snake proof... if a snake bit me, I sure didnt know it... So I guess they did their job, haha!"
5.0,"looks grate,"
5.0,My granddaughter liked everything about these. Thank you.
5.0,Fit was according to size chart. Good quality fabric.
5.0,"The gloves are durable, fit good and are made well.  A little more support in the finger tips would be good for heavy work but for dexterity the gloves work well"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!  Don’t hesitate to purchase this scarf.  The fabric is a perfect weight - thin and warm.  Very soft and luxurious.
5.0,Even cuter on!
5.0,Loved this dress! So fancy yet sexy because of the back. Perfect length too!
5.0,A+A+A+A+A+
5.0,"Perfection people! Everything is with patches, not that crap that they just slap on there, looks better than the picture shows. If you're a fan of the movies, you'll love this, they have #99 Banks and #96 Charlie's as well, I think I saw #33 Goldberg's as well."
5.0,My daughters loved this gift I bought 2 and they are very well made and have held up perfectly so far..this is a must for any softball player
5.0,"I bought this for an outdoor spring wedding.  I was surprised by how much I like this dress.  It fit well.  And the hi/low hem made it stand out.  I am 5'1"" and 115lbs and purchased a small."
5.0,"Súper rica la tela, y queda de maravilla"
5.0,Cute outfit and made well. My 9 month old niece is a little chunky but not unusually large. This size fit well with just a little room to grow.
5.0,The outfit is a cute design and fits nice.
5.0,I have reordered this item multiple times from this business. Great product. Very soft on the ear. Fast delivery.
5.0,"I ordered these workout pants for my DIL.  She pretty much lives in these pants around the house.  She also wants her leggings to be firm and opaque enough to run quick neighborhood errands.  She really liked this pair.  The fit is tight but true to size.  They are comfy and soft to the touch.  She said that they are fairly easy to put on.  So far, they've held up well.  Not sure I can ask for more!!"
5.0,"The fit is great, very stylish, great over all slouchy hat, bought it for a gift, he loves it, pretty warm"
5.0,"Cute hat! Great quality. Great stitching. Purchase for my daughter, it’s exactly what she wanted!"
5.0,This jacket is so soft and so warm. It’s thin but kept me so warm my trip to the NE. You need this jacket
5.0,"The keychain is easily found in a purse, which has always been a problem. It's very nicely made I was surprised the quality was so good for the price. I think this is a great value!"
5.0,"I bought this for my mother in law who just had surgery and needed some button up tops. This arrived promptly and is very pretty. The fabric is a good quality and Isn’t see-through. I had to put it in the dryer on low for a bit to get out all the wrinkles from shipping but it looked very nice afterwards. She has dementia and is very picky about what she wears. This worked out very well. It was a good fit too, some things are not true to size, but this was. I got it large so it would fit loosely. I think I’ll get one for myself too."
5.0,The arm holes were way too big and irregular. I had to get this altered
5.0,Buy them every year
5.0,Feels wonderful and soft
5.0,these eyeglass pouch cases are wonderful - very well made - cushiony and protects the glasses well & the top closure keeps the glasses in place and they don't slip out!! i liked them so much i ordered another pair:):the cleaning cloths are an added bonus) And i like the funky designs:) i totally  recommend the Sund pouch cases
5.0,"I wanted this mostly to see if I’d utilize enough to invest - it looks so good! Idk about in comparison hand in hand, but down to details, inner band stamping & all! Great quality in general tbh."
5.0,Really nice item and detailed very well making it look real but the helmet is a bit big.
5.0,"Nice quality, husband gets compliments all the time"
5.0,I used it for under my Ariel costume so I wouldn't accidentally show too much skin at a kid event and also to stay a little warmer. It was perfect! Very comfortable and matched my skin tone well enough that I felt covered without taking away from my costume
5.0,Seems to be of good quality & as advertised
5.0,The fit was excellent especially since I have are large head..the lenses are very well made
5.0,"It is what it shows, arrived quickly"

5.0,"I’m obsessed with this hocus pocus Halloween shirt!!! It’s the perfect size and fits great. The material is really nice and very soft. The lettering on it is very well done. It doesn’t seem like it would peel off or be very hot like some other similar shirts. It held up really well in the wash, although I didn’t dry it. I hung up to dry just in case. Overall, it’s a great shirt and the design is perfect."
5.0,Made in Korea 👍
5.0,Works wonderfully!
5.0,Love ASL cap!!
5.0,As Advertised
5.0,"This is such a cute dress. The fabric is good quality and I love that it has pockets! I will be purchasing this in other colors and incorporating it into my wardrobe. The dress comes to mid thigh on me and I am 5'3, so maybe a but short on taller ladies."
5.0,I have some heavyish pendants and these are great for that. My husband's wears one just alone and it looks great
5.0,I love the bracelet.  My granddaughter got it for a Mother's Day gift for me.  The fact that it is adjustable is a big plus

5.0,Alot of people  love my mask
5.0,I bought this for a 2 year old and I am sure she will love it.<br />Seems too juvenile for an adult but still is very pretty.
5.0,"These are good quality, adorable earrings whose colors go with everything.  They are small and simple, but the pretty-colored shells keep them from being plain.  The design is cute; I like to think the shape resembles my cattle dog!"

5.0,"I got so many complements on the teal flowered dress. It fits true to size. Its polyester fabric. Love the pockets that are 3 denominational. I also have big arms and the sleeves are perfect, because they are cut open. Love my dress. The only thing they could have done better was the zipper. It's kind of the luggage zippers. But its not hard on your skin or hard to zip. a plastic or hidden version would have been the cherry on top."
5.0,Nice ring at an affordable price when you can't afford the real thing.
5.0,Very soft. Fit was right on.
5.0,"I love this beautiful scarf. Soft, unique and lovely. I have received many compliments when wearing this as an accent to a sweater, inside of a blazer or as a wrap on chilly evenings.  It’s by far one of my favorite go to scarves."

5.0,"This is a truly dazzling piece of jewelry! The photos cannot emphasize enough all of the 'bling' it has. It's truly gorgeous. It doesn't &#34;choke&#34;...unless that's what you desire.

If u can’t decide  weather to get this bag or not just do it because u will not be disappointed
5.0,Bought these for my grandson to play basketball in. He really looked like a star in these.
5.0,I like it for the most part. It's kinda bulky when its on. Also have to adjust it a bit to position earphones to right spot. Ive only used it once so far but can't wait to use it more with colder weather around corner. Plus I always wear ponytail so lobe the style.
5.0,Very nice to just put on a bedroom table for display and works great. No problem sleeping at night.

5.0,I go to a lot of concerts. Haven't used this yet.
5.0,Got it earlier and fits perfectly!!!!

5.0,thanks guys love them
5.0,Nice fabric fits as expected
5.0,"My husband decided to remove a wasps nest that was bigger than a basketball under our porch.  There was no way I was letting him do this without protection, so I ordered this hat.  Also bought a one piece paint suit from a home improvement store.  He was now ready to go.  Wasps are gone....and no stings."
5.0,"Very nice dress made of a stretchy material. There are some threads coming out at the seam but it is not noticeable. I ordered size small and it was too big on top. I'm 5'5 and 110 pounds, 34A bra size. I would recommend this dress if you wear at least a B cup."
5.0,"Fits true to size! I’m 115lbs, 5’4 and got a small"
5.0,I have purchased many of these set. very dainty and so beautiful !!!! these are very wonderful.  Photos do not due them justice.
5.0,"Nice pair of jeans, they fit rather nicely."
5.0,"I ordered 3 of these caftans in various designs. I wanted something pretty and comfy to wear at home and sleep in. You could even wear them to go to the grocery store or whatever. These fit the bill. When I saw that they were 72 inches around I thought they would be roomy. However, if you wear a size larger than a 3X in the hips these only have a couple-three inches of give. If you sew that would be an easy fix since there is plenty of fabric taken up by the side seams to let them out another 3 or 4 inches. I love the fabric and the designs and the price and I'm very happy with them."
5.0,"They fit amazing. They are thin, but warm the best gloves I’ve ever bought."
5.0,Beautiful soft winter white leather gloves!  They’re exactly what I wanted and couldn’t find in any of the local department stores.

5.0,"Soft leather, perfect fit. Love them!"
5.0,These are super cute seen them priced for much more elsewhere!
5.0,I absolutely love my earrings! Small and quality isn’t outstanding but they will get the job done! I wish they were bigger!
5.0,"I’m usually between a medium/ large depending on length and shoulder size. I went with the large to be safe, and it seemed extremely loose around the top and a bit longer than expected at first. I wash and dried it and now it fits perfectly. Might be a good idea to size up if you plan to put it in the dryer"
5.0,Very good value!
5.0,"I have had this ring for nearly two years now and it’s still just as beautiful as the day I got it. I get compliments on it often, one was just a week ago. Such a simplistic, but elegant and beautiful ring! I’m still just as in love with it as I was when I got it!"
5.0,"This titanium key ring carabiner is awesome! It keeps my keys completely organized, the greatest part about it it's extremely light weight."
5.0,Love this drsss. Fits perfectly.
5.0,Love this bag.  Perfect.  Exactly how it looks.

5.0,"Just the Perfect watch strap band and deployment buckle for my Seiko Age of Discovery, great leather texture thank you!"
5.0,"beautiful! gave it to my future daughter, boy, did i make points thanks!"
5.0,This was perfect for hiking in a crowd and trying to keep my face covered during COVID 19.  It seemed like everyone was looking at my hat/mask set up and wanted it because they were in their uncomfortable masks.  They were so jelous and wanted to know where I got it :)
5.0,These were given as a gift and truly cherished by the receiver. They fit just right.
5.0,"I purchased this bag specifically for a sailboat trip I was making in the Caribbean.  This bag served well on this trip and was used again recently on a fishing trip to Alaska.  I never dropped the bag in the ocean, so I can't swear it is completely waterproof, but it served my needs very well and remains a go to bag for trips into the wild or when sailing."
5.0,"Didn't want to spend $300 for something similar. Searched and found this. This necklace is sturdy, not heavy and has a really nice easy and to use good sized clasp for  fastening. It's a beautiful addition to help pull together a look of sophistication."
5.0,muy lindo todo.
5.0,This is a well made quality bag that I purchased for my Mom. She loves it. The bling is enough but not too excessive. Just the right bag to give someone for a gift.
5.0,"I have been running in Vibram FiveFingers Sprint footwear for over one year now, and my opinion of these strange and amazing glove-socks continues to grow. First, my regular running course is just over five hilly miles of Seattle sidewalk and trail, five days per week. That's a lot of mileage. And they are holding up incredibly well, not needing replacement yet - but the KSO Trek does have my attention.<br /><br />When I bought them I had been out of running for almost two years with achilles pain. My MD had recommended surgery. My wife instead recommended her acupuncturist, over time I got good results with that (and some other modalities) and after doing a lot of walking, was ready to get back to running.<br /><br />I heard about the barefoot running movement, picked up Christopher McDougall's book [[ASIN:0307266303 Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen]], did my research and learned more about improving all kinds of medical issues in the feet/ankles, low back, etc. through better running posture - and decided to give the Vibram product a shot. I also ordered the [[ASIN:B002WN2L6Y injinji Performance Mini Crew Toesocks]] - they make getting into the Vibram's a bit more of a process, but I look on it as an opportunity to massage the feet and toes in preparation for the run. They work very well together as a system - helping keep debris out of the footbed. I have actually never had to stop and remove a twig or pebble when wearing them together. It can happen when wearing the FiveFingers Sprint on their own. I understand that Vibram's new KSO Trek model is a big improvement on this issue.<br /><br />Following the instructions from Vibram, I started out walking in them. Then bit by bit added more running into the outings. Soon I was ""really"" running for the first time, and found out that what people were talking about was true. Here's the big point about this footwear: it will get you into a better (and far more efficient) posture while running than you have ever experienced - ""high and flying"" like Kip Keino. Its a liberating feeling. I quickly realized that the heel strike from a normal running shoe requires more energy output. I'm now running faster, and feeling cooler, because of the efficiencies netted from the Vibram's ability to let me run like I'm barefoot.<br /><br />Here's one other observation: it turns out that the foot is an amazing thing. I find that when stepping on a pebble, or into a hole (or some other inperfection), my foot knows how to adapt to that, even while running. We've got inertial dampening capabilities in our feet and legs which standard running shoes prevent and the FiveFingers completely allow. Early in my use of these glove-socks I was very concerned that stepping on something was going to be, well, a BIG problem. Gradually I have learned that this is not a major issue - more like a non-issue for me. No blisters, no bruises - just normal conditioning soreness (particularly in the bottom of the feet and back of the calf). I have several pairs of standard name-brand running shoes - in order to protect the foot the tendency has been to raise the heels in these shoes with more and more cushioning - to the point where traditional running shoes can actually feel ""tippy"" in the heel when running on trails and uneven terrain. If anything, then, it is standard running shoes which are the hazardous footwear - not the Vibram FiveFingers! So yes, I have gone from highly skeptical, to highly enthusiastic. Give them a try. Just keep your iPod on while running, people are going to want to stop you with ""what's that?"" questions. Just smile, and run!"
5.0,I love these socks! Vibrant colors as pictured and love the polka dot pattern. They are a little pricier but the quality is second to none-- no pilling or shrinkage after several washes. Would highly recommend!
5.0,It works for any ocassion. Ive got lots of compliments on it already!! Awesome watch!
5.0,i just bought this because my 5 year granddaughter loved her doll.  perfect fit fit both of them
5.0,This is a very nice outfit. It is made with great quality and is very comfortable. The colors are just simply beautiful. It fits true to size!! It is quite perfect. It has a fluffy glittery skirt attached to it. It does not sink when dried. I received this item in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,Loved everything about product
5.0,I'm a huge fan of Robeez.  I bought my son's first pair completely based on fashion - never thought they would be at all functional.  He is starting to bear weight on his own and with our hardwood floors I was initially afraid he would slip and slide around the house in socks.  Robeez have a super strong sole that prevents slips - I'm not as worried about his first steps.  Plus they keep his socks on him.  I was at my wits end with the number of socks that never made it home from daycare.  For some reason when he goes to daycare with his shoes on he always comes back with both socks!<br /><br />It seems like there are so many cute things for baby girls - Robeez are one of the only great accessories I have found for my son.
5.0,Very bright and colorful. A little on the large size but he is a growing boy.  Didn't shrink much in the dryer and he wants to wear them all the time.
5.0,This dress is so soft & elegant. I am wearing it for my 15th wedding anniversary.<br />I am 5'2 & weight 115 lbs & the dress fits great. You can still wear a braw bc the back is wide enough to do it.
5.0,Love this adidas sweatshirt
5.0,Great nose ring .
5.0,Great mask! Love the fabric!
5.0,Went hiking up in the mountains with these gloves and it kept my hands dry and warm for the two days I spent up there in below freezing temperature. Definitely recommend!
5.0,A must buy if you want lounge wear or pajamas and want to be comfortable.
5.0,Like it so much I think I'll order another one in a different color!
5.0,Fits the way I expected.
5.0,"Es una de las mejores compras de los última días. Precio excelente. Lo utilizo cuando salgo a ""jogging"" por su correa de plástico."
5.0,"UPDATE:  6/20/19<br /><br />I've had these sunglasses for about 3 weeks.  Like I said in my original review the lenses on these sunglasses really make colors pop and have really good clarity but the glare blocking is just above average but well below what my Suncloud Mayor's performed.  Being OCD that I am, I continued to research these sunglasses even after 3 weeks and I compared the model number 20193008654SP that's on the label to that on smithoptical.com website.  It turns out that 20193008654SP is the model number for Dark Amber Tort and not Matte Dark Amber Tort (which I received).  The label on my box says Matte Dark Amber Tort but with a product number for the regular Dark Amber Tort.  When I received the sunglasses from Amazon I was surprised that they were the Matte variety because I could have sworn I ordered the non matte.  When I view my Amazon order and then click on the product, it takes me to the product's page on the Dark Amber Tort model which reflects the proper model # 20193008654SP in the product description.<br /><br />So how did this happen?  Why did I receive sunglasses that clearly have Matte Dark Amber Tort printed on one of the legs and on the box label but have the wrong product number printed on the box label?  I'll contact Smith directly.  I may have to return these (fakes?) and purchase directly from Smithoptical.com.<br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW***<br /><br />This pair of sunglasses arrived on time in excellent shipping packaging.  My concern was that these might be knockoffs and maybe they are.  They don't have ""Chromapop"" etched in the corner of the right side lens (looking out) which is usually present on Smith sunglasses with Chromapop lenses.  Nevertheless, these lenses must be Chromapop because the clarity is amazing.  Even with the amber tint everything is crystal clear and colors really do pop, especially the color green.  So trees, grass, bushes appear vibrant.<br /><br />I purchased these Smith Bauhaus sunglasses to replace a pair of Suncloud Mayors that I recently lost.  The Suncloud Mayors were polarized and blocked glare amazingly well.  I could leave my house on a sunny day and my eyes would be totally relaxed the whole time which meant I never had to squint my eyes or look away from something for any reason.  The lenses on the Bauhaus are also polarized but the glare cutting ability isn't as strong as the Suncloud Mayors so in that respect I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />In terms of size, the Bauhaus are smaller on my face because the lenses are narrower (54mm vs. 57mm) than the Suncloud Mayors.  This is good because I do have a narrow and long face.  The hinges feel premium and the injection molded frames feel about a half grade above the Sunclouds.  The Bauhaus is part of the Smith Archive collection and is packaged in a Smith Archive Collection box.  The Bauhaus are stored in a thick fleece satchel.  Included is a Smith decal along with a Smith warranty booklet.<br /><br />The Bauhaus is a stylish pair of sunglasses that provide excellent sun protection for your eyes.  Even in tortoise shell, the frames still look sporting and can be worn on a hiking trail or a more dressier affair. I highly recommend them."
5.0,These are amazing!  That side pocket is perfect for my running.  I bought one pair loved them so bough 5 more... all colors.  Great work out pant!!!
5.0,Me encanto muy buen material !! Excelente producto
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The fabric quality was great and it holds up well in the wash; didn't wrinkle like some of the Nike shirts do. My son loves this for playing basketball and it's a great length. The fabric is light enough that he can wear it under a hoodie and not get too hot. I'll probably purchase more of these for him to wear to school and the gym.
5.0,"These fit so well , and are very soft and feel wonderful . Thanks Leslie"
5.0,"These are the best. Period.<br />They don’t cut into the back of my knee, they stretch where they are supposed to & they have really comfortable strong compression. I struggled with prescription compression & paid a fortune for fancy ones - these are better than all of them.<br />I have bought them for so many years now that I order a new color every time so I can rotate out the old ones and remember which ones are newer 🤣."
5.0,"Great price! Got this for my daughters formal dance. Got a lot of compliments, very comfortable."
5.0,"Wraps around my waist comfortably but of course I'm waiting for it to fail on me because let's face it, I can't take care of anything and it's not going to last forever so might as well keep it in my cart"
5.0,These fit nicely.<br />Not sure of durability yet.<br />Thank you
5.0,This tunic is made of a nice medium weight fabric. It drapes nicely but is not too thin.  The button details are cute and its very comfortable to wear. you can throw it over a pair of leggings and look smart while you feel comfortable.
5.0,"For the style I was going for, I’d get a size up but I’ve washed it a few times and it still fits pretty nicely."
5.0,"Size large fit perfectly, material feels great"
5.0,I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. I bought the expensive steel one and it just didn't feel right so I ordered this one. I also received the two bumpers... I prefer the bumper I'm currently using because it covers from the top so the screen is protected. But this band is awesome. I don't feel like my wrist sweats as it did with the original band Bc of the Air holes I love how it feels on my wrist. I do however wish I would've did a little bit more research because I found that for $12 more I could receive two more watches and one more bumper from the same company. The band doesn't look funky with my rose gold bumper either. I highly recommend this product
5.0,They look really great in person and bigger than I thought. I love them and the sparkle is nice. I get lots of compliments on them. I would highly recommend them.
5.0,I work in an office so this case works well for me but I would not recommended for someone who works outside or some where too dusty
5.0,"This was a gift, so my rating is a reflection of her saying that she loved it. Fit was nice and I agreed with her."
5.0,"Great quality and a beautiful dress, my 4yo used it to be Wednesday Addams on Halloween. It is thick and like a sweater material so perfect for Fall, she is also 4t/5t and 2/3T was perfect for her."
5.0,I loved this medic alert sleeve. Even my doctor was excited about this sleeve and the app was so easy to input my info and or to update. I highly recommend this item.
5.0,I loved how the dress fit on me! I ordered a size medium butI’m super short and it still looked amazing! I also loved the shade of blue I ordered.
5.0,"The sweatshirt is exactly what I had been looking for. Though it seems a bit large, I'd rather that than too tight."
5.0,"I gave these lights to all my nieces and nephews, and they provide hours of cheap entertainment. My kids wrap them around their toes and walk around in the dark. They attach them to sticks to use as light sabers. A great way to supplement their imagination!"
5.0,They feel durable yet adjustable and the pack came with two of each.
5.0,I love this belt! Better then I expected. Fast and easy to use. Gonna get a few more in different colors.
5.0,"I knew I would love this dress when I saw it. I wore this dress as my reception dress after my wedding ceremony and I received so many compliments. I ordered the white in a size 5X. I am 5’7 and weigh 177-178 lbs, I’m curvy thanks to my hips. The dress fit me perfectly except under the arm was a little bit too big, so I had a seamstress take it in maybe about an inch and a a half on both sides so my boobs wouldn’t show and it fit 100% perfectly after that. I am definitely going to wear this again. And will definitely order again in different colors. Do recommend this for purchase."
5.0,Good product. Exactly what I was looking for
5.0,Love this ring. My husband is able to wear it while installing windshields.
5.0,"Great Christmas presents, was really well received and liked."
5.0,"I loved this top! So far out of any top I ordered on amazon, it’s my favorite. I just ordered the other color. The material is much better quality and thicker. It is very forgiving in the stomach area. I love it! I would say it is pretty true to size."
5.0,Very nice and exactly as pictured!
5.0,I love this bra! Great support for a large C still breastfeeding momma! also looks cute under everything and is like insanely comfy!
5.0,Read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes bigger. Fit perfectly.
5.0,"So tiny and sparkly! Bling jewelry sent a nice little velvet pouch to keep it in, or would be a nice for putting small things in while traveling.  It is stamped 925 on the back.  It looks like real diamonds, the champagne color is right on."
5.0,Exactly what I needed for the price.  Fit is accurate
5.0,Wonderful purchase and great fit
5.0,Super cute and stay on-even with room to grow! I will definitely be buying more of the sweet little Mocs!
5.0,Great guitar strap. I like the ones made of cotton and really soft leather. It will help protect your guitar. This company has great customer service and quick delivery and the best prices.
5.0,Awesome watch rotator. I can place 2 watch in at a time and it works well. It comes with a power adapter and I believe it's made of wood. It's easy to clean and also easy to use. I recommend this to everyone.
5.0,"My daughter still uses this watch. The multiple colors are fun, but the instructions are a bit hard to follow. The language looks like it was retranslated multiple times, so there is a little guess work involved."
5.0,Great fit and material.
5.0,"I've used eyeglass chains before, but after a while I have given up on them because my glasses would keep falling out. It's not a big deal, but it did get annoying to have to slide the end back onto the frames. The little piece that goes on to the glasses of these looks identical to the ones I've used before, but for some reason I am having much better luck with these.Plus, there is a set of extra end pieces if needed.  After several consecutive days of using it, my glasses have not fallen off once. The chain is a nice stainless steel. I have a plain chain necklace that is very similar to this. The silver color coordinates with my attire easily. I am very impressed with the quality and durability. I usually just wear my glasses on the top of my head when I am not wearing them, but I know that stretches the frames out. Using a chain like this one is better for my glasses.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own."
5.0,I ordered the dress for a rehearsal dinner and it’s exactly what I wanted.  Thank you
5.0,Very happy. Glad I bought it
5.0,"Cute, good price. I actually took them off their Keychain and put them on necklaces. Wife and I love them. ❤️"
5.0,I really love this pearl gift set.  I bought this for a gift and I know she will love it.  Great price and quick shipping.
5.0,"I bought my first one awhile back and somebody loved it so much I gave it to them, so I had to order another one for myself!"
5.0,perfect for a paw patrol obsessed toddler. Held up well also
5.0,Good quality. Rubbery
5.0,Was absolutely happy with my purchase. The dress was of quality material. It fit like a glove!
5.0,The dragon belt looks fantastic. The buckle mechanism is very cool. I've never seen any thing else like it. The design allows you to easily disassemble and cut inches off the buckle end of the belt so it fits perfect.
5.0,straps across the top of the feet are stretching.
5.0,I love it. Great quality. I will buy another color
5.0,"It’s nice. Dont listen to the reviews, they fit correctly. I bought a size up for my husband and they are huge ."
5.0,"Has a little weight to it with all the gems, love the sparkle. Not for smaller faces though, fits a bit loose on me."
5.0,Perfecttt
5.0,Looks just like picture i love it :)
5.0,Isotoner gloves are my all time favorite. My mother got me hooked!!!
5.0,Very good looking for the renaissance festival
5.0,"This wand is the most beautiful one I've ever  owned, And I will own it till the day I die, Should I have my way. It's so beautiful, And slender, And perfect. I don't know if it was just meant for cosplay or anything, But I'm actually going to use it. I love it.<br />It's very sturdy."
5.0,"I love this dress! I'm usually a medium size and it fit perfectly, 2 day shipping was amazing and can't beat the price!!"
5.0,"So I ordered these glasses a week ago and they got delivered to my door in an unbelievably short amount of time.. I couldn't believe my glasses were already here. That's totally aside the point. When I finally put them on, I was in LOVE. Not only did I love the style, but I loved the fact that they fit so well on my face! They are comfortable and they really block out the sun. I can literally wear these with anything and feel cute. Sweat pants? Throw on the glasses. Sun dress? Throw on the glasses. Feeling sassy? THROW ON THE GLASSES! I love them!! Would definitely order again!"
5.0,"Good undershirts, nice collar. Quality material"
5.0,Really nice and comfortable tennis shoes. They look great and I can deal with them all day long without feeling exhaustion or become uncomfortable. Definitely will buy again if available.
5.0,This is a truly beautiful piece of jewllery. The picture does not do this necklace justice. Its much more beautiful in person. The Carnelian stones are just beautiful. The necklace is truly breath taking. You will not regret if you purchase. I have worn my necklace several times and I have received many compliments. Arrived on time. Seller was great. Packaging was great. I highly recommend. I wish they had more of this style in different colours and stone options. I would purchase all of them.
5.0,Just what I wanted. Well constructed
5.0,As pictured. Pretty token for any Angel of Mercy.
5.0,Love’em - They are comfortable and do a great job at protecting my eyes and keeping them relaxed versus squinting
5.0,I like the size. It was perfect nice and roomy and not too big. Material was great too
5.0,I liked the fact they were very simply done and will compliment most outfits.
5.0,"Our 2 year old granddaughter LOVES these shoes and always asks for her Crocs! Great for playground wear, appear to be very comfortable for her, clean up easily when dirty! Would definitely purchase again!"
5.0,"I love this bra! I was looking for a simple, every day bra that's comfortable and sexy. Even though it's plain, this bra makes me feel attractive and it is so soft and comfortable. It fits me perfectly- not too tight or loose. For sizing, I am very petite. I'm 5'0"" and 95 lbs. I range between a 32C and 32D. I got this in a 32C and it's the right size for me! Hope my review helps you figure out if this is the bra for you and what size to get."
5.0,Fits a little on the big side
5.0,"These are great. Fit tight, fun colors. Good value."
5.0,"These shorts are PERFECT if you need longer shorts for work, but don't want denim or the black ""khaki"" fabric. They almost feel like the type of fabric that khaki pants are though- very thick, but softer. Since they are thicker as opposed to yoga-type shorts or leggings, there is absolutely NO CHANCE that your underwear will show through, even if you wear the brightest colored ones and do squats. I wouldn't necessarily recommend them for working out, but for work they are perfect. Maybe find something thinner and more stretchy for a gym trip. The waist band is very thick and high quality, but a bit too high for my taste- so I fold it down a little. I'm 5'4, 115 pounds and I bought a size small. Since the waist band is thick, it would be great for tummy control if you need it, but maybe still go up a size larger than usual if your stomach is bulgy, otherwise the shorts may be too tight in that area and uncomfortable. As for washing, I've washed and worn them about 3 or 4 times now, and they've held up great besides getting a little shorter on the legs. They used to be right at the top of my knee, now they're about 3 inches above it. I do usually go against the rules and stick em in the dryer for like 5-10 minutes to partially dry before laying them out to finish drying though, that's probably why."
5.0,It expands quickly and is easy to use. This makes my 5 year old daughter hope to have one. Great design.
5.0,"A mi niña de de 2 años y 1/2 le encanto, el 2T le queda perfecto y tiene un moño en la parte trasera que hace lucir perfecto, me encanto por que la tela es súper suavecita y mi niña se ve súper coqueta."
5.0,Fast delivery and so light weight
5.0,Bigger IRL but definitely not a bad thing. Fast easy transaction and the piece is beautiful. Easily worth the price including shipping.
5.0,Size accurate very cute
5.0,"I work on cement floors and am on my feet all day. Various orthodics and lots of special shoes never seemed to help much, but these socks have added energy to my feet, ankles and legs.  I highly recommend."
5.0,"This is my third purchase of these bamboo socks. This time, they are for my son. He tried on a pair of his dad’s and loves them so much that he kept stealing his dad’s socks. My son is 8 years old and has large feet. He doesn’t like to wear other socks now, only these ones. I highly recommend these! They are so soft and very stretchy but they retain their shape are excellent at moisture wicking."
5.0,Great bag for those who forget their normal bags in the car and decide to get a few things. The bag actually holds quite a bit. I use it for the times I didn’t plan on shopping but do anyway.
5.0,Make sure to have the correct ‘switch’ setting in the back of the remote.
5.0,Beautiful fit and style.  I love these shoes!
5.0,Great quality. BEST top for fall and layering for winter!

5.0,Soft smooth and feels so good
5.0,Perfect bag. I use it every day. Good size.
5.0,Wow!! I love my beautiful watch ..
5.0,"This shirt is adorable! I love the little frog and the material is very nice also. Well made shirt that looks like it will last. No tags to scratch at your neck either! The green is a lighter green from what was advertised, but I like the lighter color better."
5.0,This skirt is adorable!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:8608a1d26af6546d4cd7c6ec21e673b]] I was looking for affordable jewelry and I stumbled upon these earrings. And I wasn't really expecting good quality because of the price. But I got a big surprise! They are the most perfect earrings ever. I love them so much. They feel good and look so good too. I love the size. They are not too big or too small. Just beautiful.
5.0,"I order the 32 waist and it fits perfect.  Am in between 30-32, depending on the day. So if your an exact 32 waist order a bigger size.  Lots of pockets. Very confortable on moving around."
5.0,"I bought the capris and the longer version in the gray space dye fabric. I love them both! I am 5'3&#34;, approximately 125 pounds, and the small fits perfectly, not too tight or clingy, not too baggy anywhere. The fabric is a perfect weight, not too revealing. The key pocket in the waistband is ideal for holding a Fitbit, key, tissue, or money. I had a hard time finding fitness capris/pants that included a key pocket; there is no zipper on it, but the location on the waistband should hold most small items in place. What a fantastic deal these were as well, around $20 for great quality capris/pants. I've used these for walking, Zumba, yoga, and biking and they work well for all of those activities. I recently washed them in my machine, but then hung them to dry, as I think it helps them last longer. They still look and fit well. I would definitely recommend these!"
5.0,It was perfect. I enjoy wearing it often. Very comfortable.
5.0,Love this blouse coming for the blue one
5.0,The dress is well made and love the material. I got many compliments when I wore this dress. I would highly recommend this dress.

5.0,"Love it, great quality"
5.0,Great for crafts

5.0,Good material just a plain hat
5.0,Perfect gift for my mum.
5.0,"These bibs are nice except the main zipper pull fell off , worn them once 15 min In my opinion it should be made of a plastic or urethane product not cast aluminum"

5.0,"LOVE these shoes. I need arch support and these have it. Durable, comfy, washable and the best part, made in the U.S.A.!"
5.0,I love these type of workout jackets so I figured I’d give this one a try since I liked the pink/mauve color. The fit is slightly on the smaller side and is stretchy but doesn’t stretch out. The quality is thick and durable and keeps you warm. The zipper is smooth too. I like this jacket for the price and quality
5.0,"Made in Germany.  The size XXL fits my size 7 3/4 head perfectly with absolutely no bothersome constriction or slack.  The wool stays cool when it's hot and warm when it's cold.  The pattern and design goes well with a wide variety of clothing.  The Stetson pin is small and in the back and unobtrusive.  I highly recommend this flat cap to anyone who wants high quality and good looks.  I feel like a Peaky Blinders when I wear this, so I got a cool 1920s style haircut to go with it.  Superior!"
5.0,"amazing, the fit is a little big, but oh my are they comfortable"
5.0,I was very pleased with this product. Good quality material for the price.

5.0,"I really enjoy using the vest during my recumbent bike workouts. I had not been sweating as much during my workouts and once I purchased the vest a few weeks ago, I have definitely seen a big difference."
5.0,These arrived fast and are exactly as described and I’m in love! So comfortable I’m not ripping it off the second I leave the store and I even forgot I was wearing it at one point.
5.0,"looks nice, sturdy too. Would recommend."
5.0,I love this watch band! I got it as a gift for Christmas and it is perfect!!! I completely recommend it!
5.0,Flattering for post partum tummies!!! It IS very snug-I returned my first one for a bigger size and even that one is snug. It looks great on and fits well.
5.0,I am 5 ft 3 and weigh between 135 and 169. I love the way these fit and I want to order more but unavailable unfortunately. I love the flare and how they cover up my feet. The waist band however I had to cut and make longer because it was tighter than the pants themselves causing a digged in red bnd mark on my lower abdomen area. I do like these a lot aside from the roughness that comes with the wear and tearing causing it to feel bumpy and lumpy and not smooth as when you first get them in the mail. I wouldn't put a lint cutting electric tool on these because I did that with the other pair I got from another seller and it ate the pants up. So embrace the wearing out after a several months. I do love these a lot because these haven't had any sewing problems no loose threads like the other sellers and better put together too. I love how these keep form to your body through out daily wearing. Others don't do what these ones do. I wanted more of these but unfortunately not available anymore.
5.0,I GREW TO LOVE IT THANK YOU

5.0,"It’s a very soft, very comfortable, lightweight tee for summertime in the mountains."
5.0,"I am 5’6” and 147lbs, bought a Medium. This is so flattering and you really can’t beat the price! It is stretchy-ish so it isn’t stiff, and even when you sit down it’s still comfortable. I strongly recommend this dress; it’s awesome!"
5.0,Bought one for my future father-in-law and my fiance ended up stealing it since the size fit him better. Had to order a second one for my father-in-law. They both love it and wear it often! The seller is extremely helpful too since I had to contact them and they resolved my issue quickly.
5.0,They fit and look great
5.0,Love this would like to purchase more can you send me information on purchasing more tank tops.
5.0,"Dress took a bit over a month to receive dress.  It was beautifully made and good quality, however i had decided to use a different dress and tried to return it.  Due to it being shipped from China, it would have cost more to ship back than i paid for the dress.  I'll sell it here"
5.0,I am going to end up having to give this to someone smaller than me even tho i ordered a 4X. It fits really small on me. With that being said its a really nice shirt and the material is top quality. Its a super pretty color and I really wish it fit!! I would advise if ordering to get 2 sizes bigger than what you are. If it lost weight it would fit me! The lace detail is really nice as well. I received this item for a discount for my unbiased honest review.
5.0,Very convenient and helpful. Nice size.
5.0,love it. Always gets compliments.
5.0,great buy!

5.0,"These are good quality socks with a long length and a good amount of cushion. However, these are not for the late spring ski season. They are too warm for that. I would recommend them at the coldest parts of winter or even while hunting in the late hunting season. They are very warm!"
5.0,I got for my baby girl and it’s really soft and cute love it 😊
5.0,Beautiful and good price
5.0,"ITS A VERY NICE SHIRT, FOR THE SUMMER HEAT  OR FALL WEATHER i WOULD WEAR A SHIRT UNDER IT.  ITS VERY NICELY MADE.  FITS NICELY ND FLOWS WELL.<br />THANK YOU."
5.0,These reading glasses are perfect size. My face is small and they fit just right. The hinges are such that they would fit larger faces too I believe. The material is a rubbery plastic. Do not come with a storage bag/box. Will buy again in other colors when available.
5.0,I hope it fits
5.0,"Our son keeps saying how comfortable these shorts are, we go on a couple of rides a week, totally 12 miles a week, he wears them every time and no longer complains about seat discomfort!!"

5.0,"I have used this product to stretch 4 different pairs of cowboy boots now and it works great.  I have used it both with boot stretchers and also by spraying it in the boot and putting them on and wearing them until they dry.  Works good either way.  I couldn't originally find anywhere that said if you could use it on reptile as I wanted to use it to stretch a pair of lizard boots and emailed the company and got a reply from Jonathan that it would be safe, just try a small spot first and spray it on the inside of the boot of course.  Very happy with my results with this product."
5.0,I LOOKED ABSOLUTELY SMASHING WHEN I WORE IT
5.0,I have not used these yet but they look very good and the quality looks good.

5.0,Matched the previous and fit perfectly.
5.0,my sister in law sent me a pair for Christmas - they really keep my feet warm over a pair of slipper socks - they have non-skip on the bottom and have worn well<br /><br />I was wearing the ones she sent every day most of the day - I needed to get another pair to be able to periodically wash the first pair.<br /><br />The pair she sent is red - these are dark blue.  I wish there were more choices on amazon - only one color.
5.0,"Excellent,great quality,beautiful looks,I recommend!!!"
5.0,My 17 year old loves these. Best purchase. Comfortable sandals.
5.0,"I wish I could get a better photo on my iphone because my pictures just don't do this necklace any justice! It's little and dainty, which is just how I like my jewelry! The chain is a little too dainty for me but it is exactly the quality chain you get wherever you're purchasing a necklace like this. The chain is 18&#34; long, sterling silver with a Rhodium Finish. The beautiful pendant itself measures just under an inch high and is also .925 sterling silver. There are 3 small white diamonds at the top with 5 blue diamonds (which are my new favorite stones). Blue diamonds are real, natural diamonds and are heat-treated blue. This necklace would make a great gift and it doesn't break the bank!<br /><br />*Product received at a promotional price in exchange for honest review*"
5.0,"I love the gi itself. The material is fantastic and I love the color!! The top fits me perfectly but the bottoms are a bit small. If you’re curvy like me, SIZE UP!! I was happily surprised at how well the gi was made since the price was so great!!"

5.0,"I was asked to do a review of this item and give my honest feedback, I thank this company for the opportunity to do so!  I have been a online shopportunity for many years since I became disabled and I do not ever buy anything without reading reviews, I did this review with my son in mind. He is 30 years old, it arrived pretty quickly.  When I pulled it out it look just like the pictures so I did not think it was necessary for pictures.  The fabric was great not to heavy and not to light, very soft and had a lot of stretch to it so I tried it on and and I loved how it fit and how it felt if my son would not have walked in he most likely wouldn't got it, lol. But I gave it to him and he put it on and basically the same thing I did( it did looked a lot better on him than me) it fit him very comfortably but had that look of tight fit. It still could have been a girl shirt just as much as a guys shirt but the look of muscles show very well. I would have gave it more stars than 5 if I could. Well worth every penny!!"
5.0,I loved all the industrial earring I got and will be wearing all of them . Very easy to put in and very well made . Not too long just right . And very beautiful .
5.0,Perfect for a maid costume. Except the wrist things were kinda huge lol
5.0,"This silicone ring was everything my husband I needed! It is great for workouts, traveling, going to the beach, etc."
5.0,"A few months ago, I had lost the necklace that I wore every day so I bought this as a temporary replacement. Little did I know how quickly it would become my new favorite necklace. When it arrived, it was packaged beautifully, like a gift. I really like how it looks very expensive, meanwhile, it was such a great value for the price. I have received numerous compliments from coworkers, family members and even random people who I encounter. I also really like how the stones have stayed intact unlike other necklaces that have a shorter life span. This necklace has lasted more than one month with constant use and has withstood over 30 showers, multiple swimming pools, steam rooms and hot yoga.  The chain is delicate yet sturdy and not too thin.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and it is very versatile. I can wear it with my casual clothes to work as well as with my dress clothes to weddings and special events. I really have no complaints about this necklace, and would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty and durable necklace, suitable for everyday use! As you can see from the picture, this necklace is no longer my temporary necklace, it is my new favorite necklace and I doubt I will ever take it off!"
5.0,Great tunic. So comfortable.  Wore it on the plane and for sightseeing on a trip.  Easy to wash (warm/cold) and line dry.  I loved it so much I got another one in black.

5.0,For every day use.<br />Great fit!
5.0,"Don’t understand the negative reviews, I love this bracelet. I bought two. The price was right and it matches the gold in my wedding ring perfectly. The fact that it looks like costume jewelry is a plus. It fits with any style. Can be mismatched with silver and rose gold. I plan to add to my collection!"
5.0,Very cute! I’m 194 and a size large fit great!

5.0,Gorgeous ❤️ my daughter loves it. Will order more.
5.0,"These pjs are absolutely adorable and comfy. I ordered my size M altho the tag read XL they fit perfectly (sizing was determined by supplier, so don’t be surprised at the tag) I wash them b4 wearing on delicate cycle and they wash up fine. I wish they had more colors and designs to choose from, I would definitely purchase these again and again."

5.0,"This was exactly what I wanted.  It is just the right size for use when traveling.  Although it says not to wash, I put it in a small laundry bag and dried it on the clothesline and it washes great."
5.0,I sent this jacket to my granddaughter. She really loves it! It keeps her warm and dry.
5.0,I read the reviews before ordering this. It does run small so I ordered up. It fits perfect! They are right about the fabric- it is much thicker than anticipated. I'm short so I was worried about the mid length being awkward on me. I'm only 5'3 and it hit a little below the knee but looks perfect. I received he cream colored one and the pattern/colors are pretty. I LOVE this dress and will be ordering more!!
5.0,Love this dress. I am a pant size 12 and the large fit perfectly.  The material is great and the cut is unique.
5.0,"Nice and feminine, excellent to wear with jeans or capris on hot summer days"
5.0,"These fit true to size and stay on my 17 mo feet securely. Native won’t stay on her feet but because these have a strap, they stay on well. My toddler is super rough on her shoes and these have held up so well."
5.0,Love it! Love it!  Love it!!!!!
5.0,"I love this so much.  Lots of women commented on it as well.  What is funny is that I was just looking for my super glue as one side of the rope came loose from clasp.  Did not happen as I was wearing it, just when I took it off.  I would love if the metal came in an other color as well.  This is really a statement piece.  I would not deter purchasing just because it came loose."
5.0,FRESH FLY THE BOMB
5.0,"This bathing suit is perfect for summer. Super sexy and fits like a glove. Product came and looks exactly like the picture. Be mindful of the size chart when ordering, it is true to size. I thought the chart maybe exaggerating but it wasn't. I just new I wouldn't need the size the chart said I needed but I did, so after trying it on, I cut the tag out because I didn't want to see it. I should also say I did purchase this suit at a discounted rate for my honest review, and honestly I feel like the bomb with this swim suit on. I can't wait to find it in other colors"
5.0,"Kudos to ""Nationsguard"" and Rick Hendrick for supporting Kyle !!"
5.0,Good quality and met expectations.
5.0,I like that I have 2 bags in one.
5.0,Very nice and fashionable
5.0,"I used these compression socks on a recent flight to South Africa.  It was a 15 hour flight on the way there and almost 17 hours on the way back.  These socks were a gem and kept my legs and feet from swelling too much.  I also have large calves and was excited that these fit over my calves without being overly restrictive or painful.  You could tell the socks were really stretched at the calves, but no one saw that part of my leg so I didn't mind.  I love that the toes are a different fabric so they aren't squishing your toes at all.  I will be using these every time I travel and will definitely recommend them to family and friends!"
5.0,What can I say about this item. They do the job very well.
5.0,Some of my favorite glasses to wear as a gag!

5.0,Has alot of charms daughter loves it.
5.0,"These are fabulous.  The waist is high and as a 5'11"" 130 pound person they fit beautifully.  I will be ordering every color!  The only drawback is they are thick and may be too warm for a cross fit workout."
5.0,"For the price this dress is stunning. I took off the bow and the cheap gems and added my own lace and cameos. It fit true to size and I added a petticoat. Got stopped about 100x to take pictures. If you're on the fence, get it!"
5.0,These look amazing! Great fit
5.0,My daughter's loved it! In the pictures we took was perfect. I hope will last few cicles in the washing machine.
5.0,Nice thick material.  Great olive green color.  This jacket is adjustable and looks good zipped or unzipped.  It will carry me fully through fall.  So excited to wear it.
5.0,"Perfect, quality dress for such a low price I was pleasantly surprised"
5.0,"Love this bracelet. I am always worried about a bracelet not fitting my small wrists but since this is a wrap cuff, it works for me and doesn't fall off like other bracelets."
5.0,That's a cool shirt I should have bought two
5.0,The bag is well made with durable fabric. Really roomy.  There is a smell to it. It smells like some kind of petroleum. Hoping a hand wash will take care of it.
5.0,"These are super soft, comfy, and I love them so much that I want to buy more!"
5.0,"This coat is gorgeous. The color (mulberry) is amazing and it is the perfect length. It is so trendy looking and is really high quality. It is very warm as well. The hood has the coolest fur print lining that I have ever seen. It is an all around great jacket that has looks, durability, high fashion and warmth. Highly recommend it!"

5.0,"These glasses are amazing. They fit perfectly on any size head from what I have seen, they’re flexible so if you lean on them or pack them in a bag they will flex and not break, truly worth every penny."
5.0,I have now purchased 3 of these.  My wife loved the last one and after seeing this one she will be equally thrilled.  It came boxed very well and in excellent condition.  It's even larger than I thought it would be.
5.0,My daughter love the gift it’s beautiful elegant.<br />I’m very happy with my purchase 👏
5.0,"Very comfortable spf golf shirt!  Lightweight, soft fabric.  Fit is true to size.  I like that it wasn’t too clingy!  I’m 5’0” 130 lbs<br />and ordered medium."
5.0,is really cute! I love it! material and labor and size is really good! I really recommend this item.
5.0,"This is the perfectly designed bra.  It’s particular helpful that it’s all adjustable, by Velcro. I don’t know about you, but my bras always stretch out over the course of the day with no way to tighten them up.<br /><br />1) Chest band adjusts<br />2) Straps adjust<br />3) Zips up in front<br />4) The middle of the zip front has a hook and loop halfway up so it holds the bra closed while you zip up—no catching skin in the zipper<br />5) The cups are cut narrowly enough that they don’t dig into the side-boob-under-arm area. If you’re short, you know what I’m talking about<br /><br />There are only two, interrelated issues:<br /><br />1) The material is super stretchy. I bought a size too small, and it had stretched out to fit comfortably by the end of the second day. I do this with all bras (use those hook and eye extenders) b/c, if I buy the correct size, it’s too stretched out to use after a month<br />2) The metal loop pieces for the straps and chest band rotate sideways, so the material bunches up on each end rather than lying flat through the metal loop.  The metal does not dig in, however, so it doesn’t hurt when this happens<br /><br />I’ve been using this as a hang-around the house bra; works extremely well.  I’ve worn it out of the house to run to a store without a problem.  I’m pretty big on top, so win for me.  I don’t run, but I wouldn’t think this has enough support for running.  No bra does for me, though, so take that for what it’s worth.<br /><br />Overall, I’m very pleased with the smart design.  I’ve come back to order more."
5.0,Fit just right. Thank you.
5.0,"These are my favorite undies of all time. I'm tall (5'9"") and long waisted with a belly, and these are so comfortable. They stay up without rolling down and cover my rear without looking like granny-panties. Cute colors and patterns too. Love them."
5.0,I was expecting  red but it's  maroon I wear a size 7.5 but I got a 8.5 n they fit perfect  They are very narrow so 1 size up
5.0,Love this dress!!! Very figure flattering.
5.0,I’m the matron of honor in an upcoming wedding and I Got these for goody bags for the bachelorette party. They came in great shape and are super flattering on everyone! Perfect gift and fun sunglasses.
5.0,The Headband looked great with my costume!
5.0,There’s Pjs are so comfy and I am happy with my purchase
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:31bb81f913b73878cad58ae35bed761b]] I received this outfit and was like “omigosh, I love this!” And then I looked at the tag and realized there was no way that my size 12 figure was going to fit into a medium anything, but that doesn’t mean I can’t share how amazing the style and design of this outfit is.<br /><br />So this is a pretty risqué outfit in that there’s actually not a whole lot to it, but what is there is fantastic.  The outfit has lace that comes up the sides and this lace is ridiculously soft and pretty.  I can guarantee you this is not itchy or scratchy lace; this is lace that feels deliciously soft and smooth against your skin.  So it ties in the back like a halter and the back is pretty much backless.<br /><br /> What I think is exceptionally cool and sexy about this outfit is the decorative strips that come from the crotch up.  I showed this to my husband and he was just as sad as me that a medium just isn’t going to fit me.  If you were blessed with a figure that allows you to fit a medium then I absolutely recommend this outfit.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
5.0,It is a well designed polarized sunglasses. Perfect for the summer. I glad to purchase this. Definitely recommend this one to whoever is looking for a good polarized sunglasses. Good deal.
5.0,"This is a gift, but I received what I ordered, hopefully my nephew can fit it"
5.0,"These are an absolute steal....they are exactly what they appear to be...simple yet classy and unbelievably comfortable.  And although this material is thin, a tunic works nicely with these pants to cover any problematic spots.  The material is a wonderful knit with just a hint of sheen.  These pants are very versatile and could easily be a wardrobe staple through Spring, Summer and Fall."
5.0,“Feels like walking on clouds” is what my daughter said!
5.0,Love this one!
5.0,They looked great on and I was able to wear them with all of my outfits for EDC this year. They were long so I was able to wear them above the knee which I liked also. Thank you!
5.0,"Fit is perfect, these are comfortable and easy for me to put on and take off (I have arthritis). I am a 36C and ordered a size Medium from this brand. If you need the compression that this is made for, then order your exact size.  I normally/mostly wear a medium. In reading the reviews before I ordered, I knew to size up one. I did not want the compression, just the style and fabric. I wear them for walking, yoga, and Pilates. Would order again, if they have/get more colors."
5.0,"I go to the gym 4 days a week and did not want to spend $20 per top so I bought this pack. I am 5'5"" and the small comes right to the top of my high waisted leggings. Also was not cut too low to be uncomfortable lifting weights but isnt awkwardly high either. small is the perfect size for me. Its not super tight (i weigh 128lbs) but I have not washed them yet. Very basic gym top that gets the job done without spending all of your money."
5.0,Esta orticulo me encantó  la tela es  de buena  calidad  queda muy cómodo estoy muy satisfecha con este producto.
5.0,"A bit too large, my fault !  Otherwise a very nice top !! Trying to shrink it a bit..., lol"

5.0,I liked it’s
5.0,My mother in law loves her Mother's Day present.
5.0,These perform well.
5.0,She looked absolutely adorable! Everyone commented on how cute she looked and how adorable the outfit is. The outfit fit true to size; She LOVED the skirt too! I put a petticoat under the skirt to give it some lift.
5.0,"I am in love with these! I am going to be buying more of them, for myself and family members! Everywhere I go everyone asks where I got them!"
5.0,This product in particular was a little to big for me I ordered my normal size medium and was to big .But the material was super soft I wanted to love it
5.0,"Partner with a tunic dress scarf and a pair of boots... these socks are super cute.  They are cottony and not lycra tight.  This means you should wear them and wash them.  They go right back into shape.<br />If I take my boots off, and wear them just as socks they slouch.  But not unattractive.<br />Soft and neutral.  I wear these once a week."
5.0,"This wrap is just what I was looking for.  It is perfect for warmer weather, comfortable and the Velcro closing is very secure.  The light blue is a lovely, happy color.  After showering, I dry off with a towel and then put this on while I do my hair and makeup, etc., so I can’t really speak to the absorbency of the waffle weave, but it’s fine for my purposes. I expect it will continue to soften over time. Very happy I gave this a try."
5.0,I love these keys there so cute
5.0,Great quality!  My son loves it!
5.0,Perfect gift for someone special.
5.0,My boyfriend love this I will be shopping for more for him
5.0,"My sister, niece, and I have all started taking horseback riding lessons.  When my sister and I played racquetball, I bought us some sterling silver racquet earrings.  I bought these for us as well as an extra pair for my niece.  I was very pleased with these, so I ordered another set for our instructor, who loved them.  They are small, which is what I wanted."
5.0,"Super cute for the price! I ordered a medium and it fit great, exactly what I wanted. I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh about 150. The material is fairly thin and lightweight but has a tshirt feel. It's great for summer."
5.0,"Glasses are great, so far so good!"
5.0,"👍 ordered a Large, fits loose"
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, very well made, and arrived quickly.  These actually look more expensive than they are."

5.0,"Love this little retro dress, short and light weight fabric, perfect for spring and summmer!!"
5.0,they're very cute and good quality. i love all of them!!
5.0,"I just got this in the mail, washed it, tried it on, and it's amazingly soft!  Comes down to my knees (which I think is perfect to wear with leggings) and is light enough that I can wear it during the hot summer months and still cover my roly-poly arms.  During the winter I will be able to pair with a cardigan (cause I'm in the south and that's all we need!).  I wish I would have bought more for the $5.99 price.  Now that they are normal price, I have to wait to get more!<br /><br />The sizing is a bit big.  I ordered a 3X and it fits exactly how I wanted.  Nice and loose.  I easily could have gone down at least 2 sizes and still been comfortable.  But again, I like things really loose."
5.0,She like them
5.0,Love the color! Lots of pockets
5.0,"Material is little bit thin, but is going to be great when it is warmer temperature. Looks great, fits as expected"
5.0,I really like this idea and very warm
5.0,"I bought a different ring from the same company, and there was a huge difference in the quality. This looks and feels much nicer than other ring, and fits better. It's a very attractive ring. However, since I have not worn it much, I cannot comment on it's durability."
5.0,I ordered one size larger than what I wear and it fits perfectly! The material is quality and not thin. The colors are striking and the stretch fits like a second skin.
5.0,Great flip flops
5.0,"I absolutely love it, it’s so pretty and comfy"
5.0,Flattering. Great fit. Can be really dressed up with the right heels & jewelry. This will be a go to dress in my closet.

5.0,"Cute, comfy, and just what I expected. I love them!"
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter to wear for her 6th birthday party and she absolutely loved these! Comfortable, made well, lots of shine and adorable!! She got so many compliments on these pants which made her special day that much more amazing 🥰"
5.0,Love this way to display a favorite coin.
5.0,Suoer cute
5.0,Love item
5.0,"What you see is what you get. If you want a soft sparkly leopard scarf, then this is the scarf for you. Pattern is very visible and you can still see the sparkle. It is very soft type of knit, a nice cold weather scarf. Definitely not for warm weather."
5.0,I do not have a photo seeing as it was bought as a gift for a friend! I will say everything about it was adorable from the metal container to the cute pink velvet bag and the elegant kitty necklace! Absolutely love it!
5.0,"I ordered a size up ( a 10) from experience with bathing suits in general, typically I wear a size 6 or 8 but my rear end is a little bit bigger and basic sizing for bottoms I typically wear a large. The suit fits me perfectly! The neckline is very flattering and it really reminds me of a cute shirt more than a bathing suit. Very elegant/regal! I was worried about the back showing any bulges but it really smooths you out!"
5.0,Good Quality as described
5.0,"what a great product, very informal very casual, very confortable, so cool band"
5.0,She is having so much fun and loves her Tennis shoes Weeelllliiieeesss !!!

5.0,Love it! Go Gators
5.0,Great Lenses. Seem higher quality than the ones that came with my $300 Prada sunglasses. Color matched exactly what came with sunglasses originally.  Lenses also fit perfectly and delivered quickly..
5.0,Loved them in fact bought another pair for my daughter.
5.0,I bought the light beige color. It’s comfortable and cute without looking like an orthopedic sandal. I wore it on vacation where we did a lot of walking. These sandals were so comfortable for my feet that I also chose to wear them on days my feet needed some recovery from walking on sneakers the day before. Would purchase in other colors.
5.0,"I got these for a Matt Murdock/ Daredevil costume and they worked perfectly. Sometimes I wear them if I’m looking at screens shortly before bedtime to cutout the blue light (I’m not sure how scientifically they work in this fashion, but I’ve noticed a difference in terms of soreness). They arrived right on time, and look great. If you are getting them as sunglasses, they aren’t very dark so keep that in mind."
5.0,nice sizes
5.0,Purchased these for my boyfriend to wear around the house. He says they are very comfortable and warm. They are true to size and well worth the price!
5.0,this is really what i wanted!! Tks.
5.0,"I love this too. I get compliments every time I wear it. Great fit, comfortable, material is soft  and light. The back is just cute and sexy. Would love to have this in different colors 👍🏼💕"
5.0,This is a lovely medium-sized rosary center and gives my rosaries a delicate look while still being sturdy. It is one of my favorites.
5.0,"I bought the regular rainbow pairs for my Kindergarten son, and my 3-year-okd daughter also loved them so much I had to get her a pink rainbow pair. My son wears them at least once a week and they have held up well so far."
5.0,cute and chic
5.0,Love this ring. Pretty blue color.
5.0,These were perfect and just as expect. The only part of my daughters Halloween costume that came on time and as advertised. Couldn't be happier with this supplier. Thank you!
5.0,"The front is so cute. It ties and has a designed, textured look. I wore a cardigan because it is mesh in the back. After work I took it off and went to a company cook out and wore a lacey bralette. Doubles for business casual and cookout!"
5.0,"I walk alot,so these are perfect for me.There not restrictive and their light to wear.They are comfortable to wear,and they also have liner inside to keep your junk in place.nice shorts."
5.0,price was very attractive and the fit and quality was just fine.
5.0,I really like these and will order some more.  They are very comfortable.
5.0,Supper comfortable and do not slip
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:876b56b7832b3dfeceea3153723baa0]] Soft sweater and pretty light, the pink matches the photos and the zipper is pretty nice quality and does not get stuck when opening or closing the top. This is a cropped sweatshirt so if you would like a fitted size order appropriately if you would like a loose fit I would suggest ordering up!"
5.0,Super quality. Out lasted my Levi's belt. Still works.
5.0,Excellent Christmas present 🎁!
5.0,Love this little outfit for spring and summer. It gets so hot and humid in the south and my new daughter looks adorable in it!

5.0,"This shirt fits well, I wash every week due to kayaking and sailing and the color stays and fabric is great."
5.0,Theses beautiful earrings can dress up a pair of jeans or be worn with your fanciest party dress. The picture is an accurate representation of these lovely earrings. A fashion must in any jewelry collection!
5.0,The earrings were beautiful. My daughter loved them
5.0,This is a wonderful belt!  My husband loves having the versatility of either a brown or black belt!  It is flexible and looks great.  This is a great gift for that special someone in your life!
5.0,"I work as a RN full-time and these socks have eliminated my leg swelling and leg fatigue. They're great, so I've purchased several more pairs."
5.0,"I love these socks.  The cushion on the bottom makes it so comfortable and warm, but they aren't too thick.  Went to Costco to buy more and they were out- amazon to the rescue"
5.0,"I really liked this product, very good quality, comfort.  my dad loved them"
5.0,"Quality, cool, fun!"
5.0,"Casual, lightweight v neck. Can be dressed up or down."
5.0,Small but oh so cute.
5.0,"I received a very nice item instead of a scrunchie.<br /> It is way more fabric, I'm sure worth much more than a scrunchie,<br />but I still want my scrunchie."
5.0,I love this tank. I had purchased it previously and came to Amazon to order more.
5.0,exelente gracias
5.0,"Nice stretch, tight weave that blocks wind. Great product. Warmer option than your normal buff/gaiter. I keep this in my hunting pack all the time now in the fall/winter."
5.0,My husband is extremely happy with these slippers. They are well constructed and fit perfectly for his large and wide feet. Thank you.
5.0,Been using it and have not had a problem with my jogs
5.0,"I absolutely love this little bracelet. As another reviewer stated, it is so chic and feminine. The simplicity of it contributes in large part to the fact that it is so chic and adorable. I love it very much! I will be wearing this piece very often. The faux pearls are so lovely and lustrous that I can wear it with my any one of my real pearl necklaces and all of my pearl earrings, of which I own several pairs, without the pearls in this bracelet appearing to be obviously faux. I couldn't afford a real pearl bracelet this year, so I was delighted to find this  one amazon and open the package to discover such a nice little piece of jewelry that stands up to all of  the real pearls in my collection. Thank you seller for offering this bracelet. I look forward to seeing anything you might be doing with colored faux gemstones, particularly ruby or amethyst. And thank you for making this piece so incredibly affordable for somebody like me."
5.0,Fit my 18 month old perfectly. Not too thick and not as thin as adult tights. Would definitely order again.
5.0,obsessed with these
5.0,These have held up well.
5.0,So I got my CL's today and they may be immitations but they are SPOT ON! You can't tell the difference!
5.0,Very comfortable and great fit
5.0,Great hat. Great sun protection.
5.0,"I checked &#34;fit as expected&#34; but this means it was nice & roomy, which is how I expected it to be.  Bought it as an xmas present for son's girlfriend and she loved it, and looked great in it."
5.0,"This salwar was absolutely beautiful, simple and elegant. Worth the price and fit perfectly!"
5.0,awesome for doing a bun
5.0,"It’s soft, and it feels really comfortable, but is not worth $20"
5.0,i love this hoodie sweatshirt and it was exactly as pictured and fits as expected.  I have washed it and it washed well no shrinking no fading.  love it and it remains soft and comfortable.
5.0,My husband really likes this messenger bag. It was a good birthday gift. It is definitely an upgrade to the old one he had. It looks expensive and more polished than one made of fabric.
5.0,"OMG...so cute. I will be all set on next travel journey over seas. Seems sturdy enough with zipper located at bottom of luggage. Fits my 25in luggage just right. It’s a little loose for now, being the luggage is empty. But once I pack and fill it up with all my clothes and other travel essentials, I’m sure it will stretch my luggage to the point the cover will fit just right and snug."
5.0,great stuff
5.0,"So... the shower sandals are great for the intended purpose.  They are an inexpensive, but well-made sandal with great wet traction.  Since the top strap is molded into the shoe, I don't see if ever breaking.  My ONLY complaint is that the US Size 13 shoe was a little bit too small--slightly short, and slightly tight.  Too small for me to want to wear them regularly for their intended purpose.  I wish they made a 14!  However, the customer service was so good and responsive, that I give this product 5 stars regardless.  Just be sure to order up if you have any questions (and you don't have a size 13 foot)!"
5.0,Love these shirts and they wash and wear very nicely. I use them mostly for under see through and low cut dresses and tops so I wear them to work a lot but the are great casual tops too! They fit me well.
5.0,It was better than we expected
5.0,"Needed an umbrella for the car but the slot available was quite short. Got this umbrella and have been quite happy with it.<br /><br />It is small when folded, but large enough to protect me from the rain and sleet I have used it in.<br /><br />Opened easily and properly every time I used it and folded back up with no snags or twists.<br /><br />Haven't used in very strong winds yet, but held up to some pretty heavy sleet and a stiff breeze with no problem.<br /><br />I got the red one so hopefully I will not lose site of it or forget it somewhere.<br /><br />I have have had great use of this umbrella and would recommend as a purse, bag, backpack, or car umbrella.  Small in size, but solid quality and usability.<br /><br />Best compact umbrella I have ever had."
5.0,"Having spent many years in a business environment, I have worn a lot of dress socks. I don't like most of them, so when I find some I do, I stick with them. These are by far the best quality for the price I have found- better than Gold Toe, and less expensive (much like the Kirkland Signature dress shirts and pants). When Costco was not carrying them (hopefully, just for the season), I looked to Amazon to try to source some. Got a nice pack for a comparable price to Costco."
5.0,"This product is excellent for a small size workout bag. I keep my keys, water and small towel secure while In the fitness club.  It works out great for me"
5.0,"Good quality, very comfortable."
5.0,I bought a lot of different necklace sets for my 15 year old daughter this year and this is her favorite one out of all of them.
5.0,I love this tie! It's just like the ones you find in the store for 40 + dollars. I purchased several different colors and have been wearing them to work with out any issues.
5.0,Fits as expected and comes with a cute box! The jewelry shines very bright and will Not change color! I bought as a gift and she loved it!
5.0,"Perfect for nose rings!! Good quality and very easy to put in. All these people complaining about them bending when you open them, must have club fingers because I had no problem at all. Would definitely buy again!"
5.0,"This is great leotard for my four year old daughter.  She wears a size 4, so I ordered the 4-6X.  It fits her great, with a little growing room.  I love the color on her.  We've owned a couple other Capezio Leotard's and all have held up well over time.  Great quality for the price!"
5.0,"Probably one of my favorite things I’ve ever purchased on Amazon. Perfect crossbody strap for any SLG LV bag. 10/10, just stop looking and buy it!"
5.0,Love it and looks good on me!!!
5.0,This watch is not everyone's cup of tea. its a nice watch. its a fun watch. if you are looking for homage watch that will keep time and work for a longtime then this watch is for you. after a few weeks of purchasing this watch there is times i feel a little embarrassed to wear it because its a little flashy I'm not trying to impress anyone or give the wrong impression that its a rolex. i bought this watch as a fashion accessory. i rather wear this orient gold watch then a cheap designer michael Kor's quartz watch. Honestly i can't afford to buy a real gold watch that will cost me $12k-40k so this watch is a good quality fashion accessory. its clean and simple and its the correct size for a small to medium wrist. from a distance people will think its a rolex but keep it real its not a rolex lol. just remember to keep your hands clean from oils or cologne or any chemicals and water when wearing this watch if you want the gold plating to last a long time.
5.0,"Love the Color and Texture of this quality scarf.<br />It is lightweight, soft,Not bulky, Very thin ,but -the colors on the primary side of scarf , predominantly<br /> plum  beige blue - But...Solid plum on the back side and nice quality blended fringe.<br />  Two looks for the one price!!"
5.0,it fit good  not bad  love it
5.0,No missing pieces or broken pieces...Its a great price/quality
5.0,"I always try to write a review on Amazon products because I know how helpful it can be. That being said, these are amazinggg!! Shipping was on time, great quality and have gotten so many compliments. Do recommend."
5.0,"Love these pants! Wore them to run this morning, and they did not ride down. Which is a huge plus for me! They seem to run a bit small, but loosen up after wearing for awhile. The length is great too. Im 5'7 and they more then cover my sneakers. Love them!"
5.0,Works well to just quickly clip them on then go to any pair of glasses especially since I have prescriptioned glasses.
5.0,"Did what it's supposed to do, kept my head warm in 50+/- temps.  The design was cool, too.  Another thing, it was thin and easy to carry in my pocket for a day hike."
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous, the green is vibrant and perfect for the holiday party circuit. It fits perfectly and is stretchy enough to let me breathe. The (some poly blend I'm sure) satin feels silky soft to the touch and has the right amount of shine; it feels amazing on the skin; so comfortable you kind of forget you're wearing a formal. Will probably pick up another one in silver or black."
5.0,I love it! My first stop watch ever and I couldn't be more satisfied. It's stunning and works great!
5.0,Perfect!  Kid loves them!
5.0,Just what I needed! Will buy again!
5.0,Very practical and comfortable!
5.0,"50 liter bag that will fit a lot of clothes if need be. I would recommend this as a back-up bag for campers or people that want to do a day time hike with a lot of equipment.<br /><br />Pros: Very light and collapsible to a perfect size.<br /><br />Cons: None ( Do not place sharp or pointed objects inside the bag, it might tear)"
5.0,Good workout tank. Fits well and has good coverage. Good layering piece for winter if you work outside. Washes well.
5.0,I bought this purse for my girlfriend as a Mothers Day Gift. She loved it and it lifted her spirits
5.0,It do it job
5.0,"The pockets hit my torso at an odd place but other than that, fits great. Very soft and comfortable. I have not washed it yet."
5.0,Very cute. More only polyester side and runs larger than I normally get same sz. Highly suggest maybe if you don't want a loose comfy fit. Size down.
5.0,Well priced for the product !
5.0,"Excellent in every way, appearance, function, and price all excellent."
5.0,Looks great and fits to size.

5.0,These are lovely. Happy I purchased them
5.0,Conversation starter!
5.0,Love love this dress i got alot of compliment on the dress
5.0,"I love the watch it simply superb , infact i thought to buy other one as well with the promotion vochure which Etevon promissed but the way Etevon customer service works depressed me.<br /><br />I think its there marketing strategy, they asked me to provide review comments where they will send some gift vochure kind of stuff but all that is non sense they dnt respond to emails or they do have customer service where we can reach out to them."
5.0,"Love this look, very sexy just wish the necklace camed with it. Will be buying again."
5.0,"I bought this ring for my seven year old daughter. I find it so hard to find quality rings in children sizes and this one was perfect. She loves it!  And it came in the cutest heart shaped box.  I couldn't decide whether I like the ring or the box more!  A great price as well.  That way if she does loose it, it's not the end of the world.  I am thinking of buying one for me and for my 4 year old as well!"
5.0,very cute and NOT SEE THROUGH despite they are white / light colors. they are on the thicker side and they are a higher rise legging which I prefer so I don't need to keep pulling up or adjusting. comfy . love this brand
5.0,So beautiful. Perfect size. It was easy to place.
5.0,Amazing fit...
5.0,For my 5 year old. Soft after washing and fits as expected.
5.0,"Love these blouses, wash by hand, hang up, put on!  Bought 4 of them"
5.0,Beautiful and great price. Unique shoe but more like a size 8 US and according to the size chart it should've been more 8.5 US but over all very nice shoe. I will try to manage to squeeze into them :)
5.0,Love this dress! It’s so comfy and it’s very flattering. It can easily be dressed up
5.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): I really love these gold and pearl earrings.  They are beautiful and different from any other earrings I've owned.  I initially had to switch them out because I had them in the wrong ears, but once facing the right way they make sense and are interesting and eye-catching.  They are very good quality and are well-made.  The posts do not cause my ear holes any irritation (a problem for me with some earrings).  The earrings come in a nice gift box and would make a lovely gift."
5.0,"This mask is great!  Good fit for me, and very sparkly!  Love it!"
5.0,"This is the second time I purchase these hats for my children, we lost the last pair whilst on vacation. They give really good face coverage and the adjustable band along with the chin strap keep the hat secure but comfortable."
5.0,As advertized. Love it
5.0,I love them! Already looking at placing an order for another design from this company.
5.0,"Very nice bracelet! I'm happy with the item, seller, and how it arrived on time.<br />I got it for my 13 year old daughter, who loves 1D, I surprised her with it and she was super happy when she saw, it was so cute!<br />The clasp seems to work good, I will say that on her wrist, the bracelet seems to be on the bigger side, so I put it on the smallest clasp setting, and it still moves around a little but doesn't seem to be at risk of falling off, so I guess it fits right.<br /><br />Just a head's up if you're getting it for a little tween or teen, she's very average sized for her age, so it would probably be pretty big on a younger or super skinny  kid. Anyway, it's awesome and was definitely worth the purchase!"
5.0,Fits well and as described from photo.  Fast shipping and well protected.  Quality appears high.  Recommended seller!
5.0,So Pretty!!  Perfect for an afternoon Tea Party.  Fits perfectly and material has some stretch to it.
5.0,Absolutely love very warm and doesn’t shrink
5.0,Cant get the right size and i love need a 8.5 woman help me
5.0,Nice jacket and versatile.
5.0,My grandson was very happy getting this shirt for Christmas.  He has washed and placed in dryer on low heat and as of this day no shrinkage and wrinkling along without fading of color.
5.0,I like the way the stretch with you and they fit nicely.
5.0,"Fits great, mainly hidden but what does show still looks cute because it's lace. So happy I got these! Love that it also comes with a wash bag to help make them last as long as possible. I'm"
5.0,This is a must have item for Ugly Christmas Outfits!!!! Great quality!!
5.0,"This shirt is comfortable, cute and affordable! It washes well; no fading or shrinking so far, and the letters still look great. Fits as expected, so ordering your typical size is fine."
5.0,Excellent for wearing underneath earmuffs. No more pressure points.<br /><br />Extra points for the seller. I asked them to ship earlier if they could and they were more then accommodating.
5.0,The dress fits as the sizing chart states. Just make sure you look at the chart.
5.0,"Fits perfectly, super soft and adorable"
5.0,works very well
5.0,"I needed a simple / easy to use digital watch....this is it.  Very reasonable price for this water resistant watch, even with my average eye sight this is a great watch...durable too!"
5.0,I bought this to wear for my wedding and was every thing and more that I wanted. and the price was perfect and some will recommend this to all my girl friends.
5.0,Helps my carpel tunnel yet hide my surgery scar.
5.0,I had ordered this item on Amazon and then saw many similar products at store for cheaper before this item arrives and i thought that i had payed more than what it was worths.But when it arrived i found that it was completely different from other products.It was made from a high quality material and it looked amazing.Also the mirror glasses looked nice.It was totally different and it is worth the money.But i had returned it because it didn't fix my boyfriends face and it was big for him so pay attention to the size that is described on the item description.
5.0,Nice quality.  Looks like expensive leather
5.0,"Cute earrings, great price"
5.0,Love them! !
5.0,Love it!!! Very well made!!!!
5.0,like them.
5.0,Got this for mother’s day and I love it. Went back to get another color but they were sold out. There is a hidden pocket inside.
5.0,"They fit nicely and are easy to walk in. I really love the zippers, one to actually put the shoe on and the outside zipper for style. They're quite comfortable too."
5.0,Looks beautiful can't wait for easter
5.0,These arrived just in time for a cold snap!  My early commute was made much more comfortable when I didn’t feel the cold of the steering wheel while waiting for the car to warm up. They were a perfect fit and feel very durable. Looking forward to a warmer winter with them!
5.0,"I love these earings.  I was skeptical at first because of the mention of ears turning green in some reviews but I tried anyway.  I guess some are okay with it and some not.  I am glad they are working so well with me.  i love the fact that I can share them with my husband.  They are not very feminine, they have more of a unisex look.  I would definitely buy some more."
5.0,"Fits my 4 month old daughter perfectly. Needed a hat that tied under the chin so it would stay on without falling off the back, or flopping forward over her eyes. Stays in place, very adorable hat. Neutral colors."
5.0,Nice in Pilates class which short sleeves shirts
5.0,The dress has lots of stretch.  It has beautiful lace sleeves.  It has a sweetheart neckline.  I am 5’3 so it wasn’t too long if worn with heels. The dress is well made.  Only thing it is better worn during cooler months.  The dress is pretty heavy to be worn in the summer months which I did.
5.0,"I'm stunned. I usually pass on the romper style, but this was too stylish to pass. I'm so grateful for the way it looks on me and must say it is very well made. Right on!"
5.0,"Bought this for my military boyfriend to remind him of his hometown while he's stationed in California! He loves it, and gets compliments on it all the time!"
5.0,My daughter loves this hoodie! It’s been washed several times and the colors have held perfectly. I was a little nervous with the dark and light colors but the black didn’t bleed into the white or anything.
5.0,good stretch with these!
5.0,"It's big, but I am using it as a summer dress - love the material (thin, but I bought the black so it's not an issue), adjustable straps, just love it!"
5.0,"VERY flattering! Hits in all the right places. Only complaint is that it started to get some &#34;nubbies&#34; as soon as I wore it. However, considering the price, I won't complain."
5.0,"COVID Prevention<br />  These are too breathable to really protect you from COVID- if this is your concern.<br /><br />COVID Mask Requirements<br />  If you are needing something to go to the store, but don't worry about COVID- these are perfect.<br /><br />Outdoor use<br />  I love these when I am out digging in the dirt or when I am dusting the house. It keeps most of the nasty air out while expelling my air out so I do not get too hot. The ear hoops, while keeping it up and secure, are a bit too loose on me, and fit perfectly on my husband.<br /><br />If you have longer short hair, how it holds up it does get into the hairline at the back of your neck. For me, it does create some interesting mask hair."
5.0,"Nice, loose material, not see through, true to color, amazing price, looks like it does in the photos. However, I am 5'3 and 170 lbs so I got a medium, but would like it to fit a little tighter so I'm ordering a small."
5.0,Beautiful. Love it.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter who always seems to forget her license or credit card. Now she can attach this little wallet to her car keys and never drive without a license. The wallet its self is very nice and big enough for cards and cash. She loved it.
5.0,"Easy and simple. You can throw it on your shoulders to protect your shoulders, arms and neck. I wear it also when I drive to protect against the sun on my neck/decolle"" area when I drive facing the sun. It is ight enough to carry in your bag/purse. I don't find it too warm when the weather is hot, I would even say the material makes it refreshing on your skin. Washed it only once so far, hand wash, cold water with delicate Woolite. Recommend it, great product for sun protection."
5.0,Jack rocks
5.0,"This is exactly what I have been looking for.  I am using this for an upper ear piercing,  It is the most comfortable earring I have ever had for that purpose.  The flat back makes it perfect when you lay your head down on that ear.  It is small and cute."
5.0,Beautiful!  Feels great on like those expensive comfort wedding bands.  It's so different and sooo reasonably priced.  This too will catch a lot of compliments! Lovely!!
5.0,"This bad boy is sick! I live in The Bay and hang with a lot of DJs, so you can imagine that most of my peeps have a collection of G-Shocks.  Guess what?, nobody's got this one! I love it! It's easy to read and the buttons are tucked away so they don't get damaged. The fabric strap does get a little dirty if you wear this to the gym, but it cleans up easy. This watch is BIG and TALL. It covers my whole wrist and sits up off my wrist.  This shouldn't be a problem for G lovers--we like 'em BIG and CHUNKY!.  I wish it came in more colors, but all-in-all this watch is dope."
5.0,"Nice Fit, Good Quality, Keeps You Warm. Nice To The Touch.👍🏿"
5.0,I wear these a lot! They are so cute and stylish with today's top trends! I got these in silver and black. very pretty
5.0,Got this as a replacement case for some glasses I have and it works great. Construction seems sturdy and looks like it will outlast the generic case that comes with new glasses.
5.0,I used this for a bicycling food drive and it worked great with my bike helmet.
5.0,"I have a small face, petite, and these glasses fit perfect! Absolutely love them! Regular size glasses look too big on my face."
5.0,Very warm & comfy!
5.0,The designs are beautiful. The material is thick and great quality. The are so soft to touch
5.0,These fit perfectly. Quite comfortable for a pair of sneakers.
5.0,"I am 5’1 and 131 pounds, i wear medium size shirts most of the time. I also just had a baby a few months back so I’ve been looking for loose tops for women. This is perfect! I got a size medium and I can’t tell you how perfect this is. It has that oversized look but not too oversized to where you feel like you’re wearing a bag haha. The sleeves also are tight from wrist to elbow so it gives the rest of the shirt such a nice look. It is really just like the picture. I’d say trust your size and go for it! Would definitely look cute in tights/leggings which is what I’m going to wear it with!"
5.0,"They are just as pictured. Nice slim profile to fit easily in your handbag. You will need an additional change purse if you want to carry coins, but all in all, a good value for 2 for the money."
5.0,I am 5 foot 5 inches and 184 lbs. currently.  I hold most of my weight in my mid section and chest (38DDD +).  I ordered an XL and it fits beautifully. I will likely have to pin the chest area so it doesn't reveal too much cleavage but overall this dress is wonderful.  I love the feel of the materials and it is so comfortable I could wear it to bed!
5.0,"Everyone has been commenting about the weight of these earrings but, in my opinion, the weight is to be expected, these were once bullets. I love these earrings, they're cute and give any outfit a little amount of flare. I would most definitely recommend these earrings to others. They're great. Side note: the weight actually isn't bad, they're fairly light to me."
5.0,Very nice ! Good material nice style!!
5.0,A little long but that's what I wanted. The shirt is really soft.
5.0,"great design, quality shirt"
5.0,"I am quite pleased with this shirt, it is loose and soft - and if you order according to size chart from the picture it will fit nicely - just make sure to measure yourself. I will wear it to leggings but I am sure you can wear it as a dress also. I was searching for tunic that would have long sleeve ( most of the tunics are 3/4 so I was happy to find this one ) I think for the price it is great value."
5.0,These gloves are probably the most useful things I have ever used. I live in Michigan where it's perfect to use them. I don't have to drive with cold hands. They are also so warm but look at thin.
5.0,I purchased this  Cap for 6 years old. It has adjustable clip on the back which worked great. I am also happy with a quality of the product.
5.0,Llego muy a tiempo
5.0,went on easy brought coat back to life
5.0,Love it. Also love seeing it in sync with my other atomic watch. They got my watch from Japan to my front door in Texas in 17 days. Impressive.
5.0,Worked as described (so far); very good quality and easy to use.
5.0,Mothers Day gift.
5.0,This was such a hard shirt to find . I’ve received tons of compliments and likes on social media and while in the public. It has a boxy fit so if you want a true to size or more of the snug look then size down .
5.0,Sencillo pero elegante
5.0,"I  love working out but hate my baby hairs flying all over the place. This headband is so soft and it stays in place. You can wear it wide or make it more narrow by rolling it. I got the 3 pack, and I love the colors, they go with everything!"
5.0,My friend loved his gift
5.0,"This dress is amazing! Butter soft material, flattering, and pockets. You can dress down with flip flops or up with a pair of wedges. True to size. I am a size 16, 5'3, and a 38 DD. I bought an xlarge and it is perfect. If you have a smaller bust you can size down since it is very flattering with a lot of stretch. The price point is a little expensive but this pattern was on clearance for 15.99 so worth it. I will be definitely be purchasing the long sleeve version of this dress come fall."
5.0,I use these whole working construction. They are the  enough to still be comfortable I the Florida heat but limit the dust that I breathe and Jeep the sun off of my face. Beautiful colors.
5.0,Fits very comfortably and exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
5.0,Nevermind found the other boot..
5.0,Great product and price.
5.0,Had this set in my wifes wedding ring after she lost her .5 c diamond.  She loves it and it looks like a real diamond.  The jeweler said the price was execellent also.
5.0,"o what I'm used to wearing because they are big ,but I received a lot of comments on how well they like it so I will well them often"
5.0,The size and the elephant so elegant looking
5.0,Such a funny little novelty that got oodles of laughs on St.Patrick’s Day!
5.0,Loved it.  Needed a stand in ring and it worked perfect.  Not too snug or loose.  For perfect.  Looked great
5.0,I really like the quality and convenience of the two different colored cases tha I have!
5.0,I liked that this covered my back. Really cute. I would buy again if they had more colors.
5.0,Nice comfortable suit.  Quality brand
5.0,"This thing is great! My daughter has only had it for a week and so I can't speak to longevity but with the quality of this bag, I can't imagine it lasting anything short of a lifetime.<br /><br />It's roomy without the bag being too bulky. Plenty of space for a 10oz thermos, chips, fruit, veggie and dip. It comes with an insert as well. I use it to wrap the thermos to add a barrier between the hot and cold food.<br /><br />I made a point to take pictures of the hardware because it's so sturdy and high-end. Not something you expect to see on a lunch bag. But then again, it's a sustainable bag and it's made to last<br /><br />The strap is adjustable. Best Part- ITS ECO FRIENDLY! I have made a pact with myself to only purchase sustainable eco friendly items and cut out all other garbage and this bag was an excellent investment."
5.0,"wore it the next day to work ...fits good ,comfortable , and flattering on love it"
5.0,"Good product overall. Lightweight, breathable and you can adjust the tension on one side so it stays on your face."
5.0,just loving my dress it fit so well I odered a blue as well .
5.0,Love this dress!!! Will definitely look to order more this company! Sized correctly.
5.0,These booties fit my bub nicely and keep his toes warm.
5.0,This is really for me! I really love its design! I am happy that I was able to purchased it here at Amazon. Five stars for it.
5.0,A love it excited to have my FAV MLB team last championship 🧢
5.0,It fits well and keeps me warm.
5.0,Lovely accent piece
5.0,This outfit was a perfect fit for my son Disney Day at school. My son is 30lbs. The outfit was good quality.
5.0,"It fit as expected, light weight, breathable and looks nice."
5.0,"Had read some mixed reviews but for price thought worth a shot.  For me personally easy to use, looks much better ( not best photos, sorry ) but promise you in person much better.  Id say give them a try."
5.0,I love it ... I just ordered another one
5.0,"My wife is very pleased with this case. The colors match exactly what on-line pictures indicated it should be. The rubber piece that fits around the phone is flexible but sturdy. The buttons on the side are covered up, but because of the flexible nature of the shell into which the phone fits, their functions are accessible. Good deal, nice price"
5.0,"So soft, so comfortable, so flattering!  This set is so much better than all my other p.j.'s!!"
5.0,This is so adorable my daughter loves it great quality!!
5.0,QUick delivery. Product as described.
5.0,Very solid and durable kids shoe!
5.0,"Color is even prettier in real life! Very pretty pastel purple color, nice thickness, very soft and back detail is super cute!"
5.0,I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them. They look very nice in person and come in a nice little box to keep them safely stored.
5.0,I don't need to get into details.
5.0,Love this hat.
5.0,Quality shirt that is exactly as expected.
5.0,This dress fit perfectly everywhere and hugged all the right places. It really boosted my confidence! Great quality for the price.
5.0,I used these to make corsages for the mothers and grandmothers in my wedding. Turned out great and looked wonderful!
5.0,I love these!  Adjustable flip-flops and very comfortable.
5.0,"They have kept their original condition and look good, I wish there were some without the little hinge thing to open and close it but oh well"
5.0,"Good quality on the logo, really soft and accurate size fit."
5.0,Very pretty.  I wear them in all my different ear piercings.
5.0,I was worried when I first got it but as soon as I put it on it was perfect in length and how flattering it is to your body!
5.0,Love this dress for date night
5.0,Nice wallett.
5.0,Love the ring. It is really beautiful and big.
5.0,"Living in South Florida I notice my hands are aging because of the long drive I do by car and this has been the solution.  I can see my hands not as wrinkle as before.  If I knew about this product, I would have bought them long ago. I have already washed one pair and still look great"
5.0,"Pajamas  are soft, comfortable  azad nd fit perfectly  a good purchase"
5.0,"The fabric has great recovery, it doesn’t bag out at the knees!  I have the short in black and decided I needed the leggings because of the no seam at the crotch and they have side pockets.  They fit great and I’m SUPER picky when it comes to leggings and fabric.  I bought a small in the short but bought a XS in the legging."
5.0,Es muy cómodo y tiene un ajuste perfecto.
5.0,The dress length is perfectly right in between. It isn’t too short nor too long. Great for any occasion that would require a sexy little black dress.
5.0,"I am obsessed with this small backpack. Its great for hiking, a beach day, or even a daily bag. There are so many useful compartments and the pocket on the side fits a water bottle! Not to mention the SPACE i can fit anything in this back!"
5.0,"I own about a dozen watches and I've owned about a dozen more. I bought this for the &#34;gadget factor&#34; because I wanted to know tide times when I go to the shore, and the moon thing is cool, but I end up wearing this all the time in lieu of my nicer (more expensive) watches because this thing is STRIKINGLY COMFORTABLE! I seriously never feel it on me. It just disappears.<br /><br />It's also the right size. And, by that, I mean that it doesn't have a gargantuan body. It's clearly a men's watch, but it's really on the smallish size for a watch of this type.<br /><br />[Edited later: It's not years later. I wore this thing until I wore the band all the way through so I bought it again. Still my fav watch of all time. And all the features work. I think it helps that they're all &#34;time&#34; related features, which works to the strengths of a digital watch, rather than, say, temperature or compass, which watches don't seem to do well. But the tides feature works well (or can be easily adjusted when you get to the beach, and the moon feature has never been incorrect. Also, I love that this is one of the few Casios with metal buttons; they're a nice touch.]"
5.0,Fit perfectly. I'm 5'4 & 120 pounds and the small fit me perfectly. I wish they were a little shorter but I knew that I was going to think that.
5.0,2nd pair and will buy more
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!!!! Just as described. I LOVE it.
5.0,Great gift for a cat lover. Silhouette reminds me of a Siamese cat which is why I bought it. Very pretty and dainty earring
5.0,I absolutely loved this dress. I got a medium based off the reviews but unfortunately it didn’t fit my bust and waist area without being too tight. It’s good quality and the length is perfect for anyone on the shorter side like myself. I’m 5ft even and it’s so hard to find dresses like this for my size but this one is perfect. I’m 152lb and 5ft and I would say a large would be best to fit perfect! Unfortunately I had to return it and get a different dress in able to have it in time for an event but if I had more time this would have been the one for me
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I got it to wear for my son’s graduation and it will be perfect. Dressy  without being too formal. Cool, breezy but still socially acceptable.<br /><br />First off, it is exactly as described. It is so hard to know what you are going to get when ordering off of the internet, whether it will look like the picture, be sized correctly, be decent quality. This product actually was all that.<br /><br />The neck line is suggestive, but not too revealing. I have a small bust and don’t fill out dresses like this which often means some unintentional flashing. But not with this one. The way it’s sewn keeps everything under wraps, so to speak.<br /><br />The empire waist is very flattering. The stitching is done to perfection and provides the right amount of tension. The patterning of the stitching is very pretty as well as being comfortable. The bottom is very flowy and comfortable.<br /><br />I purchased a size 12 (or large) and it fit me perfectly. Roomy, but not baggy. Form fitting in areas, but not tight.<br /><br />For reference my measurements are approximately:<br />Bust:36<br />Underbust: 32<br />Waist: 33<br />Hips:  37<br /><br />Lastly, washing it is easy and didn’t harm the dress at all. I hate sorting laundry or having to hand wash things, so this is perfect for me.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this to anyone!<br /><br />Full disclosure: I have received this product at a reduced price ($4.99) in exchange for an HONEST review. I take reviewing seriously (as I rely on reviews myself when purchasing products) and will only give 100% truthful feedback. I NEVER receive product in exchange for giving a favorable review. Don’t believe me? Check out my other reviews. A free product does not equal a 5 star review with me.<br /><br />Click on my profile for a little Q&A about being a reviewer which may answer some of your questions and concerns. Thank you!"
5.0,Holding up well in the wash. Very little shrinkage if any.
5.0,This is a cool little hoody runs small but has a lot of character.  Very warn and cozy!
5.0,"I bought the black dress in a large. I just had a baby a few months ago so I wanted something cute but not too tight. I love it, can’t wait to wear it out!"
5.0,"These are so stinking soft on the inside! And with irredescent sparkles on the outside? What's not to love?! Size is average adult, could be a bit smaller since they're most likely to be worn by women, but I still love them. I work in a school and the kids think they're awesome too =)"
5.0,"They got confiscated by my daughter, so I just ordered another pair. :)"
5.0,Great quality looks very high end but at a fraction of the price.
5.0,These were the perfect upgrade to my Dr. Marten 7 eye boots.  The boots were a tad loose and I was wanting a little more cushion in my step.  These insoles fit perfectly.  These are thin with extra cushion in the heel.  I bought the same size insole as my boots and they fit perfectly.
5.0,Nice quality sunglasses
5.0,Exactly what I needed for night running. It holds a charge for months.
5.0,"I think everyone knows why I bought these but I didn't expect to buy more shortly after getting them. I have 2 kids in school and they needed masks and love The Flash. The quality of the sewing and consistency of the masks we purchased was great and they all fit the same. My youngest who is a little on the small side for his age had trouble with most other masks and couldn't wear even a kids gaiter, but these were perfect for him. The elastic is just long enough to hold the masks in place but not so tight as to make the masks dig in or get uncomfortable. We have 7 different masks and I have recommended them to a lot of parents that ask for a mask like our boys have. The designs are all perfectly placed on the masks which is great since my son hated that some of the other masks that are just made out of fabric don't get the logos or designs centered well."
5.0,beyond expectations. especially the printing is really good!
5.0,"Comfortable fabric, covers all that they should and after many washings have held up well.  I have worn them all summer with no issues."
5.0,I am so happy to be supporting this small business I love the scrub hats I received and will recommend this company to all my friends and family
5.0,Really pretty and comfy
5.0,This is a very well constructed tie out of very nice material.  It looks very professional and hubs likes it very much.  It comes in a nice box for gifting.
5.0,Pretty shoes for young girls-Just enough of a heel to make a little girl feel special.
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised when this sweatshirt arrived.  I ordered it to wear as a layer.  This is as heavy as the other name brand medium weight I'm used to but at a better price!
5.0,The color of the turquoise is beautiful and the silver work sets the stone off nicely. I am proud to be wearing jewelry made by fellow Native Americans! Yakoke!
5.0,These are a perfect size & the price makes them a true value.
5.0,My son ordered these. They work really well he is very pleased.
5.0,Looks rustic and is well made!
5.0,"Nice sturdy traps,  fit great and are nice and saturated in color."
5.0,I have very bad eyes and I needed a pair of thick but fabulous glasses and THESE were def it! I get lots of compliments on them and I love how they look on me
5.0,This is great quality for the price! Does tangle a little easy
5.0,"i've ordered a bunch of these since we constantly snap them by leaving the phone on our belt and get in and out of cars. (not the products fault, our fault) But every one of them fit just like the original."

5.0,I LOOOOOVE THIS DRESS!! I bought this for my husbands 1950s family reunion and didn't expect to love it as much as I do BUT It fits just right and I look forward to wearing it over and over! (Without the extra petticoat that I bought separately that is. It was super hot with it but so cute!) If you are wearing it for a special occasion you def. need to get a petticoat to make it poof out but if it is just for everyday wear it is comfortable and cool. I even did my nails to match with Nail Wraps that I designed myself to go with it specifically.
5.0,🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣
5.0,Beautiful dress- love it!!
5.0,had slight difficulty in not getting correct color BUT  worked out a great agreement with &#34;riders discount&#34; who supplied the boots very happy!!
5.0,"I purchased these for my 13 year old daughter and she is loving them!  She is 134 pounds and 5'4"" tall and the medium fits her perfect."
5.0,These look great and have held up well.
5.0,"My feet finally felt normal walking. I had some overpronation in one foot, and wearing these I can now go all day without knee pain or ankle pain."
5.0,Silky. Soft. Breaths. Loose fit but not boxy. Many compliments. Looked great with jeans.
5.0,Love this dress and the color.  Lots of compliments.  Ordered a small. 5'8 and 125 lbs
5.0,I love everything about this handbag. It is big and has a compartment in the center. The style is what I wanted. It is leather which I was unsure of until I purchased. What a good deal for the price.
5.0,Love the feel and fit of these!
5.0,"I highly recommend it. They look amazing, the quality is great and the array of colors makes it easy for the little fashionista to match the mask with their outfit."
5.0,These are beautiful and I get compliments on them all the time. One thing is they are turning color at the metal that is in the ear but that won’t stop me from wearing them.
5.0,"So comfortable, my new favorite yoga pants.  Pockets are perfect!"
5.0,I really like these rings I use them for work. They are very comfortable and I often forget I have one on. If you work in construction I would highly recommend these to keep your hand safe from snagging and hurting you skin.
5.0,I'm glad they're silver as they were easy to clean. I get a lot of compliments on these. They're unique.
5.0,Super fast shipping.  Very high quality item I've seen sell for much higher in stores
5.0,The color is really nice and as I expected. I love the burnt orange and the dark grey I bought. I like the rough trim on the sleeves and neckline. They give the shirt more character than just being a regular t-shirt. And I love V-neck t-shirts anyway. I bought a Small and it does fits more snug than I prefer and I know it will shrink when it's washed. If you like your shirts to be loose and love all cotton like me then maybe order one size larger. Wish I had. I'll be sure to wash them on cold and I guess hang dry. But they will probably need to be ironed if they can't be put in the dryer.<br />I think I'll order a couple in medium and see how I like that.<br />Still love the shirt and would definitely recommend them to anyone who likes their shirts all cotton like I do. Most of the shirts out there now are a polyester blend and I do not like that!
5.0,"Needed for a formal event. Took a chance and ordered these, hoping they weren't too cheap looking. They did not disappoint,  they are gorgeous for the $."
5.0,Love it love it love it!!!!!<br />Quality of material is excellent.<br />I wear size 8 and ordered large and it fits perfect. Love Miusol dresses :-)
5.0,Love this shirt.  Fits great and feels great!  Nice quality.
5.0,They fit well. Get a size bigger because they run small. Made well and hug your butt. Ride low in the front but cover well.
5.0,Perfect! Sturdy enough for overnight and all day use.
5.0,Looks great for the price
5.0,"This is a great looking hat, and sits tall on the head as it should. Would buy again for sure!!"
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PULLOVER, because its so big and WARM, however the neck and wrists are somewhat small but i guess it will stretch over time! :)"
5.0,Quality is to be expected. Did not receive earrings though. My ears are gauged so really didn’t care. Just bought it for a photo session
5.0,"They were great! They even came with a nice  eye glasses case. I was very impressed. Same quality as the last pair we bought that  have survived a over a year with a 2 year old boy. We're only getting new ones to have a different color. We've tried Dilli Dalli, Miraflex,  Tots and Zoobug. These are our favorite by far for both fit and price. We love our Enzos!"
5.0,Durable. Perfect for stadium/concerts. Cant wait to try them out!
5.0,"Beautiful n cheap, long delivery"
5.0,When it arrived my daughter could not wait to try iy on my granddaughter. I was a perfect  fit. Seems so cool and comfortable . It looks adorable and my three year old granddaughter loves it. It looked as good after washing as it did before
5.0,No issue with this product. Seems to be made well and my daughter likes it.
5.0,"Earring are very lightweight, and they are very unique!  Love"
5.0,These are soft and comfortable.  I was buying one pair of comperable socks for the price of all four of these.  I use them around the house as slippers.  I would prefer all grey and black but I'm very happy with them.
5.0,I was amazed at how beautiful this turned out! The picture came out perfectly and the package came earlier than expected! I can’t wait to gift this!
5.0,Hate the cold North wind in my ears.  This is perfect!!
5.0,So far excellent. Happy with the way it looks hope it doesn't tarnish from reviews I have read it should be a great buy
5.0,Was a cute gift.  Recipient wished it came in gold but I could not find it in gold.  But it is as pictured.
5.0,Perfect casual dress. Very comfortable. I wear a size 4 and small was perfect. I dry flat instead of putting in the dryer because I don’t want to risk it shrinking at all since it fits so well. I always get compliments when I wear it!
5.0,Very delicate &dainty looking.  Well made!
5.0,"These sun glasses are amazing for their price, I don't have any discomfort at all when am using them even if it's so sunny outside, they look so fancy and their package is very protective and unique, since I bought them (2 months ago) am only using them."
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! I bought this dress for a funeral during the day & it was so nice & comfy that I kept it on for going out to dinner later on that night. Light weight & the fabric isn’t see through. I’m 5’2” and the dress length was just covering my toes. I can’t wait to wear this dress again.
5.0,"I use it for my trip to New York , and it was my lifesaver.  Very warm and cover my  ears and is super cute.. I love it."
5.0,I liked this initial charm.<br /><br />This charm was lovely. It would work on a bracelet. I think it would be good for anyone from a child to an adult. It is very cute and looked good on my bracelet.<br /><br />I thought it was unique. It came packaged nicely. It would make a good gift. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />It was very comfortable to wear. It was flattering on. I felt it was reasonable. I would recommend it.<br /><br />It is nice to get real sterling silver.
5.0,These are the cutest heavy duty tights/leggings. Great value.
5.0,"These are perfect!  Arrived in less than 10 days. They fit my five month old baby girl perfect.  Don't leave a mark on her head. For coming from China, the material doesn't look cheap."
5.0,Queda hermosa
5.0,I'm in LOVE
5.0,"Beautiful, thank you!"
5.0,Nice belt. Came in a box with a pouch. Very impressive.
5.0,This sunglasses for my husband are really nice. He has use it to go boating. They look expensive and look really nice on him. Nice case. I really like it .Hope the also have it with brown frames. I will recommend this item. AP 7/25/19.
5.0,Awesome. Love everything about it. Absolutely exceeded expectations!!
5.0,Color and fit great very comfortable
5.0,"My husband got this shirt and it fits him perfectly. It is a nice color and he really like the pop of blue where the buttons are. We are sure how it does in the wash yet, but he is very happy he got this shirt."
5.0,I get so many compliments on this band
5.0,So far I love them. They are thin which is what I was wanting.  Love the look and feel
5.0,This is exactly what the 17 year old wanted. She has been wearing it with her sweater many times since Christmas! Thank you.
5.0,They get tangled very easy. And be careful where you store them or they will turn black. But these necklaces were great for the price. I've worn them now many times and they are still holding up. I've gotten compliments on them too.
5.0,I loved this dress. It is really comfortable.
5.0,I put this product on my dogs harness for when we went camping so she was easy to spot at night time. It worked great!
5.0,"My wife and I have been married over ten years. When we got engaged, she insisted that she didn't want a traditional diamond engagement ring--she wanted something unique and colorful. I eventually settled on an emerald setting in platinum with two smaller diamonds.<br /><br />As the years have gone on, we have talked about getting a pendant and earrings to match the engagement ring. I found a pendant for our tenth wedding anniversary, but earrings have eluded us--not just in design, but because we're more focused on saving for our child's college education than on buying jewelry.<br /><br />When I saw these earrings, I was stunned--they're a PERFECT match for the ring and pendant, looking almost like they were designed as part of a set with the ring--and are VERY affordable.<br /><br />She hasn't had frequent opportunities to wear these earrings, but she loves them. It's hard to believe, looking at the stones, that they aren't real emeralds and diamonds."
5.0,Love this anklet
5.0,Taller guy with wider shoulders and not shaped like a bowling ball. If you are shaped like a bowling ball with narrow shoulders do not buy
5.0,"I am 5'11"" and normally wear a medium, but I bought a large because I didn't want this to be too clingy. This dress is SUPER comfortable, the color is vibrant (I choose royal blue), the material is thick but not heavy, and its pockets don't obstruct the line of the dress. (Pockets!!!) I don't usually review items, but I DID want to say that this dress is very long. As I mentioned, I'm quite tall, and the large reaches my feet. It might be different had I ordered my usual size. Personally, I love the oversized fit and long length, but others may want to order true to size and keep in mind that this is *actually* a long dress. I am in love with it and will be ordering other colors immediately. ❤️"
5.0,Was purchased as a gift and she absolutely loved it. It was exactly what I expected!
5.0,"I got this for my Skagen watch. Got the 20mm size and that fits exactly, for a men's watch. I had to replace the original mesh band because the edge of the mesh became very sharp after bumping it and it started to damage my clothing.<br />I do recommend this product. And I do recommend to order the little tool for removing watch bands."
5.0,Awesome keychain. 3D effects. Not to big either. Would recommend
5.0,Nice variety of pinks….has a vintage vibe.
5.0,Ball is secure. Very cute. Nice quality and coloring.
5.0,great look.
5.0,All expectations were met.
5.0,"Wore this dress to my company’s Christmas party! I got compliments all night. My only complaint is that the string straps are a bit looser than i like but no issues throughout the night. I’m 5’5, about 180lbs and 36DD and i ordered a M. Could go smaller if you like a tighter fit!"
5.0,"Awesome hat!  Good Quality, great looking!!!"
5.0,Love them. Great fit and so comfy
5.0,The size and design of this scarf is perfect for many uses.  Large enough to provide good coverage or thickness when worn around the neck but also is good for tying to purse or using over the lap.  So many uses.
5.0,"I have been looking for a wristlet/wallet and the price on this one was appealing. The style was just right and the size is perfect.<br />The metal studs are a very nice touch. They are firmly attached and the color combination will go with just about all my outfits.<br /><br />This purse will work for date night, shopping and even to take to church. It holds all of my cards. The card slots are just the right width.<br />The center pouch (3 inches deep by 5.5 inches long) for my phone will only work if I take my phone out of its bulky case. I might buy a simple rubber case for when I use this purse. My phone has a 4 inch screen and has plenty of room.<br /><br />I can keep my hand sanitizer, travel bottle of advil, keys and chapstick in one side.  Compact, tissues and cough drops in the other.<br /><br />The pleather is very soft, and I think with a little care this bag should last a while. The stitching seems pretty strong. The wrist strap is plenty big enough for my hand (I have big hands and some straps are tight) and loop holding it is firmly sewn in place.  The zippers are metal and slide smoothly.<br /><br />I read several reviews about a bad odor coming from this purse. I was a bit worried because I am pretty sensitive to odors. My purse only has a slight smell which reminds me of the smell of new shoes from Payless:-). Must be the official pleather scent!<br /><br />The only drawback I can see if the lack of a change pocket. I might just keep the change floating freely, unless I can find a very small change purse that will fit without too much bulk.<br /><br />Even if this gives out in a few months, the price was right. I would buy this in different colors, if I could find it."
5.0,Shirt should come in more colors
5.0,These are the only joggers my son will wear.
5.0,Bought these for my niece.  She loves them.
5.0,"I love the shoes, quick shipping.  This is my 2nd pair and I use these for driving on the track.  Love them."
5.0,Nice everyday bag
5.0,Product looks just as shown. I’m about 105lbs and 5’3 and the small was a little restricting on my butt and breast. Other than that it’s a great costume!
5.0,GREAT AND CONFORTABLE
5.0,"This hat works great.  I use it mostly in the pool when I float on my raft, keeps sun out of my eyes & the hat's back doesn't get totally wet.i also wear it when I'm outside to take photos."
5.0,"It might be cheap but it's a keeper!  I don't normally like cheap clothing of any kind but this robe is the best!  I originally bought it for when my husband and I are in the spa and I need something to cover up with after getting out.  I didn't want to use a robe that I paid a lot of money for since the chlorine might damage it.<br />After owning this robe since 2014, and after many, many washes, I am back to order another one, only for backup.  I am still using the original one and it's in excellent condition! I decided I was tiered of the waist tie coming loose during the washing/drying routine so I decided to fasten the tie with a safety pin to the back part of the robe.  It has stay securely in place since.<br />TMI...  My husband likes this robe since it's significantly shorter than the other robes I own....  Bonus!<br />As far as the fit, I'm 165 lbs and 5'6&#34; tall and it fits perfectly."
5.0,nice track spikes

5.0,Magical!
5.0,Awesome product at an even better price!
5.0,This is an awesome mask. I work in education and need a quality mask to protect myself and others. This one is similar in quality as my other disposable masks and it doesn’t itch my nose AND I don’t feel guilty throwing them away after use. Will definitely be buying more soon!
5.0,Fast delivery great quality will purchase again
5.0,They were perfect for the wedding. Terrific quality for the price!
5.0,"had to hem it, because I am short, but I love it!!!!!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this top!! It fit as i hoped it would, and was very comfortable!"
5.0,Good eye glass holders
5.0,Bought these as a gift for my friend. She loves them so much she's not taken them out since she got them. She wears them all the time through showers and sleeping and we have not seen any degradation of the finish or shape.
5.0,Perfect for everyday or office wear
5.0,Fits great. I havent taken it out for a few holes yet but so far so good.
5.0,Love these pj joggers for my wife. She is 5 ft 9inches and 120 lbs. The small fit perfectly. We wash like normal and hang dry to avoid shrinking. They are her go to loungewear set for being home whether working or for a lazy weekend day with family.
5.0,My dad loved it!
5.0,"Only used it for 4month picture but fit baby well,super stretchy"
5.0,very comfortable ... forget you are wearing support stockings ..
5.0,sure hope my wife will love these Christmas morning
5.0,Hard to put on... Too narrow. Pretty rain boot though.
5.0,"Got this a few weeks ago and I love it. I have not taken it out since I got it besides to clean it but, it has not tarnished or changed color yet."
5.0,"Really loved the color options, and how it’s flowy(which makes it great for leggings)"
5.0,I love this. My son is 1 year and 5 months and it fits good and I'm sure will keep fiting up to at least 4 years. Best buy of 2021
5.0,my wife loved them!!
5.0,"Great shorts, great price"
5.0,"My watch is perfect, I arrive as I expected"
5.0,I like that it fit in the chest shoulders and waist and also the arm length was exactly what I needed
5.0,I was skeptical at first. Read the reviews and still took a chance and I'm glad I did. The material is soft and amazing. The dress fit perfectly....like a glove. Will purchase in other colors. :-)
5.0,I really love the way it fits and I like the color and style of the dress 👗
5.0,strong
5.0,Good buy. Just what they appeared to be!
5.0,Absolutely love this dress because it came in a nice cotton however if you choose some of the different colors it comes in the really cheap fabric so you have to be kind of careful I'm not exactly sure why the different colors came in different materials.  I ordered another dress from this link in black with flowers on the bottom and it came with shiny swimsuit type cheap material.  Yikes.  You have the description was the same for both I guess you just got to open and be surprised at what you get.
5.0,This pocketbook is large enough to hold a paperback book plus all your other necessities
5.0,They fit my wife perfectly. She's a size 7.5 and especially likes that they don't slide off when she takes off her shoes. Even after a dozen washes they stayed elastic and soft. For the price and amount of socks it can't be beat.
5.0,I love the colors and they are very comfortable around my wrist.
5.0,I brought one in Maui and said I need another one it was exactly like the one I have when I was there on vacation. good quality and exactly like the original one I brought in Hawaii
5.0,"These are the BEST gloves I have purchased.  I initially purchased in Black and loved them so much I ordered a second pair in khaki.  They are thin enough to still be able to function and handle items, yet the perfect warmth.  The text phone feature is amazing and works flawless as well.  They are extremely soft inside and have a very classy look to them as well.  Definitely recommend, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,Robe just like the picture. I wear a 18/20 or 2x. Robe fit great! Great buy!
5.0,"This watch is slim and fits very comfortably.  It's a nice throwback to a classic 80s style.  The button mapping is very simple to learn, and I picked up on how to use the watch in just a minute or so.  Many people comment on how much they love the watch and remember the good days of watches like it.<br /><br />My only complaint is in regards to setting the alarm.  I often do this once in bed and the lights are out.  However, the light button is the one that lets you change fields, thus making it impossible to set in the dark.  Just turn on a lamp and everything is fine. Not really a big deal.<br /><br />Alarm is nice and loud. Display is simple to read indoors and outdoors.  For the price it'd be hard to find a better watch."
5.0,Took me a second to figure it out but this works well once you get the trick.  I have a couple of bracelets that need to be smaller so the main ornaments stay on the top of my wrist and they are terrible to put on without this.
5.0,"I purchased one, and then came back to get two more and recommended them to my Mom. These masks are comfortable, I can wear them without fogging up my glasses HUGE PLUS!! And copper is naturally anti bacterial and anti microbial - also big plus. Super easy to wash and they air dry quick."
5.0,Hats are great and necklaces are so much fun!
5.0,"Fits as expected, and arrived sooner than the estimated shipping time."
5.0,Gift for my son - exactly as described.
5.0,Super sleek. A classic style that works with just about anything.
5.0,"I'm 5'2 240 and curvy,  got a xl  and it fit perfectly.  Stretchy and  nice fabric.  Going to order all colors"
5.0,"I really am pleased with these handles.  I bought both the black, and the brown bags years ago.  But, for some reason I only bought the black long handles in black.  Now I can carry my brown bag on my shoulder.  This makes me quite happy!!!"
5.0,"Fast delivery, good packing,absolutely beautiful hat. I wore it to my son's wedding last weekend and received so many compliments. It is a stunning hat and I am delighted with it."
5.0,"While it was a little smaller than I expected, it still fits nicely. I was expecting a bagger fit, but this is kinda tights. The material feels good on my skin and the look is very cute. I like it!"
5.0,Being between large and extra large makes purchasing dress hats that fit properly a problem.  This stretcher has solved that problem making slight adjustment to a comfortable fit easy to do.  The construction seems reliable with no plastic parts and a solid feel to the turnbuckle.
5.0,excellent!!! thanks!!!!
5.0,"This hat was very inexpensive. I bought it for the women's march in NYC. but it is a fabulous hat. very substantial, very warm, nice look. I will wear it well beyond the march."
5.0,The material is so super soft! My son is obsessed
5.0,Totally met my expectations Beautiful earrings small and thin not too thick they don’t look like the picture but then I didn’t think they would come there nice enough to wear to work totally appropriate
5.0,"I love Sumikko-Gurashi, and can't be more satisfied with this cute product. The colors are vivid while the charm itself, though small, is an excellent size to attach onto a phone or a zipper, and made with quality material, with a small bell attached. Looks better in person than in the picture."
5.0,"Good price, good size selection, good deal! I have one for every day of the week!"
5.0,My fiancee loved them and thought they were beautiful.
5.0,"I needed some more of these shirts for running, gym, and just generally to wear around the house. The material is lightweight and would dry very quickly. There is nice stretch to them.<br /><br />I'm 6'1, 175 with a 32/33 inch waist. I bought a size L. The arms fit snug and are pretty nice. The mid section isn't skin tight, it's loose for working out. So unless you're absolutely ripped, these aren't what you're looking for if you want a compression shirt.<br /><br />That being said, good value for the 3 pack, they're a worthwhile purchase if you need this type of shirt."
5.0,Bought this as a gift my husband loved it
5.0,"I had seen a meme about not being able to see the haters through my love glasses. My Bible study group was studying loving our neighbors and I bought these for each woman. We donned our love glasses and brainstormed about how to love others when shopping, driving, on social media,... We still talk about them. Good quality for the price. You can't help but smile when wearing them."

They were surprised that it was ordered off Amazon!  I normally wear about a 16 and am 5'8.. I ordered a XXL and it's great length and fits like the picture!  Too Diva!
5.0,The socks came as advertised. I liked that they:<br /><br />- have the options of multiple colors<br />- have the ventilation towards the toes<br />- have the ribbing in the middle which feels like the sock is hugging your feet<br />- feel soft<br />- are comfortable on the feet<br /><br />I recommend this purchase!

5.0,Exactly what i purchased!
5.0,"Pulled the pants out of the plastic & was immediately afraid they were not going to fit!  Looked like they were made for a skinny child.  Decided to at least try to put them on and was amazed....they fit like a glove!  Very stretchy and comfortable.  Sleek-looking and figure-flattering.  Everyone asks where to get them.  These are dressy enough to wear to work with a nice belt and tailored shirt.  Very happy with my purchase for the price.  In case it matters, I bought a size small, I am 5'11"" and weigh 140.  Fairly lean I suppose."
5.0,"I'm use to buying fairly expensive dress shoes, so I didn't expect much from these. I was pleasantly surprised. They are super comfortable and look nice."

5.0,Does what I need it to. Makes mask easier to wear
5.0,I own several pairs of Von Zipper sunglasses and by far these are the coolest ones I have. The colors are perfect for a daily beach vibe state of mind and the fit is perfect. The clarity through the lenses is amazing due to the high quality that this company thrives on. I have sensitive eyes and no other sunglasses have ever helped filter the brightness for me like these have. I highly recommend this brand.
5.0,Great dress! Fabulous chic style.
5.0,They were just what I wanted but they were to small so I returned them and ordered the correct size. It hasn't arrived yet but I think it's close.
5.0,This is my second mini wallet but the first made with nylon.  It has a very nice feel to it.  I use them both.

5.0,nice!!
5.0,"Runs a bit small, but great. Bought as a gift and is great for Pusheen lovers. Women's size not Juniors. Glad this seller labeled correctly. Came new and sealed in a bag<br /><br />Thin sweater, not much for warmth but a fun and wearable item for a Pusheen lover."
5.0,Great fit. Great price. Awesome blue-purplish color.
5.0,"I am a woman's size medium, I ordered a LARGE, the shirt then fits me as a medium.  I am 5'4"" 36 D bust, the fit at the bustline is close but not snug in the LARGE (China size)  shirt.<br />Interesting detail, the shirt has an extra button sewn into a side seam.  The outer fabric is NOT what I call flannel, the inner lining is.  The pockets can not be closed with the button on the pocket flap, the button is sewn outside and there is no buttonhole."
5.0,Loved it I’m 5’9 236lbs I ordered an XL n it was perfect
5.0,"Great comfortable cover up! I liked the ivory so much that I went ahead and ordered it in caramel too. I liked the oversized fit, and it is very soft."
5.0,Casual with Sandler or dress it up with heals.  Love the color and style.
5.0,"... love the lightnings, but I would like to get one size down<br />on all 4 I'm interested in. Sadly, the Camo and the Lightnings<br />are out of stock; I hope they come back someday. 😏"
5.0,"Very pleased with this dress.  It fits well, easy to wear, comfortable and very cute.  I gave worn it twice and have had about a dozen people ask me where I purchased it.  I think several people will be getting one for Christmas.  Perfect Florida dress."
5.0,"The ABUN Gold Plated Heart Charms made in Sterling Silver is simple, beautiful and packs a big message.<br /><br />I got this charm for my wife to put on her bracelet. When it arrived, she was very touched and immediately added it to the bracelet.<br /><br />It's simply a heart, so the message is clear and it makes a great gift."
5.0,I bought these for my 10yo daughter.  She is average height and weight and they fit well.  She isn't experienced at putting on such items but did it without a snag so that is a plus.  I got the sand color and she was happy with that also.
5.0,Great sandals. Comfortable cute & good quality
5.0,They are fit small so order larger than you think.

5.0,"Our Dad passed away recently. I have been looking for some piece of jewelry to give my two sisters as a reminder that we are still together even though we are living in different states.  I couldn't afford overly expensive jewelry. Then I saw this!  The picture showed it as very dainty and pretty, but I certainly wasn't sure what it would actually look like in person. Well, it's beautiful...exactly what I wanted! My sisters were very touched when I gave it to them. I'm so glad I took the chance on this. I love wearing it!"
5.0,I loved the earrings but HATED the packaging. The earrings did not come how they look. All of the earrings and earring backs were separately and it was a pain putting all of the earrings and earring backs together.
5.0,"This is a warm but not too warm hat, it’s perfect for the baby in your life!"
5.0,These necklaces were exactly what I was expecting. They make perfect friendship necklaces. I gave the other half to my best friend and she absolutely loved it. Perfect present. They are also made with good quality materials. I see these necklaces lasting for a very long time. Thanks for a great product
5.0,"I like these sunglasses a lot. I feel like they look good on me. My gf isnt a huge fan but she only likes certain styles. They cover the face nicely and arent too big or wide. They dont hurt your nose or face and the texture is decent. Its built nicely and i dont think theyll break easily. Ive dropped them a few times and nothing major happened, just a few unavoidable scratches. Overall I am satisfied with these, worth it."
5.0,nice trinket. gets people to start a conversation
5.0,My daughter loves her tie !1
5.0,The product was just fine. I should have ordered a small instead of a medium and it’s a little big in the waist. I most certainly will get another pair!

5.0,Very comfy:) Not too big. I love them.
5.0,"Husband is a Bluetooth fan, this is his new favorite!"
5.0,Great glasses for the price. Fit nicely on my gigantic face but also look fine on my friends more reasonably sized head.  Could live without the different colored trim but that's a minor complaint.
5.0,Still running like a watch.  Keeps my watch wound.  It is completely silent.  I have never turned it off.  I leave it running even when I am wearing my watch.  Looks nice sitting on dresser.
5.0,IS PERFECT
5.0,Purchased for winery  work at. So far multiple people have asked about where I purchased. Many others want one
5.0,"Great fit. Not too long, not too short"
5.0,"Super comfy, breathable and cute! My child has never had an issue wearing these and is always excited to pick out her next design."
5.0,I love these glasses! I can view so many different things when I move them around. Very cony!
5.0,"Don’t judge the dogs, I rescue. 😂🤦🏼‍♀️<br />Online shopping is SO HARD for me. I have THICK thighs but a small waist. I am a 28(ish) in jeans - so I’m a shmedium in EVERYTHING. 🤦🏼‍♀️<br />But I bought a size medium AND I HAVE NEVER LOVED AN OUTFIT MORE!!<br />SO comfy & fits PERFECTLY! I’ll be wearing this 24/7 (ones my chunk Nike’s come in 😂)"
5.0,This is one of my favorite bags. I wish they made it large enough to carry a 13&#34; laptop inside a laptop sleeve.
5.0,This wallet is fantastic! It's great quality and unbelievably durable! Worth double the asking price!
5.0,My husband loved these. Lots of compliments.
5.0,"After having cataract surgery in 2019, I could finally see the TV without glasses but reading and close up work, which  had always been good (even into my 60s) was gone.  I bought these (bought 250) on the advice of an eye doctor and they are perfect!!"
5.0,These are great. Fit tight.
5.0,"The quality of the shirts are fantastic. I am taking a vacation with my husband and wanted matching shirt for fun and also to if separated to be able to track one another. These shirts are perfect, simple, and love the quality. Vendor was great and will order from them again."
5.0,Nice ring for the price . Looks great.
5.0,"Big and beautiful! Good quality too, it does flop over like some big  purses.  The longer strap is kinda awkward 😬, but it is removable.  The wallet is beautiful  however most of the card slots are to small to even hold license or Debit card. Not impressed with wallet AT ALL!"
5.0,This was a gift and the recipient was really surprised.  She said she loved it!
5.0,I bought these for my 9 year old niece as a gift. She loved them. They are better quality than I expected.
5.0,The end where the bracelet closes wasn't curved like it shows in the picture. The bracelet was extremely shiny and it was only missing one small rhinestone on the heart. I LOVE this bracelet and it came 20 days earlier than expected!
5.0,"Company contacted me and sent a replacement. Very nice customer service.<br /><br />These were nice and stayed on. But just as another review said, my toe poked through."
5.0,"Omg get them ! Amazing quality ( not thin) ! Amazing stretch! Most importantly, comfortable!! Just buy them ! If they produce more colors I’m getting them all !"
5.0,Great jersey for mountain biking.
5.0,It’s super cute! And reasonably priced!
5.0,they are all beautiful works of jewelry art and fit great. thank you so much. I love them a lot.
5.0,"They are actually warmer in the cold than my jeans.  They are very flattering.  My size fluctuates (8-10) between the Small and Medium.  I can fit the smalls, but a bit tight at times.  The mediums are soooo comfortable.  I have larger calves and have no problem with them pulling down while walking as some leggings tend to do.  Well worth the money.  The corduroy look makes them look like pants and not like leggings.  Front pockets are just for show, back pockets are usable.  Easy up, easy down."
5.0,Great offer and very quick delivery! Thank you
5.0,Love it! The color came exactly as pictured and has become my favorite shirt.
5.0,"I'm very picky about my underwear. To be honest, I feel like a lot of underwear rides up and gives me a wedgie for the entire day so I have to be really picky about which I purchased. These I was a little bit skeptical about because usually no show underwear just give me a wedgie. But these ones are amazing! Not only are they no show, they are just so soft. they're thick enough where you could tell their high quality but also breathable to wear when you're working out or going on a hike. I seriously love these underwear. If I was brave enough to add a photo of me wearing them I would but you will just have to take me for my word! The size fits as expected to other kinds of underwear."
5.0,"The pants are equal in quality to my $40 Nautica sleep pants. I love the shirt. It's thin and stretchy, doesn't strangle me as I move a lot in my sleep, I'd buy more of the shirts if I knew where to get them separately."
5.0,I thought this watch looked good online but it looks even better up close. The clip on the band was a little tricky putting together but I received immediate compliments on the first day I wore it. Very attractive timepiece.
5.0,My brother LOVED this...the screening is old timey and he thinks it is awesome!!
5.0,"These replacement bands are so pretty and colorful, so much nicer than the plain solid colored bands.  They were very easy to pop on and change out and very comfortable to wear.  Love them!"
5.0,"This looked quite different from the picture... It was heavier duty, and looked thicker. But, for a handmade item, it's gorgeous! I've had cheap cloak pins, but this is heavy steel and the pin is thin and sharp, without being a danger, and works great. If you're even looking this far into a cloak pin on Amazon, get this one."
5.0,"Dress was super cute, but just didn't see too flattering on my body type. What a shame--wish it would have worked out!<br />Good quality dress, though, and a beautiful color"
5.0,"If you look at the sizing guide, it makes sure that you get the right size.  The size will be bigger than what you expect it to be (for instance, if you are a medium usually, you might end up ordering an XL or XXL)."
5.0,I Love it! It is beautiful
5.0,I absolutely love this . I ordered two this one and one from another company. This one was amazing quality .<br />Other company’s arrived broken. So I’m going to see if this company sells something similar.
5.0,I love these glasses. I will definitely be buying more from this company. They fit wonderfully and fully block out the sun.
5.0,"good product, runs a little small"
5.0,nothing special in design
5.0,Love it! Washes and wears well. Made nicely.
5.0,Wore them for homecoming
5.0,These are the cutest socks. They fit my teenagers feet perfectly. Brightly colored with an amazing assortment of designs. I bought these as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loved them.  Very well made and soft and comfortable. They have washed and dried perfectly.  Would definitely purchase again.
5.0,"Socks were for my granddaughter they are great, good fit. My only issue was the delivery. I received very quickly driver dropped them over fence at my home my door was open listening for delivery. Driver did not even honk my dog attacked the box ripped a corner no damage was done to your product. But why not at least honk makes me worry about deliveries closer to holidays."
5.0,"This is a very nice bag.  It is a good size for my needs.  It allows me to distribute my somewhat heavy items in a manner, which makes them less of a burden to carry.  The color pleases me.  It fits with many of my outfits.  I do wish that the handles on it would allow me to shorten them a few inches more.  At my 5' 2&#34; this would allow me to carry the bag more comfortably near my waistline."
5.0,This is a great cover up! I ordered this for my daughter to wear during Spring Break. The colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect. The fit is true to size.
5.0,"Perfect, just what I wanted."
5.0,This looks like a dress that I would have worn in the 50s. I added Bobbi socks and saddle shoes. I enjoyed this outfit for a 50s dance. No poodle skirt for me. I didn't have one.
5.0,Hermosa!
5.0,"The product is comfortable, snug, and supportive. My husband  loves them.  Thank you!"
5.0,gift for daughter in law and she loved them
5.0,"Love it! Material is very stretchy, but I suggest sizing up."

5.0,Totally love it! Looks great with the watch . Easy to adjust
5.0,I purchased as a gift for my 5 yr old daughter she loves it
5.0,"Fit perfectly except the hat was small, good quality"
5.0,"I just bought 2 of these last week for an upcoming vegas trip. I always spend my winnings and I wanted to come home with $$ this time. I watched all the you tube videos and read all the reviews. The highest number of bills inserted was 11, which is why I purchased 2. (Yes, I am being ambitious). I was a bit confused by the instructions on the last step when the lightbulb went off. After folding in 3rds, you then fold it in half from top to bottom. This creates a pocket for the subsequent bills to go into. I had my mother test this out with single bills and she was able to get 20 in with no problem. This morning, I tested double billls and was able to get 30 in. Then I went all out and did 3 at a time. I was able to fit 36 bills into this bad boy! (Pics are of the triple bills).<br /><br />I would suggest practicing at home to see how many you can do, so that when you hit the casino, you'll be confident that you'll come back a winner.<br /><br />Here's to hoping I can bring both banks back full of 72 100 dollar bills!!<br /><br />Great product! Highly recommended!"
5.0,This has become my favorite top! I’m really pleased with the fit and the quality.
5.0,"I have been on the search for the perfect purse for a very long time. I have tried so many different purses, and every one I use is either too small or is a trap resulting in lost items. This purse is finally the correct purse. It has two pockets on the outside that are perfect for holding a phone and anything small you don’t want to lose inside your purse. The inside is roomy and nothing gets lost. The lining stays in place and doesn’t hide things. There is another pocket on the inside as well that I personally use for things that I don’t use very often. The  purse itself is light weight and easy to clean. It is surprisingly roomy enough to fit everything I need and still has room for my crystals. The strap is comfortable and adjustable. It fits over my 2X body and comfortably hangs in a reasonable place (not always the case with other purses.) I love it! 100% satisfied."
5.0,Love these belts. I now have three. This one had a new material for the belt strap and it is even nicer than the brown and black one I ordered months ago. I highly recommend!
5.0,Very pretty big pearls
5.0,Reminds me of RB clubmasters wood. Except they are better fitting.
5.0,"The que bibs are our favorites. They fit our now 8mos old the best because the silicone that goes around his neck is shaped better than the other silicone bibs we have, making it stay in place better and seeming to be more comfortable for baby. Our baby has terrible reflux, still spitting up all day long and wears a bib all day, so we use these more than most- love this bib. And it’s super cute too!"
5.0,Why pay $200 when you can get almost the same thing for $30. Can't be happier.
5.0,The necklace is dainty and beautiful!
5.0,LOVE this top!!!!!!!  my co-workers admire it!
5.0,"These eyeglass straps are super easy to put on and fit all the different glasses we have. Once on they are super easy to adjust. We use them for sailing and windsurfing and regardless of how many times we end up in the water, they hold your glasses securely and safely to your head. Overall, you will wish you had got them soon and wish you ordered extras for other people! Definitely recommend this product!"
5.0,Great quality!  My daughter's teacher loved it!
5.0,This skirt is so beautiful and easy to wear.  Very very long but some heels will fix that.
5.0,"Really pretty romper! It is thick, almost jean like material, but absolutely beautiful"
5.0,"Just like the one I had back in the 90s: it just plain works and does everything I need. Be aware the bands are not overly long.  My wrists aren't super thick, but I'm on the last hole."
5.0,Perfect. Soft
5.0,"Soft, comfortable, flattering, dress up or down, wash and then slightly dry before hanging.  :--)))"
5.0,It is soooo cute!  I am actually a 2X  and I was hoping it would be stretchy!  It was!
5.0,Excellent coverage and fit. Espicially like the helmet liner.
5.0,So cute and solid. Looks and feels more expensive than the price.
5.0,"Very pleased with these pants. They fit just as they should, roomy as fuuuuuug. Super comfy, and the splash of color on the left leg is a great contrast against the black."
5.0,"Love this light, I bought 5 as a gift, then bought 8 more so everyone I run could have one to  wears, We run @ 4:30  you can see the light from a good distance away, Its great we all know where each other are.."
5.0,Shipping was quick and the item was nice.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:ce47dd3891c5ca2782e9911492430958]] These sunglasses came packaged with a cleaning cloth and a hard sided case. They feel very light on your face. They look so expensive and well made. If you're looking for a great pair without an expensive price tag - these are for you!
5.0,Perfect wrist bands that I use to put around beverage glasses.
5.0,"True to color. Roomier than expected. Very elegant, great for any dress up event."
5.0,"These are just the coolest looking earrings - Winchester!  They are well-made, sturdy, secure backing.  The blue stone in the middle adds a little color to the silver, and they are SUPER fun to wear!  I did first buy a pair of the plain silver ones, and liked them so much that right away I ordered these with the blue stone in the center.  Extremely pleased with this purchase!!"
5.0,These arrived very quickly and are actually much cuter in person than I was expecting. Very happy.
5.0,"excellent service, I am very happy with my purchase"
5.0,Bought this for a Christmas gift. Great sound. Keeps my son’s head warm and has a nice sound.
5.0,They're perfect
5.0,A bit awkward to get on. If you have small nipples I would not recommend. Since mine are longer they work well once I get them on.
5.0,"Having an olive skin tone, I purchased the blue and green tie dye dress in size small. For reference, I am 5'7 125 lbs 34D, 26 waist. This dress is absolutely adorable! It isn't clingy on my belly that homed 3 babies, nor too baggy, has a just right flow to it. I usually have issues with length on above the knee dresses, I have very long legs. The length of this dress is perfect, even suitable for work."
5.0,Love the shirts. Need to start making long sleeve tall and I will buy more.
5.0,"This blouse is beautiful, comfortable, and fresh."
5.0,"This dress is fabulous. It was perfect for a spring wedding. Amazon actually sent me the wrong size by mistake, a large instead of an XL, but it fit perfectly. I received many compliments at the wedding. The cotton stretch material was very comfortable. I think the sheer panel at the bottom really added something extra to the dress, I was so pleased with it."
5.0,Super cute. Comfortable. Totally worth buying I bought two sets so my 10 ear piercings could match n I love them.
5.0,So adorable! The pink is very shiny. Baby girl received a lot of compliments as an accessory with her Easter dress
5.0,This shirt is very comfortable and flattering.Win-win!
5.0,"It's comfortable to wear, but the shoe size is not very suitable. I usually wear 7.5, but the size is only size 7 and size 8, size 7 is too short, and size 8 is too long. Most boots don't have half size. The cortex will not be too hard, it won't make my feet feel pain, and the anti-slip degree is average."
5.0,Arrived on time & as expected. Cute Ornament!
5.0,Great bracelet!  I liked it so much for a gift that I bought one for myself.  You'll love it!
5.0,"This necklace is beautiful. It’s so sparkly and seems to be well made, which is especially impressive at such a great price."
5.0,"Very fashionable and the flexibility is perfect.  Perfect for travel, serves as two pairs of shoes."
5.0,Comes just as pictured and is durable. We aren’t allowed to wear a large dot as it can be confused with LTC rank from a distance. This fits our standards perfectly.
5.0,Love this shoe!!!! Wore it all night dancing and standing for hours.
5.0,Love it nice size
5.0,This is my second one. First one lasted over a year with daily use!! Get lots of compliments on it and inquires on where to get one.

5.0,.fast shipping exact size.
5.0,Love it. It is perfect and as expected.
5.0,"Bought this for my wife.  When it arrived, I checked it out with a 20x loupe.  The details are amazing, considering the small size.  Tried to scratch the surface with my thumb nail and nothing came off.  Should last a long time."
5.0,It is very comfortable and I enjoy wearing it.
5.0,Very pretty and nice looking
5.0,I use them as onion goggles and they work 100%!

5.0,"Beautiful, looks exactly like the picture"
5.0,"This brand is a very nice quality for the price.  I have tried several available on Amazon and was very disappointed.  This is very soft, the colors are nice without being obnoxiously vibrant.  It flows and fits well."
5.0,I love so much  I love bts and Yoon-gi  so they are so cute
5.0,"I ordered this bathing suit because I am a size 16 (and not an Ashley Graham size 16...I'm 52 years old, am 5' 5&#34; tall, and weigh 180 pounds). I love the sun and like to have a bikini that I can wear. What I liked when I saw this suit was that it had a bottom that covers your belly button, which for me means it covers my stretch marks! I ordered a size 4X and it fits perfectly. The cups fit (I generally wear a 42C size bra) and unlike some other bikini tops I've gotten in the past, this top does not have a buckle around the band. It ties there and around the neck, so it is fully customizable. As for the bottoms, they are great. There is a lot of tummy control and the front is rouched. You can have the bottom well above your belly button, or wear it lower. It's your choice! (I have included photos below...as you can see, the suit can just about become a one piece!) The suit seems to be well sewn and is the same material as other suits I own, so I don't expect any issues with it stretching out when you go into the water. I'm very happy with this suit and recommend that you follow the size chart for your measurements. I received this suit at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and as I said, I'm glad I got this suit! If this review is helpful to you, please click the &#34;yes&#34; button!"
5.0,Well made and cute.  My daughter in law has size 5 feet and they still work for her.  She loves them!
5.0,This item was bought as a birthday gift.<br />Quality product!
5.0,I'm a grown woman and ordered it for a pinup costume as I wanted it to be a little undersized so it would perch on the crown of my head - totally perfect!
5.0,True statement earrings! Well made and pretty. Exact color match as the brand ones.
5.0,Love it and really cute!
5.0,"It was a gift so I’m not sure on comfort or warmth. I do say the print was vibrant and detailed and by the feel of it, it does the job of keeping the germs out. Good quality."
5.0,These are the best no show socks I've purchased. They don't slip because of the double silicone strips near the heel and they're definitely as no show as is possible.
5.0,They are nice they fit perfect on my leather vest and look great as well.
5.0,"These earrings are so cute and very comfortable.  I wear them almost every day,"
5.0,"It was tough getting Into but once I was in it was secure and snug and made my outfit look so much better. I purchased an xl before reading reviews. It fit snug which I like but going up one size may have been a little easier to get on. I am 5’6, Aprox 260lbs. The lace elastic on the thigh was great and didn’t roll up at all"
5.0,My daughter love this dress. Material is warm enough for fall weather. Fits good a long too.
5.0,I brought this item as a gift for my boss.  When i gave it to him he was really shocked and he loved it.
5.0,Great product been using for years...
5.0,Love my new beanie.
5.0,A perfect fit! And it looks great. I love the touches to the mask. Be warned- the eyes are sunglasses so they might be a bit dark for night time use. I love the attention to detail though!
5.0,Nice material and very stretchy
5.0,"This is cute - I like the material. However, maybe my son just has a big head. He is 6 and this was very tight. I would say this would work for toddlers or older kids with smaller heads. I do like the stretchy material and it is cute but the sizing just didn't work for us."
5.0,Perfect for layering.
5.0,A perfect gift for a new grandmother (GiGi). Good quality and reasonably priced.
5.0,"Very pleased with the product of these earrings! They are not too heavy. They are much prettier in person! Very on-trend & I plan on buying more for Birthday, Teacher & Christmas gifts!"
5.0,Great packaging. Some of the charms are real small didn’t realize when I purchased them but I’m making them work.
5.0,ARRIVED ON TIME. EASY TO INSTALL. LOOKS LIKE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT
5.0,Love! Although the fabric is not what i expected and the color is more of a dark grey than black...I love these! So comfy and cool for a hot summer day.
5.0,These are exactly what I wanted
5.0,not bad at all
5.0,I love this short! Quality is excellent and fit me perfectly! I think of buying another one in darker color. I wish the belt was a bit longer but for this price I am extremely satisfied and have been wearing it every day! :) thank you for your bisiness 🤍
5.0,Cute and goes with any top
5.0,"Bands are exact size and colors! This is my 5th purchase, and I bought 3 this time!! Absolutely love my bands!! Thank you!!"
5.0,"Good quality for the price! Purchased for personal use during fomal events. Come in different colors which fits different colors of shirts, ties or jackets.  !"
5.0,"Trust me, this is worth more than anything"
5.0,"Perfect Snug fit, padded in the right areas, vented well, and just plain comfy.  Its like angels wings are lovingly caressing and supporting your feet. No idea how they hold up over time.  They seem way too affordable to last very long, but here's hoping! Will update in time."
5.0,Great product and price! used all 7 in 5 min and all styles and sizes fit ferfect.
5.0,Bought this for a friend while telling her we were pregnant! She loved it. It’s super cute and very soft.

5.0,I really like this product.  It is lightweight and very easy to wear. And it does seem to makd life a little more tolerable.
5.0,"Thick and nice material, warm too."
5.0,"This ring is beautiful! It's super real looking. No one can tell the difference unless they look too closely. I picked this one because it's closest to my actual ring, so it's great for vacation or if you're getting yours resized or cleaned. I'm a true 6, and with some of the other rings on amazon the 6 was wayyyy too tight. So I ordered both the 6 and 6.5 (I love that they actually have half sizes) but I'll be returning the 6.5 because the 6 fits absolutely perfectly. If you're looking for an alternative or vacation ring, don't hesitate. I ordered the rose gold with the 8 mm (2 ct) center stone."
5.0,Beautiful and very good quality
5.0,"My daughter is 5 years old and obsessed with emergency animal care. She wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up. She spends hours playing surgery, so I thought this would be a hit for her birthday party. She was over the moon! I like that it came with both a surgical cap and a mask. It makes her feel more like a surgeon than a nurse. I bought some disposable gloves and she uses chopsticks and a playdough knife to pretend to do surgery. Wonderful product. Great quality. She is a size 5-6 and this fits her well with some room to grow."
5.0,"Ordered the cat ears and it looks just like the picture. Arrived with 1 of the large crystals detached.<br /><br />After wearing it for 30 min, I started getting a headache bc the metal ends put a lot of pressure on the sides of my head. On the other hand, I could even wear it on a roller coaster and have no worries about it slipping off (not that I recommend doing that). For the price, I'm definitely buying another"
5.0,Sexy! 5'3&#34; & 90.7 kg
5.0,"Received the socks today, I’m so surprised with the exquisite packaging when I opened the package, the hand feeling is soft and comfortable, it’s good for Christmas gift."
5.0,"Perfect, get the job done."
5.0,"Looked great,very vibrant colors love it"
5.0,Nice ring fits just right a size 6
5.0,"A great little silicone Wedding Ring for active people!<br /><br />I have been trying out different silicone rings to wear while I do things with my hands outside. I am always operating chainsaws or other dangerous machinery and I want to be sure that my ring does not get caught in anything.<br /><br />The worst I have seen is someone getting degloved wearing a normal wedding ring. I know no longer have to worry with this silicone ring.<br /><br />This ring is nice and thin, it fits well and feels good on my finger.<br /><br />I no longer have to worry about my ring getting caught and losing a finger. The blue color of the ring looks really nice and goes good with my color eyes. My fiance loves the ring and she feels like I am safer wearing it, and can still show my commitment.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review."
5.0,invaluable.
5.0,"My favorite tunic purchase to date by far! Soft, good quality and figure flattering!"

5.0,Comfortable and good quality!
5.0,I love this coat!
5.0,My boy loves it.No problems.
5.0,Got it in this morning and just now tried it on. Got a size bigger than I normally wear and I usually wear a medium and got a large. Tad bit big on me but that’s fine still a very cute dress but ABSOLUTELY NO POCKETS!!! Was hoping this dress had pockets!
5.0,Beautiful fit!
5.0,loved how it looked on me! so comfortable and sassy
5.0,It’s awesome my son loves it
5.0,Love these dainty earnings!
5.0,Husbands loves it.
5.0,I wear these for work. I’m on my feet for easily 14 hours and these greatly cut down on my feet/ankles swelling. I can tell a difference when I don’t wear them. Recommend.
5.0,Love love love this beautiful dove brooch!! It was on time and in great condition. It has a cute green gem for the eye and gold finish. This is one of my favorite pins!!
5.0,"ADORE this wrap skirt. At first I was confused on how to wrap it. There are spots for running the string through. Skirt is long enough for tall people (I’m 5’11). Only complaint: there is a slip under the skirt. Purpose is to prevent it from being see through; which is excellent so you don’t have to worry about your undergarments. However, the slip is not sewn in properly on the sides causing it to show as you walk. Fixed that by stitching it in. Quick fix. Wore this for a brunch outing and sisters baby shower. Received so many compliments"
5.0,Searched 2 years for Aaron Roger socks and these were exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,My Queen loved them
5.0,50 miles in the Weminuche Wilderness and my hubby didn't have one blister! Washed in the river and they held up awesome!! Great product!
5.0,"The access down hoody from Black Diamond has all of the positives that make it a great jacket. The 700-fill goose down insulation filled across in between the vertical lines is prevalent from top to bottom including the pockets. The insulation is not skimped on the arms either. All of that provides the warmth in 25 - 60 degrees weather with wearing only a T-shirt underneath. Next is the design. The look is pleasing with Elastic cuffs and hood opening, along with zippered hand pockets and zippered chest pocket. The hood is large enough to fit over a hat or a helmet, with no cinch cord. The insulated hand warmer side pockets are deep enough for cold hands or secure essential items. Even though, listed as regular, it's form fitting but not too tight or constraining. Size is as described using the measurements on Amazon. Very light weight, similar to Mountain Hardwear jacket, but looks much nicer and has better overall insulation, look, and feel. The durable waterproof repellent (DWR) is good when encountering rain. For the price of $259.00, equal to competition from Arcteryx, Mountain Hardwear, Patagonia, and others. Depending on weather conditions, it can be used as a mid layer or top layer jacket.<br /><br />As for the seller, Outland USA: With prime shipping, the delivery was received within 2 days. The seller took the time to ensure the jacket came in a box and not a sealable envelope to eliminate the possibility of damage or tears. I visited the reviews section of the seller prior to purchasing and was pleased. I will definitely buy from them again.<br /><br />I've written this review since I didn't see any about this particular jacket on Amazon."
5.0,Excelent gift!!
5.0,"Cutest Boots I've Ever Owned.  I've worn them twice and both times I got tons of compliments on them.  They look great with skirts.  I can't wait to wear them with a pair of leggings, button down and blazer.  I high recommend these boots.  The fit is great and they are very comfortable."

5.0,Great Price
5.0,Has short distant range.
5.0,"I just bought this pack of bandanas to wear on walks with the dog for an extra layer of protection and I love them. The colors are bright (not faded like some), the bandanas are a perfect size for wearing around your neck/head and they wash really well. Delivery was quick and packaging was great. Thanks!"
5.0,Great quality and color
5.0,Finally found running shorts that fit perfectly. They are lightweight and don’t “ride up”. I love them. Purchased 5 overall and they’re soft and comfortable. I wear them everyday.
5.0,Love these bows!! They are a little loose on the two girls heads but not enough to where we have to constantly fix them. The girls are only 4 months old and these are the first bows that are not too tight or loose. The colors are AMAZING!
5.0,"This skirt is so pretty! Pretty good quality for the price, it will be perfect for some couple pictures coming up.<br /><br />Fit is good, it has some stretch to it so don’t be too worried about it!"

5.0,Bought as a goofy gift for nephew. He actually wears them and says they're very comfortable.
5.0,This cutie is so sleek. Love it.
5.0,"Very happy! Bought this for a camo themed day and my daughter will wear nothing but tutu dresses right now. I’d say the fit is a little roomy but overall true to size, she’s also pretty lean so take that into consideration, 30 lb and 37-38 inches tall, bought 3T."
5.0,"Muy lindo , me encanto"
5.0,Fits perfectly. I'm 6' tall and I'm surprised the length was perfect
5.0,"This necklace with this black pearl on it is beautiful. I know my granddaughter will be so happy at Christmas. I tell you it is so pretty I almost want to keep it for myself but, I am a good grandma. I will be back to purchase more."

5.0,Looked great on my grandson
5.0,"This is the best kigurumi that you can get. It's comfortable, adorable, and very well made as expected from the original company. I highly recommend to not buy a counterfeit and save up the money to get the TRUE kigurumi. The quality is real and the expectations were met 100% Well done! I will now be forever wearing mine."
5.0,The sturdy and beauty of the product I would refer this item to my friends. It’s my birth stone also thanks .Maryann
5.0,Product looks like the image provided. I can't wait for the summer to come back so I can wear this.
5.0,"I've been crafting for a while and have been crafting several pieces, I have been looking for more varieties of flowers such as on these sunglasses. I like  the fact the flowers have been screwed on , when I've made them I have used glue which I like as well. As far as these sunglasses, I have really long thick hair and when I was wearing these sunglasses if I wear my hair down which I normal, my hair literally gets stuck in each one of the flowers , to the point where it's too painful to pull out. I absolutely love these sunglasses, absolutely my style and are adorable, the full all black color. I have to be honest  I love these sunglasses but I don't appreciate them break so easily, I did not break them lets get that straight, like I mentioned the flowers were screwed on & I think maybe if after they were each screwed in they could have a touch of glue to provide a little more protection. The screws needed to be screwed in as tight as they could be yet they weren't or they just came I loose that easily. There's no need for them to come unscrewed bc I want to be able to wear them without a flowers coming out each day. Honestly at times I don't even know what happened at times I would go to wear the glasses and another flowers would be gone, I constantly re screwed and tightened each flowers screws many times, eventually all the flowers fell off to where I eventually did not want to wear them anymore and retired them, I kept them to fix myself sometime & after having them in a draw I went to add to them one random day and a lease had popped out and I have no idea how. So that's my good and bad, great price for these sunglasses though!"
5.0,"Love this sunglasses! They are super cute and the lens are dark enough, diffenitly does it's job blocking the sun(wasn't really expecting them to)"
5.0,"Very beautiful set, came as pictured in a plastic bag which was placed inside a black velour drawstring bag. The earring backs are nice clear wide disks. Very recommended."
5.0,"I love this skirt! Fhe fact that it wraps around makes it so you can fit it directly to you. This helped a lot because I didn't know what size to buy. Once I put it on, I fell in love with it! I am 5'4&#34; and 128 lbs and I got a medium, but like I said, because it's a wrap around, most sizes should work!"
5.0,Off shoulder shirt: fits a little loose around the shoulders. Fits perfectly around the thighs so as to not cut off circulation like many bodysuits
5.0,I just really love this bracelet … It’s so patriotic and like what it stands for !!
5.0,Great style great brand
5.0,"The snap closures are easy to open - and close with a positive click - but due to the curved design feel like they won't accidentally get opened. Nice smooth finish, with no rough spots. The color is low key and isn't in your face like the shiny steel colored ones. I like it a lot!"
5.0,Very happy with this garment. Nice fit and comfortable.  Did I mention it looks so good.
5.0,These earrings are so light weight and cute.  I got a lot of compliments on them.  I love Christmas and love to wear Christmas earrings and give them as gifts

5.0,Love them..
5.0,I bought purse as a gift to myself and I love it. Great color and feel. It does not look cheap and I have gotten a lot of compliments.
5.0,I never used compression socks before so it was my first time and I liked these they’re very comfortable. And I have plus size legs. I think my calf is around 15 -16”.
5.0,This was just what I needed for a growing child.

5.0,Got this for my sister…she loves it! Fits just like she likes it to!

5.0,"Cute, great product for the price."
5.0,Adorable!!! Fit my newborn well!!
5.0,"Love this shirt. Wore it on date night with a pair of jeggings and cute sandals, so cute!"
5.0,Got this for my girlfriend as she is the Maid of Honor for her best friend's wedding. The Tank Top fits her nicely... I ordered a small and she is 5 foot 4 inches and 120 pounds and it fits her perfectly. Material is nice and fitted yet light weight which is perfect for her here in Florida. This shirt was perfect for her as she was announced as the Maid of honor after another girl failed to do her responsibilities to the bride with helping.... so it was a perfect way to rub it in her face....haha.<br />I purchased this item at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.
5.0,I honestly was not expecting much - and this is now my favorite. And it has pockets. The material is thick enough to make it flattering and the cut is right on point! I’m ordering it in every color. (This one was grey). Measurements ~ 39/29/39
5.0,beautiful for the price..perfect for my wedding accessories
5.0,"I love it, I love it!  My 15 year old is my &#34;fashion advisor&#34; and she loved this dress on me too.  Now that is saying something about this dress.  It is very soft and flows well.  I am a middle aged lady with curves and a few dimples, but this dress flatters me everywhere!  I am 5&#34; even, 38D and wear a size 10, so I ordered the Large.  The dress falls to about 1 1/2 inches above my knees, so it would be shorter on a long legged lady.  I washed it and just hung it to dry and it dry out very smoothly."
5.0,"fits fine, and looks just like the picture."
5.0,2nd time buying this nose ring and I will buy it again and again. Wore it to my wedding last year. I lost that one. Just got this one to replace it and its just as perfect as I remembered.
5.0,Good shirt..not cheap material
5.0,I bought this for my wife in a small. She is 36 25 35.<br />It fits her very nice. It does hug her curves but not to tight. It looks beautiful.<br />She has also purchased dresses from this seller. The dresses were also a hit.
5.0,These are so easy to use and the titanium is lightweight. No more splitting your fingernails or having to use a knife or a screwdriver pry open the split rings. I never buy a different kind of split ring again.
5.0,It is adorable and better than expected.
5.0,Great fit. Good design and quite a good value. Price amazing!
5.0,"This was a gift for my mother in law, not always the easiest to please... she loved these pajamas!!!"
5.0,"Super soft panty.  Stays in place and does not cut into your sides.  The laser cut doesn’t roll up anywhere and stays in place.  Didn’t experience any wedges or riding up.  Love the design and the style.  Great material, plenty of stretch, stays in place, and looks great. Came on time and without issues, well packaged item.  Will be buying more from this seller."
5.0,It keep you warm in every day activities
5.0,"I absolutely love this leggings. They are not see thru, the compression is perfect, not too tight or too lose. The fabric is kinda warm (?) So I'll be using them a lot this fall/winter."
5.0,"Very pleased with my purchase, wasn't expecting much due to the lack of pictures. What you see in the picture is what you're getting, nothing cheap or sketchy."
5.0,"This skirt is beautiful. I'm 5'11, 200+lbs and I ordered a 2XL and it fit me perfect. The length was still long and hit the floor, and I didn't have to squeeze in the skirt. This is my second skirt from this seller and I'm pleased with my purchases. I would recommend this beautiful skirt, especially for tall girls like me."
5.0,Very sturdy baseball cap.  Great value for the money.
5.0,I love these socks. I have purchased three pairs
5.0,Good fit and fast delivery - product as described

5.0,Love this bag. Plenty of space. Easy to carry. Great color
5.0,Awesome hat! Thank you so much!
5.0,"Is a beautifull dress, beautiful printing, very neat, a bit looser than I was waiting, but I am a petit, not a very good reference, so, i just loved it."
5.0,"I am very happy with this purchase, The necklace is a lot more realistic in my perspective then others i have seen on here and for a lot less money the only thing you should know is the chain on the necklace is more of a cheap light metal but i just replaced it with another chain and it looks awsome the necklace also came with a harry potter bracelet but im not sure if it will be the same for everyone i think the gifts are randomized not sure but if you ask me a great buy."
5.0,"Very, very fast shipping! Very soft. Looks just like the pic."
5.0,"Love these earrings. I was just going to wear them at Christmas time but they are so pretty, I wear them all during winter."
5.0,"Lovely on the finger, and the gold is the correct color.  The tiny crystals really catch your eye.  It's a substantial ring, but is comfortable to wear.  Looks very expensive!"
5.0,"I wish it came in more colors!!!! I love it! Quality fabric, color perfect, fit perfectly! I would buy it again in a heart beat!"
5.0,Loved the dress for the holidays
5.0,Absolutely love them. Fit fantastic and are reasonably well made.  I've bought 3 packs twice and can find no fault in them.
5.0,Excellent sunglasses. Fit perfect!
5.0,Love it! Soft and warm for chilly nights. Large bust so I usually purchase a large. Keep in mind I'm short so sleeves just a little long but I fold back for style. Fits pretty true to size.
5.0,These leggings are incredibly comfortable and super soft. They are a great quality material and they fit well. There are additional pockets in the tummy band that can hold your cards.  In addition the look with the sheer sections is very attractive while also keeping you cool. I would definately reccomend and would buy another pair in a different color.
5.0,"I absolutely love this artisan piece. I get so many compliments on it!!! This is my second one. The first one I wore daily for 3 years until I misplaced it. It’s durable, and beautiful.  Thank you Amazon"
5.0,I love the way it fit.
5.0,"I totally love the product, I had to buy it again and I hope I get a little present from the seller. I purchased 24 picture keyholders, so a gift to encourage....lol."
5.0,"I like this watch.  The band broke on the same watch, but I have had it for years, so I saw Amazon still carried them, the price is great!"
5.0,Simply but elegant. Vary pretty.
5.0,"These are beautiful.  They took 3+ weeks to get here, but are well worth the wait.  And the price is right!"
5.0,My 10 year old daughter loved it! Super soft and cozy!!
5.0,Absolutely love it it is a big jewelry and I absolutely like that it stands out<br />This ha sent fallen out on me yet ive been wearing it for about a week its doing fine
5.0,"The husband loves them, they keep his feet nice and toasty."
5.0,"So far, so good! I have a big head and couldn’t find a red hat in a store that fit and wasn’t ugly. This is red and pretty and—thanks to the adjustable thing inside the hat—it fits just fine. My only reservation so far is that it looks like inserting the chin strap might poke holes in the hat that could get bigger and eventually make the strap fall out."
5.0,I just received my bracelet today and I love it!!! Just the right size and its solid!!! Perfect!
5.0,"Five stars  IF you are going to play a hipster Disney princess for halloween, you need these. IF you need realistic convincing faux glasses, you may want to pass. They run a smidge on the big side.  However they served their purposes very well, and my &#34;Hipster Elsa&#34; still has them for fun.<br />(PS if your kiddo wants to also be Hipster Elsa next Halloween  during the edges with some silver glitter is a perfect touch. )"
5.0,The only thing I wear under dresses all summer long.
5.0,"The hat fits as advertised, it came in a box with plenty of room, not crushed at all. To make it look right, I had to flip the front brim down and starch it.  In doing that it created a minor amount  of creasing, but not too bad. I suspect that if it bothers you, it could probably be ironed."
5.0,The shirt is very good quality but has a more formal look than the casual style I was expecting. Not sure I would describe it as a Yoga Top Beach Shirt but that's my opinion.
5.0,The green dress is beautiful but it runs small so I am going to order te next size up. I absolutely love this dress though.
5.0,I got this to wear over leggings and I'm really happy with it. It's high quality and very soft. The color is very vibrant.  It will go great with my Little Mermaid leggings!
5.0,Great pair of everyday hoops. Sturdy and very lightweight. Love these! You can't beat this quality for the price!
5.0,works very good
5.0,It's so me!
5.0,"beautiful dress, just didn't fit my occasion. I bought in a small and medium and the small fit better, but again, did not match my occasion. Will consider this item in the future and definitely recommend!!"
5.0,"These socks are as described by the seller.  We ordered them because we wanted the safety of the tread while walking.  Also, we liked the fact they came in XL sizes which were comfortable for swollen feet."
5.0,"The dress was just right, long but perfect for me."
5.0,"Nice quality, good product description on sellers site"
5.0,I got this for my son for his Christmas Eve pajamas and they are awesome! He is 6’2 and about 220 pounds and the xl fit perfectly with plenty of room and they are super soft! Definitely recommend!
5.0,Perfect for physical therapy
5.0,"WOW! I'm impressed by the quality for under $40 for this ladies 2 pc work suit! It arrived super fast, first of all. It's fully lined and fits true to size! I stand about 5'6&#34; 120lbs and wear a US 2, sometimes a 4. I ordered size small. Totally worth every penny and more. I highly recommend this business suit! Totally stylish and cut well. It can stand up against any Tahari suit at Nordstrom!"
5.0,absolutely perfect!
5.0,This sweatshirt was purchased for my son who loves Curry. The sweatshirt overall is nice. My only complaint is the color was slightly faded upon delivery. Thought it would be of better quality and tried to color as advertised.
5.0,"Being into to Turtle Rescue, my wife loved it!  The colors are perfect for any outfit... so I'm told.  Thanks!"
5.0,Perfect for kids.
5.0,My granddaughter requested the Red Blanket very close to Christmas.  Not only did it come quickly but she was thrilled with it.  It felt so good getting a picture of her bed with it on & a big thank you grandma.
5.0,I wish there were more shapwear garments designed with such easy bathroom access. I am able to use either fixture without having to remove the bodysuit.<br /> The only problem I had with a previous purchase was with the arm opening and the shoulder strap. The arm hole would cut into my underarm and if I pulled it down it would cut into my shoulder. The XXL did not do this but it did not flatten my stomach as much. I guess that is the problem with having broad shoulders.
5.0,This dress is SO BEAUTIFUL!!  It fits perfectly.  I am 5’2 190lbs and it was in a great length.
5.0,My oldest love it
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, good quality!"
5.0,Ordered these for my Children's Church Christmas Performance. Thry arrived earlier then estimated.. which was awesome. Everyone loved them and I will definitely be ordering more for future events.
5.0,Fun mask. Adjustable straps. Silky feel. Makes having to wear a mask easier.
5.0,This is an amazing gift!!!
5.0,I used this coat during the cherry bloom festival.
5.0,It looks to be made really good. And is a great size
5.0,Never thought I would like crocs until I saw them in animal print. So cute and comfortable...
5.0,My man was super happy with the fit says he looks just like him when he puts it on! Winning!!
5.0,"This shirt looks exactly as it does in the photo. I was worried it wouldn't, but it does and it looks great! It's just what I was looking for, and I'm super happy about it. It feels pretty durable, and isn't scratchy at all."
5.0,I wear it while on my road bike for visibility and its perfect
5.0,"Great dress. Cam dress it up or leave as casual. Fit is perfect, hides the typical ""problem areas"" Can't wait to rock this dress in Vegas"
5.0,These earmuffs perform well and are well made.  The electronic amplification filters out harmful decibels but you can hear conversation around you.  I tested them this week for the first time and they worked great.
5.0,It looks good and arrived quickly.
5.0,"I liked the mask! It looked good and the cloth was good quality! The straps to adjust for size are a little big because I have a small face, but overall I like it! I recommend it!"
5.0,"beautiful pattern, good quality. not very thick!"
5.0,Super cute and flattering! Waistband is sexy with body suit
5.0,"Very nice skirt, fabric is medium weight and should be good for year round wear. Not too stiff and washes well. I accidentally purchased 2 but the skirt is so nice that I’m keeping both."
5.0,Good value! Fun colors
5.0,My son loves it he wears it a lot it’s worth the price I keep washing it. Thumbs up
5.0,"It is just as I expected. Quality seems nice so far, my only concern which I had a feeling from the start is it catching on things. I'd be careful for that, otherwise it's nice looking and fits pretty good in my ear at least."
5.0,"Great presentation, very comfy and kept my feet warm, my feet are always cold, in the office I have a heater under my desk just for my feet... I haven’t used the heater when I use the socks!"
5.0,"This is great for any person who appreciates -- and uses -- aromatherapy. Stylish and functional, this pendant comes with 3 colored diffuser pads: white, black and purple. Save them for future use! I chose to put in the purple; this may be why the color doesn't show up as drastic as I would have liked through the open areas. Regardless, this is a truly functional piece: just dab a bit of your favorite essential oil on a pad, slip it inside the locket and snap shut; it seals securely, and is close enough to your nose to breathe in consistently. This is also not a shabbily made piece of jewelry; I was pleasantly surprised to find the metal was quite thick, and didn't lack substance. i've worn this a couple days now and am looking forward to much more use."
5.0,Wore to a formal sweet 16 party. Posted pictures and received comments such as beautiful and stunning. It's a gorgeous dress.
5.0,"Product so nice, I bought 2, 1 as a gift glad i did.  Thank you"
5.0,Great set! I got lots of compliments at my wedding!
5.0,Nearly every thing I buy from Amazon is for my grandsons and he loved the bracelets.
5.0,"This little pin just makes me smile.  The colors are bright, shiny, and even more vivid in person.  I love the little bag it came in, too.  I added the eyeglasses to the picture to understand the size better.  It’s definitely small, but the perfect touch for the holiday season."
5.0,"Granddaughter looked awesome in this leo, now if she could just land her fly away.  Fit was perfect"
5.0,The product works great to keep my work goggles from fogging up while using in an isolation room as a RN caring for patients.  Because I have to clean and disinfect my googles after using in each room I do end up having to reapply the anti-fog spray.  Which is totally understandable.
5.0,The thw dress it was very pretty on and I would buy again.
5.0,Exactly as pictured and case quickly!
5.0,Fit is great and very comfortable.
5.0,"Great snowsuit and perfect for snow play - love the built-in mittens and foot coverings.  Bright and attractive fabric and styling, and warm and waterproof."
5.0,Really do love these and the weight is nice. Would love to get this with a longer chain.
5.0,"Lovely socks that have held up very well. What a genius idea! I've been mixing them up, Mars on one foot, Jupiter on the other!"
5.0,I love the material of this dress!  Very soft and my honey loves the way it fits to my curves!!...
5.0,This band fits nice and is very comfortable. I really like the hook method of closure.  Great cost.<br />I have it in orange and one in black now.
5.0,Larger than I first anticipated but I still love them!!
5.0,Loved it will buy again I. Another color
5.0,These are very thick and soft. The inside is actually fuzzy (not traditional fleece) more like a plush animal. The leggings are as pictured. They do run slim and long. The yellow leggings in the picture are Old Navy leggings size 5t for reference. They do have a center crotch gusset that’s runs front to back like most long underwear if that matters.
5.0,Great seller & I loved the product for my little flower girl!!
5.0,This is a great product
5.0,"My husband ordered these for me and they are great quality for a great price. Pretty true to size-- I am 5'8, 130 lbs and I got a medium. I usually fall between a medium and small, I'm glad I got the medium for some extra comfort. No digging, no rolling down, no stretching out. So far these are great and I will definitely order more."
5.0,"I am obsessed with this toP! They are even more amazing in person. Fit is great, beautiful suit. and SUPER fast shipping!!!"
5.0,"Bought one for my mother and my sister loved it so much that I bought one for her.  Very attractive and useful.  Look very, very nice for the price."
5.0,Beautiful Ring
5.0,my son loved them. great sizing and sturdy
5.0,it is exactly what I ordered
5.0,"I bought this dress for my sister with a great shape.  Even if she had some bumps to hide, this dress would if hid them.  So this dress in white defined her shaply curves and she wore the dress well.  Slightly see thru, but not too noticeable. I'm going to buy a few more colors to keep the closet just in case.  It's made with a  nice shiny but not shiny cheap material. Good buy for the money. It fits well just above the knees ans sexy enough."
5.0,These are a great copy of very popular sunglasses. I actually held these up to some name brand and these difference is minimal. I like the adjustable ear pieces.
5.0,"This is beautiful! However is very sheer, see thru. You must wear a slip underneath. It is very long. I cut off 2 ruffles and it still hits the floor. I am 5'2"" tall & weight 130 pounds.  It is white, but not a bright white. I bought an XL because others said it runs small & it does.  It probably is more of American medium size. Worth the 20 bucks."
5.0,I love how they look and feel. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Great fit<br />Comfy.<br />Glad I purchased it
5.0,"I bought this dress for my prom. The material is soft and catches the light beautifully, it's also breathable and I can move easily in the dress. I also have a wider body as well, so I was pleasantly surprised when it slimmed me down so well. Photos don't do it justice!"
5.0,I used it for a Christmas party.
5.0,I bought this coat for my 11 yrold daughter it fits her well it looks<br />really cute on her it's really cozy on the inside l wish it came in<br />more colors delivery was quick as well.
5.0,"I really love these socks! Normally I don't get excited about something like socks that are traditionally pretty boring and no one ever wants them as gifts! I chose the option with 'mini stripes'. I wear a size 13 shoe, and the socks fit perfectly. The thickness is just right, and the go on very easily. I thought about going with the casual assorted, as the colors looked really cool. I kind of wish I had gone ahead with the wild colors - it would be a small way for me to go crazy! Seriously though, I really like the socks. I do wish there were one or two more of the lighter colors, so I could wear them with my khakis. The socks come in a nice box, good enough to be given as a gift.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price in return for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"These are not cheaply made, sturdy beautiful earrings! So glad I purchased them."
5.0,"Perfect! Very well made, feels good in hand, can't believe how nice for the low low price."
5.0,I RECOMMEND THIS HAT FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES FASHION !
5.0,these were as I expected...the bigger ones were a bit gaudy...but the smaller ones are perfect<br /><br />thanks so much byee
5.0,"It's my ""work"" watch band, works very well with the watch and matches the color perfectly (including the metal buckles). It's not as comfortable as my rubber band, and I do wish the leather were a little softer. But it looks good. I like the color."
5.0,Very nice sweater for the money. Nice slightly oversized fit. NOT itchy
5.0,I bought these for my little nephew. I really love the design for him and also I've seen that he's comfortable wearing these.
5.0,"If anyone is looking for a Valentine gift for your partner, these are reasonably priced and very nice looking. Please put away your credit card to impress. Use this package. The earrings are very pretty and comfortable. You are facing paying for Christmas do not fall prey to try to impress. If your partner cannot get on board maybe it is not a good match."
5.0,Amazing pants - they fit great and seem to be good quality. Cool design too.
5.0,Perfect fit.  Ideal.
5.0,"This is an awesome watch. Completely submergible and automatic, so you don't need to worry about changing battery ever or take it out for swimming or taking a shower."
5.0,"I have had a pair of these gloves for years and they are excellent light glove that has good dexterity . They fit snug on the hand and are very comfortable  because they breathe well. So after quite a few years the coating on the fingers finally wore off but the fabric is still strong .  No doubt that I would replace these with the same kind and happy they are still available and for the price a great deal.  I use them for general work around my place - but if I was going to be doing heavy work for long periods of time I might get a glove more suited towards the protection and wear level that work demands . But just for building jobs, mechanic work, chores , etc these are excellent ."
5.0,Nice fit very comfortable I own 4 of them
5.0,"Love it! Fits great, nice color."
5.0,Awesome super fat delivery
5.0,my nephew will love this. too cool
5.0,Another great Kitty pin.
5.0,"love the shirt but do order 1 or 2(which is what I did) larger.  It runs really small, I am a little heavy up top though."
5.0,Stay on well. Good non slip sole. Comfy cozy.
5.0,"These are so pretty, and very high quality."
5.0,"I love these joggers! So happy I ordered them! I’m not one to leave a review but the reviews definitely helped me to decide to get these. I definitely agree to size up. Typically I would have order a medium but sized up because of other reviews and went for the large, and They fit loosely with out being bagging. Definitely think the medium would have been more tight like yoga pants."
5.0,Love this so much! I can wear it leading up to Halloween all the way through to thanksgiving. A must for your fall wardrobe!!
5.0,"I love this top so much. I wear flare jeans with these & whoa, it's 😍😍😍."
5.0,Love these Lands End nightgown.  Very comfortable!
5.0,"Beautiful blouse! I absolutely love it. It is made well and the lace is soft. Something to note is that you do need to purchase a separate tank to go under it. Fortunately, I found one that matched the cream/off white color of the lace as pictured. I was okay with that, since the blouse did originally retail for than I paid for it. I highly recommend."
5.0,very convenient
5.0,Gift for granddaughter she loved it suited her personality and interests
5.0,Got me laid
5.0,Good Coat
5.0,is what i ask for
5.0,Love the shirt and good good quality good price
5.0,Very nice love it.
5.0,"These are hilarious!  They are Hanes underwear, so fit and quality are exactly the same as any you would buy from Hanes.  The words have lasted through many washes.  No problems with service or delivery.  If you have a man with a sense of humor in your life, these are a great buy."
5.0,I bought this for my grandson and he loves it!  Wears it all the time...he’s at university.
5.0,"Quick delivery. Very light and flowy, and is satiny inside and out. I am 5'8&#34; size 10 and this fits perfectly. Very happy with purchase!"
5.0,Great quality! It fit perfectly and is so soft!
5.0,They have a bit of weight to them which I love! They look amazing and don’t fall off easily. They feel like a quality product!
5.0,Perfect light weight top. It's not a sweater which I like. Good value.
5.0,Not exactly right sizing for me even though I followed the chart but I believe that’s because my waist to hip ratio is higher than normal. There was no right size for me but I just picked the one that would fit. It was still too big around the waist. I gave the skirt to my mom and it fit her perfectly. She loves it! Very nice material and design.
5.0,I love love love this belt! Very stylish and very comfortable and very stylish. Goes good with a lot of dresses.
5.0,My granddaughter selected them but a little old for 6 year old but fun for dress up.
5.0,It took a little while to arrive but IT is a fantastic hat for the price!!!
5.0,"This is really close to a regular snorkel mask in size, but the benefit of it being UV coated and tinted makes a nice difference when you are in a pool environment. and also having your nose free to breathe when you come up is a nice change for anyone with water issues or anxiety over a traditional mask snorkel set up . This is also perfect for men with Moustaches! I have had such a problem trying to get my ex to shave in the summer so he could properly snorkel with the family.  He would wear tiny goggles/ nose and ear plugs and a snorkel... I get it it, but it wasnt very efficient. SO hey , If you really can't imagine yourself without a moustache, these are going to be great for you.<br /><br />I realize that the larger viewing surface is also good for finding what you are looking for underwater. I have reviewd another set and we absolutely love those... We just got back from the ocean and they are tinted and UV protected also but they are the smaller traditional swimmers goggles. They were grat to keep the ssaltwater out of our eyes and These [[ASIN:B019BSYLLA Feiupe FP-6200 New Men Women Super Big Frame No Press the Eye Swimming Goggle Swim Goggle Swim Mask-100% Highest Grade UV Protection and Anti-fog-- Competitive Racing and Recreational Swimming(Black)]] are no exception. These stay on and dont let a drop of water through. Come to think of it, they didnt fog up either.<br /><br />Like many goggles, if you have long hair the strap can get a little tangled up in there if you don't  put your hair up, but other than that these goggles didnt give me any issue in fresh or saltwater, Disclaimer. I am reviewing these in exchange for a free item or reduced cost.<br />Be sure to rinse and dry these off, they will last longer if they aren't left out."
5.0,5 stars.
5.0,Gorgeous!!!
5.0,I loved these pants the minute I put them on! I got the indigo marl and it looks exactly like the picture. There squat proof as well! Still kinda skeptical to do a leg day with them considering the tips that people have posted on the reviews but I’ll totally wear it for an upper body day! Going to order more bc there just so cute! True to size. I’m 5’6 135lb and I ordered a small.
5.0,Bought this as a gift it fits great not heavy and its true to size
5.0,Very well made! Comfortable! Will be buying more!
5.0,Great price and very closely resembles the look and quality of a Lululemon headband.
5.0,"Beautiful on, very stretchy not see thru, I'm 5'4 about 150 I usually get a medium because I need a larger bottom but I ordered a small and it fits perfect in length also I'm very happy with this purchase. In most of the spandex blends if your waistline is small you can order your size or down one the stretch gives you room and gets rid of that sag effect in the mid and butt area. Just a tip"
5.0,"The larger size is very nice size. (would probably not like the smaller size except for on small children) If you want a clean, simple, no dangle,  round stud like earring, this is it, but with an added touch of elegance from the sparkle and shine and bit more complexity of the design.  Very neat and unique appearance. Goes casual to dressy or anything in between. Nice variety of colors."
5.0,Bought XL and I usually wear a 12/14. Very nice and comfortable!
5.0,So sweet on my baby!
5.0,"The dress is made of thick cotton which gives it a real A-line look, and it is exactly what you see in the picture. It's not too short either; I'm 5ft7 and the medium size is all the way too my knees.<br />When the dress arrived the ribbon was missing, and I contacted the seller asking to return it. To my surprise she offered me a completely new dress allowing me to have two dresses now. Goes without a saying that I know at least a handful of other ladies that I could surprise with it! I would recommend this seller any day."
5.0,"This sweater is something you need in your life! I can not believe the price! The material is thick and warm and soo soft! You can dress this down or up, its my new favorite! True to size as well! WIN!"
5.0,They provide a great deal of compression but roll down at the top.
5.0,My 3.5 yo son loves these shoes!  Well made and fits great.
5.0,Cute and feels great. My daughter loves them.
5.0,"Great detail, hefty weight, comes with ticket of authenticity."
5.0,"They look good, perfect size and they have two looks: one like the picture and another with a cap on the sides. The color looks much brighter in the picture than the actual color"
5.0,Really like the sun glasses!
5.0,Bought these for my son & he loves them
5.0,My son loves it. Will buy one for my daughter too when she grow up a little more
5.0,Perfect fit & coverage for my 13 year old daughter. Went beautifully with our family pirate theme at our annual Halloween party!
5.0,Very nice.  Could not be happier.  The size is spot on.perfect.  the color of the drones match 2 other bracelets fantastic.  Glad I made this purchase.
5.0,"Easy ordering, great fitting."
5.0,"This was unfortunately not right for what I needed but I loved the pockets, super soft fabric and overall style.  Cotton lace gives this a nice lift from just a cotton sundress."
5.0,"this was a gift for my grandson, its also great for the pool in the summer . I,m a freak when it comes to material . this is good"
5.0,Really good classic watch
5.0,"Wore it during a trek at a seaside national park on a high velocity wind day. It cut the effects of the wind down to nothing. Stayed warm but didn't overheat. And the best part is that it's feather light in weight. Not sure how it will behave in the rain. Doesn't seem like it will keep you dry during a downpour but for sure during a drizzle or a light rain. Two nitpicks: no vents under the arms and it's super pricey. However, barring some catastrophe it has a timeless look and seems to be constructed to last forever. One other comment -  you might want to buy one size smaller. It's pretty roomy. You can get a lot of layers under it if you buy in your regular size."
5.0,"Quality and number of masks received for the $ Was surprising in a good way!<br />These are, most likely, going to be used for a party/Halloween or Mardi Gras and then lost/left behind, so I wanted something inexpensive but also comfortable and safe.  The masks are soft with very good tying ribbon attached. (Stays in place). The lace is intricate looking but not itchy<br />Pleasantly surprised"
5.0,Great fit and material. Same as the picture.
5.0,"This is my second one of this wallet.  The first one lasted 10 YEARS!!  While this one is missing a couple of the little pockets in the change area, I would purchase it again.  It comes in many colors."
5.0,Love this sweater!  It fits me perfectly and feels nice.
5.0,"These glasses fee really thick and sturdy for being all plastic! I get compliments all the time and always recommend them to my friends. The opacity is perfect and blocks just the right amount of sun while keeping stylish! I've found myself using them for a costume, night out, or day on the lake."
5.0,"Light and easy to place where you want, more than just a key chain. Hung this on my rear mirror with a ribbon, looks awesome!"
5.0,They work really good
5.0,Love this purse
5.0,"Ok. So I got these today, and boy was I dissapointed. They were sooo small. So small. I was afraid that I had purchased a childs XL, but I gave it a try anyway. Couldn't get my feet thru the footholes! But after some wriggling, they dit perfect! Ok, so they're on, but how see thru are they now? ....0%. Ok, but the waist band will probably roll down as soon as I sit down right? Nope. Love these. Exceeded expectations. Probably going to buy every print, one a paycheck!!"
5.0,I love the material....will update with a picture<br />5’4 235
5.0,"Very nice shirt just didn’t fit me, good quality"
5.0,wow
5.0,Size up.<br />These pants are hot and a hit!  I gave them to my lil sister.  The feel and the look are both luxurious!
5.0,used for a play. It looked very nice. Held up well. Seems well made.
5.0,Great fit as it has an internal band to make it fit exactly.
5.0,"I love this, especialky for the price!!"
5.0,Everything I'd hoped it would be. It's a great hat. Everything they said it would be.
5.0,These are superior to all others I’ve tried.
5.0,Perfect for the job site
5.0,Good value for the money. Sturdy glasses. Good fit and comfortable.
5.0,"Bought this for my friend for her birthday, and was really happy with the look and feel of the charm. It comes together and has to be broken apart. It is easy to do so, I dod not have any problems."
5.0,"Nice fit, doesn't Kling."
5.0,I LOVE IT.  I'M HAPPY THAT I PURCHASED TWO OF THEM.  A LOT OF PEOPLE  HAVE ASKED ME WHERE I PURCHASED THIS BEAUTIFUL BRACELET.  IT IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BRACELETS I'VE SEEN.  IT IS GOOD QUALITY.
5.0,Fit perfectly! Perfect for work and will take you straight to dinner. Comfy and cool.
5.0,Very nice shoe.
5.0,Super fast shipping for a clothing item and looks great.
5.0,"This is a very cute top. It was a little bit bigger than I expected, but I am okay with it fitting a bit loosely. I really like the bird pattern (I think that it might be crows). I plan on wearing this for summer and fall and then again next spring. It fits well with a sweater for cooler weather. The fabric is smooth and light. I would recommend washing in a laundry bag. The washing instructions say hang to dry which is wise. Very comfortable and versatile!!"
5.0,can't beat it for the price!
5.0,"Trendy, Fun, Protective. Everything you would want or need."
5.0,These are beautiful and a great deal for the price.
5.0,Looks good<br />Feels good<br />Chics dig it
5.0,This is too cute!
5.0,Items as described
5.0,These sunglasses are a fantastic choice for a very affordable price.
5.0,Such a beautiful dress for the price. Very cute. good quality and I think I will buy it again with different color :)
5.0,"Color and stretch are good. Very flattering and cute. I think I’ll keep this one. Only thing I don’t like the slit in the back. Too high up, will have to sew that up a bit."
5.0,Gorgeous dress.
5.0,"I'm 5'7, 125 lbs. and purchased this shirt in a size Small. It fit really well around the body but it does run just a little short. It hits right at the top of jeans or shorts and I wish it were just a little longer. The print colors are very nice and with a nude bra underneath, it's not very see-through. For the price, I feel like this top suited my needs just fine and it also washed well (I laid it flat to dry)."
5.0,"So the ONE thing you could consider with THIS face mask is that after all we’ve been through, with all the information that we try to measure and weigh in our heads, let’s consider a filter. Ok so there’s a virus out there, let’s protect ourselves and work hard on information for our Loved ones. A mask: Good, respectful to others.<br />Filters: protection before infiltration right?<br />Antimicrobial: AWESOME but costly.  For some.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS MASK! I feel secure with the nose wire, adjustable ear loops, chin guard, and filter pocket. Nicely made. Strong. Comfortable. It’s my favorite mask and my family only wears this one. Including my precious grandchildren. This is good material, it’s important to me to fill you with information about THIS mask because when I began my search it was very overwhelming. So this is what I’m going to say: the mask is great! The filter pocket is an added bonus, not all masks have filter pockets. It’s the best mask I found that satisfies MY CONCERNS for MY family. I may sound to you as a spokesperson for this mask , I’m not, I took pictures to show you clearly this mask. Some pictures don’t do products justice. You NEED to know what you’re buying I pray the pictures allow you to see clearly this mask. I do this for YOU because no one did it for me when my research on masks began in March. I have a box of masks. Masks from my neighbors, from family, other websites but I keep coming back to this one, in fact I just received an order yesterday and when I’m done here I’m going back to order another 4. I usually keep 8 for family who may need one because they misplaced theirs. I’m telling you you will not regret this purchase. Look at the pictures, study the mask, the material is GOOD, the stitching is strong. The filter pocket is strong and the filters? Well what can I say. Thank you for your time. God Bless you all and your families."
5.0,I ordered small and it fits just right not tight but fitted just like I was hoping. Material feels soft and smooth on you Skin and comfortable. It looks as it does in the pictures. I’m buying another one!
5.0,"It was as described. The charms were clear, cut well, and move freely on the ring. The ring itself is sturdy. Given as a 1/2 year nursing graduation gift and it was loved!"
5.0,"Nice lightweight, great color"
5.0,"Thick, exactly what’s pictured. Color and all. I loved them."
5.0,Super comfortable and easy to stack
5.0,Good quality material. Well sewn. Nice comfortable fit. Very pleased with this purchase. Item was as described. Good seller. Item arrived ahead of schedule too.
5.0,Very nice lenses. I will buy more and recommend it to my friends.
5.0,"It's perfect! I'm a big guy so I ordered the 30&#34; chain... Once it arrived I put it on and haven't taken it off since - my seven month old tanks and pulls on it with no problem - for it to be as thin as it is, it's a monster! Through all the tough yanking and pulling, through all the showers it still shines like new!"
5.0,This hat is perfect! We ordered a second because it is that good
5.0,"Very comfortable and smoothing. Not super snug, so it doesn't have a lot of tummy control, but it did the job and I'm satisfied with the product."
5.0,I like the way it fit.  Very comfortable.
5.0,This ring was nice but I ordered the wrong size and had to return. Didn’t like it enough to order again.
5.0,"This dress is so beautiful and so soft! Every time I wear it I get a ton of compliments! It even has pockets! I will say it does hit just right at my ankles though without shoes on but I am also 5'9"" and my friend who is 5'5"" says it is long on her so I guess it just depends on your own height! I would say this fits true to size as well if not a little loose but I like that style in this dress so it doesn't bother me! Great buy!"
5.0,"These fit comfortably, perfectly, and look very flattering on. I highly recommend these if you are trying to look a little more slim or are trying to hide a few extra pounds like me."
5.0,Good for what I needed them for. Everyone loved them.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, unusual watch.  My husband loved it!"
5.0,"Incredible watch. The functionality, ease of use, and appearance are top of the line. The strap is incredible comfortable and made out of quality leather too. On top of everything, the service was wonderful too; the watch arrived from Japan 2 weeks earlier than the earliest date given by amazon."
5.0,Absolutely Love these earrings ! The sparkle is amazing . In photos the earrings light up . Beautiful
5.0,"Love the soft blue color, material is 100% cotton and feels very soft. Inside is very smooth and feels almost as if it was silk. Very stylish, can be paired with a pair of jeans and white tshirt underneath it for a complete look. It’s 100% cotton so be wary of cold weather otherwise it’s a perfect hit for holidays!!"
5.0,Beautiful Watch
5.0,Feels great keeps me nice and warm
5.0,Love these aviators!  They are so light!
5.0,"Super cute, I'm 5'3 & 180 lbs & xl fit great. Nice material, not too thin."
5.0,"I love it and where it all the time! I can dress it up with a skirt or slacks, or dress it down with a pair of jeans."
5.0,This bra was a nice fit and comfortable to wear on a daily basis. The material of this is bra is amazing. I would love to order again!
5.0,"Great morale tab, high quality stitching and Velcro. Get some!"
5.0,Fantastic! My students loved seeing my in this during October. I plan to wear it again when we go over skeletons.
5.0,They are very pretty to look at and well made.They are holding up well in the washing and if you want to iron them for a more polished appearance that works too(I don't though).They are usually wadded up in a pocket or folded tiny to fit in my purse.My grand daughters love them and think they feel&#34; female&#34;.When we go to church they have to have one for their purses too.I don't have to fear them ripping or pulling apart when the girls use them as they are sturdy.Love the hankies and feel they will last a long while.
5.0,"Love the style, the material is thin but so comfortable to wear. The sleeves are a little longer but i love it that way. i can wear any top under it and it is very flattering. So happy with purchase. tempted to buy more. The fitted style look terrific as it curves around you but drops nicely. its not like the straight long cut cardigan. This one sits nicely. I bough a Large as i am a size US 14."
5.0,Love it. I am 5’3” and I ordered a size-small. The fit on me is perfect. I am all about summer dresses this season and I will wear this one a lot.
5.0,"This is honestly the cutest skirt I own! My only complaint would be that the straps are a bit long, but I think that's just because I'm only 5' tall.<br />Really flowing material as well. I just want to twirl and be adorable when I wear this"
5.0,"What a great, little bag!  Very durable and of good quality.<br />The only thing that was perplexing was the tag said not to get the actual bag too hot.  Why is that?"
5.0,Unit quirks week for a small space. Wish it was actually portable but has to be plugged in at all times and can't be plugged into a battery push only a wall. But otherwise for the price it's great.
5.0,This price is like stealing. I normally wears size small to medium 4/6 and ordered size small. I am 34D 27/37 and this dress is very stretch yet not too thin and hugs body sexy and classy at same time. Got so much compliments on this dress and ordered 3 more. Love this dress! I highly recommend  :)
5.0,I will say KastKing just keep impressing me. Shirt looks and feels great. The neck hole is a little tight for me but for others it might be fine. Have to see how it holds up in the long run.
5.0,This is of much higher quality than I anticipated and I wear it more frequently than I anticipated too.
5.0,Love these glasses! I ordered the black ones and they arrived on time and in great condition! They are made out of good solid material and don’t feel cheap by any means. The nose area is aligned perfectly so the glasses don’t sit crooked on your face (yes I have had glasses that did this). These work great in the daylight! Even with sunglasses on sometimes I still have to squint in the daylight to see and that is not the case with these. They also adjust to different light well so if you’re transitioning from outdoors to indoors they don’t black you out temporarily. You can still see clearly no matter what. Overall great quality! Would absolutely buy again!
5.0,I love this skirt so much. I listened to reviews and ordered up two sizes from what I normally wear. It drapes beautifully and is heavy and full. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Beautiful - very happy with how it looked when i received it.  Love rings - this is unusual and looks great.  just wear the leave towards hand so it doesn't snag things.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these shoes but they run one size bigger than what I normally wear, same with my daughter's size.  She is normally a size 1 in girls (age 7) and she should have ordered a size 13 which is one size smaller."
5.0,"So comfortable. I thought these were really cute. I wasn't sure if the toe area was going to be too tight. The picture makes it look like a cross between a regular sandal and a peep toe. These are definitely a sandal with plenty of toe room. Nice 2 inch heel and padded heel makes them perfect to wear with jeans, shorts, or skirt. l bought a second pair."
5.0,"item arrived on time and as pictured, perfect length and color.  used for jessica rabbit costume. i would recommend both the product and company"
5.0,Love this watch
5.0,nice crossbody handbag!!
5.0,"worked well after having a baby. The back seemed to wrinkle over time, but overall the purpose was met."
5.0,Not much to say other than they do they're job everyday.
5.0,Great material and not see through! I love them. More comfortable than any nikes I've ever bought/worn.
5.0,I got these for my bridesmaids and they were really so much more beautiful than I could have expected.  I was so proud to give them and they came in such a gorgeous gift box and with a certificate.  Really impressive.
5.0,I really like it and I have gotten a lot of compliments how it looks thank you so much
5.0,"These are a good deal.  I wear them around the house all the time.  They are sturdy, and stay on.  Some socks like these make a mark on the back of your foot and hurt a bit.  These haven't made a mark and don't pinch."
5.0,Great and exceeded expectations. Very pretty and I loved the gift box.
5.0,"Damnnnn this is one sexy cosplay outfit! I’m 5’6, 124 pounds and this thing fits like a GLOVE. I feel so bad ass in it, and it’s very comfortable! It’s well-made for the price and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on it!! I plan to buy other versions of this outfit now that I now it fits so well and looks great on! Great for cosplay purposes!"
5.0,This shirt is fun and bright.  Perfect to stick out in a crowd or when you’re running and want to be seen!
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my child father and he fill in love instantly.
5.0,"I purchased the open toed the are perfect for a nonslip walk in the house, and perfect for stretching"
5.0,For my elderly (104) mother.  It is much easier to give her added warmth than having to put her arms thru sleeves.  Very pretty and makes her happy.
5.0,"Fit me perfectly, felt cute in it. I love the flower pattern reminds me of a vintage pattern and definitely recommend. Usually a size small and got size small, fit nicely. The top might just a hair tight but honestly I’m not wearing a bikini top for a long time so it doesn’t bother me."
5.0,Really nice large but light weight and really pretty on on of my fav ratings.
5.0,I have never been more in love with a clothing item!
5.0,Absolutely love this sweater!!  I got it in the blue. It was the perfect fit. Not too tight or too big. I’m 5’5 and weigh 120lbs. and it is so cozy!  Will definitely be ordering another color!
5.0,"This is such a cute swimsuit! My daughter loves it! Bought size 3t (her regular size) and it's fits her great. Not too tight, she has some room to grow. Added bonus the skirt has a drawstring to make sure bottoms stay up. Perfect amount of coverage to keep her skin protected and remain cool. Love it!!!"
5.0,Other than a tiny bit small my 5 year old loves these. Quality is great too
5.0,Awesome gift for my grandson
5.0,a little big in shoulders...but nice
5.0,So cute!!! Good quality for the price. I’m so happy I risked it and bought it.
5.0,"I have had a terrible time finding a dance leotard that fits my daughter- she is 4. I love the capizo brand but it never fits her right. This Stelle one fit PERFECT!!! I love love love it on her. She has enough room to grow so it should last her the whole season, but it's also not too big right now either. The material feels like a great quality material. I have not washed it yet, but it definitely feels like it will hold up. I am going to buy her another in a different color. I am shocked how great it is, especially for the price. I am extremely pleased!!"
5.0,Nice quality. Perfect fit.
5.0,I love love love these I have a wider face and they look great =)
5.0,"Be advised that these are not ""flip up"" sunglasses.  They clip-on only.  Once I got the correct size, it was great.  The size and shape matches my frame size, so my glasses with the clip-on, looks like dedicated shades, not clip-on's.  Bought a second pair to keep in my other car."
5.0,Best compression socks I have tried.
5.0,"I will definitely purchase more! I was able to wear these by themselves with a shirt for a full day of vacation adventure. I climbed various Mayan structures, toured a cave, and much other walking, climbing, and car riding for over 12 hours straight. Not only did I not have tired legs, I had no new varicose veins, and didn't have any leg pain-even the next day. They were also not too tight (with the right size)."
5.0,Cute. Loved it.
5.0,"I LOVE these shorts! I am athletic, with a very bottom-heavy frame (27"" waist, 39"" hips, for perspective) and I ordered a size medium. These shorts are very comfy and flattering, and they fit well on my waist and thighs - which doesn't happen often. Did I mention they're squat-proof?? I already ordered a second pair and I can't wait for them to arrive!"
5.0,Awesome price and product
5.0,These shows were bought for my grandson. He seems very happy with them.
5.0,"OMGosh I Loveee these Silky Hair Bonnets💜 The Designs are Unique,Stylish,Comfortable&they Protect UR Hair Underneath !!! ""I Will definitely Purchase More&Recommend it 2My Family&Friends !!!"
5.0,LOVE THIS PRODUCT THANK YOU FOR OFFERING IT AT A DISCOUNT!
5.0,Bery nice
5.0,nice and ergonomic.

5.0,"I absolutely love this. 100% as expected. Great quality, comfortable and fits great."
5.0,Love the bracelet! It arrived quickly and is a beautiful piece!!
5.0,"Authentic and a great addition to my boyfriend's wardrobe, this one came with a Velez bag not another one I purchased didn't"
5.0,"Great Goggles, never fog up and fit my helmet very well."
5.0,"Very nice, quality, well made lederhosen. Their sizing is right on.  We ordered one size up from regular pant size and the fit is a tad large in the waist but he wouldn't have wanted them any smaller.  The leather is soft but quite thick so sitting would be difficult in a smaller size. The suspenders take any loose waist issues and if he wants to wear a heavy sweater with it no problem."
5.0,nice.. I love it... confortable and good quality
5.0,A very nice robe.  Fits very well.
5.0,This hook is a little pricey but works well to keep my keys together without getting bulky in my pocket. Easy to get key rings on and off; use it in conjunction with a small everyday pocket knife. Well worth the investment.
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter when she take trips she loves it. Too bad it has not been cold enough to use much
5.0,Great backup band after the Australian shepherd gets ahold of your watch
5.0,Silky smooth
5.0,"Just as advertised!  Love these bracelets, very beautiful"
5.0,It fits great and looks great! I love it!
5.0,"Perfect Lounge pants, not too open to where you can see underwear, which is what I was worried about! I love them! Need more colors!!"
5.0,My daughter loves these sandals and wants to wear them all the time.
5.0,I love your efficiency and the quality of products. You get things to us faster than anyone. I love that.
5.0,Looks good and very good quality.
5.0,Purchased for my sister she loves it. Already had one in a coffee color. Straps could be just little longer
5.0,"I personally didn't wear this jersey, but it was great quality. I was told that it was a little large, but it wasn't a huge deal."
5.0,"I purchased these compression socks in hopes of them helping with my feet and legs swelling. I am a nurse and I work 10 hour shifts. These compression socks work VERY WELL. My feet and legs no longer hurt from swelling. I wear them every day to work and they work great, no more feet and leg pain from being on my feet all day at work.. I would recommend these compression socks to anyone that is on their feet for long periods Of time.."
5.0,Love this hoodie
5.0,"I really love it, it is so chic & beautiful!!"
5.0,"Comfortable, feet didn't sweat and helped with circulation. I have RA and plantar fasciitis and my feet and calves didn't hurt as much by end of day."
5.0,I love this top. I'm waiting for white jeans I ordered to wear with it. Nice fit. I'm going to Florida in a few weeks and this will be very comfortable wear.
5.0,"This is a nice, well made jacket. Perfect for early spring and late fall."
5.0,Gracias muy bonito
5.0,"These are great! We live in Hawaii, so it gets real hot. Bought these so my husband wouldn't have to wear the vest over his work shirt. I was a bit skeptical about how long the reflective strip was going to hold out. Reading the reviews, that was the #1 concern about the shirts. We've had the shirts for about 6 months now, been through roughly 30-40 washes, and it's been ok. It may be because I air dry the shirts instead of throwing them in the dryer.<br />We'll definitely be buying more when these finally fade out."
5.0,I ordered this for my daughter to lengthen a necklace that was too short. Works perfectly to make the necklace wearable for her.
5.0,Just love it
5.0,"I actually bought a larger shoe for myself a 6.5 and thought that would be plenty big. I am glad that I did because it turned out to fit almost a little tight. This is an exceptional shoe for me. I love it. It is taller than I thought it would be. And it is reinforced between the heel and the body of the shoe. Tall shoes like these tend to break right inbetween there and I can see that it has been reinforced with additional shoe material. It was a great price for this type of shoe (like $28-30). It feels comfortable enough, but if I buy again ... I would definitely get a size 7 -- so that is one size bigger than what I usually wear. The shoe body looks like nice quality material and it isn't scratched up or anything when I received it. The treads are very thick and rocks can easily get stuck between the treads. Your feet will feel a slant and you do feel like you are kind of on your toes, but it is not as bad as some of my other pointy shoes. They feel very solid. I love them!"
5.0,Very cute bag! Looked exactly like the picture. It was a little larger than what I thought- but it was great.
5.0,Shipping was great and fast. The produCT came as described.  Fits true to size.  Very warm and comfortable. Perfect for the winter months.
5.0,"Arrived quickly.  The tags are eye-catching, have secure steel fasteners and appear to be tough enough to survive airline luggage handlers"
5.0,I don't have to be taking off my eye Glasses constantly just hang them around my neck
5.0,So cute!  I wear it all of the time!
5.0,"These are good for a change from pantyhose. They come up high enough on me (I am 5'8"") that they can be worn with an above-the-knee skirt (but not real mini) without the top showing."
5.0,It is a great blouse.  I wore it under a jumper and received several compliments.  It is just dressy enough.
5.0,This is a beutiful top. Just bought another in black. Reviews said it runs large but shrinks in the wash. I did not find this to happen. I am 5'4 at 165lbs and bought a large. It is a prefect fit even after washing. Note.. I did not put in dryer.
5.0,Easy fit and stay on well.
5.0,"So, this isn’t going to be a very in-depth review as I’ve just gotten these boots last week. My first impression straight outta the box. You can tell right away that this isn’t your average boot. They are very well made, and have no visible imperfections. I’ve already come to the conclusion that these are one of the most comfortable boots I’ve ever worn. I purchased a 9W, and have no ankle slip at all. I’ll update this review in a few weeks after I’ve had some time to really put these to work, but for $99, and a little research on the Bifida, I doubt I could have made a better choice. Stoked to see how these perform at the range, and on the trail, and how much more comfortable they’ll be after I’ve put them through some hell."
5.0,I really like these gloves. The fingertips do not work for a phone though
5.0,Love it! Makes my watch look more feminine! It can be a little uncomfortable sometimes and will leave a small print (the string part) in my skin for a while when it's a little too tight but that is expected.
5.0,"Firstly let me say I love allegra k women's clothing. So when my husband needed some clothing they were the first company I looked at.<br />Husband is 5'11 150lbs I ordered a large, could of done a medium but he says he likes it breathable and looser. It's not overly big just fyi for your sizing needs. Quality is good, shirt looks sharp."
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic septum ring. Bought this as an Xmas gift for myself and I was not disappointed! Size was true, fits perfectly, and looks so bad ass! Will buy from this seller again!"
5.0,"My husband said they work real good to keep out the UV rays. He said the arms are alittle short but, they still work out ok."
5.0,"As described, my wife loves it."
5.0,"My daughter loves loves loves this ring!  It is very pretty and definitely worth the price.  The band does bend fairly easily though...which is to be expected at this price point.  Great ring for anyone, especially a young teenager."
5.0,Purchased for gift bags -- solid and well made!!
5.0,Immediately ordered the other color
5.0,"This dress is amazing. The colors are so vibrant and I get endless compliments from strangers when I'm wearing it! Fit is super comfy and the scoop hem with the side slits are perfect for hot, humid DC summers."
5.0,"Cute, cool, and comfy. I’m 5’1” and a small fits good in length. Not short but above my knee."
5.0,Love them!! So lightweight you dont know your wearing them!! Great uv protection without being too darkening that you can use them in a cloudy day!
5.0,Use it with most of my clothing
5.0,Very pretty! Cute packaging. The stem is flexible and not a straight rod - just what I wanted. Flowers are staggered and part of the gold stem - looks secure.
5.0,"I love how soft these bras are. I used to swear by VS, but now I don’t want to wear anything with an underwire. The support in these are great, they have a removable pad that is very thin and the best part is that it zips in front. I bought these for pure comfort. I didn’t have a surgery or a baby."
5.0,This outfit runs true to size! Good stretch! I ordered a size large!
5.0,😃👍
5.0,Love the design I get so many compliments on it. It doesn't really stick my skin or anything I really love it.
5.0,"My son loves these. Nice soft material, not too thick or thin and they have been holding up well in the washer/dryer with no fraying elastic. Cute pattern selection too."
5.0,"Stunning, good quality and very comfortable! Small fits perfectly: I'm 5'4 and 125lb. Loved it."
5.0,Love this product I can keep one with me to look up coin values. Then the other one  I keep with my coins to look at details that I am unable see.
5.0,Absolutely love these earrings! I wear my hair in a very short style and I do not like large post earrings. These earrings fit the bill perfectly. They can be elegant yet you can wear them with casual outfits also. I definitely recommend these earrings.
5.0,They're perfect
5.0,First class key chain fine quality
5.0,It fits great and looks good. I love it. I ordered two more. 😁
5.0,Beautiful. I love it.
5.0,"Good material, fits and looks great!"
5.0,They match the necklace that I wanted to wear them with.  Can't ask for more.
5.0,I got a size large and I love it! I am 5'8' and it fits as expected. It is a bit above my knees but that's fine for me because I wear my dresses with black leggings.The quality of the dress is really nice and I received a lot of compliments from my co-workers and friends when I wore it. Definitely recommend as a casual going out dress! :)
5.0,Soft and sexy
5.0,"Rose gold not quite as expected, but does look as pictured.  No complaints.  Love them all.  Like to complement all smaller bracelets or bangles."
5.0,"Omg so comfortable and sexy!!  Buy them.  Period.  If you complained about these,  its you!!!! Lol buying again"
5.0,Nice product and very great for the price!
5.0,Perfect for what I needed. This is my second pair of gummie socks. Wore through the other pair and I hope these last longer!
5.0,"Perfect fit, my daughter have a review that said it all....ITS NOT SCRATCHY! Whew! Nice and soft"
5.0,Just dressy enough. 😁 You can play up or down. Nice weight. 👍👍👍
5.0,Tal como en la foto. Muy lindo
5.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.
5.0,I love how soft and great fit they are. I may end up buying another pair of the other color I want to get.
5.0,This is adorable! I ordered a small and it fits great with a stretchy material it is very comfortable and attractive.  I washed it in cold water and hung on a hanger to dry.  This top is roomy in the chest area even though it's a small and I am petite and wear a size 6 so it hugs the hips nicely.  Gotta love leopard print!
5.0,I love the Bobby Singer outline and the antipossession symbol attached.
5.0,Perfect for thick ear lobes.
5.0,This bathing suit looks beautiful on my daughter. She is a little heavy and stomach usually shows with other suits. Do go to the Sovoyontee site because I bought another one thinking it was the Sovoyontee brand but was a knockoff. Layers did not come together in stomach area. She is 5 ft 3 in and weighs 159 and I got a large<br /> Love it.
5.0,Gave this to my sister for Christmas and she loved it! It looks beautiful and well made.
5.0,Very fancy bracelet
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9e4b96cfc040a6491f25884efad36d58]] These are superb fall boots. I like how they look. I like how they feel. They also walk well and don't pinch my feet at all. So I like these and will wear them regularly.
5.0,Wow...really impressed by the fit. Great for curvy body type. Cute and comfy.
5.0,Awesome shirts for a great price. Will be buying more.
5.0,I Love it I have a petite wrist and it fits well

5.0,Overall look. Well made for cost
5.0,"But other than that good shoe for the price, bought another pair"
5.0,I use this pray shaw in prayer daily. I feel like the hand s of the LOrd are upon me and all around me in prayer.
5.0,"Husband loves his new band. No issues with several months of wear. Never takes his watch off. It goes through shower, swimming, biking, motorcycle riding, etc etc. would order again if needed."
5.0,Need to order one size up.
5.0,"Great item. The jumpsuit was purchased as an outfit for a vintage themed party, but it was a huge hit. Everybody loved it. When it arrived (quickly) via USPS, it was a bit wadded into the package, but after spraying a bit of water on it and shaking it out, it was wrinkle free fairly quickly. The item fit perfectly, I am 5-5 and was longer than I anticipated, which was just fine. The belt was somewhat long and made the bow in back a bit larger that I would have liked, but otherwise, it was a quality item from a good seller. I would recommend."
5.0,Have great space for everything I need for work
5.0,Super cute feminine skirt that is perfect for spring and summer. Would love to get it in other pastel colors :)
5.0,"Exactly as expected, fast shipping too"
5.0,Works perfect for keeping hats and gloves from getting lost.
5.0,absolutely stunning!
5.0,This was is very beautiful and lightweight I got a lot of compliments on this dress. I would definitely recommend it to others.
5.0,"I love these masks they fit well, don't shrink in the wash, don't wrinkle, my dogs hair doesn't stick to them, and they are very comfortable smooth material that doesn't irritate my skin"
5.0,This is an awesome little bracelet for a gymnast. I love that it came in colors that weren't super girly (purple/pink) because my daughter is definitely  more into blues/teals. I love it. I will say that for my other daughter- I found a ballerina bracelet for 1/2 the cost of this one- but this was the least expensive gymnast one I could find.
5.0,Perfect I'll go back for other options
5.0,Love it! I started using it as my &#34;weekend purse&#34; but switched to everyday. I had to learn to carry around less stuff but it's worked out well. Kind of like a metaphor for life LOL
5.0,"Great size for those of us who don't like to carry around of ""stuff""!"
5.0,Beautiful!! I get so many compliments!
5.0,Should have ordered one in every color!
5.0,The size is great. Made very well.
5.0,right fit for my Samsung Gear S2!
5.0,Loved the style comfort and design of the cherry on black. Size wise runs small. 5’6” 185# need xl. Snug fit
5.0,"I'm a crossing guard for my daughters school. It's so dark in the mornings now thanks to the time change so I purchased this to be seen better. It is so bright. It also fits really well. Definitely would fit small or plus size people. If you're worried about this not being bright enough, Don't be. It's almost too bright lol. Worth the money!!"
5.0,Absolutely love this dress! Perfect for leggings and boots!
5.0,"We bought this for our son as a replacement for his previous wallet, which was exactly the same.  It lasted him many years, and he won't have any other wallet."
5.0,Great addition to my costume…
5.0,Great dress!  Looking forward to wearing it this summer!
5.0,I love these bands. Comfortable enough to wear all day. Shipping takes awhile but it's worth it.
5.0,It was what I ordered and looked good and my dad loved for his Christmas present. now we just need golf weather.
5.0,Excellent pocket squares Good material great colors Glenn
5.0,cute on my pandora charm bracelet
5.0,"This jacket fits like a glove. Regularly wear a 14 or XL. I could go with the XL or XXL in this, opted for the smaller size because I prefer a more fitted feel when riding. The quality of leather and design is impressive and you definitely get a better bang for your buck than so many cheaper jackets I've tried on. Accordion like stretchy sides are very form fitting but allow movement. Built in pads are high quality but not so stiff you can move. Highly recommend this riding jacket."
5.0,The wings of Auset/Isis and the Ankh compliment each other.  They are as beautiful as they are meaningful.  I will recommend to others.
5.0,Its just as perfect in person
5.0,"So pretty & vibrant!  I’m five foot, 2 inches, & 130 pounds; fits well! Comfortable & worth every penny."
5.0,I love these because they are so comfortable.
5.0,Excellent! It is softer to the touch than titanium and hasn't shown any sign of wear. Looks exactly like the image.

5.0,Awesome quality and looks very nice. very functional too!
5.0,Love this sweater. It fits great high quality.
5.0,"love it. perfect for summer.  I am a woman who shaves her head due to hair loss. this is cute, stylish, great coverage and most importantly not too hot.  perfect for year round."
5.0,"Beautiful looked gorgeous, heavy and well made."
5.0,"I’m 5’7, 205lbs with muscular thighs and the XL fit perfectly."
5.0,Daughter loves it. Full coverage
5.0,I enjoy this bracelet with multicolor evil eyes. Some are not exactly in the center of the white eye portion but I am not bothered by this.The bracelet is the wrap-around type and comfortable and easy to wear. I have an average size wrist and believe this will fit all sizes. I haven't fully submerged this in water so I can not comment on its durability. I choose to remove it to prolong its life! Would recommend highly!
5.0,"Fabulous for the price. Looks good, well made, incredible bargain."
5.0,"If you're looking for a silky, light weight, and comfortable all purpose shirt, this is it. For those who have long arms, go for it; you'll be pleasantly surprised. I have them in all colors available."
5.0,Love it - very cute!
5.0,Very pretty! Perfect size!
5.0,Arrived on time. I am a small to medium. I ordered a medium. It fit great. Sleeves hang nice. Good for a dress or casual. Looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,love the animal print and feel of fabric
5.0,I know I should diet and lose some weight (actually a lot) but this stretcher really does work!
5.0,"I was a bit skeptical to buy this dress. I am so glad I got it. The material is not thin and see through. It is a nice, heavy enough fabric that you don't see panty lines. It is so comfortable, and yet quite classy. It has a hidden zipper under the left arm. Those are always helpful. It does not have pockets. I do wish it did, but if it had them, it may not fit as well, or hang as nicely. Either way, I would definitely buy this dress again!"
5.0,Love this dress and the material
5.0,"I love these headbands! In fact, I was so impressed with my first one, I came back and ordered four more. In fact, I still want thd purple/white one, so I'll probably get it soon, too.<br /><br />So, here's info you need to know. They fit great. Snug, but not tight and not too loose either. They have little rubber strips on the inside that keep them in place and they work!<br /><br />I originally bought one because I walk every day, and I live in south Texas where sweating is inevitable. These have really helped keep the sweat out of my eyes!<br /><br />I decided when I got the first one that I'd just wash them by hand when I take them off after my workout. It takes about 30 seconds, and I hang them over a towel bar to dry.<br /><br />Now, with all my new colors, I get to be stylish too!<br /><br />I love these headbands and highly recommend them!<br /><br />Update: I now have ALL the colors. I wish they made others, like solid blue, solid pink, etc. I'd order every last one."
5.0,"Great product, great grandchildren love the paw patrol.?"
5.0,"I love this necklace. It was exactly what I had wanted, and it looks great will my holiday outfits!. I did pull on it too hard, causing the wire to pull away from the clasp. Luckily I found all the beads, and repaired it easily."
5.0,"Great product, fast transaction. Would buy again. Thanks!"
5.0,Looks as pictured!!! Super cute.
5.0,"I love these, the back of these bibs are so soft.  They are not super think but with the double layer they can stand up to all that teething drool."

5.0,"These S.S. earrings are so pretty, and very well made.  They are highly polished and finished on both sides!  I love them!  I bought these for gift giving; however, i may just end up keeping them!!!!"
5.0,"It's very light, not sure from warmth"
5.0,I bought for my mom it's fits nice

5.0,Makes any top a fashion statement
5.0,I’m 5’1 and weigh 136 lbs I got the medium which is what I usually wear and it fits just right… it is meant to be tight fitting so keep that in mind. It’s exactly what i was looking for! Going to be wearing these to the gym and may order more in the future 😁 came in super quick too!
5.0,This dress is amazing! Stretchy and fitting all in one. I’m 5’8 and size 10. Can go between a medium and a large but medium fits perfect.
5.0,My grandaughter was over the moon when she opened this!
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE These pants!!! oh so flowy and omgosh so comfy! Just got them haven't gone out with them yet. Says they will shrink a little in the wash and they fit perfect right now so i am crossing my fingers that it's really just a little bit. But totally buying more!!!
5.0,I love the bracelet but i wish it came with better packaging
5.0,"Very pretty necklace, great value."
5.0,"Having a wall-mounted clock there’s always a concern for time keeping accuracy,  no one wants to deal with having to adjust o’clock that’s hard to get to, but I’ve had this clock for about six months now and still is within seconds of the world time clock that I set it with. The tide is always Right when I double check it on my Surfline app too.  The second hand is audible and is somewhat soothing after a long day but my wife has threaten to break it a few days she’s come home with a migraine so."
5.0,This is a great dress shirt! It fits me perfectly and is great for the summer heat!
5.0,I like the dress just to small the waist
5.0,Exactly as described and arrived in one day. These were perfect for my daughter’s goody bags!
5.0,"These look great and were just the right kind of sunglasses for my husband.  Whether its for driving and being out and about or for when he is playing sports, these look great, fit well and do the job.

5.0,"Was great for Halloween, it was exactly what is described. Very pleased."
5.0,Perfect fit and beautiful quality and colors
5.0,Love this top fits great and looks great color is exactly as pictured
5.0,"Zable is the sensible AND style minded jewelry of choice in my family.  I have purchased several of these.  They look wonderful, they are nearly indestructible and I love them. In addition to the piece I bought for myself, I have given three as gifts.  I love the value compared to the more exclusive and expensive brand name and the available beads and charms from Zable are lovely."
5.0,"Perfect for my 2 year old, love the non skip tread. Would purchase again!"
5.0,I do ballet and this top is great for comfort and movement. Highly recommended.
5.0,Beautiful and brand new
5.0,Great socks! I am currently training for 5k and needed good quality product. I am thinking to get another pair! Five stars ✨
5.0,"These are wonderful! They are great quality for the price. Perfect size for teen or adult and they would probably work for a child, though I'm sure would be too big for toddler or younger.<br />Also, even though they weren't an Amazon Prime product, they were shipped and received even faster than some of the things I purchased at the same time that were through Prime."
5.0,Cute. Comfy. Perfect.
5.0,"Exactly what I expected,  very ornate on the front & back. My husband loved it."
5.0,The best & the most comfortable
5.0,Really nice shirt - comfy

5.0,"Bought this and love it, comfortable and fits well. Received many compliments."
5.0,"Love design, colors and quality my new scarf! Thank you!"
5.0,This wallet arrived on time which I was very pleased with. I ordered this product in the lavender and it is absolutely beautiful. Lot's of slots to put your cards and another compartment to put coins and dollar bills. Looks very expensive which I love.
5.0,Perfect Halloween costume my kid was ecstatic!
5.0,Son was needing this for a play. He is 8 and it fit him perfect. Very soft. Exactly what I needed.
5.0,Just started wearing this and it is perfect for walks on chilly Michigan nights. Good material and goes with my coats and sweaters. Cleans easily too. Feels good on my skin as well. Nice!
5.0,These are so AWESOME!! I have bought 4 sets because my daughter and granddaughter keep borrowing mine!
5.0,Outstanding detail to the hat
5.0,very erotic
5.0,Husband loves Pulp Fiction. Carries this everyday. Even came with a fake ID for one of the movie characters. Stood up well to everyday wear.
5.0,"I really appreciate that they are very light.  Heavy glasses have a tendency to give me a headache.  I also like the style a lot, I only wish the lens portion was a little smaller.  I am not into the big Hollywood glasses"
5.0,I have many earrings from this brand they are great quality and don’t irritate my skin.
5.0,Came in so much prettier then I thought! Love it!
5.0,These are a great length. My shorts go up past my knees when I work out and I like to have compression shorts underneath that do not rise up. These are the longest I have seen and they fit tightly. I am a 31 waist and ordered the small. These are not so tight that they are uncomfortable but they are tight enough to stay in place. I would recommend buying the black color because blue does not match well with most other colors.
5.0,Dry comfortable
5.0,"These are constructed very well. I have a similar set that does not compare to these. The zipper is very heavy duty, the clear plastic covers are very thick and resist puncturing and the stitching is very strong. The same applies with the fabric of the bags, it is very thick and durable and would be very difficult to poke a hole through. On close inspection it looks like a Kevlar type cloth. In testing the cubes I took the small one, placed paper towels inside and ran the cube through the washing machine. The only area that leaked was the very small opening at the very end of the zipper.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the size of the cubes, my waste is size 40. I can fit two pair of jeans in the large cube without crumpling them up. My dress shirts are 2XL and I can nicely fold two shirts into the middle sized on without scrunching them up and the small cube will accept a couple pair of boxers, socks and two t-shirts.<br /><br />The cubes came with an odor inside similar to vinyl or rubber. I simply wiped the inside out with distilled vinegar and let it air out for 1/2 and hour and the smell was gone. I travel abroad for business constantly and I believe these cubes will help prevent the smell of jet fuel in the clothes when I arrive. I received this product to provide a fair and honest review."
5.0,I used these during our camping trip to keep track of the kids. Worked perfectly.
5.0,"This strap looks and feels great! The leather is soft and thin, but is showing no signs of wear. The captive quick release spring bars are super easy to use"
5.0,"Ordered this with the matching necklace for my upcoming May wedding and was even better in person, had to exchange for the silver tone one but they made that as easy as pie! Will look glamorous on my big day. Matches my lace and pearl dress perfectly."
5.0,Love! It’s honestly too big and bulky to wear! I put it on the mirror in my car!
5.0,"This is a thick, absorbent headband suitable for heavy perspiration.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,"I live in AZ, it's HOT. I was looking for summer dresses and this one is perfect! I'm curvy and this dress is very flattering. The material is very soft and comfortable. I pulled this dress straight out of the dryer, threw it on for church, came home and took a nap in it then wore it to the grocery store. True story. I love it so much I'm ordering 3 more in different colors."
5.0,PERFECT!!!!  looks just like picture!  this will be worn all summer!  (no clasp; pull over head.)
5.0,This is an absolutely beautiful strap. I replaced the metal bracelet and it looks awesome
5.0,"Es un buen producto, muy barato, y dan lo que ofrecen. Es correcto, bien hecho y bonito"
5.0,Loved this headband! I purchased it to go with a new years outfit for my daughter. The stretchy material was very comfortable on her head and left no marks. I love a big bow and this one was perfect!
5.0,"Love these tees - exactly what I was looking for.  When the ground is frozen, I can't use a regular wooden or plastic tee.  These NEO golf tees hold the ball perfectly with 3 heights to choose from.  They don't fly or roll far away and are very easy to find.  I have been using one tall tee and one short tee for about 20 rounds, and they are still in like-new condition.  I may end up using these tees during the regular golf season."
5.0,Love the style.  Its very soft
5.0,for $220 a great buy.even glows in the day. if you shake it you can hear it self winding.my favorite watch ever
5.0,They work as advertised.
5.0,Great product sturdy construction
5.0,I gave this to my bestfriend for Christmas. It looks even more beautiful in person and it fits our friendship perfectly. It was a great gift idea!
5.0,Gift for peacock lover. Big & bright she loved it & I was happy when I saw it
5.0,"Love these pajamas. Lightweight, soft & gorgeous."
5.0,"You will not be disappointed in this product.  I cant tell you how many compliments ive gotten on this when i wear it.  You will love it, i promise."
5.0,Love Them! They fit perfectly!!! I have small fingers so finding rings that actually fit properly is very hard but these fit exactly how they are suppose to fit!
5.0,Work very well just need to be a bit bigger
5.0,It is absolutely adorable!! Love the hat!!
5.0,My 3 year old daughter loves these!  They fit her great and are made very well.  She loves them so much she wears them everyday and even to bed :) She can also run around the house easily on floors without slipping due to the rubber on the bottoms.  If your kid is a PJ Masks fan - these are the slippers you need to get for your little one!
5.0,"Cute purse, get lots of compliments"
5.0,"My wife loves the bag , she uses it everyday."
5.0,"A very good belt.  Would HIGHLY recommend.  I ordered brown instead of black, but because the belt is that awesome, I'll still give it a five star rating.  If you've never used an automatic belt before, you have no idea what you're missing out on.  I can't wear anything else anymore."
5.0,No complaints here. DIL got for Christmas and loves how it feels and fits. Great at hiding flaws ;) Looks great with jeans or leggings. You can pull it up to be a shorter shirt or pull it lower to cover your bum because its quite long but the material is so light it does not look bunched however you wear it. Just watch how you wash it so as not to end up with a hole in the material and you will be getting compliments for a long while.
5.0,Easy to wear and is light and comfort on the head.
5.0,"Outfit is great quality, soft, and fits true to size.<br />Just ordered outfit in pink.<br />Easy on and off for potty training too!"
5.0,adorable and love the huge flower on this
5.0,I bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it. He knows every word in Tommy Boy and could watch the movie every day and not get tired of it 👍
5.0,Order a size up. Super cute and comfy shirt
5.0,I have several of these bracelets and just love them!  Where else can you get real stones in a stretch bracelet for such a low price?!  What a deal!  The colors in this bracelet go with everything and look good with other silver bracelets too.  Great for small gifts for friends.
5.0,Got this for my mom and she loved it! Glad it gave her a little confidence boost haha
5.0,I LOVE IT!!!! I wear this necklace all the time and every where I go I get compliments &#60;3 its so beautiful and arrived earlier than expected :) its definitely a must have!!!
5.0,Beautiful and perfect length on post.
5.0,"saw many people are talking buttery legging, I am curious about it. So I ordered it. As it describes, this buttery soft legging is so comfy and stretchy. and the quality is very good. Softness and stitch well. They are very cute. I am very pleasantly surprised. I worried if it is suitable for Summer(hot day), but when I wear it, I found it is breathable. It fits wonderfully. This buttery soft legging is comfy, sport, sexy. They are not see through. Very happy I purchased it. I will recommend it to my friends."
5.0,Perfect fit and excellent quality.
5.0,"Hi Y’all,<br /><br />I don’t normally write reviews but I think this one deserves it! I just has shoulder surgery today and the shirt works great. My husband was able to put it on without  issues and without moving my shoulder. I was originally skeptical with the high price but I absolutely love it. I also purchased the Heather Blue. For sizing, I got the Xtra Small and it fits great, not tight at all. For reference i am 5’7 and 120. I would recommend getting your normal size. The fabric is very soft and comfortable for wearing, even with the shoulder sling being on. I was nervous about the zippers moving or unzipping, but they have not moved at all!<br /><br />I highly recommend!!😀😀"
5.0,"Perfect fit for my large hands, and machine wash & dry beautifully"
5.0,"Love this top, have a few like it.  The color is exactly as shown."
5.0,these glasses changed my life :) i went from being ugly duckling to a super cute geek!! These glasses literally found me my girlfriend!!! MUST HAVE!
5.0,My husband loves his hard hat and he is getting the attention his poor Cleveland Browns need.
5.0,Great shirt. Looks better in person.
5.0,"I bought this purple shirt to wear to the Purple Reign show in Las Vegas and am really excited about it. I love the color and I absolutely adore the back of the shirt with the crochet look. I will probably wear a pendant necklace with it, as the higher neckline allows for a pretty chain to be worn. I plan on wearing the shirt with jeans, as the show is at night. The material of the shirt is good quality and the color of a light purple with a pinkish tint to it. The picture makes it look pink, but it is definitely purple. I would call it a cool tone, which is good for my complexion and will highlight my tan. I ordered an XL based on other reviews saying it was somewhat short waisted. I usually wear a large and sometimes a medium. I am 5'7 and 160 lbs with a long torso and the shirt fits me well. I would have been able to wear a large, but I prefer a little bit looser fit. My chest area is about 38 inches around. I like the length of sleeves which are not super short or too long.<br /><br />I am reviewing this product after receiving it at a discounted price from the seller. I agree to provide and honest and unbiased review. If you look at my profile I provide reviews for almost all of my Amazon purchases in order to help others determine how products match up to their expectations. I always appreciate a good review myself!"
5.0,Very sweet and NOT cheap looking.
5.0,"It's perfect! I bought this for my son, as his first real wallet. It's a sturdy construstion, looks great, and has card slots, a zipper change area, and a money fold."
5.0,Great hats.
5.0,My husband works in a restaurant but for some reason he just go through shoes in 6<br />months. These shoes was the first ones that were comfortable and durable he's very happy with them
5.0,Pay attention to size instructions and it should fit perfectly.  I really love this shirt and everyone wants it
5.0,"Expected it to be very cheap and scratchy but it’s surprisingly comfy and actually fits well! Expected it to be too big in the bust but it wasn’t at all (I’m a 32A). Also expected the bottoms to be weird, but it’s adjustable so you can make it fit almost any body type! The color is spot on too! Don’t waste $60 on a similar set!"
5.0,Great for the price. The bottom rolls up a little bit at times but otherwise great. Needed it for Halloween costume but will certainly wear this for a romantic night in ;) !<br />There is not zipper or latches- just a stretchable band so be careful when putting it on. Suggest you put your deodorant on after getting this on.
5.0,"Nice fabric, nice length.  The wife likes them on me. She's a sucker for short shorts."
5.0,"Bought for my girlfriend. Was worried the quality of the painting wouldn't be as pictured but thankfully it was! Feels so comfortable to the touch and not too thick, so I'm sure she will like it!"
5.0,i love how it looks
5.0,My husband cried when he opened his present! Very happy with this!
5.0,Comfy like walking on air!
5.0,El niño se siente cómodo por la textura del traje y se puede lavar a máquina!
5.0,Highly pleased with these 4mm ear rings but very displeased with the 6mm I purchased  earlier cause the magnets weren't strong enough to hold them together and they kept falling off! The 4mm are perfect and shine just like true diamonds! BEAUTIFUL !!!!!
5.0,Some hats say they are packable but end up not living up to that claim.  This one is truly packable.  Folds and smashes flat.  The feel of the fabric is kind of like a micro fiber - smooth and soft.  The brim is large enough to thoroughly cover your face and the back of your neck.  You can tighten the band to make it more secure on your head.  There's a tie bow in the back which is cute and functional.  It helps tighten up the hat on your head.  I like to wear hats with ties when out on the boat so they don't blow off.  This one stays on very well as it sits down so far on my head.  I really like the look and the color is nice as well.  It comes with it's own little carry case.  I will get a lot of wear out of this one!
5.0,Good outer layer for cool days
5.0,Super cute! More like a dark mint color. Size was perfect. I’m 5 ft and weigh 118 lbs.
5.0,These are great and have a pocket for a filter if you want to use one.
5.0,Great product and service! These are great retailers.
5.0,"This was such a cute dress! Wish I had ordered a larger size of it. The material was perfect, it wasn't too thick or too thin. It was form fitting and the length was just right."
5.0,This belt is amazing!  I love the print.
5.0,I bought this for my daughters first b-day pictures and it was exactly what I wanted!! Fit amazing and looked super cute!!
5.0,"Like Goldilocks and the Three Bears - not too big, not too small.  Compliments my other jewelry."
5.0,This is a beautiful blouse. I followed the size chart and it fits well. I am wearing it with palazzo pants to a wedding in June. Needed something fancy yet comfortable and it is both.
5.0,I purchased this neckless for a friend and it was just the right gift.  I was so pleased when it arrived in the mail.  The neckless appears true to the picture and resembles a simple elegance.  I was able to give my friend a thoughtful and classy gift that was in my price range.
5.0,"I love the pendant, it was a gift. The Phoenix and Lapis are beautiful.<br />We put it in the sun but it barely retained the charge, didn't really glow...but still a beautiful necklace that is also adjustable for length."
5.0,Great quality and price.  Fits even the most overstuffed bag we used to travel to England.
5.0,"Bang for the nick.  Why pay for an Apple band ( 40-60 bucks), when you get the same quality and comfort for 15 dollars. This is a great product....period."
5.0,"Great to see a USA made, tight fitting glove.  Same tight fit but stronger and thicker leather than the China made gloves."
5.0,Was skeptical about ordering sunglasses online but since I can’t go to store to try on I took a gamble. They fit my face (round shape) very nice and are good quality.
5.0,The turquoise color is wonderful for summer and the flip up feature is very convenient. Great value.
5.0,Jacket was just as described! My husband wore it for our wedding and was extremely happy with it. It was a tiny bit too big around the waist but fit perfectly otherwise.
5.0,I really liked these. They were pretty thin and kinda pretty see through as well. But still it didn’t give me any type of camel toe and fit me pretty wonderfully anyways. Just really thin so I gotta buy more soon cause I’m worried they’re getting more see through with wear.
5.0,very pretty sweater
5.0,An elvis fan
5.0,Great Buy
5.0,"These beads are cute, they're nice enough. I wanted them for jewelry making, and they're a bit too big for me. They're sturdy though and they definitely look like strawberries. If you are looking for a medium sized 3D pendant these will work, but they are just a little too big for earrings (which is what I wanted them for). I'm sure I'll find another use for them though!"
5.0,"This gift was to a set of twin girls. One of the twins opened her gift before the other one, her first reaction was not a happy one.  Upon the other twin girl opening her gift the response was the same.  However, the twin girls loved each others gift and happiness was the out come.  They were happy to receive a gift that didn't need to be exchanged.  It all worked out for the happiness of each girl."
5.0,Very cute and fun to wear for the fall
5.0,For the price the quality is great.  I was worried when reading reviews stating they were too big on some and others said they looked weird when you stood up.  I wear a US size 8.5 shoe and these fit perfectly.  Please pardon my lack of a pedicure.
5.0,"I loved it, nice and stretchy material... Would buy from again. Cute for all occasions."
5.0,It is an exquisite piece! I have received many compliments when wearing!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3ec74eda18248e24b2b7c7797f4b30f5]] Pretty cool belt. My husband loves it. Fits good
5.0,The skirt is beautiful. The color is vibrant and has a pretty border. Love it.
5.0,I love this British regal hat.  I can not wait to wear it with some of my outfits.  It is worth the price.
5.0,Fits well the elastic on the back can tighten up. Just wish it had buttons for my mask!
5.0,Bought for my daughter who loves the style. She loved them and they fit perfectly! I will be ordering more for her!
5.0,"These are great!! Cozy warm and comfortable to wear. Often forget they’re on! They fold up small enough to squeeze into jacket pockets too. Inexpensive and a great bargain!! After my initial pair, I bought a couple more in the event I lose one. Seems that anytime a friend tries them on, they immediately want one for themselves - great winter gift! These earmuffs sell themselves!!"
5.0,Great looking wallet
5.0,Very cute bikini!  Arrived ahead of expected time.
5.0,Es muy bueno y  es muy práctico xq tiene doble función la d cubrir el cuello y capucha
5.0,"Great shoes for going out on the town or for that special day. They are more comfortable then I thought they would be. I had them on for three hours without my feet hurting. I wear a size 7 in pumps and boots, 61/2 in sandals. I ordered a size 7 and they fit perfect."
5.0,"I usually order dresses that are true to size or I size up. This dress is super cute and you can dress it up however you want to go on a date, night out with the girls or for work attire. I bought the extra large just to be on the safe side despite the reviews. This time around the reviews are in point, even though this dress looks amazing on me as is, I am ordering another color in a large just because I want this dress to accentuate my curves. I definitely recommend this dress"
5.0,As described and on the. Thanks!
5.0,"Love this bag!  I've been looking at this style for a couple of years and hesitated taking the plunge.  Found this particular bag and wasn't sure about the color but took a chance.  Glad I did as it's very nicely made, love the silver lining and the color is simply beautiful!  Much better than boring brown or black and since I live near the beach and often travel to tropical climates the color is fantastic but it is brighter than the photo shows m- as a previous review says - tilt your computer screen back a little to get an idea of the true color.  Can't find anything to complain about this great deal!"
5.0,This  outfit was way above my expectations! People check this company out! Quality is great!<br /> Price is reasonable.
5.0,"This is a hard plastic, not flexible. Only holds a phone or a few things. Not a deep pocket so a large iPhone fits, but that is it all that can fit in the pocket—could fall out. Regular phone would fit fine."
5.0,Bought them for my son and he loves them.
5.0,These baby clothes are just so cute. Love the fact that they look just like the new adult jumpsuits that are tie-dye. Very comfortable my kids love them.
5.0,Keeping my husband warm on these cold winter nights in the mountains.
5.0,Very pretty and comfortable in the heat  I prefer to hang it dry but this brand lasts a long time.  Best maker of lightweight nightgowns!
5.0,This dress is stunning! I bought it for my birthday. I am 150 pounds and 5'4. I ordered a small and it fit perfectly! I cannot wait to wear it.
5.0,New LLR compared to the older LLR are a tad smaller. If you are in the higher side of TC you should get TC2.
5.0,"I ordered the red one and it is beautiful!  It does take a while to arrive so order early.  Oder an extra for a friend next Christmas.  You'll be glad you did. The weight is just right. Thick enough to keep you warm and thin enough to not be bulky,"
5.0,So glad to find wool socks! Can be worn anytime and always feel so good!
5.0,My relative loved the design and the earrings in general
5.0,"I bought this as a quick "" just because"" gift for my daughter.  She raved about the softness and texture. A good buy!"
5.0,I had a baby 9 months ago & have been looking for leggings that don't show my post baby bump. The thick material of these does a fabulous job of making my mid section look slimmer & will be great for keeping my legs warm in the upcoming winter months.
5.0,"I not the cain of person to leave review when I receive my items after purchase but,, let me tell you I am in love with this brasserie !.. they are so comfy  looks exactly like sport bra but much better than summer time  uncomfortable brasserie, the padding inside its removable,its really comfy because the material, the best its dont have the metal under the regular brasserie haves ( hate that) .the only down its they not carrie more variation  in colors and more bigger size!.. ohh and get it size up ,I am 57yrs and 175lbs  I'm wide back,and I get xxl and fit perfect for me..."
5.0,such a great buy for stocking stuffers
5.0,Very confy
5.0,Fine summer dress
5.0,These are my new daily wear earrings. They look great and go with every thing I wear. I love how comfortable they are. I never have to take them off. A flat botton like serface is on the front and back so there are no sharpe points to poke and stick yourself with. The fronts screw into the backs and stay on without and fear of coming undone and losing one. They all have a nice high shine finish that I haven't had any issues with. They are very well made and fit and look great. I really like them and usually just keep a pair on until a special occasion . I like the black ones the most since the  black finish  is harder to find and matches every outfit I own and its great for day and night. I bought this three piece earring set at a discount to try them out and to write my honest feedback and review.
5.0,"Love these! Fit great, very comfortable! I wouldn't say they compress but maybe if you size down from your regular size they might compress. I bought what I usually am, a large."
5.0,I workout regularly and really like the high waiste.
5.0,Exactly what I needed! Was afraid of the earrings being too small but they're perfect. Thanks!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d3d06af3c9a4f0b4c30471dda35e16ff]] I've been reviewing King Will's tungsten rings for a couple of weeks now and these are about the finest wedding bands/ intimate rings made out of tungsten you can buy.<br /><br />In the video, you'll see how this size 9.5 fits me perfectly.<br /><br />P.S.  On a side note, another reviewer by the name of ""Dust Storm"" made a wonderful observation about ""Comfort Fit"" and the process of polishing the inside and rounding the edges so that the ring slides on and off comfortably.  That most certainly is the case.<br /><br />Handsome looking ring."
5.0,"Wife loved this bag as a cheap replacement of a more expensive bag that didn't hold up very well.  The leather is a bit shiny - of moderate quality, but for the price it works.  It seems durable and is a good size."
5.0,My son said this was his favorite birthday gift. Colors are in point. Material is quality.
5.0,"Fit perfect, Great quality"
5.0,"I have a lot less eye strain with these glasses while on my iPad. The glasses are a bit big for my face, but my fault not researching the size first."
5.0,Bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! Fits perfectly over sweaters or long sleeves. Great for winter/spring/and fall. She loves it!
5.0,I don't think got nearly as much sweet running down into my face into my eyes. It's light weight. It blocks alot of sin off the back if my neck too
5.0,will be perfect for airplane travel
5.0,Excellent quality and easy to clean. Hair does not stick!
5.0,"Fit great, and so comfortable!"
5.0,I get so many compliments on these earrings. They are comfortable and don’t feel flimsy at all. Highly recommend!
5.0,"Nice ring for the price. Delicate and realistic sparkle. Ordered a size 8 and it does tend to turn not spin on my finger, but I don't mind because at least I can get it over my knuckle. I have worn it to do dishes and in the shower and the color has been maintained and all stones have stayed in place. I am happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Nice shirt, soft, not itchy and it's the perfect size!"
5.0,My daughter loves these! Wore them for trick or treating. Lit up bright and worked great the whole night!
5.0,Fast service.  Looks as advertised
5.0,"This small bag feels so good to the touch, the color is beautiful and the purse is roomy yet lightweight"
5.0,It was a great costume and reasonably priced and came fast!
5.0,My 12 yr old loves these. We need to order more and now they are not available.
5.0,"I love that I can choose the intensity of the little ""zap"" I need to wake up! I put a QR code in the bathroom so I have to get up and move in order to turn it off. I wish it wasn't as heavy as it feels on my wrist, but I am actually getting used to it. I have finally found something that works!!"
5.0,Perfect for costume.
5.0,They were too big for cartilage piercing but it's up to the person if they like how it looks big. I tried it but didn't like it. Although you can use them as regular earrings so I kept them.
5.0,"Lovely scarf, I wanted this darker soft pink, happy with it."
5.0,"I am a very petite person and was using the baby bjorn, but I could not get it tight enough around my waist so the baby's weight would pull the bjorn down in the front causing her weight to rest on my neck...it was very painful.  The Moby D is perfect for me because the fit is customizable.  I was afraid that when I got it it would just be too much fabric for my tiny frame, but after it is wrapped around correctly, there is not much left over...maybe a foot that dangles to my side.  The Moby D is extremely comfortable...it feels like you are wearing a t-shirt and the baby is just sitting in the front of it.  It is also very secure.  My daughter is now 16lbs (5 months) and she isn't going anywhere after she is wrapped in it.  The only downside that I have found so far is that the silk part does tend to get small pulls in it, but I love the pattern so much that it doesn't really matter to me. I wish I had known about this sooner as I also feel it is more comfortable for the baby."
5.0,Purchased for a coworker who says this approximately 2136 times a day. She loved it!
5.0,Bought for my wife. She loves it. Fits her perfectly
5.0,A.d.o.r.a.b.l.e.
5.0,Great for maternity but will also probably wear it when I’m not pregnant. Beautiful and flattering.
5.0,"This ring is so beautiful. Everyone always makes comments about how pretty it is. The only thing is that it's a little big for a 7""."
5.0,My daughter ordered 3 coats for me to try  and this coat won hands down. I'm quite short so it is somewhat hard to find warm coats that aren't to long. This coat is very warm and comfortable.
5.0,"Gorgeous, magnificent workmanship and not too large, love these earrings!"
5.0,Nice loose fit. Very comfortable.
5.0,"Perfect for working out. I usually wear a small, but went up to a medium. It’s lightweight and loose fitting and a great deal for 3 at the cost of one!"
5.0,"Pants are very smooth and comfortable and look professional to wear to the office. If they didn’t have front pockets they would look more streamlined in my opinion, but the pockets might be useful at some point so I didn’t take away a star for them. Pants sit at belly button and legs end at or below ankle."
5.0,Other then the wait time for shipping these are great and well made.<br />I wear them in the case on my belt. It has a elastic strap that fits a belt.<br />Handy when I forget to carry my other pair when going into a store.
5.0,Great purchase! Got it as a gift for my friend and they loved it!
5.0,"Love this,very funny."
5.0,I'm 5'5 and this comes right down to my ankles.  It's soooo soft.  I just throw it in the wash with my other clothes and use 2 dryer sheets.  The material is lightweight but it holds up beautifully.  No snags or holes.  This is my second nightshirt with this company.  I just love them!
5.0,Love these shoes! They look more expensive than they are. I’m not sure how they hold up with daily wear but they aren’t our every day shoes. They still look new after wearing for an evening. Will buy more colors!
5.0,great shorts
5.0,"Great Find! I am kind of a sun-glass aficionado - I own about 6 pairs and most I have paid more than $200 each. I own Serengeti, Kaenon, Maui Jims, Costa and Oakley. But saw these on sale thinking I could leave them on my boat and figured for less than 20-bucks I could throw them away if I didn't like them. Here's the run down: Nice packaging - from the outer box they shipped in, to the soft-side zippered case. They even come with wipe cloth, soft bag (extra protection even while in soft case) and string retainer to attach to wear around your neck (if you want).<br /><br />Super lightweight, but sturdy to wear - makes me feel confident they won't fall off when moving around or bouncing on the boat. Lens seems nice and is most similar to Costa - clear and even tone throughout. Very glad I took a chance and grabbed a pair - don't hesitate, I highly recommend!"
5.0,I like these gloves. They're wearable for driving & for use with your phone. I like adjusting strap. I would recommend these gloves to my friends with-out reservation. Bravo.
5.0,"Boxed very nice, nice and sturdy, very shiny.  It it for a gift so I am sure she will love it.  Should not have to be required to write 14 letters required .....silly"
5.0,My kids really like the gnome. Happy that I switched from the elf this year. The story is really cute also. The fact you don’t have to move him is a parents dream. Topsy is what our new Christmas friends is named. It’s a good size very well made.  Happy with this purchase. Would recommend.
5.0,Tight fight for hiking
5.0,I read the reviews and based on that I ordered medium. But I usually wear a women's small. Should have ordered the smalls. Really nice tank tops though!
5.0,My 4&6 yr old kids love the effects of these glasses!
5.0,My girlfriend loves it.... that's all that matters to me
5.0,I bought them for Christmas for my little brother perfect and came in a very classy box I love it and it came faster then I thought LOVE IT
5.0,Daughter bought this as a gift and we were delighted with the details and beauty of this little pendant. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,This shirt fit as advertised. It was a must have after rotator cuff surgery. It snaps all the way open for easy on and off. Washed up nicely and the material feels comfortable against the skin even when worn under a sling.
5.0,Silky!!!!! Will be buying more
5.0,good price light weight boot fits well.
5.0,I love this band! it also came with a protective case/cover. Love it! got the red and black one
5.0,This dress was perfect.
5.0,"Big deal. This is a wallet window, They get dirty the wallet is still good so you buy one of these. It is a good price and they are the same quality as the original that came with the wallet. Gets the job done."
5.0,Love the material!!! Stretchy and comfortable
5.0,NICE COLOR AND CLASSY
5.0,"I love this wallet! I just wish the zipper came in silver on the black wallet (or any color for that matter) but oh well, still love it!"
5.0,very good material
5.0,"Good quality. I'm 5'4"" and usually wear a large, but this large is about 6""+ too long. If I were taller I'd love this skirt. I tried it as a dress, as suggested, but the waist panel smashes my boobs. So, I don't know. It's a great skirt, I'm just too short."
5.0,"I have not worn this dress yet, as it is waiting to be worn in daughters wedding soon......with some added color, of course....pearls,  corsage?, etc..  But Very lovely.  Lace is soft--I love that.  Dress has a bit of stretch as well, which is nice.  However, is quite long.  Will have to cut some off to not drag on ground--I am 5'5&#34;. I don't think I'll need to hem it though unless it starts to curl up or something weird like that from lack of weight to hold in place.  It right now, there's not really a hem in it."
5.0,Super cute hat!
5.0,I loooooove this dress so much! I ordered one in a different color. I am plus size and this has a nice stretch to it.
5.0,Nice and cushy
5.0,"I purchased the words Cheer and Coach for my daughter's end of season team gift.  We have 2 teams so I bought a word for each team to sign.  I had went back and forth about buying 1 or 2 words due to the price but I am glad I chose to purchase 2 words.  The words are a nice size for display.  We were able to fit 14 names on the word Coach, and have room for additional names, if needed.  I was worried because (the girls range from 4 years old to 12) we wouldn't have enough room for all of them to sign it but even with the Littles writing their names HUGE we were still able to sign the words on the front side and the names were all legible!  The words are not heavy weight but they aren't meant be.  They are adorable for display purposes and for making a Coach cry because she loved them! 😉😊  I did listen to the reviews and did not purchase the pens.  I instead bought gold metallic sharpies (our colors are green and gold) which worked well and made the names ""pop"".  Great Coach's gift!!!  I would recommend anyone looking for a sentimental Coach gift to look past the price and purchase these!!!"
5.0,Excellent thanks
5.0,"Muy bonito, casual y acogedor me gustó mucho la tela suave y con buena caída, el color muy bien mejor que en la foto."
5.0,This watch is amazing. I love wearing this and it makes a great gift with my friends. It's very durable and awesome.
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.
5.0,great looking necklace for the marvel fan!!
5.0,The fit and the view!
5.0,Arrive in a timely manner and as described. Excellent quality for the price. 100% silk. Would recommend to anyone over the super expensive in-store brands.
5.0,I Love everything about this bathing suit it’s very well made for the price
5.0,I have purchased several of these. I love them. I hand them out to people I think need it. It gives me comfort just sitting in my pocket
5.0,Really like these.  Doesn't distort my vision like others.
5.0,An exceptional and reliable timepiece that will stand the test of time without a doubt. The MTG line IMO is better than the MRG line in terms of value and easy to read dials.
5.0,Great item. Great colors.
5.0,"Awesome dress! I love AX Paris dresses - very comfortable material and makes you look thin as well. The straps are spaghetti-style and elastic, but gives a different look."
5.0,Came quick. Nice quality. Made really well for value
5.0,Purchased as a Christmas gift for my great granddaughter who loves pink flamingos. Seemed to be well made and very nice. She loved it.
5.0,Bracelets work well. Great seller
5.0,Beautiful headband style design .
5.0,wife loved the feel but it was a half size too large.  Amazon made the exchange easy of course.
5.0,Five Stars
5.0,My husband is a Marine Veteran and he loves this Challenge Coin.  He collects them as well as he gives them to other Marines.
5.0,Super cute!!! Perfect gift for girls who love cheerleading!
5.0,So pretty. My daughter loved it!
5.0,"Love, love this dress.  It was a little big in the bust, but easy to fix with a needle and thread.  I bought this for a dance number I'm doing in a show case, and it's perfect.  I'm 5'1, 119 lbs. and I got the medium."
5.0,"I wear a HH bra so I didn't expect a halter style to work for me, but this one did! It's bra-sized so the halter doesn't put pressure on your neck to hold up the chest. The crochet material is pretty sturdy and it's a nice top that feels conservative, but looks pretty sexy. I liked it so much that I bought it in two colors!"
5.0,Loved it very pretty so glad I bought it.  Very nice for formal events.  Well made and comes with extra links to adjust to your wrist.
5.0,"I love this top, I'd absolutely buy the rest of the other colors."
5.0,Received the dress today I'm 150lbs and ordered a medium it fits nice but I could have probably ordered a small but its still cute.
5.0,"I purchased this watch for myself, but my son has worn it every day since it arrived. Beautiful does not truly describe this watch. Everything about this watch yells perfection! Best of all is that it keeps great time."
5.0,Bought this for my wife and she looks fantastic in it!
5.0,"OMG it looked tiny in the package, but I bought up TWO sizes to fit my size medium niece (about size 7 normally).<br />She absolutely loves it!<br />The cats, now so much.<br />She's training the cats (two) to voluntarily (i.e. with treats) come up and sit in the pocket.<br />It's great for sitting, but not so much for standing or walking, as the pouch gapes open when she is upright.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a hit. A bit crazy, but a hit nonetheless"
5.0,"To say that I have been looking for sunglasses with dark enough lenses is an understatement. This pair of oversized polarized sunglasses by Macjero are of very good quality and come with a drawstring pouch and cleaning cloth.<br /><br />They are super comfortable and are suitable for either men or women.  The lenses are big and dark enough that you will filter out most of the light that can harm your eyes and keep you from squinting which, of course,, isn't good for the aging process."
5.0,I really was very pleased & it was perfect fit for my grandson!!!
5.0,These shirts look beautiful and fits tailored.  They have a youthful mature look.  I love when my husband wears them!
5.0,These are very cute and soft. They are made out of soft stretchy fabric. They are a little big for my 3 month old but she'll grow into them.
5.0,I used these for a trip to London in December. It was freeeeezing and they kept me nice and warm while still being able to use my touch screen on my phone for pics/gps. Super fashionable as well. Definitely recommend :)
5.0,Love this pure pink with all my summer staples!! Worn here with mint linen!
5.0,These earrings are fantastic.  Exactly what I wanted large and lots of spikes!
5.0,These earrings are so pretty and they’re pretty lightweight which is even better! The perfect summer earrings. They’ll look good on anyone.
5.0,I will reorder again love these Lil twisted canvas shoes
5.0,"I love the fact that these socks are not expensive, they have a high percentage of merino wool, and they’re warm - oh so warm."
5.0,"The dress is beautiful, very well made and the fabric material doesn't look cheap at all.. I ordered a size XL which I usually use and it fit perfect. Around the shoulders it has like a rubber that will help stay in place<br />😁"
5.0,"Funny looks. What could that mean,still loveing it"
5.0,"This is a really nice necklace for a casual look. Size it is not adjustable, however the length is very reasonable. It is a little heavy due to all the stones, but nothing that will make you feel tired at the end on the day.<br />The color combination looks amazing, beige on the small beads, green on the biggest stone, plus the brown leather.<br />This brand has very good quality in all their products, I am really happy with them.<br />I just wish there were matching earrings for this necklace."
5.0,"I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, she loved it and it's really nice quality."
5.0,"I bought the Ice Blue. I'm too cheap to buy prescription sunglasses. These work fine for my purposes, I keep them in the car. It's important to measure your glasses to see if they will fit as expected. I suspect some of the negative reviews came from people who didn't measure correctly."
5.0,Cleans extremely well you don’t really even need a washing machine and even took blood out of timberlands which was there for a year and a half which was super impressive
5.0,Granddaughter loves her new shoes and her mom loves them too!
5.0,It was exactly as described. Love this dress.
5.0,I'm so glad I got these! They keep my legs so warm during cold weather. Only thing is that the nude colored ones make me look like I have mannequin legs. 😂
5.0,"Best buy of the year for me. I Love it. The robe is super comfortable, not sheer or clingy. I am a big woman 5'8"", 200 lbs. and It fits true to size and falls gracefully hiding the bumps.  Actually makes me look thinner. I washed it in warm water and line dried and it came out fine. The seams and workmanship are quality, not the junk we see so much of now. This is a winner!"
5.0,"Just gave this to my young adult son to take to office for his first “real” job! Looks great, smells so great, soft, classy- good for all ages! But, he loves it and it’s really cool looking. Wouldn’t hold an oversized laptop- but perfect for his standard issue size!<br />Don’t know about durability yet, as just got it. Seems well made/stitched."
5.0,"They are very comfortable, can wear them to walk all day long without getting tired feet. It's easy to put them on and take off. But have not had a chance to test if it's waterproof or not."
5.0,Fitted as I expected😁
5.0,"I ordered these tanks and although I am regularly a small, went with other buyers' reviews and ordered a size up (medium) which was perfect. The tanks are cute, and they fit just fine. They're comfy too :). Overall, a great buy."
5.0,"Used for work, can be dressed up to look nice enough for work and this color is a nice spring/summer color. Comfortable but not super dressy. I love wearing dresses and feeling comfortable but also well put together and I feel I achieved that with this dress. Definitely recommend. I did have it shortened bc although I like the maxi look it was way too long on me but I have a lot of my clothes tailored so It was worth it to me."
5.0,Wonderful arms are not too tight like some other laces they have room to move and things I love it
5.0,I never take it off! This is my second purchase because I lost the other one.
5.0,Great shirt.  I ordered one size larger since others commented it might run a little small.
5.0,My daughter birthday
5.0,"I received this bag as a gift about a year ago. I use it just about everyday for work. As a teacher, I often need to carry my planner and iPad back and forth. The larger bag is perfect for all the files and paperwork while I use the smaller bag as my purse. It's convenient not having to switch purses between work and going out or having to transfer all my purse items back and forth between bags. The material is sturdy and pretty easy to clean. There are enough pockets in both bags for smaller items but not overwhelming so you can't find things. Overall I'm very happy with the bags. The only thing is that the straps on the smaller purse are a tad long for me. Perhaps a few more holes would allow short people like me (5'1&#34;) to adjust it for my height."
5.0,"Very nice, would buy again in another color."
5.0,"Nice Colors, fits well, I can breath, PROTECTION."
5.0,My niece loved this hoodie.
5.0,"It is a great product, very sturdy, good quality, and I love the design."
5.0,"I loved it! Fits just as expected. Yes, it is a little long but it is a perfect coverup!"
5.0,"New to authentic Lederhosen. Phenomenal quality throughout, though arrived with a broken horn button (seller, please ensure quality in details plus provide extra waist buttons before sending)! Gorgeous deep rich loden color. Great workmanship and embroidery. Love the pockets! I did have to punch a couple more holes to shorten suspenders. Would rather have had second alternative button cuts in front straps to keep cross piece lower, not hiked up toward neck. So beautiful, deserves authentic hat, shirt, socks, and shoes to accompany. Expect a lifetime of wear. Highly recommend."
5.0,Wonderful product. This is the second one I purchased.  Great quality and lots of room for cards and I'D. Love it.
5.0,"A Blessing and Gift, Perfect!  Great Product and Seller, Thank You!"
5.0,LOVE THESE GLASSES PERFECT FOR MY GOLF GAME AND A STYLISH ACCESSORY.
5.0,Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it ! Fast shipping and the material is so soft she wears it all the time ordered a size large and it fits perfectly  ! Deff  Recommend this sweater !
5.0,My niece love her dress shoes
5.0,"These are incredible! First of all, they are incredibly comfortable. I feel so confident when I wear them.  Secondly, they don't attract pet hair or lint or anything! They always look great. I bought six pairs."
5.0,works wonderful
5.0,They keep my arms and hands warm. It is easy to get on. It is easy to transport from your bag to a purse or in your pocket for easy access and you can wash and dry them without a fuss.
5.0,"I love these pants, bought a second pair in the grey. Worth the money"
5.0,"This bag is very cute, bigger than expected with a pocket on the inside! Can’t wait to take it to the beach."
5.0,Looks great on.. Fits and feels wonderful<br />I have gotten so many compliments
5.0,Nice and long and very soft.
5.0,This necklace is beautiful! I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I opened the package but this way exceeded my expectations. I wear this necklace often and get many compliments when I do!
5.0,"one of few company's that will work with you, great designs and art, would highly recommend there shorts and there customer service is fantastic."
5.0,I am 5'6. 190lbs. 38DDD. I ordered an extra large. It fits perfectly!!!
5.0,Perfect size. I’ve been looking for a belly ring that didn’t have the bottom ball but the same size as the top. Love this!
5.0,Love these. I ordered a large and they fit a little snug.  They feel great.  They have all the protection needed.
5.0,Bought mine in 2014 and used it every day. It finally started to get tattered enough to consider replacing it. But now I can't find one even like it. It was the perfect design and construction.
5.0,"I bought the Toyota Tundra key chain and it looks great!<br />Very nice,very elegant finish. Mr.Ayala"
5.0,"I really like these shoulder pads, they are comfortable, easy to use and look good, appearing natural under my blouses. They use a quality Velcro loop that is very effective in staying in place on the bra strap and move very little under garments. They are a substantial thickness, but not excessively thick. They are just a bit wider than I expected for a “petite” product, and are sometimes visible under wide necked blouses, but look beautiful under normal necklines and especially pretty underneath  sweaters. They are a quality product at a reasonable price."
5.0,"Great quality, breathability,and easy clean and dry. Affordable price. Have other Spyder brand apparel, very happy with all of i have purchased."
5.0,Nice Support. Not as aggressive as other products
5.0,Its a cool shirt for the summer for my dogs.
5.0,Very nice wallet I like it..
5.0,Love my skirt and can't wait to wear on my birthday.
5.0,Too freaking cute!
5.0,A nice variety
5.0,Good mask good price
5.0,Beautiful dress but too large.  Had to send it back.
5.0,"This product runs large, so size 1 down.  I've purchased 6 of these dresses and love them ALL!! BEST GO TO COMFORT DRESS EVER!! You'll love it too!!"
5.0,"This is great! Keeps dust and stuff off my large sports sunglasses. Sturdy, but not crushproof."
5.0,"I got this for my niece who absolutely loves this watch, it is well made and beautiful."
5.0,"Sick hat, I wear it everyday, if your from the 603 please dont buy one cause as of now I seem to be the only one who has one and I'd like to keep it that way."
5.0,"Very nice gloves. Fit well, size 8 glove, ordered extra large; they fit well. Recommended."
5.0,"This shipped fast and I got so many compliments on it. The quality and color are good. The band is small. It fit me because I have small wrists, but be aware of that if you typically need a larger band. Also, the face is glass. I dropped it and shattered it, so be careful!!"
5.0,Lightweight and comfortable. Would buy again
5.0,"Gave it as a present to my aunt, she loves it!"
5.0,"Soft and light material, fits perfectly, and I get endless compliments. I ended up buying most of the other colors as well. I bought a Small and I'm 135 lbs with 34-32-42 measurements.<br />Belt sold separately."
5.0,Absolutely loved it but discovered a whole in it
5.0,This bracelet is very cute and was so inexpensive.  I am so glad that I ordered several.  Nautical is a great look for the summer.
5.0,GREAT BRACELET!!!! Gotten a lot of compliments!!! Very well made...nice looking and fits great!!
5.0,It is a little smaller than needed but it fits and I love it. Looks very good with jeans.
5.0,Muy cómodas y ligeras
5.0,So cute on! Has a side zipper that I didn't see at first - I got a medium and I wear a size 10  w/36C - it fits like a glove!!! Love it

5.0,Kept me dry and was durable! I will buy again!
5.0,"i bought these for myself for christmas, and i love them.  it was my 7th or 8th purchase of michal negrin earrings.  i wanted a pair that doesn't dangle since i have some winter sweaters with big turtle necks, and the stud-type earrings don't catch on the collar.  these are a perfect size -- very visible yet not too big.  comfortable and well-made.  the stones are gorgeous, and the colors are attractive.  my friends know i like good jewelry, so they thought these earrings were pink and green tourmaline.  like all the pictures of the negrin earrings, they do not accurately show the beauty of these pieces.  packaging is so pretty if you are giving them as gifts; lovely presentation."
5.0,oh my goodness this is sooo cute! my 2yr old grdgrl fits in it perfectally and will be able to grow into it as she gets older

5.0,As a gift to my sister for her swelling legs.  They were a good value and are helping as advertised.
5.0,"Just what I was looking for! It holds everything I need: Credit cards, driver's license, and cash, all in the front pocket. No need for a bulging wallet in the rear pocket.<br /><br />The new chip cards can be used by pushing it part-way out to insert the chip-end into the card reader. When done, just push it back into place and put it into your pocket. The stretch band located in the middle allows you to do this. It's a perfect package."
5.0,perfect fit and very comfortable! Easy to install on watch
5.0,I had bought these earrings before and lost one. Happy to have a pair again. Aloha
5.0,"Love these. Easy to wear and wash, light weight"
5.0,I love it!!  Well made and fits flat on my finger.  Big sterling presence and thick enough to be strong. Perfect size. I always size up one size for wide band rings. Got size 9. Very happy.
5.0,Good price and just what I wanted for a fun bag!  Has lots of nice compartments and is just the right size.
5.0,This is the most comfortable hat and it really does help with staying warm. Ive got so many compliments that I'm surprised I still have it because everyone wants it! I tell them Amazon is the place to get it!
5.0,LOVE THIS!!!!! The quality of this bag feels like it’s worth $100+. It feels and looks like a designer bag. I love that the bottom and sides are sturdy and do not fall over. The leather feels soft to touch though even with the firm sides. Fantastic quality.
5.0,Helps my posture.
5.0,"Love the jacket, but it was too big.  Will buy a smaller size when I reorder"
5.0,Great quality!!Very satisfied 😌
5.0,I got a pair of patriotic crocs and searched for these charms. These were among the least expensive and worked just fine. Highly recommend. I liked them because they had duplicates so you could put the same charms on each shoe if you wanted to.
5.0,"These are inexpensive, not cheap. They fit right in my band, spring easy and fluid. They hold tight on my smartwatch but not so tight it's a fight to remove the band when needed. They feel premium and the spring mechanism isn't wiggly and lose like other quick release bars.  I will also add that customer service is fantastic. There was an issue with my order, and after an email to them they responded quickly with a resolution to the issue. Thank you Barton for the excellent customer service and great product! Very happy with these."
5.0,beautiful for the cincinnati pride festival.. she will be the bell of the ball

5.0,Great product! Thx👍🏻😃
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c86bf101dcccae525dec67ba2d5eefc3]] If ya looking for something to sparkle this is it. It is pure shine. Weight is hefty. Feels like the real deal and looks even better. I almost passed this up because of the different chains in the pictures. For the price U can’t go wrong. I have very sensitive skin I sometimes break out with real jewelry when it’s very hot. I have worn all this pieces, sometimes to sleep, I have never had aN issue with breakouts and color changes.<br />I do feel like they start to lose a bit of shine once U wear repeatedly. I will clean a piece and let U know how that goes. For the time being and I have been wearing GLD pieces for about a year with no major problems. Get it, no don’t, 🤔 maybe I should keep this a secret. Lol"
5.0,It’s very attractive and  realistic looking.
5.0,Like the stainless steel material. it should not tarnish like brass. A bit on the large side.
5.0,"Big, comfy sweater - nice for cold weather!"
5.0,Not for me but my girlfriend was having a blast whereing them around. Actually look cool if you don't see the space that goes around the ear.
5.0,I used this for another purpose.<br />The toenail on my big right toe became a casualty of the pandemic: Cut it too close to the nail bed when my toe nail grew out.<br />This helped make my toe a little bit more comfortable until I saw the podiatrist.<br />Thanks seller and amazon!
5.0,This is a gift. Very nice product.
5.0,"excellent strap, just like the original."
5.0,This shirt was purchased as a gift for son.

5.0,se devolvio por la talla
5.0,Received in great condition!!
5.0,I have been wearing this earring wrap along with the antiqued one every day and they are both very comfortable.
5.0,"The quality, color and elegance of the bag was attractive and practical."
5.0,"I like that this item is very comfortable yet flattering. It washed well on regular cycle and laying flat to dry. Could probably be dried, but I chose to dry flat. It for as expected. I'm 5'5"" and 167lbs. I bought a large."
5.0,Super cute and well made. Looked perfect with my new pink & yellow dress.
5.0,"Great patterns, comfy, and good price. They were not overly thin. Good buy. I have not washed any of the pairs yet, but I plan to either dry them on low heat or air dry on a rack."
5.0,"The image on Amazon does not reflect the satin finish. Tag on tie states $47.50 ""all silk"", if true its definitely a great value. I'm very satisfied."
5.0,"The best replacement springbar I have ever used, equal to the original swiss springbars that come with all the major brands."
5.0,"Amazing quality, especially for this price. Though it did nit come with the mask or other waist accessory. Its very comfortable and doesn’t itch at all even after a couple hours of wearing it! It is a bit tight on my upper thighs/hips but I’m also just a weird pants size lol"
5.0,"Comes in handy, they work well.  I use them at job sites, don’t need to bring extra readers anymore!"
5.0,Perfect to make granddaughter  happy
5.0,I was super skeptical but this has become one of my favorite shirts now! It's so cute and flattering. I'm glad I sized up though (usually a medium and I grabbed a large).
5.0,"This is perfect for the iphone 6 plus, with room for lipstick, credit cards & keys!"
5.0,"My 8 year old loves this thing.  Thinks she's a fairy that can call the wind now.  However, we did buy one for a friend and the necklace broke.  But she still loves it nonetheless."
5.0,These are awesome!! I love them! So cute & adore all the detail. worth the small price!
5.0,Fits great! Love it &amp; wear it all the time.
5.0,"I bought the ‘maroon’ and ‘dark green’. Neither color is adequately described but I love them both. They do have a faded quality, so there is little to no color saturation. I’m having an impossible time naming the green one, so I’m attaching a photo taken outdoors to help (one without direct sunlight and one with). The ‘maroon’ is absolutely not maroon and is more of a dusty rose, I think, or a light, light burgundy. Both are understated and fairly neutral due to the faded look.<br /><br />Now for function! Amazing!!! There’s a big gap in the back. Get over it, it’s there for a reason! This is going to be my forever hot-weather work hat. I work outdoors doing dirty, sweaty stuff so the right hat is especially important. This fits the bill. Finally something made for me, not a dude! I have hair dammit. Pulling it to shreds to get it in a hat, and trying in vain not to look all saggy has never been a pleasant task, but you gotta do what you gotta do right? Wrong!<br /><br />I love the gap in the back, because not only does it give me room for hair it gives me room for styling too. What a revelation! I can use a hair pin or clip with this, instead of those hateful little hair-breaking bands. And it’s going to be much, much cooler by not confining all that heat and sweat on my head. I’ve tried so many hats, and none of them really work for what I do when it’s hot. So now I don’t have to walk around looking like I’m ready for a round of golf, while keeping dirt off my head and not having a heat stroke. Yay! I haven’t tested that theory yet, but I’m pretty darn confident this will work.<br /><br />Quality? Check! It has an attractive, functional buckle fastener in the back with a hidden compartment for slack. The seams are good, nothing loose. Everything looks properly reinforced. The band above the bill is thick and has multiple lines of stitch. And it’s all monotone, no icky white peaking out at your forehead. This is a solid hat!!! I’ve been fooled before on here, so I don’t say this lightly. I hope that doesn’t change. Maybe I should buy more, just in case. Can’t find these anywhere else. Why???"
5.0,"I bought 2 much needed night gowns. The set was supposed to be purple & mint .The mint color is blue — the purple is purple though ,but a light purple .. No real problem ,I just want customers to know about the colors !"
5.0,Clearly not a Rolex or a Tudor but really great design with classy features. I highly recommend this watch!
5.0,Very nice earrings.  I didn't have any problem with breaking out.
5.0,This is great for a dressy outfit exactly what i needed to a Gala event. Not chinsey looking at all.
5.0,Good looking beanie
5.0,Love the fabric and fit perfectly.
5.0,"I am replacing the one i got Nov 2015,i carry it every day.i work in building up keep,so I do all sorts of jobs and my wallet never gets in the way,sweat has not ruined it , nor dirt,snow paint.caulk,oil .It just wore out,so I am happily buying another"
5.0,style and comfort
5.0,Happy shoe and students
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:da760a34894c9c78f4781a864a95cf25]] I hate the look of fitness bands, and this one is about as un-sporty as I’ve found. It’s metal, and a little bit narrower than the Fitbit, so it looks as much like a real watchband as possible. Very easy to slip on and off with the magnetic band, and it’s more adjustable. I’ve only been wearing it for a day, but it looks like it will be durable and easy to clean. The band that came with my Fitbit was ugly and broke after 3 months. I think sunblock degraded the plastic. The lavender Fitbit band is nice, but gets grimy quick, and never looks as good as it did, even after cleaning."
5.0,"Love the shirt, but it's a bit snug."
5.0,This Vera Bradley lunchbox is exactly as it was described.  It is perfect for my middle school daughter to take her lunch every day to school instead of waiting in the ridiculous long lunch line.  I got it in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime!
5.0,Just got this 2day i was amazed how big it was when i open the package its like 3 inchs very happy with it i love it :)
5.0,I love these socks! I bought them for myself. I wore them directly out of the package and they are super comfortable. The foot has a hugging type feel to it and the colors are bright and beautiful. There is no fading into each color. They wash well and did not shrink or fuzz up. Very happy with these socks!
5.0,beautiful choker just what I needed to complete my outfit!
5.0,"I had to purchase these for my job and it worked out great! You could hardly tell I had a piercing, highly recommended."
5.0,"Loved it, it's very elegant!"
5.0,"I purchased these for raves and they are amazing.  There is no real padding around the eye area so they can make your nose a little sore if you wear them for a long time but I honestly only wear them a few minutes at a time because they can be really intense. I let my friends use them at the last massive I went to and they all loved them.  The materials are nice and sturdy, not a cheap and flimsy.  I know that I will have these for a long time.  Well worth the money."
5.0,Simple and functional. I bought this to take to a music festival where they were enforcing a pocket rule. My camelbak has too many pockets.<br /><br />It holds a TON of water. The straps are pretty comfortable and after fed the tube through one of the rings on the strap it stayed in place pretty well. The pocket it does have is located between the bladder and my back so it felt pretty secure. I’m not sure I’d love this for sports where you need it as a backpack also but it was great for how I wanted to use it. The only thing I don’t like is the bite valve is a little tight. You really have to work to get water out unless you bite just right. The on/off system is nice though and I didn’t have leak issues.
5.0,"Beautiful, couldn’t be more pleased."
5.0,It’s very pretty and heavy I’m hoping that one of my daughters will get married so they can wear it.
5.0,Beautiful necklaces.
5.0,I'm a size 14-16 / weights 180 lbs. / SIZE  - fit as expected
5.0,They’re super cute.. aimed more for children tho..
5.0,"Happy with my purchase. The material is reasonably thick, does not look cheaply made. I usually wear a size M in tops and ordered the same. Fit perfectly."
5.0,Pefect for the Totoro Lover .
5.0,Not only is the design extremely cute but these are so soft and extremely comfy! I was afraid that they would be a little tight but they for perfect. I'm a size 12 and I'm the process of losing weight. The best thing? They fit now and I believe they'll fit just as well when I get to my idea weight! Love!
5.0,"This purse caught my eye on Amazon, and I had to get it.  It was a great purchase, I am thoroughly satisfied!  It is BEAUTIFUL; the colors are true to what I saw on Amazon, and the size is perfect - not too small or large.  I expect to get a lot of good wear out of it.  Well worth purchasing!"
5.0,The band is very durable so far.  I've worn it every day for a couple of months now.  This fit perfectly on my Seiko 5 canvas watch.  I had the black-dial/black-strap version and this green strap makes it go with much more outfits.  I would definitely recommend it.
5.0,Really nice panties.  Light control is exactly what I needed.  They are very comfortable for all day wear.
5.0,Loved the quality and it looks and feels like the real deal .
5.0,really satisfied
5.0,I like the color and style.I have no dislike.

5.0,Very cute little jacket. Keeps my arms covered and makes a nice accent.
5.0,I just got it for a Fran Bow cosplay and it is wonderful
5.0,My grandson was crazy about these socks. He wears them all the time.<br />Came just in time.
5.0,"The onesies are really cute, given as a gift. Items are as advertised and arrived promptly."
5.0,its perfect
5.0,So far it is holding up. I did cover it with a protective sealant.
5.0,Even more beautiful than the pics! It needs better backs to support the earring but they are too gorgeous to care..I just stole some backs from another pair of earrings.
5.0,Super adorable for my 3 year old granddaughter!!! She loves them!
5.0,I thought this is by volume but the edge isa few centimeters narrower than mac and binder.but the bag is really beautiful
5.0,Given as a gift. They loved it!
5.0,"Great service, fast shipment and exactly as described!"
5.0,"This beautiful 3 piece shoulder/handbag is very nice.  I usually carry much smaller purses, but i wanted this large one for when I need to carry many things for the entire day such as my I pad, books, magazines etc. along with my usual purse items. The handbag is made of Faux Leather and seems like very good quality in the fabric and in the stitching It has golden magnetic clasps. The one i received is red, but it came in a total of twelve colors so there should be a color for everyone.  This hand bag measures 12.9&#34;X9.8&#34;X5.51&#34;(L*H*W),Srtap :7&#34;.<br />Charming & Stylish Bag. The other two bags that come with it can be used alone or to help organize the largest bag. I received this set of three shoulder/handbags at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. i do recommend this handbag."
5.0,This is exactly what I needed for my wrist! Small and dainty. Love the motivation
5.0,"perfect for workout.  great color, lightweight, comfortable and  attractive."
5.0,"Bought to give as a gift, but I kept it!"
5.0,Love this shirt. Its soft & fits as expected. I am usually a medium and ordered this in XL because I wanted a loose fitting shirt to wear with leggings.
5.0,I bought this with another bean necklace with another multicolored freshwater pearl necklace. I always wear them both. The beads are flat and smooth and lay well.
5.0,"I LOVE this scarf. It makes a superb gift, guaranteed!!!"
5.0,"This butterfly pin is good quality, has awesome vivid colors. Daughter uses on her server’s apron to engage customers. So pretty I wanted to keep it for myself."
5.0,"I was looking for a pair of black pants with rips in the knees and found these on amazon. I read the reviews and decided to order them. I don't regret one bit paying $50 for them. They fit my 28"" waist perfectly and don't fall down. Most of the time with jeans I have to get a size that will fit my bigger butt and not my waist, but this pair of jeans fits both!! The material is super stretchy and make me feel like I could do yoga, rock climbing, rollerskating, or even run a marathon in them and they would not fall down or stretch out in the butt/ knees. I would recommend these pants to everyone!!!!!"
5.0,"These pieces are versatile, and very on-trend.  These are great for the price!"
5.0,Washed well kept shape
5.0,"high quality cottom, beautiful red color... a Jack Wolfskin quality, 100% recommended"
5.0,I was looking for a longer Capri legging and these are perfect. I also didn't want too tight a fit. So after reading the reviews I ordered an extra large and couldn't be more pleased. Perfect fit for me.
5.0,My husband likes this belt I love that it can adjust to about any size you want it to. And of course it's cooler than just your run of the mill belt.
5.0,Love these earring and get lots of positive responses.
5.0,I love this! It is soft and beautiful and truly NO ONE has one like it! I love this Vera Bradley!
5.0,Cool design and colors. Kid loved it.

5.0,True to description. The material is very nice. I would definitely but again.
5.0,this is such a kool piece. very original! thanks for the quick delivery.
5.0,Nice and sturdy straps. Pretty birght colors fit perfectly
5.0,This inside feels nice planning on buying another one ve
5.0,The material is stretchy and 👌 just right!!
5.0,"The main point I want to make here is that both of the 1 star reviews apparently do not realize that this is a tote that folds down to a satchel, exactly as pictured. I would hate for someone to not buy based on those reviews, especially when the price tag on this bag was waaaay more than what it costs here. There are little tabs on the bottom sides, and clasps on the top sides, to do this. I was thrilled to get this purse for Christmas. The color is beautiful, it's plenty roomy, it's multifunctional since it does work as a tote or satchel, and it has a long strap or the short handles to carry. My only complaint (and it's a small one!) is that the zipper is really stiff, and I tend to scratch my hand going in and out if I'm not careful."
5.0,"Yes, these ARE genuine malachite beads and there is a macramé slip-knot for a clasp, it just takes a bit of patience to get on,  I am very happy with this product."
5.0,"Absolutely love this purchase. I bought it for a carry on bag on my flights. Has pockets for everything, very sturdy. I never switched back to my purse, I just bring my bag everywhere<br />I don’t know about the water resistance aside from the cooler side pocket is not water right, ice melted and ran straight through."
5.0,"It does run large but it is long which makes the fit very flattering. Well made and nice material. I will be ordering again, in a few other colors!"
5.0,I am 5'7 205lbs about a 38 C and the KL fit great. Sits right at the hips
5.0,MY G/F WORE IT AND SHE LOVES THE PRODUCT. GREAT FIT LOOKS LIKE A GODDESS ON HER. SHE WORE IT COMMANDO AND IT WAS WELL RECEIVED. EXCELLENT PRODUCT...
5.0,My little girl loves theses and they stay on her face!
5.0,Love the color and great fit
5.0,I love them and I think my mother in law enjoyed getting them as a gift..I love cruelty free products
5.0,"These earrings have a handcrafted look to them, but I found them attractive. The two pink agates didn't clash with my fall-colored outfit. The Mother of Pearl bit is not too heavy.  I wore these to work today hardly noticed they were there. I worried that I might have a reaction to the metal wire as sometimes happens when I wear earrings that are not gold.  But at 9 hours and counting, there's no irritation.  They seem to be well-made and the wire that goes through my ear is long enough that I don't think I'll lose these."
5.0,Fit well and very comfortable fabric.
5.0,nice！

5.0,These were so well made and quality items.
5.0,I ordered this bra and it fit perfectly! I ordered another one in tan
5.0,I did some research comparing this model with the Carry All.  It was purchased as a gift and my mom absolutely loved it.<br />It's a perfect size and the bottom is sturdy with a removable bottom.  It is a smaller version of the Carry All but just the right size to<br />fit a ton of stuff and not be too heavy or bulky.
5.0,I bought this as a birthday gift and the person loves it.
5.0,My mom absolutely loved this purse she loves butterflies and it made her birthday and the concealed pocket is perfect for her little friend she got from my father.

5.0,I really like this outfit very comfortable but a little tight around the waist and I have a flat stomach and I’m saying that but I like it for the most part
5.0,GOOD FIT ARRIVED ON TIME VERY COMFORTABLE
5.0,Soft; fit true to size; warm on bottom and cooler on top:  perfect.  Our son (just turned 10) has worn on many a chilly day post-Christmas.  AND:  his favorite:  Pokemon!
5.0,"I love the colors of this dress, very nice material , and very comfortable. Not an awkward length and you can wear it in summer because of the pretty flowers but also in fall because of the fall colors in the dress."
5.0,Cute shirt to kick around in!
5.0,"Over all, I love this dress.  It's a flattering style for my full figure.  It is a bit heavier than I expected. I have a similar dress from another seller that is 100% cotton, so I had assumed this one was the same.  Rather it is made of a heavier polyester type material.  Regardless, it is still nice."
5.0,"Great glasses, almost exact same, great quality."
5.0,The sox were are promised.  They are thin and warm.

5.0,They're good keeps my shirt in place
5.0,use this everyday!! holds everything I need
5.0,"I love this bathing suit beach dress cover up! Honestly it is what I hoped for, but didn't expect it. The material is luxurious! Super soft and silky! It's not thin or delicate, it has a nice weight to it and is perfect. It definately could be worn as a super cute summer dress w/ or w/o something underneath depending on your shape and comfort level of your body. I hate my body and hate missing out on summer events b/c of it, this dress will cover my ugly arms and legs enough for me to be comfortable and not look awkwardly over-clothed at the beach/lake/pool. It is definitely worth every penny (and is on super sale right now!), however I was lucky enough to receive this dress at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. 😊"
5.0,"Thought it was broken like another commenter, however, I decided to wind it a LOT, and it ticked for 24hrs. It runs a little fast but I LOVE this watch!(About a Minute in a 24hr period)  Its Beautiful and the only windup I have. Shipping SUCKED! It took about a month to get it. Came from China. I consider this watch worth the wait as it has become my Favorite Pocket watch(I have 5)"

5.0,"I recieve tons of compliments on these boots!! Wish I knew they ran so wide, would have gotten a half size smaller"
5.0,"Love how these fit and wear them daily. Might buy another pair just to have because they are that comfortable. Have worn them for work, on long hikes in the mountains, crossing water, etc and they never miss a beat. The break in time was mere hours for me."
5.0,I purchased a spa wrap but it was too large and bulkie.  This wrap was just right as the little bear would say.
5.0,Awesome! I just got it 2 days ago. The express delivery is very fast. I like it so much. The material is soft and flexible.  Mr. Ben
5.0,When my Grandson saw this he got the biggest smile. The wrestlers are clear and easy to see. The fit is just slightly to big but I know they will be fine. Very pleased

5.0,"This top was so cute, I purchased it in 2 colors. I bought a size L for my daughter (size 8), but I was able to fit very nice in it too at a size 14."
5.0,"A great, colorful, well-received gift. I sent this to my best friend's 5-year old granddaughter. And she loved it. She immediately put it on and started dancing around the room. It arrived on time, fit her very well, looks great, and added a lot of joy to a birthday celebration. Can't ask for more than that."
5.0,My wife loved it a lot.
5.0,"This was a, &#34;he's going to love it or hate it&#34; gift. My husband is fussy about what he likes to wear. If it isn't comfortable, forget it! I purchased this for Christmas and tossed it into the washer and dryer and then handed it to him warm from the machine. I swear if he didn't need to get dressed and go outdoors everyday he would not take it off. He loves it and honestly it is adorable on him!"
5.0,"Ok, so I'm soooooo in love with this dress!!! After I ordered it, I read more reviews and realized it would probably be too small.... or I ordered the wrong dress for what I'm looking for. BUT- I looooove this dress! For reference: I'm size 18, 5'6&#34;, about 215lbs, 38C, apple shape and I bought an XL. I was looking for a harem dress that truly billowed out at the hips, and I'm sure this one will a little more once I lose another 30-40 lbs, lol! Right now, it skims over my body, hugging the curvy spots, and just barely skimming over my &#34;problem&#34; area (tummy/waist) and falling straight down from the widest part of my thighs. I do wear my new &#34;Homma Women's Tummy Control Fitness Workout Running Bike Shorts Yoga Shorts&#34; (which I love!) to feel a bit better if I forget to suck in my stomach, lol. Because this dress will show my tummy rolls with my apple shape when I'm not sucking in/wearing my shorts, but that will go away more and more as I lose weight. And I feel like I can wear this dress now, and still be able to when I'm 3 or 4 sizes smaller- it will just be a looser style at that point, which is fine! The top: it hits me in front just low enough to feel feminine, but not actually show anything- in the back it's low but I wear it with my cute new crisscross strappy yoga bra and it's sooooo cute! Oh- and it is definitely long- it skims the floor on me (5'6&#34;) while barefoot/in flip flops, but I can still walk without getting tripped up. It's the kind of length that feels super sexy, and I'd be fine walking around with it in a clean-ish area, but if I were anywhere dusty/dirty I'd be holding up my hem, lol! I'm looking forward to wearing this on dates, or wine tasting, or to any family events. Or maybe just the grocery store, lol!"
5.0,Great scarves for the price!
5.0,Very nice and pretty
5.0,I’ve had the hardest time finding good pants for bartending. These maintain their shape and move with you all shift. And the pockets!<br />Great for any active job
5.0,"we like this product, like the pull string that keeps it tight to the face. Breathable, light weight, not to warm. Tks, Catherine"
5.0,"The dress is just really pretty ! I love the fabric. It's just great for the winter as well. Really cozy how it feels. I love how the dress looks on me. I thought it would be a fail ordering this dress, but it wasn't just the perfect dress. The color it is the same as the picture. It does go up to my knees long dress."
5.0,Came as ordered.  Well packaged and protected.  Daughter loves the earrings. Even prettier than the photo.
5.0,"Wand was a little larger than expected, but my daughter loves it. The light up feature is great with two settings (the light can be set to stay on for a bit). I’m glad it only makes one sound. Great gift!"
5.0,I needed this as a costume piece and it was fine.
5.0,Definitely not compression tanks but still nice...very comfortable....I wear an XL so that's what i ordered and it fits perfect
5.0,Nice...complete set of tapers.  I got these for my daughter as she wants to gauge her ears.  I guess neon blue hair and a lip ring is not enough lol.  There is everything she needs right here to get started.  I actually like gauged ears...is 43 years old too old for gauges?<br />Received for review.
5.0,These fit very well.  I would buy this again.  Nice quality for price
5.0,I absolutely love this ring! So much so that this is the third time I've purchased it in two years. Unfortunately I lost it twice before (I'm really bad about misplacing stuff). My friend purchased a similar ring from the same company over two years ago. She wears it every day and it's still in good condition. Well worth the price!
5.0,"Bought it for my 2 1/2 yr old niece. She’s 30-35 lbs about 35in tall. Big girl. 4-5T. Sunflower/white.<br />It fit her a bit loose (to be expected) we will just sew the sides around the arm pit. And no big deal. She loved it, wouldn’t stop twirling. And she hates dresses"
5.0,"Wore this for my bachelorette party and felt gorgeous. The material on this dress is nice and thick. It fit as expected and I will probably order it in multiple colors.  I am 5’6” and around 145 pounds, athletic build.  A medium fit well."
5.0,Perfect addition to my charms collection. Fits Pandora bracelet well. This charm is very beautiful and attractive aside from the fact that it really looks well made.  I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase. I have bought a lot of charms from NinaQueen and I can honestly say that I love all that I bought. They deliver what they promise.
5.0,Very nice and Stylish.<br />Authentic Certificate included.
5.0,Love this set! Its perfect for lounging or working out. The quality is great and the material is thick and comfortable! I’ll definitely be ordering in more colors!
5.0,My son loves it!!!!!
5.0,Great dress very pretty
5.0,I disliked the product because of the size but that was my own fault because I did not read the measurements.
5.0,"I love these masks, they fit so well thank the nose clip actually stays on nose. I have tried many masks lately and these really work well."
5.0,"Better than expected, and the point was even real and not &#34;simulated&#34; unlike many of the other inexpensive offerings you find here. It fits loose enough for me to wear with a ribbon choker for MAXIMUM CHOKER POWER!!!"
5.0,Very comfortable just right thickness
5.0,"So much win, here.  I can't even tell you how great this is for an IT professional who carries a dozen different adapters, thumb drives, cables, etc. all stuffed into the small pocket in a backpack.  Thank you, to whatever mad-genius dreamed this up."
5.0,I love this delicate toe ring. The CZs look bright like diamonds. A great purchase for the price considering the high risk of losing a toe ring as I am in the water daily.
5.0,"Great price and great options for a teenager. My daughter loves this set and wears them all the time! Very versatile, good combination of styles, good deep black color. Great deal!"
5.0,I bought the matching pendant also. It is a very nice set.

5.0,Super cute and great quality!
5.0,"I love this coat! The double zipper is great for keeping snow out an extra warmth in. Very warm, and thick but pnot too bulky."
5.0,Love my necklace.
5.0,"I'm a woman but I happen to think having gender specific socks is dumb when it comes to your basic athletic socks (unless you have giant feet I guess?).  So I grabbed these for myself and really like them.  They fit me just fine (I'm a women's 9), are soft, not too hot, seems to wick (is that the word?) sweat and funk, and most important to me, wash and dry just fine.  Would get again."
5.0,"I bought this shirt for a photo shoot and was very pleased with it. Not see through at all, a thick, white, kind of stretchy material. I read the reviews and ordered an XL. I normally wear a medium. The xl was perfect. Also, I didn’t even need to iron it, it came out nice."
5.0,Just love my glasses. I can see more clear when I'm out in the sun. Must have if you like good sunglasses protection. And nice price
5.0,"Absolutely loved everything about it like the fit, material, the cut, soft, good zipper and style."

5.0,Love the coat the hood espelially just wish it had draw strings to make it a lil more snug around the head. Nice deep pockets inside too. Love the slanted stitching.
5.0,I got this earrings and I was scare about the size. But they are a beauty and perfect to go to work. Im Sure I will be getting some others for my mom and sisters.
5.0,Fantastic little boonie. Wore it in the heat during a 24 hour adventure race last month. Dipped it in a stream or two and it kept me cool while jogging through the woods and over the fields.
5.0,"Ugly but for the price. Great sun protection. Have had them for a year and haven't lost them, that says a lot."
5.0,"Shirt had a few serger tails on it when I received it That were easy to cut off without causing any damange but, but other than that it's made pretty well and the fabric is very soft. I'm in love with this shirt."
5.0,I bought it for me but my husband really liked it so now is his. Great product for the price!
5.0,perfect socks
5.0,Awesome fleece. Great price and the sizes are super accurate.
5.0,So Soft and Comfortable.
5.0,"i'm short so it was a tad long but I got nothing but compliments on this dress! I wish that it came in a solid color, i would order more!!!!"
5.0,This dress is simple and a classic for girls.  Very soft.  My daughter loves it.  Plan to buy more styles from this company in the future.
5.0,I have been wearing the flip flop Telex for a few years and love them. These were for my sister-in-law. She loves them and wants another pair in white but there were none a available. She has back and knee problems and felt relief wearing these.
5.0,"Comfy and warm beanie, my boyfriend loves it."
5.0,Great hat at a great price. Material is thick and we'll stitched. Very warm.
5.0,I am very happy
5.0,I absolutely loved this top!! It fit perfect! Plus side it has pockets.
5.0,Wash well. No shrinking. Fit well.
5.0,These socks come in a variety of colors and designs. You get 12 nonskid ankle socks. My son is 3 but he wears a size 9t in shoes so I ordered the socks in size 5-7 years and they fit him perfectly. They are thick enough to keep his feet warm in the winter months. They don’t slide down into his shoes the way that some ankle socks do with movement. These socks are a really good purchase!
5.0,Great workout tops.
5.0,Wow this ring is stunning looks amazing it comes with a little short booklet helps you how to keep it in mint condition. Its a fun cocktail ring that looks like the real thing. I had to order another one after seeing this one
5.0,"Great product, great team"
5.0,"Do you wake up before 5 am? Do you sleep like a rock? If a tornado blasted through your house at 7 am would you sleep through it? If you answered YES to any of these questions i highly suggest this taser watch. First of all it’s easy to set up on your phone, took me about 10 mins. You can set alarms and power settings through the app. Yes it’s 150 bucks, but this thing saved my job, I have not been late since I got it. It makes this beeping noise before it zaps the sh!t out of you and now if I forget to put it on before bed, all it takes is that beeping noise and I’m up and scrambling around in complete paranoia. Don’t buy this bracelet if you are a little b!tch, it hurts you. I suggest buying it if you are a heavy sleeper, i don’t know how well it works if you want to quit smoking or loose weight, for that I suggest being an adult and just quit, but for oversleeping this is probably the best alarm on Amazon. If I could choose a 6 out of 5 stars I would."
5.0,"I just got these today and I pulled them out of the package and fell in love with the feel of the fabric!  It feels so soft and yet silky too, and cool to the touch. I ordered them because I have been told and read how bamboo is supposed to sleep cooler and wick away moisture and being 51 and dealing with night sweats/hot flashes I am hoping it makes sleeping more comfortable.<br /><br /> As  far as sizing, I wear a 8 or 10 in jeans but wanted to make sure they weren't tight so I ordered a Large.  I am glad I did since the waist band is snug enough that I think a medium may have been too tight. I am only 5'1&#34; so of course they are too long, but I am used to that, I just pull them up higher and/or roll the waist band. the shirt is a high/low style with the back longer than the front, not sure why, but it doesn't bother me.  The only negative is that the top is very sheer, I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them in front of anyone besides my husband.<br /><br />Again I just recieved them today, but so far I am very happy with them.<br /><br />***update....it's now been a few weeks and I wear them EVERY night!  They are my favorites!  I washed them (NO fabric softner!!) and hung to dry and they were fine.  I  LOVE these pajamas!"
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this purse!!! It's much bigger than I anticipated, which is even better in my case! The dealer was super nice, and the bag is the real deal! Super happy with it."
5.0,Nice charm.  My only complaint would be to be able to purchase in smaller quantities. I will never use this whole package
5.0,"These masks are great, with filters in them! Without the filters I don’t think they’d be very protective, I think they’d be slightly protective but the filter really adds the protection. I love them."
5.0,"Considering the price, we were elated with how nice it looked."
5.0,Looks ladylike to me!
5.0,"Love this wallet!  I went to a smaller purse & my old clunky wallet wouldn't fit!  I got just as much in this wallet, including my checkbook & it fits in my new purse perfect!!"
5.0,"Gift for my daughter who love them.  Nice for winter, but also nice for chilly weather at RenFest."
5.0,"Love the colorful fabric, fit and bonus pockets!"
5.0,"For the price, you cannot beat this deal! I received so many compliments and people were amazed when I told them that I ordered it from Amazon!"
5.0,The earrings are exactly what I wanted and were perfect for Christmas.  I will definitely consider Bling jewelry in the future.
5.0,Freaking gorgeous
5.0,"You guys! This is my son's FAVORITE gift ever. His sisters were kind of jealous when he opened the package up. He put it on RIGHT AWAY! The material is super soft and light (think of it as a little thicker than Dri Fit).  The colors are very bright and the design is crystal clear. My son is roughly about 4'8'' and weighs about 160 lbs, I ordered a Large for him and it fit JUST right.<br />**My son gave is jacket away. His step brother really liked it so he gave it to him before he went back home to his moms house. So I will be ordering another one soon!"
5.0,"great product it was what i wanted and i love the fit, make sue that you check the size because i did not at 1st but it just made my son happy because he got the item and it fit him great and yes i would recommend to anyone"

5.0,It looks great and is comfortable
5.0,This is a good wat h for a good price
5.0,"Love this top! It has decent stretch, but isn’t as stretchy as I would have liked. Slightly too snug around my armpits for my preference, but not so bad where I would need to return it. I’ll be ordering an XL next instead of a L. Overall very pleased with this top. Great for yoga, nice moisture wicking. Good support without excessive cleavage. I always take the paddings out anyway, but this is double lined, which is nice. I’m 5’4, 125#, athletic build, shoulders on the broad side, 34D/36C for reference."
5.0,It fits all included my telephone
5.0,This was a perfect dress for Resurrection Sunday for my oldest daughter it fit well and she loved it.
5.0,Avatar State Yip Yip
5.0,"I wear these every morning. They are really comfortable,  but the best thing is, it has a soft fur footbed instead of plastic like most slippers so your foot does not do the ""slip and slide"" and there is not plastic underneath the fur that touches the top of your foot. Yes they run a little small size up one size and you won't regret this purchase ! Really nice quality. Will buy more in other colors."
5.0,"The dress has a nice stretch, fits well. Came on time and as described"
5.0,Even though I turn my volume up on my phone sometimes the volume seems low but I can’t wear earbuds at work so it comes in handy
5.0,I have long arms and broad shoulders and the large fit just fine. 5’7” athletic build.
5.0,Simply put... I love these socks. My plan it is to find additional colors and purchase. The sock are a greater quality and actually heavier than expected for a dress sock. They are as stated &#34;funky&#34; fun and my wife love them. As she stated ladies love to see a man with colorful sock as a matching accessory to his ensemble. The fit is 10-13 and I fit a size 11. The are roomy and comfortable. Feel safe to purchase at this great price.
5.0,"I really like the look of this wrist band -- the graphics are nice -- but it was much larger than I expected. To say it will fit most is true! From the product photo, I knew it would be wider than most bands (the width measured 1""), but the circumference was 8 1/2"" (I wear 6-7"" bracelets). I hope my nephew will enjoy it as much as I had hoped to!"
5.0,Good product. The darkest lens I can find so far. Somewhat tight on the legs on the head however they stay put when leaning over or sweating. Gld to have found this product.
5.0,"Totally blown away. I wear small, and the problem always is that the small are too small and mediums are too large. These briefs fit perfectly."

5.0,Great fit<br />Comfortable<br />Holds up after many many washes

5.0,My coworker loved it!!!
5.0,At first I was I little skeptical about this product…. How ever this is very useful when it comes to doing laundry and folding my socks. I can never find my matching sock when I do laundry and sock snaps honestly eliminates that issue for me. Even my mom was very happy because she does my dads laundry and it make so much more easier for her definitely recommend it !!
5.0,Its pretty and my mouse glides with ease. Love it.
5.0,Sexy cute perfection!
5.0,"These socks enable circulation in feet and legs of diabetic patients as me. After a few minutes of wear, my feet are warmed as blood circulates through me feet."
5.0,"I bought this for my 19 year old. She wore it on a date with black leggings and boots! Extremely cute! Only thing to watch for is being busty. My daughter wears a D and it didn’t hang right when she had on a regular bra, but was perfect when she changed to a sports bra."
5.0,This shirt is so comfortable and feels really smooth. I like how it is very flattering for any body type =)
5.0,HIGH QUALITY WALLET.

5.0,Great product! Great quality! Excellent customer service!
5.0,"Wig fits my 6 year old perfectly. Great quality! I only wish you could see the &#34;white&#34; strand of hair better. The bangs will need some styling to tone them down a bit, but I am definitely satisfied as anything &#34;frozen&#34; is either marked up or out of stock!"
5.0,"Good  quality, super comfortable, looks great"
5.0,They are terrific!
5.0,"Great leggings, super warm and nice quality. Perfect for the winter and cold weather coming soon. They are a little small though, so order a size up."
5.0,"This is just the right size for an ipad pro and there is space enough for a few other things. It can also fit A4 size file or magazine. There are many other convenient pockets, zippers, etc."
5.0,"I ordered these sunglasses to replace the identical product, so I was already aware of the high quality of the Serengeti 5222.. The large lens have just the right amount of tint, the frame is strong and the complete assembly is attractive. Perfect for long driving trips or just down the street."
5.0,Great shirt for my nephew he loved the mask on it.
5.0,Really pleased with the product and it's quality for the price.  Have been wearing these everyday for coaching and they have held up very well.
5.0,I bought them for the plane and wear them all the time - everywhere.

5.0,Excellent hat.  The brim is a touch flimsy however it does the job.
5.0,Works great. Would purchase again
5.0,"These socks are not only super cute, but they are super comfortable! I am only in college but I have issues with flat feet and pain in my shins, and it especially becomes painful after I have been on my feet all day shopping or doing other recreational activity. I figured I would try these the next time I had a full day of errands and my legs and feet felt amazing. My feet weren't tired. My shins didn't hurt. Best of all, when I got home and took the socks off, my feet and legs didn't hurt even then!! I am going to wear them for my next archery tournament and see how they hold up. So far, I am going to buy more of these in different colors in the near future."
5.0,The quality was nice and perfect size for what I wanted.
5.0,Just as i wanted for fall
5.0,I love it. Just as pictured.

5.0,Really good quality. Smells weird but it goes away after a while.
5.0,My wife love the feel and said they are so comfortable to wear!
5.0,"This set is absolutely beautiful! The colors are exactly as they appeared online and blend so well together. This set is the perfect workout set or lounge set for those lazy days! The sweatshirt is warm and cozy. It’s not the kind that has that weird shiny material and it doesn’t attract hair/lint easily. It’s so soft and it does not shed on other tops that you might wear underneath. The print on the sweatshirt is tough too, I have washed and dried it many times and it’s not peeled off at all. As for the bottoms, they’re smooth as butter and have a comfortable stretch to them, but not too much to the point they lose their shape throughout wear time or washes. They’re mid waist and they stay out! I don’t have to constantly keep pulling them up like other yoga pants I own. These pants have amazing moisture wicking ability and keep you very cool, especially during work outs. They’re squat proof and seamless! Even after many washes, the pants have not shrunk, faded, or had any unraveling of threads. I actually opt for this set more than some of my expensive name brand ones."
5.0,I ordered 7mm and recieved 6mm. I cant use them where I wanted but they look good in my lobes instead.
5.0,Granddaughter loved this gift.
5.0,"quality is good, bit pricey, but I like the thickness of the material, it is not paper thin or see through! Just as I expected."
5.0,One of my favorite shirts! Highly recommend.
5.0,I love these earrings!  They compliment most outfits and are even prettier in person.
5.0,Loved them. Gave some to friends and they really loved them. Beuatifully m ade.
5.0,The blue shirt fits perfectly and has held up well. The black and white versions were way too small right out of the packaging.
5.0,Loved the tutu. My daughter is 6 y/0 and she wore it for her kindergarten gradution and it was perfect. Most of the girls were wearing tutu but flat and she has the fullest and fluffiest one :) The stitches are nice it doesn't look like cheap at all. A lot of teachers and parents noticed her tutu and it was very cute. I would be buying other colors. Since we both loved it.
5.0,This item is fantastic!!!😁 My first time taking it to the casino was the first time I have ever came home with more money then I actually took! I would recommend it to everyone that wants to honestly try and make money while enjoying time at the casino. Your only responsibility is to leave the keys at home.
5.0,This was a gift for two family members - they loved itl
5.0,"First off I was pleasantly pleased that this fit as expected as so many bras don’t when you order online. Second this was so comfortable. It fit in all the right places, did not dig in, the straps did not slip off my shoulders. I actually cannot wait to purchase more of these bras in different colors!"
5.0,I love them<br />  I use it daily
5.0,Super cute and comfortable. Easy to wash and wear again.
5.0,Great product. Works well on keeping swelling down on legs<br /> Can wear with open toe shoes. Would buy again.
5.0,"You can't beat this for the price.  It fit nicely and washed well (cold water, delicate cycle, hung to dry)  It is a good light weight for spring but it's not so thin that it looks cheap or will rip easily."
5.0,being able to drop my mask around my neck instead of having to take it off to eat etc
5.0,Best watch I have had in a long time... its better than any other expensive watch
5.0,This product is made so well it will last a lifetime and it's very comfortable.
5.0,"Very comfortable pant, and I love that they offer length for us shorter gals.  Wash and dry well.  Love them so much I plan to purchase more in additional colors."
5.0,I love this mask. It has the sparkle that brightens your day. People asked me from where I purchased and I told them it has to be our very AMAZON.... I love Amazon.
5.0,Happy with my purchase!
5.0,So much sparkle. Absolutely gorgeous!
5.0,"Love. Not too big, fit right into the button of my belly. And doesn't tarnish! I did lose one of the gems pretty quickly but I don't even care."
5.0,Love this shirt! Will be great summer time work shirt. I have to wear XL shirts because I have such broad shoulders(19&#34;) for my size (5'1&#34;). I ordered a L and it was big. I could've ordered a M. I'm keeping this one though.
5.0,"I love that these navy blue shoes have white soles and white buckles--they are a great summer sandal.  Birkenstocks with the soft footbed are my favorite, so this feature is a plus, and I'm so happy these were available in the narrow width.  Also Birkenstocks now have enough holes in the straps to cinch them up securely.  I used to have to punch more holes in the strap myself.  These are leather and do require some time for the straps to soften up.  But I have to say, I love these shoes. OH! Did I say the price of leather Birkenstocks with the soft footbed are usually priced at around $130, so these at about $95 were a good deal."
5.0,They were very pretty.
5.0,this top is really cute got many compliments from others. It's soft and comfortable would definetly buy in another color.You wont be disappointed.
5.0,I love them I had to bend them to make them fit my face.
5.0,"Good quality, stays on the foot, and good size."
5.0,"I love this style bathing suit, this is my favorite one... the back of it is beautiful!"
5.0,"This sweeping, light and gentle over-the-head shawl is what every closet needs!  Soft colors and can be paired with just about anything, ie. denim shorts, maxi dresses or even an off-the-shoulder summer top."
5.0,"Really cute, covers the bum, just what I wanted."
5.0,"I love this jumper, it soft and fits perfectly!"
5.0,"I need big date watches because, despite my glasses, the usual watch tiny dates are difficult for me to see. I bought four of these (2 black dial, 2 white dial) watches (at two different prices) because at this current sub-$30 price it doesn't matter if they are not heirloom watches or if they do not keep perfect time. It is a discontinued model at various close-out prices on the web. There are reviews of the decent movement on the web."
5.0,very nicley made i love how the leaf dangles for the price its def right! I am in love with it
5.0,Great fit. Hasn’t faded or shrunk
5.0,It fits true to size & has a good stretch.
5.0,They are prefect if you are looking to not get a real piercing. they look very real!

5.0,Great to item!
5.0,My husband is very picky about shower shoes but he does like these and uses them daily.  Thank you.
5.0,Good sizes
5.0,"Patrick's partner here. Ordered an XL thinking that being L before having a baby would give me some wiggle room. This did not work in my favor. So, I'm ordering the next size up because this blazer is BEAUTIFUL!"
5.0,I love this beaded bun holder. I get complements on it all the time.
5.0,"The pants did not fit and contacted the seller for a quick solution, and got it solved."
5.0,I bought for my son. He is 6’1 and it fits well. He loves it. Good quality.
5.0,"I got the same thing at Apex Pharmacy, my doctor recommended them for me. I paid $40, ordered them from Amazon. They really help my legs feel better. They are Still difficult to get on but not as bad as others ones I’ve had buying another pair."
5.0,"I love this bag!  Nice and roomy, and good quality."
5.0,It was the satin in the inside for me! This hat was perfect in soooooo many ways!
5.0,"Small, but perfect."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift, well priced, and sterling silver which means it won’t turn when she wears it."
5.0,Perfect fit very warm works well with my Iphone 8 Plus...!
5.0,Love them!<br /><br />One of the earring did not come with a back piece but it doesn't fall off so no need for it. It fits nice and snug and I've gotten so many compliments. Definitely a great buy!
5.0,Fun! and very comfortable
5.0,"Got these to pack our clothes in.  They work great for packing and keeping your dirty clothes separate from your clean.<br /><br />I can fit a pair of jeans and multiple other articles of clothing inside one of these bags.  And only needed two bags for a 3 day weekend trip-3 outfits, pjs and a bathing suit.<br /><br />Shoes fit well for both me and my fiancé (men’s size 11 shoes still have room in the bag)<br /><br />We like them so much, I bought more.<br /><br />Only thing left to test on these is the waterproof...I am hoping to store wet bathing suit for transporting without marking other clothes wet."
5.0,My step dad swears by Russell for sweatshirts. Good quality and they hold up well in the wash.
5.0,We have purchased these pants for both myself (adult version) and my son who is 9.  He loves them because they are not tapered on the bottom and have the zipper to open so they fit over his sneakers.
5.0,I will probably order a few more for work!
5.0,Fit surprisingly well. I am happy with the purchase.
5.0,Great feel and fit.  I have broad shoulders and the XL is perfect.  Color was as expected.
5.0,Got this for a going away party.  It went very well with blue jeans and a beige blazer. Fabric is soft. I’m happy with how it looked on me (got a lot compliments) and the price.
5.0,"I have purchased this item for a couple of years right around red suit time near the end of the year.  No pair of gloves has lasted the whole Season but at least this pair lasted longer.  Come this next October, in preparation for November and December, I will look forward to buying these gloves again."
5.0,My grand daughter begged for this she’s 5 so I ordered a small andit’s quite large but better then to small! She sleeps in it!
5.0,Bought for someone else
5.0,My daughter loves these! They are very durable and so cute!
5.0,"I now have three of the Heshe bags, and if you want a bag that is well made, very clean, many pockets, and a strap long enough to wear anyway you want or take it off; then these are The Bags to have.  I love these; they don't have a name all over them.  Color is rich, and leather is heavy and well made.  I will continue to purchase more since they have a wide variety to choose from."
5.0,"While I love the style of this necklace, my clasp doesn’t stay shut and has opened to where my actual Fitbit tracker has fallen out of the necklace several times now. So I’m fearful to wear it and lose my tracker! Looks good, not great quality.<br /><br />Edit - after my original review the seller was prompt in contacting me, apologized, and is offering to send a replacement free of charge no need to send original back to them. I’ve changed my original 2 stars to 5 stars because that kind of customer service speaks volumes to me. I did nothing but write my review on Amazon and they did literally everything else. They reached out to me and replaced the item. And for all those reasons, I will be a returning customer and will buy another pendant in silver so I have options!"
5.0,Was a hit with all 3 of my girls. Win for dad!
5.0,The picture doesn’t do it justice but it’s the perfect size and it blings
5.0,My son loves this and helps him with his fidgety and it is quiet
5.0,"I'm 5'4"" and these sweats were too short. However, they are the best fitting and most comfortable sweats I've ever had. They are not too sheer for my taste."
5.0,"Nice glasses, quality and sturdy."
5.0,Love this waist trimmer. It is my best friend. It works so good. Soon as you put it on. You can feel the moist...the sweat. Easy to wear and manage.
5.0,"This was delivered several weeks before promised. I did not really expect it to be this pretty. I love it, doesn't matter if it lasts forever, it's costume jewelry and great value"
5.0,"I am 100% satisfied.  In fact, I am thrilled.  For the first time in a long time, I am able to clearly see text on my computer screen. I should have purchased these classes sooner."
5.0,"Red white and blue stretch bracelet for the adult wrist.  Crisp colors, well made and just plain fun for any patriotic holiday or just for your red, white and blue jean outfits and summer flip flops."

5.0,Very pretty. I wanted to get this for my daughter to put her children's birthstones in. She loves it!
5.0,"Holy carp! Surprisingly amaze! I'm definitely gonna be buying this when I lose weight!<br />It's not stretchy in the waist so make sure you get the right size but the pant leg is very roomy! My first ""overall"" type of pants! I'm too heavy and broad shoulders so it is def flattering!<br />Thank you for actually providing a great item!"
5.0,"My husband doesn't like thin dress socks. These are perfect... Great quality, comfortable fit with no thick seams, looks good with dress pants. He wears a size 12 shoe so the sizing is also good. He highly recommends these gold toe socks."
5.0,I got these to wear under my dresses.
5.0,Omg! Looks so much nicer in person and was easy to put in! Definitely getting another for my other ear
5.0,Good quality earring! It is a small hoop for an adult ear but it would be great for a young girl or toddler.
5.0,Love everything about dress the color the fit . roomy dress for plus sized girls
5.0,"I bought myself one in black and my daughter one in purple. They are large enough for me to store my beach towel in and still have plenty of room for sun block, a bottle of water, my wallet, and could squeeze in a bit more if I wanted. I highly recommend these. I had a fanny pack for when I didn't want to carry a wallet like at an amusement park but these hold so much more, I find myself using this more often."
5.0,As ad
5.0,"If you are into charms these are for you, great as gifts or for yourself."

5.0,I bought this for my petite 7 year  old daughter and it fits her great. I've washed it several times and it's holding up as well.  I'd definetly buy Another!
5.0,These are very comfy and flattering. Easy to work out in
5.0,Cute cute cute and good price!
5.0,"My 16 month old great granddaughter (a tippie toe walker) is just now walking and these shoes give her the confidence and balance she needs. And they are really cute! Star Runner is apparently replaced by Star Runner 2, which are a bit different, so we have had a hard time finding the original Star Runner. Thanks, Amazon!"
5.0,"Great Value, very comfortable and easy install. Arrived next day from order as advertised! Might have to get another!"
5.0,"It's true to the size, color ,delivered on time and it beautiful."
5.0,"love it,"
5.0,"Contrary to what it's normally used for, I use this polishing cloth on my silver trumpet and silver flute the day of a performance. I usually wipe down the instruments with a rag to get some of the dirt off, then use the blue side to buff it, and then the cream side to polish it.<br />Even with tarnish coming off onto the cloth, it still does a great job. Very good quality product for a reasonable price. Great for jewelry, but it's great for literally anything silver (including instruments), and doesn't do any damage to the item being polish. Would totally recommend this."
5.0,"These sandals are expensive, but the velcro straps make them easy to adjust, there is plenty of arch support and padding. The padded heel strap is especially nice. They are attractive and can be worn with casual shorts, capris, skirts and dresses. I'm very pleased with these shoes."
5.0,This dress is beautiful I wore it at my wedding reception in June.
5.0,Love it and wear it everyday.

5.0,"Looks good, solid feel.  I absolutely love it"
5.0,"He asked, Auntie provided. Haha. I had to order a size to buy for him as his size was out. This was the only place I could find it. It’s a little to big but will fit perfect when he reaches that size. Mom said it washed super well and he says it’s comfy."
5.0,"Started carrying this in my bike bag. It came in real handy recently when a ride started in nice weather and ended up cold and rainy. This kept me dry, is highly visible, and also helped me to stay warm."
5.0,I like this watch. I wear it to work. Great one
5.0,"This dress was adorable and not terribly see through, which is rare to find these days. It was a bit snug around my bust and I could have done with a size up."
5.0,This was absolutely adorable. It was just a little wide across the neck. But fit great everywhere else.
5.0,Nicely packaged and good quality for the money.
5.0,Fit  perfectly  pretty good quality definitely will order again
5.0,"She loves them! Easy on, easy off."
5.0,"Knowing that these shirts run small, I ordered this in XXL. I normally wear a Large. Therefor, it fits as a Large. Order two sizes larger than what you would normally wear, and the fit should be fine. The quality of the shirt looks nice. Reasonable delivery time considering it came from China. Excellent Price."
5.0,These are easy to attach to the earring backs.
5.0,Easy to install and comfortable to wear.  Love it more than the silicone strap that it comes with and I don't break out from the constant wear.
5.0,These were a gift for my grandson.  He loved them.  The fabric is like a nylon
5.0,Very nice and sturdy. Looks very dressy. Would recommend to anyone.

5.0,Very satisfied as usual!
5.0,BEAUTIFUL VERY RESPONSABLE AND GREAT VERY DELIVERY TIME.
5.0,Great for miraflex toddler glasses!
5.0,Fit great quality great washes well
5.0,I love this bag because of its size and sturdiness. I have received many compliments about how cute it is. I got the purse in gray and it’s the perfect size large enough without being too huge.
5.0,"My fifteen year old daughter chose this ring herself and I approved it based on it's reviews and the customer ratings of the company, Gem Avenue. It is a lovely fluid band of marked sterling silver with a moderate size cz that is maybe 3/4 carat but set down in an unobtrusive fashion like a channel set. The cz is clear and catches the light with faint sparkles of color at the right angle. It has been worn it for about a week and it still appears new. My daughter absolutely loves it and it does not look out of place on her finger. I find the ring to be dainty but not flimsy, and it was shipped very quickly in a darling, tiny gift box that my daughter was also thrilled with. Add all this together with the VERY reasonable price and I'd say we have a very happy customer."
5.0,Love this dress - I received a lot of compliments.  Would definitely purchase this again.

5.0,Love the variety and they don't irritate her skin
5.0,This chain is beautiful and the correct length.
5.0,"This dress is perfect for summer, it’s cool, soft and comfortable. It will also be adorable with a cardigan and boots for the fall. After 4 kids, I’m paranoid about T-shirt dresses making me look pregnant but this is very flattering. It fit great, I didn’t size up at all. The pockets are big enough to hold my phone. I’m 5’9 so a lot of short dresses are too short. It’s not quite midi on me but it does hit just under my knee (the slit on the side hits just at my knee). I want to buy it in all the colors. (Side note, it’s soft cotton and I got the navy. The fabric isn’t see through and doesn’t show sweat)"
5.0,Great set!
5.0,Got them candy apples and my client loved them as well as I.
5.0,Very good quality for the price.
5.0,"This dress is absolutely amazing! I love the feel of it on my body and the way it plays on me. I was afraid it would be to short for me but it was just right. I'm 5'3"" and weigh about 180lbs and got the dress in a size medium. And it had a bonus that it had a zipper on the side."
5.0,I love the this dress. It is comfortable but also looks great. I’m a mom if 2 little boys so am always on the run and this dress allows me the freedom to run around and look nice doing it!  It has give to it and stretches appropriately. It has pockets that you would never know were there. It’s a great buy for the money!
5.0,Great grippers for safe travels on slippery floors!
5.0,Perfect and cheap!
5.0,"We travel a lot and this is perfect for my lil man. It is durable and he loves having his own set of luggage. I love the 4 wheel, it makes it easier for him to maneuver around."
5.0,"These bags work quite well. I live in Florida where cold and frozen groceries don’t have a chance, even on a short ride home. Now I’ll be able to run other errands and not have to rush home. The bags are big enough to fit many items."
5.0,"This a beautiful dress, I also ordered the black one as well, because I like it so much."

I'm pretty tall (5'10"") and it is a perfect length to wear with flats, which is a rare and welcomed occurrence! Can't wait to buy more in other colors!"
5.0,"I have always loved this brand of swim skirt, they are expensive but totally worth the $$ you spend. I’ve had my 1st one for over 2 years now and it is still in good shape. I have just gotten a little bit bigger so had to order a different size."
5.0,"So cute. Fits great, somewhat stretchy. I can't believe the quality for the price."

But I'd your arms ar skinny still not quite phalanx top quality sleeve fit hug. I've been wearing spiderman tips since before the internet provided spidey rashgaurds, this looks the coolest top 3 forsure. Back print is currently different though. But I appreciate the effort."
5.0,"My favorite leggings. I love the material, it doesn't get shiny when stretched. The pockets are wonderful. I own multiple pairs, these are my go to leggings for everyday wear and hiking."
5.0,"Other reviews have said to order 2 sizes larger which is what I did. They were way too big. I contacted the seller to return. The seller told me there was no need to return and that they would send me another pair in my correct size which is EU40/US8. It only took sbout 1 week for them to arrive.They fit perfectly. So order your correct size!!! Great customer service! They also were the correct length for me. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 130. For someone tall, they may be too short.  I wore them for the first time yesterday and got many compliments."

5.0,"When I had my two cataracts removed the Dr. Said you must wear sunglasses out side always.  He gave me a plain generic pair, that all his patients recieve... and although they were too big and ugly.. they were helpful... so I look for a better pair... these not only fit.. but look great... and the price is great."
5.0,Fits great and looks great!
5.0,"Great customer service. Dress is beautiful NOTE: the back of the dress is longer than the front, so if you don't want it like that, request for it to all be one length. Send in your exact measurements and you'll have a perfectly tailored dress. I requested for the belly to not show so they tailored the skirt to stay up on my waist. Thanks for your help Judy!"
5.0,Got these for my grandpa.<br />He feels like Mr Cool. Looks great with the wood grain/bamboo texture on the sides. Dark but not too much. Stylin.
5.0,Good quality.  Folds up nicely and stores in a nice case.  Seems sturdy enough if you treat them as would any other glasses.  Lenses provide boost when reading and do not have any soft or blurry edges.  Recommend.
5.0,Casual pouch
5.0,Really helps keep sun off the face with generous brim.
5.0,"This is not for everyone but if the fit is right, it’s a great hat for the price. It happens to fit me nicely and I normally wear a large or a size 58 for baseball cap. I’m not disappointed and met my expectations. I would recommend this..."

They give you that ""hug"" that you need, without the discomfort of tight bands cutting into your skin. Not only do you get that comfort and support that you need, but the contour that these boxer briefs bring to your trophy will make it look that much more impressive to those admiring your prize."
5.0,"They fit as expected. I LOVE the material.  I ordered 4 pair, different colors and they are all lovely.  I recommend these amazing yoga capris!!"

5.0,I really love this watch band. It's very comfortable and easy to adjust. It's breathable and lightweight. Great quality. I will be buying more.
5.0,"These are the perfect answer for my 3 year old grandson.  He has a sensory disorder and loud noises can really upset him.  These buffer some of the noise and allow him to be in 'loud' environments.  They fit well, and must be comfortable as he is wearing them around the house, just to get used to them:)"

5.0,Goes with so many things.
5.0,I like the size of the watch.  Quick to get on and off when your in a hurry.
5.0,"I love the feel of this hat and how it fits.  It is looser than some styles, which I like - doesn't cause a headache from being too tight. It's a thicker hat made with quality. And I've received numerous compliments on it!"
5.0,Great quality. Useful. Light-weight. Many spaces and pockets inside and outside. All spaces are locked by zippers or inside pockets covered with a flap.<br /><br />Cons: Color is light green. Darker would be nicer and more new looking.
5.0,Love these scarves. They are the best.
5.0,"I was looking for a good pair of compression socks for my cycling. Needless to say - there's alot out there. I gave this brand a &#34;try&#34; as they got great reviews - i.e. stay up around the knee, 20-30 mmHG, etc. I also purchased two other brands for trial as well. These socks beat the other two brands &#34;hands down&#34;. They are definitely 20-30 mmHG as they provide good strong support for my calves / legs during cycling. And they do stay up! What I loved is that my calves were not &#34;tired&#34; from a 40 mile bike ride! I felt that they really gave my ankles the support they needed as well. Needless to say, after such a great experience - I recently purchase another 2 pairs. Customer Service from JB Outlets, LLC was excellent as well. I contacted them as Amazon had run out of the Large when I went to place the order. CSR responded immediately and told me they were making a new shipment to Amazon over the next few days. Sure enough - today - they now have Large back in stock."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c22041b52f945c5a5b06eb73b59b39b7]] I tend to shy away from wearing stripes because I can never remember whether horizontal or vertical stripes make you look larger but I really liked this shirt so I figured I could at least try it right? So, it turns out that horizontal stripes or at the very least this shirt, don’t make you look larger.  This shirt is a one size fits all type shirt, which means it’s going to have a different fit depending on the person and their size.  I’m a size 12, and have a fairly large bust that I often have to buy larger fitting shirts for.  This shirt is a more fitted shirt on me, but not overly tight or clingy.<br /><br />If you watch the video you can see how this shirt fits me and you can see that while it’s more form fitting it’s not uncomfortably so.  I think this shirt would be perfect paired with a cute pair of jeans.  It’s a really comfortable shirt but in the product picture the sleeves are kind of rolled up and because it’s a tighter fitting shirt on me that probably wouldn’t look quite the same.  I probably wouldn’t purchase this if you’re larger than a size 14 as it may be too tight, but I would definitely recommend it for anyone smaller than that.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
5.0,I use this a a purse I can throw into the washer after going out into the covid world.
5.0,I just got these today and these are SO comfortable!!! I’m 5’3 and these fit just perfect!
5.0,"Fit perfectly, I love the color and the material is soft and looks nice. Totally recommend this product."
5.0,These made ideal favors at my son's lego-themed birthday party.
5.0,"This is the most comfortable, breathable mask I've found. Pleased to find new safety features since my last order"
5.0,"My hubby loves, loves  this watch band...Very Nice, all leather and he said it's very comfortable, too!!"
5.0,My husband loves them. He said he's never had any underwear as nice as this pair to wrap his &#34;package&#34; in. I will be gifting him with some more.
5.0,These shoes are so cute and my baby keeps them on all day. She’s picky with her shoes so they must be comfortable.
5.0,Pretty good quality. It would’ve been nicer if the material used was a tad bit thicker though.
5.0,So unique my daughter wore to her dog themed birthday party!
5.0,Love it! Makes me appear slimmer!
5.0,"LOVE this oiece and wear it almost every day!!  Fits perfectly, is comfortable, and seems durable!  I've had it for a few months, but when I couldn't find it the day I arrived home from traveling across the country, I panicked and ordered a new one bc I couldn't bear the thot of being without this cuff!!  I ended up finding the first one the next day, and shipping was super fast, so now I have 2, which I'm totally cool with!  Love this thing!!  It's my fav piece of jewelry!"
5.0,Really nice casual bag. Comfy strap. Just what I wanted for concerts or running errands on weekends.
5.0,This was given as a gift for Christmas and the recipient loved it.  Would buy it again for myself in future.
5.0,I got these for my family this year and what great quality. It's so hard for us to find matching sets and all 8 of us can match ... they are very cozy very soft.  Would definitely recommend
5.0,Quality looks good. Not the official jersey but awesome none the less. It is made from dry fit material and is really light weight.  It is great for training!
5.0,Necklace and bracelet look just as pictured!  Girls liked because they could remove when swimming or taking shower vs the kit where you just tie in a knot.  Look adorable on girls at beach and during summer with their tan......especially the white one!
5.0,Love these shirts! I love the material and style of these shirts. I'm 5'10 230lbs. Purchased 2XL. Fits perfect width and length.
5.0,"These are beautiful earrings! I was really surprised when I received them because the picture of them doesn't do them any justice! They are stunning! They are bigger than they appear to be. They are over an inch wide and an inch long! They are slightly, just slightly heavy, not too much tho. But, it's the designs on them that make them so pretty! There's so much detail in the design. They really are very pretty earrings. Made of sterling silver, for those of you who have a hard time with sensitivity to metals. You could wear these dressing down, jeans and nice top, but really, they are a bit more elegant and really would look great on a dress up day, with a nice dress!<br /><br />I did receive these earrings at a discounted price for my honest opinion. I would recommend these to my family and friends."
5.0,"I added a Powerade bottle for size reference. I’ve had this bag for months now with no issues. Very durable with no frays, stains or tears. It’s weather resistant so I never worry about the content in inclement weather. All buckles and zippers are metal and the bag is ambidextrous. I docked one star for travel as it’s not very big so don’t plan on getting a lot in there and one star for durability as I haven’t torture tested or had very long 3-4 months. Good purchase though."
5.0,Love these glasses. The quality is perfect.
5.0,Nice shirt and true to size. Have not washed it yet to see if it shrinks.
5.0,So far so good.  No unraveling and they stay up.
5.0,"I love this, the little urn inside is a great idea"
5.0,"My husband's feet suffer from arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and are always cold. These slippers are  perfect!"
5.0,These were for my daughter at Christmas and she just loved them.  She works long hours on her feet and these just really help her after a long day.
5.0,I wear a large t shirt and these large tanks are more like a medium so it works perfect as a shaper. Stretchy so it not too snug or felt like it made it any harder to breath so buy your normal size. Great product.
5.0,"I like these shirts. They do show off my curves a bit which can be good or bad, but they fit well and are an airy, thin, see throughish fabric that is good for workouts."
5.0,"I love it, I want more."
5.0,I have bought many Charm-It charms for my granddaughter.  I have never been disappointed with any of my purchases and my granddaughter loves each and every one of them!!!!
5.0,"Bought as a present , came in nice little gift box.  Very cute, good quality."
5.0,My son has been having trouble with his feet and legs cramping.  The socks gave him great relief.  I will be buying more.
5.0,Just what I needed. We are required to wear the 5 pt breakaway when working in the yard at UPS. It fit great as I am usually layered up.
5.0,My 5 year old loved them!
5.0,This bottom makes you sweat. It works!
5.0,Great underwear for a price that is insanely low compared to what you pay in stores.  I bough four pairs and I will buy plenty more.

5.0,awesome!
5.0,Are small light perfectfor my daughter*****
5.0,"Love! Perfect size. Dangle, but Not too big"
5.0,"I have worn this jacket about 3 times so far.  It is warm, soft, and fits right.. A little off because there are no darts; but what do you want for the price.  I bought Pink - which is more like Salmon-color.. and i also had bought Pink (also Salmon-color) work boots (which i LOVE) and it matches the jacket and makes a very cute cold-day outfit.  Very happy."
5.0,Super cute.My niece loves it.
5.0,"I've purchased at least 5 pairs of different sunclouds. This sentry is my favorite,  go-to pair.  Stays nicely on my head and holds hair back.  I have a small face and they fit and look great!"
5.0,I have a short torso to long for me
5.0,"received quickly, looks very nice"
5.0,"Right length, right size,  beautiful and just right in every way."
5.0,I was looking for a simple comfortable dress and  this one is great. The soft material is good against the skin and the shape and cut is very flattering. And the I love the color.
5.0,perfect for cosplay! ^^
5.0,This is a nice warm sweater for the cold weather.  The color is nice and fits great. Feels comfy and easy to wash.
5.0,Mini house always makes the best baby &toddler shoes.
5.0,"The swimming kit came with everything it said it would. I do not know if I will be using these ear plugs and not plugs often but for the sake of the review I tried them out. I've never use the ear plugs or nose plugs before but they worked really well. I can see why swimmers would use them. With the ear plugs and the nose plugs, I did not have to worry about water getting into my nose and ears. I was not sure whether they would do a good job keeping the water out but they did. It was really convenient because I have had times where water got stuck in my ears and I just could not get it out and it would be so annoying. They really help keep the water out of those places where you really don't want it.<br />I really liked the swim cap in this kit. I have blonde bleached hair and have heard that the chlorine in the swimming pools could possibly turn my hair greenish. Now I do not know if this is true or not but I was not going to test it out myself. Therefore, I sort of avoided swimming pools for a whole year and with the spring and summer coming by soon I figured getting a swim cap would be the best. I was still wary though since I wanted to make sure my hair did not get wet at all. I put this on and hoped for the best as well as the goggles. My hair did not get wet after over 30 minutes of swimming. The swim cap is not super tight but it was snug enough to keep my hair dry and keep the water out. Also, the goggles were great. The were clean and clear so visibility was great. True to the description, the goggles did not fog up either so I never had to stop swimming to clear the fog or anything. Great products. I received these products in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you guys have found this helpful."
5.0,Finest piece of timekeeping devised by mankind.
5.0,They're beautiful but the picture is deceiving I thought orange was on the sides but they're all brown but the glasses themselves are quality
5.0,omgosh.  This jacket is adorable.  My daughter is in love with it and we get so many.complements on it!
5.0,Came fast and super comfy
5.0,a little long but I'm short<br />I liked the way they felt<br />more than 90% cotton
5.0,I store my folding knives and edc flash lights.  Keeps everything organized.
5.0,"Great vacation glasses, got so many compliments! Very oversized, but I love the look."
5.0,I cant believe it was $34. I cant wait to wear it. I'm really picky about fabric & look of lace and this dress is exquisite. If you have a thick neck you may have a problem with the fit.
5.0,Mine came today and it looks and fits amazing!! 10/10 would order from here again!
5.0,Wife and daughter loved it.
5.0,"These were the perfect complement to my wedding dress.  They were big enough to be seen, but small enough to not overwhelm the pictures.  I would recommend purchasing these earrings just to have for a beautiful set."
5.0,GAVE AS A GIFT. GREAT QUALITY.
5.0,I love this!
5.0,More of a silky fabric than expected but good! If you are top heavy get a size larger due to the slim make of the whole dress
5.0,These are my favorite socks--I have them in 2 colors.  Thick and warm.
5.0,"These all were seriously so cute!! And at like $1.80 a piece, you can't beat that deal. Sure, the quality isn't 100% but by the time they go out of style, I'll be done with them anyway--and I can see them lasting quite a while. I'd totally recommend these to a friend."
5.0,"I haven't had a chance to use this yet, but I have a cruise coming up soon and this holds everything I will need to take with us. It keeps all of our passports and any credit cards and/or money I need to take."
5.0,"Great product to protect your extra key, you can store extra items such as money or other keys I always get compliments on it wondering what dealership gave it to me decent quality holds up nights"
5.0,"I love these. I bought almost 20 pairs all in all.  Buttery soft, not see through and they have a higher waistband so they rarely ever did a roll down and I have a muffin top."
5.0,"Nice shirt, good quality durable and holds color, fast shipping good purchase. Get one for your Hippie friends!"
5.0,Pretty.  Glad I purchased.  Wearing well so far.

5.0,"Bought for myself when I finally got my dream job of director at another company after trying to move up for 10 years at my old company.  Subtle ""shattered "" so you don't have to explain it's not broken unless someone gets really close look. Makes me feel empowered when I wear it,  reminds me how hard I worked for what I have!"
5.0,I loved how many pieces came in the set and all the accessories too!

5.0,Adorable shoe. Pretty good quality. Great price
5.0,Good swim suit. Correct fitting size for kids.
5.0,"I’m a size 7 most times, but had to size up to 7 1/2. These fit perfect now. Very comfortable. I walked for about 3 hours doing some shopping and my feet felt well supported. Looks great with jeans"
5.0,"The lace details on the pants tied in perfectly with the rest of the costume. The fabric is light, and the design is comfortable. I think I'll buy another pair in the other color to use in other projects. 👍"
5.0,My granddaughter loved these. 💕
5.0,boyfriend needed it for work and he likes it very much
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!!
5.0,Let me just say I was skeptical on the quality for how cheap. But man of man is this spot on. You can see through it. It’s not big and bulky it’s just right and I think it maybe stronger then an Etsy sellers would be. Will definitely be doing business with you in the future
5.0,"These are so adorable.  My tween daughter loves them.  They are the perfect size for her and since llama is the big fad right now, she wears them often."
5.0,Great headband.  Looks cute without being bulky and stays in place.
5.0,My wife loves her glasses she always wears them
5.0,"It has been over a year now that I am using it. No doubt this is an excellent product, and probably the best one in the market. I was so happy with it that I got one more for my father. Very comfortable. This is highly recommended for anyone having issues with their heels after standing for long time ... or walking on hard floor."
5.0,During the pandemic I gained 20 pounds and this dress makes me look almost like those 20 pounds never happened. Lightweight but sturdy fabric skims the body. It forgives bulges but isn't baggy so it doesn't add weight by puffing out. Beautiful drape. I bought it in dark purple.
5.0,"Perfect T Shirt who likes loose clothes , Very good price , cause originally this item was 99$ on True Religion web site"
5.0,These are my all time favorite leggings to workout in. They’re super breathable but still sturdy and allow for a full range of motion.
5.0,"I was very pleased with these boots. They are warm, waterproof, and  lightweight.  Because the zipper goes almost to the bottom of the boot, they are very easy to get on and off. Perfect for playground duty."
5.0,Fit great. Wear great. Best athletic short socks that I have used.
5.0,"For anyone that has a metal allergy, this is the perfect necklace.  It is so beautiful that it is hard to believe that it is all synthetic.  Love it!"
5.0,"Elegant, stylish, but not too much."
5.0,just what I was looking for
5.0,This hat is AWESOME! It is so nice to be able to find headgear in my size! I have an above average sized head and have found that one size does not fit all. This hat is so warm! The temps this week have been hovering around zero and my head actually started to perspire a bit wearing this hat! It fits perfectly and looks great!
5.0,This shirt fit great and looks so cute. It's a bit thick to work out in but I just wear it day to day.
5.0,Perfect fit…Lower crown
5.0,Love these sunglasses. They came so nicely packaged so they wouldn't be damaged. They included a soft bag so they won't beget scratched when I carry them in my purse.
5.0,"Very attractive tote,"
5.0,This sweater is cute! Love the smiley faces. Quality seems nice and was delivered promptly.
5.0,Adorable! My 3 year old loved it!
5.0,These are great boots.  A little roomy but that allows for an insert which makes them even more comfortable. The style is great and works with many looks.  I sprayed a waterproof spray for leather on them so they will weather the snow better.  I did air them out for a couple of days and then sprayed them.  The original smell was replaced by the smell of the spray which went away in a few days.
5.0,Our 6 year old grandson loves Hot Rods & loves this shirt !
5.0,Very comfy. Sleeves are huge.
5.0,"Silky Smooth Flannel like, my 3 y/o old loves them."
5.0,Great Quality and look!
5.0,My original shipment was short one shawl.  Once I contacted them they immediately sent me the shawl - thus good customer service.  The quality of the shawl was exactly what I wanted...they were soft and nice size.  I ordered 6 of them in various colors and the colors looked exactly as I noted them on the internet.  Very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,My new favorite jeans :)
5.0,13- month old son loves these! They're wonderful.
5.0,"We're not really going to Africa, but hey, my son looks the part! :) This shirt is cool! The picture says it all. Stylish, amazing colors and good fit.<br /><br />My son who is modeling the shirt is normally a small/medium. This fits him well - so it's a slightly bigger small. The sleeves are nice and long. The buttons are sewn on well. (For reference, my son is 5' 8"" and around 155 pounds.)<br /><br />The material is lightweight, so it's not too hot in the warmer weather. Very nice!"
5.0,Love it!! This is a VERY comfortable and cute dress!!
5.0,Just soooo cute and comfortable!<br />Love the color and it’s perfect for casual outings!<br />It’s a tad long but not too bad at all!  I would definitely buy this again I another color!!!
5.0,"Very good quality, so cute and very well made."
5.0,"Love it! I’m 5’3”, 115lbs and small chested. I ordered a small and it fits like the model. This is probably the first piece I’ve actually felt truly sexy in. I immediately ordered another one after trying it on."
5.0,"Great shirt, purchased for my toddler. He’s 3 but slim built and the 2T fit perfect"
5.0,This was a gift for my teen's 16th birthday. She loved it. It seems to be great quality.
5.0,Like the product all around. Use it for mixing essential oil Cleaner with water. Nice color!
5.0,"Cute, comfy, cozy."
5.0,GET IT...this is the most cutest thing ever.
5.0,Nice accessory to key set.
5.0,Dainty design.  Neice loved them.
5.0,Great quality fabric! The material is soft and thick enough to not be see through but not too thick so that you get hot. Its perfect!
5.0,This is my favorite Ginger Snap! It looks so beautiful and the c craftsmanship is very good. The crystals sparkle like diamonds against the rose gold. Lovely!
5.0,"I love cluse products and this bracelet was no different. Goes with everything, you can dress it up or dress it down. I never take it off!"
5.0,"Since reading the other comments first, as soon as I received mine I washed them. They are soft and very absorbent. My son had even used one, he's 7, and commented on how he loves the feel of them."
5.0,"I got my hubby this as he is a preacher. Took a month to receive it. However, it was well worth the wait. My hubby loves it, also that he can use the extra protection filter that comes with it."
5.0,"Slightly larger than the other onsies I ordered, but still love it!"
5.0,"I live the fit and the color. The attached scarf with pretty, not gaudy, fringe is beautiful. Not heavy or thick. A nice light to medium weight that will keep you warm. It's also well made. The price for this sweater is crazy good."
5.0,They are so comfortable and very light weight and I’m going to order another pair in a different color!  They are so cute!  I get so many compliments
5.0,Really nice quality. The buckle is stylish without being flashy. Is indeed reversible. Pleased!
5.0,Gifts for granddaughter
5.0,"I marked somewhat large as a good thing! It gives extra room to tie it as loose as you need it to be comfortable on your head and not pull on your hair stubble. (if going through chemo like my best friend who I bought this for.) She said it’s super soft and absolutely loves it. It’s not to heavy like some of her other hats, and seems to be breathable and not “hurt” her head.  She would recommend it. I wish I could of bought more in other colors for her. I hope this helps other people looking because I know I searched a ton to find the right one for her. 💜"
5.0,"I absolutely love these jeans!! They are not jeggings, LOL! After reading reviews I ordered 2 sizes up (XL), and they are perfect. Soft, comfortable, and the color is beautiful. I couldn't imagine you can get such quality jeans for $15."
5.0,I loved everything about this set. I received a lot of compliments Halloween night
5.0,"I'm 5ft. and 180lbs. Hourglass shape. (Compact & curvy) so I expected this to be long, but it's not bad. I tied a knot on one side and it looks beachy. I might get it hemmed to remove 1-2 inches. The material is super soft and the pockets will hold a large cellphone and not look bulky.  I ordered a large to accommodate my 40F bust, and it fit perfectly. The dress is breezy and a great purchase."
5.0,This suit fits true to size. It really does make you look 10 pounds thinner!
5.0,I’m 5’1 and I was not walking on this dress. Would recommend to short girls like me!
5.0,I like this watch works great for the price. I do get real compliments on it. I changed the band to a Mesh one and it looks Ooooo so much Better then the factory one. Good buy to me.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them!
5.0,I love these shades. They don’t fall off my face and I get so many complements when I wear them!
5.0,Great Buy!!
5.0,Muy practico elastizado súper ( lo recomiendo!!
5.0,"It is so lightweight. I find it elegant.  Great for bathing suit or even to wear during the day with shorts or leggings underneath accompanied by a tank top. I have worn this to my swimming pool and received compliments.  Adjustable waist. Great for curves. I love it! Even if you don't feel the greatest about yourself in a bathing suit,  this will make you feel prettier. I felt amazing wearing it! I also love the quality. The stitching is great. I am sure I'll have this every summer for years to come."
5.0,"Thinner material than I am used to, and thinner gel liner, too, which I thought I might not like as much.  However, I feel better contact with my split seat, Selle SMP, which I believe helps it do it's job better.  It is also the only shorts I could find that don't have a center seam in the crotch area, greatly eliminating chafing of sensitive areas.  Other advantages I am discovering -- no heavy elastic band on the thigh -- hidden pockets with flaps on the thigh and lower back (great discovery).  These shorts have been redesigned rather than rehashed from older, more standard designs.  Happy cyclist here."
5.0,"Everything fits perfectly! The only thing that is a little big are the shoulder straps for the skirt, but easily fixable!! Love love love it! Thank you!!!"
5.0,"I was glad to have the opportunity to review these rings. I have been looking for new rings to wear and I enjoy these. The silver  looks really nice with my skin tone. They fit nicely on my ring finger as well, which is where I'd be wearing them. They are simple but cute! They came in nice packaging as well and were protected. They also arrived when expected."
5.0,"Very nice to wear it. Confortable, thin and easy to wash."
5.0,Love it and Thank you. I couldn't be happier !!! Shipping seemed a little on the slow side.
5.0,I love this sweatshirt. The print is so fun and it’s so soft! It fits very well (true to size). Great value for the price! Absolutely love it!
5.0,AMAZING HAT! GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS
5.0,"Fits nice, color is exact"
5.0,I loved it! It was so beautiful.  A little big for me but I was able to adjust it.
5.0,"Good quality product, my wife loves it<br />Fits most cell phones easily as well"
5.0,"Variety of sizing choices, looks nifty on me. About what you'd expect for 14$.<br /><br />I'm 5'8.5&#34;, around 155 pounds, and I got the upper medium size. Fits perfectly"
5.0,These are great and sturdy best value for the price!
5.0,I am a cheapest sock i can find type of guy 🤣 ive had warm wool boot socks that were padded in all the wrong places. I was very surprised at how comfortable these feel. I amm 100% staisfied
5.0,For me 68 yrs old it works great and excellent design.<br />I buy it again
5.0,"This is my second pair. I order these because they are meant for people with a lot of foot pain. I do not experience foot pain, however I have sensitive feet. Its very hard for me to walk on tile or outside on the patio barefoot. These slippers are extremely comfortable. I come home from work and immediately put these on. I wear them inside/outside wherever. The first pair lasted 2 years and the second seem to be on track for the same. I wear them everyday and this Christmas I'll order my 3rd pair. I don't write a lot of reviews, but these slippers deserve it. I do wish they came in a different color. When I first saw them they had blue ones. That being said I would order them in lime green if that's all they had. They are a little pricey, but money very well spent. Thx"
5.0,"Just purchased the Costa from Sole. I have other flips from Sole that I have worn for years, and have given me great service. These are even better. The main difference is the weight (much lighter) and the straps. The straps are soft and comfortable, and minimal to the point you almost don't notice them.  The footbed is supportive and moldable, and great for PF sufferers like me. Sole products were getting hard to find, so I'm very happy to have found these. They will be your new favorites!"
5.0,"It was well made,  I did buy different leggings for it as the ones that come with it are more like tights.  All together loved it."
5.0,"Gorgeous, wonderfully made"
5.0,"FANTASTIC!!! Great quality, style, durability features, and for less than $30. Best duffle bag ever owned, and I have gone through at least 15 in my lifetime. Designed to be stylish, far superior to the traditional 'gym bag'.......perfect for travel. Construction pluses includes a. fine zipper teeth making super easy open/close b. nice big quality chrome pulls...not cheap ones with string pulls c. separate inner lining with stylish imprinting.....not the cheap 'all in one outer/inner material' d. expensive/high quality/durable nylon exterior construction........not the traditional cheap PVC material ie I'm a chemist and know the difference e. 4 bottom feet to prevent dirty surface contact, although should be a bit higher to be more effective f. sooooo much more.......buy one, you'll be delighted for the next many years of service!"
5.0,Quality fabric.  Not see though.  Feels good on.
5.0,suns out guns out

5.0,"I think this floppy hat is so adorable with its large bow in the back, the hat is made of the same straw material as the hat and it has a black decorative trim made of cloth. I live on the Southeast coast where the sun is pretty strong in the summer and this hat will be great to wear when I relax on the beach with a good book. Since the rim is pretty large, It will protect not just my head but also my face from the strong sun rays. The hat is a little bit loose on my head and it's not adjustable, but it stays on pretty well and I don't plan to do any strenuous activities while wearing it. But overall, my favorite feature of this hat is the large bow, it gives it a vintage look while looking fashionable."
5.0,They're the best.

5.0,"I've been buying these shoes for years (I get about 6-8 months from a pair). I have a tall arch and have to add support, but have had to add support to almost every shoe I've ever worn. I wore them every day during a month long winter rafting trip through the Grand Canyon and they performed perfectly. I will buy them again."

5.0,Could have gone down a size but still worked well. Definitely better quality than expected. Has a nice weight to it and is also extremely comfortable. Perfect for my Dr. Seuss day celebration.
5.0,"I really like these handy little bottles. They are a good size, the spray stem is long so you can cut it to the desired length, they come with labels you can apply, and have many uses.  if you use them for cooking spray or butcher block oil like I do, they do not clog up.  But, since they are glass, be careful about not breaking them because these shatter in tiny slivers if broken. I received an order with a broken bottle and many slivers in the box. Amazon Customer Service was great and quickly replaced. So just be careful if you have kids or pets or a smarty cat like mine who intentionally knocks things off a table or shelf to remind you she is bored and it is play time - now. Needless to say, I can't leave these cute bottles sitting out with her around, but they are perfect for what I bought them for."
5.0,"I LOVE this dress! Flows like a dream l, and I've had so many compliments. It's a little low cut for my taste so I did safety pin the top to cover a bit more. But nonetheless this is one of my favorite dresses."

I just received my eighth Burei watch and I consider Burei on par with some of the watches I have in my collection costing two to three times as much as the fine timepieces made by Burei. Most of Burei watches come with sapphire crystals can cost thirty to sixty dollars each without installing them. Thanks Burei and Amazon"

It's quickly become one of my two or three favorite shirts.<br /><br />The cut and fit are very flattering on an athletic build, and it pairs perfectly with a black sports bra.<br /><br />I've worn it with shorts, capri leggings, and ankle leggings and it's looked great with everything.<br /><br />I'm 5'5&#34;, 147lbs, muscular build, and the medium fits me snugly but perfectly.<br /><br />I love the feel of this tank so much that I immediately ordered another one in solid purple.

5.0,"I wore these for a recent gig as I sing for a Beatles-oriented band in SW PA. Although they didn't show up real well under the intense light of the huge par can lights, the folks in the audience were crazy about them when I was circulating amongst them. Some of the ladies insisted on turning me on multiple times, and that's always a good thing. Very easy to wear and to use, and changing the batteries is easy. Also several videos on YouTube for help in usage."

5.0,"Not as soft as other material, but for the price and the fit I couldn’t pass it up. I got a size medium which is normally my size on bottom and on top im a small, but it fit perfectly on top, be mindful that it’s a set with the same size so it’ll be difficult if you’re not the same size all over. I got the black color and Im def getting more."

5.0,Received damaged and was given a refund. I really wanted the shirt for my Son but got a shirt somewhere else.
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress!! I loved it so much, i ordered it in 6 different prints. The navy flowers and the ms6216-16 are my favorites. It runs a little big. I ordered an X-large first but had to exchange it for a large. The fabric is very light and flowy, not stretchy. Its very flattering. Shoulder straps are adjustable which is great for me. The solids are different fabric, like cheap jersey knit, I returned those. Be careful where you order from, I ordered a different print from another vendor and it was not at all the same dress!"

5.0,"I bought a size up and it fits well, but it's not long in the body, so if you have a long torso or as well endowed, it might be too short. I love love love the message and it's a soft, comfy material."

5.0,Absolutely stunning on. Finally a bathing suit in which I feel comfortable in. Love!
5.0,"Looks great, for the price!!"
5.0,"Does a pretty good job.  The plastic tweezers are a must because you can't use metal to fish your coin out.  The basket is also handy.  I use it along with a coin cleaner to get the dirt off and between the two you can sometimes come out with a beautiful coin.  Use on your keepers and other coins that not ever going to go to the grader to be slabbed.  You will probably get your coin back with the dreaded CLEANED instead of a grade.  I use it on some ""DUG"" coins  to  make them readable which I consider a necessary evil for a coin that is not going anywhere except a collection or showcase."
5.0,Very happy with my purchase! Love the real leather. I am allergic to most metal belt buckles but I have not had any reaction to this one yet.
5.0,"Nothing to dislike. The medallion slipped in easily, yet feels secure. The key ring is sturdy, not likely to lose my key. It’s size makes it easy to find in my purse, but not too big to fit in a pocket. Unisex design okay for for anyone. I’ll be buying this as gifts in the future."
5.0,"Very comfortable and warm, like this item."
5.0,Pleased with Purchase.  Well made and warm.
5.0,I am completely happy with the set I received. Quality is good enough and consistent. My family use straps for sunglasses. Straps work great for kids and adults as far as length is adjustable. My two sons loved picking their favorite color from the five in the set.

This is my ""2nd"" purchase of this bra and i just bought a third. Its like im patanoid ill never find this bra again. Like anywhere.  Its unusual and fits perfect.  U can not find this in a store. Also looked at other versions on amazon which are for sale. Im paranoid it wont be the same. Ruffle zig zag cutt on the bottom. I need more of these bras. Im literally worried i wont find this bra again. How long will this model, this brand, this make be for sale on amazon?  I don't know. But i love this bra soo much, im gonna buy so many at a time to make sure i have a few years worth! Thats what! And thats my review. I don't do reviews often.

5.0,"(Over a year later I still love this chaplet! It's as beautiful as the day I bought it. Still my favorite. I just had it blessed because I always keep it a 8th me!)* This Chaplet has rapidly become my favorite chaplet.. I'm especially devoted to St. Michael, so I've got more than a few chaplets, but I find myself using this one nearly every day. I regret that I only got one of them, I love the way that it feel in my hands, despite its small size it feels sturdy in my hands: the Labradorite &amp; Onyx are a lovely combination. The findings and bead spacers make it unique. This chaplet is also unique in the way it's made: it's beads are strung together on strong, nylon wrapped wire instead of being linked, this makes it look petite even though it feels substantial in my hands. The craftsmanship and beauty made it well worth it's price. I hope that it will be available again in the future."
5.0,"I have the ""rainbow"" pattern/color and I enjoy wearing this fun, casual piece. They look great with jeggings or black or white tights (although anyone who ventures out in white leggings is a BRAVE soul). The fabric of the 'sweatshirt' is lightweight enough to wear right when it starts getting a tad cooler and you won't overheat.<br /><br />It really is much more fun than i can describe from the picture. I took it out of the plastic and exclaimed in pleasure because I love the bright colors and the combination was eye catching. The value for the quality of the shirt is more than  pretty decent."
5.0,Super soft and fits great.
5.0,"For the price, it is a great shirt. Very comfortable. Easy to wear not tucked in."
5.0,"Very nice, good quality mask.  It's even lined for comfort."
5.0,"I love these jeans! I've been looking for a pair of high waist skinnies for a while now. These jeans are exactly what I was looking for. I ordered a five but due to their stretchy material, I will be ordering a 3 next pair."
5.0,"I'm 5'0 220 lbs in a chunky chick and I'm short and this fit like a cute mini dress. I ordered the large and it was still loose on me, so def runs BIG! I just had a baby and it really did conceal my tummy nicely and the slits are extremely revealing but super sexy! Love it buying the burgundy next!"
5.0,Cute top. Lots of compliments. It shows midriff theoufh the lace so if youre not into that you may not like it. Runs a tad big but wasnt a problem.
5.0,"Second order of these Tummy Toning Briefs. Love them, fits great and very pretty. Leopard one is included which is one of my favorite prints. Highly recommend."
5.0,Fabulous does not wrinkle at all and super comfortable
5.0,I like jeans with hight waist ✅
5.0,"This shirt is super cute! I got so many compliments on it- and tons of people asked where I got it. Didn’t expect it to really fit well, but it did. It’s fitted, so if you feel comfortable with it being form fitting, you won’t regret it.<br /> Love it!! Buying more colors"
5.0,Just as pictured and fast delivery
5.0,OMG I love these boots!! I'm 5'1 and wear an 8.5 I thought I should go a size up but glad I didn't. They fit true to size and are easy to walk in very comfy and very sexy.
5.0,Great little beach dress.... light weight but not see through.
5.0,This watch is really durable<br />I'm a trash man and just needed something cheap and durable this has exceeded all expectations
5.0,I purchased this dress in a large and then purchased in a medium.  The large fits (it's just a TAD big) but I purchased the medium to see if it would give it more of a bodycon feel/look.  The medium fits (tad shorter than I would like) but overall I like the way the large fits better.  Will be returning the medium.
5.0,Very nice just wish larger in arms
5.0,My 89 year old father  has cold feet and loves these socks.
5.0,My daughter's favorite socks. Ordering again.
5.0,"I love these boots so much I bought another pair for myself, different design. Then I decided to buy my son a pair for Christmas, gave it to him during Thanksgiving. I love the design, they are soft and and water proof."
5.0,"Incredibly impressed when I opened this package. The box it comes in has the official Star Wars logo on the outside, and high quality images from the movie/posters of Kylo Ren on the inside. It opens/closes with a magnetic clasp. Heck, I like the box just as much as the necklace!<br /><br />The necklace is a little bit small-ish, but that only makes it more cute and endearing like the BB-8 of the movie. Mine was carefully encased in a layer of plastic/tape that was easy to remove, and did a good job of protecting the stainless steel cut design from scratching. Can't wait to wear this lil guy!"
5.0,"Realistic grinch face! Was a tad hard to see out of but once I got used to it it was fine.  If you're looking to be the grinch and don't want to break the bank, this mask is perfect. They eyes are so realistic and the facial area feels like skin."
5.0,When I opened the box today when these came in the mail I had to go and look again to see what I had paid for them.<br />I was shocked!<br />What incredibly beautiful earrings at such an incredible price.<br />They also offer these earrings in so many lovely colors.<br />Hurry and order several pair for yourself or for gifts before the seller realizes that they are not charging enough money for them.
5.0,I'm a 29-30 waist & the large fits perfect.  They keep your package perfectly supported & in place if you're not a fan of it moving around.  I would definitely recommend these & am probably going to purchase another set.
5.0,These pj's are really cute and fit as expected. They fit as others I have tried in dept stores that are similar. I would buy them again as the quality is good.<br /><br />Update Post Washing & Drying: I washed these in cold and dried them on low and they came out looking great. No shrinking or issues. Fit as they did before washing.
5.0,Very easy to wear after having hand surgery
5.0,I love the material and the fit. If you are looking for leggings these are it
5.0,"this is pretty nice watch, easy adjustable with a nice toolkits, also I can easily adjust the date and weekdays, it works great for me so far."
5.0,This was a gift that my grand daughter gave to my wife and it is the little things that make the big things ♥
5.0,I loved everything about it.  The colors are vibrant.  The material is comfortable with a little stretch and it was not sheer.  Got plenty of compliments including from my hubby.  I'm definitely going to purchase a couple more.<br />I would highly recommend.  The dress I purchased did not wrinkle at all in suitcase.
5.0,"Cute, great color, AWESOME POCKETS!!! It says it’s “one size fits all“ since it has tie back straps for the waist and elastic thigh straps/snaps...BUT - I’m usually a L for bottoms and I know this would start to be an awkward fit on me if I was any bigger. It would start to sit really low at the waist and proportions would start to look weird. So it’s kinda lame it doesn’t come in bigger/curvy girl sizes, but I think this was from the 2018 season, so maybe they’ve fixed that?  I love the split leg feature. I have the duck apron also and it’s sometime problematic in the crotch area when moving around bc it’s not split leg.  This is also lighter weight and flex’s better than the duck apron, I got this bc I’m going to be painting my house soon and thought it would be more comfortable for extended wear."
5.0,get a lot of compliments on this necklace !
5.0,"Nice fit! I appreciate that it’s an effective minimizer, but has lacy delicate looking straps - something rarely found in good minimizers."
5.0,I love pocket watches and this a a great quality watch. Works wonderfully and has an amazing finish. Would definitely recommend
5.0,Nice!!!!
5.0,Have used these for about a month with zero issues. I use them for getting fresh produce and I love that I don’t end up with a bunch of plastic bags! Glad I purchased these!
5.0,I like the bi=fold much better than the tri-fold i had been using and it is very soft and high quality leather
5.0,"Fue un regalo que le di a mi sobrina.<br />Quedó encantada, justo lo que quería"
5.0,Used to make a wine stopper.
5.0,"Me gusto mucho el diseno, la rapidez de la transaccion y la entrega del mismo!"
5.0,Had to take a business trip and these made packing so much easier as well as unpacking when I arrived at my destination.
5.0,I absolutely love this dress and was surprised at how well made the dress is! I am going to order in every color. It is perfect for summer. I also just had a baby and it is a super easy outfit to breastfeed in!
5.0,"The Lands' End Mens Short Sleeve Supima Polo Papaya Orange Regular X-Large fits as expected and is just what I was seeking in terms of color, size and value"
5.0,"Love the feel of this material. In this TX beating sun, this material doesn’t add to the heat. It’s soft and breathes. I’m able to protect my arms and enjoy the game. Not so with others."
5.0,Cute and my granddaughter’s name
5.0,Love this dress. I got a medium. I have big boobs 38f and this fit perfectly.
5.0,"Live the color, perfect for summer"
5.0,"I am 5'2"" and wiegh 112 pounds.  I bought amedium size and love them.  There is just enough compression, but not skin tight.  Material feels great and they wash up nice on gentle cycle, hang dry.  I wanted to order another package of them but there aren't any medium sizes available yet.  I've tried a lot of tank tops for running and these are my favorite.  Can't beat the price, either!"
5.0,I love these. They are so comfortable for my 3 year old daughter. She loves them and keeps her glasses in place. She doesn’t even realize she has them on.
5.0,"I LOVE THESE! They fit PERFECTLY everywhere, length, my waist etc. They're not see through either. I love the stitching, and lines going down the leg, they make your legs look slimmer, and offer a cute pattern to the pants. The waistband is great too! It doesn't roll down when I sit, like some other leggings tend to do. My phone even fits into the little pocket, without making them fall down. Another pair of leggings I have are too wek at the waistband to put anything in the pocket, as it makes the top roll down.<br />These are perfect for running errands, going to class, lounging around home, and what they're originally for, yoga. They're sooo soft and smooth too! They feel great on, they're super comfy. And everyone knows comfortable leggings make working out a little less horrible. :)"
5.0,Love these. Can't wait to get prescription. I recommend highly!!
5.0,"This shirt turned out to be a pleasant surprise!  I received it on time, and packaged neatly.  I am 5'1 - 140lb - 36DD and generally wear a medium; however, I took the advise of a few viewers and ordered up two sizes, purchased XL.  I ordered two sizes because I was worried about the tight fit around my arms.  To my delight it actually fit perfectly for a loose fit; no buckling around the chest area, light weight, and the side panels help accent a women's curves perfectly.  I do want a little more of a tighter fit, so I am going to order it in the lighter wash and go down a size to a large and see if it gives me a more fitted appearance and still have arm space.<br /><br />I must say, it is a matter of what you are comfortable with, so if you want a loose comfy fit - XL, but if you want a more fitted appearance possibly L.  I'll follow up if I decide to try the L."
5.0,"I am so glad I found these! I was having a problem with breaking out from any replacement fit bit band. I would develop a red raised itchy rash from any replacement band. These bands solved my issue. They fit well, are very comfortable and I hardly notice that Iam wearing them. They snap in securely, and I haven’t had a problem with them popping out.  I will definitely be purchasing in other colors."
5.0,"Xxl- 5’7 160lb My height is mostly legs, so my torso is shorter... tank is long but not to long, just a little longer than my other tanks..The tank is nice! Fits snug but not to snug! (Lotus flowers dwn back) is a little lower that I would think they should be, but still I love the design. Very cute"
5.0,"When my watch and broke, I needed a new one right away.  This watch band is even better than I expected.  It is expensive looking, but reasonably priced!  It was fairly easy to put on the watch and adjust the fit."
5.0,My girls really liked these!
5.0,Looks good! Like size! Haven't used it yet!
5.0,These scarves are soft and the colors are very beautiful. They are a bit stinky right out of the package but a quick run through the washer/dryer and you're good to go!
5.0,"Very nice, seem well made and the price Was affordable"
5.0,"Fits great super comfortable Order your size im 5""7 190lbs and xl is perfect"
5.0,Well made. Feels great. Bought them for winter walking. Now I’m beginning to wear them more often around the home. They also look good on casual zoom calls. Nice addition during Covid times.
5.0,"Fine everyday earrings, not the strongest backs but they work."
5.0,It's a cute workout top! I tie a double knot in the back to keep the shirt from flipping open :-)
5.0,Adorable gloves! They fit my eight year old well and she loves them!
5.0,Material is thin and keeps my guy cool and comfortable.
5.0,I received so many compliment at a wedding I attended! Will order more!
5.0,There cool man were & On time..<br /><br />Thanks!
5.0,"Love the fit, feel & look!!"
5.0,Exactly what I wanted. Not sure how long they'll last but they'll be perfect for vacation.
5.0,"I love this product, besides the price is well worth it very elegant. At first I bought pattern 1 and I didn't like the color on me, I kind of wanted to try patter 2 but I have a lot of black in my closet and I was trying to get away from that. Well than I did get patter 3 and I really like it, sort of my comfort zone because of all the flowers but really pretty. Usually I am a size L-XI and I don't like things to snug my arms. I weight 164 and I am 5'0 feet tall. I got the XL and although is a little long in the front it fits perfect."
5.0,These socks are amazing. They fit perfectly. I thought they would be tight or uncomfortable but they are wonderful. I often have problems with my feet swelling horribly during the day.  I can come home and put these on and the swelling is gone quickly. I just wish I had gotten them sooner.
5.0,Me gusta mucho la cintura no se enrolla con el movimiento lo recomiendo .las tallas de la cintura son perfectas .pero muy largo simplemente compraré Mediano no más L
5.0,Beautiful and great price...bought for my daughter's wedding for the Bridesmaids.
5.0,Super cute!!! Will purchase again!
5.0,"Seems to fit as (for the most part) intended. There's about an inch of extra Velcro, thought doesn't seem too noticeable on the &#34;grey&#34; headband, but very noticable on the white one. Could still be a little longer for my head, but does fit nice. Fits better on my 4-year old relative."
5.0,"I am absolutely in love with the size, shape, and color of these gems 🧡 they were the perfect stones to honor the memory of my tarantula"
5.0,Great value purchase. They do what they are intended to do. Quality seems on par with my Rogue straps.
5.0,My son get this with his own money and loves it.
5.0,These are actually really comfy but also a good amount of compression. I’m 5’1” so most shorter leggings don’t fit right on the legs but these worked. They hit at about a 7/8 length but that works for me. I’m about 153lbs and I got a medium and it fit perfect. Would totally buy more.
5.0,"I am 5'11, so finding any outfits like this seemed near impossible.  It fits great and is stunning!"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.  Perfect for flower girl or Firstborn Communion.  The quality was great and it was shipped faster than I expected. Thank you!
5.0,Purchase a size up the shirt it was a little bit small
5.0,I love this wig! Fits great!! Bought it for Raven cosplay and was very impressed.
5.0,Es muy buena calidad
5.0,"Great, lightweight tote.  Roomy and easy to carry, although I wish the handles were just a speck longer (by my measure, about 9.5 inches)."
5.0,Perfect to give to nurses to let them know you care!! They’re well made and cute!
5.0,"My nights use to be somewhat chilly, as I leave my heat at around 60 or so. These made the chilly nights completely fine as my legs are warm but not sweaty at all. It feels like my legs are being firmly hugged by clouds."
5.0,"These are very well made. They are nice and thick and would be great for Winter here in Florida. (By winter I mean below 65 degrees). They help up well in the wash and dryer, but did fade a tiny bit."
5.0,Arrived on time and as described
5.0,vibrant colors
5.0,"This badge with my dogs picture is Beautiful, wow just like in the ad. I love it is great thank you very much.i tell everyone to buy it."
5.0,"Great shirt for medieval reenactments or local Renaissance festivals. I like the material due to the fact that its not too heavy or thing and it holds up rather well. Looks very authentic...well at least as a costume and wearing it makes one feel rather dashing. Puffy sleeves at wrist take a bit of getting used to which makes me  appreciate how far fashion has evolved. Well made, good material, and a must buy for anyone looking for a shirt to go with their costume."
5.0,A great hat for the price!
5.0,"Much more comfortable and easier to put on/take off than compression socks.  I use them to reduce swelling in my feet, and that has improved.  I like the graduated compression difference from the ankle to knee, as well."
5.0,Super cute and fits well!
5.0,"It's one of my go to hats now. I like the design, color and fabric plus the weight is good enough for all year use. The wool / polyester blend is not super thick so that works out well. I may even buy another one so when this one wears out."
5.0,These are THE cutest things ever!  I bought these for myself and my daughter decided she needed them.  She never takes them out and are very comfortable to sleep in.  I will purchase a pair for myself soon.
5.0,Great tie! People will see you a mile a way!
5.0,This fits so well and keeps the girls in place! The padding is THICK which helps the support and makes boobs look good. They are removable which is a plus. I love the style and fit!
5.0,My granddaughter really liked it.  She wants to wear it all the time with her new tops.
5.0,My ears have become super sensitive as I've gotten older so I can't wear anything less than sterling these days. Finding hoops to fit my tragus piercings in sterling silver (as they are generally &#34;childrens hoops&#34;) has been a challenge but these are wonderful. I used to have a pair just like this but lost one of them earlier this year. I've had these in for two days (after painfully having in sterling PLATED which was causing me all kinds of pain)  and my ears are SO thankful. What I like about these for my tragus piercings is they are easy to get in and don't poke me when I'm sleeping. I am impossibly stupid when it comes to getting endless hoops in my ears so I'm always on the lookout for clasps like these.
5.0,"Picked this up for a Christmas gift for wife. She loves it. She says it has a very room drawer with lots of compartments for her makeup gear. It looks nice, especially compared to all that plasticky stuff out there. It sits on her counter near her sink. Great seller, great transaction!"
5.0,Friend recommended and had to purchase.
5.0,I love these gauges. My ears are currently a size 2g (6mm) and have been for the past 7 years. I love that they are 10mm in length which is shorter than most gauges for length. I feel like longer than that looks awkward for the size gauge I have. I also love that the flares are smaller than most and go in perfectly. Some might say they fall out easier but I find as long as your keeping your ears and the gauges clean from build up they stay in just fine.
5.0,Love these stockings ! Light weight with just the right amount of compression.
5.0,Great for its intended purpose
5.0,"These are invaluable to me. As my favorite bras are always being discontinued, and comfortable full-figure bras are almost impossible to find, these extenders are a life saver to me. They're well made & comfortable."
5.0,It's very comfortable I enjoy wearing it while riding my motorcycle
5.0,Great Great wallet. Pockets for everything -- just as pictured.  The yellow is less 'mustard' and more 'canary'.  Quick arrival. Very happy with this purchase. Will look for other Travelambo products next time I need travel accessories.
5.0,Super cute! True to size! So warm!! Will definitely purchase more!
5.0,This dress was too cute and good quality I got size 4-5T for my 2yr old toddler and was a perfect fit.
5.0,This is very comfortable to wear.
5.0,Very cute and trendy
5.0,"is just as expected, cute, compact, perfect! the wallet has more than enough spaces for my cards, although i do double up on slots and i do not carry too many. the only thing i would have to say is a down side of this wallet was the smell that it emitted when i first got it. it smell like like plastic heavily, but now that it has been in the open air for a while, the smell is no longer there."
5.0,"Fits true to size. So cute, comfortable and affordable! An absolute must for your summer wardrobe!!"
5.0,If you like BIG pocketbooks this is a great one!
5.0,They're great!1 can now read my smart phone when the sun is shinning.
5.0,Looks like a bracelet. Love that it dresses up my fitbit!!
5.0,My girlfriend absolutely loves this scarf.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:652b4e5234215ee76df9c36946f5172b]] Got this hat and love the fit.
5.0,really great
5.0,This dress was beautiful! It was very soft and flattering. I’m 5’3 and the length wasn’t too long like it usually is with maxis. The material was very soft and comfortable!
5.0,These shorts are very comfortable and not see through. They don’t ride up and I could wear them all day! I love that it has pockets; I definitely recommend. I just ordered another paid in a different color!
5.0,I wasn't sure what to expect but these are beautiful! They are light and very elegant. I received so many compliments when I wore them. My ears are typically sensitive but I had no issues with these earrings. Will order more for sure!
5.0,Quality for good. Price was better than other places I had checked.
5.0,These yoga pants are great! I ordered a small which is what I'm usually and they fit perfectly! They are light but not too thin!
5.0,"This is a really stunning watch for the price. Both the hour dials & the markers are glossy black & not silver which I really love. It has the exact design of the MVMT 40 series for much cheaper. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,"I absolutely love these bags. I do not really care for the print, but love the function. They hang on the Winco carts just right. I hung one while shopping and it protected my soft items. They hold a lot but not so much where it is hard to lift the bag. I will get more for my friends and family."
5.0,I love this shirt. It's gorgeous. it fits small so if you going to order this shirt order it a size bigger. I order in a size medium and I'm ussually a small. but I am in lovvve I will be wearing it for my birthday coming up;.
5.0,"FAVORITE BRACLET!!!<br />Its big, so my wrist isn't suffering...<br />Its just... exactly what i needed to be wearing"
5.0,"This dress is simple and yet super gorgeous! Just add an accessory, heels and a clutch, and you're all set! I received tons of compliments throughout the night. Before choosing this dress to wear for a last minute company Christmas party I of course read the reviews and a lot of people commented on how well it fits and surprisingly how good the quality of the material is. And I agree 100%.<br /><br />I ordered a size 4/6 and my cup size is a 32&#34;, waist 24&#34; and hips 36&#34;. It was a tad too big in the bust area so I had to make little alterations (which took no longer than 10minutes to hand sew) on the arm length to keep the top of the dress from falling. Usually long dresses are way to long for me (my height 4'11&#34;), but my 6&#34; heels made the dress perfect to where it's barely touching the floor.<br /><br />It is definitely a great buy based on how good the price is compared to how well the dress is made. I don't usually post reviews but I feel like this dress is well deserving for a good review to add on their list and I believe every woman needs to have one of these dresses in their closet. :) ♡♡♡"
5.0,Love the watch! It is so good to get something that is really good. I wear it  often.
5.0,Bought this for my 78 year old mom. She loves the suit! She said it was very comfortable!
5.0,Shines bright like a diamond clean. Perfect gift love the value pack saves u a lot of money . I would recommend this classy gift for anyone to get the chain shines bright as well. Does not break you out or make u itch. Does not turn your neck colors.
5.0,So sweet
5.0,Fix good
5.0,I bought two. Perfect.  I LOVE THEM.  beautiful sturdy. Wood gorgeous
5.0,These work great. They fit over glasses and yet can just be flipped up to read things if necessary without the distortion of the double lenses.
5.0,Great for everyday. My daughter loves them.
5.0,"This visor is adjustable and fits great.  Because visor is adjustable, there is no hard strap like other visors which tend to feel like a clamp on your head.  For the price, this visor is very comfortable and looks good."
5.0,"Masks for very well with both ear cords and the velcro snap for adjustable fit.  The filters are slightly off, but still do the job.<br />Great value compared to those ordered from overseas.  Those seem to be seconds off the line.<br />I would order these again for value and quick delivery."
5.0,I got this backpack for my 5 yr old.  It is not too small nor is it too big.  It is a quality backpack and the price was great!
5.0,Love it!!!!😊
5.0,Received additional bag-love it.  Makes traveling so much more organized.
5.0,"What flattering tunic or dress.  Can be worn alone or with leggings and is very versatile.<br />The fit is as expected with room for a heavier bottom half because of the near a-line cut. Colors are as shown, vibrant but subtle."
5.0,"I ordered this for a bday dinner, and am so glad I stuck with this one. I ordered probably 5 dresses, and this was the most comfortable, the fabric is light and flowy, and the colors are vibrant. I've already planned to buy in a different color. Perfect for a casual day (I paired with converse)."
5.0,This is what I always tell my wife so she absolutely loves it.
5.0,Beautiful color but sizing runs small and large and xl fits same (like med). Other of same brand/style fit like should.
5.0,Nice and roomy bag for the gym or as a travelling bag. Enough compartments to separate out things and the shoe slot is fantastic. The strap lays comfortably over your chest or use the handles to carry it like a normal bag.
5.0,Nice purse ... Just like the picture
5.0,Love that I can have such a wonderful hat...ear muffs...and visor in one!!<br />Staying warm sometimes is NOT fashionable!!!!
5.0,I love my cactus charm and so dud my friend I gifted one too!<br />It will be have fond memories
5.0,very cute...gave them to teen grand daughter and she loved them as part of her steampunk look<br />great addition to the steampunk look
5.0,"Nice cap, authentic logo. Easily adjustable for different size fits."
5.0,For the price... its worth it
5.0,"Came so early! I ordered this nice long sleeve shirt for my cousin..But I wanted to try it myself first, can't help my self so I tried it and it's cute.. It's perfect to wear on Autumn and Spring seasons..It's soft and breathable so it's comfortable to wear..<br />Good quality and I highly recommend it to all women out there.. I'm sure you'd like this long sleeve shirt too like I do.. I'm thinking to order another one for me, small size..Since this one is for my cousin..hehe"
5.0,Beautiful! Wear with crop top. You'll look like princess Jasmine.
5.0,awesome fit!
5.0,"Cool glasses, my first experience with the amber blue blocking tint. The photo, though, led me to believe the glasses came with a sleeve/case. Not so."
5.0,Great earnings. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,This hoodie was perfect fit great material my husband loves it.
5.0,"I love thick headbands for my dreads & this one is perfect! It holds my dreads great & it does not move or slip off even when I sleep with it! It's very snug but not enough to cause irritation. Its also very breathable, I almost forget i have it on. I'm highly satisfied with the quality & reasonable price! I do hope they come out with more colors to choose from."
5.0,I absolutely love these joggers! If you are on the fence (and think for the price these are probably junk) YOU ARE WRONG! Stop thinking and put these in your cart you will NOT regret it! For size reference I’m 5’7” 140lbs ordered a medium and they fit beautifully. So comfortable and can dress them up or lounge in them all day!
5.0,So very pretty. A little larger than I thought but they add so much class to your outfit.
5.0,"Good quality, latch and indent hold very nicely."
5.0,"Wow, this dress fit me like a glove. I'm a size 14-16 P (5'4&#34;, 200 lbs, 40D, 35&#34; waist). The material is light but sturdy to hold shape, stretchy for my bust and just so darn flirty and fun. I love it and will be ordering another one. I wish this came in more colors."
5.0,My husband passed in 2020 and this angel wings with the heart ring is a perfect tribute to his memory. I have received so many compliments on it. It would make a great gift since it also comes in a pretty ring box. Definitely worth the money!
5.0,My brother seems to like it

5.0,"Love this shirt! Perfect tie-up white tee wardrobe staple. Was hesitant about this because this price is so low, but the shirt is actually really high quality! Very lightweight cotton, it's a bit sheer - but with a cute bra top underneath it's perfect! Sizing is accurate - and shipping was WAY WAY WAY faster than I expected it to be! So happy with this purchase, will be purchasing the other colors as well! *note that the shirt does look a bit wrinkled in the photo, it's only because it's a bit loose and not skin tight which is great!!<br /><br />Update : I bought all three colors, all ft perfectly and are great quality"
5.0,"Nice materials, adjustable straps, flattering night dress."
5.0,"Originally thought paid too much, but I love this shirt. Fits perfectly, great material - I'll have to see how it holds up in the wash, but I expect it will do great - high quality."

5.0,"Very nice tee, but slightly smaller than expected for my tiny 9-year-old niece."

5.0,This is a really pretty necklace. The diamond looks like it’s floating.
5.0,Loved the product and very sexy.
5.0,"I love the whole wide leg fun  flowy trouser.. I bought a pair at target... ewwww horrible fit, went right back! I read the reviews on these and they are pretty spot on! They are sheer but you can work with them.  I purchased the black and with a booty short or thin legging you are fine to wear in cooler weather.  I am 5'6' 135 pounds and these are baggy but flattering, do not clinging to the wrong areas, I am athletic built, thick kind of boy shape and I LOVE THEM! they are long but not too long, I am wearing with pointed toe flats and do not  drag as when you walk they flow with you, I will not cut them.  A little trick is that you can fold down the top to take up the leg about 2' if you want to be able to wear with flats and heels.  I am going to wear with a platform slip on sneaker...I saw it on one of the high end models in a catalog!!! :)"
5.0,These are the best tennis shoes
5.0,Awesome Product
5.0,"Soft material. They do run a little small and the fabric feels rather thin so I am not sure how long these will last<br />Edit: After having had them for quite a while, it turns out, they are very stretchy and comfortable and seem to last very well. Just got another set!"
5.0,"Husband loves it, super cute and stylish"
5.0,"This hat is very good quality for the price and the fuzzy ball is removable, which is a good feature."
5.0,My daughter loves them for her unborn son - so happy i found them -
5.0,Love the look. Love the fit
5.0,Ordered this for my grand daughters 11th birthday and she absolutely loves it..She had tears in  her eyes and said thank you so much Mimi
5.0,I Love it. Value for money. I added my Rx lense to it.<br />The colour is a little darker than display but still a good buy<br />Getting my second pair now.
5.0,Looked great on our friend.
5.0,"I purchased this item to wear randomly for the fun of it, but I have issues keeping it on my ear. Although my sister (Who is 16) loves the item and has taken all the other Dragon-Earring items I purchased for myself since she can fit it onto her ear.<br /><br />Why it doesn't fit; It is supposed to hook onto the side of your ear, but I can't get the clamp around the cartilage.<br /><br />But otherwise it's a fun little item for a younger crowd, and it does look fantastic. The craftsmanship is wonderful, and I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a special little trinket."
5.0,"I LOVE these pants. I first bought them at an airport shop of all places, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. The best part about these is the waist - the pants are baggy, but the elastic at the waist cinches just right, not snug but firm enough to keep from falling off. Those of us that like our PJ pants a little baggy will understand. I've bought both the XL and L, and the waist of both stayed put without even tying the strings! What a miracle."
5.0,I got this necklace for my mom and I was so amazed by all the details that went into this necklace! It still looks cohesive and has a very natural flow! The stone in the middle of the heart is very shiny and the angel wings and infinity sign match without looking too busy! The necklace was also packaged with a cloth for shining the jewelry which is perfect!
5.0,I was kind of leery to order a dress off of Amazon but the fabric is nice and thick not see through whatsoever. it is a great dress and it fits exactly as it should.
5.0,My daughter loves this item. She wears it all the time for bed!
5.0,"I've been wearing this product every day for 3 months and it still looks just like the day I bought it.  I was skeptical that it would last, but it's absolutely perfect.  I do not wear to bed or in shower/pool and not while exercising."
5.0,Lovely bamboo and paper parasol...am using it in an Asian tablescape.
5.0,Very well made lapel of the puerto rican flag. Wish it was a little bigger.
5.0,THIS NECKLACE ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION AND IT RESEMBLES THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT IS POSTED ON AMAZON.COM.<br />I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS STUNNING NECKLACE AND IT MATCHES A LAUREN RALPH LAUREN DRESS PERFECTLY.
5.0,This is good quality and made a great gift!
5.0,Love these! So soft!
5.0,Great for price. Came quickly
5.0,"This is metal and very real. It's a little stiff and you need to oil it to make it move smoothly, but then it works fine"
5.0,Lost 1 of the pair of these years ago. Was excited to find them. They're perfect! Love the size and they are really good quality. Already Bought another pair in different color.
5.0,Cheerful and comfortable

5.0,Mother's day present for church
5.0,Bought as a gift for my mother-in-law and she loves it!
5.0,"I love my OCCI Chiari progressive multi focus glasses.  They are clear and allow me to read, do computer work, and look across the room.  I really enjoy being able to keep my glasses on all day.  They are comfortable on my face and ears.  They are lightweight and not too big on my face.  The only improvement I can think of is that there seems to be a little correction in the distance part of the lens.  It would be nice if there was not any correction in that area.  These glasses are so worth the money.  I love them!!!  Thank you!"
5.0,"I bought this for myself for two reasons. One, just for the hell of it and two because I am a HUGE batman fan! As soon as I got it I  immediately hooked it to my car keys. It's not too bulky or too small. It's just the right size. I plan to buy more of batmans friends and his enemies. Thanks so much!!!<br /><br />&#60;P.S&#62;<br />Delivery service was extremely fast. Thank you for not making me wait so damn long!!!"
5.0,cute and comfortable but hard to keep shoe tied kept coming undone
5.0,To protect my hands
5.0,My daughter loves this! Very cute
5.0,My mother has severe osteoarthritis in her hands.  Her Dr and physical therapist recommended them to wear at night.  They have really helped with the pain not only at night but during the day too.
5.0,"As a person with light eyes who has never experienced the gift of polarized lenses, these are fantastic!!  I break/misplace my shades more than id like to admit, so i wanted something that wouldn't break the bank but still protect my eyes and look great!  The lenses in the provided pic are a little more pink and a little less mirrored than they really are but they are absolutely adorable. They fit great look great and help my light eyes! I would definitely recommend these and buy more when i (inevitably) break these!"
5.0,"Love this hoodie! Arrived ahead of schedule, looks just like the pics and material is quality. Very happy I bought this as a gift to myself. 😃"

5.0,"I love this suit that I purchased for my 2.5 lo. I got a size up and I am so glad I did. The top was a tad bigger, not too much tho. The material is super soft and handles the washing machine well. It says to handwash."
5.0,I love these leggings!  Very comfortable and stretchy.  Thick enough so no see through.

5.0,They fade after about 2 weeks of wear
5.0,This accent added glam to my shoes. They are super cute
5.0,"Received these sunglasses today and they have surprised me. Normally sunglasses don't seem to fit me very well, but these felt super comfortable as soon as I put them on. No pressure on the temples, sit on the bridge of my nose nicely, the oversize lenses are flattering, and they don't feel flimsy. May have to buy a few more pairs in the future once I've had a chance to wear them for awhile."
5.0,elegant looking and fits perfectly
5.0,Love it. Fits great and light weight.
5.0,"Great belt! Very soft, but strong. Very happy with this purchase. I would buy again. Package was super sleek and rich looking. It was an amazing gift."
5.0,Nice quality no complaints. Thank you!
5.0,"So comfy, SO SOFT. Not at all like the reviews. Fits kind of loose too which is just amazing. After reading all of the bad reviews I was hesitant, but wanted it anyway. Loved it so much that I bought two different colors. Worth it entirely. My new very very favorite sweater."
5.0,Fit perfect dont feel cheap.
5.0,This sweater is great quality and is exactly as pictured!!! I love that it can be dressed up or down. Check out chicbutsouthern.com for more style tips or follow me on insta @kaileystudhalter.
5.0,"So cute! The colors run a little bit in the wash, so watch out for that. Otherwise, comfy and fits the way they should. Our whole family is going to wear these on the Polar Express and take our Christmas card picture in them. Can't wait!"
5.0,Have not used them yet. But they look good
5.0,As shown very pretty !
5.0,Love this dress.  The fit was prefect.  I was appropriate for a wedding and evening event.  Now I need it different colors.
5.0,"I ordered a Medium (which I usually wear) and it was a perfect fit. I am 5' tall, 165 lbs, 36B cup. Washed this as stated on the label, threw it into the dryer and had no shrinkage - still perfect. Fabric is soft, has some stretch, totally breathable, and lovely to wear for warmer weather. The buttons work, so you can open up the neck if you'd like. There's elastic at the wrist to make the sleeves a nice balloon style. Because I'm short, the back covers nearly all of my bottom. Thrilled with this top. Such nice quality and exactly as described. Will likely order in other colors (I ordered white and it's a bit of a cream, but still white, if that makes sense). Would recommend."
5.0,"I like the texture of the base color, the logos are incredible and unlike common or popular New Era hats. This sports hat has it's own unique look with the designs ot has."
5.0,IT'S AMAZING AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!
5.0,Nice outfit for the price. Light comfortable and cute. Fits very well.
5.0,Very nice fit and great buy for the money!!!
5.0,My boy loved it.  He puts all his superhero shirts and costumes in it and carries it around the house all day.  It is pretty sturdy and the zippers seems to hold together well.
5.0,"I love the vintage look of this dress.<br />This is a cute dress for my daughter. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
5.0,Great hat!  Warm and comfortable.
5.0,This dress is gorgeous!
5.0,Love these boots. I wear a size 7 shoe so I got a size 8 and they fit great. So comfortable I wear them as slippers also. They keep my feet so warm.
5.0,THE PICTURE OF THIS RING LOOKS THE SAME AS IT DOES ON REAL LIFE. HOPEFULLY THE SILVERPLATE IS REAL.
5.0,I’m happy fits perfect 👌🏽
5.0,"This hat is great. It fits and feels exactly how I imagined from the picture. I have eye issues, so I like to have a brimmed hat on in addition to sunglasses. I've tried a couple sunny days so far and it seems good.<br />Brim aside, the hat itself is also comfortable and warm. The ear flaps are tight enough to be warm, but flexible enough that I can fit my ear clip headphones on."
5.0,"Great quality, great variety of colors/designs."
5.0,"I love Toad &Co. clothes, they seem to fit extremely well even with my average weight fluctuations of 5-10 lbs. I’m 5’5”, 130-140 pounds, 34D. I bought a medium and it fits me perfectly."
5.0,Love it! It has the perfect amount of space - not too much and not too little.
5.0,They really are free size / one size fits all. Im about 190lbs and they are perfect.  The material is really comfortable. They're quite slimming. Can't beat the price for such a great legging. I purchased the 6 pack so they ended up being only $5 each!
5.0,They are AWESOME! I live that everyone is different. Makes socks fun again! Great gift for quirky friends!
5.0,Comfortable easy to wear
5.0,cute and quality is good
5.0,"Warm and fit well.  I've washed them a couple of times.  Air dried them.  No loose threads, no problems."

5.0,"Great quality.....stylish, skinny is in!"
5.0,"Really looks and feels great, worth the price, will be buying more"
5.0,I bought this lab coat for my 10 year old daughter for a presentation she had as a scientist. This lab coat is well made and fits well. Great purchase!
5.0,Gorgeous ring
5.0,I love this bracelet!!! It’s absolutely beautiful!!! It’s true to size and I recommend this to anyone.
5.0,"These are very comfortable and good quality pants. They can be dressed up or dressed down depending on the top you wear. Also, it has lots of material, so it looks not cheap. I got green pants, color is very good. I would probably appreciate if the seller/manufacturer does exactly same style in solid colors."
5.0,"Used this for a suit and dress for a wedding we were flying across the country for. We ended up bringing it along as a carry-on. We had no issues with the size going through security or bringing it on the plane. The straps and material are really sturdy. We overstuffed it (1 full men's suit, 1 cocktail dress, 1 pair of men's dress pants, 2 pairs of dress shoes, and 1 button-up men's shirt) and it did great! Would definitely recommend."
5.0,The socks are very comfortable and feel soothing and warm.  Should be great on colder winter days.  They feel so luxurious and are a way to pamper your feet!!
5.0,Gave as Easter socks to all the Mom's in the family and they loved them.

5.0,My wife loves the earrings.
5.0,Fast delivery. Quality product
5.0,"Really nice. At first I thought it had a slight chemical smell, but I think that has faded."
5.0,Beautiful and such a great price...
5.0,"Great..light  to wear,"
5.0,This double red heart is made very well and the red color is vivid.<br />This charm fits many themes in my necklace.

5.0,Great fit hides belly and sleeves cover fat upper arms
5.0,I love my cellphone case.  Fits perfectly
5.0,"The pictures don't do the masks justice.  So pretty, soft, and comfortable.  Arrived faster than expected."
5.0,I am happy to have found this vendor because i had a great pair a while ago but i needed new ones. I tried 2 others from amazon and they both sucked. tHese worked great! I was bale to wear them all night without them falling off.
5.0,My boobs look great in this shirt. Low cut bra with one button undone and wonderful
5.0,"From reading other reviews, I ordered this dress 1 size up in an XL, although I usually wear a L, and it fit perfectly!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!  It is a true bodycon fit and gave me more curves than I've ever had!  I wore it for New Year's Eve and got so many compliments!  Great!  Highly recommend it."
5.0,"I love this  beautiful style of scarfs, easy wrap and very elegant"
5.0,Good quality and beautiful pattern! Really like it.
5.0,"Comfortable, light weight, sizing is correct. Looks good."

5.0,Got these yesterday and my little boy loved them.  The fit is perfect and he is just ecstatic to be wearing boxers like dad.

5.0,"ordered these masks due to the ongoing covid situation.these masks are of very good quality,they fit well and look great!!as recommended by cdc 3 layers,and the price is great for the quality you get!!!"
5.0,It is a great quality bracelet. It looks great and I Love when I find jewelry that's made in the USA!
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she absolutely loved it. The pendant itself is definitely a great size. I was afraid that it would be incredibly small, but it wasn't. The crystals inside are very bright. It's not ridiculously gaudy, so it pairs well with different types of outfits. I could see it worn with a t-shirt and jeans or with a cocktail dress."
5.0,"The quality of these jeans far, far exceeded my expectations!!!!"
5.0,"Love this dress.  Super soft, and has pockets! I'm 5'4"" about 135lbs and ordered the small the 2nd time.  The medium was way too big.  The small is still a little loose but I wore it with a belt on my waist.  The length it a little longer than it looked on the model... but that's to be expected when you are just over 5ft."
5.0,"LOOK GREAT, got a lot of compliments"
5.0,Used this spray with goggles for tournament fishing in winter.  Works perfectly.  It's nearly impossible to keep goggles fog free when it's 29°out but this spray does it.  Will always keep some on hand.
5.0,Very good quality material! I'm very pleased!
5.0,My husband loves these flip flops.  The bottle opener underneath most Reef styles is really handy!
5.0,Product fits great for my newborn. Also material is soft.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:86dba8c755987318dbd7e13ce1e318e1]] Unfortunately the first one I had in I swallowed because I apparently didn't tighten it enough this one has been in since and it's definitely set properly and doesn't rub on the roof of my mouth as much as the other one did. Will purchase again.
5.0,"Last year, I bought 3 different socks to use for training and the run itself. Swiftwick is the best one yet. It doesn't slip, it has enough cushion but not thick enough that my feet feel cramped in my shoes, and it really is absorbent. I wear a 6.5 shoe size. SMALL is the perfect sock size for me."
5.0,"Everything I expected. Fit good, felt good, was good.....until my puppy chewed them up."
5.0,I love them! The colors are so pretty.
5.0,perferct little gift
5.0,look like it cost $100 and its very strong
5.0,A bit big for my face but overall loved them.
5.0,"I can’t say enough about this wallet! This is my second one. First one lasted three years before it fell apart. Holds everything I need: cash, cards, pen, phone, and it doesn’t allow me to throw random junk in my purse. Everyone asks me about it when I’m at the checkout register. Looks like a tiny trapper keeper with a wrist band. I pass through security checkpoints in a breeze because they don’t have to do any digging!"
5.0,"Warm, soft and beautifully made"
5.0,As described ... no surprises ... would use again
5.0,"Gave to husband as gift, he loved it!!!"
5.0,"My girlfriend, Sapphire LOVES them."
5.0,"Very pretty.  Fits well.  (125lbs - small).  I ended up returning it because it wasn't really my style, but pretty dress."
5.0,Well made . Quality!!!
5.0,"Cute and versatile, especially when I don't want to tote around a large bag!"
5.0,"Wow, I am impressed by the quality of these cufflinks. Its beautiful and very classy. They look much better in person. I am so glad I bought it as a Valentine's Day gift. I would recommend this product to everyone. I hope there could be more gold cufflinks in the near future. Thank you"
5.0,"I don’t often write reviews but these bracelets far exceeded my expectations. I’m a bracelet collector and am so impressed with these. The quality and true boho ethnic  vibes are amazing. Sizing was good. I have 6” wrists and though the adjustable slide ones fit best, the button closure ones were not too big. They fit more like a bangle but totally works. The designs and details were above average! And that the bracelets are helping women is a huge plus. Highly recommend for gift or for self. Best quality wax cord bracelets I’ve encountered."
5.0,This is a super cute and fun tshirt. I love the graphics and the colors. The description doesn’t state the fiber content so if you want to know it’s 65% cotton and 35% polyester. My xl shirt runs just a bit small but still wearable. If you want a loose fit then order a size up. The fabric is soft.<br />I washed mine inside out on gentle cool and dried it on low and it came out nicely with no damage to the graphic.<br />This is definitely a great shirt for casual summer days and nights.
5.0,"These socks are perfect - the material, thickness, style, and the length - everything I wanted!!  I've been searching for socks that are stylish and not thick for a very long time because I find that most socks are too thick and too plain (boring/ugly).  The bow prints on these socks are very nice touch.  Also these socks retain the shape well after washing them (I recommend air dry).  Please make more of these.  I would like to order more!"
5.0,I got this for my daughter to where to her graduation and it looks amazing on her. Fit is perfect.
5.0,"While I had placed this watch on my list for a later purchase, I received this as a gift.  There is nothing to say bad about it.  It is a high quality watch at an amazing price.  I like wearing it, I am proud to wear it, and It is very comfortable wearing it daily all day.  It may not have the posh name of other Swiss watches, but that's the plus. The bottom line is that it is a classy watch which has quality well above its price."
5.0,"Good shoe, just ordered wrong size and had to ship it back (female, vans shoe size: 7.5 mens and 9. womens, this shoe was 2 sizes too small.) returning this product was an easy process. Thank you so much"
5.0,I love that I can slip them on. The fabric is soft and comfortable.
5.0,My son loves his watch its great for a 6 year old wanting to learn time.
5.0,"Daughter loves her new dress, and I like the modest fit and length. Washed great. Seller communication was great too. Thank you"
5.0,"From the moment I opened the box I knew I was going to like everything about this necklace.  The quality materials, skillful assembly, attention to detail, and beautiful packaging made this a truly satisfying purchase.  Also, for those who may be unfamiliar, the beads are on an elastic cord which is a bit stretchy (but not too much so), allowing it to be easily wrapped around the wrist a few times for wearing as a bracelet."
5.0,Perfect!! Super cozy
5.0,Beautiful colors! Have received many compliments at work!
5.0,"these are a tiny bit smaller that some I bought singly, so medium size I'd say. Breathable so glasses hardly ever fog up. A good value."
5.0,"Arrived quickly, and is just the gift I wanted for a child."
5.0,The silky feel is fantastic and I love how many pieces I got with this set. So great! Makes falling asleep feel impossibly comfy. Very highly recommend.
5.0,"Beautiful quality piece with Nice weight. Easy to order, good shipping time and nicely packaged. Will order again makes a beautiful gift!"
5.0,It was a Christmas present for our daughter and she was just tickled with it.  Leather and great assembly
5.0,The dress is high in the front but low in the back. I’m 5’7 190lbs and I ordered a size xxl and the dress is form fitting.
5.0,Shorts are on the long side
5.0,I bought this dress in 2019.  I get so many compliments on it… I decided to look for it again and it’s no more.  For the price it is a basic dress but very attractive and easy to wear.  I am short so maybe that’s why it’s perfect for me.  I love the frills … not sure why others don’t like it.
5.0,Belt is great fits the way you want  and the quality bare non.
5.0,I love it. Very pretty! I am very tall so I ordered a longer chain to put it on...but it fits well enough that it doesn't choke me.
5.0,"Buying same dress, different color"
5.0,I purchased the very last one! I LOVE MY SHOES! OMG THEY FIT PERFECTLY AND I AM VERY HAPPY!!!! THESE ARE REAL AUTHENTIC NIKE AIR MAX SHOES!
5.0,"Surprised by the quality/price ratio, comparable to $75 shorts. GREAT PRODUCT for the money."
5.0,"THESE ARE VERY NICE, WILL COME IN HANDY, FOR MY FLIGHT FROM PA. TO FL."
5.0,Length to the floor.
5.0,"These are very comfortable,  true to size, and they don't smell like some plugs often do. I wear them daily."
5.0,"Like these super light Silver hoops and that there is no backing to deal with.  I have short hair cut around the ears, and heavy, thick hoops are a bit overwhelming."
5.0,"Great fit, true to size. Love the material. Breathable.  Comfortable  WE love them"
5.0,Super comfy and exactly what I hoped. I love it!
5.0,"This top is so pretty.  I wanted a more neutral color so got it in the gray.<br />Did get it in a size up from my normal size.  Glad that I did.<br />The cowl neck isn't as big as the picture shows.  Looks more like a larger turtle neck rather than a cowl.<br />Arms are nice and long.  The length comes down to about my hips.  Nice length, just wish it was a little longer.<br />Many like their butts covered if they wear leggings.  If you're short waisted, this shirt might be long enough for you.  If you're long waisted, and want your bottom covered, this top wouldn't do it.<br />But, looks fantastic with a pair of jeans, sweatpants, or even certain dress pants.<br />Shirt is nice and soft.  Very comfortable to wear."
5.0,Very nice and elegant.
5.0,Excellent and beautiful watch! I love the blue accented by the dark leather I have 2 Bureis my other is a gold and silver with same style but a metal wrist strap... thing. I gotta say the leather strap with a clasp is kinda weird but not enough to fault by a star. I did however fault the other watch I have despite me liking the other one more because the metal wrist strap came with no sophisticated tool to pop the pins out and it was a nightmare to get right. This however is a little strange but ready straight out of the box and is a excellent functioning and beautiful watch. If your on the fence just buy it you will LOVE it!
5.0,Great fit! So cute and fun!
5.0,Works great!! Can wear on arm or ankle. Fits securely. No worry that Fitbit will fall out.
5.0,"Perfect for costume party, just as pictured"
5.0,I love them.  Magnets are very strong
5.0,"Its really good, the One i wanting."
5.0,Absolutely love it! Picked it to match my husband for our anniversary.  It fit perfectly and even had adjustable straps to help my girls stay up all night! Beautiful dress!
5.0,"True to size, great quality and perfect for my tween."
5.0,"The embroidery is top notch, the colors are beautiful. Every hockey game I've worn my Guinness jersey to, at least 2 or 3 people have tried to buy it right off my back! more than happy with this jersey and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves guinness, or hockey, or both."
5.0,I really like it. Makes me look like I have a waist. Even though I don't.
5.0,Not many if any matching pairs so it's great if you are not worried about that
5.0,"First and foremost- I love this ring. It's so sturdy, true to color, comfortable, and lightweight. The journey to get to this point was a wild one though. I usually wear a size 7, so I ordered a 7. The first package was totally empty. No ring, just packaging. Weird, so I ordered a replacement. It came and there was a ring, but it was too tight. It squeezed my chubby little finger. So I sent it back and ordered a size 8, which fit beautifully. Unfortunately after a week of wearing it, it caused this itchy raw red rash on the inner half of my finger. I'm SO sad because I love this ring so much. My husband has the ""man"" version of this ring and had been wearing it for 6 months straight with no issue and he loves it. I think I'm just too sensitive. I would still reccomend it though, regardless of the ups and downs."
5.0,Nice sentimental gift for mother-in-law.
5.0,I got this product for the winter rides to and from work to wear under my motorcycle helmet. Does the job of keeping the wind off and as well as the night time bugs.
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter she's almost 2 and it fit and looked adorable !!
5.0,This is really cute. Looks like real silver. It’s a gift for my friend’s birthday. Looks pretty after wearing too.
5.0,Fits great.  Comfortable.
5.0,"For the price with a hard case it's tough to beat. I ordered two pair, one for each vehicle. So far I am getting less head aches from the sun. The polarized part of them is odd, the glasses kind of make holograms of different colors, as well as for fishing they didn't reduce the glare as much as I expected, maybe 30% reduction.<br />But for the price, they are functional."
5.0,I wish this was made in more colors. I bought it in a medium and I wear a size 8-10. It fit perfectly and hides flaws well.
5.0,"I am not a big sneaker person and didn't even realize these were things that existed until my son asked for some to keep his Nikes from creasing. For some reason, we didn't catch that there were four pairs in this package so that's really great. They are marked as being for either the left or right shoe. He initially put a pair in his Blazers and he said for those sneakers, they didn't make a ton of difference since they don't crease as easily. But he just got a pair of Air Force 1's for Christmas and he was singing the praises of these things in those sneakers. He also said they are comfortable, so you don't notice them in your shoes. He gives them 5 stars."
5.0,My daughter loved it. The dress fit perfectly on her.  The material felt soft so it wouldn't irritate her skin. Great for dress up.
5.0,I like the look. The stainless steel key ring looks like it was machined.
5.0,I love these small stud earrings. They are petite but because of the antiqued silver the turquoise stones stand out. I will probably wear them every day with hoops in other piercings. They arrived sooner than expected too.
5.0,Perfect product!
5.0,So comfy! I got the white leopard pattern and love it. I ordered size up because I wanted a little more room in the waist...didn't need but definitely more comfortably this way.  Perfect after the beach after shower and before dinner =}
5.0,Bought for daughter. She loves it
5.0,LLLLOVE this shirt
5.0,Great fit good quality and true to picture.
5.0,"For being able to easily write on cups and glasses to be able to differentiate them without damaging the glasses then these butter pens are the way. They easily and gently write on surfaces and then just using a damp cloth, wipe off and leave the cups unmarked. The different colors allow you to mix it up or to use a different color depending on what color drinks you have so you can still see it. I did receive these butter pens at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and rating which I have provided above."
5.0,Socks are great. Colors bright and and actually stay on the baby’s feet longer than 15 seconds. They were delivered right on time.
5.0,"So cute! Light weight, minimalist and dainty. Very versatile and the gold color is soft and not fake looking. It fits like shown. Happy with the purchase."
5.0,Perfect fit amaZing dark wine color
5.0,Really looks great and fits perfectly
5.0,Actually used these belts as tie-backs for outdoor drapes and they work perfectly!
5.0,perfect fit for my sunglasses
5.0,Wanted something different for my rook piercing that was noticeable. This is perfect. It was easier than anticipated to put in but I did struggle a bit to get the gem in only because it is a strange angle. I’ve had no irritation and will probably get another in a second color.
5.0,"This was so cute! I purchased it to have a bag to keep in my car with diapers, wipes, sippy cup, a couple of toys and silverware to have it handy when I have my granddaughter. It holds everything perfectly and is so much better than her diaper bag. She's 2 and loves it too."
5.0,I was surprised when I opened it with mixed feelings. But it turned out right for me. Lovely dress
5.0,Nice hat! Not for super cold weather.
5.0,Perfect for rotator cuff surgery
5.0,Fabulous!!
5.0,Came on time and work well
5.0,These are great little inexpensive dresses.  Easy to wear and comfy.  They wash well.
5.0,I bought 6 for my aunts and they love it.
5.0,Lots of compliments - nice color and bling
5.0,Perfect addition to my bracelet
5.0,It's perfect just as pictured and what  I have been looking for great<br />product and excellent price
5.0,Nice but need to remove when sleeping
5.0,"A year later, this shirt is still one of my son's favorites. He has worn it once or twice per week for the last year- to school, play, or store. It gets washed and dried after every wear and still looks absolutely brand new. No fading, no picks, nothing.... I'm looking to buy other patterns of the same type now and decided to leave a review."
5.0,First… Thanks Joe for five star service. Second…quality hat at a great price. Third…wearing it proudly. Corpsman up!
5.0,"This is more beautiful than I originally thought.  The fit is great, and I will buying it in some of the other colors I saw.  I think this is beautiful and demure."
5.0,"Great $29 dupe. One previous reviewer called it “authentic”. It’s most definitely not authentic, but it is very close to the real deal."
5.0,"Súper bien<br />Use 2 pares y muy cómodas y protegen del frío perfectamente, las use en mi viaje a las montañas nevadas -15°C"
5.0,Cute leg Warner's works good under boots giving you the boot cuff look which I like. Definitely going to buy additional colors
5.0,"I LOVE this scarf. It is sooo soft and is surprisingly full. It came folded flat in a small package, but really has some volume once you style it around your neck. I am so surprised at the value. I would really expect to pay more for this! It takes a couple weeks to arrive, but is so worth it.<br /><br />I ordered this with another scarf. A few days later I ordered others from the same company. I can't wait for them to come too, now! :)"
5.0,These are nice quality and look great.  Definatelly look like they cost alot more than they do.
5.0,Bought for 3 year old for helping dad on lawn mower and hockey games. She likes to wear and will keep on which is saying something for thier comfort. Adjustable to an extent. They seem snug when I put them on 3 year old but says they don't feel tight. I love the ear protection for loud lawn mower and crowds at hockey game. Quality product good construction
5.0,"This has become my favorite ring,  the weight is just right,  it also gets a lot of compliments!"
5.0,I love it. Its a bit low cut for me but I can easily fix that.
5.0,I love it.  Very pretty!
5.0,I love the fact that there are pockets to hold my iPhone so I can record my steps.  They are so comfortable and while silky feeling they are warm.
5.0,I purchased these for my 18 month old. I purchased in size 7 and they are way too big right now but I am pleased to say when she does grow into them they will be perfect. Exactly as pictured. There appear to be some lights on the bottom but they dont light up. I couldnt complain if I wanted to.
5.0,"seems a tad big for a large, but that could just be at first glance, straight/stiff out of the packaging. On that, sweatshirt was packaged well and looks amazing, vibrant colors. On the thinner side, lightweight.. i'll be interested to see how the fabric feels after a wash. Otherwise the shipment was prompt and smooth. A++"
5.0,Lovely bag that goes with a lot of outfits !
5.0,"Great hoodie, fit perfectly!"
5.0,"I love this because it covers my tummy without being a total ""mom bathing suit"". I got tons of compliments. I bought a medium. It's perfect!"
5.0,Great for my business
5.0,"Super cute and comfy.. I ordered my regular size, but ended up exchanging for a half size up. Easy exchange!"
5.0,This is absolutely beautiful! It fits so perfectly and is so comfortable. I wish it came in more colors! I want more of these!
5.0,Love this headband the lining is very soft and doesn’t slip
5.0,I really like this hat. It fits perfectly and the color is unique. The only negative thing I have to say about this hat is it came with a really bad smell. I just sprayed it and it was fine again.
5.0,"Yes, cotton, soft but size the medium a little snug!! Expect a little more room. But otherwise great choice for my 13 year old son."
5.0,"Most of these have the dog tag like chain, which always come unclassped. These have a ring. Sturdy."
5.0,"These stretchy lanyards are perfect for my kids who wear the heck out of their masks at school.  Yes, we are face to face school--5 days a week!  So they use them very much!  Very easy for me to take them off and wash the mask and then put it back on the next day to match their mask.  Love all the colors!"
5.0,So cute nice quality
5.0,These are adorable and my 2.5 year old seems very comfortable in them. Bonus is that she can put them on herself!
5.0,"Very nice, exactly what i wanted. Some of the natural stone pieces are slightly different from each other but that's to be expected and are still beautiful. The saddle is very slight so when put in they are loose, but my ear adjusts after the lubricant has been absorbed and I'm not afraid the will fall out. I ordered the 12mm or 1/2 inch."
5.0,My daughter just turned 9 and she loved this bracelet. It was perfect. The clip is strong so it's not easy to lose.
5.0,Beautiful dress. I received so many compliments all night long. Order this dress. I recommend a good spanx if needed. Zippers and hooks will show in this dress. Not thin but it will reveal.
5.0,Loved these hats. Happy to find some that were relatively inexpensive. Used them as Christmas gifts in the family gift exchange. My 12 yr old nephew loved his.
5.0,First time going with anything other then fox 180 pants. The flex airs are not even close to the same thing so much better of a pant fitment and move ability is so much better. They feel great on as well. Definitely worth the money.
5.0,"Creative design, very detailed. Makes me want to pet a cat and eat sushi at the same time. Odd combo but greatly satisfying purchase. Very happy with my purchase, would buy again."
5.0,This was perfect! I’m 5ft and wanted a tutu for these goofy pictures I did and didn’t want a super short tutu and this was perfect!
5.0,just find
5.0,"Super cozy, perfect for my hardwood flooring"
5.0,Fits as expected. Good fall/spring coat.
5.0,I was unsure by the picture if this bracelet would be too clunky. It is actually perfect and very easy to add and remove links to adjust size.
5.0,"Love this dress!!! I bought it the green color (not olive). I'm 5'3&#34; and about 179 pounds (carrying most of my weight in my bottom half) and bought a large. It fits very comfortably, I don't have to unzip it to put it on, it just slides over my head! Super cute, and very sexy without over doing it."
5.0,Esta muy cómoda!
5.0,They are super thin yet strong which is what I wanted. Love the product.
5.0,"So comfortable and looks really, really good!"
5.0,My son absolutely loves these slides. They do run a little small so I would suggest sizing up one size. We will definitely be purchasing them again!
5.0,I gave four stars to durability only because it thought it was stainless.  If I I’m even slightly sweating it will turn my arm green.  The was disappointing.
5.0,These pants are great. They are high quality. Not thin. Very comfortable and look much more expensive than the price you pay. I’m going to buy more.
5.0,"Very high quality socks, Love them!"
5.0,"I am way past my slim days, so I tend to stay stay away from 'slim-fit' clothes, regardless of the size. I like this shirt, however. It's not too slim cut. I am 6'2"", 211 lbs. and this feels fine in an EXL. It's got some shape to it, but it is not body hugging. The faux inner collar and wrist material give it a bit of style.  The material is soft  and not ""polyesterish."" Nice change for an old dude."
5.0,It is fascinating.
5.0,Love the blend of heritage and family. Nice Celic necklace.
5.0,Dress was absolutely gorgeous but I ordered one size too big. Definitely recommend
5.0,One of the better masks I have purchased. Not too hot during extended use. Comfortable.
5.0,Great shirt. Fits comfortably. Would buy again.
5.0,The bracelet is beautiful. I like it very much. The bracelet is packed nicely.
5.0,Nice and thick. Great size and very sturdy material. I think they will last me a long time.
5.0,"I love these jeans, they are perfect and fit great!"
5.0,One if the best purchases I ever made on Amazon. I wore it with a petticoat and got compliments all day. I wear a size 6 and I'm 5'6 so I bought the small. It fit perfect. The material stretches!
5.0,"OMG, I fell in love with this the moment I saw it on Amazon! I KNEW it was going to complete my Halloween costume, and I was right! The material is a nice soft, thick cotton. Very well made! I would even wear this to work during Halloween to get everyone in the spirit!"
5.0,"Nice quality strap for the price.  Leather is soft and supple and the size was spot on. My only complaint is that the color is not quite as dark as it appears to be on here, but I know it will get darker over time."
5.0,Delivered as expected looked great in the gift box too. My partner loved the personalized message with our date on it.
5.0,I bought these loved them and bought an extra pair !
5.0,LOVE this dress!  It's flowy and perfect for summer.  It's so nice to have a summer dress that has pockets!  I can't wait to order another in a different color.  Word to the wise - it is pretty thin so I don't recommend getting a light color.
5.0,she loves it thank you
5.0,This scarf went well with the outfit I sported for my mother's 55th Birthday. I got a lot of compliments on it the whole night. I brought a second one because how comfy it is.
5.0,I'm 5ft 115 lb I ordered a Small & it fits perfect !!! I'm very aware that is very difficult for someone with my height that the dress will be very long l so I was  prepared to get it  altered ....
5.0,"disclaimer, i got this product free or discounted and am giving my honest and unbiased opinion.<br />so i had to wait awhile to receive this but when i did, i was instantly happy with what i got. material is nice and it fits perfectly. the size chart u choose from is , accurate, as some times when i order a size frm amazon it comes way to big fora medium, more like a large, but this one didnt, it came exactly how i expected. i love the design, really simply, and the fact that it doesnt show much. my son even complimented me on how he loved it. ."
5.0,My fiancé loves them!
5.0,"I ordered the XL and it was too large.  I am returning it for a large.  I wear a size 16.  The dress is made of fairly decent material and does have stretch.  I would suggest ordering a size down, unless you like to wear your dresses loose."
5.0,Great shoes for my feet. Needed extra support. And they look nice enough.
5.0,loved product
5.0,"I now have three pair.  These are so comfortable, I am not sure how I have missed these all these years."
5.0,This shirt is so very soft to the touch.
5.0,"Love these as much as my vionics!!!<br />Comfort, arch, soft, holds shape, cute!"
5.0,Love it so comfortable
5.0,NICE!  Very thick and heavy ring.  Feels very well made.
5.0,Quick shipping!! Product as listed.
5.0,I always get compliments when I wear this beauty. Great fashion for such a low price
5.0,Very fun & light so doesn't feel like it's glued to your face when it gets hot.
5.0,Love this dress! Great quality and fit perfectly
5.0,This is a very nice summer dress.
5.0,Nice 80’s looking winder.  They do a great job of given the watch a look that is pretty close to getting a version from the factory back in the day.  I have ordered multiple different watches at different times and this seller has great responsiveness and watches.
5.0,"I was worried about the size, I usually wear XL but chose to order the XXL and it was true to size! I don't mind though because I like that it is flowy and gives me the option to wear it wrapped or have it open and flowy! Wore it twice and got so many compliments on it and felt very comfy in it!"
5.0,"All and all the seems like a very good product, although the original package did lack a couple of parts, we returned it and they sent us a new bag with all the necessary parts."
5.0,Great Buy
5.0,I took this dress to a wedding in Italy. Got a lot of compliments. It’s a beautiful dress.
5.0,My daughter loves it. It looks and feels like it costs more then what it was worth.
5.0,Just got all of these beautiful colors and they are amazing! This is my first time using stone and I'm in love. These are top quality at an unbeatable price. These can be worn by both men and women and look gorgeous! I've had will many compliments by people that are for and against ear stretching. I've gotten a few &#34;negative&#34; remarks by a few people asking why I would spend so much money on ear jewelry. Everyone thinks these are crazy super expensive and that i'm irresponsible for spending that kind ofmoney on them. LOL Jokes on them!
5.0,Absolutely Love! I have been searching for linen pajamas for a while and they can get pretty expensive. This was around $80 and I thought it would be worth a try.  LOVE!<br />Things to think about:<br />Came with a weird storage smell but washed right out.<br />I am a true medium and the medium fit me great. This is a slimmer fit so bear that in mind.  I have thinner legs so I didn’t have an issue with it being too tight like previous reviews.<br />Top is boxier so heavy chested like me works great!
5.0,"A nice product but when buying for children, these are too big for 5 yr. old's - I bought these for the T-Ball team but the slipped down repeatedly on the little ones so we ended up not using them - for 7 & 8 yr. old's these would have been perfect."
5.0,These earmuffs are nicely padded and fit comfortably over my ears.  They also fold neatly for storage.  The attached tag indicates they may be hand washed and machine dried on low.  I like them so much that I may purchase another pair in a different color.
5.0,Beautiful... I ordered a size up. Fits perfect!
5.0,Love it & the husband loves me in it thank you so much
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. The color is amazing and it’s so comfy! I will be purchasing the other colors, it’s adorable! I’m 5’1 and weigh 153 pounds and the M fit me perfectly. It was a little long, but I was able to tie the bottoms and it was super cute! Would recommend! You can dress it up and down. Just an overall perfect dress!"
5.0,Got the size right ( my fault) good quality. prompt shiiped
5.0,It’s very beautiful the color is alive and not dull. My Fiancé loves it
5.0,"It feels comfortable, soft, it shows off my body well, it fits well, it's a perfect product."
5.0,These are great shorts and a great price for a 3 pack
5.0,Super soft and thicker than most hoodies. Going to keep me nice and warm this winter. Will order more.
5.0,"The stones are very pretty. I got the heart shape. They are small; they are a tiny bit bigger than a dime.  but I like small jewelry. I just wish the chain was a bit longer. But overall; for the price, its a good deal. I'm happy with my purchase."
5.0,A women's shoe size 7 is a medium --great look
5.0,Very happy with my purchase. I’ve already purchased 2 more as Christmas gift.
5.0,Excellent  item. Received earlier than stated. Love it.
5.0,It’s thick and durable just as stated and the company has great customer service.
5.0,"Wow!  So I got these because we live in Florida and we always need swim goggles...always!  These are amazing!  On all of our other swim goggles, adjusting the size was a really huge pain in the swim trunks, but these are so incredibly easy.  We can adjust them for anyone's head, big or small.  They came in a really nice plastic case, a little different from the case the blue Pulabecs came in, but just as nice!  They came with what appear to be different size things for different size nose bridges maybe?  Anyway, I didn't need them!  They ready to go right out of the fancy hard plastic case they came in!  I'm reviewing both the blue and the black ones, and they're both amazing swim goggles, so my review is mostly the same as well!<br /><br />The swim goggles are antifog and UV protected.  I actually used them with that plastic film they put on sunglasses with the writing on it?  Yeah, I didn't peel that off before using them, and I thought the view was so clean and clear.  You can imagine my delight in the clarity when I took the film off!  And then they suctioned right to my face around my eyes.  There was no water getting inside these things.  It sounded like a sonic boom when I unsuctioned them from my face...okay, I'm exaggerating, but they do make a sucky sound and you can tell how airtight they are.  I can't say enough good things about these...I guess my standards for swim goggles might have been low, but not anymore!  They're really clear, easy to adjust, and really easy to take on and off.  I'm looking at getting some for all the kids and adults for our next big family island vacation that's coming up.  It's the only way to keep them from borrowing mine!<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I buy a lot on Amazon, and I ALWAYS count on reviews to buy products that are worthy of my hard-earned money, so I hope my review helps you decide!"
5.0,"I got this wallet to be able to throw in my diaper bag and still have what I need with me.<br /><br />It's just big enough for a wallet, but not big enough to hold my cell phone and a lip gloss (what I was hoping to use it for)<br /><br />I ultimately returned it but only because of the lack of storage beyond being used as just a wallet.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to keep all of the credit cards, coins, bills, and reciepts organized ... this is for you!!! super cute and stylish!"
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits well was able to take on my vacation"

5.0,Wish they came in silver06

5.0,"I love him. Remind the kids he's gotta call santa to report for the say and suddenly my banshee toddler transforms into a sweet, innocent little cherub. AND the most Gnomie moves is to maybe lay down for a nap from time to time or switch from the mantle to the Christmas tree. Absolutely the best thing EVER. I recommend him to everyone who is sick of the elf."
5.0,My watchband arrived quickly and exactly as ordered. It's really soft leather - I love it!
5.0,My mother in law absolutely loved this necklace and it looked great on her at the wedding!

5.0,"Purchased as part of a Halloween costume, the jacket fit well. All seems were well sewn with no loose threads. The zipper worked well without any snags or trouble getting it started or completely undone. The graphic print on the jacket was a high resolution, with no easily visible pixilation or distortion. As for warmth it is a step above a windbreaker, but below a traditional hoodie. Should be a favorite jacket for some years to come."
5.0,This product exceeded my expectations. Very well made. I will definitely order from this company again.
5.0,"Smells like latex, but my Borderlands-obsessed son loves it."
5.0,This purse was actually better than I anticipated. It’s a small purse and not bulky which I prefer. I purchased the grey.

I ordered it a size larger than what I would normally wear (mostly Bc my boobs are big) and it fit to perfection!!! I highly recommend buying this dress!!!"
5.0,My wife loved the quality and design of this necklace.
5.0,"very soft, have multiple pairs, love them"
5.0,I have the same shoe in white and I love them. Comfortable and allow me to be on my feet long hours.
5.0,Very well priced and made. I purchased both the tan and black together. The instructions to trim to custom length was clear and the whole job only took a few minutes. The big surprise was the fact this belt stretches out a bit allowing for a very comfortable fit throughout the day. The ability to pull it tighter or to let out some belt after a heavy lunch is quick and very easy. Very happy with this purchase and will buy again if I need more.

5.0,"my waist is 40inches, and my chest is 38DD/40D, i wear an XL in clothing but had to order a XXXL, and it fits, these swimsuits did run small for me, their is another company selling these also and they run large, so its been an insane back and forth ordering and returning, but i did finally find a swimsuit that fits, it is nice, if you find the elastic band at the bottom of the top too restricting, just gently pull it with both hands until you hear the elastic pop, and it will relax it up nicely, bottoms are lined and are nice also, this has crisscross straps which allows for nicer support, the pads are removable so you can add bigger ones if you need to, or go without"
5.0,I really like the lenses. The lenses Fit perfectly and I love the color.

5.0,I love this.  I got so many compliments wearing it.  It is a silky material which I was not expecting but it does not make it any less wonderful.

5.0,"Love it, works great and I get a lot of compliments on it!"
5.0,Easy to put on.  Loving the color
5.0,Bought these for my daughter to use for volleyball practice. Great fit and feel but they do tend to bunch up and slip up the leg which was kinda to be expected. Would buy again.

5.0,this is the second bag i bought! they are so cute! and my LO has fine hair but the clips are well padded and wrapped with material that they are super great and protective
5.0,"Great price, looks just like advertised, and adds a nice amount of bling to an outfit.  Just what I was looking for."
5.0,"Love the product, but I did have an issue. I ordered the black and gray - I received the black, green, white pack.<br />I’m not docking stars because I still like the product, but I wish I got the right ones. Returning is too much of a hassle."

5.0,Reflective AF. I feel like a glamorous super trooper wearing these bad boys.
5.0,"Absolutely love this wallet. My husband and I traveled across Colombia, and this wallet stayed with me the entire time. It holds more than you may think, but is also thin enough that it doesn't take up a lot of space. I've actually started using it as my everyday wallet because it's so cute and convenient. It's also really well made and has not frayed or ripped in the 6+ months I've had it."
5.0,kids loved it
5.0,Un poco grande me quedó pero bien
5.0,This is such a cute and different band - with the cloth and the string style closure.<br />I love the color!<br />The quality is really nice.<br />The band fits my Apple Watch perfectly.<br />I am very happy with this band
5.0,Works Well! Small and lightweight.
5.0,Got a compliment the first day I used these for my gym sneakers. Adorable
5.0,"Minimalist wallet without any large (or small) logos. The leather feels authentic and durable and gets those manly scuff marks in all the right places. The threading seems high quality and its the perfect size for someone with less than 8 cards. I've tried a lot of products in this market and for under 20$, you can't beat it."
5.0,I’ve only tried it on to grasp the concept of it. It doesn’t seem to roll up and can get very tight. Does have a smell to it so I suggest maybe letting it air out first.
5.0,Wore these for a conference and got so many compliments on them. They were very comfortable which is what I was looking for because I had to wear them for almost 14 hours.<br />I would get another pair in a different color. The yellow was more brown than I was expecting but it still went great with a black blouse and pale pink kitten heels.
5.0,Lightweight and good
5.0,Great material! Very durable! Absolutely love this shirt!
5.0,"MY MOM IS A SIZE 9, I BOUGHT THE SAME SIZE BUT IT DIDN'T FIT WELL..., I RECOMEND TU BUY A SIZE UP"
5.0,I have had a pair of these gloves for over seven years now. The gloves have seen work in California and are now with me in Costa Rica and are still in good shape. I bought some more for my worker as the gloves available in Costa Rica don't last six months. These are the best you can buy.
5.0,I recommend that you size up one size if purchasing this item. I did that and it fits perfectly. The skirt is just as advertised and the quality is good. I am very pleased with the fast delivery and quality of item for the price. Would buy again if needed!
5.0,My daughter is 2 and it fit her head wonderfully! She loves it :)
5.0,"I got these for my Betsey Johnson Blue Bottoms with a rhinestone heel. I was concerned it wouldn’t fit over the rhinestones, but it fit perfectly! I was walking in the grass and on the lawn with no problem. Why it took me so long to try these I don’t know! But any even that takes place on a lean, you’ll want these."
5.0,"Nice Quality, fast service"
5.0,great item and great price love this item it is so sparkly  but it is not hard to take of like some glitter nail polish it dries great
5.0,"Well designed, perfect size, really comfortable, beautiful color, soft material, highly recommended for Pilates, it protects my tailbone...no regrets at all!!<br />I wasn't expecting 2 so it was a very good surprise!!"
5.0,Exactly like the picture!
5.0,Love it. But the only complaint I have is that the shorts were a little longer than I would have liked.
5.0,"These socks are super comfortable if you like to where sperrys or other shoes like that. They are pretty low cut socks so they perfect for vans, sperrys, etc... They also have three strips of thin rubber on the heels to keep them from slipping down. They do not affect how the socks feel all that much. They are pretty comfortable and they are pretty well aerated when you dont have shoes on. I would recommend these socks to anyone that like i said where boat shoes or van type shoes. They are decently priced for what they are and they do look really well. I have not torn a hole in one of them yet but i dont really wear socks to often without shoes outside the house. So if you like socks like this go ahead and grab a pair and you wont regret it! These would also make a good stocking stuffer for christmas if you got your kids shoes like i explained above. I received this product at a dicount for an honest and unbiased review!"
5.0,Mom loves the necklace. It's been a whole year and nothing has tarnished or broken.
5.0,"1st off if your a curvy girl like myself you know we’re alway skeptical about ordering stuff, we go straight to the comments!!

5.0,This is best mask so far that I've tried to keep my glasses from fogging up. I think the better nose wire design is the main reason.
5.0,"Easy to adjust and super comfortable. Not like the dollar store ones that stretch your eyes. Surprisingly, They still held the water out even though they’re a little big for my 4 year old. They even worked on me being a little small."

5.0,Love this shirt it was a super nice  material and it is now one of my favorite shirts love it
5.0,"Way better quality than what I was expecting. If you’re curvier, I’d suggest spanx. But seriously, the fabric is sort of stretchy, but not overly so. It’s a product that you’d spend fifty bucks easily fromCharlotte rise and better quality than you’d get there... it makes me feel sexy. Which is damn hard to do. I don’t write product reviews. So. If you’re questioning it... just buy this dress. It’s made for our curves. Do it."
5.0,My 7 year old gleamed when she received these sandals! They are gorgeous & good quality.

5.0,Amazing in every way. My brother loved it. Glasses are awesome.
5.0,This is one of the cutest hats I own. Totally worth the buy 030
5.0,100% recomendado
5.0,"I tried the Baby Bjorn, Hotslings, Infantino carrier, you name it and they all hurt my lower back.  This wrap is great, it distributes the weight so evenly that back and shoulders feel great after an hours walk.  It does take some practice getting in on, but after a while I could get the wrap on and my baby in without looking in a mirror.  It does have a tendency to get dirty, especially with the long tails that have to be on the ground when you are putting it on, but its machine washable and my off white wrap still looks great.  Only drawback, Moby says it goes up to 35-45#, but at 25# my son is too long and heavy for us both to be comfortable.  I will be switching to a toddler backpack, but the Moby has more than paid for itself and would highly recommend, just got one for my sister who had a baby!"
5.0,Beautiful dress.  Very sharp looking.
5.0,Excellent for driving.
5.0,It is very helpful during the rain days. My son loved it especially with the design and he loves putting it on by himself as it is very easy

5.0,"Awesome! The colors are just like the pictures. I use them to dry plop my curly hair and as long as you pull it down a little over your eyes, it won't fall off in your sleep. The material is stretchy, and can definitely accommodate most hair length."
5.0,"These shoes are great I have purchased several all great quality, substantial durability and classically elegant!"
5.0,So happy about this was a great present person Is very happy
5.0,Just beautiful  love the lever  lock beautiful  stone  thank you so very much perfect  earrings  love 💘 😻sadly  I will request  a replacement  lever back closer on one earring not closing  properly  they are  beautiful
5.0,It looks really nice. If you are blind as a bat like I am the Smal dials will be useless but it’s a cool watch 😀
5.0,"This is a gorgeous dress.  I am only 5 foot 3 and have great legs and want it to be at least three inches above my knee.  So, I will take it to my alterations person and have it shortened.  I love it. fabric is breezy and seems good quality chiffon.  I'm thrilled.  I normally wear a size 12-14 top and 8-10 bottom.  The XL fits really well in the shoulder and chest. It's a flowy, swing style and is very flattering."
5.0,"great for travel shoes, easy on off and very comfortable."
5.0,Looked fantastic on. Sizes aren't true.  A 3X fit a 12-14 women. A bit long on a 5ft 71/2in. Okay with high heels.
5.0,Worked as posted.
5.0,Very cute shirt for my college son's St. Nick Sock... Fits great and got him to laugh just befor finals.
5.0,This is a striking piece of jewelry and will be a dramatic accessory for the holidays.  I am very pleased with the quality and the colors and the price is very reasonable.  It arrived earlier than promised.  Would make a great stocking stuffer.
5.0,Good quality for cost.
5.0,It's super comfortable and light. I have very long hair and this works perfectly.
5.0,These shoes are so adorable.  They go with just about everything and are well made
5.0,Sorry for the poor quality photo but I had to write a review as soon as I tried this dress on! It’s SO elegant & looks like something you’d pay twice the price for in a store. It’s made of a very nice quality material & will be my go to when I need a classy black dress!
5.0,"My granddaughter's Loved these two-piece pajamas. They are soft, fit well, colorful, and wash up great in the machine. We'll be ordering more!"
5.0,Perfect 👏🏾
5.0,Very great! Love it!
5.0,"I was a bit skeptical because of the mixed reviews but I’m so happy I purchased these! You will see the lining of your panties if that bothers you but they’re not sheer/thin to the point where you can see the color of them. I love the material, extremely soft, thick thigh friendly. The most comfortable leggings I’ve ever tried to be honest. Perfect for working out!"
5.0,I use these to keep my glasses on my face around my 3 yr old or to take off while I'm reading and leave them around my neck. I had purchased a 3 pack of a different brand and all 3 fell apart within two months. These feel sturdier and thicker. I plan on ordering more. The design is beautiful and its nice to see a glasses strap thats girly.
5.0,The ring is just like the picture. Got it for my daughter ‘s mom for mother’s Day. She loves it
5.0,Cute outfit. Fits great.
5.0,Love this ring!!!!
5.0,I love a big fit pull over super cute logo
5.0,"Nice material, the fit in the bust was a bit big (I don’t have much of one though.) Nice length I’m 5’0”. Came right at my knee."
5.0,"Good and inexpensive. Frame broke after many months of use. So, bought another pair. Lost the new pair, however, which is why I like that the glasses are inexpensive. I will order again."
5.0,I love it by City Chic. Great for day or evening out with friends
5.0,.....these work perfectly....the shoe is not over tight but it's snug enough....enjoy!
5.0,Must-have for women!!!
5.0,Love this dress.  I got so many compliments when I wore it.
5.0,Great for my growing pregnant belly
5.0,I took a guess @ the actual length but when it arrived it fit perfect. I'm happy and so my trousers!'
5.0,"I received my paracord quickly after ordering.  The box and package were in good condition and easy to open.  The 550 cord was very sturdy and the plastic clips are actually rigid enough for durability but flexible enough to fasten and unfasten easily. My kids helped me find out the whistle is loud and high pitched.  If your lost in the woods, fell in a hole, or just unseen this will be able to gain others attention.  This could be a life saver.  The fire started sparks very well.  It did take multiple strikes before removing the protective coating.  I was getting a little nervous but after about 15-20 attempts good sparks were easy to obtain. The compass was simple, yet if lost and you just need a to know a direction (night time or cloudy day) this will satisfy that need.<br /> The material of 550 cord was comfortable on the wrist but when i wore it on my wrist it was a tight fit.  My wrist is about 10 1/2 &#34; in circumference, so after 10 minutes of wear I had to remove it.  The good  part was it is able to fit my backpack strap until needed.  This could also be placed around your belt for later keeping as well.  This could be a part of your Batman Utility belt or Bugout bag.<br />This bracelet ended up being a graduation present for my 10 year old on his cub scout graduation.  This would be a great gift for the whole pack as a Scout Master on special occasions.  This is not something I would use daily, but when needed your really need it.<br />I did receive a discount price for the review.  This turned out to be a big win for me."
5.0,"When I received the hat I was kinda disappointed. The patch was coming loose on left side. It was held on by adhesive.  The hat itself was not high quality, so I removed patch and glued it to a hat I had on hand. Problem solved and i was totally satisfied.  Today ,05/22, I received email from seller that I was getting my money refunded.  I didn't request a refund and am kinda surprised by the nice jester. I will try to find something else to order from them. Must be good people.<br />."
5.0,"Very good kid lab coat for the price. It was only used one time, my son had a wax museum at his school so I purchased this lab coat. He went as a chemist. Over all he fit the person he chose to go as... he received a lot of compliments on lab coat."
5.0,Gorgeous dress. Fit as expected. Nice flowy fabric that isn't too thin.
5.0,FABULOUS! I'm 5'2 so this skirt was a bit long for me but it still worked with a small heel. Waist is stretchy on the back. I usually wear 16 in women's and the XL fit perfectly.<br /><br />Also it has pockets!
5.0,"During the hot NC summer, the sweat & sunscreen runs down into my eyes when paddling racing boats (dragonboat, surfski, oc1, racing SUP). There's no good time to stop and wipe sweat when you're racing/paddling, so I got a sweatband. I first tried another brand, but it was really tight and squeezed my head. This JBM brand fits my adult head much better, and is more comfortable in general (the fabric is softer). I literally forgot I had it on. Great headband."
5.0,Very well made and nice looking. This was a gift so I do not know how it fit. Nice product.
5.0,Pattern does line up correctly on seems so can’t tell what it is. No one even laughed once.  Got my husband the cigar in mouth. Crowd pleaser for sure.
5.0,"Gift, she liked it."
5.0,Rather expensive but well worth it.  I’ve had several similar slim card holders/money clips.  This is the only one that actually works and works very well.  I would highly recommend.
5.0,Excellent suit. Holds up very well. Would order again.
5.0,Great for active wear!
5.0,Much better than other SHARK wallets in that it has a much more durable clasp. Have had many of their products and this is beat. Hard on cases and these are durable and hold max of 9 of my cards.Have not tested RFID but have had no indication over 4 years of any breach of my info. Would prefer greater capacity but this limits me from becoming a pack rat. Especially good for folks who have problems with a wallet in the rear pocket!!!!
5.0,Perfect for games.
5.0,"This is so cute! It feels nice on the skin. The only issue is that it is quite large in the chest area. I am a 38DD. Nothing a little clothing tape can't fix though. The first photo is with tape, the second is without. I ordered my normal size which is a large."
5.0,"I really like this top! It's a long sports bra with removable padding, so it can be worn as a shirt or as an undergarment if you want to be more modest. I ordered my usual size, a small, and it fits true to size. It's very comfortable and supportive for running and other workouts. And the cute straps are very fashionable and don't interfere with the practicality of the top, which is great. I really don't have any complaints. This top is essentially perfect! If you're looking for something to mix up your active-wear wardrobe, I think this sports bra really does the trick!"
5.0,"Quick shipping, looks amazing love it!"
5.0,"I work outside all day, this is perfect sun protection. Perfect shirt, cheaper than other options. I ordered 4 different shirts, this is by far my favorite. It is the most thin, which seems to feel the most cool. I typically wear a size small shirt and I ordered a medium -- it doesn't quite come all the way down my arms leaving a gap between my arms and my gloves that is still exposed to the sun. I'm so happy with it I'm going to order another pair, but this size a large."
5.0,Excellent product for the money. Well worth it.
5.0,"fits well, adjustable, sun proof, foldable....all good. it does blow off in the wind tho."
5.0,So cute and dainty!
5.0,This bag is perfect when I need to go out of town overnight...very nice quality!!!
5.0,Great hat - great fit...great for beach or pool time!!!
5.0,"These silicone toggles were great for adding to all the masks I’ve been making! They’re soft and pliable which will add to the wearers comfort of having to wear a mask for long periods.  Being soft made it that much easier for me to get the fabric or elastic thru as well! I received this product very quickly, actually two days earlier than stated! Will absolutely purchase these again!"
5.0,"Texture is great, sits nicely above the waist (How pants should be worn) and pretty damn durable."
5.0,"A bloody good sandal it is, with its premolded footbed and forgiving padding. It's a very comfortable sandal to wear daily as i do (i live in texas; the coldest it gets year-round is near 5°C in my area). It's very light and breathable and over time it begins to mold to your specific foot contour, which only makes even more comfortable. On top of all that, the little thingy that goes between your toes (sorry, dont know what it's called) isn't bothersome like on most male sandals, which is a major plus. the only downside would have to be that it gets a bit dirty quite easily as the topside material is some sort of fabric combination.. the dirt's also easy to clean off with water alone. other than that, for me, its the perfect sandal and i won't wear any other."
5.0,"Love it , kind of expensive I use it mostly very day. My hubby loves it too he said he wants one for fishing stuff but the price is kind of high."
5.0,Wore these to a 60's party and got many compliments.  I will make these part of my regular jewelry wardrobe
5.0,"Great necklace! Sturdy and heavy , got this for my 9 year old nephew for his birthday and he loves it ."
5.0,Fun and warm!
5.0,This is probably one of my favorite dresses I own! The material is weird but it doesn’t bother me. It’s not see through either! It fits perfectly and is super cute and flowy. I’ve worn it probably 10 times since it delivered! I love it!!
5.0,Great tunic. Always receive compliments when wearing.
5.0,really classy looking comfortable pants... should have purchased more in other colors...fast shipping...great value for the $$..very pleased with seller and item! certainly recommend!
5.0,Much smaller than it appears in the picture but great condition and value. My mother is an Elvis lover so I purchased this reusable bag as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.
5.0,It’s fabulous !
5.0,Perfecto para ninos con esta discapacidad
5.0,"I am amazed at the quality of this product.<br />I bought it thinking I couldn't miss, because it was less than $10.<br />I think this is the most comfortable belt I've ever had!"
5.0,They are warm and fit comfortably.
5.0,"Just as pictured, great material! Material is thick enough to keep you warm in the winter and thin enough to keep you cool in the summer"
5.0,Spacious and durable enough for a rough 9 year old.
5.0,"Love how comfortable these fit. Looks good with tee shirts, or button down top."
5.0,"The arms to the glasses are a bit weird, didn’t notice that when I purchased but they are still adorable and I still rock them on sunny days. They sit on my face nicely and work great!"
5.0,"S- size is fit to me. This one is just right for me, and material is breathable."
5.0,"Work well for what they are. Very simple. Have not had them all that long but they appear like they can last forever, depending on how and what conditions they are used under."
5.0,"These look very nice and the clip pierced backing is easy to operate.  I love huggie styles, but these also are easy to wear and sleep in."
5.0,"An adorable dress and very comfortable. Flattering at the waist without being too flowy. The neckline is so feminine and flattering. This dress is a winner. A little light weight, but perfect for summer. I love the floral print."
5.0,"I loved it!! It actually exceeded my expectations. What really helped me out to decide to buy it was the reviews of other people who bought it. I did not know what size to buy (I usually buy small) however in the reviews were people who were my tall and my weight (5'3&#34; and 120lbs) so I ended up buying medium for the reviews, and it was the best decision. The dress fit me right and I couldn't be more in love :)"
5.0,Wonderful variety!
5.0,"I have been wearing the watch for well over a year now.  Not a single issue whatsoever.  Gilding on edges is still good, band has lasted, and of course it keeps good time. Timex makes inexpensive but quality watches that last for years and years.  This one is no exception."
5.0,Good quality. Nice fit
5.0,"It was a tad bit tedious to put in, but my daith is fully healed so it was painless. Just pull it slightly apart to get it in, and be patient!"
5.0,"Quick to ship and exactly what I was looking for, Thank you"
5.0,I was hoping these were heavy and they ARE! I love them!
5.0,"Purchased the gold color.  Arrived quickly with a little black velvet bag to store it.  Very nice quality, shiny metal claws or spikes.  I took an eyeglass cleaning cloth to it because it reflects fingerprints, but I think that's cool"
5.0,"Nice color,  comfortable and good quality"
5.0,This was bought as a gift for my sister. She loves it
5.0,"Fun, stylish, and easy to throw in a bag. I have them scattered throughout the house... though of course they disappear anyway. Glasses do that. Anyway, lovely, came as described, cute as a button."
5.0,"Nice, thin no see socks. Good price."
5.0,This is my Favorite Apple Watch band love it 😊⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5.0,"I haven't worn these hiking yet, but they feel great so far.  I have very cold tile floors in my house and they kept my feet warm and cozy when I tried them on upon arrival"
5.0,"A good pair of eyeglasses can easily cost upwards of $200 in the market today with the frame commanding the major chunk of the price tag. I wear glasses and tend to keep more than one in order to blend-in with different occasions. Buying an economical frame gives me the flexibility and the budget to afford multiple pairs and yet wear one for the right event.<br /><br />That being said, I am impressed with the quality of this frame from Glassesshop. Even though the material is plastic, I found the frame to be quite sturdy and yet lightweight. It is easy on both my nose and ears. The overall fit is nice and I comfortably wear these all day. There are spring hinges on the arms that add to the comfort. The tortoise color of the frame looks really good and brings compliments all the way. These look and feel no different than the other (much more expensive) frames that I own. I now have the flexibility of easily swapping my lenses with another frame (with minor, inexpensive alteration) if I ever get bored of this one without having to worry about the cost incurred.<br /><br />P.S. - An important thing to note is the size of the frame vis-a-vis your face and fit in general. This frame is around 135 cm in width with the lens size being 53 mm. This fit my bill perfectly as per my face's shape and also the pupiliary distance. The frame size, in my opinion, caters to the vast majority of users. If prospective buyers have a doubt about the fit, I would recommend posting a question to the seller and to also take advantage of the 30 day money back guarantee in case the frame doesn't feel or fit right.<br /><br />I received this frame at a discounted price/complimentary in order to test and review. My opinion about the product is uninfluenced by the price and is solely based on my experience with it. If there are any questions or comments, please feel free to ask. If my review helped you make a decision, please vote Yes below my review. Thanks.<br /><br />-- SG"
5.0,It is very good quality - I'm guessing it will fit as expected as it looks about right.  It's a Christmas present so I won't know for sure until the 25th.  It is a very nice looking shirt.
5.0,Love these; they are so comfortable!
5.0,"My daughter likes these and says that they are comfortable. She’s very particular to fabric and doesn’t like “scratchy” fabric. So far, so good. We’ll see how they hold up after time."
5.0,Looks very good on my wife 😀
5.0,Perfect for the festival I needed it for. Shipped super fast too
5.0,I love the material of these shorts. You have support but you can move and breathe in them
5.0,I like how it fits.
5.0,"It is a light weight & a nice size, sparkler  when  the light hit it"
5.0,Fits as described. I usually wear a 16 and got a lg and it fit perfect. So comfortable for the summer.
5.0,Definitely helps with the sun n turn heads. Attention drawer. I love it feels sturdy I pray it last me a long whiles
5.0,This dress is so pretty.  I wore it to a dinner party and got lots of compliments.  It isn’t too tight fitting with just the right amount of stretch to feel comfortable.
5.0,"Love turbans for quick cover ups. Keeping my head warm and stashing a bad hair day out of sight. These was well, wear well and are great colors."
5.0,This is so beautiful! Some of the inside pieces move around. I thought it was going to be ok glues. For the price this is well worth the purchase!
5.0,Bought as a gift . My favorite batista loved them.
5.0,I absolutely LOVE these sunglasses! Super cute and functional too!! I definitely recommend!
5.0,"Fun toy, great quality!"
5.0,Great tights for an active girl. They’re opaque and perfect for the holidays.
5.0,Wear it constantly.
5.0,"Calif. now requires charge for plastic bags, .10 per. At all stores. I don't think so. Can fit 2 gal. Milk, or 3 large sodas in one bag, tho I mix heavy & light so bags are easy to haul. Milk leaked, tossed bag in washer, hung to dry. No problem. Can put over shoulder if not too full, or carry up to 6 at a time. Handles well stitched & not too long. Not too bulky to carry all 12 into every store I go to. every store. I have had many people with vinyl bags ask where I purchased. Plan to get more to have when these wear out."
5.0,Perfect bag to take to the gym.
5.0,Love the colors. Fits perfect!
5.0,I like this product it’s very tight and it’s also made from a thick material that senches you up. I would recommend it and definitely buy again.
5.0,Brilliant little gift...arrived quickly
5.0,Great Christmas stocking stuffer. (No pun intended)!
5.0,"The material is top quality. There are two bands, one small and one large, included. The fastener is easier for my 9 year old son to fasten than the original buckle wristband."
5.0,"I have a friend who has alpacas and llamas, and my friend and I bought her the bag in this print a few months back. I was looking for a birthday gift for her, and happened upon this - didn't know they also made wallets - and it's so cute! Seems very well made, and will make a perfect gift. This company obviously makes quality products, and I will likely buy from them again. (Bonus - the products are made from vegan/sustainable materials and processes.)"
5.0,"Just received product, seems to be very durable,  a great size for teenagers. Big enough to pack for sports travel. Love that it has extra pockets. Will get vinyl pressed and see how it goes. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Awesome hoodie! Love it !
5.0,"Perfect, and I would recommend"
5.0,My future daughter-in-law loved these earrings.  They are very pretty and appear to be made of good quality.  They will do very well for her wedding.
5.0,"Perfect right out of the package:  Fit, color, length, warmth.  Medium weight fleece.  Land's End is a good name.  Will order more before they are gone!"
5.0,I love it. Beautiful bracelet.
5.0,My husband loves these racks… very easy to use
5.0,I have worn this bra for many years and use to purchase at Boscov's but they stopped carrying this style of Bestform. Tried other bras and they were not the same. So happy to have found it on Amazon and the fit is perfect.  It is a very comfortable alternative to underwire and the right amount of padding to wear every day.<br />But now they are currently unavailable...of course I want to buy more! What happened?
5.0,"These are a great deal! Very heavily built, so they can be fitted well, with no gaps. The lenses are large, without flaw, and the ear loops absolutely prevent them from falling off, a big deal when engaged in active sports. I like the blue color - they're reflective, and give the world an interesting hue, to which I adapted easily.<br />I got two pairs, the other a more conventional brown color. Highly recommended."
5.0,These socks are great. I ordered large even though the chart sizing said I should order medium. I have larger calves. Socks go on easy with nice padding on bottom. They stay up all day & my feet stay dry & comfortable
5.0,The hats are great looking and made of good quality products. They where shipped promptly could not ask for better service.
5.0,"very soft, great fit and not too thick"
5.0,Wow! Awesome boot. I like red wing Irish setters and they seem to mix work boot with casual real well. They def aren’t a work boot but look awesome
5.0,My mom suffers from arthritis in her fingers and wrist. She loved to knit but stopped because it was to painful for her to do anymore. I ordered these gloves and wrist support band and she has started knitting again. She said they have really helped her. The gloves are affordable and worth buying.
5.0,My son loves this outfit! Great buy.
5.0,"They preformed great my feet were toasty all day long, I will buy them again and I will tell my friends about them.<br />Thank You<br />Patrick Potter"
5.0,Love  it !!!

5.0,My baby
5.0,Fits a little large. It’s super soft!
5.0,I love the earrings!!
5.0,Material was too thin didn’t really like it
5.0,"Outstanding quality! Thin, non itchy and soft merino wool lined with very soft 100% cotton"
5.0,"I can not tell you how comfortable this skirt is and did I mention it has ever girls dream??? Pockets, actual packets!!! Perfect for work or going out.  I ordered a xl at first because I’m a 12/14 but it was way to big but the L fits perfectly."
5.0,Well packaged. Big. Looks great. Inexpensive<br />Perfect for large group gifts
5.0,"My brilliantly conceived baseball themed display for my dining room table is now complete with the arrival of these two display cases with black risers.  As with the three others cases I recently purchased, these display cases arrived in perfect condition, they were expertly protected and packaged.  The four caps and one glove look great in these display cases, the dining room table sparkles when I turn on the lights which is good news for the local restaurants."
5.0,"I had a hard time figuring what to expect for fit when I bought these. I usually wear size XL gloves. These are a bit tight for me, but I can still get them on. &#34;One Size&#34; doesn't tell you anything about what size that &#34;one size&#34; actually is. I would call these Size Large. They have an open-palm design with velcro wrist straps. Can't expect much more for $15."
5.0,My son loves the grinch so these pajama pants are great!! They are soft and comfy. They fit and expected.
5.0,"This is my favorite style of short.  Easy on and off, forgiving of a few extra pounds and longer inseam.  Love the subtle striping.  I look for Avery Bermudas in every color."
5.0,Matches the Neemoda Sapphire Blue Crystal Earrings I purchased for my wife.<br />She loved both the Pendent & earrings!<br />I would recommend this to friends & family.<br />I would definitely purchase this item again!<br />Well worth the money!
5.0,I purchased a bunch of these as gifts for leaders in my parish.  They have been a big hit!  Great quality.  Really nice looking.  Affordable.
5.0,I love it! It nice and solid it’s the kind of watch I would love in Vietnam! Hooaah

5.0,My son loved his bowtie the quality is excellent
5.0,"Soft fabric, relaxed fit, washes very well. Would order again!"
5.0,The weight of this product is great. Good metal feel in the hands. Good size (roughly the size of quarters).
5.0,"Gr8 Transaction, Would buy again"
5.0,Ordered shorts before but they were too long. These shorts fit perfectly and the length is jut right.
5.0,I love this comfy shirt. The color is bright and lovely. I wear this with my jeans and Chucks. Cute. Cute. Cute!
5.0,Perfect and classy dress
5.0,"Replacement watch band feels better than the original band.....softer.  It was not hard to put on my watch, however it should include new spring pins."
5.0,"Very comfortable, and no elastic so hasn't caused a problem with my sensitive skin"
5.0,I love the color and it’s pretty in my nose. But it is super small. The way it looks in the website it looks like it’s bigger with more detail but it’s tiny and doesn’t really show much. You really can’t tell it’s a triangle.
5.0,"Nice cufflinks.  Seem well made and stylish.  They DO NOT come in any sort of gift box, just two mini zip lock bags.  If giving for a gift, you'll need to buy a gift box or gift bag to present them in."
5.0,"Beautiful, thank you"
5.0,"I've had a little difficulty pressing the volume, Bixby, and lock buttons. But here's my proof this is a great case to protect your cell. I unfortunately fell off my concrete steps down to the sidewalk. I figued if my phone was damaged, then I'd be forced to use my AT&T cell insurance. But AMAZINGLY ENOUGH, My cell was not damaged; There were no damage and the screen cover as part of this case didn't even have a scratch!! And this case fit my Samsung Galaxy 9+ perfectly!! Worth the $$ & purchase!!"
5.0,Used at my wedding. Came packaged and ready to go.
5.0,this is one of my favorite shirts !!! I ordered an XL i usually wear between a L to an XL and this XL was perfect for leggings and a pair of black boots. I also love the pockets.
5.0,Purchased this to wear at a wedding and everyone loved it! The slit is perfect enough where it doesn't come all the way up or over expose. A bit see through on the top area. I recommend wearing a bra or spaghetti tank top underneath.
5.0,Very cute! Makes a great gift.
5.0,"love this item, I ordered  them for all our mothers at our church for Mother's Day."
5.0,"Very pretty and unique,  I wear it every day"
5.0,"The plastic band of the boot was rather tight so I wouldn't recommend if you have thicker calves, I guess."
5.0,"OMG, I cannot wait to wear this shirt!! It's soo darn cute! The material is a little thicker than I would have liked especially for a summertime type shirt but it fits amazingingly well."
5.0,Great shoe for the price. My kid say it looks and feels great.
5.0,Awesome products😄
5.0,"Overall, the best belt I have ever owned! The design of this belt is absolutely fantastic. There is no excess belt that gets in your way when it's on. It locks tight, and does not loosen throughout the day. The buckle is super thin, and does not pinch in any areas at all. I will definitely be buying multiple belt and buckle colors soon."
5.0,Was great for my hubby.<br />Looks just like my 2 pups...lol
5.0,"These pants are so very cute in person. They’re much softer than I expected and very cozy, they are thin much like tee shirt material. My fiancée loves them and they were a big hit!"
5.0,"These socks hug my feet and keep my toes toasty. Soft fabric, particularly inside. Good grip on calf."
5.0,Love this coat!!!! It’s keeps me very warm
5.0,"Works as advertised. I can’t distinguish between the original and new ear socks. Be sure to lubricate your glasses and ear socks with thick liquid soap before installing.  Use of a towel will help grip the slippery ear sock when sliding it on.  Rinse well and they are as good as the original. In the photo, one is new and one is the original. The one in the front is new."
5.0,Currently I'm 4'11&#34; and 105lbs.  Fit slightly small but it looks great!
5.0,Love this little tool! I don't know how I managed without it all this time!
5.0,Very nicely made of good quality leather. I am very pleased with it and would buy again.
5.0,"I'm into watches and have a collection of about a dozen which range from Swiss automatics to digitals like this one. I have had amazing luck these Casios in terms of reliability and water resistance. I've worn these everywhere from the ocean to the shower and never had an issue. I wouldn't necessarily recommend that someone do that, but I've never had a leak. This watch has all the features you need with a cool retro look to match.<br /><br />I've owned a few rectangular G Shock watches as well. I prefer the understated looks of this F91W, however, the G Shocks in the $40 range have a few noticeable upgrades. For one, I have turned the alarm on my F91W a few times when I've fallen asleep wearing it. The issue is there are no guards around the buttons, so they are fairly easy to push accidentally. The other is the lights on G Shocks have been better in my experience.<br /><br />Overall this watch is extremely easy to recommend for a feature rich, simple, inexpensive digital watch."
5.0,"This dress is so much fun. I love florals, and this one delivers big impact. Mine has a more muted look than I was expecting, with a tan rather than a white background. I styled it with navy leggings and ballet flats and it was work appropriate. The fit is very generous but doesn't make me look like I got hit with a bolt of fabric. A win."
5.0,"Very pretty, its a must have."
5.0,"This was bought in lieu of a hat.  I loved it.  I didn't even know it was on.  I wore it with the clip not the headband.  But, a headband does come with it as well as a clip depending on how you want to wear it.  It looked great and it was light weight."
5.0,"I was a bit hesitant to order this watch, I mean what could I expect for less that $ 150.00 ? Boy was I wrong !!! I read the negative reviews and thought to myself “ heck if I don’t like it I can just return it !! I used it for a week and kept time very well , perhaps lost a couple seconds a day … so what ? No big deal ! I just love it and it is the best money I ever spent !"
5.0,"Boot fit like a glove. Size was exact. I wore Corcorans back in ‘68-71, and I got these for my grandson who’s active military combat engineer. He absolutely loves them and is the envy of guys in his platoon. If you’re looking for a rugged boot with great support, this is it"
5.0,"I live in Florida and we have a couple of pools in my neighborhood. We like to go swimming whenever we can but I only had one too small swim suit and one bikini before now. I like having a little bit of variety so I snagged this one when I got the chance. As a bigger woman who normally wears a size 14 in jeans and dresses, I was happy to find that the 10-12 size fit me.<br /><br />This swim suit is feminine, cute, modest and seems kind of “old school” with the cherry design. I love it! It is a one piece but it is made to look more like a tankini, which is perfect since I am actually a little embarrassed about wearing a one piece. It gives the illusion of a tankini by having two layers of material from the hips up, with light ruching (or ruffles) at the sides so it does not lay completely flat like a one piece when it gets wet. The “top” is loose from the rest of the swimsuit from one side to the other but not around the back. Underneath is a fine white mesh type material. The top is not only padded but also has underwire! The ties for the swim suit are sewn on on the inside, above the cups, instead of at the very top of the material like I am used to seeing.<br /><br />I had never seen a swim suit with underwire before this one. I really like that it has it since it means more support in areas that need it. I wear a D and it fit perfectly where it needed to. The padding and underwire do not come out to make the swim suit easier to wash so take care when washing. I lay mine out to air dry to prevent the wire from becoming fragile and the padding from going flat or being shredded since I have had a few bras do that over time. The stitching seems to be really good quality though. I have not found any loose threads yet.<br /><br />Overall the swim suit is really adorable and comfortable. The padding is great, the underwire does not poke, the colors are vivid and it fits me the way it should in all areas.<br /><br />I received this swim suit for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and opinion. I did my best to inspect the swim suit for quality and write a thorough review."
5.0,"Wrist size is about 7 1/2. I like the charms and would like it in bigger wrist size to 8.<br />You could add charms that is significant to you,<br />But I like my bracelet was a gift to me.<br />Thank you Melinda"
5.0,Love. Comfortable and convenient
5.0,nice product!
5.0,These photochromatic riding glasses are very nice. They exceeded my expectations by a great deal. They are a great value for the cost.
5.0,This is so cute! It can be dressed up or down and I love it so much!
5.0,Soft. No pilling after a couple washes. Not see through. Love the pockets!
5.0,Perfect dress
5.0,I have a Fitbit Flex 2.  This necklace is perfect for my flex 2.  Looks great and I have gotten a lot of compliments on the necklace.  People don't even realize it holds my fitbit.
5.0,Absolutely love this dress. fits comfortably and received so many compliments.
5.0,Bought for my husband when he rides his Harley and it's cold out. He really likes them very warm
5.0,My second pair of sunglasses that I bought from this seller. Both of them came well packed and in perfect condition! Very quick shipping.
5.0,It is soft and smells so good! it is my type of purse. I have searched and searched for it and found it! Thank you so much!
5.0,Very nice socks!
5.0,Beautiful piece - great price - on time as promised.  Will use this retailer again.
5.0,Absolutely love this watch. Very nice and heavy. Looks much better in person than online. It came with the time already set and has kept perfect time since. I have never heard of this brand before but I am now sold in it. Looks much more expensive than it is.
5.0,"We got this for a surprise pool vacation, my daughter picked it. Looks so cute, fits as expected. Good coverage/ cut on both top and bottoms.<br /><br />Adjustable straps for good fit. Love it, would buy again!"
5.0,Loved the dress but small was tight on top. Very nice for the price but had to return.
5.0,"Pretty, neatly packaged. Great deal!"
5.0,"Very nice badge, just what I expected it to be. Came sooner than stated, packaged well. Very happy."
5.0,Nice dress for the price. Helpful that it has pockets !!
5.0,Perfect fit to his face
5.0,"This is the cutest dress I've ever had for my seven year old.  The cut and fit is great.  The dress is floor length...my daughter is a bit short.  This dress is soft, washes well and looks so good."
5.0,"This is a great gift for an average or larger sized man. It has a lot of weight to it as well, so it feels substantially strong. It would fit best on someone over 6 foot tall because the chain is a little long for my taste, and I'm 5'9"" 185 lbs. I happened to have a chain that was an inch shorter and the exact same style and thickness, or guage, so I switched it over.<br /><br />This is definitely not ideal for a petite woman. The horn itself is quite large and heavy, so it wouldn't look good on your little Nanna. This is more suitable for a wife or girlfriend to buy for her Italian man, or would be an excellent gift from a daughter to her father."
5.0,"I bought it for the repair shop guys to wear, especially at night when the roadside emergency repair work, pull over and go to the car and put the triangle card more than 100 meters away from the car. Wearing a reflective vest will be several times safer. They are much safer to wear when they ride bicycles and battery cars on the road at night after get off work is late!"
5.0,fits perfect!
5.0,Awesome. So beautiful
5.0,I love the delightful color blue of the topaz stone. The sparkle of this earing is magnificent. These are  certain to evoke compliments wherever they are worn.
5.0,"I am obsessed with Lululemon and I always looking for dupes, these shorts might actually be my new favorite. They’re so comfy and super soft. Squat proof and no riding up or down. The colors are adorable. I will definitely be ordering more. I’m a (6) in Lululemon and the Medium fit me<br />Perfectly."
5.0,OMG THIS BAG IS SIMPLY AMAZING!!! I CANNOT WAIT TO WEAR IT...GOING CHECK FOR MULTIPLE COLORS!!!<br /><br />THE TASSELS WERE NOT ON THIS PURSE AND IT'S ONLY ONE ZIPPER BUT IT'S STILL CUTE
5.0,"What a wonderful place to order from! The bracelet was packaged in a charming, festive bag....and the seller included two other pieces of holiday jewelry as a thank you for my order! WOW, I never had that happen before! They even included a handwritten thank you for ordering from them! These folks definitely go above and beyond! I will happily order from them in the future!"
5.0,It was easy to change out
5.0,"These are great! The size is just what I wanted and I love the layout of the pockets inside-- and it's nice to have one outside as well! The colors are slightly different than they appear in the images online. I bought the light blue one for my mom and the purple one for me, and I'd say the blue is lighter and the purple is darker than expected, though they aren't that different. They seem pretty durable and I'm looking forward to using mine for our Europe trip!"
5.0,Fit is better and ease of putting on is better than others.
5.0,"Surprisingly, these are probably the best aviators I own. I generally buy a new $15-20 pair every year or so when my old ones wear out. However, I can never find any that fit well. Either the lenses are so close to my face that the eye wires touch my cheeks, the tops touch my forehead, or the temples actually squeeze my temples.<br /><br />These glasses sit completely off my face and are wide enough to actually clear my temples. They are extremely comfortable to wear and beat every other cheap pair I've owned by a long shot. The mirroring is pretty good and they are polarized as advertised.<br /><br />My only worry with these is that, since they are so cheap, the finish will wear off quickly, as it usually does with cheap glasses. They've held up well so far but I will update my review if they start to wear out."
5.0,"Loving this band. I have a similar stainless band but it is much heavier, and I don't wear it often due to the weight. This band is light weight and the clasp is comfortable. The links were easy to remove with the tool provided. Definitely would recommend, and would purchase again."
5.0,"My husband and I renewed our vows for our 10th anniversary which was on Valentine's Day.  I purchased many dresses for the occasion but returned them.  Was very happy with this dress!  I'm 5' 6"" and weigh 128.  Medium fit perfectly!"
5.0,Cute jumper..love it..my  birthday gift from my husband..
5.0,Hot for fall!
5.0,Haven’t wore them yet. Very nice
5.0,Fits really good and fast shipper!
5.0,I love this little jacket . It was perfect to cover my shoulders with my gown I wore at his wedding.
5.0,"I ordered up a size because I wanted it to fit like the model.  I should have just ordered my original size.  However,  it is such a fun, comfy shirt I wear it alot.  I just have to roll the sleeves because they are long.  Super cute and goes with a lot."
5.0,"Thay very easy to install, look very nice."
5.0,"Excedió mi expectativa,  tela fresca,  bien cocido, limpio.. se puede usar en verano, algofon de verdad. Gracias, entre mis favoritas a un gran precio.."
5.0,They're so cute .
5.0,Great deal. Great quality. One pair could be sold in stores for the whole price. Fast delivery too. Package arrived 3 days before scheduled delivery date.
5.0,"These shoes hold up well, fit correctly, and look stylish. We’ll definitely purchase from this company again."
5.0,Use this multiple times a week for hockey and tournaments. I wash it every night after I use it (And i played 2-3 times a week). Its held up great so far (5-6 months) and it shows no signs of breaking down any time soon. Keeps the clothes from getting extra smelly / moldy as gym bags and plastic bags do.
5.0,Bought for all my family to show support
5.0,I am very happy about the quality and the fit for me. The price is unbelievably low so I didn’t expect high quality but it’s a great buy with High quality!
5.0,I ended up giving it to a friend because it was a little too small for me. I wish I would have ordered a size XL
5.0,Se desprendió el mango tan pronto puse el celular u producto malo
5.0,Amazing love it
5.0,These are absolutely 💯 great gloves
5.0,Got this for my wedding. Looked amazing!
5.0,"Very satisfied with my Casio Pro Trek. Other than my Rolex, Casio is my everyday go to watch for reliability & toughness. Looks Great!!"
5.0,Perfect size the purse is not to large or not to small.  I have enough room for all of my belongings and very easy to carry with the three different choice's.  I would recommend this for someone who prefer a larger purse or a smaller.
5.0,"excellent product, as described by the seller"
5.0,Bought this for my husband.  He likes and enjoys wearing them.
5.0,Very comfortable. Very sticky and stays in place all day.
5.0,This flared high wasted skirt is soft and chic. The material is thick enough that you don't see through it but light enough that you don't sweat in it. The length is perfect for me and can easily be paired with leggings. I love the pockets for keeping small items in it. This pairs well with a white tee shirt or even heels.
5.0,arrived as described and on time.
5.0,the quality of the dress is PERFECT for the price!  I couldn't have asked for any better.  Simple very amazed!
5.0,"These earrings are WONDERFULLY AMAZING.  I don't go for the larger hoops and was hoping these would work.  While the are slightly larger than what I prefer and normally wear, they area GREAT QUALITY and perfect!!!!  Also not real heavy considering their size."
5.0,Comfy and great quality. I will buy again.
5.0,Daughters bickered about who would get it since it’s adorable. Daughter who it was bought for ended up giving it to her younger sister.
5.0,To see at night. They do what they are intended to do.
5.0,So light and flowing. It is also flattering and fit well. Covered everything it’s suposed to and very feminine.
5.0,Love the belt. This is a very old purchase. I didn't realize I hadn't left a review. When I can tell you from long term use the belt is sturdy both the Buckle and the leather. Your bail is over a year old and I use it pretty much every day. And it is still looking nearly brand-new.
5.0,Considering the low price I was suprised to receive such a quality product.  This is normally the kind of thing ou use once and discard.  These masks are worth holding on to for future use.
5.0,"I got these for an end of school year gift for my students-they loved them! The colors are bright, and they felt sturdy. Great buy! Will definitely buy again!"
5.0,I went with the comments online to get my fit. You can do the use mine to see what size you are.<br /><br />Size ordered: small<br />Weight:126<br />Height: 5 ft<br />Waist: 32<br />Hips: 37<br />Fits a bit snug..got a bit of a muffin top going on but not terrible.
5.0,"This was the first RazzyRoo headband we bought...we liked it so much we ended up buying three more (in different prints). My four year old daughter always had issues with other elastic headbands staying on her head, but this one finally stays put. I also really like that it's adjustable. We will defiantly be buying more in the future."
5.0,love it. thank so much.
5.0,I don't have tiny hands but I do have slender fingers. The large pair of gloves fits me as I would expect gloves like this to fit on me. They have held up to a few wearings since the fall of 2014.
5.0,"In ordered this jumpsuit in royal blue in Large. I’m 5’7 145lbs. It fits perfectly! I had so many compliments on it today. It goes well with heels because the legs are a little long. But it has nice flow. It’s so comfy, like wearing jammies! The material is a polyester type close to Jersey knit so cellulite will show in the brighter colors. But I really like it and might order it in more colors."
5.0,Perfect fit!!!!!
5.0,Easy to put in shoes
5.0,Everything I expected good fit
5.0,Very comfortable. I ordered another package for my daughter.
5.0,"Really love the quality of this shirt, but it runs SUPER small.  My daughter is 8 and is tall for her age, and since other people said it ran small I went with the medium and it fit great!"
5.0,I bought these for my son as he is on his feet all day for his job and his feet get very sweaty.  These socks keep his feet dry and he says they are more comfortable than regular socks.  He wears size 13-14 shoe and the fit is good for his extended shoe size.  Will buy these again.
5.0,Good quality and it isn't seethrow. I love it
5.0,"These shoe bags are awesome! They are plenty roomy for our size 10 and 11 shoes. I could but two pair of my woman’s size 10-11 in one bag. Tennis shoes and sandals.  We just returned from an 8 day road trip down the Oregan coast. I used one of the bags for our tilietries, shampoos etc. love the little handle on the bag.  They also worked great for being able to put one days worth of clothes into. Then you don’t have to lug all your stuff in and out of your car. Then you can just hang the bag in the closet. Anyway there are a multitude of things you can use these bags for."
5.0,"Warm and fits perfect, loved the pattern and fabric"
5.0,"Pros: Beautiful, petite pendant. It's slightly larger than a penny, but has a lot of style. The chain is great, too. It's sturdy.<br />Cons: The clasp on the chain is a springring, which is difficult to fasten without any help.<br /><br />Overall, I love the necklace. I'll wear it everyday."
5.0,"Ideal for wearing with a bathing suit, but also to wear to breakfast!"
5.0,They are adjustable and you can put them where they won't did into your ankle. Nicely made with a quality snap down holder.
5.0,Super cute! Good material! Loved it! 😍 I ordered a small and it fit great!
5.0,"I've ordered 2 of these hoodies so far and I absolutely love them. They're both really soft and comfortable. I want to order the camo one next. I love hoodies and could never have enough of them. I highly recommend these and will be ordering more. If you like your hoodies baggy,, order about 2 sizes up. I prefer my hoodies to be baggy and long, so I'll typically order 3 sizes bigger than my tshirt size. 😘"
5.0,"Fit perfectly. Length was too long, but I am 5'1'' so I expected as much. Easy to hem."
5.0,I purchased these to wear post-op from a Mommy Makeover. The buttons on the front makes it easy to take on and off. The material is very soft and thick enough to where it’s not see through. They also make it easier if you have any drainage tubes to maintain after surgery.
5.0,Love em!  Many compliments on them.
5.0,Nice workmanship! Quality at its best with a great price! $
5.0,I love this great assortment of holiday earrings.  I can alternate them during the Christmas season.  Good quality and nice size.  Fun to wear and they get a lot of positive attention!
5.0,Verrrrry nice!
5.0,A very nice assortment of shawl clips. Very nice. I'm very happy with them.
5.0,"I have tried many pantyhose and no matter how many times I follow the weight chart it always is toot tight on any brand.  I bought MissO for bedroom time fun, but now like crotchless only because I don't have to remove them to use the bathroom.  I have learned that with any brand of panyhose, to buy 2 sizes up (or more depending on brand) for a fitted yet comfortable no waist binding fit.  I am 5'10"" and have a 32.5"" waist and wear a M/size 8 pants and I use MissO XXL and it fits perfect.  I can usually use them all day 8am-10pm with kids and work about 5-8 times before replacement depending on what I do that day."
5.0,"I bought the M/L in this and am a size 36B.  It fit me perfect with a little extra room but not much.  I really do not expect it will accomodate someone bigger than a C comfortably.  I bought this to wear under a backless shirt.  Got it yesterday and wore it last night.  I will buy in more colors and I do suggest it for you.  I never plan on working out in this bra, since I don't think it is supportive as my normal sports bras."
5.0,Like on description
5.0,The most comfortable shoes! I love how they feel and the color is just a complete bonus.
5.0,Received this as a gift and I'm very pleased.  The cord is a little stiff at first but softens/molds to fit your neck after you've worn it a bit.  If you don't like the cord it could be easily switched out for a silver chain.
5.0,Wrist watches cause my wrist to hurt and leave a sun tan shadow on my wrist.  I can just hang the carabiner watch on my belt loop.  It's as convenient as a wrist watch without the disadvantages.
5.0,So fun for my granddaughter
5.0,I use this at work. I work in a hospital so I need something I can clean easily. This is great!
5.0,"very pretty, pleased with purchase"
5.0,"These masks are pretty thin. I wish they had a nose wire, but i was aware they didn't when i purchased them. I just wear a disposable mask underneath to keep my glasses from fogging too bad, but that's more of a me problem. The masks are super adorable."
5.0,"It is suitable to wear, the size is right, the fabric is also very comfortable, the style is new, the feel is good, and the breathability is good"
5.0,I purchased the skirt for the holidays and because it has an elastic waist I knew I would be comfortable.  The fabric is a stretchy velvet and elegant for a special occasion.  I also like that it was flared and boots would look just perfect with it too.
5.0,"Great pants for all activities. Great for the winter. Really warm and cozy. zippers keep all my belongings safe. The pants run a little long, but besides that great value for the price!"
5.0,"I love these slippers! They're too cute, they are larger than I expected but it's fine."
5.0,These are the best baby shoes ever! It is important to get the ones with the straps over the foot. The ones without are cuter patterns but the strap is what makes the shoes amazing- two babies and never have been able to get them off!
5.0,Good beanie. A little snug but that’s how it’s supposed to be. Very warm.
5.0,Flight crew. Love these socks. Major difference
5.0,"Love the material, if you usually wear a M pretty good order a large it is just a bit snug. Otherwise the color shown is right on and its easy to wear and fit with pants."
5.0,I love these I own 2 pairs my other pair is black. The size is perfect for me and they are very comfortable to wear....and they look great too. I would definitely recommend this to someone.
5.0,"Love this product!<br /><br />Can't quite explain why, but my legs felt immediately better after wearing calf compression sleeves.  Legs, particularly my lower legs, felt invigorated once I slipped the sleeves over my calfs.<br /><br />I am 6 / 1, 215 lbs male and purchased the large pair.<br /><br />I had to remove my socks to get them on and thought they would be too tight. However, I was happy to discover they were not restrictive.  I purchased the green sleeves and wore them with shorts.<br /><br />I wore them during a 12 hour road trip and had great results.<br /><br />Great purchase and price point."
5.0,"First of all, I never write reviews, BUT I just had to for this dress. It is absolutely beautiful, and the perfect length. The front comes down to my mid thigh, and the back hangs down to the back of my knees. I was worried it would be too short, based on some reviews i read, but it worked out perfectly! It has a beautiful silky fabric, and flows wonderfully! The dress is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for! I LOVE it!"
5.0,"Warm, Fits well."
5.0,Love the length<br />They are not heavy at all<br />Universal
5.0,"I thought 48mm would be a very large size. But it is not. The watch is very beautiful, with excellent finishes and a bracelet with micro-adjustments that facilitate a perfect fit on the wrist. Despite its size, the watch is not thick, which allows it to be worn perfectly with clothing.<br />Inside it has a Sellita SW200 movement that works very well, with at least 30 hours of power reserve. The luminance is OK, but it is not the best."
5.0,I like the weight and its material very solid.
5.0,Love these pants! fit great!
5.0,I love this top. Rolled it up and put in suitcase.  Perfect!
5.0,cute and functional
5.0,exellent
5.0,What a cool invention!  Great for shopping. You can actually fit a lot in the bag.  Will be buying more these.
5.0,Este tipo de sandalia se ajusta perfectamente.
5.0,"Love this sweater dress! It fits me perfectly… but, I’m not a fan of my legs so I wear it with some thick tights and fun boots, or toss on a pair of leggings or a slim pencil skirt underneath.<br /><br />The knit is thin, yet a tight weave so it will serve you well from fall through winter, until early spring! The pale blue is gorgeous and the sleeves offer a feminine style with their slightly billowing flair that tightens at the cuff.<br /><br />The sweater launders well and has a good amount of stretch. The front tie is super flattering and stylish!<br /><br />If you want a loose fit, go a size up. Otherwise, the size chart provided is very accurate and this dress hugs in all the right places!"
5.0,Wish the stone was on both sides but has a comfortable fit and easy to put it
5.0,"The product is a good fit for me. I bought M(my pant size is 4), the bottom is a little tight which is exactly what I wanted. The fabric is textured. The back is open, I assume that is for easy access should one needs to go bathroom. A good idea IMO."
5.0,Very cute and very substantial!! Not cheaply made at all! I get so many compliments when I wear them!
5.0,Gorgeous love them and wear everyday!
5.0,Love these!! Wear them kayaking and biking! Perfect for going around people and keeping the sun off our necks and faces!
5.0,Loved the quality 💖
5.0,"I absolutely love the finish on this watch. It presents really well. Casio did a great job in maintaining the originality of the F-91w, yet making the watch owner feel like they are wearing something new and different. It has the same backlight as the original. The watch fits well on my 7.25 inch wrist. I paid around $15 shipped am very happy with it."
5.0,"This was my second order, really like the product."
5.0,"These are too good to be true! Lightweight, stylish, plenty of options to accessorize a variety of outfits."
5.0,Very nice and well made!
5.0,Beautiful skirt! I love the material.
5.0,Good quality. Very pleased
5.0,Just as described by the seller. Fits as expected.
5.0,Perfect use it for just commute from work and go home just to bring lunch and other items home perfect roundabout use how to turn off for about a month it's working good
5.0,Fits great! My granddaughter really loves th
5.0,"Used Amazon wardrobe, and not sure if the size that would fit item look better in-person"
5.0,This hoodie definitely gets a lot of compliments while wearing!
5.0,"lovely, timely arrival"
5.0,Right size for my needs
5.0,I purchased several for stocking stuffers for friends! They all loved them!! The settings were nice and looked great for holiday evening wear!
5.0,I love these I can see to drive at night now
5.0,"Works well, nice to have a spare cord."
5.0,"Loved the shirt, although much lighter than I thought it was going to be, and decal was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be.<br />Overall its great though"
5.0,Was a gift for a 3 year old Buzz Lightyear fan and he loved it.  It fit him perfectly with a little room to grow.
5.0,"Loved it!! The bottom was a little small, but top was perfect!!!"
5.0,"I am 5'9"" and 185 lbs, I bought the XL and it fits great and it long enough for me....YAY!!!  I kept going through and reading descriptions until I came across this one and the length was 2 to 3 inches longer than others.  I received several compliments when I wore the dark gray one.  I also bout the dark green and a floral print."
5.0,"Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a special gift to give to their dog sitter.  My fur baby loves his sitter and we wanted to give her something special for Christmas. Well, this was a wonderful pick as she loved it and she was so moved by the engraved message on the key chain, she absolutely loved it."
5.0,They turned out nicer than I expected!
5.0,"It is figure-flattering and made of comfy material. The purple color one can be worn to work or casual parties. I also have gotten the flora one, which will be perfect for beach. They are wrinkle resistant and keep shape after machine wash."
5.0,It is a heavy item with well made fabric. Great value! Plus it is beautiful
5.0,My husband really like the hat.
5.0,This dress is beautiful on.  It fit perfectly and the material is something that will last.  Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,Fit great! Cute and comfy!
5.0,If you follow the size chart it will fit perfectly. Great comfy dress that still is cute!! Add a belt and it’s perfection. I should’ve gotten 2.
5.0,Perfect fit. Good feel. Excellent workmanship.
5.0,"I wore this headband and necklace for our Christmas Eve night time walk through the neighborhood. Not only did my family and neighbors love it but it also provided high visibility in the darkness. I have no idea how long it will last but I have low expectations for things like this (as any rational consumer should) and because of that, my expectations were exceeded!! I would buy it again in a heartbeat!"

5.0,I love it; thank you so much
5.0,Shoes are gud
5.0,"The first time I ordered, I received a dress that was different from the advertised photo.  I considered returning it, but I decided to keep it because I liked it and it fit well.  Because I really did want a dress like the advertised photo, I decided to try ordering it again - and if I got the same different dress twice, I would return it.  Happily, I DID get the right dress the second time!<br /><br />I now consider it a blessing that the first dress was a mistake - because I wouldn't have it otherwise.  It's actually more forgiving than the second of the pounds I need to lose.<br /><br />The wrinkles in both dresses came out easily with a steamer.  I really like that they both have pockets!"
5.0,It makes me feel good and keeps swelling down
5.0,White shorts were a great fit on my husband!
5.0,"Except for the fact that the dye runs (which I'm hoping is just a passing phase), I do love it. After finding a strapless bra the top came together. I bought the XS and it fit nice and form fitting. I was actually expecting it to be a straight line but I'm loving the sweetheart look the more I wear it. 5 stars. Allegra K did it again."
5.0,"All good. (^:  Used along with the other party favors for 7 year old girl. Again, all good, (^:  Aloha!"
5.0,"Absolutely love, love this shirt. I'm 5'9, 140lbs and the large fits perfectly. The material is so nice, very smooth feeling. I'll definitely be able to wear this with leggings in summer and winter. May buy other colors (wish they had a solid color)."
5.0,"A near-perfect replica of the jacket from the film. Size medium fits perfectly on me (5'7&quot;, 165, small-medium frame) Comfortable enough to sleep in and surprisingly warm. 10/10 would recommend."
5.0,I bought 3 of these for a friend who had shoulder surgery.  She thought they were GREAT!  They fit well and made life a little easier for her.
5.0,Great for the price you pay.. not to cheap looking either

5.0,"I like these. They're comfortable, glasses stay on and not expensive.  This is the second time buying them.  After awhile the piece where the glasses go on gets loose but it takes several months before that happens."

5.0,Perfect bag for my motorcycle. Many compartments and easaly adjustable. Good for short motorcycle trips.
5.0,"Great glide, but absorbs into skin to leave a soft, non-greasy feel.  No fragrance and non-irritating.  It's a bit hard to pump, but if I warm it a bit, it pumps more easily.  I bought a gallon and it is proving to be a great product and a great value."
5.0,Beatitful earrings solid quality!!!

5.0,"The album of the year in 2014. 21 Octayne features melodic vocals and hard driving guitar work that is complex but so damn enjoyable you can't put it away. I had the chance to speak to the drummer, Alex, and you can't find a more thoughtful musician. Songs that you roll down the car windows and sing em loud and proud. You wll LOVE IT!"

5.0,I love this purse. My iPad fits in easily and it’s not heavy. It is made well and I think it will handle the hard wear and tear I usually put on my purse. It has several pockets inside and the flap closes the purse very well.
5.0,.y great granddaughter loves it.
5.0,Haven't worn it out but nice quality and on my list to even wear during colder months with my coats to church
5.0,"I bought this for my mother, 89 years old, who is now in Long Term Care. Her watch after many decades stopped working and the numbers were very small. So I got this for her as a Christmas gift. I also got her a lanyard to put it on and she is very pleased with the watch!"
5.0,"I love and adore these socks. They are lightweight and being 100% cotton -no sweaty feet. They hit the perfect spot on my ankle, only slightly shows in sneakers. Defiantly will re-purchase!"

5.0,"These socks are dreamy. After putting them on, I forgot that I even had legs!!"
5.0,"I waited to write a review because I wanted to try them out and wash them before I did. Well I LOVE these bras. They are all so comfortable and provide decent support. There are easily removable cup inserts that washed just fine also. Love the material, breathable and comfortable. I have sensitive skin and this bra let’s my skin breathe a little. So glad it came with 3."
5.0,Great buy! Perfect for prom! Very well made! Fit great
5.0,"I just received this jersey.  Very happy with the bright orange hi viz color which is brighter than the picture's show.  I am 192 lbs @ 5'10 and I purchased an XL.  It fits good but it's a snug fit by design as opposed to the Pearl Izumi size XL Quest which I also bought, the PI is much looser for a given size.  It's comfortable but more snug but not enough I would return it for a larger size.  Overall a very nice jersey, full zipper front, European style zipper."
5.0,"This is one of my favorite purchases on Amazon in a while. I love how delicate this necklace is, but it still feels sturdy.  It glistens beautifully in light which is exactly what I was looking for in my purchase. I really hope they start making this in silver since that is the ""better metal"" for my skin tone, but I'm still 100% pleased with this purchase. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Love love love these shades!!!!!!!!! Perfect for my vacay next month in the Caribbean island! Makes me look so chic ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

5.0,Perfect size bag.
5.0,My 17 year old daughter loved them.
5.0,Nice colors. Easy to wash. Wrinkle resistant.
5.0,"Item is exactly as I expected. Was a bit of a leap of faith since the item doesn't have a good photo but it looks great. Even imprinted the ""brand"" on the inside of the leather. Very happy with this purchase... although I will say ORDER UP! I bought this in the smallest size because my waist isn't as big as the small said but it was smaller than I expected. Returned and bought the next size up and it fits"
5.0,"Nice, good color, well made"
5.0,"This is very well made, sturdy, easy to hang, and looks beautiful!"
5.0,Nice shirt my son loved this big Yamaha fan!
5.0,"We haven't used it yet,but it appears true to size and is as pictured!"
5.0,Wonderful feel with good support. Expected a tighter fit but otherwise awesome. Thank you very much
5.0,"I live in Arizona and these are so lightweight, thin and they are breathable too. The seams all look good, they are flat seems which I like. Although they are thin, they are not see-through when you wear white underclothing. I will be buying more soon."
5.0,Worth every $
5.0,Por las piedras
5.0,Came as advertised
5.0,The material is nice and it fits well.  Length is good too.  Would buy this brand again.
5.0,Great so I can read my watch while running.
5.0,"These slides are comfortable, lightweight, and cute."
5.0,I love this product.  The lenses work great with all the hours I spend on a computer and are comfortable and light weight.  Fast delivery too.
5.0,Nice weight! Awesome product!
5.0,sort of cheap / plastic looking but my boyfriend is an electrician so he can’t have a metal watch. he liked it.
5.0,Slightly larger but was able to do a twist and it fit great. I don’t mind that at all and love the colors so much I’m getting a different one.
5.0,"I bought these fleece P.J.s for my elderly parent who is always cold.  They are super soft, keep her warm, have an adorable pattern, i.e. Blue Dots/Bunnies.  I am very pleased with the purchase, but feel a little guilty for paying so little knowing it is likely part of unfair pay/work environments."
5.0,"I can't attest to the two umbrellas because I forgot one in the train (:(), but the other one's started to unravel on me after only a few wears. The stitching came apart so one of the wires sticks out. It might be fixed with some sewing but I'm not very crafty so haven't tried it. Other than that, I liked these and would give them another chance.<br /><br />Edit: After I left this review, The Friendly Swede offered to send me a replacement package of umbrellas free of charge to replace the faulty one. So far, I've had no problems with the new ones. Customer service was great."
5.0,Love this color and the sun protection is great
5.0,Absolutely love this necklace! Very cute! My daughter is going to love it! Wrapped so cute! Perfect size!
5.0,Espectacular!!!!!
5.0,Gorgeous! Can't wait to rock it in Vegas ❤️
5.0,Great gauges. Comfortable for sure. Skulls is a little inset on the main body. Skull does not show on back.
5.0,"I LOVE this brand. It’s the only one I will buy now. It’s just the right size to be flashy without being ostentatious, and the jewel stays securely in the metal. I prefer to wear bone studs for my nose rings. I do lose them on rare occasions, but the screw versions always end up sticking weirdly out of my nostril, and I like how easy the bone studs pop into my nose. I’ve had my nose pierced for 16 years, and this is the only brand I’ve ever purchased multiple times."
5.0,Bought this for my 87y/o father and he likes it because he doesn’t have to fumble around with a buckle. Easy to use and very nice looking!
5.0,We keep it in the car door receptacle and fits perfect. Logo is well done and does not peel off with use. Good quality for the price.
5.0,I am so happy with my earrings they were resent so fast they are so buetiful and I will recommend to all my friends Thank U so much an Thank You for the extra gift Love them
5.0,This pillowcase is super soft and very well made. Both I and my 3 yo love it! The T. rex design is very cute and he loves seeing his name and spelling it. Thank you!!
5.0,I love it!!!! I have to loss a little belly. I like my tops a little flowie
5.0,Very pretty necklace.  Looked nicer in person.
5.0,"Fits just as shown. If you want a more fitted look depending on chest size of course, you may want to do a size smaller. Very flattering."
5.0,This is incredibly awesome. It fits so perfectly and is so conformable. It is bra cum sports bra which I can even wear inside my other dresses as well. Material is soft breathable. World recommend.
5.0,The shoulders on this dress will likely need to be altered. I used a safety pin and just connected it at the neck and it looked great. A ton of compliments!
5.0,Very comfortable and funny you will enjoy them🙂
5.0,Exactly what he expected.
5.0,"These are pretty cute earrings, nice and sparkly.<br /><br />For those with sensitive ears: the posts are probably real sterling silver, not just coated with it or mislabeled--my ears are really sensitive to metals and I found I can usually only wear real silver or gold. I accidentally left these in overnight and my ears didn't react to them at all! (May be tmi but if I leave surgical steel or earrings with cheap ""coated"" posts, my ears swell up, get bright red, and itchy and gross for a week.)"
5.0,"Attractive belt, fits my 30&#34; waist comfortably, goes with everything. The braided deal makes it easy to dress up or down. Nice brass-colored buckle."
5.0,Just opened the package and tried these on.They are soft and smooth with a relaxed fit. I love that look plus with the cuff around ankle they don't ride up in bed. love them and great price!!!
5.0,Looks just like the picture hair stays nice
5.0,"This watch is adorable! My granddaughter loved it, she turned 6. It fit perfectly. I had made a mistake on my order and the company was so prompt and easy to work with to correct my mistake. Two thumbs up!"
5.0,"I love these fleece lined thermal slipper socks!  The first thing I do with these types of socks is to turn them wrong side out and make sure the fleece lining is smooth and straight as I hate it getting bunched up on my toes.  These socks were easy to smooth out and my feet felt like they were in heaven when I put them on.  It makes me anxious for cooler weather to get here so I can wear these socks.  I get very cold feet in winter and love soft, warm and non-binding thermal socks.  These have those little rubbery disks on the bottom for a better grip when walking.  There is nothing negative I can find to say about these socks.  They look exactly as pictured on the product page."
5.0,These gloves are great for the price 1/2 the price of other and preform better
5.0,Used these as part of my Halloween costume. I was the hit of the party!
5.0,Fit is good and they are comfortable. Just a little heavier than I’ve used in the past but still like them.
5.0,gave this as a gift for a biker starter kit. the bud really liked it. can not believe how cheap compared to the bike rally's.
5.0,good quality goods. I like this.
5.0,My husband loved it! I'm slowly working on getting all the gears needed for his cosplay costume as well as mine :) will order mine soon
5.0,Ordered in Gold. Very cute. Fits correctly and the material looks like a million. Excellent choice at a good price.
5.0,"I like them, very soft!"
5.0,I bought these to wear with my steampunk Halloween costume. They are super cute! I think I probably will wear them other than with the costume! They seem to be decent quality for the price.
5.0,"It’s perfect. Good fabric, comfy, length is like the picture. Definitely I’m gonna get more in different  colors"
5.0,"I had been looking for a long time to find the right poncho. I wanted something artsy and different but not too hippie. What makes this poncho really nice is the detail of design where you get a bit of fringe but also some nice ruffles. It's feminine and looks classy. For the price it is a real deal. It's soft and fluffy! As others have mentioned the color White is actually a cream color. For me that was a bonus, I wanted cream rather than pure white. Unless you have super white teeth you don't want to wear pure white because it will make your teeth look even yellower in contrast. I'm planning on getting one in black for the winter."
5.0,These are amazing keychain holders and cell phone holder's.<br />Very impressed
5.0,Loved the sunglasses and especially loved the case they came in!! Came very fast too.
5.0,I love the way this product looks. And how much it suits my style.
5.0,"I love them! You can’t really see out of them but they’re super cute for costumes/festivals/photos. Consider getting a case to keep these in because they seem pretty fragile, they’re made of thin plastic."
5.0,Very small but very pretty. I like the backing on these earrings cause they come on and off easily. I would buy again!
5.0,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He likes it a lot, but he has stuffed it so full it doesn't really &#34;close&#34;. I told him that he could get a separate little card wallet and just keep his dollars in the posh one, but he won't listen...any ideas?"
5.0,"These are fantastic. Really well made considering the price, heel height is just enough for a little lift without making it difficult to walk. I've been wearing them almost daily. Please restock 7s in the other colors!"
5.0,These are thin-medium thickness ankle socks. They are breathable and do soak up sweat like the description says. These are good to run in and after laundering them they retain the same characteristics. They do not slip off of my feet also so the elastic is good. I will continue to wear these for a long time.
5.0,"Great fit and craftsmanship! Not 100% screen accurate, but gets the job done for me."
5.0,Really pretty necklace. I also bought the earrings and ring and I am quite happy with them all.  This necklace is just as pictured. The clasp is easy to use.  Very pretty.  Packaged well and came in perfect condition on the date quoted.
5.0,Live it
5.0,"This is just stunning!  More Edwardian than Goth, and just a beautiful piece.  Well put together, accent details are done very well too!<br /><br />It is a choker, so be mindful of that!<br /><br />Great company, offer of wide variety of pieces, and fast shipping too!"
5.0,Fit great and comfortable
5.0,"Have been looking for watch in this style for quite some time.  I bought one similar to it 15 years ago and it finally gave out.  Looks expensive, but is not.  I hope this one lasts as long!"
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful,  from dressie to casual makes any outfit look good.  The chain is also very nice I love having the little extra size so you can wear it at different lengths.  Would highly recommend....."
5.0,"My feet and legs are so much happier with these on. My work requires me to walk and stand a lot for 8 to 9 hrs a day. The difference is night and day, I feel my legs are less tired by end of the day. If your job requires you to stand and walk the whole day, this compression socks are for you."
5.0,Product looks just as pictured. I expected it to be slightly larger (the flowers are about the size of an American half-dollar) but I have only worn it once and received so many compliments on it! Many people assume it to be a Kate Spade piece!
5.0,"took advice from one of reviews.  I am a size 8-10 US, ordered an XXL as to be able to wear a light sweater under.  Fun coat!!!!"
5.0,"longer than I expected, but still pretty."
5.0,Good product better then I expected shipped on time and good price
5.0,"A lot thicker/more durable than expected.  From the look (and theme) of these socks I didn’t expect much but a good laugh.  They’re fairly thick, seem pretty durable.  My husband was happy with these (present) and said he’d buy this brand again based on the quality of the product."
5.0,Very nice fabric
5.0,"This set fit me perfectly and has lasted a long time! I usually get bored with one set and order a new one, but I'm sticking with this sparkly set for a long time! I receive lots of compliments on it."
5.0,This is beyond beautiful!!<br />It IS Uber dramatic and substantial..not flimsy.<br />I am astounded at the quality and value of this remarkable piece.
5.0,"I gave away my Citizen Eco-Drive because it was so heavy, so I was looking for something similar in a solar powered sports watch with 100m water resistance. The Casio is perfect, and it was under $100 (about a third the price of the Eco-Drive). The dial is easy to read, and the day and date are even better: black lettering against a white background so easy to read even for my 55-year-old eyes. The black face has a subtle etching pattern that makes it shimmer. The watch is medium sized, so good for large or small wrists, and it's not near as heavy as the Eco-Drive, but still very well made. Casio for the win!"
5.0,i like the neckstrap was longer
5.0,High quality=tough. Fits me great.
5.0,Great as a classy look for anything you would wear navy with.  Goes well with everything from jeans to dresses.  Love the style…snd the fit
5.0,"Great product, nice stitch work and true to size."
5.0,So lovely!
5.0,Very cute n strong bracelete:)
5.0,This lovely necklace looks great and it is not heavy around my neck.
5.0,Great product.  Was as promised and arrived quickly.
5.0,"I was on the fence about getting this dress but I am happy I did! The material has a somewhat crepey-looking texture to it, so I am not sure that I would like it in lighter colors, but the dark navy blue works great and doesn't look cheap.I was worried that it would be too tight and unforgiving on a bloated tummy, but it actually works out nicely. It is tighter in the booty region, but not in an unflattering way, I can still wear it to work. The belt is a great touch and the material is not too heavy. The best part in my opinion is that I was able to wear a pair of spanx and you could not tell that I had them on! I thought the material wouldn't hide it, but there was no line where the spanx ended at mid-thigh or at my tummy! I am 5'5&#34;, 135-140 LBS, 4/6 dress size, 32 DD, and I ordered a MEDIUM. All in all, I love the dress and I have received a bunch of compliments when wearing it :)"
5.0,These really work and I love the fabric!<br />Amazing

5.0,"Love these boots...the sole is lugged and anti slip, they are very cute with leggings and jeans!"
5.0,"I recently bought a lot of new hats supposedly one size fits all.  Needless to say they were all to big.  The Ultrafino Hat Size Reducer fixed almost all of them.  A couple needed an additional insert.  However, if your hats are a little big and slips down your head or over your eyes, this reducer sizing foam is easy to use and make your hat fit fine.  Also once you put your newly sized hat you can't even tell the foam is there"
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish. Not stiff. Many usable pockets. Size M
5.0,"My 13 year old daughter is exploring the idea of dressing up for the Renaissance festival this year, and this is the perfect base dress for such an occasion. the small fit her perfectly. She's 5'5"" and about 102lbs."

5.0,A surprisingly great shirt. I’ve worn it a lot - for the price it is a great buy.
5.0,I ordered a large size and it was too big eventhough I am a big woman

5.0,Cute summer dress for my toddler. It was a little to big but not a big issue

5.0,Excellent. Product in good conditions
5.0,"Knowing that it's one size fits all, I knew it would be a little snug on me but that's what I wanted. Awesome shirt, received many compliments."
5.0,Right size very nice
5.0,I bought this scarf for my friend for Christmas because she wanted something traditional and authentic from her country.. when I received and I checked looked better than in the pictures..It’s really good quality material and it worth the price.. I highly recommend it.
5.0,I sleep in it all the time.  Very comfortable.
5.0,Got as a gift. It was nice to see they have products for shotokan as it is not as common.
5.0,"Very clear, nice uniform size. Works great for my crafting projects"
5.0,I have had the gloves for about 3 weeks.  Great price for leather gloves.  Good fit.  Exactly as pictured.  Nice stitching.  I am pleased with the quality.
5.0,Great leggings!!! Squat proof !!!
5.0,"Yes.<br />Yes, you will look amazing.<br />Yes, you will feel fantastic.<br />Yes, this dress defines a new kind of casual sexuality.<br />Yes, you will own every room you enter.<br />Yes, other women will hate how good you look.<br />Yes, you will command the attention of all of the men, they won't be able to stop looking at you.<br />Yes, this dress will make you look wonderful, you don’t need the model’s shape, yours is even better.<br />Yes, there is some kind of black magic involved that makes my extra lumps and bumps disappear.<br />Yes, you will love this dress the second you look in the mirror.<br />Yes, you will begin looking for opportunities to wear this dress.<br />Yes, you need to buy this dress."

5.0,Cute! I love it.
5.0,Love these for my iwatch. Super comfy and love that I can adjust the fit
5.0,Beautiful but clasp is hard to do on your own. Needs two hands to clasp clasp.
5.0,This stainless steel bracelet is actually a very very good one. I bought it for one of my watches and it fits perfectly. It is a bit difficult to put at first but once you get the hang of it it works great. The links of the bracelet also are quite easy to remove and reattach. I would definitely recommend this for anyone's 20mm watch!
5.0,I love these socks!  They are comfortable and cool.  They are the thickness of regular socks not thin like dress socks (but I wear them with dress shoes all the time).
5.0,cute socks
5.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old niece for Christmas. It is super cute in person and is nice and thick. Not only will she love to play dress up with it, but it will keep her nice and toasty outside!"
5.0,It is very fun and makes people smile once they figure it out
5.0,These are very nice rings.  My husbands wedding ring was a mess and too tight so we decided to replace it inexpensively as his job is very tough on rings.  I wanted to have something similar so we got this set.  I have had so many compliments on this ring that it is embarrassing for what I paid!
5.0,Great buy!! I have had it for months and it still look great!

5.0,"It's a little tighter than I thought would be, but over all I love this hat.  I got it for when I'm out shoveling it's very warm...so much so that wear it anytime it's cold and I'm outside, great for walking dog, I don't mind staying out a bit longer. Thumbs up for this one!"
5.0,Good quality piece of jewelry. Fits perfectly with other wristlets. Doesn’t fade

5.0,I love this lightweight sweater. It's very versatile and comfortable.
5.0,"For the price, this jacket simply cannot be beat. It's waterproof, it's black, and it fits as expected."
5.0,Kept the water out very well.but the touch finger goes away very soon.
5.0,Love the feel and fit
5.0,"I really like this amazing multi purpose clutch! The color is perfect and it has just the right amount of space for your keys, glasses, credit cards, money, cell phone etc.  I really needed this instead of a purse to take to work and put in my desk.  It fits perfectly.  My purse was just to bulky to keep in my desk.  It really has great style and is perfect for carrying around.  It has easy access to every compartment and all my stuff fits perfectly.  I am so glad I have this! I received a sample of this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed."
5.0,"like them, but the first time I wore the red flower, the one showing, I lost a petal in the flower, can you replace the petal?  I do wear red a lot.  Thanks."
5.0,Definitely want in more colors
5.0,Very well made!  Well worth the price.
5.0,"I've had this only a couple of weeks, but I love it already. Buying another one today. Very soft. I've washed it several times. Hot water; hot dryer, it's fine. It fits just right. It's a bit of a magnet for dog and cat hair, but once you've gone down the road of pets, you don't care anyway. Maybe I'm projecting. Stop writing now okay"
5.0,I love these because they look very classy but are quite inexpensive so losing one is not a big problem.
5.0,"The quality of the fabric is amazing! Leaps and bounds better than I'd ever anticipated.<br />The vision is also higher quality than I had expected! Visions from other cosplay creators can be cheap and easy to break and the one provided has weight to it, and looks stunning!<br />The accessories are well done too. My only complaint is the glue job on a few pieces, but this should be very easy to fix as many of these pieces either overlap and will be hidden. Otherwise, I can clean them up with ease!<br />My cosplay arrived weeks early from the intended date of arrival (could've arrived as early as Jan 17th or as late as Feb 7th). It arrived the 3rd! Imagine my happy surprise!<br />The seller also was quick to communicate with me on anything they needed from me.  I'm plus size, and was worried about piece not fitting, but everything fits wonderfully! If I can add pictures later, I definitely will! Thank you!<br />Edit: added a single picture. The only issue was I needed something g to secure that shoulder strap, but that's as easy as a safety pin next time!"
5.0,Very nice and easy to wear
5.0,FANTASTIC boots! Incredibly comfortable and just rugged looking enough!
5.0,"I'm a size 14 and my husband a XXL, so I was pretty hesitant when I ordered this. It worked great! We got a ton of compliments on the cleverness. This migbt be a costume we actually re-wear!<br /><br />- The soap part did come folded with big creases, but they ironed out nicely with a little extra steam.<br />- The loofah has plastic straps over the shoulders. Being a rather ""blessed"" girl, I would never have trusted those straps if I didn't have a tee under it."
5.0,Se be bien y quedo a la medida
5.0,"While these sunglasses are a bit oversize, they fit easily over my regular glasses and block the sun's glare very well.  I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,Just what I want
5.0,Very nice mask love the look
5.0,Great looking modern stylish watch!!
5.0,Love the quality of this dress!
5.0,My fourth Walker & Williams guitar strap and like the others I'm extremely pleased.  Quality and workmanship are top notch.  I'm using this on an Epi ES339.
5.0,"I love this dress. It’s light-weight, silky, and very comfortable. I’ve already bought several more in different colors."
5.0,"Love the shoes! they fit perfect and are comfortable, and the price!?! Can't beat it. I highly recommend these."
5.0,Order one size up from your usual size.  I receive many compliments on this sweater. I really like it.
5.0,Awesome belt  !  Very high-quality
5.0,Here’s the dress on me. I love the fit. Nice and slicky. It’s a perfect brunch outfit. Hope this helps. I ordered a small.
5.0,Shipped 10 days before the &#34;estimated ship date&#34; which was awesome and it's really REALLY good quality for the price I was pleasantly suprised!! :)
5.0,"Comforable, adjustable & the coolest for me ☺"
5.0,Very impressed with the quality of the metal folding frames.  The case is hard not to get squished in my slacks pocket.  My wife and I keep one pair each  in our bedside tables and I keep one in my car to carry with me at meetings. have used them a lot to read in the evenings and found them to be comfortable and effective.
5.0,"Love this shirt, super soft, very breathable, and awesome fit. I got the XL and am always worried if they will be too long as I am 5’9 but it is perfect length to wear untucked.  Very similar to my untuck branded shirts but at a more affordable price."
5.0,These are very lightweight and fit very well. So far a great buy for the price. We'll see how well they hold up long term.
5.0,"For what I paid, these were a steal. I got the tortoise frames with the brown polycarbonate lens, and they looked good. I have a large head (7 1/2 hat sz), and these fit snug yet comfortable. The action on the hinge seems solid meaning the sunglass arms don't just swing out with near no resistance like some glasses, but with a good flick they will. So, not too tight like with other glasses (i.e. just right). Definitely not flimsy<br /><br />I'm planning on getting another pair. Isn't that the true test?"
5.0,I ordered an extra large which is ask my shirt size. It fits really good. I love it should have got it in another color also.
5.0,Awesome coloring and just the right size I was looking for.
5.0,These socks are the best ever. They are just perfect for the low cut boots so that you see these cute socks instead of regular socks.
5.0,"Love the spandex support fit. Comfortable fit, washes well ."
5.0,Love the color and the versatility of the strap.
5.0,"Runs slightly big, but I love the loose and flowy look so it works for me. It looks super cute with skinny jeans and boots, and equally as cute with denim cutoffs. nice and flattering."
5.0,This fit great! Very breathable and a fraction of the price of an authentic outfit. Everyone loved it!
5.0,"Very roomy for a small bag. Well made, sturdy and perfect for my needs. I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"This shoelace was actually for a damaged drawstring for some shorts which fit and worked perfectly! Good quality, a little pricey but hopefully it'll last for a while."
5.0,"I've had this for several months and still good as new.  I love it. simple, utilitarian, excellent.  Havent overloaded the coin purse so cant speak for that."
5.0,Very nice.  I bought more....
5.0,This was bought as a gift for a friend who's husband had passed away. Fit him perfectly the engraving was beautiful. I wanted to give him a way to feel his husband was always with him. He has not taken it off since the day he got it. Plus I surprised him with it. He absolutely loved it. Great ring to give as a gift for any event
5.0,I didn’t expect this dress to be so amazing in person. The stitching is all good and the color is true to photos. It’s a little stretchy so should be forgiving in the sizing.
5.0,All I can say is wow
5.0,fantastic dress!  ive never been disappointed by anything from this wonderful company!
5.0,"Loved these pretty dangling earrings , love the clasps instead of hooks"
5.0,Super soft and Long and really Really Nice. It's better quality then I expected I used it to extend my Anna cape and it was beautiful I just pinned it so I could keep the beauty of the cape but it's really beautiful
5.0,Very warm and comfy<br /><br />They were very tight right from the box but they stretched and fit great now
5.0,Great Case
5.0,They aren't very heavy like other earrings out there and they are really a good size.
5.0,Love the material! Very sturdy! Great fit!
5.0,"I was supplied a free sample or a sample at a reduced cost for testing and evaluation, and I promise that my review will be both fair and honest.<br /><br />I have just retired from my Computer Repair Business.<br />I am Microsoft Certified IT Professional, Certified Microsoft Technology Specialist, Microsoft Certified Professional, Network Specialist, Apple & Android Developer.<br /><br />I Have Over 25 Years Experience<br /><br />I was excited when I was asked to review this keychain.<br />I play Guitar along with other instruments, and I knew exactly what to do with this keychain.<br />I gave this keychain to my wife of 20 years as she means everything to me.<br />She has never left my side while I have been fighting MS and other health problems.<br />The quality of the keychain is excellent, it has a nice shiny finish with no imperfections at all.<br />It is easy to put your keys on or whatever you want to attach it to.<br />You could attach it to a zipper handle to make it easier to pull zipper up and down.<br />You could remove it from the keychain holder and make it into a necklace pendant.<br />My wife loved it when I gave it to her she gave me a big hug and kiss."
5.0,"My previous ""Sun goodess of the 70s and 80s"" friend love these.  She had a cancer removed and wanted to keep the rest of her hair. But I talked her into a buzz cut. She loved it and her fellow assisted living friends love the look. Thanks so much for lifting her spirits.<br />BTW! The removal is working. Hopefully it doesn't come back."
5.0,Holds everything I need safely. Great for traveling
5.0,"Great quality, cute and fits perfectly... I always lose my keys, so know I can wear them or find them quickly in my purse"
5.0,Amazing backpack!<br />Great quality and an unbelievable price!
5.0,I have been wearing these now for a month.  They are very comfortable and come up about 2 inches below my knee.  My legs and feet feel good.  I did have some previous swelling of my ankles and no longer have swelling.  I would recommend these to anyone who has issues with their feet or legs..
5.0,Love this cozy hat! Feels so soft and comfy!
5.0,They look great and were received as advertised.
5.0,This dress is amazing! Very classy and looks good for work or after work. Fits great as a plus size woman (usually 22-24).
5.0,Kids loved these in their Easter eggs. All worked. 🌞
5.0,Very comfortable and slims you up.
5.0,"Good quality, comfortable because it is light weight, thin, and breathable. Very happy I don't need to use curved spring bar to fit the strap. Come with plastic box that said make in China."
5.0,So happy to be able to see! !
5.0,"I accidentally left it in my pocket when I did the laundry yesterday. So far, it's still keeping time, though the glass is cracked due to the dryer. The water seal is not actually that great; it gets cloudy if you get it wet, but then it dries out again and continue to work.  I've had this watch for six months. I am not kind to my things, obviously, so the band is getting ready to give out, but the works are still working after a full wash cycle and maybe 5 minutes in the dryer."
5.0,Kids loved them and they made it through the winter intact if you knew my kids that's saying alot
5.0,Really like this dress.
5.0,My son loves his hoodie
5.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. She's convinced it's real gold and diamonds! As an adult I can say while it's clearly not, it still looks very nice and is sturdy and well made."
5.0,I really like these. They are comfortable and I like the way they look.
5.0,"My husband loved these! Fit well, dried fast and are lightweight.. they look great on as well"
5.0,I have bought this scarf in mint green and in  purple in the past and have received several compliments when I wear them. Today I bought the blue and the pink versions of the same pattern. I wish they would re-stock the purple. So many of my friends asked me where I bought mine. I attempted to get some for them as gifts but they were sold out. I hope the seller will order more in the purple color.A++++++
5.0,"Quality item, well made, comfortable."
5.0,"Cute, soft and just the right length for those of us women with a bit more in the behind."
5.0,"I really liked how nice it holds a lot of hair for a 12 hr shift, and doesn’t slip off. Keeping my hair off my neck is a must and it does just that with the tightening strings. Really love it !"
5.0,Love these shorts!  Perfect.  I want more!
5.0,Love this earrings they are so cute
5.0,Very nice good quality.
5.0,looked good but sent back.
5.0,"I bought this for a friend as a graduation gift, and I was pleased when I received it. It is very small, but that is what I expected. The detail was nice, it wasn't scuffed at all, and it was overall very cute. The chain is very thin, so it may break easily, but the pendant can easily be switched to another chain if desired. This necklace is cute without being childish and it is well-made-- I love it!"
5.0,Cute detailing
5.0,I love the material. Very comfortable. I bought a medium fits a little snug. But I wore to a trampoline place and it keep the ladies comfortable. I think I will buy some more it different colors
5.0,"This is an amazing dress - I love it so much, but you have to size up because it runs super small.  I'm 5'8"" and 170lbs, normally would wear a large in most things, got an XXL in this and it fits perfectly.... will buy another!  Great material, super cute - and POCKETS!!!!"
5.0,"I wear a 9 1/2 or 10 women's size shoe and these are just slightly small on me, but I still wear them because they're warm & comfortable. I really like that the top stays up on my leg and doesn't fall down."
5.0,Great great price for these. They are the perfect shading. Able to see in morning noon or early evening. They look great. No complaints.
5.0,"My daughter loves these cute, bright and fun pants. Ordered a large and the fit is perfect."
5.0,Original outfit
5.0,Well i orderes this dress for Easter 2020 but due to the COVID-19 pandemic  i haven't worn yet but i absolutely love this dress
5.0,"I am so pleased with everything about this order. Order arrived in a timely manner, color was correct and as expected, product is of great quality. I am very pleased with this item"
5.0,"Quality as expected, delivery on time"
5.0,"Love it, got it to go with my Michael Kors Cynthia satchel"
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the glasses. They are light, soft to touch and fits perfectly. I wore it during the run and they are true to their words - they stay on, no bouncing. The only concern I have is the glare I see through the lenses but not enough to take a point off. Of all the sunglasses I owned in my life, this is one of the best (and great value!!). One caviar... I have not worn them during water sports. Given some of the reviews, I am a bit afraid to try them on.<br /><br />Follow up to my earlier review. The glasses do just fine when they get wet. I wore them at the pool and there were no issues even after they got soaked with chlorine water. Just bought another pair with different color."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Works great  Price was right.
5.0,"This skirt is great. Boy shorts underneath are breathable. Orded the white in size L. Fit perfect. I am 5'3"", 157 lbs. Very flattering. Using it as a swim bottom."
5.0,Dress is gorgeous and super soft. Was exactly as described and fits perfectly.
5.0,"Great fit, and good quality."
5.0,Just what I needed....
5.0,Happy customer here.<br />I received my peices (ordered two one in yellow and one in violet) and it was great.<br />Beautiful peice for the price. Looks elegant.<br />Thank you.
5.0,"This product fits in my helix piercing kind of weird, for some reason it doesn't look in my ear how it looks in the manikin's, which really isn't an issue because it still looks pretty good in my ear. Im super happy with this purchase, the shipping wasn't the quickest or most reliable but overall everything was quite well, most likely I will be ordering the product again."
5.0,You cannot find this many finger lights for this low price.  We got these as party favors at a kids' party.  The kids LOVED them and pretty much all other activities stopped when these came out and they started playing and exploring with them.<br /><br />They're bright and they last a long time.  Kids love them.  They're fairly well made.  The elastic strap is the first part of it to fail and we had to reattach some straps before giving them out.  No big deal.<br /><br />Have fun with these great favor gifts!!
5.0,My great niece will love this little purse as a Christmas gift.
5.0,this sweater fit perfectly and feels super soft. the color is exactly as pictured. I am definitely ordering more!!!
5.0,not as big as i thought it would be but i should have done my homework on it.  having said that i still liked the product because it is well made and very nice to look at. has a nice light feel to it and i would buy more of these if and when they come out.
5.0,"Some reviewers didn't like the front pattern saying it was cheap.<br />I wanted shirt for casual use and didn't find that a problem.  It<br />is 100% cotton in size Large.  I wanted a 2nd one, same shirt, and<br />ordered a Medium which came ""polyester"" with no stretch.  This<br />cotton shirt is great."
5.0,These are for my 8 year olds. They go through sunglasses like no one's business! :) They are constantly broken or lost or left out in the yard for the mower to destroy!  :o  So a 10 pack that has UV protection and comes in fun colors for girls and boys is great!
5.0,Really Nice Purse. I purchased this for my 16 year old niece. she likes the sling purses but needed something a little bigger. this is the perfect size for just that. Cute color and quality is good. lots of pockets on the inside.
5.0,Unusual small bag. If you only carry a few items this bag lets you do it beautifully.
5.0,"Very cool shoes and excellent quality.  My boy love it. I really recommend it, very comfortable shoes. Not only for basketball."
5.0,Surprisingly this item looks and works better that I expected for the price. The light is nice and bright and it has more functions than we expected. A definite must buy for the price.
5.0,I have a lot of open back shirts and needed a cute bralette. This is absolutely perfect! I think it looks so cute
5.0,takes you right back the '80s. Works as it should and durable while light weight.
5.0,"This backpack is all it’s advertisedto be and then some. While I haven’t taken it out in the woods yet, I HAVE loaded it up with my backpacking gear, and still could fit a week’s worth of clothing in it. Convenient pocket locations, a drawstring to better close the top and help secure your items, about a 3 inch extension to unzip and maximize storage, and best of all, it’s CHEAP. It’s cheap without being made cheaply or shoddily"

He slipped them on and now I will be ordering 2 more pairs one pair will be for another football player and also for my brother for fishing.

5.0,Looked great with the black maxi dress for my gender reveal!
5.0,Perfect size that I was looking for. Love them!

5.0,"My granddaughter loves wearing this on her boring everyday uniform,  gives her a little kitty style."
5.0,So cute keychain. Very delicate and pretty. Simple but motivational. Bought as a gift for friend who is a fitness enthusiasts. He loved it.
5.0,"This is super cute and works well. Doesn’t irritate my skin. One thing I noticed is that it says it’s 14 gauge, but it feels thicker than my 14 gauge ring I had in before. I got it in pretty easily but I definitely felt some resistance and it felt much tighter. It was a bit tight the first day but wasn’t too bad after a while. Cute as heck though."
5.0,Used it to keep my kids glasses up on her face durring hockey she can see now when she plays.
5.0,The dress is very comfortable and flattering! I love the sleeves. Very satisfied with the dress except I ordered Khaki and expected it to be more green. It looks grey but that’s OK I love it! True to size and it’s a nice length. Also launders very well. Totally satisfied.
5.0,"I haven't tried them out at the gym yet, but i just wanted to say that this is the 1st time i had to go down about 1-2 sizes for active pants & i gained weight. I'm 220 lbs/100 kg at 5'4""/1.62m, my belly is 50in/127cm around, my actual hips are 48.5in/123cm around. Having high waist stuff is annoying cause of my belly in the way, obviously even tho I've been going to the gym 3-4 days per week since 2020. If you're able to do the Prime Try for Free, do it and pick the next size down to what you're used to getting."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:f2511a46ad935b7042f532d5e526d116]] The necklace comes in modest packaging, just a ziplock pouch with a cardboard holder.  The pendant is just over 1.5"" long.  It's a nice accessory for a young TS fan."

5.0,Love this shirt- I get TONS of comments on it when I wear it!
5.0,I like it but it is small on my big head
5.0,This was actually a gift. My lived one loved the color and fit. Worn in canada. Perfect.
5.0,I have purchased this brand before and was happy to find them on Amazon at such a great price.  Not sure why there are several low ratings.  I love these jeggings. Very flattering and I receive many compliments.  Asian sizing so make sure you check the chart before selecting size.  I normally wear size 8 and purchase L/XL. Perfect fit. Not binding and look like faded skinny jeans. Great with a smart tunic top and boots.
5.0,Nice?
5.0,"This is my 2nd dress, i liked the first one so much. This dress fits nicely, is flattering (especially on my big butt). Consider the length, as an older woman it feels right on the edge of ""a little too short"". I will buy another though."
5.0,"They absorb perfectly. I was worried about the size because I'm plus size, but they fit like a dream. I wear them at night and when i need a break from my cup. did i mention they are super easy to wash? They are worth every penny and i will be purchasing a few more."
5.0,"Gave this to my daughters favorite teacher and shed just loved it, it does not look cheap it is really shiny and looks expensive.  Would definitely would buy again."
5.0,"Aside from being cute, it is super soft.  Stretchy cotton shirt that is very flattering.  I purchased the pink and it is a nice, heather pink color.  The words are clear and easy to read.  Great price, arrived fairly quickly."
5.0,Perfect for my DIY projects.  Will buy again when needed.
5.0,The slippers fit burrfect! And very soft and comfy. They are so soft that my dog likes to lay his head on my feet as if the slippers were pillows!
5.0,I have received a ton of compliments!
5.0,"Beautiful. Fits perfectly, and can be adjusted for various sizes. Looks like the picture and feels very durable."

5.0,Very confortable!
5.0,Love this!! It was exactly what I was looking for - I love the reverse picket for quick storage and retrieval of my tennis ball or pickleball.
5.0,These sandals are great. I have gone on multiple walks wearing these and they are super comfortable. I have issues with my feet and knees and I can wear these with no issues! The are cute and are not as complicated as they seem to be.<br /><br />The only thing I will say about these is that they run a little small. I wear a 10-10.5 and since they didn't have a 10.5 option I went with an 11 and I am glad I did. They just fit. If I had gone down to a 10 there would have been no way that I would have been able to wear these.
5.0,Great for the price. Classy too
5.0,Definitely worth the buy
5.0,I brought this for my bratty nephew..lol he loves it! He says it has alot of space for his suff.
5.0,I love the holographic strip on these. They are nice quality and the material allows you to tie once and not double knot. They stay in place. I did iron them when I got them so they would lay flat but I’m really detailed like that. It’s not necessary. Definitely makes a difference if you buy crappy shoelaces and these are great!
5.0,"Its perfect, I am so happy with the design and it has nice little pockets to stick my cooking utensils in!"
5.0,Love this backpack!!
5.0,Great deal overall! Not pricey  but good lens clarity and a strong build. Hard case and microfiber soft case are a nice bonus
5.0,"These were to small for me.  But it turned out that they fit my aunt and grandmother perfectly.  So I was able to give them a gift of these wonderful slippers.<br />They are so comfy.  I have plantar feciatis and my feet hurt all the time. I also have lymphodema so my feet swell.  These are by far the most confortable sandles I have ever bought.  I can wear them for hours and be much more active because my feet hurt so much less with them on.  Thank you!!!!!  I would give a bit of a warning though.  They really are not safe for the water. My feet slip inside the sandle and I almost fell the other day wearing them in the river. The sandal stayed put and my foot slipped in the sandal.  Thank goodness I didn't get hurt, but lesson learned.  Dry off your feet and sandles before you wear them.  Otherwise, they are like walking on clouds.  I wear a size 8.5 ww in mens or 9www in womens and the 42-43 are a little long but the 40-41 are to tight because of my feet swelling.  So if you have no sweeling in your feet the smaller size is better for you.  Cheers"
5.0,I bought these for a friend and she loves them. She said they were very soft and very comfortable!<br />Time to buy myself the set !
5.0,"Beautiful and solid timepiece. Received before due date, which was nice. Excellent buy with free shipping. I personally love the KS watches."
5.0,"Very comfy, feels like sleeping in a cloud!<br />I don't use fabric softener or a heated dryer, tho. Have a feeling, it would soon begin to get fuzzy and pill.<br />Works great for it's intended purpose as a nightshirt."

5.0,"These are so nice. Malachite looks real. These are a gift for one of my aunts who has a few health issues. Malachite is an amazing healing stone and I hope these help alleviate some of her pain.

5.0,"This was a great kit.  Love the 2 different band colors.  I have huge wrists, like I struggle to find a watch that fits because my wrists are so big, and I pulled 3 links out of this band to make it fit.  No issues with fitment into the watch either. Great buy!"
5.0,"Love this  Shirt.  Have you ever put on the garment that your whole body loved and enjoyed?  This is what happens to me when I ordered and  tried on my first shirt.  I loved them so much  I had to order both long and short sleeve in all colors .  The size and quality  was exactly as advertised and more.  You won’t go wrong with ordering this item at its price point or higher.  Thank you for using small logos on your shirts, not every customer wants to be a walking billboard.<br />W Myers Jr."

5.0,"I love this bag.  It's stylish, and big enough for all my stuff, yet not too big.  I love that it doesn't sag or deflate when I set it down.  That makes it easy to stick my hand in and grab what I need.  The only thing that could make this bag better is if it were made of leather."
5.0,i lost it but dont feel like buying again..looks great tho
5.0,Super short but will be cute for Fall with leggings!
5.0,This polo t shirt and denim shorts are crazy adorable. First thy shirt is red and navy blue. The denim shorts are streaky which I was not expecting. The shirt is 100 percent cotton. I love how cute this set is However I got the size 3T and this fits my 5-year-old daughter who is in size 6. They are comfortable and soft against my kids skin which I love. This arrived way earlier than I expected which I loved. This is a very good quality and well-made set I would recommend this to anyone with a little boy who need cute school clothes. It is really worth the money for this clothing set.<br /><br />I received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

5.0,"Now you can wear your good earrings without fear.  I've lost an earring sleeping on a plane, and most recently, taking off a mask.  I had some earrings modified with screwposts at $100 a pair.  These are less than 1/10th that price. They are also sized generously enough to handle easily, too.  Just bought silver and gold sets for my daughter as a stocking stuffer."
5.0,I used this as a holiday clutch and everyone loved it!
5.0,Bought this for a Christmas gift.<br />Great quality and price was good.
5.0,"Bought these for my 12 year old grandson. He wanted to start running in the evenings. By the time he gets home in the winter time, it is already dark. I thought this would be cool, with the added protection of making him more visible."

5.0,"I love it, great quality nice look, I just need it in more colors."

5.0,Very perfect leotard. Fits perfect and is soft. Doesn't button so you have to take the whole thing off to use the bathroom but that's okay
5.0,"These are the best no-show socks.  Perfect thickness-not too thin and not too thick, the material is comfy and it stays on better than other socks.  Plus it really is no-show.  Other “no shows” actually show.<br /><br />I like the black color since it doesnt show discoloration or stain."

5.0,LOVE THIS!!!!
5.0,Gift for a young gymnast.  I think she will like it.
5.0,"I love this dress. I bought an XL. I received many compliments on it. Yes, like others mentioned you have to be careful and use double sided taoe to not let your girls run free. It flattered my shape, I have a small fupa but I was able to wear shapewear with it. Buy it."
5.0,"Nice quality, and arrived as expected.  It fit on a pandora bracelet nicely, and was well detailed without being difficult to wear."
5.0,I want more
5.0,"I love my new wallet. It has lots of compartments and plenty of places to carry all of my credit cards and rewards cards. It is really easy to carry money in and I can also put my checks in it. It stays snapped really great. It also has a snap inside so only part of it opens at a time. It is small enought to fit in your purse, but big enough to carry by itself and have everything with you. I would definitly buy this again if I had the chance. I got mine for free and I love it. Thank you for making such a great product. Keep up the good work!<br /><br />I am in no way affiliated with this company and have given my true and honest opinion of the product."
5.0,"I am a branch manager for a bank and I am typically in suits. I was looking for a dress that I could wear in the summers and still look professional. This dress has a good structure, quality material, feels comfortable and looks nice. I like that this dress is nice enough that I can dress it up with heels and pearls but simple enough that I can dress it down for other functions.<br /><br />I originally bought the nude but I look washed out in it because it is the same color as my skin tone. This is not the manufacturer's fault though and I'm sure that if you are a lighter or darker skin tone than me it would look gorgeous! I will be returning it and getting it in 2 other colors.<br /><br />I typically wear a small but based on the size chart I went with a medium and it was a perfect fit! For reference, I'm 5'5 and roughly 140lbs with a smaller frame."
5.0,Live my simply southern shirts
5.0,I LOVE IT!!
5.0,"This is such a nice dress, I got a size bigger and it was a bit bigger on me but I usually do that because clothes these days run small but this dress was very roomy and had a lot of space. it's a very pretty dress to wear to Church."
5.0,Absolutely cute! I highly recommend this
5.0,Beautiful! Love pastels for spring! Such a great value!
5.0,I love this bag!  I love it so much I ordered another one in brown and one in gray!
5.0,"I love the fit and feel of this shirt and would definitely buy this item again.  I am 5.4 and 140lbs and typically wear a Large just because I don't like anything tight.  For this item, I ordered an XL and it fit just as I wanted it too, it wasn't too tight and doesn't appear to look big on me either."

5.0,"I bought it for my mom , she really like it bcos it is warm , thick and light in weight ."
5.0,Nice quality and very doft

5.0,I use it for my Jean's but the way it looks it can easily be for a suit. It's like something out of star trek. I would buy it again and again.
5.0,This is exactly what I ordered. It's soft and well made. I'm using it for a Halloween costume for my daughter. She really likes the bright green color.
5.0,"Another tee to add to my son’s wardrobe. It fit him perfect and matches his adidas slides. It’s super soft, the material is of quality. Great everyday tee shirt to have."
5.0,Very nice gloves
5.0,"Extremely cute, soft and comfy. Only thing was when I read anti skid I thought that meant traction on bottom of socks. With that addition it would be more then perfect. Still love them and will get more."
5.0,Beautiful and great quality for the price I've got many complements
5.0,Third set of these I have ordered.  I’m tall and these are definitely long enough for my torso. Only undershirt I will wear. Great product with fast delivery.
5.0,Looks very good on.  Very flattering!
5.0,So far so good. Perfect size for golf course and hiking. Hoping it stays leak proof or it’s going on the trash.
5.0,"Fits right, very comfortable, great price. These are great under a Jersey skirt. I have a bunch of these in 100% cotton, but cotton clings to a Jersey material (T-Shirt material), so this was the perfect choice for that type of skirt. Had no issues with static either."
5.0,Feels super nice. Fits well. Keeps me warm.
5.0,"Great product for the price. It’s somewhat short in the fit, so you will need a top over it unless you have a washboard stomach...which I’m working on.<br />I wear these tops when working out, under my clothes and as a sleep top. I’ve ordered almost every color and multiple packages because I find myself wearing them every day : )<br />I’m 5”3’ and weigh about 118 lbs (normally weigh 114). I ordered the top in medium and it fits perfectly."

5.0,"These are slippers that do what they are suppose to do. They are warm, soft and comfortable. Plus they are easy to take on and off and they do not slip on hardwood floors. Additionally, they do not leave marks and they fit perfectly. They do attract lint and dog hair, but that is OK if you live in a cold climate. The husband just loves them and I certainly would buy them again."
5.0,"Great purse, lots of room soft leather"
5.0,"Sons birthday gift, he LOVED THEM. Says they're comfortable and the kids at school compliment him for them."
5.0,"My adult daughter is a huge fan of Owl House and this gift was a major winner! She was speechless, and that takes a lot! It's really beaultifully made for just being some hard plastic. If you have a fan in your life, or if you are a fan of Owl House yourself, this is 100% worth the price."
5.0,Love it best little carry all just wish it had a pocket on each side of the inside center everyone loves it
5.0,So cute! Fit my 3 year old perfect for a bridal shower we attended! So many compliments and it is one of her now favorite dresses.

5.0,Very nice.. Love the purse..
5.0,"I LOVE this bag!!!!! Arrived quickly. I want one in black! Beautifully made, Jumbo size and fits EVERYTHING, lots of pockets, quality material, looks rich and classic. The only downside is I wish the hardware was more gold hued. It's more of a light fade gold."
5.0,Loved everything about it. Hope they have it in Black. Material and neckline FABULOUS!
5.0,delivered extremely fast and recipient was thrilled
5.0,"I got theses leggings because I was tired of spending the money on Lulus. I found these and decided to give a try. The day them came in I happened to be wearing my lulus and took them off and tried these on. Almost perfect, so worth the price and I don’t think I will be spending the $100+ on lulus ever again. These are a perfect duo for the align. They have the pocket, the buttery soft feel, and equally as comfortable. I wear a size 6 in my lulus and I bought these in a Medium and they fit great. I would say that these have just a tad bit more compression around the midsection but not to tight or uncomfortable. I would say these are totally worth it and if you have read this far then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR CLICK THAT ADD TO CART. All else fails you can return them to your nearest Kohl’s (which is also super convenience)."
5.0,LOVE this! Holds a good amount AND SOOOO cute! You'll love this too!
5.0,These shorts are amazing; comfortable and flattering. I have two different colors and also leggings from the same seller and on both size M is good for me though I have big thighs and butt (waist 29” hips 46”) The waist band is so smoothing and snatches you well. Also the shorts don’t fall off at all in the gym or when running. Great quality and great seller. My absolute favorite at Amazon.
5.0,"Great watch. Last Citizen Ecodrive watch I bought lasted 30 years. This one is beautiful, classy, sophisticated."
5.0,My husband seems to like it.
5.0,Extremely well made and very sharp looking. A great tribute to everything Patriotic.
5.0,"is a very good and important, quality is excellent, of good material and it does the job properly without any problem"
5.0,These were an iffy buy for me. I have a larger butt and hips and a smaller waist. I thought these would either make me look super wide or fit just right and luckily they fit just right. I ordered the neon green and its a super vibrant color. I will repurchase more because these are sooo comfortable
5.0,"Large was TrueToSize for my frame; 6'2"", 180lbs.; just loose enough, nice colors, comfortable"
5.0,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
5.0,My sales coach loved it as a gift. I couldn't think of anything to get him for his birthday. I got him this and he leaves it at his desk at the office. Pretty funny gift.
5.0,Love 'em
5.0,"Very comfortable, slightly large. Washes well."
5.0,"I bought this skirt in hopes of finding something stretchy that look great on my big bottom. And I found it! This skirt is very lightweight and buttery soft yet it holds all my junk together so I look nice and curvy. It feels just like LuLaRoe products, but it's HALF the price! I'll definitely be ordering more!!"
5.0,These earrings are colorful and long. They are just as pictured. I received many compliments.
5.0,Fabulous n light! Lots of compliments

5.0,This is stunning! Looks real.
5.0,"Beautiful!!! My daughter, who I can NEVER get in a dress saw it and said she wanted it for her birthday party, #13. It's a little big because she's a toothpick but tall. With the price, I don't mind taking it to get professionally tailored. The color looks great on her skin tone, fair, and her short brown hair allows every detail to shine. The fun part, she's wearing sneakers!!! They took longer to find then the dress!!"
5.0,My girls love them. Sturdy. Will fade in days
5.0,Good quality and fits perfectly
5.0,Cute matching shirts . We love them

5.0,Love the necklace
5.0,Bought these for a wedding party as they danced I to the reception to 80's music. Great value!
5.0,"Cheap, but good quality for the price. They look so cute on. Ideal for people who have had ear surgery."
5.0,"I like it a lot and could even wear the necklace as a choker around my neck , however I feel more comfortable with a little larger necklace which I have a 22"" that does great.<br /> I've had a bunch of comments and inquiries about the contents in the charm pendent all awesome.<br />As an 80 yr old male I guess I'm nuts but I do love the thing and recommend it for anyone that wants to live a happy life."
5.0,"Muy lindo le quedó a mi bebé , excelente"
5.0,These socks are made well and super warm. They come in a cute little pouch and since they were a gift - perfect.<br />I would definitely recommend.
5.0,"Love this top. Long sleeve but not too thick, pulls in at the waist and lets out at little at the hip for a nice fit that is flattering. Definitely going to be a cozy winter favorite."
5.0,"Rad pants! Velcro belt for custom sizing, breathable, and awesome design, totally stoked"
5.0,Easy to adjust. Lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,great product...
5.0,Great for driving but not good for power washing as the chemicals strip the reflective coating
5.0,"This is so comfy and soft and it is holding its shape well after washings.  Nice length with leggings, too!"

5.0,"Great Hat!<br />Think Leather, weel made!"
5.0,The earring is nice but for some reason I thought it was bigger but never the less it will serve it's propose
5.0,Perfect..
5.0,"I bought this bag for the express purpose of using it at Walt Disney World. It was told it was waterproof, and for the most part, it is. I say for the most part, because we were hit by a freak storm so powerful and with so much water falling from the sky, it was not surprising that even this mighty little bag could not stand up to the elements.  That said, the Waterfly is something I refuse to leave for vacation without because it really works as a great bag to use for everyday exploration, be it in a theme park, or touring around in the big city. It is very small, deceptively so because it holds so much that you think there has to be a limit to what it can hold. I have had this bag for about six months now, and I have yet to find the limit. The bag rolls up nicely as well and can easily be packed for travel. I love this little bag, and I can not recommend it nearly enough,  definitely a must buy if you are traveling to a theme park!"
5.0,Nice reasonable shorts have used once so far lived up to my expectations.
5.0,Definitely size up. Not a thick material so it’s good for cool days. Imagine and design is nice it doesn’t look cheap.
5.0,"I just love my new Grandma shirt, nothing better then being a grandparent!!! I'm thinking about getting another shirt someday!!!"
5.0,Wifey just loves it! Better than expected. Took it to the coach outlet and they said it was better than a lot of the bags sold there. She's soooo happy. 😀
5.0,My 16 year old niece loved this.
5.0,I purchased these for my wife and she loves them. Each headband has the elastic/sticky strip inside of it to help keep it in place unlike some other cheap one's we have purchased .
5.0,They are Just like in the picture. I’ve received so many compliments on them
5.0,"Wore for 4th of July. Very comfortable, true to size, and washes well."

5.0,Beautiful.<br />Chain does not pull hair.<br />I get a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,These were exactly what I needed to complete husband Halloween costume.  Nicely made!
5.0,Fit excellent
5.0,"Excellent, easy to use, and more stylish than most over the glasses lenses.  I really like mine and the price didn't be break the bank.  Give them a try, you won't regret it."
5.0,I bought this Marine logo wallet for my nephew who graduated from MCRD in San Diego in March.<br />the leather wallet looked well made.  just wished it had a bit of color on the Marine symbol
5.0,"We loved this hat, it was for a birthday party where we were asked to dress Mexican."
5.0,Very good gift for my boss. She loved it!
5.0,Worked well. No issues at all.
5.0,did what it was suppose to
5.0,"These are actually great - and I can't even begin to say how picky I am.  ;)<br />They have full coverage and don't cause a wedgie and don't grab or ride up the front.<br />They are sized a bit off - just order one size up and you should be fine.<br />They look great on, too!  The solid ones look really good.  The patterns are so ridiculous that they're funny.  The pictures are NOT accurate.  One of mine has tinker bell all over them.  Another has tons of small rainbows.  And another has both owls and kittens and the phrase &#34;be nerdy!&#34;  Nope, not joking.  But they're so funny that they're borderline cute.  And imagine if I get hit by a bus wearing those?  lol<br />Someone mentioned they feel rough - nope.  They're all cotton, so they don't feel silky like nylon.  But they're soft and breathable and that's what I care about.<br />And the price is amazing.  Would definitely get more."
5.0,"Super cute, too sparkly for everyday wear. It makes my small butt look great, but doesnt make my hips look too large. Makes me look like the true hourglass that I am. Honestly my favorite formal dress, and I will probably buy more in more casual colors."
5.0,My grandson loved it.
5.0,I dislike the size chart! Mine were too small but they are beautiful
5.0,Perfect for my daughter 💯
5.0,"I was skeptical about buying a dress online as I have a very curvy short frame. The dress fit better than I could ever imagine. No alterations were needed, it was formed fitting and flattering in all the right areas. BEAUTIFUL DRESS!"
5.0,Cute Mickey earrings
5.0,These fit well and work as expected. The quality is very good!!!

5.0,It is very beautiful and I am glad that I bought it. It matches earrings and I receive compliments on it all the time.
5.0,I'm 5'3&#34; 160 ordered a L or XL sorry don't remember.  I have a short torso and big bottom it fit perfect.  I returned it because I didn't wear it.
5.0,"Love this top, just wish it did not wrinkle so much after washing it."
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable, and looks awesome!"
5.0,"This is a gift for a friend in Africa. I have not tried to use it; however, it seems to work and I know the young man will be pleased to receive a gift from America."
5.0,Good product.  Works great.
5.0,Cool watch serving it’s purpose 😬
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:fb6a262364152aeeb47fc01d853e44ed]] This always has been and always will be my favorite ring. We spent a lot of time ordering several different rings that were several hundred dollars that just weren’t pleasing to the eye once they arrived or were too small. I finally said I’d rather buy something that’s<br />Cheaper for now and later on go to a jewelry store and buy one. This came in and I was shocked. It sparkles like any real ring. It only briefly slightly turned my finger green on the underside after several months of wear. 3 years later I still love it but some of the smaller settings have fallen out, 3 to be exact, which is why I’m ordering another one. It’s true to size, comfortable, and not gaudy at all or over the top. I hope anyone that makes this purchase enjoys theirs as much as I enjoy(ed) mine. We actually did make a purchase for engraved rings just shy of a year ago from a different company and Twice, both times the main setting fell out and those were rather pricey. So I will just stick to this one."
5.0,Very comfortable & excellent coverage
5.0,Love these cover ups. They r light and nice to wear over tank tops to cover your arms with out feeling like your wearing layers and layers of clothes. Especially in the summer.
5.0,A well made robe....very comfortable.
5.0,"Good quality,  good price."
5.0,It's awesome and well worth the money..I am very pleased with it. it is very pretty..  I like the idea of the channel stack rings....They are so pretty and shine and sparkle so much..Thank You Nancy
5.0,"I am beyond THRILLED with this jumpsuit! I ordered it for a part of an Elton John Inspired bedazzled jumpsuit, and this fit perfectly! The flair is amazing, it fits very well! The cleavage is a little much but that is an easy fix. I was going to order a size 16/18 W but we feared it would be to large, so I ordered a regular 16/18 and it fits right, with a bit of stretch room. Overall it is a good deal for the price!! Highly recommend."
5.0,Wish I cared enough to take pics but they’re legit for a great price I usually don’t have faith that anything’s going to fit good but these did
5.0,My son got this as a Christmas gift from me. He loves it. Wears it almost every day.
5.0,"I've had tons of compliments on this top, I love it! Like others have mentioned, there are tiny holes where it looks like the tag was cut off but they aren't too noticeable on my shirt."
5.0,Ladies Please get this. I’m 235 and 5’7. Carry my weight on my booty. I got an XL and fits soo perfect
5.0,These glasses are nice. They look much more expensive than they were.
5.0,Muy bien el producto. Creí que era de cuero. Pero es cuerina.
5.0,Real soft on the inside too.
5.0,"I love them. I'm a 12 -12 and a 1/2, (Tall chick) The 13's and 12's both fit me well."
5.0,Cute and have held up nicely
5.0,Awesome for my 4 year old - a little small for the 7 year old
5.0,"This jacket is warm and has great quality for the value! Looks great and expensive!!! And it feels great as well, just order a size up!"
5.0,Very cute tye dye pattern! Good quality shoe for a great price
5.0,Fits well - its nice and light weight so even on milder days you don't overheat.
5.0,"My new favorite jewelry vendor is Earlums. I've gone on a spree; I now own 6 cuffs by them and just ordered another. This particular design appealed greatly to me, and I was not disappointed when they arrived several days ago. I have worn them every day and it is fun to add other small colorful earrings (if the piercing is big enough to accomodate, of course) to spice things up a bit. The cuff and earrings are so very light and comfortable I hardly feel them at all, and they look so pretty; I am constantly tucking my hair behind my ear so as to see them better (and to make sure others see them too!). I read in several other reviews that they are made of plastic. The designers did a convincing job of making them look like metal because I would never have known - although the fact that they feel so light I guess should be a clue. I am absolutely enthralled with these reasonably priced and very pretty pieces of jewelry!"
5.0,I love it. Its exactly what I was expecting.
5.0,Absolutely love this piece. Super cute style. Great quality for price.
5.0,"They fit very nicely. They’re incredibly comfortable along with the Ted Baker quality. It’s really hard to find shoes my size, 12 that don’t make it look like I have clown feet"
5.0,I bought a pair for nursing.  I had to buy more these where the most comfortable socks for the 14 hour shifts.  Thank you.  Highly recommend
5.0,Nice product very comfortable
5.0,"My son got this for his friend, and it's now one of the only shirts that he wears! It's a really cool shirt and fits well on him."
5.0,The dress is absolutely gorgeous. I bought the burgundy color and is just like in the picture. I ordered M and I am 5&#34;7 and 138 pounds  the dress fit perfect. I am ready to order another one in black.
5.0,Ermoso
5.0,The outfit is very comfortable and it fit me the way I like. I would buy again.
5.0,"Purchased to store my Peloton equipment. It’s perfect! Compact, easy to install & keeps everything organized!"
5.0,My favorite pair of glasses
5.0,Fit great! I received several complements and the color is amazing 😉
5.0,"I have big calves, unfortunately, and can NEVER find knee highs that fit comfortable. These were awesome, completed my Hermione costume perfectly lol"
5.0,"Cute and cheap, but if you are OCD about the rivets going all the way around you these belts don't."
5.0,I order one size up and is perfect 😍
5.0,These are amazing! I ordered these while I was waiting forever for a pair of LulaRoe black. They both came today 3 weeks on LLR 2 days from AMAZON. I love these VIV leggings to me they are better than the other ones and I am sending the LLR ones back. These are 1/2 the price too!
5.0,"I love this dress! It’s light and flowy. It is long enough, nearly touches my knees but at a flattering height. It is the perfect summer dress."
5.0,This is a great mask! It came just as described with the two masks (purple and black) with the ear plugs. The material is super soft memory foam. I am a stomach sleeper and had no problem with this at all. I like the depth in the eye area so it allows room for blinking.<br /><br />I purchased for myself but hope my husband will try the other one for himself. The head strap worked great and was comfortable. There was a little bit of light coming through the nose area (not that big of a deal) but I have yet to find a mask that has completely blocked out 100% of light. This is a great sleeping mask and would recommend it to light sensitive sleepers. I did get this product at a reduced rate for my opinion but that did not reflect my review in any way.
5.0,Fits true to size!
5.0,Very good goggles. My boys loves them.
5.0,"Depending on what is going on with my eyes, these can actually be a cool change from regular glasses. They are a bit tinted for most things but if your eyes are tired, they can work."
5.0,"I recently wore this shirt to the Reds' Opening Day party at work, and it was super comfortable. I helped serve hot dogs, pasta salad, baked beans, etc. to a long line of employees for a couple of hours, and it was a breeze since the shirt fit so nicely. I even got to throw my old Reds t-shirt with holes away."
5.0,Husband loves it. Says it fits well.
5.0,Great job and very pretty stone and delivery was earlier than planned thanx
5.0,"I love the fit.,it’s a little long but on only 5ft. But the color is great, I’d buy more again."
5.0,These look great on my woman. Get them. Thank me later.
5.0,I had to glue a stone back on but I love them.  So delicate and beautiful color
5.0,Bought this to use at the company BBQ and am I ever glad!  I manned one of those huge charcoal grills and this really saved the day.  This is great if you do any sort of competition BBQ.
5.0,These are very delicate and pretty. The leverback makes them easy to put on and are taken off easily as well. The saturated blue color is just as pictured.
5.0,"I got these for my mom for a gift, and they are very pretty. They go nicely with a variety of outfits that have blue in them. Great for someone who loves birds and likes a simple and feminine style of earring."
5.0,Arrived in 2 days and fit perfect!!!!
5.0,n ice
5.0,My husband wanted to send this to his oldest daughter because he always sang this song to her when she was little.
5.0,I have a 37&#34; waist. This fits perfectly without causing any uncomfortable snuggness. Not too lose not too​ tight
5.0,Bought this to wear to a Roaring 20s themed party. Dress was both comfortable and flattering. Easy  to get into and out of.
5.0,"Excellent value! Socks arrived quickly, and they are soft and wash up well."
5.0,"I love the fabric, I love the design, it's flattering and perfect for somewhat formal ocassions."
5.0,It matches a belly ring i already have!!!
5.0,"I bought these in a size 13 for my 4 year old daughter and they fit just about perfectly. There's enough room to wear with socks, but not too big to wear without. She's worn them everyday for about 2 weeks and so far there are no signs of wear and tear. I'll definitely be ordering her other designs, and a few pairs for myself as well. Hot Chocolate shoes are awesome!"
5.0,A lovely bracelet. Should come in silver as well.
5.0,I love that they have a no skid sole and are very thin. The bad part is the band wears out quick. It looks like latex but otherwise a great value for the price
5.0,"These goggles are perfect! We've tried so many cheaply made goggles that when I received these I was beyond thrilled that they actually looked good quality. I am super picky when it comes to things for my child but these were just above my expectations! No water ever entered the goggles and she had no issue seeing out of them. She was also able to put the goggles on easily without pulling half her curly, wild hair off!<br />The goggles still have plenty of room to grow with her, you'll see there's still ample rubber to extend the goggles larger. She's extremely excited that she has her own pair, like mommy's, that will actually hold up to her swimming underwater! We're huge swimmers and are in the pool or lake every week, at least once. You've just saved her eyes from the dreaded bloodshot look all summer!<br />I gotta mention the fantastic case they come in too! It took me a while to figure out how to open them but once I did it was super easy. For those that are curious, you just turn the grey tip on the end and the case open super easy! It's a great travel case!!<br />I gotta mention the fantastic case they come in too! It took me a while to figure out how to open them but once I did it was super easy.

5.0,"These long sleeve shirts fit a bit large, but they're a great wardrobe staple. I got them for my growing eight year old son so I don't mind the extra room at all. The fabric is breathable and stretchy and we also have these in the short sleeve version. My son says they're the most comfortable shirts he has. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Chain exactly as described. Bought for my sisters 21st birthday to match a cameo pendant.  Looked great and quick to ship. Excellent gift and service.
5.0,I like it due to the water resistant and easy to read and all the things she can use it for especially for learning
5.0,Beautiful and you can't beat the price.
5.0,"Favorite bra, good quality."
5.0,Love these.  Have had them now several months and no holes yet.
5.0,The shirts arrived quickly and are a real bargain
5.0,"Overall it's exactly what it's described as. Even fully folded over, it's not tight on my wrist but I have very small wrists. I didn't notice when I ordered, but the connectors are black plastic. This is nice because my watch is all black and I don't like the look of silver connectors."
5.0,"My daughter lives in this shirt. It’s a little too cropped for her dad’s preference - however, it’s adorable and a complete go to."
5.0,"This dress popped up in my email and I'm glad I ordered it.  Free-feeling-fun-fits as expected!  Light weight, perfect for summer fun."
5.0,My second pair ! Bought my first pair at Marshall’s and couldn’t find a replacement there. Thank god for amazon ! It my favorite style and fit
5.0,This cover-up is super easy to put on and take off after swimming. It's also a great length and very cute!
5.0,Pretty top and good quality so far.
5.0,I love them and they fit perfectly!
5.0,Very comfortable!  I particularly like the taupe color.  Excellent price and value!  I bought a second identical pair two weeks later at the great bargain price!
5.0,I just got it today and it looks exactly like the image. This is lace and chain so of course people should handle it carefully and gently. I really like it but it'll be nice if I have a Lolita dress as well
5.0,Me encanta buena calidad
5.0,Nice dress if you are tall
5.0,A big hi! Everyone who sees it loves it.
5.0,Great quality towel material that is very cozy.  I would definitely recommend this bathrobe.
5.0,"I love the belt, but the buckle I went with pokes me in the waist. Nice belt, but be careful with your buckle choice."
5.0,Like how its snug and doesn't warp or shrink when washed and dried. Highly recommended for any venom fan.
5.0,Super warm and cozy! True to size ! Great buy definitely recommend
5.0,"Feels like good quality workmanship! Very comfortable to hold and wear! Not difficult to move the seeds through my fingers, though having a knot between would be better! Still it's a great addition to my meditation practice!"
5.0,Better than a regular bra use them for all dressing I love them comfortable better than all bras
5.0,My daughter loves them and they seem pretty durable.
5.0,"I threw out all my old socks to standardize on these.  They're in the athletic style but look good enough to use as dress socks, in my opinion."
5.0,Cute styling - only missing pockets
5.0,"Just what I was looking for and stainless steel is a bonus! I have double piercings and ordered 2 different sizes,  very pleased."
5.0,"How pretty it is, goes so very nicely with my helenite ring and earrings..."
5.0,my third pair - love these shoes!
5.0,"My wife loved the shirt. She wears a medium and this fit perfect in the medium.  It is a thin material this color is not see thru. They say this is lake blue which is a nice color.  The listing shows this color much darker, almost navy so beware this is a light blue not dark.  It is called a v-neck but it's between a scoop and a v.  I would purchase more colors from them  the quality seems good."
5.0,Just what I was looking for my daughter.
5.0,So happy I read the reviews and went smaller. I am 5'7&#34; and ordered a small and the dress is just above my knees. The sleeves are very comfortable not tight or stiff. Overall very good quality dress.
5.0,"These gloves are soft and do what they're told. The medium fit greats. Also, you can text with these on like a boss."
5.0,"Ordered for my boyfriend. He loves the long tee style and wears this camo one out all the time! Great price and fits as expected! He is 6’4 and 260lbs, I ordered him an XL."
5.0,This fits into a tiny purse but it’s sturdy and well made and holds a good amount.  Tried other wallets but kept this one. Should have bought this one first.
5.0,"They are a bit small, I am not normally an extra large anything, so it was good to know ahead of time to order a size larger. Comfortable and just what I wanted."
5.0,Great for the price and fits nice and comfortably
5.0,Love this belly ring! Very cute and light which I like! Highly recommended!
5.0,Loved the quality
5.0,The most comfortable shoes 👠 I ever ordered and they are true to the size
5.0,"Love, love, this brand. The shoes fit me well and I think the styles are creative."
5.0,"Super cute and lightweight, just what I was looking for. I am 5&#34;4 and approx 140 lbs. I ordered size medium and it fits great! The quality seems great as it is 100% cotton. I have a small waist so I crossed the belt in the back before tying it around. Love that the sleeves have swiss tabs. They look great rolled up."
5.0,"$4.95 . . .<br /><br />I've looked at a number of these types of wrist straps in camera stores, and selling for so much more. This one, quality wise, is no different. Materials used, and quality is spot on. I still can't get over the fact its only $4.95, and similar in every way to those selling for more.<br /><br />If you are looking for a wrist strap, I recommend this one. Besides, why spend more than you have to."
5.0,"Haven't used them around extremely loud noise yet, but my kids love them anyway."
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE this top!! It is soft and comfy.  The material in the outside is a silky feel and the inside is soft. I usually wear 2xl and that is the size i got and it fits perfectly!!
5.0,grandson likes them
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for to give my husband, so awesome. :)"
5.0,I get compliments all day with this purse
5.0,I liked this bag so much!!! it is a big size that can fit many things in it and also it is so elegant.
5.0,"These earrings are so good! They are light weight, good quality and adorable! The backs are clear and sturdy. I wear them all the time. They are still in new condition."
5.0,"I purchased the multi color mask and it is hands down my favorite mask. It is so comfortable and you can wear it for long periods of time comfortably. Plus, it's really cute; Everytime I wear this mask I get tons of compliments."
5.0,I am 5'7&#34; and 145 lbs so I opted for the medium and it fits perfectly! The straps are completely adjustable to allow you to get it to fit perfectly and exactly how you like. I am taller so I let mine out a little looser to get a couple inches of length and it fits perfectly!<br /><br />I couldn't believe the quality of the material for such a great price! I am curvy so it is thick enough to hide underwear lines but airy enough to keep you cool and totally accentuates my shape! This will be my go to summer festival dress for sure!
5.0,The material is so soft and comfortable.  This is my first time ordering clothes via Amazon and this was one of my favorites dress with all that arrived today!
5.0,Keeps my kitty very entertained unless she chews it in half then she wants another one.. lucky I have lots..
5.0,"I needed workout pants that were comfortable at the waist because as a mommy of 3, the waist area is my issue when it comes to finding the right pants. These pants kept it all in there without squeezing me uncomfortably. The material also has a good stretch for my workouts which is needed for squats."
5.0,"Nice quality Thanksgiving dress for a great price! I definitely recommend, runs true to size."
5.0,I ordered a bunch of these for a music festival and they worked great!<br />when I got my bulk order there were only 6 duds out of over 200. I was impressed.<br />Shipping was quick and the lights stayed bright for hours.<br />Very happy.
5.0,"Originally, I bought this pair and I loved the style but the frames were too big on my face (I'd like to think I have an average size face for a woman). After writing a three star review, Sojos reached out and replaced my old sunglasses with a new pair that I love and I have gotten a lot of compliments on. Definitely a good brand with cool style."
5.0,"el vestido es hermoso y luce muy bonito, muy contenta con la compra"
5.0,This is a nice warm cap that covers the ears.
5.0,"This item was perfect, based on me inferring my size as you suggested, given the smaller size of garments made for the Asian physique. Their weaving of fabric is excellent!"
5.0,Love my necklaces. Get so many compliments!
5.0,This dress was exactly what I was looking for! Thank you for the fast delivery as well!!! Fit Perfect. I'm a size 8-10 and the Medium fit perfect!! Thank you!!!
5.0,It is a Bow-Tie... It does what a Bow-tie should.<br /><br />Cons: it will not tie itself. Good luck!
5.0,"I needed cheap glasses because I always break my glasses so I don't spend much on them, however I love these they are absolutely amazing! I have stepped on them, they have hit the group multiple times and still keep together. they are flimsy but they work for me :) I haven't had any problems with them."
5.0,Perfect for a Proper English Tea bridal shower!
5.0,"These have been my go-to earrings for years now. I sleep in them, shower in them, and only take them out to clean them every week and then they go right back in. The color on the black and rainbow ones hasn’t faded and the silver ones look great too. I don’t know about the others but these are awesome! I’m allergic to so many metals, but these don’t cause me any issues at all. Great product!"
5.0,"vision is too narrow- too hard for me to get used to. The higher power part works well, but the mid range and far range, not so much- i personally need bifocals i guess so that the peripheral range isn't restricted. I'll give it a 5 star because they do what they are supposed to, but i personally can't wear them"
5.0,⭐️
5.0,"High quality, warm, wash perfectly!"
5.0,"Excellent quality.  Feels like silk, with no loose threads or stitching.  Arrived much sooner than expected.<br />Upon rinsing, some of the dye washed-out but the overall color remains in tact.  Dont wear this on your skin until it's rinsed for that reason."
5.0,"I bought this because I live in a very wet, cold climate, and wool does a great job at insulating when wet. So when I received them, I tried them on and went outside. My hands were warm! However, I did feel my fingertips starting to get cold after spending 30 minutes outside. Also the gloves work great with my phone."
5.0,These arrived packaged very securely. It came with a little cleaning cloth and a protective pouch.<br />I love that they are very light weight and not blackout lenses.  The little silver detail just adds a bit more classy to it.<br />Highly recommend for this price point
5.0,"I am 5’4, ordered a small and it fits perfectly all around."
5.0,Silky smooth-better than expected! Much more shiny in person so be ready to be amazed! Very well made.
5.0,These Sojos are a great knockoff on far more expensive fashion sunglasses in this style.  They are light weight and comfortable.  A word of caution:  keep them in a case as the legs to the glasses can bend if left to &#34;knock around&#34; in your car or purse.  They offer more than adequate glare protection as well as or better than most fashion sunglasses.  I like the various colors offered in this mirror shade and have bought several.  One of my favorites is the pink champagne color.  I get compliments on these wherever I go and people are astounded at how affordable they are.  Hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
5.0,These little girl boots are so cute and appear to be made well.  What I really like about them is that they will be easy to put on and pull off for my little 5 year old granddaughter; and of course the BLING is the most important thing to her!
5.0,Love it! Not a $200 quality sweater but not flimsy either.
5.0,Fits  real big for a small
5.0,"This was the first piece of clothing I bought off of Amazon and I love it! It's so soft and fits as expected. I didn't expect a swim cover up to be very high quality, so this product exceeded my expectations. If you want a cute cover up, I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,"Perfect to run to the store, take a walk or go to the pool. Just what I was looking for."
5.0,Love this product. Came quickly.
5.0,Great for the price!!! Would be able to use it on adults as well. Super happy with this considering all the options were 2-3x more!
5.0,Love it - It's beautiful.  Looks expensive!
5.0,I bought these for my friends bachlorette party and they were a hit! I was even able to write on the sides of them.
5.0,One of the softest and comfortable sports bras I've ever had!
5.0,we used our finger lights for the 4th of july party.  all the kids loved them.  more fun than glow sticks especailly considering these can still be used the next day(s).
5.0,I like it is great
5.0,Using them for hiking the Appalachian trail<br /> Nice light weight poles
5.0,Was better than expected.
5.0,Love it. Looks great!

5.0,Great fit and quality!
5.0,Works nicely for  an option as a work ring.
5.0,Great quality...perfect size...able to bend to close the ends closer together...very pleased with it.

5.0,Fits good. Nice quality .
5.0,always get compliments when I wear these. work great
5.0,Awesome product!
5.0,"I love this bracelet.  It's much better quality, and less expensive, than my Chan Luu bracelet.  I've worn it on the beach and just with normal wear.  The strand is longer than the Chan Luu, which I like.  The product shipped quickly and looks just like the product online.  5 stars overall!"
5.0,Great quality material here and a good fit.
5.0,"Love them. Like the flowered frames, don't look old ladish!"
5.0,Beautiful! I got a lot of complements wearing it!
5.0,smaller than I thought but very nice
5.0,"Got this for my bf, it came Alot faster then I expected. I can't wait to see his face when he gets this."
5.0,My daughter used it for our Christmas road trip to Colorado. We went through Kansas where the temp was 0 with a windchill of -17. Kept her head warm and she looked cute in the process
5.0,Works perfectly!
5.0,My 12 year going to use for her Halloween costume.
5.0,Very pretty. Everyone loved it
5.0,It’s much heavier than the photo implies. It’s very warm and comfortable. I’ll be ordering other colors soon!
5.0,Since COVID started we all have to wear masks every day. I had been using disposable ones and not only were they not conformable it got expensive. I bought this six piece neck mask and couldn't be happier. They are very comfortable and durable. I love the fact that I can reuse them over and over. Excellent value for what you get. Will buy more in the future.
5.0,"I ordered these cufflinks in late Jan 2015 and they arrived about a week later. Incredible, especially considering they place an expectation that they can be upwards of a couple months for delivery. My expectations were exceeded! The cufflinks arrived exactly as marketed. They have the look of much more expensive cufflinks as well. Considering the latter, I highly recommend INBLUE Jewelry."
5.0,I absolutely love this bag! It's so pretty!!!! Arrived early! Looks great medium-sized. Looks feels sturdy. I will def buy another one!
5.0,"These earrings are great, I've worn them quite a lot since I received them. Very sturdily made, and the design is crafted very well."
5.0,Perfect hat for Christmas celebrations!
5.0,"Very easy to use and great for little hands. Makes holding juice boxes much cleaner since those little hands aren't squeezing the box and making the contents spill all over. Plus they can hold on with both hands, too. Easy to clean and store for the next use."
5.0,Carries everything for travel
5.0,Didn't last long but totally cute.
5.0,Product is exactly as described.  Nice cable knitting and thickness with fleece lining.  Good fluffy faux fur Pom Poms.
5.0,Amazing Shoes
5.0,Kids liked them
5.0,perfect look for inconspicuous... too bad i dont wear em anymore... gave em too my daughters... they look great on them!
5.0,"I use this strap on two heavy DSLRs, it works great.  Plus the bottom plate is a standard ARCA tripod plate, allowing quick on and off without unscrewing anything.  It takes a few minutes to install and adjust it to your hand, but then it protects from drops if your fingers relax a bit; the strap holds the camera snugly."
5.0,Beautiful just like the flag!!!!!
5.0,love this earrings.  very very pretty
5.0,I bought two for Oktoberfest in Munich and they fit and look great!
5.0,I love it!!  It’s very nice!
5.0,"Nice addition to my draw collection, lol has a nice look thanks"
5.0,"Not overly long, it is warm, feels good on skin. Does the job of keeping wind from getting into coat."
5.0,"These gloves work well in New Mexico as we don't experience harsh winters.  My son enjoys them and he commented they work well to access his phone. I used to live in Montana and they would not work well in those cold, cold temperatures.  Excellent for mild winters.  Well constructed and attractive as well."
5.0,These shorts are well made and fit my guy perfectly. The fabric is more nylon-like than the description. Perhaps the description should be edited.
5.0,"This is perfect! My daughter is 2 1/2 and tall for her age- thas is a little baggy on her, but I like that. She cannot keep a blanket at all, and I was looking for something similar to the sleep sacs she wore as a baby. She can walk around in this in the morning and it doesn’t impede her at all for sleep. With long sleeve PJs this keeps her warm when she kicks of her blankets in the night."
5.0,This is perfect! Great color!
5.0,This is a wonderful everyday/dressy band!  It fits my 6.5 in wrist perfectly.  I am very impressed with the quality of the band as well.
5.0,I wear size 4 and a large skirt fit me just perfect.
5.0,Great Product Great Seller
5.0,My daughter loves it. It's true to size too.
5.0,Fit my daughter perfectly. The crown is a little wierd but we attached it to a headband. Real fabric and made to last.
5.0,"My son likes this bracelet very much,he is happy))"
5.0,This dress is so pretty and super comfortable! It’s very casual and is perfect for a sunny day. The material is nice and soft and is not see through. It’s definitly worth the price!
5.0,Using as a base layer on the colder nights for running.
5.0,"Oh my word! I LOVE this bag. I was super hesitant at first because there weren't many reviews, and I've been carrying a different bag for probably over 5 years that broke recently. When the package arrived, I was unsure whether I liked it at first. I thought that the way it closes was not made properly. It is velcro, and I was nervous that the velcro would wear out too soon, and I would have to buy a new bag because the way it closes was cheaply done. It turns out that I really like the velcro. It works perfectly. The way that they positioned the two pieces means that I can just drop the flap and it fastens on its own.<br /><br />There are multiple pockets. I fit my mini-sketch book, phone, voice recorder, usp, wallet, extra cash, feminine items, pens, mints, and chapsticks all comfortably in this purse with room to spare and no excessive bulging. It also has a zipper that lets the purse expand. I just love it! I would buy from them again."
5.0,Really like these pants.
5.0,These earring are great. I bought my mother a pair for Christmas and she loves them. They look beautiful and are nearly indistinguishable from natural diamond. Huge bang for your buck.
5.0,Super cute earrings at a great price!
5.0,Nice dress super comfy and nice enough for work.  Love it.
5.0,Unfortunately to to be pandemic my order was delayed by sometime which in turn causing me to need a dress from another place for my event so I figured I would return I said dress that have not been delivered but ladies once I saw this dress and I had to try it on I fell in Love it fit exactly how it was supposed to the fabric is the perfect blend of cotton not too heavy not too light it's not flimsy the spaghetti straps are adjustable so your cup size can small I did wear a tank top underneath because no cleavage I did not want my bra to show I know next time to just grab a safety pin instead of a tank top and come on ladies it's got pockets a dress with pockets I'll pay extra!
5.0,"Love this watch.. the watch is pretty large and the display is large enough to read without glasses and its pretty simple to set up and use.  I bought it because my regular watch was getting a new battery and pressure tested so I needed something.  I purchased it when I had to have the battery on my Tag replaced and have hardly taken it off since i got it.. its so light I even sleep with it on.  I use the built in chrono to time certain workouts..great value for the price, great purchase."
5.0,"My daughter got these for her fairy halloween costume and they were so cute and worked out perfectly. could be a little tighter but I'm sure because of her little ears, hers were falling off a bit more. still very cute and nice they come with 2 pairs!"
5.0,"Fabric is thin, but the shirts are nice for an under layer."
5.0,"Received as a Christmas gift.  The band is a bit stiffer than the original Fitbit band.  However, it’s not uncomfortable and will probably loosen up over time.  I love the pattern.  Overall,  I’m happy with the band."
5.0,Adjustable. Everything I expected.
5.0,I was a little worried seeing mixed reviews “the quality is bad” “designs are faded” but I’m so happy I decided to take a chance and buy it. Designs are not faded. The material is GREAT! Shirt fit as expected. Super cute shirts! Thank you!
5.0,Great for outdoor job
5.0,Perfect quality
5.0,"Very cute, comfy shirt with a great message! Pretty light purple color. I sized up to XL (normally wear L) so it’s a tiny bit big. I would say it’s true to size. For reference I’m 5’8, 165 lb, 36DD. Recommend!"
5.0,"I read the first review which talked about having problems with the hinge. I trusted my gut instinct and bought it and am glad, I did.<br />I love the chain which is top of the line in a quality piece and the pendant is heavy. I have no problems with it staying closed.<br />I'm going to order another one while they are still avaiable.<br />Top of the line time piece."
5.0,I used these on my fifth wheel hitch pins as a easy visual reminder of whether I remembered to lock everything properly. It's a great tool for when you're in a hurry. The bright color is easy to see when glancing in the truck bed. It's worth the few dollars to help keep your truck bed safe from dropping your trailer. I even gave some to my dad for the same purpose.
5.0,Perfect board bag for my new board.  Love Dakine products. Best price anywhere!
5.0,3 different size balls. Silver Stamped on earring back. Love the little travel bag!
5.0,My girlfriend says that this bag does the job perfectly.
5.0,Got this pendant for my husband. I was happy with the size and it's a perfect fit for his necklace.
5.0,Can't wait to use it for my fall/winter purse
5.0,"A solid horn that allows for minimal crouching.  I initially bought it to accompany a new pair of wellies, but I often find myself using it to throw on even a pair of loafers.  I’m 186cm tall and it’s quite comfortable to use."
5.0,"Warm and the 5X version fits great! Love wearing it open over other shirts. Color is bright and true to the photo, very soft too!"
5.0,Very beautiful and professional.
5.0,"Leather was very soft, size was true."
5.0,This was the perfect charm for my neighbor.  It looks just like Rex her little dog and she loves the bracelet I gave her.
5.0,"You can never go wrong with isotoner gloves. They fit great and are very warm. As long as I don’t lose them, they will be perfect all winter!"
5.0,Honestly these are great. The box in a nice touch. Perfect for children or that old pokemon enthusiast.
5.0,best hat all year
5.0,It was fit and beautiful. Where i go people say that its really beautiful.
5.0,"Fits great, light weight but densely woven"
5.0,awesome..I love the fit and the fabric so much.
5.0,Excellent fit well built
5.0,Bought it for 8 year old daughter for school and she loves it. It is super cute.
5.0,a great belt..i was always a tweener.....in between sizes...not any more....thanks
5.0,Love these Earrings they are my favorite so
5.0,"The Dirndl is exactly as described.  Just mind not ironing over the self adhesive underlayment for the embroidery.  You will end up with a sticky mess on the iron.  This is often removed around the embroidery, however it was not in this case.<br />The sizing is EU 38/ US 8.  We could have bought a size smaller."
5.0,Bought for my son
5.0,perfect great quality
5.0,For looks only! I sewed mine onto a regular mask.
5.0,Makes tight collars and cuffs usable again. Great invention.
5.0,"So far it works perfectly. I cant wait to use it combined with a halloween costume I am using it for. Easy strap on, nice LED lights."
5.0,looks good  and fits my child well
5.0,These earrings are cute  I got them to wear to work because I work in the healthcare field so I wear a cap and a mask now and all that show are my ears and eyes. I wanted something cheery and these are just right. They are small but bright and hypoallergenic for my sensitive ears
5.0,"Very nice watch for the money. I like the sweeping second hand. This is my first automatic watch and I learned that if you don't wear it every day, the watch stops. Be prepared to buy an automatic watch winder if this is your case."
5.0,I love these pants! They are extremely comfortable to workout and lounge in. They fit as expected and I just had a baby so the high waist band is perfect at concealing the extra fluff. I plan on buying another pair or two!
5.0,Cute and well made top!
5.0,Comfortable and great quality
5.0,"This item was perfect, looked great and for great too."
5.0,My wife uses everyday
5.0,Beautiful design and well made. We are very happy with this product. Fast delivery.
5.0,Beautiful for my daughter's Belle costume.  Fits perfectly on my 40&#34; girl.  Great quality and it came with a white ribbon and feather hair clip!
5.0,"Good sunglasses. They don't look cheap, and super comfortable to wear."
5.0,I originally ordered 2 dresses but they are so soft and comfortable and fit so well that I ordered another! I can dress them up with accents or just wear around the house and be comfy. I’m 5’2” and kinda have a big bust and the medium fits great on me.
5.0,Beautiful but really really long. I’m 5’6 and 135lbs. Gorgeous design though I may end up cutting some off considering I will only be wearing on vacation.
5.0,great delivery
5.0,Otherwise very comfortable
5.0,I really like these earrings. They go in easy and look nice.
5.0,"Came on time, just a few days. I bought 2 of these. So far they are great. I'm 5'4&#34; and 127 lbs. I usually wear a Med. but bought Lg after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad I did, they fit great. I like the neckline in that it's not to high or low."
5.0,Love these!  Girls look so cute wearing them with their softball uniforms!  Very pleased!  I loved that these were attached to ponytail holders instead of a clip.  Great buy!
5.0,"Very soft, washes great, colors are very vibrant."
5.0,My son has SPD and he loves this compression set! I purchased both the shirt and pants in blue and he wears it often.
5.0,My 6 month old great nice looked good and protected on the beach. not like the fake children's glasses. Protect those pretty little blue eye.
5.0,"This looks exactly as pictured,...I wasn't sure if it would cuz you never know! Especially when different sizes can look different on different people.<br />I bought this as my postpartum bikini,...I wanted something that still looked like a bikini, with some coverage where you want it, but flattering and sporty. This hits the mark! I'm actually surprised there's not more designs out there similar to this one as it is a very flattering tankini design.<br />I'm more of an hourglass figure so the band of the black mesh actually seemed to more naturally sit at my waist, which offers an alternate look, blouson style. And still looks great at my hips as well. Definitely recommend!!"
5.0,I'm told they are loved ! ( a gift . )
5.0,We ordered these for a friend who lost his work shoes in a fire.  He says they are too nice for work!
5.0,IT WAS A GIFT AND HE LOVES IT
5.0,"I think the price is hard to beat -- What I bought was a cheap automatic that I could wear to the pool, to swim.It's a really nice watch -- it looks smart, and it's a nice size.I am used to working every day.You need to resize it because the straps are huge when unpacked.I'm very satisfied. It's a good choice."
5.0,This is really cute - the teal Is a great color.  Might get a second one and size down in a different color.<br /><br />It could be worn as shown or with a belt.  Fabric is substantial but not heavy.
5.0,I saw these sold out elsewhere and had to have y them.<br />They look great<br />No odor<br />The zipper is fragile will have to replace<br />Glad I ordered the largest size they had or I would not be able to fit it<br />Definitely size up
5.0,"This backpack is gnarly. Tons of room, the insides feel sleek and luxurious. Purchased at the North Face store in Chicago but felt compelled to review it here. Out of all their backpacks and bags, the Kabig was by far the coolest looking, best overall bag for my needs. I travel a lot and sometimes take two or three day side trips and don't want to lug my suitcase around and this is perfect for my needs. I rolled up a weeks worth of clothes and toiletries and a pair of sandals and still had some room to spare. If you're in the market for the most bad ass bag on the market, you found it. Plus North Face has a lifetime guarantee to make you feel good about forking up the premium price tag on this bag. Highly recommend this bag"
5.0,Quick delivery. Bag as  described!
5.0,MY HUSBAND PURCHASED THESE & HASN'T TAKEN THEM OFF SINCE HE GOT THEM. HE SAYS THEY FIT PERFECT & LOVES THAT THE BEIGE STRIP ON THE SHOE IS RUBBER & NOT LIKE A TYPICAL FOAM SOLE. THIS IS PROBABLY THE 4TH PAIR OF &#34;WATERPROOF&#34; SHOES HE HAS PURCHASED & SO FAR HIS FEET ARE DRY AS THE DESERT!
5.0,"Super cute and easy to put in, I've received a lot of compliments on it since I started wearing it. After weeks of nonstop wear, there has been no discoloration or anything ucky with this piercing. Unlike a few other reviews, mine was received perfectly straight and it hasn't came loose during wear for me yet -- and I even sleep in it."
5.0,"It is beautiful the best I've seen since hubby died, I'm proud and happy and it will always shine because it's stainless steel"
5.0,I love how rich the pink is. The fit is great and they're comfortable. I plan on wearing them with this fall my pink plaid shaket.
5.0,They fit my Serengheti frames just right...
5.0,love it just wrong size
5.0,Perfect to be completely honest. Perfect size. The ankh itself is quite durable. The string however is quite small but it is possible to fit over the head. I don't take mine off for any reason and there is no damage in the shower. But for those who wish to remove it on and off maybe find it tedious.
5.0,"I am happy I stepped away from the traditional bifold wallet. The Atziloose carbon fiber slim wallet is all one really needs. I can fit 8 cards PLUS cash (6 bills, comfortably).<br /><br />The design is simple and I like it more than other slim wallets I shopped around for. As advertised, the edges are smooth and the shape of the wallet is conducive for easy access to chip readers.The carbon fiber is a nice touch. When I was getting used to the Atziloose I kept thinking I had my misplaced my (other) wallet."
5.0,"I really like it, it's very nice product. It's  just like in the Pictures"
5.0,So cute and well made! It was the perfect kit for my outfit for spirit week! And you can’t bear the price!
5.0,"Gorgeous bag!  A bit smaller than I am used to with my D&B, but it's very supple and a rich color that will be great will my fall wardrobe.  Packaged very well.  Came promptly."
5.0,Just as described... quality is great! My son is going to love it!!!
5.0,Cool watch.
5.0,"My new favorite yoga top! I'm a size 20, 40D and finally have found a top that is flattering and functional. XXL fits perfect!"
5.0,"I love the way this fits and the way it hangs.  Can be worn with dresses, slacks, and jeans."
5.0,Love it! Fits beautifully!
5.0,"Fits great, cute, and comfortable."
5.0,"Absolutely love it!!! Very stylish, loose, and comfortable!"

5.0,Love these they are so soft! I'm a 22/24 and they fit great!
5.0,Super cute and perfect fit.
5.0,"Honestly, I was skeptical about this watch because of the price but I was overwhelmed with the quality. Usually you get what you pay for, but this watch is heavy duty, timeless and classic! Will be ordering one again for a friend of mine who wants one!"
5.0,"I had to return because I guess I’m built like an Ewock with big boobs, but this dress is stunning. If I thought I could reasonably alter it and have it look right I would have in a heartbeat. If you are built like a normal human, don’t even hesitate. The arm holes are a little on the small size as others mentioned, but not as bad as expected. That could have easily been fixed. For reference I’m 5’3”, 155lbs, and a 36DD. My torso and shoulders are where I am exceptionably short, & my natural waist is fairly high compared to most (just under bust). I found the cleavage a but revealing as well, but partially due to my size. Could easily have a modesty panel added."
5.0,"This is a great, comfortable, lightweight jacket. I wore it recently on a trip, it was perfect for the cool temperature on the airplane & also extremely handy for lots of easy access, deep pockets for keeping track of my phone, keys, etc. Definitely order down a size -- I am 5'10&#34; and over 150 lbs & usually wear a L or XL. I ordered a medium here and the fit was perfect."
5.0,Bought to hold up chainsaw for neighbors.
5.0,This is a cute set of earrings and I have had several compliments on them.  I am very sensitive to cheaper jewelry but I have been wearing for a few weeks with no issues.
5.0,Love this dress<br />Comfortable
5.0,great quality!
5.0,Beautiful bracelet.  As described.  Comfortable to wear. Love it!!
5.0,Great product for good price.
5.0,"Was hesitant at first to buy this bathing suit because I didn't see any reviews. But I am extremely happy that I did buy it! It's exactly the photo! Great quality , really pretty 🙌🏽"
5.0,"My husband loves the fit, the ability to stay dry while keeping husband dry while biking"

5.0,I bought this for concerts and it's well-made. Right size. I can't wait to use it.
5.0,Third time to order these socks!  These are not my favorite but my favorites are no longer being made.  But these are available and worth every penny if you want great thin socks!
5.0,Very nice.  Especially for the price.
5.0,Great shirt  for fall and winter. Euro sizes are a little small so go up one size and you'll be happy.
5.0,I liked the color and style looks like real outfit.
5.0,"It’s made of high quality material. The leather straps & trim look very nice. They have a good number of big, highly functional pockets. I figured it would be nice to wear as an apron in the kitchen, too, so I got 2."
5.0,"This suit is the best! came fittign me perfect, ordered a large and I am 148lbs 5 feet 8 3/4 inches tall  &#60;3 I look smashing ;)  Oh and the quality is as shown, and I am very picky.  Thanks amazon! &#60;3"
5.0,"Good quality, fast shipping."
5.0,"I just received my black skirt and I LOVE IT, I can't wait to wear it and when I do I will post my pictures 🤗 ."
5.0,Bello .
5.0,I really like the support this sports bra offers. Having the ability to adjust the comfort level using the zipper is such a plus.
5.0,"Nice, fits well, good fabric.  Attractive."
5.0,It looks really good ! Worth the price
5.0,"I work in healthcare and usually have to cover up my hair when I'm on shift. This cap is PERFECT for me. I have relaxed hair. I can easily put my hair in a low ponytail or bun, or just leave it as it and throw on this cap. The satin lining is exactly what I needed."
5.0,"I used these for a hook-toss game. They are hard plastic, very sturdy, and they can withstand some very agressive playing by my 5-year old. Great quality for the price."
5.0,"So excited for this dress, I have worn it twice this week. I am currently pregnant so looking for flowy, casual summer dresses and this is perfect. I can still wear a strapless bra with it and you can’t see the bra in the back. Love the pockets. Very happy with the purchase"
5.0,"This is a perfect robe for spring and summer, especially in the air conditioning. The fit is perfect, true to size."
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it
5.0,wanted some nice looking winter gloves and these fit the bill. not super great for extended periods (1/2 Hr +) in below freezing but for what I wanted they work fine
5.0,One of my favorite dresses. Hugs my curves in all the right places. Perfect lightweight material. I am5’4 155 lbs and this dress looks tailor made for me. Best part.... POCKETS.
5.0,"Perfect! I love the color! I use this for my keys when I go to the gym, I just clip it on my water bottle, exactly what I needed!"
5.0,A tiny bit larger than I expected but very flattering  and better than too tight. I am 5'4&#34; @150# and purchased a size XL/16
5.0,LOVE these beanies! This are so cute but yet so warm! I definitely recommend these too all women who wear beanies. I love the thick knitting. I purchased 2 more colors I cannot get enough of them!
5.0,It's really wow!!! Sexy!
5.0,I’m very sensitive to certain metals and my ears feel totally fine! I’ve showered in these and slept in these and they’re great. Will buy again once they fade.
5.0,Super soft..
5.0,Exactly what I was expecting. I'm 5'8&#34; about 190 and I'm a D cup. The top was not snug but it was not overly loose. Since it was a XXXL there was a little room around the tummy area but definitely not too much. The cut is great and the material held up well in both the pool and the Caribbean ocean while I was in Jamaica. My new favorite swimsuit.
5.0,Fit well. Just what I need.
5.0,Wow! I was shocked at how well my old silver jewelry cleaned up! I even polished my perfume bottles that have metals on them and they look great!
5.0,Bought for my daughter. She keeps asking to wear them. She loves them
5.0,Well made very stylish
5.0,the price
5.0,I’m 5”9 and 160 pounds and the medium fits great!
5.0,"After looking for the perfect hat for my husband, I found this one. It is awesome!!! Very stylish, comfortable, great for the golf course or just stepping out for a walk. Well made and at a great price."
5.0,"This sports bra is nice & silky, both inside & out. The fit is great, I'm wearing a Medium but could have maybe gone with a Small. I like how it's a sports bra, but also like a midriff tank top with a bra built in. This could even possibly be worn for swimming, although I haven't tried that because I don't know how it would hold up with chlorine, but swimming in a lake or wearing at the beach would most likely work great. It's a great top to wear for Yoga, but I might not wear it for running. It could maybe be used for that if I had gone one size down, but I was worried about it being too constricting so I got my usual size. The fit around the bottom is slightly loose like a tank top (which could just be how it fits on me), but the bra part works great to hold everything in. The material is soft & silky as stated previously, & is very nice against the skin. Honestly though, my girls thank me for it! It is like a swimsuit material so it's stretchy & fitting as a sports bra should be. The inside that doesn't touch the skin is a breathable mesh material to help keep you cool. I've included pictures of front, back & inside so you can see what I'm talking about. It could be worn as an addition to a summer outfit, or alone with some cute leggings. It comes with padding inserts, so it can be worn with them or they can easily be removed by the slits in the inside. The straps are quite unique & are an extra cute addition, with one single strap on one side, & a double spaghetti strap on the other. I found them to be comfortable & a great fit, not overly tight nor too loose, which is why I stated it would be better for yoga than heavy exercise such as running. The elastic on the bottom of the bra feels durable & is able to hold up my girls comfortably. I don't know about shrinkage during washing, although I suspect that it won't due to the material it's made of, but I recommend following laundering instructions, washing in a delicates bag, or handwashing, then laying out to air dry. I'm happy to have added this to my collection, & believe me, I have a collection of sports bras! It can be tiring trying to find that perfect one that will look cute & be functional. I absolutely recommend this one."
5.0,The shirt is incredibly soft and fits exactly how I expected it would. I am definitely looking forward to layering this shirt with sweaters and such; it makes a very nice base layer. Definitely worth getting!
5.0,I have enjoyed wearing this new ring. My friends have remarked how nice it looks. I am glad I purchased this ring. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0,I ordered this for my brother in law as Pabst is our go to for our camping trips and this hoodie is absolutely perfect! I will now be getting one for my sister and I as well:)
5.0,"My granddaughter loves this and it fits great!  It's nice and thick, and the strawberry is colorful.  Would buy this again and recommend this to friends."
5.0,Fits well and wicks well too. I guessed on my size and its not too long or too loose anywhere
5.0,Great shoes for the water park 😊
5.0,It's always a gamble buying cheap sunglasses off of Amazon (for free shipping :) these are cool.
5.0,"I was looking for some really nice, comfortable sandals to be able to wear around for the summer and this was just perfect.  It matches with most of what I wear and it is very nice. They are truly light weight, I just love these sandals."
5.0,I absolutely loved the quality of this hat and so did my guy.  The hat was as described and the colors were amazing and vibrant. The hat looked like it cost more than what I paid for.  I would definitely purchase more merchandise from this seller.
5.0,"beautiful dress, fit perfect."
5.0,Tall girl approved. I’m 5’9 165 lbs. I got a size large. Next time I’ll size up. Super cute though just cheaper quality.
5.0,"It has a nice and attractive design, the construction materials I can tell you that they are of good quality, really yes. If you want a watch with a unique design to stand out and use it for any occasion you can buy it without any fear.<br /><br />I am more than satisfied with my purchase, incredible price and quality."
5.0,"credit card, ID, cash & checkbook"
5.0,"Writing this review late. I bought this hoodie for my son for Christmas, of 2020. He loved it!! He tried it on right away. He’s 5”8 & weighs about 170lbs. Ordered in a size Xl. I thought I posted photos as I always leave reviews on Amazon with pics, and when I came back on Amazon to order one for my 13yr. Old, I noticed I hadn’t, and neither did anyone else. Reviews with photos is EVERYTHING! Fits a little loose like he likes it to fit. He usually wears a size Medium or Large in regular hoodies like Champion or Nike. So ordered this bigger (size Xl) just in case, and it fit nice! Kind of a shiny material. Very soft too. Hope this helps you to order this nice, “One piece” hood for someone who loves this Anime.  Great Christmas gift, Birthday, Father’s Day, or any day for that matter!  This is my honest review. I Didn’t get paid to write this. Also, forgot to mention, my Son received lots of compliments when he wore it out. He was surprised that so many people knew who Luffy was 😂<br />Have a blessed day!"
5.0,"Fits accordingly, perfect for my 6 yr old and will last a year or 2!!!  Well worth the money and not cheaply made!"

5.0,"My favorite bra, it's comfortable & pretty. I ordered a black one after I received the light pink one."
5.0,Great quality! Worth the price!
5.0,Ended up fitting my body well. 5’2” 140 pounds 34D bra. The top was a tad big and I probably would have put a small stitch in it because I don’t like showing a lot of cleavage. Material seemed ok and dress could be easily dressed up if needed
5.0,I love hoodies and this is very comfortable and fits well.  I haven't sent it through the was yet and will update this review if it has poor effects of the fabric
5.0,"Very stylish, belts! Fits perfectly easy to match! Highly recommended."

5.0,Love my shirt.
5.0,Very nicely made and fit true to size!
5.0,I purchased two different types snd both were super cute. The sizing is Asian sizing so definitely size up 1or 2 sizes. For reference I am size 4/6 27 inch waist in jeans and 34D size M top. I got a L in both and they fit me just like the model picture. Loose and little oversized. Quality was very nice and I will probably get another set.
5.0,Nice looking silver Tardis - perfect on pandora style charm bracelet.
5.0,The tutu fits well and made well.  Purchased for my 12 year old and came with adjustable waist.  The quality is much better than ones purchased in past.  She has worn it to school several times now and holds up very well.  The thickness of the tule is wonderful!  I would spend the extra few bucks and buy this one.
5.0,I bought this pant from Under Armour in graphite. I bought it to wear in the yard. It's a relaxed fit but not too big. I bought it in a large. I love the zippers on the leg's bottom because it will protect me from ticks. It is such a great looking pant that I bought another in black. You could definitely wear these pants for everyday. The photo doesn't do it justice.
5.0,These were a gift to my aunt. She absolutely loves them! She works in an office and receive several compliments every time she wear them.
5.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my cousin and she absolutely loved it. The pin was durable enough that she has it on her school backpack.

5.0,"Perfect, used for a corsage. It's very heavy though"
5.0,"They are so comfy, stretchy and fit. But it doesnt have the men's genital slot when using the restroom and we have to take the pants off. I'm sorry for this review but it is the truth cuz this part is so important seriously."
5.0,These pants are so cute! I agonised over getting them because I tend to not like buying bottoms online but the fit perfect and true to size if a bit big! I got the small and I am 5 foot and 108lbs. They are normal non cropped pants on me at that height.<br /><br />They are soooo soft and cute I wore them immediately the next day from buying them and have gotten so many compliments! I’m thinking about buying another pair just to make sure I always have them.<br /><br />Plus they arrived super quick.
5.0,Wife loved them !
5.0,Gloves worked out great.
5.0,This wig is much better looking than the image provided. The texture is smooth and falls nicely once you have brushed it out a little. Fit comfortably too if you wear it with the right wig cap.

They hold extremely well, I use them for my every day, including sleeping, and bathing. You will NOT regret this!<br /><br />Over a Year Later and these are still great!!

5.0,Great fit... received so many compliments at the monster truck jam
5.0,Bought to go with a victorian dress and it's great! 😊
5.0,So when I bought this I didn't know it was gonna be a international package and some people said it would take a month and so did Amazon but in reality I just got my package and I'm in love with my Marilyn Monroe scarf its gorgeous and it actually took one week to get here instead 1 or 2 months like it said. Overall I'm satisfied with this product and will be buying again soon. ;) two thumbs up

5.0,Pretty cool little bike buddy.
5.0,First adjustable belt I have had since I was a kid; quality and ease of use is far superior to what I remember.<br />I'm really skinny so it is not easy for me to find a belt which would not require trimming and hole-poking.<br />This product met my needs perfectly and the price is totally reasonable.

5.0,Great support and neutral palate. Versatile for all outfits
5.0,Very cool momentos.  Love the fact that these exist!
5.0,So far the watch has been great!  I have to add that the kit to work on the watch band (removing and adding links) has been great to work with.  I can use the kit on a number of watch bands I have already.  Well worth the cost.  Watch band looks great as well.
5.0,"My husband loves this cap!!!  It fits great, has vibrant color and has held up well."
5.0,"Love this Polka dot skirt I also have the red and black plaid. . The fabric is perfect. Wish you would get more in prints with the same fabric. I ordered the black and it was a totally different ,fabric (heavy knit)and it did not fit.(plus it was more expensive)"

5.0,"They seem great. I'm a size 13 and the large fit perfectly. I'll be putting them to the test next month, but just a trial and I can feel some compression. They aren't nearly as restrictive as I thought and didn't feel like they'd get too hot, but I wasn't working or in them for too long."
5.0,Its  a beautiful  purse .The color  is a beautiful navy blue.

5.0,They fit my small face and I love that they came with a case.
5.0,My favorite coat.  Looks hand-taylored.  Love the color!
5.0,"The cheetah style is very cute and serves it’s purpose. However, the fabric is not that soft, reminds me of the cheap rough fabrics you can find at craft stores. And the sweat band is not that high quality.<br /><br />BUT the black one that says “love” on it… LOVE IT! The fabric on this one is MUCH better and the sweatband is super soft. Also, when I received the black one it had a cute packaging with a note which was a nice touch.<br /><br />Not sure why they were shipped in separate packaging and only one had the whole “small business” cute detail to it… but overall very stylish and like I said, it will do the job just fine!"
5.0,like just what I wanted
5.0,The person we gave them to as a gift loves socks. She was so excited since she is getting married in January

5.0,Real good and feet’s well.

5.0,"This outfit is adorable, but I wish I found it in pink!"
5.0,Bought these for my son. He likes his athletic pants to have the tapered legs/jogger style so these were perfect. They aren't tight as he can wear these over a pair of shorts. He liked them so much we got them in black as well.
5.0,Excellent product that works far better than the normal pin back that originally comes with the pin.  Does not come unlocked.
5.0,These are beautiful I no my daughters  will love them
5.0,These are awesome. The material is a mix between legging and wind breaker feeling. They are really flattering and so comfortable. I already ordered another pair in a different color!
5.0,"I like the removable pads for these bras so you don't have to worry about showing your ""headlights"" in public. I just use the bras when I go on walks. I'm a 38D and these fit great!"
5.0,"So, my whole life I have had this love-hate relationship with belts. They have always been a necessity; however, I could never get the belt tightened just right which led to awkward abdominal pain throughout my day. Well, no more!<br /><br />This belt not only is the best looking belt I have ever seen, but it is also the most comfortable. Easy to use with no fuss. Also, if your life is ever in danger and you need something to hold on to while you cross a great distance via zip line cable thing, this belt is perfect! I think it can support well over what any person weighs.<br /><br />Want a belt that looks awesome, feels awesome, and could potentially save your life under the right circumstances? Well, here you go. Enjoy."
5.0,"Look & feel nice.  Stronger  than most I've used. Used  them for bracelets & key chains. One for bracelet for one of my granddaughters that I say I love you to the sun & back, love  you to the moon & back & love you to the stars & back. So these were perfect. Have a nice selection with only a few duplicates of some."
5.0,"Do not go with other reviews!! Buy dress true to size, I listened to previous reviews and got a size larger and had to order a different one in my size. I am 5'4'' and and am 130lbs. 38C chest and medium fits great!"
5.0,"Ordered a pair for my step daughter, shoes worked awesome for about week. Had trouble with one of them not lighting or charging properly, the seller contacted me after reading my first review and offered to send a new pair at no extra cost. Great customer service and the shoes are nice in shape and quality. Fit alittle big, but with kids that is no problem..room to grow!"
5.0,Fit nice and now I look cool in front of my friends. Everything was as expected.
5.0,These are very affordable dresses.  Perfect length to wear with leggings or alone as a dress.  Good quality.
5.0,My daughter’s favorite style and type of dress. She can put it on and take it off all by herself. She loves the material and the cut. Perfect twirling dress.
5.0,Super comfortable. I bought these and satin bed sheets so I could run and slide across my bed. 10/10 would buy again.
5.0,The card slots are a little snug. I bought this thinking it was a card holder style but it’s not quite that. It has two halves that snap together. One half has the sticky adhesive that you can attach to a phone. So I just keep the other half in my pocket and didn’t use the sticker half. Over all nice wallet.
5.0,Exactly what it said. Arrived on time.
5.0,Exactly what I expected and the right size.  Appreciate that it has no logo on the shirt as required for my job.  Way cheaper than anywhere else yet still top notch quality.
5.0,Very comfortable and good quality
5.0,Comfy and cute😊
5.0,"These boots have barely come off our 19 mo old granddaughters feet since she got them. Mom says they are wearing g and washing well under Pacific Northwest rain and puddle conditions, too."

5.0,"really great shoes, so comfortable, I'm glad I ordered them."
5.0,"I was looking for a nice toiletries travel bag that didn't look to feminine and this bag suits the bill perfectly. It has big compartments to hold everything I need when I travel. the material is waterproof and very stylish looking. Quite frankly, this is the best travel bag I've found that has the amount of room I needed. I've had others and they always seem to be lacking something... This one is not lacking anything at all. Highly recommended! :)"
5.0,"I accidentally lost my previous plain black case that I've had since getting my glasses which was -say 2011.  As a person who usually only requires glasses when in class, I always kept glasses in cases for protection, so when I lost it,  I was disappointed, but soon I saw this on amazon and instantly liked it. It had nice styles that fit me and it provided a cleaning wipe for your glasses which I love! I received it on time and it came just like I thought it would look and I absolutely love it! It is just what you need if you need a glasses case . Really recommend."
5.0,"Love the product, best of it ever. I would definitely recommend it."
5.0,This was so cute and the material was good.
5.0,"My dogs play really rough and keep ripping each others tags off, so I bought these strong ones. They've held up for the last 2 months, so they're doing a pretty good job, unlike the others."
5.0,recipient loved it
5.0,Love the quality. Happy with this purchase.
5.0,Very comfortable.  Might be my favorite pair of sandals I've owned
5.0,The little pom poms set these off from similar style ones.  She actually left them on for a stroll around the room to try them out.
5.0,"This is a beautiful pendant, Mickey is gorgeous and sparkles brightly.  Wore it on a Disney cruise and three different passengers asked me if I purchased it on board.  It says &#34;Gift for Girls&#34; and I guess I qualify, even if I am in my 70's!  But it is not for little girls, unless you are saving it for when they are old enough to appreciate such a beautiful piece of jewelry."
5.0,"So cute and comfortable. I have baby sized wrists and it fits great. Got it to wear to work, but I’ll probably wear it all the time!"
5.0,"I love the size of this bag. I hate carrying things in my hands while I walk through the city. This bag is perfect for bring my kindle, a light jacket, and a small umbrella. I can also throw my lunch in there too. I love the military look too. When I commute, I easily slide the bag to my chest, and while I'm walking slide the bag to my back.<br /><br />This bag is a Godsend."
5.0,Gorgeous dress! ❤️
5.0,Nicest ring we have ordered. Excellent quality absolutely beautiful
5.0,"Love this dress! It’s a little tight in the chest and belly area, but otherwise it’s a great dress! I recommend maybe getting one size above what you think you normally are."
5.0,Nice sleep shirt
5.0,Love it!!!!  Nice fit.
5.0,Bought 6 packs.
5.0,"I almost didn't order this, but I am SO glad I did!  I love that the crop is lower than others, it covers my rib-roll and crease.  This is so flattering for a square body type and mom-figure.  My body isn't perfect, but I love what this suit does for me compared to other suits.  I am 5'6&#34; 140 36D with a long torso.  Hope this helps you decide!  I really don't think you'd be disappointed to try this one.  The bottoms are orange stripe, I thought it was more salmon/peach.  Still, super cute and I love the fit, it is very comfortable.<br /><br />As for the straps in the back, I recommend you keep it loosely tied in a bow before putting it on and then tighten it up to fit properly, that way it doesn't come all un-threaded by the time you have it on."
5.0,Really cute fashion statement.  Slightly big on my tiny wrist however the hook and  chain links make it possibly to tighten
5.0,"Like the other two Liverpool jean jackets I've acquired (different colors and slightly different styles), this one fits beautifully. I am 5'7"", 115 lbs, short-waisted; I have an average bosom, fairly broad shoulders, and fairly long arms: the Small fits me ideally. I can wear a shirt underneath it without creating any bulk, but it also looks nice with just a thin t-shirt. This jacket is summer-ish in color and style (especially with the eyelet feature), but warning: it is just as heavy as the Liverpool classic denim in dark blue: it is substantial. If you are looking for a lightweight garment, you will be disappointed. This jacket will fit the bill when one wants some heft and warmth while sporting a spring- or summer-like outfit. I recommend it above all for its flattering shape and drape.<br /><br />It hangs out well and does not tend to wrinkle. I can't speak to laundering as I haven't washed it yet."
5.0,It was ok but next time I have to get a large sizs
5.0,"Love all the different colors, good price."
5.0,"Very comfortable one size sweater! I love the scoop bottom hem, it gives the illusion of curves. It's very cozy and this is the perfect color for the fall. The collar lays very flat, no worry about bacon neck. It's not too thin and not too thick."
5.0,I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old to dress up as Lilo and Stitch for Halloween. The skirt has Velcro so you can make it small and bigger which makes it work for all sizes.
5.0,"First let me say, I am a fan of the Louis Pelle line of leather wallets and have several of their credit card cases and coin purses. Their leather goods are deeply dyed, thick, soft, and the construction has been flawless in every wallet I received. This Louis Pelle Genuine Leather Slim Minimalist Front Pocket RFID Blocking Wallet is no exception. The slots hold my credit cards and ID securely, and I like that it is a bifold style with ample space to hold my cash securely.  It can be used for business cards as well. It's small enough to fit into my tiny purse and or the pocket of my jeans. The fact that it offers RFID protection is a bonus! I am sure I will get many years of enjoyment from this wallet, and I highly recommend it."
5.0,"it is a nice bright purple, cozy sweatshirt..the color is as shown..fit is true to size..quality is also good.."
5.0,"I really love this bag. I've received more compliments on it in the year I've had it than I've ever had for any other bag I've owned (designer too) combined! People love this thing!<br /><br />I used it every day to carry my tablet, phone, keys, 2 makeup bags, wallet, and a business card wallet. I literally used it every day and after about 14 months the hardware holding the canvas strap broke as I slinged it into the passenger seat of my car. Mind you...this thing was heavy so i was honestly surprised it lasted that long. It is really well made and makes such a great statement! I'll be buying another today!"
5.0,"This dress is great and the price point is fabulous! Fabric is a bit satiny, which was unexpected but fun given the print and theme."
5.0,The leather quality it’s great.
5.0,La falda y la blusa de buena calidad
5.0,Love it..it match with my ring and necklace. .it's perfect set of jewelry..love it...
5.0,Has held up well and is perfect for my 2 year old with room to grow
5.0,My daughter is only 2 years old and I order for 5 and  fit her as excepted it runs small  I did my order on previous reviews
5.0,Great product. Items arrived in condition described and within the timeframe for delivery
5.0,Really like the shirt.
5.0,Just as expected from silver forest
5.0,Bought this for my nephew for Christmas! He loves it and wears in regularly the only thing is it doesn't have some of the newer characters which I knew when I bought it so it didn't bother me and didn't bother my nephew either. Awesome hat.
5.0,very beautiful and design too
5.0,"Arrived quickly, great quality. Was surprised at how much lighter it made the watch feel."
5.0,"I love these pants, they're nice and stretchy and fall beautifully!  I always get compliments when I wear them!"
5.0,Good quality esecially at the price point.
5.0,Very pretty. Lightweight but sturdy.
5.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves soft flannel gowns and her were starting to wear thin. It was the size as advertised, arrived three days ahead of projected schedule and she adores the feel. Nice thickness and well made. My wife spotted the charge on our card as it showed Vermont Teddy Bear so it was a real surprise when she opened it. She'll definitely buy more."
5.0,I was completely pleased with this item; it was a lot of product for the price. Quality was good and sizing was perfect (fit a small-size adult).
5.0,"These are the best work jeans I have ever owned.  I have worked in manual labor for 15 years now ask have tried them all.  I never used to buy the ladies Carhartt jeans because I hated the way they fit: a mile high rise and very unflattering shape to the waist.<br /><br />However a few weeks ago I saw the new Carhartt style at a store, the Jasper.  Both original fit and the relaxed. Really liked them both, was impressed by the new stretchier material and fit, so I got them.  Now I wish I could return them and just get like 5 pairs of these.  They are so comfortable, and more flattering than the Jaspers. I am 5'0, 115 lbs and have an athletic build with narrow hips and not a super-teeny waist in relation to hips, so not sure if that's why the fit seems better or hangs better than the Jaspers, which make me look stumpier than these.<br /><br />Not to mention I have been looking for the perfect carpenter pants for women for so many years now, no company ever made a very flattering cut before.  These are perfect.  The rise isn't as low as the jeans i usually wear not at work, but they are still below my belly button and low enough I don't feel frumpy, but high enough I know I'm not cracking out when I'm bending over all day long.  Great stretchy material, light, but it's my experience that it being stretchy helps it be more durable and less susceptible to rips.  (At least based on all the other types of jeans and their materials I've worn to work).<br /><br />These jeans are perfect.  Did I already say that?"
5.0,Perfect little gift to add to my wedding party favors! They all loved wearing them for photos!
5.0,Wore this for a bridesmaid dress that I couldn’t wear a normal bra. I’m a DD and this gave me all the support I needed!
5.0,"Clean and fashionable! Light and durable, love these things!"
5.0,Hat is a great fit. I love that it folds up and unfolds retaining its shape!
5.0,I love them I love the color they look good. The elastic on the back makes it really easy to adjust.
5.0,Very pretty if paired up with the right bottom.  Can be dressed up or down.  Have coverage in all the right places.
5.0,Looks very nice on my bracelet
5.0,Bought this hat as a gift for my brother & he loved it!!<br />got it right on time for his birthday!
5.0,"These studs are a better quality than I expected. The colors are nice, I've worn them for a couple months now and they have not tarnished at all. most important they have not caused any reaction in my skin, it's very hard to find inexpensive earrings that don't make my ears break out. I would purchase these earrings again."
5.0,Great product. Bought as a groomsmen gift and am pleased with it. Shipping took some time but was expected coming from overseas.
5.0,This was bought as a gift for a friend who loves penguins and she was very happy with it.  A nice silver pendant for the price.
5.0,Easy to use and better quaility than the ones that c9me with the grillz. Highly recommend if you have grillz.
5.0,I love these but had to send them back because they were too small.
5.0,"This ring is great.  I was looking for a ring that stood out when I was getting married last year and came across this one at a jeweler.  Problem is, it was over 400 dollars there which combined with the price of my wife's ring, would have been a lot.  Decided I would look on Amazon to see what they have and found the same one that was $400 at the store here for around $20.  I couldn't believe it.  Thought maybe it was a joke or some kind of ripoff but after reading the reviews, I felt confident enough to spend the money and order it.  It wasn't too high of a risk for the cost and I could always return it if I didn't like the quality.  I received it and realized it was the same ring that I was looking at in the stores for 5% of the cost.  The size I picked was a little too big so I exchanged it easily through Amazon's site.  The quality is great and I can't believe that jewelers are charging that much for something that could be found for so cheap somewhere else.  They have a huge scam going on with men's rings that do not have diamonds.  I found a lot of the rings from the store were online for a lot cheaper so I am glad I looked here before wasting my money elsewhere.<br /><br />For the ring itself, I really love it.  I get a lot of complements on it as it is something different and stands out compared to the traditional gold or silver men's wedding ring.  The carbon fiber inlay adds a cool 3D like effect.  It may not be traditional but that's what I like about it.  I definitely recommend buying this if it caught your eye in a store."
5.0,This is a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I know she will love it!
5.0,Wide elastic waist.  True to size. Perfect length.  I will buy 2 more of these.
5.0,"material is not thick, like a very stretchy tshirt material.  I bought medium and large and the medium fit just right. the dress has pleats on the front and back, and it helps to hide my gut haha.  130 pounds and 5'2"".  waiting for the black to come back. thanks!"
5.0,Love product but shipping was very slow.
5.0,As expected. Nothing more nothing less. Comfortable to walk in. True to size
5.0,I ordered a small fits good .... 5’6 130 lbs
5.0,La rapidez y el material en qu esta hecho excelente!
5.0,My great niece put her dress on and didn’t want to take it off.She looked like a little Princess.
5.0,My favorite combo I’d buy again and again. I love the quality.
5.0,My husband and I both use these for reading glasses. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I forget I’m even wearing them.
5.0,"Very cute! You will need to size up if you are a bigger girl, but you will look great in it. I love that I can wear a 2 piece with my mama pouch. And with the price, it’s a steal! I highly recommend!"
5.0,"I'm a 32/34 B and this product is perfect it is stretchy so I could see it being fine for a size up from me. It's just like the picture shows and super comfy. I wear it for jogging,yoga and even as an everyday bra for work."
5.0,These gloves are excellent quality with a comfortable fit.
5.0,The hats came in and were just as advertised.  In fact as soon as I finish this note I will be ordering another 40 of them for distribution to our members.
5.0,Was well received as a Christmas gift. Fit as expected.
5.0,A beautiful white gold chain that I purchased for my son as a gift. It is absolutely beautiful. The clasp is sturdy and the rope is diamond cut. It is well worth the price and then some.
5.0,My daughter uses these to carry her glasses to school. She has dropped it quiet a few times and the glasses and case have even scratch free! Perfect for kids!!!!
5.0,I'm so impressed with the quality of this sweater. It is so soft and fits great. The fabric is thicker than expected as well.
5.0,I was kind of unsure about ordering pants online but these are absolutely perfect and more than what I expected. I wore them one time to wear them in and then after I wash them they are so comfortable and fit me perfect in every way. It hides any kind of love handle you have and they feel amazing and make you feel amazing when you're wearing them. I will definitely buy more. This line is amazing!!!!
5.0,"I thought this necklace would be too big but it isn't. The color is as shown. I got two necklaces the same day & asked my husband which he liked the best as I was having trouble picking which I liked most, he liked them both also but surprisingly he liked this one the most (lol he really doesn't like pink normally)."
5.0,"I loved these so much I bought 8 of them...patterns and solids.  Perfect to wear with leggings and a cardigan and boots, perfect to wear with shorts or capris in warmer weather...they are the perfect length to cover all the ""bits"" that I prefer not to show."
5.0,"I love this sweater. It's so cute, flattering, and comfortable. I have worn it on at night and it's so warm and cozy. It's light and easily match to any outfits. Perfect for fall. I order a large. It fits perfectly! The crop length is also great. If I lift my arms up, the bottom of my bralette may show. It is not too short at all. Like I said, the fit is really flattering. I often find that cropped sweaters make me look boxy, this doesn't. It's stretchy and roomy to wear. Totally go well with any high waist jean!"
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful! I'm 5'3 120 lb size small. There's plenty of natural slack that it could fit larger sizes too. Length ends right after my knees and sleeves end right before the wrist. It's light and silky. It's pricier than others but it's for the quality. With Amazon fulfillment, it arrived within days. I definitely recommend this for everyone and especially for gifts!"
5.0,"I've tried several others types of pants for the gym and these are hands down the best. Before purchasing, I read lots of reviews on different pants and I'm happy I came across these. I love all the different color options that 90 Degree offers. They fit great, are extremely easy to move around in, don't slide off your but, and stay right where they should. Since last month, I've bought 3 pairs and already want other colors. At 5'2&#34; I bought a small and they fit a few inches above my ankles. Upon wearing them the first time, I was sure I was going to break a seam getting into them and wished I had bought a medium. They've loosened up in the waist though and fit like a glove now. I'm happy I purchased the small instead of the medium. After washing them numerous times, I've yet to notice any pilling. I love these pants and look forward to buying more."
5.0,This Romper is a gauze type material. It is cool in the summer.
5.0,great quality...to dark for me though
5.0,Fit and quality was Great.
5.0,"Immediately came on Amazon to tell you guys how great this hoodie is. If you're looking for a plain black pullover that's not super heavy, this is the one. It's lined inside with fleece but only a very thin layer, enough to keep you warm but not sweaty. And it's soft! The hood is nice and big too and the pocket is also lined. I'm a pretty average sized lady and I ordered a medium, which is a perfect fit."
5.0,Bought this for my husband for father's day last year. He loves it and wears it daily! Its held up great and still works great too. Would definitely recommend
5.0,These sunglasses by SKYWAY rock!! Very lightweight but durable. The style is just right! I love the shape of the lenses. They cover the eyes completely. I have no need to squint or shade my eyes when wearing these. The nose pads fit comfortably and the sunglasses do not slip down on my nose. They come with a nice case so your sunglasses stay in good shape. I would expect to pay more for these sunglasses than what they cost. Great for both men and women. 5 stars hands down!
5.0,"Clipped on easily, really comfy and hasn't fallen off or slipped. I have a Charge 4."
5.0,Soo cutee. Im a size 5.5 to 6 in women and this fit PERFECT on me :) it doesnt feel loose or too stretched out. Love the material its made out of. will buy again!
5.0,these pants keep us warm and dry on our trip down the grand caynon on mules. It rained on the bottom we stayed nice and dry.
5.0,I am 5’1 and 106 pounds boobless (32A) bought the small and everything fits perfect!
5.0,The perslock I received was a high quality item and does its job perfectly. Living in the city can make me nervous with such a large purse but this item keeps it safe and is extremely cute! I love mine so much! Thanks!
5.0,Awesome. The kids loved them. Didn't come across any that didn't work.
5.0,Love this necklace. Wear it everyday and always get multiple compliments. Sparkly and beautiful. Can change the length.
5.0,"Great concept, and actually works."
5.0,"Very cute and flattering. Will be great for spring and summer. I bought a medium, but had to return it for a small. I didn't know what size I wore. It is true to size, though. Not see through at all."
5.0,"Often gaiter/ headband convertible masks cause a headache. Not these. Can be stretched to comfort, easy to breathe through and actually a bit sweat absorbent (perfect for workouts).  Hard to believe I’m extolling the virtue of a face mask but here it is!"
5.0,"Very satisfied with the color, quality and price.  I've ordered several colors for my wife and she loves them all."
5.0,I wore this dress at Passover and I just loved the fit and comfortability. The colors were vibrant and I received many compliments. I will buy more in different styles.
5.0,Too big Nike runs large nearly a whole size for kids version of these
5.0,"I am extremely happy with my new Haular Weekender bag. When my bag arrived I unboxed it in front of my roommate . As is unboxed it is was saying &#34;look at my new Weekender! &#34; and his 1st reaction was &#34;I could go away longer then a weekend with that!&#34; I feel the same, It is very roomy, yet small enough to qualify as carry on luggage . This is a very classy bag that I will be proud to carry no mater were I may go. The canvas is heavy, sturdy and of a thickness that you might find on a old army cot, but way more beautiful. I got the gray, and it is lovely. I made this choice because ill be taking mine to places like hunting cabins and such and I would have no hope of keeping a cream color clean. In my opinion though, the cream bag should look even more stunning then the grey . I love a retro look and this bag does fill that bill well. The leather on this bag is actually PU, but It manages not to detract from the look and feel of this bag. This PU has a nice grain and has a supple feel to it. The hardware looks be brass. There is a zippered pocket on the outside of the bag and a sleeve were you could have tickets , a map or a small electronic stashed. In side the bag is lined with a zippered area and two pockets along with additional pockets for your shoes. All the zippers on this bag move VERY smoothly. There are 6 brass feet on the bottom of the bag, and a shoulder strap as well as the handles. The sides of the bag has straps making the bag smaller and more compact yet expandable when needed. I am very excited about this bag and now need to plan my next trip. I will no doubt enjoy this bag for many years to come and can with out a doubt recommend this bag to any friend of mine looking for one such as this * I received this bag for free in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. My review is based solely on my own personal opinions of the product that I receive and no incentive for a positive review is offered me. *"
5.0,Beautiful shirt just love the cozy ness of it
5.0,"The head of the shirt is cut a but small but other than that, my baby boy love is"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:473df1165e805dfbd979a271f4ff5a07]] Wear it last night to my Christmas party, sexy fabulous love it"
5.0,Gift for my daughter.  She loves it & people always ask where to get one.
5.0,"Lovely necklace only thing is I wish it were just a tad shorter, but nonetheless I am in love with the piece."
5.0,"This dress is so pretty! And the material on the top is so super soft! Wow, what a great buy!!!!"
5.0,"Love Love these leggings, perfect fit, color and size. Hoping to get all the colors. Very affordable too!!  Thanks Amazon just once again ~"
5.0,Received yesterday to wear for my upcoming Nuptials. It is absolutely beautiful and will go perfect with my dress.
5.0,"We get a lot of compliments on this dress. We used it as my daughter’s Christmas Eve dress. It was nice enough to wear to church but not too fancy for our small family gathering.<br /><br />My daughter is going through a tutu phase, so she now wears this dress about once per week. The tulle has gotten a little beaten up but would probably look nice again after ironing. The dress is holding up really well!"
5.0,"these are absolutely adorable, I bought them for a friend and want to buy a pair for myself soon because of how cute they are"
5.0,"Just received my sunglasses today and I cannot wait to wear them! I have a full round face and fits great .... for the price they are great quality, very sturdy. Now if you don’t like over size shades or your face is too skinny this style might not suite you. Besides that I highly recommend this product they are just beautiful!"
5.0,Perfect for tropical vacation safety.
5.0,"I got two masks for my grandson and myself to wear to the BYU-ASU football game.  They were very comfortable.  The three features I liked best are the adjustable ear straps, the fitted chin pocket and the filter."
5.0,They are great!!
5.0,My son loved this underwear.  Very comfortable material and great fit. This is my second purchase because he wanted to replace his old underwear
5.0,working well
5.0,This charm is great for representing family and it’s reasonable and you don’t have to spend all the money you would at Pandora for a nice Charm and it doesn’t change colors
5.0,"This dress is exactly what I was looking for! Flattering cut, fabric with a give, and can be as elegant as you want...just coordinate with accessories! Want one in every color now. The Navy was a dark, but still blue...I highly recommend this for everyone."
5.0,They are easily adjustable and made of quality material.
5.0,"Great suit, good material and fit. The bust area is too big and somewhat cone-shaped (think Madonna) but overall I'm really happy with it."
5.0,Love these hats I order them all the time
5.0,Absolutely love these sunglasses!
5.0,"These shoes are comfortable and warm. They give me great arch support, but my heel hangs off just a bit. Although, I would recommend these."
5.0,"OMG!! By far my favorite purse I have ever owned, I cannot say enough on how much I love this purse !! I love it so much I am buying another one in a different color!!"
5.0,Great product! Order a size bigger than your usual.
5.0,"Just got these in the mail. I guess time will tell if they will last, but they seem to be high quality. The fit is EXCELLENT, and I have a big head. However, my kids can also wear these, as there is a draw string around the top part, so they do appear to be ""one size fits all"". Fabric is a little stretchy, but does the job nicely.<br /><br />The Covid-19 PanickDemic has been ridiculous, but at least it gives us an excuse to wear these great masks in public! (Nevermind the fact that I was already very socially distant - now I can even wear this great mask!) These will do NOTHING to prevent virus particles from getting to your face, but I see VERY FEW useful masks out in public anyway. GREAT PRODUCT!"
5.0,"It was a bit too small.  The metal zippers destroy my nails ;(.....that said, the purse is well constructed and quite beautiful."
5.0,"This top is super cute with the ruffle sleeves.  I wear it with leggings.  It washes very well, maintaining it's shape and color."
5.0,"Love the case.  Just wish there were a way to attach a regular stylus to it.  The one that came with is plugs into the bottom of the phone, but is too short and dangles with no where to secure it."
5.0,"Soft and confortable, the color is great , it looks great on my dougther ."
5.0,"I GOT THIS SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR SCHOOL ,GREAT QUALITY THEY WERE ON SALE GOT THE IN EVERY PAIR. PICTURE DOES NOT DO THIS SHOES ANY JUSTICE. WORTH EVERY DOLLOR"
5.0,"This shirt is very soft, material is good fit is perfect I love it."
5.0,"I thought the price was a little high, but its stunning and very well made."
5.0,Really a cute purse. Love the color and soft feel.
5.0,My favorite key chain!!!
5.0,Wow! I have never in my life worn any slipper. Recent plantar fasciitis issues had me wearing orthotic footwear at all times but when I’m home I want something lightweight. THESE SLIPPERS ARE LIKE WEARING CLOUDS ON YOUR FEET! The arch support is superior to that of any previous footwear I’ve owned.
5.0,"This dress is amazing. The color is exactly as advertised. There is no stretch at all, so order the right size. It also shows some major cleavage. Easily one of my favorite dresses"
5.0,"Very nice bag! I plan to give it as a gift, but it is the perfect size and style for an on-the-go business professional. I got the small size and it can easily fit a tablet in addition to all the usual items. It comes in a nice range of color options as well."
5.0,"My daughter broke her arm so I bought these as makeshift sleeves since her cast won't fit through her long sleeve shirts (wears a 4T). They fit her arm, her legs and her (2T) sister's legs. I couldn't be happier with the product."
5.0,I just received these and am wearing them right now. They are wonderful and would make a great gift for anyone. Very warm and comfortable.
5.0,These are warm and extremely well made.
5.0,This product is perfect! They fit my 7 year old son perfectly!
5.0,Very light material and comfortable.
5.0,"I love this belt. If I knew how much I would of liked it, I would of purchased one along time ago. I purchased because of price and very happy with quality. I have worn almost every day for about 3 months."
5.0,"I have all 4 colors in this romper. The grey striped is of a thicker cotton so it's a little stiff but nothing major. I say that to say that I prefer the softness of this one better. It is so adorable and so comfortable. I'm 5'8, 180lbs and wear a US 12-14 bottom, size lg top and curvy, and the XL fits perfectly. With curvy hips and rather large derriere, I was worried about coverage but unnecessarily. It's not too short in the leg area, front or back. I can't wait for the warm weather.  Sorry this review is so long but when I am making a determination on whether or not I will purchase an article of clothing, I like to see reviews from people with my body type or close to it in height, weight and curve. You won't regret purchasing this romper."
5.0,Great quality and perfect for October!  I had to re-order a size down though.  Thank God for free returns!
5.0,"Fit perfectly! Exactly what I needed. Made well, and shipped fast! Satisfied customer."
5.0,My daughter wears a size 6/6.5 in sandals so we got a size 7.5 but they sent us a size 8 they fit perfectly!!! GO UP A SIZE AND A HALF OR TWO SIZES!! THEY ARE SMALLER THEN MINI MELISSAS!! I wish the straps were velcro or had more then one snap so you can choose the size of  the strap. The straps are a little big.
5.0,Great pair of earings
5.0,I really like these watches for working as a nurse. I hate getting my wrist watches wet with all the hand washing or being careful not to get it wet. These solve the problem and hook onto my scrubs nicely (my scrubs have preexisting loops to connect things like badges and the like.) If the metal is cheap I don't foresee that being a problem as they don't come into contact with my skin anyway. They fulfill my needs perfectly as a nurse.
5.0,I have used for many years on my new and old cars.  It works great and protects the wheels.
5.0,Good job Nike!
5.0,I got an XL which is usually what I wear it was a little smaller than I wanted it but still fits I wish it was a little longer material is good and soft I wouldn't stick it in the dryer. Other than that I think it's a great buy
5.0,Fits as expected. Great sweatshirt. Thin and soft. Perfect for a light jacket or after exercise thin layer. Will buy again!
5.0,"VERY GOOD ,THANK YOU!"
5.0,Great fun earings for a great price.
5.0,"It's not cotton, it is silky. I like the color and pattern. It's cool and I like this blouse"
5.0,"Fit well, amazing price!"
5.0,Nice tights perfect for fall they are nice and thick just perfect so my baby girl doesn't over heat and I can layer her up if it gets colder. I purchased 6-12 months my baby girl is 11 months and this still have room for her to grow the waist is lose but my little one is in the petite side but they do not fall off.
5.0,"I wasn't sure which of the 2 sizes to order. So, on the cautious side, I ordered a L/XLG. I was unsure of it fitting when it arrived & I took it out of the package. It looked small. However, it was no issue at all to put on.<br /><br />This did not fit so well on my bust. The straps are NOT adjustable. They kept slipping off my shoulders, but that could be because I have a smaller bust. From below my bust down, it fits so nice! It's not tight, but form fitting. It smoothed me out and made me look more &#34;even&#34; all the way around my waist & &#34;love handle&#34; area. It helped &#34;smooth&#34; out the appearance of my bottom also. I'm assuming due to my shape, it's normal for it to be longer in the front than in the back. It almost came down to below my bottom. I'm ok with that.<br /><br />I'll admit, I've worn this with several different outfits since it arrived. I like how it feels & will probably purchase a few more in the smaller size. I'm sure someone could wear this and add a skirt & it look fabulous."
5.0,beautiful shirt. i ordered a size up and it worked perfectly. i wish that they would include more colors soon because i would most certainly order from them again.
5.0,"I am 5'2"",  I am 54 years old so I may have shrunk to 5'1"". I weigh 127 pounds.  I purchased a large after sending back two other suits.  I know others might get a medium if they are taller but my weight seems to be in the middle, so the large fit perfect.  This is the most perfect fit for me! it is a high waist and the back is not to much material so it fits well.  the top is a good size with padded cups and holds well.  the belt on this suit is an added bonus and looks cute ,but it would be fine as well since the fit for the bottoms is perfect. It is not full coverage on the bottom but enough so it is not inappropriate which makes it look both classy and sexy at the same time. I highly recommend this bathing suit."

5.0,Excellent shorts
5.0,My 2 yo granddaughter loves that she can put these on and take them off by herself.  Really cute and well made.
5.0,This is a well made dress and looks even better in person.  Fits perfectly.  I am 5’5 and 125lbs and the 6 fit well.
5.0,"I ordered this for my wife. She said it fits really well, and I see her wearing it all the time!  I think she looks good in it :)"
5.0,Love the colors. Great quality
5.0,Outstanding key chain !
5.0,"It’s very pretty, the only thing I’m not totally happy with is the size. I have small wrists, so it looks a little big on me"
5.0,This is a very sweet delicate bracelet
5.0,Awesome and big enough
5.0,Keeps feet warm.
5.0,This is perfect!!! It is comfortable it stays on your face lightweight. Very fast shipping!!! I ordered three and I will be getting more
5.0,It does run smaller. But is very nice.

5.0,"This is an adorable hat, well made and anyone can wear it.  I  am 81 and will wear it with a bleached demin jeans and jacket."

5.0,"Great Dress , perfect fit , very beautiful That is why I will give 5 stars"
5.0,Love these so much!!!!! Perfect fit and does not roll down.
5.0,The design and colors
5.0,"I purchased these for daith piercings and I absolutely LOVE them. I ordered gold and silver and could not be more pleased. There is a larger gauge size and a smaller one, which is nice if you want to keep you piercings more patent. I have seen reviews where there was difficulty opening and closing, however, personally I like that it is difficult to open and close. I often play with them at night and have lost earrings in my bed. The earrings simply “click” into place and I don’t find it difficult, at all.  I get lots of compliments on how nice they look. Very well made and no allergy issues. I use AirPods  all the time and found the new AirPods with the soft tips much more comfortable."
5.0,"Finally a croakie that works!. Very good rubber grips for  the ends of your glasses  that attach firmly on my small and medium sized glasses.  You don't have to worry about rubber loops that dislodge themselves that many other eyeglass connectors have.  Slim bands that you can expand or tighten without taking off the glasses are helpful when going between normal day use and active sport use.  I Love this design, it works and is not even noticeable that you have a ""adjustable eyeglass strap"" attached to your glasses ."
5.0,This is just like the pic. It just fitted me right away plus it a little bit elastic as well. I am just in love with it
5.0,Super helpful withy plantar fasciitis. Very comfortable.
5.0,"Super lightweight and high quality. It’s flattering and comfortable. I love the contrast Halloween-meets-Christmas fabric. I was terrified that a large would be snug, but it fits like a dream! I need it in every color now!<br /><br />The only downsides were an odd odor (with I’m sure will wash/air out in time), and a massive hole in one pocket from what appears to be a result of the two pieces of fabric falling out of alignment in manufacture. Luckily, I’m handy with a needle and thread, and I can fix that in a snap.<br /><br />This is my first purchase from Scarlet Darkness, and if this dress is anything to go by, it won’t be the last!"
5.0,It's a great item she was happy. We're no longer together anymore. Are poly relationship had a turn of events. But that's ok. Moving on to the next.
5.0,Love it! Sheds a bit so be careful on dark colors.
5.0,"I ordered a pair of these slippers blindly based upon the web presentations by Orthofeet. Just a few days ago I ordered a new pair to take the place of those wonderful slippers.  On looking at them side by side though; honestly, if I just replaced the insole with one of the Orthofeet offerings, the originals would be perfectly satisfactory to use another 4 years as far as I can tell.  Amazingly awesome product.  My only caveat, if you wear these with socks you'll want to Always wear socks with them.  I've found climbing the house staircase these slippers will 'slip off' so very easily while stepping up barefooted.  Oh, wearing socks with this is like the best thing you could ever do - warm, comfy, and usually glued to your feet.  Now, I have to figure out how I'm going to use two pairs!"
5.0,I was surprised at how well it cleaned and polished my silver jewelry and you don't have to mess with a liquid mess.
5.0,Like the looks and fit
5.0,I bought this polishing cloth for my silver Pandora bracelet and Bulova watch - it works great! It's definitely a larger cloth so would be big enough to clean larger items if needed.
5.0,I bought two.  They are both delightful!
5.0,Adorable and great fit!!!
5.0,"Super affordable and awesome. This came with everything for our trip to the Caribbean. I used the earplugs, the nose plugs and the goggles for a bit of beach fun and &#34;fish-stalking&#34;. Perfection at an affordable price."
5.0,Love my Snow White wallet and I get many compliments on it! Incredibly well made.
5.0,Excellent quality and greatly appreciated by gift recipient
5.0,"These joggers are so buttery soft, they feel just as good as my lululemons! They feel like a blend of athletic material and ultra soft cotton, I ordered a second pair the minute I tried the first ones on! They fit great and are a total steal at $20."
5.0,Im in love with this item! Thank you
5.0,what a pretty top fits very nice the material is very nice and soft
5.0,Was worried about quality because of how cheap but was more than happy and would buy again
5.0,Great product! Awesome price and seller! Very pleased with purchase.
5.0,"LOVE THIS DRESS! I was skeptical about buying any clothes from amazon, but I had initially bought the red dress in XL and it was WAYYYY too big! So I bought the navy in L and it fit just fine! I have broader shoulders and pretty busty for my height so I get like if you have the same features, you’ll find the bust area slightly tighter but I would not size up."
5.0,Main things I like about the shirt:-<br />- Great slim fit that hugs your body frame.<br />- Soft Cotton that is easy on skin<br />- Contrast white trims on collar/pockets/cuffs are a good style statement<br />- Color of the shirt is true to the pictures.<br />- Priced great<br /><br />Really like the shirt and I've attached the pictures to provide more views.<br />I was given the opportunity to review this at a promotional rate in exchange for my opinion.
5.0,wife loves it has two now one for necklace and one for bracelet
5.0,LUV it  goes w/everything  an mix matches well
5.0,Bello y excelente calidad
5.0,Its is what I expected the material is very comfortable and I got what I wanted
5.0,Beautiful! I wore it for my wedding and got a lot of compliments.
5.0,The New Seek Optics replacement lenses fit my Oakley M Frames perfectly.
5.0,VERY PRETTY AND DELIVERED IN GREAT CONDITION!!!
5.0,The black ones were perfect to replace sunglasses and the blue ones were great for the pool they also came with a nose piece. I have no complaints and no one could believe what i paid for these googles.
5.0,love the way it looks when I am wearing it
5.0,"These are excellent wool socks. They're light, warm, and comfortable. They're priced right, too. What I like best is that, unlike some wool socks, they're not too bulky. That makes them suitable for wearing with your shoes or sneakers without the footwear getting too tight. Alternately, you could wear these socks underneath another pair of socks, which cuts down on friction on your feet. Also, as you see in the photo, they're not too long. Some other wool socks are so long they have to be folded over so they're not too high on the calf; not so with these. I'd happily buy these socks again."
5.0,perfect fit for 40h.  looks great
5.0,Very comfortable. Cute.
5.0,"I LOVE this tool. The diamond etched stiletto is great, it grabs the fabric just right. It also has a flat side so it doesn't roll off your workspace.  I have many stilettos but none compares to this one. I want another one for my travel tool bag. Hoping for one for Christmas."
5.0,"Purchased for my father. He wears L-2XL depending on the style. I ordered a 4XL, because it was inexpensive and that’s the closest size they had. Shockingly, it fits him decent. It’s not too big, but is a tad shorter than I pictured. So, I’d order a size or two larger than you normally wear unless you want it tightly fitted. Soft fabric, which is a bonus."
5.0,"I was apprehensive about ordering this product because I did not know much about the seller but I decided to give it a try.<br />I am glad that I did the sweatshirt is perfect, it fits as expected and the material is nice quality.<br />Thank you"
5.0,These do not have the stretch like most silvers but still fit true to size.  Perfect length.
5.0,"Very happy with these little plugs. There were enough in the set to gift away a few. They stay in nicely and are easy to pull out when needed. Since I'm QI wirelessly charging, they hardly ever have to come out and everything stays clean and I don't worry about water as much."
5.0,I like how this sleeves emphasize my chest and six pack abs.
5.0,"This is a flirty, feel good dress.  Casual and yet you can dress it up too. Very pleased."
5.0,"Gran opción, buena calidad!"
5.0,"I lost a lot of weight and was looking for a new belt, this belt straps up nicely and fits well"
5.0,"Bought this a few weeks ago and so far it's held up great, which is surprising based on cost alone. Seems pretty sturdy, and I Love the design/ looks."
5.0,"Great boys pants!  Fit my 12 year old son quite well.  My son is 5’ even and 93 lbs.  I ordered him a large and they fit great however he does needs the drawstring tied because this is a loose fit.  In his previous Adidas track pants the size medium fit well in the waist but they were a good 2inches too short, he will eventually fill out and the loose fit will not be so loose.  My son is extremely picky about everything, however he likes these and the red adidas shirt with black stripes they sell here on Amazon matches perfectly and makes a a great choice for a comfortable outfit."
5.0,"The band looks good on my wrist.  However, it is not a long band so if my wrist, which is pretty thin, was bigger, it would not fit."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It’s great for Christmas or 4th of July, or even Valentine’s Day. Add holiday accessories and it takes on a new look. I’m going to wear it for Thanksgiving this year, with a 1950s style fall colored apron. You’ll want to own a petticoat to go with it."
5.0,"El reloj es hermoso y el material súper resistente, buena compra."
5.0,I love this product! It stays on my face with a firm but not an uncomfortable hold. It also doesn't fog up so you can see everything crystal clear and I love how easy it is to adjust the straps to make it tighter or looser around your face. Definitely recommend with no complaints!
5.0,Worked perfect for my Harley Quinn BOP costume
5.0,My grandmother absolutely loves this necklace.  I bought it for her for Christmas after her cat passed away.  She wears it all the time.
5.0,Heel a little too tall
5.0,"What a nice bag!!!!! The smell is incredible,  it feels like very high quality leather.  The bag looks quite nice,  feels great and holds a lot, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I'm wearing it right now. Very well made. I am satisfied with this product and I received it on time.
5.0,"This is a lovely pedant. The blue topaz is surrounded by a sparkling circle of silver and hangs on a delicate silver chain. I like the subtle design, works both on bare skin and when I wear is with a thin dark turtleneck where the light silver stands out.<br />Topaz is my November birthstone. I read that blue topaz can be worn for both November and December birthstone representation. The blue topaz is a nice alternative to the classic yellow amber color of traditional topaz. It has a wonderful winter feel to the light blue and silver color combination. Will be great to wear for the holidays.<br />It's a shorter chain than implied in the Amazon photos but I like the shorter length. The chain hangs at the start of my sternum bone, an ideal placement for me. I'm a petite woman and someone with a larger frame may find the placement of the chain to be a little high for them.<br />The color of the stone is a light blue, depending on where it is photographed it shows up a different light/darkness. The main Amazon photo is much darker than the stone looks to me in real life. I find the forth and fifth pictures to be closest to the true color and lightness of the stone.<br />The necklace came well cushioned in a plastic bag folded into the bright blue zip pouch."
5.0,This dress is fun. The material is thin so be aware...but it did the trick.
5.0,"My children find this product very nice! It is easy for them to breath with; and does not pull on their face or ears. FOR THOSE WHO WEAR bone conduction hearing aids (BAHA) with a soft band: My son, who has bilateral microtia, and uses a soft band with two BAHAs loves the boy versions of this one too. I simply hook the loops over his safety line clips connected to his soft band. Both of my kids LOVE them."
5.0,We gave it to our adult son at Christmas.. made it a merry Christmas.. A OK 🌲
5.0,Love these. My legs are very short so sometimes they pinch behind my knee but being on your feet 13 hours they are a must
5.0,"Bought this dress for my grandaughter, she Loves it. The material is very nice, the color beautiful, she wears a 6 I bought a 6 it fits perfect! My granddaughters tall n slender the dress went down past her ankles. Oh I highly recommend this dress to anyone who has a little girl that wants to feel like a princess! My granddaughter felt like a princess when she wore it!"
5.0,This brand makes great clothes at an exceptional value. I can't wait to see what their fall line looks like.
5.0,I bought a size smaller like reviews said to do and they fit great. I normally wear a men's 10 and bought the size 9's. They are comfortable and I would buy again.
5.0,"My daughter tried out a puddle jumper when we stayed at a Hampton Inn a few months back, and I must say, they are great! We didn't have to worry about her being in the pool with us, since they kept her upright and above water. Unlike the inflatable armbands, that don't really do anything, and cause you to worry if they will fail, or the bulky personal life vests that inhibit movement, this on the other hand does everything it claims!"
5.0,I love these shoes! I first bought them in a size 2 when Payless was open. It's hard to find size 2s that have grips on the bottom for a 15month old (small feet) and put them on her all the time! She has out grown them and was SO happy to find these on Amazon.
5.0,I wear these earrings a lot!
5.0,"i have 8 of the hats and love them all, love the vivid colors. i,m looking for a bright yellow, that would be the icing on the cake!!!!!"
5.0,My husband was able to adjust it to the smallest but it leaves a big poof on the back. He has a small head. Great quality hat and I like it too.
5.0,Husband loves this shirt and it fits him perfectly
5.0,Will be purchasing the black one soon. This is the cutest outfit I have bought.
5.0,Great quality at a great price.
5.0,Soft headband! Great for workouts or sporting events.
5.0,"These are super comfy..but run small...i am a 7.5... Ordered the 7-8.5 and they just fit...im going to order a size up in another color...overall, i am very happy!"
5.0,perfect size and pockets.
5.0,Perfect gift. I gave it to my best friend and she absolutely loved it. 10/10
5.0,The half frame kids sunglasses fit my 9 year old perfectly. He loves them and says they are comfortable. The blue and yellow combination are so fun and cool looking.<br /><br />My 9 year old has sensitive eyes to sunlight and these glasses do a good job protecting his eyes.
5.0,Just as described. Great quality. Great price!
5.0,This product was super nice looking and it came how it was supposed to be. It a great gift or anything that might mean something to you that you could give to someone. I was ever happy with the product
5.0,Comfortable and looks much more expensive than it it.
5.0,"nice material, came just in time for a cold rainy day!"
5.0,Interesting hat! Everyone keeps telling me how exotic it looks.
5.0,"The style and shape are great. If you have big boobs like i do, your bra or side boob might be exposed just in front of your armpits. Im just going to wear a black bra and go with it. It will be a perfect summer dress or tunic."
5.0,These are my favorite brand of head bands. They never slide off your head. They were a little tight when I first got them but have stretched a bit
5.0,"These are flawless! Not see through, no horrible camel toe, great fabric. May want to size up for comfort though"
5.0,"You get what you pay for. I have the rose gold frame with pink band. The band is great! The frame, not so much. I have to replace it due to the finish wearing off on the edges, only after 2 months wearing I noticed it."
5.0,Will send pix at a later date. This is a Christmas present for my boss. ♥️
5.0,"I bought this leotard for my almost 3 year old daughter for her first dance class. It is a great quality of fabric and washes well. I would order a size up. I did after reading other reviews, and it fit perfectly. She normally wears a 4/5 and we purchased a 6/8."
5.0,"I love these ear rings.  They are just the right size, not to big and gaudy....really pretty."
5.0,These are great for reading in the sun and driving! I thought the bifocal would bother me. It's absolutely perfect. I can see ahead and also see my dash by glancing down!!  Love them
5.0,This is an excellent product for allowing large hats to fit on small heads. I can recommend it.
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this shirt! It is amazing! I love the pictures of it on the product page! So many times, the pictures on the product page don't actually look anything like the product you receive. I am happy to report that this shirt was exactly what I expected.<br /><br />If you spend anytime reading the reviews, you will notice a lot of people saying it it too big. It is larger that you would expect for the size, but there are a lot of reviews that indicate this. They are telling the truth. I ordered a size up from what I normally wear. If you buy this in your normal size, you will probably find it more suitable fo leggings. I bought it one size down, so that I could wear it with jeans and not feel like I am swimming in it. If you get the shirt too big, you may have issues with the hammock sleeves not fitting correctly.<br /><br />The fabric of the shirt feels a little like pajamas. I have worn it a couple times and it is holding up well. I hope that continues, because I absolutely love the way this shirts fit! The hammock sleeves fit me perfectly. They hang just right. I am 5'11&#34; and the shirt is the perfect length for me for Jeans or for leggings, I will be wearing this shirt tomorrow with a pair of white capris. :) The shirt is also made well.<br /><br />This shirt is a great club shirt, but it is also a great shirt for a Saturday shopping at the mall. Although be prepared for the compliments. I wore it out to the mall a couple weeks ago and I had 3 people ask me where I purchased it. In all honesty, this shirt at the list price, is a great deal!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:7008aee189700dc4a859cefc64491d0a]] Great alternative to wearing my husband’s tees, more feminine but just as comfortable - if not more. 😉 Great basic top, very soft & extremely comfortable. Has a mild stretch to it making it very easy to tie up for versatile looks. Sleeves are smaller & feminine but loose so they aren’t riding up into armpits which is nice. Neckline is larger than typical tees & has a “relaxed” look. I sized down for a more fitted look yet still a little loose on me but, I think this top is meant to be loose fitting which I’m really enjoying. I’d say order your usual size for a more relaxed/loose fit & a size down for a more fitted look. Color is accurate to stock photo, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it on & think the color looks great on me. I personally think this is a great top to dress up or wear casually because the material is thinner than regular tees making it easy to wear more dressy. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase & am considering buying more colors. Great product, good condition, fast shipping! If you found my review helpful, I would appreciate you clicking “helpful” - thanks!!!"
5.0,My girlfriend loved it!
5.0,Ordered for granddaughter for Christmas she had it on her list. Very pleased with them and the price was right too.
5.0,my girl loves it. it is very beautiful and large too
5.0,"very good material, the clasp isnt sturdy .good for working plaves that require u to use clear bags"
5.0,"When I opened this package I almost returned it without trying it on because I realized it wasn’t flannel. It is a stretchy material. But I’m glad I gave them a try because they’re very comfortable. They’re thin but not see through. They look like oversized flannel PJs, they’re baggy, but are somehow clingy enough across my small chest that you can see when the high beams are on if you get my meaning...  However, they are really comfortable, I don’t get hot, the pockets fit my large phone and the pants stay up. I worried the stretch would not hold my phone and the pants would stretch down but they don’t. They haven’t shrunk. With flannel PJs I always end up wearing sock with my slippers or my ankles get cold but these are long enough to cover my ankles when I’m sitting on the recliner watching TV. I washed them separately with a color catcher sheet the first time but I don’t think the color ran. I’ve since washed them in the regular load, no problems. I am 5’4”, 165 lb, pear shaped and bought the Large. I could maybe have gotten the Medium but I didn’t so now I’ll never know."
5.0,"The leather touches soft and feels durable, the size is very easy to take out from purse."
5.0,"Wife really likes them, and that makes them a good buy.  With the necklace they definitely compliment each other.  Outstanding"
5.0,"I purchase this as a dress-up costume for my daughter. The fabric is wonderful! It's very shimmery and &#34;slinky&#34; feeling, just like what you would expect a real mermaid to have! My daughter absolutely loves it!! It is not the same type of material as most swim suits (it's thinner) so I am not sure how it would be in the water, but it is perfect for around the house. She's been wearing this off and on since it arrived several days ago and doesn't want to take it off! Super price for a costume like this. I received a discount on this item in exchange for leaving a honest review."
5.0,Looks great and the price can't be beat. Will probably buy other color options as well.
5.0,Very pretty shirt ...
5.0,"This is a beautiful necklace.  The pendant is a nice size with a glimmering polish.  And the chain is a sleek, shiny snake chain.  Sturdy and strong, not like the usual pendant chain you receive.  Highly recommended."
5.0,The material and right dizer for me. Beautiful
5.0,"I have been looking for about a year for an ouija bracelet, so glad I purchased this one when I found it. It looks great!"
5.0,comfy and adorable
5.0,This is a beautiful dress just as the picture.
5.0,quick delivery nice product.
5.0,Beautiful too! Fit was perfect.
5.0,"Very comfortable. Feels like I'm wearing a giant pad! Lol, oh I am wearing one, duh! Makes riding a lot easier."
5.0,Fits like expected
5.0,Purchased for my 7/8 Month old to wear at night or during naps to protect her hair. Fits great with room to grow and she has pretty long curls for a baby her age. When frustrated she has pulled over her face so you need to watch young babies closely when wearing for safety.
5.0,"literally the best thing i have ever received. i cried i loved it so much. the birth of my child could not top the feeling of having this amazing, stunning shirt of these perfect human beings. thank you so much"
5.0,Clipping 6yo protective mask to his shirt so it’s not lost.  Works great!
5.0,This is such a cute dress. It is very light so I often wear leggings and a sweater with it but its always a hit.
5.0,So far so good 👍🏼
5.0,Just what I needed for around the house and pool.
5.0,Great quality stretchy fabric.
5.0,"I'm 5 ft, 143 lbs. and ordered the large so I could wear it over layers. It is perfect for that. If I were to wear it over a lightweight T it would have been a bit too big. Order yours according to how you layer. Wonderful quality, not  a lightweight knit, good substance. Worth every penny!"
5.0,Sorry about previous review --- I typed it in here by mistake - that was for another order of gloves. This HAT is as beautiful as it is warm and useful. Got it for my dad to go to SFO - to enjoy the bay area in good health and warmth. The gloves I ordered with this did not arrive and I mistyped the miffed review here instead of the gloves. SORRY!
5.0,This dress is so cute. It is a perfect summer dress. The material feels so good nice and soft. I ordered a large since that is what l normally and it fit perfectly.
5.0,These shoes are great i would defiantly recommand these.
5.0,"These are just so fun ... I kept 2 for myself and am giving the rest away to my girlfriends for various occasions.<br />The colors and patterns are lovely and they're well made.<br />Perfect for goody bags,  teacher gifts,  thinking of you gifts,  or whatever!<br />So far my friends have loved them... they're so unique!"
5.0,REALLY CUTE
5.0,This shirt is beautiful . It feels so soft and is well made . The fit was perfect for my hubby .
5.0,Super cute a decent quality for $4
5.0,"This is a great set of cases to carry some extra surgical type masks around.  You have to make sure that the cases are wide enough for a mask to fit, and these are.  About 5 masks can fit in each case, so I always have some masks in the car for emergencies (when the kids forget).  I also carry one in my purse for those occasions when the doctor we’re seeing requests surgical masks over fabric.  Anyway, great price for 5 cases.  They are all pretty sturdy and slim.  Happy with this purchase, makes toting around extra masks so much easier."
5.0,Very comfortable and looks much better than bra straps under some of my tank tops.
5.0,This are very nice and sturdy easy to.work with and versatile. Well worth the price
5.0,Love this product line. Smooth soft leather and great designs!
5.0,"I am 5'8"", 110 lbs, 30C, I bought a small, and this bra fits great. My only gripe is the shape of the provided padding. The cups are too concave so it made an unnatural bowl shape against my shirt. I replaced the provided pads with the ones from the bra my cat ate (seriously) and I like it much better. I posted the comparison photos with the two different paddings."
5.0,"They fit perfectly just a straight away. I cleaned them out of the package but they looked great and arrived in a perfect amount of time. I have gotten several compliments and after about 3 months, no gems are missing. I will say they need a little deep cleaning every once in a while. Its exactly what I wanted."
5.0,"Stylish, functional and great value!!"
5.0,I purchased this dress for my vacation in Florida so we could  do famili pictures and omg ir was perfect something really casual and cute it fits perfect love the baby blue color the straps you can adjust it withch is nice since I’m really small on the top .
5.0,My daughter loved this!
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic.<br />1) The cable design goes all the way up to the waistband.<br />2) They fit my newborn perfectly. They don’t slip down and the waistband sits above her belly button.<br />3) They are thick, well made, and perfect for a cold winter.<br /><br />Highly recommend!!!"
5.0,"Amazing bag! Lots of neat, convenient pockets inside and out. Very lightweight yet, sturdy. It says in the description that it will fit up to a 13&#34; laptop but, I have a 15.6&#34; that slipped right in there, unencumbered. Took it from Queens all the way to uptown Manhattan and back quite comfortably. And no animal products! Great buy."
5.0,Love this wallet I get so many compliments
5.0,Fit well on my two year old. Print was durable and lasted a few washes before we had to retire the outfit since she doesn't fit in it anymore
5.0,"MWC, if this watch is truly representative of their entire product line, makes nothing but quality.  Furthermore, it's quality at a reasonable price.  Who has the cash to pay hundreds of dollars for a Luminox?  Honestly?  And they look like you're wearing a portion of the terminator on your wrist.<br /><br />The watch has some weight to it and seems to be amazingly durable thus far.  I was somewhat skeptical of the nylon band, but it operates perfectly.  I trimmed some off to fit my wrist then flame-singed it with a lighter to prevent further unravelling.  I am one who does not like leather for a work/field watch and rubberized bands simply don't hold up.  Also in the durability category, I LOVE the genuine real glass, yes real glass, they employ for the watch face.  It does not scratch and does indeed give a classic, streamlined look as advertised.<br /><br />I have tried watch after watch including Swiss Army models made by Victorinox and Wenger.  They suck.  Plain and simple.  I'd go with an MWC model.  Trust me on this one.  You will not be sorry.  I work in the medical profession and wear it at work as well as in the field.  It does well in both arenas.  Check out their website ([...] to get a good look at all the available products."
5.0,I love this blouse. I wish it came in different colors!
5.0,These things are pretty awesome. I normally wear a medium but ordered XL. I should have bought large instead but they still fit and feel really good. They appear natural which is what I was worried about. I'll be ordering more for sure. Oh and I tossed the front padding. Lucky me...I didn't need it.
5.0,"Nice! Fits a little lose! However, looks great and quality!"
5.0,I am very pleased with this skirt. So much so that I ordered another one.

5.0,Better than Ray ban.
5.0,The costume was very comfortable.
5.0,"I got this for martial arts in a hot room. The shirt fits really well and is comfortable. It's made of that stretchy material that wicks sweat really well. The blue color looks good. It would be better if it were tagless, but the tag didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />I am 5'5"" 150lbs and the medium shirt was a perfect fit."
5.0,"Great every day ring, very bold and fun. Wears in nicely, have had it a month or more and it's scratched, but still shiny and pretty."
5.0,Beautiful necklace and it's one of my favorites
5.0,This ring is very nice.  My husband wears it all of the time.

5.0,Length is appropriate n good quality
5.0,"My only belt , because this is all I need . Reliable , I don’t have to worry about any holes messing up , or something happening to the buckle . The ratchet has some sort of sense of security , which is why I love this"
5.0,"I love this item.  If I ever have to use it, I'm sure the noise that it makes would startle a would be attacked long enough for me to get away.  I feel safer with it attached to my purse."
5.0,So freaking cute!!!!  You do need a bit of help with dressing - the halter strap needs to be fed through dress in the back.  I just love it.  Not chiffon but the material is nice.  Fits great.  Perfect casual or even dress it up with a short jacket.
5.0,"Love this bead! Am a major Star Wars Fan, this bead acts like a wonderful spacer between my &#34;dangle&#34; charms! Lets my Darth Vader bead and my Stormtrooper bead, exist with less friction. :D"

5.0,Great for Halloween costume and cosplay.
5.0,Great fit looks great
5.0,"I am long-waisted and this dress adjusted and fit well even without being labeled ‘tall.’ Wish I could find more like it. I wish, too, that more dresses were offered in ‘tall’ sizes."
5.0,The dress seemed nicely made for the price.  If I needed another dressy dress I would keep it.  I will return it because it is not as suitable as is another dress for the occasion.
5.0,"I wear tanks under most clothes and have bought these a few times.  Love them!!!!!  Comfy, stretchy and great length!"
5.0,Did what is was created to do - provide  forexcellent reading
5.0,The color and the shoes
5.0,Love the stones.very simple and not a oh look at my nose i have aomething sticking out of it. Its cute feminine and gives just a lil glimmer

5.0,Very comfortable and cute!
5.0,"Quick delivery and well worth it.  Next time I'm looking for some more cuff links, I'll start with them!"
5.0,"Stinkin cute cover up! I got the light green and it looks fabulous. The material is so soft and lightweight, the little pom-poms are quite a fun twist. It just went to a 2 week vacay and I got a lot of compliments on it. Definitely recommend. For reference I'm 5'7&#34; and 132lbs if that helps."
5.0,"Good fit, great quality for the price."
5.0,They look great but they're a little bit looser than my previous pair. I'm sure if I went down a size they might be uncomfortable. Not sheer. Very comfortable.
5.0,Fit our grandson perfectly.  Nice fabric.
5.0,Perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,These wine glass charms are so cute.  They catch the light beautifully.
5.0,"I ordered the olive color and love it! I will say the photos are misleading as the actual product doesn’t look like the first couple photos. The material is much different and looks like the material in the other color photos. The reviews are right and I did order larger than my normal size cause I wanted a slouchy fit like the photos. I’m 5’4”, 130 lbs, normally wear a small but I ordered a Large. Love the short though and I’m glad I read reviews first!"
5.0,What did I like about this dress?! Everything! It was so perfect for my sister in laws wedding!! I was sooo afraid I wouldn’t be able to fit into it! I was nervous! I have lost over 36 pounds but I was still scared it wouldn’t fit! It fit amazing and everyone was shocked! ♥️I felt sexy!
5.0,The poncho fits nice and makes a nice cute outfit with my riding boots.
5.0,The headline says it all.  These tops are great for at home or weekends and the price is too good to be true but they are great
5.0,"Well made, super cheap, cute fabric and design. A simple way to always carry chapstick."
5.0,"just like normal socks but with toes to prevent blisters, etc."
5.0,"I absolutely loved the feeling of the dress, on the inside and the out. Definitely not a cheap material. This dress would have costed nearly $100 in a store so thank God I got it cheaper here lol! Love the big pockets too."
5.0,Son perfectas para mis pies Yano sufro de pies cansados  a hora estoy mas tinpo disfrutando delas actividades del día
5.0,I purchased this dress to attend a funeral and I am very pleased it fit perfect.  I recommend this dress I was able to wear it right out of the box.
5.0,"As a Jags fan I know we are all easily disappointed and very quick to move past a loss but this hat is a W. Well built, comfortable, and adjustable."
5.0,"After my old pair of chelsea ankle boots crapped out I was on the hunt for a new pair. I'd previously had the Anne Klein Bunty boots and found them great for everyday wear as they were super comfy and easy to walk in, but this time around I wanted to find something just as comfy but with a higher heel and taller on the ankle, and this boot looked perfect!<br /><br />It came much faster than advertised which was awesome and it just looks great. I love the heel and the height, and it goes up higher along the ankle just the way I like it, perfect for tucking in skinny jeans or leggings. It's also very comfy and easy to walk in; I can wear these all day no problem. Rubber sole also provides great grip for slippery walking conditions.<br /><br />All in all, a great find for chelsea ankle boots! I've had these for a few weeks now and I wear them at least a few times a week! Love them :)"
5.0,It fit
5.0,Love it. The stones are secure and it is beautiful.
5.0,"Excelente producto apenas para llevarlo de viaje, pero a veces llega en mal estado y se pierde producto."
5.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. Perfect fit,  elegantly made. I absolutely love it!  I will buy more dresses from this company!"
5.0,Such a cute top to pair with leggings and a denim jacket
5.0,Love the fit.. thicker material. Nice!
5.0,Receive my handbag in perfect conduct. Every part of handbag was protectively covered and I couldn’t be more happy with it. I highly recommended this vendor for Handbags.
5.0,"Like it, the hat is a little bit too long"
5.0,Perfect dress for vacation! Will need to buy in more colors!!
5.0,"Love it, and the rFID part works, I had to take my work ID out to scan it. I am not much of a purse person. I love the red color I chose. This wallet is sleek and fits nicely in my work suit pockets, or when I am casual in my jeans back pocket. Perfect."
5.0,"I agree with the complaint that they are heavy. I find that noticeable when sitting up. When laying on my back I do not notice it.<br /><br />I agree with others that there is too much blocked in the middle but I also found that it does not bother me very much once I've started reading.<br /><br />They seem to make the TV or whatever I'm looking at smaller.<br /><br />They fit over my reading glasses and they are reasonably large framed.<br /><br />I'm pretty happy with them. I'd like to see a product like this with an in-out bridge adjustment. But for under $10! These are excellent. Also the shipping on this product/this link was very fast and that was despite that, because my combined order was high enough, I chose free shipping slowest option."
5.0,Yummy socks so comfy!
5.0,Exlant
5.0,"Love them, but 1 is bent and not sure can be adjusted, but for the price, what the heck, it's still beautiful"
5.0,Cute n comfy!
5.0,"I use this watch to keep track of time while cycling or doing manual labor. Comfortable, lightweight, has a great stopwatch feature. The display is more ""yellow"" than other Casio watches, but that's the only downside."
5.0,I bought these for a Florida trip for the price you can’t go wrong they were absolutely comfortable and fit perfect
5.0,Really good jeans and a unbelievable price I highly recommend these
5.0,Nice biker jacket in plaid for a unique look. Looks great with jeans or a little black dress. And I LOVE that the material has a flattering stretch to it!
5.0,Got this for my daughter and she loved it. It fit perfectly.
5.0,Very comfortable. Lot of room in the crotch for comfort
5.0,"I just got this FABULOUS purse! The design is fashionable, very functional, and gorgeous looking! The color in the picture is the same with the actual color of the purse. It's quite large with lots of pockets! It is made from high quality vegan faux leather! The surface is so smooth and it measures 15.5 inches as its width, with the height of 12.75 inches and 6.5 inches deep. The rounded strap drop is 5.25 inches while the long adjustable and detachable strap measures 44 inches!<br />It came with a very nice Dasein dust bag!<br /><br />It has a decorative padlock partially covered with a vegan faux leather and a nice small key covered with a cute faux leather. The key does not open the padlock though. It has adjustable snap top and zipper closure. The zipper is of good quality.<br /><br />The purse sits on its own and it's not flimsy! It can sit on your arm or you can just put it on the floor of your car. Your laptop will be safe as it is of good quality. I cannot see any loose threads in the lining although the inner lining is not made from a very good fabric but it has been stitched well. The zippered inside pocket has an embossed name &#34;Dasein&#34; on it.<br /><br />The single main compartment is tremendously spacious! It has a big zipper pocket divider and both sides have huge pockets! It has a back interior zippered wall pocket which can accommodate your small wallet and two interior open pockets which can hold your cellphone and headset or keys. The zipper pocket divider is best for your valuables or make-up kit. The exterior back panel zipper pocket can hold your mirror, loose coins or keys. The main compartment was able to hold my ipad 4 and 12-inch McBook Pro!<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, it really looks like an expensive and a designer bag! This is ideal as a gift especially to women who works in the office, a woman who travels a lot and a business women.<br /><br />I highly recommend it! Hope you find my review helpful.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest/unbiased opinion. This is my personal experience and NO payment received for the review."
5.0,"We have a formal occasion coming up so I ended up ordering couple of dresses from Amazon. I am pear shaped with a bit of belly pooch - 12/14 in bottoms and medium/large in tops. I ordered a large in this dress. The top part looks real nice but since it’s a tight fitting dress, my tummy is too much visible. The material didn’t feel cheap, but I wasn’t very comfortable with it. Anyway I ended up returning this dress, but I am sure on the right body, this one would look really look nice."
5.0,Loved my glasses
5.0,"With this durable belt,, You get what you paid for and then some. The hidden away compartment with basic survival items is pretty ingenious. The belt is the backup to my 6"" x 4"" EMS pouch, which needs restocking."
5.0,"I love this shirt.  It’s not thin or thick- just perfect.  Very flattering with my Covid-19 weight.  I have gotten many compliments on it!  It’s so soft and cozy , like a buttery texture, but not sheer.  Good fabric, well made and can be dressed up or down.  I stumbled in this , checked reviews and got in my favorite color for summer.  Planning on adding a couple more in other colors.  You will not be sorry!!"
5.0,I'm 5' 5&#34; and 140 lbs. I found these to be a little high waisted in the front and long in the legs but neither of these really made an effect on how great they fit otherwise. Definitely one of the better clothing purchases I've made from Amazon.
5.0,I bought this for a friend and it fit perfectly and looked great.
5.0,"Great sun glasses, work well for golf and driving."
5.0,Obsessed with this! About to buy two more. I live changing out all my stones depending on which one I’m feeling for the day. It’s great and a sturdy product.
5.0,"I was very upset when I lost one of my beloved ruby earrings.  I looked through a few jewelry stores at the mall, but didn't see anything I liked nearly as much.  Looking on Amazon just as a fluke, I was surprised to see this lovely pair oof earrings.  They look a bit like the old pair, only better.  I love them!"
5.0,"great product not too heavy.<br />They are rather large, but I love them!<br />Great statement piece"
5.0,These are great little boxes.  We use them all the time when packing things to take out on the boat.  I have used these at least once a week since I purchased them and they are holding up great.  Very convenient
5.0,"Nice ring, fast shipping"
5.0,It’s a thin material but not see through. Very stretchy and comfortable. You can dress it up or down. It was perfect.
5.0,Darling!
5.0,Fits like it should and is just what I expected.
5.0,"This is a beautiful shirt and made Nicely, but it has a plastic care instructions tag sown into the inside lining of the shirt that when left or cut out continues to rub and stick you against your skin. The manufacturer should have used a cotton tag. Even After I cut the tag out due to being stitched into shirt which cannot be fully removed. Extremely annoying and rubs against your skin. I had to have removed by a seamstress and sowed closed, this cost me time and money so it can be worn comfortably. Shame on the manufacture for using cheap plastic tags not soft cotton ones. Other than that a beautiful shirt and a good price."
5.0,"My wife really likes this. It's a flattering, loose fitted top with a cool, unique ruffled pocket on the front. My wife is very petite and ordered the smallest size (S). It turned out to be a good fit for a casual look. The fabric is somewhat thick, so it may not be appropriate for summer wear in warm climates. It's been comfortable for my wife for mild/average temperatures where we live during our mild winter (60s to 70s). Overall, at under a $20, it's a nice top for women looking for something unique and comfortable but not crazy."
5.0,Very simple and just perfect for a young girl!
5.0,"I was confused because it came in a small package, but what a set! These ties, links and pins are perfect! I wore them for my wedding ceremony and it looked amazing. Great quality products!"
5.0,"I love muscle shirts.  This is my favorite muscle shirt of all time.  I bought this shirt at Walmart for $6.24; it was a steal at that price.  Some scumbag in London stole my shirt from the hostel dryers.  I re-bought it for $25.00 on Amazon because I love it that much.  Unless you're REALLY into well-fitting muscle shirts, I would never spend more than $10 on one.  But this one is worth it!"
5.0,S8 Plus won't fit with a case. Too bad. I really love this.
5.0,"This band looks great and is very comfortable. I just wish it closed like the Apple brand bands do instead of having the metal piece shown in the picture. With that being said, it is still my favorite band."
5.0,"Perfect size and color. Simple and classy. Keep in mind that it is a clutch, so it's not going to hold alot, just the bare necessities, but it is lovely. I'm very pleased."
5.0,Great Job
5.0,Book bag I crochet
5.0,Fit nicely. It was suggested to get a size bigger. I agree
5.0,Loved it . fit great
5.0,"The cap and the dozen cans of Moxie are great! My husband loves the stuff. I hate it, Ugh! And I’m the one from Maine.<br />Ay-yuh!! It was his birthday gift. Bought separately. I recommend them. Perfect for any man cave."
5.0,Love them! Perfect for my kids who love Fortnite.
5.0,Beautiful just Beautiful Thank you so much
5.0,A great set of two pairs of earrings for a great price. They are nicely made with a hand-crafted look and the linear look is flattering. I'd buy more of Spunky Soul earrings!
5.0,Really nice costume great quality
5.0,Love this dress. So comfy. Might order another one.
5.0,"I wanted a replacement strap for my citizen watch. I found this, not exactly what I was looking for, but quite close. Worth the money."
5.0,I have these shorts in different colors and I wish Style&Co still made them.they are comfortable and I love them
5.0,"So far so good with this, I like that all of my keys are now organized. It took a bit of experimenting to get both sides equal height, and with the keys I have it was easier to stack them and then gap with the washers. Plenty of washers included which is nice. Can't attest to the durability yet, but hopefully it lasts for a while."
5.0,I now have several of these tops. Love the fit and style. Perfect for sports or everyday wear. Always looks nice.
5.0,It just feels good against my body.
5.0,"I got three different pair of Ohpink earrings, and I have to say in all three cases, these earrings are prettier in real life than their pictures. They are nicely made, have cute designs, and are simply very pretty earrings. These are much nicer than what I was expecting. I love the designs and the stones are just enough without being too much.<br /><br />I cannot judge the hypoallergenic/sensitive ear quality of the hooks, because I switch all hooks out to niobium or titanium due to allergies to certain metals.<br /><br />I can’t say much more than if you think these are cute in the pictures, go for it, because they are much nicer in real life. Very pleased with the look and quality of these earrings.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

5.0,"This sweater is perfect for layering. I wear a small in most tops & sweaters. Ordered a small, fits loose and a little larger but exactly what I wanted. It's not too thin or too thick, perfect for Texas weather. Got the mauve color and I will be ordered the khaki color one too. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I’m a professional singer/dancer, and I was looking for a professional grade fishnet tights that was less expensive than the major brands. These are fantastic! I’ll be ordering more."
5.0,"I LOVE this jumpsuit!  Thick material, plenty of fringe...a showstopper.  It is long, but I appreciated that (I’m 5’6” and wore it with 4” heels).  I had to trim the front at the bottom, but that was no problem.  The lace up top is too loose and flappy, but racking it down did the trick.  I also sewed bra cups inside. One of my favorite all-time Amazon purchased!"
5.0,"I love it.  The thickenss and color are perfect, red color is not too bright.  The shipment came in with a coupon good for next purchase.  Will definitely order again from these seller."
5.0,I love these socks. I have already gotten a second pair. They keep the swelling away & support my calves & ankles so that I can walk longer than usual.  I first got them for a plane flight but really enjoy wearing them when on my feet a lot.
5.0,I love this shirt it help me out alot
5.0,Everything was great. Bought this as a gift for my teenage nephew and he loved it. The chain length was good. He hasn't taken it off since he got it. Thanks.

5.0,"super cute, exactly as dcribed"
5.0,"The only complaint I have is that the beads are not individually knotted.  That’s really important when you’re using this for its intended purpose.<br />Good quality for the price.<br />If you plan to wear this as a bracelet, take into consideration that the talisman is going to dangle a bit."
5.0,"Goodness, I just love them. I have a small-ish sized head and they are perfect for me--not too big at all. Though there's a little give in the frames to accommodate bigger heads. With no annoying nose pads, they're very comfortable. The floral design is just so darling and vintage too--the exact &#34;hipster&#34; look I was going for! I love that they're clear and UV protective, so I can wear them inside or out!"

5.0,Really nice ring...I wear it on my thumb and it is perfect.
5.0,This is absolutely a wonderful and warm nightgown. Plan on getting another next month
5.0,This purse is perfect for me. I'm a mom of two toddlers and I need something I won't be afraid of throwing around and something that has plenty of space. And it's actually nicer than I thought it would be and seems very durable. I'm glad I decided to buy this!
5.0,"I have another of the same item, with different magnification factor; different colors makes it easy for me to see which is which.<br />The temples have sliders with detentes for sizing the head loop. My head is medium-sized, and these get just about big enough for me. Those with large heads may not like them."
5.0,"Love it. Good quality, doesn't feel cheap, has lasted well and zippers still work. No frayed edges. Worth it!"
5.0,Perfect fit!  Love the color and it's warm & toasty.
5.0,Cute and surprisingly durable. Much better than I expected it would be.
5.0,Navy is my color.  This dress is so pretty.  It fit exactly as I expected to.
5.0,Variado
5.0,I purchased this product for me. And I loved it and I actually bought myself another one
5.0,Every thing was just fine!
5.0,"I got this for my son, so it is a little big, but he will grow into it.  He absolutely loves it and it kept him very warm in NYC"
5.0,The color and fit are perfect!
5.0,I have not personally used these as I gave them to my sister in law for my niece that has yet to be born! But the pattern was great and the fabric felt great as well. Good quality.
5.0,"This is a very durable, stylish case with a soft cleaning cloth included.  Good buy for the price."
5.0,Looks so nice.
5.0,"Super soft, love that’s it’s very light and breathable fabric. Perfect for summer. I would order up to be safe but it fits as expected. Be sure to not shrink it in the wash."
5.0,Great quality and comfort!<br /><br />I wear a large and so glad I ordered XL as they run a size small.
5.0,"It fit perfectly in XL and the style conceals midsection plumpness very well. Very flattering! I love the style so much, I wish it was available in other colors. I'd by them all!"
5.0,The watch is really cool looking. I have never had a watch that had where you usually find the date but here instead you have the seconds running! That makes it very unique and the only watch I have that has this feature.
5.0,Comfy and looks great wish for more colors in this shirt I love it👍
5.0,Been looking for a decent hoodie and I’ve found it.  Nice fit and size was perfect
5.0,Awesome wallet the husband loved it
5.0,"Nice trucker hat. Blue is not as bright as shown, which I I like better anyways!"
5.0,"I love these boots. They are super comfy after breaking them in and I love the look of them. The top can be folded or unfolded, both ways look real good. The quality is excellent just like all Chaco products. I would buy this shoe again a million times over."
5.0,I got this for my granddaughters recent wedding. Perfect color (dark green) but it had more of a deep blue undertone which was exactly what I needed.<br />Great stretch not sheer at all. Only problem was I found 2 small cuts in the dress near the side seam  didn’t notice until half way thru the wedding.<br />The dress overall is very nice and would recommend
5.0,Liked price
5.0,"I wear a lot of Eileen Fisher, but this top is a very large Medium"
5.0,Very pleased with these sunglasses that fit over my prescription glasses.
5.0,"I am not sure why people are saying these are too small, they absolutely run large. I need tight tanks for hot yoga and I am picky about fit- it's not easy to find affordable tanks that check all the boxes for me, and these are great. They do not ride up, and are plenty long enough for those of us with long torsos, and the price is right. I am usually a medium and got the small, so they fit perfect for my needs. As for flattering, They are tight. But comfortable! Buy cotton or something else if you're concerned with how they look- these are for working out."
5.0,I really like this cap.  Fits perfectly on head and under bike helmet. Slits for glasses are perfect.  I have started using under my golf cap for cold rounds of golf.
5.0,"good quality, worth the price!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress!<br /><br />The colors on this dress are vibrant and each one brings out the color of the others. There is a mix of reds, greens, browns, white and turquoise.<br />The material is soft and stretchy. Because the skirt is round and expands at the bottom, it stays cool enough to be a year round dress. You could also wear a petticoat under it for an extra fancy look. And with all the colors you can wear it with so many different color cardigans or shoes. This is a nice versatile dress.<br /><br />I bought the size large. I am 5’3 and it goes below my knees. The dress is 38 ½ inches long from the shoulder to the hem. There are breast pleats that make it a little stretchier in the breast area for larger sized women. I am not large in that area, more average, but I love the modesty of the neck, I can bend over without worrying I’m going to expose myself to the world.<br /><br />The back zipper extends down the whole torso area and about 4 inches into the skirt, so it is easy to take on and off, plus it’s a hidden zipper so it still looks good in the back.  There is a 1 ¾ inch waist band in the front that stops on the sides where the 1 inch ties are connected (the ties expand to the 1 ¾ inches on the tapered ends.<br /><br />This dress is well made, the stitching is tight and there are no snags on the dress. The zipper goes up and down easily. If you are thinking of buying, I would recommend it!<br /><br />I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The opinion is my own and not persuaded in any way.  I often purchase items from Amazon myself and rely on the reviews of others."
5.0,"My husband loves these long johns.. material is soft, and keep him warm, They hold their shape. Second pair he’s purchased...Awesome product so far.."
5.0,Loved the boots but they were too small.  I followed what people said in the reviews that they ran big so I ordered a half size down.  It's more like they run small and should have ordered up a full size.
5.0,These have worked well. Easy to use and product was delivered as described.
5.0,Looks like picture! True to size.
5.0,It was better than expected!! I love it and it fits perfectly

5.0,Product is elegant and looks good. Chain is light and pendent is beautiful and shiny.
5.0,Very well made!!!
5.0,"When I bought these cufflinks as a birthday gift for my son, I also bought a second pair from Quality Stays, because Amazon was offering free shipping over a certain purchase threahold.  I'm glad I bought them, as they are not only great quality links, but I now have another fantastic gift for my son (that I know he will love) during the holiday season!!!<br /><br />And DUH - I should have bought an extra pair for myself!"
5.0,Soooo soft! Love it!
5.0,"I bought a few pajamas on here on the same day. These are the softest most killer set of them all. you will not be disappointed. I have big boobs btw...C/D and the X-large is pretty big. it's roomy and ok for pjs, but just be aware. X large is really x large. if you are on the fence, you can probably chance the smaller size unless you want them roomy."
5.0,Exactly what was expected with very fast shipping.
5.0,Great fit. Love the length and the pockets
5.0,TOO CUTE FOR WORDS!!!!
5.0,Obsessed

5.0,"Super well made, my 1 1/2 year old sun wear 6 I bought 6.5 for him to wear them longer and they fit great just big enough, and materials is great. Super cute, they come in a cut box also"
5.0,"Like the looks of it, the texture of the leather and the color.  The absolute best is the choice of strap length and the way changes in length is accomplished."
5.0,Great hoodie. Nice deep purple. Got a XL for oversized fit.
5.0,It's pretty.  Perfect for my sweaters.  Gives them a dressed up look when I want to change it up a bit.
5.0,They are so cute and awesome!!!
5.0,Just as described.  Came quickly and looks great.
5.0,I have had my SPY+ for 4+ years now.  Replaced the lenses and I can say HUGE difference.  Very clear and much better than what was there.  Definitely replacing my other sunglasses.
5.0,I wore  this dress in a summer wedding this past weekend.  It was perfect and I received so many compliments on it.  It's so soft and it flows so well.  Perfect for every day as well. So comfortable

5.0,I got these for my niece’s birthday. She was thrilled because they didn’t fall off! They’re really cute and definitely worth the money.
5.0,"In my opinion this is a great bra.. and if u hate seeing those little bulges behind and under pit , the. This is the bra for you.. I’m regular a 38b got the 40a/b and it fit like a charm.. smoothed out my back and holds the girls up.. lol.. great quality.. even greater price.. i think in done with Victoria secret.. this is my new bra.. oh and the straps are nice and thick making great shoulder support..."
5.0,the necklace i ordered came exactly the day it said it would be delivered. it even came in a cute little tulle bag. colors on the necklace match the colors shown online.
5.0,"Love it. It was easy to wear and perfect for a derby party I attended, great price, too. I was delighted that it came in a box and was immediately ready to wear, nothing was flattened, wrinkled or crushed."
5.0,"I buy allot of sweatshirts always looking for that perfect one. For me, this is that perfect one. It's warm and super comfy. It's got an actual YKK zipper. Pockets and a hood for when you want to turtle. Drawstrings to twiddle with or chew on as you please. I wouldn't wear it on an expedition to Antarctica or anything, but it's great for chilly weather or those cold winter nights around the house. It always seems to be the most reasonably priced sweatshirts that end up being the best."
5.0,Anti fog and suction power is perfect
5.0,I recommend it.
5.0,Love these! Soft and perfect fit
5.0,it's beautiful and good quality. I love it 👍
5.0,I was very happy with this purchase. My daughter has worn it numerous times and it keeps it shape and color. The red looks beautiful on her. The fabric is soft and I have heard no complaints from her that it is itchy or too tight. It has become her favorite dress to wear to class. She wears a 6 and this fit her perfectly.
5.0,"Great shirt I wear it all the time,  i'm obsessed with the style,  so whenever I'm feeling down I need to purchase something to make myself feel better,  this usually always ends up in my Amazon cart in different color."
5.0,Love these fit overs! They are stylish and fit over my new glass perfectly. I have 4 pairs of them. As I do not like transition lenses these are much safer and look great and incredibly affordable!!
5.0,Very very comfortable!
5.0,My nephew loved them.
5.0,Very pretty.  Good quality
5.0,"Best fit and feels great, already using my 3 pairs for almost a month<br /><br />Comfortable on my feet and relaxing"

5.0,These bolo ties are great and shipping speed was too. Thanks to a great seller!
5.0,Pretty cloak...perfect for halloween!<br />I was afraid to be too short but it wasn’t!
5.0,Daughter loved it! Thanks
5.0,"These are almost a little big. The little ""bead"" or nub on the end of the bone is a bit bigger than on others, so that it is snug and a little hard to get through my nose. The bone itself is a proper 18g.  It takes a bit of pulling to get it out. On the upside to that snug fit, it won't fall out easily. I ordered the 3 pack, and got a few gift, a pretty simple little white crystal stone, that's bone style as well. Love it."
5.0,Excellent fit perfect and adapted my fat belly to my old kilt
5.0,"Very high quality product, nicely made, will last, quality materials"
5.0,Package arrived right on time.  After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried about the fit but it fit perfectly!  I'm a bigger women usually wear size 1x to 2 x.  I ordered a 3x figured with something like this I'm probably better off with it being too big than too small.  I currently weight 259 pounds and I'm 5 foot 8 inches tall.  It's very comfortable and light weight!
5.0,Love it chain is to short for a man 6 CM or 23'
5.0,Great boot
5.0,My daughter loves these earrings. I think they're beautiful too.
5.0,it's just as pictured-- comfy and cute
5.0,"I have trouble feeling the brake pedal.  The form of these shoes, with the upper wrapped around the bottom of the foot and fastened to the sole underneath, amplifies the feeling of contact, because the sole moves as a flexible unit.  I ordered a second pair immediately."
5.0,These are the only earrings that have managed to stay in my daughters ears more than a week.
5.0,I bought these to wear with Camo leggings. Cute as expected.
5.0,PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND THIS WAS A REPURCHASE
5.0,I would definitely recommend this because they fit great and they are very stylish!
5.0,My boyfriend and I met so many new people at festivals because they wanted to draw on this shirt! Super fun!
5.0,Exactly what I needed!  I avoided having to purchase a new market umbrella when this lower pieces was all that was needed.
5.0,I love this and have nothing bad to say. Great quality and came fast and is not as big as it appears in the photo.
5.0,My husband has edema and the doctor recommended compression socks to help prevent swelling.  he is amazed how wearing these very comfortable and easy to put on socks prevents his foot and ankle from swelling up.  He hardly has to take Lasix now.
5.0,Comfy fabric vintage style day dress that doesn’t wrinkle too easy. I loved it so much I ordered the yellow too. Great fit for us girls who doesn’t fit into vintage petite sizes.
5.0,"2nd time we have purchased these mask.  They are great, easily cleaned and last quite awhile.  Thanks"
5.0,"Very cute jacket just a little too snug. If it was a 1X petite, it would be a perfect. Gave it to my daughter, she loves it and fits great."
5.0,"I bought this jacket because it was cute and waterproof! Plus, I like the larger pockets, double zipper, buttons at the hips, and zippers on the sleeves. Fun and utilitarian features. I thought it was a little bit snug across the shoulders, but not enough to want to go up a size."
5.0,"Quite possibly my most favorite bathing suit I’ve ever owned. Not kidding. High neck is very “in” right now so, given the price, I decided to give this one a chance. And I am so glad I did. This bathing suit is extremely comfortable and I really like the peace of mind knowing that “the girls” are in place and covered at all times. I also love that the pattern/colors are so vibrant, especially when you’ve got a nice tan going on! For reference: I’m 5’4, 140lbs (w/ a little extra hips & butt), 36C, ordered a Large and it truly fits like a glove. Ordering another suit right after I finish this review!"
5.0,"I have had a Screamer brand hat for 8 years and it still looks like new. I bought this one just to have another because they are my favorite hats. They fit snug on my small head, without a bunch of extra fabric making me look like a cone head on top, and they are SUPER warm because the ear band area is fleece lined. Absolutely the best winter hats around."
5.0,Belt is great ...
5.0,"I always get compliments on this bag, it’s perfect!"
5.0,"Beautiful!<br />Good, fast communication from the seller.<br />USPS delivered to wrong address and seller had a good communication to resolve the issues."

5.0,They work perfectly! Easy to insert and comfortable fit
5.0,"My granddaughter, likes it, wears it often."
5.0,My son wanted to be slender man for Halloween. He wasn’t able to see out of it very well for trick or treating. Not very well during the day either. But it looked great for pics!
5.0,NICE TOP AND GOOD QUALITY.
5.0,"I love that this is a lose dress and that it has a handy pocket on each side. Since I have a wide torso and heavy arms I bought a 3XL and it feels very comfortable, I don't like tight clothes. I normally wear a 2X in plus size (194 lb). I bought 2 in multicolor and 1 dark green one. I like the multicolored ones than the green one. I washed them all in a gentle cycle. The colorful ones came out as new. The solid color one had a very light change which may be considered a very slight pilling."
5.0,So good quality! I just love it! I use it everyday and receiving so many complements!<br />I 100% recommend this product!
5.0,My hubby loves these
5.0,"I’ve been eyeing this for a while on techcandy.com but the shipping was just too much so when I saw that I can get it with my prime I jumped. I love this little thing it gets tangled up in my purse straps a lot, but it really comes in handy when trying to dig through my neverfull. I’ll probably end up buying one for each bag because it’s easier than untangling it in reattaching. This brand has so much cute stuff and I am so happy to see them on Amazon because they’re shipping on their website was always so high and deterred me from buying."
5.0,These are nice! And super pretty 😍
5.0,Beautiful color and looks great!
5.0,Comfortable right from the start!! I have arthritis in my feet and need support but I hate to also trade fashion for function. These are both!
5.0,"The colors are just as pictured. I like the shirt, it is unusual and I'm not likely to see anyone else wearing it. It washes and goes in the dryer then on the hanger ready to wear."
5.0,Great product. Thick fabric. Love the detail. Shipping was so fast
5.0,Affordable and for just as expected for a Halloween costume.
5.0,I love them! Good quality. Good packaging.
5.0,Love these! Fashionable and great shape!
5.0,"These shorts are great for running and playing basketball. I was worried about the material as I sweat a lot when I am running, especially for legs and hips. However these shorts are made with good material so I wound not feel uncomfortable when I am running. Great product."
5.0,FEEL GREAT
5.0,Great EDC belt at a fraction of the cost of name brand belts. Very good stiffness for supporting a concealed carry pistol and even strong enough to hold up a full size duty pistol. The buckles are durable and you need to operate the locking device frequently to wear it in so it's not a struggle to adjust the size. Great value. Will buy in different colors.
5.0,I loved this mask! I felt beautiful wearing it and it was perfect for the event I was attending. The shipping was fast too!
5.0,"Bought this watch for my lady. Then she claims it's too heavy on her wrist... Ok, whatever... Looks just fine on mine 🙂<br />Added to my collection."
5.0,"Bought it as a gift, but it looked great on her."
5.0,"Nice sunglasses for the price. Protects from the sun, and some bling too. Comfortable, they don't hurt my ears like a lot of sunglasses. I got the black with smoke lens. For the price you can't go wrong. Probably will be back for more!"
5.0,Awesome quality.<br />These were replacing a $350 pair that I busted and this was a quick fix. These are lighter and seem to be much better.
5.0,"I use these when I am doing permanent makeup as I don’t want the pigment to get on my arms. Works well, stays put!"
5.0,This was really awesome and fit as expected the description was off about the leather knee patches
5.0,"Fast shipping, quality product, works great for my 2 year old"
5.0,I wear my SGF every day... Love it
5.0,Great fit. Stretches and confirms nicely.
5.0,I have ordered these twice. Both in a large and xl and I would suggest sizing up from your regular size. I normally wear a large but but the xl fit the best. These are amazing. They wash and wear wonderfully and I’ve had little to no fading. I will purchase again.
5.0,Lite weight but warm
5.0,Like visor hat because it covers ears.
5.0,I have gotten several tops like this that looked great online but once I got them they were to snug on top.  This one was perfect!  I love it.
5.0,"Such a GORGEOUS necklace! Amazing quality. Don't sleep on this, get it!! I'm sooo happy and am going to buy the silver one now ! Definitely my favorite necklace!! The size of the 🦋 is perfect."

5.0,Loved this! Wore it as my wedding dress!!!
5.0,"What I like most about these, is the thick sole. Makes them super soft and comfy to walk on. Some slippers are so thin, but these are fantastic!"
5.0,"I was impressed. Bought it for my mom. She was very happy with the fit and the price! It’s slimming and it has an elegant style. She didn’t want to spend $200 in a dress you only wear once. This dress met all her requirements and with the right shoes and jewelry, she will feel very confident the night of the event."
5.0,"I just received this bag and I am already in love! It's huge and the colors are gorgeous. It seems to be made of really quality materials and feels very sturdy. I hope it will hold up like I think. I originally bought a different bag from another company but when it arrived, it was not what the picture had shown. So I returned and ordered this one and I am so glad I did! The price was a little higher than I had wanted to pay but the bag is worth it. I can't wait to use this for my beach trip next week! I also plan to use as my carry on bag for my trip to Mexico next month as the size should work perfectly and fit everything I need."
5.0,perfect for a tall man

5.0,My daughter loves her new seat cover.
5.0,"Great shirt,  fits as expected,  did fade alittle in wash so wash on delicate."
5.0,"I bought this dress for Easter and I love it!  I am pairing it with a black cardigan.  I am 5'2&#34; with an athletic build.  The dress comes about 2&#34; below my knees.  Sometimes clothing purchases can be tricky on Amazon, so I bought a size up (Large) but I think a medium would have been just fine.  The dress flows, but the fabric is thick-good for an outing where you might get caught in a Spring rain.  Forgot the belt, so no comment on that, but I really like it!  Great colors-the reds pop against the black."
5.0,Right to the fit

5.0,Everything is okay.

5.0,Great quality and great value.  These stay up all day with no issue and they are wonderfully comfortable.  So much better than pantyhose.  They are also extremely durable and get fewer runs than any other brand I have tried.

5.0,"I really like this dress. It is very trendy and looks like something that you would find in a cute clothing boutique. The material is very soft and comfortable and it looks great on. It washes well and dries well, but I prefer to lay it flat to dry.<br /><br />For the sizing, I would say that it is true to size, and you can order your normal size in this dress. I absolutely love it!"

5.0,The pocket in the back is great they are cool and comfortable
5.0,Super cute!<br />More light weight than expected but good fit.

5.0,Classy little balls
5.0,Absolutely love it! Medium fits me perfect!
5.0,"I love this shirt. It's extremely comfortable and the fit is quite flattering on my curvy figure. The sequins certainly lend a bit of flash, which for me is perfect, and the rest of the shirt is sedate enough that you don't feel like a walking disco ball. I've received many compliments wearing this, and I'm planning to buy additional colors."
5.0,These are so cute and easy to get on and off.  They do seem to run very big though. We'll hang onto them until the fit.

5.0,High quality product. Try to size. My daughter loves it! Service was excellent: delivered earlier than expected.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this ring! My husband gave it to me for Christmas 2 years ago and ever since I wore it just about every day. It did take a bit of getting used to because the band is indeed very thick but I received so many compliments every every day, it has been hard to get myself to wear a different ring. I love the fact that it is adjustable, during the very hot summer months when my hands swelled I never needed to take it off.<br />If you like heavy, bold, draw attention type rings then you probably won't be dissappointed."
5.0,"This is perfect, I love having different color bands when it comes to matching my outfits for the gym."
5.0,excellent very comfortable
5.0,"Love it! Looks great with jeans,flip flops and a scarf, or with a Maxi skirt. I have 3 of these now and am tempted to buy one in every color. My only tip would be to definately hang dry to keep it looking nice."
5.0,"good buy, great price"
5.0,It is exactly what was expected from a Casio watch. My daughter loves it and wear it everyday.
5.0,I love these socks! My baby is a chunker and all socks are SO tight. These have just the right amount of stretch and don't hurt his legs. Glad I found these!!
5.0,"Great colors, great fit, don't retain smell, just what I was looking for."

5.0,"The leather is very high-quality, pleasantly surprised at the price point ."
5.0,Pretty; Good value; works great with oils. Retains smell for hours.
5.0,I like the anti fog spray because it does help to prevent my glasses from fogging when I need to go out with a mask on. It was pretty frustrating having to deal with fogged up glasses while wearing a mask. I am happy I found this product!
5.0,Snuggly soft and simply sassy. Fans of Harley Quinn will enjoy cozying up for the winter in these comfy duds.
5.0,Fit great hold up well
5.0,Kept me organized all Year long
5.0,"I got this necklace to use the pendant as a keychain charm for a friend for Christmas, so I can't speak to the sturdiness of the necklace portion itself. The pendant, however, is a decent weight (I don't think it would be cumbersome to wear) and I think will handle well being jostled around."
5.0,This dress fits beautifully! It is so comfortable! I know this is a dress I will wear many times!
5.0,Great belt. Easy to adjust and looks great
5.0,"Sits very awkwardly on my neck, not sure if it’s generally too big or if that’s just design…<br />that’s the only part that disappoints me, but overall it’s okay!! Great with cosplay looks"
5.0,"This backpack is enormous, is perfect for what I want it. Will update for durability once used, but seem good quality is very spacious. I’m taking a 7day trip and wanted a backpack like this so I don’t have to carry any additional luggage, easily will fit everything I need for this trip."
5.0,Very nice. True to picture and size.
5.0,"I've searched and searched for a leather glove that I like and fits me.  This is it!!  It is a classic glove, no buttons, zippers, frills and won't go out of style.  I am 5'2&#34; and have short fingers.  A lot of other gloves are way too long for my fingers.  These are still a little long but a much better fit for me since I'm short."
5.0,"Wife loved them, only sunglasses she likes."
5.0,My Wife loves these earrings. She says they are beautiful and very easy to put on and take off.
5.0,"The earrings are a little larger than what I was looking for, but I am keeping them because they are very nice and they were an excellent price. Had been looking for some like this for a while.  Thanks ZEN Jewelry and Amazon."
5.0,"This dress is lovely! I am 5ft 3in, 160lbs. I purchased a medium. I needed to wear a small heel so it didn’t drag. The material is nice and light without looking cheap. The pockets are awesome and I wore it to work with a white sweater to dress it up."
5.0,"This is Suzanne's husband...I purchased this ring as a spare to my &#34;good&#34; wedding ring..<br />Man!  I love this ring!  I wear a ring size 12, ordered this in a 12 and it fits great!  Solid with<br />some weight to it.. This ring in no way looks like it should be as cheap as it is!  Very much worth the money!!"

5.0,It fits well & looks very good.  Its not a fleece type thick sweatshirt but the quality is good. There is a little stretch to the fabric.
5.0,Got this for my daughters birthday and she loves it
5.0,It was exactly what I wanted. It was used to pull a name out of a hat for a raffle. I would say it’s medium sized
5.0,Scored on this great gift!!!
5.0,"Simple cuteness. Just enough reveal, and the material makes it fall nicely!"

5.0,I received so many compliments all night!

5.0,"I feel much better wearing a $150 watch and not being so conscious about scratching it or wearing as my ""every-day"" watch.<br />This watch has 98% of the features that were on my previous $400+ watch(PRW-50YFE-2AJR). Some of the features that were on my previous ""PRW-50"" were, a double led light, Needle position automatic correction function, a softer band and maybe a ""tougher"" glass. Some of  things I like about the PRW-3100 are/is, price, sunset/sunrise time and I find it easier to navigate compare to the PRW-50. I also found my self calibrating the compass on both watches frequently, must be a normal thing.. idk.<br /><br />I would recommend this watch to friends and family.<br /><br />Screen protector size: 32mm"
5.0,They fit perfect. Very cute
5.0,Great! Will buy again!
5.0,Got this cap a few days ago and have worn it twice - once for a 3-mile walk in the misting rain and once for a 3-mile walk in the sun.  I love it!  It fits my head better than any cap I've ever owned.  It was great in the misting rain and protected my eyes from the sun.  It wasn't too tight and didn't feel like it was going to fly off.  I actually forgot I was wearing it.  I love the color and the design.  The adjustability is great.  Wish I could wear it at work.  I highly recommend it.
5.0,Came in super fast and fits just perfectly
5.0,Used it in my hot yoga class. Love it.
5.0,This was a gift to a family member and they can't stop looking at it. Thanks for the promise of the price and the promised date.

5.0,"I only used them 1 time under heavy rain,  hands completely DRY...little be bulky for my test"

5.0,It is a nice light weight.  Perfect for spring and fall!
5.0,I thought the necklace would turn my neck green cause it was fake but it’s hasn’t and I’ve showered with it on never turned green

5.0,Definitely easy to assemble kids loved the hats no problems with it!
5.0,Really nice and big. Much better than the pink one that is sold in stores. But purchase I have made in a long time

5.0,Small piece.
5.0,"Super cute top, super comfortable, and great design. Love wearing all the time, great match with legging and jean, wearing for all activity and using it as normal wear out top. If you are searching for a cute and comfortable top, this would be the best choice! Will recommended to all my friend."
5.0,Bag is beautiful!
5.0,"When I first pulled this out of the package I was impressed at the quality of the cardigan. It looked smaller than my size. Once I opened it up and unbuttoned the sweater and tried it on, it fit perfectly. I am creating my wardrobe for my career as a librarian. I only wore it once and have gotten many compliments."
5.0,Very sturdy earrings and with a light blingy touch. Great for the price since my daughter always loses her earrings. Would recommend them for an adult too since they are not too small.
5.0,Comfy sweatshirt with great message!
5.0,So worth it! My husband had it put on him after surgery!<br />He said that it is very soft and comfortable.<br />Much better than cutting the sleeves out of his tee shirts. Washes easily
5.0,Fabric is super soft and color very vibrant! My daughter loves it. The print does not peel off or look cheap! Good buy!
5.0,"The color states burgundy. These are burgundy. Unfortunately I read a review that said they were rust, which is what I really needed. Not the color I wanted but the color they stated."
5.0,It was great on my Kids
5.0,"I'm really happy with these.  They don't slip off at all.  The only issue i have with these is that they come up a little to high for one pair of my mary janes, but i use the twist method and it fixes the problem."
5.0,I bought these for my husband who absolutely loves them.  He wants to replace all his socks with these. He has trouble with feet being hot and sweaty in his shoes but has cold feet when sitting without shoes.  These socks work for both

Very hot for the summer, no good for commuting by bike, but I think in the winter I'll be wearing them much much more.  Yes. the waist is small and the hips are big -- keep that in mind when choosing your size."
5.0,"I absolutely love these earings and the quality of the craftsmanship!  And the note included and a map of where my pair was made was so nice to receive, along with the extra earring backs.  I'll definitely be ordering from you again. Thank you!"
5.0,"I’m in LOVE with this dress. It’s simple, yet elegant. It’s extremely comfortable and isn’t see through. I ordered the maroon color for our holiday photos this year and it’s true to the color in the photo. Also fits as expected - I ordered the XL, I’m 5’6” & 185 lbs. Fabric doesn’t stretch much but the tie front is extremely flattering and makes you feel confident wearing it. I’ll be wearing this for our thanksgiving festivities this year, as well. Super versatile and cute! Worth every penny."

5.0,These do the job and pretty comfortable to wear. Nice having the ear plugs attached to the strap. Would recommend
5.0,"I was so excited to get some extra bands for my new Alta. These are great. The color selection is right on, and they snap in just like the one that came with the FitBit. I also love the small loops that hold the long strap end tight to the other strap end. I have a large size FitBit but was just barely too large for the smaller one, so I have the excess strap length. Very satisfied with this product."
5.0,Espectacular!!
5.0,"This is a VERY well made jacket & worth the money..<br />BUT..it is not ""true to size""  I even measured me...<br />I am a lady & in a mens size jacket I wear a XL...I had to return my XL, I reordered a 2XL & it still does not fit me. about 4 inches too small around my waist & the sleeves are apprx 2 inches too long...<br />(,Buyers please order a larger size to fit properly)<br />Im scheduled to go to car shows with my Corvette so I am highly disappointed in the sizing but not the jacket...<br />I wish this company would make it good, I quickly need a ""3XL""<br />Thank you!"
5.0,My 6 year old loves it. He's collecting them.
5.0,I need two different size shoes due to polio.  The large size 12 that turns out to be a 11.5 fits perfectly but the size nine is to big feels like size 11.  There are no marking on the shoes to indicate size
5.0,Love it. Wear it all over!
5.0,"This shirt looks really good, fits great and feel great. A bit snug but overall fits nicely! I would recommend this to others! I ordered a small and I’m 5’2, 108lbs."
5.0,"There was a mix up, but it was promptly taken care of.  The purse is  gift, and I am sure that the recipient will enjoy and love it."

5.0,These were given as a gift. She was very pleased with them.
5.0,"Love them, I already ordered another pair. I am 5’5 an 120lbs they fit as expected. Waist is high and snug but as far as keeping everything snug and “control fit” in the butt and legs it’s not so much. Still very comfortable and flattering."
5.0,"This night shirt can easily become my favorite! It is made of high quality cotton and is beautifully sewn. It fits perfectly and washed very well in warm water and dried in the dryer on ""low"" without shrinking. I am very pleased with it and can highly recommend it!"

5.0,Muy facil de usar

5.0,"Arrived fast, good quality, thank you!"
5.0,This is cute and fits well.
5.0,I gifted it to my brother and he just loves it .
5.0,"It was so easy to put on. I’m using this after a lower body lift. After it’s on, you can adjust it tighter with the secondary belt. It’s all extremely convenient. The only think that is slightly annoying is that it isn’t breathable at all, so it can get a little warm."
5.0,"Although a little bit pricey for what is basically a giant sized poster and stickers, this product turned out to be very useful and a hit of the draft party.  The size of the board is perfect.  I was able to hang on wall and everyone had a clear view of board no matter where they were standing.  Even had a few guys who called in via computer that were able to see it.  Only had to write in maybe 2-3 names in total.  Would definitely buy again for next year."
5.0,Had to alter it because it was huge but very nice quality for the price!
5.0,These were everything others commented on. Although the packaging was nice I am left with a bag that is of no use to me...so into the trash it goes.

5.0,I love the shine and the look. Great for the price
5.0,I got this wallet for my wife as a Christmas gift because she's a huge fan of the anime. I was really impressed with the quality of the wallet itself as well as the design of the art. Great materials and great design makes this a must have for any Attack on Titan girls.
5.0,Cute and comfy perfect for fall weather
5.0,"Amazed at how light it is, band and the band was easy to remove links with the tool provided."
5.0,"It's slimming, hits just right at the hips and supports movement very well while staying in place. I'm 142 pounds (5&#34;4&#34;) and bought the large."
5.0,My girlfriend loves them
5.0,Came in on time. Super cute bag that comes with the nose rings. Overall very happy with purchase.
5.0,loved them
5.0,"Love the sturdy cotton knit, it's soft and substantial.  The soft blue color is very pretty.  The fit is good after washing it -- no annoying shrinkage!  The sizing is true, I am 152 pounds and 5'3"" and the large size is good."
5.0,"I purchased these for my boyfriends brother and his wife, who are expecting their first daughter in September. I make homemade moccasins, but saw these and for the price, figured I might as well try them. They arrived on time, are high quality leather, and are adoooorable. Also, the couple who I gifted them to absolutely loved them! The gold and the bows make them a bit fancier than some of the other baby moc's out there.<br /><br />*I receive a promo code to try this product, however, it did not impact the integrity of my review."
5.0,Fits great and looks better
5.0,The material is amazing
5.0,Very comfortable and looks great
5.0,Worked as claimed... highly recommended
5.0,"great shades. fits well, light weight built well and came with a nice packaging and case and wipe and everything but one of the lens had 2 straight scratches right next to each other on the lower part of the lens. it doesn't effect the view but clearly visible.<br />after writing a review I received an email from the seller ...... long story short they were kind enough to send me a replacement."
5.0,This set is so cute!!! Adorable and good quality
5.0,"Gave this ring to my beloved for Valentines day this year. Beautiful ring, clear and sparkling awesome. Literally brought her to tears of joy when I gifted her with it. So very glad I bought this ring for her"
5.0,"Incredible fit. It's very hard to find shorts when you are pear shaped - meaning small waist, normal tush and large thighs.  These shorts fit the waist, and have the perfect amount of elastic to accomodate my thighs. The material is also the perfect thickness to smooth over lumps and bumps, yet the shorts are body-fitting to actually showcase my shape instead of making me look like I'm trying to hide it. So very flattering, and perfect length too for the pear-shaped lady.  Wish more designers would note that we don't want to hide our shapes in baggy clothing or overly long shorts. The 7 inch inseam these have is perfect - long enough not to ride up, but short enough to be current and stylish.  I literally own 7 pairs in different colors and I wear the size 10. Normally my waist would be a size 10 and thighs are a size 14. But the Amanda size 10 from Gloria Vanderbilt looks like it was made for my body. Thank you GV!"
5.0,Great quality I use this product to workout in and lounge around.
5.0,"I like reviews that give me usable information; I wear a size 6 dress, I’m 5’ 3” tall and will be 70 this year.  I am always looking for easy care dresses to travel so I purchased this dress in size medium pattern choice light green and white.  We had an informal dinner dance in Florida and I wanted something with a tropical feel.  My pattern choices were limited due to the popularity of this dress, but the print I ordered is very pretty. The dress is a mock wrap dress which is better because the fabric does not gap and drapes nicely.  The only negative for me was I had to shorten the dress 2” to obtain the length that skims my knees.  I received a lot of compliments from the hubby who stated I had an unusual glow about me that evening.  Just like the dress, he is a keeper."
5.0,"I haven't officially worn the dress, but it fits amazingly & will be a hit once worn. Such a great material and the dress is quite stylish! You can't go wrong with this selection."
5.0,Looks like I got a used one with worm places and scrapes on it
5.0,"So so happy with these! First off it said they were arriving Dec 24th, I was a little bummed because they are a gift and I thought that was cutting it a little close but they came a whole week early! They come in a wonderful sturdy little box (I'm just as impressed with the box as I am with the cufflinks) and the cufflinks themselves are clearly shaped with no defects and have a good weight to them. I am very happy with this item!"
5.0,Very comfortable really like the side tightening feature.
5.0,These earrings are a bit smaller than I expected but they are quite beautiful and almost sparkly.
5.0,Her feet went to the side at first but now they fit better. She loves how warm they are
5.0,Beautiful can’t wait to wear it!!!
5.0,It fits and feels really good. Scpecially working out at Gym. Handsome!!
5.0,"great product fit great into back pocket, dries fast."
5.0,I brought these overalls for my dad. He had been dying for a pair so I took it upon myself to order him some. The product arrived sooner then expected. Looked just like the picture and fit him well. He got many compliments and everyone wanted to know where he got them. Money well spent.
5.0,Nice and durable and easy to set up :)
5.0,Really nice ring ... engravings were great...<br />Fast shipping ... fast email replies...<br />Only thing is that I wish the engravings were bolder and easier to make out
5.0,Still love it. But runs a little small but with a spanks I'm rocking it.
5.0,I'm 5-6 145 lbs I bought a medium. It fits as expected it looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,The zipper is a little stiff. Feels great and is pretty warm.
5.0,i have a high quality leather coat and these gloves look very good with the coat.i am very sastisfied with this product
5.0,Great shirt! Drys quick and doesn’t shrink. Love the collar
5.0,"The medallion was the right weight not light and cheap. The details are very clear, not fuzzy or squished looking. Great product!"
5.0,Super cute hat. I just wish it had a curved bill.
5.0,"Ordered the Medium, Flowers-8 and love it! Material is very soft, good quality. I am 5'4"", 130lbs, 36D. Hits at just below my knees. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Works great.  Less obtrusive compared to other holders.  Does not interfere if using with a helmet.
5.0,Small. I didn't check the size before I ordered. They are pretty and I may just order a larger size.
5.0,USING IT AS A SLEEPING GARMENT DUE TO MY USE OF BLOOD THINNER WHICH LEAVES ME CHILLY AT NIGHT DUE TO THE AWESOME AIR CONDITIONING
5.0,The glasses were what I expected them to be. The only real downside with buying these is the time it took to arrive (between 2 to 3 weeks for me). The product though is good for the price being paid.
5.0,Good quality great price! Thank you
5.0,"Very cute. True to fit. Medium weight. If you are wanting a warmer choice, just add heavy weight tights."
5.0,"Super cute, flattering, and comfy."
5.0,"My favorite Bra. This is my second one, and I been using it as my everyday bra. Has support, and some lift. I’m 36C and XL fits perfect, will continue to buy"
5.0,"I loved it! It fit perfectly and my fav party is that the metal matches my rose gold watches, most of them come in silver but this one can actually match your watch without having too many colors."
5.0,So hard to find simple beige socks
5.0,Got mine today: Orange for day. Yellow for night. Came early. I’ve only had a chance to try them during the day; so far so good!!
5.0,my grandson loves them
5.0,Love the band. It was easy to put on and it looks great!
5.0,Get many compliments on the dress
5.0,These are the best gift for the dealer in your hood. Gangsta
5.0,"Probably best purchase I made on Amazon to date. Great cut and very bright, plus screw backs and an appraisal. Looked for for screw backs at other stores but could not find anywhere for earrings under a $1000.00. Plus insurance requires an appraisal for replacement which Houston provided. So much better than a mall jewelry store. Wife loves them."
5.0,Well made hat. Silver logo looks amazing.
5.0,good look...great value
5.0,Sons loves his hoodie.
5.0,This shirt is awesome! Love the quality of the fabric! Its my new favorite shirt.<br />fast shipping
5.0,My husband is all ways getting splinters or hurting his hands so I bought him these gloves now I never see him without them when he's home outside working and as far as picking splinters out of his hands or fingers or putting a bandaid on his hands are over and done<br />These gloves get put threw the ringer trust me and they are so sturdy and strong they can take it
5.0,GOT THIS FOR A GIFT FOR MY NEPHEW. HE LOVED IT.
5.0,Its better than i thought before.
5.0,"By far the warmest pogies I've used. They are awesome. Will probably order another pair, soon."
5.0,would have been nice if it were line in skirt area
5.0,"They actually didn't have my size in stock, so I went with the next size up and they actually ended up fitting perfectly!"
5.0,"I’m chronically ill and don’t get out much, so shopping for a belt is incredibly difficult. Being able to customize the size of the belt from home is a huge blessing.<br /><br />I’ve been wearing this belt exclusively for over a year. While it is showing signs of wear, it’s held up nicely. I’m not sure how long a belt is supposed to last for, but at this price, I’d say it surpassed expectations.<br /><br />It’s also easily reversible which is awesome. The buckle just pulls out slightly and turns around, so it’s very easy, and, dare I say, fun!"
5.0,Love this shirt. Fits great and looks great
5.0,This dress is a perfect fit and it looks so beautiful on.
5.0,Love them...so cute...always get a compliment.
5.0,It is beautiful and perfect. I love it. all my friends celebrate it.
5.0,I've warn this style and brand for years.  They are light weight and the glass is clear and true (not distorted).  Especially like the thin temple pieces because they don't block my peripheral vision or irritate the skin above my ears.  Durability is okay.  They break on the right side at the hinge after 3-4 months of daily wear and multiple daily uses.  I am right-handed so it may be the way I take my glasses off.
5.0,Such a great product especially for the price.. I will be buying another one VERY soon.. Thank you
5.0,"I been looking for this for a while since we couldn't make it to the game when they were handing them out. Every where I looked was asking for too much. But when I found it here, I was amazed. When my brother opened it for Christmas, he almost started crying. It is the exact replica and I am impressed."
5.0,Everyone said it was cute.
5.0,"I love this top! Just the right amount of sexiness, great fit and true to size. I usually wear a 3x, so I ordered a 3x and it's perfect. Quality is pretty good for the cost and it got to me in a day or two which was amazing."
5.0,met all expectations
5.0,"Fits perfect, great quality and washes well."
5.0,For the price it's a perfect suit. It fits well and most important to me it withstands the abuse of chlorinated pool water. I'm very happy with it.
5.0,Use at work for our swipe cards and they workPerfectly
5.0,"Its perfect. Built well, looks very expensive"
5.0,I love this for my rabbit bathroom
5.0,My husband has Alzheimer’s and we need ways to keep up with him and his things. This is perfect!
5.0,"I like this pair of slippers, they are very comfortable and gives you good balance. The color goes with so many things and unfortunately my size is not available again I would have loved it in black. please let me know when you have black 12M.<br />I would surely recommend it."
5.0,I am really happy with this watch. It is brand new and of the original Timex design.
5.0,Beautiful stones and chain length perfect! Just like the picture!
5.0,"Love this scrub cap! The sweat band on the inside is a nice touch. I just ordered 3 more bc I really love them! Looking forward to them making more designs. They fit me very nice, room for a low bun. I haven't tried it with a high bun and likely won't"
5.0,Purchased the pendent for my son and<br />he  loves it. the photos of his children around his neck is priceless
5.0,Great dress! Looks as pictured. Will buy more!!
5.0,I got this because of TikTok (surprise surprise TikTok makes me spend all my money💀) and it is exactly what it claims to be. It was a fun little gift for myself that I enjoyed opening. It is also super cute and you can wear it with a lot of different outfits so I like it!!
5.0,"This dress is amazing!!! Very soft, extremely comfortable. The length is a bit longer that the picture, it goes about an inch before my knee. But i like it better that way!<br /><br />It’s a great dress! I highly recommend it!"
5.0,"This is a very beautiful and sexy set. A bit tight so l re-ordered the set of three the next size. My recommendation is to buy one size larger than your regular size. My size was Ok, however a size bigger is more comfortable. Also the panty is bigger. My bottom is a Large. Depends on the style or brand my bra size is 34B or 36B. This one 36B has a panty too small for me. The 38B that is really a 36 has a Large panty that was perfect for me. I bought this set for the bra but the panty is pretty too."
5.0,I wore this with leggings because it's a tunic on me! Very cute and comfortable!! I am a size 20 and purchased a 3X. Compliments all night!!
5.0,I thought they had an adjustable thing in the back but they don’t. I have apparently a smaller dome because they’re a little loose. It’ll be interesting to see if they stay on all night. I hope so because they’re comfortable!
5.0,This is such a beautiful dress! I love it. I am 5'3&#34; and 130 lbs. I ordered this in a small. It fit just right. If I was a little heavier it would be a no go. I bet if i lost 5lbs it would be even better! Just an fyi cause I know it is hard to order online!
5.0,Just what my husband was looking for to carry his major cards.
5.0,Muy hermoso el vestido
5.0,"Designed well,  you can cut down the belt reattach the buckle and where you cut it won't show.  It's designed more like the old military belts and doesn't slip."
5.0,"The material isn't fleece or even thick - it's as thick as 6oz t-shirt material.  It's soft and stretchy and fine for California.<br /><br />I'm 5'10"", 34D, and the xl is too loose but just long enough in length.  Tempted try a smaller size but I think they'd be too short.<br />**Update: Tried another color in the same size and it was bigger and longer, so there's quite a variance in sizing.  Trying a large next."
5.0,"These were just what I was looking for. They aren’t sheer and they fit just right. I am 5’5, 116 lbs and I ordered the extra small. They look tiny but stretch on you."
5.0,Kids loved these for Halloween hand-outs!  And they're so cheap!!
5.0,"I love this Jacket. It's so soft and comfortable. It's amazing, has an inside pocket which I love for my vape and phone. The only thing I think I would change is that the layered part of the jacket would be longer."
5.0,Nice having the variety. No allergic reaction. Easy to put on.
5.0,I need to order one for my son now
5.0,Good shorts but they are wide on the things.
5.0,Fast shipping. Just what I needed for my car and house keys
5.0,Beautiful Dress!  Fits as expected.  I'm 5'6' and the dress ends at my ankles.  I got this to go with my denim jacket and the colors look great with it.  I'm not sure why they call this a &#34;yellow&#34; dress... it looks just like the picture and its almost ivory or at least a very pale yellow. I'm very happy!!
5.0,My husband loves this pair! He said it is comfy with really nice summery geometric print and is true to size!
5.0,Very cute well made
5.0,"Honestly, this is the watch for everyone. Do you ever go, ""I wish I just had a simple clock to look at,"" because if you do this is the watch for you. It's 90% hard black plastic that is impossible to break by any normal means, and doesn't even have a dedicated backlight, just a small green LED that shines OVER the numbers, from the side.<br /><br />This watch is so unapologetically simple, I can't be unhappy with it. The sheer simplicity of it brings just a little balance to a technologically controlled world.<br /><br />(Note: go to time.is on any web browser or mobile device to sync your watch up to the actual time of day.)"
5.0,Good quality shirt. My son loves it. He's easy to spot in a crowd. :)
5.0,These were a huge and welcome surprise for my kids. They look really cool and so many colors to choose from!
5.0,"Queda muy bien, y es muy comodo"
5.0,"As pictured! My daughter Looks gorgeous in this. It's pretty big, so I would suggest size down. Love it!"
5.0,"Very nice, this was a give for my daughters second grade teacher. She loved it, very well made and the pug is so cute! I will definitely be shopping for more!"
5.0,"Large, clear, radiant pearls and beautiful settings!!"
5.0,I love them they are absolutely beautiful thank you so much.
5.0,Fits great! I'm 5 ft 1 and a half and 130 lbs. The Large fits like a glove. I even got compliments for the first time on how fit I looked! Yes I would recommend them and yes I would buy more as needed!
5.0,"Beautiful, love team"
5.0,Very soft and comfortable fit. Very attractive style. I’m small-busted and athletic so not much support is required. Loved the first one so much I bought two other colors the same week! Great product and price.
5.0,Quality ring for a very reasonable price. Son loved it!
5.0,"What a fun idea!!  These markers are perfect for dinner parties ...or any party.  My kids even like to use them on their water glasses!  They work well writing, and they wipe off easily."
5.0,Very stylish and cute glasses
5.0,"The best product out of three I ordered. Fitted my new Series 6 watch perfectly. If other colors come in, I will be back! Love all the colors."
5.0,"this is perfect. I live in RI and it matches my personality perfect. I am a ocean / beach / boat lover .Got a lot of complements on it also. It is kind of big ish , but I think its perfect for me."
5.0,Good quality case with adorable flamingo pattern. My daughter loves it.
5.0,Love these perfect for light grocery shopping
5.0,Very nice. Love the simplicity of it.
5.0,This is the 2nd one I bought. It’s fits perfectly and it didn’t shrink after I washed it.
5.0,I love these sun glasses
5.0,"Comfortable, fits good and feels cool and warm depending on what you need,  I wear to work with jeans on casual days or to outdoor activities."
5.0,"These are the best gloves I’ve ever worn. Super warm for wearing around town. I probably wouldn’t wear them to go skiing, but around town, they are the best gloves I’ve ever owned. This was my second pair, as I’d misplaced one glove of the first set I purchased."
5.0,"Survived a long night of city nightlife (dancing and cab rides and crowded bars) clip is nice and big, good length. Wig looked wonderful and was easy to work with, very comfortable. You can't beat tail or wig for the price."
5.0,I like the vets it's not bad.
5.0,I looooove it
5.0,I bought this back in August 2019 it has now been close to a year and this necklace has not tarnished at ALL. I would keep forgetting to take it off when I shower and now I just shower with it every time. Still looks just like new. Definitely recommend!
5.0,"My daughter uses them for school every day. She said she wished they made white ones. I also wished they had a pack of just the black ones because she seem to wear the black one the most. AND she lost it on a trip to Scarowinds. So in order to buy the black, I have to buy the whole pack. Overall they are comfortable and quality of material is great. Wonderful purchase. Thank you."
5.0,"Love this top. Fit as expected. Nice length, not to short."
5.0,Beautiful artwork and comfortable to wear.  Delicate appearance but sturdy.  Not sure how to use the free items???  Like it very much.
5.0,"Love these, very sturdy material and good as compression leggings! They’re extremely comfortable as well, and the only complaint I have is that the waist pocket is a bit small (still it’s amazing that any women’s clothing has pockets at all)"
5.0,I bought this boot jack for my husband as he has a bad hip and knee and loves his boots.  He is absolutely in love with his boot jack!  It is beautiful and functional!  He is so proud of it!!
5.0,"It hasn't been advertised in the listing that the item is actually made in the US, this would have given me extra motivation and explanation why the price point is quite a bit higher than comparable products. I'm v very happy with the item, delivery, and as an extra bonus happy to support US manufacturing. Note to the seller - you guys should mention Made in the US in the item description. ;) Thank you for a wonderful hat!"
5.0,Fit pretty good a little big but I ordered a bigger size to make sure it would fit and once I dryed it it fit pretty good👍 Good quality and words don’t fall off!
5.0,It is a nice looking watch! works well
5.0,"Great product, great service, fast delivery. Thank you."
5.0,A beautiful watch that works perfect!  This watch large but you hardly know its there.
5.0,Great product keeps you warm
5.0,I actually really like this suit but since most run small I bought a size up and need to exchange it for the size I normally wear for a better fit
5.0,My husband is 6’1”” and it looks great on him.
5.0,Very cute! Fits like the picture
5.0,The top is beautiful and anyone would love this.
5.0,Very comfortable for a day wear! Just the right amount of compression
5.0,Best fitting ankle pants! I had low expectations for these as pants NEVER fit me right. I ordered an XL. I’m 5”7 180lbs and they fit like a glove. They are perfect. Just the right amount of stretch. So comfortable. These are my new go to pants for work. I work in sales.
5.0,Great fit; very nice fabric- they feel like next age straps; very comfy - I usually wear a medium so I ordered a size up - will more than likely order a few more. I always hand wash my straps and they last longer that way; I honestly don’t know how well these would hold up machine washing them - I wouldn’t risk it though. Reasonably priced for what you get.
5.0,"I needed an inexpensive evening bag for my nephew's wedding next month.  I don't carry a handbag much anymore, and I wanted something that was comfortable in my hand.  The measurements on this were spot-on, and the reviews were great, so I ordered it in black (I would have ordered it in navy, but blue is a funny color and sometimes &#34;navy&#34; can be too &#34;royal&#34;, so I went with the safe bet).  It arrived quickly and although it didn't come in a box, it arrived undamaged in its envelope, covered in tissue and wrapped in plastic.  The photos don't really show how pretty the sequins are without being garish.  As other reviewers mentioned, the bag is pretty stiff (definitely cardboard in there) but feels substantial enough to get me through the night and hopefully a few more.  Looks like plenty of room in there for phone, ID, keys, comb and a couple of small make-up items.  I'm not sure if you could get a full-size wallet in there as well, though.  I'm happy with my purchase and hopefully will still be after the wedding."
5.0,"These are very nice jeans for fit and comfort, but they run large! I suggest sizing one down from your normal size."
5.0,Love these glasses! My new everyday ones.
5.0,"The SD Padres Brown Beanie is New Era MLB Genuine.  Spendy, but a quality product.  I really like the inside lining, it makes the beanie very comfortable.  I also like the brown color and ridged texture.  Easy to clean.  I washed it on a gentle cycle and let it drip dry.  It dried pretty quickly."
5.0,"I really like how these work and feel. I can wear them most of the day and they reduce the edema in my feet and legs well.  I don't have vein issues so I'm not sure how they would work for that, but I would assume that they would do just fine."
5.0,Love the shine and weight. Stunning hoops. Great for guys!
5.0,"I put this jacket through the ringer the first time I wore it, putting it to the test on a 95-mile gravel bike race in the rain and mud. It kept me perfectly dry for all 7.5 grueling hours! The fabric is a bit heavier than similar jackets I've owned previously, but the pit zips are effective for dumping excess heat. The hood is large enough to fit over a bike helmet, and the drawstring allows it to be tightened down as needed. Fits true to size if you go by the size chart. I am 5'5"" and weigh 128 pounds, and the size small fits me great with room for a light layer underneath. This jacket is also packable and can be folded down to fit in a small backpack (such as a Camelback). The color is also very nice, I would call it a dark rose pink. This jacket is a great value for the money compared to similar items. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight rain jacket!"
5.0,Really pretty. My girlfriend has dark skin and this pair of earrings looked great on her. I used a polishing cloth on them before I gave them to her and that brought out their color even more.
5.0,Wow....this is superb. Look small but hold alot
5.0,"My 15 y/o, 115 lbs, 5'11"" son likes it. Keeps his head warm incl. his ears, this NY winter."
5.0,Super comfortable! I would definitely buy again! Fit perfectly
5.0,Looks great! Excited to wear it during the winter!
5.0,I love these replacement bands. They're easy to change and you dont have to have different watches to match what you wear; you can just swap out the band
5.0,"Very comfortable,fit perfectly"
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous on & off!!
5.0,A great t-shirt all around!
5.0,i will buy again
5.0,These earrings are beautiful. I have gotten many compliments on them.
5.0,Love the quality of the pants it what I expected
5.0,This dress fit perfectly and was a very good quality fabric and workmanship.
5.0,So far I love this watch! It’s so gorgeous and the dial is so beautiful! I haven’t had a chance to see how it is in water but I’ll update next weekend!
5.0,Love the hats super soft and well made.
5.0,Nice quality looks like it will last for a while.
5.0,I love these glasses!! Great quality and a great price! Super cute while helping keep my eyes safe!
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, well made, unique looking and can stand up to my rough 11 year old. Chain is even lovely all by itself!"
5.0,Big and heavy. My little wonder woman loves it.
5.0,Suspenders are sewn together very nicely. My daughter has worn these a few times and loves them.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,"Let me start with how stinking cute this is!! It is well made and would cost over 50.00 in a discount store and looks and feels like ones I have seen and paid up to 100.00 in swim shops. This is about makes your areas that you want to hide go away and still gives that flirty sexy fun look we all want to feel at the beach no matter what our size! I am a 12 and it fits just lovely! My girls ;) look great in this and we are off to the beach today in this cute little number! I did receive this item at a discount for a fair and honest review! I would totally buy from them again and cant wait to get in the sand with this cute suit! I did get the red, white, and blue one! True to size for sure!!"
5.0,On of my favorites due to the coloring.  I love everything about these tops and have absolutely no complaints!
5.0,Nice product And good quality
5.0,"I'm glad I read the reviews that said this bra runs a little small. I'm a full 36 D, but I ordered a 36 DD and it fits perfectly. No awkward uni-boob, the under wire makes it fit very similarly to a regular bra. I wish it came in more colors but that's hardly a big deal. I'll definitely be buying another one."
5.0,Like this band for its simplicity and the fact that it has no cheap metal against me skin! I got a very similar where the metal tab/post went all the way through the band and rested in the skin. It was turning green. 😬 This band was great without that.  It’s my main watch band!
5.0,It’s Very Beautiful!!!
5.0,Everything was as expected.
5.0,Actually keep your feet warm
5.0,I selected dark brown. Can't beat the price! Kept its shape & color after 4-5 washes so far...great find. I'm a return customer as I type!
5.0,My bestie loves this ! It came fast and was part of her christmas basket . she wears it all the time .
5.0,"Your glasses are great!! Wayfarer Style Sunglasses Set Black Polarized... I tend to lose or break glasses, but these allow my faults. I love the spring hinges and your fantastic customer service."
5.0,Soft material!
5.0,cute and works as expected
5.0,Really awesome gloves super bright hi-vis and tons of freedom it's like not even wearing gloves but with the protection and grip you need very satisfied
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter who needed a button down shirt for an event. It’s has a sheen to it that’s similar to a dressier type shirt. Well made, fitted and stylish. I actually stole it and wear it to work now. I’m very small chested, 5’8 and 135 lbs and the small was perfect. She’s 5’6, a swimmer with broad shoulders and c cup and it worked for her too."
5.0,A small accent piece of jewelry that was exactly as I expected. The garnet was a nice deep red and sits perfectly on the chest.
5.0,Very beautiful scarf pendent. nicely made. many compliments.
5.0,It’s perfect looks perfect Wish they had different ones
5.0,"Love this dress!  It’s so cute and very quality fabric, I wish they had other colors!  Fit as expected, I ordered a large and it was a little right across the chest,  but the material stretches a bit after wearing."
5.0,"I got this wallet a little while back. I love it, and it holds my 8 cards plus a credit card size steel bottle opener. I'm never worried that my cards are going to fall out, and it beats carrying a full size wallet."
5.0,After I ordered 3 of these in size large I then looked at the size chart and it only went up to T4 I tried to cancel but was to late after receiving I was happy to find these would fit my rather large for his age 7 year old and skinny 10 year old nephews. Were 50/50 which I can't seem to find in brick and mortar stores these days. Happy with my purchase and ordered 16 more.
5.0,"Muy buena calidad. Excelente. La pueden comprar a confianza. Y eso, que yo soy exigente."
5.0,Work well for wearing on long cross country driving trips
5.0,Used for car keys very sturdy catches other peoples eye
5.0,😍😍😍 Love it
5.0,Ordered 2nd one for me and one each for my great granddaughters.  They are lightweight and only takes a couple of minutes to dry
5.0,"This top is very cute. The fabric is of a good quality and is not see through. I'm 5'6&#34; tall and it covers my rear. The longer part hits my knees. It does run larger than I expected. I used the sizing information provided and ordered a xxl. It is more like a 43-44 than a 42, so if you want it to be more fitted, go down a size"
5.0,Wearing my shoes at work very lightweight and comfortable
5.0,Arrives as described.  No problems. Great
5.0,"I Like it , Thank you!"
5.0,"I ordered a size small. I’m 5’5”, 155 lbs. the small is perfect. Doesn’t hug me, but not overly baggy to where I look frumpy. Thin material, but not see-through (except part of the sleeve, of course). Overall great value and a very versatile shirt. I got it to wear under a blazer for a work event so it’s just thin enough to where you can’t see the shirt sleeves under my blazer, and then dressy enough that I can take the blazer off. Perfect!"
5.0,Loveeeeee
5.0,Nice and comfy dress and it looks great on.
5.0,"Very warm, neck piece a little tight, does stretch out. Colors looks like picture. Plush inside feels great"
5.0,I don't know how I got dressed and put on bracelets without this before!
5.0,Absolutely love love this wallet! The fact that it's a wristlet makes it even ten times more awesome. It is great quality and i love that it has 3 zipper compartments.
5.0,Easy to find in my carry on bag!
5.0,I sell at my Fireworks Stand and ordered the wrong pack size but they were no different than the large individually wrapped glasses but more expensive. Pretty as good of quality as you get for paper glasses.
5.0,"These shoes are awesome! They fit perfect and are good for anything from wearing around the house doing yard work, casual dining to the trail."
5.0,We love these caps! They are silky and lightweight. They do not make my head hot throughout the day in the OR. They have an adjustable toggle in the back. Perfect for our animal print obsession.
5.0,"These glasses are amazing! They look so sharp and have such a clear view. I love that they are polarized and they look so good! I have gotten so many compliments on them too! Now, I have to get some for my bestie!"

5.0,"Love this shirt.  Fits great, good quality, would buy it again."
5.0,"This sweatshirt if perfect for my collection. Not too heavy that I can't wear it during fall!!! It is thin and lightweight. The material is soft and comfortable too! It isn't as flower as I expected on the neck so I can't wear it as an ""off the shoulder "" but is till think it's a beautiful sweatshirt!"
5.0,What's to not like? It's Christmas vacation!
5.0,This is my 2nd set if these socks. I love them
5.0,"sorry for the tired look in the photos haha<br /><br />* the product has nice colors, fits as expected.<br />* I'm a small person (153 cm which is about 5 feet), and the sleevs<br />* which usually are to long on me, fit perfectly, as well as the rest of the jacket<br />* it has pockets, but they can't hold much, only good for warming your hands,<br />not holding your phone haha<br />* the is THIN! it is not fleece, it's just a little thicker than a long sleeve T shirt<br />* but it is made out of some synthetic material so it does keep you warm-ish<br /><br />thank you for a very nice product"
5.0,Perfect ...
5.0,Nice to see that it's an actual Hasbro product.
5.0,"This is Mike's wife.  This dress is absolutely amazing!  It's fitted around the chest and ribcage and then flares out to hide my mom tummy.  I haven't felt this pretty in a dress in a long while.  It flows and as far as I can tell, it doesn't wrinkle, so it's perfect for traveling.  All I need to do is get some shapewear for my stomach, and you'd never be able to tell that I even have one.  I'm planning on getting one in almost every color.  &#60;3"
5.0,Perfect length
5.0,Felt em as soon as I put em on
5.0,[[VIDEOID:6b5bc89349e22e9c3d912cc8d76212df]] Super cute loved it in Miami

5.0,Huge but very nice design
5.0,Compact and durable.  Very tight credit card slots.  Magnet works great.
5.0,Nephew loved it!! Adjustable length.
5.0,Great fix and will buy again
5.0,"When this watch artived I was quite surprised, as it exceeded my expectations. The quality was first class and it could be compared to one of the top manufacturers and there would be no difference..."
5.0,Birthday
5.0,Fit PERFECT i love it!! it's super cute n warm! I highly recommend for fairy Kei and kawaii outfits x3
5.0,"They are awesome.very sparkly,perfect size but a little heavy.They arrived early and totally match my classy goth style.These are now,my second fav go to's."
5.0,Cute PJ’s . Ran alittle small
5.0,I fits very well
5.0,These were a perfect replacement for scratched lenses that were in perfectly good frames. Will definitely purchase again.
5.0,"Looking forward to wearing this soft, loose dress for summer.  It is longer than expected so if you are tall, this may fit you perfectly.  I and 5'5&#34; and plan to wear this casually but I could wear 2&#34; heels comfortably."
5.0,Great product for my granddaughters
5.0,My son loves these...true to size!
5.0,Super cute style; perfect for a front-tuck look.
5.0,"This is a nice shirt.  The fabric is quite thin so a camisole or tank top under is advised, but it's soft and gathers nicely across and helps disguise the &#34;post baby pooch&#34;.  My only issue is the teal is more blue than green but this is not a deal breaker.  I would not advise washing this in a machine, even on gentle or delicate, fabrics like this pill very easily so I will be hand washing it, laying it flat to dry and folding it for storage, not hanging."
5.0,"The lady loves this dress, she say's it's comfortable, sexy and hugs the right places."
5.0,"When I was buying this dress I read the reviews first and ordered a size up. I'm glad I did! Perfect fit! love the price! love the color! I'm 5'4, and it hits just below the knee. Falls perfectly. I've had 2 kids, so my stomach isn't flat but it hides what it should! I would buy again in different colors!"
5.0,If you have a fat head and can never find one....this is it. I have the fattest head on the planet and this can fit too big...love it...will buy more.
5.0,"These socks are great quality and functions as expected. I thought they would be small for my petite boy who is 17 months (fyi, he is only 17lbs). They are loose but wont slide down easily. The elastic at the mouth is pretty good. Not too tight not too loose. I love these and would buy again. They will fit my son even after an year."
5.0,"This outfit is so cute, I immediately ordered additional sets for my son. My son is skinner than most 22 month old toddlers but the shirt fit him perfectly and doesn’t look big on him. The shorts are big on him but he’s extra skinny and usually wears slim fit so I expected that. I’m just taking in the sides myself so the waist area fits him good. He looked absolutely adorable in the set and received many compliments. The $15 for the outfit was definitely priced well. So far, the outfit has washed well and doesn’t wrinkle too much."
5.0,I am going on a cruise in July
5.0,I got this for my best friend so she can wear it for her husband. I hope she enjoys it and wears it for v-day🥰🥰
5.0,great for cold feet!!
5.0,Would recommend and would buy again. True to size.
5.0,"Cheap and good quality, does the job. will buy more in the future when I eventually lose them all :)"
5.0,"First off, I’m 5’11” 170 lbs and got the A2. Pants fit perfect, but the top was a little big. All I had to do was hang dry the pants and dry the top on high heat a few times to bring it down to size. I’ve been training in this gi for about a week now and love it. Everything seems to be very high quality, but only time will tell."
5.0,I love this keychain! It is so cute and it came earlier than expected. It looks great and the little tree spirits are the perfect size!
5.0,"Great scarf, purchased as gift for niece. Great for someone who wants look of blanket scarf, but not as much material. Great colors!"
5.0,"I have these in 2 different colors. I love the fit of the pants, they feel very comfy, but they still look decently professional."
5.0,looks good.  just wish belt was a little more rigid
5.0,My daughter loves these gloves. So far they keep her hands warm. They have an extra rubber-like layer on the fingers so I am hoping this will keep the water out. I also like the two options to tighten the gloves to make sure they stay on.
5.0,Unique shirt. Worked great for a birthday gift. Quality screen printing
5.0,BUY IT! Love the quality and the price point! I get compliments everytime I wear it!
5.0,Super comfy and cute. Don't throw in the dryer tho
5.0,Fast shipping and product exactly as described
5.0,"Perfect size gauge, although a lil long for nipple rings, I am happy with them. Great deal for the price, as it came with 10 or 12 rings. Also haven't had problems with them getting infected, after a few weeks of them being in, as I have with some cheaper rings in the past."
5.0,Living in the south it lets me enjoy working in my yard as it’s protecting me from the sun. It’s a good fit.
5.0,Kids love them!
5.0,"I love this coat - it keeps me warm and dry and fits great, looks really nice too. The best thing I've purchased in a long time!"
5.0,Awesome quality gloves ! Very warm. Used them for sling and they were perfect.

5.0,"gorgeous metallic knit fabric. you wouldn't know that it's metallic silver from the stock photo! nice and thick but best worn with a slip under it. so comfy,  too!"
5.0,THE BAG IS VERY NICE.  I WISH IT WERE WIDER AT THE BOTTOM FOR SUPPORT .
5.0,Really good product!
5.0,Very pretty I love them!
5.0,"For this price, I've had so many compliments. Buy this pair"
5.0,So comfy and warm. Still fluffy after a few washes. I initially bought it for my hospital stay but I basically live in this thing now.
5.0,"Super flattering dress!  Love the jersey material; easy to care for and comfortable to wear.  With little kids, I have to bend over, down and walk around a lot.  I can wear this dress and still feel/look put together when chasing after the little ones.  It washes and dries beautifully; no change in material, fit or feel."
5.0,"Nice , comfortable, color as shown. The sleeves are very large, flowy so make sure you like that look."
5.0,Sooo soft!  Washes well and arrived promptly and as described.
5.0,"This dress is just what I was wanting- perfectly flattering, especially for someone like me who has had three c sections and has that lower mom pooch. I usually wear a size 10 or a large. Ordered this in an XL based on the size chart and I had to squeeze into it! But once on and adjusted, it fit like a glove and hugged me in all the right spots.  Very good, thick quality fabric. Gorgeous color as well! Going to order another! Cute for a wedding or date night."
5.0,"True to size. Very comfortable, even for walking around a city. Can dress up or dress down."
5.0,I really love these charms. Sunflowers are my favorite so this one is especially nice.
5.0,"The shorts are very nice, the material is of great quality. The sizing is way off base and could use a size chart attached to the order guide. I’m sending them back for the second time. I will not order the nest size up because I’m no confident it will fit. Love the quality of the product!!!"
5.0,I bought this hat for my husband. He absolutely loved it.
5.0,"Reasonable prize, we ordered it to my daughter and she looks beautiful in it.. little bit large for her as per her age but my wife fix size for her.. Clothes stuff is good as well"
5.0,"The earrings were just as I expected. They are beautiful, simple, and elegant. I love them."

5.0,It is very nice hat with adjustable head size. Received it on time
5.0,Very soft and cuddly and fun PJ's.
5.0,These loops are excellent. I used them to fix two watchbands.
5.0,💯% happy with this product! Thanks
5.0,I really love these pants. But I couldn't even get them up my legs they were so small however the shipper refunded my money completely and didn't even ask me to send the pants back. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with these too small pants but maybe I'll lose a lot of weight and be able to get in them eventually because the quality seems to be really good it's just unfortunate they don't have two sizes up which is what I would have needed to replace the pants that were too small
5.0,really nice looking ring and it feels really smooth on my finger. the skulls and pyramid tops really show nicely.. i like it
5.0,"Surprisingly, works well and is somewhat reliable."
5.0,I keep a jar with the little spatulas next to my homemade body creams. I don't care much when friends want to put their figure in my body butters or creams.  Lol  it works great. I just wash them and put them back in the jar. Now that keeps me happy.  Lol
5.0,"Got this shirt in a medium.  I would say it runs a tad large.  Not a lot.  But it does have lots of run through the middle.  It's also pretty long as well.  It's super soft lightweight crepe fabric.  Got the blue and it's a dusty blue.  The description says roll up sleeves but they aren't.  They are button up cuffs.  The ruffles across the top of the sleeves are very cute and dress it up a little.  It would still look cute with jeans, though.  Buttons all the way up the front.  It's 100% polyester."
5.0,I liked the fabric and the length of them. I bought them some time ago and forgot to write a review as they still fit him and still look great.
5.0,RECIEVED MY glasses and was very pleased. The colors are greatly.. I ordered 2pair .
5.0,Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,Kinda hard to put the little plastic on to keep it in place but other than that its fine
5.0,"I recommend this product.  I have quite a few murano glass necklaces, and this one is good quality and very lovely."
5.0,These shirts run alittle small.  I got the 3x ordered 2 sizes up and love it<br /> I ordered a few other colors
5.0,First package was actually missing the earrings but they got me a new set right away<br />Love them so much
5.0,"This pant is hard to come by in a size 10, black. But love the pant!"
5.0,My granddaughter collects keychains and she loved it
5.0,Absolutely love it. Got lots of compliments from my colleague when i wore to work. It fits perfectly.
5.0,This is such a great deal! I bought this for her cake smash and wasn’t expecting it to be great considering the price. I was so surprised at the quality and feel of the fabric! Super cute and great deal!
5.0,Can’t be any cuter!!!!
5.0,I bought this dress for my granddaughter 1st  Easter<br />It was perfect
5.0,My Favorite Earrings.. Love them all day everyday.. Get alot of compliments on them as well.
5.0,"Super lindas y de miy buna calidad, pero no me di cuenta y compre las de niños😞"
5.0,I ordered this in a size slightly larger for my 5 year old. We'll get more use out of it that way. She never wants to take it off. Mission accomplished. :)
5.0,"Awesome color, awesome fit, great quality!"
5.0,"absolutely love this, perfect for sitting on cool evening, hospital visits, can be worn to bed for warmth & comfort, soft, nice to wear"
5.0,Better than expected. Has my curves popping. Got me feeling real sexy!!
5.0,I gave these to my mom who wears a size 9.5-10 these worked great for her! But for my size 8 foot--nope. But regardless they are comfortable and soft. She likes them a lot but white easily gets dirty of course. Recommend for the right size!
5.0,Very good glass
5.0,"These are adjustable belts, that are well built. Have been looking for these types in stores for a long time, without luck. Thank you Amazon for having these. Highly recommended."
5.0,"These are great jeans. They have some stretch to them. They're lined on the inside so very soft and comfortable. And I think they look great. Button up, instead of zipper."
5.0,I'm so in love with this! It's comfortable and very sexy! I feel amazing in it. It's a little large at the top but nothing too bad. I'm usually large in tops so I went with the large and it was great.
5.0,"Bought a pair of these for me and my husband before our trip to Iceland. They literally saved our feet from freezing. They kept our feet perfectly dry. If moisture happens to get inside the sock, they socks still insulate well and kept our feet warm. Would definitely recommend. We got these in lieu of investing in 100% waterproof hiking boots."
5.0,"tricky as they often do not fit well. This hat fit well and was super cute. Was a great product for the price, solid nine out of 10 for this product. If you were looking for a fun festive hat, this will be the hat for you"
5.0,"This is a sturdy and utilitarian bonnet, that will easily endure many wearings."
5.0,It should be a nice gift for yourself or your beloved ones.
5.0,"It does run a little big, but I just tied it as snug as I could. It is SO CUTE, and it being a little big did not hinder the cuteness in anyway. Definitely a good buy!"
5.0,"I use this to attach my wallet (woman's) to my purse. The clasps are perfect. I can easily connect and disconnect to a loop inside of my purse. I also attach my keys, which  have never lost but the odds keep getting better that it will happen some day. Now I cant lose components. They have to steal the entire purse."
5.0,"Fits perfectly, looks just like the picture, and feels sturdy, made from quality materials. Been wanting some just like this forever! Would recommend 110%!"
5.0,"I have been buying a similar style tube bras and I love them! I thought I would give this brand a try because I trust Amazon to give good quality for the price. I actually like this bralette more than i already have and its less expensive!  The lace, color and style are very nice.It is extra soft and does not stretch as much while wearing. I highly recommend this! I am about to buy some additional colors!<br />Good for wearing under bulkier clothes if you don't need much support.<br />It will only work for B, maybe C, sizes<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED....."
5.0,Comfy and cute with flats or sneakers
5.0,These are perfect for people who wear glasses
5.0,"Njce, heavier weight material. Well constructed. Delivered on time."
5.0,So so cute and really warm and cozy. I love the buttons bc it makes it easier to take off and on without getting caught on my daughter’s head.
5.0,"Just what our train loving son needed!  These help cut down the high decibel sounds like trains, planes and fireworks (which we go to see all the time), but still lets voices be heard by the wearer.<br /><br />Adjustment is simple and they don't press too hard on the sides of the head. They fold up small and come with a nice carrying pouch to keep them clean when not in use."
5.0,"Love these socks.  They are cushiony, very comfortable to wear walking and hiking."
5.0,Comfortable leggings for running errands or lounging. Not very thick and does not have a firm grip on the torso. These are leggings to relax in.
5.0,Sick vest and it red 🔥🔥
5.0,Amazing ring. Big n beautiful. You should get this ring. Its something special.
5.0,"I have a chronic medical condition that makes me perspire uncontrollably all day, every day.  No matter what I do the sweat still pours down my face and head soaking my hair and shirt.  I have tried multiple cooling towels but they only work for a short amount of time.  When I saw this cooling scarf I decided to give it a try.  I felt it would be a little more discreet way of trying to cool down in public.<br /><br />The Original Cooling Scarf states it is for extreme heat relief and it really works wonders.  You simply run it under cold water, ring it out and place around your neck or head.  I use mine like a scarf and it works beautifully.  If it begins to warm you simply take it off and shake it around and it will be cool again.  The scarf can be used to keep yourself warm as well although I never have and never will try that.  It would simply be unbearable for me to attempt.<br /><br />The scarf is machine washable which is wonderful.  It needs washed often when used by someone who sweats a lot like I do.  I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for my opinion of it in use.  Since I received a coupon code for a reduced price i did not get a choice of colors.  I received the camo print, but would have much rather received a more girly color like pink or purple…really anything but camo."
5.0,It reminds the Believer of God's covenant and His mercy on His own
5.0,"I love how nice it feels inside.<br />Have worn it on 40° weather and was very warm. Well mage, love the detachable hood! Definitely buy one!"
5.0,"I got this for my teen daughter who absolutely loves Taylor Swift. She was so excited when I surprised her with it. It’s very good quality, and looks exactly like the photo. This is the perfect gift for the Swiftie in your life!"
5.0,The perfect length leggings and they’re high waisted! Super warm and comfortable! Can’t wait to wear them in the colder weather!
5.0,I used this for 2 straight months of cleaning out barns. Of course it didnt keep all the dust out but it overall massively improved my ability to work and not have a runny nose all day. also it washes well and is durable
5.0,This is super comfy and so sexy at the same time. The fabric is also very soft.
5.0,"Great handbell gloves! I go through gloves like crazy, playing 3-4 times a week, so I was glad to find these on Amazon. I tend to blow out the ends of the fingers every few months, and I'm sure these will go the same route, but they fit well, stayed on well due to the velcro, and didn't make it extra-difficult to turn pages, so I'm pleased. I may have to buy another pair to set aside just for concerts."
5.0,"This is a beautiful bead but it is very, very small.  Just be aware.  I love it."
5.0,My cousin loved his hat.  A Marine Vietnam. Very proud to wear his new hat. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
5.0,Lots of compliments when I wear this dress. Washes easily.
5.0,Good quality and fits true to size
5.0,10/10 highly recommend. Would purchase again!
5.0,I'm a size 9 and ordered a size 10. It was a perfect fit just make sure your order a size up.
5.0,Amazing.  Simply.  Pop threads rocks.
5.0,I liked this sweater even better than I thought I would.🌝
5.0,Was exactly as advertised
5.0,Big hit on Christmas morning!!!
5.0,"I've been using this for several months now, and this thing is holding up nicely. I've purchased wallets at places like TJ Maxx and they fall apart eventually. They also tend to lose their emblems, etc. The seams are holding up very well and there are no signs of wear, even though I carry it every day and I use items from it several times a day. Ample pockets for credit cards, business cards, etc. I'd recommend this wallet to anyone."
5.0,Daughter loved the fit and comfy material!
5.0,I have been on the computer a lot now for distance learning and meetings and these really help eliminate headaches from too much screen time.
5.0,Good hat for balding head!
5.0,"I love these pants for lounging around the house.  The fabric is extremely soft and comfortable, and having pockets is a big plus!  I only wish they came in a petite or short version, they are a little long for my 5'2"" frame, but I decided I can live with this because I love the comfort."
5.0,so cute and make me feel adorable i love them
5.0,I loved my sterling silver diamond cut rope chain. It was beautiful just the right length.  Now looking for a cross to go with it. I will buy another chain from this seller.
5.0,Elastic waist things don't always agree with me but these belts are very comfortable and adjustable.  You can wear them under clothes without them being seen (need a belt but don't want you tummy showing so you put a shirt on top).  I wear them all the time.
5.0,"Passes the ""light test"" and ""lighter test."" Thick fabric, built-in nose bridge, and a filter pocket (although I don't use a filter because this mask is for outside use and it is plenty thick as is). It could be a bit bigger."
5.0,"Cute socks, my daughter says they will be the perfect accessory."
5.0,Really cute little summer dress -I would purchase it a size bigger than you would  normally wear if you have a bigger chest.  I love the color and the quality - and it is great that the dress is somewhat fitted at the waist instead of loose and flowy.
5.0,The product will definitely keep my baby warm this winter. Love how thick it is and the access able zippers on the sides
5.0,I LOVE my Pajama Jeans! They are cute and comfy AF.
5.0,"Perfect fit, not extremely tight on my arms"
5.0,True to size! Very comfortable. I love this material
5.0,"This bikini is great! It doesn't feel cheap and it fits very well. I bought a large and I am 5'5, 150lbs, round butt & big thighs, size 34D bra, 29&#34; waist, and 39&#34; hips. It fits me perfectly and doesn't squeeze anything too tightly nor is it loose anywhere. It's super flattering too, I feel great in it!"
5.0,wish they had one size up
5.0,"Talk about a God send! I may be overreacting but this mask has been the greatest purchase during quarantine. As a man who wears glasses all day/every day, I absolutely LOATHE masks that cause them to fog. However, these masks make that problem a thing of the past. Once assembling the mask, putting it on properly and sitting my glasses on top of the nose indent, it refuses to fog my glasses, no matter how hard I exhale. I HIGHLY recommend it to others who have suffered to find a mask that won't fog up their glasses."

5.0,Gave to my dad in va

5.0,The picture displays its exact appearance. I was glad to find out there were buttons behind the design on the front for ease of putting on and taking off. Looking forward to wearing it!

5.0,"I have fat arms and that was my main concern as to the fit but the blouse fit perfectly! I love it! Great material, soft, and just the right amount of stretch!"
5.0,"I install and move appliances and these bad boys grip like hell. Now you do have to clean them regularly because your hands sweat and after some uses it'll make the gloves and then your hands stink. But other than that, these are great durable gloves."
5.0,Bottoms are really stretchy. You could probably go down to size or two. The tops fit as to be expected but you’re going to have some issues with the bottoms. I do like the material. It is a little thin but not see-through.
5.0,Bought this for the hubby & he wears it ALL the time. His favorite by far. Great T-Shirt by an exceptionally badass Band!

5.0,these made great gifts. very lovely and durable
5.0,The shirts are great quality
5.0,"DEFINITELY WORTH IT!! No this is not a collected review or whatever that means lol. Okay so I had never bought anything off of amazon. I had been looking for a cute mini travel bag but something that wasn’t too small. I’m a tall plus size girl so mini backpacks the size of my fist won’t cut it for me. I came across these and I decided to leave my review for the skeptics. First off, YES YOU CAN FIT WATER BOTTLES ON THE SIDES! I fit my Gatorade on one of the side pockets (there are 2). People that claim it’s impossible must be carrying too much in their backpacks which leave little room for your bottle to fit. The bottle will take about an inch and a half of your inside space, which is not a big deal for me. THE STRAPS ARE ADJUSTABLE and have a very good quality too! This backpack has sooooo much room for anything, but if you don’t carry a lot of things, the back pack wont look bulky and pop out, I love this detail about it. I really wanted a deep purple one but they were sold out so the teal caught my eye instantly. I can’t wait to customize mine just like everyone else has.  Definitely the best decision I’ve made and I might just get one in every color. I hope my review helps! See all photos for references! (:"
5.0,Very nice - true to description
5.0,"Sloths are my favorite animal, it's only appropriate I get a dress with them on it! It's very stretchy, comfy, and breathable (very important in south Louisiana), and everyone loves asking about where I got it!"
5.0,"This awesome looking charm is just the kick my special lil soccer player needed to celebrate his love for soccer! It’s designed to bring both a joyous smile and stainless steel durability, as my young athlete wears it everywhere. Terrific find!"
5.0,This is what I have been looking for! It is very long so you can cover a lot of space when wrapping or just wrap it all around one target area! Super easy to use (just wrap and Velcro) Holds really well and Velcro does not come loose when you have around a lot. Berger for lower belly fat and waist training. Overall 10/10 I highly recommend! ❤️
5.0,Beautiful and they do not irritate my ears at all and mine are super sensitive.
5.0,So comfortable I was not anxious to remove after taking off skies
5.0,"I bought this strap to replace the default silicon strap because it irritated my skin.<br />I've been using this strap for a week now, it's a flexible and comfortable fit.<br />I like to go out running daily, and the strap kept a hold on my wrists with no problems."
5.0,So warm. Perfect fit.
5.0,"just wish contract stripe on the body would be higher, so it would not visually lower boody"
5.0,"This is such a great, affordable watch, so much so, I bought the white dial model as well. Easily passes for an expensive timepiece. Highly polished stainless steel case. You will get compliments galore when you wear it. You can see the balance wheel through the front, simulating a tourbillon movement. Both of mine run very well. They ran a little fast when I first got them, but this is not unusual, automatic watches often need a settle in period. They have settled in well, only gaining +10 seconds/day. The movement is Japanese, I'm inclined to think it is a variation on the Japanese TMI(Time Module Inc.) SII NH25A with extra complications. TMI is part of the Seiko Group, so it is a quality movement. You cannot manually wind this watch. You must shake it to get it going, so you you might want to keep it on a watch winder. It is not a true moon phase, but rotates between the sun and moon, still a very nice feature. the dial is crisp, black with gold Roman numerals. A small center dial is the seconds, and a larger dial to the left is a 24 hour dial. I wished they had used gold hour and minute hands to compliment the gold Roman numerals and black dial, and had signed and guilloched the rotor, just to dress up the movement a bit, since it is an exhibition back, but these are very minor gripes, lol. Comes on a padded croc grain leather band, embossed Lucien Picard on the inside. The stainless steel buckle is signed LP. Very good quality, fit and finish. Amazon is not carrying this watch anymore, but you can find it online still at 80-100 dollarsUSD. It's worth the money. A fine watch."
5.0,"Perfect for my son who was afraid of Disneyland rides. These lowered the noise so he could take in all the other senses of the ride without being overwhelmed. Worth the investment to help ease his fear. A year later and he doesn’t ask for them anymore for rides. They’ve also helped at loud events like wedding receptions, concerts, etc."
5.0,"Arrived as expected.  These foot anklets are absolutely beautiful!  I love, love, love the fact that it comes in (3) different colors.  Plus, you can't been the price.  I haven't worn them yet, but the quality seems very good.  Thank you!"
5.0,I love this hoodie
5.0,"Works great no complaints, my wife said why I didn't get one years back is beyond me."
5.0,This sweater is awesome! The pink color is as bright as you see in the picture. It’s very comfortable and easy to wash and dry. I will be wearing it a lot this winter.
5.0,I love this sweater! It’s so different from all of my other sweaters. It is great quality soft material and fits very well. I got the green color because I wanted something for Christmas time. It’s warm but not super thick. It looks so cute paired with jeans. This will be one of my go to sweaters for the season!
5.0,"The fabric of this dress has a night weight and is not see through. I just ordered it in red too. Really flattering and comfortable!! I got the large, it is very roomy, which is why I always size up. I am 5’8” and weigh about 170 with a 36 DD and the large was very loose, which is my preference. If you are wanting a snug fit size down."
5.0,"My 8 year old son thinks this is THE BOMB. I'm giving it 5 starts b/c it was not as cheaply made as I thought it might be fore this price! Some jerseys just look cheap but this one had nicer sticking and patches on it, etc.. so it just felt and looked like a better quality jersey. Happy boy and happy mama."
5.0,I got XL  in red which is a heather red. Love the fit and length. I’m 5’11 38D and larger arms plus a stomach. It has room and not hugging my unwanted areas. Ordering more right now as it is hard to find a good fit in Tshirts
5.0,"Runs large. Looks nice, good quality. I bought the tan one, looks great on tanned skin."
5.0,"This fits my wife perfectly.  She's 5'6"", 127lbs and got the small.  It's very light and shows off her curves."
5.0,outstanding
5.0,grand daughter loved them
5.0,A bit different than other Angels.  Nice look.
5.0,Nice lightweight for the summer. My Grandson likes them especially the reflecting material on the side pockets
5.0,Comfortable and perfect for driving and working!
5.0,"I really like this bar necklace. Fits perfectly, well made, love the wording Give on this piece and great for gifting."
5.0,The glasses are great! Just what I expected!
5.0,Great quality and fit...  I'm definitely getting more of these.
5.0,They are very comfortable boxers! They did shrink a tiny bit when washed. Not enough to get a bigger size though. The pocket is well stitched. Over all very pleased.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1e6eccb0f5d8c4d240f4f896a44a6f7]] Very comfortable
5.0,This locket was beautiful! I bought it for a friend and she loved it. Highly recommend!
5.0,Very cute! Fit as expected!
5.0,"I bought these on a whim because I needed new socks and there was a lightening deal on these.<br /><br />I’m not sure what I was expecting but these were a pleasant surprise. They’re relatively thick, but have breathable material on the top. The extra tab of material that sits on the back of your ankle was a nice surprise (since I obviously didn’t read the description). It prevents the back of your shoes from rubbing against your ankle.<br /><br />They’re great for sneakers, and this pair of low cut boots that I’ve had for years but don’t wear very often because the one tears up my ankle. I’m so excited that I can now wear them with these socks and not be in pain (because the boots are way too cute to give up on)!<br /><br />Will be buying more in the future :)"
5.0,My items came as described.
5.0,Fun little mask I wear over my kn95 to make people look twice. Just download the app and it even does something to the music!
5.0,"I couldn't tell you about the sturdiness of this item as I bought them as a gift for someone. However, the look great and he loves them."
5.0,I love the quality and it looks cute on 2yo boy
5.0,True to size and as pictured and comfy
5.0,Great money belt with good storage areas. It held all of my needed and important items easily and well and was completely secure and comfortable.
5.0,"The dress material, cut and color are impressive quality, and very happy with fit."
5.0,Exactly what I expected and my son loved it!!!
5.0,this is a lovely necklace it's so pretty that I bought 2 kept one and gave  the other one to one of my friends
5.0,These stones took away the chlorine taste and smell from my tap water.  I will order more so I can keep 2 containers of water & stones at all times.  It’s  anazing the taste difference in the water.
5.0,Perfect  fit and great quality and washed really nice. My husband loves this sweatshirt jacket. I would recomend this product.
5.0,These are well made and the perfect gift!
5.0,amazingly long.  I would guess 37&#34; inseam.  waist band is not thick and heavy.  fits smooth not bulky.  6 ft tall and these were perfect length!
5.0,"These are very pretty,  They are as described."
5.0,I love the way it fit on me .I am 5.7 weight 160 and I brought a small
5.0,"Love my look for my night out..at 5'10 about, 200 and age #69 I was to cute.."
5.0,"I only have a positive feedback .... good quality, jacket-spring-summer coat, functional, original, pretty .... I recommend! MANY THANKS!"
5.0,I bought this for my wife and she loves it!!!
5.0,It was larger than I pictured but it was beautiful & really worked out well for the show I was in.
5.0,Love! Love! Love my new rainbow socks :-) I received them weeks before the estimated delivery time and they are absolutely adorable :-)
5.0,Bought these for my grandson.
5.0,This is a serious belt. It is very durable. A bit heavy but it feels like you could really load it down with tools and things. It is so robust that they have to put a tag on it to remind people it is not for rock climbing.
5.0,my favorite gloves
5.0,love this will buy again from this company
5.0,"Love, love it."
5.0,"I got this for my ex who had a little connection to a state and it gleamed nice on her stupid fat neck. It was a larger state so it demanded a bit of attention due to its size. Great price for the quality as she often showered with it and it didn't appear to rust. Don't get this for your significant other though cause then you'll constantly be reminded of your manipulative, toxic relationship when you browse through your Amazon orders during your leisure time. She received a lot of compliments too. She was a fair-skinned woman with yellow undertones. I wouldn't buy for myself as I am more of an olive-colored woman and silver doesn't vibe with my skin tone."
5.0,it looks kind of creepy haha but my cousin loved it :)
5.0,This runs a bit small so I recommend getting a size up. The material is good.
5.0,"These pants are the best! I wear a size 8 and the medium fits me perfectly. I bought a pair in the medium & long length because it states they shrink when washed. The med length is good and I had to cuff the long length, so I'll see what happens when I wash them."
5.0,it's awesome
5.0,007 awesomeness
5.0,"I bought these gloves for my wife, her hands would get cold and sore.  After one night of wearing them, her hands felt great! Not cold and not sore. She can wear them anytime during the day or night and she wears them while she works since she works on a computer a lot. The gloves are open at the finger tips which is great as she types. So far, this has been a great purchase."
5.0,"These fit my 6 y.o. great!  I had her using mine but they were much too big.  These are lightweight and fit her face comfortably.  It comes with a nice case and glasses cleaner cloth, which she loves too!"
5.0,I have 2 pairs of these.  They are my favorite!
5.0,The sleeves hung low but overall it was cute and fit well.
5.0,Love these glasses. They are very stylish.  I have gotten tons of compliments on them!
5.0,Love this panda bear charm will go nice on my Pandora bracelet
5.0,"My daughter LOVED it!  Material was exactly what we expected and fit perfectly.  She is only 15 and we ordered an extra small.  I can tell you, THANKFULLY, the neckline did NOT look like the models.  Maybe if you order it in a larger size, tried to pull it down in order to show your belly button, and unlaced it a lot you could achieve the same look."
5.0,Found these perfect to wear with winter sweaters.
5.0,I ordered these to use with a Juicero cold press juicer and they are the EXACT right height to keep the juice from shooting past the glass and the perfect diameter for the juice to fill right to the top just as it finishes pressing.<br /><br />The glasses have a nice solid thick base that allows for a comfortable feel in hand.<br /><br />One of ours arrived broken as they were poorly packaged by Amazon but I don't fault the product for this.
5.0,"Looks great, fits well. Overall good quality and would buy again."
5.0,The product looks even better in person
5.0,I love these earrings for every day and I love that they came with a bracelet to share with a friend.
5.0,Print was better than expected MIL loved it would order again
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! Just buy them! You won't be sorry!!!"
5.0,awesome rings perfect as described!
5.0,Nice size and look.
5.0,This fits great.  I am a size 6 and it fits nicely.  I like that they are thinner than the other ones I bought. I forget I am even wearing it.  I like the choice of colors as well.
5.0,"These computer glasses are a good value for the money, they colors are nice the blue is blue, the frame is a little larger than expected but who cares, when they are being used in front of the computer and they do the job of protecting your eyes.  I am satisfied.  Thankful!"
5.0,I received so many compliments when I wore it the other day. It’s also nifty that the dress has pockets.
5.0,My 5 year old granddaughter loves this and hopes it rains so she can use it!
5.0,"El vestido ppr el precio que tiene esta muy bien!, la tela es fresca es de algodón por el momento nonse transparenta. Lo lave a mano porque me da miedo que la tela ennla lavadora se estire. Me queda algo más largo de lo que esperaba. Compré la talla ""M"" que es mi talla y el vestido me quedo a la perfección.  es cómodo y fresco."
5.0,"So soft,  so comfy!"
5.0,She ended up pregnant after wearing this.
5.0,the night gown is very comfortable & it is well made.
5.0,Bought these for my wife. She reports these pajamas are soft and comfortable. XL fit is as expected.  Material is lightweight and flattering.  Elastic with drawstring waist.  Machine wash and dries well.
5.0,"Took a bit to receive but they were worth it, I love them"
5.0,"Soft, warm, washes very well.  Most ankle length gowns are too long for short women.  This one does not trail on the floor.  Perfect length."
5.0,"They just came and I was surprised to see that they were velvet! I had assumed they were faux suede or PU leather, but was not unhappy to be wrong. They seemed comfortable for the short circle I walked to test them out. The material does seem a little thin, but I have yet to test how it holds up. I hope these last for a long time."
5.0,"high quality Tank Tops,  the fabric is soft that you just wait for an opportunity to wear it again. Like the color as well and it looks good on me. Overall recommend this product!"
5.0,"Slot of people are upset about the price tag that comes on both the zipper ID case and lanyard because they paid more that what it says, but honestly it’s onlt a few dollars and so worth it for convenience! I love these lanyards!! This one is super bright and beautiful and I was so excited to receive it!"
5.0,I get do many compliments on these
5.0,"Great purchase, stash a pair in every room of the house and car... nice combo selection"
5.0,"These glasses are great and I highly recommend anyone to purchase a pair! I used to own a pair of $200 glasses and I prefer these way more! The glasses look good on any face and the polarized lens are a plus. The glasses are built well and the size is perfect for most heads. Everyone comments on my new glasses, yet they don't know I got them for only 10 bucks!!!!!!!"
5.0,"Super cute, just more fitted in the hips than I like, but I have a large hip to waist ratio. A little tight in the arms."
5.0,Love them but are a bold frame.
5.0,Beautiful......love them......they are small in size.
5.0,thxs
5.0,This Dress Fits Perfect And Came On Time... Thank You And I Look Forward To Ordering Again In The Future.
5.0,"I wasn't sure how I would like it.  It is really beautiful, and makes my curves more attractive.  Good Quality, and soooooo cute.<br />Thank you."
5.0,"I bought both the black and yellow versions of this swim suit and I'm happy with them both!<br />For reference I'm 5'2&#34; and very newly 125lbs.<br /><br />I ordered small for them both because I read that the suits really seem geared towards taller women. I'm glad I did. I would agree with the other reviewers.<br /><br />The black one is basically perfect. The strings didn't scrunch and the front was very forgiving of any pooch.<br /><br />The yellow one however did seem a little haphazardly finished.  There are thread pieces that were not cut odd and the zipper had excess zipper fabric that wasn't cut off. I can handle this trivial task.  The strings that make up the design for the suit do scrunch up a bit in the back, and little in the front. I think if I had a chest or a worthy booty it would probably fit perfectly.<br /><br />I'm still rating them 5 stars because they are adorable and the colors are awesome."
5.0,"These slippers are so beautiful they can pass for shoes! They are comfortable, well made, truly a work of art and I love them."
5.0,Good rteplacement lenses
5.0,She's an art deco fan
5.0,You can dress this up or down; it’s pretty.
5.0,"Ordered this beaded lanyard to carry my ID badge and keys at work. It’s a string and stylish alternative to ordinary woven ones, and the subtle colors of the beads go well with just about any outfit I wear. I don’t use the phone strap, which is also attractive, so can’t comment on its usefulness."
5.0,"Great suit. Elastic on the bra band could be better, it’s a bit tight so it’s a tad difficult to put on."
5.0,Love👍
5.0,"This glasses did help me a lot ,when I am driving in the night time.It filter the strong lighting and lighting up the dark side. But only use it in the night time .donot ever try it in the day time .The yellow tint glass reduced the brightness of direct incoming lights deeicently. It is also very light. Over all worth a try for  it price"
5.0,I love this skirt! I always order one size up in scarlet darkness in case the elastic isn’t there. This one had a way to tighten it. It will be perfect for my trip to England this summer!
5.0,This product is exactly what it shows
5.0,I really love this belt! Easy to fix to your size and very sturdy.
5.0,Great material and flows. It’s a beautiful dress highly recommend.
5.0,I had purchased these for a couple of ladies I mentored for a year.  They came with their own storage casements and the quality was to my satisfaction!! Will order again should the occasion present itself!!
5.0,My daughter love it. Thank you.
5.0,Slim and fit just what I need. No bulk no mess.
5.0,easy to put on
5.0,Is a good bagpack the quality is very good
5.0,They are so delicate and elegant. All that I wanted... I am very happy I bought them.
5.0,Love this. Wonderful color and good fabric. The only weird thing is that the edges aren't finish so I'm worried about washing it. I got mine a litter bigger than I normally wear but I wanted it to have a loose fit. I got the medium and my measurements are 36 bust(34D)  29 waist and it fits just how I wanted.
5.0,Love this! Wear it all the time in memory of my recent loss.
5.0,Longer length and light weight for summer
5.0,Love this top. Very pretty and forgiving of mommy pouch and back fat. Breast part is a little sparce but I used double sided skin tape to make sure I didn't experience a wardrobe malfunction. I'd definately buy other colors.
5.0,Very nice little string bag. High quality. I use it for a variety of things.
5.0,Worth  every penny
5.0,"I ordered the Grey one, and  really like it!  It is really cute and I like the color. I like the size I can fit lots of stuff in the main compartment with out it being all bulky and big.  The material it is light and still has structure so it sits up nice and is not all floppy. The front compartments/pockets aren't as useful as I hoped. The zipper on the front left is really small and cant fit much in it besides my chap stick. and the flap on the front looks like it would be another pouch but it is only for looks there is no pocket there. I like it so much I even ordered another one in black."
5.0,Omg......... When I tell u reviewers  out there....<br />I. LOOOOOOVE MY CAT BAG!!!! ITS SOOOO CUTE!!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  VERY 😄😄😄😄😄VERY HAPPY
5.0,"I wore these heels from 4PM - 2AM at a wedding and did not think of my feet ONCE. I was completely comfortable the entire night and was so amazed by the fact that my feet, back, or legs were not throbbing! I am buying another pair because these were such a success. I would (and am) recommending these to anyone and everyone I know. I would love for Crocs to make these in close toe as well so I can continue to wear these heels for comfort in different settings. I loved the sole beads, the height, the ease of wearing, and the light-weight nature of these shoes. Thank you!"
5.0,I am in love with this cover up!
5.0,Just beautifully made. Looks just like the picture.
5.0,MY DAUGHTER-IN -LAW LOVES BUTTERFLIES.AND THESE ARE PERFECT FOR HER. THEY ARE DAINTY AND LIGHT SHE WILL LOVE THEM!The price was great too!
5.0,These are my husband's favorite hats!
5.0,"I love these earrings !!!!!! I got them fast and I put them on already . I sleep with them , take showers, no problem! Very happy with them , I totally recommend them !"
5.0,I didn’t expect to love this cardigan when I choose it. I often have difficulty getting the right fit but this fit like a glove. Can be worn as a casual or a bit dressier sweater.
5.0,Runs a little bigger but I like the comfort
5.0,Very cute and great for sensitive ears!
5.0,I wore these skirts for quite a while. Loved them. Just moved on recently.

5.0,👍😂
5.0,Soft and I love the colors mixed in with the blue.  I love that it doesn't itch like some of my other scarfs.
5.0,Worked great on my trip.
5.0,Love it !!!!
5.0,"Excelente producto, la mejor mochila para viaje practica ayuda mucho con la distribución del peso en la espalda."
5.0,I wrote the wrong review for this product!  This product was absolutely fantastic!
5.0,My best friend and I both absolutely love these! We wear them all the time
5.0,Perfect for under button down sweaters and suits.  Long enough to even wear alone as a mid drift top.  Shipping was fast.  Very happy with purchase.
5.0,Ordered up  and glad I did. Love the dress. Great for that beach part theme.
5.0,Top quality and beautiful!  The case cover & cleaning cloth are like silk!
5.0,Perfect summer wear! can't wait ti wear this!
5.0,Love this top!  The fit is flattering and I really like the solid and print combination!  I get a lot of compliments when I wear this top!
5.0,"This is a case of “you get what you pay for.”  This shirt ain’t cheap but I’d rather have a $40 shirt which lasts for years than a $20 Wallyworld special that’ll fall apart within a year.  It looks nice, there is a crisp contrast between the colors (black & white).  I vary in size between a medium and large. I’m 5’7” 180 lbs and a large fit me great. Nice and loose without being baggy. Very comfortable."
5.0,"When I broke my old Polar Shield large ""fit-over"" sunglases I needed a replacement.  Polar Shield no longer makes the same model.  OverxCast and Solar Shield both make sunglasses that look identical to my old Polar Shield so I bought one of each.  No comparison.  The Overcast glasses have better optical clarity and sturdier frame construction.  The Overcast glasses were shipped in a box by Amazon and came in a plastic case - not much chance of the glasses getting broken in transit.  In contrast, the Solar Shield glasses where shipped in used paper by a 3rd party with virtually no protection and no case.  I was surprised they arrived unbroken.  To top it all off, the inferior Solar Shield glasses cost more.  I hope someone can learn from my experience."
5.0,fit as described
5.0,"Perfect fit, exactly as described. Would order again if need be."
5.0,Everything is very good
5.0,I purchased these thinking they were cute and would be great for winter.<br />Well I was pleasantly surprised. They are cuter in person and absolutely great<br />for all kinds of weather.. esp winter but she is using them now with no complaints.<br />These are perfect for the little princess in your life.<br /><br />BUY THEM!! They are beyond awesome in person!!
5.0,"I don't buy a lot of Reebok clothes so I was happy that this turned out to be a such a nice shirt. The review asked to rate ""Thickness"" and the material is thick as in good quality but not in a way that makes working out uncomfortable. It fits well and was a very good price. Will buy more like this!"
5.0,Bought these as a gift for my husband. He's very satisfied with them. Very light and fit his face very well.
5.0,I like the material of the turtleneck and the fit and good price
5.0,"Super nice colors, well made with comfortable straps. Love these masks!"
5.0,Perfect for fall/winter with jeans and a vest!
5.0,"When I ordered this, I had no idea it came with an identical set of pajamas for a doll. My daughter is beyond thrilled. Pajamas are pretty true to size and held up well when I washed them, and the fabric is very soft."
5.0,Given as a gift.  Fit him perfectly.  He reports it was perfect for a Spring or Fall day.
5.0,Great anklet I’ve now been wearing it for weeks without taking it off including a week Long Beach vacation where it has gone in the ocean and in sand! I never take it off and the clasp is still holding on! 10/10 recommend great price for a great product! Super cute!
5.0,Love this maxi dress. Very comfortable. Love the colour.
5.0,Love this blouse. The necklace was pretty but do wear them so will give it away.  I ordered the XL and love the fit. Normally I wear a L so hope that helps. The color is as pictured and love that also. Will order again.
5.0,"I dont have too much to say other than this bag is awesome. Amazing workmanship, material, quality stitching, great grip on the shoulder strap, plenty of room. I use this bag everyday to carry my essentials around NYC. It's perfect. And wayyy under priced. Get it while it's still this price!"
5.0,Fits well so far which is what I am &#34;looking&#34; for. Could be a &#34;cool&#34; look as emergency sun glasses.
5.0,Love the look and feel. Good at keeping me warm as well. Very happy with purchase. Used manufacturer's size guide and it fits perfectly.
5.0,This is a very comfortable pair of pants. They look stylish but they are super comfy and stretchy
5.0,This clutch was lovely.  I would recommend it.
5.0,Me and my mom love these pants there so comfortable and they fit perfectly it's good to work out in and you can wear them almost anywhere an anytime.
5.0,They are not sheer - that’s a good thing. Can’t stand to see women with sheer tights and their underoos showing through!?<br />Thick enough but not too thick. Good value for leggings with pockets.
5.0,perfect pandemic dress - 10/10
5.0,Great fit and comfortable shoes.
5.0,Exactly what I ordered.  They look great and are very comfortable.
5.0,Granddaughter loves Hoggle and these shirts. Had to get extras so they can be washed.
5.0,"These are beautiful and very affordable. I purchased 5 based on customer reviews and I'm very pleased.  Much prettier in person and do not feel or look cheap.  The front part of the necklace is slightly flexable with an attached adjustable chain.  Stones and beads feel secure. If you're wondering about how it fits on larger necks, I tried one on my 6', 230 pound husband with room to spare. It also looked great on my petite mom. (5'1&#34; 120 pounds) Very dressy, so probably not suitable for casual wear. I am giving these as Christmas gifts. Please order early because shipping is slow, (it's worth the wait)."
5.0,"Came with a bag for the glasses, inside a box with a cleaning cloth. Looks great and does it job, what more can u ask for at the price."
5.0,"Cute top, perfect for summer"
5.0,"I bought several of these now, we use them for bachaloriat gifts at church, they are perfect for the men, I do not recomend for women, it is a heavy sturdy cross on a ball chain, which is perfect for the graduating men. This is a very attractive cross as well, ,so it is perfect !"
5.0,"I bought this dress to use as a cover up for my swimsuit since we are planning a vacation soon.  I must absolutely say that I was pleasently surprised when this package arrived.  The color is so beautiful and the pattern looks great.  The style of the dress matches perfectly with the look and it fits beautifully.  The dress itself is made of an airy thinner material which makes it extremely nice for those hot days.  If you put a tank top under the dress I think you would be fine to wear this as a dress alone.  I absolutely love this dress and would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />I have included the product info below.<br /><br />Drawstring closure<br />SIZE: Bust 39&#34;-46&#34;; Length 37&#34;. One size fits most(M/L/XL/2XL), there is a tie-string to adjust the size to fit you perfectly.<br />Material:Polyester.<br />This casual dress can also be used as a swimsuit cover-up, cocktail dress, sleepwear night gown, wearing with a leggings will be pretty too!<br />The fabric is lightweight and extremely comfortable, stylish.<br />ELACUCOS owns its own trademarks.

5.0,Highly recommend. Great price and value
5.0,"snug fit, just right around shoulders, seems to keep shape after a few washings already."
5.0,"Perfect for my adopted daughter for<br />Nurses Day. Well made, colorful, and fast delivery."
5.0,"This is nicely made Pearl Necklace. Once unraveled it is as described at 48&#34; long. The pearls are stringed at the right tightness. It is as pictured, arrived as promised and very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"The strap was too tight first time which pushed the googles against my glasses into my face. Loosened strap and now position googles over my glasses then slide strap over my head, Very good wide angle vision."
5.0,this dress is comfortable and fit is quite flattering.  Plus it's great to have pockets that still leave the dress flowing properly.
5.0,Good quality crew.
5.0,Perfect for a spring or fall evening
5.0,These slippers are very comfortable and it feels like I'm walking are air.
5.0,"Really great work out leggings. I am the type of person that never buys expensive brands.  I have definitely heard of gym shark leggings. In fact, my sister has some. We compared the material. It's practically the same. I will definitely be buying more!"
5.0,Very warm gloves. These gloves feel high quality and extremely comfortable. They seem like the would cost much more than what I paid. I would expect them to last many winters and I like the fact that I can grab things with ease while keepi my hands warm and toasty!
5.0,"I have tried many different brands and these seem to be the best...so far. The 3mm rope is strong but not bulky. Rubber ends seem to grip tight. I have been wearing them every day for 10 days and still no signs of slipping or splitting rubber ends. I am happy I bought the 2 pack. This way when the first pair does eventually wear out, I will have a backup. Made in the USA. Excellent price as well!"
5.0,This is a great set! If you are into fitness or hiking this is a great track suit light weight but warm very great gift
5.0,Metal has an excellent weight and feel.  I imagine the patina will only become better with use.
5.0,"Really like this dress. It is a bit cheap, but it fits pretty well and it's cute. Follow the size chart! I am a size 16/18 and usually wear and XL or 2XL, but I got the 4XL and it fit well, may have gotten away with a 3XL but the tie is helpful to accentuate your curves. Over all, not bad, was what I expected."
5.0,"Good but beware of the clasps. They have a gap that lets the, fall off.<br />Either use a pliers to tighten or replace the clasps."
5.0,Liked that they work
5.0,I love these sunglasses.  The color is very pretty and the lenses are colorful and dark enough to protect my eyes.  They fit well over my prescription lenses (I do recommend measuring one's prescription lenses and order accordingly).  They also look much more like &#34;regular&#34; sunglasses without looking like Fit Overs.  These are my 2nd pair of Fit Over's--I still have my older pair and wear them from time to time.  I have had them for many years.  I also ordered my husband the same pair in black with blue lenses.  He had been very happy with his glasses as well.  Overall I am happy with these sunglasses.
5.0,Nice necklace ..... it was too small for my neck .... make sure you are aware of your neck size  make sure it was not too small... I returned the necklace and received the credit very fast. I will order again from the company !!!!
5.0,"its good to use when trying to hide piercings. however, if you put in the top piece that holds it in place, its noticeable. so i just dont even put that part in. At first i thought i broke it when i was trying to take the top off but its meant to be like that. its quite flexible and it was a good purchase"
5.0,Bought it for my daughter she loves it.
5.0,I would have been a little happier if the information for manufacturing had not been imprinted on the material.
5.0,It was a gift not much mentioned.
5.0,Bracelet was even prettier in person. Very heppy with item. Nicely packaged also.
5.0,Love these bags!
5.0,Nice case for two glasses.  It protecting them from being squished. Very convenient. Easy to find in my crowded bag.
5.0,Just as I expected.  I love it!
5.0,I think the cord could have been better quality But it works fine as is
5.0,I got these so my daughter could play in the snow when we visited the mountains.  What I didn’t foresee was a 2.5 mile hike up a mountain and back down.  She rocked it even in these boots.  No blisters and her feet were dry.  I was pleasantly surprised.
5.0,Bought for tennis and casual wear.<br />Have the item in several colors.The fit differs slightly on each one.
5.0,Absolute quality and style all wrapped up in one great sock.
5.0,Love the bead's design and color - made a wonderful addition to my collection.  Looks great - get a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,"great quality, sturdy, lots of room yet comfortable to sit on."
5.0,"Much nicer than expected and long enough to fit my 6'2"" husband. Satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,Very cute choker! Love the way it fits but don't move around a lot or else the clasp will break off (easily fixable)
5.0,I’ve been looking for a good full foot over the counter insert for a long time. These are perfect for people with flat feet.
5.0,"Nice head rap, love the pattern!"
5.0,These are so very cool!!!
5.0,"Really comfortable, has held up in the washer/dryer. Also definitely buy it here versus the official website because it’s free shipping instead of like eight dollars shipping."
5.0,"This lab coat is thicker and more durable than costume lab coats for a similar price. I got this one for my little mad scientist and she rarely takes it off. Great quality, and it came with an adorable user’s manual that cracked us up."
5.0,I bought it for my mom and she loves it
5.0,This costume is very well made. I am 5’5 155 lbs and the Large fit perfectly. Delivery was super quick. 5 stars!
5.0,My granddaughter wears a size 5 jeans and these panties fit
5.0,"Very easy to walk in. Cute bootie for a date night, girls night out,  or dancing."
5.0,These are excellent to keep socks on sweet little feet that like to curl.
5.0,"These glasses are cute and comfortable. They're a little bigger than expected but it doesn't bother me. They protect my eyes enough, which is what I care about."
5.0,"I absolutely love this skirt and I was a little bit hesitant ordering from Sheln...it had one review, so I winged it and I'm glad I did. It does run a tad small, but it fits like a dream and is the perfect length. It looks and fits just like the picture shows. Plus, it's LINED and I'm obsessed. I wear it with tights and the fabric is slightly suede-ish so cat hair and fuzz sticks to it, but it doesn't get caught up on my tights, which is nice. Just order a size up and you'll be good to go!"
5.0,The only thing missing from this product is bluetooth capability. Other than that it's a pretty cool watch.
5.0,Great coverage for busty girls. Helps hold everything up but also have a slimming factor in the stomach area. Super flattering.
5.0,These are really great fitting leggings!!
5.0,"love it, fast shipping"
5.0,"Comfortable dress, I used my own belt with it instead of the one it comes with. So many compliments on this dress, especially on the sleeves. Fit perfectly."
5.0,"Completely satisfied. Comfortable, clear vision."
5.0,Fit as expected. Comfortable
5.0,Love this purse so much! It glows in the dark like it said. I have noticed while using it the design on the inside on the corner is rubbing off a little (it's the side that rubs against my side.)
5.0,My son loved this and was so sad he grew out of them
5.0,"Sometimes the silicone bands bother my wrist. I wash them carefully with mild soap and water, but I feel like they trap moisture throughout the day. This band is light, stretchy enough and breathable. Fit my Garmin Venu 2s. Only con was getting the new band on was a little difficult but once I figured it out it was perfect."
5.0,"Awesome shoes! I was a tad skeptical due to price. But they turned out to be awesome, feet don't sweat, they are soft and comfy. I have bought several pair for my mother in law and mom and they all love it!"
5.0,"I really love this choker! Fits great, it is adjustable for different neck widths!"
5.0,"I am a boy, so the chest part doesn't quite look right. The only other complaint is it sometimes feels weird around my neck, but I generally hate anything around my neck anyways so, that is a personal gripe and nothing else. Other than that, its cute as hell, beyond cozy."
5.0,"Ready to spice up that bedroom activity?  Get these (if your partner is on board). Easy to use. Easy to quickly undo if necessary. And holy crap. You won’t be disappointed if this is a new world to you. I’m sure there are better and more sophisticated ones out there but these are around $10-20 and perfect.  Also, did I mention that they’re good for doing sex? Bc they are good for doing sex"
5.0,"I love this dress. It was perfect, initially it was supposed to be for fall pictures.. but life happened lol. We wore it to the pumpkin patch and out to eat. It’s a great length, even in the sleeves. It can be pulled off in warm/ cool weather. The material is a little thin but not to where it looks cheap i would Just suggest hand washing it, that’s what I did."
5.0,"This outfit fits perfect,I was invited to an event,and this outfit was turning heads ,so it's a yes to purchase"
5.0,Very cute for my Disney bracelet. It's as described.
5.0,This is a FANTASTIC pair of sunglasses. Not too dark- I wear them on both cloudy and sunny days as well as indoors. Fits my face well and aren't always slipping down my nose. Beautiful color. I definitely need a few pairs as back up.
5.0,"Nice medium-heavy denim with 2 pockets.  Really stiff, but after running thru the laundry they are very comfortable shop aprons. The drawstrings could be a little stouter, but if they break it's an easy repair.  An absolute steal at 2 for $10.00!!!"
5.0,Much daintier than I imagined but perfectly beautiful.
5.0,Loved everything about this dress!
5.0,Husband seems to like the
5.0,These flip on sunglasses fit my Warby Parker Ainsley frames like a glove.
5.0,Arrived quickly. Good material.
5.0,Really nice wallet. It is larger than a normal wallet and is perfect!
5.0,Got size xl for oversized look and fit. Very happy with the quality.
5.0,Nice hat good quality and look nicer than your typical orange blaze hat. I would recommend it to a friend but I like the idea of having a hat that is a little different.
5.0,"I bought this to wear to a local hospitals awards ceremony and I was complimented constantly by everyone about how much they loved my dress! Paired with some simple black heels, it is seriously a show-stopper! I am THRILLED with this purchase! It's the best ""little black dress"" that fits comfortably but is still stylish."
5.0,Hat was just as I expected.
5.0,TTS! Super soft and comfy. Love it!
5.0,"Paid 99$ for this hat and I'd say it's worth it! Some things to know is that the brim width is larger in the front half of the hat then the back half (approximately); but it needs to be that way if you want the &#34;floppiness&#34; aspect and the drooping over your eye! I got the champagne color and its similar to an off-white. Perfect hat because with the feathers it gives you that right amount of uniqueness, but the hat won't over power your dress. I'll be wearing this beauty to my 5th Kentucky derby this year, think it'd also be great for an Easter church service or as a wedding hat"
5.0,"Durable, kid loved them. Total value for my money"
5.0,I have bought several of these types of shirts from different brands and loooved these.  The cups in the bra part are the right size and actually make the girls look great.  I bought a 3xl as I am 42D and the shirt fit great and feels great on.  Have not washed yet but these are my new go to built in bra shirts.
5.0,"I liked the quality, it has bright colors and the size was perfect."
5.0,"In an instant, my favorite black leather Jack Rogers purse was fixed. I hadn’t been able to use it because the edge of the strap became frayed. This replacement strap was the most economical and fast way to repair my purse. I’m very pleased with the quality of leather and finish."
5.0,"This purse is amazing! It is larger enough to take shopping, or everyday. I use it for work and shopping, I don't have to take my phone out in public and worry about possibly getting germs on it or losing it. It has compartments, a zipper for coins, and plenty card slots! The shoulder strap is adjustable. This is a nicely designed purse for the price."
5.0,"This dress is beautiful. It fits snug, but order up and your golden. It feels really well made too."
5.0,for our grandson and he loves it
5.0,Mild stretch.  Great lenth for arms. Just a little longer in the stomach area for a crop top. But over all.fits nice.
5.0,It’s so cute but it did fall off of the chain the second day I put it in my bag :/ and I can’t get it back on
5.0,"Shs really loves it! Super soft and co.es with a mask, hair tie and and carrying bag also, I didnt even know ha."
5.0,Looks great and fits perfect.
5.0,"This dress is so comfortable. And it doesn’t wrinkle. It’s easy to throw on, wear with cute sandals or a pair of sneakers and run around. I want to buy it in more colors! Easy breezy"
5.0,giving as a gift to our son so can't comment on how it fits. I can say the material is nice and product is well-made.
5.0,"I bought 5 different designs.  Kept 3 and gave one for my two teen daughters.  I used to buy these socks for them when they were little and sold with a ""spare""! So cozy and colorful.  My favorite kind of winter socks!<br />Mostly made of cotton, so I do not put these in the dryer."
5.0,Very stylish and comfortable
5.0,Perfecta la talla!
5.0,Really cute peplum crop top. I typically wear a medium in tops and order was true to size; there’s plenty of stretch as the fabric is very forgiving. However the top is pretty see-through so definitely must wear a bra and or bathing suit with it or your nips will show.
5.0,"I own several of these shirts now - in varying colors, both long and short-sleeved. I obviously like them enough to keep buying them.  They fit well, look good and have held up well in the wash.  I only wish that the long-sleeve version had pockets like the short-sleeve version.  The pockets accentuate the look (in my opinion) and add functionality. They also negate the need for an undershirt. The Mojito linen long-sleeve has pockets, but I have no interest in a linen shirt."
5.0,this is my 2nd pair like these....Love them!
5.0,"My son loves this watch. It looks exactly as advertised and is of very high quality for the price we paid. I wish the band were a little longer. My son is a big boy, so that has an impact, but I still think it could be about 3/4&#34; longer on both sides. But we can pretty daily get it replaced."
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my mom, and she LOVES them! She keeps raving about how soft and comfy they are. She wears a size 10 shoe, so the large (10-11) fit her perfectly."
5.0,"Great for the price! You can definitely tell they're not Ray-Bans quality (the stems are a bit uneven in terms of stiffness when moving), but at 1/40th of the price, I'm not complaining."
5.0,"Exactly what I expected, packaged nicely."
5.0,"I love this watch! As other people have posted in reviews, the band is very long but I have gotten used to it and the excess stays in place under the top part of the band. Very easy to read. Has kept good time so far. So comfortable I forget sometimes to take it off at night. Great watch especially for the price."
5.0,My sons absolutely love these glassed.  Amazon has better prices on them than anywhere I have found.  They made good Christmas presents.
5.0,Love the organization in this bag!
5.0,Love it! Classic Swatch with a modern sugar skull design!
5.0,Cute & handy! Just ordered another for my camera backpack. Multiple compartments for cords.
5.0,Wore these to Rocky Horror Picture Show. This did not disappoint!
5.0,Nice dress. Fit well
5.0,Beautiful bag!  Better than expected.
5.0,Looks beautiful and just as pictured
5.0,"Very pretty little studs. Black opalescent isn't pure black, so don't expect that. I love them. The 6mm size is perfect. They pair very nicely with diamond earring jackets."
5.0,"Hubby loves it, but sizes run a tad small. Be sure to order a larger."
5.0,Much better quality than I expected. I wear a lot of scarves and was happy to add this one to my collection for color coordination~
5.0,They make my 9 year old daughter look like a CIA asset.
5.0,"Thick,  built in linner.  Very good quality!"
5.0,"The watch only lasted about a month and tore up. First watch which was identical to the second watch purchased tore up in a week.  Love the style, but I will not be purchasing a third one."
5.0,Good quality. Fits perfectly
5.0,It fits perfectly! Very well made and comfortable.
5.0,Great variety of colors. I bought these for end of the year gifts for my students and ended up keeping a few for myself.
5.0,I love the charm. It was exactly as described. I ordered eight different months for my grandchildren's birth months and they are all the same size which looks wonderful on my Grandmother necklace.
5.0,Bought this for my grandson and he loves it great thanks 👍🏻
5.0,Beautiful dress! 5’9” so it was more midi length on me but still cute! It is not lined so I wore a slip.
5.0,Needed these to with the retro.
5.0,Quiero saber si le sirve al ftw2115
5.0,"I am in love with this dress!!! Super comfortable, hangs great, fabric is not too thin or thick, but beautifully flowy. Not very deep v neck (dips to the very top of my cleavage), but I am sooo happy about that. It is long, but I am fine with that. I got an XS and I am 5'4&#34; 135. It took a two weeks to get here, but I will buy a few more colors."
5.0,So soft wish they came in mommy sizes!!! Love them our daughter loved them for winter!
5.0,"This short is quite comfortable and can be used for any type of training, it has a small pocket with the capacity to store keys and a pocket on the inside front in which you can place the cell phone, the material is of a superior quality for  which makes it more durable and comes in the correct size.  It is an excellent product that will accompany you during all your workouts."
5.0,Love this mask. Really nice quality. Extra filter a bonus. The only one my son wants to wear.
5.0,Very pleased with my purchase....the bibs are a great size and the snaps are a perfect fit.  Fast shipping and can't beat the price.
5.0,Very nice appearence.
5.0,My daughter loves this! Great material and cute
5.0,"I am 5'3"" and 100lbs so am definitely on the petite side. The size 4 of this dress fit me perfectly. It's fitted but not tight like a bodycon dress. It is flattering but definitely work appropriate. This dress hit me just below my knee and was very walkable due to the small slit at the back. I got a ton of compliments on this dress and will be buying it in more colors."
5.0,We gave this as a gift to each of our moms for Christmas & they both loved them!! They're great quality!!
5.0,Great deal.  I gave these out to my daughter's kindergarten classmates for her birthday party and they all loved them.
5.0,A quality hoodie requested by our granddaughter for her 11th birthday. It was perfect!
5.0,"This dress fits perfectly as described.  I received a lot of compliments because of the style and color.  You can wear for work and then ""dress"" it up for afterwards at night.<br />The material is comfortable on skin and in my home area of Phoenix it was just the right ""weight"" of material.  I did also use a long cardigan sweater at night that went perfectly with it.<br />Unbelievable price for this product."
5.0,"Heavy chain n long enough to place over my head,I like stainless steel n it was reasonable,no need to spend a lot of dollars that I don't have,when u have some many options on amazon"
5.0,It's a casio. If you're looking at reviews for a casio than you must not see everyone wearing them for 1000s of years
5.0,"I absolutely love these! So much cuter in person, have yet to use them though."
5.0,"The tank fit as expected. The material was soft, it's a nice shirt."
5.0,"I like this nose ring. I'm allergic to metals besides titanium and I've not had a reaction.<br /><br />Note that the ring is small (which is why I'm including a pic). The diameter may not be large enough for someone with a bigger nose. When a diameter choice is offered, I always get the smallest one."
5.0,"Loved the dress, but didn’t know it was dry clean:("
5.0,Great quality...Perfect gift for my daughter's softball team :)
5.0,"I was iffy with some of the reviews, but this is an authentic product, it is true to color and it does come with the storage bag. I almost threw the storage bag away because it was in with the packaging on the inside of the purse. It's a great size, I bought it for school, it fits my 13&#34; MacBook Pro, a notebook and a bunch of pens, ny wallet and all my charging cords with no problem. In love with this bag!!!"
5.0,"Just wore these on flights from Washington, DC to Honolulu.  Feet never got tir d or cramped."
5.0,Was delivered timely..and has worked wonders on my Silver..thank you for a great product
5.0,Sister loved it
5.0,Good material for the price. Its like a thick silk material that doesn't stick to your skin. Love the colour and straps are adjustable so fits me perfect! 5'3 52 kg got small.
5.0,"I purchased this as gift, I think it looks beautiful. I hope the recipient agrees."
5.0,These actually are the most comfortable flat flip floss I have ever worn. Especially if you have a little bit of wider feet. Even then they are still a little lose on me which makes them even better
5.0,Great to keep sun off of you as you fish or mow the yard
5.0,They’re awesome. Will use them again and again.
5.0,Love this minimalist Picto watch. Great seller and packaging. It looks even better in person. I got the 30mm because I didn't want anything too big or bulky. It's perfect. I had this in my cart for almost two years and finally pulled the trigger. Wish I had done it sooner. It's  absolutely beautiful.
5.0,So much prettier than in the picture. Definitely adds more of a glamorous or luxurious look to the watch. I love it!
5.0,"Very cute, stylish, feels comfortable. I would definitely recommend this top."
5.0,Beautiful twillies! Nice quality! Good deal!
5.0,The perfect understated band T.
5.0,I ordered up based on reviews and it fits great! Lots of compliments
5.0,"I'm really impressed with these. I'm in love. I have them in three colors and ordered two more. I have Lulus, Nike, and other very expensive brands and these are just the best!!!. Great fabric and no pilling so far. Been trying to find them in Navy but they're are sold out in my size.<br />Will update review if necessary. ;)"
5.0,Got this dress for my best friend to wear to a wedding.  Which i has a picture to show u but she is not a picture person.  The dress is true to size and fits confortable.
5.0,"I bought this chain for my cross, looks beautiful with it."
5.0,"I LOVE this dress! It's my go to for traveling and is fashionable enough to wear to work where I can simply add a belt, accessories, and a blazer."
5.0,This was the perfect gift for my mom and mother-in-law!  Both work great and there was plenty of space to add a photo inside. My only complaint was the gift box it came in... but hey- it was one hell of a good price so I still give it 5 stars
5.0,"Nice slim band with a pretty, easy to read face.  I am happy with my purchase."
5.0,Watch band fits perfectly and does not disappoint!
5.0,This is a quality hat.  I am very pleased with it.
5.0,Very cute and my granddaughter loves it!
5.0,"Cute little handbag, especially comfortable for long walks and evening dinners."
5.0,"They are almost perfect!  I love Gloria Vanderbilt jeans, that's all I buy.  The calories seemed to be just a little large, but the belt will help with that.<br /><br />Sunny D."
5.0,Very pretty and fast shipping<br />Thanks
5.0,Its so soft and comfy!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3cd04b34f839bbb36ab7388297eb0c54]] Super cute. It’s perfect size. The shorts don’t have any kinkng in them but still cute.
5.0,"I have gotten a ton of compliments on this shirt. The sizing fits perfectly, I'm 5'9&#34; and bought an XL. The arms and rest of the shirt are well fit to a standard XL. Also, the material is super soft and stretchy... always a bonus! I've seen reviews on this brand that the quality isn't great, I'll tell you, it's not the best I've bought . But for the price, the quality is outstanding.."
5.0,I only tried it on. I didn't where it to go out but for the few minutes I had it on the dress exceeded my expectations. The material is comfortable and not clingy. I bought XXL thinking it might run small but I could have purchased an XL.
5.0,"This dress is perfect! Love the comfortable fit. I’m 5”8, about 150lbs with a 34Cbra size. My build is a pear/hourglass figure. I would say for the price this is a great holiday dress. The color is a true navy. For my height I appreciate the length as well."
5.0,A great warm comfortable fit!
5.0,Just as described !
5.0,Super comfortable. Drys quicker than usual mesh water shoes.
5.0,"Perfect size for kids, product matches description, timely shipping"
5.0,i reallly like the case however on the computer screen it looked like it had two colors of purple i reallly liked it though
5.0,What you see is exactly what you get in perfect condition.  Can't say much more then good price for a good product.
5.0,"But I shortened the chain, I don't like long chains.."
5.0,Fits as expected but it is a fitted fit.
5.0,"Great fit, and super soft and comfortable."
5.0,"Great bag for travel.Room for all necessary items and folds up into compact case for carrying in suitcase.  Excellent price, excellent quality.  Easy transaction, timely delivery, no problems."
5.0,"Cute sunglasses, good quality too. They are holding up great.<br />The girls looked quite the part on their way to 1D concert!!<br />You can see the picture on the lenses when wearing, but the girls said it was fine!!"
5.0,love these pants!
5.0,I love these socks and would like some crew length to cover my ankles.<br />The thickened towel bottoms have a  design that seems to help my feet .<br />I also find they work nice as slippers…<br />A great idea with a bonus use!
5.0,Convenient and cute.<br />Holds all my purses
5.0,I love these jeans
5.0,Our kids love them
5.0,"I used this product to clean the leather cover on an old family Bible that is approximately 180 years old. The leather was in very poor condition, dry and covered with who knows how many layers of what. It was nearly black in color. After cleaning, a nice light brown color and the leather is now soft and pliable. Very pleased with this product."
5.0,I like that this inexpensive piece is perfect as a light shawl or scarf. THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT!!! I plan 2 wear it to a French class on Mardi Gras. I'm happy that I'll have a stylish Mardi Gras piece 4 years 2 come.
5.0,"Pretty color fits nicely-- I like this style , have 8 all different colors"
5.0,"Nice, large towel!  Good quality!  Bought for a gift and was pleased to gift this towel."
5.0,Warm and beautiful
5.0,"This cami is a perfect addition to my summer wardrobe! I never order clothing online but saw this one and for the price I couldn't beat it. I love the feel of the material although I am not sure exactly what the material is(label is written in Chinese). It does feel stretchy and soft.  I ordered the black color and it came as a nice rich black and hasn't faded. I typically wear a medium/large in most cami style shirts, this one I ordered the Xtra large and it fits perfectly. I like the built in bra cups, I am a 34DD and the cups fit nice. I could go out of the house with this shirt and not have to wear any extra support and still feel comfortable. I also like the length, its not too short and covers my hips. I have attached pics of the label and the way the cups look on the inside. Make sure to order at least one size up!"
5.0,Excellente...
5.0,Longer than thought but still satisfied with the necklace.
5.0,Very good quality and it came on time.
5.0,just the right size and fits perfectly
5.0,Muy bonitos y cómodos para las niñas
5.0,The item arrived in a very short period of time.  It was from my grandson to his mommy for Valentine's day...  The box was nice and the necklace was simply gorgeous.  He was so excited to give it to her and she absolutely adored it.  Very beautiful piece.
5.0,"I am 165 lb, 5'7"" and ordered the large in baby blue. The fabric is thicker than it looks from the picture, and so it gives structure/tailoring that I really like. The design fit me just right - the length is very short, it lands a few inches under my butt (it looks tasteful due to the thickness of the fabric), in the front the longer piece gives a little modesty. The large was the right size, as the dress pushes you in and out and needs to be a bit tight to achieve that effect. The straps are a little small and don't line up quite right, but it still looks good. I paired it with a long navy blue blazer and black pumps. Looked awesome."
5.0,"I thought this outfit was so classy great for the holidays and work events it fit nicely except a little too low on the strapless side but I think I might add a stitch to iti love the purple color it's long for me but I'm 4""11 so that's typical nothing some heals or a hem won't fix but all together nice outfit"
5.0,Excellent - very nice tight. The baby is a true 3T she can wear these as 3T and whens she is 4T great stretch! Can't speak to how they will be after washed.
5.0,"My grandson loves this watch. Very blingy which was what he wanted. It works well and has worn well, too."
5.0,"If you are looking for a way to honor & remember your loving pet - this is the item to purchase. It is beautiful & the engraving perfect. At the time I ordered this, my heart was broken - but this heart shape urn represents my cat in every way. I love it! I wear it all the time & it has not lost its shine or deep meaning to me. I wish no one had to even consider buying an urn, but if you do - I highly recommend this beautiful loving tribute."
5.0,Great quality...love it !!
5.0,I will Buy one more.
5.0,It works for my boyfriend
5.0,"I love this leotard , I got size 120 for my daughter 5 yrs old<br />It fits good with little space to grow"
5.0,Warm and fuzzy!  These keep my ears warm and fit well. Great earmuffs for the price! I highly recommend!
5.0,"I love these glasses. The color works well with our new Army uniforms, and they are very comfortable while providing good coverage and protection. The frames are fairly squared off, so consider that when you are deciding to buy. Just because they look good on me does not mean they will look good on your face shape."
5.0,I love this t-shirt! The colors are almost similar to the ones on the photos. The material feels nice on the skin and the size fits okay. Can’t wait to wear it.
5.0,Awesome helmet light weight
5.0,My little one loves her shirts and wants to wear them everyday and all night lol thank you
5.0,I love it. exactly what I expected.
5.0,Bold skull print.
5.0,This coat fit perfectly. I usually wear a size 10 top and 12 bottom and I am  5 foot and 7 inches tall.  It really looks great but I am looking for something very soft because of sensitive skin.
5.0,"Nice, especially for the price!,<br />5’7, 206lbs xl"
5.0,"Very nice, thin and comfortable. Love the red!"
5.0,Lovely pray shaw
5.0,"Nothing much to say. They are real stone, so with that being said, there may be some blemishes and color variations with the purple and white swirls. Smooth and polished, easy to put in.<br /><br />Would recommend!"
5.0,Beanie was comfy and warm. Decent protection from the elements.
5.0,My husband was extremely surprised to receive this watch as a gift. It is was exactly as described and is a very classy watch for the price.
5.0,"My son received this for his fourth birthday and it’s fantastic! It looks even better in person than pictures because some of the graphics have a sparkle to them. It’s the perfect size for a little one to carry around a few of their favorite things for fun. It’s small so it doesn’t weigh them down. He can fit his blankie in it and a few small toys. Again, perfect for a little bag to carry around for fun!"
5.0,"SOOO cute and comfy!! True to size, color and design!! There was also a cute woven bracelet taped to the back of their business card! Definitely will repurchase other colors!"
5.0,Love these rings. Looked for awhile online and found these. I get lots of complements on them.  Highly recommend
5.0,"Items was well presented, and appears to be of good quality. I haven't stopped wearing it with my suits, and I recently switched to a different color. It is like a different watch! Fits well, not too big, although bigger faced than a standard dress watch. All in all, a great product so far!"
5.0,Adorable on
5.0,"very nice bracelet, arrived quickly"
5.0,They feel nice and fit well
5.0,I love these glasses .. going shopping to buy another style .. definitely buy them
5.0,"This is a nice leotard for the money. I ordered the 4-6 size for my 2 1/2 year old, and it's fine with room to grow.  Washes well, but the color will run (learned the hard way)!  Very basic and cute!"
5.0,LOVE my new hat........Its what l expected. Fix like a glove even with my thick hair. It goes great with my shirt. Bought both from different companies VERY SURPRISED that Both COLOR matched.
5.0,"The perfect watch. Simple, small, light."
5.0,My daughter loves this leo! It is light enough that she can do all the movements needed and feels fun doing it!
5.0,"I LOVE THIS DRESS. Only one downfall, it is VERY low cut. I did have to add a few stitches to make sure the girls would stay in!"
5.0,Would have liked different colors. There were only a couple of colors available.
5.0,"I bought this to remove tarnish from some older but treasured Parker 75 pens that had been in the family for over 40 years.<br /><br />I was skeptical that just a cloth would remove the tarnish, especially on a delicate surface and with all sorts of irregular areas to reach.<br /><br />The two stage cleaning with an inner treated cloth followed by the outer polishing cloth worked very well, and made it fun to easily bring each pen back to it's glory.  Seeing is believing and I am sorry that I waited so long, but happy I found such a neat solution to cleaning these items."
5.0,got these for a friend and she loves them! very durable and stylish!
5.0,"Great material, loved it"
5.0,Very nice quality! Glad I got them.
5.0,I’ve gotten lots of compliments - lightweight and comfy fit.
5.0,Perfect for my sons!
5.0,"Great product, great price.  Fast service"
5.0,Love this. Ears stay warm. They stay were you out them and easy to store in pocket once done
5.0,Pendant has beautiful colors & details. Pendant is bigger than what I thought but I like it. I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it. The necklace is the right length.
5.0,The hat is exactly what I wanted and fits fine.
5.0,Producto satisfactorio
5.0,Great value for the price! Earrings are very good quality.
5.0,"It was suggested to try a stability bracelet to possibly help with my frozen shoulder. I didn't think it would do much, but others recommended this so I gave it a try. I am glad I did because I do feel a difference when I'm wearing it. I don't understand how or why it works, but I'm convinced. I will continue to wear one even after my shoulder heals."
5.0,I loved the color and quality of the case.
5.0,Very flattering and had the layers by belly covering any problem areas
5.0,"It is long enough, strong and very pretty. Love this one."
5.0,Loved  It
5.0,Perfect fit and comfortable<br />Love them.
5.0,Love my new purse
5.0,Cute comfy shoes
5.0,I read the reviews and they were accurate. So adorable. My daughter plays the violin and I know she will be thrilled to get this for Christmas.
5.0,Very nice jean
5.0,"I love pure cotton nightgowns, I can't sleep in any other fabric."
5.0,It fit perfit
5.0,Beautiful bracelet.  Haven't taken it off since I received it.<br />Nice brillance to the stones. Great value. Well made.
5.0,Sturdy rubber material that went on easy and fits perfect!
5.0,"Very soft, exactly what I needed for my baby."
5.0,So many compliments.
5.0,"If you are unsure about size definitely order a size down OR just wash it. Very stretchy, thicker cotton. Warning: I am 5'5 and curvy and the dress initially came down right at my knees but upon washing lost about 3.5 inches in length (only in length not too much lost on the rest of the dress). Other than that this is a very good and comfortable dress and great for the price."
5.0,It was perfect.  I love the color too!
5.0,I really like this when I open the box I was surprise how nice the necklace and the heart pendant so cute
5.0,"This two tone titanium bracelet is a nice 7.5 long, light weight bracelet.<br />The gold rectangle has a textured honeycomb look which is really pretty.<br /><br />The bracelet comes with a tool for removing links if necessary. I didn't need to remove any as the size was perfect but have used a tool like this and felt the design makes it really easy. The bracelet sits on the tool and you simply unscrew, remove the link and reattach. The tool also has two addition pieces underneath if you break one.<br />What I think people will love most is that the bracelet barely feels like you are wearing anything.<br />The underside of the bracelet has circular magnets which are supposed to be good for arthritis.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a discounted product for my honest opinion. My star ratings are exact based on Amazon's star descriptions.  My reviews are 100% honest and true based on my personal opinion not on a company’s description or request. No monetary compensation was offered or received."
5.0,The color is beautiful and we love that it fits a very small wrist.  The comfort level is better than anticipated. Thanks for a great product.
5.0,"Warm, comfy, well worth the money"
5.0,I great product
5.0,"Christmas gift for my daughter, she was very surprised.  She really liked them."
5.0,"Although this item is out of stock, I got it before it was as a birthday gift for a friend she loved them! Great quality I will be buying from them again!"
5.0,Beautiful!!  Fast shipping.
5.0,Got them quickly. Thanks!
5.0,This beautiful lovely pair of girl shoes are beyond I expected. They are gorgeous and I highly recommended them.
5.0,Very nice lightweight material. It goes with everything. You can dress it up or wear it with jeans.
5.0,very nice and warm
5.0,"Lovely scarf. I have no complaints. I purchased it with the intentions of using it for multiple occasions - such as tying up my hair at night or even during the day as a head scarf, or to simply wear it on cooler days in addition to whatever outfit I may be wearing that day.<br /><br />Also, I love the pattern and color. Goes with just about everything (in my opinion). Not to mention, great size. I tend to like my scarf a bit large, so this was perfect. Great buy, and I'll definitely be purchasing more scarves in the near future."
5.0,Love them. Will buy again.
5.0,Really cute dress. Quality as expected. I got one size smaller and it feet perfect.
5.0,I love the material and quality. I got this for my daughter and is her favorite sweatpants so far now.
5.0,Love this cap! Exactly what I was looking for. Well made. I'm ordering another one so I can give to my daughter. We both have 2 year old locs. I'm using the caps to sleep in. Super comfortable. Thank you!
5.0,"very beautiful necklace the picture is clear and bright it arrived much sooner then expected and included a little gift, very satisfied"
5.0,awesome set but a few of them got holes from loose stiching
5.0,"I absolutely love this coin purse! Great size, and quality. It took a while to come, but it did arrive way faster than I was told. It's exactly what I was expecting, which doesn't happen often. I have the worst luck ordering online."
5.0,"Nice watch for my 10 year old. He loves it and wears to school and sports. There is a 7 year battery warranty, but I am skeptical that watch would survive that long though. At the price I got for Amazon, am not much worried about its durability."
5.0,great porduct
5.0,Pouch is the perfect size. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,A FUN CHRISTMAS DRESS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER.
5.0,Great soccer shoe! I get compliments on them. And no one in my area has them.
5.0,Got these as a gift for my wife.  They immediately became her favorites.<br />The warmth of the wool along with the ability to use them with flip-flops.<br />A good combination.  I only wish they made them large 12-15 men’s shoe sizes.
5.0,Want these in every color
5.0,The first day I used them I had them too tight and was tempted to just send them back but I read in the instructions that these are not meant to be tight so I loosed them up thinking that they would not stay in place and would leak and to my surprise these stayed in place and did not leak. I am truly amazed at how these have such great clarity even though having odd shape of the glass. I absolutely would buy another pair and recommend them to friends and family!
5.0,Love it.Fits perfect.Looks great
5.0,Great windbreaker.
5.0,"Works well, sounds great. Please note that this is not compatible with the PlayStation 4, but Sony is working on a fix for this at the time of writing.I gave this to my mom's boyfriend who has a large head and it fit well."
5.0,"I first saw a nurse in an emergency room wearing these glasses and thought, what a great idea! Nice not having glasses bouncing around on your chest. These don't get in the way and go off and on in a literal snap! Love them and my husband does too."
5.0,Fabulous earring fast ship highly recommend seller two thumbs way way up.
5.0,Great product.  I've had this bracelet over a year and it still looks great.
5.0,Liked the coat. It looks nice and is comfortable. The lining is noisy.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Soft, supportive, removeable pads, stretchy. It is a free size, I'm a 34C and it fits perfectly."
5.0,I love the simple design & that bold color
5.0,"Was a little too short for my kid, but perfect with leggings. She loves it bc it twirls! Used for a Sam I Am costume."
5.0,"I'm 5'3 , 170lbs and this fit amazing!  I did use fashion tape to keep the shoulders on and used boob tape as I am a size 32G and all worked out. I did not have a shaper on so if you think you need one it's hard to wear one with a low back! I got many compliments and wore to a wedding for a formal attire!"
5.0,Such a cute dress and not too short. Fit just as expected and looks like good quality materials.
5.0,"Great price, and party favors! The kids loved these"
5.0,My daughter really liked the style and fit.  She didn't feel uncomfortable wearing them.
5.0,I bought this swim suit not knowing how beautiful it was. It fits very nice and hides the tummy well
5.0,These are good quality and very cute.
5.0,True to size and very comfortable.
5.0,I ordered this for mother for Mother's Day along with another brooch. My mother loved both of them. This was lovely but lightweight enough to wear on a cardigan.
5.0,"First try-on and this is the most comfortable elastic belt I've tried. It's nice to have a 1.5"" wide elastic belt, as most I've found are narrower. The material feels sturdy and strong, though it's durability is the only question as I still have to see how it holds up over time. Older belts stretched and got that curly bacon edge as the fabric wore.<br /><br />This belt lays flat and doesn't have an annoying sliding clip for sizing that always gets in the way. Very comfortable, secure, and seemingly well-made."
5.0,"I love the look of this sweater. Form fitting (at least on me). Nice long sleeves, which I love! Warm and comfy."
5.0,"Jacket is very nice but the color was darker than the picture, (which it says has something to do with the waxing) and I was getting it based on the color.  The first one I ordered was to large because some reviews said it ran small.  So due to the color and size I was going to return and look somewhere else but the customer service was so outstanding I reordered in the right size and it came faster than the first one did. It's a very nice jacket. Happy with purchase"
5.0,These little things were so easy to use. My 13 yr old used them for pins on her backpack.
5.0,"These fit exactly as pictured. Perfect for medium/tall girls. I'm 5'8"" and these are a perfect length. The material is more light weight than I expected but they fall well. I purchased to fit over a cast and they do. I didn't imagine wearing them outside of the house but the material makes them look less""jammy pants"" and when I'm out and about again I will wear them. Cute and comfy!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:26edd8caa58f35d8955777e90481387c]]
5.0,I love the way they look and feel
5.0,"Very attractive. Seems well made. Inside has two open pockets on one side and a zippered pocket on the other. Although this one's top zipper goes the whole length of the bag, my previous purse was a more flexible material and I could open it wider to see inside and get my hand inside better. This one is more firm and stands upright very well on its own."
5.0,Great for me and my 2 sons. Keeps our faces from sweating and breaking out from the material on our faces. Easier to breathe. Also my 14 year old started boot camp this week in the extreme heat and it helps him to breathe easier through the exercises outside.
5.0,Very sexy on. Requires some tuggies for sure. Give me a big smile.
5.0,Ordered 3 tops and this is by far my favorite. Adorable on! Got the black floral and couldn’t be happier.
5.0,"Perfect fit, look, quality. Great for every day use including jogging or sports.<br />So comfortable I forget I am wearing them!"
5.0,very sexy - joy to wear
5.0,"I took a risk and ordered these even though they had no reviews, and I’m so happy I did. They are a perfect fit for my very small 10 year old daughter. They are well made and easy to breath through, and we love the neutral colors. We haven’t had any problem with ear loops breaking. If you are a small adult looking for a kid sized mask (like me), these might not work for you, as they are definitely sized for a smaller child."
5.0,It’s comfortable and durable. Worth every penny
5.0,Well made and good fit for low price
5.0,"I liked the bangles so much, I ordered 2 more with some earrings to match.  They are easy to get on and don't feel heavy on the wrist.  Of course the sparkle is great."
5.0,This is a very well made rain jacket. Feels good on and comfortable. Love it!
5.0,I purchased this for a wedding I was going to.. It fitted perfect & I loved the Dark Green Color I went for. I order a XL which was perfect Im short but thick so I was tryna make sure my gut was covered & it was..
5.0,"As a full figured woman with fuller thighs, I have a problem finding pants that fit my thighs, without being way too big in the waist.<br />After purchasing this belt, I no longer have the gapping display of my my underwear or the really tight belt, too hold my pants up. This is my go too belt for jeans and casual pants."
5.0,"Excellent, good looking hat."
5.0,Will buy again in the future. Good quality material and comfortable. This product Makes you feel sexy.<br />Well worth the money spent
5.0,"Great, I love it."
5.0,best pair of gloves I ever had
5.0,"Def. cute and small, exactly what is needed to fit in the back pocket of a girls jeans. &lt;3"
5.0,Should have bought 2 as my daughter stole it from my husband as soon as it entered the house.
5.0,Great seller. 5 stars
5.0,This item was ordered by my son he enjoys playing with it so it's nice
5.0,I love these dresses I bought 5 of different patterns and love wearing them. They are super comfortable and look amazing. I would absolutely recommend these dresses to anyone you can wear them for literally any occasion.
5.0,These glasses were comfortable right from the bag.  I bought some others that didn't sit right on the nose.  These worked just fine.  I would recommend them.<br />I left a four for durability because I just bought them.  I don't know how they will hold up but they seem pretty well made.
5.0,Loved loved
5.0,"This is my second Joe's hoodie.  I really like the fit, the fabric, and the colors.  It seems odd that it is not all that easy to find a simple, quality hoodie.  These are, and the hoodie arrived as promised, well-packaged.  I will buy from Joe's again."
5.0,Easy to use and not messy. The baseball team appreciated this gift
5.0,I needed a lasts  minute gift for an anniversary. This gift came sooner than expected. Only thing is you might want to buy a better gift box the one it comes with is OK but ehhh. Over all great quality . Must buy!!!
5.0,Fit my infant perfectly. She's 28 inches long and 21 lbs. 6 months old.
5.0,Great quality!!! True to size.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, absolutely love it. Good thick material, not at all cheap or too thin. Its dressy enough to wear to work, but also casual enough to wear any time. Vibrant colors ( I got the Navy with the orange and teal design). Great fit. I only wish is was about 1 or 2 inches longer (I am 5'6&#34;) but it comes right to my feet, so it works. It does not look like I'm waiting for a flood. I am large in the bust (36DDD) and it fit just fine, snug but not tight -- I don't like tops to be too lose either. I highly reccommend this dress."
5.0,"This was a gift for my wife, who is very hard to please, and she just loved it, mostly because of all the pockets and compartments it has (I counted eleven in total). It is light, smart looking and practical. Has an outside zippered pocket good for the cell phone, and an open one on the opposite side, good for a water bottle and lots of other pockets/compartments inside and a great price to boot!  I would recommend this handbag to any woman who likes to keep a lot of stuff in their pocketbook (tell me of one who does not)."
5.0,Flattering fit! Very comfortable.
5.0,About these for a friends baby and she absolutely loves  Them. I think they're good quality and cute as heck and can't wait to see them on his little feet.
5.0,"Good support, flexible upper and waterproof!"
5.0,I really like the quality of the blue cardigan I ordered. The buttons all seem to be evenly spaced. I ordered a size up so I can wear it either buttoned or unbuttoned. The material is thicker than other similar styles I've ordered (and returned) on amazon. It also seems to wash well.
5.0,Love this dress colors are vivid fabric is super comfortable
5.0,Fully adjustable
5.0,When you receive this package you know you are about to open something very special and it is.  It is nicely packaged and looks like you paid a lot more than what you did.<br />This would make a lovely gift for someone too.<br />Highly recommended.

5.0,"Very smart design, my boyfriend loves it and uses it for all his gadgets and cords on a daily basis. Will be ordering more."
5.0,"This is a great bag. It's super big and spacey which allows me as a student to carry a lot of things with me. I'm able to carry my computer, a large textbook, make up bag all in the purse. The straps are able to hold and are durable. This is my second bag because I love these bags so much. Plus the bag comes with a clutch which is a nice extra feature."
5.0,I received these as a gift. I really like them. They are a fun pair
5.0,I'm always looking for shirts that no one else has and this is it. I love the fabric and it's fit. People are alway asking where I got it and always say they have to dress up around me because of my shirts like this one. A great buy.
5.0,"I gave bad memories of uncomfortable, ill fitting tights from my childhood. The crotch always seems to find a point between its optimal location and my knees.<br /><br />Well, scratch that, baby, because it’s a new age. What struck me first about these was the softness and stretchability of the fabric. I was amazed! They went on easily, didn’t pull in odd places, and stayed put. Hallelujah, no saggy crotch! The fabric isn’t think and opaque, but isn’t even close to a pair of black nylons. I think it gives just the right amount of coverage and warmth.<br /><br />They are super comfortable and I could wear them all day. I’m absolutely delighted I decided to overlook my bad past experiences, because these are going to look adorable with my favorite boots! Recommended!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I have done my best to give you a detailed and honest opinion. If you found my review helpful, please click the Helpful button below."
5.0,"This was quite a soft material to wear, very light also which makes it easy for summer wear!"
5.0,"I LOVE THESE PANTS. They are by far the comfiest pants that I own. Way better than leggings or yoga pants. They’re definitely a little more casual than I thought they would be, but I don’t even care! The materials is so smooth and stretchy, the pockets are big enough to hold my phone, and the waistband isn’t too tight. Will be buying more for sure!!"
5.0,"Sweater is nice but the packaging is AWFUL!! It came in an airtight, vacuumed sealed bag so it is EXTREMELY wrinkled. Second time this week this happened with an article of clothing from Amazon. It’s so aggravating!"
5.0,The Wife loved it fit well
5.0,"High quality, right price"
5.0,i absolutely LOVE this watch!  it was even better than i expected!  SO artsy!<br />and the price can't be beat.
5.0,"Came in a nice velvet style jewelry box. The photo doesn't do it justice, as there are more tones in the stone, and it looks better than I expected. (See attached photo). It's a good size, neither too big nor too small. The bead chain is nice too. My wife is very happy with it."
5.0,Nice dress and comfortable
5.0,"Bought for my Aunt, she loved it."
5.0,"Already received many compliments an I'm about 6 ft an it fits perfectly , very pleased with the purchase An the way it looks ."
5.0,"Fit , me, I'm  250 pounds 6 ft tall  I am very happy with the fit."
5.0,"Greatly surpassed my cautious hopes! I knew this would be a gamble since it had no reviews, but this is truly a very nice piece. It's sturdy, and both feels & looks high quality even upon close inspection. It's perhaps a little on the small side, but as someone with small wrists, it fits like a charm. Very lightweight and easy to wear too. As a bonus it arrived 2.5 weeks early! Could not recommend this piece more highly."
5.0,These earrings are beautiful
5.0,Husband loved Them said were very  comfortable  and well made.

5.0,Cute bib..soft!
5.0,Looks great for price!
5.0,"I have never had satin boxers before. These are well made, look nice, and feel luxurious.  Why in the world dis I wait so long.<br />Goodbye WalMart, good bye, Target and Sears.  I like these satin boxers.<br />JAC<br /><br />I have been using these satin boxers for three weeks.  I love them more and more.  I have started looking forward to pulling on my boxers for the luxurious, silky feeling they give me against my skin.  That may seem weird but, I am a convert.  Satin boxers are for me.<br />JAC"
5.0,"Comes lightly above knee, is poofy, wore it for Halloween it was what I needed"
5.0,It's slightly too big and I really expected it to be too small but it works for all types of weather and looks really good with leggings.
5.0,"Nice, only wore them once"
5.0,"The nightgown is beautiful.  The color is just what I wanted and the fit if perfect.  It was a little pricey, well worth it.  This is my first 1 for U gown, but it won't be my last one."
5.0,Very long as I hoped. Can be worn as a dress or leggings. I have different styles of types I want to wear with this. It's pretty fit is good.
5.0,The chains look gorgeous - they shimmer and sparkle like the expensive jewellery. The chains look very feminine but are strong enough to hold a good sized pendant.
5.0,Beautiful keychain and the colors are bright and sparkly.  It was bigger than I expected but it is not bothersome.  I would buy another one if anything happened to my keychain!
5.0,"I lost my hair during chemo. This turban was far superior to any I have found in these past 6 months. Well constructed, comfortable, attractive, durable! 5 Stars!"

5.0,"I have wore this T-shirts for months, and I keep being happy for having buy this product.<br />I have half of a dozen because since the begining I thought it was a very good product.<br />This is a great product for exercising. I sweat a lot, and this T-shirts dry very fast. The fabric is great! Very soft, It never lose its shape, but also it's delicate in the face of sharp things.<br />If you take care of your T-shirt, and you will have a very durable product.<br />Don't need use the dryer machine. You don't need it.<br />Recommendation. Maybe for me, the T-shirts are a little big. I had to order 2 sizes smaller than usual T-shirts for me.<br />If you prefer that T-shirts fits on you tighter as the photos, you need order 2 sizes less.<br /><br />I am going to order a couple more one of these days."
5.0,Very cute! Not as tall as I thought.  Very cute!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:74deb1fb518b711899a0bfe694237eb]] Looks perfect dyed it and it looked even better for what I was trying to do

I will definitely make this my go to if it becomes available again. Dried very quickly and left a high shine.<br /><br />Update: although this doesnt keep my mani as long as super chic or holo taco it works if you are the kind of girl that likes to change her polish every 2 days like me. Plus its affordable and is the fastest drying polish I've ever had"
5.0,"My 5 yr old looks so pretty in this! I actually wish it didn't have Anna on it so she could just wear it as a princess dress. The sparkles seem to stay put for the most part, but I have found a few of the sparkles on the ground."
5.0,I really like how they fit me correctly.
5.0,Great! Love these
5.0,I like this because it can be both very summery and a good fall tunic if accessorized correctly. It's one of those fabrics that isn't too sheer but isn't too thick. Not to mention that the print is absolutely stunning!
5.0,"Was impressed with how warm the socks are, and how well-constructed they are. I’m really picky about socks, and don’t mind spending extra to get a good winter sock. I would definitely order these again."
5.0,Nice fit and stretch.
5.0,Very happy with these fits pretty good. Comfortable
5.0,I love this bracelet.  This is just what I was looking for. And it looks great layered with other bracelets that I have on.<br />It was shipped quickly and I received it fast.<br />Thanks.
5.0,One of my fav bags
5.0,"Very happy with this piece of jewelry. Inexpensive, attractive, hip."
5.0,Very few sources for this kind of nostalgic wear. Unique and very satisfying to find a source of manufacture.
5.0,Very good gift for couples. The quality high as always.
5.0,I really like this blouse. It's forgiving (conceals lumps and bumps). Would buy again in other colors.
5.0,Love my dress. Lightweight but not see through. Good quality fabric.
5.0,Cute and cozy!  I'll wear these around the house all winter!
5.0,Arrived on time in a nice upscale box. Looks like of good quality. People will think I spent more then I did!!

5.0,"GREAT TIE, THANKS!!"
5.0,Just as advertised.  Great quality and very reasonably priced.
5.0,Pretty rugged backpack.
5.0,"This shirt is so cute and true to size. I am almost 6 months pregnant so it works as a maternity shirt, but will also be cute after I have the baby. Great material for just a $10 purchase."
5.0,"My kids have skinny feet, and the regular crocs look like boats on their feet!  So we tried these because of the reviews of them feeling snugger, and they work!  My son has the two-one blue ones and likes them.  I love that they are easy to clean with a hose, and light enough to put in his backpack on days that he has to wear boots to school and changes into these when he arrives.  I got them on sale for $25 and they should last him all year, another big plus."
5.0,Fits well. Fabric is soft and thick enough it's not see through.  Zipper works well.<br />Worked well while playing on aerial silks
5.0,"So many choose from to make bracelets charm bracelets charm necklaces, earrings"
5.0,"This is an absolutely adorable gift set for children learning to cook, and looking fashionable at the same time to snap some photos of their first time cooking. The iPhone portrait mode is amazing to blur the surroundings and focus on them! The only fault I can tell is the material is fairly thin so if there was a splash back or something, it could go through and possibly hurt them, so just make sure your young chefs have a shirt or sweater underneath :) Have fun with your new little helpers!"
5.0,"Very nice piece of jewelry, love that I change the look with different snaps!"
5.0,I have one to the front desk receptionist at my sons school and one to my sons social studies teacher. The front desk receptionist wrote the kindest thank you saying it was by far the sweetest gift she has ever received! I still consider her a teacher as they teach valuable lessons to my children over the 4 years they spend in the school
5.0,Love them! I can't wear most earrings because I have sensitive ears but these I can wear for days straight with no issues!
5.0,"Take a look at the fastener clasp on this cap. That's not a cheap Velcro fastener like you get on most caps, this fastener shows PXG put some thought in the quality. The cap fits great, it's lightweight, and I have a head the size of a basketball and it's hard to find quality caps to fit my melon! Great stylish PXG product and I look forward to wearing it during my weekly shootouts at the club."
5.0,love my  neckless and going to use it for the holidays
5.0,Good masks for 5 yr old
5.0,"Warm, soft, comfy as all get-out.  Love this new robe of mine!"
5.0,"I think that this product is an asset to any outdoor activity. The arm sleeves are lightweight and have UV protection.  My husband uses them when he plays golf outside. My daughter uses them when she's walking on campus. I use them when I go out jogging.  They are lightweight and attractive. The UV protection alone is an excellent selling point.  I would highly recommend these sleeves to anyone that wishes to protect themselves from harmful UV rays from the sun while they were outside.  The sleeves allow you to enjoy being outside without the fear of sunburnt arms.  Great product, great material."
5.0,Loved this jewelry set! Looked way more expensive then it was! Worth the price!
5.0,This is a really attractive piece of artwork as well as a watch.  I wear it with a black turtleneck sweater and always get compliments on it.
5.0,Will order more from this brand in the future. Worth the cost for growing kids!
5.0,Well made; pretty; comfortable; a joy to wear.
5.0,Bought a extra large and it fit like an extra large it was perfect perfect size for a 14/16
5.0,"This is a nice basic chain. I needed one for a old charm i had, and this did the trick. Its lite weight, and feel durable. Good purchase."
5.0,I wasn’t impressed when I first pulled it out of the package BUT then I tried it on!! It’s nice long and stretchy!! I’m 5’10” and 165 lbs and a large fit perfect! I probably could have gotten a medium but I wanted a looser fit. The sleeves were a good length too. It’s hard for tall women to find clothes that actually fit! This is a good one!!!
5.0,"Perfect addition to my skull ring, knuckle duster collection. Beautiful design as advertised. Packaging was on point and delivery was next day. Good job!"
5.0,loveeee this suit the straps on the top were a little long so I had a tailor remove the rings on the back and make it into a halter and now its PERFECT!
5.0,"Great product, well made, and it came really quickly!  Extremely pleased with these products!  Considering ordering different buckle styles!"
5.0,Really adorable and comfy!
5.0,Love it..but somehow big..but still love it..
5.0,Love it! Great quality and look for the price !
5.0,"Wore these for my sunflower themed wedding. I love them, and will continue wearing them."
5.0,Love these but too small
5.0,Made it easy for the nurse to dress my wife and put on her sling.

5.0,Very Durable And Great Gold Color
5.0,Great for handling my Iguanas
5.0,Gave it as a gift. It was great!
5.0,This hoodie is the cutest I've seen yet.  It seems well made and durable with thick fluffy texture.  My daughter loves it and it keeps her head and hands warm on her walks to and from school.
5.0,When I was in my twenties Gloria Vanderbilt shorts & jeans were always too roomy in the waist area.  Now that I am older these first Perfectly and are well-made of quality fabric.
5.0,"nice material, it’s not too flimsy and perfect size. i originally got this as a concert bag before the pandemic hopefully i’ll get to use it at another concert sooner or later"
5.0,They are SO cute! Horrible packaging though they were just in an envelope.
5.0,"The stank of soft lether is lovely. The strap, even more so. Would absolutely recommend,<br /><br />tho would like a few more inchs to really let it hang."
5.0,Perfect size for my charm bracelet.
5.0,This is a very cute dress has side pockets which is awesome and the belt separate. I normally wear a size 18 but got the 3X and it fits perfect. I am very large busted 4042 double D 18 but got the 3X and it fits perfect. I am very large busted 42DD.. the top does fit.  Material has a decent stretch.  The skirt is full and flowing.  Great quality fabric.
5.0,"I love pearls.worth the price, nice to gift someone."
5.0,Very nice leather band.  Bold colors.  Easy to attach.  I have a Versa II Special Edition.
5.0,Great for travel. Large enough to be used as a blanket or pillow. I also used this as a shawl and head covering during inclement weather. And of course it is a great scarf!
5.0,Very sexy I'm completely happy
5.0,"Got this for my 14 year old for homecoming. She is about 5’0 and usually wears a juniors 5/7 (or Jrs Medium). She fits a women’s small.<br /><br />The dress has good stretch to it though, and could fit someone larger. I’d be more conscious of the length for taller people rather than width for heavier people. Otherwise, it’s cute/fun. Material is nice. We bought the bow/belt separately."
5.0,I Like a lot
5.0,Great pair of spats
5.0,This shirt worked great for my 2.5 year old at her sister’s rainbow mermaid party!
5.0,Comfortable for the most part!! I love them! I want black next!!
5.0,"I love these plugs and wear them nearly every day.  I was never sure if they were acrylic or true amythest until the other day when I accidentally dropped them on my tile floor when cleaning them and sadly part of the plugs chipped off. I'm upset that my plugs were damaged due to my own mistake, however at the same time this made me very happy because it clarified to me that they are indeed made of genuine amythest! Placing an order for a new pair as soon as I'm done writing this review! :)"
5.0,"My 7 yr old granddaughter and I always say, I Love You.&#34;  However, I always tell her that I love her more.  I was so excited when I found this necklace.  The price is great because I did not want to buy anything too expensive since she is only 7.  This will be a Christmas gift and I cannot wait to see her expression.  I just know she will love it."
5.0,I love love love this shirt wish I got it in more colors and a size down! I want to order one in every color! So comfortable! I got a lot of compliments on this! Thanks
5.0,I love these! The nose pads make these my new favorite VonZippers
5.0,Love these this is my third pair. Much easier to get them from Amazon than search all over town for a store that has them.
5.0,I really love these shoes. They’re comfortable and fit well. I don’t know why some people say the running smaller. My shoe size is 8 and I got 8 and they fit just fine.
5.0,This are the most comfortable workout shorts I have ever owned. They are so flattering also. I am 5'6 135 pounds and have no curves. These shorts give my body some curves. I have no idea how. I ordered a medium and I feel they fit perfectly
5.0,Beautiful and well made! Wear them daily!
5.0,"Arrived on time, is the perfect size as expected, way better value than a regular jewelry store! Never shopping anywhere else for rings ever again!"
5.0,Great product well worth the value I would purchase from them again!
5.0,Great product! Thank you!
5.0,"The lady of the house loved these socks. She found them to be quite comfortable, and said they are thin enough to wear with any shoe, even slip ons, and she liked the color assortment of this pack. They also appear to be fairly durable in that they didn’t snag, run or get holes like nylons or tights often do. The socks fit well below the ankle and didn’t slip.<br />Please note these socks were provided at no cost for the purpose of evaluation and an honest review."
5.0,Good quality and fits well.
5.0,Love the style! And everyone loves them too :) quality is a little cheap but they are light and feel comfortable.
5.0,Nil
5.0,Hermoso y de buena calidad
5.0,"Ring looks exactly as pictured. You’re getting an awesome fashion piece for &#60;$10 so in my opinion, it’s a great buy!"
5.0,"i love anything wolf,since i own a wolf hybrid.i got this not to use as a necklace but to attach to front of my new hat to show that i love wolves.i think they are the misunderstood animal there is,they are very shy."
5.0,Nice quality and can be dressed up or worn casually.  The fabric reminds me a little of the fabric that my daughter's Latin ballroom competition dresses were made out of...a little stretchy with a little sheen to it.  Quite a few compliments when I dressed it up and wore it to a luncheon.  I bought this in blue and burgundy.
5.0,"Warm hat, it is also unique compared to other ones. The ear flaps fold up the same, but they still cover your ears. Great product."
5.0,Fit great and look good. I bought medium.
5.0,Kids loved them and they were big enough for my big adult sized head!
5.0,"I love this skirt! I did not want an a-line skirt but I also wanted to be able to walk. This skirt is stretchy but does not look like a jegging.  It is not a pull on though, it does have a button and zipper but I like that better anyway."
5.0,"I tried this body pillow as well as another inflatable option and this one was far superior.<br /><br />Pros- soft feeling on both sides (the other one had a soft side on the top and the bottom felt plastic-y.) I did not use a pillow case with it during a trip and it felt fine but I think for summer camping, I may make a thin pilllow<br />case for it. I am 5 6"" and a side sleeper and it was able to support my feet, knees, and arm.<br /><br />pretty quiet- the other one was very loud (like crumpling a trash bag) but this one didn't make too much noise<br /><br />Cons- a bit tricky to fill up with the nozzle design- but because it is so comfortable, I don't mind. I just blew it up with mouth (because I want to use it for camping and not rely on a pump or hair dryer) and it worked and kept the air all night.<br /><br />Note: For some reason in the picture, it looks like it is tapered but it actually a rectangle, which works well. This packs very small, is lightweight, and fits into its stuff sack easily. I want to use this camping and for travel (bringing a full-size travel pillow just takes too much room).  I am very happy with this inflatable body pillow!!"
5.0,Beautiful color and fit. I purchased the large and it fits well in all areas. 36-30-38...5'4&#34;...150 lbs<br /><br />Nice fabric and lining.
5.0,cousin daugther say she loves it
5.0,Good item and prize

5.0,Just buy these already
5.0,SO SEXY!!
5.0,wear it every day
5.0,"I bought a tartan on the Royal Mile last year, and I needed an appropriate brooch to hold it in place. This is perfect."
5.0,"The necklace is beautiful simply beautiful.  It is well made, has a good weight, the coral is gorgeous, I'm very glad to have purchased it and at the fantastic price!"
5.0,"Just a tad too heavy, had to change the earring backing to a wider one to prevent ear folding."
5.0,"Wore this dress for a wedding, and it was very comfortable!"
5.0,These boots are easy to slip on and off. The leather is thick and durable. I have no regrets about my purchase.
5.0,Warm and adorable!  Fit my 5 year old petite girl very well!

5.0,Nice gift for kids. No problems with package.
5.0,love it very nice
5.0,I am in love with these socks. I am amazed that I can wear these uniquely-shaped shoes with the comfort of socks that also protect my shoes. They fit well and stay in place all day.
5.0,"I had to track down this bag because it is honestly the best one that I have ever gotten! My brother gave it to me for Christmas TWO years ago and it has held up better than any other bag I've owned. I'm a college student, full time employee and a hoarder. This bag has held three books, my small laptop, my thermos, travel-sized wallet, millions of snacks, keys and receipts all with sturdiness and stability. Even after I've given this bag regular grief with my giant loads of STUFF, it has held up with only a little bit of wear to the stitching of the handles. I am completely shocked and impressed! I'm buying two more in different colours!"
5.0,The material is sooo soft and the print is vivid! Color didn't run when washed and the shirt didn't shrink either. It's made of high quality material and I love it!
5.0,These two sweatshirts fit perfect.  ordered 2 mediums I weigh about 160 5 9 and after washing it fit perfect
5.0,"Unlike the others I looked at before purchasing these, they have minimal pattern, are very comfortable, just the right length and a tad bit thinner in width.  GREAT buy!"
5.0,"Love these fun hoop earrings!  I have always worn hoops, so every once in a while I have to get new sets [because I lose 1 of a pair that I already  have].  These are bright and shiny, and are a bit large.  I like the bigger ones because in Winter I wear lots of wool hats, and the only way earrings can be seen is to go big, ha!  Big hoops are great if you have long hair [I don't] too."
5.0,I thought these were a great deal for my customers
5.0,My son loves the silky material.
5.0,Cute cute cute. Dress is up or down simply love it.

5.0,Very colorful just like the picture but better
5.0,"Good quality, detailed costume. Sizing was accurate. Costume worn several times, to several events- held up very well. Washed in garment bag using cold water then hung dry. All mess came out beautifully. It’s now in out Halloween storage, ready for the next time the Sanderson sisters break out!"
5.0,great nose rings perfect size
5.0,It’s a cute little charm perfect for my little graddaughter.
5.0,"This is a very nice mid-weight turtleneck sweater! One note: while the title calls it a turtleneck, at one point in the description it's called a ""mock turtle"" - it is not mock, which I'd prefer, but a full-length turtleneck collar which you can wear long (if you're long-necked, bud), let bunch up, or fold down a turn to the standard mock turtle look. It's also really more of a hybrid shirt/sweater, given the weight and fit.<br /><br />I got the white, and it's a gorgeous, sharp bright white knit of a weight that will be perfect for our cool but not cold winters. At temps in the 50s or so, it is probably enough that you can leave the jacket behind. As another reviewer mentioned, it runs a bit small - forewarned, I ordered an XL instead of my usual L, and it fit fine, so apparently yhe other reviewer's experience was not an anomaly.<br /><br />You'll probably love this medium-weight shirt/sweater, but order up a size!"
5.0,"I bought these for my husband and they fit him very well- they fit tight enough to not bounce around while being active,  but they aren't too tight. They look pretty sleek on him too"
5.0,Very comfortable love it!
5.0,Loved the quality and make of this dress.
5.0,"Very comfortable fit, true to size. I like the way it feels and look."
5.0,Love love love love. Ordered this for my Mom in a medium . 5'3 185 and it was a great fit. She probably got have worn a small but she liked the oversized comfort of the medium.
5.0,Not too heavy. Good quality.
5.0,Adore these boots.  Can't go wrong with Sorels even when they are more of a fashion boot than snow boot.
5.0,Love this watch! Beautiful piece
5.0,"This tank top was for a costume for this past Halloween. but I was very surprised when I tried this item on. The coloring is exactly as shown, and it fit perfectly. I typically wear medium shirts and this tank top in a medium fit perfect. I was expecting it to fit a little more on the snug side but this was perfectly comfortable without looking frumpy. Very excellent piece and wouldn't mind ordering in other colors!"
5.0,"I'm a writer and a I work at a library and this little ring gets my compliments every time I wear it! I've had it for quite a bit and see no signs of tarnish!<br /><br />It's got a nice weight to it, is adjustable, and the heart gem is well secured. Perfect for yourself, or as a gift to any teacher, librarian, writer, and/or book lover!"
5.0,I love these glasses. I've had them for about a year and the lenses never scratch! They're dark but not too dark. They're nice and big but not comically big.
5.0,I'm an 18-20 and bought 3X. It fits me like it fits the model.
5.0,Súper cómodos buena calidad además gran cantidad de bolsas
5.0,My little girl loves them
5.0,Prefect fit & have ordered multiple times. Slowly replacing all the old underwear drawer with these!
5.0,"This came right on time, it covered my sneakers & I was able to work comfortably without a drop of soil or anything else for that matter on my new sneakers"
5.0,Cool looking and effective.
5.0,Nice and comfortable. Does not ride down on my leg.
5.0,"Reasonable price, large enough to hold onto, and it works. Buy it and you can't go wrong.<br />Remember, these are to brighten previously polished metal, and not intended for turning a black tarnished silver object into bright gleaming silver. If you keep them polished once a year, or want to touch up &#34;intermittent&#34; use items, this is perfect."
5.0,"We have owned two of these in different sizes. They hold up well and still look new after repeated washings. Fairly opaque material. Best of all, the fit is perfect. I tried a cheaper one and the leg openings were very revealing and not flattering, so I went back to this one! The pink color is gorgeous, a classic ""ballet pink."""
5.0,"This sweater is the perfect fun peice to wear anytime during the holidays, Holiday photos, office party, ice skating, whatever!<br />Tucked in, front tuck, or out.<br />Super cute!"
5.0,My daughter loves them.  Perfect fit!
5.0,Cheap. Fit well.
5.0,"This shirt was beautiful. The sleeves were too tight for me (ordered a L, usually wear a L) so I had to return it BUT if my arms were smaller it would be my new favorite top. Good quality, and the embroidery is gorgeous."
5.0,"I bought these to go with a flapper costume for Halloween.  There weren't any reviews, but they were the least expensive; so I took the gamble and I'm glad I did.  They arrived fairly quickly, fit nicely, and appear to be decent quality.  They will be perfect for Halloween.  If I have major problems with them after I actually wear them, I might update this review, but to be honest, for this price, I still wouldn't be able to complain."
5.0,"Saw previous reviews that complained about install issues. It was super easy, love it and use on a daily basis."
5.0,Cute and comfortable. The material is not satin but nice and light. True to size
5.0,I ordered a small and I'm 5'4 130lbs. The little booty shorts are super cute and comfy. For the price this is a nice set and the fabric is sturdy and stretchy.
5.0,"Wow, I’m really impressed with these sunglasses. I just came upon this brand when I was searching Amazon for affordable and great quality sunglasses. These fit the bill and then some. They look amazing really fit my face shape well. The tint of the lenses is cool which is what I wanted and they are will made also. They really do keep out the sun rays, even in direct sunlight. On a side note, I was very impressed with the packaging custom box with the brand name on it and lenses were covered in protective layer to prevent scratching in shipping. In addition, the sunglasses came with a zipper glasses case and cleaning cloth.<br />Very pleased with the buying experience and would not hesitate to buy again."
5.0,Very nice exactly what we expected you will need to pin it up the silk scrap will slide in flat area in back
5.0,"These boxer briefs are incredible! One of a kind! No, they don't have a slit, but who cares? ( some might, I don't ). They fit perfectly but don't feel excessively tight! And unlike some other boxer briefs are have tried (even ones that are more popular brands ) they don't ride up on the legs! Extremely comfortable, and the tiger design is very cool looking.<br /><br />The amount you get for the price is very good too! I will be ordering more soon as long as they stay available! :)"
5.0,"good quality!<br />It's cute, too.<br />I love the way of the earmuffs folded in the head part."
5.0,Beautifully 2 sided and clean with no mold flanges. Perfect!
5.0,These are a lot nicer than I expected for the price. Some of the other cheap bundles of ties I've gotten from Amazon have been very lightweight and poor quality. These have a good weight to the and look well made.
5.0,beautiful!!  picture doesn't do this justice
5.0,Great shirt! Arrived 2 weeks before the expected date. I always get compliments about how cut it is and the fabric is very soft and has survived months of washing.
5.0,Great looking and sleek. Good size especially for large hands. If it lasts a while and the battery is easy to replace it will be perfect.
5.0,Great Fit!

5.0,My wife looks stunning in it.
5.0,This is much more amazing than I expected. It looks so fabulous with everything that it's hard to resist wearing it everyday! I did purchase a shorter sterling chain to wear it on that I think makes it look even better! This piece makes me happy :) I have received many compliments when I wear it.
5.0,I love these ear rings.  Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"Great Cheap and Stylish, not exactly a gold like the description says, definitely more of an orange tint without a doubt, however, still great and affordable"
5.0,Flattering and comfortable!
5.0,Im in college and i wore this for halloween and it fit well. straps kinda small but not uncomfortable just a snug fit. loved them

5.0,Beautiful necklace. Larger than I was expecting but very pretty on.
5.0,Great gift or keep for yourself
5.0,Did their job my wife loved them
5.0,"I purchased several pairs of sun glasses to go over my prescription glasses.  They all work great and look good, especially the ones with rhinestones since I'm a &#34;glitzy kind of girl&#34;."
5.0,Great rings. Going to use them in my TV show.
5.0,"Bottoms fit good with sufficient coverage. Be aware the dots are gold, not white. Suit just wasn't eye catching"
5.0,The toe coverings are just what I needed.  They stay in place and are very comfortable.
5.0,"I just re-ordered this hat (in several colors) because it is great! I zip off the hat part and then clip my hair up and over it. It is light, washable, and doesn't fall. The brim is a perfect size, too."
5.0,Lindo peto grandes
5.0,I’ve been looking forever for glasses like these. Great quality and the perfect size.
5.0,Love the sunglasses and the price I paid for them. One of the sunglasses was a birthday gift and was a complete success. I am so happy that I decided to purchase Amazon Prime. Thanks again!
5.0,A little too long for me and I'm 5'5.
5.0,My son love this hat.

5.0,I love this dress. It fits just right and the material is so soft and silky smooth. Can’t wait to order more 😁
5.0,I should have ordered more they had different colors I love it fits great just the way I like.
5.0,I'm so glad I got this wallet case for my BlackBerry; it's very functional and I never leave home without it!
5.0,Very shiny and sparkly and goes on good
5.0,its work well!
5.0,"Very beautiful, bought different chains but that was just a personal preference."
5.0,super fashionable!
5.0,Beautiful great quality
5.0,"This came in a reasonable amount of time and I get complimented on it all the time! It's so gorgeous and I'd definitely buy it again. It fits well, I get a little sore there sometimes but it might be because I had a real cartilage piercing there that got infected so I had to let it close up. Either way I love it!"
5.0,Love the bracelet.
5.0,"Looks great. Not the finest pearl or most delicate setting, but my wife (and I) are very happy with the product and the value."
5.0,"Looks good,  fits well.  Will work great for a Halloween costume or cosplay. My only small, microscopic issue I had was a pin on the eyepatch kept falling off.  Easily fixed though.  I recommend this mask to any fans of Tokyo Ghoul."
5.0,I love hayabusa products and this gi doesn't disappoint. Lightweight and very flexible. I did karate and jujitsu. So I wear the pants for karate and then put on the top for jujitsu. Beautifully crafted.
5.0,Slightly sheerer than I thought. Ran a little small.
5.0,"These earrings are very pretty-nice size. They did a great job on matching the color, they are white.  delicate looking but sturdy. These are larger -I would guess they are 10MM.  The price was great. The delivery was on time and I asked they be shipped USPS and they responded to my e-mail and did ship as I requested. I would definitely purchase from them again and I would give them 10 stars if I could. I received a card with my earrings that stated-they hope I'm happy with my purchase and if there are any issues, to please contact them. What a company!"
5.0,This is a nice pair of glasses. Definitely will buy another.
5.0,I originally purchased these socks in all black in two sizes in packs of three. Both felt great but had to turn down the top of large socks because they came over knee. Very comfortable and good tapered compression. I’ve been wearing these type of socks for varicose veins for years. These socks are the best I’ve ever used. I decided to order additional socks that are available in different colors and patterns. These were packaged as single pairs. I ordered eight pair of different colors and patterns in the smaller size. Couldn’t have been more pleased. The packaging was very up scale and reminded me of packaging by apple. It set the tone for what was inside… a very high quality sock. All socks even the all black that I ordered originally in three pack have withstood many machine washings on cold cycle. I hang them up for quick dry. I also like the logo at the top and colored heels and toes. This feature allow me to align socks on sock donner for quick and accurate alignment. I really like adding color back into my wardrobe. I think over the years there haven’t been many choice for those of us that are limited  to compression socks. Thanks for providing a great product! I tried another brand that had interesting colors but inside of sock was not finished well and was lacking improper support. This is a combined report for three multiple purchases over last three or four months. Thanks for delivering a quality product that looks and feels good and gives support.
5.0,My daughter loves it. Wears it everyday every where.
5.0,Bought it for my brother he loves it

5.0,I love this bathing suit. It fits well and hasn't faded from use or washing.
5.0,Compliments all day! Comfortable! Great length would buy one in all 3 colors!
5.0,Fits my Casio calculator watch perfect. The original band eventually developed a crack in it (as they all do) and I needed to replace it. Removing and replacing the band was super easy. Just keep in mind this band doesn’t come with the sprint bars. So make sure you keep the original ones from the old band.
5.0,"I wore these comfy socks with my nude colored, ankle boots and they look and feel great!"
5.0,"Bought for my son, he loves this shirt!"
5.0,"I just received my boots and I love them!<br />Fits as expected, super comfortable and cute. Best buy ever!"

5.0,This is much more comfortable and durable than paper masks that must eventually be thrown out.
5.0,Beautiful elegant and my size love it wear it for a wedding
5.0,"I'ts soft leather and the embossed front is a classic design.  It is large and holds a lot, the top zipper made it secure. worth the money."
5.0,Invisible even under tight pants. Hooray. Can wear under leggings.  Also pretty nice looking.
5.0,"I love Overwatch, so naturally I needed these leggings. They fit great. I am heavy bottomed wear size 14 and they fit fine."
5.0,"It Is just perfect, exactly what I wanted I love the color it matched with the braclet I ordered too"
5.0,So comfortable stays in place while working out. Definitely worth the money!
5.0,My watch hasn't fallin' off yet.
5.0,"Perfect! My daughter loved it. Only bad thing, it took forever to get here"
5.0,"These were perfect for a night out in a cute dress! I’m a 34DD and although they don’t offer a lift, they covered the nips very well in my satin dress. Super comfortable and stayed in place. I forgot I even had them on and I danced all night! Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,"Lightweight, I can breathe in these much easier than a traditional mask or gaiter. I've gotten compliments on them, too!"
5.0,This was a present for a mermaid freak
5.0,This is exactly what I wanted. Great fit and just above the calf without touching the knee. Colors are stylish too. I am planning to buy another set
5.0,"i love these earrings, they can be a little difficult to put in, but once in, they are so comfortable they don't really need to be removed. Excellent for cartilage piercings"
5.0,"Overall very pleased with the jacket.  I’m a 46 Regular and it fit as expected.  Was a little tight in the biceps...but when you’re jacked like me, you come to expect that.  Just kidding...but seriously, I do have pretty thick arms and it was a little snug, but still comfortable."
5.0,They are beautiful!
5.0,"GOT THEM IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME, AND THEY LOOK GREAT!"
5.0,I love the wrist band for my fossil watch... it brought it to life!!!
5.0,"It was pretty much just like the picture.  I am happy with my purchase. I have not been satisfied with other purchases from this same company, so I was happy to see it was just what I was expecting."
5.0,I still suck at bowling.
5.0,Nice & cozy house slippers. I ordered a size up because I like my slippers just a little big.
5.0,Nice hat fits great nice look
5.0,"Although the ring box was slightly crushed, the ring arrived in perfect condition.  This ring is delicate looking and the rose gold is quite nice.  The center crystal is about the size of a half carat diamond.  The tiny crystals on the sides are large enough to sparkle in the sun or bright light.  It is well made and can easily pass for a genuine diamond in a real rose gold setting.  And, as an added value gift, I also received a pair of pretty crystal stud earrings which are also well made and sparkly.  I would recommend this seller based on the quality and style I received, as well as the added gift."
5.0,All the numbers came off after 3 weeks but it still looks good<br />People thought it was an expensive watch at work looks great<br />Simply removed the back panel to clean and it still working perfectly<br />Sadly it was stolen
5.0,"I see lots of ""Marine"", or ""Marine Veteran"" ball cap, but those don't identify you as one that gave your life to the Corps.  This ball cap is sturdy, fits well, and is very attractive."
5.0,"Great product, clear, helps with headlight glare when driving and when riding my bike at night."
5.0,"actually very impressed with this bag! i used it not only as a purse, but as a beach/pool bag. i could not fit a towel into it (i didn’t expect too) but i could fit a sweater/coverup, my mophie, chargers, a pretty decent size book and a lot of little things like pens, tampons, and other things in all the other compartments! i do have a Kanken, and they are comparable, but i do believe that the Hotstyle bag can hold a lot more and i don’t feel as bad if it gets dirty!"
5.0,My daughter has been obsessed since opening it
5.0,"comfy material, fit like a glove"
5.0,I love these dance shoes! They fit like a glove. Protect my feet. And feel wonderful to dance in! I highly recommend this product!

5.0,Great wallet...
5.0,"These are really beautiful and look real. I ordered 3 sets and they're all different. They are also all different sizes. One set had a very large clear crystal and small amethyst, medium rose quartz. Others were vice versa. The rose is very pale, almost white, on all sets, but still very pretty."

5.0,Great multipurpose pants.
5.0,These pajamas are adorable and well made. Only problem is I am 5’3” and they are a little long by about 4 inches. I like them so much I will make a hem. Great gift for the holidays! I love the color too!
5.0,"She likes the style, size, materials, and all of the pockets and zippers and places to put things. She said that she didn't need a purse to go shopping."
5.0,LOVE this dress for the office! The length and fit are great! The material is heavy but comfortable. Great quality dress.
5.0,"I like the dual straps. This keeps you cool. I was a little surprised by the slightly heavier weight of the fabric. Not in a bad way. It's got a little more weight than those flimsy , see through tops. The fabric is very soft. It looks well made. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,This dress is so cute!
5.0,"This dress is so flattering! Love the ruching, and it really hides any imperfections"
5.0,"This item was perfect! Great fit, looked nice, I absolutely love it!"
5.0,"Adorable! Love this bracelet, and for the price, worth the buy. It comes exactly as pictured. It also was delivered sooner than I expected. It is for a slightly larger wrist, so maybe not meant for a childs wrist. However, it fits good on mine and i am able to say im pretty happy with it. Love it."
5.0,"Found this dress at macys, loved the dress, not the price. OFF TO AMAZON!!! the exact same dress for 1/2 the cost. PERFECT!<br /><br />the stitching for the sequins is slightly uncomfortable in the arms until you get used to the sensation.<br /><br />very flattering for my curvier figure."
5.0,Perfect size and color for the money
5.0,"My granddaughter loved these socks!  They were cute, colorful and fit well."

5.0,Excellent quality for the price. I ended up buying a matching bow tie too. They are amazing and I love them.
5.0,"These are exactly what we were looking for. My daughters do not dance ballet. These were bought as play skirts and they are perfect. They are a little more than I would normally pay for play outfits, but my girls haven't taken them off since they arrived. I will probably be buying more."
5.0,So soft! Love the material and the fit is nice! Arrived on time!!
5.0,"These pants are really comfortable. The waist stretches a little bit while you wear them, but nothing I can't deal with. The length is amazing! I am 5'9"" with a 34-35"" inseam, these are plenty long even after washing and drying.  I would absolutely order these again."
5.0,I bought this to wear to a Bucs game.  It is a nice quality shirt and it had a good design.  Unfortunately the Bucs lost the game. :(
5.0,"Nice and warm, but a little baggy. I'm 5'11&#34; (180cm), size M and sleeves are perfect, it fits perfectly in the shoulders, but in the lower body it's loose. So if you don't have a noticeable belly and don't like loose fit, you might consider buying something else."
5.0,Like this style & weight of fabric for fall.
5.0,"really like these, very cool and confortable."
5.0,"Love the look. bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Fit as expected not too tight, nice and warm."
5.0,Love the jacket. Wore it in a hard rain storm and was warm and dry.
5.0,"I got this and kept it a secret from my daughter until a few days before Christmas.  On the last day of school before her winter break, I put it on and went out to her bus stop across the street and waited for her to come home, waiving to the cars and other elementary school busses as they passed by.  A few people honked.  Others stopped to give their kids a better look.<br /><br />I had my husband there to help me in and out of the costume and work the back zipper.  I had tried the costume on when I first got it and I was able to do it myself.  The only tricky part I found when putting it on alone was getting the zipper unzipped once it was on.<br /><br />The fan for inflating it worked well.  It was pretty quiet and it inflated relatively quickly.<br /><br />The costume is actually pretty big.  I'm 5'9"" and the legs went all the way down to my feet.  It is open at the bottom with an elastic band around your ankles.  The feet, as I said, are open at the bottom, but there  are flaps of fabric that covered my feet to look like black boots so the cartoon look was not broken.  The body has a pretty big circumference and the head had a lot of room that could accommodate somebody taller than me.<br /><br />Visibility was not great, but not bad.  My husband did have to walk me across the street because I had no peripheral vision.  I was able to see my daughter's reaction though, which was priceless.  I felt breathing was also non-restrictive while is costume.<br /><br />It was windy that day and started to snow that heavy wet snow.  The wind was a bit challenging.  The size of the costume and that it was mostly air, made it unstable in the wind.  I did stay completely dry in the snow.  Otherwise, I was able to waive and dance with no problem.<br /><br />It is definitely a fun costume to have!  I emailed some of the pictures my husband took to colleagues at work, who thought it was hilarious."
5.0,Adorable dress! Well made. We always order one size larger in all of these clothes. Then you get a good fit.
5.0,Love these headbands. I have ordered multiple colors. They stay in place and machine wash well.
5.0,"Great for work, date night, or just a day on the town. Versatile enough to be casual or dressed up with a belt and necklace. The pockets are deep enough for your phone. Very soft yet sturdy material and fits very flatteringly."
5.0,"There is something about the design of this watch that just sticks with you.  While you need to read the instructions to make sure you understand how to use it, it is simple to use.  The solar power charge is fantastic.  Its live update is great.  I live in Alabama and it picks up the signal from Colorado consistently each night.  The only drawback it has is the outer dial does not use a spring/ball to lock its position which results in outer dial rotating on its on.  It doesn't cause an issue with the watch... but if you're a little OCD, it will drive you crazy.  Other than that... great watch!<br /><br />Update: Daylight savings started today... it adjusted automatically for the time change."
5.0,The fit is perfect. They are long and they look nice. Good material too. The tags were a bit itchy but I just cut them off so no problem.
5.0,I wear these for working out and they do make a difference.
5.0,"Very nice tie received several complements, great price great tie!"
5.0,Just got it for Christmas and I love it!
5.0,"Beatiful, very good"
5.0,LOVE
5.0,Gorgeous necklace. Even better in person than in the photo. I haven't worn it yet but I can't wait!
5.0,Nothing it is Great.
5.0,"I bought these for my son (I kept the more girly colors) and he absolutely loves them. He wears a size 7/8 in the big kids shoes. I wear an 11 in women's and they stretch enough for me to wear them (they are snug, but not uncomfortable) and I didn't have any sort of indent from the socks either (which I usually do)."
5.0,I love these posts to wear in the second hole in my ears!  Just the right size to leave in all the time!
5.0,This took just over a month to get to us. We had it custom made and sent measurements in cm not inches.<br />My daughter is super happy!<br />The material is very nice and it's quality made. The shirt is a little small but she says it's comfortable and it could be our mistake with the measuring.<br />I would not hesitate to order again!
5.0,All these brackets are beautiful!  And well made. Never take them off.  Highly recommend!
5.0,I received a lot of compliments on the necklaces. The only down fall is the metal tarnished within a couple weeks.
5.0,"I ordered the size 30 waist for my 13-year-old son who is tall 5'8&#34; and a  slender 115 lbs.  With a belt they work, a little roomy, and hit him right at the mid knee."
5.0,Comfortable great material.
5.0,Very cute. Nice length
5.0,"Minor shipping error, but the package still arrived on time, even after being resent, and it will work perfectly for the small necklace I have to give.  Pay attention to the size, it is a small box.  That's what I wanted though, so it is fitting."
5.0,"These earrings are lovely! They are pretty, the color is vibrant, and they are comfortable to wear."
5.0,It's a great cd. I had one older one and bought 2 recent ones since I'll be seeing their tour in May wanted to be more familiar.  Seller A+

5.0,it fit well and colors are true.  arrived quickly
5.0,"This is a great hat for St. Patrick's Day. The holiday is the day me and my husband started dating. It's very sentimental and, we always celebrate. The hat is comfortable to wear and fits my husbands head great. It is made out of polyester and is designed well. I am happy with it. I recieved this item in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,These are my favorite brand - fit nicely & last!!!
5.0,This jacket came in just the way I ordered it !
5.0,"I wear a 9.5 and ordered a 9...fits perfectly! I have flat feet and shoes with any heel are usually very uncomfortable. These shoes are comfy - I walked all over the city in these bad boys & my feet didn't hurt! They're cute too, so that's a plus! And for the price, they're definitely a bargain."
5.0,"Fits perfect, zips wonderfully, stays true to size with washing, and doesn’t pill up.  One of my dad’s favorites!!!  Bough in several colors :)"
5.0,Perfect fit and well loved by my grandson!
5.0,6th Birthday. She couldn't wait to put it on and didn't take it off before leaving Grandma's house. Usually my son won't let the Grands wear new clothes until after they have been washed!
5.0,comfortable and the colors are pretty
5.0,I absolutely love this! It’s so cute! I wear it casually and with cosplay. The only down side is it’s a little heavy so it gives me a headache after a few hours.
5.0,Very comfortable scrub hat. It is now one of my favorite scrub hats. I really love the pattern that I picked out. I have gotten many compliments.. The pull tab thing you secure the hat in back is awesome. The buttons to hold your mask on the side are a bonus!
5.0,I love it. Thanks for the great service.
5.0,They are the right size and the pairs actually match each other.
5.0,I got a couple of these from a friend that were quickly used in my shop.  I needed several more so I tried these. They make great battery storage/carrying bags for my Makita hand tools by keeping jobsite dirt out of the contact area. Lettering out for fully charged and turned in for discharged.  Easy to see in the toolbox. Easy to clean in the washer if needed.  Perfect for what I needed.  The couple that were left are in with my camping gear to be used a stuff sacks.
5.0,"I like this dress, the material is lovely and fits nicely."
5.0,Quilt is great. Not see through. Thick material.
5.0,My wife had purchased a few pairs of walk around house shoes for me while out of town from Zappos.  As soon as I put them on I could tell none of them were going to work as they did not have any arch support.  Even the memory foam ones did not provide the support.  I did some research and found Orthofeet!  They arrived today as I am work from home and as soon as I put them on my feet were happy!  Have not taken them off all day.  Even went outside to test the bottoms and solid as a rock and the arch support is awesome. I will probably buy a couple more pair just to stage away for future use!  Highly recommend especially for those that like true support and comfort.  Worth the money!
5.0,They were what I paid for... all for fun for my student’s last day of school. That being said remember they are not intended to be sturdy.
5.0,Great quality for the price. Super cute too!
5.0,Seems good value
5.0,even though the fit tight... I'm told they are suppose to be that way. He normally wears a 4T....I bought a 5T. maybe should have bought one more size up...but my grandson loved them and that's all that matters....
5.0,Absolutely love this new version of the US title.  This sucker has some weight to it!  Definitely recommend for any belt collector.
5.0,I bought these earrings for a friend. Good quality and workmanship. They were very pretty and my friend was very pleased and she loved them.  Would buy again.

5.0,"These are great little tables.  Well-built, well-packaged.  I was very pleased with them and found the other positive reviews to be on the mark for this item."
5.0,"Love the color, fit as expected my daughter like them a lot because of the bunny ears."
5.0,Beautiful Puff-Sleeve Skirted Leotard. Size 110 fits perfectly for my 3-year-old. I also bought Size 120 which fits perfectly for my 5-year-old. Sleeves are puffed as pictured and garter around the arm isn't tight at all but still keeps the puff on the sleeve.
5.0,"Kate and Macy make fun, reasonably priced jewelry. I am addicted. This one goes perfectly with an outfit I have. It also has just the right amount of bling. The other thing I like about these folks is if they make a mistake on your order or if something happens in the delivery process, they make it right. Very easy to deal with."
5.0,Breathable and comfortable!  Love this shoe!
5.0,"I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.  Though he has not revived it yet as it's not Christmas yet, I know he will love it.  The watch comes in an attractive box perfect for gift giving.  The watch itself is much more beautiful than the pictures.  It is elegant, classic, and solid quality, fit, and finish.  The day date can be set in English or Chinese.  The movements are smooth Japanese quartz, the face, case, and hands are finished exquisitely, and the leather band is high quality and will fit many size wrists.  It is so beautiful I am thinking of getting one of the other available color options for myself.  Great Looking watch, well beyond the price paid, great value, highly recommend."
5.0,"I'm new to using cushions for my shoes. My heels develop hard skin due to constant friction with the shoe, so the Heel cushion is the first one I tried out. I love it, and trying out the other cushions. Planning to order their Forefoot cushion for Ball of foot, and Back of heel cushion to break in the shoe."
5.0,I bought this for my husband for Father’s Day and I can’t wait to give it to him . I will order from them again for sure .fyi I never write reviews but this product is worthy
5.0,"Two pairs made for a great gift for a family member this holiday season. I received feedback that she very much enjoys using them - they are durable, easy to clean and are working well for her."
5.0,Great lightweight sandal with a great gripping bottom. Excellent shower and travel sandal.
5.0,Really good lenses for the price
5.0,"Love this top!  Nice fabric that washes well.  Color is as pictured, red is not the best description, it is more of a heathered wine color.  Very cute!"
5.0,"I love this bag! Light, plenty of space with three pockets which makes it easy to stay organized and to find what you are looking for quickly. Three different handles to cary the bag depending on your needs. If it gets dirty, you can wash in the washing machine which is a plus as well."
5.0,good service from this seller<br />couldn’t ask for anything better<br />thanks
5.0,My husband bought this beautiful bracelet and it is gorgeous and it fits beautifully
5.0,It fits my bracelet nice.
5.0,"Lovelovelove Teva Sandles and lovelovelove the boots even more! I had to size up half a size. My regular size was a bit tight so I swapped them out and they're perfect! Very waterproof but easily scuffed on some of the ""trim."""
5.0,"Perfect one. Love it and feel that it loves me, too."
5.0,I bought these tights for my five year old daughter.I ordered L and it fit perfect.The material is soft but stretchy. The quality is good and the price is great too.
5.0,Bought for my honeymoon and was so impressed I ordered a 2nd one.  I did have to take the elastic on the sleeves in a little so they’d stay up but that’s just because I’m so short.
5.0,"Only downfall would be the sidled of your keyhole on some keys, like car fobs. This ring is flat, instead of like conventional ones being stacked on itself."
5.0,The picture does not do it justice. A bargain.
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Good quality for price.
5.0,This dress is so comfortable and cool. The material is nice and soft. Quick delivery. Thank you.
5.0,Very satisfied with purchase.
5.0,This watch is stunning in person! Extremely heavy and well made. The edges of the band are a bit sharp all around but not enough to complain about it. The clasp is solid and it looks amazing. Packaging was equally as impressive. The perfect gift!!<br />Shipped way faster than expected.
5.0,Super soft and comfy. Love that it could be a good or just loose like a scarf. True to size.
5.0,"perfect , my wife loved it"
5.0,"This septum hinged clicker is the best one I have gotten of this type and size.  Just the right size and it's very smooth. Some of the other brands I have were ruff around the hinges, and scratched my piercing. I had to remove them within hours of putting them in because my nose started burning and itching. But this one I had in for two months, no problems at all!  Very well made."
5.0,Very classy look and very carefully packed for delivery..
5.0,Fits me just right. I love this new dress.
5.0,Love this suit! Very flattering and love how it looks on!
5.0,Fits perfectly will buy again
5.0,Very cute shoes Thank you!
5.0,great price real leather
5.0,Very comfortable with decent support. This is the second pair I've owned. I have major flat feet and my feet don't tire in these.
5.0,"The item is exactly like it’s described in the picture. For great, authentic, and super cute and sexy! Love it!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:829e02202eab6eeef94e0957e6943d3b]] Used this product for Halloween
5.0,"They would be decent quality work out pants. Something you could easily go from the gym, to run, to play sports or to lay around the house in.<br /><br />I got a men's small for me. (I'm a size med woman) I should have got a larger size. That was my fault. I have ordered several of these kinds of pants for my husband and I have stolen them from him, and he has taken them back hahaha.<br /><br />These came and he immediately took them and tried them on. (Thinking they we're for him) They were very tight on him (he's an XL but they still went on him) and even on me, they are a bit tight. But I'm not sure what size I am in a men's work out pants. Other then nailing down my size we both like the pant, just not the size.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with these pants. I'll have to get a pair in the right size. I'm sure my husband can find someone at work to give them to. If not my niece would probably wear them. I don't like women's work out pants AT ALL."
5.0,Super comfy and warm. Great for those winter walks and keeps your legs warm without a lot of extra weight.
5.0,"I love these slippers. Nice cushion, very comfy!"
5.0,The color is so vibrant I love it. It’s super comfy and “teacher” wonderful.
5.0,I have no qualms about this product. Each band fits perfectly and they give me more comfort than the band that came with the watch. Two thumbs up 👍🏾👍🏾
5.0,[[VIDEOID:b453285facc9392980ebeb1ab168e3a3]] I love how easy it was to put on and that its reversible. If I wanted to go red it would be super easy to do so! Very strong  Magnets!! Far better than the last one I bought from a different store!
5.0,"I've had this hat for years. It's been all over the world with me and I still wear it all the time, even as I type this review. Great product and if I ever lost it, I'd buy it again"
5.0,gave this as a gift to go with a NinaQueen charm and it fits perfectly. It came in a nice package and the person I gave it to loves it. It also does fit Pandora charms on it. I got the 7.5&#34; bracelet which fit my small wrist with a sufficient amount of room to spare.
5.0,"This bracelet was a great surprise.  I love it! Its lead free and wrapped around my wrist 4 times with room to spare! (I have to wear 8 inch bracelets) Very light weight, very pretty. Super excited.  Love the words."
5.0,I like how they fit my big head.  I actually liked them so much i bougt 4 pairs.
5.0,normally wear a x-lg got the 2x and it fit perfectly!! I LOVE this top!! wish they had it in every color!
5.0,Beautiful made! Love this but was to tight on boobs.
5.0,"Be careful run small, but it's exactly at the photo! Beatiful"
5.0,Great ring. Tons of compliments. Looks great on my hand. Not too chunky. Very comfortable.
5.0,I can't believe how awesome this thing is for the price. It looks exactly like the picture...the XL is exactly like an XL should be...no crazy small sizing. It is so cozy and after using it for a costume I look forward to wearing it as a robe LOL. The opening at the top is pretty big like another reviewer said but not any bigger than it looks in the photo in my opinion. It's kind of an off the shoulder deal if you don't put the hood up. It doesn't bother me in the least though as I plan on putting a red tank top or some kind of body suit on under it. This really is a steal for the price for as sexy and cute as it is!
5.0,"Nice material, you should definitely order a size up than your normal size. I would also add the gray color is very pretty, more like a lavender or smoky blue."
5.0,"This is my third pair of these boots. The first pair was not the waterproof type and lasted over three years of continuous wear. The second pair was waterproof and lasted three years before the sole cracked loose and they started to leak. All-in-all not bad when they were priced at fifty dollars. They were actually waterproof, which is too be expected, but is not always delivered. Fit is good and they were comfortable after the initial break in period. The cost rose to about $90 dollars and it is possible to many other boots for that price, but I chose to stick with these since I an happy with their quality  and performance."
5.0,"I love this dress! I am 5’11” and 144lbs and usually wear a dress size 8, but after reading the reviews I decided to size up from what I thought I should wear (I ordered an XL) and it fits perfect except the back is a little big. Nothing a little pinning can’t fix. Everything else was exactly as it should be! 10/10 would recommend."
5.0,This is a great shirt. I wasn’t expecting much. I went by the size guide and ordered two sizes larger. Normally I’m a medium and I ordered an xl. It’s great; a looser fit without being too big.
5.0,So cute! My best friend thought it was a cute addition to his gift.
5.0,"I love this bathing suit, i am 4’10 weight 105 and a small fit me perfect . It is comfortable and I love that it’s high waisted . Both pieces fit me exactly how I wanted it too. Will definitely buy another color"
5.0,I will definitely get more! My partner takes them over😒
5.0,exactly what I needed
5.0,Another great pair of shorts from Ralph Lauren. Need occasional ironing.
5.0,Is good kinda small
5.0,"Very comfortable! Great length and I like that the very top can be rolled down a bit. I just wish they came in a smaller size, as I only wear a women's 7 1/2, so the heel is a bit high on me. But the size does seem pretty spot on."
5.0,Item good. The packaging was immensely pleasing. Speedy to send. Wish all sellers were this super.
5.0,I get alot of compliments on it.  I like that is' not as big as some of the other masks.
5.0,"I bought this for myself and 2 friends also. I love it because I no longer have to rely on my husband to help me put on my bracelets in the morning. I find it quite easy to use, but my one friend, who is left-handed is having a bit of a struggle getting the knack of it."
5.0,"I like it, perfect for me"
5.0,My daughter is thrilled. It’s just like the picture and will be perfect for her costume!
5.0,This dress is beautiful and it fit as expected.
5.0,"This dress is VERY comfortable to wear!  I've been thinking about picking up a couple more in different colors.  I got the black for a funeral.  Although it's a little heavier than t-shirt material, I was still able to dress it up a bit so that it didn't look too casual.  I normally wear a 14-16 and got the XXL. However, I wish I got the XL instead.  It's a little too baggy.  Also, I'm 5'3 and if I use flats, there's a chance that I'll step on it.  I have to kick my feet out a little more so I don't trip myself LOL!<br />Love the pockets!"
5.0,These look great on my three year old son for our family photo. They fit as expected.
5.0,Love this bag. I mainly use it as a backpack but it works well as a cross body too! Plenty of room inside without being bulky. There a a couple of pockets inside to keep track of the little things. I do wish the outside pocket was a bit larger. It's a tight squeeze for my Note 4.
5.0,The angel wing necklace is just beautiful!  The colorful gems sparkle and the whole piece looks wonderful.  Love it!
5.0,Perfect fit..<br />good fabrics..<br />Love it..
5.0,I love these no show socks!  I ordered the nude color. I have ordered socks like this in the past and they have always slipped off my heel. Amazingly these fit perfect. I also love the little grippers at the bottom of the socks.
5.0,super cute - wore with sandals and statement necklace. lots of compliments.
5.0,I love this wallet! The design and functionality are great!
5.0,No adjustment needed. Very comfy!
5.0,Love it. So easy to use and very accurate and stylish.
5.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry. Simple yet elegant bought it for my 13 year old and she is loving it
5.0,"Fits great, I love the T-shirt over long look."
5.0,My daughter loved it she want more of this company's jewelry lol ty
5.0,I can’t put a photo because it’ll be considered explicit. But I had my private area pierced years ago. I buy mew jewelry for it every so often. I used the round bar with a ball at both ends. So far it’s been good to me. I cleaned it first then put it in. I love it. Also love the fact that it’s not heavy.
5.0,"Absolutely Wonderful, Thank You So Much!"
5.0,"Buy this top true to size! The sizing reviews were weird, so I bought both the medium and large, and ended up sending the large back. For reference, I'm 5'8&#34;, 150#, 34DD, and typically wear size 8/Med."
5.0,"Bought this for my son's birthday.  He was so happy with it.  The pics are good, but it just does not do it justice.<br />Fast shipping.  Couldn't be happier"
5.0,These were perfect for what I wanted.
5.0,great dance leotard for the price
5.0,"got my package in 2 days as promised. The scarf is beautiful and I love it. Just wished I had seen it sooner, It would have made great Christmas gifts."
5.0,"My daughter loves it, and it fits perfectly! Took a while to arrive, but worth the wait."
5.0,"It's smaller than I expected, but very high quality. The zippers are smooth. I was a little worried about the tassels on the zipper pulls looking cheap or tacky, but they don't at all. The bag feels nice outside and in. The lining is wonderfully soft. I can't believe I bought this for $25!<br /><br />It has two main zippered pockets on top - one with a skippered compartment inside and one with two small open pockets. On the sides there are two small snap closure pockets (not big enough for a water bottle). The back has a hand-depth zippered pocket and the front has two snap closure pockets as well (also both about hand depth and hand width as well).<br /><br />PS That red on the inside zipper is not really there, it's a reflection from my Christmas tree ;)"
5.0,"Bought this for a 16 year old niece, I am told she loved it and appreciated it. Nice way to let a young lady know you care for her especially if she has had a rough week."
5.0,It's a chiffon ballet skirt.
5.0,Me gusta todo. Es muy hermosa 💖
5.0,"I love this wallet.  For years, I watched family members and friends carry giant, overstuffed wallets, full of things they didn't need.  Their wallets were uncomfortable to sit on and hard to get into and out of front pockets.  I'm determined not to do the same, and this wallet is a big part of the solution.  It lets me carry my credit cards, driver's license, medical cards, AAA card, cash, receipts, and even a spare bandage all in an amazingly lightweight, small package.  It weights almost nothing, it's tough, and it just works.  It adds essentially no weight or space to what you're carrying in it.  Now I just have to convince everyone else to leave what they don't need behind and switch to this wallet."
5.0,this is a pretty nice product. easy to use and performs a advertised. I recommend this.
5.0,This shirt looks great and is so comfortable!
5.0,"I liked that you put three drops of the solution a Q-tip, rub the metal object for 15 - 30 seconds, and if it has  nickel in it, the metal will turn pink. So easy!"
5.0,MY son adores this. Good quality
5.0,My husband loves star Wars so I got this for his birthday. He loved it.

5.0,I bought this for son and he loves it. He wears it everywhere even the shower. It seems pretty durable and he loves the backlight feature.
5.0,Great for my granddaughter
5.0,I work nights and the light of day makes it hard to get a good rest/sleep.  Now I am able to get better sleep using Eye Snugs.  Wonderful product and not expensive at all.  I have tried many different types of sleep masks and this is the best sleep mask I have tried so far.
5.0,Best value in polarized!
5.0,Does what it says. Quality good.
5.0,"So cute,and well made.compliments on them all the time.I had to have matching necklace!"
5.0,I just received this broach today and was pleasantly surprised. For the price I can’t believe the quality of this item. I’m very impressed with this purchase. For the price I didn’t feel it was a risky purchase but I’m amazed at the quality. Good deal.
5.0,"I am very satisfied with the sweat bands. They are nice and soft, and they do their job. Some people on here have complained about it leaving marks in their forehead. They are brand new, what do you expect? The sweat bands serve their purpose well."
5.0,"Light weight, stylish"
5.0,Great party favor! A big hit.
5.0,Loose fitting. But very comfortable.

5.0,"Though it's a little larger than I expected, but I really like the hat."

5.0,I love this robe.  It is so fun.  I am on call for work at night and put this robe on before signing onto my computer to work.  It is my favorite piece of my work wardrobe.  It is cozy and so soft.
5.0,"These not only make my luggage easier to carry, but they also enable one to put identity information on inside.  Also help one identify one's own luggage as it comes out of the chute upon arrival."
5.0,"El producto recibido es lo que estaba buscando, es de calidad y creo que he realizado una excelente compra."
5.0,Vibrant colors and good quality!
5.0,"Love the Trump red.  It matches, perfectly, that which the President wears!"

5.0,It is a wonderful bracelet!
5.0,Ordered for my daughter who wears 6/8 and she loves it!!!  Not too baggy but nice and loose.  It is not a “sweatshirt” material but is also not that super thin shiny cheap  t-shirt type material that a lot of the shirt that I order from Amazon are either.
5.0,Look and feel great
5.0,"outstanding thanks,"
5.0,Does great for when were riding on our side by side during the winter here in Texas without a window or heat. &lt;3 :)
5.0,Wife's purchase. She loves the fit and it look great on
5.0,Just wore them for the first time.  I usually wear Oakley but these were on sale and thought I would give them a try.  They fit perfect.  I prefer large glasses which these are.  They sit high and give total protection and field of view when riding in the drops.  Sweat seems to bead off but time will tell.
5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal!!!!!!!!!! I’m 5,4 185 lbs. I’m a bodybuilder and have competed before. These are my favorite gym shorts I’ve EVER owned. I’ve been in the gym for 10+ years"
5.0,Bought for granddaughter. Was exactly what expected.
5.0,"It's cute, just the right size and it goes with the longer Moxesy Wallet Size Coin Purse, that I also purchased.  The background colors are just a bit different.  I love it and it's working just great!"
5.0,I love this i wore it till it broke my daughter broke it on me but i plan on getting another soon!!!!
5.0,"Fit perfectly, will order for more.."
5.0,As expedted
5.0,I love this dress. I am 5'1 and 126 lbs and ordered a M. It fit me like a dream. The seller was extremely helpful and helped ship the dress just in time for my birthday. Please ignore the boots and tights in the picture. It was snowing and I had to step out.
5.0,I used this dress to go the beach.
5.0,"I normally wear medium or size 6 in dresses. I am 5' 5&#34; 130lbs. 34C-28-40 I bought a large and it fits perfectly. I love, love, love it. Wish they had more dresses like this."
5.0,These bags are awesome! Especially for the price!  We used them to make First Aid bags for our PD to carry in their patrol vehicles.
5.0,Yes guys get this - especially if you wear hard boots.
5.0,This is a very nice shirt.  Exactly as represented in the ad.
5.0,Love this romper... It is cut very low in the front. But overall great item. Came within two after I placed my order.
5.0,Bought them for a friend/coworker leaving the company! He loved them!
5.0,"but, that is just because the pictures looked really big. I have never bought shoe charms before so I was surprised there. but, they are beautiful and well made. Recommend them to anyone."
5.0,Item was as described. I like it.
5.0,"I'm very happy with his bag so far. I wasn't sure if the leather trim was leather or faux leather but as far as I can tell it seems to be soft real leather but who knows. I use it as a gym bag and I like the way it hangs off my shoulder and has the two carry-handles. I use a canvas bag for my gym shoes and a canvas bag for toiletries and then my gym clothes go in between, it works for me! I'm happy :)"
5.0,Very good fitting hats. Fits ages 4-11. Stretchy knit material. Fast shipping.
5.0,Reduced my headaches and looks cute on
5.0,"Extremely soft shirt! I love the simplicity of it, and I love the length! ...just a really super cute t-shirt!"
5.0,Color and style were perfect.
5.0,I found this as described.  Fits close enough but I may have gone up a size the shoulders are a little too tight for free range of motion.
5.0,This is a nice on as it looks in the picture. The colours are vibrant.
5.0,Very  nice  chain
5.0,love these lightweight cardis!
5.0,"Such a nice comfortable dress. I'm a tall curvy girl first I bought grey in xl and absolutely loved it. Easy to dress up or down. Then I purchased black in large, also nice but has a little more shine to the material where it stretches so I prefer the grey. Wonderful buy and very comfortable."
5.0,So far it’s been what I wanted. A sleek durable wallet that I can wear in my front pocket. It’s also nice knowing that the wallet is made from a decommissioned fire hose. How cool is that?!  Doing good for the earth and creating Jobs in the US!  Can’t get much better than that!
5.0,Excelente reloj
5.0,ordered my size and it had a decent bit of xtra space in it without being too loose. 2 thumbs up
5.0,My daughter loves the fit and softness.
5.0,Like<br />Office party
5.0,love it! fast shipping and good quality.
5.0,"Love these shirt, fit as I expected and very comfortable."
5.0,"These are hands down my favorite burp cloths. They are soft, the perfect size and hold up well after several washings. Wish I would have put more of these on my registry."
5.0,"LOVE THIS DRESS. I BOUGHT THIS DRESS TO TAKE IT TO MY TRIP TO COSTA RICA THIS SUMMER AND ALL I CAN SAY IS: WOW!!! SO COMFORTABLE, SEXY AND BEAUTIFUL. I GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS."
5.0,Love the button details. Fits perfectly and comfortably.
5.0,"Cheaper than buying directly from Nike! Great quality, does the job!"
5.0,"Good:<br />Have had this watch for about two weeks and I LOVE it. It is EXTREMELY light weight (almost impossible to feel on your wrist unless you have it so tight it is cutting off circulation which you shouldn't be doing anyway). If it is tightened properly, you cannot feel it. The time is easy to read. The band is plastic, meaning it is waterproof and you don't have to take it off to wash your hands (like I was having to do with all my leather bands and getting annoyed). Also shows the day and the date, which is super helpful during a hectic work week when everything starts to blur together.<br /><br />Has a retro 1980s vibe that is totally in right now with Stranger Things and hipsters and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. Somehow, after all of these features, the watch still costs only $9. Thus, I offer this watch up as the very best value in any watches anywhere. I thought my $20 Timex was a good value, but after buying this watch the Timex just sits in my drawer since it seems so comparatively heavy, high maintenance (canvas band that starts to smell funky after a few weeks and needs watching). I wear this watch daily and get a weird kick out of putting it on. The best $9 I have spent in a long time. Has an aesthetic that is 100% functional/pragmatic, which just makes it a fun thing to use. I wish I had purchased this watch YEARS ago. I am excited about using this watch to backpack since I am not afraid about it being stolen, quickly tells me the time (digital), won't absorb odors or show dirt, and weighs nothing.<br /><br />Bad:<br />The one thing I wish this watch had was an Indiglo feature like Timex watches have, since the light up feature on this watch is sufficient to see, but not nearly as nice as Timex Indiglo."
5.0,It’s a lovely necklace that looks just like the picture. The length of the chain is rather short for me. But other than that it was a great purchase!
5.0,Perfect and right on time.  Thanks you.
5.0,"The dress fit me perfectly. I'm 5'8&#34; and about 235, curvy. I ordered the 2x because I didn't want it too snug. Accentuated my curves and the length hit just above my knees. Thick stretchy fabric as well. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,I love the dome. It works perfectly. I recommend it to anyone looking for a magnifying glass they can use and keep both hands free.
5.0,I bought 2 of these hats for my husband and his brother who were dressing up as Scrooge and Marley for Christmas. These hats were perfect and sturdy enough to be used again for other costumes that would require a top hat. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"I love these socks.  These are a thinner blend material than cotton alone, but I am very impressed.  I have washed these socks several times now and they seem to be more durable and comfortable.  They are also warm and cool depending on the Texas weather."
5.0,"Love-love-love it! Fits well on a man’s head, and is made for those who want to wear a scrub cap with not a lot of hair underneath. I’ve had a difficult time finding form fitted scrub caps for men, as most of the ones sold are geared  towards women with heavier amounts of hair. I had the bottom sewed in about 0.5 inches in so it would fit more snug on my head."
5.0,I am ready for summer this is a nice and cool dress I like the way it fits and looks it is very pretty I like polkadots they are my favorite you can wear it out to dinner to the beach or the pool the dress is made for all.
5.0,Got this gift for my wife on Christmas.  Order was processed very quickly and the necklace is fantastic. Would definitely buy again
5.0,"I got these for my daughters to decorate their backpacks.  These are so nice looking for the price.  WE all love the designs and colors.  The backs all stay on well. Note that these are much small than they are depicted in the product listing but they are just the right size for bags, jackets, etc.. I would order these again."
5.0,This was for my granddaughter’s first homecoming dance.  As shown in the picture she looked beautiful in it and she had the time of her life at the dance.
5.0,"I like this so much I'm ordering another, and I wish I could get away with having a couple of them--I'm just not quite a uniform person! The fabric is just thick enough, and the dress is cut so that it's going to skim over those curves and round tummies in a flattering way. A lot of inexpensive dresses don't know how to cut things between the knees and chest, and I appreciate this. The wrap top wraps where it's supposed to and stays there, even if you're very, very curvy in that region. All around, this is one of the best dresses I've bought on Amazon. Do size up--I'm somewhere on the M-L-XL spectrum, closer to M in L's, but the 1X is the right fit."
5.0,I love this. It does have a bit of a smell but it's not horrible and seemed to go away pretty fast. I'm picky about my wallets and this one is perfect
5.0,These bags are perfect!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!! Will be ordering additional ones for the Family Reunion.
5.0,"Not American Sized but after sizing up (I normally wear a 2x) it is just fine. Thicker than I expected and the back hits just at my hips. WIll work perfectly for this late summer and early fall, early Spring!"
5.0,"Me agrado todo de estas gafas , me encantan!!!! Siempre me preguntan donde las compre y me dan muchos cumplidos , lo que más me gusta a parte de su diseño es que no pesan nada , he usado muchos espejuelos incluso de marcas reconocidas y mi batalla siempre ha sido que termino con dolor de cabeza , amo estos espejuelos los compraría mil veces sin dudas , y están bellos , bellísimos !!!!"
5.0,i love the bracelet.
5.0,"I've continued to by these shoes over the years. I wear them out quick, but for me they are very comfortable."
5.0,This bracelet is so beautiful and at such a reasonable price! I don't think I could love it anymore than I do.
5.0,I’m really glad that I purchased this! It’s beautiful and hopefully it will last!
5.0,"Beautiful color and sturdy. This is my second one e, only becuse I wore the other one out"
5.0,Absolutely best wallet that I have ever owned.
5.0,This cardigan is nice and thick which is great for those colder days. It looks great with pretty much anything such as skinny jeans or straight cargo pants and some basic tops. The color is a more bright ivory than cream. I’ve washed it once and it seems to hold up well and dried in the machine with no problem. Love the overall shape and form. Quality is not bad. I would recommend it!
5.0,Very comfortable and received lots of complements.
5.0,Thank you so much for the hat. Our baby look adorable. The hat fits perfect on her.<br />The delivery was smooth & fast too. Thank you again.
5.0,"I LOVE IT!!!! NO ISSUES. I read the reviews before ordering, and noted that it runs small, so I ordered the XXL. It is perfectly snug, however if my boobs were bigger than a 36C it would not have fit. I bet that certain padded bras will make it a little tight too, but I don't intend to wear those with this jacket anyway. If you would normally order an L or XL jacket, order the XXL. It definitely runs small. FANTASTIC DEAL for $36 bucks. I will dry clean it so it lasts longer, I suspect washing would destroy it after a few cycles. But it's perfect for my needs as a cute travel jacket and to wear at events."
5.0,"This is an awesome belt!  No more big bump under my shirts.  It is high quality and good looking.  The seller shipped and packed the belt carefully and quickly.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />Debbie Fulmer Evans"
5.0,These pants fit as expected<br />Up passed the tummy and they don’t roll down<br />Wear them as often as I can
5.0,Shirt is very flattering and fits great.  It washed up great with no shrinking or fading.  It is super soft and comfortable. This is definitely going to be a go to shirt for the fall season.
5.0,I love the shoes! They are so comfortable and the seller got them to me very quick.  I bought the black for work but plan to by other colors and designs for everyday. The best part is the seller was easy to contact about the product and was quick to respond. It in nice to work with a seller that is so helpful.
5.0,I like how they fit and the shorts are comfortable
5.0,Love it<br />Was a gift for Christmas
5.0,Fiancée loved it. Looks quite expensive and well polished. Wouldn't expect it to be made of plastic.
5.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and these go all the way to my ankles comfortably! They're soft, flexible and def recommend for working out or causal wear."
5.0,"This sweater is absolutely ADORABLE!!<br />I am 5' 5&#34; and 125 lbs.  I am Large chested and it fits me perfectly!!<br />The material is FANTASTIC and I have gotten many compliments when wearing it!!  The Khaki Color is lovely too!!<br />I really do love it, I just  purchased one in black too!!"
5.0,I love the stylist gold and soft feel. The cover allowed me to change the color of all black to a stylish gold and cover for my watch!
5.0,I love the different sizes they fit perfectly beside each other up the ear lobe for multiple ear piercings. Also cute nose earring for already pierced.
5.0,Great quality and fit great.
5.0,"did a lot of research on this watch before buying it, it exceded all my expectations."
5.0,So adorable! Fit perfect! Lightweight for a warm holiday but fancy. Win. Win.
5.0,Got this for my husband & he keeps it next to his table but the couch
5.0,Exactly as described! Love my hat!
5.0,Will be given as a gift. Looks nice and recieved quickly.
5.0,Very comfortable and warm. Would buy again.
5.0,the fabric is a little bit thin but it's not so thin that it's a problem. It fits nicely!
5.0,arrived when expected and were beautiful
5.0,My husband love these shoes they are lightweight yet protective and they came with gloves
5.0,"For me , it's Just beautiful  ! No complaint and regret !😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
5.0,"it comes in a little fancy box that I would say it seems like a real Triumph product with its part number and all, if it is or not, the quality is like it is. great value for its price"
5.0,"Just like everyone else when I first opened the package I was afraid it will not fit, but they fit AWESOME !! and kept me nice tight around the waist to keep my tummy in. They are not see thru , comfortable and I am not small at all so ladies size 14-16 these will fit great, and they arrived quickly thank you !!"
5.0,This. Dress. Is . BEAUTIFUL!<br />I was really skeptical at first but I tried it on my 6 month old daughter when it arrived and it is awesome. I can't wait for her pictures from her dedication in this dress. It's worth the money. Great buy.
5.0,"Beautiful gloves! I ordered the size S because I have very small hands, but most gloves don't fit me well, even when I get the smallest size. These actually fit very nice and snug and look amazing! they are also warm and feel soft. I am really impressed and recommend the lambskin leather feel! Very stylish. I attached photos of the product and my unboxing of it, along with an image of the glove on my hand. I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest and unbiased review and I am very pleased. This would also make a wonderful holiday gift for someone!"
5.0,I bought these as a gift for my fiance.  They look great in person!
5.0,I am 5-4. I have to wear heels so it does not hit the floor. It feels so soft and cool. I always receive compliments every time I wear it.
5.0,Perfect 2 clip on your Jean's so u dont lose ur glasses.
5.0,Exactly as pictured and described. Beautiful colors. Arrived quickly.
5.0,These shoes are comfortable and<br />very resonable
5.0,Love this purse. Great for traveling. Organized pockets. Lots of room.
5.0,These are exactly as wonderful as expected.
5.0,Love it. One of my favorites
5.0,"Good quality and comfortable, but red color makes this boots look like for children so I had to return them"
5.0,"I like these shirts! After receiving and wearing the first one, I ordered two more. The shirt feels great; it’s the type of shirt you want to wear every day. The bad reviews are because they run small. I wear an XL normally but I found the 3XL or 4XL to fit very well."
5.0,Love these shors. Good fit and good quality!
5.0,Omg!!!! gorgeous!!!! Beautiful color And good price I’m so happy
5.0,"I love this, the design is perfect.  It’s a little bigger than I thought it would be but hey, I’m loving being a Jedi."
5.0,These in white are by far the cutest best looking sunglasses that have ever had the pleasure to grace my face. I have a large face and finding sunglasses is hard. I received these at a highly discounted price in exchange for my honest review and I was not compensated. I am so glad I've had the opportunity because I really adore them even though my teenage daughter has TAKEN them from me!! I'm a sunglasses freak with about 18-22 pairs give or take a few and finding good ones are hard! They usually go to one of my girls and these are among the top of my list. WearMe Pro rarely ever disappoints. So much fun. I'll get mine back eventually! Or I'll just buy more!
5.0,works great washable
5.0,This suit is super cute and very well made. I bought a size smaller than my son normally wears because my friend bought one for her son and said it ran big. It fit perfectly. The only complaint is the &#34;bowtie&#34;. It is just a piece of fabric with a safety pin glued on. I bought a different tie and it looked super cute. Overall a great buy!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:cf3f882dd99f9a5edcfdc34ad30ce97a]] Very beautiful. i was afraid that for the price it was going to look cheap and i wouldn't wear it. But wow. Im speachless. Awesome piece. Awesome price. Highly recommended
5.0,"Looks good, feels good! Thanks."
5.0,"I love it! So comfortable, and stylish. it supports very well. I washed it couple of times in the machine and it looks as new as before. I am so glad that I bought this."
5.0,"It’s a little faded, but still nice!"
5.0,I love the material and the design. My favorite summer 👗 dress.
5.0,"Our family just moved into a master plan community in Henderson NV and we have four pools that are ours to use. I picked up these goggles for my son who is almost two. I want him to get used to the water and having goggles on.<br /><br />Here’s a rundown of the features.<br />-Appearance. These are exactly as pictured on the product page. How fun are these!!! They are bright orange and yellow with these fun soft silicone spikes, perfect for the spunky kid.<br />-Fit and comfort. This is a bit big for my two year old but when he’s around 4 and up, these will fit great. I tried them on myself and found them to be a little small (I do have a smallish frame though) but as far as I could tell they were comfortable around the eyes.<br />-Extras. These goggles came with a very nice carrying case. Also inside were two different lengths of nose bridges for adjustments.<br />-Price Point. At 22.00 this is a bit pricey but they are so much fun I think its worth the extra.<br /><br />Overall these will be getting a lot of use at our pools this summer.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,this was a incredibel deal and its perfect
5.0,"Great image on the sock. These are really nice but I was expecting a little thicker material from a Stance sock. Don't get me wrong, the quality is very good."
5.0,Liked that it was as I expected.
5.0,"these are AMAZING. i didn’t think they would stay put, but they do!!!!"
5.0,Order at least one size up I normally ware a small I ordered a medium they are a snug fit<br />I love the fit and they are very comfortable for running and RPM
5.0,Absolutely love this bracelet.  It is very difficult to find high quality knock offs that look real.  Wear mine all the time.
5.0,"I bought the dress for my Wicked Witch costume, and now I'm in love! I got so many compliments on the dress throughout the day, plus it was super comfortable and fun to wear! I will definitely find a way to wear it again as an outfit rather than a costume."
5.0,"Just recieved item and the material is very sturdy. Nice size bag, not too big not too small."
5.0,I ordered a size up based on all the reviews and glad I did. It fits perfect. Super soft material!!
5.0,Cards fit in and place for coins and dollars
5.0,"Great in wet weather, can be a little sweaty if it's hot."
5.0,"Absolutely incredible! I don't know what in the world the other people have experienced regarding this product but I couldn't be happier. For reference I have a Model: DW5600E-1V, I was unable to install it onto the watch and ended up breaking the strap. I sent a message and I got a free one sent to me within 20 minutes of speaking with them. Then I took it to a watch repair shop and they installed it within seconds and it was only 10 bucks. And wow is it incredible, lightweight & breathable & huge improvement from the resin strap. Everyone at my work has been asking about it. Aircraft mechanic approved! thank you for making a great product."
5.0,I have a bunch of masks and this is by far the softest and most comfortable one I have!  Love it.
5.0,So far do good
5.0,"This sun shirt is exactly what I was looking for.  I ordered up (XL) and with that I have room to move.  Also have room to tuck.  I would have liked it better if it came with thumb holes.  I put some in myself.  Lightweight, dried fast, beautiful color(I got the bright fushia) don't remember what they called it.  Good buy for me.  Will consider a second one."
5.0,"Great quality for the price!! Washed them once so far, and they held their shape and color.  Will be repurchasing additional ones soon."
5.0,Works great. It was an improvement over the cheap band that came that came on my Citizen. The only issue I have is it has opened up by accident a couple of times.
5.0,"Nice color, perfect fit."
5.0,"I really like the coat. It is a great in-kitchen coat. I thought the mesh vent was just at the underarms, but it is the top half of the back, which gives a great cooling all day. I agree that the buttons are poorly secured, but one has yet to fall off. I just took them to my tailor and had her reinforce them. You can just grab some thread and a needle and do it yourself it is a big concern. I can say that the issue with buttons in no way makes me regret the coats, which was a concern after reading some reviews. They look great and are light. They do not make a great front of the house coat, but are great for every day wear."
5.0,I ADORE this top. It’s among my favorite things I’ve ever worn. I got it in black a few weeks ago and I wanted to buy several more just in case anything ever happens to the first one but it’s sold out!!!!!!! I am devastated. This happened with another top on Amazon recently as well so moving forward I will place additional orders on things I love ASAP after trying them on.
5.0,love color and size

5.0,Love the mask ! Very well made and good quality . Will buy one more ❤️💃
5.0,"Love these! Small, brown with pocket. Going to order the capris for warmer weather."

5.0,Comfortable nice price
5.0,Super cute sneaks for my 1.5yo. Light weught and she loves wearing them. The image on the sneaker is clear and vibrant! Definitely happy with my purchase.
5.0,I received this discounted product in exchange for a review.<br /><br />This bag is great. I use it as a wallet in my large tote bag/purse and then when I am going out I can just grab it out of my bag and add one of the two strap options. No shuffling cards from one purse to another when you want to go out. It is really the perfect size. It also fits my phone which is a huge plus as well.
5.0,Exactly as advertised. Going to buy other colors
5.0,"Love it, so beautiful. My grand daughter will love this."
5.0,Great Product!  Great addition for my metal stamping!
5.0,"So great for cooling down both dry and wet. Really works well, feels icy"
5.0,"I use this pack every single day at work. I work in between hvac units quite a bit so it gets banged up, so far it has held together. The only issue I have is with the mouth piece cover. My first one fell off so I was forced to order and back up bladder just for the mouth piece."
5.0,As expected looks great
5.0,Daily belt works great!
5.0,Love it. Very comfy to wear.
5.0,Fits pretty true to size. I love this shirt
5.0,These boots are sooooo cute n comfy!!!! I wear a size 10...fit was as expected. Love em!!
5.0,Very cute chokers. Very pleased
5.0,Love this purse and the price
5.0,Purchased for a friend - she loved them.
5.0,I have a collection of different types of watches on display in my bedroom.  This one fits right in.
5.0,"Really pretty, fit very well, looks how I expected from the photos"
5.0,I really love these socks this is my second set of 3 if I can find some different colors or prints I will get more

5.0,My 21 year old daughter loved these for the beach this summer!
5.0,So cool. Hat fits just as expected and the design is flawless
5.0,I got these earpins and cuff for my daughter's birthday.  She loves them and wears them often. They are a decent quality for the price.
5.0,This is a great dress for the price. It is the perfect length for me (5'3).
5.0,Lots of complements when I wear
5.0,Had to return due to not being big enough.  However stayed with same manufacturer and purchased larger one.
5.0,The product was used during a celebration by zoom!  The other party was totally surprised and quite pleased!!
5.0,Runs slightly small but still wearable
5.0,"It fits just how the picture shows, fabric is nice quality. I definitely recommend 10 out of 10!"
5.0,Wearing it as I type
5.0,The item shipped faster than the expected date which was very nice. The item has a very long strap to it so it hangs a little deep. (I am about 6'1 and 185 so I'm not exactly small)Overall it is a nice item. The metal piece on it has a brushed look which is a touch duller than the actual picture looks. I think it is a great buy and I am very happy with it.
5.0,"I love the shirt ! It took 30 days to get this item! This blouse came from China , I hated the wait to get this item!"
5.0,"I had a similar type flip flop I wore out & it was the best I ever found so I hunted deep to find another similar type & this type is not easy to find but found these. I should have got a size bigger but this flip flop is just about as good as my old pair.<br /><br />The bottoms are firm but shock absorbing material & the strap isn't overly tight. The only thing I would have liked better is some texturing on the foot surface, they can be a bit slippery"
5.0,Love the length of the necklace. Its lightweight and looks really good.
5.0,"omg I love this dress<br />I got a large and it was perfect<br /><br />160lb, 5'5 and 41"" busr"
5.0,"First, I'm seeing reviews that people think these are too big or too small. You can order the size you want from 4-8 mm... I'm not sure if people just ordered blindly and didn't check the sizes or what, but it's irritating because I took their reviews into account before ordering and was concerned my order was not going to be accurately sized. I'm glad I decided move forward, because the 4mm set are some of, if not the cutest earrings I've purchased online. I love disco ball earrings but have 3 piercings on each side and the 8mm ones that have been so popular looked gaudy if I wore more than one pair. I love that I can wear three pairs at 4mm without them overwhelming everything else. I highly recommend them. If you pay attention to the sizing, you probably won't be disappointed."
5.0,Very comfortable. Love it.
5.0,"Absolutely love this sweatshirt. Big enough to pull my legs inside of, and very warm."
5.0,I absolutely adore these shoes! They look exactly as the picture and match the description perfectly. They appear to be TTS and since I'm an 8.5 I ordered up to a 9.
5.0,Been seeing pics of various bearded dragons in outfits and clothes so decided to give this hat a try...Everyone got a kick out of my super cool cowboy dragon...The orange is the best...
5.0,Fast shipping nice set of ear rings
5.0,"A year later and my son still loves this hoodie. It has held up incredibly well. Easy care. I would recommend this to anyone, male or female and would purchase another one."
5.0,Cute and too funny. I absolutely loved it.
5.0,warm and nice
5.0,"No more TV headaches! Or computer, too."
5.0,Great price! Looked adorable
5.0,This tiny little loupe has helped me ID rocks quickly.  It is light around my neck so it has gone on 2 field trips already
5.0,grand daughter liked it
5.0,good protection. perfect beach activities.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous! You can dress it up or tone it down. It fits well, it's comfotable and best of all- it has pockets!!"
5.0,Love these.  Very pretty and sparkly
5.0,Absolutely love this on my daughter. She can't wait to wear it to an event. We ordered it according to the size chart. Will buy another.  Worth the money.

5.0,Love this little sweater.. great to wear with sleeveless blouses for spring and summer.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet!
5.0,Cute! Great for summer.
5.0,"I had these for years, and then accidentally lost them, when I found them here I had to purchase another pair. They are great in the fall if you are outside and need to cover your hands. But they are even better when you are working out. When I first start out running I am using the full mitten, but if I'm getting hot the mitten folds over and its like a glove. The flap has a magnet on it, and there is another magnet that snaps it together. You don't have the tops flapping away while you are running. They are lightweight and perfect. There is another magnet at the bottom of the glove so you can keep them together which I find really useful when I'm trying to search for them in my bag. I use these all the time, I love how its also a glove, its extremely convenient for driving or raking. I love them!<br /><br />I would say my hands are medium and the gloves fit really well. There's a little extra room for me when I have the mitten pulled over and they gloves are not tight on my fingers. Its really comfortable and is not constricting.<br /><br />These are a must in my bag when it starts getting cool. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"
5.0,"Loved it,as cute in person as it is online!"
5.0,Looks profession
5.0,"I really like  the design. It is youthful, and unusual. I also like the size of the earrings, as they really make a  statement. The neutral black and white colors ensure that they can be worn with a variety of outfits, and not just for Valentine's Day."
5.0,These are super cute!!
5.0,Can't go wrong with your typical cold weather military cap lost mine this was a perfect replacement.
5.0,Nice and arrived on time!
5.0,Work to dinner
5.0,My niece loved the dress it is so cute and well done and the size was a little big but she will get alot of wear out of it.
5.0,"Matches my fossil q wander better than I expected! Really impressed, made a great addition to the band."
5.0,"Beautiful colors, fit is a little small but is okay!!"
5.0,"very comfortable and soft, they are a little big but I'm ok with that.color is true to the photo."
5.0,I love how the fabric looks and feels it's not a sweater  but love it
5.0,So beautifull
5.0,"I cannot tell you how absolutely THRILLED I am with the deep, gorgeous, forest green color!!! It took my breath away. I ordered another one right away, because I already know that I am going to wear this one out. Great price and a very sophisticated fit."
5.0,very nice for a little girl (I gave to a 7 yr old)
5.0,Ordered for my grand daughters braclet and she loves the little mermaid so that makes me happy that she is happy
5.0,I like how this hat fits...its a nice hat!  It doesn't floppy down in my eyes...and it looks great! Not all cheap
5.0,"This dress was EXACTLY what I needed. I work in a restaurant that requires us to wear nice-ish black clothes all year round, and I needed something that was short and breezy I could wear while working on the patio. This dress is great because I have a longer torso and short legs, and when I want to wear some short and flirty, I always end up with something that comes past my knees. I'm about 5'5&#34; or 5'6&#34; and 185 pounds and this dress stops a couple inches above my knees, but the fabric is heavy enough that it doesn't blow up around my waist or move too much with the wind. The pleats in the skirt are also very detailed and show really nicely even while wearing the dress.<br /><br />TRUE TO FIT and made of QUALITY cotton! Love it"
5.0,My grand son loved this yin/yang necklace!!!!  It is truly beautiful! It came in plenty of time for Christmas and was packaged well!
5.0,The skirt it's  super cute and very well made!! You can't go wrong with this adorable rainbow tutu!
5.0,Love the formality with this wire. Super Great performance.
5.0,Quality sans size were spot on
5.0,Delivery was fine. I thought it was another order. So I gave the wrong comment sorry if I caused a problem.
5.0,"It’s not see-thru, it’s just thick enough and shapes well. Comfortable fabric, stretchy"
5.0,"Flexible & can add holes, nice band. My wrist is just barely under 8 inches, even x long bands weren't long enough, but I found these, & they are long enough to add another hole, just put it where you want it with the pointed end of a tweezers, very easy, I dont like anything too tight, this is comfortable, I can move it around, but I put too many holes in it, I didnt need that many- shouldve tried it in btwn, so I weakened the very end & then when I lost the little belt loop thing I snagged it one too many times and it finally broke the end off- my fault tho. The watch itself is 1- 1/8 inch, so total length was abt 8 1/2in (till I broke it off) I still wear it everyday, very comfortable.<br />I ordered more of these watch bands bc I love the one I already had, they were on sale for $6, so I ordered multiple colors. But Amazon has lost my orders AGAIN! I ordered my first one directly from Speidel, it was worth paying a couple $ more, better company, I will reorder from them instead of thru Amazon.<br />The review is based on the one I already had, which I ordered directly from the company, BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED my new ones from Amazon<br />Bottom line, great watch band, I urge you to buy directly from Speidel, a few dollars more, but worth it!<br />Hope this review helps other ""big wristers"""
5.0,Love this dress; I was pleasantly surprised since this was my first clothing purchase from Amazon. I'm 5'8&#34; and 150 and ordered a medium
5.0,"Great price on a nice looking watch from a recognized, well regarded brand. I couldn't be happier with this purchase"
5.0,I love it!! It’s so comfy and fits so nice! I’m 156 pounds and I’m 5’4!! I recommend!!!
5.0,Order arrived promptly.  Sweet gift for my young granddaughter.
5.0,"Looks great on and got a lot of compliments, but doesn’t give an inch. Measure carefully"
5.0,"Good grips on the palms and fingers.  Excellent quality knit glove.  Washable.  Durable.  Be careful not to mix the green bones on these gloves with the white bones on the t-shirts and hoodies.  They clash.<br /><br />Product is exactly as described, or maybe better.  A fair price, with fast, efficient shipping, makes this product an excellent choice."
5.0,It's small and cute and the color is really nice. The wife seemed to like it. It's like a large sized wallet with a strap or a small purse with internal card pockets. Made well... Better be since it's a name brand.
5.0,Honestly is one size fits all. As you can see my niece is much smaller than me. I just hate that she lost it so now I need another one
5.0,Cute and fits snug if they have fat feet but that’s a good thing they won’t slip off.
5.0,"Love these PJ""s. Soft n Super Comfy"

5.0,"These are an essential in my gym bag!<br /><br />I dont have time to mess with the bar clips at the gym, they are constantly broken and or missing, adding these quick release clamps have saved me one to many times from resorting to those things."
5.0,it's Great should have gotten one sooner
5.0,Love! Great price and look!
5.0,"It's what I was looking for in a purse. Well-made, affordable, and roomy."

I have them in all my bike bags..BUT, they do scratch easy..so use the protective pouch."
5.0,"So adorable. My son was Tails for Halloween and it was so cute. This is a simple fleece cap with no stretch, so it does slip off the head a little bit, but the cuteness overload totally outweighs that."
5.0,My daughter absolutely love these earrings!
5.0,"My ? birthday present.  I received this as an b-day present, because this is as close to getting my ears pierced I'm going to get, until I am able to.  So happy birthday to ME"
5.0,I love the bold colors and they fit really good
5.0,Great looking hat and fits as expected.
5.0,"I want to buy more hats like this now! I'm so happy with this hat.  My head is about 22&#34; around.  The hat comes down to just above my eye brows which makes it perfect fit.  I have hair cut in a bob,  like cut to end of my jaw,  the combo with this hat to cute.. Especially when i wear my hair wavy."
5.0,"Very nicely made, fits very good"
5.0,I  wore this on a cruise and everyone thought it was wonderful. is boned so that you don't need to wear a bra- it is set up that way.
5.0,LOVE THIS BRA!! I can't believe that I bought a bra on line and it fit like it was made for me (and I have a hard time finding bras) I bought other colors! COMFY TOO!
5.0,Easy to size up.  Makes people smile/laugh.  I enjoy watching people smile and laugh.  Keeps face warm in the cold air.  peace.

5.0,It was the perfect size for my mom ! She felt comfortable while getting glammed up for my wedding
5.0,Seleccione una talla más a lo que acostumbro a usar. Y queda  bien como en la foto. La tela expande un poco.
5.0,Beautiful. gave as gifts
5.0,These are a must for medical professions! I’m on my feet for twelve hours at work and my feet and legs have thanked me for wearing these. They’re a good quality material too.
5.0,Fit my Wayfarers perfectly and look great
5.0,"Great value- you get two differently colored polarized lens add-on for your glasses. I always had to buy sunglasses of great design then spend extra money to change the lens to make it wearable for driving. With these, I don’t have to do that anymore. Those expensive brand fashion sunglasses can stay as they are, so I can still wear them even with my eye sight changes. These add on clips are my only driving sunglasses now.<br />These add ons are real polarized lens. If you wear them and look at your monitor from side angles, lights from the monitor screen really gets screened black (for black/dark brown lens) or yellow for light yellow lens. The light yellow lens one is great for rainy days with much reflection on lanes. Strongly recommended."
5.0,love the large size. fits everything I need to travel with
5.0,I like green more
5.0,"The seller shipped the necklace fast, and it got here early. Its very durable it has withstood being knocked around dropped and being in a hot shower like its still brand new.<br /><br />Edit: after a few months the necklace has begun to tarnish, so I will have to start cleaning it every few weeks."
5.0,Sweet little dress. Bought it for my 6 year old granddaughter. Fits nicely and is very soft. Launders nicely. Just hang up out of the dryer. Comes to right below the knee. She loves it.
5.0,The bright colors and long length make it for me. Its lightweight and sheerness both conceal and show off. I like to wear it as a coverall when I got to the pool or as a sexy house robe.
5.0,"I could not justify the price of the more expensive OOFOS and tried these instead. These are incredibly comfortable, have great arch support and are my go to summer shoe. They are not dressy by any means but I wear them pretty much for everything else!"
5.0,Love it! Fits perfectly and got it in time! Good quality
5.0,Love it. Wore it already.
5.0,"They shipped fast, look just like the pic and they even sent a free pair that I ended up giving to my sister, good stuff."
5.0,Nice shirt. Great fit.
5.0,"Lovely bag, purchased as gift and am sure the recipient will really enjoy using it. It's a color that really pops and will make a splash with any summer outfit."
5.0,"This order was just what I wanted,and received it on time."
5.0,Good looking. Nice leather band. Keep good time.
5.0,Purchased these shirts with upcoming Disney trip in mind.  Kids had other ideas and have been wearing them on a daily basis.  They came looking as pictured and have so far held up in the wash.  Sizing was as stated.  Bought this when the price dropped and would buy again if it gets back to that price.
5.0,"Yes, it's a tie clip and yes, it clips my tie. It's basic, inexpensive, and keeps my tie from going places it shouldn't (like in food or drinks) when I lean over or reach for something. Bought it for when I bartend now that they make us wear ties. The binder clip just looked a little tacky. Only used it a few times so far but seems well built and should last a while. The back part sticks out more than i though but it doesn't show and doesn't make any difference I can see. It won't change your world but it will hold your tie."
5.0,I love Fila tennis shoes. I have long narrow feet with high instep.  These fit perfectly
5.0,This item I received a discount.  It is very light weight but very durable an strong.  If you are looking for a visor that is quick and easy this is for you.  The color is bright and matches many outfits.  I'm so glad I got it.  It will get much use here in Florida.
5.0,"I was surprised to get the extra ones, tools on this carabiner seem very good"
5.0,"Great dress! I really adore this dress, perfect fit, creates a great wais/hip shape for those like me who lack the natural curves."
5.0,Very very surprised at the quality. Hands down best quality hoodie I have ever bought
5.0,"Fits in accordance with size chart.  Nice fabric, washes well."
5.0,Buy it Super Cute. True to size just Luv it
5.0,Great product.  My only warning is measure you hand. They fit a but smaller that what you maght wear. I were a XL but the XL was small on me. Have to order a new pair XXL.
5.0,"Casual, clean-cut looking, which is what I like."
5.0,"Model E belt - very pretty and seems well made. The beaded area is 30 inches. If your waist is more than 32 inches or if you like a looser/draped fit, it won't look right. 5 stars based on product itself not the fit."
5.0,Perfect. Exactly what I expected and what I wanted.
5.0,This shirt is so soft I wanted to keep it for myself. It fit great and the graphics is awesome. Did I mention it was SUPER soft.
5.0,This is a beautiful braclet especially with Swarovski Crystals!! I wear this all the time and get a lot of compliments and I like the fact it fits so well and I've had others in the past and not nearly as nice and beautiful as this! Thank you!!
5.0,Thought it would fit my 10 year old daughter but it’s to big
5.0,I'm very satisfied with this item!!! The quality is great and it looks wonderful on.<br /><br />Actually I was surprised beacuse I expected less!!<br /><br />Recommend!!!!
5.0,Was super easy to get on my Tennessee walker. My kids loved it.
5.0,Great little watch. I was using the Apple Watch before this and wanted something simpler that didn’t need a charge. Very happy
5.0,I use them for hand sanitizer. Bottles are a good size so you don’t have to be refilling often. Clips on easily onto a belt loop or a purse strap. I actually bought some for ER nurses and they really liked them.
5.0,wife loved it fits perfect and a light casual fit great robe
5.0,"Very comfortable, runs a little bit large"
5.0,Good quality and color
5.0,"Great price, and super cute! My daughter is walking and has very small feet; these fit well, while still having rubber bottoms which is hard to find in small sized shoes."
5.0,Fits as per size my kid wears 5-5.5 and fit well.
5.0,"Nice, nice, nice!!! I really love it, not that big, medium size, but just perfect. It's a beautiful bag. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,"Found them for a great price, so I'm very pleased!"
5.0,Had this shirt for a year or two. I hang it to dry & it looks as good as new.
5.0,Lian LifeStyle Boy and Girl 1 Pair Knee High Sports Socks for Baseball/Soccer<br />Nice soccer socks; I bought it for my 5 year old son. He stared to practice in little team and they fit perfectly and look nice on him
5.0,Very good for Halloween costume.
5.0,This dress is cute and comfortable.  It’s flattering even though is very flowy.  The material is very soft.
5.0,It's great. Who doesn't love Jack Skellington?
5.0,Very nice looking items.  They don't look cheap.
5.0,wore this for Halloween with my sailor moon outfit was a cute accessory to wear love them very much. i wear them from time to time again just to go out.
5.0,Beautiful design.  My granddaughter seems to love the bright colors of the flowers.
5.0,"I had this chain for 4 years with absolutely no problems. The only reason I have to repurchase is that I lost it. I loved that it was available in such a short length (15in), as I don't like long dangly necklaces. It was beautiful, sturdy even though delicate, and an unbeatable price. I hope the quality hasn't diminished in the past few years."
5.0,"Super nice, comfy.  I have small wrists, but it still fits well."
5.0,My hubby loved it !!
5.0,"It was as advertised....good looking, sturdy, and simple to put on."
5.0,"My grandson loves this jacket!  It's a light weight sweatshirt jacket that s nice for cool weather.  The mesh front of the hood is fun as a mask for playing ""Star Wars."""
5.0,The legend of the West Virginia Mothman was alive and well this Halloween with this cape.
5.0,"The one thing I was wondering about before I ordered this was where the vibrating mechanism is.  Unfortunately the part that vibrates is in the bulb where you hold it, so not nearly enough vibration gets to where it needs to be.  The vibrator just isn't strong enough to overcome the distance limitation.  So once it's inserted, I really didn't feel much vibration.  Half a star off for that.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had pulsing patterns on it.  That still didn't make up for the lack of power where it counts.<br /><br />I went with the large size, which is supposedly just a little bit bigger than a 20FR catheter.  It felt more like a 24FR to me, but I didn't go grab my micrometer to measure it.  Basically don't get the large unless you're sure.  The smaller size (according to the listing) would be just shy of a 16FR which is a good all-around size.  Unlike a catheter though, there are no eyelets to tear up your innards, so you can get away with a larger size then you otherwise would.<br /><br />The finish on this is that silky velvet-feeling finish that you see on a lot of toys these days.  Be aware that it's not smooth like metal or plastic -- it does have some resistance to it.  (Also it likely collects bacteria worse.)  Personally I think the finish was a poor choice for its intended use, but it does give it a quality look/feel.  If you're into this kind of thing and want the ultimate in smooth insertion, get yourself a [[ASIN:B01MTM084B Hegar sound set]], although they don't vibrate.<br /><br />Oh and if you're making a shopping list, better pick up a restraint kit while you're at it.  If you're going to use this on your boyfriend/girlfriend, you will need to tie them down first.  Securely.<br /><br />This is powered by a single AAA battery, and an inexpensive carbon zinc one is included.  I think my battery cap had some intermittent issues, because several times when I tried to turn it on it would just briefly hum and then quit.  Reinstalling the battery cap seemed to solve that.  If you're confused about how to turn it off, you hold down the power button for several seconds.<br /><br />I think this is definitely worth the nominal price they're asking for it.  I always say to myself I've got every adult toy known to man, and then the sellers at Amazon keep coming up with more stuff for me to buy.  That's a good thing.<br /><br />That's the end of the review.  What follows is just a couple usage tips that I'll pass on after 20+ years of doing this stuff:<br /><br />1. Sterilize the toy before each use.  Rubbing alcohol will likely do if that's all you've got.  Soap and water won't necessarily cut it.  Definitely wash it when you first get it:  The stuff that comes out of these Chinese factories can be quite nasty even when it looks perfectly clean.  I've gotten rashes from residue on brand new anal plugs and I'd definitely not want anything like that inside my urethra.  If you're on well water, definitely don't use this near water nor after washing it with water alone.  If the creepy-crawlies in your well water make it into your naughty bits, you may feel like you're going to die for a couple days.  Ask me how I know.<br /><br />2. Drink lots of water beforehand, and save plenty of urine in your bladder for afterwards.  The idea is to urinate right after you remove the device.  It might sting like hell, but just put up with it.  If you don't do this, you might have to put up with that awful stinging sensation for several days."
5.0,For grandsons new car. His favorite soccer team
5.0,LOVE them. Order more today 4 stocking stuffers.
5.0,"Yes there is a smell, I believe it is a chemical treatment<br />that was applied to the bag, this smell does not last long<br />other than that, this is a simple plan bag that is worth<br />buying and very nice to have."
5.0,super comfortable and looks great ! I wore it to church for Easter services
5.0,"Love these earrings! Beautiful, small & delicate. :)"
5.0,Ordered this boot on prime day. It was delivered one day later and I was stunned at the beauty. It looked good on line but in person its ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! The contrasting green makes the boot stunning and a standout.<br /><br />I have a high instep and felt no pain on the top portion of my foot. I slid the boot on with no socks and it was an easy fit. Order true to size as you have a little wiggle room but not enough to flop on the foot. It feels good and sturdy on the foot. Worth every penny!
5.0,"I finally, found a nursing bra that fits perfectly. It is easy to unclip and it lays flat to nurse your baby. I bought a 38c which is my bra size. They do fit as expected."
5.0,Good quality and fits well.
5.0,My daughter loves this ring. We bought it as a purity ring and it is sweet and beautiful especially for an inexpensive choice.
5.0,WORKS
5.0,"I am obsessed with this shirt. The quality is absolutely great and they are gildan t shirts, so they do not shrink. It is my new favorite t shirt and will most definitely purchase more from this seller."
5.0,Fit and looks exactly as pictured.  Nice quality
5.0,Nice glass bottles for my cleaning solution needs.  Good shipper and price is reasonable.
5.0,"Got this for my Son.. he hasn't seen it yet, cause it's for Christmas, but I have to say ( I know he will love it)!!"
5.0,Ohhh these are not only flattering with their tummy tucking but I love the mesh inserts on the sides of the calves. The material is smooth and has some compression but not too much. These are now my favorite yoga or workout pants. Super happy with these and would recommend to others.
5.0,"It was wrinkle , very wrinkle but the fit was perfect , the price was very affordable"
5.0,My daughter like it.Fits Perfect.
5.0,"Great leggings. Soft,fit very well. Nice color. Recommended"
5.0,"I generally don't wear fancy, expensive underwear, so take my review with that in mind. That said, don't discount what I have to say too much! These underwear are comfortable as hell, which is nice, as when I'm not at work or outside, I'm in my skivvies.<br /><br />The material is soft, and the stitch seems strong and well done. The colors are vibrant and bright. The elastic band doesn't irritate. It's like a teddy bear hugging your waist! (That's my attempt at humor. Seriously though, these are comfortable.)<br /><br />For the price, you can't beat the deal! The one note I would add is that upon first opening the package, these things smelled so much like new fabric and dyes that I had to immediately wash them before I could wear them. Just toss them into the wash really quick, and you'll be okay! (I have sensitive skin, and one wash was just fine.)<br /><br />Great buy! I will buy again / recommend!"
5.0,the only problem was the chain was a little small for me but I put it on a larger military chain and am wearing it now.
5.0,Buena calidad.
5.0,Luv her in dots.
5.0,Very happy. Very soft. Works perfectly
5.0,"This was perfect for my niece's baptism! It fit her very nicely and it looked so sweet! Perfect for an infant, but it is small."
5.0,"They work great, the durability and quality is worth the money"
5.0,Hat is well constructed.  Nice big pom on top.  You can’t go wrong buying this hat.
5.0,"Simple is the best!<br />38mm Milspec, auto move, swiss made..."
5.0,Nice what I was looking for
5.0,Great Fit & Quality!! Love the color!!!!!!!
5.0,This scarf was a bit more pricey than the ones that I usually buy and it also took longer to arrive.  But it is definitely worth both the price and the wait.  It is gorgeous with all of my favorite colors!!
5.0,"I am a woman and I don't like women's fit in sportswear, the contouring is always too skin tight for me, so I was looking for something unisex. I usually wear a Small in unisex clothing. Not sure if this hoodie is meant to be unisex or men's, but I originally ordered a Small and it was too big. For reference, I am 5'9&#34; and about 130lbs. Ended up ordering an XS to see if that would fit better and it did! Sleeves/torso are still long enough for me and material is super soft. Love the design. No frays or hanging strings in the embroidery. Great quality! #GoCubbies"
5.0,These are very comfortable safety glasses and they stay on your face. Two very important traits for a product like this. I also like the fact that they are more stylish than the standard ones available.
5.0,My granddaughter LOVED this!  Just as expected.  Great quality.
5.0,"This is a light fabric, perfect for summer!  I LOVE the pockets!  It just came in, and I have not washed it yet.  If I have problems I will edit my review.  Love the fit!"
5.0,"These belts will improve your life you wear casual pants that have belt loops, and are a bit too big at the waist. They improve the fit, and comfort .Also you will like how easy it is too leave them on pants you wear several times before washing-like jeans. Your pants will stay at your waist. You don't need to struggle with buckles either."
5.0,I like this type belt over the regular old style belts
5.0,Soft and comfortable for those cold and windy days!  Can't recommend enough.
5.0,I absolutely love these undershirts! They are soft and did not shrink when washed and dried! They have lasted almost a year with no tears or rips! My daughter finds them more comfortable than any of her other undershirts! I am very pleased with the quality and fit!
5.0,Really like the purchase
5.0,"Bought these for underclothes for the snow, worked great! Got my size and they fit on the tighter side (which is what I wanted), and kept me very warm!"
5.0,I used these for my students. They worked great and were a great value for the price.
5.0,"I chose the wrong size for myself, but my friends liked them. Thank you for your wonderful service. Sincerely, Elaine."
5.0,I love this dress! Great dress and quality for the price! It is super super cute.
5.0,This is a great item for the price.  Very well made.
5.0,Have been using this wallet for over three month and I love it! Was a litttle concerned about the magnet after reading some reviews but have had zero issues with it. I would definitly recommend this wallet!
5.0,Cute dress with an adorable pattern that can be dressed up or down. The quality of the fabric exceeded my expectations and feels like a more expensive dress than it was! I’m generally a size medium and ordered a medium and it fit Perfectly. If you’re in between sizes order down as the dress does allow for some wiggle room. Would order again!!
5.0,Love these! Comfy sexy & hides the gut well!
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! I wore to a blue diamond gala...stunning! One can easily dress up or down depending on engagement.  I wore 3 inch heels; the length was perfect (preferred longer length for the look I wanted to achieve). I received a lot of compliments and if asked where I purchased...they were shocked. Most of all one cannot beat the price for an elegant dress. I ordered large (curvy girl 😊) very catering. The reviews are correct, if I could give more stars I would! Definitely worth the buy!"
5.0,My son loves the fit. Very Nice looking too.
5.0,Super cute and comfy! The straps are super super stretchy so the fit was perfect :)  looked awesome with my costume
5.0,Light and soft on the skin. Good material
5.0,I wore this to a wedding and it was beautiful
5.0,"Es una prenda muy cómoda, ligera y entallada. Me gusto mucho por que mantiene  mi torso templado pero a la vez estoy fresca. Me encanto!"
5.0,Better quality than I expected!!!  Thank you!
5.0,Only used these for the first time but i was very impressed with the quality and how well they helped keep my clothes wrinkle free especially when flying we all know how that works i would recommend these to anyone who is looking to save space or to keep you clothes organized when traveling.
5.0,Good quality.  Better then expected.
5.0,Perfect for a very small 12 yr old girl
5.0,"Great value for the price, and just the size I needed for my 24-inch bistro table."
5.0,Great perfect fit
5.0,Great jacket! Well made!! Durable and very colorful!
5.0,"! It’s beautiful, functional and easy to put on your Apple Watch."
5.0,I've worn these boots several times since I bought and they have held up so far. They were also comfortable and not too tight like I was afraid they would be since I do have wide feet. Will purchase another pair and I do recommend them.
5.0,Looks a lot better then the picture and is really cute. Arrived earlier then expected which also is a plus
5.0,"Very chic, fits well and protects well; I  go everywhere with it!"
5.0,"I’m 5-2 and 175 lb, the XL were perfect for me. Holds stomach in but very,comfortable. Pockets are great to hold keys and phone."
5.0,"Estoy muy contenta, es un hermoso brazalete, luce como en la foto. Considero que es de muy buena calidad."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! This key chain is easy to use and so convenient! 10/10 would buy again!
5.0,"Good quality, great dress!"
5.0,"good design, does not roll or bind at the top"
5.0,Fit as expect got a size XL I'm 6'1 and it is not super long has a good look to it.
5.0,"This is properly constructed sun helmet having features lacking in cheap versions.  The headband is fabric-covered, and properly spaced from the sides of the helmet for good ventilation.  In addition, unlike cheap sun helmets, this helmet has crown straps.  These are straps that extend upward from the headband over the top of the head and ensure that the crown of your head will not contact the inner surface of the helmet.  This, too, promotes proper ventilation.<br /><br />The entire helmet is covered in attractive khaki fabric.  The core is apparently some kind of ""tree bark"" (cork? something else?), and total weight according to my postal scale is ~8.5 ounces, which is a tad lighter than a USGI WWII sun helmet. Anyway, it's light enough so you don't notice it.<br /><br />I live in Arizona and regularly hike in temperatures well above 100 degrees, and under such conditions a baseball cap or fabric bush hat is almost worse than no hat at all for keeping your head cool, assuming you have a full head of hair anyway.  A sun helmet such as this, on the other hand, has a very noticeable effect."
5.0,Best tote for beach ever! Large (can hold a baby if needed lol) lots of towels- pockets galore in inside!
5.0,Good product at good price.
5.0,"Winter’s coming and it’s time to stock up on winter gear. These are men’s thinsulate gloves size small. Wool on the outside, thinsulate on the inside. Warm, cozy, stretchy, ready for use. Comfortable, warm, flat and fit well into pockets. These cover the wrists and could also be worn by women. Perfect."
5.0,These are adorable
5.0,I have bought about 4 of these for my watches because I have large wrists and these leather bands are great. I will always go to these if I need another. They are very comfortable and there are about 2-3 colors I believe.
5.0,Good gag goft
5.0,Love my kitty pajamas!
5.0,My boyfriend loved it and it fit him perfectly !  Size large
5.0,"Birthday gift for middle school boy who wants to be in band at A&M . Gave him socks, t shirt and cap . He loved them all"
5.0,Love them. Online boutiques are selling them for $30+ and I got them for $12. Cant beat that!
5.0,Very cute! Also fits true to size!
5.0,Everyone loves my bag including me
5.0,"I was searching for house shoes that would be comfortable and ease my plantar fasciitis and heel pain.  I have only had these shoes for about a month but they have been amazing.  I cannot wait to put them on at night when I get home from work.  I am a runner and I wanted to have a house shoe that helped me recover while I was at home relaxing.  These shoes have been great!  I think everyone always thinks about the importance of having good running shoes but I can attest that having good house shoes and work shoes makes all the difference.  I was also very concerned about the price for these shoes.  All I can say is you get what you pay for.  If you have no foot issues and budget is your only driver, Wal-Mart slippers it is.  Of course you have to be prepared to replace them at least every year.  If you have foot issues, care about the best fit and comfort you can get in a house shoe AND you have the budget....get these shoes!!!"
5.0,I like the fact that you can have both sets of glasses close at hand
5.0,Perfectly
5.0,These are very lovely earrings. They came in a very pretty red earring box that was inside a small red protective cardboard box. This was wrapped in red tissue.  Classy. Papers about the company and how to care for jewelry were separately included. They arrived quickly.
5.0,"Really like it. Plenty of slots. Nice leather on outside, Well made. I already got a compliment on it. And I know my cards are safe from scanning. Very happy with purchase. May order a slim leather wallet to hold money, from same people."
5.0,This shirt is perfect!! Material is soft and fit is just like the pic. I always order a small and this fits like all my other clothes. Going to order another before they sell out.
5.0,Una amiga me regalo un par de lentes. Y me gustaron mucho que decidí compralos
5.0,love this item fits perfect hugs every curve the way it should
5.0,Perfect. Totally my style and the studs earrings don't brake easily.
5.0,"I love this. It is absolutely perfect. The white is more of a cream so I'll adjust my outfit accordingly. The material is a little wrinkly when it arrives but I also think this will change as it hangs out. If not, i think a low heat iron will be able to iron it out. Much better than expected."
5.0,Love the design my son is 2 years old and I got him a size 5..fits a little lose but I rather him have some room.
5.0,The shorts are very short if you have a fuller figure! I would have liked them better in a longer length.
5.0,"Fits great and looks great, I might buy another for a gift but this one is all mine."
5.0,Quality for sure !
5.0,"These worked great for my twins on the Autism Spectrum.  We went to a party that had a DJ that my son would have in the past want to stay in the hallway. This time with the earmuffs on he enjoyed himself and danced.  They fit well on the kids head, stayed on, and was comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them. I also love the case and they fit nicely in my purse."
5.0,"I can’t say enough about how perfect this shirt is for post shoulder surgery. With snaps on both sides, it works for either shoulder. I had rotator cuff and bicep repair, this is my uniform for therapy. Easy access to shoulder and armpit without having to remove shirt. Easy to put on and take off. I ordered a size up so that it would be loose. Hospitals and doctors should recommend to patients. I found it doing a search in Amazon. Highly recommend!"
5.0,I have been looking for sunglasses like this for a while.They are very easy to find but the size is what's hard.Unfortunately my face doesn't fit well with all sunglasses.Figured I would purchase these since they are considered &#34;Oversize&#34; .Believe me they are nicely oversized.Very cool.Thanks again.I will definitely be purchasing the same ones in other colors.
5.0,Great and love it.
5.0,These are just like my lulu aligns!!!!!
5.0,These pajamas fit as expected and are super comfy. The fabric is good quality and washes well. Can be worn as lounge wear or pajamas. I’m thinking of getting t another pair.
5.0,Love the coat. Somewhat small in the arm pit.
5.0,I really loved this. Looks great in casual and formal clothes. Doesn’t look cheap 👍
5.0,"Fits great. Very cool and comfortable, my son loves them"
5.0,"I'll admit, this was a little bigger than I expected, but it's a very pretty piece. It's not too much or anything, the picture just gave me the impression it was a little smaller. It's a little heavier then I expected but like I said, how pretty and sparkly it is makes up for it. It's a perfect set for a nice black dress or for a dress with a little bling. I'm overall pleased with my purchase, will buy from this seller again!"
5.0,Great graphic.
5.0,I loved it but it fell down the drain when I was washing my face. so maybe that's a warning to be careful when wiping or rubbing your face
5.0,Hat fits very light and comfortable. I live in Central Florida and it's not too hot to wear
5.0,I’ve been going through a tye dye craze and i love this hoodie sweatshirt . good fit .. vibrant colors
5.0,"This is just as you'd expect my only concern is that the fabric feels cheap, so take that into consideration when buying"
5.0,Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves them!
5.0,"These wedges are very comfortable.  I purchased for vacation as a 'wear with all' outfits shoe.  Days of walking or nights out, they remained comfortable with no rubbing or hot spots.  The woven straps are soft and not scratchy or irritating.  Very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,beautiful comfortable love this!!! good quality!!
5.0,"These suits are PERFECT! Nice soft, but durable material. Detailed print. Nice coverage."
5.0,"I was having problems keeping my feet warm during yoga classes. These socks are the perfect answer, the open toes allow me to keep my balance and together with the sticky pad on the bottoms, I can hold poses with very little variation from bare foot.<br /><br />They are sized perfect for me ... and while I have very small feet - size four .... they work for me but I'm sure they'd stretch to fit about a size six before they'd be too small. I was concerned about the feel of them between the toes but they are such a small grade of yarn that the feel great and stay put once applied."
5.0,offly big box 📦 for such a teeny tiny purse...

5.0,Great Hat! Great Fan of Challenger Hellcats.Thanks.
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this! I seriously have people stopping me in the street to ask where I bought it. The colors are so bright and vibrant. Just know that it is 100% polyester (not an issue for me but it may be for people who prefer the breathability of natural fabrics, or don't like the bathing suit feel in a shirt). It is not fitted either, but not all my shirts need to be tight/boobablicious so I don't mind."
5.0,"They are a cute pair of ear rings and they are not your normal &#34;poke it through the whole&#34; ear rings, which I love.  When I received the set, one did not open properly. I contacted Chicinside and they replaced it. Nice product and good seller."
5.0,Super comfy. Doesn't really shrink. Just like the pic! My typically-sized 7yo fits a medium well.
5.0,Loved this dress. The material is soft but sturdy (REMEMBER TO HAND WASH PEOPLE).  I have never been disappointed with this brand

5.0,This dress fit well. I was surprised it fit as well as it did. The material was awesome.
5.0,Very well-made shirt compared to other online brands. The quality was much better and had a nice thick feel About it. Buttonholes were perfect which is unusual these days. Loved the shirt and really did not want to send it back but it was slightly tight at the chest area. However I would certainly buy from this company again as I was very very impressed.
5.0,"I really like it,  fit perfect and is very comfortable. Great product for the price."

5.0,Just as described. Excellent value for the price. Stones just ok. Holds up great to frequent hand washing.

5.0,"just received it and absolutely LOVE it!!! only complaint was that it was very wrinkled...quick ironing fixed that!<br />I'm 5'10' and 128# ..the small fit perfectly.  often the waist is too high for me in a smaller size, but this is perfect.  Wanted a raincoat that actually covered a dress and my knees.  this one is PERFECT!!  Well made and good color."
5.0,Great mask- well-made and very attractive!
5.0,I love this item and I am wearing it in a daily basis.
5.0,"These are so soft and my girls love them, but they are sized for an adult and are big on my 5 and 6 year olds."
5.0,Love these socks ... They make your legs feel so good after working 12 or more hours a day
5.0,Aside from running 2 sizes smaller it's a beautiful dress.
5.0,The top pieces don't stay on all that well so have to adjust a few times is a bit annoying but other than that it's a great costume
5.0,Absolutely loved this gift for my mom. My mom loved her gift.  Better quality than I expected especially because it was so readonably priced. Would definitely purchase from this merchant again. I was very pleased with my purchase.

5.0,These socks are amazing!  Husband wears a size 10 shoe and we got XL socks and they fit perfect.  He loves them.  Feet stay dry and socks stay up.  High recommend these socks!

5.0,"I love love these boots!! I normally wear a size 9 but purchased a size 10, and they fit just right. Warning though, I did need help putting on and removing these babies. Once on they looked great and fit well over my knee."
5.0,My granddaughter LOVES her Minnie swimsuit! I would 100% recommend.
5.0,Finished
5.0,"High quality wallet, holds travel essentials, room for credit card.  Be careful not to take it out in view of thieves.  The wallet looks very expensive and the thieves might think you are really rich having a wallet that nice."
5.0,"good hood, will work great for winter wear"
5.0,This cap is bad to the bone! Got it for my son and he loves it! Very good quality and the embroidery is awesome! Great fit.

5.0,I pur based this as a replacement for a baby ring my grandmother had made for me when I was born. It is very lovely and classy. I especialy like the diamond accents on the sides and above the crown
5.0,My 16 year old daughters favorite leggings. They hold up well and come out of washer and dryer almost wrinkle free.
5.0,"I was looking for something for my brother in law, and this was it!! he's a medium size guy (150) and it fit over his head fine"

5.0,I love this dress I want to buy some more
5.0,"Bought this for my Dad. He has a big head and I bought him a large, I thought it'd be too small after it came but when he put it on, it fit perfectly. It looks really nice and he tells me it's really warm. Great for this crazy weather we're having in NYC!"
5.0,Beautiful and just what I wanted
5.0,"Really cute. Could use a little tummy control in the bottoms. For the price, it's a good deal! Fit as expected."
5.0,Lovely stone with many facets that reflect the light beautifully.
5.0,"This was much better quality than expected! It definitely runs large, I’d size up one size from your usual I’d you want it baggy. I went two sizes up, and it was a little larger than I wanted."
5.0,"These were a gift for Father's Day, my husband loves them! He works with wood and appreciates it, so he love gifts like this. He knew immediately what type of wood it was, fit him perfectly, he loved them."

5.0,Love it looks great !
5.0,"Love these bands. The colors are beautiful and they are very affordable. I love that they don’t slide down, they stay in place the whole time."
5.0,Super cute rings that fit nicely and look great too. So far they still look great and haven't turned my fingers green or anything. Love wearing them.
5.0,"This skirt, quite unfortunately, does not fit me. That, however, does not detract from the quality or the fit of the product; I intend to give this to a friend. Had this skirt fit me, I can assure you that it would have been a regular staple in my closet. The stretchy waistband allows for versatility and those extra inches for when you put on a few extra pounds during the holidays. The strong red color was a definite plus as I aim to be flashy with my clothing. The fit and flare was a nice touch as well as it helps me look girly to attract all the men folk. This was a win win and will be a great gift to the lady friend I will entrust it."
5.0,"I used the Cocoon glove liners in Greenland and Antarctica and they were real life-savers. I wore them under Gore-Tex or heavy fleece gloves, and these came off my right hand when I was photographing (there's no way you can manipulate buttons and dials if you can't feel where your fingers are!). These liners didn't affect my sense of touch, but my hand remained warm while I was busy taking photos. My left hand, whose purpose was basically to steady the camera and set lens zoom, was always toasty with the liners + heavy gloves.<br /><br />The one thing against these gloves, and, I'm sure, against any silk liner, is that they love velcro... They get caught in any piece of velcro on your clothes or your camera bag, and after a while don't look so good anymore. However, as long as their performance remains unaffected, I don't really care.<br /><br />When you're out in freezing temperatures, with a stiff wind making it all worse, the Cocoon glove liners can be invaluable. Especially if you don't want to miss a photo op!"
5.0,"genuine leather, nice bag right fit for regular 9,7 ipad"
5.0,Love this hat!
5.0,"Shipped quickly, fit perfectly, already can feel the difference in my feet! I like these much better than full foot insoles I've tried and the fact that they are easily washable is great."
5.0,This set is wonderful. It is so fashionable. It fits well as expected. It is of good quality as well. I recommend the pink color that is so nice
5.0,my MASH fanatic Army husband love it!!!!!
5.0,Excellent value for the price.
5.0,For 20 bucks they are great
5.0,Love this t-shirt
5.0,mmmmmm...
5.0,"love, love, love ot"
5.0,I really live this necklace. I wore it all the time and yet it look so beautiful everytime i try it on.
5.0,THIS MASK FITS VERY WELL AND I FEEL DOES A GREAT JOB IN PROTECTING THE WEARER
5.0,"Used this on a trip that had to keep belongings on my person. It unzips around the sides to add more things to the purse. I sprayed it with waterproof spray as it was used during a trip that I knew it would rain, and it held up great. I was able to put my cell phone in it as well as wallet that I purchased,  &#34; Lackingone RFID Wallet For Women&#34; and it fit perfectly.  Great value for a very busy trip."
5.0,This shoe is so comfortable it’s an every day where. Highly recommended. I’ve only had them for two weeks and so far I know I want the red. The grip on the bottom is amazing as well
5.0,Amazing and as expected.
5.0,"I will be rocking this festive kimono this 4th. It is light weight and pretty. I do wish it was a bit longer though, as I am a tall woman."
5.0,"Super compression pants! I love these so much! I’m 5’5”, athletic, and usually 145 but this quarantine has me plumped up a little 😫! The medium fits super snug! Almost squat test approved, but you can see a little outline through them."
5.0,So cute and stylish cant wait to wear it for my trip
5.0,Really nice material.  My son loves it.
5.0,"the top is perfect and great, the bottom part is kind of small"
5.0,"I bought this hat to wear to the Kentucky Derby. I am not a fan of things on my head so this was just what I needed. You can't tell by the picture, but this hat comes with a headband to hold it in place (guess I should have read the description more carefully). I removed that part promptly and glued the comb directly to the hat. I pulled a section of my hair back with a clip and stuck the comb under the clip. It stayed in place all day and was comfortable. Would definitely recommend even though I made a few adjustments."
5.0,It seems pretty sturdy and has already survived a severe thunderstorm.  I like that you can put yourself completely under it and still see through it.
5.0,Purchased for my husband. Fits really well
5.0,granddaughters love them
5.0,Perfect for him and her! They fit perfectly as well
5.0,"Purchased this dress for a company holiday party. This was my first Miusol purchase and I was very surprised by the quality for the price. It's very well made and looks exactly like the picture. The cut of the dress is very flattering. I'm 5'5&#34; and about 135 lbs. It does just past my knees which I love, so it's the perfect length to me. I was so happy with the dress that I ordered another Miusol dress for work/date nights."
5.0,Great replacement buckle. Quality construction. Great price.  Only issue I had was it was too big for my project
5.0,Nice wool blanket as the way it should be!
5.0,Good shoe!
5.0,Love this skirt. I wore it with a denim wrap blouse. I received a lot of compliments.
5.0,Love the lightweight and style for my face. Enjoy the value for money on this purchase since these are polarized lenses.
5.0,The bar is very good quality and the color was good. The 2 inch bar was longer than expected but that’s on me for not measuring. Overall 10/10 would recommend.
5.0,They are great! I would buy them again.
5.0,I followed another reviewer's advice to order a size down from measurements listed on fit chart. These are PERFECT! Comfort and colors are great. Also no fading or shrinking from washing and drying. Very happy.
5.0,Very cute warm hat
5.0,It was easy to install on my gear 3 and it looks very elegant on my arm I am totally satisfied with a product and will be purchasing more...
5.0,"LOVE the design, I have received so many compliments on this watch band. I have a small wrist so I had to take some links out and there were no instructions so it took a little longer but overall would recommend!"
5.0,I don't know now I haven't been home...
5.0,"this necklace is beautiful, I received a lot of compliments"
5.0,Lightweight but doesn't restrict. You will have to purchase another product if you want to suck in and smooth your fat.
5.0,"This is a very light-weight fabric (I use as lounge wear at home), high quality, well made pants. After reading reviews about the difference from US sizing, I did order up in size.  I am very pleased with this re-order, my second pair, and yes, will probably order more in the future."
5.0,this is very good made
5.0,These were just what was needed.
5.0,"Needed a little something for office costume event via Zoom. As I am an avid Marvel fangirl, I chose the ever interesting, but horrifyingly evil Thanos.  Large on me and couldn't wear for long due to probable suffocation, but it worked."
5.0,"Got these for my niece and she was positively delighted. She's a fiery redhead just like Merida, and these were a gift included with a bow I also got her. The reaction was worth it."
5.0,The bag is very sturdy and my go-to bag for groceries and Sam's Club. I prefer this bag over the mesh type bags for carrying glass jars and more fragile items because they don't clank together while carrying. I love that it is collapsible! Definitely saves save in the trunk and I can fit all my other bags inside of this bag. Would recommend!
5.0,Love them!  I recently had foot surgery. Plate and 9 screws put in. Needed compression socks to help with swelling. They are perfect and cute!
5.0,I use this under my motor cycle helmet and it works great. keeps my head and face warm when it is cold out.
5.0,These are just the right length and fit for layering which is why I bought them.  Hoping they will last overtime.
5.0,"I ordered the 30"" silver necklace. It is well worth the money. I receive lots of compliments each time I wear it.  It was exactly as described and shipped very fast!"
5.0,I bought this band for my iwatch for my colors. I like the light gray color of this band. Its soft and comfortable when worn. It doesn’t irritate my skin. Feels just like the original band that came with my watch.
5.0,Great color and fit.
5.0,I bought them as a gift but they were exactly as expected and described.
5.0,"Finally, I found a mask I can wear with my glasses. This mask has a nice shape - flat with an indent for your nose. It has some stiffness but will flex a bit when you put it on, so I'm sure it will be comfortable for a long period of wear. The eye holes are plenty large and I can wear it over my glasses (you can't wear glasses over it). I tried it with a couple styles of glasses, and it helps if you wear a pair with a slight ""cat eye"" tilt up on the sides that goes with the lines of the eye openings. I have a large head and, even putting it on over glasses, there is plenty of length to tie the ribbons in the back. I can't wait to wear it to the masquerade ball I'm attending."
5.0,I love these! I really love the designs as they go well with my style and they are pretty useful as I am known to lose my glasses
5.0,It's a little longer than I thought but it's very pretty. I've only worn it twice so we will see if it holds up!
5.0,Amazing quality. Adorable as ever!!

5.0,These glasses perform well
5.0,Item was perfect
5.0,My 11 year old love these pants. He wears them to school and on the weekends. They were was a great find.
5.0,"Looks adorable, works well on formals and vintage/retro looks, quality was good product was sturdy. But it's smaller than I anticipated. About an inch or slightly more in length."
5.0,"I wear them to sleep to keep my hair out of my face, I wear them to do yoga... Whatever, so comfortable and cute."
5.0,"I wear a size 10 ladies shoe, so socks can sometimes be too small.  These socks were just what I was looking for.  They stretch enough to fit my feet well, they don't bind if I sleep with them on, and they have done well in the washer/dryer.<br /><br />After having the first 2 pack for more than a month, I discovered I wear them around the house more than I wear my slippers.  So, I ordered another pack and I am pleased to have them."
5.0,I was very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE these packing cubes! The different sizes were wonderfully versatile. I'd read another reviewer who said the small pouches were really useful for small misc. items and I *absolutely agree*. Using packing cubes when traveling will change the way you travel for the better; and this set was wonderful. I traveled to a cold climate where I needed sweaters, jeans, and the like, and the largest cube was the best for that. Realistically, the two medium sizes and the small size were the most useful and easiest to pack. Small cubes still hold plenty (the smallest held a week's worth of socks and underwear), but make it extremely easy to re-organize your suitcase as-needed. Having the cubes also made it really easy to plan outfits and pull out only what is needed -- and even if you pull out all the cubes, they're super easy to repack into the suitcase once you have what you need from the cube you're looking for.<br />The color is great, I love purple though I'm sure they have other colors too. The mesh makes it easy to see what's in each cube without having to unpack them. Also, the dual zippers make getting what you need easy (some cubes out there only have one zipper, and having used a cube like that I can't recommend it!). If you're really looking for packing cubes stop reading and order these, you won't regret it."
5.0,Bought for my 3 and 6 year old girls.  They love these shoes and they fit well.
5.0,Very dainty and super lovely and pairs well with my other bracelet!
5.0,It's adorable and great quality!!
5.0,"Took a chance and I'm very pleased. I wanted a jacket I could use for running on early cold mornings with reflection that would keep me warm.  At 5'8 with a 44"" chest, I ordered a XL. A little longer than expected, but works well bc it covers my butt when running and when in rain, it runs off past my legs. Definitely worth the price and risk. Came earlier than expected as well, so changed to 5-star."
5.0,Above and beyond expectations
5.0,Looks great. Shipped from international... keep that in mind
5.0,Really happy with the fit and quality of the the hat. It was a good buy.

5.0,"I lost one of these and am so happy that I was able to find another, in fact, I ordered two.  Unfortunately I can't get my car key back but at least I have my Frye Bull Keyfob."
5.0,Love the feel of material! The fit is really nice and flattering. Pants leg falls at or slightly above ankle.
5.0,"We purchased a toddler bed and the Elmo bedding set this weekend. The print is really a cute one, and it seemed to help our son to want to be in his Elmo ""big boy bed"". The quality of the stuff turned out to be terrific. I was truly surprised at the softness of not only the sheets and pillow case, but of the comforter as well. I know some of the bedding sets I looked at were coarse and stiff---not what you'd want your little one sleeping in. Our print is the one shown (blue, not a red one as some mentioned having) and I did not experience any problems washing it."
5.0,My son loves these socks the higher back of sock is great
5.0,a very nice pair of slippers. good for in-door AND outdoors.  Well built and a fair price. I have a new favorite.

5.0,"Love love this outfit. I bought two. Fabric is amazing, beautiful, soft, high quality. It’s easy to put on/take off because of soft elastic at the neck and arm holes. I will prob buy more in the next size."
5.0,"Very comfortable, fit just right.  I'm a little short so there was some ruffles on the bottom. They were perfect for my ugly sweater party more or a brighter green."

5.0,sent to friends daughter. She adores it.
5.0,"Great boots!  Light-color enough to not heat up in the sun.<br />Light-weight to be comfortable.<br />Already tested on hiking, dog-walking, biking, scooter.<br />Good grip.<br />I enjoy these better than the low-cut version: you can untie<br />them and they still stay on feet."
5.0,Bought this for my mom as a birthday gift. Came before it said it would and she said it fit perfect!
5.0,Great variety
5.0,Not a bad backup
5.0,Thicker material than most of the dresses but I still like it.
5.0,I purchased this set of bugs for a project we did when learning about spiders. My 8 year old loved this project and these adorable bug charms just sent the project over the top!
5.0,Lost most of my hair due to a botched surgery.  While waiting for it to grow back this worked great.  Got a lot of complements on it.
5.0,I love it! I'm 5'5 and 120lbs. I bout and xs and it fits perfectly!  The only think I wish it had was pockets.
5.0,These arrived very quickly and were the perfect length.
5.0,"Excellent product; sleek, stylish and exact fitting. I bought the case because the mechanism which locks the hidden key into the fob broke off and I didn't want to chance loosing it all together and having to buy another fob as a result (as they can be very expensive).Not only did the case secure the locking mechanism in place, but it also secured the hidden key. Additionally, the case has a smooth feel to it and doesn't feel bulky at all. I also like the carabiner style hook.  Would definitely buy another and or referr to a friend."
5.0,"Fit my four year old perfectly. Very comfy, quality great, stayed on nicely. Ordered a matching paw patrol robe to go with them! Would order them again!!"
5.0,"I ordered a large based on reviews, and liked the fit. Im normally a small... I’m 5’, 143, and busty. If you want it to fit loose like the photos, definitely order up. If you want it fitted, then you could probably order your normal size. There is no tag in the neckline, but the size and care directions are on a tag on the side seam. The color is nice and bright. It looks kind of like “where’s Waldo” so I might just make a Halloween costume out of it lol. Overall it’s a good deal for the price I paid, and exactly as described. The fabric is soft and stretchy too... just a nice, striped, basic tee. I’m hoping the colors won’t bleed when washing. I will update if they do. 🤞"
5.0,"They are very comfortable, they stay up and hold their shape. Well worth the money."
5.0,These little hoops are so cute and can go with anything. They have a hinged opening.

5.0,"I LOVE this shirt. It fits perfect. I am 5'8&quot; and ordered a ex large. It fits loose around my middle section which I like. The material is soft, the colors are bright. It washes perfect. I just hung to dry.  I went back and ordered 3 more!"
5.0,"I'm petite, 5', 32D/34C and these fit perfectly. Nothing digs or rubs. They look good too! I bought them to sleep in, but they're so comfortable I basically live in them. They don't look like a sports bra under your clothes. I've washed these a bunch now (in a lingerie bag) and they've held up well. Some of the pads got twisted, but I took them out."
5.0,Very spacious. And strong material.
5.0,"This is a good mask for everyday use.  Easy to hand wash, and has three layers without the filter.  The ear loops are adjustable.  It does muffle your voice because of the thickness, but I think we are all getting used to that. I have had this mask for four months now, and it is till good as new."
5.0,Wonderful shirt!!
5.0,"What can I say? Perfect! Quality, size, fit, comfortable and gorgeous blouse!"

5.0,"Great looking glasses, kids love them and at an awesome price.."
5.0,works as advertised.
5.0,"These two grabbing tools are great for reaching things on high shelves in the kitchen or grabbing things off the ground. The grabbers are sturdy and the handles are shaped for a comfortable grip. The magnets aren’t very strong, but they’re strong enough to grip keys or anything small like that. I really like that it’s foldable, it makes storing very convenient"
5.0,i like these.
5.0,bought for a friend that owns a 442. he loves it.

5.0,Pros:<br />•Good quality sticker<br />•+200hp<br />•You feel way cooler<br /><br />Cons:<br />•I go through more tires than I would like to admit<br />•The local police look at me for an uncomfortable amount of time<br />•I go through way more gas than what is necessary

5.0,I love the way this suit feels and the quality of the material.  I am usually a size small but the first one I received was just too tight.  I replaced it with a medium and it’s perfect. It stays in place and is super comfortable — and very flattering.  My husband loves it on me and he’s very picky!
5.0,I bought several and we all love them! Support all - my girl is wearing it breast cancer race here in chicago Mother's Day weekend!
5.0,I have gotten to the point where walking around barefooted on hard wood floors too painful for me but I hate to wear shoes indoors. I have one pair of fuzzy socks I purchased somewhere (can't remember where) and decided I need some more. These were exactly what I had in mind. They are soft and have enough cushion to feel comfortable. I have been washing them by hand as advised and they are holding up well.

5.0,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter, but she won’t wear a mask for more than two minutes. My 7 year old son wore it (before we lost it) and he says of all of the masks he has worn - probably 5 different types - this was the best one. It is soft, conforms well to his face around the edges, and has adjustable ear straps which he liked the best.  He wore the 2-5 aged mask and it fit him fine.  He is on the thinner side, of average height for his age."
5.0,Perfect dress! Just as picture!!! Love it!
5.0,"Good color, length, and comfortable material."

This was a gift for my sister and she just loved it!  The style is flattering and the quality of the material is very good. The shirt is a snug fit due to the type of material, but that is what I was looking for, as it is the style my sister likes.  My sister loves Daryl and this shirt!  Very pleased!"
5.0,Great Dress!

5.0,"holding up great, works great."
5.0,"They were a great price for four pairs of earrings. The spider web, pumpkin and bat were made of a faux leather/foamy kind of material so they were very light weight. I don’t wear a lot of silver colored jewelry so I can’t speak for the skeleton earrings, but the other three pairs have held up nicely!"
5.0,I wore the mask for a few hours at NYE masquerade ball.  The mask fit well and was very comfortable.

5.0,"Good size...holds plenty...i just fill it with like chips, bread eggs, paper towels...and keep my heavy duty bags for the milk, cream, potatoes ..etc...I slowly turned each side inside out one side at a time to secure Velcro..it worked..store my other bags right inside it in my trunk"

5.0,great product! great price!
5.0,Every Day use!
5.0,"I LOVE this bag. The instance I received the bag I was blown away. It came in perfect condition protected with a plastic covering over the handles and the bag itself. I first noticed how durable the material was and the stitching is done very well (no frays or odd stitching). The bag has a zipped middle pocket and 2 larger storage areas on either side of the pocket. It has 2 small open top sewn in pockets to the inner front of the bag and a smaller zipped one on the inner back of the back. It holds and exurbanite amount of stuff as I have been doubling it as a purse and diaper bag since it came in.  The color is vibrant. I have gotten a ton of compliments from people on this. People are astonished at the price of this purse. I love purses so much I plan to buy this in other colors to have for my wardrobe.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to others.<br /><br />*I received this product at a free/reduced rate in exchange for an honest and completely unbiased review. If you have any questions, please ask and I will answer to the best of my ability. If you have found this review to be helpful, please feel free to let me know. *"
5.0,Cute and look really good with jeans/casual outfits.
5.0,"Superior slippers.  Makes a great deal of difference in my agonizing planar fasciitis. Good fit, lots of cushion.  Wish I had bought them years ago."
5.0,Great sports bra for big breasted women.
5.0,Comfortable compression for feet and legs.
5.0,These were a gift for my sister. She really likes the post back and that they are not too heavy on her ears. The post back makes them easier to put on than other hoop styles. Comfortable to wear.
5.0,Just what I wanted. No need to track down in stores
5.0,Socks fit great and provide the non skid bottom needed for yoga. Comfortable. Arrived quickly on time. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,"I love purple and always wanted a purple watch.  This one arrived quickly—less than 48 hrs—and once I set the time, it displays the time and looks pretty doing it. It belongs on my wrist. To me, from Me. With Love!💜💜💜"
5.0,"These are the BEST!! So Cozy, Comfort , Cute THE 3-C'S!!!"
5.0,My new go to too for my workouts!
5.0,"The Extra Small fit my 5' 0"" 105 lb wife just fine. It was just a few inches off of the floor. It was perfect for a snugly warm robe for couch watching TV."
5.0,"I really like the MIUSOL line of dresses and the V-Neck Retro Business Bodycon Pencil Dress; in navy blue, has quickly become one of my favorite dresses. This dress is very fashionable; yet comfortable and feminine, all at the same time. The material is very soft on the skin and easy to care for. I use Woolite, cold water, delicate cycle, and line dry. The material is thick enough to keep you warm, yet breathable, and does not require a slip.<br />I like this dress so much that I now have one in each color (purple, navy blue, and black) and I just ordered another navy blue; as I get the most compliments with the navy blue dress.<br /><br />Size 3x works best with a curvy fit; American size 16-18. It can be put on comfortably; without stretching, and it fits like a glove.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am limited to the V-Neck Retro Business Bodycon Pencil Dress because it is the only dress in the MIUSOL line that comes in the larger size.<br /><br />However, the other dresses are just as beautiful, comfortable, feminine, and easy to care for. These dresses are sexy yet very appropriate business attire. The MIUSOL Women's Scoop Neck Optical Illusion Business Bodycon Dress is also very beautiful, but is a bit tight as it does not come in a larger size."
5.0,Will enjoy wearing this
5.0,"I have had one of these for years and was so happy to find this on Amazon when mine finally needed replacing. I love it. It holds a lot of credit cards, plus has a see through window for your driver's license and a zipped section for coins. Quite often when I take it out to pay for an item someone will ask me where I got it. You don't need to carry one of those huge wallets."
5.0,The best watch 2 tones much with every outfit
5.0,I was worried about finding a bra to go with my custom wedding dress. There are a lot of other bras similar to this and I felt like taking a risk and buying this one because of the sizing chart. I am a 36DD and got a Large. The cups are a little small and I am going to try a XL for the heck of it but if that doesn't work out the Large will be great (especially with a little tape). It is a beautiful color nude that compliments my skin and matches the dress PERFECTLY! So happy!
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for. I didn’t want a plastic clasp
5.0,Absolutely love this jacket. I don’t care for the fact that it didn’t have any pockets except a small one on the left arm but besides that it’s great. I’m a huge AOT fan n this jacket is perfect.
5.0,"I really love these boots!  They are an incredible value for the money.  The leather is very high-quality, and the style and overall appearance are exceptional.  They are tough and durable, but also comfortable and fit well.  The tones of the leather compliment each other and present a very appealing look, which can be dressed up, or kept simple with a faded pair of jeans.  The height of the boot is very nice as well - a real boot (not a half boot), but low enough for easy lacing.  I tend to wear them only partially laced, with the excess laces wrapped around the top of the boot.  I sometimes also let my jeans ride on top of the boot, so the upper portion is visible.  Great boots with everyday wearability!"
5.0,"Gorgeous, well-made and easy to put on and remove.  Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Love it! Great product.
5.0,"Very detailed, not cheap looking at all. I actually ordered these for my daughter but they are a little larger in size than I thought so I will be keeping them for myself. I would recommend them."
5.0,I liked it so much I bought another one. Fits perfectly!
5.0,"very nice ,fits on ear good."

5.0,"Good size, nicely made."
5.0,came as pictured and faster than expected. they were a little smaller than i was expecting but thats okay
5.0,this is by far the best deal. great dress for the price. it fit as expected and can be adjusted with the straps that tie the back.

5.0,"I love how it looks exactly like the picture, if not BETTER. It shipped and arrived in less than 48 hours! Amazing communication with seller, they were very accommodating too. I am so so SO satisfied and happy with how well it turned out. I'm kind of short so I only need it themed in the front, but the length in the back is AMAZING. I'm so happy with this dress, I'll be using it as my wedding dress, thank you so much!"
5.0,"I needed a small crossbody for a concert I was going to and went with this one. I love it. The material is very nice and sewn well. Lots of pockets and room for a big phone, credit cards, makeup, etc.."

5.0,"These headbands are soft, silky, and comfortable. They did not pull on my hair or slip off during wear. They are easy to throw in the washing machine as well"
5.0,"This is so very well made and looked adorable on my daughter.  It was very stretchy and a little longer in length than the typical Dorothy costume.  The skirt was so much fuller too.  I have washed it and it came out great...she can wear this over and over with no issues.  I highly recommend this one.  Plus, with all the Dorothy's running around, her's was a bit different (and cuter in my opinion.)"
5.0,So comfortable got so many compliments
5.0,Internet photo did not give justice.  When I got it I was very much impressed!
5.0,Exactly as described. Received lots of compliments
5.0,I was not sure the wordage that was shown in the picture was correct on the socks I ordered.  The description states that they say coffee.  They are wine socks.
5.0,These are good quality and value. Great attention to detail.
5.0,"I bought this bag as a Christmas present and can't wait to give it.  The bag came wrapped nicely.  The color was a little brighter than the picture, but I liked it more.  The bag itself is well made.  I love the feel of the purse and it's a nice size."
5.0,Super comfortable. Great for a chilly morning walk or run.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful... Definitely makes a statement! Very happy with this piece. It has just the right amount of weight to hang correctly. Catches the light so well due to the cut of the &#34;stones&#34;.
5.0,"This is so cool printed beach hat. My husband like it so much. He said&#34; how it printed is really awesome. Perfect for the summer and a nice warm weather.<br /><br />It's pretty well-made and attractive, very noticeable because it has a different excellent design compared to other hats I have seen or wear. It says, it's only one size but there is an adjustable closure at the back to fit in your head. It's perfectly fitting for my husband, but for me it's not, even I adjusted it, maybe because I'm too small for this kind of hat. But the way it design is for a man. So it's a good gift for our man.<br /><br />Its really cool product, I love it though. I am comfortable recommending it to all. Great quality.<br /><br />Item received a discounted price in exchange of All I have said above that is my own honest opinion and reviewed based on my testing."
5.0,"I absolutely love this skirt!! So much so that I bought a second!! Its stretchy, has pockets and is very comfortable to wear at work."

5.0,"This shirt has lasted through repeated washing, the color has stayed true and the fit is still impeccable. The fabric has not pilled at all. It may be a bit long in the front and back for some, but I like the coverage.  Most comfortable short sleeve knit shirt I own."

5.0,"This bracelet looks much more expensive than it actually was. It's pretty, shiny, and the clasp is secure. It's easy to put on by myself. I had a more expensive tennis bracelet, but the clasp broke the second time I wore it. I bought this one to replace and wasn't expecting much, but the quality is great, especially for the price. Highly recommend."

5.0,I love this swimsuit!<br />It fit nicely and was perfect for my vacation!
5.0,"I love this skirt. I do have a little extra room in the waist and I got a medium. I am 5'7 and 175 lbs. my waist is 32.5&#34;. It was also long but that was ok because I wore heels, mind you they were only 2&#34; heels."
5.0,"Heavy duty tags that look great, will last for years and wire & lock application makes staying on your luggage a plus."

5.0,lovely just the right size and color
5.0,this is the cutest one ever ! everything soo perfect ❤️
5.0,"Super cozy hat! Pom pom comes a little squished but, proofs up almost right away. The pom pom also looks and feels like real fur and the knit is tight enough to keep in warmth but, not enough to make you overheat and sweat. 100% recommend!"
5.0,Works well and clicks in easy with the switch remotes.  Great to use the top buttons with this.
5.0,Work great and ordered a second pair!

5.0,Compré esta camiseta en talla M para mi esposo quien pesa 69 kilos y mide 1.70 cm y el ajuste fue perfecto. El color es el mismo de la foto promocional y el material y la confección son muy buenos.
5.0,Like--very  well made.Great product.
5.0,Great product.  It wasn't cheap looking.
5.0,Awesome size
5.0,"Great everyday t-shirt for the price, nice fabric."
5.0,Nice product and the price was not that bad. No bad thing to say about the product or shipper. Good transaction. My nurse fiancé loves it and wears it on her work badge proudly.
5.0,Exactly like lululemon align ! I was shocked at how much they resemble the align leggings that I love but don’t want to spend another 100$ on. I ended up ordering another pair of these in black. Definitely recommend!
5.0,"Beautiful. Little big for my small wrist, but love it."
5.0,Love them!! Exactly as pictures and described. They’re very light and comfortable as well.
5.0,I absolutely love the detail of these tiki masks.  I have them on a hook on the privacy fence that is around my above ground pool.  They are just above the hooks I purchased separately which i use to hold our towels for the pool.  Very well made and colorful!
5.0,Very stylish sunglasses. The gold accent provides an elegant touch without being gaudy.
5.0,"Bought it for my son so he'd leave mine alone,  now I want to use his. Soft, thick and so comfy warm. Nice robe!"

5.0,"Super , llegaron rapido , material buena calidad y en talla yo soy 36 y pedi 37 me quedaron un poquito grande , es decir 36 y medio hubiese sido perfecto, pero igual bellas y comodas"
5.0,Best house shoes for the little ones! My 4 year old loves them and says they are comfortable but they are so tad bit smaller than I was hoping. Size up if possible! Comes with built in memory foam and harder bottoms for support.
5.0,My boyfriend loves this. He was skeptical about it after I told him how well it worked. But the compression is great & effortless. I own 5 of the female tanks in small. Whatever size you are make sure you order a size down so you get maximum compression. You won’t feel that’s wet but you’ll see it what do you like the shirt and takeoff the tank. Love it and will continue to order more
5.0,"Bought for my 9 year old, he loves Avengers, and the masks fit him perfectly. Sometimes kids masks are too small for him and adult masks are too big, it’s hard to find a good fit for him cause he’s more of a teen size. These were not tight and not loose, just right. Fit was comfortable for him, material was soft. Great buy, he’s happy and I’m happy with them."
5.0,"The belt is really great. Wonderful leather, great leather smell. True to size. It is a very dark brown, so it can be worn with brown or black pants. I would order another one, but I think this one will out live me!"
5.0,Chain is relatively thin but it's a good value for what it is.<br />Comes in a small gift box.<br /><br />My daughter absolutely loves it.
5.0,really love the dress
5.0,"I have used it a few times so far and it does what it says, taking a bra strap that is a bit too big and making it fit again.  The clip is easy to use as it slides over your existing band/hooks and is easily secured.  It was comfortable throughout the day and stayed in place.  I would definitely recommend it over throwing out bras that are in good condition."
5.0,Good coverage and stylish
5.0,"Very , very surprised at how well done this bat bracelet looks. The bat is carved out and looks great. This is more than a Halloween bracelet. It’s a nice piece of jewelry if you like bats. I do."

5.0,Been obsessed with getting a necklace like this after seeing Rene Zellweger with one similar. Lol. It’s actually very pretty in person despite it being very inexpensive. Not sure how well it’ll hold up but I’m very happy with my purchase.
5.0,This is a really great quality and my husband loves it! It is very warm! We ordered a large because the reviews said it fit smaller and I believe a medium would have fit a little better. He gets compliments on it every time he wears it!
5.0,Fit to size and are very comfortable. Also dry quickly
5.0,"Looks great -- feels great, paired with my momentum watch! A little long for my wrist but easily cut."
5.0,"My measurements are 38-32-42, I’m a 36c, weigh 145-155. In the photos I’m 155. I ordered a medium. It fits great, but small May have been better. This has a little too much fabric around my stomach and hips. I still love this dress as-is. Fabric isn’t see-through. I also got a blue one. Both are exactly as pictured in the listing. Very flattering top for your cleavage, without being raunchy. I’m definitely going to order more!"
5.0,It is beautiful!
5.0,Love my dress got lots of compliments.
5.0,Was adorable.
5.0,Perfect for what I needed it for good quality

5.0,great product. good price
5.0,Arrived on time just for Halloween. It had a VERY strong odor of plastic. We needed to washed it several time and even left it for few hours with some baking soda so it could absorb the smell. It went away a bit and we were able to used it. It served the purpose. Strong material.
5.0,My daughter loves her boots!!! I get stopped by people asking where did I get them from.

5.0,Good size and it looks pretty realistic.
5.0,Great quality and service

5.0,"This tank is what I expected. I have been looking for some comfortable one's, this was amazingly comfortable. This are true to the size listed ...<br /><br />Cons :<br />1. Material is flexible , durable and made up of cotton.<br />2. Color of the material doesn't fade when washed.<br />3. Patterns are beautiful yogic prints<br />4. The size is as expected . I ordered medium.<br />5. Color is good.<br />6. Good quality tank.<br />7. Length of the tank is good.<br />8. Comfortable<br /><br />Cons: none yet .<br /><br />I received it at discounted price as part of the promotion. But review is my true opinion. I promise you will love the product .

5.0,"A lovely dress! It's feminine and fun and I felt good wearing it. It was reasonably priced, fit well and was perfect for the occasion."
5.0,For a cheap pair of glasses these are actually pretty nice.
5.0,He won't wear any other brand.  So glad I was able to find this in time for Christmas.  They wear really well.

5.0,Good !
5.0,Great quality and not cheap made at a great price
5.0,Love the top. I’m a DD and I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly for me (as pictured). I’ll probably get another color soon lol.
5.0,The robe is well made and feels great! My grandson like it and the orange color is nice and looks just like it does in the picture. It fits well also. I got a size kids M for the 8 year old and kids S for the 5 year old. They are a little big which is fine since I wanted them to last for a year at least.
5.0,I looked for the perfect Santa hat and I finally found it
5.0,Very nice and warm coat. It is thick but light weight.
5.0,this belt is strong  easy to change length with belt on and feel good around your waist i go threw belts in a short time  i have tried different belts over my lift time but this belt stands up to my rough use buying  another one very soon
5.0,I purchased this item as a gift but I think they are beautiful.
5.0,"Love this product! Pictured with a newer hair tie that’s been squeezing my wrist like crazy. The hair tie fits perfectly around, stays inside the groove, and the bracelet stretches since it was a little tight on my wrist to begin with. Would highly recommend!"

5.0,I really liked this item but it did not last a week when it broke but it is cute
5.0,Un bonito regalo para un ser amado
5.0,Great Product i love the wood version of this instead of the metal ones. It so easy to remove and insert cards as well. My previous one was so hard to remove and insert cards it became very cumbersome that i had to get another one i'm glad i purchased this one.
5.0,Very good but a bit too little.
5.0,The fabric is good quality and the photo is clean and clear. Exactly what is advertised

5.0,"I will preface I personally don't looove these. My girlfriend does. She bought a similar pair at Made Well and lost one. So I surprised her with these as a replacement. She loves the even more, they were way cheaper, **only thing that I could say to improve is that they look better in person that this online image suggests (so new image, better lighting maybe?)** Pretty good set for the eclectic, quirky, or chunky jewelery sort of person."
5.0,I loved my first pair so much this is my second order and still just as happy. I may even like these better than the wedges the ankle strap is not as lose as the ones that wrap around. Love love these shoes! I'm a 6 1/2 and 37 fits beautifully!

5.0,"Purchased this for my mom, and it fit her perfectly"
5.0,Awesome for Pajamas.
5.0,"Our umbrella came to us defective. It wouldn't click into place at the top. I emailed Le Papillon about the issue and received a response within a few hours. They offered to replace the umbrella, no questions asked, and sent it out two day shipping. The new umbrella works great! I love the different options it has to maximize coverage. It was extremely easy to set-up. I did it by myself! Would recommend this product."
5.0,Great for school
5.0,"I love the fit of these pants. They make your booty look great!  I am 5’7, 132lbs and I ordered a small and they fit great. I also Have them in a medium, which fit but are a little big."

5.0,"My cousin had an all white wedding. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a white dress, so I took a chance on this. I got SO MANY compliments! Random people stopped me and were shocked to learn that I got my dress from Amazon.<br /><br />Dress details - the lace is super soft and stretchy. I have a little basketball pooch and this made it disappear. And the lining was thick. My grandmother couldn’t believe that I didn’t need an additional slip for this (pro tip - wear a red bra under a white dress. Disappears no matter what your skin tone).<br /><br />The biggest compliment though - a friend saw my dress and bought one in black for a cocktail attire wedding she’s attending this summer.<br /><br />From now on, I’ll be checking Amazon before Nordstrom for my one night only outfits"
5.0,LOVE IT!!!! TOO CUTE!!!!
5.0,"I’ve bought these several times over the past couple of years, usually in a higher number as my eyesight gets worse.  But, I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I started buying them for the beach so I could sit in the sun and read and they’re absolutely perfect for that.  I don’t need glasses any other time but when I’m reading.  These are perfect for that and I do 100% recommend them!"
5.0,Such a cute top fits perfectly!!!!! New fav crop top
5.0,Was definitely plus sized
5.0,"I am usually a size small or medium, so I bought a medium because I didn’t want it to be too tight on by hips/butt. The medium was way too big everywhere. Also the length of the bodysuit was too long for my torso. I am 5’4. Overall I pinned the back to fit the bodysuit to me and worn with the cape nobody noticed. It is a nice looking costume."
5.0,Beautiful  moana shirts
5.0,Love this item adorable and quick delivery
5.0,This cardigan is my FAV!!!!!!!!! I wear it every time I wake up to throw on when it’s cold. It’s light and amazingly comfortable!!!!!!

5.0,"MY FAVORITE NEW BEANIE!!! I have a ton of hair that is always balled up on top of my head and this hat is perfect for me!! Its adorable too!! I would actually like to buy different colors if available.<br />I work 3rd shift and taking a shower late can be way too cold in the winter til now!! I took a shower before I left tonight, put it on with my wet balled up hair on top,and my head was warm and snugly as could be!! For all you long hair ladies...this is a must in my opinion!!"
5.0,"It looks great, my daughter gets many compliments"
5.0,"These are made of thick material and should keep you warm. They look more expansive then they are. FYI, I'm 5' 11&#34; and 165lbs and US M+ fit nicely. I ordered two more in different colors. I'm a satisfied customer."
5.0,Simple and elegant.
5.0,I really like these necklace extensions.
5.0,"Durable materials, fashionable, functional, and innovative. It will make you hate going back to using any of your old belts.<br />Not to mention, incredible customer service."
5.0,"Not too tight like most infant pajamas are these days. These fit my baby very comfortably, the fabric is soft and thick weave-a very nice quality cotton knit. There are treads on the bottom of the feet which is nice, and a fabric loop at the top of the zipper for the zipper to tuck into. I looked all over the internet to find cotton footed pajamas with a normal/non-snug fit for my baby. It seems almost nobody makes them. These are just what I was looking for!"
5.0,LOVE these pants. They are so great for working out and the color is gorgeous
5.0,"If you are looking for a stainless steel bracelet for your watch, this is it. I have seen similar bracelets go for $60.00 plus elsewhere. The band is lightweight and fits my 22 millimeter band Seiko solar watch great. See picture."

5.0,Cute cute cute!!  Nice size - not too big or two small.  Clasps firmly and I am very well pleased.  Thank you!!

5.0,"Towel material bath robe! Perfect fit. Long, past the knees"
5.0,"Product worked great. I didn’t have to deal with the condescending Amazon Customer “Service” supervisors like I did for another item. Amazon Customer Service used to be AMAZING, now they essentially do not care what the buyer says. I would order this again."
5.0,Love them. Took awhile to get them but love them.
5.0,"Used this as part of my Maleficent costume,  so the XXXL was the perfect I was looking for! 👍🏼👍🏼"
5.0,It’s a nice bracelet. The quality seems good. It probably will scratch easily which I didn’t consider before ordering but any bracelet like this would. I’m gifting this to my maid of honor. I liked it since it’s something different than the bangles with charms which I was originally considering. The product does look just like the pictures online.
5.0,I have thrown away all my other belts. This one rocks!
5.0,I bought one for myself and one for my daughter for Nurses weeks.  We both love them and have gotten a lot of compliments on them.  The name is on both sides which is great.
5.0,"Very good. Was for gift to my sister. I made mistake and ordered  less width. But shoes man put calup and strech tham,they fit now."
5.0,"Wore to a NOLA wedding and received compliments throughout! Beautiful colors...flattering waist line...a little long for me at 5'2, but easily resolved with wearing higher on waist. Quality material. Will buy more patterns."
5.0,Beautiful !!!! Wear it all the tine
5.0,"Come winter time, I often need the protection of a good warm hat to shield my bald head from the elements. I've had other turtle fur hats, and nothing matches them in terms of warmth and comfort. I'm not too concerned about style, but they check that box for me as well. Be mindful of the care instructions, because wool will shrink in the dryer. That's the only reason I'm on my second one 😄"
5.0,"Love it! Get so many complaints, it’s a little to blown up but it’s perfect!"
5.0,Surprisingly beautiful and perfect for gifting for the price.  Safe shipping.  I am very pleased.

5.0,The top is super cute and the quality is perfect.
5.0,I’m a dog groomer and these are just perfect. I am also skinny as a rail and have a horrible time finding fitted athletic clothes. I bought two sets!
5.0,"These are the perfect width for my finger, I love all the colors, and they're super comfy. The only criticism I have is that they run small. I usually wear a size 6, I ordered a 6.5, but I should have gotten a 7 instead. My finger doesn't look like a  sausage busting out of its casing or anything, but another half size up and they would have perfect!"
5.0,"I really like it, well made, nice material, and the picture matches the product"
5.0,"The glasses looks so funny on me but it helps a lot with driving at night. The case look super fancy tho, I think half of the price goes to the box. I had lasik and driving in the poorly lid road was a disaster. The glasses help lid up with dark area and slightly dim down the super bright spot. It is not as good as I hoped it would be but it does help."
5.0,Love the style but i wish ot was xsmall and fot good
5.0,The slippers slid on easily and are very comfortable.  I'd buy them again.
5.0,These shoes r so cute ~ they're very very soft and very very comfortable ~ She wears a 9.5 but the 9 fits perfectly with a tiny bit of room to grow ~ I highly recommend
5.0,Super cute. Good quality for price. Will look adorable with spring outfits.
5.0,Light and comfortable!<br />Super cute and amazing at the computer!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1247cda70c20ebc323b0f538b6809c48]] I love this hoodie!  It was delivered fast and packaged nicely.  It’s lightweight and super soft and comfy.  The colors are as pictured and very bright.  It fits as expected.
5.0,"Really nice casual shirt. Got it for everyday wear in the house and nice, comfy. Easily paired it with leggings."
5.0,I love this shirt! The colors pop well and are made with quality material.
5.0,"For the guys and galls who love to be bold I think this is the perfect gift.  Im not sure how it stays on, but the person I got it for just cant stop wearing it"
5.0,I really like the rhinestones on the glasses and they are so sharp looking!!
5.0,"Cute, comfy shoes for the price. Thin, but my 5 year old daughter loves them"
5.0,I purchase a mommy and me hat every winter and as always these are perfect. fit as expected and nicely made
5.0,"Great product, will buy again for more belts"
5.0,Can be dressed-up or dressed-down. Super comfy.
5.0,It serves the purpose--no complaints.
5.0,Product is exactly what I expected
5.0,"Over a year later I still use this wallet exclusively, and am incredibly happy with my purchase. It has all the space I need and holds up against every day use. Of course there is the added bonus that the color is beautiful and I love all the little accents. Best wallet I have ever bought! I plan to use it for many years to come."
5.0,I've been using this for well over a month. It's great! No leaks. Water comes in when you don't fix it properly.
5.0,"cute.  There are seams on inside leg, which is fine but I prefer seamless, this seems like a minor thing.  Seems constructed well.  Really hugs the hips."
5.0,"Awesome!! This is a gift for Christmas for a good friend, I was so impressed by the material and quality of the whole garment that I went back and ordered one for our son for Christmas. As my friend and son will not be seeing this until Christmas I can't say if the fit was good. I am going on my instinct for them both and I wouldn't have ordered a second one if I didn't think they would be a hit with the 2 of them."
5.0,So I bought these larger and they were a hair to big . Only reason I did was everyone complaining they came a bit to small just buy your fit
5.0,Very comfy and nice to colors 'everyone' can choose from.
5.0,Fits great and feels good. Used it on my Fossil Smartwatch.
5.0,We got this for our part time employee that works the 5am shift and us trouble getting up on time. He hasn’t been late since! No complaints from him either.<br /><br />Would absolutely recommend.
5.0,"It was too small thru the bust and back.  So sad to have to return it, this print was not available in the next sizs up."
5.0,Love this hand made beautiful bracelet. It was a gift for my sister and it made the year.
5.0,I’m plus sized and very large around the middle.  I weight 232 and am 5’5.  I needed a sparkle skirt for a Disney run so I ordered a bunch because I was sure none would fit.  The elastic on this is great and really stretches.  The skirt fit fine and didn’t ride up at all.  I’m on the right in the green.
5.0,"Really cute, will wear with leggings in cool weather."
5.0,Tie goes great with my black suit. Cool design. Love it
5.0,I got these glasses for my daughter who has epilepsy. Her eye doctor wanted me to pay $100 plus her insurance for transition glasses. I noticed she got tired of changing from her reading glasses to her sunglasses just to go outside to play. Thank you so much for these glasses. She loves them! And so do I! And got them at a cheaper price.
5.0,"This dress was inexpensive but didn't look cheap at all!  It is a great value, fashionable and best of all the fabric is YUMMY.  So comfortable, it does not feel like a stuffy dress but can be worn for any occasion, special day or casual.  I'll be buying another!"
5.0,Unusual.  I tell people I bought it from an estate sale.
5.0,Such a nice touch to summer capris. Loved the flowered print. The material is rather light weight and flowy. Legs are quite wide. Little dressier than the norm. I think the material is mostly polyester and will wash and pack beautifully. No wrinkles for this material. Not a jersey knit that I detest!  Pair with a cute black sandals and a black or white  oversized blouse and you’ll look very summery!
5.0,I received a lot of compliments on my watch band every day!
5.0,Decent belts. Thinner material but still ok. Better than a 70.00 cobra.
5.0,After a little problem with the shipping received as promised and are exactly what I expected. Good quality fishnet gloves for cheap. Super cute addition to my play clothes
5.0,Got this for my son. He loves it. The material is nice and worth the money.
5.0,They were very comfortable and my boyfriend loves them! They fit just right and use good quality fabric. Im a 34 DD and i ordered a 2X and it fits just fine.
5.0,love these glasses... fashionable and affordable
5.0,"This suit is absolutely adorable. It does run a little small, just keep that in mind."
5.0,Awesome. Very well Maude and sturdy construction.
5.0,Good value for price.
5.0,Very good quality and style. recommend.
5.0,This took longer than I thought it would to arrive but when it arrived it came nicely packaged and it included a nice zip-up case. The sunglasses are very light-weight and does not feel heavy at all when wearing. I purchased the pinkish/orange lens that looks just like the picture advertised. It is definitely stylish and fun to wear out.
5.0,AWESOME!!!
5.0,Perfect fit and good quality high gloss set
5.0,"I purchased two of these earrings in the gold finish. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I got my daith peircings about 4 months ago and the long bar was constantly in my way. I ordered these wanting something cute but also small enough to still be able to wear headphones as well as clean my out my ears. This was perfect! Having never changed my own piercing, I was a little nervous, but it was super easy to get in and closed easily. I highly recommend them. I would buy them again."
5.0,its so beautiful and comfy.. I just want to cuddle up to my mom who will be wearing it. 💖
5.0,Soft exactly the right thickness the touch tip works great. Love them
5.0,"A friend bought this for me, engraved with my cat's name, when she passed in June 2020. I since moved, packed this and her ashes in a UPS box that was lost, so I was grateful these were still available.<br />Well made, including the chain, I wear it 24/7."
5.0,Love this dress material is very stretchy go a size or 2 down.
5.0,Don’t hesitate purchase this dress
5.0,My husband loves this hat and wears it all the time. He has gotten numerous compliments on how nice it is.
5.0,Love the dresses. Very well made and the color is awesome. Fast shipping!!
5.0,Fit my converse sneakers perfect!
5.0,Love these scrubs. The flexible side pannel makes it a perfect fit eveytime.
5.0,These yoga pants are amazing! I am 5' 6'' and 135 lbs.. the Mediums fit perfectly! I bought 4 different colors and will probably buy more!
5.0,"This is my third time buying this dress. I got a Large this time (got three of them! Burgundy, navy and the darker green). My first one was black on XXL, and second was a brown on XL. I prefer how the XXL and XL fit, because they're longer, but that's the main difference between the sizes. If they are less roomy, the difference must be minimal, because it didn't bother me at all. I am 5'5 and at my heaviest now (250lbs), and there is not a single time I wear this dress without a compliment. The XXL goes to the top of my feet, the XL is just a bit shorter and the L stays about 8in from the floor. I absolutely love this dress and highly recommend it, no matter your figure."
5.0,"I got these on Monday ! and they were just the cutest things I ever saw. They are just a little big for her. But she is growing really fast ! so, in a few months she will be able to wear them !"
5.0,"this product is great. i recieved it reletivly quick. the quality is top not as the description says. has a little weight to it which is a good thing. it's a good thickness. the ""red"" is a little light. but it's not a big deal. overall i am impressed with this product and will be purchasing more products from virginbee."
5.0,I love this dress! The fabric is really soft too.
5.0,Our grand son loved it!
5.0,Love it in Black. It's big.
5.0,"It got a little bent in transport, but not too big of a deal."
5.0,"Excellent fit and very well made. Very warm and snuggly PJs for cool to cold weather wear. I'm a ""hot sleeper"" living in a warm climate, so I will pass these on to my mom who lives in a colder climate and will love the coziness and cheerful, red plaid pattern. Highly recommend!"
5.0,STUNNING!
5.0,"Seen these glasses in a movie. Did some research and found these glasses on amazon.  Bought 2 pair more for the ""joke"" factor between my wife and myself.  Then I (we) put them on and the laughter turned into amazement to how well these work.  Suffering from 5 herniated disc in my back I never thought about the medical relief these glasses could provide.  They will take some getting use to and I suggest starting at 5 minutes and work up to long wear times. My wife abd I both got a little sick to our stomaches but that got better the more we eore them."
5.0,I liked them but the only thing is that i order size 9 and its a little big on me but i put double socks and there fit fine
5.0,The wallet is exactly as described and it appears the leather should hold up well.
5.0,Very fast shipping and Mother-In-Law loved them
5.0,"Nice dressy scarf, at a great price"
5.0,My wife loves this dress she's HOT in it w/pull up stockings & graders that slit really sends it over the top!!!!!
5.0,"These socks do not constrict are all. They have very comfortable fiber, too!"
5.0,"I got this for my wife a few days ago and she loves them!<br />She loves the color and size of them, the only minor problem would be that the ""stem"" is a bit too short and she's afraid they may fall off, other that than this is a great quality set of earrings by Gem Avenue, highly recommend them!"
5.0,Love these full reader sunglasses!  They are super stylish and they fit my small face perfectly.
5.0,My daughters LOVE these socks!
5.0,"not sure why, but the Costco Size 4 fits me and the Amazon size 6 fits me ?<br />they look identical, but for some reason the sizes seem different.<br />The amazon size 6 fits exactly like the costco size 4, so I am happy with them both, but puzzled by the size inconsistency"
5.0,"Great way to stash your winnings! We bought 2, had a problem with 1 of them wouldn’t open, called the phone number that came with it, sent me a new one within 2 days! Great customer service! That means a lot these days! Thank you for the product and service!"
5.0,So Cute!
5.0,"Easy to put on as the material is comfortable and flattering.  The crunched party helps disguise the wide waist line and it can be shorten to help fit a shorter person like me.<br /><br />After several washes and dryer, no shrinkage or discoloration.  Easy fall dress.... to wear for school drop off!"
5.0,Beautiful patterns & Excellent quality!
5.0,Like the fit and feel a little long but doable.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. I wish it was a little smaller diameter like One inch or even 7/8&#34;. Hopefully you could make one in the near future and I will order more. Thanks.<br />Ron
5.0,I bought this to wear with leggings. I am short so I had to him this up a little bit but I absolutely love it!
5.0,"The stitching looks great, it is a soft jersey material, the fit was perfect, and it looks amazing on. It also holds up in the washer well, however I dont dry my shirts so I couldnt tell you how it holds up in the drier."
5.0,Bought this for my 5 year old grandson. He loved Sam at Halloween time.  So I bought him an ornament for the tree. Super cute
5.0,It is very stretchy & comfortable.
5.0,Good sandals I may purchase a another pair really nice on my 2 year feet
5.0,Good quality and price<br />Faster shipping
5.0,"This dress is light, has adjustable shoulder straps and pockets.  I love it."
5.0,"These are fun low cost ear rings to mix and match. They were not too bulky nor heavy...however the pairs I received did not have nickle free/surgical steel posts. At this price point if they were surgical steel they would be an absolute steal...as they are they are still a good value. Please remember you may react to these posts before buying, or at least remember to carry a handy second pair after a few hours"
5.0,My husband really likes the band. It looks classy and can be worn for any occasion. It’s easy to buckle cause it magnetic.
5.0,I’m 5’0 with What size Double DD’s and this fit me good with it was a inch longer but it was a good buy I but my tights and my way separate
5.0,They work good for my crystals<br />Def a great purchase for how much come in a pack.
5.0,It is just what I was looking for. It holds all my needed items for traveling.
5.0,Picture looks like a light green but what I received  is dark army green still good tho
5.0,They are better looking in person they are worth their money. If you are thinking about it I would recommend this product.
5.0,"You ultimately get what you pay for. The material of this dress is something I've never felt before. There are no tags either. Upon arrival it smelled horrible I was scared to even put it on my skin. It smelled of mold, like a strong chemical, i don't know what the odor was, but it was not good. Almost as if it had been sitting in an old wearhouse for years. I also recieved the wrong size. I emailed the sender immediately. They were the nicest most professional sender I have ever dealt with. They apologized. Explained that the item was shipped from overseas & was packaged to endure the travel, & they would send another item in the correct size. I was not charged for the replacement & not held responsible for returning the previous item. When the new one came in I was very pleased to say that the odor was no longer a part of this newer item, the fit was outrageously comfortable & I received compliments literally everywhere I went. I wore this dress on one of the hottest days in Chicago & the material kept my body breathing. It was worth the money paid. Also can be worn without the belt. Does not look exactly like the pic. More of a jean like stretchy material. This item stains easily as well but honestly well worth the amazingly low price for cheap & cute comfort. The belt is not attached it comes separate & must tie your own bow. I was unable to do it like the pic so i rocked it alone & just as pretty."
5.0,"I'm really happy with this watch! It's a very cool, light weight, minimalist kind of watch. The purchase was well worth it."
5.0,I ordered at large the first time it was too big and now I got a small fits perfect very Happy with it it definitely runs very big 👍
5.0,I love the fabric and the way this tank hangs.  It's just the right length.
5.0,these Disney pajamas were a hit!
5.0,Great quality. They’re a little small but they’re perfect for earrings or charm bracelets.
5.0,LOVE these! They fit my long narrow feet so much better than any other low socks I've ever had. Will be buying more soon.
5.0,Soft Material and Comfortable.
5.0,Very lightweight and warm!! I’m glad I got a size larger because it fits. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"I loved this skirt! Especially how it fits on me. I am not that tall so have hard time to find perfect length long skirt. But I found it here!  Fabric is really soft it feels like I didn't wear anything lol Some of my coworkers wanted them since they gained some weight during COVID, they need comfy not tight skirt lol Totally worth it!"
5.0,Like it very much and it's a perfect gift.
5.0,Cute and comfortable to go from work to dinner. Great fabric and print.
5.0,This fit perfect as a cover-up.  Beautiful print!
5.0,"Really enjoy the product, i don’t have pictures in it yet because i haven’t gotten the time but it fits perfectly and is so pretty, don’t even think, just buy it ☺️💜"
5.0,This is just the cable. You will need the wall adaptor.
5.0,The charms arrived way before expected date and are lovely. Will add a nice touch to my hand made knit items.
5.0,Dallas fan know win or lose. Dallas all the way so it’s perfect texture for price.
5.0,SUPER super cute sox.  Very intricate design.  Great quality.  I want more. Looking forward to cooler weather just to wear these.  I am a knitter and these are so cute there is absolutely no need to handmake these.
5.0,Arrived earlier than expected and was as described. I got a size larger than I normally do and I am glad I did because it fits perfectly.  Would buy again.
5.0,"This bag is beautiful,I bought it in Macy's and I love it"
5.0,Very pretty and loved how they camed packaged
5.0,Product is true to size and has a nice tapered look to it. I will be buying a couple more in different colors.
5.0,I have worn this multiple times already for local Oktoberfests.  For what I paid for this I did not expect something that would wear so well.  I did wear a dirndl bra under it for more pushup....  It even has a pocket hidden in the sideseam.  Very happy with this purchase.  If (ok when) I need a second I will be purchasing from this company again.
5.0,Item was delivered in a timely manner as described. Rings are worn separately to cover a tattoo and serve their purpose well.
5.0,Mamba 24
5.0,"This is a great wallet, I am happy I bought this, It does everything I wanted in a wallet."
5.0,"This seller contacted me for measurements prior to shipping the jacket. As a result, I received a product that fits perfectly. It's also extremely comfortable, and just right for cool days. And, of course, it looks great!"
5.0,Looks just like the photo.
5.0,"They fit pretty good I just wanted them a little more snug, because they started to slip down some when I was running, other wise a great product!"
5.0,"The variety of colors are beautiful. These were actually the perfect size, too. True to what they say."
5.0,"I love their products! Perfect for what i need them for, great quality also! Thank you!"
5.0,"Just received it about 15 minutes ago and I love it!! For the price you can't beat it! It fits great and is so comfy!! I'm thinking I need a few more in a few other colors. Only 2 things could make it perfect, pockets and adjustable straps. 👍🏼👍🏼"
5.0,I bought 3 pairs for my family as gifts . My grandson loves them. I love them. Have not heard if my daughter likes them but I think she will.  Yes I recommend them.  They look good and fit is just perfect
5.0,Beautiful! Fit great.
5.0,kid loves it. battery life is good.
5.0,"Arrived early, packaged well, links very easy to remove. Looks great."
5.0,"This is an initial impression for the first gen boots. The reviews elsewhere proved these to have a proven track record for comfort, water resistance and durability. I chose these also because of my positive experience with a pair of street boots. Out of the box the boots are really comfortable, with good flexion/extension but also good lateral support; the hinged ankle does a great job. The fit is not narrow as in much Italian footwear, and I found it true to size for the size 45/US 11 pair I bought ($275 shipped from another source). I would think 44’s are closer to a 10.5 but I can’t say for sure. I hope to give an update later as I have more experience with them."
5.0,"Wearing this really makes me feel extremely sexy and beautiful. I naturally don’t have a great opinion of myself so it’s nice to feel attractive in something when my husband is viewing me. It is a bit bigger on me but I think that is my fault as I wanted to make sure it wasn’t too small so I was over compensating I think. It’s okay though, it still fits very well. It isn’t saggy anywhere. The straps don’t fall off your shoulders. The back part opens up for easy access when you’re ready for it. The front isn’t uncomfortable at all, if anything it feels like wearing a pair of shorts and having it rub in between the crease of your legs. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product if you are self-conscious in the tummy region but are comfortable with your body in your chest and buttocks region. This will cover you in the places you want to covered, but allow you to feel beautiful and comfortable as well. I would say it’s definitely true to size since I ordered a size bigger than I was thinking and it ended up being too big. Thanks so much to the seller!!!"
5.0,"Fits well and is comfortable. I washed it in a lingerie bag, hung up to dry and it turned out great. Love this brand for the quality and fit."
5.0,The bunnies are cute and they arrived well packed. The ears are small enough to accept most any size ring. Very nice. The color (pink) matched the image.
5.0,Ordered one size bigger than my normal size because I like the way shorts fit. They fit me as I expected. I'm in my late 30's but these shorts are just right length and I feel so comfortable wearing them.
5.0,Son loves it- has received lots of compliments.
5.0,I can finally get my bracelets on! Yay!
5.0,"My daughter loves this dress. Nice material, good stretch and not cheaply made."
5.0,"I love these glasses! I had actually bought them in another store about a year ago and wore them everywhere. I was devastated when I lost them in a restaurant but thrilled to find them sold on Amazon! I think they're really well constructed for being cheap sunglasses. The lenses keep the sun out, they fit my narrow face perfectly (I usually have issues with that), and they're so cute! Shipped fast, great price, and I get so many compliments on them!"
5.0,"very happy with my purchase, shirts fit the way they should, and feel good, during a workout or play..."
5.0,"If you have WIDE FEET and<br /><br />you wear IN SHOE TOE SPACERS<br /><br />your feet might not fit into these shoes in the toe box with the &#34;in shoe toe spacers&#34; being worn.<br /><br />I wear toe socks with in shoe toe spacers anytime I am putting on shoes so that my toes are working in the alignment they were meant to work in.<br /><br />THE REVIEW:<br />The shoes are comfy as hell<br />I bought them as a running trail shoe, and they exceeded my expectations.<br />Shoes fit extremely comfortably and the shoe shape worked very well with my foot, minus the toe box.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot say anything bad about the shoes.  I wish they offered a WIDER toe box option, or a WIDE option so I can wear in shoe toe spacers inside these shoes.  BUT, other than Altra, there are not many other brands I can wear toe socks with the spacers in."
5.0,"This dress is amazing. Bought it for work, I'm an administrator, and it is professional and comfortable. Thick enough material that it isn't too clingy, but still flattering. Would buy it in multiple colors!"

5.0,Like the additional layered look that it gives my outfits.

5.0,"Always looking for the perfect style and the comfortable fit - and I think I’ve found it!  Yes, the style is retro, but it really all depends on the shape and my face, doesn’t it!  I really like them, and I get compliments, so these glasses are a great choice!"

5.0,"I bought this for Christmas for my mom. The bag it came in was in awful condition so I was very scared to open it. Despite my suspicion, it was absolutely stunning. It came in a beautiful box and the necklace was in great condition as was the chain. Worth the price and still just as sturdy in mid February!"
5.0,Christmas purchase for my sister. She LOVED it!  It is a very pretty watch. She wears it for both work and dress. My sister is a nurse.  She loves the fact that it is easy to read and has a 2nd hand for when she is taking a patients pulse.
5.0,"Super cute on my daughter and feels like good quality. Fit was slightly long, but i was able to tuck the extra fabric under the tutu so its not noticeable at all and gives us room to grow."

5.0,I use these in my ears so I don't have to remove them so often and the earring doesn't poke the back of my ear. They work great and came exactly as stated.

5.0,"Beautiful dress, fits true to size. Not itchy at all, my daughter loves it. Great quality. We received many compliments."
5.0,"These are a generous fit, with lots of room for my tall 5-year-old to grow. We decided the fleece lined pants would be too heavy for our mild winters in the Pacific Northwest, so we returned these in favor of their unlined ones. They are very well made! We’ve been very happy with our other items from this company."

5.0,"[[ASIN:B01LWKOAKY V-Moro Silver Milanese Loop for Fitbit Charge 2, Large Stainless Steel Magnetic Band With Adapters 6.7-9.5 inches (Milanese Loop Silver)]] This band is easier to use than the one the Fitbit came with.  Takes so time to master it because the magnet never really releases from the band.  However, once you  mast how to slide it on the band the problem is resolved.  It holds in place during the entire day, awake or asleep.  I would recommend a size larger than what you wear, otherwise the magnet is under your wrist and you pick up anything metal under your arm.  Highly recommend - should be the standard band, in my opinion."
5.0,"Fits well, color is great."
5.0,"Super fast shipping.  I’m 5’2 about 120Ibs ordered small. Fit great. These are super soft much like to buttery soft-Align  LuLulemon  leggings.  These have a lot of stretch but they are not compression shorts. Cool breathable fabric.. Super comfortable, feel like they won’t become saggy but will keep shape. Also has large pocket on I side.. could fit my iPhone 11 and will stay secure. Great for exercise, yoga, running errands or just lounging around.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a comfortable legging type short."

5.0,All of my friends WANT this sooooooooooo bad
5.0,Bison Belts are literally the best.
5.0,"These glasses are a perfect fit. They are not too dark yellow, just the right tint to remove the road glare for night time driving while giving great definition of the roadway around you. I bought these as I have found getting older my eyes have become light sensitive on those dark two way roads where everyone seems to enjoy using either high beams or flood lights while coming from the opposite direction. These glasses relaxed my eyes and made my drive much more comfortable. I highly recommend this product."

I got so many compliments whereever I carry it. Size wise, not so big, but big enough to hold my wallet, my Galaxy S7 edge, makeup pouch, and small wipes packet. When I bought it, I knew the size and this was ok for me. I highly recommend it."
5.0,Prompt shipment. Good Quality. My daughter loves it.
5.0,Awesome pants will consider buying more if available in different colors.

5.0,"Super soft and comfortable shirt!  It fits well enough now, I just hope it doesn't shrink when washing because it definitely doesn't need to get any smaller!  I believe it was a &#34;one size&#34;...I am fairly average sized at 5'5&#34;, approx 140 pounds, and if I were any bigger, I don't think I would feel comfortable wearing it."

5.0,Haven't had these long so can't attest to durability. I purchased them for when I take my 3 year old granddaughter to McDonald's for lunch and to play on the playground. They protect her feet from the filthy floors and keep her from slipping on the playground equipment.
5.0,Definitely not disappointed in this purchase!
5.0,"very , very happy with my glasses"
5.0,"I had ordered 3 different bags and this is the one we kept. most compartments close by zipper (which the other bags lacked) which is essential to me. going to playgrounds etc nearly every day the bag sees abuse and often falls over. without zippers my stuff would be all over the floor.<br /><br />the bag itself seems to be sturdy enough to last for a while.<br /><br />also it is quite big compared to the bag we used before, I have much more space now."

5.0,"Love thr comfort , quality and fit!!!"
5.0,"I wear mine all the time! It's softer than I expected and it's really nice! Sometimes I do need to be careful I'm not showing too much cleavage, I'm a 36 DD and it fits great in that area and isn't too tight but can creep down to an uncomfortable level sometimes (especially with my kid always pulling on it.) If I'm in a sports bra and at the gym though, there is no problems!"
5.0,Quality product! Works great!
5.0,great for undershirts or for working out.
5.0,"Living in South Florida most of the year and spending time photographing mountain scrapes in the fall I need a variety of hats to protect from the sun or to keep my head warm. I found the Tilley collection fits my needs no matter the task. I just added the Tilley TWC5 Outback, It looks great with excellent fit and feel. I have wide and med brim with and without mesh, love them all but the Outback already jumped to the top of my favorites list."

5.0,"I love these gloves.  On a whim, saw a pair in a store and purchased.  They fit like real gloves instead of those mitts.  I've never ever found dusting so simple and not a chore.  I have 2"" wood blinds which I hated to dust.  Now I dust them more than I probably even need to because it's so simple."
5.0,"The rose gold has a coppery sparkle that is gorgeous. The clock face is large and clear. No second hand , but time is easy to read. Leather band is solid and well constructed."
5.0,Perfect for a simple halloween costume.
5.0,"These are great jeans - they fit true to size, though for a relaxed style, I was expecting them to be a little baggier. If I had gone a size up to achieve the baggy look I wanted, they wouldn't have fit in the waist. Great jeans though - a nice quality and great fit."
5.0,Excellent quality and beautiful
5.0,This is a great hoodie!! High quality!!

5.0,This shirt is thin and very breathable which is what I wanted. I normally wear a size Med and that's what I ordered. It is a bit more fitted than I like my workout tops
5.0,"This is a great case.  Nice and big.  I can fit my sunglasses and readers in the case at the same time. Sturdy construction prevents the glasses from being damaged. I just clip mine to my backpack, but there are others ways of attaching them."
5.0,As expected. Liked design. Will buy again. Fair price.
5.0,True to size. I got a lot of compliments. Colors are beautiful and vibrant.
5.0,"My 10 year old loved this because it seems and feels extremely real.  Not sharp at all, and made with 2 pieces, so not a realistic but that didn’t stop him."
5.0,"We actually use them as cat toys, and they work brilliantly!"
5.0,Wore dress to Octoberfest party. The dress (size L) was very snug around the rib area but the next size (XL) would be way too big. Overall very comfortable and would recommend it to others. Washes nicely too.

5.0,Great quality love the details on these shoes
5.0,"Good fit , very soft"
5.0,absolutely perfect!
5.0,"These were more comfortable than the other straps that I've used before. Not to mention how they fit my wardrobe perfectly with the design. The material is so light that you almost forget that they're on and they are really snug on the frames. These are perfect for one of those bright sunny days were you want to wear shades, but don't want to worry too much about keeping up with them."
5.0,"I liked the shorts overall but I ordered the blue camo shorts and the first one came with a hole in the rouching. I returned it, ordered another one and it has loose strings in the rouching that are coming undone. Not sure if it’s a defect with the size smalls. I’m reluctant to order it again because I just don’t feel like returning a third pair. But I am in love with the print.<br /><br />⭐️ UPDATE<br />I ended up ordering the third pair which came with zero defects. After months and months of use these are some of my favorite shorts! So happy I went for the 3rd try."
5.0,Ladies this is a must buy! I was nervous at first but the product is true to the pic! Thanks

5.0,My favourite necklace!!!
5.0,The best thing to do is to measure your head. I bought this hat back in 2017 and love it!

5.0,Es hermoso y la tela muy suave
5.0,Great replacement
5.0,Love my new watch band.  Easy to switch out fits perfection.  I love that it has extra links that can be removed to fit perfectly.  It is light weight and elegant to look more like a bracelet.  I highly recommend this band.

5.0,"Love love looove it! Fits very nice and is so cute! I was super nervous it was gonna be really cheaply made and a weird fit based off some other reviews. I’m usually in a size 2-4 range and it fit great. Also, read some review that people had some issues with the top have gaps between buttons, but it buttons just fit and no weird spacing or gaps on mine."
5.0,"Comfort, look."
5.0,I really liked this.  I'm prego and bought an in between size that I could wear before and after.  It will fit even better even I'm not pregnant and I still loved it.  I would probably buy it in other colors as the summer gets closer

5.0,really nice designs
5.0,"I love these dresses, and own a few in various colors. They are comfortable and look great paired with a shawl, a blazer or a lightweight cardigan. If you are curvy, some sort of control wear is necessary."
5.0,Nice material. Good stretch. “Bonded” hems instead of stitching so they don’t bunch and roll and rub between the thighs! Will definitely be buying more. They are a little long in the crotch so I told them over.

5.0,"Surprisingly well made with nice USN engraving. Exchanged for larger size. Definitely worth the low cost, very pleased with look."
5.0,I loved the ease of slipping my watch on and off with this watch band. It was also a cute accessory.
5.0,"Love, love these! The rose cold is a rich color. The finish is bright and smooth with no noticeable pits or bumps of the underlying metal. The studs are soft enough for easy adjusting and rounded so they don't poke the back of my ear. What surprises me most about these is how light and comfortable they are. No sore ear!<br /><br />The only real downside are the stones. They are very tiny and because they are difficult to see I can't really comment on the clarity and brilliance. They appear a little grey like junk diamonds, but again, it's hard to comment of the color. The stones are well set, and do provide a subtle sparkle to the beauty of the rose gold.<br /><br />My pair has a small defect in the curve of the laurel stem of one earring but it's much more noticeable in the photos than in real life, so I'm not subtracting any stars for that.<br /><br />*My rating is based on the product quality for the price point ($25)."
5.0,Just as adviced.
5.0,"Not as much black in and around the frames as I was hoping BUT coming from someone who does work in the eCommerces industry I know the Pictures and colors of the product can be a little different then what you receive, it's all has to do with the lighting and the monitors the picture of the sunglasses was taken on. So that being said I do LOVE THEM😍 and would Highly recommend these sunglasses to anyone. They also were delivered a few days early."
5.0,"Perfect condition, everything was accurately described. My son loves how warm it is. He has had it out in the rain and it kept him dry."

5.0,Love these socks! They are adorable and comfy
5.0,"Literally the best watch ever made, does 24hr time has a backlight and an alarm, day of week and date. Very easy to set, easy to rid under any conditions, battery lasts forever, it's waterproof, and it's hard to break. And if it does eventually break, what's another $10 to replace it?"
5.0,"I bought this years ago, loved it, kinda grew out of the style and fit and gave it to a friend. Bought the dark colored one and loved how comfortable it was so I bought the light colored one again and I love it again!!"

5.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size smaller.  It fits perfectly and helps keep my puffy nips less visible =)
5.0,Sooooooo cute and comfy for baby. She never really fought them and I received a ton of compliments on them “baby stunna shades.” Protected eyes very well. Excellent purchase!
5.0,great for the cool fall we should be having
5.0,It is even better than I thought.  Easy to use and very handy.
5.0,"Looks great, works fine with my Matrix Powerwatch Black Ops.<br />Taking pins out to shorten it is somewhat hard, though."
5.0,I was hoping that it would run a little large as my wrist was only a smidge bigger than the recommended length.  It was too tight on me.  I liked the product and there wasn't a size that would match up with my wrist so I had to go with a different band.  Great price though.
5.0,Such a beautiful choker!! Fits great and can be used in a dressing up or down situation!!!
5.0,Little thicker than most but soft and comfortable. Also does not fall over my head in downward dog.
5.0,Got perfectly
5.0,"Nice bodycon dress, have a little stretch to it. I ordered a medium however a large would’ve been better. Dress can be worn out to dinner or clubbing, very sexy."
5.0,Fit and serve well.
5.0,Very cute shoe. I need this shoe in different colors.
5.0,Amazon has helped me catch up with OPM. Thank you
5.0,i love them thank u
5.0,Love this 2 piece bathing suit. I followed the suggested size chart and I'm glad I did because the chart was correct.<br />The print is so pretty. Might even buy the other print as well.
5.0,I loved this dress! I got so many compliments on it. The material is nice and the dress fits as expected!
5.0,"Boy these Jean shorts fit like a glove. They’re nice and soft. Not that ruff scratchy Jean material. Another nice thing about these shorts is they stretch all in the right places and that’s a great feeling! The sizing is true. So I’m buying another pair 😍. These shorts go good with a tank top, t-shirt, sweatshirt and your baggy shirt! You can even dress up these Jean shorts and still look sexy!! Woohoo 🥰. Don’t be shy buy a couple. The more you wash them the better they look.  So ladies the price, the fit and softness is all right! I’m glad I bought them. I was so happy because I know they weren’t going back. Get them before they’re all gone!<br /><br />Happy customer!!"
5.0,Looks good but not exactly warm.
5.0,"I got two of these as alternative color straps for a Hamilton Khaki mechanical watch.  Strap replacement took less than a minute, and they work perfectly."
5.0,"I am pretty short, about 5' 1"", so this product was a bit too big on me. It went over my knees almost. But it is so comfy and adorable that I don't mind."
5.0,Love it! Ended up buying 2 options so far.
5.0,I purchased one pair of Wanderlust socks and a pair of another brand. Wanderlust wins hands-down. Excellent arch support; my legs and feet didn't get tired while wearing them. Swelling was minimal after a 12-hour day of flights. These are the only ones I saw on Amazon that can be machine washed AND dried. Air-drying compression socks takes a long time. So glad I bought these!
5.0,Beautiful so far very happy
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic for the price! I purchased this for a cruise coming up in a month- the fit is a little large as it is stretchy, but that is perfect for my purpose as I may not want to have everything be super tight the whole time."
5.0,"It’s a big wallet! It’s really nice, made of pretty good material. It looks classy but with a twinge of nerd, it’s great! I got it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend :) It came earlier than expected!"
5.0,gift for someone else
5.0,I have a toe that rubs funny when I trail run and leaves a painful spot in between my toes. I got these toe socks to help with the problem. I haven't used toe socks before and they do take a few times running with them to get used to them.<br /><br />These socks work great for my toe problem plus they are breathable. They fit well. I do wish there was a little more cushioning in the heel but otherwise these are perfect for warm weather running and hiking.
5.0,"I absolutely love this shirt!!! It is comfortable, the artwork is beautiful and it fits right. The only thing I would say is that because I am bigger in the chest the design can get a bit wonky. Maybe buy a size up if you would like to avoid that."
5.0,Fast and works
5.0,"Bought the bag for my son. The color is like the picture show, there are enough pockets for my son to pack his stuff and he likes the secret pocket on the back. He loves the bag."
5.0,"This arrived way sooner than expected. When I first opened it, I thought it was going to be too small but I was wrong. It fits perfectly! Adorable! I also really like the closure- no danger of this slipping off.  So excited and can't wait to wear it!"
5.0,Great colors and seem to be a quality product
5.0,Great addition of small useful flashlites!
5.0,Its very soft and fits perfectly! Highly recommend!
5.0,It taste so good and it look cool
5.0,Very beautiful blue.  Chain is okay but I can find a nice necklace.
5.0,These are wonderful as they have a case to put them in in-between uses.  I can hook the case on the strap of my purse and always have them available. Great product!
5.0,"Darling little bees earrings. Seem to be good quality. Nice and heavy, not cheap and hollow."
5.0,Excellent quality ring
5.0,Beautiful and soft
5.0,Beautiful & well made.
5.0,Great product. My baby is 2 and she loved it. Protected her from the sun while we were on vacation and it looked great. Good quality.
5.0,I love this! I got it for my 7 month old and it fits perfect! He has a bigger head and the other baby ones didn’t fit right. W doesn’t try to pull this one off!
5.0,It was a birthday gift for a friend… she loved it!!! During this time it was a HIT
5.0,Super cute sunglasses.  Bought them for my daughter and she loved them!
5.0,It's actually a lot more pretty than what the picture shows. I really like it.
5.0,"These aren't the most flattering  things. However they are very comfortable and breathable. I purchased to wear under skirts and they are great for that.... Not too tight and they don't hold on to moisture. Skirt slips right over them. I think they are silk or a blend at least. Runs very small. I have a 29 waist, 36 hip and got a XL"
5.0,Nice quality shipped on time
5.0,Liked wheel shoes fitness and quality.
5.0,I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and am very pleased with the quality of the fabric. The colors are beautiful; the fit is really good. I've since purchased another one in different colors. Will be purchasing more!
5.0,I got this to treat the cork soles of my Birkenstocks and the cork handles of fishing rods.  I've used it on the Birkenstocks and it works great.  Easy to use and does exactly what it's supposed to.  I have no doubt it will work just fine on the fishing rod handles too.
5.0,"My daughter likes the shoe so much , it fits just right , so soft and comfortable, also you can charge , it lights up when you walked"
5.0,A lovely touch of class. Perfect in every way.
5.0,These are great.  They fit well and seem a bit larger than another I tried.  It has five layers and seem fine... another one I tried with five layers seemed to cause me to breathe not as easily.  Overall a good mask.  They are NOT individually wrapped.
5.0,loved this necklace.
5.0,my husband loved it!
5.0,Nice material and fits true to size!!
5.0,"Bought the ring for a Slytherin-inspired look and it’s perfect! Sturdier than expected, it was actually kind of hard to adjust it because it’s so sturdy!"
5.0,A beautiful addition to my bracelet!
5.0,I bought this for my daughter at Xmas. I paid a little more than others I saw and I'm glad I did!! It still looks brand new!!!
5.0,Excellent product. I used them for my first Spartan race and they worked out perfect. They stayed in place never slipped down. Took them thru water and all kinds of terrain.  Legs never cramped the whole race!
5.0,"I got the XS size for my son.  He’s usually a 3 toddler in clothing.  He has 3T sized socks and these run larger than those socks.  It makes sense because these range from 3-5 year olds.  I got this for snow days and car emergency.  I always keep an extra outfit in the car.  I love that this comes with two pairs. One will be for the car, and one for inside.  The wool is not too thick but should keep him warmer than cotton.  Also they are tall so they will go up to below his knees.  The color is just like the photos.  Really cute socks."
5.0,I love this dress will be ordering other colors 😊
5.0,If you are looking for the perfect slimming pant - you've found it!!

5.0,Perfect fit. I am very happy with my new overalls.
5.0,son ideales para andar sin zapatos porque son gruesos
5.0,"So glad this purse showed up in things I might be interested in. As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. Since I was born in Chicago, it was just what I needed! And it was the last one! When I received it, I was not disappointed. Love that its recycled materials and it's very edgy! So glad I purchased it! Check out other bags from Myra Bags. They have some great bags!"
5.0,Love this ring.
5.0,I love these shorts.  They are not too short nor too long.  They fit as sized and are very comfortable to wear.  They have a nice compression feeling without being too tight.  They wick well and did not chafe even after I put in a 15 mile run in them.  Love the zebra print!
5.0,"Bought this for my college-aged daughter to wear to a 1920's themed party.  She loved it.  Very sparkly, and could be worn to a holiday party as well.  She liked it for the 1920s party because it had the feel of a flapper dress without being too literal."
5.0,Used for my 12 preschoolers! They are not flimsy but good quality!
5.0,"I wrote a review that was incorrect on these great No Show Socks, They fit perfectly and great quality sock..These socks stay in place and the size chart is accurate..."
5.0,Adorable dress.
5.0,"When I saw this dress I immediately fell in love.  I was skeptical about ordering online without trying on the dress first, but I went ahead.  When I finally got the dress, I was almost moved to tears.  It was very well made and fit exactly as I had hoped.  I can’t wait to walk down the aisle in this gorgeous piece.  Thank you Kevin’s Bridal!  I am one very satisfied bride-to-be."
5.0,Item is to long and not tight at all looks like a saggy bag.
5.0,Love this dress perfect for my cruise.

5.0,Love it.. very light weight. Comfy
5.0,it was ok what I had expected only warmer.
5.0,"Shipping was quick, arrived in a vacuum sealed bag. Super cute! Only issue is that the Unicorn caps are the only cotton caps. The other 4 are made in a smooth silky material and when i wore at work... sweat band or not... it made my head SO hot! So 4 star for that, 5 for the rest."
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised how good this bra is.  Very comfortable!!!  Well made!!  Great support!!  I have been wearing sports bras for a while now, feels great to have the girls back where they belong!!"
5.0,"Love this Dress!!! It’s more than what I was expecting, order size according to the size chart they provided and my measurements and it fits perfect can’t wait to wear it at my Soster wedding!!!!"
5.0,I took a chance because that product photo on Amazon was not the best. Had it sent to my daughter she sent me a picture and it was fantastic and<br />she really loves it. If she really likes it that's all that matters
5.0,"Very cute, well made."
5.0,"Absolutly love theses shoes! They are incredibly cute, very comfortable, and very well made. As soon as I got them I walked around the city for a few hours and they did not hurt at all like new shoes can... Loved them so much I ordered the matching cross body bag!"
5.0,The color doesn’t change. The weight of the earrings is not heavy on the ear.
5.0,Works Perfect!
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments when I wear these shades...Perfect fit, very sturdy, love the color and tint great protection from the sun. You can't beat the price and guality of these shades were made very well."
5.0,Nice size not to big!
5.0,I’ve had great luck with these cases on our iPhones. We just took them to HI and used these underwater for snorkeling and swimming. Not a leak the entire time
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE this suit! The bottoms cover everything they are supposed to and the top is very flattering. I have a large chest and I do feel this suit gives me the support I need (obvs its not a bra or anything but it works!) The print is very good and the quality is awesome! I will be buying more! :)
5.0,"I need another pair.  These are very comfortable.  Now, keep in mind that I am a 40-42 inch waist so what I said previously never happens to me.  I like the extreme classyness of these pants...along with the extreme casualness of these pants.  Perfect linen pants.  Best I have ever owned...and I have had several pairs!"
5.0,"This suit is darling. It does run small, & I didn’t order a size up. I’m giving it to my niece. I would order it again if it were still summer."
5.0,I'm really amazes how this fabric feels love it will buy another pair of pants
5.0,Super cute. I think my daughter will love this gift.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:8c53ec7c760c0b7914acbbfafc509990]] Realmente me gusta, lo uso para el trabajo es pequeño y no me estorba si se raya con golpes pero estas ni se notan.<br /><br />Tiene un buen diseño también se podría usar para salir casualmente se siente un poco fragil pero por el precio está bien, me gusta"
5.0,Great Price And Product
5.0,"Fits great, true to size. Very Comfortable as well"
5.0,"I love the fit of this sweater. It is soft, not itchy and is perfect for SoCal fall weather since it never gets too cold here. The color is very close to the photo so if you’re expecting red that’s not what you will receive. I was actually hoping for the color in the photo and was happy I decided to order it.<br />I am 180 lbs and ordered a Large. Fits perfect. TTS"
5.0,Beautiful Dangling tunnels. They are 100% stainless steel. I have slept in them and they have not tarnished. Love them and I have them in gold. Those I have not tarnished either.
5.0,"I bought this to wear to my son's Paw Patrol birthday party. Prior to finding this, I couldn't find any type of necklace that was appropriate! This came on time and was just as pictured. I love the large size!"
5.0,Love the bracelet looks just like the picture. I've been wearing it for 2 weeks now & there really hasn't been any discoloration.
5.0,"These are perfect! It was worth the wait for non-Prime delivery. I love that these are mostly cotton--they're super comfy and feel like they're good quality (have not washed yet though). Great for wearing with high-waist jeans or for adding a bit of sexiness to sweatpants around the house (boyfriend commented on this).<br /><br />Note on sizing: I normally wear XXS or XS in tops, but the small still looks fitted and not baggy. There's tons of room for stretch though."
5.0,My son loved his hat!
5.0,Excellent service and speedy delivery.  Very pleased with the quality and feel of this bracelet.  I have a relatively smaller bone structure but this bracelet fits and looks great on my wrist.

5.0,The necklace is lovely and elegant. I bought the 24 inch and would love to have a 36 or 54 inch one also.
5.0,Product is durable for everyday use!
5.0,awesome!
5.0,Snaps are the best
5.0,"LOVE this dress. It’s comfortable, flattering and fits perfect. I wore mine with a jean jacket because it was cold but straps were the perfect thickness and covered high enough on the sides. I will order more colors."
5.0,So beautiful on my twin girls for Christmas pictures!
5.0,Great fit and so comfortable
5.0,"Nice bag, lots of room, love the waterproof pocket for cell phone etc"
5.0,Love it. Durable.

5.0,"These Capri pants are a great quality material, the perfect amount of thickness. I'm 5'2&#34; and the end of the leg hit me right at mid calf. I will be ordering more of these!"
5.0,I like it and price is reasonable. Good alternative to face mask
5.0,Beautiful watch!
5.0,"I have many Kendra Scott pieces that I love and, I love her line, but have not purchased any KS in over two years, as her prices just keep rising.  If you want an excellent KS-type earring of high quality, these are for you.  I purchased the yellow/gold earrings.  They are substantial in weight, but not too heavy.  The earrings are made very well and look so much like the Kendra Scott brand.  They look very expensive.  Just a lovely earring for an excellent price.  Fast shipping and they are packaged well and come with a small, velvet bag to store your earrings.  I plan on buying several more pairs in lots of colors.  Note: the yellow is a very bright yellow, almost slightly neon under certain lighting.  You will be very pleased with these earrings."
5.0,Love this dress!! I am 5’4 230 lbs and the xxl fit perfect.
5.0,Great glasses. My son loves to wear them.
5.0,"Inexpensive, fits well and I am enjoying wearing it."
5.0,"love *LOVE* love these leggings they are awesome. Soft, comfy, I always get compliments on them!!!!!"
5.0,"Wow 🤩, I normally get it at one for 6.99. 4 for the price of 1 is a steal. Fit nicely on my  5, 7 yo"
5.0,"One pair of these lasts me a whole day of shopping, disinfecting, shopping, disinfecting, carrying, disinfecting.<br /><br />I have hand psoriasis so my hands crack and bleed if they get too dried out and Purel is Cruel.  So I love wearing these when I have to go out in the pandemic.  They don't easily rip open so they would likely do well for working on the car, or garden, or any activity when you need to protect your hands with skin-tight, gloves.  You can even type in them, but I don't."
5.0,excellent. i use for my twin's shoes. great idea and works super.
5.0,"Wow, wasn't expecting such a beautiful sweater!!  Great quality especially for the price...had to buy another ;-)"
5.0,"This is a very nice outfit. The material is thick and soft cotton, in colors my wife calls “cute” and “vibrant.” We’ve had many Hannah Anderson pieces before and have always gotten more than our money’s worth because the quality is top notch for children (and ours have lasted through hand me downs).<br /><br />It’s a long sleeve dress, with a diaper cover (which is ruffled). My wife is excited to see it on our granddaughter (who is yet a little small for it).  Glad to have it."
5.0,Beautiful skirt. My daughter wore it for her 5th bday party and it was a hit. Got so many compliments.
5.0,I use these shoes for work where I do a lot of walking so they were perfect

5.0,Nice two hole belt holding up well.
5.0,Great jacket. I added more bling to make it explode circus.
5.0,These are awesome as soon as I wore them for the first time I immediately ordered another pair! Was outside in 30 degree weather and they really blocked the wind out! My née favorite joggers
5.0,Beautiful and nice quality
5.0,Kinda short but I made them work
5.0,These are the best! Adjustable ear loops works so well. They adjust to fit my face or my husband’s face and we have very different size faces. That also keeps them in place so they don’t slip so easily.
5.0,I love this easy care fabric and the fit
5.0,"Just beautiful. This robe is soft, warm, and great to cuddle in a winter evening. It reminds me of the chenille I grew up with. Lovely design!"
5.0,Super cute! Just as expected! Love it!

5.0,Great quality. Pretty heavy for a little thing. Looks very nice
5.0,"Forcool makes great socks for active people. Somehow they are able to put special wicking in their socks that pulls moisture away from your feet so they stay dry. These active wear hiking socks even offer cushioned arched support. They would be great for hiking as the title description states. Forcool has created these colorful crew socks to wear all year round. I think they are cute and regardless the title stating these socks are for men, they are for women too. They are very soft to the touch and feel great on the feet. Also they are easily washed and dried and ready to go again. These are made extremely nice. Forcool socks are always worth the price you pay. One of my favorite brands."
5.0,Happy with quality and shipping!
5.0,I was reluctant to buy but so glad I did. I love it and the fit is perfect and flattering.
5.0,love this hat and cricket is my favourite game.
5.0,3 year old loves it.
5.0,"Great pair of water shoes that I wore both on vacation in the tropics, in the back yard, and cushioned enough to run around town with out heel pain."
5.0,Probably my 6th pair of Volatiles. Super cute n comfy!
5.0,The band fit very well. Had a few links taken out. I like it because it is a little dressey what you out.
5.0,Gift. Recipient loved it.
5.0,Excelent!
5.0,"I love the fabric of this dress. I am a taller woman so I was sceptical of the length but it turned out amazing. If you are a shorter woman, this dress will be kind of long on you."
5.0,"My husband 225lb, extra large fits him well and he says they are very comfortable"
5.0,I got these for my daughter and I. We can wear a reminder of each other when we are apart. Made well and feels nice to wear
5.0,I am 5'7&#34; and curvy. This dress fits perfectly.  The cotton is soft and smooth.  It doesn't present as a V-Neck though. While on the neckline is rounded but beautiful dress.  Buy your size according to the chart. I'm wearing a Medium.
5.0,"I bought this for a cruise because I wanted some sparkly! I read all the fit guidelines and ordered accordingly so it fit well.  The length was perfect for me, as was the neckline and the shoulder coverage.  I accessorized with a rose gold necklace and earrings and was out the door to dinner!  The best part was how many looks and compliments I received wearing such an 'easy' dress!  I felt fab!  For the price, I am impressed and really happily surprised with this dress."
5.0,Love the fit and design.
5.0,This watch is definitely classy. It looks so much better than the picture.
5.0,Nice masks for my girls ages 4 & 6. Great print designs that my girls like. 90% poly / 10% elastane makes it silky smooth but a tad slippery.
5.0,Quick shipping nice product
5.0,"My Honey is a big Marvel fan, so I randomly bought him these and some others. He was ecstatic. Great buy."

5.0,Comfy to wear. Great fit and great price!
5.0,"I used to be plagued with shin splints before I started using these socks. The compression sucks after long hours, but using these during running have gotten rid of my shin splint issues. There is minor difficulty removing the socks, but the benefit of wearing them outweighs this minor inconvenience."
5.0,Super flattering and easy to wear
5.0,We bought this and had to exchange it because I wasn’t careful when reviewing the sizes. We wear medium in most clothes because it’s 7/8 in the brands we get but this runs 10/12 as a medium so it was too big. It’s super soft and will be a great coat for school because it can easily be folded up in her backpack when she’s not wearing it.
5.0,I Love my nightgown! It's so soft.
5.0,"This dress was super cute! I got a Medium and the fit was just right. It also washes well in cold water. No fading, no fabric pills. I recommend!"
5.0,These fit a little larger than I thought. They are also long. Past the wrist. Other than that they are great
5.0,"Good material, seems like it will last. Print is quality. Happy so far."
5.0,Great dress.  Good fit.  Love it!
5.0,Fast service. A+

5.0,This bag is great for traveling!! Fantastic!!
5.0,Super comfortable. So far durable too. Had about 2 months now.
5.0,So plush and cozy. Super stylish yet comfortable to walk in without scuffing and shuffling.
5.0,This bag is perfect for what I needed it for and is built surprisingly well.
5.0,This bag is awesome! the colors are great and the size is perfect. weighs nothing so u can load it up and still isnt too heavy. The interior is not solid.
5.0,"Seems to be well made. Looks good. Fits well, I would speculate it is a 7.5” size.<br />Great alternative for guys to those beaded bracelets"
5.0,very nice dress i love it
5.0,"Akways pensive when ordering shoes online.  These are better than I hoped.  Fit perfectly, good arch support, comfortable."
5.0,Better than the similar Lulus I own and less than half the price. Need I say more?
5.0,"This mask fits well. Peripheral vision is shot as would be expected. Other than that, vision from the front is fine. While wearing it, breathing gets a bit difficult, just as the masks we have been wearing for the past two years do. With the appropriate outfit, this mask will make a great costume."
5.0,Kids size not for adults. Unless you like to wear kids size in public. If that's your thing. I gave them to my kids. They are using it.
5.0,She absolutely loves it
5.0,"Love, love, and love this dress. The quality and fittings are so beautiful and will recommend to every woman. I bought the whole four colors and will buy again if there is another color of it."
5.0,These work very well and are easier and less messy to use than silver polish.
5.0,"Great size, well made, holds phone with the case on."
5.0,TOASTY WARM
5.0,Love them! Got so many compliments on these. The only issue is some were way too big so I couldn't wear them at all. But my fingers are small (about a size 5) so it's understandable that I couldn't fit them all.
5.0,I loved the color easy to wear aren't heavy came fast would buy again
5.0,Looks great with pencil skirt
5.0,Dress fit great. Quality is great. I love it and will be wearing it for white night on our honeymoon cruise.
5.0,great fit & feel
5.0,"Love it!!!  Not only is it very figure flattering but also extremely comfortable,”.  Great price too!"
5.0,"I purchased other brands, these are the best so far.  They are much more comfortable to wear and fit well, especially if you have longer arms like me.  They protect as advertised.  I wore them on consecutive days outdoors, playing a round of golf on one day and watching a college football game the next, both times out in the sun.  No sunburn.  I just ordered another pair."
5.0,My wife has always been uncomfortable sleeping due to her cold nose. This item really worked for her.
5.0,Use for cycling - just the right layer for wind or when only a little warmth is needed. Love the visibility of the color.
5.0,"Me gusta mucho. Gracias y es para mi .! Cómodo, bonito y moderno ."
5.0,"My bracelet arrived on time, it is in perfect condition and is unbelievably beautiful and comfortable to wear!! I will recommend this site to anyone who will listen!"
5.0,Beautiful ring and I have added it to my collection
5.0,Very nice bag for the price.  Lots of compartments.
5.0,"Comfy, pretty, good quality and great price."
5.0,dad was well pleased
5.0,"When I read the reviews, I took a chance.  The fact that it was priced well didn't hurt.  I was thrilled when I received it.  The quality is amazing and you would not think that it only cost 8.00.  I am very happy about this purchase and will definitely order more - even if for a present."
5.0,"It's a little big and bold, but I like it!<br /><br />UPDATE: I removed the largest ring, now there is only two rings and its the perfect size, I wear it al the time!"
5.0,"Absolutely love this swimsuit coverup!!!!  It is beautiful, soft and a perfect fit!!  Definitely recommend!!!"
5.0,Love it. Worked perfectly in the heat !!
5.0,"This bracelet is of exceptional quality, and I love it.  I wear it every day with a few charms on it.  It can be worn with jeans, or it is dressy enough to wear in a formal setting.  I have seen other bracelets like it, but the quality of this one really stands out, especially when you consider the price."
5.0,Great fit.  So comfortable. I love the placement of the pockets.
5.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry that helps pain in the hand and wrist. My wife had to have it when she saw it, guess I'll have get one for me now!"
5.0,Fits nice for a larger person.
5.0,Used for a 14 yr old girl's dance costume. Was able to remove tail stuffing so it wasn't so bulky. Item came as expected.
5.0,Just got this dress and love the fit! I am still carrying a bunch of postpartum weight and this dress feels comfortable while still looking good. (The material is a little thick but I like that - it doesn't feel cheap or show anything underneath )
5.0,"Every single Christmas I long to find a solution for keeping my Wrapping paper all organized and tightly bound. This product fixed my problem perfectly! These slap bracelets are rubber and keep the paper still and from sliding around. It has made such a huge difference in my organization and Christmas wrapping sanity! I definitely recommend :) And my 3 year old likes to play with them too, so thats an added bonus as well."
5.0,"I read the reviews, ordered an XXL and it looks and feels great. It isn't super high quality but that's understood when you purchase a thin blouse for less than $20 from China. I wear a medium and wanted this flowy, forgiving, and comfortable. It's perfect for what I was looking for. This is my partner's account, I am female, 5'3&#34; and 140 pounds."
5.0,"Overall, I am very happy with this pants.<br /><br />I am riding with this pants at 50 degree F these days in Chicago with inner layer (comes with the pants) and a thin warmer pants underneath. In the past 2 weeks, I never felt cold for about 2 hours of riding at 50 mph. I do not know how hot it can handle, but I heard it can easily handle up to 90 degree F since it can be quite well ventilated. unless you are stuck in the traffic.<br /><br />In terms of size, my wasit 33.5 inches (actual measurement) and 30 inch seam (I am 5'9 & 167 lbs) . Size 48 fits fine although it is slightly tight around the belly area. Also, I cannot wear underwear shortie armor (with low back, tail bone, hip, thigh protecting pads) inside with size 48. I decided to try size 50."
5.0,Best sandals ever made. Been wearing Sensis since 1986. I have several pairs. They practically last forever.
5.0,"Exceeded my expectations for effectiveness. I owned Vuarnet sunglasses for the first 30 years of my life because they were the BEST. I just got these and met my brother who wears a very expensive brand and we both agreed these glasses succeeded in providing the best sun reflection. Very comfortable, fit well and my wife said I look really good in them. I'd buy them again and have recommended them to others already!!"
5.0,My son will ware them with is ear protection on
5.0,I was surprised as it's a decent boot the qualities decent and it definitely is in the comfortable side of things. I haven't been able to use them and anything extreme work for long periods is our weather just doesn't ever get bad enough. But it is definitely a boat I've been looking for 4 long time and definitely recommended it
5.0,"Nice, love it."
5.0,Fit true to size. So cute for Easter!
5.0,"i wear a XL in shirt but i bought a medium cause it fits tight.<br />Also if you sweat as much as i do. As strange as this sound i keep mind in the freezer, and no it does turn to ice.."
5.0,Cute charm bracelet
5.0,It look so good on me. This dress make brings my shape mach pretty. I plan to made a winter dress.
5.0,My son loves red and loves this shirt. He was excited when he seen it. Very happy with it and good quality. Will buy again.
5.0,"Super cute! they have enough stretch to be super comfortable, but not look cheap!"
5.0,"Great dress, very pretty!  Fit her very well. The workmanship in the dress was awesome.  Was so shiny."
5.0,This little bracelet looks very expensive.  I love it
5.0,These earrings are beautiful. Very happy with them
5.0,"Fantastic, prompt delivery and fantastic condition. It's my new everyday Sporran."
5.0,"Bought this for my mom, she wanted an extra large, but it wasn't available for one day shipping. So I got her a large which was a good thing consider it fit her perfectly, the quality is great!"
5.0,"I had a similar jacket to this one made by Lands End.  I used it so much during travels that it was looking pretty shabby.  I was very happy to find this jacket that will suit my needs for storage while on the go locally and especially during traveling. I'm 5'10"" and 182lbs and the large fits me very nicely. This jacket reminds me a bit like an Army GI jacket but much classier and much lighter weight."
5.0,"Just received this in today and it's VERY soft and fits to size (I wear size 14/16 and I ordered an XL).  The bunching at the bottom helps hide my larger-than-I-like belly.  I was worried the V neck would be a bit revealing since I'm an F cup and anything that shows a little cleavage on a more average chest size looks like I'm trying to sell something more than is legal in most states.  But fortunately, it's modest with a respectable amount of bust showing.  I'm a very happy customer."
5.0,Very pretty gift for my granddaughter she loved it
5.0,This dress is beautiful! Fits perfect. I ordered a small and it was a prefect fit and gave my curves a bit of an appeal. I will order more.
5.0,Great boots!! Very comfy and pretty!! Fits perfectly as expected. I usually get a UK7 and was advised to go up a size for the fabric boots as they do not stretch. Correct!! They fit perfectly!!
5.0,I love this nightgown.  It's pretty and comfortable.
5.0,So soft and warm
5.0,Best value. Got way better quality than what I was expecting at this price. Very happy with my decision to buy this from Sojos.
5.0,I got these leggings for my wife. They’re a great fit and they’re colorful!
5.0,If my dog can attack this watchband and have it still survive it is an awesome watchband
5.0,Perfect for our family trip to Disney for my mom's 80th. A big hit throughout the park. Lightweight enough to keep on all day.
5.0,Love PB! The quality and feel of the fabric is awesome and for the price too is a good deal!!  I only tell some of my friends about it though because I like some of the unique styles and I love to stand out with unique styles that fit my personality. It’s my little secret that I only share with a select few lol I get so many compliments on all the tops I have from PB!
5.0,"Cute socks, nice fabric"
5.0,"I have purchased several chains from this company, and I could not be happier.  They have a very fine and delicate silver look, and they add class to anything you wear.  LOVE IT"
5.0,Soft and fits true to size
5.0,"Doctor Who is my new favorite addiction so when I saw these earrings I had to have them. I wear them all the time, they are light and easy to put in. For as often as I wear them I haven't had to clean them yet and there is no sign of tarnish or color distortion like I get with some earrings. Super fast shipping and well packaged. Will order from this seller again. Thank you."
5.0,"The sides of the glasses are different from the picture, but they are still very cute and secure without being too tight. Excellent quality and not expensive."
5.0,I wore this all night and it stayed in place great and didn't show up at all in pictures. I'll probably only re use it one or two more times but I will definitely buy it again.
5.0,I bought this for my niece to cosplay halloween as chibi moon. love them but a little bigger than i expected. more for an adult or teen as far as size. reguardless she loved them and looked so cute!
5.0,"Good Item, Good Price, Great Speedy Delivery!"
5.0,The top fitted as expected. I Ike the style and fit
5.0,Beautiful!!!! My sister will love it!!!!
5.0,I wore the dress on Halloween with a leotard top and received many compliments.
5.0,Holding up well so far! The silicone is soft and moves well with my wrist while working out. Also goes well with day to day clothes.
5.0,Extremely comfortable and great for working out. Always getting compliments at the gym about the color too!
5.0,We love this leotard!
5.0,Very happy with the shirt that I ordered as a gift for my grandson
5.0,I Love this bag. The colors are so vibrant and it goes with everything..
5.0,"I received this is less then a week.  It was nice and long, I'm 5'11 and it came to my toes. I wear a 12/14, have more booty and hips and I ordered the XXLarge. I bought it as a costume but will definitely wear it as normal beautiful dress too."
5.0,Love them great price very affordable and good quality
5.0,Super cute bat costume. I bought one for my husband and it wasn’t cute like this one. The face was weird but this one was cute. The costume was super comfy and soft! I wore with converse and pulled the legs up a little bit so they were a Capri style. Added Cuteness!!
5.0,"My employer is mandating masks again. 😳<br />These face coverings are perfect. No one can tell that my 'mask'  is one layer of mesh.  I've passed the manager, coworker and customer tests. Best of all, I get tons on compliments on my 'mask'.<br />I can breathe. My face doesn't overheat or get covered in sweaty-breath-swampy-slime.<br />It's a bit scratchy, not too bad.<br />Overall, great purchase."
5.0,This is my favorite dress. I bought an XL The material is comfortable with some stretch. I am 5'3 and the length is just right at my ankles. I have a large chest and it fits very well not tight at all. The pattern is pretty can be casual or dressed up. Love the pockets too!
5.0,Normal socks
5.0,Estás bien bonito igual k el imagen
5.0,Absolutely love it easy to wear and very comfortable
5.0,"I purchased this dress for an outdoor wedding.  Fabric is soft.  It’s light weight and cool but not see through.  Fits nicely and is very flattering.  If you’re bigger in the chest area,  I’d recommend wearing  a Cami or tank  under."
5.0,"I bought this for my 7 almost 8 year old boy. He's 50 inches tall, about 50 lbs. It's a good fit height wise and has wiggle room for height growth over time. He's on the skinny side, so a size 6 7 in terms of width. This costume has plenty of room gut wise if your child is wider.<br />My son is very happy with this costume. Has a decent costume hat, an eye patch, and a sash. He isnt' thrilled about the sash, but I think it's a great addition and is big enough to be tied around the waist, or draped over the wasitband and safety pinned, depending on your kid.<br />I think the material is good, feels on the soft side, not rough cotton. The boots and pants are one complete item. The vest has velcro in front, doesn't button. The black belt thing over the chest also has velcro for the bottom part to attach to velcro.<br />I bought this for pirate day at my son's school."
5.0,I loved everything about it and I will be getting one more color soon.  I am petite so the length is perfect for me!
5.0,Very good quality frame for a reasonable price the size was perfect it's very rare sometimes to find the right size in stores plus the prices are higher I was able to get this frame for my husband after he got his measurements from trying similar frame at a local store which was 100 dollars higher. .. very happy and satisfied with the purchase of these frames now my husband can feel more comfortable wearing them while they still look stylish and cute . Thank you
5.0,Everything met my expectations fit and comfort was great
5.0,I lovIe the quality.  They go with everything.  They would really be perfect for someone that has multiple piercings..
5.0,"It’s been over a week since my toddler has been using the bag so not sure about the quality. However, the material def looks durable and sturdy. A cute bag for my four year old. Got the small and it fits him just right, if not a bit bigger. Holds many items including snacks, coloring activities, an iPad and a water bottle. The zipper pocket in the front comes in handy as well for small items. The small version does not have a side pocket for bottles though."
5.0,"I get lots of compliments on these earrings. The stones were a pale gray almost blueish color. My ears are generally very sensitive and most earrings hurt them, however these are just fine and don’t irritate them at all."
5.0,Better than expectations<br />loved them so much
5.0,"Great price,good quality"
5.0,Pense que el jabón era una botella más grande pero esta bien al menos recibí lo que esperaba..!
5.0,"The quality is very good, nice silk.  Good color selection too and many can be used on either side, giving even more color options.  They are smaller than traditional pocket squares, but still do the job just fine."
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous.  The power cord from the last light is about 2-1/2 feet long.  We had a USB adapter plug, plugged lights into the adapter and plugged it right into the wall.  We had 3 plant hooks already above the window and just draped them over those hooks!  The tricky part is unraveling them so they don’t get tangled.  Having 2 people was perfect. Took 2 minutes to unravel, 2 minutes to hang! Absolutely perfect and beautiful.  Well worth the $28!!"
5.0,This is a well designed wallet that works for both men and women. This particular model made with basketball leather is extremely durable. I bought one for my husband 4-5 years ago and it still looks brand new.<br />I bought another one for his son. He was thrilled.<br />They both are very hard on their wallets so this special leather is perfect for them.
5.0,A bit small but works
5.0,Perfect women's all weather coat.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"I bought this dress in size medium and it fits perfect! My weight is 137lbs and I am about 5'7 in height and it almost hits right to my knees when standing (which is a perfect length for me). The dress couldn't fit more perfect! It came wrapped in a nice package and the fabric on the dress is nice and thick. It has darling heart buttons down the front with a cute sash belt (with the option to leave off if you want, since there are no belt loops attached to the dress). The dress is darling!!! It is definitely one of my favorites!!!!"
5.0,What can i say I can't wait till I go fishing well made love all the pockets I just wish they made inside pocket but other then that well made thanks 8 fans 👏 and thanks for the waterproof phone case
5.0,Thus watch was a replacement for a similar looking watch that had finally broken after years of use.  I like this style because it goes with almost everything that I wear and is dressy without being too extreme and therefore can be worn everyday.
5.0,"Excellent shirt, look great, fits perfect. I recieve many compliments"
5.0,These on my wife’s favorite capris. She has many other name brands but this is her favorite.
5.0,These are my new fav pair of pants. Wash dry wear. Comfy stylish and easy.
5.0,Perfect for what I was looking for. Washed and wore it and no issues. It replaced by 5 years old gown and hopefully it can last me another 5 years..
5.0,MY SON WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT QUALITY IS VERY GOOD
5.0,"Love it, I will buy green and black :-)"
5.0,Gave as a gift for niece’s 50th Birthday. She loves it! Great quality and looks more expensive than price.
5.0,"Love it. Had to cut off a little of the top part of the plastic bag, it was just too long would constantly hit the tip of my ear. Other than that it's super cute."
5.0,The pajamas were so cute and fit as expected. My daughter absolutely loves them.
5.0,"These earrings are so stunning! The quality is really nice, the post is sturdy and they have a nice backing on them. I experience a lot of allergies in my ears but I can wear these earrings and not have any issues. The pictures shown don't do these earrings justice!"
5.0,Fun bracelets. I wore at beach and in ocean and held up great. Very fun to interchange with various outfits. Great for summer fashion.
5.0,"Okay, looks a little cheap, but they will do."
5.0,"I recently purchased these &#34;VOX Women's Polarized Sunglasses Designer Fashion Rhinestone Vintage Floral Eyewear With Free Microfiber Bag&#34; in BLACK because I was wanting a nice pair of polarized sunglasses that were a little more dressed up than the usual ones I find.<br /><br />My initial impression was very positive! The sunglasses are well made, the design and accents are lovely and the lenses work exactly as they are supposed to.<br /><br />I sometimes find it difficult to find sunglasses which fit because I wear in between an adult and children's size, but these are actually a little snug. They are not uncomfortable by any means and actually fit tight enough that the sun does not show through around the frames, which I really like.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase, I love these sunglasses and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fashionable pair of polarized sunglasses.<br /><br />This product was received free and/or at a discount for my unbiased review. All opinions are my own and are based on the product as it sells for retail value."
5.0,"This dress is well made and flattering but would look better with heels or on a taller person. I am about 5'3&#34;. It is hard for me to find clothes that is flattering because I am a curvy girl too but this looks even better than I had anticipated even with my height, width and length of the skirt. Happy with this purchase over all so I would recommend to others."
5.0,Exactly what we wanted and my daughter loves it. Fits great and seems like good quality so she should be able to wear it awhile.
5.0,Worked out great for Kentucky Derby party. Next year I will order more.
5.0,Runs a little big but my husband loved this for father's day
5.0,Great price<br />Great quality
5.0,I LOVE this dress for the hot summer months!! It fits beautifully and the small size is great for us petite girls!
5.0,The band has a nice thickness with a buckle that matches great with my rose gold watch.  Fits great on my small wrist.
5.0,I am really pleased with the earrings and I get a lot of compliments on them.  They are easy to put on and they are really cute.
5.0,"Purchased these because I was sick and tired of forgetting my bags for the store. I took the bags and their reinforcement out, assembled and then put them back in the pouch they came in. Their home is in my trunk and are orderly and easily accessible when needed."
5.0,"Just as described, if not better! Lightweight and cute."
5.0,It keeps me warm when I’m out doing my 5 mile walk in 18° weather😊
5.0,Product delivered quickly. Fit was as expected. Quality material. Will definitely order again!
5.0,"Wish there was a way to thank the people who did the actual work to make this mask. The fabric was expertly cut with four full turtles on the front (none cut in half or missing heads or flippers) and stitched together beautifully. Thank you, whoever you are! It fits well, looks great, and will be a lot of fun to wear."
5.0,"Nice, pretty, as described"
5.0,These really helped with feet no longer being in so much pain at the end of 8 hours of standing.
5.0,Very cute and comfy. Nice and cool to keep the night sweats away
5.0,easy fit. good seal.
5.0,It's what I was looking for
5.0,Lors if glitter my granddaughter loved them.
5.0,"Ordered and wore as a last-minute wedding dress for a small, intimate wedding, and it exceeded expectations! I've had so many compliments on my wedding dress/pictures, and nobody can believe it was such an inexpensive Amazon Prime dress! The material and fit is stretchy and forgiving of extra pounds and curves and very flattering despite my not being in my best shape! Romantic, great length, would work well for a variety of heights (I'm 5'2""), sizes, and shapes. I love the 3/4 sleeves and pretty neck line (I had a friend add a couple of stitches at the bodice for modesty). I ordered 2 dresses hoping one would work. The other one (sent back!) didn't even come close to the quality and classiness of this dress."
5.0,Warm but a little bulky. Can’t do much with your hands while wearing them
5.0,"I am so obsessed with this bag! Great quality and way bigger than I expected! It's not as shiny as the pictures make it look, and I get compliments on it all the time. My Mom even ordered one after seeing it, so now we're twins!"
5.0,"Pictured as exactly what you see, nice green color and cute animal face."
5.0,Son hermosas para regalos
5.0,My very favorite socks. So cozy.
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01HERGHQC Mrignt Mens Short Sleeve Slim Fit Henley t-shirt with Button (XXL, Black)]] I ordered this shirt for my husband.  His favorite casual cut is a Henley so he has several.  Why would he need another? Most of his others, frankly, look like thermal underwear.  That’s what attracted me to this -- it’s a dressier version that he could wear with his khakis.  The v-collar helps dress it up a bit too. The material has a nice sheen to it without being Jimmy Wah’s Shiny Green Suit.<br /><br />He tried it on as soon as it arrived and was delighted. He has a 48” chest so I ordered the XXL.  Shoulders were a dead-perfect fit.  Waist is a little loose, which I wasn’t expecting with a slim fit, but it doesn’t billow or fold.  He said it was cool and comfortable (this review written in a hot and muggy August).  The buttons are purely decorative, but at this price point I don’t expect much.  There are no care instructions. It’s come through a permanent press wash just fine.  Husband is happy, I like how he looks in it, and we can’t argue with the price.<br /><br />I disclose that I received a discount on this item for review. I am not affiliated with the seller or manufacturer."
5.0,Look and for great i hope they hold up in the wash
5.0,I received so many compliments on this dress. I love how soft it is and the fact that it has POCKETS!
5.0,Thought the pink would be a lighter shade but still cute!
5.0,Fit perfect<br /> Love them.
5.0,It fits my XS MAX many pockets
5.0,Love it! You have to slide the middle to put it in but it doesn't turn around on you. Very pretty!
5.0,Soooo cute and flattering make sure to read sizing charts and you're in business<br />We have same dress in black must haves for sure!!
5.0,"I absolutely love these pajamas.  These are SO soft.  I have already purchased in other colors.  They wash beautifully on delicate setting, and I dry them in the dryer on delicate.  I am 5'5"" and weigh 185 lbs.  I bought a 3x and they fit great.  By the way, the construction of these PJs is excellent.  A++++"
5.0,This is my 4th Red Kap Shirt. Very nice and durable.
5.0,These are very nice sunglasses.<br /><br />They fit my face well and I like that the lenses will adjust based on the brightness
5.0,Bought as gifts to split between my granddaughters. Very cute!
5.0,Love love
5.0,"Love this suit! Fit really well, super comfortable and well made!"
5.0,Excellent quality and beautiful!!
5.0,The fit is perfect and I am happy with this.
5.0,Nice watch band and case for the Fitbit Blaze.  It fits perfect and I haven't had any issues with it.  I like it a lot and it was a great price.
5.0,"This is short I will say if you have some booty, but I always have that issue with skirts. This is so soft and super stretchy. I walked around in it and didnt have to pull it down or anything. Great color, exactly like the image"
5.0,I love wearing purple items it make me happy
5.0,"Love my scarf, not too heavy or too light.  Long enough to wear in different ways, and very colorful.  Provides a different flair to my many coats and jackets. In fact it is a turn to scarf when I can't make up my mind which of my many scarves to wear."
5.0,"Given as a gift, but she seemed very pleased."
5.0,Cute but needed to add some glue to the sides so inside cushion for glasses would stay put.
5.0,My 4 year old granddaughter loved this necklace.  It is well made and her age bracket is really into unicorns now.  It is also a locket.  She is excited to put someone's pictures in it.  I would highly recommend this locket!!!!
5.0,"These are yet another stunning pair of KS earrings. I was a little perplexed with the online image and wondered how true it was to the actual earrings. It turns out the online image is pretty accurate and not exaggerated at all. The brown mother of pearl reflects different colors depending on the light; brown, peach, rose, green, clear and even a tad bit of grey. In addition, each color that it reflects also comes in various hues. The brown for example, is not uniform...The brown is lighter in some parts and darker in others. Its a truly spectacular mélange of reflections that coordinate beautifully with each other. The rose gold plating is a perfect match for this pair that predominantly lets out brown and peachy hues.  These earrings are versatile in that they willl go with any color you want to wear. They also look dressy enough for a classy event yet can also be worn in a casual setting. While KS' famous signature Danielle earrings come to 2.5 inches, the Alex earrings come a little shorter to around 1.75 inches (including the top-most part of the hook). They are overall very sturdy and well-crafted. Unlike the Danielle earrings that are a bit heavy, the Alex earrings are rather light and far more comfortable and feasible for ladies with sensitive ears. If you like brown mother of pearl and classy earrings and you're looking for something lighter than the Danielle earrings, you will love these. Lastly, the packaging was a sight to behold. They were beautifully wrapped in the popular KS sky blue pouch and then also bubble-wrapped for extra protection. I was excited like a little child to unwrap each pair of exquisitely packaged KS earrings. 5 stars."
5.0,I've been wanting another pair of these for a while so I could cuff both ankles and wrists at the same time. They're very nice cuffs and pretty much exactly the same as my previous ones.
5.0,Our 11 year old Granddaughter was so completely happy with getting felted Jammies. Would recommend this product and I may buy more.
5.0,Super cute for the price! But is very short
5.0,"Wonderful necklace, very different piece.  I lov it and have had many comments on this necklace"
5.0,Bought a pair in 9/16 and they fit perfect! Great quality for a good price.
5.0,"I made the mistake of sizing up, after reading some reviews that it ran small.  The next size up was too big; I should have bought it TTS.  I went to return it, but they didn't have the color/size in stock that I needed, so I instead opted to keep the larger one and have it altered.  I love this dress!  Great color and super cute."
5.0,This dress is absolutely gorgeous!! The material is great and it is also pretty stretchy! I would highly recommend this dress for anyone who is looking to feel sexy
5.0,Super cute. Comfortable.
5.0,"Of every ring I have purchased, this is by far the best. The fit, width, and size is great. I used to switch between my wedding ring and a silicon band, but now this is all I wear."
5.0,"This brooch style necklace is a beautiful product, I am very excited to wear it."

5.0,"These are durable secure fitting muffs that feel well made and should last for years. The set adjusts to fit multiple sized heads and fits comfortably. Each ear muff has its own electronics and control knob which is nice for adjusting per user (as some people have unbalanced hearing). The case is a nice bonus, and will serve well in protecting the set."

5.0,My son seen this online and just had to have it. I thought it was really cool. But my hubby thought he was going to look to girly in it but he was wrong. It took a little longer then expected to get here but I believe that it was due to the post office not the company. The only thing is that if your one of them that don't like the kind of material that is like work out cloths then you may want to pass it up. But that's my fault for not checking what it was  before I got it. The overall quality of the graphic picture is amazing

5.0,Love Love this glasses
5.0,"I've probably bought, idk, seven pairs of these arm warmers? Just ordered three more to get to that total. I'm hooked on fingerless gloves because my hands are often cold but I want my fingers free for being on my computer at work or my iPhone or iPad at home. These arm warmers are my favorite, though. And frankly, they're reasonably priced enough that just like the fingerless gloves, I'll wear them for awhile, get so many nice comments on them that I give them away, then have to order more lol. After wearing them, when they get dirty I just throw them in the laundry (I've learned to put them in with my towels - no fabric softener), and they're good to go. How can you beat that??  Love, love, love these!!"
5.0,"This babydoll lingerie is seriously the cutest! Though it’s one size, it’s stretchy and long enough to fit a variety of sizes imo. I’m usually an XS and this fit well although a little loose. The mesh fabric is delicate but sturdy. The off shoulder ruffle detail is honestly so flattering. I cannot recommend this enough!"
5.0,"This was a little tighter than my husband was expecting, but he was still able to wear it. Purchased for a Halloween costume and it did well."
5.0,"I'm a size 18 and purchased this dress for my 25th wedding anniversary party. The sleeves were way too long (came almost to my finger-tips). Since I had to get the sleeves hemmed, I shortened them to my elbows since I live in Texas. The result was perfect. I received many compliments."

5.0,love these turtlenecks. very soft and comfortable

5.0,Unique and affordable gift.
5.0,It is exactly what I was hoping for.  I love it.
5.0,AMAZING! Wow what an awesome made product! Love it
5.0,"Skeptical to buy clothing off Amazon , but I’m glad I did this time ! This dress fit perfectly, and looked so adorable . True to size . The fabric looks expensive. Absolutely happy with my purchase."
5.0,"These are great! I did get a run pretty quickly on one pair because i was too careless - I tried pulling the sock up from the hem without first pulling in completely onto my foot.<br /><br />The designs are simple and classy. Little hearts and other small things, very cute.<br /><br />These socks have never slipped. The top is a little tight, but not in a painful way. They leave an indent on your calf.<br /><br />I found that my shoes squeak when i wear these. It's weird, and I'm sure its because of the plastic sole of my shoes (some foamy plastic). It was actually kinda embarrassing because it sounded like little farts. So, I wear a pair of footy socks under these socks and it fixed the problem."
5.0,Ordered 2 sizes up after reading the reviews. It fits as advertised and is really cute and comfortable. If they made it in other colors I would buy them.
5.0,Love them!! They fit great!!
5.0,"Good quality and very attractive. I hate wearing suit coats to work, so wearing a light sweater with an Evelot upgrades my work style."
5.0,"This is an excellent RFID blocking wallet, it's stylish and sturdy. I love it cause its easy to pack around and hold a lot.<br />DISCLAIMER - I have received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review this has not in any way, shape, or form caused me to change my views, ratings, or comments upon this product nor do i feel like i must give this product a good rating, this is absolutely my own view and rating of the product and my own absolute honest written review of the product.

5.0,Lovely..very good material and true to sizem
5.0,Quality is very good and looks very nice. You can fit many cards and it can still fold properly which is not always true for other wallets I bought before.
5.0,picked because we just got back from paris and am making my daughters cham bacelets to rememeber the trip by.
5.0,"Love this skirt! So flirty and flowy. I'm 5'2.5&#34;, size 0 and got a small. I folded over the stretchy waist band to shorten it and snipped out the tag. I still had to be careful not to trip when I walked but it was not obnoxiously long. Unfortunately my skirt came with a very long pulled thread, but I got it for a party that was the day after it arrived and wore it anyway. I think the pattern helped camouflage the pull. This skirt can be dressed up or worn casual. The fabric is so soft to the touch. I felt so pretty in it. I can't wait to wear it again."
5.0,Gorgeous bracelet! I love the tone of the rose gold! It’s pretty delicate but I have not broke it yet!
5.0,Not sure if the 'healing properties' of stones have any real truth to them. But I know Dan is the man!
5.0,"This mask is really good. It holds the form or shape really well. Yes, its a little hard to look through it, but well.. its fixable. The color is exactly as the pictures, I like it very much. And it doesnt smell so much"
5.0,Gorgeous!!!
5.0,"Sweet Rose is the one I received as a gift. It is large and very well made. It's holding up much better than the cheap ones I've been using.  The grocery checkers admire it every time. I like it for the sturdy  quality, the baggers tend to pack it heavier than I care to lift. Going to buy several as gifts, now."
5.0,My daughter loves this watch. It is everything she read about. Delivery was quick and the watch functions properly.

5.0,Product was just as described and fit my little boy perfectly for his Taco Twosday Party 😀
5.0,I fell in love with this dress when I first saw on the website. The shipment was really fast and I could put myself into this dress very soon after I ordered.<br /><br />I'm 5&#34;3 and 115. I chose Small size which gives me a little room but not too much! It's super comfy and I didn't feel itchy which I sometimes do with certain fabric materials.<br /><br />I get so many compliments with this dress whenever I wear. It makes me look gorgeous and elegant at the same time.<br /><br />I'm thinking of getting one in a different color!
5.0,Wow what a bang for ur buck my husband love them so classy
5.0,"This hat is so warm! I have to say that when it arrived, I was SHOCKED by the quality of this product. It really is superb and will last you for a while. It doesn't get cold enough here in Alabama to wear it often, but when it does it does its job of protecting my head and ears from the cold."
5.0,"These sunnies far exceeded our expectations. Our son will not take them off. We are particularly impressed with the flexibility of the arms. Also, these are packaged with a cleaning cloth and bag like adult sunglasses. We are thrilled."
5.0,"This is a very flattering dress, considering that it is so form fitting.  The sizing is spot on and the color pops!"
5.0,"Wow, what a difference riding my bike.  I'm not a cyclist to be sure, but these shorts made me understand how you could be - much more comfortable than even gel bike seats (which I have) and a fleece cover over that!<br /><br />If you want to just try a lower cost padded bike short - these are the ones!"
5.0,Can’t wait to wear this cute dress.  I’m pairing with skinny crushed velvet skinny pants.

5.0,Good footing and material
5.0,"Gorgeous and sturdy. The labeling implies they are half-rims with the base sheer glass (like tri-mounts). Not true--there is a metal rim at bottom. But the rim is very thin, and these are the most beautiful half-rims you will find without spending $180+ for Jimmy Choo frames."
5.0,Fits perfectly!! Lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,Loved the color and well made
5.0,"Very nice, the earrings look really cool"
5.0,"Beautiful Fabric, Fits So Good. Hangs Lil Big But Loose N Comfy. Im 5.4 147 and ordered a large. Probably a medium would have been good. Looove ordered another in a different color."

5.0,Beautiful chain sturdy enough to hold the weight of a heavy pendant.

5.0,This was better than I expected.  Love the engraving on both sides and plenty of room inside for both of my business cards.  VERY pleased with purchase.
5.0,This sweater is beyond comfy and fit true to size. I love the pockets on the front which are perfectly sized to hold my phone. It’s very well made and would definitely make a great gift. I think the style is such that it could go over a dress or be paired with a t-shirt and jeans.
5.0,"Alright, short but quick review. This product is from China, however, it is of a highly satisfactory quality.  I ordered a medium, i'm 5'5 with an athletic swimmer's body and it fit perfectly.  You can see thorough the white mesh quite well, and it has a zipper near the crotch so you can take a piss, which is great for a skin suit. And it does fit tight.<br /><br />I'll be wearing this to many convention and halloween parties. Or whenever."
5.0,I like it. My wife is like
5.0,It was a Christmas present for my boyfriend & he absolutely loves it!!
5.0,I really love this earings!!! I absolutely recommended.
5.0,"Let's be honest, the dress is about $25, my expectations were low. I purchased because I bought another for 2x as much on modcloth and loved it, was thrilled to see the same style here. In all, I actually like this one more than the more expensive one!<br /><br />The cloth is mostly cotton and feels like it, the drape and softness is very nice. It feels like thick cloth, while unlined it's not worrying me for see-through-ness. The zip up the side is smooth and not uncomfortable. I'm 140 and 5'6 and the M fits me perfect, even with possible shrinkage. I'm optimistic that if I lost weight it will shrink a bit with me :)<br /><br />Want to buy in all the colors.<br /><br />Beware though, the pics for the green make it look lime green and it's really more of a medium/forest green. Still bright, just not as bright in the pictures."
5.0,Got this swimming suit for my mother.  It fitted her gorgeously and the flare-ness of the suit really helped covering up her waistline.  The suit also came with 2 sets of push-up bra cups to give us more choices in term of sizing the bust.
5.0,Love the material. Cute top.
5.0,Very soft. True to size with large pockets. Hope they wash and dry well.

5.0,The earrings are so cute! They came as described. The backing comes with two holes so you can wear them higher or lower
5.0,"The band was slightly big on me so I had to remove 5 links. Not that hard just need something extremely flat (i used a box cutter blade), pliers and tweezers. Took me about 30 minutes. Fits really well."

5.0,This is soo cute and really original. It really does look like the heart of the ocean neckles from titanic. Its alot smaller tho. It's not cheap looking either. The only downside is that from afar it looks like a circle. But other than that its perfect! Shipping was faster than expected.
5.0,"Wish that I had it last more than 3 weeks, product was fine...loved it but, 3 wks. after putting my keys on it the chain holding the key ring separated, is there any way that we could work out an exchange? I really like the key ring!"

5.0,The embroidery is amazing in its detail and I have received many favorable comments.  Quality materials used as well.

5.0,"My daughter loves them. They have a bunch of modes which I wasn't expecting and they hold their charge for a long time. I bought a larger size because another review said that they run small. Not accurate, hers are too big. But she doesn't mind and she will be able to wear them longer."
5.0,"My wife purchased 3 of these for me and I love them! The fit is perfect, the quality is good and they keep me warm on a cold day. For the price a really good buy! Thanks to my wife and thanks to amazon."
5.0,"Love this purchase!  Fits nicely, quality is great and it wears well!5"
5.0,"This top is great and comfortable it has lots of 3X room and it is not clingy. It stays in place and if you wash it inside out it will last forever,  the material is soft and it does not wrinkle."
5.0,"I was skeptical about buying this at first due to the reviews. I am not disappointed at all with this purchase. This jacket is similar to the Zara<br />double-faced jacket but a lot cheaper. The fur is soft but beware it does shed at first, nothing a lint roller can’t fix. The texture overall is mate and soft and does not look cheap like you would think, it doesn’t have the cheap leather look so no worries. For reference, I got a small one. I am 5’5 and 119 and fit perfectly."
5.0,Cute.  Dainty. Comfortable
5.0,Perfect for yourself or as a gift
5.0,This works as a bracelet for me.  I wish that I could order more since they do wear out.
5.0,Socks are very nice. Not too thick. They stay up when you have shoes on.
5.0,My husband loved it! I love the worn and oiled look. Fits great!
5.0,Put these on and turned into a Bald Eagle. Enough Said
5.0,I really love my new jacket ☺️
5.0,"Love love love these! Yes they are pricey and would buy one in every color if they were half the price ;)). Love the sparkles and get lots of compliments. Have them in eggplant also, that color is awesome!"
5.0,Yes get it ..it works and so nice
5.0,"I really like these pants. The material seemed good for cycling and running in wet, windy weather. I ordered the small, which fit just like the model. But I need a higher waist and a teensy bit more room on the butter. So I returned the Smalls and planned to buy the Médium as soon as I got my refund. It's been almost two weeks and still no refund, so I am hesitant to order the next size up. I'll update if I get the next size.<br /><br />Update: got my refund shortly after the inital review. Ordered the Médium size and they fit PERFECTLY. I love them! They're high enough at the waist, no worries bending down or while pedaling. An hour bike ride in a wet 40degree evening was very comfortable. Highly recommend."
5.0,Very sexy fit just right
5.0,"I love these leggings. They are of great quality, look just like the images pictured, and were shipped very fast. I got a large size, and the only issue is they are kind of long for me personally, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. I get so many compliments on these when I where them!"
5.0,"Great material, so soft and comfortable, stays off the shoulder, perfect length, I always have a problem with length, not with this! Great structure, great quality, just ordered more, one for a gift and one more for me, one for around the house, one nice enough for an outing."
5.0,"Very nice dress, perfect for a wedding. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,as pictured - really love the softness - super relieved/pleased with this purchase
5.0,"It's not only tough, it looks good too"
5.0,Fit great and am wearing often.
5.0,"When I received this bracelet, I fell in love with the floral pink and cream color of it. It is woven with shells into a bracelet that makes it look special. The elastic band of the bracelet stretches according to one’s hand size. I love the fact that it could be mixed and matched with shell or conch necklace and shell earrings. It is great to wear for beach parties and for fun at the beach during summer time. It feels very comfortable on my hand and I would definitely recommend it."
5.0,These earrings look good....they are good quality...and the price was comfortable too.
5.0,"i love it, so beautiful! nice finish."
5.0,I love this bra. It’s so pretty. It’s comfortable too. Fits pretty good. True to size. It has good support and pushes the girls up.
5.0,Able to cover face without straps around ears.
5.0,Loved this so much bought it in 3 colors.Great for warm weather because it’s all breathable cotton.
5.0,"The fit is perfect, looking forward to buy the shorts next."
5.0,The orange heel looks more pink than it does orange. My son still loves them though as he doesn't have any issues with the color pink.
5.0,Perfect size. Great wallet.
5.0,Fast shipping and item as described.
5.0,These are beautiful.  Just as pictured.  Great box as well.  It's a gift for my mom so that's even better.
5.0,The socks were the prefect addition to my daughters outfit! They fit perfectly on my 9 year old.
5.0,These are cute and save my eyes.  I'm on the computer a minimum 9 hours a day with work and these lenses make all the difference in the world with my eye fatigue.  Incredible price for the quality.
5.0,"Highly recommend! The suit fits great! Very nice material, comfortable."
5.0,deal
5.0,I fell in love with this dress the moment  saw it
5.0,Super sexy! Got so many compliments & very form fitting! Im 175 & got a size medium & fit perfectly!:) Highly recommend.
5.0,My granddaughter loved this outfit! It fit perfectly! Runs true to size.
5.0,"I was worried when I first ordered it because the picture shows the red and the orange in the wrong order of the rainbow. Some other customers also left reviews saying that the colors were wrong as well. However, when mine arrive (right on schedule as well), I was pleased to find that the colors were in the right order! I guess they figured out their mistake. Also, the string is adjustable which makes it easy to put on and take off. The colors are bright and beautiful and the whole thing just looks nice. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to show their pride in a nice, not over-the-top way."
5.0,Couldnt be happier with this skirt. Wore with flat shoes for a shoot and it had the right amount of weight and material was thick enough to not worry about showing off &#34;extra&#34;.<br />Flowy and will wear again.
5.0,"very cute! married 39 yrs, this is us :-)"
5.0,Fit is a little loose and length is too long.  Had them hemmed and they are fine.
5.0,These are well made and fit my little piggy just right
5.0,"Perfect! The gloves are soft, supple leather, cashmere lining is delightful. Most importantly, as advertised they work on a touch screen, and well (my partner can text with them on). I had miscalculated the size (might suggest trying a half size up here) but my exchange was smooth and fast. Zero complaints, very, very pleased with the quality of the product."
5.0,Loved this dress! Only downfall was the shoulders kept calling down
5.0,great cap
5.0,"Very nice, liked it so well I ordered a nother"
5.0,Who wears short shorts? My boyfriend does now haha. These are short and great for powerlifting or as sleeping shorts. They’re very soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Fabulous skirts: pretty cut, flattering fit, and comfortable, soft material for everyday and work attire without being too casual-looking to wear for something fancy! They are long, which I love but might be difficult for a shorter person (I'm almost 5'6&#34; and like to wear heels, but it is still a couple inches off the ground for me when I am only wearing flip-flops. That was size S... idk if the other sizes might be longer.)"
5.0,Very pretty and shiny.  Just like the picture.
5.0,"There was a slight delay, but I received Excellent customer service from the seller -they have great communication - and very cute earrings. I’ve gotten compliments every time I wear them"
5.0,"I'm using it for a decoration for Feb., not to wear. So as a decoration it's great."
5.0,Super happy with these
5.0,"I'm a HUGE fan of SPUNKYsoul jewelry and this bracelet is another awesome addition! It's well-made as all their items are. The gold metallic squares are set well and I am confident will all stay put. I haven't had any marks left on my arm from the leather. It's a nice chocolate brown and goes with a lot of outfits. Although it's thin, the leather appears to be strong and should withstand being taken on and off for quite some time. Since it's leather I won't be wearing it anytime I get wet (which isn't often) just to preserve it and keep it as long as possible.<br /><br />I just wrapped it around my wrist several times. There is also a clasp you can use as well. I have a fairly bony wrist so I got 4 loops others might only get 3. I did get a great email from the fabulous customer service that included a PDF of one way to put it on if you got confused. A great addition!<br /><br />I will continue to purchase SPUNKYsoul jewelry! You should put their name in the search field and you'd be amazed at the wide variety of stuff they have at very reasonable prices!"
5.0,My best friend loved them.
5.0,Looks great and inexpensive
5.0,Awesome cross ...the chocker is OK but was able to put on silver chain  great product for the price love it!

5.0,looks just like photo!!!  I LOVE this item!  fast shipping too.
5.0,Super cute. A little bigger than expected.
5.0,The was a gift to a huge yellowstone fan and she loved it.
5.0,Love these so much😊💗
5.0,Works great and don’t have to clean as often.
5.0,I bought this beautiful bracelet for my daughter over the holidays. She absolutely loves it! It truly is stunning and comes in 2 sizes. She has many mala necklace beads but this really stands out. I highly recommend! Thank you!
5.0,I bought this mask as part of a superhero costume.  It is a high quality mask.  I couldn't believe the value I got for my dollar.  I highly recommend ordering from this seller.
5.0,I love the colors and size.  Bought one for a friend too
5.0,Love this handbag! Perfect size and very well made. Would buy again.
5.0,"I love it! Very well put together, and color is way better in person."
5.0,"These earrings are very pretty. The setting is made well, the stone is a bit darker than what was shown in the photo and a bit larger than what I thought. But I like them very much."
5.0,I can’t believe how cute and well made this dress is!  It is fully lined and that is so unusual these days no matter the price.  Love how it feels on!  Don’t hesitate on buying this one!
5.0,Got this for my son and he loves it. Only bad thing is how easy it is to break. He chipped it in his pocket.
5.0,"I love these shoes! The print is beautiful, these heels are my best find ever. If you are looking for a comfortable block heel shoe, these are it."
5.0,"Great material, the white white shirt wouldnt fit over my chest because my chest was too big but that was to be expected other than that no complaints and it came early. I am 4'11 if that helps too (2xl is a size medium in American sizing)"
5.0,My dad was very pleased with this Father’s Day gift!  He put in right on!
5.0,perfect fit and color! can’t believe this set was only $10!
5.0,I bought these for my sister.  She said they fit perfect and are doing the job she needed them to.  Very happy with the product.
5.0,enjoyable and very much like the shape.  i ordered a little smaller then i was thinking so my fault not the companies  i  returned and ordered a new one in M.  i  am a 32 inch waist.
5.0,Perfect. Love it
5.0,"Very solid. Looks great, and should hold up well."
5.0,Initial thoughts... This is a beautiful bag! Quality was much better than expected for the price! Well constructed and no chemical smell. Wine color is gorgeous! Leather is soft and even comes with a bag to store it when not in use.
5.0,"I liked this sweater more than I expected that I would.  It's well made and attractive on.  Not too heavy or thin.  The sizing was accurate as well.  The one thing I would change is to make the tie removable because it doesn't fit right at waist level for me since I have a very short torso.  I end up fussing with the tie and adjusting where it sits often so it doesn't look awkward.  If you have a normal length torso and/or are taller than I am at 5'3"" you can't go wrong with this sweater."
5.0,Very pretty. I bought a small and I’m 5’5” 32ddd 110 lb and it fits perfectly.  Good at material. I would recommend
5.0,Durable. Doesn’t fade or tear. Comfy.
5.0,Great shoe don't hurt your feet
5.0,"I love these small, understated earrings"
5.0,It's just the right size.  Like the magnetic clip.  Great money clip.
5.0,This we're really cute and a great value. Perfect party favor!
5.0,Beautiful blouse!!! Met more than my expectations...fits wonderfully! You’ll have a one of a kind blouse that people will be asking where you got it!!!
5.0,Great looking capris.  Very flattering fit.
5.0,Fits as expected. Super comfy when it is hot out
5.0,Son works construction and it's getting colder. He added this to his attire and lost a layer because this long sleeve was just the right fit and not too bulky to wear with the rest of his clothing.
5.0,Nice boots!
5.0,Really cute design and very soft tank! Love it!
5.0,Beautiful well made item for my darling daughter
5.0,Great fit! Fit true to size! My granddaughter loved that it was a longer length! Very comfortable!
5.0,"I am a sunglass nut and these are my favorites by far.  I like Serengeti's and Maui Jim's as well, but these are the clearest and have the best color rendition.  They actually relax the eyes so that you see more clearly with less effort."
5.0,Love it! So soft and easy to wear and wash and dry!
5.0,It is so pretty and the material is so soft.  I love this purse
5.0,"I would recommend it, I love the design, its has a very classy look, and the most important part is that my bf loved it too so Im more than satisfied"
5.0,I am happy with this item and it worked out perfectly. The quality is good. Materials don't feel or look cheap. I ordered an XL when I am usually a L in shirts and 14-18 in pants and the bottoms fit great but the top was slim fitting and snug. Item was delivered on time.
5.0,"This is so flattering!. I'm 5'7 wear 38C bra. Perfect length, not binding, buttons in front are fake so no gaping. Love pockets!. If there r addt'l colors, I'm ordering more"
5.0,"Hard working, dependable"
5.0,"Material feels soft, comfortable. Material keeps you cool. Being a compression shirt can’t go by measurement provided maybe 1 or 2 sizes smaller. According to does measurements I was a 2x but when i got them they were loose on me. I got a L it fit just right!"
5.0,"I am very pleased with this case.  It is a nice color and the design is very attractive.  It works well and is just what I had been looking for, so am happy to locate such an attractive one.  Quick delivery, too."
5.0,The fact that it’s a “breakaway” is the reason I purchased it but it also very light around the neck.
5.0,Fantastic belt. I wish the leg loops were sold with it.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these!  I got them for a second piercing, and I can leave them in for days with no irritation."
5.0,Such a pretty dress!!!!
5.0,Awesome hat! Love the style!
5.0,Material is comfortable
5.0,"OMG I LOVE this silly beanie!!! Got it for $10 bucks and the quality is nice! Super soft inside and out. The size fits warm and comfortably, it covers the ears and has a loose sag at the top so it's no head condom lol The pom poms that hang down the front are lengthy. The detail of the stitching is better than I expected for the price too, I'm thrilled! This is a gift for my cousin and I might buy another one for me I love this hat."
5.0,Super cute and don't fall out!
5.0,My favorite belt
5.0,my husband uses it  for wedding band
5.0,A lot of fun .everyone liked them.
5.0,"Great value, great fit and I use them every where I go."
5.0,I bought four pairs of these brand sunglasses for my grandchildren...different styles for boys and girls and different age groups from 4-10.. They all absolutely loved them! they were amazed by the case and the bag and cleaning cloth. I was also surprised at the great quality of them. They are especially great for the older boys who play ball. Highly recommended!!
5.0,"i LOVE these leggings. i have two pairs! HOWEVER, i’ve had the red pair for just over a month now and the crotch is tearing and i didn’t find out until i (a fitness instructor) was leading my class in stretches. disappointed in that, i’ll probably just buy another pair of the grey since they’ve had no issues and are worn significantly more. UPDATE: customer service in fixing this issue has been fantastic and i plan on further purchasing more leggings in the future as well as suggesting this brand to my class participants."
5.0,"I was a little nervous with how light weight they were as I tend to drop my glasses a lot, but so far their holding up to my clumsiness. Their great for the intense AZ summers and for driving as they take away glares."
5.0,"Comfortable,  easy to go, and partition makes it great bag."
5.0,Super soft shirt! Loved it !!
5.0,Like e additional lengthanr the traditional styling. And the price. Good value for a nice tie. Tree more words three.
5.0,fit perfectly /as good as much more exspensive
5.0,"These are well-made, comfortable and look great!"
5.0,"Looked just like the picture. It was a gift for my mom, she loved it"
5.0,Expected more spandex for tighter fit.  Fits more like a regular shirt
5.0,Very true to size
5.0,"Fabric is a bit flimsy and gets fuzzy pretty easily but good value for the price. Oh and if you’re a girl who doesn’t love her arms, the loose cap sleeve on this one are a nice surprise."
5.0,I live the multicolor stones and the shine if it. It’s a beautiful piece of good length and quality.
5.0,"very beautiful bracelet,"
5.0,"Bought 2, Red one and Grey one, both are really nice and look just like the picture. Ordered one for a friend and he loved it."
5.0,nice for a winter wedding
5.0,"Works great!  This was purchased for a 12 year old girl. Used as a carry on for air travel. Plenty of room for a full week's summer wardrobe. we use travel compression bags to maximize space. She likes the chevron design. The wheels make a full rotation, and the handle extends to an adequate length for a 5' 4&#34; person."
5.0,No complaints! So cute
5.0,"I bought this ring for my fiance to present to him on our wedding day.  The fit is perfect and the ring is great quality for the price.  My husband loves the ring and advises that it's a comfortable fit.  It looks really good on his hand and it's not too flashy.  This ring is perfect for giving you the sleek, sophisticated look of a precious metal, however it is very durable and not easily scratched.  This was a great pick and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a wedding band or fashion ring."
5.0,Very beautiful!! It was a little expensive for a bracelet but I bought it anyways! I love it!
5.0,"I purchased this sweater coat as a Christmas gift to myself.  I was impressed with the craftsmanship.  The sweater is not very thick for a cable knit sweater, which is perfect for the warmer winter weather in the south eastern US.  The sweater is not lined.  The material is soft and seems quite durable.  The zipper is obviously set up on international standard, as opposed to US standard (the zipper zips left handed like the zippers for women's garments in the US).  The hood is large and roomy.  I wear this more indoors than outdoors.  I have no intentions of wearing it in the rain as I doubt it would offer much protection.  This item is manufactured in Ireland and imported to the US."
5.0,Love this bag. I get so many compliments!
5.0,Great costume. Super cute on my so
5.0,They were exactly what my daughter wanted very cute earrings for any young girl that likes pandas.
5.0,"This is a beautiful stone. the color is more vibrant than the picture shows, and it is quite a large stone, just like the comparison pictures. I received this for free for an honest and unbiased review, and I plan on using this multiple times in my future."
5.0,I’m waiting for summer to wear this but it arrived as pictured and super cute.
5.0,"Long air travel  and swollen legs are not a good combo, these socks prevent that and give great support."
5.0,It's very cute I needed a bracelet like this on my watch
5.0,Very trendy and keeps me warm!
5.0,Really pretty can tell if the planets are stones like they say.. But still worth it. The bracelet was turning my wrist blue.
5.0,"Bought as a gift fro a friend, she loved it, sight unseen it fit like a glove...or socks if you prefer."
5.0,I LOVE THEM!!
5.0,"The slippers fit perfectly, she'll have them for a very long time."
5.0,"I'm 6'3"" and there is definitely extra length with these tanks - enough to use as undershirt and tuck in without coming out"
5.0,Love this top. I usually wear a small to medium and the small fit perfectly.
5.0,Exactly what I had hoped. Minimalist wallet I can carry in my hip pocket.
5.0,These are so cute. Super light weight and comfortable on my face!
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. toddler size back earring
5.0,It is even more breathable than I had anticipated.<br />I used it to contain a down sleeping bag to preserve the loft.
5.0,Sophisticated
5.0,This dress is very cute! I wear a size 10 and bought a large...perfect! It's priced great and fits flattering. I am 5'4 and it hits below my knees.  I'd buy again if they had other styles that didn't look so similar. Love the fit.
5.0,Looks great! Very well made. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"The hat is well made and the color is a vivid hue not faded. It doesn’t look cheap.<br />They not only sent the hat in a week but included a thank note and gifts, a cute hair tie and a silicone ear saver for a mask.  That’s great customer service"
5.0,It was very large and deep
5.0,Good quality hat
5.0,This is a beautiful necklace I bought it to match a handbag I have. I was satisfied with my purchase nothing missing or broken when I received it made me very happy I love it!
5.0,"The scarves come gift boxes in plastic with a few artificial flowers thrown in for good measure. I removed the flowers and presented the gift to much fanfare! One scarf is a tropical blend of peacock inspired blues and the second scarf is a rich and luxurious blend of olive greens and golds. For the price you can feel comfortable using these items, even to sleep in. For the quality, watch a few scarf tying videos and update your wardrobe and style!!!"
5.0,I love this Beach cover up. I wear it when I am home to be comfortable. Soft fabric. Beautiful print and colors. Pure comfort!
5.0,Goes well with black clothes underneath for warmth.
5.0,Got lots of room for cards good quality received quickly would deff order again and I love all the zipper pockets as well
5.0,Great for my social studies class.
5.0,Love this dress! The fit a little snug but still looks great/works fine.... and the fabric is beautiful!
5.0,Right size
5.0,Great looking birthday charm for my mom
5.0,Bought to replace one my son lost. He loves it!
5.0,"I always go up a size with PattyBoutik clothing because I don’t like my clothing too tight so the large was perfect for my preferences being 5’7” and 145 lbs. The color is gorgeous and the cut and fit is very flattering to me. I have a little bit of a belly so it hides it nicely for me. It doesn’t show too much cleavage on me so I can wear it to work but then I’m not a very busty lady so that might not be the case for another. The fabric is comfortable, soft and smooth. Not too thick or thin. Seems a good quality fabric. Good for warm weather! The length is also good for me. I hate when tops are too short and show belly when I raise my arms but this top doesn’t do that. It could be a little longer for me but it’s still not a bad length. I might get it in more colors. Good purchase!"
5.0,"I love this top. I like how it feels on me. Doesn't ride up when I sit down & stand back up. No tugging, for me anyway. The material is nice and soft. Would definitely buy again! 🦋🦋"
5.0,Super comfy and stylish
5.0,Beautiful dress and Thank you so much for Fast delivery. I really appreciate it! Super Customer service!
5.0,LOVE THESE! I like that they fit the entire leg. So comfortable. Would like more in different colors!
5.0,"The first day I wore it to work I got compliments about the cap. It’s soft and light, comfortable to wear! Definitely recommend it."
5.0,"I ordered the Hynes Victory Women Washed Backpack it arrived super fast with the Amazon Prime 2 day shipping it was extremely well packaged with extra extra protection and was in perfect condition.  I was impressed with the company and the care put into the packaging of this backpack and extra little information card supplied to thank you for your purchase, very thoughtful details.  I fell in instant love with this bag immediately upon opening... what an amazing bag! The quality of the backpack is exquisite every detail is perfectly constructed and OMG I can't even explain how soft it is, I just wanted to hug it, lol. There's abundant room to carry everything I need and quite a few items I don't, there are several compartments on both exterior and interior so it's easy to stay organized. It is completely lined with a good quality, very durable fabric. The bag is really sturdy and well made I have no doubt I will be enjoying this backpack using it frequently for years to come. This is not your ordinary Backpack you see everyday it is so much more it has alot of style and looks great. Totally worth every penny of the full purchase price I would definitely recommend this backpack, you won't regret it trust me. I am so thankful that I was given the opportunity to purchase the Hynes Victory Women Washed Backpack for a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I would have paid full price without hesitation it really is a great buy... just saying!  I rely heavily on customer reviews when considering products and services so I always leave honest reviews in return. "

5.0,Wear it everywhere
5.0,Great for wearing around the house.
5.0,The fit is perfect! And it's a beautiful..
5.0,"My husband loves these pajamas, so I had to find him another pair to swap between while one pair was being washed. Only problem was the pair we bought locally was no longer being sold at that store. To Amazon! LOL Happy husband.<br />He's been enjoying these pajamas for years. They're made to last."
5.0,"Wanted something that was not for warmth but was more for covering upper body at work and provide a little protection from cold inside the building. The quality is just fine for the cost, it fits great, and it isn't too hot to wear in doors. I could see myself wearing this indoors during the summer too (since grey goes with anything)."
5.0,"So soft and cozy! I love the lightweight and soft fabric! This fits tighter to the body, so size up if your looking for a looser fit. Great as a layering piece or casual wear out and about."
5.0,I'm not sure what this hot is used for but it helps shelter my neck and face from the sun.
5.0,nice quality belt. would buy again 🙌🏽👏🏽
5.0,Third pair I have ordered.  I use them for outdoor work.  Best work gloves I have found for my needs.
5.0,Bought this hat for my daughter for her birthday. Just like the picture. Very cute!
5.0,"This scarf arrived today just before I was going to walk my dog in 30° weather. It's perfect. It's the softest thing I have ever felt. It's not too long, as I wear it under my coat and it isn't too bulky. I am so happy I gifted myself this scarf."
5.0,Bought for daughter-in-law she loved
5.0,great item for my girlfriend
5.0,good quality!  can't wait to wear!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3e0522a0ab4a8a828d13400e1388b12c]] Still in great condition.i love
5.0,My 7 yr old loves it and wore it to school for pj party day.  Looks great and is true to size.
5.0,"I bought these at Costco a year ago. Absolutely love the top. Pants have pockets and fabric is nice quality. Bought most recent pair for about twice what Costco charged but was so delighted to have these PJs to give as a gift, that price was secondary. Washes well too!!"
5.0,Really comfortable. I am generally a size 10 and the large fit just right. Not too tight or baggy. It is fun and the colors are so bright. great for the summer. Wore this to a concert and received many compliments on the dress.You need to wear smooth flesh toned underwear because you will see anything else through the fabric on the bottom.
5.0,I love Dansko!
5.0,Love Em
5.0,Husband love it. Can't go wrong with Life is Good!

5.0,These are very nice.  They are made of durable material and will be perfect for Halloween.
5.0,My daughter loves this skort!
5.0,This dress fit perfectly and I got a million compliments on it. Beautifully made. It does stretch a bit so you have a little wiggle room if its a touch too small.
5.0,Did a great job of keeping kiddo warm and dry after rolling around for hours in the snow. Wish I could have bought 2 but product wasn’t available.
5.0,"Love my new wallet, wife doesn’t like it but I think it’s very modern."
5.0,"This top is beautiful and I like my tops a little large instead of 'snug' so it is just fine.  I am a size 8 and weigh 125#  and order this<br />in different designs and all in large.  If you want a stunning top, this is for you!!! (made very well, also)"
5.0,Super sick.
5.0,I’m so happy with this purchase. It’s very pretty. I wear it everyday

5.0,"This red and black plaid flannel bathrobe is super cute on my 82 year old mom! She likes the fabric, collar, pockets, etc. Wouldn’t change a thing!"
5.0,I decided to get the shirt in pink and I’m not really the type of person who likes pink or wears pink but the way this is made it really looks good on me and I’m very happy with it. It is plus size friendly.  For reference I’m almost 5‘8“ 42D-39-46 dress size 16/18. And this fits me just like the photos. It goes down on one shoulder you can also pull it down on the other shoulder you can pick a side. It has the buttons on both sides of the shoulder. it’s just really cute and soft and comfortable. The material is made very well and it’s not see-through. I really wanna get this in many more colors.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful for you.
5.0,This set of four tank tops a nice. They fit well and are cozy soft. They didn't shrink or fade during washing and don't need ironing. Good value too.
5.0,"I was researching for months to find the best option in the minimalist wallet space, and had cut it down to this and the more expensive ridge wallet.  Then I found that a co-worker had a Ridge, for about 3 years, and he hated it.  It destroyed his cards, was missing a few screws, looked really, really beat up, and generally left him feeling disappointed.  I got this one, have had it for about 4 months now, and my cards still look and feel healthy, the wallet is solid and sturdy, and still has all the screws.<br /><br />My favorite part about this one, is that when you push the cards out, and pinch the wallet to fan them, you dont have to worry about them all popping out of the wallet and flying all over the place, which I managed to do twice while testing a Ridge knock-off for only a couple minutes.  The concern about cards sliding out on the bottom is unfounded in my experience.  If I got from 10 down to 1 card, just wiggle the elastic a bit to tighten it back up, and that 1 is just as safe as 10.  Great buy."
5.0,Such a nice way to carry your memories. Great gift
5.0,Absolutely love it Pitch Perfect
5.0,"Decorative, nice colors"
5.0,Very nice.<br />Took long time to get here

5.0,I'm 5'3 and about 115 lbs and the medium fits perfect.  Loose enough to hide my belly and comes down over my butt.  Will buy again.
5.0,We are very satisfied and recommend them to your customers. The fit is comfortable and fits my small face better. My husband has a bigger face and it works for him too. Very happy with this product!

5.0,Very pretty. Was a Birthday gift.

5.0,Bought it for our fundraising event. Didn't expect it to look expensive for the money spent. It looked stunning!
5.0,I purchased a set of 3 and gave one to each daughter and daughter in law.  They do give a great view of stone settings and I found 2 broken prongs on my engagement ring.  Hopefully one can find problems before losing a stone!  Very useful!
5.0,"Pretty, feminine and unique, love it"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c4d1f3c334990000791469bfb3c1b830]] This is my second shred belt I bought, the first I'm still using it and I love it, i was thinking to give it try to this one Xtreme that heat all around your waist and as soon I got it I used it and 😳 wow pure fire 🔥 hard to resist but I pull it out through my workout, I'm planning to keep using it and see if I see any results, I will update later with more information 👌"
5.0,Super cute mouse pad!
5.0,Looks absolutely beautiful. I recieve so many compliments on them.
5.0,The kids love them. That's all the experience I have with them.
5.0,"I love everything about this dress. It's comfortable, soft, and easy to wear with any accessory-- and for any occasion. The fabric is durable, with easy care instructions-- yet light enough to be able to wear on a hot summer day. I plan on getting a lot of wear out of this dress over the summer.<br />FYI-- I am 5'7 and the medium hits right at my ankles."
5.0,Liked the price and quality.
5.0,Soft comfortable  perfect length
5.0,"I’m 5’7” and 150 lbs.  The extra large fit me perfectly.  My pictures are from trying it on after it arrived and without making any adjustments or modifications.  I often have issue with fit because my waist is much smaller than my hips,  but this fit perfectly.  My arms are a bit long, so that is sometimes an issue with other costumes, but not with this one.  You absolutely cannot see through it; I’m wearing an orange bra and striped underwear, and you can’t tell.  With the gloves on, it’s a little hard to work all the zippers, but that’s just the nature of this type of costume."
5.0,Really cute and it’s not see through.
5.0,"Love these watch bands.  My wrist is small, so these bands are as snug as I want them with the confidence I won’t lose my watch.  With the matching screen cover; they make my watch match any style/color of my other accessories!  Love them…. Great quality at an awesome price!  Thank you!"

5.0,"These fit perfectly on my 6 month old. Not too big and not too small, just right! I purchased two more colors. My daughter does not fuss when she’s wearing these glasses."
5.0,"Appears to be quality construction. It fits smoothly, not snug."
5.0,Love the shirt. It had a funky smell at first but maybe it was from original packaging. Let it air for a bit then it was all goo.
5.0,The design is good and everything fits really well.  Really glad that I purchased.  A++
5.0,"I love these shoes, and I will order more when I need them."
5.0,Love it it’s so beautiful

5.0,Perfect fit & warm going into fall
5.0,"Kermit has brought lots of laughter for my friends and family in the past year, with his funny meme's on social media!  This shirt is perfect!  I wish we could find more Kermit stuff."

5.0,Amazing quality for the price. Heavy anchor...
5.0,"I love this dress. I received a bunch of compliments when I wore it on Valentine’s Day. I felt it was a little big in the back. I ordered a US Large/label XL based on the size chart. It fit great otherwise in the front, length, and around the arms. Highly recommend this dress for a night out"
5.0,Love this shirt comfy and fit well
5.0,"GREAT STITCHING, Very classy look."
5.0,"I loved this dress and generally like all Grace Karin dresses. Ordered a Medium and it fit perfectly. I’m 5’7, 147 pounds bra size 36DD. I did wear shape-wear underneath."
5.0,"So beautifully made, real leather, very thick and stiff. It will get a little looser when worn. Totally made my Halloween, lots of compliments."
5.0,Love it. Nice hat.
5.0,Love the way it fits. Hugs my curves.
5.0,"I first got a large, which ended up being a little small so I sized up, but I ended up returning it and buying someone similar with long sleeves."
5.0,"This nightgown is well constructed with very soft flannel it is by no means one of those ""cardboard"" flannels. The patterns are varied and can appeal to most tastes. It is long enough to keep the legs warm and sizes are roomy enough not to pull and bind when lying down. Altogether a good buy."
5.0,"This is a very nice headband. It’s a little loose on my head, but still works all & I’m sure I’ll find a way to make it a bit tighter."
5.0,Está hermosa

5.0,"Gorgeous for the price, perfect sweater necklaces."
5.0,"Just follow the size chart, I got a M like it said & it fits me great, if you want it a little bigger but still looking good then do 1 size up."
5.0,"I never wear flip-flops, but I thought I would try these upon a recommendation. They fit very well, are comfortable and well made. I wear them whenever I can!"
5.0,very very roomy without taking up alot of room.  very nice leather.  I use this for phone lip balm etc for when i do not want to carry a purse.  I use it as a wristlet.  I may purchase another in another color i like it so much.
5.0,"Socks are nice and snug, just as described. I went walking for too long, 2 miles, before warming up. I still got shin splints, as I usually do when starting a walking program. I am sure that was due to my own carelessness. I was just anxious to get back to walking after knee surgery. I had a twofold reason for getting these. My new job is a desk job so I am sitting all day and legs are swelling. I put them on after work, but once I get back to wearing trousers to cover the sleeves I will be wearing to work. No problems with them."
5.0,Very cute shirt. Looks perfect with jeans! Next one I’ll get one size up so it’s really off shoulder and slouchy. But I’m happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Great earrings, love how they glow"
5.0,Fun for the theme party
5.0,"I love the look, feel and fit of this jacket. Very professional with its 3/4 sleeve."
5.0,I bought this to wear as a shawl in the Vatican and other churches on a trip to Italy in September. It worked very well and the colors in it matched what I was wearing quite well. It folded up small enough to fit into my pocketbook when I wasn’t wearing it (it was very hot in Italy when I was there).
5.0,"There my favorite glasses, there big enough to fit my head, I have MUCH more expensive sunglasses  and I prefer these. I will order again"
5.0,"Very nice band to &#34;class up&#34; the Fitbit Blaze.  Definitely weighted, which gives it a great feel."
5.0,School bus driver here. These are great and grip my Thomas bus wheel perfectly. Looking forward to the longevity challenge. Let’s see what happens when summer comes around.
5.0,"GREAT! I needed a nice and comfy bodysuit and I’m just in love with this one!! It fit very well, more than I was expecting. Really nice fabric."

5.0,Very nice glasses! Look great!

5.0,Great dress :) fits in all the right places and is perfect for breastfeeding :)
5.0,Great for a warm slipper for the evenings.
5.0,"This dress is flowy, flattering and very comfortable.  Material does not wrinkle which is a major plus.  The drawstring is helpful also.  I ordered a medium which is my usual size."

5.0,Love these.

5.0,"Super comfortable, stretchy material. Loved the pockets as well"
5.0,"I had this exact same suit before and I got it at Walmart! I wore it everywhere and obviously it faded out and I loved it so much but couldn't find another one and I stumbled (after much searching) on it on Amazon! MY FAVORITE TANKINI! The straps come off which is a big necessity for me, I don't like tan lines in my shoulders! I love this too so much!!!!"
5.0,I absolutely love these sunglasses. I wear them everywhere. They're so light and trendy. I get compliments on them all the time

5.0,I brought this for my 5 year old great grandson and he wears it every day . He loves it
5.0,"Love, love, love this bracelet!! It's the perfect width and color and very easy to buckle on my own. The leather is thick enough that it shouldn't ever wear through, but super soft-no breaking in needed! My wrists are small so I punched another hole but no big deal for a bracelet I love! I wear it almost every day."
5.0,The material seems very durable. My daughter will likely outgrow it before it gets dingy from use.
5.0,"I hate a naked ear, so i wear these every single day and I love them! No infections, no nothing! They look gorgeous too."

5.0,Fits nice and is comfortable and cool.
5.0,What I expected to rec've!  I love my flipflops!
5.0,"Came 2 days early. Fit as expected, soft fabric breathable. Great Shirt for the price."
5.0,Had this necklace for a few months. Match 80% of my clothing. Wish they had black. Would purchase one also.
5.0,Great product. They're a soft material and he loves them.
5.0,Muy buenoooo 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
5.0,I love the charms that spin around the base.  These are such cute little elephants and perfect for me as I collect Merry-go-round charms and most have horses. Perfect to wear with silver and gold charms.
5.0,"I'm 5'9, 150lbs with an hourglass shape. I bought a M and it was perfect.<br /><br />I bought this for a late summer wedding and it is amazing. The red is vibrant, the lace is beautiful, and the A-line fit is so flattering. It looks more expensive than it is. I got so many compliments, and my boyfriend loved it too."
5.0,My son loves this shirt.Just what I expected
5.0,I ordered one prior to this so this is my second order. Love this dress. Perfect fit and so comfortable.
5.0,"Nice detailing, very pretty keychain"
5.0,"I’m very pleased with these Ocean Blues high waisted tummy control leggings.<br /><br />I ordered in medium black which I love. I’m 5’6” and currently about 145lbs. I would say they are a little snug, but feel more purposefully compressive rather than uncomfortably tight. If you are about my size and don’t want it to feel too compressive, then I think you would be very happy with a large.<br /><br />Overall, these fit great. They are super smooth, comfy, and stretchy. They are appropriately thick so that they have been squat-proof and I haven’t had an issue with panty lines (of course it may depend on what type you wear and how thick). They are very breathable as well. They are form fitting, flattering, and high waisted. There are pockets on each front size that you could put your phone in.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these if you like the way I have described them. They look high-quality and just as advertised, have held up in the wash, and I’m very happy to have them. I would gladly lounge in these, work out, or do anything in them. I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!"
5.0,Low price but look great! I always get compliments when I wear them.
5.0,"Great belt, nice quality belt."
5.0,Very cute oh my granddaughter she loves that outfit it’s very well-made good price and Pastor Rick
5.0,"I am a very big skeptic in general and think myself smarter than most. I bought these glasses largely because I expected them not to live up to their claims and I was looking forward to feeling a little smug about how right I was that yellow glasses can not ""brighten"" your view or improve your capacity for finding teeth. My other motivation was that I though my wife would love the cute shark case they come in (the zipper is the shark's teeth), and hate the style of the glasses themselves which I would wear proudly for that reason. I was totally right about the latter, and totally wrong about the former. The glasses actually do work great for increasing contrast between the beach and the teeth. It's as if everything out there naturally comes with a light grey/blue wash over it, and the yellow glasses kind of filter out that wash, leaving the dark teeth darker and the yellow sand yellower. That's really what yellow shooting glasses are for, and I have tried a couple of pairs of regular cheap shooting glasses for tooth hunting, but they just don't seem to work quite as well. I have ordered two pairs of these now, partly because the cheap shooting glasses broke, partly because the cute shark case the first set came in was stolen out of our bag at the beach, and largely because as uncool as they may look, my wife wants to wear a pair of them now too when we go toothing."
5.0,"The person I gave it to loved it, she wanted to know where I got it."
5.0,Perfect for the hardwood floors in my gym's yoga room and a great conversation starter with newbies.
5.0,This bag was bought for my Toiletry items
5.0,Very comfortable!  Love the colorful pattern--could use as swimsuit coverup if wanted to.
5.0,Classy looking...
5.0,Love these! Perfect for the gym or work. I usually wear a 12/14 200lbs and Got a Large and they fit perfect
5.0,Lovely dress and it fits as expected. True to size and has quite the space for that mid section if you need it without the dress looking like maternity clothing. It's flattering fitting and cute
5.0,"I had these in my save for later on amazon... I finally ordered them and they are gorgeous!<br />Note: they do look larger in the picture than in person. At first I was worried I wouldn't like them, I usually like larger hoops, ect.<br />But they are so elegant and classy! They work great with casual and dressy fits. I've already received quite a few compliments and told all my friends to order them, they are so gorgeous!"
5.0,So cute! Fit way better then I expected! I’m 5’4 and about 180 pounds with a 36ddd chest so I was really surprised how much I loved this! I find it hard to find flattering rompers that look good on me so this was definitely a win! So happy!
5.0,Vey Elegant and Beautiful products :) I will defiantly order more soon  :)
5.0,"I mainly ordered this top because the red was a unique shade. And in person, I think it is just as nice as it looks in the photos. It flatters my skin tone, which I of course like a lot.<br />But upon taking this shirt out of the bag, the first thing I noticed is the material felt very thin. So much so, I was doubting if I would want to wear this top at all. But once I tried it on, I realized I couldn't make out my bra lines at all. In fact, it didn't feel too thin or lightweight once I had it on.<br />The only other thing I didn't love about this top was that I needed to snip a few loose threads. But other than that, I found it to be incredibly flattering. It fits my shape well. It doesn't cling. And I found it true to size (TTS). So in the end, I am actually rather happy with this shirt! I would have to recommend it.<br /><br />..<br />(For reference, I have apple figure body shape. Meaning I carry my most of my extra weight in the belly. I'm 5'6"". 155lbs. My preferred top size is an XL)"
5.0,LIGHTNING FAST SHIPPING.  AND THEY ARE THICKER THAN I THOUGHT.  GREAT ITEM.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I COULD NOT FIND LITTLE GIRLS KNEE HIGH SOCKS IN ANY STORE.  GLAD I CHECKED THE INTERNET !
5.0,"These earrings are so pretty. Simple and elegant, they're among my favorite danglies."
5.0,Bought this dress for a work party and it was perfect!  Material holds up well and looks very nice on. Purchased the black because I figured I couldn’t go wrong and I’m so happy it worked out. Worth the money and thinking about getting other colors.
5.0,The Tie worked I used it for a job interview wed looked great it fits of the big belly love it
5.0,Exactly as looked in pics :)<br />i would tell people about this product.<br /><br />give five stars for the key chain

5.0,Better than the factory Squale Mesh.
5.0,Love these cords! Fits is cute and makes me look slim
5.0,"Beautiful sweater!  Very soft and stretchy. The knit has a slight sheen to it, and the buttons are an unusual detail.  The collar is not a true turtleneck, but a mock turtleneck, which I actually prefer."
5.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry purchased it for my teenaged daughter the only thing is the chain although beautiful is way too long. So I switched hers for one of mine :)
5.0,Looks just as it did on line
5.0,Fits awesome keeps me dry while deer hunting and warm
5.0,My favorite watch so far. I love the fact that it does not make my wrist sweat like the plastic bands do. It’s light weight and very comfortable. Matches perfectly with the watch. I can’t wait to order a new one. I’ve had mine for two months now and it’s still in great shape.
5.0,"This jacket is really cute and stylish, and warmer than I thought it would be. I was surprised at how warm it was since it feel super “fluffy.” The size small fit me perfectly (5’5” and 115lbs.)."
5.0,I love it. Perfect fit.
5.0,"Absolutely love these. Good fabric good fit. I ordered medium. My size is 130lbs, height 5'5&#34;, waist (smallest part) 25&#34;, just above hipbones 28&#34;-29&#34;. Hem is a little long on me but I have short legs so I just fold them up once. Fit is comfortable and baggy, and yes - pockets galore for all your snacks."
5.0,Shirt was a great fit. Material was made of good quality and precision.
5.0,Purchased this for a 9 year old's birthday.  She enjoyed it.
5.0,"I bought this for a recent trip to Italy. I have several toiletry and makeup bags, but they were all two small or took up too much inefficient space. Plus I heard there is limited counter space in European hotel bathrooms, so I figured I should buy something with a hook. That was true- there was almost no counter space in any of the hotels, so a hook was an absolute necessity! This hook is small but it fits on most towel bars so you should be fine.<br /><br />It fit all the toiletries we needed for 2 weeks (my husband and I)- one outer pocket for toothbrushes and toothpaste, the other outer pocket for razors (so you don't accidentally cut yourself reaching in the bag). Everything else fit in the interior with all its pockets- shaving cream, lotions, facial wipes, shampoo, conditioner, soap, SPF, a bag of cotton balls, and even all the random what-if stuff (nail clippers, tiny scissors, band aids, bobby pins, etc). With plenty of room to spare! Granted, I did pack my makeup separately, but I do carry a lot of it with me. If it was a shorter trip or if I wasn't sharing the bag I could have fit all my makeup in there too.<br /><br />The carry handle is easy to hold (some are too stiff and uncomfortable) so if I was traveling by car I wouldn't even throw it in another suitcase. But since we only had carry-on luggage, we threw it in a backpack, and it took up about half the room. The only negative is that it's not that pretty- I don't like the logo on the front (ours was stuck on a bit crooked), and the nylon feels cheap and thin. A fun lining or a printed exterior would be a nice touch. But I can deal with the mediocre aesthetics. Just be practical and buy it!"
5.0,Love this bathing suit. Looks exactly like photo.
5.0,My son absolutely loves it perfect and adjustable thank you so much !
5.0,My boyfriend loves these and is planning on joining the circus soon.
5.0,Good price. No dislikes.

5.0,I need to know where to buy the power bank?
5.0,"I love Eileen West.  Their products are highly detailed, like I've never seen on any lingerie.  Beautifully crafted too.  Gorgeous quality fabrics and weaves that wash well. This robe is also well made with a lovely soft gray and white pattern. There's a beautiful gathered back detailing that provide a more shapely fit then standard wrap robes.  Also beautifully trimmed in a cotton lace.<br />Excellent customer service as well.  Thanks for your own attention to detail.  Great Shop.  I have many Eileen West gowns all in 100% cotton.  Very cool for the summer.  Very feminine."

5.0,I love the way this is made and looks! I have been waiting for this to arrive..when i pulled it out I could tell this was made very well. I usually wear a 38b to 38 c.. I ordered a 38b .. well it is very tight and barley fits.. the shoulders have a good amount of adjustment.. mine is all the way to the largest setting.. and barley gets me by.. I were to reorder .. i would go one more size larger minimum. . And larger cup size at the most. Beyond that.. it supports .. wicks.. and breathes good.. they even sewed a clip for your head phones in the left front.. its not a money clip..lol..

5.0,These shoes are just perfect for my husband. Wearing them now has allowed him to go more & do more with more comfort.
5.0,"LOOOOOOOOOVED this outfit!!! I ordered a small and it fit perfectly. Normally a 34 B cup chest and typically wear size small clothing. 1-3 pant size, 2-4 dress size. The top is double layered so no need for a bra. Skirt IS slightly see through but nothing that some spanx can’t fix! Recommend getting high wasted spanx or under garment just to match the height of the skirt to avoid any possibility of lines. But I just wore mine more distressed rather than flat so I wasn’t concerned. Material is very soft. Skirt does ride up through out the day but not majorly. Wore this for my bridal shower and will again for my bachelorette and rehearsal 😊"
5.0,Great shorts! Shipped super fast! Thank you!
5.0,"Attractive design and rugged two-ply all-leather construction are what attracted me to this belt.  I liked it so much that I ordered a second one in another color.  When ordering, I would recommend orderering one size larger than your trouser waist size or you may be disappointed. Size 36&#34; was exactly right for me, though my trouser waist is just 34&#34;."
5.0,"I got this ring for my wife .I use to work in the jewelry industry and I know fine work when i see it ,this ring has amazing craftsmanship it looks really really classy and great for a event. i think the size runs a bit small so maybe get a size bigger .i would highly recommend this to friends and family .received for unbiased review !!"
5.0,"Perfect fit, good material. I am 5,7 . chest 36, waist 56, hips 39, ordered size s and fit as expected"
5.0,I love them so much!!!! I can't contain my excitement having them on my feet.
5.0,Wanted a red holiday sweatshirt.This is very nice and fit as expected.
5.0,"I love how durable and stylish this card holder is. I have received so many compliments on it.  I love how easy it is to carry around when I don't want to carry a huge purse if any, with me. Plus, my business cards fit perfectly and it prevents them from bending. It's high quality and I can tell I am going to have it for many years to come!"

5.0,"I really like these....I have aI am 5'7&#34;, 150lbs, I wear a 34D and I have a  BIG behind...after buying I  read the comments and was scared that I would look so inappropiate. When I received them I tried them on and I love it. My behind is not hanging out or anything. Really nice for hot weather. I plan on buying one in every color I can find.I bought the grey one and it looks just like the picture."
5.0,"It's a lovely bracelet, bold but pretty red, the charm is very pretty too, and love that's it's the Shema Israel Jewish Prayer. I don't know the thread red string would handle everyday wear and tear use (leaving on in the shower or during sporting activities, etc..)  Thread Red String<br />but it might be OK, the lobster clasp is a plus but the charm I think is a bit delicate for hardcore outdoor activities. But for $10.99 with free shipping, you can't beat the price and if you're on that wants to leave it on always, I'd say buy yourself two. I wear mine when going about my day but remove it before bed or showering, etc...For the price, you can't beat it. The charm actually has little tiny diamond accents along the circle. Something I didn't notice in photo or description of item. If, like me, you enjoy Kabbalah and Judaica/Jewish themed jewelry, this just may be your cup of tea :) -"
5.0,My daughter loves these. They stay in place and are made well.
5.0,Love them - have them stuck all around the house and in my purse

5.0,So cozy comfy!<br />I have several colors. Even after washing the inside stays silly soft.
5.0,I give this strap 5 stars.  It is a thick strap.  It feels that is WILL be durable but time will tell if it holds up to the wear of its intent.  I will report back in a couple of months.
5.0,"I love this cardigan, it's perfect for spring weather. The material is soft and comfortable. I bought a Large and it fits perfect."

5.0,"I am taking a trip to the beach soon and have been trying to find a beach cover-up to add to my collection that is cute, unique, comfortable, and functional.  This cover-up is exactly what I was looking for.  It is a little bit on the large side…but it doesn’t bother me.  I actually like it and think it gives you the laid back, comfy beach-bum look.  The material is nice and durable.  The cover-up is well made and flawless.  I received it quickly and can’t wait to wear it on my beach trip.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I do almost all of my online shopping through Amazon and base most of my decisions on the reviews and ratings of others. As such, it is important to me that I also provide honest, unbiased, helpful reviews to others."

5.0,"I purchased the set of 24. They are all very cute, different in their own way & great quality. Unfortunately they did not fit my ankles (Cankles I’d you’d say) but their costumer service is outstanding. They made not have fit the way I’d hope, but I am confident in this company and their product. I will have to read the details before purchase."

5.0,Daughter loved it. Just as described. Fit nicely
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, my wife loves it."
5.0,"I absolutely love these nose. Its small and cute and stays in. My nose has been pierced for approximately 9 years and I  have been through countless nose rings, huggy, studs, hoops, you name it, I've had it. I definitely try to wear gold only to avoid my nose ever breaking out. My issue is that I've always lost my nose ring or they got uncomfortable after a while but these really are the real deal. My best friend came in town and saw these and fell inlove with them so I bought her one as well and she's been rocking them too. I've had these for maybe 8 months or more and they haven't changed or anything."
5.0,It’s perfect!! So cute and cozy!!
5.0,This bag is a life saver I used it to my travel to Asia and I bought so much stuff and couldn't fit it in my suitcase good thing I had the foldable duffel bag. I was able to fit my clothes and all the things in my bag and didn't have to buy
5.0,I ordered 2 sets in blue and purple and get so many compliments whenever I wear them.

5.0,Cute and very sturdy

5.0,"Great and fun looking socks, made well."
5.0,"I enjoy this belt much more than I thought I would.  It shows up great at night, has a decent battery life, and is easy to recharge.  I am a dog owner and always worry about us both being seen while walking at night.  I have been putting it on the dog for the past week and know I need another for myself."
5.0,Since I have to wear a mask it might as well be pretty

5.0,"Very cute and very sturdy!! I love them. They really make outfits pop! They're also great for any costume with round glasses so that you have a very pronounced look.<br /><br />It's always weird for me to have to wear contacts with glasses (since I always wear glasses anyway) but these are very comfortable.<br /><br />They came with their own soft cloth case, which was nice for how cheap they were. I turn it inside out to rub smears off of them since glasses always have a way of getting yucky.<br /><br />Overall, perfect!! Thanks for the great buy!!"
5.0,"awesome product w/ great design and super fast delivery.  Holds my 2015 Mac book pro 15&#34; in the middle section, my ipad fits perfectly in the side pouch and the cords in the other side pouch."

5.0,Just what my grandson asked for.  Great color.
5.0,Perfect fir traveling soft fitted material flares at hips & tummy to hide any flaws and fits in all the right places.<br />Knee length I’m usually at 10 I ordered A medium & small kept them both fit great I like the small it’s a little sexier flirty yet still gives me room at my bottom.<br />HIKA is my fav I ordered all their similar dresses love them all ❣️
5.0,"Completely shocked at the quality and materials used for this price ! I normally purchase uggs seasonally, however after a month of heavy use, my uggs sole typically is noticeably flattened and the interior shearling severely matted. These Sioros for me were a wildcard purchase and i expected somewhat nicer material than your average $30 pair, but i was wrong.  These obliterate the longevity of anything in uggs mens line for almost half the price. I am a heavy wearer of slippers and these lasted me over 6 months. They probably would have lasted longer had i not primarily worn them sockless. After 6 months of heavy use, the sole only somewhat compressed and minor wearing of the shearling occurred on one inside heel. Remarkable product when compared to your $100 uggs."
5.0,"I've owned this piece for over a year now, and It looks the same as the day it arrived in the mail.<br />I take special care of my jewelry and wear this piece at least two times a week.<br /><br />I've experienced no issues with the clasp. It appears though that many other reviewers have!<br />So do take note of that and pay attention to your bracelet lest you lose it!<br /><br />This beauty is the perfect size to add believability and looks like the real deal.<br />I am a very satisfied customer. Here's hoping it will last more years to come!"
5.0,Fit my watch very nicely. No issues.
5.0,"These are really cute! They don’t look cheap and so far they’re comfortable! The did have a strong machine oil smell, but it went away after a few days"

5.0,Great quality love my earrings
5.0,"Great fabric, love style, very comfortable!"
5.0,My son usually pees through every night. when he wears these pajamas he does not. there is something about the way they make them that keeps them from soaking though. I love that so much about these pajamas
5.0,Very nice perfect fit
5.0,"I wear cardigans all the time, and I love the 3/4 length sleeves the best. This one has a really nice bright black color and is super soft and light. It flows really nicely. I ordered according to the size chart and got the 3X. My measurements are 47"" bust, 57"" hips and it fits all around and is nice and flowy. It looks great with so many tops, jeans, and skirts. I own several cardigans in this type of fabric, and I never dry them in the dryer. It seems to keep them looking good longer."
5.0,"Lightweight sweater that fit more like a petite, but that's fine. Casual, yet classic"
5.0,Recomiendo estos lentes 100%! La calidad es de primera. Sobrepasó mis expectativas!

5.0,"We didn’t have an umbrella pole for our table and umbrella. This one fit perfectly, so we’re able to use the umbrella finally!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:e328afd49ce0c3ab0e7765226513b83b]] I really like this bracelet set. As far as I can tell, the crystals are genuine. I find this smaller bead size to be more ideal for daily wear as they don’t feel bulky or get in the way. The stretchy cord they used for these is strong yet stretchy enough to get it over my hand easily. I’m a big fan of the colors/crystals and love that the listing includes Lucky 3 (always wear your crystal bracelets in threes!)<br />I will post a photo later but definitely would repurchase this set. Would make a nice gift, too."
5.0,These are great really help with swelling. I sit at desk all day working its nice to not have swollen feet for once
5.0,"My search for the perfect backpack was much more difficult than I anticipated, but it finally came to an end with this bag. It really is a nice looking bag, and the size is perfect. I purchased it because I wanted something a little dressy that would leave me hands-free and also hold everything I need: wipes, water, bottle, wallet, phone,keys, pouch. This holds everything very comfortable."
5.0,"These are the warmest PJ’s I have ever owned!  They are definitely good ones for cold winter nights!  Well made, easy to zip on and off.  I love the fit and feel of these!  They run a little small in size, laundry well with no shrinkage and are very well made.  I would highly recommend."
5.0,"I've tried several competitors and this one wins hands down. While the audiophile in me doesn't like the fact that the left and right channels are reversed, I love everything else about it. Great battery life and awesome bluetooth range. Best Bluetooth Beanie!!!"
5.0,As a new floor nurse I was struggling with achy feet and legs. These made a huge difference with feet and leg fatigue. I won't work another shift without them!!
5.0,"Nice fit, comfy"
5.0,These are the best work pants in the world. They look like work pants they feel like yoga pants and they’re actually long enough for my giraffe legs. 10/10 but them
5.0,Fan of the stop action Christmas shows. This is it.
5.0,It’s perfect and my daughter loves it
5.0,I read a ton of reviews prior to purchasing.  This is a nice dress - not too dressy but good for a simple event. It is slightly see through but not too bad.
5.0,Was used for Halloween party and worked great!
5.0,"THIS RING IS GORGEOUS!  IT'S A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, BUT THAT'S OKAY WITH ME, BECAUSE I NEEDED  A BIGGER RING, AND THIS ONE FITS THE BILL PERFECTLY.  I LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS ON MY FINGER, WITH NO ROUGH EDGES OR ANYTHING, AND I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT."
5.0,Fits well. Soft and cozy
5.0,I bought these for my 18 month old son and they stay up! Very pleased with them and will buy more in the future.

5.0,"After it is washed and dried it fits snug and cozy. Inside pockets are amazing, big enough to fit a small book, trust me I did it.  I wear it everyday and it hasn't torn apart. it has held up very nicely and I will be buying from Jinx again."
5.0,"Fit great. My go to pair, look better in person."
5.0,I bought as a gift for a friend.
5.0,"So far, I really like this billfold. I wanted something small to fit in a smaller purse and this one does.<br /><br />Update, I not only really like this billfold, but LOVE it. It’s small and holds all I need it to."
5.0,Awesome product! Meets needs very well.
5.0,Just what I was looking for. I sized up for a looser fit since I wore it to work. I've been wearing it as a night gown since Halloween has ended but I'd definitely wear it out again as well.
5.0,"Comes with an awesome tool for pressing the pins out to adjust size, everything is metal so hopefully it lasts longer than the plastic crap that came with the watch. Really looks slick. Great bang for your buck on this buy."
5.0,"Did not discolor or cause rash on skin of wife who is very sensitive, good price, quality chain, quick shipping."
5.0,"Overall, I really liked this product. I wished that it would have fit better to my fingers, so I could use the touch screen function more easily, but other than that, its wonderful!"
5.0,"Bought this to dress up t-shirts to wear at work.  Wore with a silver small scarf ring and it was nice.  Not long or too thick.  Wore  in spring and it wasn't too hot--- just what i was looking for.  the lace along curved edge along with sparkley floral design on fabric is nice. Shape is triangular thinning to ends about 1-2"""
5.0,This is a beautiful bra. The lace is soft and quality it good.
5.0,"Very nice fit, cute & comfy"
5.0,this is my fifth one.  good quality
5.0,Ordered 3 Hawaiian shirts for my very picky surfer hubby. This was the only one he kept. The material was a little better quality and the design was authentic. Worth the money if you are looking for a shirt you’ll have for several years.
5.0,"I absolutely love this sports bra, especially for the price.  I bought it to wear during yoga class and it suits that purpose just fine.  The bra is kind of flimsy, as many pretty sports bras are, so if you're looking for something to wear during heavy duty cardio workouts, I'd look elsewhere.  I'm a 34 C, but my boobs are more wide than protruding, and I'm not sure how this would handle my breasts if they were any bigger or heavier.  It came with some really funny looking foam inserts that were thankfully easy to remove."
5.0,Love this bag! Very light and has a lot of pockets.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1a0f838034ee2cf702ca9813bce201d0]] It is unique .i got admire is more valuable than the money . i change the chain
5.0,Reseved these yesterday and I love them! They're big on her now wich I knew they were going to be . Can't wait till she can start wearing them. They look just like the picture. Although they did come kind of wide but fixing the shoe laces fixes that also + I wasn't expecting them to come so early as it was said they would be here in Jan bcoz they come from China I got mine in a little less then 2 weeks.  :)
5.0,Keeps you warm on cold days.
5.0,My husband was very happy with the quality of this belt
5.0,"Nice size, nit to big or small. Can hold a lot of items without being bulky. Long strap that is adjustable."
5.0,Love the low heel boots. I bought them in brown and found them so comfortable that I bought them in taupe. I added an insert for a little extra support to help out my knees. With a thin sock there's ample room for the insert. Ordered a 6 and they fit as expected.
5.0,Beautiful! Comfortable. Buy maybe a slight size smaller. It's perfect though! Just get it you will NOT regret it. I hate buying online but a friend got this dress and loved it so I got it as well. It's terrific.
5.0,"Great quality slippers, comfy & sturdy. Look great. Would repurchase!"

5.0,Wore with a crop top to my bachelorette party and got rave reviews! Highly recommend
5.0,"These create a whole different vibe! There’s such a variety to choose from, and I was even able to share with my sisters. I also appreciated that they come individually bagged. Highly recommend! I would definitely purchase again (you know, since I gave some other styles away 😉)!"
5.0,"I bought mine from the retailer as Amazon didn't have the color I wanted.  High quality, super cute.  It ran a little large though.  I got a medium, and it's baggy."
5.0,Bought these for my daughter-in-law who is a bee keeper. They are really pretty. They are very bling bling!!!
5.0,Perfect size. Pop of color!!
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous.  Holds my readers in the front pocket. Holds my phone inside.  Beautifully made.  RFID protected.

5.0,Looking sharp with Navy Pride!
5.0,"very nice, well made  very happy"
5.0,Amazing quality
5.0,"Nice earrings i got the correct size along with the two small earrings that i paid for thank goodness, I love them nice choice can I wait to wear them"
5.0,"This is the kind of dress that’s flattering on pretty much anyone. Hubby loved it. The fabric is nice. Sturdy, soft cotton. Comfortable. Felt pretty in it and it’s ready to wear."
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits my face perfectly unlike some more gender neutral masks that have too much fabric. Cute too. Most importantly, my glasses don't fog up while wearing this mask."
5.0,Perfect Mario costume! Fit as expected! Would recommend
5.0,These Warri ya are so cute!  I love them!!!
5.0,Beautiful and easy to use.
5.0,Beautiful shirt I turned around and ordered a teal colored one and I love ❤️. I wish they had other colors that weren’t  so bright!  That’s just me most people probably like the bright ones!
5.0,Super soft. Great stretch. Look great.
5.0,"The dress fit me perfectly! I am 5' 5 1/2&#34;, about 185lbs (curvy/thick). I ordered the black in a large. The straps seem a little thin so I would be careful with them, but other then that it's perfect."
5.0,I have thin legs and they help at night so I don.t bruise one leg from hitting or pressing the other.
5.0,"The medium fits my skinny 5'9"" frame perfectly, and they feel great while swimming.  So far, they have held up perfectly well."
5.0,Lots of great pockets.  Comfortable to carry with a laptop and chromebook inside.  Very well made.
5.0,"I am always leery of reviews, so I feel like it's a gamble when making a purchase. I wear an L-XL. I tend to sway to the larger side when buying on line. I bought an XL & they are a perfect fit. I also tend to larger than perfect waistline, and they fit there too. I like the fabric. It is stretchy & firm. Not to thin or binding. I will but a 2nd pair."
5.0,"No scratches,  has withstood constant daily wear for 9 months. Arrived in expected timeframe.  True to size. Would order again!"
5.0,"I have a few similar, but this was the first of this exact style. It looks great and I get many compliments on it. I wore it until the color was gone and the charms had fallen off (my watch is very well loved). I would buy again when I need another band. I usually go through one every 6 months and this was exactly what I got out of it."
5.0,These are pretty cool.  Easy to attach and fit very nicely to my glasses.
5.0,Love this dress! I used for the office! very good!
5.0,Crazy cute and amazingly comfortable.  I wore it nonstop for months while swimming in pools and the lake and it never tarnished.
5.0,"The kimono/yukata belts (or tasuki) are exactly as advertised, good quality, and well-wrapped, no surprised since they are imported from Japan."
5.0,"I would say I don’t like leggings but I love these.  My only complaint is I wish they came in a long.  They are warm, comfortable and look great."
5.0,Love these! They feel like a designer brand without the cost. They look incredibly chic and come with a case and cloth case!
5.0,Excellent... 5 stars!
5.0,"Love these tank tops. Fit great, so cute and good material.  I purchased 4 more !"
5.0,I am 5’6” 137 lbs B cup and I ordered a medium. It fits well just slightly large but comfortable. I got the green which is a grass green not army green. It is a beautiful shade of green in my opinion.
5.0,I bought them to hang my husband's cowboy hats and they work perfectly!
5.0,"I will be using this bag for an upcoming Spirit Airlines flight. The bag is very well made and definitely fits the size requirement for the free personal item. The bag will pay for itself after one use, so I would definitely recommend purchasing this bag for short trips, or trips to warm destinations. Also, the bag was delivered very quickly, within 3 business days after ordering, and well before the estimated arrival date."
5.0,"The HUAN XUN Chiffon Lightweight Oil Painting bird scarf is very soft and I love the pattern and I'm sure my daughter will too.  If feels even softer then a T shirt, nice and light but still functional and goes well with many different colors and outfits.  The bird colors are bright and stand out, the stitching is tight, only one loose strand but was easily cut and I'm sure it won't come loose or unravel down the road.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for an honest, unbiased review."
5.0,"Super cute bag at a really good price. Really easy to make it your own, although if you are buying this with the intention of putting pins all over it, like I did, you should know that the upper half of the bag has a really thick layer that is too thick for a pin to go all the way through and still fit its backing on. That front pocket is a single layer of fabric, but the rest is thicker. The patch on the front is easily taken off with a seam cutter, so I can utilize as much space as possible for pins. So despite that slight disappointment, this bag is well worth the money!<br /><br />Edit: it is now august 2019, and this bag is still the best thing Ive ever bought! No rips or tears along seams, ive even hand washed it once after a bottle opened inside it and its still going strong. Also realized I can put pins on the top part as long as I have locking pin backs 👌  Dont spend more on a bag, this one is great!"
5.0,Delicate & elegant looking piece.
5.0,"It's bigger than I expected. Don't expect it to out it in your back pockey. LOL. Plenty room for your cards, 2 key slot, a coin purse, and for you paper bills. It can also fit an iPhone. In have a Samsung SG6, and that fits perfectly. The leather feel and metal detailing is a plus. One thing though, the snap buttons was a little to close to the card slots so you'd have to position your top cards aeay from the buttins to really close it."
5.0,Love this shirt.  Fits perfect
5.0,"A great fitted dress that also masks the belly pretty well. It's not sheer, but choose your underthings properly based on color - I couldn't wear darker underwear or tights under the pink dress."
5.0,This is a well made and great looking garment. The color is perfect and the fabric is very soft. Really pleased with this purchase and the price was a deal. Would buy again!
5.0,Very fast shipping! From CA to FL in 3 days! I love these glasses. This is my second pair. They fit great.
5.0,Amazing. I love it
5.0,"Very nice for the price.  Perfect gift for younger girl.  I should have bought more!  Niece will love it, it's perfect."
5.0,I love these hoops I have black pink and silver they are light weight and lots of sparkle. Shipping was fast and come on a nice gift box. The clasp is sturdy and no fear of them falling out. only wish they had the stones on the inside also so you can see them at all angles.
5.0,The top of this outfit is awesome!  It’s super soft and the pumpkin is nicely appliquéd on.  The pants and scarf are a silky fabric but comfy.
5.0,The dress fits well nice material true to size. I am 155 pounds 5&#34; 7&#34; 36b bust and I bought medium
5.0,"A great belt for everyday use, the build quality feels solid yet soft and the hardware is solid. The pictures give an accurate representation as well. I'll be using this as a casual belt and so far is as held up very well. I usually don't like to buy brands I've never heard of but this was a great value and I'd do it again!"
5.0,Cute hat. Packaging could be Improved came stuffed Inside narrow long box and brim is pretty warped.
5.0,"I haven’t worn it in the rain yet, but two 50 mile bike rides with winds of 12-15 mph shows me it’s an excellent wind breaker.  Will evaluate rain-proof after riding in the rain."
5.0,"Fits very well (I'm a medium/small in junior sizes and an extra small in women's). Although it runs a little baggy for me, it's a nice comfy look that I've been complimented for by friends and coworkers"
5.0,Beautifully styled casual shirts. Fits like a dream. Will definitely buy more!
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for to compliment my other jewelry.  Fits wrist . Great quality material . It works.  Great Packaging !
5.0,[[VIDEOID:8dd61bff15ff392c26897c3c2db52cc4]] Reloj genial. Definitivamente una compra que nunca te arrepentirás tendrás reloj para mucho tiempo .. un clásico de Casio

5.0,Bought for my child. He loves it
5.0,It’s so soft and comfy. I love it
5.0,"This was a present for my wife, who loved it so much she changed clothes so she could wear it when we went out on the town. Excellent craftsmanship and design!"
5.0,"These dresses/tops make up my versatile wardrobe. I love for the summer paired with shorts. They are so cute with leggings, jeans and boots/booties in the winter paired with a long sleeve turtleneck. It pairs great for layering. So don’t think you can only wear them in the summer, I wear mine year around. These dresses fit so nicely and without clinging. I’m a plus size woman and they cover my apples and rolls nicely. Perfect fit."
5.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up. My son is 5 yrs old. I ordered 6-7 because I know pajamas are usually fit. This is just comfy on him, roomy but the shorts fits well, not tight."
5.0,"O.M.G.!!!! This necklace plus the earrings are absolutely beautiful, Excelent quality, the antique gold color is just like the picture shows: If I could give more than 5 stars I will give 10 stars."
5.0,Very nice tote bag when traveling Carry's a lot off items good to have on trios

5.0,Love it so much
5.0,"Very beautiful ring, I love it. By Kim D."
5.0,"Nice underwear, very good quality"
5.0,The first ones I received were far too tight to the clasp to fit my ears and the seller sent replacements promptly. I have sensitive ears and love these.
5.0,"Was skeptical buying clothes online, but the fabric is very soft and sleek feeling. It washes and dries very well. I like that the sleeves are a little roomy. Most sweaters are too tight to wear another shirt under it. I can fit a thick long sleeve comfortably."
5.0,These rings are outstanding.  I have purchased 3 from this seller and they are some of my favorite rings.  I keep watching for new styles to appear.  Very masculine designs and I get many compliments on the rings.
5.0,La verdad crei que no durarían pero sirven para el trabajo duro los recomiendo ampliamente
5.0,"Omg. I love them!  They are literally the most comfortable house shoes I've ever owned. The soles on them also allow for a little light outdoor walking (like to the mailbox, etc)."
5.0,The boots way better then those pvc boot covers really next level
5.0,great pants im ordering another pair
5.0,"Love it..... material and dress! For a cruise, roll it up and NO wrinkles!  I cruise a lot and this is what I really want... wash, dry, roll & pack in suitcase!  No Ironing required!!"

5.0,OBSESSED. i wear it on my flights now lol
5.0,So cute and flattering. Washes well.
5.0,Works brilliantly with my Apple Magic Mouse!
5.0,Very comfortable. Love that there’s no buckle. I wear them on my golf skirts and use to catch my putter on the buckle.
5.0,"Very pretty, looks just like the picture. Maybe even prettier, very sparkly. Holds my cardigan in place and looks so good."
5.0,For perfect and keeps me warm for my outside work
5.0,So cute and comfortable
5.0,This is my second pair of LA Idol Jeans.  They fit so well and this style is dressy and comfortable!  I got compliments on them right away.  You will love them and the sizes match up well too.  And if your tall- you will not having flood water pants!
5.0,"True to size, satisfied with my purchase"
5.0,Was surprised by the hard case and a soft case that came with it.
5.0,"These boots are comfortable. I got them in white, black and gray. I ordered them in 6.5, the size I normally wear and they fit perfectly. They are really warm and waterproof. I recommend them. I've had many complements on them. Very stylish for winter boots."
5.0,"This is a very warm and soft onesie and I’m glad I got it. I’m 5’8/175lbs and I got a 3x let’s just say me and probably 2 others could fit in it lol.But no on a serious note I ordered it big because I like mine to be roomy.I’d say they’re true to size,but the main thing is you will be warm and comfortable. I actually have to open it because it gets hot, I wish it had a panel in back for going to the bathroom but it doesn’t so oh well I’m satisfied"
5.0,Love these shirt stays. I wasn't sure they  would work but after my first time wearing them I must say &#34; they work &#34;. I had become very frustrated having to tuck my shirt tail in several times a day to avoid looking like I had a pop belly and unkept. Now I can breathe free. Worth the investment.
5.0,"Excellent belt. May have ordered a size larger next time, but the product should be commended."
5.0,it was great it served its purpose
5.0,Very very classy top
5.0,"I'm 5'3 ,ordered size S, and it's fit perfectly. Good quality. Highly recommend. 5 star"
5.0,I have long naturally loose Curly  hair.  At bedtime I wash my hair add leave in conditioner and put it in this ridiculous looking cap voila!! Perfect circles in the morning. Don’t go out with this on your head. You will be laughed out of town.
5.0,"Really cute, fits well. Be prepared to iron it, though."
5.0,I really like the steampunk style and these don’t disappoint. Purchased these due to the pandemic and they work well when having to wear a mask in public. They also go well with my steampunk glasses. Haven’t tried them yet with the goggles and hats but they are really great. They are better than some of the other extra filters masks I own and also the reusable feature is really really handy.
5.0,My item came late but I was notified it would and came the next day. It came in a plastic six lock bag that was thick. The charms came in another ziplock bag and was not broken. A little cloth bag came with the charms to put them in. Over all I’m a satisfied customer ordering these charms for jewelry making.  I wish the description for this item had a list of what the charms were. The charms are great but have only certain animals and multiples of them. It’s not 100 different animal charms.
5.0,These are the cutest earrings i have ever seen!
5.0,"great wallet, nice leather!"
5.0,Russell Athletic quality. Never a bad purchase.
5.0,"HOW ARE THEY ONLY $5??? They are gorgeous and high quality, but them rn!!"
5.0,These are very easy to use and give a nice professional look to the key fobs that I made
5.0,I like this top. It is comfortable.
5.0,"It fits our boy really well and can be done up with the velcro strips on the front. My dog has short front legs, so the sleeves are just a tad too long for him and he ends up tripping when he walks, so that's something to keep in mind if you have dogs with short front legs. I'll probably just roll them up and sew them in place to fix that problem."
5.0,good big size and superior quality materials and workmanship
5.0,Very sexy but classy. Nice stretch to it. Got tons of compliments!
5.0,"I wanted this so bad, but my husband was afraid it would look fake, would turn me green, or cause a rash. I wanted it! I wore it all day against my skin with no problem and tons of compliments! This is so beauriful!!"
5.0,"The earrings are absolutely beautiful, the stones are clear and glisten nicely from their cut.  The first day I wore them I lost a backing and panicked as obtaining a replacement can be a daunting task where many posts are in fact different sizes.  The loss was in no way the sellers responsibility and yet still the sent me replacements without hesitation.  There was absolutely no muss or fuss, just a willingness to help.  These are beautiful earrings, much prettier in person than in the image, and the seller is amazing.  Buy with confidence.  The only disclaimer I will offer here is that I am not a jeweler, I cannot assess their value; I can tell you that your woman will not be disappointed by their appearance."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly
5.0,he loved it
5.0,Wearing one as I write this review.  I get compliments.  Love it!🎄🎁
5.0,Lovely warm product except the zip disturbs a bit
5.0,"I love this dress, I want it in every design!  It's so comfortable, beautiful fabric and I got so many compliments when wearing it.  I wish the belt was thicker, but otherwise very nice."
5.0,This jacket was perfect! Kept my son warm while fly fishing and hiking through the snow in 9° weather.
5.0,Very nice hat and glove set.
5.0,These socks are for a gift later this month. They arrived fast and look great.
5.0,I loved this so much I told all my friends. with all the loose skirts and dresses I could not find a slip that worked. This is just so perfect.
5.0,The only flaw with this is the ear holes are small. My ears are normal size. If you have large ears don't buy.
5.0,Excellent product and packaging ! Well done!
5.0,"The shirt fits well, just wish it had a choice of colors."
5.0,I bought this for my glasses that I am required to take off to go through security at work.  A great way to start my day off bringing Oz behind the wall.
5.0,Only sock that stays on babies feet
5.0,I wear a size 8 in womens and these socks fit me perfectly. If you're a Sailor Moon fan or just a lot of fun socks this is the way to go. They are comfortable they are greatly crafted and they look amazing.
5.0,Just what I wanted. Excellent quality.
5.0,"Got the Purple Medium as a Christmas gift and have been wearing it ever since. Washes and drys well (so far). Fabric is a great weight, not so thin you can see through it, but not so thick that it is too hot to sleep in.  Very soft to the touch.  This is a nice upgrade to my normal sleepware of oversized t-shirts. I wanted to buy more, but now the Mediums are out of stock. But, would definitely recommend and will keep hoping that Medium comes back in stock so I can buy more -- would be great if this was available in more colors than black and purple."
5.0,"The sweatshirt is a little tight, but still comfortable to wear."
5.0,"This inexpensive little wallet is even better than I expected. Small size can fit into jean pocket; the design accommodates everything you might need in a wallet. Sturdy, attractive.  I bought it in glossy yellow--very pretty."
5.0,I have earrings purchased from the store that is famous for these crystals. Those are expensive so I cannot wear them certain places. Bought these to wear in their place. Wow. These sparkle so much. The size is perfect. They are so pretty. I've since bought 2 more pair of these.
5.0,"“No gift is too small to give，nor too simple to receive，when it is wrapped in thoughtfulness and tied with love.”This crossbody purse is a gift for Valentine's Day, I think it is very suitable."
5.0,"Super cute! Slippery when on tile, so I plan to rough the bottoms of the shoes up with sandpaper. Other than that, they are great."
5.0,Looks sharp.
5.0,I have 34 DD breasts I still wear it with a black bra. Dont wear with any other bra with this breast size or because it doesn't cover about an inch of my under boob
5.0,I don't like purses to begin with and large pursed are so heavy but this one I love.  It holds a lot and is easy to use for shopping and casino hopping.  I love alll the pockets because the purse is shallow and it is as easy to fin as though you are looking through a file.  Everything shows upon opening..  Very happy with it.
5.0,Shirt is rue to. Very good quality shirt. Thinking of buying another one ina different color.
5.0,Beautiful bag! It does not compromise my professional get up in the office.
5.0,I WILL NEVER TRAVEL WITHOUT PACKING CUBES AGAIN!  These change how much you are able to pack and keep everything completely organized.  I wish I knew about this sooner.  Usually what happens is that your clothes get messed up and out of order however with these cubes everything is completely in place from where you left it.  Get these cubes and never look back.
5.0,Save you plenty of time during clean up!
5.0,Great material and made well
5.0,"Good price, good product"
5.0,"Exactly what I had hoped for, a compact bag with plenty of room for everything.  I was even able to store my hair-towel in the bag."
5.0,I love this ankle bracelet
5.0,Nice sweatshirt. My son loves it!
5.0,I send this to my cousin as a gift all the time.<br />She loves this nightgown!! She is handicapped and cannot leave the house!!<br />I am so happy to give her a little pleasure!!!
5.0,"Love this visor! It is well made and very comfortable, not to mention adorable! I machine washed mine with a light load of clothes on gentle, hung it to air dry, and it still looks brand new 😍"
5.0,Super cute suit!  Fits too small for me but kept it fir my 17 year old because its seems like an overall good quality suit.
5.0,My granddaughters love these socks! Very comfortable.
5.0,good quality good price
5.0,My child loves it and wears it most days. It is holding up very well.  It is a good size and weight and the rings all move just the way they should.
5.0,"Beautiful belt and the 'ratchet system' works perfectly.  Just cut to fit, slip on the buckle, close the latch and you're in business."
5.0,"Very happy with the lights, worked like a charm and was delivered on time."
5.0,Quality and fit was great
5.0,Pretty but large
5.0,Beautiful! Just what I wanted!!!
5.0,great gloves would buy them again!
5.0,"I’m very pleased with these masks. They’re form fitted far better than others I’ve come across and are more comfortable for my daughter to use during the school days. I was also happy there is a bridge piece to conform to her little nose, which makes them all the better for a proper fit."
5.0,"I bought the red monster shoes for my two year old grandson. He has somewhat wide little feet, and they fit him well. They are very colorful and he loves them."
5.0,"I only bought this for the charm, I kinda threw away the necklace...  The charm is so cute and the perfect size for a small woman. it is adorable, she loved it."
5.0,Love that it comes with shorts and pants for summer and winter. My grandson loved it!
5.0,Love these. Super soft and comfy
5.0,Great shoes!  They fit my 6 year old perfectly.  His coach loved the shoes and the colors and wants all his wrestlers to wear them!
5.0,"Es bastante cómoda y de buena calidad, y se ve muy bien el color de 'heather grey'"
5.0,Super soft and comfy. Fits perfectly
5.0,I should have bought these years ago - makes working on the car & garden easier
5.0,"I love the scarf, it's warm without being bulky & uncomfortable.  I plan to get the brown one as well.  The black one is perfect for any occasion day to night, or dress to jeans.  I bought the black one as a gift & liked it so much I kept it for myself....<br /><br />I have not been able to find this scarf in other colors!  I REALLY wanted another one.  It out shines any others I've seen."
5.0,"Loved the fabric and color of this onesie. We fot it for our 5M old girl and she has egzema. We put it on during nights and I think it is much gentle on her rashes compared to cotton clothes. However it is pretty thin so we put her in a sleeep sack too. She is tall and skinny so we got 6-12M size and it fits ok.<br /><br />Snaps are a little hard for the first couple time but they get easier after 3-4 days.<br /><br />I ordered the red one of this product in same size but now returning it back because it was way too small/tight and  fabric didn’t feel the same as my first order so I am suspicious second one might be a knock-off.<br /><br />Anyway, original product is great so I give 5 stars."
5.0,"I liked this bag because it has so much space to put your items in. I bought it so I can take it to the gym and it’s just perfect. I’m able to put my towels, extra change of clothes , shoes and other items. My water bottle fits great in the front pockets. Also it’s very comfortable to carry on the shoulder. Overall I’m happy with this purchase. I’m buying the burgundy color bag for my sister."
5.0,Great for after workout recovery.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet.  The included tool allows for easy sizing.
5.0,Very well made & cute design! Exactly as described.
5.0,"I bought this for my son last year, it was a tad big, never shrunk, and this year he is still able to wear it.  It has kept all the vibrant colors over a year of washings."
5.0,"I bought four of the Nofeda Bands and will buy more.  They are way less expensive than the ones that Fit sells, are easy to install, comfortable to wear, and are very secure on my wrist.  The light colored bands do get dirty (especially newspaper ink) but do clean up with a little soap/Dawn and water."
5.0,Great quality and thick! Super cute!
5.0,Well made and very good likeness to Peppa! They do run a bit small...and I haven’t washed them yet. Priced well!
5.0,Love this shirt. One of my favorites of the season.
5.0,4XL fits like an XL - love it!!
5.0,"I love this shirt!  It’s perfect for hot weather and looks good all day.  Not see through, but I wear it open with a tee underneath."
5.0,Its very cute but small
5.0,Its heavy and not flimsy ar all. It's looks good and made with quality.  For the price I didn't expect it too be so nice. Its unique and came with a free tree wooden key chain.
5.0,Much nicer & bigger than photo. Excellent for $!
5.0,The elastic band and the draw string effectively hold the sweat pants in place while a person is running/walking. Recommend!
5.0,Perfect size. About half the size of a standard backpack. Great for carrying essentials.
5.0,"A lot bigger than i though, but really cute! I got it for my friends that is obsessed with tweety and she loves it. ☺️"
5.0,Inexpensive but good quality. Very happy with it.
5.0,These are so cool. Very pretty and easy to screw on.
5.0,Super adorable<br />My daughter uses these for dance .<br />She loves them
5.0,"Good material, I love this dress I ended up getting it in 4 colors"
5.0,"Great little watch. Would be really well suited for a small person who wants simple/elegant.<br />Casio, has a great name in the watch industry and for good reason. Their watches are durable and well thought out. The only negative I can think of on this watch is that the backlight is pretty much useless. I lights from one side and doesn't illuminate the full length of the display. So, if you have better eyes than me then you may be able to tell time in the dark.<br />With that said this is my daily go to watch. simple, comfortable and certainly not a fashion statement, unless you are looking for the simple black look. I it is a comfortable watch to wear. slim, both in width and in thickness. Not a large bulky watch. Standard LED display which is easy to read(in the daylight), with crisp characters.<br />It displays the time in hours, minutes, and seconds. I have never understood why they always show the seconds on these digital watches. I don't need it and wish that it was an option that could be turned on or off. I understand that some people want, need, it but I don't. It also show the day and date but not the month. I guess it thinks that you should at least know what month it is. I'm good with that.<br /><br />Nice watch, for the money you can't go wrong."
5.0,Pretty color and feels good on the skin.
5.0,It came in a tiny box but it unfolded and is perfect.  Not creased or damaged.  Great mask for the price.
5.0,Wearing to my daughter's school disco dance next month - very cool earrings!
5.0,Grand daughter loves it.
5.0,"Love my new porkpie. Great price. Fits great. Looks great. I purchased the L/XL size hat .because I need the XL size. Initially I was concerned it might be too small, but it fits perfect. The matching sox are nice too."
5.0,I bought this for my daughter.  It is so comfortable; she wears it all of the time.
5.0,I expected Cargo pants but I’m delighted with this material. It’s like a workout legging with pockets. Perfect for the kitchen where I work!
5.0,This is the second watch of this type I have purchased. The first one lasted for years and I only replaced it because the band finally broke.
5.0,My friend loves her beanies! She said they fit great and aren't itchy!
5.0,Cant beat these for the price!!  They are great everyday with jeans and a t shirt earrings!!
5.0,"My dad loves golf, these were perfect! For the price well worth it."
5.0,Elegant and comfortable.
5.0,I got this skirt for my sister for her birthday. It is such a pretty print. It looks like the picture and it is perfect for work or a causal event. I love that it has pockets. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful. It really stands out and it is super unique. The way it hits past the knee is a very modern look. I would highly recommend this skirt. I hope this was helpful.
5.0,These were exactly what I wanted and beautiful. They are very comfortable and easy to put in and take out.
5.0,I love this shirt! I wear it with leggings and boots and it is super cute! I read the reviews and saw that it runs small so I ordered an XL I usually wear a medium or large because I don't like my shirts clingy. The XL fits fine. It is dry clean only but I washed on gentle in cold water and air dried and it came out perfectly. I have washed this way 2 times with no issues.
5.0,Perfect little sandal on a budget.
5.0,nice addition to my collection!!!
5.0,"Comfortable, fits a 6 foot, normal weight man."
5.0,"The suit fits like a glove!  Loved how it hugged the good curves, smoothed over the bad.  Lol.  I did wear my workout leggings underneath to make it feel more controlled, but also because it was chilly and the suit is a bit thin.  Not so thin that you can see through it at all, but its just silky, so its not warm.<br />The mask was so weird, and made me feel super claustrophobic.  The eye pieces didn't quite fit where they were supposed to, and I wouldn't wear it inside because they are tinted like sunglasses.<br />But the suit itself is pretty kick ass.  I felt like a real superhero that night.  I could wear it plain inside, but wore my sneakers outside so it wouldn't tear up the material on the feet."
5.0,Very Roomy and comfortable.
5.0,I Love my dress it is so Beautiful. . .
5.0,"The jersey fits as expected... because hockey jerseys are usually a little loose fitting. Anyway, I love it. Not too hot or cold. Been wearing it comfortably in this mild fall weather we're having. Only criticism I have is maybe they could offer this jersey without the name and lettering on the back? I would have opted for a jersey without it being personalized."
5.0,"This shirt is high quality, not just a flimsy tshirt.  The screen print seems durable, and overall feels like it will hold up to many washings without peeling or fading. As of this writing I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this seller in the future."
5.0,It was a gift for my husband and he loved it! Exactly as described!
5.0,"Great hat!  I have one for golf and another for fishing.  It holds its shape and is amazing.  I've also used it when working in the garden at 100 degrees,  it really keeps you cool.  I don't have a lot of hair on top so I don't know how well it would work otherwise."
5.0,They are good pair of earrings
5.0,"Was looking for a longer short to wear to the gym.  These are perfect.  They stay up at the waist and the legs stay in place even when doing squats.  The material is thick enough so you can't see through them when bending over and thin enough to not be too hot.  I liked them so much I ordered another pair.  I'm 5'7"" and weight 155lbs and the mediums fit perfect."
5.0,This is fantastic quality and fits my 7yo perfectly
5.0,They are just what I needed
5.0,I had so much fun watching my kids and his friends playing with this light.<br />When the sun went down I turned the lights off and let the begun
5.0,I get compliments on this watch wherever I go.
5.0,Very comfortable. I love the adjustable tops. I have problems with foot swelling and the ability to loosen or tighten is wonderful. Foot bed comfortable. My new go to shoe for around the house.
5.0,Bought for my son! He really liked the color.
5.0,Nice look bold and light .get one for yourself
5.0,Fits very well. Love the material
5.0,they were great!  just as expected!
5.0,These earrings were exactly what I was looking for.  Quality silver and easy to fasten.
5.0,Super soft and cute and fits great
5.0,The product looks just like the picture. Beautiful and came earlier than delivery estimate! Very satisfied with price and product :)
5.0,"It’s been very cold the past week or so, and I can sense a long and brutal winter coming up.  While I have suede gloves already, I wanted something even thicker that could withstand the extreme cold.  I came across this pair and decided why not…here are some thoughts:<br /><br />• Size: These gloves come in various sizes, but consistent with other comments, I would say that they tend to run small.  I typically buy S or S/M gloves, so I decided to go with M and am very glad that I did as these probably fit me closer to a S on other brands.  As shown in the picture, I have somewhat long fingers and thin hands, but even on an M, the glove does not go very far beyond my wrist.<br /><br />• Fit and Functionality: As expected, the gloves are much thicker than most suede gloves.  In terms of functionality, the thumb and index finger have touchscreen capabilities.  While it can be a little hard to maneuver due to the thickness of the gloves, I do appreciate the effectiveness of the glove tips for touchscreen use.<br /><br />• Warmth:  As advertised, these gloves kept me very warm in near zero degree temperature.  In fact, my hands were close to sweating, so I think these are a better fit for sub-zero temperatures.  Not a bad problem to have!<br /><br />In summary, these gloves are great for extreme cold conditions, with the touchscreen capabilities a nice added bonus.  If you’re bracing for a cold winter, then give these a try!"
5.0,"Great fit, Nice Looking logo & Well Worth the price!!"
5.0,I love my  wallets  It’s beautiful
5.0,Super Cute and Comfortable.
5.0,Darling
5.0,"My husband uses this sling bag as he travels on the train daily. It isn’t too big but he can pack quite a bit (books, phone, snacks etc) into the sling."
5.0,"fine material, great quality, a bit bigger than I thought, but a wonderful bag for someone who likes big bags."
5.0,It's wider to fit folded frames comfortably.  Colors inside and outside are bright and fun.  Nice clean construction. I'd like to see more bright color combinations like the green/orange I purchased.
5.0,Fits well.. I ordered the 3T-4T for my 18 month old. He is very big for his age (in the 90 percentiles). He wears a 3T in shirts going on 4T here soon. The length is fine and the material is kind of stretchy like spandex almost so don't worry about it being too tight. The sleeves are a tiny bit long on him but that's okay because he can grow into it.
5.0,"I love mermaids and I was looking for one but they were all expensive, and this one is good quality and beautifully made I LOVE IT!!!!!"
5.0,Great quality for the dollar
5.0,"Great minimalist wallet for kids (and probably adults too). I bought this wallet, well actually two of them, for both of my middle school age kids. It is time for them to carry a little bit of cash, a debit card, and a house key. These days there really is no need to carry more than that. The choice of color is good for the kids to pick their own. Note that the strap that comes with the waller seems very fragile. I use a separate cable to hook up a key for them onto the attachment point."
5.0,Dress was beautiful.  We purchased 4/6 to fit my daughter who is a 3 normally.
5.0,Perfect. Wish they were available in an even smaller size for toddlers
5.0,Wear well!
5.0,Perfect! Fits my 8 year old great and it is the perfect mask for summertime ! Nice and lightweight! Great for going somewhere outdoors but still staying cool and safe. The ear parts keep the mask from falling down on my 8 year old which is wonderful .
5.0,"Wow, what a perfect, gorgeous wallet.  As a purse freak I know my wallets, and this one is great.  The two zipper sections are great -- one for coins and the other for paper odds and ends, business cards, etc.  The magnetic closure between the two zippered section is so very convenient and clever.  Plenty of slip pockets and credit card slots inside, as well as a big-enough ID holder.  The material is wonderful, buttery leather. Can't say enough.  Well worth the price."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted! It was a hit for my event! I am 5’8 200 lbs and I got a large and it fit perfectly!
5.0,"Loved this costume! It was higher quality than I expected. Also, I measured myself prior to ordering, followed the size chart available on the post and It fit exactly as expected! Thank you for a great product!!"
5.0,I just got it today and i love it its beautiful ring
5.0,Worth the price and nice size for my keys.
5.0,"Perfect dress, soft, durable, ruffled sleeves for an elegant look, split is high if you got back😏. Amazing dress for my 30th! I loved it!!!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4ff65ccdff68956b59ff868135220e59]] I loooove this necklace!! It’s good quality and very sturdy. It is longer than I expected so heads up on that.
5.0,Se ve de buena calidad.
5.0,"Will definitely be buying again! Lofts good, makes my girls look like I haven’t had babies 😂 very comfortable!"
5.0,"These are really comfortable, come true to picture and on time. The greys really pop out and look super stylish. I wanted something other than a regular pair of black leggings and these fit the bill. I really like the way they fit me and they're totally a great pair of pants, and I might buy it again for my friends. These are a 10/10 for me."
5.0,"Great item, great seller! I can now wear me new Sperrys thanks to these socks!"
5.0,This is a Beautiful & elegant necklace!
5.0,"First, let me be the first to admit it- I am a head band junkie. Living in a super hot climate, headbands are a necessity, not just a fashion accessory. Over the last few years, many brands of head bands have appeared (some with amazing marketing strategies for a relatively simple piece of fabric!) claiming to be both soft in texture and able to stay on during physical exertion. This headband makes the same claim, but lives up to it. It is amazingly soft, and stays on no matter what I am doing.<br /><br />The fact the fabric is bunched on one side allows it to be worn in a multitude of ways. My personal favorites are bandanna style (with the bunched part on bottom and the wide part keeping ALL of your hair back) and &#34;hippie&#34; style (on the forehead instead of the top of the head). In either position, it stays where it is placed, without being too tight and causing a headache. This headband also fits wonderfully under my bike helmet, and is not too warm when worn that way, even though it is black (though I plan on soon ordering more colors).<br /><br />Bottom line: Awesome headband. Seriously.<br /><br />Please note that I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The fact that I may have bought it for less than list price does not sway my review in any way. Liken it to using a coupon at the grocery store, if you will; you still expect a quality product for your money even if you have received a discount. I have no relationship whatsoever with the seller. I depend on Amazon reviews when making my own purchases and do my best to thoroughly and accurately describe each item."
5.0,I’m really glad I stumbled across this piece. It’s very lightweight and breathable. Great for places with hot temps. You’re able to be Fashionable and stay cool all in one. I ordered a Medium and it fits great!
5.0,I wear these shirts all the time. Great fit and great colors.
5.0,I have very sensitive ears and knew that finding hypoallergenic earrings would be difficult and these are amazing. I highly recommend these earrings if you have sensitive ears.
5.0,Bathing suit so cute it covers a lot I weight 180 pounds height 5:4 chest size 40 b xlarge fits even a large would fit on the top! the bottoms are xlarge fits perfect! Very loose top love it so is not tight!!
5.0,"All authentic paperwork included.  Brand new.  Was able to register serial number with Citizen.  A little bulky, but that’s to be expected with the built/in radio for picking up UTC.  Love the accuracy that provides.  Was tired of setting my self-winding mechanical TAG every other day."
5.0,Love this bag!  It is not too big and not too small.  Holds all my things including my i-pad
5.0,This is so pretty. I bought it for my daughter and now want one for myself.
5.0,Love your rings<br />18 and counting
5.0,bought for a gift  they were very pleased
5.0,Half the price vs same style at boutiques! Pretty thick material and adorable
5.0,This is gorgeous.  So surprised for costume jewelry.  I am wearing it out tonight when I have dinner with my husband.
5.0,Love the color. Something different for a change
5.0,Great fit. Fast shipping.
5.0,As expected great
5.0,I was reluctant to buy it bc costumes are usually so cheaply made-- this one is actually very well made.  Great buy.
5.0,This is a beautiful dress. I love the fit! Totally satisfied with this purchase!
5.0,Hubby LOVES it!
5.0,"I bought this as a maternity dress, and holy cow, it is amazing!! So comfortable and stretchy, yet still breathable! At first I was worried it would be a bit see through, as the fabric is a little thin, but it shows nothing while it's on (reminder - hot pink panties show thru almost anything. go for black or nude if you are worried about visibility)<br /><br />This mom-to-be would buy 10 of these if they came in different colors!"
5.0,"This is adorable! I ended up buying a bunch of backless shirts just to show it off!  It doesn't provide a ton of support, so I'd wear this around town, but not for a jog. And it's small. I'd say anything larger than a 36 band or C cup wouldn't fit well. But for anything smaller, it fits well."
5.0,Fits extremely well.
5.0,My daughter ordered these for her pet cat with birthday money. She is thrilled.
5.0,"This shirt is awesome.  I actually got it to golf in, but I think i'll be wearing it other places too.  I am not a polo type shirt person, but this one is super comfy, thin and flattering.  I love that the sleeves are a decent length, as most women's sleeves cut in the middle of the armpit for some reason.  Not this one! I love it."
5.0,Best belt I've ever onwed
5.0,beautiful as expected
5.0,Love this dress. I got the black one.Can be dressed up with a necklace. It's very flattering and so comfortable that I ordered two more in two different colors.
5.0,I was a little iffy!! But it actually ended up being such a cute little dress and i love that it somewhat backless but the ties in the back are thick enough to hide any unwanted back fat :D
5.0,"Like the material, fits great"
5.0,"Much to my surprise, found out I'm a deep or dark autumn color tone. I needed a quick reference for shopping and this filled that need nicely. Small enough to fit into a small zipped bag I throw in my purse. This palette covers all of Autumn so if you're deep like me, just ignore the lighter pure colors and stick with the muted darker ones. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Material, colors & embroidery were good quality. My granddaughter was very happy her gift."
5.0,This is beyond comfortable! It also does much better than I expected in terms of support. I have never owned one of these types of bras before because of my size thinking there was no way it would provide any support or fit properly but figured I would give it a try. I am so happy I did. I also like that the padding can easily be removed as that was the only thing I didn’t love when I first tried it on.<br /><br />Great product at a great value.
5.0,I bought this for my wife's new Fitbit and she loves it. MUCH better than the bands that came with it.
5.0,Perfect fit and love it
5.0,My daughter has been wearing this leotard for 3 months now. Fits perfect and has fun sleeves for a little something special.
5.0,It is a very &#34;fun&#34; piece of jewelry.  I get lots of compliments.
5.0,Very large but perfect for my witch prop !!!
5.0,Love the material! Very flattering high-waisted skirt.
5.0,Very stretchy and comfortable
5.0,Great fit. Great quality
5.0,The socks fit just fine and are good quality. Super cute!
5.0,"This is the exact light-weight article I was issued in the military; except that it is missing the green silk-nylon liner and it has the up-to-date multi-cam pattern. These light-weight Gortex jackets were a rare issue back in the 90's when I served, and they were much sought after because of their convenience of packing; as opposed to the heavier Extreme Cold Weather parka we were issued. As far as I can tell, this is the same jacket without the liner. A good buy."
5.0,They where all beautiful ; )
5.0,Great maxi made with great material!
5.0,It was so beautiful that many people turned their heads and asked me where I bought it.They'll buy it back again next time they need it
5.0,"The lenses on these are fantastic! I've had several other inexpensive brands of fishing sunglasses and have been very disappointed in them as the polarization on them seems to be nonexistent or crooked. Thankfully these are not them! The polarization is not only good, but both lenses are perfectly aligned just like the much much more expensive brands do (Oakley for example). This is REALLY important when sight-fishing! Did I mention they're scratch resistant?<br />Now for the frames. They're really light and really comfortable. To be honesty, they're so light that they feel like you could break them easily, but they're unbreakable. It is quite a big positive that you could sit on them and not snap an arm off, eh? It's also pretty cool that you can chuck them into your tackle box and know they'll be just fine the next time out. Kinda like the Tupperware of sunglass frames. Just like Tupperware though, you shouldn't put them in the microwave.<br />They come with a case, a silk cleaning cloth, and a stainless steel eyeglass repair tool which has a keychain, flat tip screwdriver, a phillips tip screwdriver, and a small socket that I couldn't tell you the size of but I assume it's a common eyeglass size."
5.0,"Light weight, strong and very comfortable."
5.0,"Overall, this is a nice workout shirt! I ordered the ""black"" and it is definitely a gray color, as other reviews have mentioned.<br /><br />From other peoples' reviews, I expected this top to run small, so I sized up (ordered a Large, black) and the fit is as I expected. The fabric is quite stretchy and nice and thick, so it offers a bit of compression and is surprisingly comfortable!<br />For your comparison, my measurements are 39""-30""-39"" and I wear a size 32F/34E bra.<br /><br />The cutouts are cute, their design is pretty flattering, and the sleeve cuffs are long enough to be turned back without creating uncomfortable pressure points if you don't like wearing the thumbholes (which are comfortably positioned and finished, unlike some other tops I own).<br /><br />It handles moisture fairly well, and offers a combination of both coverage and breathability thanks to the holes that are part of its design.<br /><br />I have only washed it once so far, but it seems to have help up nicely so far and I expect with proper care it should last me a decent amount of time!<br /><br />Overall, I am surprisingly pleased with this top and am happy to be able to recommend it."
5.0,"Love this crocs, so comfortable."
5.0,"Ordered mine in smoke blue. The colors and design look exactly like the thumbnail! Fits perfectly and arent as big as other cyclops glasses. Does not, however, come with the Micro fiber cloth/bag."
5.0,Really nice quality! I've had it for a few months now and have zero complaints.
5.0,My little cousin loves them 😊
5.0,"I was worried if I would like it. It arrived and fit perfect. It is very stylish and very happy with the purchase. Looks great with a long white shirt, jeans and boots."
5.0,"I love white gold belly rings because they last. This one is cute, sexy and the perfect touch to my petite frame. The CZ sparkles perfectly. Great value too!"
5.0,"These pants are adorable and super comfy. My grooming clients love seeing them on me. Great conversation piece. Fit well, very stretchy and soft. Love the pattern, works great.It is very comfortable and cute. It's flows nicely when you walk about. I will be purchasing more."
5.0,"Needed something for after surgery that would not be binding or tight across my stomach and this was wonderful! Comfortable and easy to wash, did not shrink and has pockets!  I bought 2 of them and wear them all the time."
5.0,"Finally a dress that looks like it does on the model, on ME! I am 5'4, 125lbs and I ordered a small. In white, you want to skip the undies and maybe add a pad or pasties to the top. I added thin removable pads. I got a dozen compliments and it show cased all the right features."
5.0,"These are literally the softest pants I have ever worn. They are so comfy and flattering. They are great for lounging around and working out. If you’re debating buying these, just do it."
5.0,Gave this as a gift to one of my students (teenager) at the end of the school year. She loved it and still wears it to school this year every day:-)
5.0,"I originally bought this for my friend's birthday but when. It came in, I thought the olive was a little too brownish, so I was unsure. I ended up ordering another in black and letting my friend pick which color she wanted. She chose black. I ended up keeping the olive for myself! I love the style and softness, but do wish it was more green."
5.0,"Got these for my wife, bought 1 pair at first, then 4  more. She loves them, they're the same compression as the $50procompression socks, only much cheaper and cooler designs. It's a win win."
5.0,I took a risk by ordering these online and it paid off. These glasses were cool and offered just the right amount of tint to shield eyes from bright beach sun. Cute style and very current style. Excellent price.
5.0,Love ❤️ The Sparkle.
5.0,"I purchased these ski goggles for my son to go snowboarding at a local skiing and snowboarding resort. He tried them on and wore them on a sunny day, and they work every bit as good as a pair that would cost 10 times as much! They were lightweight fit his face perfectly and were comfortable and did their job."
5.0,Love love love these sunglasses. I got the tortoise shell for my trip to Cancun next weekend and I can’t wait to wear them. They are definitely the same as pictured. Buy these for festival season and you won’t regret it!
5.0,Fit as expected. All in all this is really good. Only thing they could have done better was at the top where the rubber strip are to prevent from sticking could have been sewn to the outer material. It does roll because of this.
5.0,So soft and comfy. Good for lounging or working out. I like the multipack option as well.
5.0,"The color, fit (Med.), everything is identical to picture and given dimensions. The waistband is thick but not in a bad way. Higher quality than you’d prob think at this point.  Even the drawstring aglets are metallic.  The shorts material has a slight stretch to it, which is nice as well. Overall, solid purchase here. I’ve seen nothing comparable in quality at this price."
5.0,Quality materials and well made at great price..  PERFECT !
5.0,Finally! A great looking pair of polarized sunglasses at an affordable price! Thank you! *Update... bought these in Aug 2017 and as of May 2020 I still LOVE these. They still look great and are in great shape - even after wearing in work outs / heat/ pool / etc.
5.0,Bought this set for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Very soft and cool
5.0,This is perfect for any fan of National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. It fits true to size. I normally wear medium & ordered my normal size & it fits perfect wearing over a T-shirt. Not too tight…not too loose. I was very excited to wear it to my family’s Christmas get-together.
5.0,"Large fits great, Medium was too tight in chest area, 36DD size Medium usually.  Nice material and thick adjustable straps."
5.0,Perfect. Easy. Everyone loved it.
5.0,"My boyfriend loved it, fits perfect with a little room on top"
5.0,bought for my daughter for a Christmas gift.  She loved it
5.0,Allso small
5.0,"I am really impressed with these socks - and they are my new favorites! Really comfortable, medium thickness, and very soft. I wear a men's size 10 - and unlike many quarter high socks that tend to be bit small to accomodate a wide range of sizes, these fit just right. They feel very high quality, and I anticipate they will last a long time, and grow softer with washing."
5.0,"Enameling beautiful! Wears well, good quality for price!"
5.0,"Soft, great quality"
5.0,Tan workout set looks exactly like the picture and fits perfectly has very soft material as well!
5.0,This dress is so cute on! The fabric is soft and silky. Im 5'4 and normally wear a medium and it fit great! Perfect midi dress for summer.
5.0,Bought for my husband because the others the had were too small.  These fit perfectly and he lives them.
5.0,Runs a but bigger but love the dress we did go up a size according to their size chart.
5.0,It arrived quickly and looks great.  It does wrinkle easily though.
5.0,This is a great bracelet that has really nice and solid adjustable piece that truly makes it one size fits all!
5.0,Order a size bigger than normal. But my son loves it!
5.0,I love it and many people have already remarked it.
5.0,Not bad for a cheaper version
5.0,"It is a really nice skirt. I have a red, blue,green and peach colored ones. I plan on getting white and brown one."
5.0,"This watchband is classy, sassy and perfect to feel girly!!"
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants and would probably buy them in every color! They go on as leggings meaning they don’t have a zipper and button which I wasn’t expecting. But in the end it was perfect because the elastic band gave a lot of stretch. Material is not cheap at all, these pants are just so much fun. I love love love them!"
5.0,Super good quality for the price. The skirt is elastic and fits perfect. Overall perfect 👍
5.0,Rough tough and read for work. Perfect when broken in. Pick larger size than you measure out. Makes you want to chop some wood on a snowy day!
5.0,This is great! Great to be worn at interviews or weddings..
5.0,"I love these overalls. Every single time I wear them out, someone compliments me on them. I bought them to wear when we do renovations on our home, but honestly they are super cute. They are definitely oversized, but you can tell they are made to be that way. I’ve had them over a year, and I e gained & lost 30lbs and have been able to wear them the whole time."
5.0,Looks really nice. Fits  good. Only dislike is that it is not the exact color shown on the site. strings that hang are not adjustable. The item still looks good and fits good on a 5'3&#34; 135lbs woman.
5.0,It’s a little hard to change out the lens but overall great product! Getting compliments left and right with these sun glasses.
5.0,"I really like these earrings. I own the green, black, and white ovals, the pink ones, and also the blue arrow shapes. They are heavy so they feel expensive. So far, they are all good as new. I really like them!"
5.0,"Wearing this shirt gives me a greater feeling of being protected when riding the cycle. In temperatures above 85 degrees, it does make me a bit sweaty, being all synthetic, but riding in the daytime in summer is always that way. Price feels slightly high to me."
5.0,"Very pretty, not too bold,not too big, very attractive"
5.0,Looks good with jeans.
5.0,"Really nice glasses, very classy, but a Little light for designer glasses,I thought they would be more heavy."
5.0,Perfect collar stood up the whole time
5.0,"This product is a must-have for anyone who owns a Fitbit.  Mine fell off several times before I finally discovered these little gems.  I just can't understand why the company that makes Fitbit ever came up with that silly clasp they use, but the Bitbelt solves that problem.  Get some before you lose your Fitbit!"
5.0,Super cute! Super comfy. Will be buying others as well!
5.0,"Great fit, nice hat. I would reccomend."
5.0,"I am very happy with the cases. They are exactly as advertised, maybe nicer. I really love the soft plastic inside. doesn't scratch my phone and holds it securely inside with openings large enough for all cables. Thank you."
5.0,Cute pink dress with pockets. If you want it to look more structured then get a smaller size and it fits perfectly.
5.0,My little niece had so much fun giving these out and they look better in person than online. Can't complain for the price.
5.0,"I love this, it came with a case and the seller emailed instructions on how to take care of the goggles."
5.0,Really beautiful.
5.0,Fit good right from the begging
5.0,"I own many PB tops and purchased the red one for the holidays. I'm 5' 2"", 98 lbs. and a 34C and got a small, my usual PB size. Although the sweater has some stretch, an extra small would have been a little too snug in the bust. I'm delighted with the color, the medium-weight texture of the sweater and the way the stitching emphasizes my hour glass figure. It's  perfect for holiday gatherings or casual winter wear and I like it so much I may have to go back for the grey one. Thx PB for another winner!"
5.0,Perfect fit and comfortable
5.0,really beautiful!
5.0,Really loved these pants!
5.0,This is my go to comfy dress to put on after work.  It is flattering and not frumpy at all.
5.0,Super cute earrings
5.0,It came on time and looks amazing on me =)
5.0,"Wore this under my wedding dress, it definitely holds everything together or more like smoothed out your imperfections. It doesn’t have much tummy control but that’s OK I wore a panty girdle with this and it was perfect."
5.0,"The G-Shock GBX-100NS-1JF arrived and I could not be happier. The MIP display is everything I hoped it would be and the viewing angles are amazing. I’m used to wearing a G-Shock King which is a huge watch so I was concerned this watch would feel small on me. It did at first but once I got used to the smaller size I truly enjoy wearing it. Just a note, the watch isn’t small it’s just smaller then I was used to. All in all it’s a great watch and I couldn’t be happier with it....... that is until they make a solar version."
5.0,"Perfect size medium, beautiful not flashy or cheap looking, dress up or down and love the colors, every day wearable with everything, great investment thank you"
5.0,The fit great and you can't beat the price for 3 shirts.

5.0,The picture doesn't do this pendant justice. It is absolutely beautiful.
5.0,I’m very impressed with this products packaging. It comes in a round tin with a clear top. The bracelet is inserted into a foam cushioning. The chrome links and a additional piece is inside in a poly bag. It looks absolutely great! Very stylish. It’s worth every penny.
5.0,Exquisite bangles - beautifully hand crafted with tiny semi precious stones - very very worth buying and gift worthy packaging.
5.0,In one word - Excellent! Bought it as a gift for my wife after her excitement with the others I had bought in the past. She was thrilled to say the least!

5.0,"It is gorgeous, unbelievable price for a stunning piece of jewelry. Thank you."
5.0,"We bought this as a present for our friends son. He loved it!I did go up a size just because pj's tend to be so small. He's 4, little tall for his age. 5 fit great"
5.0,I have been trying to find a good wool shirt to wear more as a lightweight shackets for the fall. This shirt fit the bill. So great. The quality is perfect. The wool is lightweight and the color is beautiful. It will go nicely with all my khakis and safari style accessories. I am a woman and purchased this wit lh idea that it would fit a little boxy. It did not disappoint.
5.0,Just a beautiful watch band!!! I would recommend it for sure!!!
5.0,"Fit really good, works well with the phone.  Not that warm But nice in a pinch for pumping gas or just out and about."

5.0,Sooooo soft and cuddly and wide enough to actually catch spit up! Can't pry it away from the baby.
5.0,Very beautiful. I love it
5.0,They are sort of heavy but not too heavy to wear comfortably. They look great!
5.0,My 4 year old wears size 12 youth. These socks fit perfect!
5.0,So comfortable! Lace is not itchy at all. I ordered wrong cup size but that is on me. I am in love. I have been looking high and low for a comfortable bra that is also pretty. this does the trick!
5.0,so comfortable
5.0,Ran a little small so the medium was just right! I’m a 36/B - C. It’s an athletic material but very soft and opaque. I took the pads out with no issues! Definitely recommend. It’s about a medium Support.
5.0,Me agradó Gracias ☺️
5.0,Great ties and the men love them.
5.0,Bright colours perfit fit
5.0,"I purchased these socks as my ankle swells.  I was skeptical, because I do not like any kind of socks.  Purchased two more packages, helped with swelling, fit well and are very warm."
5.0,My 9 year old loves these!  Super cute and comfortable.
5.0,"Came on time, had a strong plastic smell but I let them air outside and sprayed with Lysol other than that the product is amazing! the holographic glitter and the lights drew my toddler in! I got a size up so she can slip them on and off easily. Very well made"
5.0,The attention to detail is awesome. A classic piece of artwork

5.0,Gorgeous dress for my bitty. Very pleased.
5.0,good quality!
5.0,Great belt! Reversible feature works great!
5.0,For the price it’s well worth it!  You can’t be petty on this dress because it’s so cute and simple and I just adore a dress with pockets!  Buy this dress.  If you’re 5’6 it’s just perfect but I’f you’re  like me and like long dresses then don’t buy if you’re taller than that.  It will come to your ankle probably but not pass it.  I love this dress and I’m about to order the other 2 long sleeve ones!😁
5.0,"great product fit great will buy again and I will tell other, also I got my item faster then they say."
5.0,Never used them and still in the packet but very cute
5.0,I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS AND SO DO THE WOMEN THAT SEE THEM.

5.0,My daughter loves pink and I love my daughter so this bracelet was perfect. She was very happy when Ihave  to her
5.0,Sweet and frilly.  Perfect complement to any infant outfit!
5.0,"Although these are labeled as &#34;capri's&#34; these are perfect full-length leggings on me! I'm 4'10 and it went right to my ankles, which is perfect. I'm never able to get leggings without needing to hem them, so these are such a miracle find!<br /><br />The pants themselves are super comfy and stretchy! Definitely get these!"
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Gift from my husband. I love it!
5.0,Excellent online purchase
5.0,These spa booties are exactly what I expected. Very comfortable and touched with the smooth scent of lavender! Must buy!
5.0,Love the material! Very durable. And the clip is pretty great
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the dress. I love the soft rayon material and my daughter loves how it swings when she twirls. The color was exactly as pictured. The dress was a tad short, was not a big deal since she wears shorts under it anyway. She usually wears a 5T and the 4-6x dress was a bit small."
5.0,Son grandes como una moneda de $0.10. Lindas para toda ocasión
5.0,Worked perfectly out of the box!
5.0,Love them nice fit.

5.0,"Heaven, I am in heaven. Finally 2 days post surgery I have relief. I thought they were going to wrap me after surgery, they didnt.. to find a front zip bra was impossible. I searched and found this one.  It feels heavenly. Thank you so much. I am going to tell my surgeon. Reasonable in fact fantastic price and doesn't hurt my incisions. Thank you"
5.0,"This is the second Enso ring I have purchased. They are awesome. Fun colors, great fit and feel. Probably buy more in the future."
5.0,Made well and fits perfectly.
5.0,Very clear and fashionable.  Nice for a second pair.

5.0,Love it bought this for my boss
5.0,My daughter loves it!!!!
5.0,"Have been looking for something like this for years, now I've found the perfect sweatpants for me, comfortable, warm, fits well."
5.0,Super comfy shirt!
5.0,"I have a strap like this that was much more expensive, but really not worth the extra money.  I am a weekend hobbyist photographer and this strap is great so far."
5.0,"Fit perfectly, well made.  Very cute!"
5.0,"Excellent design, easy to slip your foot into and with the little cleats on the bottom, won't get stuck a smooth shower floor from suction.  Recommended."
5.0,Love this dress!! I’m 6 weeks postpartum but this dress is very forgiving. I have a formal event to attend and was pretty nervous about finding a dress that would make me feel confident. I have to say I wish I would’ve gone one size smaller because the it feels bigger on me in the bust and shoulders there is a fair bit of stretch to the material. I will also say if you are tall I don’t think this is the dress for you. I’m 5 feet tall and with heels it just hits the floor in front. Which is perfect for me but just FYI. The material is gorgeous and looks like a Adrianna Papel but is 1/3 of the price. Score!!!
5.0,This shirt is just what I needed for cardio. Didn't feel weighted down with sweat soaked t-shirt like other t-shirts I've worn in the past.
5.0,They arrived early. And exactly as depicted
5.0,These are my favorite sunglasses ever. I broke a pair I had for a couple of years and was able to buy this exact pair again. I think the quality is good and I feel good in them. They are a fun design and I get tons of compliments on them.
5.0,Love this color and get lots of compliments
5.0,I will buy one in every color. So comfy and easy to dress up or down.
5.0,"I won this organic tank top at a yoga challenge I participated in. Not only it fits as expected, it is also very soft and cute. So many cute designs to choose from!"
5.0,Muy lindo pero aprieta un poco
5.0,warm and my guy loved them
5.0,"Wife loved it,,nice weight,,great pattern."
5.0,"My kids are appalled I ordered this, but since I do not plan on wearing it out in public, I shall wear it proudly.  Because it's funny!!"
5.0,Bought for my grandson and it fit him to a tee!! He looked so cute in it.
5.0,My boyfriend loved this shirt and wears it all the time.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter to carry her gym clothes. It is sturdy and fits all that she needs. She carries her clothes and a pair of sneakers. It came on time and is a wonderful value.
5.0,"cute and sexy skirt, great  color"
5.0,"The case fits the phone perfectly and my daughter loves it.  The strap is magnetized so it stays shut or open when you want it. She doesn't use the stylus but it seems to be okay quality.<br />The screen protector is working well,  but use your own cloth to wipe the dust off because the included one isn't very good.<br />The case feels quality, not flimsy,  so I'm expecting it to last a while."
5.0,Super cute and I got so many compliments at work plus it is very comfy and bonus!...you can enjoy breathing because it's so light. I'll wear it in July! 🤷‍♀️🤣🤣
5.0,Cute and a good value
5.0,This is perfect for my vacation. I leave my phone behind a lot. This will keep it with me and plenty of room for cards I need
5.0,I wear a large/xl in old navy sweats but with these I have to order a 3x.<br /> (The ones with the pockets I had to size down to xl.)<br />Sizing is tricky with these but I do love the way they look and feel. I live in sweats being from the Midwest so after about a year the polo logo does start to look a little worn from washing and drying.
5.0,Good quality and very pretty!
5.0,Love it so much
5.0,My grandson is a big 3 year old and they are perfect!
5.0,Love it. So cute
5.0,Really pretty and came in recently above schedule
5.0,"These are absolutely gorgeous. High quality, beautiful!"
5.0,"I ordered these socks for my husband who is diabetic and has peripheral neuropathy in both feet.  Because he has no feeling in his feet, he has a difficult time standing up on our wood floors from a sitting position.  With normal socks, his feet tend to slide a bit when he does so, making it challenging to regain his balance.  These socks help by gripping the floor, keeping his feet in place until he can stand up and balance."
5.0,"I really like these sandals. They are comfortable to wear all day at work. I walk, stand and sit through out the day and even the first day I wore them they were very comfortable.<br />The only thing that is a slight negative is the space for the toes is definitely made for people with long toes. I have short toes so there is definitely some shoe sticking off the front. However the rest fits wonderfully so I am willing to over look this as it is just fashion and not function."
5.0,"Love my new Real Friends hat. It's super funny, love the little play on words/logo.  I like the bronze hole in the back for your strap to go into, it looks really nice as opposed to just a clip. It's very light and does not have a lot of structure but I like hats like that personally. I also think the seller has great service. Would purchase again."
5.0,The dress fit perfectly. Looks very sophisticated. Love the look!
5.0,"This dress has some give to it, it fit perfect in all the right areas. The lace works to your advantage and hides unwanted areas.. I am 5'8 and this dress is perfect length with 3 inch heels"
5.0,I am recovering from a fractured heel…these socks keep the swelling down and offer maximum support.  Absolutely in love with these socks …look no further…you want these!
5.0,Fit as expected. Great product.
5.0,Bought for my pregnant daughter.  She loved it.  Nice product
5.0,My son loves his new pajamas. The fleece pants are very soft. They fit great and seem like good quality.
5.0,"Awesome product, fits perfect in my face, really comfort, looks good, you can hang in your ear, easy to clean, protect your neck and your face, easy to care and is lightweight ."
5.0,"Every woman that carries a purse, that is! A super-handy thing to have in your purse so you can see what you're looking for in there. No more fumbling for the keys or wallet! Open the purse, the light comes on and you see what you're after! A fabulous invention!"
5.0,"Made for some tasty pretzels, pretzels that reminded me of Germany."
5.0,It’s beautiful !! True to size and good quality
5.0,"Very nice band.  It took a little while to get the correct fit, but after I did, no issues."
5.0,"love these ear rings, haven't taken them out yet. hahah, nice snap to secure the ear rings so the won't fall out. highly recommended."
5.0,Great idea to hold this little peds in place.
5.0,I recommend this long sleeve yoga top. It fit perfectly and material is exactly what I was hoping for. I do plan to order other colors.
5.0,Got this for my son for christmas and he loved it.
5.0,Loved this dress! Last minute purchase and it looked great and was super comfy!

5.0,Warm and comfy. I wear them a lot even in summer as the air conditioning seems to make our floor cold.
5.0,I really love this bra! Fits perfectly and keeps my boobs right in place.
5.0,It runs way to small. The product is cute though
5.0,Sent this belt to my son in San Jose California area and he loves it.
5.0,Gorgeous and cheap and fun
5.0,"Like the good quality as usual of Lands End and the pattern is very pretty, I’m 5’4, 125 lb, I choose size M, it’s a little loose, but it just comfortable good looking loose"
5.0,Light weight and comfortable.
5.0,My husband wears for work
5.0,Excellent my granddaughter was so delighted that she fell in love with the set.  it's every thing that a little girl desired.  Outstanding graphics.
5.0,"Recently my thyroid quit working and I have put in a good deal of weight.  As a result, I’m not very comfortable with my body.  However, I’m going to Hawaii and I need a suit.  Based on some of their other reviews, I ordered this suit and I’m so glad I did!  The fit on this suit is exceptional.  Im actually pretty pleased with the way it looks on me, which is unheard of!<br /><br />The fabric is good quality and thick, which makes it forgiving.  The cut is very flattering.  I love that the backside is ample enough that it stays put and doesn’t ride up when you move.  This seriously might be my favorite swimsuit of my adult life."
5.0,Perfect little dress for Halloween. Will look great with over the knee boots.
5.0,"I have a big head so they seem to fit tight on my head, but the I like the look.<br />And more importantly, the price was right!"
5.0,Cute costume!
5.0,The search has been on my whole life for this t-shirt!!!! And I always say that when you find something that is just absolutely the perfect thing buy multiples of it. Especially t-shirts jeans and shoes...I just purchased another one and I will be buying more. Hugs me perfectly. I ordered the smallest size and it fit my petite frame and my full small bust perfectly.
5.0,"So far so good.  Good quality, feels great."
5.0,This is her second pair in the next size up. they fit great and keep her little feet so warm!!!
5.0,Beautiful!! Even prettier in person! Well made bracelet & the clasp is not at all &#34;cheap.&#34; Really and truly is a good quality bracelet. Nana loves it and she is picky about her jewelry!! Highly recommend this item! You won't be disappointed.
5.0,Product came as advertised and works very well. Would highly recommend this product.
5.0,"Gorgeous...sparkling stones, looks real and great for a gift"
5.0,Pin is quality. Pickle rick is the man!!
5.0,This was a perfect Valentines dress! It was very comfortable. I got a medium which fit as expected. I’m 5’7 and about 130 lbs.
5.0,"I have no problem giving this product five stars because they are durable, sturdy and a great value for what you get. There was only one issue we had while trying to attach the clip to an Xbox controller, however, that was not at all related to this product and how it performs.<br /><br />I am surprised the durability of these small clips. I have three sons ages 7, 10 and 12 and even though they take care of their devices, for the most part, they're still kids and kids are rough on everything, no matter what it is. They use these clips with their LG Stylo 5 phones in conjunction with their Xbox One controllers.<br /><br />The clips fit perfectly if you use the standard Xbox One controller battery cover. Like many other gamers, we have rechargeable batteries, both battery packs and AAs. Most rechargeable battery packs come with alternate battery covers which are not flush with the back of the controller.  This caused an issue when attaching the clip to the controller.  As such, I would not recommend this clip for anyone who uses rechargeable battery packs exclusively. If you have the option of using AAs in your controller, this clip is for you!"
5.0,"I ordered a 18-24 month, because I have a chunky 7 month old and he's in 12-18 month clothes so I wanted to make sure it fit him. All around it fits him perfect. Very nice material but the pants are kinda thin, not like sweat pants. The hat fits him, but if you are ordering for a girl, I'd get her a different headband. This headband is big on me and I'm 23 years old lol. Otherwise I am satisfied with what I ordered."
5.0,"Love it! Great sizing, no flaws, accurate delivery times. Totally pleased."
5.0,"These boots were amazing! A bit snug but once you adjust the laces, they fit perfectly. Wore them in Las Vegas for the first time and they were the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn with no soreness or pain. Definitely worth it and looking forward to add more to my shoe collection."
5.0,Good quality & well worth the price.
5.0,"Purchased the crystal cat pendant for my teenage granddaughter who loves animals and adores cats.  Her cat is similar in looks to the pendant so it was the perfect birthday gift.  She was very pleased!  The pendant is elegant, definitely quality, looks expensive and is impressive.  Very glad I made the purchase!"
5.0,I ordered these pants for my husband for Father’s Day.  I looked for a specific pant that met a number of requirements. It had to be a soft comfortable lightweight material good for summer. The pockets had to be deep and have a smooth sliding zipper to hold In valuables. He wanted any color but black. The pant legs could not be to wide. I had previously ordered 3 other workout pants and they did not fit the bill. These pants were perfect. The material is so soft and comfortable. They look so good on. The pockets were just right. He loves these pants. I wish they made them for women. When I went to order more they weren’t any in his size. I will keep checking back.
5.0,"They are large, so I ordered another one and will wear them as earrings"
5.0,I've always liked the army style belts and this is just like the one I was issued 40 years ago. Good  solid design.
5.0,Fit great  I love that it keeps me warm
5.0,It’s a Mother’s Day gift for my daughter
5.0,Shirts came fast and well packaged. Fit very well. Will buy more
5.0,I hate to admit that I’m now that little old lady who keeps a pair of readers in her purse to hand to my husband so he can order off a menu. These are small and the case keeps them clean and ready for use.
5.0,"I'm 6'6"", 280lbs and the 3XL fit perfect"
5.0,"Love, love Amanda clothing line. Best fit ever. Been buying them for years and these shorts are great!!"

5.0,Love them!!<br />#autismsprinter
5.0,love the mask
5.0,Beautiful! Great colors and looks fantastic in my bathroom.
5.0,"Well really this watch was for a present! But it is really cute and elegant, thank u so much !"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:111b5676c70ddb30d858023a52c872e6]] This band is amazing! First, it has never fallen off like all of my other bands. I have showered in it, and wore it in the pool. Multiple times but none on purpose! It is still perfect. The video is from today and I have worn this to bed every night for months and months!"
5.0,I bought this for a gift and they love it. It has very good quality and has a broken in feel to it.<br /><br />I would recommend this hat to anyone.
5.0,"Nice, thin, perfect fit. My ring size is 4 1/2 and I ordered the 4. No complaints"
5.0,I was surprised at how well this dress fit. It is perfect for summer with a pair of sneakers or comfy sandals. Love love love this!!!
5.0,Nice suite fit great!
5.0,Bro this low key ugly but I kinda want my money so I’m five starring it. It’s nice and soft so I look like a slob but I feel lavish
5.0,great tie got for my bf he loved it
5.0,Wore a couple pairs of these for engagement pictures. They are very high quality & the colors are as pictured!
5.0,"This is a quality product that fits as expected. It's stretchy and comfortable and the cut is well placed on the top and bottom. The child is 4'8"" and weighs 80 lbs."
5.0,"Bought these biking shorts for my toddler girls, love them. They are perfect under their twirly dresses and for dancing attire.  The cream colored ones are a little see-through, no more than fancy little bloomers. The material is extremely soft and lightweight. You can’t beat the price."
5.0,Just as described! Thanks so much!
5.0,"Super cute shirt!! I get lots of compliments when I wear it. I am 5'8&#34;, 150lbs, 34D & ordered a medium. It's pretty loose fitting around the midsection and fitted around the boobs. Overall, GREAT shirt for the price. I have washed & dried it several times with no issues."
5.0,Adjustable.  Nice sweatband.
5.0,"I ordered a size large and I think this black shirt with white outlined stars fits pretty well. I do have a larger size chest (38DD) and there is a tiny bit of stretching in terms of being able to see thru the black shirt a bit near the top but not enough where I wouldn't be able to wear it outside the house. The rest of the shirt is solid black and doesn't look stretched at all. Given the current seller photo the shirt looks more like loungewear (the picture for the black colored shirt is slightly misleading as the shirt does not come with matching shorts) and to me it works just as well as a casual shirt to wear out. I am 5'6"" with a slightly long torso and the shirt comes down to about midway on my rear end.  It is a form fitting shirt and normally I have issues with that as I have a large stomach but I think the black color looks nice and flattering.<br /><br />I washed the shirt according to directions (cold water on the delicate cycle and tumble dry low) and had no issues."
5.0,Es de bien material
5.0,"Awesome dress. Super confortable. Super soft. Little passed my knees because im only 5”1, but with high heels it will look very nice."
5.0,"Very cute socks. My toddler son loves the little cars and the pattern they make. He points out each one. The material is soft and woven pretty tightly, so I feel like they will last much better than some others I've gotten from box stores. Size is exactly what I expected."
5.0,"My daughter has fat, potato shaped feet. These are perfect for her. She started walking when she got them!"
5.0,AMAZING PRODUCT! & even better seller! got a size too small & the seller had no problem sending the correct size. its amazing & really works!

5.0,"Cute, comfy pjs!"
5.0,"Think I got the right size difficult to tell. Certainly need time to fiddle about with to get the right fit and shape, but initiallly impressed."
5.0,I love these shoes!  They are as pictured and comfortable.
5.0,I bought this to use during the cold days where I live and it has been great. It is really stylish and it helps keep me warm.

5.0,Perfect just as expected they even came in a fancy box with a cleansing cloth and a drawstring case
5.0,"I really love these short because they are super cute! You can dress them with sandals 🩴,shoes 🥿, heels 👠 or tennis shoes 👟 and they will look cute either way!l Plus for the price you can’t beat it…and plus the Leopard print is trending NOW!!☺️"
5.0,I really like this little gem ... too bad the craftspeople at The United Streets of Art don't provide it as a men's billfold because I would happily buy it.
5.0,stylish and comfortable
5.0,"This is a really cute dress.  You can dress up or down. I am  Medium and big chested, Medium was a little tight around the bust and shoulder so returned for one size up, still wanted the dress... really cute."
5.0,Perfect!  I would buy again.  Thank you!
5.0,"I am so happy I made this choice! It’s leather, it’s beautiful, it’s fun, it’s colorful, it’s handcrafted! It reminds me of my hippy days, and that makes me SO happy.<br /><br />Be aware that there may be small imperfections because of the handcrafting, and because of the nature of leather. In fact, embrace them! My bag is uniquely mine!<br /><br />It’s not overly large, but holds a lot. The main part of the bag easily holds my wallet, my phone charger, my earbuds, and the lens kit case I carry for my iPhone photography. Everything else goes into the three deep exterior zippered pockets. There’s a smaller zippered pocket on the inside and a small open pocket for keys or lipstick. The strap is generously long for crossbody wear. You can shorten it, of course, but if you’re a bit fluffy, like me, it’s easy to adjust to fit. I wear a 2X. The buckle was set to the center of the available holes and it was loose on me out of the box.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this bag. I also hope this review was helpful to you. If it was, please take a second to hit the “Helpful” button below."
5.0,"Love this shirt! I bought the black one years ago at a store that's no longer in business and loved it!! I was so sad when I couldn't buy more, until now! Flattering and hides and any stomach imperfections. Just what I've been looking for. Will order more colors. I ordered a size large and could of got a medium."
5.0,"For reference,I ordered a size medium,  I am 5ft 3 in and 155 pounds. I have never wore something like this so was hesitant to purchase but it fits like a glove. I have thick thighs and a booty but had no problem putting it on. It is stretchy and super comfortable. Pictures to come after Halloween.<br /><br />Edit: After a night of wearing it I would say the only downfall is that I had to keep pulling it up."
5.0,Perfect just like it came.
5.0,They are nice and you won’t get anything better for the price
5.0,"Came just like it said, great condition and the hubby loves it."
5.0,LOVE this nightgown!!  It is so soft and comfortable!!!  Washed really nicely for me but I did not put in the dryer as I didn't want to take a chance on shrinkage.  Think I'll get another one or two!!
5.0,Very nice style and looking amazing on my girl
5.0,Great quality and a good weight to it. Does not look or feel “cheap”. Very happy with purchase
5.0,Love the look and the color.
5.0,"It looks exactly like the picture on me. I'm a small but ordered a medium, and the loose fit looks perfect. Just what I was going for!"
5.0,Lovely in its simplicity.
5.0,Item arrived as described.
5.0,"I love these shirts and will purchase more, I am 5'8 168lbs. The medium fit perfectly, assuming you prefer a tighter fit, even though it is tighter, the shirt is breathable."
5.0,Very high quality product. I bought this for bachorlette party favors and was impressed with the quality of sewing and designs. I would buy these again.
5.0,Just got this purse and wallet today and even though the purse is a little smaller than I hoped it's still soo adorable! 😁
5.0,"Lems Shoes, formerly LEMing, (and, also formerly, Stem) is a small Pennsylvania-based company specializing in minimalist lifestyle shoes and name changes. As a shoe on the ""barefoot"" end of the minimalist spectrum, the Lems Primal Origin (PO) falls somewhere between a casual shoe and an active lifestyle shoe. The primary design objective of this shoe is to give the wearer all of the benefits of a being barefoot while maintaining a certain level of protection, comfort, and stealth in the normal human being world where, let's face it, toe shoes are an aesthetic aberration. Anyone who has been following the minimalist running scene for any length of time has heard the Goldy Locks-esque promise of the perfect hybrid of barefoot/shod experience. This shoe delivers.<br /><br />What it is and What it isn't<br /><br />Lems were my first step into the world of minimalist shoes (pun intended). I was looking for something in the vein of a lifestyle shoe, but I also wanted to learn how to run with barefoot form. Like many before me, I was introduced to minimalism by wondering aghast why people were wearing Vibram Five Fingers. After more than my fair share of internet research, I decided I wanted to try minimalism but I did not want to wear shoes that screamed  ""Ask me about my shoes!""<br /><br />Enter Lems. I purchased my first pair after reading some reviews that simply raved about the shoe. ""It's like being barefoot,"" they said. ""I forget I'm wearing shoes,"" they said. ""Insanely comfortable!"" Only two of those three descriptions are true. I know internet reviewers can sometimes be prone to hyperbole, but let me say confidently and unequivocally that you will never forget that are you wearing shoes in Lems. Why? Because wearing shoes, even extremely minimal ones, feels very different than being barefoot. This should not be taken as a negative criticism of the POs, just a criticism of hyperbole. I'll never, ever, be that hyperbolic.<br /><br />I can say, however, that the POs are my favorite pair shoes. It does not matter if I'm going to work to stand for 7 hours, to walk all day downtown, or trek through the great outdoors; I always find myself reaching for my Lems. As someone with wide feet, I have a particular appreciation for the shoe's anatomical last. Too often the inward curve of a running shoe's last causes me discomfort. I feel as if I'm spilling over the midfoot. Not in Lems. They're completely unrestrictive without feeling ""loose."" The 3mm sock liner is removable and allows the wearer to customize their fit. So there is no need to dismiss this shoe as an option even if your feet run on the narrow side. With or without the liner, with or without socks, this shoe will be comfortable all day.<br /><br />For the sake of clarity I think I should mention that the Lems PO is not a running shoe per se. It is an active lifestyle shoe that can be run in. I've logged 75 running miles on my current pair and 70 running miles on a pair before that. I returned my first pair because they were defective; more on that later.<br /><br />Wearing it<br /><br />Lems are super flexible and move with your feet<br />The PO feels like a secure slipper. I often have a hard time interpreting what some reviewers mean when they describe a shoe fitting like a slipper. Slippers are often loose, insecure, and designed only for low-intensity use. Lems feel like a slipper only insofar as the foot bed is soft and roomy. The traditional lacing system makes the shoe as secure as it needs to be, but not one bit more. In fact, Lem's website (still under the moniker ""Leming Footwear"") cautions against trying to lace up these shoes too tightly and thereby inhibiting their roomy fit. I find that the looped eyelets make the shoe difficult to tie extremely tightly.<br /><br />I mentioned that wearing these shoes is very different from being barefoot. Based on some reviews, you could get the impression that you can feel individual blades of grass. This is far from true. But I can definitely feel the differences between a grassy and a rocky surface.  I can feel inconsistencies in the road, indoor surfaces, and a whole host of other ground textures. For even better ground feel, take out the sock liner. The soles of your feet have got some exploring to do.<br /><br />I live in the southwest and can verify that my feet stayed well ventilated, even while on a midday, sockless run in June. After a wash, it only took a couple of hours by a fan for the shoes to dry, as per the website's claim. Be careful in wetter climates, though. The shoes are in no way water resistant. I spent a rainy weekend in October in Boston without a car. Walking the city was easy; keeping my feet dry was not. Despite all of the wet weather, though, I never slipped or lost traction.<br /><br />Props to Lems on their ""special air-infused rubber"" outsole. I expect very good things in the durability department. That being said, I did order a pair of POs in late June from a distributor (not Lems directly) that were defective. After approximately two months of use, my wife pointed out to me that the upper was separating from the outsole on the medial side. After a bit of research I found out that right about the time I ordered my shoes, Lems had tweaked their design to account for some quality inconsistencies like the one I experienced. I have not noticed any problems in the most recent batch of POs.<br /><br />The Best Parts<br /><br />The PO really shines for its versatility.  The Lems Primal Origin is a canvas asking you ""what do you want me to be?"" And you may answer however you like. The only unsolicited attention I have ever gotten because of these shoes was a compliment on how they looked, which was great since I didn't want monkey feet. And for me personally, the anatomical last makes the shoe a dream to wear.<br /><br />Who is it for?<br /><br />-Anyone looking to foray into the world of minimalist shoes and see what the hype is about<br /><br />-Experienced minimalist runners looking for the ""free training"" that comes with (nearly) barefoot sensations"
5.0,I bought 3 of these for my girlfriend she absolutely loves them... The only thing is the more they stretch the more sheer they become in the light... They fit as expected..
5.0,Just this past Valentine's Day. My wife wanted something so simple she didn't want an expensive gift. But I still went ahead and bought something that she might like in the inexpensive stuff. She loved it and if it's well and especially the necklace it's not cheap great material and it actually works using your cell phone flash to see it against the wall.
5.0,"I liked this product very much, I have no complaints and the quality of the bracelets are very durable. Both bracelets are made well and the studs are high quality."
5.0,Fit just as I hoped and is very comfortable.
5.0,"One of my favourite clothes I have recently got: super soft and looks stylish. I will love to buy more in other colours, if they have."
5.0,Luv... It's my everyday must have
5.0,"Currently working great. It’s thicker than usual, but ok. I’ll updated later with some more time with the watch band."
5.0,This set is so beautiful. I love the colors and it goes perfect to match her boho chic room! 🥰
5.0,"This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it, all I needed to know"
5.0,great seller and great product.  Just completed a very long flight to Hong Kong and these socks were comfortable and gave me the right mixture of support and comfort.
5.0,"Very nice like the fit, price was very reasonable crystal clear, blue light filters work great."
5.0,I love everything about it !!! How it fits and feels ❤️ super comfortable!
5.0,"Wen i first bought it was too tight , but , i being working out more and now is like perfect i even wear it to go out no just the gym<br />LOVE IT"
5.0,Very cute . I wear it while I get ready.<br />I rinse on a delicate cycle in a laundry bag so it doesn’t snag  and air dry.
5.0,Bigger then I wanted but still cute
5.0,This is so pretty and really adds bling to your outfit! The gold looked so pretty that I think I'll eventually order in silver. The picture submitted is from a screenshot of a video from the Taylor Swift concert I attended on my birthday.Edit: You have to tap the picture to bring up to see the necklace. Also the bracelet & ring are also really pretty.
5.0,"Very pleased with this dress.  The fit was great.  I'm 5'9"", 195lbs and wear a 14/16.  The XL was perfect.  Pockets are a bonus!"
5.0,love the bracelet. Product as described.
5.0,I would recommend this to my friends. Good quality for the money
5.0,"Placing this hat on my head was the single greatest moment of my life. The instant that glorious cotton crown of freedom snuggly embraced by balding, sun-spotted skull, magnificent branches of red white and blue lightning erupted from my eyeballs. It was exactly like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Except instead of the power of God, it was the power of Trump. And instead of killing the Nazis, it fried all the brown people. I will wear this hat until I die. And then I'll bring it with me to heaven so I can eliminate all the brown people in heaven too. Don't worry...god loves genocide. Read the old testament."
5.0,There are no better socks than darn tough socks.
5.0,The tank tops are nice they fit very well. Thank you
5.0,Seems like Under Armour is the only company making quality hoodies anymore.
5.0,"Wry pretty,"
5.0,Get lots of compliments.  No ring though. Just cute.
5.0,Very classy and comes just as seen in photos
5.0,"The book part itself is so cute! Plus, the clock actually works. It is actually also pretty solid, and the hinges of the book are nice and close by itself (so if you don't have to worry about closing it) One thing is that the necklace part is too short; however, you can easily put another string or necklace chain through the book so that it fits around your head.<br />This is a perfect present and I am very happy. I am definitely going to buy this again, or buy it again for myself."
5.0,Thank god I got 6 pairs because I now borderline live in these socks! These things are amazing warm and soft and thick!!
5.0,I am hippy so I bought the next size up and it fits great
5.0,"These are great for the price! Anti-fog works flawlessly. Nice adjustable strap with a quick release. The built-in ear plugs are a great feature. However, the nose plugs were way too tight."
5.0,Was just as described and worked great for my daughters 1st Birthday. Will definitely save this outfit for her to cherish forever.
5.0,"Wonderful timepiece for the price.  Beautiful skeleton design and bronze accents. The band isn't leather but doesn't really try to be, and so it looks classy.  Note:  the small second dial on the watch is non functional, it is purely for looks."
5.0,My grand daughter's loved them.!
5.0,"Stunning purse, great quality and price! I'm receiving so many compliments. Letting everyone know where I purchased it :)"
5.0,Used these stickers for a home made corn hole board and they worked great.
5.0,I love this necklace. The green is perfect and the stone itself is gorgeous. I bought 3 other necklace for 3 of my friends and they love theirs as well.
5.0,My sister was delighted to get t hi s for Christmas.  She is sooooo protective of it she won't let anyone else touch it.
5.0,Very please with the item.
5.0,I'm 5'4 190 lbs and ordered a largw. It fits just right but I think XL would have fit too. The fabric is very comfy and colors are true to the picture
5.0,grandson loves it
5.0,Amazing<br />I love it
5.0,Great! Nice and pretty! Stylish and cute! I'm happy with item! I liked it! Is simple and in style! Nice!
5.0,"Perfect!,<br />Looks the way it appears as in the picture."
5.0,This dress is absolutely perfect! I love everything from the material to the way it fits!
5.0,He likes this boxer briefs. Please make some with other dinos beside just a T-Rex.
5.0,"I ordered a large and extra large in this skirt.  My hips are 42"".  They both fit, but obviously the extra large had a pinch more room and so that is the best fit for me.  I'm 5' 0"" and the skirt still hits above my knee.  It has a button closure and a metal slide closure, as well as a zipper and then the tie in the front.  The material is a ""silky denim"". I am super happy with this skirt!"
5.0,Got it for my dad. Its exactly what youd think it is.
5.0,Very good quality for the price ....
5.0,These earrings look great!
5.0,"Oh my....I can’t say enough about this dress. We are going to the beach in a week and I ordered this to wear on the beach but it is so elegant looking that I believe it should be worn to dinner. I absolutely love it. I don’t wear dresses very often but now I’m thinking I should lol. Especially if they look like this. It’s very form flattering at the top. It shows off your legs just a little, and your collarbone as you can see which is very sexy. I love the way the straps are made to just hang off your shoulders/arms. It shows a lot of your upper back and it doesn’t slide at all. It’s thin but you can’t see through the outer material thanks to the slip underneath. The only thing I would change is the fact that the slip is a little transparent, I took a picture to show. But who’s really going to be looking at the slip. The only way you can see the slip is if you lift apart the dress. It is very very beautiful, I am just amazed!"
5.0,"Lightweight, breathable fabric. Purchased a size up for loose fit. Prompt delivery and really nice color."
5.0,"Thick & warm and super cute. Strings come off too easily, so order metal/elastic mitten holders."
5.0,Absolutely LOVE... LOVE LOVE this dress..
5.0,Love  the brown Katloo soft leather crossbody. I  have the black one as well. But the brown is the best!!! R.
5.0,Fast shipping and work as they are supposed to.
5.0,"Great, easy wear, no fuss glasses!"
5.0,If you have to use a mask these aren't usually permitted
5.0,Super cute necklace! Friend loved it.
5.0,"Stylish, warm hat. Love the soft furry fleece lining. Saw ones similar to this in a boutique for almost twice the price I paid here. Great buy!"
5.0,Pretty and warm
5.0,So far so good. Only wore it once so far because I just received it. Good quality great clasp
5.0,Love Love Love this necklace
5.0,These are so so cute and comfy will buy again.
5.0,These glasses are perfect! My husband has been wanting these for the summer and I finally bought them for his bday & he loves them!
5.0,"I bought these for my husband; he is thrilled with them. They fit perfectly, are warm and look great!"
5.0,My son loved this I bought it for him as a gift.
5.0,"I was worried this would be uncomfy in the bikini line area, because I've had panties that were too tight around there because my waist is a medium but my thighs are large. These however were super stretchy, the fabric was almost silky smooth, and they feel sturdy. I was also worried about the smell of blood getting out, but somehow it manages to trap the smell. About to buy another pair now 👍🏻"
5.0,Very cute. Like that it’s a thin band. Will probably buy more colors
5.0,This dress is so comfortable. I could not decide on a color so I got both the red and blue. Received compliments on both everywhere I went.
5.0,Extremely soft and comfortable to wear. It fits just as it should which is rare these days even with size charts. I believe this dress is extremely well made. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase!!
5.0,34 waist medium fit pretty good
5.0,"Ever see someone's first amazing glance at one of these?  Paperweight is the last thing they think it is.  Order one, any color, best to start with clear and see for your self.  100MM not 80MM go big.  There inexpensive enough.  They will last forever."
5.0,I received the jacket today and the material appears to be of good quality.  I had read some of the reviews and some suggested to order a size larger.  I wear a 2X so I ordered a 3X.  The shipping information indicated that I would be getting a 5X.  The jacket I received was labeled 5X but fit more like a 2X.  That could be that the jacket is really well filled and feels like it will be really warm this winter.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the jacket.
5.0,"Size was good, I got a small for a 6 year old , so plenty of room to grow into"
5.0,"Ordered a size bigger based upon reviews but actually needed yet another size up to feel comfortable and not so snug in the arms, super easy return and placed new order for bigger size. It's  a great look for the price,  and material better then expected."
5.0,It's beautiful.  Thank you.
5.0,Love them and very comfortable!
5.0,LOVE these sneakers. Very comfortable (and I have wide feet). They are true show stoppers and bring smiles to everyone in the crowd. Children come up to me in awe and ask how my sneakers light up. They are functional and so much FUN! Well worth the price!
5.0,Great for running in the sun in high humidity environments.
5.0,"This animal print is really cute.  It is a durable plastic/faux leather style, but comfortable.  The slide pin was very easy to install.  If you have a small wrist like I do, the end of the strap does come around to the other side of the wrist bone.  It would be nice to have it be a bit shorter, but I don't want to cut it and not have the nice finished edge.  It's acceptable."
5.0,Liked the quality. My daughter is in the High School Marching band and they needed an item that would help their section stand out. These were perfect for these kids.
5.0,"I cant take pictures becasue my girl wont out it down.  This was a gift from the Elf and worth every penny. Velvet blue lining, nice weight to it, great design, lots of details and that's just the box. The pendent is beautiful , full of detail, looks so real, I want one. For this price any LOTR fan should have it"
5.0,"Elegante, light weight, stunning piece"
5.0,Fits perfect on my little girl and its so adorable on her too! She loves it and doesnt want to take it off
5.0,Wife adores it! Be advised though... this is a pretty big necklace/stone
5.0,"Goes with anything, slimming."
5.0,"Stylish, perfect size, strong & has strong closure. I recommend. Price is right too!"
5.0,"I was wearing my Nike running gloves on the mountain. The wind was cutting right through them. I decided to switch as I know wool is superior in keeping you warm. I was not disappointed. These are my go to gloves now, for hiking, driving and everything in between."
5.0,Simply amazed by the way this shirt fit me. The bright colors were a hit at the resort and everyone loved it!
5.0,fits very well.
5.0,"This dress is awesome! You never know about fit or material when ordering but I was so pleasantly surprised by this dress. It is SO flattering. I’m a size 16 and carry my weight in my mid-section. I feel so cute and stylish in this.  The length is great, not too short and an actual dress not like a tunic. The material is lightweight enough that I could wear in the summer with flip flops. In the winter I put cute leggings underneath and wear with boots. I will absolutely buy this in more colors!!"
5.0,Love Love Love
5.0,"Super cute!  Totally looks like what’s in the picture. I love the pocket sides, i love that I can put my coffee cup and water bottle in the side pockets. Plenty of room inside the bag not too big not too small."
5.0,"A nice, comfortable, supportive sock.  Happy with my purchase."
5.0,This mask has a great picture. Fits perfect
5.0,Awesome lanyard looks good and good quality
5.0,Love it! The size is great for adults and for kids
5.0,My boyfriend got these for snowboarding and loves how they look and fit!
5.0,Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Will order another!
5.0,Got a lot of compliments and this dress is phenomenal! LOVED it!
5.0,I love this hat!
5.0,Loved the entire outfit! It fit my daughter perfectly and was easy to get stains out and clean the next day. The headband was adorable and well constructed.
5.0,"This is a great gift. The hoops are not too heavy, have silver posts and gold plating. They are a great size so they’re understated but still pretty. Highly recommended"
5.0,Best quality out there. These heel taps will outlast any other brand 3-5 times longer. I have put them on every pair of boots and shoes I have. Need to buy more. Super product!!!
5.0,"Great material, I was impressed. Love it!!!"
5.0,"Attractive, fit well, comfortable, not see through. Liked same dress in a different color so returned this one. No problem with returning to Amazon. Would recommend if you like this color/pattern."
5.0,"These looks exactly as on picture. I wanted a warm,comfy house shoes that have good feet support for my little one. He has high arch and is hard to find something that fits. Thanks to the velcro the instep is wide enough. It has quality material and sole and bottom of shoes are strong to support the little feet. They are warm and perfect for upcoming cold weather. I would recommend them."
5.0,Size was correct and fit great. Offered support and was very comfortable.
5.0,Gorgeous.  I would wear it everyday if I could.  LOL
5.0,This dress couldn’t be worn with a bra so it threw off the fit at the top. Use tape to keep the girls up and in place and it looked great. Had a couple snags on my bracket and watch but nothing to bad.
5.0,Me encanta las playeras negras esta se ha convertido en mi consentida
5.0,Great socks for chilly days
5.0,Excellent tool when sewing. Didn't care for the pressing end
5.0,Very pleased with it!
5.0,"I new at learning to use this cane,but its light easy to use and it made very well"
5.0,My niece loves Moana! Fits her as expected. Nice clothing and material! Arrived in time and the look on her face was<br />Priceless.
5.0,This necklace came with tools to make adding an easy task. I keep my loved one close. I’m not to trusting with getting it wet do I do remove before showering or swimming
5.0,"Perfect gift for the price, very impressed!"
5.0,"The shorts looked good just like in the advertised pictures. Unfortunately I had to return them as they were too small. The return process went without a hitch, which is always good. I would purchase thru this seller again, very happy with them."
5.0,Love these bought these for my husband and they look so good on him. They look expensive in person for the price and everyone wanted to know where he got them from
5.0,Made my packing so easy! I definitely recommend them. Shipping was quick!
5.0,I love this outfit... The fit is perfect ...Cant wait to show it off in Dominican Republic in a month... Will definitely order again in a different color...
5.0,My wife loves this new dress . Fits her perfectly.
5.0,I love this necklace! You could wear the chain with or without the pendant. It is really that pretty on its own. Very good quality especially for the price.
5.0,"I love the material, I love how it fits, I love how it’s open cut in the back so we can see our gainz ^.\"
5.0,"Perfect size for cell, lipstick and credit cards! Love how sparkly it is and looks great!"
5.0,"LOVE my Neleus Athletic Compression Under Base Layer Sport Tank Tops! They are like having a second skin. Very flexible while providing support without any restrictive tightness.<br /><br />I was a bit worried before purchasing because of the description used ""Under Base Layer"". They are perfectly fine to wear without an over shirt. I wear mine at the gym and on the street. They are a confidence booster for me!<br /><br />I will definitely buy more."
5.0,"My 9 year old son won’t wear a jacket or coat but when I found this he said he would wear it. It’s very good quality and very soft. It runs small, I got larger than I thought and it fits well, I’m afraid he’ll outgrow it soon. I wish it had been bigger."
5.0,My mother in law loved this necklace. Nice quality. Good bang for your buck.
5.0,This is a great pair of socks. They're very comfortable and  don't slip off of your feet like other brands.
5.0,"Bang for the buck, comfy, breatheable"
5.0,I saw this stiletto on one of the Shannon Fabric quilting videos and decided to try it. I'm using it for the first time today.  What a tool! Wish I'd had this when working on all of my previous projects.  You won't be disappointed by the control this tool provides when sewing. I heartily recommend it.
5.0,"I am happy with these socks, but they are a little tight around the top band and I have thin legs."
5.0,"I see some fitting issues in the reviews. If you can send back for new size. This is a great looking jacket. I was just searching all over my area stores. I even went to the crappy Mall. Nothing but ugly and assembly line looks. This is a very unique jacket and it is very comfortable. I am going to buy another color also, Dark Brown. I kinda did not want to give it a good review because now someone in my area will buy it and I will see him in the same place.. LOL"
5.0,Greatest watch I ever got..Will wear this one forever.
5.0,The earrings are very pretty
5.0,Green Band gets lots of compliments. I like the green/black face.
5.0,Very happy w/ purchase
5.0,"I like Hirsch bands a lot.  Supple, comfortable and still  dependable, I am trusting them with securing my Rolex Sub above and under water."
5.0,Usually wear an XL. Fits loose but comfortable for outdoors. Sleeves were slightly lighter in color than picture but still nice.
5.0,"I must disclose that I received a discount on my purchase of this headband.<br />The first thing I noticed about this headband is how soft it is. Very nice material.<br />I have been wearing it all day today while doing laundry and such. It holds very well, but not so tight as to give you a headache.<br />it will also be good for going out someplace nice. It is simple but will be good for play, work or an evening out. And the little gold emblem is a nice little touch.<br />And another plus for me is that it is wide enough to keep the cold winds out of my ears this winter. I live in the mountains and when I have to go outside, my ears get so cold that they hurt.<br />thank you for the opportunity to purchase and have this very nice headband."
5.0,Fit wonderful very comfortable and the material was soft and made well
5.0,exactly what i expected.
5.0,it's a very good choice for a daily use. My son is very happy.
5.0,"For the price, I can’t possibly complain. It’s actually a very pretty dress that doesn’t appear cheap. I purchased another formal dress from Amazon and the material was EXTREMELY flimsy, not the case with this dress. The tummy area is fine. The chest area can be a problem, as it will probably slip. I purchased double sided tape, as some recommended. I ended up not going to the formal affair, but decided to keep the dress ‘cause it’s such a steal. I recommend."
5.0,This is pretty but though the tag was wrapped in plastic it was scratched . It’s also small it barely fits my tiny wrist
5.0,I love it! It’s comfortable and it was the good size.
5.0,Very beautiful. The picture is small but with the color it's so vibrant and noticeable. Love them. And they are a great size for my ears.
5.0,Good quality & great price
5.0,"soft, comfortable and well made..."
5.0,"I love these panties. I am pregnant and have noticed that the seams on the sides of panties really bother my hips. These have given me zero trouble and are so comfortable. Fits as expected, colors did not bleed in the wash and did not shrink in the dryer. Would purchase again"
5.0,"I was a little concerned grabbing these in the winter time, but so far, they've been really fine. I probably wouldn't look to wear them in freezing weather, but I've been out a few times running errands this morning and they've been really decent in 41F weather. The material is thin, but because it's not terribly breathable, they trap your body heat pretty efficiently. My preferred belt type is a tech web belt and it fits perfectly through the loops on these pants - perfect for hiking. The legs cinch with a drawstring around the ankles - and my ankles are a little smaller for a big guy, so the draw string does tend to drag when I walk without shoes. I'm 6', 215, and the Large size fits me perfectly and comfortably - and it looks good too."
5.0,"I absolutely love these glasses. Not only are they super inexpensive but they are really stylish. The design is cool because you can easily fold them up and tuck them away and they are constructed really well so I haven't had any issues as far as them bending or getting scratched. They come with a nifty pouch that is sturdy on the outside with a plush inside and a Velcro closure. Great for just folding and sliding into your purse, pocket, glove compartment or any other place you can safely put them. They do not take up much space at all which is a major plus for me because I always carry a lot of stuff with me.<br />I really like dark lenses so these are perfect for me but if that's not your thing don't worry, they aren't so dark that you can barely see through them.<br />The glasses themselves are made of a hard plastic and the hinges are well constructed so they don't squeak or get stuck when you fold and unfold them.<br />I give these a five star rating based on the cost, style, size, functionality and construction.<br />I think these would be a nice gift for yourself or someone else.<br /><br />**I received this product in exchange for my 100% honest and unbiased review**"

5.0,Is a beautiful dress

5.0,Awesome buy
5.0,"I hope you get rich , you deserve to"

The discount that I received did not alter my opinion in any way."
5.0,"These are very comfy and fit well (I wear a size 10 and got a L). I thought they were just black and white, but there’s some pink and a burgundy or brown color in them, too, so you probably wouldn’t want to wear them with anything that doesn’t match pink.<br /><br />I get a lot of compliments on them."
5.0,Perfect  for what was needed
5.0,"Will not fit an adult face , it's just for kids."
5.0,The order was as described quick shipping
5.0,Wonderful! My husband loves it
5.0,It fit well it’s good quality something I can wear every Halloween now
5.0,"This mask fits snugly at the sides, top, and chin. It has a frame that holds it away from the mouth and nose. A singer needs to take quick deep breaths. Ordinary masks get sucked into the mouth when a singer breathes. This one does not."
5.0,"This shirt is beautiful & so comfy.  The ad says it runs big and it definitely does, but since that's what others had posted I bought 1 size smaller than I normally wear and it fits perfect!  I absolutely love this shirt!"
5.0,To heavy to wear but it looks nice on my truck mirror.
5.0,super cute socks! better in person than the picture.
5.0,Turned out just beautiful for the money.  Fit perfect and she looks amazing it in.  The outfit shows wonderful on the ice.  Use the size chart because she’s tiny and I ordered a large based on chart measurements.
5.0,Very light weight comfy and airy. Easy to wear and feels great. Customer service was excellent. They were very quick in contacting me and confirming that I got the right size. Highly recommended.
5.0,Liked it so much I bought a second one for my daughter because first one broke right away.  Maybe this one will work out better.
5.0,Great color & love the style. It is very well made.
5.0,"These earrings are great as gifts. They’re not too big nor too small, don’t irritate my sensitive ears. I love them and receive compliments when I wear them!"
5.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to a concert and elegant dinner, and it certainly fits the bill. It fit to a T, and now I am even more excited to get away! I have an idea I will find a reason to wear it again. One would think it would be unbearable with all of the sequins, but the lining makes it work. I really love it!"
5.0,Order came fast and as described.
5.0,right size good quality
5.0,"Nice item, true to size.  Wife loved it."
5.0,Very comfortable to wear. Material is very soft.
5.0,Literally fits like a glove but I recommend it for people with hands on the more petite side. Like baby hands basically.
5.0,I gave this to my daughter as a present and she adored it! Tries to wear it all the time. Great for a present or yourself.
5.0,A-1 produckt. very very satisfied. thank u
5.0,"Believe the reviews on this one! This costume is a huge step up from typical Halloween fare. High quality fabric, adorable details. The pics don't quite do it justice because it lays less wrinkly with movement. The bustle is brilliant and really makes the skirt pop, accurate to Princess Peach. The crown is a bit less quality and has bobby pins attached. We attached it to a headband, which is much easier and recommended. Fantastic costume and we will buy from this company again."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!!
5.0,"I really like this emerald tank dress. I wear it to work with leggings. I ordered medium and I am 5'9&#34; about 160 lbs. I probably could have gotten away with a large as well but medium looks good too. I have washed it and hung dry and it did not shrink. Fabric is soft and stretchy. Cute, good value and true to size. Recommend! (I paid full price and would do so again.)"
5.0,"Good quality. The length is just right for me, exactly what I want. Fits perfectly, very comfortable, and delivered quickly. Would love to buy it again"
5.0,This was a well received e gift
5.0,"I love this dress!! The colors are awesome, but it does run a little big. I'm 5'3 and 5 months pregnant and the small fit perfectly!"
5.0,"Nice piece for holiday charm collectors.  Nice when paired with other Christmas items.  Candy cane, wreath snowflake.  Nice for a gift."
5.0,I love these!!
5.0,My wife loves this ring it's great.
5.0,Comfortable and color was just what I expected.
5.0,Very pretty bathing suit.
5.0,"I love these tops. I have used one as a bathing suit top while in Kauai. It held up very well. Extremely comfortable. Supportive and very versatile. If you truly dislike wearing a bra but want to look as if you are, with ease of movement, I highly recommend these tops! I just wish they made them in different colors and styles aka long sleeved or a cap sleeve."
5.0,"High quality, fits as expected, fabric has a bit of stretch could be worn to office, or could be casual. Would buy again, and again."
5.0,Bought this for my 18 year old daughter for a early valentine's gift she loves it. Just what she wanted. It is super cute.
5.0,"Was looking for suspenders with the adjustments had lock, not slip through.  these are what I was looking for, looking suspenders"
5.0,"Very cool costume, we like the color which is more unique."
5.0,"We purchased these glasses a month ago for my 6 year old. They come in a case and have an elastic band so they stay put. They are a great pair, comparable to dilli dalli or miraflex but a fraction of the price."
5.0,"Love it,,, fits great and is of good quality"
5.0,This watch was such a bargain but looks really expensive. I bought it for my 10 year old daughter and it looks like it might have cost well over $50. The light is what makes this her favorite watch. It looks way better In person and the colors are so vibrant
5.0,My son loves them. They’re really nice and fit well.
5.0,"This sweat shirt is a great deal and provides warmth and durability for me here in the San Juan Islands of Washington State.  I have an older one perhaps a year old that has held up very well: great color, no zipper issues, and no signs of wear even though I wear and wash it often.  Highly recommend as very comfortable to wear."
5.0,Easy and fast!)
5.0,I WILL BUY AGAIN
5.0,It's a cap!
5.0,"the dress was perfect in every way. size, length."
5.0,I love PACT camisoles.
5.0,My dad loves his belt. Fast shipping and item as described. Thank you!!!
5.0,"I bought this before St. Patrick's Day but will wear all year long.  It's was a little difficult to get on by myself at first, but now I got it.  I have two other silver tone bangles so I can wear then all together.  I have a VERY small wrist and ordered a petite at first.  But it was too small so returned for a regular size and works well.  The oval shape helps keep the stones from turning upside down."
5.0,"This is my second Sunday Afternoon visor. It keeps the sun out of my eyes and feels nice and cool on a hot summer day. Great for gardening, exercising in the pool or taking a walk. The folding brim is especially handy because it fits in my purse or pocket. Washes up easily with dishwashing liquid and water."
5.0,"Very different, very pretty"
5.0,The material was decently thick and it arrived on time!
5.0,"Great work, the fine detail is noticeable, it was priced right for what you get not a high dollar work but worth it never the less."
5.0,"Great value. True to color 👌, I love it."
5.0,The purse is very  conventional for when you want to just carr cards and phone... that is without the phone  case. I love the purse. Best money ever  spent
5.0,"Great. Seems better quality than rothco or other similar brands I tried when I first started using these about 6 years ago. I love the color. The gray and gold is actually a beautiful steel blue and tan. I love it. The tassles also make it a little fancy. It's larger than most I own, so that's a bonus as well.<br /><br />Currently I am using this one for prayer covering, but it can easily be used as a &#34;chair,&#34; as a small blanket...and the length especially makes it useful for shade and face covering."
5.0,Comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Nice fit, cleans easily"
5.0,Perfect for my kid that tends to lose and misplace his sunglasses. Durable but cheap enough you can replace them again
5.0,"This is something that is difficult to order without handling it in person, but I rolled the dice and am happy with it so far. I'm curious to see how it breaks in. It's a little stiff for now."
5.0,The reviews are correct.  Very good quality.  Stretchy so extremely comfortable on.
5.0,This accessory truly adds to any simple outfit.
5.0,granddaugter loves it.
5.0,"I am really happy with these pairs, they are very comfortable and don't leave the foot sweaty. I'll get some more pairs soon"
5.0,I bought 3 of these cotton mock turtlenecks in different colors. They are lightweight and perfect for layering or just by themselves.<br />The most important part for me is that they are cotton and comfortable. They do run large. I normally wear medium but ordered in small size.
5.0,AAA++++
5.0,"These glasses are light weight, comfortable, and look great! You can’t see the bifocal from the front of the glasses, but you can see the line from the back. I don’t recommend using them for driving if you aren’t used to it. Typically I just move my eyes to look at my tachometer etc., but the bifocal made that difficult, as I’d have to move my head down to clearly see it. But they are awesome for reading on the beach, golf, and other recreational activities."
5.0,I got this for my sister for her birthday. She absolutely loves it! Great buy!!!
5.0,"[...]<br />These shoes are super cute. The heel is just the right height where it's not challenging to walk in them. The color is really nice the mesh allows your feet to breath while still having the ankle boot look, so it's great for the transition from summer to fall. I walked all around New York City and my feet didn't hurt. The size was accurate. I usually wear a seven and that's what I got. Overall, I recommend.<br />[...]"
5.0,"Pretty impressed with these. I had low expectations. Had lasik about 8 years ago. My eyes have started to go bad again and I can’t repeat the surgery due to a thin lens. So I must wear glasses.  I purchased a $400 pair of progressive, photosensitive glasses. Felt like I needed a backup. I’m amazed at the price of these. The photo sensitivity seems ok. I don’t think folks realize that with Transitions lenses, you can’t tell they’ve darkened either.  It is subtle.  And the prescription doesn’t exactly match mine, as both eyes are different.  But that’s ok, it works good enough for the “amazing” price."
5.0,It’s super cute!
5.0,My granddaughter loves this! She wears anywhere from a 4T to a 5t and it fits perfectly
5.0,Perfect gift for wife! So sexy!
5.0,This is very cute and true to size but I suggest ordering up if you have a larger baby as it just fit.  I got the 6-12 month for my 1 year old who is 19lbs and it got her perfect.
5.0,Great fit! Text gloves that actually work on phone!
5.0,I love the way it looks and feels
5.0,Made mother very happy.
5.0,Looks good...niece loved it
5.0,"To use with a classroom of Kindergarten students for music and movement. The kids love the way the silks flow when they wave them to music. This was a replacement for our red silk that was ""overloved."""
5.0,"I was hesitant to buy this shirt, since buying clothes online from a manufacturer whose sizing I'm not sure of can be a gamble at best, but this shirt is amazing. Ok, there's a small rhinestone on the front for some mystery reason, but it picked off with no issues. The shirt fits perfectly (I got the XXL, and usually wear between a 16-18) and is snug but not tight at the waist, long enough that it can be ruched up to camoflauge any bumps. It's not sheer, but the material is a bit thin, so I imagine that the lighter colors may be a bit see-through. It's definiitely one of my favorites, and is in regular rotation. I want it in all the colors!"
5.0,Lights up cutting chair!  Adds cheerfulness to stylist and client! Thanks and I luv it!
5.0,Exactly what I ordered. All the patches and the jersey look great. I was pleasantly surprised it even has the fight strap.
5.0,"Cute, casual and comfortable"
5.0,Love these rings but they do tend to stretch out very easy. Would buy again though.
5.0,It’s great to have many options to chose from
5.0,"What a cute, simple, trendy necklace by Wild Flower. I love the simplicity of the chain, to me it is the perfect size, & the best thing about the chain is it is adjustable to your needs. So far wearing it, I must say this is a nicely covered gold plated chain. I haven't had any discomfort, tarnish, or the ugly greenish color on my skin like other low quality jewelry give. So that should tell you a lot about the quality of this necklace. Now, the charm is cute, super trendy right now, has a nice shine to it, & with that it can easily get fingerprint smudges on it but of course can be cleaned with a microfiber cloth. The embossed of the letter is done nicely, & clean. Eventually I would like to get all of my kids initials to add to this chain, I think that would be perfect. This initial necklace would make a perfect gift to anyone young or old, & I definitely recommend anyone to purchase. I received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review."
5.0,"I bought this baseball bracelet for my grandson’s 9th birthday, he absolutely loved it.  It is so durable, thick, sure to stand the test of time.  I was very surprised with the quality for the great price!"
5.0,"this fit so well and it was beautiful, i loved it and it looked amazing."
5.0,"This is much better made than I had expected.  there is cording around the entire neckline and it hangs perfectly.  the print is not too much with the darker placement print in the middle it give the print sophistication.<br />I may buy another if I can find another upscale print.  These are of course see through but not completely like some fabric, I plan to wear a black spaghetti strap tank under it."
5.0,Very nice and a great price.
5.0,"Super cute, headband keeps slipping off my daughter's head but that was expected. Its a little thin so it would be good for spring or fall but I wouldn't recommend it for winter."
5.0,Perfect for church
5.0,beautiful i love ittt!
5.0,My third pair of these stunningly beautiful sunglasses! Got my friend and sister a pair!
5.0,This is a fabulous hat. The quality is good and it is well made. I can say it works great in the hot Texas sun! Tilley stands behind their products.
5.0,It is really good watch!!! One of the best watches<br />I really recommend it.<br />Fast shipment was really fast!<br />No problems!
5.0,"These are very sturdy and have survived a New England winter.  They are not see through at all!! I am a little short waisted and these leggings do come up a little higher than I wanted,"
5.0,"Very nice piece. Material is comfortable and has stretch. I'm a size 14 bottom and large top so the 12/14 large size fit me perfectly. I will be wearing within the next week and will post pics when I do. To be more precise if you're normally a size 12 it'll fit good,normally a size 14 it will fit fitted but comfortable. So I could imagine the other two sizes are the same . Hope I could help."
5.0,beautiful!!!
5.0,quality product
5.0,Christmas gift...looks like fit will work
5.0,"A little Big for my one year old, though I went by the size chart, but still works fine. He walks around in these shoes like a boss. We love them. :)"
5.0,I purchased and wore the black with white polkadots to a funeral and received so many favorable comments on the look and fit of my dress. I ordered a 3x and it fit me perfectly.<br />Normally I would have ordered an XL. Glad I ordered the bigger size. The fit made me look much slimmer than the dress size. Loved this dress! I plan to buy more colors.
5.0,"Approximately 7&#34; x 2&#34;(Headband) 3&#34; x 3&#34;(Wristband), Material: Cotton, Spandex and Nylon.But they all have good elasticity which make them fit most men and women's heads and wrists. These headbands are 2 inches wide,however, I found that I can fold them over to create the right width. I wear one everyday for workouts and they keep sweat out of my eyes effectively. The other sweatbands that I have used in the past stretch and lose their elasticity and their color after several laundry cycles. These don't. Great for my big-headed ladies! TRUST ME!"
5.0,These are so soft and fit perfectly. Just the right amount of warmth.  I really like them and ordered another pair.
5.0,This band is soft and stretchy! So comfy to wear.
5.0,I am going to use these aprons and chef's hats for a book tasting party at school.  They are very colorful and bright.  The hats are a little thin but will work beautifully.
5.0,I really like this mask. It’s comfortable and soft. Good quality.
5.0,Gets attention.
5.0,These are so cute and I love the collapsible end.
5.0,"Came in time, 10 year old needed formal for sweet 16 gala, and it was spot on. The color made the item look rich, without the rich price tag. Paired with a silver glitter shoe and finished with sparkly accessories. Perfect."
5.0,"beautiful leather and color, easy catch for adding keys"
5.0,"These are my 2nd pair. I love these pants. This would probably be around a 32-34"" waist"
5.0,Received the correct design. Super cute!
5.0,My husband love's them
5.0,This necklace is great! It liter ally goes with everything- and dresses it up beautifully!

5.0,This was my dads Christmas gift and he was so excited over this shirt. Best gift of the year!
5.0,"This is a great blouse, but runs very small.<br />The seller really helped me out with this order to resolve my request."
5.0,Looks exactly like picture.  Great quality for the price . Timely Shipping. Would recommend the purchase.
5.0,Most comfortable belt I own.  Infinite adjustment so there is no close enough feeling.
5.0,The dress fit as expected. I like the look.
5.0,I get compliments on this mask everywhere I go! Makes people laugh and helps keep the pandemic era fun when we go out.
5.0,Soft comfortable and flattering!
5.0,"The straps are a bit small but overall it fits great, the mesh is really solid and the roses are firmly attached. The band is comfortable and doesn't dig in. It fits as I want as long as I keep it on the longest strap settings, so it might be a little small for some people if you're on the larger end of your usual size."
5.0,100% wool!!
5.0,Works well.  Hardly noticeable when exercising.
5.0,"Loved it. Charm nice and thick very durable, color very vibrant. Chain was better quality and design than expected. Had lots of nice comments about necklace."
5.0,I love this replica
5.0,Got these for my mother.  She looks good in them!  The quality was outstanding.
5.0,Great thanks!
5.0,I wanted some small black earrings to wear when I wore all black and these fit the bill!  I can't wear sterling silver so I was so glad these were stainless steel.  They are comfortable and I did get someone else to order a pair.  Stainless steel has come a long way and with gold so high these are a great buy!
5.0,Great quality clothing.
5.0,"This is a lightweight denim skirt that is perfect for warm weather. The material is soft to the touch, and irons easily. The snap-ons are also lightweight, and do not add bulk to the skirt. For a petite lady at 5'0, the skirt requires me to wear heels. However, I do love the romantic look that you could get from such length. I ordered a size small, and the waist was a bit big on me, about 2 inches, but that is only because I have waist of 24-25 inches. It's nothing a belt couldn't fix!<br />This has become a favorite as it's comfortable and flowy!"
5.0,"These fit me perfectly, and still look great after months of use!"
5.0,Really soft bought several colors
5.0,"I love these pants. I wear them all the time because they are comfortable and great looking. I used to wear my jeans a lot, but now I find myself wearing these instead."
5.0,The key to packing cubes is the zipper.  These worked very well for many days in Africa.  Kept my clothes neat and organized.  Will use them on all future trips.
5.0,"Beautiful dress and the material is nice. I'm 5'7 and 135 lbs. I usually wear a small and while the small fits, I think a medium will be more comfortable so I'm exchanging for the medium. Can't wait to get the right size and wear the dress out!"
5.0,"Love the earrings, color stands out , cute on my ears ,designed well , nice to wear for parties , casual and during vacation get aways"
5.0,I am very happy with this dress. True to size and flattering to the body.
5.0,"Easy on, multi color so matches lots of things, cute!"
5.0,"Watch bands were as described, arrived fast, no complaints!"
5.0,Love them. Works and fits great
5.0,These were a perfect fit for my five year old and his crazy socks day at school! They quickly became his most worn pair of socks and he wants to get more! I was worried they wouldn’t fit but the size was spot on!
5.0,This is such a well made and pretty charm. My Honey loves it.<br />I believe that Ninagueen makes the best on the market.
5.0,Love the fabric. Not too heavy but not too thin .
5.0,These are exactly like a pair I totally wore out...and that is a good thing!
5.0,Fit great for what I needed it for.
5.0,very clear nicely made
5.0,"comfortable wear, good buy!"
5.0,"Beautiful watch, looks like an old timepiece and it's not too bulky."
5.0,"These leggings are awesome! I work out daily, and had to get more. They are great compression, think and cool, and they hide the panty line better than my very expensive pants…. I need more colors."
5.0,VERY happy with how beautiful the earrings were and they also arrived very quickly. Thank you! &lt;3
5.0,Nice soft luxurious cozy lined pants. Super impressed! Will definitely buy again

5.0,Very pretty material. Love it for my purse
5.0,"These are great tunnels! They stay in my ear (which can be pretty challenging for me, especially because I move a lot at night). They're super light weight, and match with everything."
5.0,"It's the perfect size wallet, can fir in just about any purse.  And, for being so small, it sure holds a lot!!"
5.0,So Cute!!!!
5.0,These are adorable.  I ordered a size up to allow room to grow but the size for the tiny Toms are accurate.  The print is bright and you can actually make it work with most any outfit.
5.0,"Nice product, exactly as displayed. Fits on bracelet perfectly."
5.0,My daughter loves this necklace!
5.0,Love the look and feel
5.0,Love it...its perfect!!🙂
5.0,Best socks I’ve ever owned. My feet now love to hike.
5.0,"I love the look. There were a couple imperfections, but I didn't want to send them back because I still really liked them and they look great. My only issue, not a seller issue, is that they were not a big enough diameter for my conches, so I had to put them in my lobes and now it's either keep the earrings I love or not gauge down further. I got the 8g."
5.0,"This shelf is so cute. It's very sturdy. I'm really impressed, especially with how cheap it was."
5.0,"This dress was perfect for a wedding! I revived countless compliments, which surprised me because it’s just a dress from amazon! I ordered this because I needed something that would cover my stomach so I didn’t feel self conscious and it did just that! LOVED wearing this dress!"
5.0,"Very pleased with this suit, but it does run small. I'm 5'1, 121lbs and I ordered a large. It covered all the places I needed it to. Being a mom 4, it's hard to find suits I'm comfortable in. I really liked this one."
5.0,Love so cute
5.0,"Big enough for bills, my ID and a few credit cards. Perfect for me."
5.0,Like a great deal even though buckle is heavier than I expected
5.0,It could have been tighter but I still love it....I'm a 30a cup so for those who are blessed with breast it would definitely fit perfectly
5.0,"I got so many compliments on this dress! No one could believe I got it on Amazon.<br />Looks expensive, feels luxurious and the fit is perfect."

5.0,Awesome dress.  Fit perfect.
5.0,"Refresh your legs and feet, Support your ankle and shin, Stay active longer, Recover quicker, Reduce painful vibrations. These socks are the bomb diggity! Keep your calves warm and protected.  These compression socks are brilliant for those constantly exercising or those who simply work outside in cold weather for long periods of time. You won't be disappointed.  These are the best compression socks I've ever owned.  They do keep your feet dry by not absorbing moisture, reducing blister causing friction.  Friction and rubbing were definitely a concern, I've not experienced that."
5.0,nices  masks
5.0,"I really like this dress, so much I purchased for<br />a bday gift for my sister"
5.0,Good hoodie for Bama weather & very cool graphic
5.0,Well worth the money. I adore this dress. I have a purse to match it.
5.0,Nice bracelet but hard to read lettering.
5.0,Confortable and nice
5.0,"This gown is so soft and comfortable, with a touch of femininity."
5.0,"I absolutely love these shoes. They are true to size, comfortable and easy to walk in. I have them in cream, bronze and black. Every time I wear them I get compliments. Very inexpensive and great value fir the money."
5.0,My child loves flamingo’s and I needed a two piece that covered the belly at school but still easy to go to the bathroom in a hurry. This was it. Fit as expected.
5.0,Like the pockets and very cute top.  Material is lightweight and not really something to wear in winter.
5.0,"Great fit, quality material.  Love the sleeves fitted at the wrist and the fixed tie.  Went very well through the washer and dryer.  I love it!"
5.0,"Very cute, seem to be made well. Its winter here now so my daughter won't be wearing these until spring."
5.0,Great fit and comfort
5.0,Biem chinchón
5.0,A stylish summer hat with attractive stylised flowesr on the side with pearl  stamens which is very pretty. It is a good white straw  and is not heavy to wear. I recommend this hat  as it is attractive.
5.0,"Love this Pajama set! Gives you comfort without looking frumpy and has adorable sheer accents on the neckline & ankles. Definitely is great year round! Since warm weather is here I still wear the pants, but I wear a cami instead. Definitely need more colors!👍🏼"

5.0,The necklace arrived one day early. It was a gift for my daughter in law's birthday.  She said it was very pretty and seemed really pleased with it.
5.0,Beautiful addition to the new baby's hokie gear!
5.0,I’m 6’ tall and weight about 175. I have a 32” waist and these perfect. Feel good on my butt and won’t cause chaffing like the pure spandex ones. These are more silky than other pairs I own and those would chew your butt up when working on hot days.
5.0,she loved how comfortable it was and of course the color pink
5.0,Most importantly these do not feel like a diaper The padding thickness is just right in placement too. I spin most days and have expensive padded shorts. These are the first I have found at a more reasonable price that compete with the big names. I have sent some back because they were too thick and bulky. I washed these in the machne and hung them to dry and they are perfect.
5.0,Pretty nice! I bought it as a gift and I really liked the colors and looks.
5.0,This dress was AWESOME!❤❤❤❤
5.0,I purchased this pendant for my 17 year old son and he is very happy with this gift. It's the perfect size and length. He has gotten various compliments on it and he never takes it off!! This pendant is a true winner!!!

5.0,"Would buy again, sleek and light weight. The lenses are very dark making them ideal for the beach and other outdoor actives."
5.0,I really like this clear case for iPhone SE rose gold. This case fit perfect unlike a couple of other cases I ordered and then had to return.
5.0,VERY NICE SLIPPERS. GOING TO BUY MORE AS GIFTS.
5.0,"The fabric, fit and feel is very nice. I love that it’s also dry fit. It would be awesome to have them in other colours. Good brand"
5.0,Awesome purse.  Very sturdy but soft enough to bend.  Very nice quality!
5.0,You will receive 3 light and dainty necklaces. They were perfect for the small charms I brought back from vacation. Slid on easily and clips seem strong.  Very happy.

5.0,"Nice quality , will buy again"
5.0,Paz jewelry is my favorite go to brand. The craftsmanship and details are always perfect. These earrings are beautiful and just the right weight. Not too light but not to heavy and the lapses is perfectly matched in each earring.
5.0,The power on this thing is great. Sucks your belly right in and gives you a smooth flattering shape.<br />I would not size up or down. Order according to your current size to avoid looking like a tight sausage or to avoid it not fitting at all.
5.0,"So nice and good price, I love this so much."
5.0,Very pretty and sparkly
5.0,loved the bag not too big or too small i would use it to hang out . just as it is in the picture

5.0,Dress was beautiful.
5.0,"So very flattering, makes me look a lot slimmer. Although i am a classic pear shape this dress makes a model out of me."
5.0,"I wanted some loose, comfy, inexpensive shorts for the summer. These are perfect."
5.0,"I love the quality of this. I have given one to my Mother, with the beads on it, and she just loves it. Wears it all the time"
5.0,Great shirt. Vibrant print the was even and level on front.  Did not have screen printing or any other chemical odor when opened. Love it.
5.0,"Wearing it right now, it's very cute."
5.0,"Nurses!! These run very true to size. I’m use to wearing xs surgical scrubs that are gigantic but I’m glad I didn’t order these in xs. I got smalls. When I compared these to my navy blue figs scrub top, there is a slight difference. These are just a touch darker. But if you can wear a t shirt on some days, I don’t think anyone will notice. Very comfy and high waisted!"
5.0,I’m 5’2 and 130lbs and this dress fit about as perfectly as any dress I buy. It hit me just below the knee and the chest was a little on the loose side but I’m short and small chested so I expected that.
5.0,I received the bracelet on time and I love it.
5.0,"This is a SUPER comfy hoodie! It's on the thinner side (perfect for fall) but still warm enough. The strings are a bit long but other than that, I love this hoodie!"
5.0,Love them!!!!!

5.0,works fine and as expected
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend that just bought a new RV. Super cute apron, fits well. Good quality."
5.0,I love this! Gave it to my dad for Father's Day!
5.0,"Perfect!  It's pretty, it's comfortable, and the length is just right! And when I say comfortable, I mean, you don't even remember that you have it on.  I had a Coach lanyard and not only was the leather uncomfortable as all get out, the badge-holding part was heavy; so it was cumbersome and annoying.  I'll probably have to get at least one more of these - I wonder if they come in holiday prints - because that would be super fun!"
5.0,"Gift for wife, she loved it"
5.0,My daughter loves these boots!
5.0,"Perfect for all work in the shop- woodworking, surfboard shaping and repairs, painting. Highly recommended"
5.0,"I had a bit of doubts in getting Wine Red size L- since I dont wear anything outside of black color and size 2XL-4XL, but this one surprisingly fits and feels amazing. My measurements is 5'3 tall, 170-180lbs, 44inch bust, 37 inch waist, 44 inch hips.<br /><br />The fabric is kind of thick-ish, I think its polyester from the outside, soft fleece-like inside. Very stretchy! Has not rode up on me so far!"
5.0,super comfortable and breathable...great color choices/patterns and price point was great...very satisfied
5.0,My Grandson loved this shirt! Colors are bright and it appears well made.
5.0,I am 65 and i have lots of admirers when i wear these
5.0,Good quality happy with the purchase
5.0,Love these hats.
5.0,"This dress is just the cutest!! I had to order a second on because the first was way to big on me but I’m sure I’ll find a way to make it useful. I ordered down to a large and even though it is still a tad big, I perfectly fine with it! It’ll give room for the extra Christmas munchies! The material is extremely comfy...kinda like a pair of pj’s (maybe that’s what I’ll use the bigger one for!) The stitching is nice a solid. I don’t see any rips getting through this! Overall I can’t wait to wear it to my families Christmas. Thanks for a nice dress!!"
5.0,Gorgeous and so comfy! I love this jacket. Worth the $.
5.0,Perfect black flat!!!
5.0,I think it does the job and is beautiful despite it being a fake :)
5.0,"This was an excellent purchase. The packaging is blase but once all opened, you can see the variety of designs and feel their durability. For the price, it's tops. Gave as a Christmas gift for a teenager, and she was elated! Presentation is everything: I covered a partial wrapping paper roll with red tissue paper then taped each bracelet to it, allowing them to hang from the roll. I then rolled the whole thing in a piece of tissue paper then wrapping paper, adding bows at each end, like a long thin Tootsie roll. She was so surprised & pleased! Gift was great."
5.0,Item is as I expected color and the fit is very flattering I like this so I purchased another skirt from this seller
5.0,"Got these for my 9 year old daughter, who is always losing the backs of her earrings. And we love them great price for so many well made earrings.. They are smaller then I thought which was good considering this was bought for a kid."
5.0,"Bought two of these. First one - a Large which I found was ultimately too big for me (size 34). The elastic nature of the pants allows for plenty of movement. Love all the pockets. Second one I bought a size down and it fits me better (less loose). Otherwise, really like these - great quality!"
5.0,"I don't normally order many dresses from Amazon, but I gave this dress a chance and I'm glad I did. It fits perfect, not too tight, and is very comfortable. The tie straps at the top allow you to adjust it however you want for your bust. I love how you can even wear a regular bra with it. I'm 5'3"", 123 pounds, C cup and got a small."
5.0,Smart idea
5.0,This necklace adds a cool accent to your look. The carnelian beads and pendant seem genuine and I like their look.
5.0,This was great for my witch outfit .. love the top part with the buckled straps and the strings in the back great for a tighter fit.
5.0,Very pretty! Lots of compliments!!!
5.0,"Very cute shoes, they are a bit wide but it’s Okay feet will keep growing. Bow came off on one shoe but I put hot glue on it and got easily fix. Many compliments received."
5.0,"Very cute, great price. I bought one for each of my daughters, and they loved them."
5.0,They are delicate and pretty and the chain really looks nice.
5.0,Really cute and great price!
5.0,Like the glasses a lot.
5.0,"Was suprisedby the quality of the this key chain. Bought for my wife and she loves it, almost matches her car color."
5.0,Absouletly gorgeous I love mine 😍
5.0,Thank you for the great service and product.
5.0,This is very nice. It isn’t easy to open but worth the struggle and not likely to accidentally open and lose your Fitbit. I got this because I wanted something that I could wear while grocery shopping since my Fitbit doesn’t really count my steps while I’m pushin a cart. I’ve gotten lots of compliments and everyone is surprised it is a Fitbit. The chain is dainty and I have a kink in mine I can’t seem to get out but I still live it. It comes with a little plastic thing that looks like a small guitar pick. I figured out (finally) that it helps you get the thing open.
5.0,It is seriously lightweight. I thought by looking at the photo it would weight down my belt when I clipped it but it wasn't as heavy at all. The circular ring attachment part is strong and great for not loosing your keys on a normal carabiner.
5.0,These are the best pair of sunglasses I have bought to date. Stylish and provide great protection from the UV Rays. No glare either.
5.0,"Great bag!  Good quality, straps, zippers, etc. work smoothly and easily.  I've had this bag for over a year now, and it's holding up perfectly.<br /><br />EDIT (4-26-18):  Bag still works great, and no issues."
5.0,"I love everything about this bag, the cost, the feel, the look, the size, but I had a friend tell me this may be made out of dog or cat....please God tell me that is not true.  I gave this a 5 star, but I would like to know more about the make of this bag, considering the cost and the claim it is leather, really makes me wonder!"
5.0,I can't believe how nice these are or how many I got for the same price as one pair at Hot Topic. They are true to size and even better looking in person.
5.0,Gave as gift to teenage girl. She loved them.
5.0,"You don’t need to give them a second thought, great firm clasp, stays in no issue but isn’t difficult to get them off when needed. Comfortable to sleep in I have one in my daith, in both second lobe piercings and 2 in my nose. They’re awesome I never take them out but it’s nice to have the option to that doesn’t require pliers or finding a piercer to help you remove a captive bead."
5.0,Nice finish!!!
5.0,Got this for my niece's first birthday. I was pleased with how much prettier it looks in person than in the picture! Great fit and soft material.
5.0,"My daughter loves it, perfect for a cool and nice spring day"
5.0,"I've decided to leave this blanket review for the 3 orders of scarves from different sellers, that I purchased for myself and a friend a few weeks ago, because there were many and my experience overall applies to all of them.<br /><br />I expected to wait several weeks before placing each order because of what other reviewers experienced, along with the span of the projected arrival dates given when the scarves were actually shipped.  Anyone buying these scarves should be aware there's going to be a wait but despite that ALL ARRIVED a good bit SOONER than the first date of each span given.<br /><br />Each time I received one parcel from overseas containing the majority of the scarves on the order---admittedly all bunched together in a paper shipping envelope but individually packaged in cellophane---and all arrived safely with no ironing required before wearing.  The remainder followed not too long afterwards, either singly or with 2 or 3 in a package.<br /><br />With the exception of one scarf which was shorter than I expected which limited its use somewhat, all were attractive and of good quality, especially CONSIDERING THEIR PRICE.  Had these been pricey scarves I would have never ordered several.<br /><br />I'm having a great time playing with the options that longer scarves allow and, all things considered, I'm as happy with this scarf as I am with those in my other orders."
5.0,Great Mask
5.0,I bought these for my son. I was nervous about which size would fit him best - he is away at college and I was unable to get a measurement.  I went with the large and it fit perfect. He used them this past weekend and he said they kept him warm and the touchscreen tips worked decent.
5.0,"Nice hat. , exchanging for smaller size."
5.0,"I love these leggings! There is light compression, the length hits me right above my ankle, and the waist is high and sooo comfortable. I could live in these leggings. Also, They’re squat proof."
5.0,"Very nice looking bag and a good size.  Almost gave it four stars because I thought I was ordering a lovely shade of medium blue.  The color turned out to be (yet) another navy purse.  The shade of blue looked so nice online; guess I didn't pay attention to the name of the shade....Navy!  But, if you're needing a (definitely) navy purse, this one is a good choice."
5.0,I like the dress and how it fits me.
5.0,Great quality! Very thick and warm
5.0,"Perfect, soft, and fun!!!! I had to contact their customer service department, and they get a A+."
5.0,It is an unusual combination of textures. It is well made.  My daughter loved it.
5.0,Grest fit
5.0,Good helmet i havent died yet
5.0,"I just love these bags, they are huge, and can hold a lot! The bags are lightweight and easy to carry, and so darn cute!"
5.0,Matches my blue diamond.
5.0,Love them! They fit perfect and look great ❤️
5.0,Im a size 16/18 and it fits Perfect! I got so many compliments!!!!
5.0,Great product! I got them as replacements on my Moto 360 2nd Gen. They for and the silicone is great so far. Cheapest bands I found and I'm very satisfied.<br /><br />One of the&#34;quick release&#34; pins was a little tight if a squeeze but it eventually went in. It seemed like it might be just slightly too long. But that was only one out of the 6 pieces that came in the package. But since I did get it to fit so didn't feel the need to take away and stars.
5.0,"A great beater watch with the classic style that appeals to me. No flash or features I don't need. Very comfortable strap, though I did replace with a nylon Nato strap that was a tight squeeze to put on with the included spring bars."
5.0,I love this tank top.  It's my go to.  Nice and soft and has held up after multiple washes.
5.0,BEAUTIFUL !!!!!!!
5.0,Not only is it cute but it is comfortable as well!
5.0,Bought this g F or my step Mom. She loves it.
5.0,"Great price on this frame, which I first saw at my optometrists’ office for over $200! I easily took this pair to get lenses put in, and the whole package, frames, lenses, and all ended up saving me at least $60 from what the frames alone would have cost at the office. One suggestion- there are two sizes of these frames: a 49 mm and a 51 mm version. It would have been helpful to know which size they were at the time of ordering."
5.0,like everything about them.  i even put em on to run to walgreen and took em back off when i return home.  nice fashionable shorts thats not only to bike in.  planning to buy a couple more pairs in different colors
5.0,Arrived on time. Look exactly as pictured.
5.0,Great quality and price
5.0,had to put weights in the handle straps to unwrinkle them.....purse is darling and bigger than I thought.....Granddaughter loved it!
5.0,Cute shoes and stay on my babies feet well as a new walker
5.0,Came on time...and LOOK awesome..my kids are going to LOVE THESE.. They are hard to zip up... I have to replace the zippers
5.0,"Just as beautiful as can be!  Our Lady loves the color blue, that is why I chose this one."
5.0,Great dress up and down pants~ love how they fit and look!!!
5.0,I bought this for my daughter as one of her Graduation gifts.  She is a tomboy and has small wrist so the fact that it is adjustable was great.  It is well made and she was very proud of it. Thanks
5.0,Great reversible jacket and I love both sides.  Quality workmanship and detailed embroidery.  I'm 5'4&quot; and 116 and a small fit.  The medium was too big so I returned it!  Definitely would recommend!
5.0,"We got this as a gift for my Sons girlfriend and after seeing it we know we've done good. The picture and description for this are very close to the actual item but the quality and workmanship are much better than be described or depicted in pictures. The weight of this is enough to know you've got on something nice on without being cumbersome. The quality of the leather and  rope type material is very good and looks like it will last a long time. Attention to detail and great quality are what you see in all the beads and charms, every thing attached to and hanging from this bracelet is detailed so nicely it going to impress anyone wearing or looking at it. The silver and bronze looking beads have detail so small I needed a magnifying glass to see it all the patterns on them is very pretty and is all the way around the bead the dark and light brown beads are all smooth and finished to a high shine The cross has band type details on every end and unlike most crosses it's done on both sides and is very attractive. The large X on the leather band looks like brass and instead of being glued to the band this one is attached with a through the leather band rivet.  Putting this on is as easy as it gets slide tit open at the leather ends then tighten it by pulling lightly one one cord, the opening does not come apart there no buckle, snap or hook and loop on this any where .There's nothing about this bracelet I don't like and I don't have to worry about if falling apart the first time it's worn or after years of use.. I'm very pleased with this HITOP bracelet and I'm not worried at all about how much she's going to like it. This arrived very quickly and  it got here in perfect condition. I can highly recommend this seller and this bracelet  to anyone looking for a catchy item for them or as a gift for any occasion.. I'll be looking at this sellers other items as well. I hope this review helps to decide if this item is right for what the buyer wants<br /><br />I received this item free or at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. I use or witness every item I review being used and I inspect each item as well. I never offer or promise a positive review to anyone. My opinion is based solely on the items performance, looks and quality."
5.0,"This is a beautiful, unique, and well made charm. The chain is short, thin, and delicate, but easy to switch the charm to a better necklace. Definitely worth the price for the charm alone and much nicer than the cheap plated metal versions."
5.0,I bought the watch for my husband to replace another watch. Loves it.
5.0,What I was looking for.
5.0,Great hat! Packaged well.
5.0,"This was just slightly smaller than I expected, so the buttons pull around my waist. I have gained some COVID weight so I had ordered a size up but that wasn't quite enough. However, the shirt feels and looks good and will definitely be something I wear often as I work that back off. Seems like similar quality to my other light linen shirts. Definitely not a heavy work shirt but good for summer wear"
5.0,Love the color love the fit.
5.0,Great! love it used it for my pirates costume. People thought it was my real hair. I will be ordering from you again.
5.0,Great UV coverage.  Comfortable & color was perfect.
5.0,Cute shirt to wear either on vacation or for fun!
5.0,Our teenage son uses the gloves to ride his bike to school in Milwaukee WI. He loves them and they are beautiful and warm. Very satisfied and happy. Good price. Excellent quality.
5.0,Exactly what I need for a longer necklace without having to buy a whole new chain
5.0,I love this dress! Exactly like the image. Really nice for the price
5.0,"When these necklaces arrived they were already tied and bent but I followed another reviewers advice from a similar necklace and used my hair straightener to flatten them out. They look great and are exactly long enough to wear them how I hoped. They are also pretty soft. The ends look like they could fall off if pulled on, but if you leave them be, they should stay on fine. I love that you get 3 colors!"
5.0,I love the skirt it’s comfy and fits as true to size but the skirt walls up to the waist ..
5.0,"It runs small, hahaha, super cute though."
5.0,"These fits like pajama's should fit, soft, lose and comfortable plus they come in fun colors. These are not cotton they are more like a stretchy polyester. I love them so much I ordered a second pair."
5.0,Color great!
5.0,It fitted good
5.0,"Perfect fit, brand new"
5.0,I was skeptical but these are my favorite sports bras ever. The padding inside isn’t extra so you’re definitely comfortable. They’re also not too tight  I’m so mad these are not back in stock. All my friends love them too
5.0,Very cute. Great price
5.0,Bought them post surgery but kept using them for flight. Was really surprised how it completely helps during international flights (especially during landing)
5.0,Fit great and was absolutely adorable
5.0,I loved these bags I want more!  The are extremely light but strong and stretchy.  Great for a vacation where you are packing and unpacking a lot!!!!
5.0,"Bought this for the queen of the house, she like them a lot and so do I haha."
5.0,I've ordered 2 more pairs.
5.0,Great fabric and fit..gift for my daughter she loved it
5.0,"I lusted after a tank like this at a local boutique that ran for $80. I couldn’t bring myself to pay that much for it, so I immediately searched Amazon. I bought a large, one in white and one in black. I’m 5’2”, 36DD and pretty much a true Large. Both tops are longish, which I love. The neckline wasn’t too revealing and it was the perfect top to wear tucked in my pants and skirts!"
5.0,These pants are great in every way.. fit is perfect.. the Sherpa lining is thick and warm.  Love them!
5.0,Superb and fit correctly
5.0,I’m a little on the heavier side of things with a long torso. It’s super hard to find a sweater that’s the perfect length and width. This sweater ticks both of those box’s. It’s also super soft and it seems like it’s well made enough to were it’ll hold up over time.
5.0,The product is great! I have a hard time finding sunglasses that fit my wide (some people say big) head. So finally here's a pair of fashion statements that are exactly what they say they are. Very cool. If they only made prescription glasses....
5.0,"I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter who recently started swimming class. The shipping was very fast. When my daughter opened the package herself, she was really excited! We like the design. 3-piece design makes it very convenient for our little one. What she likes most is the butterfly and dot pattern with bright color. Now every time there is swimming class, she couldn’t wait to put it on. We are very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Very practical with great style!  Love them
5.0,I like it.  It is light weight and handles most of my things.  My other bag was too heavy and big and put too much in it.
5.0,NOICE!
5.0,Love the delicate Hamsa. Very pretty.
5.0,"I love the fit of this dress, the material, and the length of the dress because I'm 5' 9"". Whats not to like."
5.0,"Lovely patters, color adds a little something and I love how it fits"
5.0,Love these !
5.0,"These are good for the price. They aren’t “cool” looking but I wasn’t concerned with the looks. I wanted these to use for driving at night because the streetlights/city-lights and headlights of on-coming cars make it difficult for me to see and cause me to have headaches. These help with the glare of lights. I haven’t used them in the rain, yet."
5.0,Everything I expected and more!! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an edge to working out and losing weight.<br />It's a great motivational tool and is fun to use. I look at all of the fitness bracelets on the market and I got this one primarily for the heart monitor.
5.0,I am often told when wearing how cool a shirt I have on
5.0,"Great value, nice fitting glasses."
5.0,This product fits like a dream. I recommend definitely checking the sizing chart and it will fit perfectly.
5.0,I wore this top with black tights and booties. I got a lot of compliments. It was a super cute top.
5.0,"It's simple, reliable, and just does the job. AND, it hardly costs anything. I've had a lot of watches, but I have stopped wearing most of them, and prefer to wear this one almost every day. It is what it is, and I love it."
5.0,"These earrings were extremely cheap so I didn't expect much out of them! However, even though they look cheap they are still truly adorable and add a little edge to any outfit! I love the silver pair a little more, as the black looks a little too cheap for me! I do love these though, and highly recommend for the price they are at!"
5.0,I love celestial themed jewelry and this necklace is SO cute! The pendant is a little bit smaller than I expected but it's still beautiful. The chain doesn't leave green marks on my skin and doesn't get tangled in my hair. I love it!
5.0,I love this!
5.0,Exactly what I needed to replace an old rusted one on a still good lead rope.  Very nice piece of hardware for the purpose.
5.0,I gave this as a present to my goddaughter and she loved it!
5.0,"It's light, warm, has a very soft lining...love the color as well. Very glad I got it!"
5.0,Very sturdy. You wound find this in stores. This is a good product. I recommend.
5.0,Love the throwback look of this cap! Well made & comfortable!
5.0,"Great material for soaking up water and keeping warm. Good construction. Colors just as pictured. Liked them so much for my daughters, I bought two more as gifts for my niece and nephew.  I ordered bigger sizes so they are longer and keep the kids warmer on their legs after a bath, shower, or swimming. We roll up the sleeve cuffs if needed and then there is room to grow as well. The kids love the hoods for helping to dry their hair and keep their heads warm. Very pleased! Couldn't find these real terry cloth robes for kids anywhere else, especially for this price! Will buy more as they outgrow them! Great for gifts too."
5.0,LOVE this shirt! Fit perfectly.
5.0,I will be using it for the month of October. It is a nice size purse without being too big.
5.0,"It came in less than a week, it is a beautiful coat, fits like it was made for me,  I love it."
5.0,"This mask fits much better than my last singing mask, and although I don't love singing in a mask, this one is the best possible solution out there!"
5.0,"Beautiful necklace, if you love Fashion  this one is great product, for everyday style"
5.0,Love it wish it was little bit bigger!
5.0,"This item was more than was expected. I thought I would just use for around the house, but its so great, the fit and the feel and its ability to get dry so quickly its a keeper I am ordering another set."
5.0,Excellent quality<br />Excellent price
5.0,Surprisingly good fit. Thought it would be too big as I usually wear size large in turtlenecks but this was 1X and I washed it before wearing and it fits great.<br />Would like to find larger Buffalo print
5.0,"I thought I didn't like watches... until I bought this watch. I love it. It is small and out of the way, but still very readable and easy to use. The watch is incredibly durable; apocalypse-level durable. If you are not a watch person, I highly recommend giving this one a try."
5.0,These not only are the cutest best friend hats ever but they shipped super fast. Very happy with my purchase!!
5.0,These sunglasses stay put and look good. Wear for biking and running with no issues.
5.0,This necklace was just like the movie it was beautiful and was the perfect gift for a Descendants fan!!
5.0,I love this hat because it is stylish and I can bend the rim the way I want it.  It's light weight which is nice in the Summer.  I may go back for the pink one.
5.0,Have bought several of these in different colors for me and my girlfriends and we all love them
5.0,So cute! My sister will love it.
5.0,Love these tags! Very useful and easy to spot. The hot pink color is really cute. Highly recommend.
5.0,Mi hija quedó encantada con este disfraz
5.0,Very well made and I love the soft fabric. It holds up well in the wash and the color does not fade. I love SHERRYLO bathing suits!
5.0,"Bought these to replace my house slippers that get torn up every winter. They're surprisingly warm, the soles keep your feet quite warm. The comfort level is up there with sneakers with a lot of cushion or gel insoles. The best part is that they don't look like house shoes and they're quite stylish. I think I've found my go to house shoes"
5.0,"I got so many compliments on this dress. I wore it to a wedding. Fits great, comfortable, easy to move it, did not make me to hot, and it was beautiful for pictures. I got the green dress and it reminds me of Christmas so I will be wearing it again when that season rolls around again."
5.0,Exactly as pictured and described. It’s not missing a button this is how it’s designed. It comes with two top buttons. The quality is much better than I expected.
5.0,"This fit *almost* perfectly and is very flattering. I say *almost* just because I have to loosen the tie at the top a little for coverage, (I'm not that perky anymore!!) But it's really flattering and nicely made! I do love it!!"
5.0,"ring is very pretty and fits to size, thanks."
5.0,"I love my coat for all of the time before our true Chicago winter. Definitely for mild cold weather, not for the freezing Chicago winters.  Love it."
5.0,"Love these shorts! They fit as expected.  I'm 5'11"" and they are the perfect length.  Very comfortable and flattering! And don't ride up when your walking!"
5.0,Good face covering. Soft breathable material.
5.0,"I think I already gave a review. Anyway, I love my urn necklace. We lost our sweet dog last month, and I looked at tons of urn necklaces, and decided on this one, because of it being a different sort of heart, plus I love the saying on the heart."
5.0,"Very shinny, looks good on, great price and quality. The size is perfect."
5.0,"Oh my god, I love these boots! They are perfect! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, Demonia!"
5.0,Fits nicely and works great for sitting in my hot tub!
5.0,Granddaughter loves them! Great play shirts.
5.0,"Actually bought to wear our but paired with a jacket and tights for work, too"
5.0,"Bought it today as a replacement to my Adidas Climacool Compression Shorts....<br />I am not sure if the lenght also depends on the size, but I would have liked it to be a tad longer.... The shorts are really tight, but in a good way.... I would sweat after working out or playing soccer, but my thighs would be quite dry compared to the rest of my body.... To me, it does its job to provide a great support to your thighs/hamstrings...."
5.0,"I'm 5,8 185 lb and wasn't sure if the size 34 would fit but instead fit perfectly. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I am very pleased with the design of these eyeglass cords.  I had to return a previous pair from a different company because they didn’t stay on my glasses.  I decided to try yours, and they work perfectly. I also love the colors!"
5.0,Very comfortable after my first 2-hour ride. I've had one other gel and foam bike short and this one is the most comfortable.
5.0,I use the pins when I present an employee with a certificate of training. The employee can wear the lapel pin as a representation of their commitment to excellence.
5.0,"My daughter gave this to her dad, who’s a truck driver. It meant a lot to him!"
5.0,"I adore these sunnies, and the case that they came in were the cutest!!"
5.0,It's beautiful. It was well packaged with even a small plastic tab to keep the battery from engaging and wasting energy. It's loose; I have a 7&#34; wrist and it's about 9 inches long. I will be taking out a few of the chain links.
5.0,These are awesome! Great fit and keep my feet warm in the winter!
5.0,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!  The quality is better looking in person.  I am extremely pleased.
5.0,"Great fit, great feel, great buy!!!"
5.0,It's has a nice look to it and can be worn with any piece of work clothing.
5.0,"WOW! My first statement necklace; I was so worried I wouldn't be able to wear it without looking like I'm trying too hard... I opened this at work and immediately put it on! OMG.. I am in love with this piece. Nothing was broken, as others have reported. It looks great, isn't too heavy and I imagine it will be worn often. So glad I took a chance!!"
5.0,"Very fast service.  Nice fabric and fits perfectly, I usually wear a 16-18."
5.0,nice sweatshirt
5.0,"Sometimes costume jewelry can look so fake that it isn't worth much, but this looks real among my gold rings. Its unique design and cut of cz really sparkles in any light. I wear it mixed with different gold rings or stackable set. True to size ot is a great fit."
5.0,My second pair from them. The size of wooden sunglasses can sometimes be too big and these are perfect.
5.0,"I bought this for my husband to wear at an 80's party.  The shirt came in as expected, quality of the shirt was not and I repeat not cheap.  The design was great.  Overall, both my husband and I were very pleased.  The shirt will shrink at wash time but very little.  It runs slightly big so consider that when you order.  Overall, the shirt was as we expected and we loved it."
5.0,"Es un bolso pequeño, muy bonito y coqueto,para cuando sólo tienes que llevar algunas cosas.Llaves,cell ....."
5.0,This is cute and came fast. It was a gift and they loved it 🥰
5.0,"Great fit, but a little short."
5.0,Super cute and different and that’s what I like about it.
5.0,"Great hat, just as described."
5.0,It fits well and seems to be of quality material
5.0,I love the Hazelnut Color. So cute with a belt. I really want to buy more.
5.0,Got this for my girlfriend and it has been about 3 years ago and she still loves it and it really holds up well. She loves it
5.0,"I loved this dress! I bought this dress a couple of years ago as well as the pink petticoat with it. It was really flattering I've worn it three times and got so many compliments each time. Im 4'10"" 135 lbs and bought a medium. Wore a good strapless 34DD bra and the tightness of the halter had me comfortable and secure. The back has some stretch as well. Its so worth it to buy a belt as an accessory because the sash that come with the dress is more like a ribbon. It's tea length (mid calf) on me which is what I was going for.  I was called a living doll in this dress!"
5.0,These are such a hit!!! They came in a little soft case which is nice for when you’re not wearing them. I absolutely love them
5.0,These look just like the picture. They are buttery soft. Squat proof but not thick. They are not compression leggings but still great for working out or lounge wear. They fit true to size and if you like your leggings tighter order a size down as they do have a good amount of stretch to them.
5.0,"A girl can never have enough pretty skirts!<br /><br />The skirt fit just as expected - I always wear mine just a bit under my belly button... higher on the waist, with a tucked in shirt, and this is PERFECT for it. Love that it has a zipper on the side, and still has the stretch material around the waist! This is huge because I've literally worn skirts that give me a stomach ache because they don't stretch around the waist. The material is so pretty, and the pattern is beautiful!! It falls just below my knees, great length.<br /><br />I'm a medium in skirts and this one fit me just right. I would definitely recommend checking the measurements before ordering this, I think if you are an x-small this would be a bit too big! *I was given this skirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review*"
5.0,"Quick delivery, great product!"
5.0,"preferible si mejoran la calidad y los tonos "" dice negro, pero es gris"""
5.0,I bought this dress for my niece and wore it to her sisters graduation and it was just Looking lovely  her. It gets very well and the material was soft on the skin I would buy this dress again.
5.0,There was nothing I did not like about this mask
5.0,Beautiful crown!  Very heavy so you can't wear it for long. 😳
5.0,"worked great when i was pregnant my bras started to not fit and this helped out a lot, avoided me having to buy a bigger size."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous !<br />My new favorite shirt 😉
5.0,Love the case. Lots of compliments!
5.0,Pretty dress and very stretchy! Feels like butter also!
5.0,Breaks easy😯
5.0,Got this to wear on long days spent in airports and in airplanes. Super comfy while still being cute. Overnight flight approved.
5.0,There are many different bands available for the Apple Watch this one is comfortable and very secure without putting a plastic loop underneath my wrist To secure the band.
5.0,"I have fallen in love with this brand!  Beautiful, unique designs.  Incredible quality!"
5.0,I wish you would bring back these socks. There are no other socks like these! These are the BEST socks I ever bought !!!! PLEASE bring back these socks! The comfort and how they keep my feet dry is AMAZING!! What is it that I can do to help bring these socks back!? Please…….
5.0,"Thank you so much for taking care of your customers - I will definitely be back!  I had a couple of things regarding these earrings, but the seller helped me out each and every time - I am so impressed with the service.<br /><br />These earrings are my man's favorite earrings - the white gold gives just that tiny bit of shine to catch the eye without being blingy.  Beautiful, and they fit perfectly on his tiny ear lobes without looking ostentatious. The earrings come shipped in a nice little box, so it's already ready for gift giving."
5.0,Wonderful comfortable well made Perlon style strap that adjusts to my 7&#34; wrist perfect with little to no tail.
5.0,"Love this wallet/purse. I have the Wonder Woman purse and it fits well inside it. I can also just use it as a clutch, when I don’t need my big Purse! Everything fits, all my credit cards and my check book easily with room."
5.0,Works. Saves my ears!
5.0,My daughter in law loved it it’s super cute gonna have to get one for myself
5.0,This bracelet looks better in person than in the photo. The tranzanite stones have a striking blue/lavender dichroism and the 10k gold is very sturdy. A little difficult to snap on the safety latch the first several times you wear it but it is very secure. This is not top-grade tanzanite but for the price this bracelet is a steal and very beautiful! Highly recommend.
5.0,I love this dress it fit me very good all except a little long
5.0,"It's cozy and comfortable to wear.  It is a long outfit... down below the waist. However, the stretchy bottom can move up to your waist and hold it to your waist, the extra cloth hang over it nicely.  It does not look like too much clothes over your waist. It can be adjustable to your body well."
5.0,"Nice and sturdy, clips onto belt loops easily, and is a bit stylish too!"
5.0,"Good quality, fast service. This band is made well and it looks good too. The stitching is very nice also. I would definitely recommend this band for anyone looking for a change. I bought the black one."
5.0,The soft furry inside of this eyeglass holder protects my glasses perfectly. I use it on my nightstand.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a21dab0bee667f6be7fb2f03b0016560]] I needed a new pair of Biking gloves at I just started back riding.  I needed something that would offer nice padding on the palms of my hands.  These have Gel in all the right places which will keep my hands from tingling after riding for a long time.  They are very comfortable and grip the handlebar very nice.  You could even use these around the yard if you wanted when working with tools.  I like the Skelton design especially as we head into Halloween :-)  I ordered the XL and according to the measuring diagram to the left of the gloves it tells you to measure around your hand which I did.  I was between 9 and 10 inches and so I ordered the XL and the fit perfect.  There is some stretch so you will have more room if your hand ls larger.
5.0,Bought these to replace another pair of knockarounds  that my wife lost during a drunken adventure in Seattle. Super durable and they look great. If you break or lose them you don’t feel bad getting another pair. Doubt they will break since they are pretty tough.
5.0,I was exceedingly surprised that this dress fit perfectly.  I normally cannot wear shirtwaist dresses as the darts just do not fall right.  But this dress fit like it was made for me.  I love it.
5.0,Great slippers! Love the ability to adjust using the Velcro of feet swell. Very comfortable
5.0,Really like these for working out not a ton of compression but very comfortable and long. I am 6’7 and it it nice not having something ride up
5.0,Love the gloves. Soft and comfortable inside and out. Fit nicely.
5.0,"I saw these on IG but when I went to the page's site, not only were they pricey, but they also didn't have the color I wanted. I search Amazon and found them here. Affordable and great quality!!!!!"

5.0,Great design and good quality from Sweden
5.0,Very pretty fits well for my grand daughters basketball games and practices. Love it
5.0,The product is great!  The delivery was terrible. Thankfully the neighbor was honest and brought it over to me. This happens all the time. My address is painted very large on the curb!
5.0,"Lovely skirt, would buy again. Very classy and elegant."
5.0,This polishing towel did a great job cleaning up jewelry that had not been cleaned in years. Well worth the money and the mess that was left on my hands. :) My hands clean up easy enough.

5.0,"The styling & quality stand above.<br />The lenses are crystal clear.<br />I lost my pair of Hydes at the beach and straight up went and purchased another pair.<br />I have two other very popular brand sunglasses, but these MVMT Hydes are my favorites."
5.0,"I wasn't sure of this watch at first, but I love it. Was not excepting the quality to be that good. However, they feel really secure and feel nice. Definitely buying more colors."
5.0,Gift for my daughter...she loved them.
5.0,WELL MADE TRUE IRELAND MADE SWEATER AND A KEEP SAKE FOR FUTURE CHILDREN. ADORABLE !!!
5.0,Love these leggings
5.0,Was kind of snug but I guess you stretch them out a bit.  Fit great now.
5.0,"Excellent fit, medium-weight hoodie. It feels “beefy” but not too heavy.  Very good quality. Would not hesitate to reorder."
5.0,FITS PERFECTLY
5.0,Replacing batteries has gotten expensive. Solar is the way to go. Keeps accurate time. Looks nice.
5.0,"Body type: 5’3”, 165lbs, 36B. With a bit of a mom pouch 🤷🏻‍♀️ Lol<br /><br />It’s a little tight but still very comfortable. Wish I had got one size up. I would recommend doing so if you have a bigger chest as the cups were the part that fit a little tight. However, overall, I am very pleased. It’s very flattering and makes me feel comfortable and pretty 🙂 See attached pictures for reference on how it fits."
5.0,Beautiful dress...love it
5.0,awesome color and fit
5.0,"Me gusto mucho este vestido es como aparece en la imagen, es lindo gracias Amazon y OWIN"
5.0,A light weight hoodie that fits nicely.  Bought my normal size and it is perfect.
5.0,"all I can say is it was for my granddaughter and she liked it, after all, she asked me to order it for her."
5.0,It fixs perfect. I wanted it to help dress up a dress it was great!
5.0,My son loves this shirt.  Great value - soft and comfortable.
5.0,"I still wear this one with a longer tankini top, but could be worn with a bikini top too!  Great material, shaping and comfy!"
5.0,"Amazing skirt, love the look of it.  I weigh 157 lbs and I bought a medium, which had plenty of room to spare.  It is for regular/normal heights, so mine was a bit long for my 5'2 height, but I am used to that!  I just need to find some good shirts to go with it!"
5.0,Perfect colors where the same as pictured
5.0,Boyfriend loves it.  Says it keeps him very warm while biking to work.
5.0,"This is gorgeous.  I have had so many compliments.  It is a very large stone, but so pretty.  I wear it on my middle finger."
5.0,Fit me perfectly! Coverage was excellent for my age.  Looking forward to other colors.
5.0,I'm 5'3 and 138 pounds and I originally bought a small and it fit a little tighter than I like.  I returned it and tried a medium which I think fits much better.  I like everything to fit nicely and look smooth on my shape and the medium does this.  Even with a little less weight I think the medium will still look nice.
5.0,It is exactly as I expected!!! Love the material and the way it fits!!!
5.0,New favorite glasses very good quality and look supper cute too!
5.0,Arrived quickly & is super cute. Took it to Disney World w/us & my 19y/o son wore it the whole time w/o complaint.
5.0,"This is my 3rd pair. I'm 65 and am mothering 3 currently 12,7, & 5. I need lots of pockets. These have a great waist pocket that my credit card holder fits perfect in. Buy these made very nice and the price is awesome."
5.0,I am 5'2 about 127lbs. I wear a US size 4 and ordered a small and it fit great. It's a little tight around the legs but I was able to stretch it a little. I do not have a butt so it didn't bother me to much. I LOVE these bottoms. They go high enough above my bully button that I was wanting to cover.
5.0,"I followed the reviews and ordered half a size up, wish I would have went with my normal size. But I love them and made them work just fine!"
5.0,These are very comfy! I bought them for my son's upcoming wedding. I wear a size 7 and the medium fit perfect. I love the bag. Fits my heels nicely.

5.0,Thoughtful and inexpensive-great for men or women-love it!
5.0,I love how comfortable this is
5.0,"I ordered a medium (5'6&#34; and 150lb) and it fits great! I'm in my 60's, a teacher and I often wear with a lacy scarf. Flares at waist so very forgiving. I'm often on the rug with my students and this dress makes it easy. I can dress it up with a jacket and heels or go casual with a scarf and flats."
5.0,Great value and very classy looking
5.0,Great bag but putting the straps through the loop was difficult but once it was in the bag is amazing
5.0,"I had a purse very similar to this that lasted three years so I had a hard time finding a purse that I liked or thought would last as long. I came across this one and after looking through the photos decided to give it a shot. As I said in the title, it was better then I anticipated. It is very roomy with multiple compartments, which is a must for me. I can store my Kindle, phone, make-up, paperwork, gloves and hat all in this baby without it looking cluttered. The overall appearance of the purse is beautiful with the black leather and gold accents. The only thing I will note was that when I received the purse, it had an interesting smell. I let it air for a day or two and it was no longer a problem. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,Perfect Florida shirt for casual  wedding
5.0,Great for keeping shoes looking new!
5.0,This bra is a very nice color to go under any shirt. It is very supportive and thick but still breathable.

5.0,Love them!  Beautiful!
5.0,It's a little bit thicker than the chain I'm replacing and works great with my charms. I would buy it again.
5.0,"Awesome product, great price."
5.0,Super warm and true to fit. Touch screen a plus. Love them.
5.0,"I haven’t actually skied with them yet but these are very good quality for the money. They’re big, which I like, but they still fit inside my helmet. They are “frameless”, meaning the lenses sit over, rather than within the frames, which combined with the mirrored finish gives them a bug-like look, but I think they’re pretty cool. But because they are frameless, they need to be stored on a protective bag or cloth to prevent scratching."
5.0,"Super cute, well made. Happy with purchase."
5.0,Love these cute owls. They are bigger than I thought they would be. Love the moonstone in them. Comfortable fit and weight.

5.0,It’s sooo beautiful!!!
5.0,Love the yellow color!

5.0,"Perfect fit, looks gorgeous, great material. I haven't washed it yet so I'm not sure how it will hold up when washed/dried. Love the color, exactly like the picture. I'm going to get many more colors. It's so comfortable I may never wear a real bra again."
5.0,I like the colors and the fit
5.0,Very fast shipment and a really nice watch!

It's like having a flock of butterflies clinging to your neck, and it's perfect for spring and summer.<br /><br />The &#34;silver&#34; won't fool anyone, but the butterflies themselves are so detailed and well placed that it doesn't matter.  This necklace is flattering, comfortable, and looks like a boutique one of a kind piece."

5.0,My granddaughter loved it. Perfect with a pink sweater.
5.0,"Such a gorgeous ring! I only wished I had ordered a size 7 instead of a 9. The ring is very comfortable to wear, but I little looser than I anticipated. I sized up since the ring is bigger. But these babies fit true to size. The detail of the scales and teeth on the dragon are amazing. Excellent craftsmanship. I love it!"

5.0,Loved it!! The color was perfect and it fit wonderful.
5.0,They really are the best. Great support. Easy to put on. Thin enough you don't die of heat in the summer. Highly reccommed them.
5.0,"I bought my wife a pack of these with the hope that they would not be too tight on her feet.  She has thick/meaty feet from years of kickboxing, and &#34;regular&#34; socks just don't cut it any more.  She was using compression socks previously, but is ready for more comfort; the roll top and not-tight fit around her foot make these a clear winner.<br /><br />IE: she loves them, and I have been tasked with ordering more for her.  She has also expressed delight regarding the festive coloration.  If you or your loved one wants some socks that fit well but not tight, these are the best I've found for my wife, and she's a sock-snob."
5.0,Very cute and quaint!
5.0,Such a great purchase!  I love to go hiking and enjoy long runs and this allows me to do so without flapping against my back when I pick up speed. Super lightweight and comfortable. The only thing I would change is allowing the shoulder straps to tighten a bit more because of my small stature so it could sit slightly higher
5.0,I typically wear a 4 in jeans and am just under 5'4&#34;. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly! It goes to my ankles and I got so many compliments on how flattering it fit. Love it!
5.0,Awesome buy

5.0,"These are great, our daughter absolutely loves these.  She regularly doesn't want to take them off in the morning and they aren't so &#34;pajama&#34; looking that she looks funny out of the house on &#34;get up and go&#34; kind of mornings.  Perfect for warmer nights."
5.0,Very light weight fabric. Didn’t know it has to be dry cleaned. So not fond of that.  But the short is nice and comfortable
5.0,It's a great shape!  I love the square shape of the bag.  It allows me to carry many more items than a regular bag.
5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. I love it! It's perfect for nicer occasions such as weddings or for everyday. He normally wears a large Fitbit band and I had to take maybe two or three links out of this for it to fit properly.
5.0,Perfecta y original la talla S me quedo a la medida
5.0,Got for my gf. She loved it.  True to size.  Soft material
5.0,It is very sturdy but not real heavy.  It works very well for me.  I needed a way to separate my keys when getting  my car serviced.  This works well.

5.0,"I have to admit that I bought this watch on a lark.  It looked very nice but I had never heard of BUREI before so this was a bit of a gamble in my mind.<br /><br />The leather band is imprinted with the BUREI name and has a signature buckle.  Coming out of the box the watch band emits a very strong chemical smell.  It was so bad that my first instinct was to wash the band.  It didn't change the smell at all.  I set the watch aside with disappointment and resolved to return the watch.  Over the course of the next day, however, the smell significantly decreased until it faded away altogether.  Since it didn't smell anymore, I decided to keep the watch.<br /><br />The presentation is nice.  The watch comes in a very nice presentation box and a gift bag.  The watch itself looks very professional.  I've worn it to work and have received several compliments on how nice the watch looks.  It looks great whether in a suit or in casual clothes.<br /><br />I was surprised that the movement hacks and also allows manual wind.  I was curious about the movement so I looked at the back and was pleasantly surprised that the Japanese movement that the ad touted was, indeed, a Japanese movement and not some unknown Chinese movement.  The movement is a Seiko NH36A (an unbranded Seiko 4R36) which is a 24 jewel automatic day/date with hack and manual wind.  So far, after running it for several 24 hour periods against an atomic clock, it looks like the watch gains less than 9 seconds per day out of the box.  Nice!  We'll see if it settles down to better accuracy after I break in the movement.<br /><br />So, despite my reservations I'm very pleased with the watch.  I was afraid that I was getting a cheap knockoff, but it turns out that this is a quality watch well worth the price (just under $100).  It's a very professional looking watch in a very attractive yet understated way, and it has a quality Seiko movement that keeps very good time.  I'm glad I took a chance on the watch.  I'll be checking out other BUREI watches now."
5.0,Bought for a bachelorette trip and they were a hit!
5.0,"These masks fit nice and snug. They're highly rated for keeping out particles. They are as good as the n95s but just made in South Korea. Of course I believe that because of the pandemic companies are price gouging. So though these are less than other masks and price, I still believe there too high. But since there about the same as other types of this quality, I purchased them. They have been a great mask. They're very comfortable and easy to breathe through. I recommend these for everyday use."
5.0,Quite nice ans a great price. I wish the red white and blue were available on my size
5.0,This dress is so cute! As soon as I recieved it I had to try it. It fit good I am normally a size XL and ordered size 22 after reading reviews and reviewing size chart. It fit perfectly I was able to just slip it on due to the fabric having some stretch. The only thing was the belt was definitely not the same size but I was able to add a whole and it fit. I highly recommend this dress and Also take measurements before ordering I am definitely going to buy different styles of the same dress. Can’t wait to wear it at church today as the length is passed my knees and modestly. The sleeves are also perfect.
5.0,"My wife had bought this for me. I had lost the one I wore a number of years ago. St. Jude is the patron of hopeless causes, impossible dreams.<br />I have worn a St. Jude medal since a child. I truly believe in wearing this medal. I am a believer that what others think are hopeless, I see hope. I am a firm believer that St. Jude is helping me"

5.0,"Great quality, the only dislike i have is honestly they aren’t tagless. Outside of that its a great pack/purchase"
5.0,This is a nice dress but not for me. The black isn’t a true dark black and the length was not  appropriate for the occasion that I needed it for.
5.0,So I have a color and soft fabric
5.0,"Very cute dress! Wore this to a garden party and received many compliments! It cleans nicely, too. I washed it in cold water and hung it up to dry and it still looks great."

5.0,Simple cute budget friendly gift for the Nana in yoir kids life (:
5.0,"Better than I had hoped!! Pictures do not do this necklace justice! It is adorable, so well made and the chain length is perfect. I like the option to wear a necklace high on my neck where it fits between the collar bone and longer if I want. Most I have to adjust frequently throughout the day, this rests perfectly and the BEST part is that the pineapple is built into the chain so the clasp part never turns."
5.0,Perfect everyday dress. You can dress it up or down. I will be buying another one in a different color! I’m 5’4 and I weight between 150-155lbs. I bought a large and it fits perfectly.

Everyone at the party, loved how much attention to detail was put in to the costume."
5.0,"Nice affordable watch, very basic, and I get compliments on it."
5.0,"Toddler loves these and thinks they are part of his safety gear, so he's more than willing to put on the helmet, elbow and knee pads, just to wear these."

5.0,I love the buttons! They are a great addition to my Blue Blazer!
5.0,"It’s very elegant,  modern and well built."
5.0,Have this dress in  3 colors. Love the fit and fabric. I am 5'5 and it falls below the knee. It looks very classy. There is an invisible zipper in the back. The bow at the nexk is stiched so it won't move or hang over.
5.0,"Bando planners are amazing. Well made, the wire binding is very sturdy. Perfect for my daughter for high-school."
5.0,Cute outfit!
5.0,"Absolutely adorable top; I love the swing style, the lightweight fabric and the very cool sleeves, I am 5'3&#34; and weigh about 140 lbs give or take, and I have a 39&#34; bust. I could have worn the L but ordered the XL and am glad I did. If I had nice legs and was younger, I could wear this as a dress, but I'm happy to wear it as a tunic over leggings.<br /><br />Warning: Anytime you deal with an item this reasonably priced you must considered the possibility of shrinkage, which is why I ordered a size larger. I don't understand people who order items without checking out the accompanying size chart or checking their own measurements, and then complain if an item is too tight.<br /><br />This style of top is not supposed to be skin tight nor is it supposed to hug anything but your Bustline. If that's what you are looking for, this isn't the top for you. But if you like something that accentuates your bust while hiding your tummy or rear, BINGO! This is definitely for you. I have to run...ordering 2 more!"

You would not be able to walk in them. We let the seller know and they sent a new pair the next day. Thank you for your quick and speedy response/delivery. My 3 year old looooooved them....she can’t wait to wear them for school.
5.0,"What can I say other than, I love love love this little tool. It allows me to sew and keep my fabrics going in the right direction. It's really great when you have a seam to cross and everything is a bit thicker. The flat end of the tool is great for opening a seam when you sew it and allowing you to press it open without getting your fingers so close to a steaming hot iron. I highly recommend this tool to anyone who sews."

The design each one features is SO UNIQUE.  Here is why I love it:<br /><br />1.  Each one is a unique piece of art<br />2.  Made of high quality leather<br />3.  So cute it will receive tons of compliments<br />4.  Price is a bargain for such a one of a kind purse<br />5.  Secures your cash and credit cards away
5.0,"Adorable. I bought this for my son who is six months but is growing like a weed. I think it fits him perfectly even though it's a little on the large side. To me, the fact that it's a little large just means he'll be able to wear it longer."
5.0,I had wanted some prayer beads so I bought these and a few others. Some I will keep and give the others as gifts. I have been meditating and practicing yoga and that is why I had wanted them. My fellow yogis had also expressed interest. I was delighted when I opened up the package and saw them. 108 beads as stated and they can be worn as a necklace!
5.0,Very flattering.  Perfect length and looks really nice on.  I would order this again.
5.0,"Purchased this for my son, as we thought he would get more use out of an adult small rather than a youths largest size.  We were right. Pants are a little long, but that is fine."
5.0,Perfect buy
5.0,This is so cute and so soft. It’s a crop top but is still so warm. I seriously love it. I got a medium so it would be a little bigger and it was perfect
5.0,Excellent quality and affordable ! Thanks
5.0,Love love love these!  I own a restaurant and they have made such a difference in my feet and legs!

5.0,"Looks great, received quickly, well packaged. Thank you."
5.0,"I love this strapless jumpsuit.  I got it in black because I always wanted a black strapless jumpsuit.  They just look so chic and stylish.  I currently wear a size 6-8 in bottoms and 8-10 in tops and dresses because I am a 34DD.  I am just under 5’4”.  The jumpsuit is made in the USA and the sizing is true to USA sizing. I got the jumpsuit in a size medium and it fits great.  It’s blousy and loose like it should be, where it should be.  It is a little long but with the right shoe it won’t be an issue.  I usually have a problem finding a jumpsuit to fit properly because they are usually too long in the torso and the pant length but because the top should be blousy and the waistline and neckline are both smocked any extra length in the torso just means blousier which is fine because I am busty.  It’s just a great design that is adaptable for different heights and body types.  You can wear it dressed up with a cute pair of sandals or heels, with or without a belt, dressed down with casual shoes, even as a swimsuit cover-up.  I want to get a few more colors.  The material is a 95% rayon knit that is very soft and flowy and so comfortable.  I wash mine in a lingerie bag in cold water in my washing machine on gentle then hang it to dry.  I purchased mine at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

Couldn't find a Casio replacement band in purple, so we bought a black one.  It worked, but not quite the same..  This matches the purple watch and is much more comfortable than the plastic Casio band."
5.0,This was for my mom!!  It's perfect and she loves it!!!!!!!
5.0,I have seen these when I was helping a friend and helping him gardening. I used one pair of these and was impressed with the durability. The claws are something I have seen first time in a glove and they are really helpful for digging and mixing soil. My hands were comfortable and it was not sweaty after working in the garden. I think I found perfect gloves for gardening.
5.0,Loved this comfy little dress!!
5.0,I Iove it
5.0,These pants fit well and As I expected.

5.0,I saw a bunch of YouTube videos of people doing this mod and I was hooked.  I bought this and did the mod myself and am very pleased with the results.  The one thing I did not like was having to assemble the bracelet to the bezel.  The needle thin screws were so tight that I literally almost stripped 3 out of the 4 that needed to be attached.  Lucky enough I took my time and worked it back and forth to help open the threads so I did not strip them.  I would still recommend this if you have the patience to assemble this yourself
5.0,Very nice material. Fits perfect! Just ordered another on:)
5.0,"My 5yo loves it, she says it’s a great costume and really comfortable. Not sure it’s necessarily worth $30 but it’s cute."

5.0,I loved this dress
5.0,Love this purse! It's big enough to fit everything I need. I purchased the grey color and it is a great color for fall! I love that it has the smaller bags as well. The purse did have a bad smell at first but after using it that smell has gone away! I highly recommend this purse!
5.0,I love the color and pattern of this top. I'm never disappointed with PattyBoutik. High quality fabric!
5.0,Perfect fit and love it!

5.0,Would recommend product.
5.0,Very comfortable.  Fits great!
5.0,Very satisfied.
5.0,"Super cute dress, great length, and not see through at all despite the light color. I've bought from this brand before and knew to get a medium instead of small, which is what I normally wear. If you are between sizes definitely choose a size up for this dress. The bow in the picture is tied in the back but I normally like to wear cardigans with this style of dress so I tied it in front and slightly to the side and the dress still looks great either way."
5.0,Seems to be well made.  We work in the yard quite a bit and other straw hats have fallen apart after a few  wears.  Good coverage for face and head.
5.0,I love the color and how stylish this dress is ! I am bustier and had to safety pin to keep the top from being too exposing but I’d def buy again in brown just not sure the collar style is for me .
5.0,The only thing I dislike is the rubber on the bow. It snags my hair.
5.0,Great quality. Run a little large.
5.0,This dress is amazing! It looks exactly like the picture and fits really well. I couldn't be happier!
5.0,This dress is sexy it flares only issue was sleeves were not long enough. I’m 5’4
5.0,"It's awesome! Fit is perfect! I ordered large I'm 155lbs and a 36 C. I LOVE how high it is in the front and even with wearing a sports bra- esp black it looks like part of the Leo. I have no problem w the back clasp, the material is super stretchy, but I can see how if one is not flexible in the shoulders it could be a challenge."
5.0,This dress is very sexy and fits well. Even though the slit is very provocative it’s easily played down if paired with some nice heels I opted for black sneakers. Not to mention the slit makes sure to stay in place so no one is able to see the goodies.
5.0,Nice jacket. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,All my expectations was meet. I'm loving it
5.0,"I got this for Halloween, and it was perfect.  Super comfortable to wear all day and the right size for my head ---not too tight or too loose. Would definitely order again, given the choice."

5.0,Ordered the size as instructed and it fits perfectly. The print us beautiful. The fabric is high quality. The stitches are serged and or double stitched. The seams are straight and the dress lays beautifully. The skirt is even more flared than I expected!  Could not be happier with my purchase. Also arrived with in a week on standard shipping over the xmas holiday season.
5.0,Like it. Just next time I will get an XL than a 2x. Beautiful color. Great Bargain!!!
5.0,"I usually prefer Skagen watches, but this one appealed to me as being different with the blue.  It's a bit larger and heavier than a Skagen but very nice looking. And a bit lower priced than Skagen."
5.0,"The KF94 mask design has been our preferred mask design for daily use during the pandemic and beyond. We buy this for us and the kids size for our kids. They are comfortable, simple to use and reuse within the day as they collapse onto themselves while leaving the outside always not touching the internal parts of the mask.<br /><br />The elastics are comfortable and elastic enough to not pull too hard on your ears. This is well appreciated.<br /><br />Coming in individual packs allows for keeping a few in the car for when necessary without having to worry about getting dirty, reused or damaged in the glove compartment or the door pocket.<br /><br />We have recommended this mask design and this particular brand to several friends and colleagues. They all seem to like them as well. Specially for extended periods of time of use, like when travelling on an airplane, or public transportation."
5.0,what can I say. made my granddaughter happy!
5.0,I like A Tribe Called Quest... and this lets everyone know how cool I am! Couldn't ask for more from a shirt than that

5.0,Perfect! Exactly what I wanted!  Buying again if they have a bigger size
5.0,Wore on a longhaul transpacific flight.  These were extremely comfortable both for feet and calves.  These offer great support and are perfect for travel and on-your-feet all day jobs.  Easy to was and hold up to repeated use.
5.0,Great for my baby at sporting events!
5.0,"This is a very soft, comfy feeling night gown with some stretch to it.  Love the styling and longer length!  Bought as a gift now considering getting myself one."
5.0,These were great and fit my son perfectly.  He's 5 ft and 100lbs
5.0,This is on my old Leica looks good and functions very well
5.0,"Very thin, which is what I wanted."
5.0,Purchased for school production. Definitely fits our need.
5.0,I was very well pleased with the product.  It was exactly as advertised and the fit was perfect.<br />Would buy again and I recommend this product to everyone that is looking for a Winter Snow Boot.
5.0,"Since having lasick my eyes are super sensitive to glare. I find wearing these glasses to be a huge help, especially when driving. Extremely happy to have them!"

5.0,"Love it, very comfortable and good block for UV."
5.0,"These have become a staple. I'm on my third pair, because of my own irresponsibility. I will continue to order them as long as they're available though. Shipping is faster than they anticipate, at least in my case."
5.0,I really like this dress.It’s simple and flattering.I like that it comes with two belts for different looks.The dress is soft.I ordered a size large.
5.0,Purchased as a gift - fit perfectly and looks great.
5.0,Super cute for my kiddo. I can tell they are going to last a while.
5.0,"Gorgeous. Amazing. Soft, smooth, silky, with the most gorgeous lace pattern I've seen in ages. This robe makes me feel almost as sexy as it makes me look. Ties on the inside and outside so it won't fall open, the sash is attached at the back so it won't wrinkle or fold and it won't fall out or twist unevenly, a great length to look hot and flirty without showing your butt (unless you want it to). Probably my favorite purchase of 2016 so far."
5.0,Very attractive bracelet
5.0,"Love, love, love these shorts. I use them for pickle ball. Great fabric is Stu dry but light and flexible. Great length. Pockets will stuff with balls. I wear a size 16 and the XL fit perfectly. Wash and dry with no shrinkage or wrinkles. Wish they came in more than two colors!!"
5.0,I like the material. It’s light weight for warmer weather. Goes great with jeans or shorts
5.0,"Very good quality, nice, soft cotton. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I really wanted the matching mask but wasn't sure it was included. Took a chance that models with the item number beginning with C included the mask and I was right. So basically it was ony .50 cents more for the mask. Its lined and has a nose wire. As someone else mentions, it doesn't loop over the ears, the rubber band goes over the back of head. I like to walk to Starbucks in the morning and they require a mask to enter in my county, so now I can stay warm and be cute and in compliance.<br /><br />The mask has a weird smell, so hoping it dissipates if I let it air out. Will update my review if I have any issues after I've actually worn."
5.0,I'm sure it would work however I ordered a large thinking it would fit well instead of medium and as it turns out I'm too skinny and I can't cinch it down enough to provide any support. Slight waste of money on my end because I have someone to give it to someone that may find better use of it and I'm not paying to return it. Not a bad belt though for the price<br /><br />UPDATE<br />10/17/2016<br />The company Anseahawk contacted me and resolved the issue I had with sizing with no problems. Customer service was very polite and sets a standard for other companies to strive to attain. 10/10 Will definitely buy from them again
5.0,Very feminine and dainty.
5.0,"Really nice slim ties,super thin and bold, colors really contrast with my black and white shirts thank you!"
5.0,Nice for fishing and working in the garden ! Good sun protection
5.0,I bought this helmet for my husband. He is very happy with the coverage and weight of the helmet.
5.0,I purchased this gift for a 9 yr old and she is so happy. Wears it everyday
5.0,wife will shoot anyone who touches her new purse. No she doesn't carry a pistol concealed even though I offered to pay for her to get her concealed carry training. She loves the room and compartments.
5.0,These are adorable! Gifted them to my bridesmaids full of little goodies.
5.0,"love T, just on the small size"
5.0,These nose pads work well. I have several pairs of glasses including my prescription glasses that keep sliding down my nose. These do the trick so far. I haven't them very long so I can't vouch for their longevity.
5.0,"Wear a small at 5""6' 120lbs. Fits perfect.  Look great."
5.0,"Nice quality, very pretty and a great value!!"
5.0,"I have to admit I thought I would be disappointed.  HOWEVER, the quality of this piece is OUTSTANDING!!!  Beautifully crafted and looks like I paid alot more than I did for it.  Definitely ordering more from this vendor!!"
5.0,Pretty..a little smaller than I thought they would be but came in a box with extra backings and a nice card very classy I was so pleased with everything I will be ordering more items
5.0,Nice PJ's. Not crazy about color choices but definitely getting more of these. So comfortable
5.0,Very strong. Well made. I really love this strap. No-one will be able to take your Apple watch off of you and it won't fall off by accident.<br />The black finish looks very elegant. I don't think I would ever go back to the original silicon straps. Looks like it will last as long as the watch. Buy with confidence. Great price point.
5.0,Exactly what I expected. These are perfect.
5.0,"The most comfortable, soft underwear I have ever owned!"
5.0,Got this for the eighth-grade dance to say farewell to middle school and going to high school kid looks great
5.0,"Great first wallet for my son and my nephew. I gifted them both the same wallet. It’s heavy duty and comes with a carabiner and tough string. Should be great for them to travel, with their own money. Or hook inside their back packs. Lots of pockets for a variety of things."
5.0,seems strong and well made
5.0,"This dress is super cute and very comfortable. It feels really well made with really good quality. The material is very thick and good for the winter. I think it is definitely too warm to wear on a hot summer day, despite it looking very summery."
5.0,Comfy shirt for the price and holds up well in the wash.
5.0,The poncho was as described soft material but warm. Covers well with 2 ways to wear. Great for price
5.0,I’m not the fittest dude (yet) but have gotten into a good routine so thought it was time to upgrade.<br />This material ROCKS it’s so light & breathable it makes you feel like you’re exercising with your shirt off without the insecurity of everyone staring at your man boobs. Definitely shave your back before showcasing this one though lol ordering more right now 🤙
5.0,Great sturdy product. My phone feels very secure with this strap.
5.0,This bag was perfect for both of my flower girls. One was 1 year old and the other was 3 years old. This bag was great for both with the teddy bear and activity book!

5.0,"This was a birthday gift for our friend ""Dave"" in Michigan.  He absolutely loved it and said ""Yes, I know what a difference a Dave makes"".  We always try to get him something clever for his birthdays and this was a big hit!"
5.0,The ring was beautiful. Would order again.
5.0,purchased these ahead of time before the pandemic hit.  was to be used mostly for the hotter weather as it ventilates at the bottom for occasions of working outside.
5.0,"Ok for reference (because that is what I look for in reviews), here are my stats.<br />Size 18 - 6'3"" and 280lbs (I know, but I quit smoking so I am eating to replace it)<br />Cup sizes are 38DD or 36DDD - both fit.<br />I chose the 3XL and it is hooked on the tightest hooks - so if I lose weight it likely won't fit.  But I love it and it fits so nicely.  It rolls up slightly under the cups, but I will deal with that because I like the bra so much.  It holds, it's comfy and my back is smooth!<br /><br />Ordering a 2XL, so I have both sizes."
5.0,"It's a great, cozy hat!"
5.0,Super comfy. Great price. Provided proper cushion for my feet. So glad I purchased.
5.0,I love this ear cuff. Very adjustable fits to my ear great plus it is a beautiful earring. The price is great with great quality.
5.0,So pretty many compliments.
5.0,"After reading all the reviews, I ordered an XL. I'm normally an M on top and 6/8 on the bottom. Both the top and bottom were slightly too big but honestly, I'd prefer to be comfortable so definitely got the right size.<br /><br />I got SO many compliments on this. I wore it in the water and it held up well (no drooping).<br /><br />This is the first swimsuit I've felt pretty AND comfortable in in a long time."
5.0,These compression socks worked beautifully. I wore them on 2 flights and they kept my feet and ankles from their usual swelling. They were easy to get on and were quite comfortable.
5.0,"Fit as expected, nice style."

5.0,Exactly as pictured.Good quality.Highly recommend.

5.0,A++++++++

5.0,Great lenses
5.0,"Very cute dress, nice color fit nicely. Quick delivery."
5.0,Very nice!  I love it!
5.0,Bought  these earrings for my daughter's wedding for $10 they're absolutely beautiful  the perfect size big but not too big they sparkle! they are weighted buy not to heavy not light like a cheap hollow metal earrings I love Amazon! These earrings are incredible for the money!
5.0,We bought them for our 84 year old dad. He was so impressed with the change. He is now having to learn the names of colors he has never been able to see.
5.0,"I've ordered this in 2 colors now. I don't know what it is about this shirt, but I think it's so cute. I am 5'3"" 122 lbs and I ordered a small. I knew that it would be oversized, which is what I wanted. It's loose and comfortable and it's good material for the money. I'm probably going to live in these shirts this fall."
5.0,I bought this in blue and loved it so much I bought the second one in pink.
5.0,Love love love this exercise top.  So comfortable and no riding up anywhere. Bought several colors and so glad I did.

5.0,Best head bands I've ever purchased - absolutely great product
5.0,"This bag is wonderful!!!!  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. You can't beat the price. I have a Dell laptop for work; which is big and a bulky. This bag holds my ugly bulky work laptop with style. I just ordered another bag in a different color.  I know some reviews complained about the large size, but I need the big bag. It holds everything; the bulky laptop and the gigantic charger.  The straps are large enough to throw on my shoulder.  This will definitely be my summer work bag. I highly recommend this product. You can't go wrong."
5.0,"These are great! I detach the neck part and they are so thin I can breath easily,  but they are not see thru. I hate wearing masks,  but when I do, these are wonderful."
5.0,To my surprise I really like these.  I received them on the 3rd. and wore them all day on the 4th of July.  It's great to have a pair of beach/pool sandals that are actually comfortable to wear.
5.0,"I love the fact that they were post earrings (I don't like to wear ""danglies"" at work).  They look great, I get comments/compliments when I wear them."
5.0,Real cute dress! Fit well. I'm excited to wear it on vacation!
5.0,Love my new hat. Great value and comfortable.

5.0,lleno mis espectativas
5.0,Great! Thanks
5.0,They are worn every day for his firefighting adventures
5.0,It was SOOOOOO pretty. The fit is PERFECTLY PERFECT.
5.0,Fit so perfectly on my girl. Shes 7 1/2 but teeny so went with a 6.
5.0,Was a bit too big but that was my fault as I ordered a size up to make sure it would fit
5.0,"Bought as a gift.  She loved the dress, unfortunately it was a little to small so had to return.  Return process was one of the easiest I've had here on Amazon."
5.0,"Love it!! Fit perfect! Material is soft and doesn't look cheap. Its stretchy so whatever size you are, get it in that size. No need to go smaller or larger. From the pictures, I thought the arms were going to be a little loose on me because I'm skinny; but it looks great! I'm so excited to wear it!"
5.0,I loved these. Great quality
5.0,My daughter loves wide leg pants and has the adidas ones with stripe on side. So happy to also find plain black. Fits great.
5.0,Seems very well made and my granddaughter lives them!
5.0,"Love it! Matches my wristlet. Didn't understand for sure why it was called double-eye, but that is because it can hold 2 pair of glasses if necessary.  Both being right there in front, separated by the padded material. I only need it for 1 pair of reading glasses, but seems like it would work fine with two pairs of glasses."
5.0,Love these flip flops !! So glad amazon was selling them since payless no longer does!!! Keep em coming!
5.0,"Definitely good quality and have backing velco to sew onto coat, .etc"
5.0,Love the color and fringe!
5.0,Got this for my husband for walking our dog in the rain. It fits him great. Very light weight and fully waterproof. He also wears it when its slight chilly and windy out. Highly recommended.
5.0,Got it as a gift for a cat lover. She said it was purrrfect.
5.0,she will love it!!!!
5.0,got this item in September  it s November and still looks good  I wear it all the time
5.0,Quality material fits perfectly!
5.0,My wife loves it and I bought the men's wallet and also love it.  Why?  Because it works.  I have two seperate door access cards in my wallet that all I used to have to do is stand near the card reader.  Now I have to remove the access cards before the card reader can scan it.  Excellent product.
5.0,Gift for a sister who is a Tigers fan.
5.0,I was skeptical because right got these on coupon deal but they are wonderful
5.0,"Fit as as expected, fabric is good quality, it has light padding, and really sexy. Super happy with this item."
5.0,"I love this bs. Is beautiful, the color is really wonderful. Tuorquise. The material is thick. Is great quality for the price.<br />Listen to what it says, it runs small. Im usually 8 which is M, but I had to order a XL. Look for a covertor of Chinesse sizes vs Americans one.<br />I usually dont leave reviews but this excedeed my expectations. I leave a pic here."
5.0,The best. I had a real swalovski one and it is exactly same quality. I am so happy with it. I wish they had clear one with silver color.
5.0,Very nice. The picture didn't do it justice.
5.0,Excellent and cute
5.0,shipped fast/she hasnt tried it on yet but loved the unicorn
5.0,Very pretty and a nice size.......a gift for my sister-in-law!!  I know she'll love them!
5.0,"I bought a huge sink for my kitchen. its a stainless and very big and deep.I love things that require no assembly :) This is one of them - matches the description perfectly, is sturdy & seems durable so far. Was exactly what we needed to keep sink stoppers, brushes, and sponges off the sink while still letting things air dry. Also using it to hold the dish brush instead of letting it just sit in the sink!  Great fit which you can adjust by simply sliding the ends outward! Easy and it's also coated for protection of sink.  I like it because the water drains in the sink not the counter. I really like the expandable feature on this dish drainer, there is enough space for your dishes and looks great, not your traditional old school dish rack. It looks great in my updated kitchen.Just what I wanted and not available locally."
5.0,Fit my phone very well and I could place family pictures underneath it to personalize my I Phone SE.  Love it!  It came in a timely manner.
5.0,brilliant design
5.0,Love all the colors and the fit.
5.0,wife loves it...she sleeps in it
5.0,omg this dress is sexy. Very vavoom. I like it. Professional but kinda sexy too.
5.0,Best workout pants ever!!!
5.0,"Works great, glad it was large because i have pieces that are large."
5.0,Purchased this for my Granddaughter.  The UPF50 fabric was extremely important to have.  She loved the purple color and attached skirt to the bottoms.  The fabric is buttery soft.  The fit for her is very comfortable so we know she will wear this bathing suit.
5.0,Super cute top! Ordered a large because I like things with a looser fit. It's perfect!
5.0,Awesome shirts and quality!
5.0,I like that they are mostly cotton and not all nylon because your feet do not sweat.
5.0,LOVED IT ALL! EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.
5.0,"I thought this would be too small when I first opened the package, but it actually fits perfectly. It’s comfortable and I love that it’s short so it really flatters my curves. It hits me right below my waist, but above my hips, so it makes me waist look tiny and my bottom curvy. I’m 5’3, ordered the small."
5.0,"great watch cool features took a few mins to figure out but its great now that i worked it out, i just have to get some links taken out hopefully that wont be too hard"
5.0,"I purchased this mask for a wolf loving good friend, and she loved it!!!  The mask is very well made and the wolf picture was bold and beautiful.  I would recommend this seller and this item."
5.0,works ok....use with Santa clause outfit
5.0,"This mask had every feature I wanted.  I am pleased with how sturdy the nose wire is.  The little beads on the ear loops are a bit rubbery, so they grip the loops and haven't fallen off in the wash, but they're easy to adjust as well, and they don't dig into my head.  I wear these with an ear saver, which was included as a surprise in my order!  I wish the fabric was slightly thicker,  but the inner pocket for a filter makes up for that.  I also wear a bracket inside of these, and there is ample room. I clip the brackets on using bobby pins so it doesn't fall off when I remove the mask to eat, and the inner pocket comes in handy for that, as well.  Overall, an excellent mask that I recommend to everyone."
5.0,"This product is terrific! I have one foot which has hammer toes and a bunion, and I have been looking for a product like this one for a very long time(thus, I  ordered some more). They fit comfortably and make my foot feel great. Please,do not stop offering this piece of merchandise. My foot has not felt this good in years. I LOVE these toe topper socks. I am unabled to find them in shoe shops at the prersent time.********"
5.0,Its super cute and essy to install easy to wash wont ruin it very comfortable super adorable
5.0,"perfect fit, comfortable, lots of compliments!"
5.0,"My Granddaughter loves these gloves, they keep her hands warm and dry"
5.0,Love these for a lot of things I wear especially tunics and leggings.
5.0,"These are very trendy, very cute shoes for girls! My daughter loved them.<br />They are very well made and a great price on amazon."
5.0,This dress is so much cuter in person. The fabric is awesome not a bit see thru and the halter sheering has great elasticity
5.0,My granddaughter loves these gloves because the fit is just right and great quality leather! Thank you!
5.0,By far these are now one of my favorite pairs of earrings. They just look stunning and cute.
5.0,"Loved the fake shirt which helps with quick changes with costumes.  The  extra large size fits my extra large frame well.  The hat was a little too large, but still fits ok.  Someone said it looks like W.C. Field (a long ago passed comedian).  The hat was squished in the package, but with a cool iron and steam I ironed out the wrinkles."
5.0,"Runs small, so buy 1 size up!<br />Super soft/fuzzy pants and top. My son absolutely loves it. Great product. Love the brightness of the colors. The pants are plenty long, but the shirt, sleeves, and waist run a bit small."
5.0,It's funny how a watchband can get you noticed. Someone is always looking at my wrist and asking wow how much did that cost...lol.
5.0,"I was looking for a comfy, cute, casual dress and found this one. I figured for the price, it was worth a shot. So glad I ordered it. I ordered the XL, I typically wear a size 12/14, 36D and I'm 5'8"". The length hits just above my knees. It fits well through the chest and arms and flows nicely. It's has some stretch to the material, It's light weight but I could totally wear it with leggings and boots in the fall too. Doesn't wrinkle either."
5.0,"Love the feel of the material, the pockets, and the shape of the gown"
5.0,Icey
5.0,"This was a gift for my son.  He loves this jacket.  It has features that works well for what he needs, and the price is good"
5.0,I wore this dress to my daughters wedding. Fit beautifully. Do suggest using some two sided tape.. definitely on the vneck and maybe on the slit. The wind can and will blow it open.<br />Overall great purchase.
5.0,I travel at least once a month and it's nice to keep my passports and boarding passes in. The material is a little cheap (expected since this wallet was cheap) so its beginning to rip where the credit cards are.
5.0,"Love these mittens, they are very warm!"
5.0,Really superb quality!!!
5.0,Best belt I've ever had. I love that I can loop the outside on the outside. It's a clean look. Very sturdy.
5.0,Precioso es cómodo y buena calidad me encanto
5.0,Great bangle bracelets. I bought these to make gifts for family. All of the colors have stayed nicely. They are adjustable and easy to use
5.0,I ordered several different brands of this type of mask. The cheaper ones are of poor quality.  This one is by far the best and arrived quickly.
5.0,Very comfortable and no panty-lines.
5.0,They loved them. Good quality
5.0,So pretty and dainty. An added touch for evenings out.
5.0,Love this light weight and cute

5.0,It looks even better than the picture..love it
5.0,"Beautiful dress, bought the blue one last year."
5.0,The tree detail is so cool and different from others I've seen. Another great favorite pair!..still would like to have the little rubber backs though.
5.0,Very nice quality for the price!
5.0,"great brand, very comfortable and so easy to wear! Love this brand and their cheeky patterns...nothing boring and basic with this brand!"
5.0,I have wide feet and these are very comfortable
5.0,Just what I wanted and shipped to me earlier than expected......excellent
5.0,Excelent priduct
5.0,"Had shoulder surgery yesterday and woke up in a sling. The nurse was easily able to snap this onto me without having to crank my arm all around. Great design, easy to use without almost any negatives except maybe the price. You get what you pay for, I guess."
5.0,"I truly like the size of the glasses, the filters on the lenses & the color combinations.  The side arm bling is a nice touch.  I appreciate they have their own protective cove & a two sided screw driver when the little screws are loose."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a co-worker, she loved it! It was nicely made and the zipper was a nice addition. The colors were very vibrant as well."
5.0,Such a sweet and classic nightgown.
5.0,It's only been a week but I love it! Very comfortable and looks great under my clothes
5.0,Well made and great value to price. Fits well
5.0,I have a number of ratchet belts and love them. I am very pleased with the look and quality of this belt!  I am glad I bought this particular brand.
5.0,Great jacket!!
5.0,It keeps my sunglasses safe .
5.0,"Lovely fit, great fabric and color!"
5.0,Bought as a Christmas gift. Love the material!
5.0,This dress fit perfectly! I am 5’6” and wear a size 12. I ordered an XL. It has room in the chest and waist but doesn’t need to be taken in. Doesn’t smell but I very wrinkled. Nothing a good iron or steam can’t fix!
5.0,Fast shipping!  Fits great!  Love it!
5.0,This little bag holds everything. I work as a teacher and having my phone handy but out of the way means I have it when I need it. The quality is excellent and the cc area holds just the right amount.
5.0,So cute!!!!!!
5.0,Over leggings
5.0,Absolutely the best hoops. I wear this everyday. Never take them out. Easy to put in.
5.0,Love these bodysuits. The maroon color is beautiful on my fair skin. Fingers crossed they make thong versions of these to avoid the panty line effect!
5.0,Sweet product.
5.0,"This humongous spider—surrounded by gauzy spider webs and appearing to crawl across the windshield of a car—created exactly the scary effect I had wanted! It is well-made from fuzzy black &#34;spider fur&#34; plush with legs that can be posed and malevolent red-jewel eyes that catch the light. I wouldn't use it in damp weather because the stuffing would get wet, but otherwise it's a wonderful Halloween decoration for indoors or outside. The spider webs were not included, but they're easy to find for sale."
5.0,I use on western boots and belts. Works about ass good as saddle soap!
5.0,Worked perfectly for what I needed
5.0,Super comfy and better than I expected!
5.0,Wonderful product! I travel for work and Im a deep sleeper. I feel bad for the people next to my room in hotels when my loud alarms go off for a while. This watch wakes me up with no problem and doesn’t make a noise.
5.0,Great sunglasses.
5.0,"I've tried 3 different full zip hoodies at this price point and this Russell is hands down the best. After a warm water wash and thrown in the dryer it fits great. The wrist and waist bands stay snug. It did shrink a little but not to much. I think everyone expects a hoodie to shrink a little. The best part is it shrank proportionally. If you're like me you want a hoodie you can just throw in the washer and dryer without having to worry about it coming out fitting differently. I'm 6'1"" 190 lbs with an athletic build and the XL is a perfect fit after a wash and dry. If you like a looser fit like an XL Carhartt, I would go with a XXL Russell. I have both and I like how the XL Russell fits perfect. My XL Carhartt fits a little baggy."
5.0,It's as if Jackie Kennedy sent me hers!
5.0,Very thick and warm. Real wool. Made in the USA. Can't beat them
5.0,Love the colors!!
5.0,"Delicate and beautiful dress. My daughter is tiny 4 1/2 year old who wear still some 3t dresses and fit still good. I order in this dress a size 3 but the waist is till big on her, shoulder falls off as she moves so I have to send to tailor so the dress does not fall off down. Length was just perfect! Happy with the purchase"
5.0,The earrings were beautiful! I sold real diamonds for 17 years and you can’t tell the difference and since they are moissanite they even test as a diamond.<br />I’d buy them again.
5.0,Looked way better in person than in the pictures!
5.0,I was very happy with the quality of these bracelets. Gave them to my daughter for her birthday but she ended up giving me the other one so we can match.  She wanted to share the good luck and protection from the bracelets.
5.0,"Really surprised by how nice it was in person, buying more in different colors. Hoping it's of the same quality.  Flares nicely"
5.0,Now that's clean.
5.0,"Iam a female. Im 5'1 -5'2 weigh 110. I got the size small, though fit me long an just a bit baggy. Expected since these are for men. Though they are great quality and super soft. Very thin, great for workouts to help stay kool n fresh..wickers off sweat. Definatley would buy again!"
5.0,"Very nice band, held up with daily wear."
5.0,Work 12 hour nights at the hospital and these have made a huge difference on my legs and feet. My legs feel much less sore and less fatigued after each shift. They worked so well that I bought four pairs so I could wear them each time I work with one to spare in case I couldn't get to the laundry before my next shift. I highly recommend these.
5.0,"5 stars for style, comfort and actually being compressive throughout (had a prior problem with different socks only being compressive in the calf — I get ankle swelling, not calf swelling!) I’ve traveled in them all day and not had any rubbing or irritation. They’re soft, dry fast, and breathe well. For length I am a size 10 foot and the M fits well — however, I am 5’7” 137 lbs and have extremely narrow feet, ankles and calves. I usually have to buy shoes in Europe because most American shoes are too wide for an A width. If you are pregnant, overweight or have wide calves, I think these would be uncomfortable."
5.0,Very fast delivery!! The quality of product is great!! Looks very expensive!!
5.0,I absolutely love this top. I'm 5'2 130 athlete. I bought medium which was a little loose but hides if you struggle with any tummy issues. I want one in every color.
5.0,"Amazing product for the price, good idea for those who prefer not to risk being robbed of a $35,000 Watch in daily errands."
5.0,"Beautiful design,perfect size. I love it."
5.0,"Arrived on time, fit perfect, and great quality!"
5.0,"I love it!  I bought 3 for 3 different people and they all loved it!  Big, but not too big, solidly built!  It is gorgeous!  Looks and feels like it cost a lot more than it does!"
5.0,Fantastic Product I was looking all around Amazon for a Nice Pair Of Mens Square Frame Glasses that aren't a Billion dollars.And I'm 100% glad I got them they came with an Awesome case with a Nice clip and wiping cloth.I would 100000% recommend theese to guys.
5.0,Cute for camera enthusiasts! Gave as a gift. Made sturdy.
5.0,Love these jeans. Fit to a tee. Owwwwww!
5.0,The material is awesome. Color is great. Fit as expected. You will be pleasantly pleased.
5.0,Love my jacket and its my favorite color..
5.0,Soft and light weight for summer love it
5.0,For a 4xl which is three sizes bigger then I would normally need. They are still rather tight.. but they are wicked cute pants.
5.0,"Loved it, the fit is beautiful and sexy"
5.0,They work GREAT! Would definitely recommend getting this product.
5.0,This dress is so comfortable. The fabric is light and will not stick to you on a hot summer day. You can wear it off the shoulder or on. The pink is very cute and I want the rest of the colors. I got mine in a small but think I will get the next in a medium for a different look. I like this dress because it is versatile. I can wear it with heels or sandals.
5.0,Awesome. Love the pockets. I wore to a friends wedding. Super comfy. Super soft. I’m 4’11” and it came to my ankles in length.
5.0,"Definitely fits large.  I wear 9 1/2 - 10 and ordered a 9, which still had a little room.  Sandals are awesome - wore them to the beach and for waverunners.  Very comfortable and hold up so well."
5.0,Love these light weight but do keep my legs warm I wear dresses all the time
5.0,Great belt buckle! Nice and solid I ordered the white belt good leather kinda thin so hoping it lasts a while but other than that great craftsmanship all around. Depending on the size you ordered you might have to cut an inch or two off to get it just right for you just leave yourself enough in case you gain or lose weight. I have already ordered another one.
5.0,"Don’t like removing or changing your earrings hardly ever? These are an absolute must. Doesn’t irritate my ears, and I sleep like a princess."
5.0,Way to cute and funky!
5.0,"This bracelet is absolutely stunning and just the touch I was looking for to complement my Mother of the Bride ensemble. One unexpected and very appreciated feature is the clasp. Finally a bracelet I can put on and take off without assistance yet without the worry that it will come loose and fall off. Considering the quality and beauty of this and the Bling earrings I purchased, I will look forward to purchasing more Bling items for myself and for gifts."
5.0,"Light weight, but durable"
5.0,What I was looking for. Good fit and lightweight
5.0,"This is just the cutest, softest robe!"
5.0,Outstanding quality and great look.
5.0,"Heavy, quality velvet fabric, luxurious and gorgeous. Beautiful red color, super flattering. I’m soooo happy I got this, it’s stunning!"
5.0,This is something my husband bought for me. I gotta say that I was skeptical because my body does NOT look like the model but I was actually surprised that it fits really well. I am a D cup and normally wear a size 10/medium and this fit really well. The bodice ties so it is fully adjustable. I never felt like I was falling out or not secure.
5.0,"Super nice belt.  I always manage to order belts too small.  So the first one came, and yep, I ordered it to small.  But its such a great belt, nice thick leather with a great color to it, that I gave the belt to my son, who loves it.  And I ordered myself a larger one, which I now have and really like.  I just wish they had a grey one to match my grey shoes as well!"
5.0,Great shirt!!! Wore it to a concert and the husband was blown away.  It's sexy and well made.
5.0,"In purchasing this top I had second thoughts bcuz I found the image to be a small fit. However,when I got it it fit perfect and the material is perfect as well. I love this top and I love the orange color. This top is so sexy. I feel to purchase the black as well."
5.0,It was given as a gift to a big fan of Animal Kingdom. These look just like the one worn by the character Smurf. Recipient loves them!
5.0,I bought this for a trip that I had to fly ... Was hoping to avoid checking it but with all of the stuff I packed I couldn't I will say it is a beautiful bag made of great material and has a lot of room !! Very easy to carry ! Ended up buying the duffel bag to match !
5.0,"Not sure why, but the gray one is a lot thicker than the white or black one.  It is not for Spring or Summer.  I'm going to wear it for late Autumn into Winter."
5.0,is very good...!
5.0,Nice product. As expected.
5.0,"This is a steal for the price! I like everything about it, hangs really well and the fabric is nice, too. Came pretty quickly."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Just right... Great price...
5.0,This purse is so cute and love the color!! So delegate and beautiful
5.0,It is beautiful! A very good quality of  jewelry making
5.0,"It is absolutely ADORABLE!!! Great quality, super soft but probably will get dirty easy:/ I’ll buy all of them cuz they are so cute<br /><br />Update: I have it in my bag used it a lot so far, it’s not dirty! (I do try to keep it clean tho!"
5.0,It came quickly an was bigger than I thought but overall great buy
5.0,Nice and simple lapel pin. A nice subtle way to show your support to the Empire and strike fear into the hearts of those rebel scum sympathizers.
5.0,These  are super cute dress up shoes and supplies for a little kid. My niece loved them and they fit her 3 year old foot fine! I think it was a great price for the value of the box.
5.0,"Such an amazing product!! High quality, great craftsmanship.. I own already 8 different veseti bracelets that I have purchased mostly on their website and I couldn't be more ecstatic about the bracelets. A+++++++++"
5.0,Very nice material and exactly what I was looking for. The Banda is 100% cotton which is a big plus. The ones found in stores are usually not.<br />I’m super happy with my purchase and I will definitely purchase again.
5.0,I really love it and thank you so much
5.0,this bag is so well made. will last a long time. goes with jeans or glam look.buy it you wont regret it. quality is great for the price.
5.0,Perfect dress 👗 and it’s very fresh
5.0,Great product like that you can tighten it up or loosen it up
5.0,Very cute but recommend going up a size
5.0,Had this chain mail shirt for over a year and is still holding up fine. I was able to put it below my armor and seemed to work quite well! A little cumbersome though
5.0,It's the perfect size and the polka dots are very on trend right now with a satin dressy finish.  The shipping time was excellent and the were no surprises when it arrived. It makes the perfect accessory to my son's outfit
5.0,These are much more attractive than typical black. I can get them on and off easily.
5.0,These are perfect! They look classy and I have one of my ear holes is a little torn from it being yanked on years ago. These are perfect because they look like a hoop but they have a post in that front little flower keeps them steady in your ear hole.
5.0,Love our hats.  Go Bucks!
5.0,"The pendant is unusual and beautiful, both the mother-of-pearl disk and the gold flowers painted on it. It's also versatile. With short chain, it looks good with summer clothes. It's large enough that with a long chain it also looks great on a winter sweater or dress. Even if the gold were to rub off eventually, the disk alone is so pearlescent that it would look great with clothes of any color, light or dark."
5.0,"Beautiful,  color muted. Great for between seasons"
5.0,Adorable and it keeps me cooler than similar shirts. Love it!
5.0,This mask with attached long black wig was a big hit with the kids at my local Trunk or Treat event. It was comfortable to wear and I could see fine through the open slits in the eyes. It will last for years so I can be a witch on Halloween as long as I wish. The wig came with a rubber band holding the hair so it stayed nice and straight during shipment and didn't tangle even during taking it on and off. It arrived quickly and in great condition.
5.0,So pretty!  great price and reasonable quality.
5.0,A little short- I wear bikers shorts underneath. The fabric gets creased a little too easily but otherwise the fabric is nice and soft. Otherwise everything is great about this dress. Everyone loves it. And cheap!
5.0,very cute and the size was perfect
5.0,This yoga shirt fits perfectly. It is true to size and has some stretch to it. It is sexy and versatile.
5.0,"Arrived quickly. Feels great. Love it. I’m 5’3, 135 lbs. the medium fit perfectly. Oh and my husband loves it too."
5.0,"Ordered the masks and the kids just happy! They big fans of dinos) interesting design, quality is great. Would buy more👍"
5.0,I put this on my new Apple Watch! If it weren’t for the weight of the watch itself I wouldn’t even know I had it on! It’s extremely comfortable and lets you skin breathe quite well. I highly recommend this product!
5.0,"I love the two positions, one regular, one mist.<br />Holds nicely in hand."
5.0,Just as they should be!
5.0,i feel like a rockstar. amazing. the nose part is adjustable too!!
5.0,I love it .wish the clasp was different but would never change anything else.
5.0,wubalubadubdub!<br /><br />awesome pin!
5.0,"So comfy, I love the sleeves. They don't rise up when you move your arms, great for anything active."
5.0,LOVE these!! Cute and can cover ears or wear just as a headband. Very comfortable.
5.0,I loved this dress!!! I ordered two! Cream and Navy! They were the best!
5.0,"I've been searching for a collarless vest that wasn't fleece or duck cloth for 3 months. Comfortable, plenty of pockets and warm! I'll probably buy another one."
5.0,Great!!! Material and colors were as expected.
5.0,"These are sooo cool! Adjustable, neat way of clipping and super cool sunglass effect"
5.0,"I was able to use this bag to get into the game. It’s very roomy and the mesh pouch on the inside offers some privacy for money, medicine or feminine products."
5.0,Bought this to go under my daughter’s Halloween costume.  The tan is a little darker than pictured but it will still work for us.  The material is stretchy and thick so the quality seems great.  She’s an 8/10 and I got a 10 but could probably have done the 8 to use for layering and a 10 to wear on its own.
5.0,I absolutely love these!  I used to purchase the PINK underwear and these are basically the same but at a much cheaper price and in larger sizes.  What's not to love??
5.0,Best buy I ever made on Amazon
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9fe465850d27b2dd2ba83aef5bad1c13]] I picked this for the color and the cut. But the best thing about it is it has pockets lol
5.0,I love everything about these pj's & so does my 10 yr old granddaughter. These look better in person than in the pic. I ordered a medium for my 10 yr old granddaughter- 4'6 in tall & about 75-90 lbs & they fit wonderfully.
5.0,I just paid $200 for sumglass to be made into bifocals. Wish I'd seen these before that
5.0,Nice. I use it as a workout top
5.0,"I red review, so I ordered double size than mine...  But maybe 1size more was better than now.. Because the waist is too big than length..<br />But still I’m satisfied about this item."
5.0,"bought this as a joke since his nickname is Ninja, not the best of material for everyday use, but for a gag gift it fits the bill."
5.0,This is my second pair. It's the only model that I know that have a somewhat decent arch support. I think they should offer one with even more pronounced arch support. Once I've used this I can't go back to flat sandals.
5.0,Perfect retro ski hat!
5.0,Cheap sunglasses that do the job and look good
5.0,I love this tunic dress. It fits true to size and I’ll be able to wear it as a dress or with leggings. I ordered two floral prints and the yellow plaid tunic. I returned the plaid one because I didn’t like the material. I will be ordering more of these but just not the plaid.
5.0,This wig was super fun
5.0,"The dress is just as described,  since everyone said it ran small I  ordered a XL . I'm 5'3 170lbs.  I am totally pleased."
5.0,"Love the jacket. Ordered a size small (5’3” 120lbs) and the arms are a little long, but other than that it’s worth the price"
5.0,Super cute & arrived promptly.
5.0,Perfect for any outfit
5.0,This dress fits well in all areas. Its stretchy and so comfortable
5.0,"I love these pants! Super comfy and stylish! They’re baggy and fit as expected. I’d recommend getting one size bigger than your usual for extra room/bagginess. If it’s too big, there are drawstrings to keep them up!"
5.0,"This is the second one I've ordered, both dresses fit amazingly! The fabric is super flowy and hugs in the right places without being clingy. Definitely worth every penny."
5.0,"Nice-looking, good fit. I love it, wear it everyday at work and I don't worry about losing it."
5.0,Amazing!! Super cute I love them
5.0,Great sunglasses.  I like the larger lenses.  Can't wait to try them on the bike.
5.0,This dress is awesome for my teenage daughter.  Wears well and washes well.
5.0,"I'm a Service tech for a major alarm company and i love this watch, i've broken a couple swiss army watches already, and this thing is a great alternative to them, because if i break it, it costs just as much to get a brand new one as it does to replace the swiss army watch's band alone. &lt;3 Casio"
5.0,"The fabric is silky-soft and it fits well.  I ordered my true size and it actually doesn't fit like compression pants!  They are so comfortable, I wish I could wear them all the time.<br /><br />I've worn these with shorts to do cold weather jogging and I stayed warm.  These fit the model on the ankle, but I'm short so these actually hit my shoes.<br /><br />I also love the color--it's true to the photo."
5.0,Love the bathing suit! So comfortable and very flattering
5.0,It was a gift for a friend and she is all about family and this was a great buy!
5.0,The price was so good for something so cute
5.0,I bought this for my grandson that’s 9. He loves it!.
5.0,Wish I would have read a little more about this bag. I needed a smaller one because of the size of my laptop. However this one does the job it was designed for.
5.0,"I didn’t have high hopes for this outfit since crochet can fit strangely but boy oh boy I wa a pleasantly surprised with this. The material is super soft! The strings go down to my ankle, they’re a bit long  in some places but it’s nothing a little snip with scissors can’t fix. It makes me look curvy and cute even though I don’t have much curves. It’s definitely worth the buy"
5.0,"Okay. I am OBSESSED. These are possibly the most flattering leggings I’ve ever owned! The material is light and stretchy and super comfortable. It accentuates and lifts your bum, while trimming your waist and thighs. Great compression without being uncomfortable. I originally ordered these in a small and they were too big so I returned them for an x-small and they are PERFECT. I am 5’2” and 110 lbs for reference. I already ordered 2 more in different colors"
5.0,"Fits perfectly, looks great! We bought it in both black and yellow. Oddly though, the back of the top is made differently between the two colors...even though it’s supposed to be the same suit! The yellow top has a hook in the back, the black top is solid that you pull over your head. The black bottoms are about an inch wider on the hips than the yellow, too."
5.0,It was appreciated by my friends. It gives one an intellectual or nerdy look and at the same time it is very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"I am 6'2, 190 pounds with an athletic build. The Large-Tall is perfect for me. I love the extra length for my sleeves and to be able to tuck in the shirt. Even if you are 6'3 or 6'4, the Tall version of the this shirt is an athletic cut and should be good if you are thin. The XL was just a little too wide for me. The quality of this shirt is as good as it gets for wool layers. I have tried Icebreaker and Smartwool. I would rather by Minus33 because the price and quality is superior. I predominantly wear this layer under a drysuit while kayaking and skiing. It is very warm, feels great on your bare skin, and looks good enough to wear out to the bar once you've wrapped up the day's adventure. Generally speaking, I try and stay away from really thin wool shirts. I have not purchased any of Minus33's thinner wool shirts, but typically they break down quicker than you want them to. The nice thing about the Yukon is it's thicker design means that it will absolutely last longer than thinner shirts."
5.0,Bought it for my hubby for Father’s Day and he loves it.  It’s real leather so should hold up a long time. Bass symbol is clear and look nice.
5.0,This shirt is perfect for warm weather. The weight and feel of the fabric is what I was hoping for.  When ordering summer shirts I am always concerned about the fabric being so thin you can see through it. I can honestly say it not thin.  This shirt can be worn tucked in or it can be worn short-haul out
5.0,"Dainty, pretty and unique. Definitely got a lot of compliments. Like the other reviewers pointed out, because it has a fishhook backing, it might snap off from wear and tear. It's delicate. Might have to pick up a backup pair!"
5.0,I am not a big fan of online clothes shopping but I am very very happy and pleasantly surprised by the quality and fitting of this product. It was well packaged and fit true to size. I ordered XL which is 38 Kurta size. Fitting is excellent and colors are vibrant. Well made. Neat and clean cuts. Not sure how it will be after wash  though.
5.0,"The suit was very well made. Very stylish. Unfortunately, I didn’t like how it looked on me. Even though it wasn’t a suit for me, I would highly recommend getting it."
5.0,"I love this product; I am allergic to the nickel in jewelry that is fake. Therefore, I can only wear jewel that is made out of gold or silver things like that, so I was a little nervous about wearing these, because it usually makes my skin itchy and break out in to hives. I was able to wear this product no problem. The chain is sturdy and it isn’t thinly made like a lot of chains for necklaces like this. I love the design and it is great to wear dressed up or even when you are dressed down. I am able to wear this all day without a problem. It came in a nice little box that is great to use if you buy this as a gift then you don’t have to worry about buying a new box for it. This is a great product to buy for yourself or as a gift for someone else!<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I have not been monetarily compensated for my review and my thoughts are completely genuine and 100% my own."
5.0,Nice design and quality key ring.  Well packaged.
5.0,It's so cute I wear it with a black skater skirt and it's a perfect combo
5.0,"She wasn't sure if a 14 was going to fit.  She is usually 10-12.<br /> Advice:  you might go one size up depending on the size chart.<br />The dress did need a petticoat to look like the picture.<br />She could easily move her arms up and down, and kneel down or crouch and sit.<br />It made her posture perfect.  It made her sit up straight.<br />It is shockingly flattering (those are her words).  She was glad to find a dress on-line that fits a transgender person cuz in the past we have bought things from different places (used clothing stores) that didn't fit as well as this one does.<br />It also arrived earlier than expected, but I'm not promising it will be the same for everyone.<br />Overall, you can wear it to any occasion...fundraisers, weddings, dinner parties, or just a costume for Halloween or any holiday...she is very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,"I have rediscovered cloth hankies after half a century of using tissues! I guess we're all resigned to the search for a tissue when you need it, the tissue falling apart in your hands, the wastebaskets filling up with used tissues. I ran into an old friend who used a cloth hankie, and I was inspired. These little hankies are pretty, soft (but WAY sturdier than tissue), and affordable. I keep one or two with me at all times. At the end of the day, washing it takes under a minute, and if you spread it on your mirror, it's dry by morning and doesn't even need ironing."
5.0,"This dress is beautiful! The quality was as expected and it fit perfectly. It is very easy to adjust the straps to get the perfect fit for a size or 2 below or above what you buy. I think my little girl will get a few years wear out of this, which will be wonderful. Overall, great product and well worth the money."
5.0,"Beautiful necklace.  It was smaller than I expected, but it was perfect for my 5 year old granddaughter.  She loves it."
5.0,Great for church; cute but modest. I have nearly every color/version of this button-up dress. Also great for nursing. And comfy!
5.0,Totally love the ratcheting mechanism on the belt and great quality on the leather.
5.0,"I totally loved the bottom since it fit right and it looks great, the top is beautiful but it fit me big since I'm small at top but I gave it to my sister who really likes it."
5.0,"Fits perfect, holds alot of stuff. Seems to be sturdy. The tab that goes in your wallet was a bit long but I just trimmed it off. This is a hair bigger (wider) than my original holder which makes my pictures and cards easier to add and remove.  That being said, after several months in my wallet I can see no wear on it so I am going to call it a good investment."
5.0,Love this dress. Looks amazing. Great material. Fits perfectly. I'm already  purchasing more.
5.0,"I bought this bag bcuz I knew I would taking a solo trip to Europe and Cancun. Ive waited to actually use it be I reviewed it. Europe, I used it as my carry on. Cancun,  I used it a lot more. When I was at the beach, snorkling, even when I was in the buffet line, I would lock it to a chair. So far, it has been durable n dependable. I've  gotten several compliments. Im going to get more for a couple of friends that travel solo"
5.0,"The watch is awesome, thank you!"
5.0,My son got this for his girlfriend’s birthday. Very cute and nice quality! She loved it!
5.0,My college freshman who lives in a fraternity was thrilled to get these for Christmas! He has a size 14+ foot but the size 13 fit him perfectly.
5.0,"You're paying more; and you're getting what you pay for. I've had slips that are hotters; make you sweat, and you know what that brings about. These are warm/cool enough; both arch/foot support good. They look great; of course - leather makes a statement. But my priority was something supportive, substantial that would wear well and be comfortable. Loads better than slips in the past; but not that much more money than I previously let loose. Cheers!"
5.0,"I purchased this band because the band that comes with the Alta is nearly impossible to put on and take off.  I like that this band is silver and matches the color of the Fitbit Alta.  It looks like a watch strap.  The silver is a good color and looks like an expensive silver bracelet.  The band was delivered on time and the packaging was impressive.  It comes in a metal box.  Inside the box is the band and a tool for taking out the links.  I've read that others have had difficulty with this process, but for me it was quick and easy.  You need to just follow the instructions carefully.  They also provide a link to a YouTube video to show you how to do this.  Take your time and be gentle with it.  The trick is not to manhandle the tool.  The bracelet is large and I was able to remove 5 links without any difficulty.  The band now fits perfectly.  This is a very good purchase for the price and i recommend it."
5.0,"These are exceptional in style, fit and quality."
5.0,It fits perfectly ! And the fabric is really soft
5.0,Great Quality and Very Comfortable
5.0,LOVE these masks! I looked at so many and I’m so happy I chose these masks. They’re beautiful and perfect.
5.0,They are very comfortable and easy to take on and off. The lace also works at the arms to hide that little bit of extra weight between the arm and the shoulders.
5.0,absolutley fire asl
5.0,"Comfortable, great fit, nice shoes.  As with all color dyed shoes, I put a coat of ""Fiebings Acrylic Resolene"" on them, to protect the dye from bleeding (not that it shows signs of doing so, just a precaution on my part).  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ROOKIO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Love these shoes!!!"

5.0,I LOVE THESE SHADES ESPECIALLY THE BOLD COLORS! THEY FIX COMFORTABLY TOO.
5.0,I wore this dress with an amazing fascinator. The color is amazing and heads did turn. You must were this dress with the petticoat for dramatic effect.
5.0,I was worried about the size but honestly they fit great! I needed some of these for work and their pockets are deep enough my whole phone fits with extra room and the pants are stretchy material but not cheapy looking either and for this price! You can't beat that I shoyld've ordered 2 pair instead of just 1... I'm definetly ordering more! 😃👍
5.0,"What I like about the outfit, it was a perfect fit it made me look like money an that’s the look I was going for. It made me look very young. I loved it and I got many compliments."
5.0,Very clean look.  Sturdy and lots of room.
5.0,"I normally am a large fit but ordered extra large and it fit comfortably.<br /><br />I have worn this several times with a medium base layer and was comfortable in temp's down to 35 F. I like that the inner layer on the wrist clamps and prevents air going up the sleeve. Nice fit around the neck. Comfortable fit on the hoods and drops. After 5 rides in temps 35-42 F, I can easily recommend this as a great price-performance product.<br /><br />My primary criteria for cycling clothing is that it does not detract from the ride, basically that I do not notice it except to put it on and off. This certainly qualifies so far. Recommended."
5.0,compact but well built
5.0,"I ordered an XL going by previous reviews. Although it fits beautifully, its a little loose. I could have ordered a L. The cut and length are perfect. Its a very flattering dress for curvy girls. I'm a US size 10/12, 36DD with booty and hips. Would definitely recommend"
5.0,Better than expected!  Absolutely lovely~
5.0,They are really comfortable! I like them a lot!
5.0,"He’s used these before, and I originally bought these for me, but much too tight"
5.0,It is a beautiful metal.  My son loved it.
5.0,"I love this dress! One of my new favorites. Fit as expected (I normally always buy a large size dress). Fit is flattering. Pattern is cute. Material is nice (thin and not too hot, but not so thin that it's see through). I was surprised I liked it because normally I only like a polyester spandex type dress."
5.0,"Great fit, looks good. Hood is a little large but don’t use it that much anyway."
5.0,Excellent product and excellent customer service when I had a question. Highly recommend.
5.0,"These are sick aviator sunglasses. People might ask if these are too dark, but the silver mirrored ones aren't very dark and do help with the sun. It also looks great you get two for the price of 1 if you compare to some others."
5.0,These are large I was thinking for a bracelet but too big
5.0,Super cute top! Fits as expected. Dress it up or down. Great fit
5.0,Super pretty and fit perfectly
5.0,These are hands down the most comfortable socks I've worn thus far.  Thank you
5.0,Very beautiful colors very pretty products goes well with jeans and jogging pants
5.0,Very stylish and surprisingly lightweight! Great color for the holidays too!
5.0,I love this dress. I have ordered two more in different colors. I have received lots of compliments when I wore this dress.
5.0,I like this bra is a good quality. It's soft it s comfortable. I also really like that it comes with an extender because it was a little small around the waist in the extender made it so that it fit perfectly.
5.0,These are so cute! They wash nicely too!
5.0,Thanks so much I am enjoying it
5.0,"Very Stretchy!!! AWESOME FIT, CANT WAIT TO WEAR IT OUT!!!!  Love it😍😍😍"
5.0,Veey cute unfortunately i have to wait until piercing heal.
5.0,Fits great! Fabric is soft and I love it.
5.0,my nephew loves his shirt
5.0,"The glasses are much cuter in person! I plan to purchase more in another color. I bought these in the 0.00 strength for watching TV at night and they do the job. Fairly light weight, and not fuzzy, these are some of the cutest. I have several different pair of Eyekepper glasses in different strengths for different purposes and I love them all, especially these."
5.0,I love it. It is very pretty.
5.0,looks as it does in the pics and fit well good quality
5.0,"I LOVE these! They are strong, comfortable and perfect for my size 6 foot. They stay in place beautifully with NO slippage and don't show on ANY of my shoes. If you have a bigger foot than 6 I can't imagine them working as well since they seem on the small side. Without reinforced toes I wonder how long before a bigger foot will tear through the toe. As for me, I've worn and washed mine many times and LOVE them."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful very classy will go with the pants I just ordered or any skirt and be a classy dress occasion.The velvet drawings are breathtaking.I think its the most beautiful blouse I have ever owned.
5.0,"Really durable, can hold a good amount of heavy groceries. Love that it can fold into a pouch"
5.0,Great size earrings and and I didn't get any allergic reationn from them. Great buy for cute simple earrings to wear out.
5.0,"Soft, fits well, very flattering. The color is a pastel pink more than being but I loved that more."
5.0,Same as picture. Lovely dress.
5.0,Works great! I bought this because my eyesight isn't very good and I can't see what time it is on my clock without putting on my glasses. Regular watches with luminous time drop off in brightness quickly and are hard to read after 1 AM or so. The tritium light in this watch is very bright. I have no problem reading the time any time I wake up. Price is reasonable too.
5.0,Bought this for my grandma for her birthday she loved them.
5.0,The material of the shirt stays I got are of a high quality. I am very pleased with my purchase. Would certainly recommend to friends or family.
5.0,Great necklace for the low price.
5.0,Its amazing. The only problem is its very complicated to open and close it.
5.0,Quality shorts for a good price.
5.0,Fits as expected haven't been riding yet will update after first ride
5.0,"Size 14 jeans, 5'6'', 200lbs, and omg these fit great!! Very sturdy compared to Rue 21 leggings I've had. Very soft and almost velvet like! I am going to purchase a few more pairs in multiple colors!! Great either baggy shirts or under skirts. I just can't wait until I get my next few pairs!!!"
5.0,"These are very big and bold and funky. Nice price, lots of coverage for your eyes, and a cool, unusual look."
5.0,"I am called a sun glasses hoarder, and i guess i am. i go threw alot of glasses cause i need them to be dark, cause my head bothers me alot, so the glasses need to help, so i got these to try out, and i like them so far. no problems with the seller, i would buy from them again, no problems. very fast shipping, i am very happy with the item i got."
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, my daughter loves it."
5.0,I was looking for some light athletic shorts to wear this spring and summer. I like the material in the way they fit
5.0,"Has dark tinted lens, thinner style."
5.0,I found this to be exactly as I ordered. The metal ankh is solid and has a good weight to it. It is not flimsy at all.
5.0,"Very cute! But just know, it's not a dress, it's a t-shirt & tutu."
5.0,Very cute!. Dresses up jeans and a tee. Looks great. Everyone should have one.
5.0,"A must buy for all the geeky nerds that you love in your life. I gifted to my Zelda loving adult baby.  Its Perfect length, lightweight for year round use. The print is exactly as shown. Very happy with gifting! I’ll be buying two more for my 3rd generation grandGeekysons. Train them up...on Zelda!! ;)"
5.0,My son is very tough on shows and these hold up to the abuse
5.0,"I'm surprised with how warm this beanie is when I wear it. Some if my other team beanies don't protect from cold, but this is my warmest one."

5.0,"These compression socks made a tremendous difference after my 12 hour clinicals as a nursing student. I only wish they made them for my spine! I wore these with both Timberland nursing clogs and regular walking shoes. My legs felt great and my feet never hurt after the end of clinicals, regardless of which type of shoes I wore. I believe these socks made all the difference in the world. Highly recommend!"
